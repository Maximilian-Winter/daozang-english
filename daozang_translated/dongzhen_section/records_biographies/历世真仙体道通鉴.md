**Comprehensive Mirror of Perfected Immortals Through the Ages, Fascicle One**
**The Yellow Emperor**

The Yellow Emperor, surnamed Gongsun—after the Zhou established the five ranks of nobility, the surname Gongsun emerged. The Yellow Emperor was styled Xuanyuan, having grown up by the Ji River, and thus took Ji as his surname. The basis for this in ancient records is unclear.

He was the second son of Shaodian, lord of the Youxiong state. Fu Xi begot Shaodian, and Shaodian begot Shennong. When the Yellow Emperor ascended the imperial throne, he resided within the fief of Youxiong. His mother was a woman of the Xiqiao clan, named Fubao. One night, she saw a great bolt of lightning encircling the pivot star of the Northern Dipper, illuminating the outskirts. Moved by this, she conceived. As the pivot star descended, he was also named Tian Shu. After twenty-four months, she bore Xuanyuan at Shouqiu—a place beyond the eastern gate of Lu.

From birth, the Emperor was divinely inspired. As a child, he was precocious and quick-witted; as a youth, he could speak; in maturity, he was earnest and astute; and in adulthood, he was wise and discerning. His countenance was dragon-like, his forehead broad as the sun, his eyes like rivers, his temples high, his complexion dark, and his shoulders broad.

He first studied under Da Xiang and grew up by the Ji River. At fifteen, his thoughts penetrated all things, and he received the state of Youxiong, inheriting the lands of its former lord in Xizheng County, Zheng Prefecture. For crafting the *xuan* (imperial chariot) and *mian* (crown), he was styled Xuanyuan; for ruling by the virtue of earth, he was called the Yellow Emperor.

He obtained Shelong, who distinguished the East (explained below); obtained Zhu Rong, who distinguished the South—the Heart Star, where fire resides in the due south, the great illumination. *Rong* means radiance, the office presiding over fire, hence the title Zhu Rong. The character is composed of *nan* (south) and *wu* (noon), signifying the search for the south. *Qiu* (to seek) implies direct alignment: brightness and darkness, thus south as yang and north as yin.

He obtained Huofeng, who distinguished the West—*you* (酉) as the rooster, which gazes east at dawn while its body faces west. *You* is named for the hour it enters, and its latter half signifies the west. He obtained Houtu, who distinguished the North—*bei* (north) means yin and the back, hence the term.

The names of the four directions: *dong* (east) means movement, for the sun rises and all things stir. The character *dong* combines *ri* (sun) piercing wood, evoking the sun’s emergence through the branches of Fusang, the mythical mulberry. The sun’s origin lies tens of thousands of *li* east of Fusang.

The Emperor wed Leizu of the Xiling clan at Daliang, taking her as his primary consort. She bore his eldest sons, Xuanxiao and Changyi.

Initially, he rejoiced in the world’s devotion, nurturing correctness and delighting in fate, seeking ease and following the natural order, ushering in the era of Honghuang to unify the people. At that time, people transformed without coercion, strove without reward, their hearts joyful and unfeigned, their affairs plain and unadorned—this was the beginning of Great Purity.

Plowmen did not encroach on boundaries; fishermen did not dispute shores; markets required no advance deposits; shops closed not their doors. Merchants and travelers yielded wealth to one another; outer gates remained unbarred—this was called the Great Unity.

After ruling the realm for fifteen years, the Emperor grew concerned for the people’s disorder. He exhausted his wisdom and strength to govern the masses, cultivating virtue in full. He examined his merits and virtues, devoting himself to laws and teachings.

At that time, the Empress Yuan of Xiling first raised silkworms to produce silk—*The Records of Ritual* states: "The Empress offers sacrifice to the First Silkworm, the Lady of Xiling." Ge Zhichuan’s *Western Capital Records* says: "Within the palace stood the Altar of the First Silkworm, where the Celestial Elder and the Five Sages assisted in governance and transformation."

The Emperor took the trigrams of Fuxi, modeled and employed them, and based on the sixty-four hexagrams revered by Shennong, he composed the theory of the eight trigrams, calling them the *Eight Cords*, seeking the meaning of their doubled hexagrams. There were ministers at the time: Cao Hu, who crafted robes; Bo Yu, who made skirts; and Yu Ze, who fashioned shoes. The Emperor, following their innovations, created crowns and ceremonial caps—*crowns* denoted civilized attire, while *mian* (ceremonial caps) were a distinct name for crowns, their form higher at the back and lower at the front, resembling a nodding posture, hence called *crown-mian*. This began the replacement of fur and leather garments, as the saying goes: "The Yellow Emperor let robes and skirts hang loose, and the world was governed."

The Emperor used this to distinguish nobility from humility, ordering men and women to dwell separately, taking as model the principle of Heaven’s supremacy and Earth’s subordination. Observing floating leaves and rafts, he had three ministers—Gong Gu, Hua Di, and another—assist in crafting boats and oars, as the saying goes: "Split wood to make boats, carve wood to make oars." This was derived from the hexagram *Huan* (Dispersion), meaning dispersal and great communication, used to cross what was impassable.

The Emperor also observed the image of tumbleweeds to create carts. At that time, divine horses emerged from the marsh, named Marsh Horses—one called *Jiguang*, another *Jiliang*—originating from the ancient state of Da Feng in Bozhou to the east. These were patterned horses with white bodies and red manes, and riding them granted a lifespan of a thousand years. They appeared in response to sagely governance. Today, the *Feilong Bureau* has a *Jiliang Stable*, owing to this. Xue Zong said: "They are the same as the *Teng Huang*." Ge Zhichuan said: "*Teng Huang* is the horse; *Jiguang* is the beast." Thus, the beast and horse differ. Here, *Jiguang* is taken as the horse, *Teng Huang* as the beast, while Huichuan’s account diverges. There was also the beast *Teng Huang*, yellow in color, resembling a fox, with two horns on its back and dragon wings—one version says: "dragon-winged with a horse’s body." It was also called *Cheng Ruo*, *Fei Huang*, *Gu Huang*, or *Cui Huang*, originating from the land of Japan, with a lifespan of three thousand years and the ability to travel ten thousand *li* in a day. Riding it granted a lifespan of two thousand years. *The Six Statutes* states: "The dynasties of Song, Qi, Liang, and Chen all had offices for *Chefu* (Chariot Bureau) and *Cheng Huang* (Riding Yellow); today, the *Taipu Temple* has a *Cheng Huang Bureau*, continuing this tradition."

The Yellow Emperor obtained and rode it, thereby traveling the Six Directions, as the saying goes: "Riding the eight-winged dragon, he roamed the world," hence his movements and sojourns were without fixed abode. The Emperor first taught people to ride horses, and his minister Zhi domesticated oxen for use. *The Genealogies* states: "This is what is meant by 'harnessing oxen and riding horses, drawing heavy loads to distant places,'" derived from the hexagram *Sui* (Following), adapting to what is fitting.

His minister Huang Yongfu first created the pestle, as the saying goes: "Cut wood for the pestle, dig earth for the mortar," to aid the multitudes. This was derived from the hexagram *Xiao Guo* (Small Exceeding), meaning to exceed yet communicate. The Emperor made *chong* (a cooking vessel) to record classics, first ordering the casting of cauldrons to cook rice, then steaming rice and boiling congee, replacing the practice of eating raw flesh and drinking blood. His minister Hui first crafted the bow, and Yi Mou made arrows, as the saying goes: "String wood to make the bow, carve wood to make arrows." *The Records of the Grand Historian* states: "The Yellow Emperor made them." The efficacy of the bow and arrow was used to awe the world, derived from the hexagram *Kui* (Opposition), meaning discord and restraining disorder.

The Emperor first built houses, constructing palaces to avoid cold, heat, dryness, and dampness, calling them *gong* (palaces), meaning to dwell within. As the saying goes: "Upper beams and lower eaves to await wind and rain," derived from the hexagram *Da Zhuang* (Great Strength), meaning greatness and strength. The Emperor also ordered the construction of walled cities for habitation, beginning the replacement of dwelling in nests and caves. He further established multiple gates and watchmen’s clappers to guard against violent intruders, derived from the hexagram *Yu* (Preparation), to prepare for the unforeseen.

He also changed the ancient practice of clothing the dead in straw, burying them in coffins and outer coffins, derived from the hexagram *Da Guo* (Great Exceeding). He performed fasting and purification in the central palace, by the Luo River, sitting in the Black Retreat Stone Chamber with Rong Guang and others in inner contemplation. Suddenly, a great bird placed a diagram before the Emperor, which he received with two bows. This bird resembled a crane, with a parrot’s head, swallow’s beak, turtle’s neck, dragon’s form, paired wings, and fish tail, its body adorned with five colors, its three patterns forming characters. The front pattern read *Shen De* (Prudent Virtue), the back *Xin Yi* (Trust and Righteousness), and the side *Ren Zhi* (Benevolence and Wisdom).

The Celestial Elder said: "This bird has the front of a unicorn, the rear of a deer, a snake’s neck, dragon patterns on its back, proper footing, and a martial tail, possessing nine treasures: first, *Bao Ming* (Embracing Destiny); second, *Xin He Du* (Heart in Harmony with Measure); third, *Er Cong Da* (Ears Keen and Penetrating); fourth, *She Qu Shen* (Tongue Flexible and Extending); fifth, *Cai Se Bei* (Colors Complete); sixth, *Guan Ju Rui Gou* (Crown Tall and Sharp-Hooked); seventh, *Jin Mu Xian Ming* (Golden Eyes Bright and Clear); eighth, *Yin Ji Yang* (Sounds Resonant and Soaring); ninth, *Fu Da* (Abdomen Large). It is also called *Ou*; the male is *Feng*, the female *Huang*. Standing five to six *chi* tall, its morning cry is *Deng Chen* (Ascending Dawn), its daytime cry *Shang Xiang* (Auspicious Omen), its evening cry *Gui Chang* (Returning Prosperity), its dusk cry *Gu Chang* (Establishing Constancy), and its night cry *Bao Zhang* (Preserving Longevity). All correspond to the pitch pipes. When seen, the world is at peace."

The Yellow Emperor said: "This bird departs to dwell among the Nine Yi when chaos arises. It emerges from the Land of Gentlemen in the East and the Cinnabar Cave Mountain." His minister Ju Song and Cang Jie observed bird tracks and created writing—this was the beginning of script. Earlier scholars debated the origin of writing, some saying it began with the Three Sovereigns, others with Fuxi, or that it arose with Heaven and Earth. Here, following Sima Qian, Ban Gu, Wei Yan, Shi Bing, and Fu Xuan, who state: "Cang Jie was a minister of the Yellow Emperor," this account is recorded. Other scholars’ views on Cang Jie lack definitive evidence.

The Yellow Emperor cultivated virtue and righteousness, and the world was greatly ordered. He summoned the Celestial Elder and said to him: "I dreamed that two dragons presented a white diagram from the River, offering it to me. I dare ask you about this."

The Celestial Elder replied: "This is the sign of the River Diagram and Luo Writing soon to emerge. Heaven may be granting them to Your Majesty. Try fasting and observing." The Yellow Emperor then fasted in the central palace, wearing yellow robes, a yellow crown, riding a chariot drawn by yellow dragons, and bearing banners of entwined dragons. With the Celestial Elder and the Five Sages, he journeyed between the River and Luo.

Yet the dream remained unfulfilled. The Emperor then submerged a jade disk into the River, and a great fog enveloped the land for three days. Arriving at the Spring of Cui Ma, a giant perch swam upstream in the River. He sacrificed three animals to it, and immediately a heavy rain fell for seven days and nights. A yellow dragon emerged from the River, bearing a diagram on its back.

The Yellow Emperor said to the Celestial Elder and the Five Sages: "Do you see what is in the River?" The Celestial Elder and the Five Sages stepped forward, knelt, and received it. The diagram was resplendent in five colors, a white chart with indigo leaves and vermilion script, which he presented to the Yellow Emperor. Unfurling it, he named it *The Record of Interwoven Patterns*. He commanded his attendants to copy it and display it throughout the land.

The Yellow Emperor said: "This is called the River Diagram and Luo Writing." That autumn, having obtained the dragon and phoenix’s diagrams and writings and Cang Jie’s script, he created characters to replace the governance of knotted cords, crafting written contracts—this was derived from the principle of *jia*. *Jia* means "to store and arrange," and from the regulation of all matters—from the institution of robes to the creation of writing—nine achievements are recorded, as documented in Huangfu Mi’s *Imperial Generations and Remnants*. The Yellow Emperor’s accomplishments, as described in contemporary records and various texts, are listed above to clarify them. However, in the *Appended Statements* of the *Book of Changes*, these nine achievements are attributed to a lineage from the Yellow Emperor to Yao and Shun, as some earlier scholars argued they were not unique to the Yellow Emperor. Yet according to Huangfu’s records and the texts cited here, all nine were first established by the Yellow Emperor for practical use, while later sages like Yao and Shun merely emulated and refined them.

Thereupon, the Yellow Emperor defined the names of all things, composed the explanation of the eight trigrams, calling them the *Eight Searches*. He was also named Emperor Hongshi and Guicangshi, and the work he created was titled *The Guicang Book*—this was the beginning of the *Book of Changes*. After the Yellow Emperor instituted robes and skirts, he designed a dragon-patterned garment, embroidering the sun, moon, and stars upon it to symbolize Heaven, hence the ode *Dragon’s Inner Garment*. He took Lady Nüjie as his consort. Later, Lady Nüjie saw a great star like a rainbow descending upon Hua Islet; she was moved by it and conceived, giving birth to Shaohao. (Note: Lady Nüjie was not Leizu.) The Emperor also took an ugly woman named Mumou as a consort, who instructed the palace women in virtuous conduct, composing the *Ode to the Six Virtues*. He further took Feixiu as his wife.

At that time, the common people savored their food, admired their clothing, delighted in their customs, and rested content in their dwellings, free from envy or desire. Neighboring states were visible to one another, the cries of roosters and dogs audible across borders, yet even in old age, people did not travel between them, for there was no need. This was the era of the Yellow Emperor’s governance, when the people’s hearts were at ease—an age of perfect order.

At that time, the wind did not howl through the branches, called the "joyous wind of all under Heaven." Rain did not shatter clods of earth; instead, a light rain fell every ten days, aligning with the patterns of Heaven, and a heavy rain every fifteen days, harmonizing with the celestial movements. They took fine grain as their staple, called "great millet," its ears extraordinary. They drank from sweet springs, whose waters were as flavorful as wine, suitable for nourishing the elderly. They enjoyed the fragrance of the five *zhi* herbs—rare plants that grew in gardens, such as purple *zhi*, black *zhi*, and five *zhi* grasses, all divine medicines for immortals.

At times, aquatic creatures surged in the waters, and mountain chariots filled the fields. His virtue moved Heaven, and auspicious yellow stars appeared—celestial omens called "extraordinary stars," shaped like the moon, aiding its light, named the *Jing Star*. There were also crimson and azure vapors intertwined: within the crimson vapor were two stars, and within the azure, one star—three stars in total. A strange plant grew in the courtyard: each day, one leaf sprouted until the fifteenth day, when fifteen leaves had grown; from the sixteenth day, one leaf fell each day until the thirtieth, when all had fallen. In shorter months, one leaf remained unfallen, called *mo jia*, clarifying the moon’s phases—also known as the *calendar pod*. The Emperor cast mirrors to reflect this, creating the fifteen-faced divine mirror, a treasured relic.

At that time, Da Nao discerned the essence of the five phases and the ancient pointer of the Northern Dipper. He created the ten celestial stems of *jia* and *yi* to name the days, established the twelve earthly branches of *zi* and *chou* to name the months, paired them with birds and beasts to form the twelve branches, and combined them to create the sixty-year cycle—this was the invention of the *jiazi* system. Observing Fuxi’s three lines forming trigrams and the eight trigrams combining into the twenty-four solar terms, the Yellow Emperor created the calendar to determine the years. He revered Da Nao as his teacher, assigning three branches to each direction and establishing the sequence of first, middle, and last months—thus originating the methods of yin and yang.

Hearing this, the Yellow Emperor donned yellow robes, a yellow sash, and a yellow crown, fasting in the central palace. Then, phoenixes blotted out the sun as they arrived. The Emperor descended the steps, faced east, and bowed twice, touching his forehead to the ground, saying: "Heaven bestows great favor; how dare I not accept its mandate?" The phoenixes alighted in the eastern garden, perching upon the parasol trees and nesting in the towering pavilions. They ate only bamboo fruit and drank only sweet spring water. When they drank, they danced and sang, their voices like the sounds of reed pipes and flutes.

The Emperor then dispatched Ling Lun (as recorded in the *Han History: Treatise on Pitch Standards*) to the west of Daxia (Daxia lies ten thousand *li* west of Chang’an), to the valley of Ranyu beneath the northern slopes of Kunlun, in the Lazy Valley. There, he gathered bamboo from the Zhonglong, selecting stalks with even thickness and hollows, cutting two nodes seven *cun* and seven *fen* apart. When blown, they produced the sound of the Yellow Bell, the pitch standard for the eleventh month—the month when, at the winter solstice, yang begins to stir, marking the inception of all things. This reflected the era of perfect order, the vital breath of Heaven and Earth.

What is meant is that the Yellow Emperor could regulate the movements of the sun and moon and harmonize the qi of yin and yang, creating the twelve pitch standards—six yang (male) and six yin (female) tones. As the *Book of Jin* states: "The pitch pipes were one *chi* long, with six holes, embodying the sounds of the twelve months. Bamboo was chosen for its natural roundness and purity, while jade was selected for its firmness, steadfastness, warmth, and luster."

At that time, there was a descendant of Nüwa named Rongcheng, who excelled in understanding musical tones and first devised the pitch standards and calendar. The epoch began in the *dinghai* year (the *Basic Annals* records it as *xinmao*; now, according to the *Veritable Records of the Primordial Origin* and the chronological tables, the winter solstice fell on the star behind the Southern Dipper). The Emperor also consulted Tianlao and obtained the *Celestial Records of the Sun, Moon, and Stars* to mark the seasons.

There was a minister named Lishou, skilled in mathematics, who first developed methods of calculation and enumeration. Minister Ling Lun established systems of weights and measures—*quan* (weights, i.e., scales) and *liang* (measures, i.e., pecks). The Yellow Emperor captured Chiyou and thereby gained clarity in celestial patterns. As the *Guanzi* states: "Chiyou had retainers, and only afterward did [the Emperor]..." The Emperor also obtained a sacred tripod and thus began reckoning the solar cycles by counting rods. Thereupon, he aligned with the celestial and terrestrial principles, encompassing the sun, moon, and stars, and created the *Gaitian* instrument to observe the celestial phenomena. He calculated the divisions of the stars and used the twenty-eight lunar lodges to define the twelve celestial divisions: *Jiao* and *Kang* as the *Shouxing* division, *Fang* and *Xin* as the *Dahuo* division, *Wei* and *Ji* as the *Ximu* division, *Dou* and *Nü* as the *Xingji* division, *Xu* and *Wei* as the *Xuanyang* division, *Shi* and *Bi* as the *Kezi* division, *Kui* and *Lou* as the *Jianglou* division, *Mao* and *Bi* as the *Daliang* division, *Zi* and *Shen* as the *Shichen* division.

As recorded in the *Zuo Tradition* (Duke Zhao, first year): "In ancient times, Gaoxin had two sons. The elder was called Kuafu, and the younger was called Shichen. They lived in Guanglin but could not get along, daily waging war against each other. Later, they were separated—Kuafu was moved to Shangqiu to preside over the *chen* star, and the Shang people followed the *chen* star, hence the *Shang* star. Shichen was moved to Daxia to preside over the *Shen* star, and the Tang people served the Xia and Shang dynasties accordingly." From this, it is clear that the name *Shichen* only appeared during the time of Gaoxin. How, then, could it have existed earlier during the reign of the Yellow Emperor? Perhaps later generations altered the name of one of the celestial divisions to clarify ancient matters.

*Jing* and *Gui* formed the *Chunshou* division, *Xing* and *Zhang* the *Chunhuo* division, and *Yi* and *Zhen* the *Chunwei* division. He established the stars of the inner and outer heavens and composed books on divining the sun and moon. This marked the beginning of celestial observation, all derived from the *River Chart*.

He also appointed Xi and He to observe the sun, Chang Yi to observe the moon, and Gui Yuqu to observe the stars. The Emperor devised methods of divination and composed books on solar omens to discern fortune and misfortune.

The Yellow Emperor’s abundant virtue attracted perfected beings to wander by the Jade Pool, a manifestation of his supreme power. A auspicious beast appeared in his park—the *xuanleng* beast. As the *Central Candidate* of the *Book of Documents* states: "Its body resembled a deer, its tail a cow, its hooves a wolf, and it had a single horn. The tip of the horn bore flesh, signifying its harm to no living thing. Its voice matched the Yellow Bell, and its patterns were resplendent." The male was called *qi*, the female *lin*. They were born of fire and soared upon earth. In spring, their cries were called *guihe* ("returning grain"); in summer, *fuyou* ("nurturing the young"); in autumn and winter, *yangxin* ("nurturing trust").

The Emperor also encountered giant insects—cicadas and mole crickets as large as sheep, and some as large as oxen. There was a worm called *wan*, as large as a rainbow, corresponding to the reign of the virtue of earth. There was also a beast called *xi*, resembling a lion, which devoured tigers yet remained docile around humans, sometimes entering dwellings. People feared and resented it, so the Emperor memorialized Heaven and banished it to the northern wilderness.

Because of the auspicious signs of the *jing* clouds and the propitious *qing* clouds, he used clouds to name his officials. The offices were thus named after clouds, hence the *Jinyun* official. Some say: "The Emperor refined the golden elixir, and the *jinyun* auspice appeared, so he styled himself the *Jinyun* Clan. *Jin* refers to a cloud with more red than white." Thereupon, he established offices and assigned duties, naming them after clouds: spring officials were the *Qingyun* ("Azure Cloud") officials, summer officials the *Jinyun* ("Vermilion Cloud") officials, autumn officials the *Baiyun* ("White Cloud") officials, and winter officials the *Heiyun* ("Black Cloud") officials. The Emperor took the clouds as his teachers.

He appointed four historiographers—Ju Song, Cang Jie, Lishou, and Kong Jia—to oversee records and documents. As the *Rites of Zhou* states: "They managed household registers and population records." He also tasked Cang Jie with overseeing rituals. Kong Jia first created trays and basins to replace the crude cups and goblets, composing the *Pan Yu* ("Trays and Basins") chapter, which expounded the sincerity of trays and basins. The Emperor established the methods for headscarves and low tables, recording them in the classics.

The Yellow Emperor’s writings were profound and orderly, and the historians called them the *Fen* ("Great"). *Fen* means "great." Kong Anguo said: "They were lost in the Qin burning and cannot be recovered." There was a minister named Shi Yu who first created painting. A man from Jinan named Gong Yudai presented the *Yellow Emperor’s Bright Hall Diagram*, which featured a raised passageway with a tower accessed from the southwest—this was the origin of towers. The Emperor built it according to the diagram and named it the *He Gong* ("Harmonious Palace"), where he could observe the conduct of his officials. He then established the deliberations on the Bright Hall to observe the worthy.

At that time, an immortal elder emerged from the foot of Mount Qi, known as Qibo. He was skilled in explaining the properties and flavors of herbs and served as the great physician. The Emperor requested him to oversee medicines. The Emperor then refined the properties of the hundred herbs tasted by Shennong to treat illnesses, composing the *Internal and External Classics*. There was also Leigong, who expounded on the methods of roasting and broiling and determined the efficacy of medicines. Ministers Bian Que and Yu Fu established the *Mai Jing* ("Pulse Classic") to treat the ailments of the people. The Emperor discussed pulse methods with Bian Que and compiled the *Plain Book* in two parts—the *Upper* and *Lower Classics*. As Han-era physician Chunyu Yi of Linzi could predict the life and death of illnesses, he relied on the *Pulse Classic*. The Emperor questioned Qibo about pulse methods and composed the *Plain Questions*, along with the *Inner Classic* (now extant in two versions, each in nine scrolls). Later generations revised them. According to the preface of the *Plain Questions*, Qibo was its author.

The present scroll count appears largely deficient, with the *Eighty-One Difficulties* later supplemented and revised. It is also said that the Heaven-sent Plain Girl was tasked with treating human ailments, and upon the Emperor’s inquiry, the *Plain Questions* was composed. The Emperor questioned Shaoyu on acupuncture and moxibustion, thereby establishing the *Classic of Acupuncture* and the *Mingtang Charts*, marking the inception of acupuncture and medicinal therapies. When the Yellow Emperor governed the realm, he first adopted the central color as his title, initially residing in the state of Youxiong. He was known as the Youxiong Emperor, just as Zhuanxu was the Gaoyang Emperor, Diyu the Gaoxin Emperor, and Tang Yao the Taotang Emperor. He disdained warfare.

During the eighth generation of Shennong’s lineage, when Yugang’s rule began to decline, the feudal lords encroached upon one another. As the Yellow Emperor was titled after the central region, the four directions usurped their own designations, each adopting the color of their respective quarter. Historical records note their existence without specifying their names: the Green Emperor Da Hao, the Red Emperor Shennong, the White Emperor Shaohao, and the Black Emperor Zhuanxu. These were the descendants of the Four Emperors who presumptuously claimed imperial titles. The feudal lords collectively plotted against them, and the border cities were thrown into alarm.

The Emperor then ceased the construction of terraces and pavilions, reduced expenditures on extravagance, trained his troops, and fortified his camps. He inquired of the chiefs of Mount Shouyang in Hezhong Prefecture, who were unsettled in their dwellings, and ordered the mining of copper from Mount Shou to begin forging blades and crafting crossbows. Later, on Liubo Mountain in the Eastern Sea, he obtained a strange beast resembling an ox, with a dark-green body, no horns, and a single foot, capable of moving in and out of water. When it spewed water, winds arose; its eyes shone like the sun and moon, and its roar was like thunder. It was called the *kui* ox. The Emperor ordered it slain, and its hide was stretched over a drum, whose sound carried five hundred *li*. *The Genealogies* states: "The Yin shaman Xian first created the drum"—this is incorrect. The Emperor commanded his soldiers to blow horns in the manner of dragon roars; this marked the origin of drums and horns. He then ordered the creation of *cuju* games to train warriors in striking balls. *Records of the Western Capital* states: "The *cuju* field is the ball field." The Yellow Emperor declared: "When the sun is at its zenith, one must burn; when the blade is drawn, one must cut." Kuang Qujian heard this and said, "These are the words of the Yellow Emperor."

In the twenty-second year of his reign over the realm, Chiyou suddenly defied the Emperor’s commands. Among the feudal lords, he was the most violent, with eighty brothers, all possessing bestial bodies and human speech, copper heads and iron brows. They did not eat the five grains but devoured sand and swallowed stones. Chiyou first crafted armor and bells; the people of the time, not recognizing them, called them copper heads and iron brows. Li Taibai said: "The southerners, seeing the northerners’ wheat cakes and dried provisions, did not recognize them and called them sand-devouring and stone-swallowing." Disregarding the Emperor’s commands, Chiyou devised the Five Cruelties to harm the common people. On Mount Gelu, he smelted metal to forge cold-forged mirrors, armor, swords, and weapons such as halberds, great crossbows, and other arms, terrifying the realm and defying the Emperor’s authority. The Emperor sought to subdue him and summoned the feudal lords, yet after fifteen ten-day periods, he could not overcome the foe.

Reflecting on worthy sages to aid his rule and punish the unjust, the Emperor dreamed of a great wind sweeping away the world’s dust and grime, and again of a man wielding a thousand-jūn crossbow, herding tens of thousands of sheep. Awakening, he pondered: "The wind is the herald of governance; the grime, the earth’s impurities to be cleansed—surely there must be one surnamed Feng, named Hou. The thousand-jūn crossbow requires strength to shoot far; herding tens of thousands of sheep marks a skilled shepherd—could there not be one surnamed Li, named Mu?" From these two dreams and earlier visions of dragon spirits, the Emperor composed a book on dream interpretation and commanded his ministers to seek such men. They found Feng Hou by the sea’s edge and Li Mu in the great marsh. Feng Hou was first appointed to govern the people as Attendant-in-Ordinary, later rising to Chancellor, while Li Mu was made General—thus began the offices of Chancellor and General. With Da Hong as his chief aide, the Emperor aligned with the patterns of Heaven and Earth, the principles of light and darkness, and the discourse on life and death, forming his council of strategists.

The Emperor consulted Zhang Ruo on military strategy, who replied, "None surpasses Li Mu." Skilled in astronomical reckoning, Li Mu authored thirteen scrolls on the art of war, which proved invaluable. The Emperor then drilled his troops in martial arts to suppress the rebellious. He established the Three Dukes’ offices, mirroring the Three Terraces of the heavens: Feng Hou corresponded to the Upper Terrace, Tian Lao to the Middle, and the Five Sages to the Lower. (The *Six Strategies* of Taigong states: "Feng Hou, Li Mu, and the Five Sages form the Seven Dukes." The Five Sages were five individuals.) The Yellow Emperor then selected four men who aligned with his vision, appointing them to govern the four quarters.

At that time, a precious tripod was unearthed, and its arrival was hailed as "divine calculation." He also enlisted Feng Hu as a general, crafting the Five-Tusk Banner and beacons for warfare, and composed five scrolls on military strategy. Appointing Shen Huang as another general, the Emperor entrusted his son by Lady Fei Xiu—who favored nets and bows—to the role of Grand Marshal and Frontline Commander. Zhang Ruo and Li Mu served as Left and Right Commanders of the marching army, while Rong Guang was named Grand Marshal, overseeing the Six Armies and the Nine Laws of the realm (Rong Guang is also called Chang Guang). True Left and Right Grand Inspectors were appointed to oversee the myriad states. Minister Long Yu, brave and righteous, was also made a general.

When the Emperor marched forth, his army encamped for defense. He conspired with Yu Gang to strike Chiyou. The Emperor’s forces were adorned with jade, and he donned a yellow crown, riding an elephant-drawn chariot drawn by six dragons, with Tai Yi and Tai Yi as his charioteers. The Banners of Intertwined Dragons led the way, the Five-Tusk Banner guiding their course, fixing their direction. As the Emperor advanced, five-colored clouds like golden branches and jade leaves hovered above him, resembling blossoming flowers. Thus, he fashioned the flower canopy (the precursor to today’s ceremonial umbrellas).

The Yellow Emperor clashed with Chiyou on the fields of Zhuolu (a city in the south of Shanggu Commandery). Unable to prevail, Chiyou conjured a hundred-mile fog that enveloped the land for three days. The Emperor’s troops were disoriented, so Feng Hou, modeling the Dipper’s mechanism, crafted the south-pointing chariot to distinguish the four directions. (Cui Bao’s *Records of Past and Present* states: "The Duke of Zhou created the south-pointing chariot." However, it existed earlier, and the Duke of Zhou merely restored it.) The Emperor fought again but could not triumph. Retreating to the slopes of Mount Tai, he fell into a melancholic slumber.

He dreamed of the Queen Mother of the West, who dispatched a Daoist clad in a black fox-fur robe to present him with a talisman, saying: "Tai Yi leads, Tian Yi follows—he who obtains this shall prevail in battle." Awakening, he pondered its meaning but did not fully grasp it. Summoning Feng Hou, he recounted the dream. Feng Hou declared, "This is a celestial omen; victory is assured. Offer prayers at the sacred altar." The Emperor complied, prostrating himself twice in reverence. Indeed, he received a talisman, three inches wide and a foot long, its azure surface inscribed with blood-script characters. He wore it at his waist, gazing heavenward and sighing over his past failures. Through his earnest devotion, he moved Heaven, and a dense fog descended for three days and nights. Then, a woman with a human head and raven’s body appeared. The Emperor bowed deeply in obeisance. The woman said, "I am the Dark Lady. Ask what you will."

The Emperor replied, "Chiyou oppresses the people and ravages all things. I wish to defeat him decisively." The Dark Lady taught him the Three Palaces’ secret strategies, the Five Notes’ tactical subtleties, and the arts of yin and yang (these are the Dark Lady’s military techniques, later employed by Li Jing as the Nine Heavens’ Dark Lady method). She bestowed upon him the *Yin Talisman Scripture* of three hundred words, which the Emperor studied for ten days before subduing Chiyou. She also granted him the *Five True Writs of the Numinous Treasure* and the *Military Pledge Rites*. Wearing these, he vanquished Chiyou.

The Emperor then commanded Feng Hou to expound upon the *River Chart*, creating the "One Hundred and Eight Configurations," known as the *Art of the Hidden Stem* (dun jia). (During the Duke of Zhou’s time, it was simplified to seventy-two configurations. Zhang Liang of Han, alongside Xiang Yu, remarked: "The Four Elders... eighteen configurations." The *Divine Dragon-Borne Chart* states: "Concealing the stem (jia) gives rise to the name *dun jia*." One configuration is recorded in the *Jie Tie*.) This system predicted the outcomes of battles between host and guest. The Yellow Emperor also composed the *Sixteen Divine Calendars*, detailing methods such as Tai Yi and the Six Ren. He further elucidated the Dao of the Six Jia and yin-yang, creating the *Diagrams of Victory and Defeat’s Hidden Mechanism*, the *Essentials of Military Strategy*, and the *Three Scrolls of the Yellow Emperor’s Art of War* (as Song Wu’s tradition holds, these were revealed by a divine being). The *River Chart’s Military Decisions* records that the Yellow Emperor received a military talisman from the Queen Mother of the West, along with the *Complete Guide to the Commander’s Yearly Fate*, the *Tai Yi Military Calendar*, the *Twelve Scrolls of the Yellow Emperor’s New Military Applications*, the *Six Scrolls of the Yellow Emperor’s Xia Clan’s Military Omens* (later revised during the Xia dynasty), the *Two Scrolls of the Yellow Emperor’s Eighteen Battle Arrays* (later revised by Zhuge Liang into the Eight Arrays), the *Three Scrolls of the Yellow Emperor’s Questions to the Dark Lady*, the *Twenty Scrolls of Feng Hou’s Solitary Void Decisions*, the *Fourteen Scrolls of Wuchengzi’s Dark Military Disaster Omens*, and the *Three Scrolls of Gui Yuqu’s Art of War*, along with one scroll of diagrams (alternatively titled *Gui Guzi’s Military Strategies*).

All the aforementioned texts originate from the Yellow Emperor, though later generations expanded and revised them.

Thereupon, the Yellow Emperor adopted the strategies of the Five Tones to deliberate on matters of attack and warfare. He again led the feudal lords to campaign twice against Chiyou in Jizhou. Chiyou commanded *chimei* and *wangliang* spirits, summoning the Wind Earl and Rain Master to bring forth a great gale from the heavens, while ordering the Responding Dragon to store water for an assault on the Yellow Emperor. The Yellow Emperor entreated the Wind Earl, Rain Master, and all the female demons of the world to halt the rain. In the eastern wilderness, at the northern corner of the mountains, he gathered the troops of the Li, Tu, and Qiang, driving the Responding Dragon to the southern pole. There, he slew Chiyou and his father, preventing their return, which caused drought below—wherever they dwelled, no rain fell.

Chiyou was defeated at Guquan and executed in central Jizhou, a place henceforth named the Wilds of Severed Reins, located in Yanchuan. After capturing and killing Chiyou, the Yellow Emperor relocated his people: the virtuous to the village of Zoutu, while the wicked were bound in wooden restraints. The Emperor ordered Chiyou’s likeness painted on banners to suppress evil spirits, naming them the *Chiyou Banners*. Chiyou was slain on the eastern hill of Mount Li in the northern corner of the eastern wilderness, and his restraints were cast into the great wilderness atop Mount Song. Later, these restraints transformed into a forest of maple trees. As the *Classic of Mountains and Seas* states: "On Mount Rongtian grows a forest of maples, formed from Chiyou’s shackles."

Chiyou’s body was dismembered, head and torso sundered. Moved by pity, the Yellow Emperor commanded that his head be buried in a mound at Shouzhang County, located in Zouzhou. The mound rose a *chi* in height. The locals regularly offered sacrifices in the tenth month, whereupon a crimson vapor like silk would appear—called the *Chiyou Banner*. His shoulder and spine were interred in a mound at Shanyang County, located in Chuzhou. The shoulder and spine refer to his viscera.

The Yellow Emperor recovered Chiyou’s military texts: one scroll of the *Secret Arts of Marching* and two scrolls of *Chiyou’s Art of War*.

The Yellow Emperor established his capital at Zhuolu, in Shanggu Commandery. Zhuolu is a place name; *Dulu* is also called *Zhuolu*, though records err in transmission. The Yellow Emperor later contended with Yu Gang for dominion over the world. Yu Gang, relying on his descent from the Divine Farmer, resisted him. The Yellow Emperor first employed banners of *peng*, *ya*, *ying*, and *zhe* birds—as the *Six Codes* states: "Today’s *ma’e* banners"—while using bears, brown bears, and tigers as vanguard. They battled on the plains of Banquan, a place name in Shanggu Commandery (now Mazhou), and after three engagements, he prevailed. He then drove northward against the Xunzhai Rong—who were the Xiongnu. Any feudal lord who refused allegiance, the Emperor led his forces to subdue.

Here follows the translation:

---

In fifty-one engagements, the world was largely pacified. For his merit in suppressing rebellions, the Emperor commanded Qi Bo to compose martial music and drumming, known as the *Xiao Rao* songs, to serve as military alarms. The melodies *Tong Gu Qu*, *Ling Kui Hou*, *Peng Ya Zheng*, *Shi Zhui Ya*, *Zhuang Shi Nu*, and *Xuan Zhu Lu*—these were to exalt martial virtue and were called *Kai Ge* (triumphal songs). As the *Six Codes* states: "Zhang Qian of the Han obtained these from the Western Regions—eight pieces in all, remnants of military music known as *xiao jia*." The *jin nao* resembled a bell but had no clapper; it was held by a handle and used to halt the drums.

Thereupon, all feudal lords revered Xuanyuan as Son of Heaven. The Emperor ascended the throne in the *jiyou* year, succeeding the lineage of the Divine Farmer. As fire generates earth, the Emperor ruled by virtue of earth and was styled the Yellow Emperor. He took his place at the center, governing the four quarters. After breaking through mountains to open roads, he never rested in one place. He ordered Feng Hou to carry the tally books and Bo Chang to bear the sword. Each day, they set out from the Flowing Sands and returned by evening to the Shady Shores, covering ten thousand *li* in a single breath before circling back to the slopes of Zhuolu. The Emperor then summoned the hundred spirits to court and questioned Feng Hou, saying: "I wish to know where the rivers discharge." Feng Hou replied: "There are five rivers in all, each originating from the wilds of Kunlun. The Yellow River issues from the southeastern foothills of Kunlun—this is one of them." (The other four rivers are described in *Dongfang Shuo’s Record of the Ten Continents*.)

The Emperor ordered Jian Hai to pace the distance from the eastern to the western extremities, measuring five *yi*, ten *xuan*, nine thousand eight hundred and eight *bu* (one account says one *yi*, thirty-three thousand *bu*). From south to north, he measured two *yi*, three thousand one hundred and three hundred *bu* (one account says two *yi*, twenty thousand *bu*). From the easternmost Tai Huan to the westernmost He Guo, the east-west span was twenty-eight thousand *li*; from south to north, twenty-six thousand *li* (a *xuan* being ten thousand *li*). In the time of the Divine Farmer, the world spanned nine thousand ten thousand *li* east to west and eight thousand ten thousand *li* south to north, extending beyond the Four Seas. Wei Zhao’s commentary on the *Book of Han* dismissed such vast distances beyond the seas as implausible. Your servant, Yang, records in the *Daoist Canon* that the Divine Farmer rode a dragon to traverse distant realms, while the Yellow Emperor rode a horse to govern the lands within the Four Seas. The *Huainanzi* states: "From the northern to the southern pole is two *yi*, thirty-three thousand five hundred and seventy *li*." The three Huainan scholars studied the Dao, and this claim of extreme distance likewise echoes the *Daoist Canon*.

The Yellow Emperor first delineated territories and divided the realm into provinces. He commanded the great ministers of the hundred commanderies to bestow teachings of virtue, first arranging *gui* jades upon orchid and cattail mats. They ground various treasures into powder, mixed them with the glue of *chenyu* elm, and used the paste to demarcate lands, distinguishing ranks of nobility and the differences between Hua and Rong. (This is recorded in the *Changes* and *Records of Ritual*.) The Emperor traversed the world, and those who governed a hundred-*li* domain numbered ten thousand—these were the present-day counties and towns. Thus it is said: "First among the myriad things, the ten thousand states all found peace."

There was Qingniao Zi, who understood the principles of geomancy, and the Emperor consulted him to establish the classics. The Emperor also questioned Di Lao about the advantages and dangers of the five directions. At that time, a propitious herb named *quyi* grew in the imperial courtyard; when flatterers entered, it would point at them, so that none dared approach. A foreign land presented a divine beast called *Bing Lu*, resembling a deer with a single horn. When brought to court, it would gore any minister who was not upright.

Rongcheng Zi, a descendant of Nüwa who had attained the Dao, understood the laws of sound. He first created the calendar for the Yellow Emperor, beginning the cycle in the *dinghai* year. By this time, he had crafted the *sheng* pipe to imitate the phoenix’s cry. Su Nü arrived from Guangdu and taught the Emperor to play the fifty-string *se* zither. (The *Right Historian’s Investigations* notes: "This refers to the *qin*, not the *se*.") The Yellow Emperor reduced it to twenty-five strings, the *se* being seven *chi* and two *cun* in length. Fu Xi had played the *qin*, and Nüwa had harmonized with it. The Yellow Emperor’s *qin* was named *Hao Zhong*, and he composed the *Qing Jiao* melody.

The Emperor first established the seven emotions and practiced the ten virtues: the ruler benevolent, the minister loyal; the father kind, the son filial; the elder brother good, the younger brother respectful; the husband righteous, the wife obedient; the elder compassionate, the younger compliant—these were the ten virtues, marking the beginning of the Emperor’s creation of rites and music.

In the Eastern Sea stood Mount Du Suo (or Mount Du Shuo, possibly an error), so named because one crossed it by means of bamboo cables. On the mountain dwelt the deities Shen Tu and Yu Lü, who could repel malevolent spirits. The Emperor instituted the rite of exorcism in their likeness. He appointed Rongcheng Zi as his music master and composed the *Cloud Gate* and *Great Display*, as well as the *Xian Chi* music. He then performed music in the wilds of Dongting, at the Northern Gate. When it was played, yin and yang harmonized, the sun and moon shone brightly, and customs were pacified. (In the second year of the *Zhide* era of the Tang, a stone chime was unearthed beside Dongting; it bore ancient seal script and was identified as a musical instrument from the time of the Yellow Emperor. In the second year of the *Yongfeng* era, Magistrate Kang Tongzhong of Baling sent the herbalist Shi Jide, who had discovered an ancient chime while gathering herbs in Dongting Village. The chime bore seal script, and Prefect Li E of Yuezhou presented it to the court. This confirms the *Zhuangzi*’s account of the Yellow Emperor performing music at Dongting, which was no idle claim.)

When the Yellow Emperor was to convene with the spirits on a western mountain, he rode a chariot drawn by six dragons, with the *Bi Fang* bird yoked alongside. Chiyou led the procession (Chiyou being a banner), the Wind Earl swept the path, the Rain Master sprinkled the road, and phoenixes soared overhead. Upon reaching the mountain, he gathered the ghosts and gods. The Emperor played the *Hao Zhong* *qin* and performed the *Qing Jiao* melody. (Shi Kuang, skilled in the *qin*, was once pressed by Duke Ping of Jin to play the *Jiao* melody. Reluctantly, he played once, and clouds arose from the northwest; he played again, and a great wind rose, followed by heavy rain. The duke was terrified and fell ill.) The Emperor ascended the sacred peak of Kunlun and offered a grand sacrifice to instruct later generations—this was the beginning of the *feng* and *shan* rites.

At that time, there was a divine being, the Queen Mother of the West, the essence of *Taiyin* and daughter of the Heavenly Emperor. She had the body of a human and the head of a tiger (the *Classic of Mountains and Seas* says "tiger-faced"; another account says "tiger-colored"), a leopard’s tail, disheveled hair, and a *sheng* crown upon her hoary head. She was skilled in whistling.

Dwelling in stone cities and golden terraces, she made her abode in caves, seated upon the Mount of Lesser Breadth. Three azure crows ever brought her sustenance.

This divine being, the Queen Mother of the West, admiring the virtue of the Yellow Emperor, rode a white deer to present him with a white jade ring. Another divine being arrived from the south, also riding a white deer, and offered black silk—this was a sign that the Emperor’s virtue had reached even the earth’s tithes.

The Yellow Emperor practiced music to dance with the host of spirits, and was moved by thirty-two black cranes that soared and danced at his side. On the western mountains, he tasted a fruit resembling the plum in flavor and the crabapple in form, its blossoms crimson and bearing no pit; thus, it was named the *shatang*. Those who ate it could cross waters without drowning.

The Emperor erected a terrace in the land of Woren, west of the Queen Mother’s mountain, naming it the Terrace of Xuanyuan. He then rested upon the Mound of Mingbo, in the wilds of Kunlun. The Emperor journeyed to the land of Huaxu, where Fuxi was born—a land of wind, and the home of Fuxi’s mother. He later traveled to the land of Tiandu and dwelt there, which was later called the land of Xuanyuan (and in later times, Tianzhu, twelve thousand *li* from Chang’an). The astrologer’s records place it beyond the seas—this is fanciful.

He then journeyed west to the Barren Mountain and the Women’s Kingdom, and again roamed the Kunlun Palace by the Red Waters. Gazing north and south, he returned but left behind his Dark Pearl. He sent the keen-eyed Li Lou to seek it, but he failed; then he sent Wang Xiang, who retrieved it. Later, the daughter of the Meng clan, named Qixiang, stole the Dark Pearl—an emblem of the Dao—and cast it into the sea, becoming a water spirit. The *Shu Tao Hang* states: "In Chengdu Prefecture, there is a shrine to Qixiang." Tang Ying, in his *Ancient History*, notes: "The daughter of the Meng clan stole the Yellow Emperor’s Dark Pearl, drowned in the river, and transformed into this spirit. She corresponds to the Zhen constellation above and extends to the Ox mansion." Guo Pu’s *Rhapsody on the Yangtze* says: "Qixiang obtained the pearl and dwelt in Zhong." The present shrine on the Yangtze’s shoals is that very place.

The Emperor, on his royal progress, traveled east to the sea and ascended Mount Huan. By the seashore, he encountered the divine beast Baize, which could speak and comprehend the essence of all things. He inquired of it concerning the affairs of ghosts and spirits throughout the world—how from ancient times, the refined *qi* became beings, and wandering souls wrought transformations, numbering eleven thousand five hundred and twenty kinds. Baize recounted them all, and the Emperor commanded that they be depicted in illustrations and shown to the world. He then composed an exorcism text to invoke against evil.

As the Emperor journeyed, his primary consort, Leizu, died upon the road. He sacrificed to her and made her the ancestral spirit. He ordered his secondary consort, Mumo, to oversee her rites along the way and perform seasonal sacrifices, thus appointing Mumo as the Fangxiang—facing her direction—to guard the funeral, also called the Fang Sang. Today, when people set out on a journey, they first offer wine and food to the road, calling it the "ancestral farewell." *Zu* means "to send off." Yan Shigu’s commentary on the *Book of Han* states: "The Yellow Emperor’s son became the road spirit"—this is erroneous. Cui Hao’s *Monthly Ordinances* also claims the Yellow Emperor’s son, which is likewise baseless. None of these accounts are reliable; *zu* here refers to Leizu.

When the world was fully pacified under the Yellow Emperor and auspicious omens had converged, he ascended to perform the *feng* rite upon Mount Tai and the *shan* rite upon Mount Tingting (a lesser peak at the foot of Tai). He also performed the *shan* upon Mount Jiji, inscribed his achievements upon the lofty peaks, and instituted seasonal sacrifices to the Flame Emperor. He observed the heavens, examined the earth, constructed palaces, designed garments, calibrated the *qi* and musical pitches, and established the hundred crafts.

Through accumulated merit and virtue, Heaven bestowed upon him the imperial carriage and axe, the canopy and feathered banners, and the soldiers of the celestial spirits. The Yellow Emperor composed the *Inscription of the Xuanyu*, and when his affairs were complete, he established the pitch-pipes to determine surnames—Confucius and Jing Fang both practiced this, recording the bells and refining the sounds.

The Emperor had four consorts: Leizu, Mumo, Feixiu, and Nüjie. They bore him twenty-five sons, of whom twelve (or thirteen, by some accounts) received surnames: Ji, You, Qi, Ji, Teng, Zhen, Ren, Gou, Xi, Gu, Xuan, and Yi. (The *Records of the Grand Historian* states sixty-one surnames, differing only in the Li surname.) The claim that the Yellow Emperor’s surname was Gongsun spans eighteen generations over fifteen hundred years, while the twelve surnames and thirteen generations span one thousand and seventy-two years. Some histories record twelve surnames, omitting De and Zhuan to signify their obscurity. Ji, Qi, Teng, Ren, Xi, and Gu were those of virtue and renown.

The assertion that the Yellow Emperor’s surname was Gongsun, though handed down in ancient histories, is ultimately untenable. The Yellow Emperor was born a bear and grew up by the Ji River; thus, he should have taken Ji as his surname. When King Wu of Zhou called himself the nineteenth-generation descendant of the Yellow Emperor, a scion of the Ji surname, this confirms the Yellow Emperor’s Ji surname—it is not so. Moreover, the Zhou truly established the five ranks of nobility—duke, marquis, earl, viscount, and baron—and the descendants of nobles often took "Gongsun" as their surname, meaning "the grandson of a duke." Thus, those who combined "Gong" and "Zi" into a surname, along with eighty-five other clans, were not contemporaries of the Yellow Emperor.

The Yellow Emperor had nine sons, each enfeoffed with a state (as Pan Anren’s poem attests, though its origins are unknown). His primary consort, Leizu, bore two sons, Xuanxiao and Changyi, neither of whom ascended the throne. Xuanxiao attained the Dao and became the water spirit of the north. Changyi dwelt by the Weak Waters, while Shaohao, the Yellow Emperor’s youngest son—born of the consort Nüjie—was styled the Lord of Metal and Heaven and later succeeded to the throne.

The Yellow Emperor’s daughter drowned in the Eastern Sea and transformed into a bird named Jingwei, which ever carries twigs and stones from the western mountains to fill the Eastern Sea.

Changyi married the daughter of the Shu Mountain clan and begot Zhuanxu, who ascended the throne as the Lord of High Brightness, the Yellow Emperor’s rightful grandson.

Huang Gong Tuoba, the younger son of Changyi, was enfeoffed in the northern lands. As the Yellow Emperor’s virtue was of earth, he transformed customs, taking "earth" as *tuo* and "lord" as *ba*, thus adopting the surname Tuoba.

Yuqiang, a descendant of the Yellow Emperor who did not ascend the throne, also attained the Dao and dwelt in the north as a water spirit.

Minor Lord of Brightness had seven sons. In the time of Zhuanxu, one of them was deemed virtuous in conduct and was granted the surname Man; the rest remain unrecorded.

Once the world was ordered and all things and implements were in place, the Yellow Emperor sought the hidden and inquired of the Dao, aspiring to attain longevity and enduring vision—what is called first governing the age and then ascending as an immortal. At that time, there was a potter named Yuzi who encountered a divine person who taught him the method of fire. From it arose five-colored smoke, which he could follow up and down. Having mastered the Dao, he departed as an immortal, journeying to the Flowing Sands to feed on flying fish. He briefly died for two hundred years, then revived and composed the *Sandbank Hymn*, which reads:

*Green leaves blaze, a thousand years unfurled,*
*Ten thousand ages briefly die to feed on flying fish.*

There was also the son of Wu Guang, eight feet and seven inches tall, a divine immortal who, by the Xia era, had no fear of cold. He cultivated his nature, played the zither, and by virtue of the Dao enjoyed eternal life. There was Chi Jiang Ziyu, who ate no grains but fed on a hundred herbs to prolong his years. In the time of Yao, he served as a carpenter, able to rise and descend with the wind—already two thousand years had passed. There was Master Rong Cheng, skilled in the arts of supplementation and guidance, who preserved life and nurtured qi. The spirit of grain did not die, and he could restore white hair to black and fallen teeth to growth. The Yellow Emperor admired his Dao and constructed the Five Cities and Twelve Towers to await divine persons.

He then sought the Dao, traveling to Mount Hua and Mount Shou, and eastward to Mount Tai. There he encountered strange beings and communed with divine immortals. He sought divine persons on Penglai and, upon his return, received the myriad spirits at Bright Court, Zhongshan, Ganquan, Hanmen, and Gukou—all north of Chang’an in Ganquan and Yunyang.

The Yellow Emperor then performed the round-mound sacrifice to Heaven, intending to seek the supreme Dao. He took the Nine Primal Masters as his teachers and, in the first year of the Earthly Sovereign’s reign, on the first *yin* day of the first month, fasted at Mount Shou in Puyi County, Hedong. He continued his travels to seek the true Dao, appointing Fang Ming as his charioteer, Chang Yu as his outrider, and Zhang Ruo and Miao Liao as his guides. (Miao is pronounced *xi*; Liao is pronounced *shu*. Another version writes *peng* for Miao, meaning "companion," and *kun* for Liao, meaning "harmonious.") They arrived at the wilds of Xiangcheng, where the Seven Sages all lost their way. They encountered a boy herding horses, and the Yellow Emperor asked him, "How should one govern the world?" The boy replied, "Governing the world is no different from herding horses—simply remove what harms them." The Yellow Emperor hailed him as Heaven’s Master and withdrew.

When he reached Yuanyuan, the land had an undying tree. Those who ate its fruit and leaves never died. There was a cinnabar spring whose waters granted longevity. A giant serpent harmed the people, but the Yellow Emperor repelled it with realgar. The serpent lingered for a time before retreating. (The *Record of Foreign Lands* states it lingered for nine years.) The Emperor commanded his three sons to practice consuming it, and all lived for three hundred years.

By the time he reached Hongdi, ascending Mount Juci in Yangdi, he met the Great Courtyard Lord of Mian County (a divine being of Chen) and also encountered the Yellow Canopy Youth, from whom he received the *Divine Mushroom Charts* in seventy-two scrolls. Arriving at Mount Dai, he met Huang Zizhong and received the *Nine Eggplant Master’s Formula*. (Another version states he met the Central Yellow Perfected One on Mount Kongtong. Another says the formula originated on Mount Kongtong in Yuanzhou. Ying Shao claims it was in Longyou, which is incorrect.)

He ascended Mount Kongtong and met Guang Chengzi, inquiring about the supreme Dao. (Zhuangzi writes it as Mount Kongtong; Sima Biao’s commentary says Kongtong is the mountain beneath the Dipper. Another version places it thirty *li* east of Yucheng in Liangguo. Yet another says there are three Kongtong Mountains in the world, and the one in Ruyin is where the Yellow Emperor sought the Dao. Another states the Kongtong in Longyou is the true site where the Yellow Emperor sought the Dao; today, the mountain has a Hall of Seeking the Dao, and at its foot stands the Xuanyuan Temple.) It is noted that the Yellow Emperor’s meeting with Guang Chengzi to inquire about the Dao did not occur in only one place; later, all such sites were named Kongtong, and these records are preserved together. Guang Chengzi did not answer. The Emperor withdrew, relinquished the world, built a solitary chamber, spread white cogon grass, and waited three months before returning. He asked again about the Dao of cultivating the body, and Guang Chengzi then bestowed upon him the *Scripture of Spontaneity* in one scroll.

The Yellow Emperor set aside the dignity of emperor and king, adopting the pattern of the boar and piglet. He ascended Mount Ji and Mount Wangwu, opened the stone coffer, and uncovered the jade tablets, obtaining the *Commentary on the Nine Cauldrons’ Divine Elixir*. Traveling south to the Yangtze, he climbed Mount Xiongxiang (Mount Xiong is in Zhaoling, Changsha; Mount Xiang is in Yiyang, Changsha), then went to Mount Tiantai, where he received the *Divine Elixir of Golden Liquor*. Eastward to Mount Qingqiu, he met the Master of the Purple Palace and received the *Inner Writ of the Three Sovereigns*—a large-character text. (The *Baopuzi* states it comprises twenty scrolls, used to summon the myriad spirits.) He gathered the five sacred mushrooms from the dark ravine, ascended Mount Yuanlong, and rested beneath the *Jianmu* tree, where the hundred spirits ascend and descend. He plucked the *ruogan* mushroom (another version says flower) and drank the waters of the cinnabar spring.

Southward to Mount Qingcheng, he paid respects to the Central Yellow Elder. He then ascended Mount Yuntai and met Master Yu, from whom he received the *Dragon Harness Scripture*. He inquired of the Central Yellow Elder about the Dao of the True One. The Elder said, "You already rule the world; do you still seek long life and immortality? Is this not greed?" Despite repeated objections, the Elder eventually transmitted the Dao, and the Emperor bowed in gratitude.

Afterward, he passed by Mount Lu and, in order, offered sacrifices to the envoys of the Qingcheng Elder.

The emissary of Mount Lu held a rank equivalent to that of Imperial Censor and oversaw the Dao of all immortal officials, serving as the inspector of the Five Peaks. Furthermore, the Lord of Gangshan was enfeoffed as the Controller of Destinies of the Nine Heavens, who presided over the register of life and death. The Yellow Emperor, observing that each of the Four Peaks had auxiliary mountains while the Southern Peak stood solitary without support, presented a memorial to the Supreme Dao Lord of the Three Heavens, designating Mount Huo as the Heir Apparent and Mount Qian as the deputy of Mount Heng to complete the system. He then appointed ministers to assist in governance.

The Emperor personally ascended the mountains and sketched their forms to create the *True Forms of the Five Peaks*. He traveled to refine cinnabar in the Hall of Jinyun, where he compounded elixirs upon the earth. At that time, clouds neither red nor purple appeared, and thus the place was named Jinyun, and the mountain came to be called Mount Jinyun. The Emperor concealed the *Illustrated Charts of Military Victory and Defeat* and the *Writings of the Six Jia and Yin-Yang* within Mount Miao. He harmonized auspicious omens at Mount Fu, where he attained the Dao of immortality.

He served the Primordial Sovereign of the Great One and received essential records on cultivating the Dao and nurturing life from the Mysterious Maiden, while the Plain Maiden transmitted the method of "returning essence to replenish the brain." The Mysterious Maiden bestowed upon the Emperor the *Divine Formula of Compliance*, which he concealed within Mount Kongtong. The Emperor refined his astronomical calculations under Shanji and Limu, recorded the principles of bodily application with Qibo and Leigong, and studied ancient prognostications with Master Feng Hou.

Having received the Mysterious Maiden’s transmission of the *Classic of the Hidden Talisman*, the Emperor was able to inwardly align with celestial mechanisms and outwardly harmonize with human affairs. His governance extended south to Jiaozhi, north to Youling, west to the Flowing Sands, and east to the Coiled Tree. The Emperor declared his intent to relinquish the world, saying, "I have heard of letting the world be, not of governing it. I have wearied the world for too long and shall now rest my chariot in the Dark Garden to return to my true nature."

After completing the Feng and Shan sacrifices, the Emperor mined copper from Mount Shou and cast the Nine Tripods beneath Mount Jing, symbolizing the Great One. The tripods, placed in the prefecture, embodied divine substance and refined essence. He lived for three hundred and sixty years before ascending as an immortal to Mount Jiuyi. Three thousand six hundred years later, Emperor Yao governed the world. When the great floods raged and the people suffered, Yu took pity and was miraculously born on Mount Shiniu. It is said that a woman of the Youdi tribe, while drawing water at dusk, found a stone like a pearl, cherished it, and swallowed it, becoming pregnant. After fourteen months, she gave birth to a son. When he grew, he understood the sources of springs, and thus he was named Yu; later generations called him the Divine Yu. The site is now known as Shiniu in Shiquan Prefecture.

The golden tablets inscribed with jade-like characters were the Yellow Emperor’s bequeathed admonitions. He also inscribed one copy of the *Five Sacred Talismans of the Numinous Treasure* on a golden tablet and concealed it within Mount Wanwei. The Emperor often cast vessels of gold, each inscribed with ancient characters to record the years and months. When he performed sacrifices, fragrant winds would arrive, spirits would gather, and his resolve to transcend the mortal realm was fulfilled.

He left his cap, sword, and the black jade pendant at the precipitous summit of Mount Kunlun by Dinghu Lake, establishing a hall below—this was the Terrace of Xuanyuan on Mount Kunlun. At that time, Ma Shihuang, skilled in veterinary medicine, possessed the wondrous thought of divine penetration. A dragon descended into his courtyard, prostrated itself, and opened its mouth. Shihuang examined it and said, "This dragon is ill and seeks my healing." He then threaded a needle through the dragon’s mouth, upper and lower, and administered a decoction of licorice boiled in cow’s milk. The dragon’s illness was cured, and Shihuang ascended as an immortal upon it.

Upon hearing this, the Yellow Emperor chose an auspicious day to divine the date of his return home and ascension. He obtained the cyclical sign *wuwu*. Indeed, a dragon arrived, its whiskers hanging down to welcome him. The Emperor mounted the dragon, accompanied by his friend Wuweizi and seventy-two officials and attendants. Those minor officials who could not ascend clung to the dragon’s whiskers and the Emperor’s bow, weeping and wailing. The bow was thereafter called *Wuhao*, and the site of the tripod-casting became known as Dinghu.

Later, his minister Zuo Zhe carved a wooden likeness of the Yellow Emperor and led the feudal lords in paying homage. The officials, overwhelmed with longing, either took his desk and staff to establish temples for worship or retrieved his clothing and cap to guard his true tomb. Thus, there is a tomb on Mount Qiao, and wherever the Yellow Emperor once traveled, shrines were erected. Five hundred years later, the tomb on Mount Qiao collapsed, leaving only the sword and a red crow, which also vanished one day.

The Yellow Emperor ruled for one hundred and twenty years in total, reigning for one hundred and five years. After ascending as an immortal, he rose to become the Sovereign of the Great One, and his spirit became the constellation Xuanyuan in the Southern Palace. The form of the Yellow Dragon was later honored, and he was ranked among the Five Thearchs of the Center, paired with Heaven. As the Yellow Emperor embodied the virtue of Earth, he occupied the central position, governing the four directions. The Star of Saturn was paired with him as his son, named the Pivot Spirit, serving as his assistant in sacrificial offerings.

The Emperor’s son, Shaohao, named Zhi and styled Qingyang, was titled the Metallic Celestial Lord. He occupied the imperial throne for eighty-one years (the *Annals of Emperors and Kings* records eighty-four years; Liu Shu’s *Outer Records* omits Shaohao). His capital was at Qufu, now Yanzhou, and his descendants succeeded one another for four hundred years.

The Yellow Emperor’s grandson Zhuanxu, titled the High Lord of Yang, was born to the Lady of Mount Shu. Endowed with sagely virtue, he reigned for seventy-eight years (the *Annals* records eighty-four years; the *Outer Records* concurs). He lived to ninety-eight and established his capital at Shangqiu and Puyang, now Pu Prefecture. From Zhuanxu onward, rulers took the names of their domains of origin.

Emperor Ku, the High Lord of Xin, was the Yellow Emperor’s great-grandson (the Yellow Emperor’s son, Xuanyao, begot Jiaoji, who begot Ku). Emperor Ku was divinely inspired from birth and declared his own name. He reigned for seventy years (the *Outer Records* records seventy-five years) and established his capital at Yanshi, now Bo Prefecture in Henan. He lived to one hundred and five years (the *Outer Records* records one hundred years).

Emperor Yao of the Taotang clan, the Yellow Emperor’s great-great-grandson and son of Emperor Ku, bore the surname Yiqi and the style Fangxun.

He rose to prominence in Dingtao, where he enfeoffed the Lord of Tang as Emperor. (Dingtao is also called Dingzhou or Taoxian; his capital was at Pingyang, now Jizhou.) He reigned for seventy years (according to the *Book of Documents*, this should be seventy-three years). Another account states that Yao ascended the throne at the age of ten and reigned for seventy years. When he was about to abdicate, he tested Shun for three years before passing the throne to him. After another twenty-eight years, he passed away, making his age one hundred and seventeen. (The *Outer Records* states he reigned for ninety-eight years and lived to one hundred and ninety-eight.)

Emperor Shun of the Youyu clan, a ninth-generation descendant of the Yellow Emperor, bore the surname Shentu (another account says Yao). He acted as regent for thirty years and ruled in his own right for fifty years, living to one hundred and twelve. (The *Outer Records* states he reigned for fifty years and lived to one hundred and ten. The *Records of the Grand Historian* says Shun was sixty-two when he succeeded Yao, reigned for thirty-nine years, and lived to exactly one hundred. Another account states that Shun was summoned to service at thirty, reigned for thirty years—including three years of mourning—and that one of these years was included in the thirty, while the Son of Heaven served for fifty years, making his total lifespan one hundred and ten. His capital was at Puyan, now Hezhong Prefecture.)

Xia Yu, also a great-great-grandson of the Yellow Emperor, bore the surname Si. He reigned as emperor, establishing his capital at Anyi, now Pu Prefecture, and ruled for nine years. His descendants succeeded one another for a total of four hundred and thirty-two years (the *Outer Records* concurs). According to the *Dunjia Lushan Tu*, Yu was a Daoist immortal. In ancient times, there was Yu and Nüwa, nineteen generations apart, who knew fortune and misfortune, life and death, and could weigh the profound and the subtle. They could still the boiling without fire and draw water without a well; their divination was infallible, and they gave birth to the five flavors. Truly, they were divine beings. The Yellow Emperor refined the Nine Cauldrons and ingested the elixir, eventually perfecting the alchemical method and transmitting it to Xuanzǐ. This Way is most sacred, and its transmission requires a covenant of utmost sincerity. The emperor, following the records of the *Central Classic*, concealed it in Mount Jiuyi. To the east, it was called Weiyu, sealed with patterned jade and covered with a massive stone slab. Below the mountain, by the riverside, stands the Great Yu Temple. The *Centuries* states: Sunao of the Youxin clan conceived Yu through a stone, giving birth to him on the sixth day of the sixth month. The people have long observed this day with fasting and offerings.

Tang of Yin, a twentieth-generation descendant of the Yellow Emperor (the Yellow Emperor’s son, Xuanyao, begot Qiaoxuan, who begot Gaoxin, who begot Xie; after ten more generations came Tianyi, who became King Tang of Yin), bore the surname Zi. He reigned as emperor, establishing his capital at Bo, now Bo Prefecture, and ruled for thirteen years. His descendants succeeded one another for a total of six hundred and thirteen years (the *Outer Records* records six hundred and twenty-eight years).

King Wu of Zhou, a twenty-second-generation descendant of the Yellow Emperor, bore the surname Ji (the Yellow Emperor’s grandson, Zhuanxu, took the surname Ji after residing by the Ji River; thus, Gaoxin’s son, Houji, also bore the surname Ji). After sixteen more generations, Fa became King Wu. He reigned for six years, establishing his capital at Haojing, now Yongxing. Later, King Ping moved the capital to Luoyi. His descendants succeeded one another for a total of eight hundred and seventy-two years (the *Outer Records* and chronicles differ, recording nine hundred and twenty-seven years).

The descendants of the Yellow Emperor each received their surnames based on their deeds. The emperor established twelve surnames by pitch-pipes, as previously recorded. His nine sons were each enfeoffed with a state, giving rise to thirty-three clans descended from the Yellow Emperor. The *Pre-Heaven Records* states that his descendants succeeded one another for a total of one thousand five hundred and twenty years (the *Centuries* records one thousand two hundred and fifty years).

Your servant Daoyi remarks: Though Xuanyuan (the Yellow Emperor) humbled himself, he first led seventy-two armies before governing the world with ease. In his time, rulers were enlightened, ministers virtuous, the people honest, and customs simple. Though he possessed the world, he felt no shame in remaining uninformed, and thus both gods and men willingly submitted to him. The people still praise him today, and from this, we may discern the distinctions between emperors, kings, and hegemons in later ages. As the *Dao De Jing* says: "Therefore the sage manages affairs without action and teaches without words. The myriad things arise, yet he does not refuse them; he gives them life, yet claims no possession; he acts, yet does not rely on anything; his work is accomplished, yet he does not dwell in it. It is precisely because he does not dwell in it that it does not leave him." Could this not describe Xuanyuan?

*True Immortals Through the Ages Who Embodied the Dao* (Volume One) concludes.

**Preface to *The Comprehensive Mirror of True Immortals Through the Ages Who Embodied the Dao***

Master Bai Haiqiong says: In the Jin dynasty, Ge Hong composed the *Biographies of Divine Immortals*, recording over a thousand individuals. Master Liu Gang later compiled *Sequel to the Biographies of Immortals*, adding sixteen hundred more. During the Song dynasty, Wang Taichu gathered nine hundred immortals in *Collected Biographies of Immortals*. In the Xuanhe era, after examining ancient and contemporary records, he chronicled fifty thousand immortals in *The History of Immortals*. How flourishing indeed is the teaching of non-action of the Most High!

Whenever I observe those who transcend the mundane—men of purity and lofty virtue, be they filial sons, loyal ministers, chaste women, or steadfast maidens—they all scorn worldly attachments in the realm of clarity and emptiness, directing their minds toward the mysterious and wondrous. Some seek obscurity to conceal their brilliance, while others aspire to rise above the ordinary and ascend to sagehood. Thus, they chew the primordial chaos, grasp the vast undifferentiated, ingest the essence of the sun and moon, and partake in the transformations of heaven and earth. They purify their minds and bathe their natures, nurturing simplicity to preserve their true selves. They delve into the void to establish the foundation of their crucible and explore the subtle to refine the ingredients of their elixir. Lead ascends, mercury descends, relying on water and fire for refinement; the tiger leaps, the dragon soars, depending on yin and yang for mastery. Hence, they are called the Golden Elder and the Maiden, the Yellow Matron and the Venerable Ding—all secret practices of cultivation and esoteric principles of ascending to the mysterious.

The Most High transmitted the teaching, calling it the Golden Elixir. It is passed down only to the worthy, with vows and covenants governing its transmission. At first, one refines essence into qi, qi into spirit, and spirit into union with the Dao, until yin is entirely stripped away, the body transforms into pure yang, and a body exists beyond the body—a transformed immortal fetus.

When the elixir completes its nine revolutions, the method aligns with great perfection. Through the accumulation of three thousand merits in yin cultivation and the fulfillment of eight hundred virtues in conduct, the talismans of the Great One summon them to dwell among the Penglai Isles; the decrees of the Supreme Emperor bid them ascend to the realms of the Great Luo. Those of lesser attainment achieve one of the four forms of liberation through the corpse, or wander as spirits through a hundred transformations. Yet the paths of master and disciple diverge, and practices vary: some chant sutras and mantras, drink sacred water, or swallow talismans; others cultivate visualization, swallow saliva, or ingest qi; some consume herbal medicines, while others refine elixirs from metals and minerals. Though a thousand gates and ten thousand methods exist, all ultimately return to the One Dao—just as every willow-lined path may lead a rider astray, yet every household has a road to Chang’an.

Yet only the internal refinement of the Golden Elixir encompasses all transformations, like following the true path or rivers flowing to the sea. Thus, all who achieve liberation through the corpse or ascension do so by this means. During their cultivation, they forget worldly glory, embrace tranquility, and wear dust-covered faces and tattered robes. Some sleep exposed to the rain, others dine on pine nuts and drink from mountain streams; some blend with the world, while others shun its dust. Scattered in mountains and forests, wandering lakes and seas, resting in grottoes, or traversing the mortal realm—the vulgar and common folk, with their shallow ears and base eyes, whisper to the young and gossip among themselves: *"These are but poor Daoists, beggars and vagabonds."* Those who draw near turn away; those who glance avert their gaze. Few honor them, unlike the high officials who flaunt their jade tablets and the wealthy who cling to their gold. Those who mock and scorn them are legion. Yet when these practitioners, through hidden merit and external cultivation, refine their inner essence, ride clouds and command qi, soar through the void, inscribe their names in the Upper Clarity, and dwell in the Azure Vault—then even the proud bow in reverence, and the gilded and purple-robed gaze in awe.

Alas, what loss or gain does this bring to the Dao? Only our Primordial Heavenly Worthy, in the ancient land of Dafuli, expounded the sutras with the Jeweled Pearl, enlightening all beings and pervading the ten directions. At that time, the Dao permeated the multitudes, its grace suffusing all existence, renewing the kalpas and awakening the true wind. Later, the Most High Lord Lao, the Supreme Dao Lord, continued this profound teaching, perpetuating its transformation. Then our August Heavenly Emperor, through the unfolding of celestial cycles, crystallized the true Dao in emptiness, guiding immortals step by step and nurturing all things. From ancient times to the present, those who ascend in broad daylight or achieve liberation through the corpse have flourished ever more abundantly.

This humble one, though insignificant, has long immersed himself in the study of the mysterious, yearning to transcend the world and wearying of mundane distractions. I have observed that the Confucians have their *Comprehensive Mirror for Aid in Government*, and the Buddhists their *Comprehensive Mirror of the Śākya Clan*, yet our Daoist tradition lacks such a work. The so-called "transmissions" and "histories" of Master Bai Haiqiong are no longer extant. Thus, I have compiled the deeds of immortals and perfected beings from ancient times to the present, examining their practices, discerning right from wrong, and expounding the great Dao to enlighten later generations. With earnest words, I guide them to return to the Most High, adhering to the ultimate truth and eschewing empty rhetoric.

Yet true immortals often conceal themselves, revealing little while hiding much. Of those who leave their names, barely one in a hundred is recorded. Moreover, the records of their comings and goings may vary in sequence, and their transformations defy orderly narration. Thus, this work cannot follow the conventions of secular histories, which arrange events chronologically. For each named immortal who attains the Dao, I have meticulously verified and edited the accounts, refraining from reckless embellishment. My hope is to distinguish between the immortal and the mortal, to honor those who leave their names, and to make my humble intentions known both in the human realm and the heavens—may the perfected beings of ten thousand kalpas bear witness.

I have titled this work *The Comprehensive Mirror of Perfected Immortals Embracing the Dao Through the Ages*. I, Zhao Daoyi, a Daoist of the Everlasting Longevity Palace on Floating Cloud Mountain, respectfully present this preface with incense and bows.

Divergent traditions abound in the transmission of such accounts. Some immortals cunningly conceal their identities, or their names and surnames are lost or altered beyond recognition. For instance, the tradition holds that Zhang Zifang’s master, the Yellow Stone Elder, was in fact Red Pine, who was also the Old Man of the Yi Bridge, who was also the Four Hoary Ones, who were also the Lords of the Eastern Sea, who were also the Valiant Ones. Had people not been deluded, how could a single old man in the wilderness have concealed both himself and a warrior? How could four elders have appeared by the roadside amidst weapons and armor, known to the ruler yet unnoticed by the people? Extending this logic, the Eight Immortals could be old or young, and the Daoist adept could transform in an instant—such manifestations of the will-born body are nothing strange.

Further, as the *True Records* attest, sages, loyal ministers, filial children, scholars, and men of talent across the ages share a single qi, existing through transformation without true death. For heaven and earth are but the body of humanity, just as humanity is the body of heaven and earth. I once sought to emulate Ban Mengjian’s *Tables of Notable Persons*, cataloging those who attained the Dao since the time of the Yellow Emperor. Though some were robust, others frail; some genuine, others false—yet this one became a heavenly immortal, that one an earthly immortal, another dwelt in seclusion, and so on. Some achieved perfection through cultivation, others through elixirs, while others failed or met misfortune. Some are worthy of emulation, others of admiration, caution, or fear. If one cannot find them in their original form, one may find them in their kind. Like Zhao Wenzi, who received instruction upon donning his cap, or the bodhisattvas who simultaneously expounded the Dharma before the Buddha—profound words fill the eyes, and all gates stand open. The benefits are boundless, far beyond merely recording names and deeds.

The venerable Zhao Quanyang, a lofty adept, was able to gather the works of Liu Zixuan, Ge Zhichuan, and others up to recent times. With tireless effort and meticulous care, he inscribed characters as fine as worm-eaten leaves, beyond numbering in the tens of thousands.

Though the accounts transmitted vary in their details, their general purport remains consistent. Through them, I have further come to see that the so-called adepts of the northern lands do not traffic in strange arts or unfathomable techniques, yet remain unattainable in their own right—this is likely the true teaching. There are bookworms who cannot be called wise, yet those who consume the characters of *Immortals* as if feasting on human hair may themselves become immortal by ingesting such hair. Quanyang, in his waking and dreaming, partakes of this immortal feast. Many have done so—not merely in ranks like cicadas—and should one obtain even a single strand, it would suffice to transmit alongside the ancient immortals. With reverence, I inscribe this preface for General Gu’s *Character Illuminations*. Those whose essence has already taken flight need not doubt the words of the man from Wuling; as for me, I have no leisure for such hesitation.

Written by Liu Chenweng of Luling in the fifth month of the jiawu year.

Since ancient times, those who attained immortality were said to have names recorded in celestial and terrestrial registers—charts and histories stored in heavenly realms, earthly mountains, and grotto-palaces, unbound by worldly concerns. The *Scripture of Salvation* states: "At the beginning, the Primordial One preached the Dao amidst the Azure Heavens, and the boundless hosts of perfected great spirits from the ten directions and infinite realms arrived, floating through the void." There are the "Limitless," the "Measureless," and the "Countless Multitudes"—much like the Buddhist sutras’ "three times, ten directions, and sands of the Ganges," or "hundreds of thousands of myriads of nayutas." Inexpressible, inexpressible. If all buddhas and bodhisattvas were to inscribe every name and title on bamboo and silk, it would be impossible to record them all.

Liu Xiang’s *Arrayed Immortals* begins with Red Pine and ends with Xuan Su, yet does not extend to the Yellow Emperor. Ge Hong’s *Immortals* starts with Guangcheng and concludes with Feng Junda, but does not reach the Jin dynasty. Shen Fen’s *Sequel to the Immortals* notes that when people inquire about those who attained immortality, they hear of scarcely one in a thousand. The *True Reports* records Yang Jun’s transcriptions from the underworld’s overseers, who acknowledged only those with official ranks, while the unranked remained largely unknown. Thus, the unrecorded are limitless. In essence, the immortal realm has its registers, just as the human world has its histories. Humans cannot know the immortals, nor do immortals seek renown among men—hence the disparity in their numbers and the variance in their records.

The Daoist of Floating Cloud Mountain, Zhao Quanyang, compiled the *Mirror of Immortals*, meticulously verifying and collating its contents. He may well be called the Dong Hu of the immortal realm. Yet I harbor a doubt: Ge Hong’s account of the Eight Lords of Huainan is grand, and it is understandable that Han histories would conceal it. But Liu Xiang’s father, Liu De, who governed Huainan’s prisons, obtained the *Pillow Book of the Hongbao* and marveled at its wonders. Why, then, did Liu Xiang omit the Eight Lords from his *Arrayed Immortals*? In the Jiang region, traditions about Jingyang are modest, yet dazzling to the eye. Yet when examining the *True Reports*, which records the genealogy and names of the Xu family’s perfected ones—from their eldest to youngest, from the Minister of Education to the Tiger General and Jade Axe—there is not a single mention of Jingyang. The *True Reports* was composed during the Liang dynasty, not long after the Eastern Jin, and should not suffer from historical omissions. This is truly strange.

In Quanyang’s records, the deeds of Liu An and the Grand Scribe Xu stand alongside those in the *Arrayed Immortals* and *True Reports*. Is there not cause for doubt? If the perfected sages of the celestial realms already hold positions in the scriptural canons, then including them in the *Mirror of Immortals* might seem like a mere fraction of the whole. To enumerate each would be impossible. Quanyang, in your editing, I urge you to reconsider this matter. May you meet with good fortune.

Written by Deng Guangjian, the Recluse of Jianzhong Studio, in the third month of the year at Benyi Hermitage.

I once saw that the Confucians had ritual texts for the Master, but the historian of Siming rebuked them, saying: "To exalt him is to diminish him." This is why Master Zhu of Kao-t’ing, at White Deer Grotto, preferred not to sculpt the Master’s image, setting out only a ritual tablet during sacrifices. Yet no one has ever questioned the Master’s lineage—this is why the Elder of Zhizhai, upon reviewing the *Veritable Records*, was moved to lament for the Confucian teaching.

The Daoist of Floating Cloud Mountain, Zhao Quanyang, in compiling the *Mirror of Immortals*, has accomplished what others could not. I venture to ask: Is the Master not the sovereign of the vast mulberry fields beyond the seas? This is recorded in Han Kuang’s biography and listed in the ranks of the Golden Register’s ritual positions. Why, then, have you omitted him? Is it that the immortals you have included are like the three thousand disciples of Confucius’ gate, while the Master’s exalted status remains beyond the reach of your words? Alas! In every mote of dust, in every realm, the Jade Emperor’s body is wholly reflected within the boundless bright mirror. Let these words serve as your eulogy.

**Memorial:**
Your Daoist servant ventures to say: The Great Dao is non-action, existing before the beginning of heaven and earth. The true immortals transmit their teachings, uniting past and present in a single day. From the Three Sovereigns onward, generations stretch into the distant past, governed by knotted cords, without written records to consult. Only with Fuxi did written characters begin, and later ages followed his example. Yet as the years multiplied, bamboo slips decayed, and the affairs of high antiquity became scarcely one-tenth known to later generations. The degeneration of human hearts is deeply lamentable.

Fortunately, the incarnations of the Most High have appeared across the ages to expound the teachings. Thus, even in an era of declining customs, the wind of returning to purity and simplicity endures. Is this not magnificent?

Your Daoist servant, with utmost reverence and trepidation, bows his head and knocks his forehead to the ground, honoring the Most High, the Jade Emperor of the Golden Gates of the Azure Heavens, whose true constancy is profound and still, whose wisdom is wondrous and complete. He is the teacher and lord of the Three Realms, the supreme model of the ten directions, eternally propagating the perfect Dao and boundlessly delivering beings.

Though I am foolish and ignorant, I have gathered from the scriptures and traditions the verifiable deeds of the highest sages and true immortals, compiling them into the *Comprehensive Mirror of True Immortals Through the Ages*. Through it, I seek to publicly evaluate the Dao and virtue, to reveal the models of immortals and sages, to manifest the true lineage, to praise the great transformation, to illuminate the enlightened ancestors, and to admonish future generations.

Yet true immortals dwelling in the world often conceal their radiance and hide their forms, their distant transformations beyond reckoning. Of those who leave their names in records, scarcely one in a hundred is known. Permit me, with my humble and shallow understanding, to present this to Your Majesty.

Consider the realms of the Three Clarities, the heavens of the ten directions, the divine mountains upon the seas, the Five Marchmounts beyond the seas, the Celestial Perfected and Supreme Thearchs, the Perfected Persons and Divine Kings—majestic as thunder, companionable as stars—each with their appointed offices. And as the *Scripture of Salvation* declares, the boundless and immeasurable hosts of the Most Perfect and Great Spirits of the ten directions are beyond enumeration, far exceeding what mortal realms can fully recount. Here, I rely upon the true scriptures as my source.

First, I list the exalted Perfected and Supreme Sages in several ranks to establish the framework. Next, I record the several dozen who attained the name of true immortals in the eras of the Three Sovereigns—Fuxi, Shennong, and the Yellow Emperor—to reveal the origins of communion between heaven and humanity. From the Three Sovereigns onward, though the lineage of true immortals has been transmitted in unbroken succession, most have remained reclusive, eschewing written records, their voices but faintly heard among mortals. From the Five Emperors and the Three Dynasties, nearly a hundred have left their names in the world, yet even these cannot exhaust the details of their appearances and transformations.

By the Yin and Zhou dynasties, the Most High again descended in incarnate form, and the great Dao flourished. Thus, from the Qin and Han through the Three Kingdoms, Jin, Northern and Southern Dynasties, Sui, Tang, Five Dynasties, and Song, the transmission of teachings and establishment of precepts reached their zenith. Yet within grotto-heavens and blessed lands, in courtly halls and rustic retreats, some harmonized their light with the dust of the world, while others concealed their forms and withdrew from the fray. What records cannot fully capture, what eyes and ears cannot universally perceive—of these, only a few thousand true immortals have left their names in the world.

Beyond these, there are the encounters of mortals: some witness flying immortals descending, others divine immortals at play, their names hidden, their traces fleeting and distant—most of which escape the written word. What I have compiled here are only those true immortals whose personal conduct and practices have entered the realm of human perception.

Yet spanning ancient and modern times, how could this compilation be without errors? I, of dull and ordinary endowment, how could my account be without faults? I humbly beseech Your Majesty to discern its subtle points, to consider my earnest devotion, and to deign to peruse it. Thereafter, may it be disseminated among mortals to serve as a mirror and admonition for future seekers of true immortality. This is the deepest wish of my humble self.

Daring to offend Your Celestial Majesty’s awe-inspiring dignity, I tremble with fear. Thus, I have compiled the *Comprehensive Mirror of True Immortals Through the Ages* and now reverently submit this memorial for Your Majesty’s consideration.

With utmost reverence and trepidation, I bow my head and knock my forehead to the ground.

Respectfully submitted by the humble Daoist disciple Zhao Daoyi, of the Lesser Luminaries, from the Abbey of Myriad Years on Floating Cloud Mountain.

*Comprehensive Mirror of True Immortals Through the Ages*, Scroll Two
The Perfected Master of the Dao of Pervasive Mystery

The Perfected Master of the Dao of Pervasive Mystery bore the title Grand Master of the Mystery Within. During the era of Heavenly Sovereign Fuxi, he revealed the *Twelve Scrolls of the Cavern of Perfection*, imparting the Great Dao of the Limitless to inquire among humankind.

The Ancient Grand Master
The Ancient Grand Master, during the era of Earthly Sovereign Shennong, revealed the *Twelve Scrolls of the Cavern of Mystery*, transforming people through the Supreme Dao of Orthodox Perfection.

Master Pangu
Master Pangu, during the era of Human Sovereign Suiren, revealed the *Twelve Scrolls of the Cavern of Divinity*, transforming people through the Dao of Great Peace and Non-Action.

Yu Hua Zi
Yu Hua Zi descended to the fields during the reign of Fuxi, bestowing the *Inner Writ of the Heavenly Sovereign*. He also transmitted the *River Chart* and the *Eight Trigrams*, teaching people the Dao of Following One’s Nature. He was also known as Wan Hua and styled himself the Master of the Fields, composing the *Thirty-Four Scrolls of the Primordial Yang*.

Guang Shou Zi
Guang Shou Zi descended upon Mount Heng during the reign of Zhu Rong, bestowing the *Inner Writ of the Human Sovereign* and teaching the Dao of Calming the Spirit. He instructed people in the craft of molding vessels to refine and transform life. He was also known as Chuan Yu Zi and composed the *Ninety Scrolls of the Comprehensive Classic of Massage and Essence*.

Da Cheng Zi
Da Cheng Zi, also known as Chuan Yu Zi, descended upon Jiyin during the reign of Shennong, bestowing the *Inner Writ of the Earthly Sovereign* and teaching the Dao of Cherishing Life. He instructed people to cultivate grains and fruits to replace the cooking and slaughter of animals, and to harmonize medicinal recipes to heal illnesses and nurture nature. It is also said that he composed the *Thirty-Six Scrolls of the Primordial Essence of the Great One*.

Guang Cheng Zi
Guang Cheng Zi dwelled in a stone chamber on Mount Kongtong. The Yellow Emperor, having heard of him, went to visit and said: "I venture to ask the essentials of the Supreme Dao." Guang Cheng Zi replied: "You govern the world, yet clouds do not wait to gather before raining, and trees do not wait to yellow before falling. How can one speak to you of the Supreme Dao?" The Yellow Emperor withdrew and lived in seclusion. After three months, he returned to see him, advancing on his knees, bowing twice, and inquiring about the Dao of governing the body. Guang Cheng Zi answered: "The essence of the Supreme Dao is profound and obscure. The ultimate of the Supreme Dao is dark and silent. See nothing, hear nothing, embrace the spirit in stillness, and the body will naturally align. Be still, be pure; do not labor your form, do not disturb your essence, and you may attain longevity. Guard within, close without; excessive knowledge leads to ruin. I preserve the One and abide in harmony, thus I have lived for one thousand two hundred years without aging. Those who attain my Dao ascend to become sovereigns; those who lose it descend to become dust. I shall depart from you, entering the boundless, roaming the limitless wilds, sharing radiance with the sun and moon, and enduring with heaven and earth. Mortals will all perish, yet I alone shall endure." Thereupon, he bestowed upon the Emperor the *Classic of Yin and Yang*. The *Annals of the Yellow Emperor* state that he bestowed the *Classic of Spontaneity*. He was also known as Li Mo Zi and composed the *Seventy Scrolls of the Classic of Dao Attainment*.

This humble Daoist, Zhao Daoyi, observes: Guang Cheng Zi said, "I preserve the One and abide in harmony, thus I have lived for one thousand two hundred years without aging." The *Classic of the Dao and Virtue* states: "Of old, those who attained the One: Heaven attained the One and became clear; Earth attained the One and became tranquil; spirits attained the One and became numinous; valleys attained the One and became full; the myriad things attained the One and came to life; lords and kings attained the One and became the standard for all under heaven." This is likely what he meant. Guang Cheng Zi’s intent was for the Yellow Emperor to embrace the One as the model for all under heaven. Later, the Yellow Emperor attained the Dao and ascended to heaven in broad daylight. Subsequent emperors and kings were ultimately unable to match him—how wondrous was Guang Cheng Zi’s achievement!

Sui Ying Zi
Sui Ying Zi, also known as the Master of the Great Ultimate, descended upon Mount Kongtong during the reign of Shaohao and expounded the *Classic of Solemn Respect*, teaching the Dao of following the seasons and enacting decrees.

Chi Jing Zi
Chi Jing Zi, during the reign of Zhuanxu, expounded the *Classic of Subtle Words*, teaching the Dao of loyalty and obedience. The *Comprehensive Collection of the Southern Marchmount* states: "On Lotus Peak, there remains a platform for transmitting scriptures. During the Xianhe era of the Jin dynasty, several youths were seen on the southern slope of the mountain, playing with a flock of white cranes."

Lu Tu Zi
Lu Tu Zi descended upon the banks of the Yangtze during the reign of Emperor Ku and expounded the *Classic of the Yellow Court*, teaching the Dao of purity and harmony. He commanded the Perfected Lords of the Nine Heavens and the Perfected August Ones of the Three Heavens to hold the Eight Radiant Tallies and the Tallies of Auspicious Clouds, descending to the Terrace of Pastoral Virtue to bestow upon Emperor Ku the numinous treasures of the Nine Heavens and the precious talismans of the Three Heavens. Above, these served heaven’s mandate, ensuring the two forces suffered no loss; below, they nurtured the people, ensuring their years and lives suffered no decline. The Emperor then performed a sacrifice to heaven at the altar of the Northern River and concealed the talismans upon the peak of Mount Zhong. Later, he ascended to heaven as a Perfected One of the Mysterious Palace. At that time, Lu Tu Zi transmitted the Dao to Red Pine Master, Clothed-in-Robes Master, Wang Ni, and Nie Que. It is also said that he composed the *Fifty Scrolls of the Classic of the Yellow Court*.

Wu Cheng Zi
Wu Cheng Zi descended upon Mount Gushe during the reign of Emperor Yao and expounded the *Classic of Mysterious Virtue*, teaching the Dao of humility and modesty. It is also said that he composed the *Forty Scrolls of the Classic of Governance and Transformation*.

Yin Shou Zi
Yin Shou Zi descended upon Heyang during the reign of Emperor Shun and expounded the *Classic of the Dao and Virtue*, teaching the Dao of Non-Action. He also transmitted the Dao to Peng Zu. It is also said that he composed the *Seventy Scrolls of the Classic of the Perfected One of Pervasive Mystery* and the *One Thousand Two Hundred Scrolls of the Classic of the Dao and Virtue*.

Zhen Xing Zi
Zhen Xing Zi, also known as Yu Zhen Zi, descended upon Mount Shang during the reign of Yu the Great, teaching the Dao of diligence and frugality. He bestowed the *Nine Categories of Writings* and commanded the divine envoy Xuan Yi of Wanwei to present Yu with the *Five Numinous Talismans of the Jade Writs*, the *True Writs for Governing Floods*, and the methods for pacing the stars, summoning spirits, and exorcising demons. The Grotto-Heaven of Supreme Joy and Lawful Music on Jade Bamboo Mountain was the very place where Yu received the *True Writs of the Numinous Treasure*. Its traces remain to this day. The Grotto-Heaven of the Forest Chamber on Dongting Mountain in Lake Tai is where Yu concealed the true writs. It is also called Baoshan. In the twelfth year of King Helü of Wu, in the first month, he ascended Baoshan and commanded the diver Long Wei to enter the grotto of Baoshan to explore its depths. There, he saw a golden city and jade halls, inscribed with the words: "The Separate Palace of the Queen of Heaven, the Hall of Great Yin."

Upon the jade table within the chamber, he obtained a scroll of the *Plain Book*, comprising one hundred and seventy-four characters, and then returned. King Helü, unable to decipher the script, dispatched an envoy to inquire of Confucius. A red crow then delivered a written text to the king.

Confucius said: "Once, while I traveled by the Western Sea, I heard a children’s rhyme that went: *'The King of Wu sets forth to view the trembling lake, / Long Wei the Elder, by name, in seclusion dwells. / North to Baoshan he ascends, entering the numinous void, / To Dongting’s depths he steals the writs of Yu. / The Heavenly Emperor’s great texts must not be unfurled, / This script shall long transmit the hundred-sixth cycle’s doom. / Now forcibly taken, it shall bring ruin to the royal house.'* I have examined the rhyme and conclude that Long Wei the Elder obtained it within the grotto, and the red crow bore it here—beyond my knowledge."

The King of Wu, struck with fear, returned the book.

Another account states: During the time of Yu the Great, he emerged as a master named Jizi Qing, composing the *Scripture of Primordial Beginning* in forty-six scrolls, the *Scripture of Wondrous Joy* in seventy scrolls, and the *Scripture of Virtue and Admonitions* in thirty scrolls.

**Xi Zezi**
Xi Zezi descended upon Jian Mountain during the Shang era, expounding the *Scripture of Longevity* and teaching the Way of reverence and compassion. The site of the Dragon Hall before the Heavenly Blessing Palace on Mount Qian is the very place where he dwelled. He was also called Xishouzi, or Jiezi Qing, and authored the *Scripture of the Dao’s Origin* in seventy scrolls.

**Xie Yizi**
Xie Yizi, also known as Chijingzi, descended upon the southern slopes of Mount Qi, expounding the *Scripture of the Red Essence* and teaching the Way of benevolence and trustworthiness. When King Wen of the Zhou heard of him, he summoned him to serve as Archivist.

**Yuchengzi**
Yuchengzi, upon King Wu of Zhou’s conquest of Shang and ascension to the throne, was promoted from Archivist to Pillar Historian. He composed the *Scripture of the Wandering Mechanism*.

Another account states: During the reign of King Wu of Zhou, he emerged as a master named Guoshuzi, also called Xuchengzi or Tianlaogong, and was further known as Lao Jun. At times appearing as an ordinary man, at others as Pillar Historian, he composed the *Scripture of Longevity* in thirty scrolls and presented it to the king.

**Jingchengzi**
Jingchengzi, serving as Pillar Historian during the reign of King Cheng of Zhou, expounded the *Scripture of Vast Transformation* and transmitted its teachings on the Dao to the Duke of Zhou. He later retired to a life of leisure and journeyed to the western lands of Da Qin, Jambudvipa, and other realms, where he was known as the Ancient Master.

**Guoshuzi**
Guoshuzi served as Pillar Historian during the reign of King Kang of Zhou.

*Comprehensive Mirror of Perfected Immortals Embodying the Dao, Scroll the Third*

**Chisongzi**
Chisongzi served as the Rain Master during the reign of Shennong. He consumed water jade to instruct Shennong and could enter fire to immolate himself. He journeyed to Mount Kunlun, where he often resided in the stone chamber of the Queen Mother of the West, ascending and descending with the winds and rains. The youngest daughter of the Flame Emperor pursued him and, attaining immortality, departed with him. By the time of Gao Xin, he again served as Rain Master—today’s Rain Master traces his lineage to him.

The *Record of the Cinnabar Terrace* states: He became the Immortal Earl of Kunlin, governing the Southern Marchmount. The *Baopuzi* records: Chisongzi soaked jade in dark wormwood blood to create water, which he consumed, enabling him to ride the mist and ascend or descend at will. Ingesting jade fragments or drinking jade-infused water both confer immortality.

**Nanfengzi**
Nanfengzi lived during the time of the Yellow Emperor and was traditionally regarded as the Yellow Emperor’s Pottery Master. A traveler passing by assisted him in tending the fire and could produce five-colored smoke. Over time, he taught this art to Nanfengzi. Nanfengzi then immolated himself in the accumulated fire, ascending and descending with the smoke. When his ashes were examined, his bones remained intact. The people of that era buried him together in the northern mountains of Yu, hence he was called Nanfengzi.

Master Nanfeng resided in the northern cliffs of Mount Qingcheng in Shu. The Yellow Emperor became his disciple and inquired about the Dao of the Three Ones. The master replied: "I have heard that the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign, having endured the kalpas of the Most High, now dwells near Mount Emei. He has attained the source of the Three Ones—you may seek him as your teacher." Thereupon, he transmitted the *Scripture of the Dragon’s Pace* to the Yellow Emperor. After receiving it, the Yellow Emperor could ride cloud-dragons to traverse the eight directions. He then erected an altar atop the mountain and honored the Treasure Lord as the Perfected of the Five Marchmounts. He commanded the spirits of the rivers and mountains to receive their duties at the Pure Capital. Later, he entered the northern cliffs of Mount Emei to receive the Dao of the Three Ones from the Sovereign. His chariot tracks encircled the seas and mountains, and they remain to this day.

It is also said: "The Yellow Emperor enfeoffed Lord Yu as the master of the Five Marchmounts, overseeing the mountain spirits. Here, he regulated the water clock with flowing water, establishing the Six Seasonal Waters. During yin hours, the water scatters like mist; during yang hours, it ceases."

**Ma Shihuang**
Ma Shihuang was the equine physician of the Yellow Emperor. He understood the diagnosis of horses’ forms, qi, life, and death, and could cure them without fail. Later, a dragon descended before him, drooping its ears and gaping its mouth. Shihuang said: "This dragon is ill and knows I can heal it." He then stitched its lower lip to its mouth and administered a licorice decoction, restoring it to health. Thereafter, whenever ailing dragons emerged from the marsh, they would seek him out for treatment. One day, a dragon bore him away.

**Chijiang Ziyu**
Chijiang Ziyu lived during the time of the Yellow Emperor.

Chijiang Ziyu consumed no grains, subsisting solely on the blossoms of a hundred herbs. In the time of Yao, he served as Minister of Wood, able to ascend and descend with the wind and rain. At times, he traded arrows in the marketplace, earning the name "Father of Arrows."

**Woquan**
Woquan was a gatherer of herbs on Mount Huai. Fond of eating pine seeds, his body grew hair several inches long, and his eyes became square. He could fly and outrun galloping horses. He once presented pine seeds to Yao, who had no leisure to consume them. Those among Yao’s people who did ingest them lived to two or three hundred years.

**Fanghui**
Fanghui was a recluse in Yao’s time. Yao summoned him as a scholar of leisure, whereupon he refined mica powder and stone, administering them to the ailing populace. Later, he concealed himself in the Five Oaks Mountain. In the final years of Xia Qi, he served as an official but was seized by bandits and imprisoned in a chamber, from which he sought the Dao. He transformed and escaped, sealing the door with his seal. People of the time said that applying a single round of his clay to a door rendered it unopenable.

**Qian Keng**
Qian Keng was a great-great-grandson of Emperor Zhuanxu. He presented pheasant broth to Yao, who enfeoffed him at Pengcheng, later known as Pengzu. He had two sons: the elder named Wu, the younger named Yi. The mountain where he concealed himself was later named Wuyi Mountain. One account states that Yin Shouzi transmitted the Dao to Pengzu during the time of Yu Shun, while another identifies Qian Keng as Pengzu himself.

He practiced Daoist breathing exercises and guided qi; when ill, he would hold his breath to attack the affliction, circulating it through his body until it reached his fingertips, restoring him to normal. It was said: "A superior adept sleeps on a separate bed, a middling adept under a separate cover—yet consuming a hundred packets of medicine is not as good as sleeping alone." People compiled his techniques into *The Pengzu Classic*.

*The Arrayed Transmissions of Immortals* states: Pengzu lived from the Xia to the end of the Yin dynasty, over eight hundred years. He regularly ate cassia bark and excelled at guiding qi and circulating breath. In Liyang stood Pengzu’s immortal chamber; prayers offered there were answered without fail by wind and rain. Two tigers always lingered by the shrine, and after rituals, tigers would appear nearby. It was said he later ascended as an immortal and departed.

Another account claims Keng concealed himself in the mountains, weaving bamboo into a door and eating pine seeds as sustenance. He could ride the wind and command qi, leaping into the void. By the end of the Yin dynasty, he had already lived over seven hundred years, and after seven hundred seventy-seven years, he dissolved and transformed.

Zhao Cigong said: The county of Pengcheng in Xuzhou derived its name from Pengzu.

According to *Comprehensive Records of the World*: Pengzu, a worthy minister of the Yin dynasty and great-great-grandson of Zhuanxu, lived to seven hundred sixty-seven years by the end of Yin. His ancient tomb lies north of the former capital, now called Dapeng.

*The Records of Eminent Worthies of Mount Lu* states: Peng Keng once passed by the shores of Pengli, where he visited the renowned mountain—now Mount Lu. He traversed its grottoes to glimpse the sacred traces, then fished upon a terrace. Two carp transformed into twin dragons and soared into the heavens. Some say the Fishing Terrace by the riverbank was Pengzu’s legacy.

**Xiaofu**
Xiaofu was a man of Jizhou who, in his youth, mended shoes in the Western Zhou marketplace for decades without anyone recognizing him.

Later, when people marveled at his agelessness, the curious sought his methods of preservation, but none succeeded—only Liangmu obtained his technique for kindling fire. As he prepared to ascend Sanliang Mountain, he bade farewell to Liangmu, arranging dozens of fires before ascending to heaven. The people of the western village have since revered and worshipped him.

**Shimen**
Shimen was a disciple of Xiaofu. He, too, could command fire and fed upon the blossoms of peach and plum trees. He served as the Dragon Master for Xia Kongjia, but when Kongjia failed to comply with his wishes, he was killed and buried in the wilderness. The next day, wind and rain came to receive him, and when it ceased, the mountain’s trees were all consumed by fire. Kongjia, filled with remorse, offered sacrifices and prayers, yet upon his return, he died upon the road.

According to Liu Shu’s *Supplementary Records to the Comprehensive Mirror*, Kongjia was fond of ghostly and divine matters but neglected the cultivation of virtue, leading many feudal lords to rebel. At that time, heaven sent down a pair of dragons, male and female, which Kongjia could not feed and thus failed to obtain. After the decline of the Dragon-Taming Clan of the Taotang lineage, there emerged Liu Lei, who studied dragon-taming under the clan and served Kongjia, able to feed the dragons. The Xia ruler praised him and granted him the clan name Yulong, replacing the descendants of Shihwei. When one of the female dragons died, Liu Lei secretly stewed it and served it to the Xia ruler. The ruler enjoyed it but later demanded the dragon be returned. Fearing punishment, Liu Lei fled to Luzhou.

From the perspective of Daoist unity, Liu Lei may well have been Shimen, though this remains uncertain. Thus, it is noted here for future scholars to discuss.

Minister Dao Yi remarks: Shimen attained the Dao and served the Xia dynasty, only to encounter the misfortune of its ruler. Kongjia first killed and buried him, then later, moved by remorse, offered sacrifices—yet he still died upon his return. This mirrors Sun Ce’s slaying of Gan Ji, which led to his own fatal wounding, or Yao Chang’s execution of Wang Jia, which preceded his downfall. Yet Wang Jia later appeared in Longyou, and Gan Ji reappeared in a mirror. Shimen, too, was received by wind and rain—what harm did this bring to his Dao? Those who rule must take heed: if they honored the virtuous and delighted in scholars, could such calamities ever occur?

The *Dao De Jing* states: "Why would a ruler of ten thousand chariots treat his person as insignificant before the world? Such frivolity loses ministers, and such impatience loses the throne." This is precisely the case.

Wu Guang—Wu Guang in the *Zhuangzi* is written as *Piè*—was a man of the Xia dynasty. His ears measured seven inches; he loved the zither and subsisted on cattail roots and wild leeks. When Tang of Shang launched his campaign against Jie, he consulted Guang, who replied: "This is not my concern." Tang asked: "Who, then, is suitable?" Guang said: "I do not know." Tang pressed: "What of Yi Yin?" Guang answered: "He is strong and enduring, patient with disgrace—but I know nothing beyond that."

After Tang conquered Jie, he offered the realm to Guang, saying: "The wise devise strategy, the martial execute it, and the benevolent occupy the throne—this is the Way of antiquity. Why do you not take it? I will serve as your minister." Guang declined: "To depose a sovereign is unrighteous; to kill men is inhumane. Others bear the hardship while I reap the reward—this is unprincipled. I have heard that one who acts without righteousness does not accept its emoluments, nor does one tread the path of office in a lawless age. To be exalted above me is something I cannot endure." Thereupon, he carried a stone and drowned himself in the Liao River—the *Zhuangzi* calls it the Lu River, while Sima [Qian] writes it as the Lu River, located on the western border of Liaodong. Another account places it within the bounds of Beiping Prefecture. Thereafter, he concealed himself.

Four years later, during the reign of Wu Ding, he reappeared. Wu Ding wished to appoint him as chief minister, but he refused. Wu Ding had him conveyed by carriage and pressed him to comply, disregarding propriety. Thereupon, he cast himself into the river at Mount Fu, later wandering to Mount Shangfu.

One account of the ministerial Way states: After the Great Simplicity had dispersed, there came Tang’s punitive expedition, the Battle of Mingtiao. Had no Perfected One of the Dao emerged in that interval, the fundamental norms would have dissolved a thousand years hence. By reproving Tang’s transgressions, Wu Guang made clear the distinction between ruler and minister. Even at the threshold of life and death, he did not alter his resolve. Herein lies the very foundation of the enduring standard of loyalty and righteousness for ten thousand generations. Later, at the gathering at Meng Ford, Bo Yi and Shu Qi remonstrated by seizing the bridle, and starved to death on Mount Shouyang—was this not rooted in Guang’s Way?

The *Daodejing* says: “In a state of darkness and disorder, there are loyal ministers.” I would add: Though it is misfortune to have darkness and disorder, it is also fortune to have loyal ministers.

Qiu Sheng
Qiu Sheng, of unknown origin, served as Minister of Wood under Tang for over thirty years, yet grew only more vigorous. All knew him to be a man of longevity and revered him as their teacher. He was said to subsist on pine resin and to have built his own stone chamber on a northern mountain in his homeland, where sacrifices were offered to him.

Master Rongcheng

Master Rongcheng

Master Rongcheng claimed to have been the teacher of the Yellow Emperor and was received by King Mu of Zhou. Skilled in the arts of supplementation and guidance, he refined his essence within the Mysterious Female. His essential teaching was that the Spirit of the Valley never dies—preserving life, nurturing qi, turning white hair black again, and making fallen teeth regrow—practices akin to those of Laozi. Some also say that Laozi took him as his teacher.

There are those who claim that Master Rongcheng attained the art of sexual cultivation, holding firm without emission to return essence and replenish the brain. This account is not accepted here, for it is but a later misguided transmission.

Your servant Dao Yi says: The *Daodejing* states, “The Spirit of the Valley never dies—this is called the Mysterious Female. The gate of the Mysterious Female is called the root of Heaven and Earth. Subtle and seemingly present, its use is never exhausted.” Those who attain this Way ascend to become immortals; those who lose it descend to become ghosts. Master Rongcheng grasped this Way, the gateway to all marvels. Later generations, failing to attain the true Way, strayed onto side paths and crooked trails, clinging to mere branches. Some even pushed to extremes, fabricating the art of sexual cultivation and falsely attributing it to Master Rongcheng—this is a grave error.

Lü Shang

Lü Shang was a native of Jizhou.

Born with innate wisdom, he foresaw survival and ruin. To escape the chaos of King Zhou, he concealed himself in Liaodong for forty years. Later journeying west to Zhou, he hid in the Southern Mountains, fishing at Pan Stream for three years without catching a single fish. Those around him all said, “You should give up.” Shang replied, “This is not something within your understanding.” Soon after, he indeed found a military tally within a fish’s belly. King Wen dreamed of encountering a sage; upon hearing of Shang, he carried him back in his chariot. When King Wu of Zhou launched his campaign against Zhou, Shang composed over a hundred treatises on covert strategy. He consumed *zechi* mushrooms and earth marrow. Though he lived for two hundred years before announcing his death, he faced calamity and was not buried. Later, his son Ji interred him, but no corpse was found—only six scrolls of *The Jade Tally*, totaling ten thousand characters, remained in the coffin.

**Ge You**

Ge You was a Qiang tribesman. During the reign of King Cheng of Zhou, he enjoyed carving wooden sheep to sell. One day, he rode a sheep into Shu, and the kings, marquises, and nobles of Shu pursued him up Sui Mountain. Sui Mountain lies southwest of Mount Emei, its height boundless; those who followed him never returned, all attaining the Dao of immortality. Thus, a local saying goes: “If you obtain a single peach from Sui Mountain, even if you do not become immortal, you will live with pride.”

**Fan Li**

Fan Li, styled Shaobo, was a native of Xu. He served the Zhou court and studied under Grand Duke Wang. Fond of consuming cassia and drinking water, he became a minister of Yue and assisted Goujian in defeating Wu. Later, he boarded a light boat and entered the sea, changing his name and surname before settling in Qi as Yazi Zi. Over a hundred years later, he appeared in Tao, becoming the Lord of Tao Zhu, amassing wealth of hundreds of millions. Known as Tao Zhu Gong, he later abandoned it all to sell medicine in the marketplace. Subsequent generations continued to recognize and encounter him.

Li Yuanying recorded that Fan Li studied the Dao on Mount Liyuan, which belongs to Pengzhou. *The Record of Twenty-Four Transformations* states that Fan Li attained immortality on Mount Beiyu.

**Na Liu**

Na Shu was a scribe enfeoffed by the Zhou court.

Skilled in circulating qi and refining his form, he boiled stone marrow and consumed it, calling it stalactite, for several hundred years. He came and went within Mount Tai Shi, where a reclining stone served as his pillow.

Jiezi Tui
Jiezi Tui, surnamed Wang and named Guang—though he had no given name—delighted in Zhao Xuanzi and accompanied him. A man of Jin, he once saw a yellow sparrow perched at his gate, which Duke Chong’er of Jin found strange. Together they lived abroad for over a decade, enduring hardship without complaint. When they returned to Mount Jie, Bozi Zhen came at dawn and called to Tui, saying, "You may depart now." Tui declined, and with his mother entered the mountains, following Bozi in his wanderings. Later, Duke Wen sent thousands with jade and silk to honor him, but he did not emerge. Thirty years afterward, he appeared on the shores of the Eastern Sea, selling fans as Wang Su. Decades later, none knew his whereabouts.

Juanzǐ
Juanzǐ was a man of Qi. Fond of consuming wood, he absorbed its essence as sustenance, and after three hundred years appeared in Qi. He composed *The Classic of Heaven, Earth, and Humanity* in forty-eight scrolls. Later, while fishing in the rivers and marshes, he found a talisman within a carp’s belly. He concealed himself on Mount Yan, where he could command wind and rain. He received the Nine Immortal Methods from Boyang, though Prince An of Huainan obtained only fragments of his writings and could not grasp their meaning. His *Three Scrolls of the Zither’s Heart* were well-ordered.

Ma Dan
Ma Dan was a Di man of Jin.

At the time of Marquis Wen, he served as a grandee, and by the reign of Duke Xian, he was again appointed as Minister of the Curtain. When Duke Xian annihilated the Di and killed the Reverent Crown Prince, Dan departed. By the era of Zhao Xuanzi, he rode a carriage of peace into the Jin capital and awaited the grandees. Duke Ling wished to employ him, but pressed him without propriety, whereupon a swift wind arose, and Dan entered the whirlwind and vanished. The people of the north revered him and offered sacrifices in his honor.

Ping Changsheng
Ping Changsheng of Gucheng—his origins are unknown. He died and revived many times, which people of the time found unbelievable. Later, when great floods surged forth, wreaking widespread devastation, Ping stood atop the summit of Quemen Mountain and cried out, declaring, “Ping Changsheng is here!” He foretold that the rain and floodwaters would cease in five days. When they did, the people ascended the mountain to seek him and offer sacrifices, but all they found were Ping’s garments, leather belt, and sandals. Decades later, he reappeared as a gatekeeper at Huayin.

Lu Tong
Lu Tong, known as Jieyu the Madman of Chu (alternatively written as *Yu*, pronounced similarly to *remainder*), was fond of nurturing life. He consumed the fruit of the *nanglu* tree and the seeds of turnips. He wandered among famous mountains, and on Mount Emei in Shu, people saw him generation after generation. When Confucius traveled to Chu, Jieyu the Madman of Chu passed by his gate and sang:

“O phoenix, O phoenix,
How the Dao’s virtue has declined!
The age to come cannot be awaited,
The age gone by cannot be pursued.
When the world follows the Way,
The sage achieves;
When the world loses the Way,
The sage survives.
In this present time,
One barely escapes punishment.
Fortune is lighter than a feather,
Yet none know how to bear it;
Disaster is heavier than the earth,
Yet none know how to avoid it.
Enough, enough—
Approach others with virtue!
Perilous, perilous—
Mark the ground and hasten away!
Beware, beware,
Do not harm my path!
My path winds and turns,
Do not harm my feet!
Mountain trees bring ruin upon themselves,
Lamp oil consumes itself in flame.
Cinnamon is edible, so it is felled;
Lacquer is useful, so it is slashed.
All know the use of what is useful,
But none know the use of what is useless.”

Jianwu encountered the Madman Jieyu, who asked, “Zhongshi of the Sun, what would you have me tell you?” Jianwu replied, “He told me that a ruler of men, by issuing his own standards, models, principles, and measures, could make all obey and transform. Who would dare not listen?” The Madman Jieyu said, “This is deceitful virtue. In governing the world, it is like crossing the sea by digging a river or making a mosquito carry a mountain. The governance of the sage attends first to rectifying what is external and only then proceeds, ensuring that each matter is handled by one capable of it. Moreover, the high-flying bird avoids the harm of nets and arrows, while the mole digs deep beneath the sacred mound to escape the calamity of heavy digging. Yet these two creatures are deemed ignorant!”

Jianwu asked Lian Shu, “I heard Jieyu’s words—grand but without foundation, sweeping but unattainable. I was startled and terrified by his speech, which seemed as boundless as the Milky Way, vast and divergent, far from human sentiment.” Lian Shu asked, “What did he say?” Jianwu replied, “On the distant Mount Gushe, a spirit-person dwells. Their skin is like ice and snow, their grace like that of a maiden. They do not eat the five grains but inhale the wind and drink the dew. They ride the clouds and qi, mount flying dragons, and roam beyond the four seas. Their spirit is concentrated, causing things to be free of blight and the yearly harvests to ripen. I consider this mad and do not believe it.”

Lian Shu replied, “Indeed. The blind cannot partake in the spectacle of patterns and colors; the deaf cannot share in the sound of bells and drums. Is this not because their bodily forms are deaf and blind? Yet his words are but the folly of the moment—like yours. That person, that virtue, would regard the myriad things as a single whole, treating the world’s chaos as mere kindling. Who would exhaust themselves by taking the world as their concern?

That person would suffer no harm from things. Though great floods reach the heavens, they would not drown; though severe drought melts metal and stone, scorches mountains and earth, they would not feel the heat. Their dust and chaff, their husks and dregs, could yet mold and cast a Yao or Shun—who would deign to make things their business?”

Huangfu Mi said: “Jieyu tilled the fields himself. The King of Chu sent envoys bearing a hundred *yi* of gold and two teams of four horses to summon him, but he did not go.”

Qin Gao
Qin Gao was a man of Zhao. Skilled at playing the zither, he served as a retainer to King Kang of Song. Practicing the arts of Xuan and Peng, he wandered for over two hundred years in Jizhou and Zhuo Commandery (or *Ma* Commandery). Later, he took leave and entered the Zhuo River to retrieve a dragon’s offspring. He set a date with his disciples, who all purified themselves and waited by the water, preparing sacrificial offerings. As promised, he rode a red carp to the shrine, with tens of thousands observing. After a month, he entered the water and departed. Today, in Xuanzhou, there stands Qin Gao’s Fishing Platform.

Kou Xian
Kou Xian was a man of Song. He made his living by fishing, dwelling by the Sui River for over a hundred years. When he caught fish, he would sometimes release them, sometimes sell them, and sometimes eat them. He wore a cap and sash, delighted in planting lychee trees, and ate their flowers and fruit. Duke Jing of Song asked him about the Dao, but he refused to answer, so the duke had him killed. Decades later, he appeared at the gates of Song, playing the zither for days before leaving. The people of Song honored him in every household.

Prince Wang Qiao
Prince Wang, named Jin, styled Ziqiao, was also called Qiao, styled Zijin. King Ling of Zhou had thirty-eight sons, and Prince Jin was the crown prince. Born with divine marvels, he loved the Dao from childhood. Though he dwelled in the palace, he often went without food. In moments of silent reverie, immortals would descend to him, unbeknownst even to those at his side. He was fond of playing the sheng, producing the sounds of *luan* and phoenix, his music piercing the clouds and filling the palace. White *luan* and vermilion phoenixes would crane their necks and flap their wings, gathering to listen, while rare birds and strange fowl danced in the courtyards and terraces as if it were commonplace.

One day, Master Fuqiu of Mount Tiantai descended and taught him the essentials of the Dao, instructing him in the methods of refining stone essence, concealing golden radiance, and recording spirit-light. In the twenty-second year of King Ling’s reign, when the Luo River threatened to destroy the royal palace, Prince Jin repeatedly admonished the king, who refused to listen. Yielding to his nature, the prince withdrew to a separate palace, fasting and meditating on the Dao. Master Fuqiu secretly descended to his chamber, bestowed upon him divine medicine, and led him to ascend a high mountain.

Years later, his friend Lin Liang encountered Prince Jin on Mount Hou. The prince said to him, “On the seventh day of the seventh month, I shall ascend to heaven. You may gather with old friends to bid farewell.” On that day, Lin Liang and a crowd of officials and commoners climbed the mountain. They saw Prince Jin leave his carriage at the foot of the slope, drinking and feasting as before. Then, mounting a white crane, he waved his hand in farewell to the people of the world and ascended to heaven. Those near and far who witnessed it exclaimed, “Prince Wang has become an immortal!” He then declared, “Wang is my surname.” Thus, they took Wang as their clan name.

At that time, the assembled officials bowed in farewell. The horse he had ridden also bowed, then soared into the sky and departed. Today, the place is called Bowing Horse Gorge. After ascending, Prince Jin became the Right Assistant, overseeing the Five Peaks and serving the Morning Emperor. He was titled the Perfected One of Tongbai, governing the Golden Court Grotto-Heaven.

The *Chu Ci*’s *Li Sao* and *Tian Wen* state:
*“The white snake coiled, why linger in this hall?*
*How could one obtain the good medicine yet fail to guard it well?*
*The heavenly patterns shift and turn; yang departs, and one dies.*
*Why does the great bird cry out? Where has its body gone?”*

The commentary cites the *Immortal Biographies*: “Cui Wenzi studied the Dao under Prince Wang Qiao. Prince Qiao transformed into a white snake, and Wenzi held the medicine for him. Startled, Wenzi struck the snake with a halberd, causing the medicine to fall. Looking down, he saw Prince Qiao’s corpse. In an instant, it transformed into a great bird, which flew away crying.”

The *Record of Geography* states: “The central peak of the Western Mountains is the highest. At its summit lies the altar left by Prince Wang Qiao. It stands beside the ridge and now belongs to Longxing Prefecture.”

You Bozi
You Bozi was a guest of the Su clan of Zhou.

In winter he would wear only unlined garments, and in the height of summer, thickly padded robes. His appearance changed with the years, yet after decades he grew only more robust—none of his contemporaries could fathom it. Generation after generation, he came to offer sincere blessings to the descendants of the Su clan, who received his beneficent power.

**Gui Fu**
Gui Fu was a man of Xianglin. His complexion shifted from black to white, from yellow to red, and the people of Nanhai saw and revered him. He regularly consumed cassia and sunflower seeds, blending them with turtle brains into a thousand pellets, using ten *jin* of cassia. For generations, people witnessed him, and to this day, south of Jingzhou, cassia pellets remain.

**Xiaqiu Zhong**
Xiaqiu Zhong was a man of Yu. For over a hundred years, he sold medicine in Yu, and people considered him long-lived. Then, an earthquake struck, destroying his dwelling; Zhong and several dozen households in his village, their homes bordering the water, all collapsed. Zhong died, and some villagers cast his corpse into the water, taking his medicine to sell. Later, Zhong, clad in furs, appeared and approached them to retrieve his medicine. Those who had discarded him grew fearful and kowtowed, pleading for mercy. Zhong said, “I bear no grudge against you. I only wish to make people aware of who I am.” Later, he returned to Yu from the north, and the northerners called him the Banished Immortal.

**The Wine-Seller**
The Wine-Seller was a tavern keeper in the marketplace of Liang. His wine was always excellent, and he sold it daily for ten thousand coins. When he was driven away for some transgression, the tavern’s wine turned sour, and the owner grew impoverished. Many merchants in the Liang marketplace wished to marry their daughters to him and welcome him back. He came and went unpredictably, and over a hundred years later, he returned as the magistrate of Liang. He urged the people to plant more taro and vegetables, saying that in three years there would be a great famine—and indeed, it came to pass as he foretold, yet the people of Liang did not perish. Five years later, he removed his official seal and departed, and none knew where he went.

**Ren Guang**
Ren Guang was a man of Shangcai who was skilled in preparing cinnabar elixirs. He sold them in the capital’s streets and alleys for eighty-nine years before people realized he was the same Ren Guang of old. He spoke as he always had, and decades later, some elders still recognized him. Zhao Jianzi invited him to return with him. He often stayed on Baiti Mountain, and for three generations, none knew his whereabouts. The people of Jin regularly consumed his elixir.

**Xiao Shi**

The Xiao clan received its surname during the Yin dynasty. By the time of King Xuan of Zhou, there lived a man named Xiao Qin, whose wife was of the Wang clan. Both were wealthy and devoted to the Dao. Lord Lao once descended to their home, and in the seventeenth year of King Xuan’s reign, on the fifth day of the fifth month, a son was born—this was Xiao the Immortal.

From birth, he neglected his family’s affairs, wandering instead to Mount Zhongnan, where he encountered an extraordinary person who taught him the arts of longevity and instructed him in playing the xiao flute. Returning home, he told his parents of his wish to enter the Dao. Though they pressed him to marry, Xiao the Immortal said, “The stranger warned me against marriage, for I am destined to wed an emperor’s daughter.” His parents relented.

In the final years of King Xuan’s reign, the historical records fell into disarray. Xiao the Immortal, skilled in letters, composed accounts to supplement what the histories had missed. People called him “the Historian,” though this was not his true name—he was the third-born. He wandered near and far, eventually entering Qin. When Mengming’s army suffered defeat and retreated to Qin, the nobles gathered to mourn. Xiao stood respectfully beside Mengming. The Lord of Qin asked of the defeat, but Mengming could not answer; Xiao spoke in his stead with great detail. Mengming was spared punishment thanks to Xiao’s intervention.

After returning, Mengming once more let Xiao wander among mountains and rivers. At the time, the Lord of Qin had a daughter named Nongyu, who excelled at playing the sheng. Finding no suitable match, her father sought a sheng player to pair with her. Mengming, remembering Xiao’s eloquence, recommended him, and he was summoned. The Lord of Qin asked Xiao of his skills, and he replied, “I am skilled in the xiao.” The lord said, “My daughter favors the sheng—how can a xiao player suit her?” Xiao withdrew, having failed to meet expectations.

But the girl, listening from behind a screen, called out, “Let him play and see.” At the first note, a pure breeze arose; at the second, colored clouds gathered; at the third, phoenixes descended. The girl declared, “This is my husband—I wish to marry him.” Xiao said, “Let the lady also play the sheng.” She did so three times, and the same wonders occurred. Thus, Mengming acted as matchmaker, and Saisu as master of ceremonies, and a banquet was held in the Western Palace. No other music was performed—only the two played, their xiao and sheng in harmony. Before the piece ended, phoenixes descended, and the two immortals mounted them and departed.

The Lord of Qin was struck with sorrow and blamed Mengming. Mengming sent men in all directions to search for them. At the borders of Chu and Wu, someone saw on a western mountain’s high peak a man and woman playing the sheng and xiao, with phoenixes perched beside the xiao player. The messengers hurried to seek them, but they had already ascended into the heavens. Their whereabouts thereafter remain unknown—this is the broad outline of their tale.

The Red-Bearded Master

The Red-Bearded Master was seen by generations in Dengzhong. It is said he was once the fish warden under Duke Mu of Qin. He repeatedly foretold disasters and calamities—floods and droughts—within the borders of Deng, with scarcely a single error. Zhang Junfang sought him out as his teacher and studied under him. The Master had long favored eating pine nuts, asparagus root, and mineral grease. His teeth fell out and regrew; his white hair turned black again. He consumed morning radiance and ceased taking grain. Later, he dwelled at the foot of Mount Wu for over a decade before vanishing without a trace.

The Cock-Blessing Elder

The Cock-Blessing Elder was a man of Luo who lived at the foot of the northern mountain in Shixiang. He raised chickens for over a hundred years, each with its own name. His flock numbered over a thousand. At dusk, they roosted in the trees; by day, he released them to scatter. When he wished to gather them, he called their names, and they came, each breed returning separately. From selling chickens and their chicks, he amassed over a million coins, which he would then discard. He went to Wu, where he built a fish-rearing pond. Later, he ascended Mount Wu, and white cranes and peacocks often alighted beside him.

Cui Wenzi

Cui Wenzi was a man of Mount Tai from the Qin era. His family had long been devoted to the teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, and he lived at the foot of Mount Qian. Later, he crafted "Yellow Powder" and "Red Pills" at the shrine of Father Shi and sold medicines in the marketplace, claiming to be three hundred years old. When a pestilence later struck and tens of thousands perished, the magistrate beseeched him for aid. Cui Wenzi held a red brush, tied the Yellow Powder to it, and distributed it among the people. Those who drank the powder or took the pills were cured—tens of thousands in all. Later, he left for Shu to sell his medicines. Thus, the world treasured Cui Wenzi’s Red Pills and Yellow Powder, deeming them near to the divine.

Zhu Zhong

Zhu Zhong was a man of Kuaiji.

At the time of Empress Lü of the Han, an edict was issued offering rewards for three-inch pearls. Zhu Zhong, reading the proclamation, remarked, "Now your true worth is recognized." Taking a three-inch pearl, he journeyed to the palace and presented a memorial. The pearl’s quality surpassed all expectations, and he was immediately granted five hundred gold. Later, Princess Lu Yuan privately offered seven hundred gold to acquire the pearl from him, whereupon Zhu Zhong presented a four-inch pearl. Once delivered to the palace, he departed without delay. The emperor then issued an edict summoning him from Kuaiji, but his whereabouts remained unknown.

During the reign of Emperor Jing, he reappeared, offering dozens of three-inch pearls before vanishing again, leaving no trace of his destination.

Dongfang Shuo

Dongfang Shuo, styled Manqian, was a native of Yanci in Pingyuan. Orphaned three days after his birth, he was later found wandering in the marshes when a yellow-browed immortal pointed at him and said, "This is my elder brother. I abstain from grain to refine my qi, returning to wash my marrow once every three thousand years and shedding my skin and hair once every two thousand. I have already undergone three marrow-washings and three skin-sheddings."

When Emperor Wu of Han first ascended the throne, he summoned men of talent and learning from across the realm, offering them positions without regard to rank. Scholars from all directions submitted memorials on governance, numbering in the thousands from the streets and alleys alone. Those deemed unworthy were promptly dismissed.

Dongfang Shuo, upon his arrival, presented a memorial that read: "Your servant Shuo lost his parents in infancy and was raised by his elder brother and sister-in-law. At thirteen, I studied writing for three winters, and my mastery of literature and history sufficed for all needs. At fifteen, I learned swordsmanship; at sixteen, I studied the *Book of Songs*, reciting two hundred and twenty thousand words. At nineteen, I mastered the military strategies of Sun and Wu, the art of battle formations, and the teachings of war drums—also reciting two hundred and twenty thousand words. In total, your servant has committed four hundred and forty thousand words to memory, and I have long followed the words of Zilu. At twenty, I stand nine feet and three inches tall, my eyes like hanging pearls, my teeth like strung cowries. I am as brave as Meng Ben, as swift as Qing Ji, as upright as Bao Shu, and as trustworthy as Weisheng. With such qualities, I am fit to serve as a great minister to the Son of Heaven." Your servant Shuo, risking death, bows twice to make this known.

Shuo’s memorial was immodest, filled with self-praise, yet the emperor admired his boldness and ordered him to await summons at the Public Carriage Office. His stipend was meager, and he was not granted an audience for some time. Later, Shuo teased the court dwarfs, saying, "The emperor believes you lot are of no use to the state. You cannot till the fields or labor as others do; you cannot govern the people when placed in office; and you are unfit for military service or combat."

"You are of no use to the state’s needs, merely consuming food and clothing—now the emperor intends to execute all of you." The dwarfs were seized with terror and wept bitterly. Shuo instructed them, "When the emperor passes by, kowtow and beg for mercy." After a short while, word came that the emperor was approaching, and the dwarfs wailed, knocking their heads to the ground. The emperor asked what was the matter, and they replied, "Dongfang Shuo says Your Majesty intends to kill us all." The emperor summoned Shuo and demanded, "Why are you frightening the dwarfs?" Shuo replied, "Your servant speaks in life, and I shall speak in death. These dwarfs stand barely over three feet tall, yet each receives a sack of grain and two hundred and forty coins. If the dwarfs are sated to the point of death, your servant starves to the point of death. If my words are of use, I humbly beg for different treatment; if they are of no use, dismiss me—do not let me merely consume the price of grain in Chang’an." The emperor roared with laughter and thereafter ordered Shuo to await summons at the Gate of the Golden Horse, gradually drawing him into closer favor.

The emperor often had several masters of divination play at *shefu*, placing a gecko beneath a bowl and having them guess what it was—none could hit the mark. Shuo volunteered, "Your servant once studied the *Book of Changes*; allow me to try." He then arranged the trigrams in a separate chamber and answered, "I believe it is a dragon, yet it has no horns; I believe it is a snake, yet it has feet—it must be either a gecko or a skink." The emperor said, "Excellent." He then had Shuo guess other objects in succession, and each time Shuo was correct, the emperor rewarded him with silk.

At that time, there was a favored performer named Guo Sheren, whose wit and humor knew no bounds. Whatever Sheren asked, Shuo would answer in an instant, his responses shifting and cunning, leaving none able to outmatch him. The courtiers were astonished, and the emperor appointed Shuo as a Gentleman of the Palace, whereupon he gained the emperor’s favor and affection.

Later, the emperor sought to strengthen ties with the King of Yue and dispatched Shuo to sail across the sea in search of treasures, instructing him to return within a year. Yet Shuo took two years to return. Before his arrival, the emperor asked his attendants, "Shuo has been gone so long—who in the realm is skilled in divination?" They replied, "Only Sun Bin is most proficient in the *Book of Changes*." The emperor then changed into commoner’s clothes and, taking two bolts of silk with his attendants, went to knock at Bin’s door. Bin came out to receive them and offered them seats, not recognizing the emperor. After casting the hexagrams, Bin realized who his visitor was and, trembling with fear, rose to bow. The emperor said, "I have come seeking something—do not speak of it." Bin replied, "Your Majesty has not come to divine about other matters, but about Dongfang Shuo. Shuo will arrive in seven days. Even now, he is at sea, facing west and summoning the waters with a great sigh. When he arrives, I beg you to question him."

On the appointed day, Shuo returned. The emperor asked, "You promised to return in a year—why has it been two?" Shuo replied, "I dared not delay, but the treasure was not yet found." The emperor said, "Seven days ago, you were at sea, facing west and summoning the waters with a great sigh—why?" Shuo answered, "I sighed over no other matter: it was because Sun Bin did not recognize the Son of Heaven and sat facing him as an equal." The emperor was deeply astonished by this.

Later, Shuo wrote to a friend: "Do not let the dusty net of fame and the bonds of reputation ensnare you. Laugh freely, cast off the Ten Continents and Three Isles, and together let us gather jade-like herbs, swallow the radiance of the sun and moon, and ascend lightly into the heavens." The Queen Mother of the West once pointed to Shuo and said to the emperor, "This is the little boy from my neighborhood, ever full of wit and mischief—he has come three times to steal my peaches. Long ago, he was an immortal official under the Supreme Lord of the Dao. The Supreme Lord sent him to Mount Fangzhang, but he did nothing but play, recklessly stirring thunder and lightning, whipping up waves and winds, causing flood dragons to crawl on land and mountains to crumble into the sea. The Supreme Lord banished him to the mortal world, but recently the Two Immortals of Jinhua and the Nine Doubts Lord Chen begged for his pardon."

The emperor then realized Shuo was no ordinary man and came to believe in the existence of immortals throughout the world. Yet he indulged in sensual pleasures without restraint and never ceased his campaigns of conquest. After six years of studying the sacred texts, his understanding deepened, and he believed the divine had truly descended, certain he would transcend the mortal realm. He built towers and palaces, exhausting the people, and disregarded every subtle admonition of the Queen Mother and the profound warnings of the Lady of Supreme Primordial. The two immortals never returned. In the second year of the *Taichu* era, the Pavilion of Cypress Beams burned, and the *True Form Chart*, *Six Jia and Five Thearchs Spirit-Flight Twelve Matters Divine Radiance Scripture* were all lost in the flames.

Yet earlier, the emperor had received the *Chart of the Five Peaks* from the Queen Mother and bestowed it upon Dong Zhongjun, and from the Lady of Supreme Primordial, he had received the *Six Jia* and given it to Li Shaojun. These texts thus circulated in the world. After the books were burned, the emperor realized he had lost the Dao. Later, Shuo one day mounted a dragon and ascended into the heavens.

Liu Xiang’s *Biographies of the Immortals* states: By the time of Emperor Zhao, Dongfang Shuo was sometimes called a divine being, sometimes an ordinary man. He acted with varying degrees of depth and restraint, sometimes speaking earnestly, sometimes in jest—none could fathom his intent. By the beginning of Emperor Xuan’s reign, he abandoned his post as Gentleman of the Palace to escape the chaos of the age, leaving his official cap in his quarters before being carried away by the wind. Later, he was seen in Kuaiji, selling medicine by the Five Lakes. The wise suspected he was the essence of the Year Star.

The *Miscellaneous Records of the Western Capital* records Dongfang Shuo as saying: "No one in the world knows me—only the Grand Historian understands." Emperor Wu summoned the Grand Historian and asked, "All the stars are in their places—why is the Year Star not visible?" **Xiu Yanggong**—Xiu Yanggong was a man of Wei.

Within the stone chamber of Mount Huayin hung a suspended rock, its surface worn hollow where a couch had stood outside it, yet the stone itself remained unmoved. At times, he gathered yellow essence to eat. Later, his mastery of the Dao became known to the throne. Emperor Jing of Han honored him, keeping him in the royal residence for several years, though the Dao could not be obtained from him.

One day, the emperor asked, *"When will you speak, Master?"*
Soon after, the man transformed atop a grove into a white stone ram. Upon its flank, he inscribed: *"Xiu Yanggong bids farewell to the Son of Heaven."* Later, a true stone ram appeared upon the Tower of Spiritual Communication. The ram then vanished, its whereabouts unknown.

Your servant Daoyi says: *The* Daodejing *states: "Between heaven and earth, is it not like a bellows? Still yet unyielding, moving yet ever-producing. Excessive speech hastens exhaustion—better to guard the center."* Xiu Yanggong had attained this. Moreover, transforming into a white stone ram and inscribing his flank—*"Xiu Yanggong bids farewell to the Son of Heaven"*—reveals his unflagging gratitude for the emperor’s recognition, the profundity of his Dao, and the fulfillment of his duty.

**Ji Qiujun**
Ji Qiujun was a Daoist of Mount Tai. During the reign of Emperor Wu of Han, he was rewarded for his mastery of the Dao and Way of Guarding Life, his white hair returning to black and his fallen teeth regrowing. Later, he departed.

When the emperor journeyed to Mount Tai, Ji Qiujun donned a *zhangfu* cap and yellow robes, cradling a zither as he came to greet him. *"Do not ascend, Your Majesty,"* he warned, *"or you will injure your toes."* After several *li*, the emperor’s left foot indeed broke. He concealed the injury, offering sacrifices before returning. A shrine was erected for Ji Qiujun, with a hundred households granted to maintain it in perpetuity.

**Duzi**
Duzi was a man of Ye.

Ji Qiujun spent his early years on Black Mountain, gathering pine nuts and *fuling* mushrooms to consume as elixirs. After several hundred years, he would sometimes appear youthful, sometimes aged, sometimes handsome, sometimes plain—revealing himself as an immortal.

He often visited the Yang family in the capital to purchase wine. The Yangs had a daughter whose brows were joined and whose ears were slender and long; all who saw her marveled, calling her a celestial being. One day, Duzi arrived leading a yellow calf, and the Yang girl took a liking to him. She devoted herself to serving him. When she followed Duzi out to gather peaches and plums, they returned after a single night, bearing fruits of extraordinary sweetness. The townspeople trailed them, but upon leaving the gate, they seized the calf’s ears and fled—none could catch them.

Later, Duzi reappeared in the marketplace, remaining for decades before departing. He was later seen beneath Pan Mountain, selling peaches and plums in winter.

**Qi Longming**
Qi Longming was a man of Huntíng. At twenty, he found over ten dragon hatchlings in a pond, resembling geckos. He raised them, feeding them and building a thatched hut to guard them. As the dragons grew, they gradually departed. Over fifty years later, a flood destroyed his hut and carried them away.

One day, a man riding a dragon arrived at Huntíng and declared, *"I am the grandson of Feng Bochang. If this dragon is not released within five hundred *li*, it will surely die."* Those who heard him dismissed it as a demon’s ramblings. By the eighth month, a flood indeed came, drowning tens of thousands.

**Zhuzhu**
Zhuzhu’s origins were unknown. He ascended Rock Mountain with a Daoist and said, *"Here lies cinnabar—enough to yield tens of thousands of *jin*."* The prefectural magistrate, learning of this, sealed the mountain, but the cinnabar flowed out like flying fire. Thus, they permitted Zhuzhu to retrieve it.

Magistrate Zhang Junming consumed the cinnabar for three years and obtained divine cinnabar as light as drifting snow. After five years of ingestion, he gained the ability to fly and departed with Zhuzhu.

**The Old Man in Deerskin**
The Old Man in Deerskin was a man of Miaochuan. In his youth, he served as a minor clerk in the prefectural office, skilled in carpentry—his hands could craft any implement with precision.

Atop Mount Cen lay a sacred spring, inaccessible to men. The clerk petitioned the prefect, requesting thirty carpenters with axes and adzes. They constructed a revolving wheel and suspended pavilions, their ingenuity unbounded. Within days, a laddered path took shape on all four sides. At the summit, they built a shrine and lodgings, where he remained, severing two of the paths for his own seclusion.

He ate *zhi* herbs and drank from the sacred spring, dwelling thus for nearly seventy years. When the Miaoshui River rose in three surges, he summoned his clansmen and household—over sixty in number—and bade them ascend halfway up the mountain. The flood submerged the entire commandery, drowning tens of thousands.

The clerk then took his leave, sending his kin back down the mountain. Donning a deerskin cap, he departed, returning to the pavilion. Over a hundred years later, he was seen selling medicine in the marketplace.

**The Stream Father**
The Stream Father was a man of Lü in Nan Commandery.

At his mountain dwelling, there lived an immortal who often stayed in his home. Once, when purchasing melons, the immortal taught him to refine the melon seeds, mixing them with cassia, *gui* stalks, and *zhushi* fruit for storage, then sharing them equally to eat. After over twenty years, he gained the ability to run swiftly and ascend mountains or enter water. More than a hundred years later, he took up solitary residence atop the mountain. He would call down to the elders by the stream and speak of matters from the time of his birth.

**Mountain Chart**
Mountain Chart was a man of Longxi. In his youth, he loved riding horses, but one threw him, breaking his leg in the mountains. A Daoist taught him to take realgar, *danggui*, *qianghuo*, *duhuo*, and *kushen*; after a year, he lost his appetite for food, and his illness was cured, his body lightened. The Daoist questioned him, saying, "The Five Peaks have sent me to gather herbs from the famous mountains. If you follow me, I can make you immortal." Mountain Chart followed him for over sixty years. One day, he returned home to observe mourning for his mother. After a year, he departed again, and none knew where he went.

**Valley Spring**
Valley Spring was a man of Liyang. During the reign of Emperor Cheng of Han, he served as a Gentleman. He died of an epidemic, yet his body did not stiffen. His family held the funeral and wore mourning clothes but dared not seal the coffin. Three years later, he was seen sitting at the county gate, wearing his cap and sash. The townspeople were astonished, and his family came to fetch him, but he refused to return. When they opened the coffin, they found only clothes, no corpse. He stayed at the gate for three nights, then left for Chang’an, stopping at the Heng Gate. People recognized him and pursued him, but he departed again. He went to Mount Taibai, where he established a shrine on the mountain and would occasionally come to stay the night in his own shrine.

**Yin Sheng**
Yin Sheng often begged in the markets of Chang’an. The townspeople grew weary of him, and some even splashed excrement on his clothes, yet his garments remained unstained as before. The local officials heard of this and tried to arrest and beat him, binding him in stocks, but he reappeared in the market. They attempted to kill him, and only then did he leave. The household of the man who had splashed excrement collapsed on its own, killing over ten people.

Your servant Daoyi says: The Way of Yin Sheng was established for the destitute and helpless of all generations. That the market-dweller’s household collapsed was because their evil had reached its limit, and calamity befell them. Observe how they took pleasure in cruelty, humiliating the lonely and poor—such was the depth of their inhumanity. As for Yin Sheng, he merely used their deeds to reveal his transformation; it was not Yin Sheng who harmed them. Likewise, the hidden sorrow of Duke Cao of Wei or the fallen beggar Wang Dunjia—all share this intent. The *Daodejing* says: "Thus the sage constantly excels in saving people, and so abandons no one." Is this not the Way of Yin Sheng?

**Ziying**

**Ziying**

Ziying was a man of Shu Village. Skilled in diving to catch fish, he once caught a red carp. Admiring its fine color, he took it home and placed it in his pond, feeding it rice and grain for many days. Within a year, it grew over a *zhang* in length, sprouted horns, and grew wings. Ziying, astonished, bowed and paid his respects. The fish spoke: "I have come to fetch you. Mount my back, and I shall carry you to ascend to heaven." Just then, a great rain fell. Ziying climbed onto the fish’s back, and together they soared away. Year after year, he would return to his old home, eating and drinking with his wife and children, before the fish came again to fetch him. This continued for seventy years. Thus, in the gates and households of Wu, images of the divine fish were made, and a shrine to Ziying was established.

**Fujianzi**
Fujianzi—his origins unknown—was a man often seen in Ju, coming and going along the seashore. Among the various shrines, there were three immortals who gambled with melons. Fujianzi saw a magistrate carrying several dozen yellow and white melons. The immortals told him to close his eyes, and when he opened them, he found himself on Fangzhang Mountain, which lies south of Penglai Mountain. Thereafter, he would travel to Ju, bringing back treasures, pearls, and jade from Fangzhang Mountain to sell. After some time, one day he shaved his head and donned ochre robes, his appearance grown old. When asked, he said it was because he had taken things from the temple. Several years later, his appearance became youthful and fine again, his temples as they had been in former days.

**Wen Bin**
Wen Bin was a man of Taiqiu Village.

Wen Bin made his living by selling straw sandals, taking wives many times, only to abandon them after several decades. Later, one of his former wives had grown old in longevity, over ninety years of age, when she saw Bin again—now robust and youthful. At another time, the old woman bowed to Bin, weeping in gratitude. Bin said, "You should not come on the first morning of the new year. Might you meet me at the western shrine of the village pavilion?" The old woman, though aged, traveled over ten *li* at night with her children and grandchildren, sitting in the shrine to await him. After a moment, Bin arrived and exclaimed in surprise, "Do you pursue the Dao? I knew you would come." He continued, "Before, I would not have left you. Now, I will teach you to take chrysanthemum flowers, *difu* (earth skin), mistletoe from mulberry trees, and pine nuts to replenish your *qi*." The old woman, too, grew strong again and was said to have lived another hundred years.

**Shangqiu Zixu**
Shangqiu Zixu was a man of Gaoyi. He enjoyed herding pigs and playing the *yu* reed pipe. At seventy, he had not taken a wife yet showed no signs of aging. The people of his village found him extraordinary and sought to learn the Dao from him. He told them simply to eat the roots of *mu* (wood) and *jupu* (sweet flag), drink water, and they would neither hunger nor age. Thus, he was seen across generations for over three hundred years. When nobles and wealthy families questioned him and took his remedy, they could not persist for even a year, their hearts growing weary and negligent. They claimed he must be hiding some secret technique.

**Zizhu**
Zizhu spoke in the Chu dialect with a delicate voice. His origins were unknown.

He journeyed to the court of the King of Jiangdu of Han, declaring: *"Master Yu hired me as a retainer, yet for three hundred years I have not been released from service."* The king took him for a madman. When asked where the master resided, he replied: *"On the summit of Longmei Mountain."* The king dispatched an official to ascend the peak, where they found Master Yu—his body covered in hair, his ears broad, his hair unbound as he plucked a zither. Upon seeing Zizhu, he bowed his head. The official delivered the king’s message, to which the master said: *"This is Zizhu, the ninth-generation descendant of my former neighbor. Moreover, I foresee that three women in your household will die violently—do not meddle in my affairs."* As his words ended, a great wind arose, and the official fled down the mountain. By the time he returned to the palace, three women had indeed been killed. The king then offered sacrifices of the three livestock and established a shrine there.

**Tao Angong**
Tao Angong was a master smelter of Liu’an. One day, as he repeatedly stoked the furnace, the flames suddenly surged upward, and a purple *qi* pierced the heavens. Angong prostrated himself beneath the furnace, pleading for mercy. In an instant, a vermilion phoenix alighted upon the cooling metal and spoke: *"Angong, Angong, the cold metal now communes with Heaven. On the seventh day of the seventh month, a crimson dragon will come to receive you."* When the appointed day arrived, a crimson dragon descended amid a great rain. Angong mounted it and soared toward a city in the southeast. Tens of thousands from the town gathered to see him off, bidding him a final farewell.

**Chifu**
Chifu was a man of the Ba frontier.

Chifu served as the registrar of the Green Rooster Shrine. Skilled in refining cinnabar and saltpeter through water tempering, he consumed the elixir for thirty years, reverting to a youthful state—his hair and beard all turned crimson. Decades later, he ascended Mount Hua to gather *Yu’s surplus grain* for sustenance, selling it along the Cangwu and Dian Rivers. The legacy passed through generations, and upon his palm remained the mark of a crimson axe.

**Hu Zixian**
Hu Zixian was a diviner beneath the watchtower of Hanzhong. Aged over a hundred, on the eve of his departure, he called to an old tavern woman: *"Hasten your preparations—I shall accompany you to join the Prince of Zhongling."* That night, an immortal arrived bearing two straw dogs. Hu Zixian took one, while the tavern woman mounted the other; both transformed into dragons, ascending Mount Huayin. From the mountain’s heights, he would often cry out: *"Zixian—here stands the tavern keeper’s mother!"*

**The Master of the Mirror-Load**
The Master of the Mirror-Load’s origins were unknown, though his speech resembled that of the Yan and Dai regions. He would carry a mirror-grinding frame through the markets of Wu, polishing mirrors for a single coin. As he worked, he would ask the owner if they suffered any ailments, then offer a purple pill—all who took it recovered. For decades, he did this, and when a great plague struck, he went door to door distributing medicine, saving tens of thousands without accepting payment. The people of Wu then recognized him as a true immortal. Later, he climbed a sheer cliff on Mount Wu, dangling medicine from its edge to give to those below. Before departing, he told them: *"I return to Penglai. For your sake, I shall send down divine water from the cliff’s peak."* Thereafter, a milky stream flowed daily from the stone crevice, and many who drank it were cured of their illnesses. Over ten shrines were erected in his honor.

**Ruan Qiu**

Ruan Qiu was a Daoist of Mount Sui. Clad in furs with unbound hair, his ears measured seven inches, and his mouth bore no teeth. He could walk four hundred *li* in a day. For over a hundred years, he cultivated scallions and leeks in the mountains, unknown to others. At times, he descended to sell medicine. Zhu Huang of Guangyang suffered from a virulent ailment, and Qiu gave him a seven-ingredient remedy, expelling the Three Corpses. Later, he entered Mount Fuyang with Zhu Huang, who then recognized him as a divine immortal.

Zhu Huang was a man of Guangling. From youth, he suffered from a virulent ailment and sought out Ruan Qiu of Mount Sui. Qiu took pity on him, saying: *"You shall expel the Three Corpses from your abdomen—this is the work of a true immortal. You may transcend the world."* Huang replied: *"When my illness is cured, I shall serve you as a disciple for thirty years, never daring to return on my own."* Qiu gave Huang a seven-ingredient remedy, instructing him to take nine pills daily. After a hundred days, his ailment discharged in quantities like liver and spleen—several *dou* in volume. Nurtured for several decades, he grew robust, his mind and spirit daily more luminous. Qiu gave him the *Yellow Court Scripture* of Lord Lao, commanding him to read it thrice daily. Once he mastered it, he could grasp its meaning.

Ruan Qiu then entered Floating Sun Mountain’s Jade Maiden Shrine with Huang, where they remained for eighty years. When they returned to their former dwelling, Huang’s white hair had turned black, and his temples now grew three *chi* longer. He visited his family to take meals, staying for several years before departing again. Thus he remained until the end of Emperor Wu’s reign.

**Lingyang Ziming**
Lingyang Ziming was a native of Quan Village. Fond of fishing, he once hooked a white dragon in Whirling Creek. Terrified, Ziming untied the hook, bowed, and released it. Later, he caught a white fish whose belly contained a text teaching him the method of ingesting and refining elixirs. Ziming then ascended Mount Huang, where he gathered the Five Mineral Resins and boiled them in water. After three years of ingestion, a dragon came to welcome him away, and he dwelled on Mount Lingyang—now part of Xuanzhou—for over a hundred years. The mountain rose more than a thousand *zhang* above the earth. He would call down to people below, bidding them ascend halfway up the slope, saying, *"The one named Zi’an from the creek will come. Ask him if my fishing rod still remains."*

More than twenty years later, Ziming died. People buried him on the mountain, whereupon a yellow crane alighted on the trees above his tomb and cried out, *"Zi’an!"* At Mount Yellow Crane in Wuchang stands the Yellow Crane Tower. The *Qi Records* state: *"The immortal Zi’an rode a yellow crane past this place."*

The man known as Xingzi claimed to be a native of Shu. Fond of hunting with dogs, he was skilled in judging their qualities. One day, his dog ran into a mountain cave, and Xingzi followed. After more than ten nights of travel, they had traversed several hundred *li*. Emerging at the summit, he found terraces, halls, and palaces, their verdant pines towering in dense array, while immortal officials and guards stood in solemn vigil. There, he saw his former wife, who was washing fish. She gave him a sealed talisman and instructed him to return and deliver it to Magistrate Qiao of Chengdu. When the magistrate opened the seal, he found fish roe inside. Placing them in a pond and raising them for a year, they all transformed into dragons. Xingzi then returned the talisman to the mountain, whereupon his dog’s fur turned a deeper red, and it grew long wings. For over a hundred years, the dog accompanied Xingzi as he came and went, eventually remaining on the mountain while occasionally descending to protect his clan. The people of Shu erected a shrine at the cave’s entrance, where the sounds of drums, flutes, and heralding voices were often heard. For dozens of *li* to the southwest, the people jointly worshipped there.

Mu Yu was a native of Nanheping Township in Julu. His mother, poor and of low status, worked as a midwife. Once, while attending a birth, she saw the newborn open its eyes, gaze at its mother, and laugh aloud. Terrified, she dreamed that night of a tall figure in a grand cap and crimson sash standing guard over the child, who said, *"I am the Lord of Life. I shall repay your kindness by allowing your son, Mu Yu, to attain immortality."* The mother secretly took note of this. Later, when she gave birth to a son, she named him Mu Yu. The child she had delivered turned fifteen, when one night a carriage and horses arrived to take him away. Passing by the mother’s home, he called out, *"Mu Yu, come drive for me!"* And so they departed together.

More than twenty years later, crows and sparrows would daily bring two or three fish and place them upon the mother’s doorstep. She concealed this and told no one, selling the fish instead, and only revealed the matter after thirty years had passed. The mother lived to be a hundred years old before she finally passed away.

Xuan Su

Xuan Su claimed to be a native of Hejian. He wore clothing made from bayu fiber and sold medicine in the marketplace, charging one coin for seven pills, which effectively cured all manner of illnesses. The King of Hejian suffered from a carbuncle, so he purchased the medicine and took it, whereupon more than ten snakes emerged from his body. When the king inquired about the medicine’s nature, Su replied, *"Your Majesty’s carbuncle was the accumulated misfortune of six generations descending upon you—it was not something you brought upon yourself. Once, you released a lactating doe, and your benevolence moved Heaven, which is why I was sent to you."* An elderly retainer in the king’s household said his father had known Su in his own time.

Su cast no shadow. The king summoned him and placed him in the sunlight, confirming that he indeed had no shadow. The king then offered his daughter in marriage to Su, but that night, Su vanished. Later, he was seen at the foot of Mount Chang.

*Comprehensive Mirror of Daoist Realization, Attaining the Way* (Volume Three) concludes here.

**Editorial Principles of *The Mirror of Immortals***

1. The first section lists the Three Pure Ones, the Five Venerable Lords, and other lofty perfected beings, comprising five volumes. Each entry is supported by scriptural citations, presenting the essential framework to demonstrate reverence for Heaven and the exalted Sovereign, titled *Outer Annals of the Comprehensive Mirror*.

2. *The Comprehensive Mirror of Daoist Realization* begins with the Three Sovereigns of high antiquity and extends to the end of the Song dynasty. The accounts of immortals and perfected beings who attained the Way were gathered from imperial archives, verified against classical histories and Daoist hagiographies, and compiled after careful collation. Where necessary, redundancies were trimmed and essentials preserved, with no arbitrary additions from the compiler’s own hand, so as to ensure credibility for posterity and modestly emulate the principle of "transmission, not creation."

3. There are five grades of immortal cultivation and three stages of elixir refinement. Once one has verified the truth, the wondrous applications are unfathomable, and thus they are recorded in a unified manner, without attempting to distinguish differences in superiority or inferiority.

4. The biographies of various immortals record terms such as *ascending in flight*, *soaring aloft*, *rising to Heaven*, *lightly ascending*, *stretching upward*, *ascending in flight*, *attaining perfection*, *liberation through transformation*, *transformation through release*, *feathered transformation*, *concealed transformation*, *manifest transformation*, *manifest death*, and *manifest passing*—all of which are transcribed exactly as they appear in the original sources, without alteration.

5. Where the practices of perfected immortals align with the *Five Thousand Words of the Dao and Virtue*, commentary is occasionally provided to extol their excellence, demonstrating the supreme value of venerating the Dao and Virtue. Later scholars should take these as models.

6. The arrangement of this work does not strictly adhere to chronological order, but rather presents a general sequence. If a learned scholar is able to investigate and correct it, such emendations would be most welcome.

1. On the Errors in the *Comprehensive Mirror for Aid in Government*’s Chronological Tables
   – Examining the Zhou dynasty: King Li reigned for thirty-six years, and the Duke of Zhou and Duke of Shao administered the realm jointly for fourteen years, totaling fifty years. Yet the *Comprehensive Mirror*’s chronological tables record King Li’s reign as forty years and the joint regency as fifty, amounting to ninety years—an error that inserts forty extra years. How could ministers assisting a young sovereign possibly hold power for fifty years before returning governance? According to Liu Shu’s *Outer Annals*, King Li did not reign for forty years, and the text states that in the fourteenth year of the joint regency, King Li died in exile at Zhi—there is no record of a fifty-year regency. This is the error of the compiler of the chronological tables. Moreover, the lifespans of the Zhou kings vary, and when their reigns are summed, they total nine hundred twenty-seven years. Upon examination, this is because an entire cycle of the sexagenary calendar—fifty-four years in Zhou and six in Shang—has been erroneously included, causing the sequence of sexagenary years to be misaligned. Liu Shu’s *Outer Annals* also concludes, based on the *Three Sequences Calendar*, that the Western and Eastern Zhou together spanned slightly over eight hundred years, never exceeding nine hundred. This further demonstrates the clear errors in later chronological tables. From the first year of Emperor Yao of Tang upward, though various scholars’ records of imperial reigns differ, none have mistakenly included an entire sexagenary cycle—let this pass without further discussion. From the first year of Qin’s Yuan downward, the records align with those of other scholars.

2. Upon the completion of the *Comprehensive Mirror of Perfected Immortals Who Embodied the Dao*, the chronology follows the chronological tables in Xie Guanfu’s *Veritable Records of the Primordial Origin*, aiming to emulate the structure of the *Comprehensive Mirror for Aid in Government*. In compiling the *Comprehensive Mirror of Perfected Immortals Who Transmitted the Dao*, the first task was to verify the chronology for the benefit of future scholars. Just as the *Comprehensive Mirror for Aid in Government* begins with King Weilie of Zhou and the *Comprehensive Mirror of Buddhism* follows suit by starting with King Zhao of Zhou, the Daoist tradition, adopting the format of these two works, appropriately begins with Tang Yangjia of Yin. This is because Lord Lao descended from the Great Clarity Realm in the seventeenth year of Yangjia’s reign, incarnating in the womb of the Mysterious and Wondrous Jade Maiden. However, upon examining Liu Shu’s *Outer Annals of the Comprehensive Mirror*, Shao Yong’s *Book of the World’s Evolution*, and the chronologies of imperial reigns recorded in Daoist scriptures, discrepancies emerge. These three sources differ because the lengths of reigns they record vary, leading to mismatches in the sequence of years and stems-and-branches. Liu and Shao were both eminent Confucian scholars of antiquity, yet their findings diverge, and even Confucians cannot definitively determine which is correct. Some say Liu’s work focuses on thoroughly investigating order and chaos rather than precise chronology, while Shao’s book, which clarifies mathematical patterns, emphasizes chronological accuracy—perhaps Shao’s is the correct version. If so, does Liu’s work rely on historical records, and are those records false? Others argue that the remote past cannot be verified, and this view is well-founded. In compiling the *Comprehensive Mirror of Embodied Dao*, it is fitting to rely solely on the chronologies recorded in Daoist scriptures, such as the chronological tables in Xie Guanfu’s *Veritable Records of the Primordial Origin*, which have already been meticulously verified. Later compilers should have no doubts on this matter.

**Scroll Four of the *Comprehensive Mirror of Perfected Immortals Who Embodied the Dao***

**The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign**
The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign’s origins in the Dao are unknown, yet he was one who cultivated the utmost Dao in a prior kalpa. His body stood nine feet tall, and his entire frame was covered in dark, shaggy hair over a foot long. During the Yellow Emperor’s time, he dwelled beneath the sheer yin cliffs of Mount Emei, residing in a house of azure jade with a throne of gold, draped in patterned silk banners and burning the finest incense. His attendants were immortal youths and jade maidens, and three seated guests, all addressed as *Celestial Immortal Kings of the Great Clarity*. The Yellow Emperor bowed twice and inquired of the Dao, receiving the scripture of the *Five Teeth and Three Ones*. Later, on Mount Emei, he bestowed the *Supreme Purity Numinous Treasure Scripture for the Salvation of Humanity* upon the Yellow Emperor, and on the Terrace of Pastoral Virtue, he transmitted it to Emperor Yu. Another account states that north of the Min River in Shu’s Mount Min lies Mother of Mercy Mountain, where the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign cultivated the Dao. The mountain holds Dragon Pond, in which swim gold, silver, copper, and iron fish, each matching its color. Those who consume them find their taste like dried ginger, and eating them confers longevity—they are called *flesh mushrooms*. One Dragon Pond lies on the mountain, another in the sky, both as clear as mirrors, unstained by the slightest impurity. If a withered leaf or twig falls upon them, a five-colored phoenix swiftly carries it away.

**Bai Shisheng**
Bai Shisheng was a disciple of the Central Yellow Elder and had already lived over two thousand years by the time of Peng Zu. He refused to cultivate the path of ascending as an immortal, content merely with avoiding death. He did not forsake the pleasures of the human world, and his practice centered on the elixir of golden fluid. Initially, troubled by poverty and low status, he could not obtain the elixir. For over a decade, he raised pigs and herded sheep, practicing frugality until he amassed ten thousand gold pieces, with which he purchased and consumed the elixir. He often boiled white stones for sustenance, hence his residence on White Stone Mountain earned him the name *Bai Shisheng*. He occasionally ate dried meat and drank wine, sometimes consuming grains, and could walk three to four hundred *li* in a day. His complexion appeared no older than thirty. By nature, he enjoyed paying homage and meditating on spirits, as well as reading immortal scriptures and the *Great Simplicity Transmission*. Peng Zu asked him, “Why not consume the elixir and ascend to heaven?” He replied, “There is no greater joy than this world. The only concern is avoiding old age and death. Heaven is filled with exalted beings, and serving them is more arduous than life here.” Thus, people called him the *Reclusive Leisurely Immortal*, for he was not eager to ascend to heaven, seek an immortal office, or pursue fame.

**Wang Ni**

The ancient immortal Lord Wang Ni was a disciple of the Old Lord. He attained the Dao during the eras of Fuxi and Shennong. The Yellow Emperor encountered him and received from him the essentials of the Way. Through the reigns of Shaohao and Zhuanxu, he often wandered among mortals. Before the time of Emperor Yao, he served as the teacher of Nie Que, teaching him the art of "flying steps." Even in the eras of Yao and Shun, there were still those who saw him, until one day he ascended to heaven.

**Master Hong Ya**

Master Hong Ya was, according to some, Ling Lun, a minister of the Yellow Emperor, who attained the Dao and departed as an immortal, bearing the surname Zhang. Others say that by the time of Emperor Yao, he had already lived for three thousand years. During the reign of Emperor Wu of Han, a man named Wei Dushi entered Mount Hua in search of his father, Shuqing. He found Shuqing on a sheer cliff, playing a game of *bo* on a stone with several others. When asked who they were, they replied: Master Hong Ya, Xu You, Chao Fu, Grandee Di, Feihuangzi, Prince Jin, and Xue Rong.

In the *Western Capital Rhapsody* by Ban Mengjian of the Eastern Han, it is written: *"Hong Ya stands and gestures, amidst the fluttering of delicate plumes."* Thus, the master had long been a leader among the immortals. Tao Hongjing’s *Declarations of the Perfected* states: *"Master Hong Ya now serves as the Perfected of the Grotto of True Reality on Mount Qingcheng,"* which is why the mountain is also known as Hong Ya today. Guo Jingchun’s *Poems on Roaming Immortals* says: *"To the left, he grasps the sleeve of Fuqiu; to the right, he claps Hong Ya’s shoulder."* Elsewhere, it reads: *"Chang’e lifts her wondrous voice, while Hong Ya strokes his chin."* At that time, the master and his companions—Chang’e, Fuqiu, and others—were still visible to those who sought the immortal path.

Mount Hong Ya lies among the western mountains of Yuzhang, where the master once secluded himself. In the ninth year of the Kaihuang era of Emperor Wen of Sui, the commandery of Yuzhang was renamed Hongzhou, after the mountain where the master resided. Today, Hong Well lies at the northern cliff of Mount Fulong. On either side, sheer stone precipices rise abruptly, and in spring and summer, cascading torrents roar like thunder before plunging into the well, where their force is suddenly quelled. The remaining flow forms a small stream that feeds into Luan Pond.

An ancient altar stands above the well, said to be where the master refined his elixirs. In times of drought, prayers offered there summon a red serpent that appears upon the water’s surface, and rain follows at once. About a *li* north of the well, among the rocky shoals, lie five stone mortars, their color as vivid as cinnabar, each round and over two *chi* deep. These are said to be where the master pounded his medicines. Locals claim that on the morning of the fifth day of the fifth month, before dawn, the sound of pounding can sometimes be heard, and woodcutters occasionally come upon his leftover dregs.

About two *li* south of the well lies Luan Ridge, encircled by water—this is Luan Pond. Legend holds that the ridge was where the master’s simurgh rested, and nearby once stood Luan Mountain Abbey. In *The Five Peaks’ Audience Rites* by Celestial Master Sima, it is written: *"The grotto of Mount Qingcheng spans two thousand *li* in circumference. In ancient times, Master Hong Ya consumed the blossoms of *langgan* and secluded himself there, succeeding as the Perfected of Qingcheng."*

**Zhan Shanggong**

Zhan Shanggong was an immortal of the Gaoxin era.

Zhan Shanggong studied the Dao under Fu Long, whose land happened to be owned by Li Mimian. After attaining the Way, Shanggong now serves as the Right Protector of the Nine Palaces. He often told the other immortals: "Long ago in Huayang, I ate a white plum so delicious that I still recall its taste—yet in the blink of an eye, three thousand years have passed." After Guo Sichao, five fruits were planted there, and the land was also suitable for cultivating crabapples. These were the "crabapples of the blessed land," said to dispel plague and pestilence. *The Jade Casket Record* states: "Xianshan, commonly called Dunu Mountain, is where the immortal Zhan Shanggong ascended to heaven. He once said, 'Long ago in Huayang, I ate a white plum—suddenly, three thousand years had passed.'" There is a Green Plain where Lord Mao oversees the planting; White Plum Creek lies north of Small Mao Mountain.

*The Commentary on the Declarations of the Perfected* notes: "According to various chronologies, from the first year of Yao’s reign (wuxu) to the year jimao of the Qi era, 2,803 years have elapsed. Gaoxin was Yao’s father, so if Shanggong spoke these words during the Jin dynasty, claiming three thousand years had passed, then from Yao’s time to the present would indeed be no less than 2,800 years. External calendars may vary, but even so, the count of dinghai years should not have already been exceeded. Examining *The Bamboo Annals*, the total is precisely 2,643 years—a discrepancy even greater."

**He Hou**

He Hou was a recluse on Mount Cangwu during Yao’s reign. Longing for immortality, he farmed with over three hundred people. When Shun made his southern inspection, he stayed at He Hou’s home. The Five Elders of Heaven then told Shun: "Your time of ascension is near." The next day, the Five Emperors descended to welcome Shun, who ascended to heaven in broad daylight. By the time of Yu of Xia, the Five Emperors gave He Hou a vessel of medicine, instructing him to mix it into wine. His entire household of over three hundred drank without exhausting it, and with the leftover wine, they sprinkled their home, which then rose into the heavens. He Hou was appointed an immortal of the Supreme Ultimate. Today, Mount Yi is said to have a temple dedicated to He Hou, beside Shun’s shrine.

**Wenzi**

Wenzi, surnamed Xin and named Ping, also called Jiran, was a native of Pui in Kuiqiu. His ancestors were princes of Jin. He studied the Dao under Lord Lao. King Ping of Zhou (or Chu, in some versions) asked Wenzi: "I hear you received the Way from Lao Cong. Though a worthy man may possess the Dao, if he lives in an age of chaos and seeks to transform a long-corrupted people with the power of one man, how could that be possible?"

Wenzi replied: "Virtue corrects depravity to restore rectitude, lifts disorder to bring governance, and transforms decadence into simplicity and purity. When virtue revives, the world is at peace—this depends on one man. Thus, accumulating virtue leads to kingship, while accumulating resentment leads to ruin. Yao and Shun flourished by this principle, while Jie and Zhou perished by it." King Ping followed his advice, and the realm was well governed.

Later, Wenzi traveled south to Wu and Yue, where Fan Li became his disciple. When Yue planned to attack Wu, Fan Li admonished: "I have heard from my teacher: 'War is an instrument of ill fortune; battle is contrary to virtue; contention is the least of affairs. To plot in secret is to defy virtue, to favor the use of ill fortune, to test oneself in the least of matters—this must not be done.'" Goujian refused to listen and was defeated at Fuchao. Wenzi later held the rank of grand minister but declined the position. He secluded himself on Mount Yu in Wuxing, where legend says he ascended by riding the clouds.

According to *The Universal Geography* and *The Wuxing Gazetteer*, thirty *li* southeast of Yuying stands Jichou Mountain, where the Yue minister Jiran once climbed to survey the terrain—hence its name. Today, on the White Stone Peak of the southern mountain stands the Tongxuan Abbey, his former retreat. The Purple Cloud Pass and Shengyuan Abbey were originally Changqing Abbey, renamed by Emperor Xiaozong of Song during the Qiandao era. Halfway up the mountain lies the "Sunlit Cloud-Riding Stone." Emperor Ming of Tang posthumously honored him as the Perfected of Tongxuan, and his writings are titled *The Scripture of the Perfected of Tongxuan*.

**Kang Cangzi**

Kang Cangzi, surnamed Gengsang and named Chu, was a native of Chen. He attained the Dao of Lord Lao and could see with his ears and hear with his eyes. When Shusun reported this to the Lord of Lu, the ruler was astonished and sent his highest minister with lavish gifts to summon him. When Kang Cangzi arrived, the Lord of Lu humbly inquired, to which Kang Cangzi replied: "The transmission is false. I can see and hear without using my ears and eyes, but I cannot alter their natural function."

The Lord of Lu said: "This is even more extraordinary—what is the principle behind it?"

Kang Cangzi answered: "The body unites with the mind, the mind unites with *qi*, *qi* unites with the formless. With resolute presence and resonant harmony, whether far beyond the eight wilds or near between the brows, I must know it. Yet I do not know how my seven apertures and four limbs perceive, nor how my heart and six viscera comprehend—I simply know of myself."

The Lord of Lu was greatly pleased.

Another account says he lived on Mount Weilei. Those among his ministers who were rigidly knowledgeable departed, and his concubines who were cloyingly kind also left. He lived with the hunchbacked and employed the restless. After six years, Mount Weilei experienced a great exorcism.

Later, he traveled to Wuxing and concealed himself on Meng Peak in Piling, where he attained immortality and departed as a transcendent. Subsequently, during the Han dynasty, Zhang Daoling, and in the Tang, Zhang Guolao, successively withdrew to cultivate the Dao in seclusion, thereby earning the site the name "Zhang Gong’s Altar, Blessed Land." A Cavern-Spirit Abbey was built, which the Song later renamed the Great Longevity Palace of Tai Jia.

Master Fuqiu—styled Fuqiu Bo in his generation—was known as Master Fuqiu. He dwelt on Mount Song to cultivate the Dao and ascended in broad daylight. He once composed the *Song of the Origin of the Dao*, which reads:

The tiger crouches, the dragon too conceals;
The dragon hides only after the tiger yields.
Complete the River Chariot’s work,
And need no embankments to resist.

Disciples seeking flight as immortals
Wander madly, finding no abode.
Left and right, lord and minister align,
Four agents guard and protect in turn.
When Qian and Kun’s model is complete,
The Perfected One will naturally attend.

He also transmitted the *Classic of the Crane’s Physiognomy* to Prince Jin of Wang. Cui Wenzi studied the Dao under Prince Jin, obtained the text, and concealed it in a stone chamber on Mount Song. The Duke of Huainan, while gathering herbs, discovered it and thus transmitted it to the world. The *Classic of the Crane’s Physiognomy* states:

The crane is a yang bird yet roams in yin.
It draws upon metal’s *qi* and rides fire’s essence to nourish itself.
Metal’s number is nine, fire’s seven;
Thus, after seven years, it undergoes a minor transformation;
After sixteen, a major one;
After one hundred sixty, transformation ceases.
At one thousand six hundred years, its form remains pure,
Hence its color is white, its cry heard in heaven.
Its head is red, for it feeds in water;
Its beak is long, for it soars in the vanguard;
Its hind toes are short, for it treads on land;
Its legs are tall and tail sparse, for it wheels through clouds;
Its feathers are abundant and flesh sparse, its throat vast to expel;
Its neck is long to receive the new;
Thus its celestial longevity is immeasurable.
Its body bears neither green nor yellow,
For wood and earth’s *qi* nurture within, not manifesting without.
Therefore, it walks only by islets and shoals,
Rests only among groves and trees.
It is the patriarch of feathered kind,
The unicorn steed of immortals.

The crane’s superior physiognomy features:
A lean head with a vermilion crown,
Exposed eyes with black pupils,
A high nose and short beak,
Cheeks like dice, ears like the *de* of a *ku* vessel,
A long neck and a torso refined as a simurgh’s breast,
Wings like the phoenix’s and feathers like the sparrow’s,
A tortoise’s back and a sea-turtle’s belly,
Front elevated, rear drooping,
A tall neck with primary joints,
A robust viscera and slender toes—
Such are the marks of perfection.
When it cries, its voice reaches heaven;
When it flies, a single lift carries it a thousand *li*.

At two years, the crane’s fledgling down sheds, replaced by black-spotted plumage;
At three, it begins to brood.
After another seven years, its wing feathers are complete;
After another seven, it soars to the Milky Way;
After another seven, its dance accords with rhythm;
After another seven, its cries at the twelve hours of day and night match the pitch pipes.
After another seven, it no longer eats living things;
Its great feathers fall, downy plumage grows,
And it becomes pure white as snow—or wholly black—
Mud and water cannot stain it.
After one hundred sixty years, male and female gaze at each other and conceive.
At one thousand six hundred years, it drinks but does not eat,
And through embryonic transformation gives birth to simurghs and phoenixes,
All becoming drought spirits.
When a sage occupies the throne,
It soars with the phoenix over the royal domain.

In present-day Lizhou, Hubei, there is Solitary Floating Mountain. The *Illustrated Classic* records: "Of old, Master Fuqiu cultivated the Real here. A stone chamber still remains."

Song Laizi was the market overseer during the reign of Duke Zhuang of Chu.

Song Laizi would often sweep the marketplace. Over time, a beggar would appear, lingering there all day, chanting as he begged:

*"Twin blossoms bloom on Heaven’s court,
The mountain’s source reveals yin’s deceit.
At dawn I rein the celestial steed,
And come to the home of the Great Real."*

He repeated these lines as he begged, yet none in the market understood them—save for Laizi, who suddenly grasped their meaning. He suspected the beggar was an immortal but could not decipher the verse. Resolving to follow him, Laizi abandoned his post and pursued the beggar for thirteen years. The beggar then transmitted to him the Dao of the Middle Immortals. Laizi now dwells on Mount Song.

The beggar was none other than Feng Yanshou, Perfected One of the Western Marchmount, who had served as a scribe during the reign of King Xuan of Zhou.

Shen Xi was a native of Wu Commandery. He studied the Dao in Shu, where he could only dispel misfortune and cure illnesses, aiding the common folk. The people’s gratitude for his remedies moved Heaven, and the celestial spirits took note of him.

In the tenth year of King Shen of Zhou (the *bingchen* year), Lord Lao dispatched envoys to summon the hermit Shen Xi. One day, as Xi and his wife, née Jia, rode together to visit their daughter-in-law, Zhuo Kongning, they encountered a procession on the road: a dragon carriage, a tiger carriage, and a white deer carriage, each drawn by a single beast, accompanied by dozens of riders in crimson robes, bearing spears and swords, their radiance filling the path. They asked Xi, *"Are you the Daoist Shen Xi?"*

Startled, Xi replied, *"I am."*

The riders said, *"Xi has served the people with merit, his heart never straying from the Dao. Since birth, his conduct has been flawless. Though his allotted lifespan was brief, his years are now at an end. The Yellow and the Old have sent us, the immortals, to welcome him."*

The attendant Lang Bo rode the white deer carriage; the Transcendent Lord of the Age, Sima Sheng, rode the azure dragon carriage; and the escorting envoy, Xu Fu, rode the white tiger carriage. In an instant, three feather-clad immortals appeared, bearing jade tablets, a green jade scepter, and a vermilion-jade writ, which they presented to Xi through the Attendant of the Azure Vault. Xi could not read the script, and so they bore him away to ascend to Heaven. At that moment, laborers tilling the fields witnessed the scene. Soon, a great mist arose, and when it cleared, Xi and his carriage had vanished—only the ox he had ridden remained, grazing in the field.

Some recognized the ox and informed Xi’s family. His descendants, numbering in the hundreds, feared he had been spirited away by demons into the mountains and valleys. They divided into groups and scoured the land for a hundred *li*, but found no trace of him.

In the first year of Emperor Shang of Later Han (the *bingwu* year), four hundred and twelve years later, he returned to his hometown. His descendants traced the lineage and found his fourth-generation descendant, Huai Xi, who said, *"I have heard our ancestors speak of a celestial forebear. Now that the immortal has returned, he stayed for several days and recounted his first ascent to Heaven. He did not see the Heavenly Thearch but only paid homage to Lord Lao. Lord Lao sat facing east, his palace resplendent, wreathed in clouds of five colors—mystic yellow and dark hues—beyond description. Hundreds of attendants surrounded him, more women than men. In the courtyard stood trees of pearl and jade, clusters of sacred mushrooms, dragons, tigers, and apotropaic beasts. As they wandered among them, only the clamor of bronze and iron could be heard, its meaning unfathomable. The four walls gleamed with talismanic script inscribed upon them. Lord Lao’s form stood nearly ten feet tall, his body radiant, impossible to gaze upon directly."*

Lord Lao commanded a jade maiden to present a golden tray bearing a jade cup filled with elixir, saying, *"This is the divine cinnabar. Whoever drinks it shall not die."* Husband and wife each received a *daogui* measure. After they drank, he gave them two dates, each as large as a chicken’s egg, along with a talisman and a Daoist formula, instructing Xi, *"Return for now to the mortal realm to relieve the suffering of the people. If you wish to ascend to the upper realms, inscribe this talisman and hang it from the tip of a pole, and the immortal officials will come to welcome you."*

With these words, Xi suddenly awoke as if from sleep, finding himself back on earth. When Empress Dowager Dou fell ill, she once sent envoys to summon him. He remained among mortals during the reign of Emperor An, but later ascended to Heaven once more.

Wang Fu, styled Gongque, was a man of Zhou.

Wang Fu, styled Gongque, was a native of Zhou. At fifty, he abandoned his home to study the Dao. He ingested *huanglian* for one hundred and forty years, yet his hearing and vision remained sharp, his wisdom and perception broadened, his white hair turned black again, and his fallen teeth regrew.

He had a son named Shenjing. Both father and son attained the Dao and later ascended to Heaven.

---

Liu Fenglin was a man of Zhou. He studied the Dao on Mount Songgao, where over four hundred years he compounded the divine cinnabar thrice, though each time it was ruined by malevolent spirits. He then entered Mount Weiyu, where he could hold his breath for three days without respite. Though he lived for over a thousand years, he had yet to ascend as an immortal, merely achieving deathlessness through the ingestion of *huanglian*.

---

Master Cheng Lian
Boya studied the zither under Master Cheng Lian, who then traveled with him to Mount Penglai. Leaving Boya behind, he said, *"Practice diligently—I shall return shortly."* The master poled his boat away, and Boya gazed after him, seeing only the vast expanse of the sea, the dark and distant forests, and the mournful cries of birds and beasts. Sighing, he said, *"My master seeks to stir my emotions."* He took up his zither and sang. When the song ended, Cheng Lian returned, and Boya’s playing attained celestial perfection. Cheng Lian was, in truth, an immortal.

The Lord of Mount Wuyi
On Mount Wuyi dwelt a divine being who called himself the Lord of Wuyi, saying, *"I reside upon this mountain, and thus I am named."*

It is also said that when the primordial chaos first parted, a divine figure known as the Holy Matriarch lived here with her child. In the Qin era, the people called her the Holy Matriarch, and the assembled immortals honored her as the Great Matriarch and Holy Mother. Today, those who pray at her temple invoke her as the Great Primordial Lady.

Another account holds that the Original Numinous Lord of Mount Tiantai and the Perfected Immortal Master Hua dispatched their seventh disciple, named Shuren, who rode the clouds astride a crane to survey this mountain and arrange the dwelling places of earthbound immortals. The people of today call him the Crane-Riding Immortal.

Some say that in ancient times, a prince of Wei named Ziqian established his royal city at Tongzhou, ten *li* east of the Great King’s Stone, where the foundations of the old walls still remain. This man was a fallen earthbound immortal who later attained the Dao upon this mountain.

It is further said that twelve seekers—Zhang Zhan, Sun Chuo, Zhao Yuanqi, Peng Lingzhao, Liu Jing, Gu Siyuan, the Master of White Stone, the Master of Horse Neighing, along with four women of the Hu, Li, Yu, and Wang clans—all came to this mountain in search of the Dao. They paid their respects to the Prince of Wei, who acted as their host. At a time of severe drought, the prince, in a state of drunken reverence, offered sacrifices and prayed to the immortals for rain. Then the Crane-Riding Immortal descended from the heavens upon a white horse, bringing a soaking downpour. Zhang Zhan and the others thus beheld him.

Zhang Zhan presented a quatrain to the immortal:

*Beneath Mount Wuyi dwells the Lord of Wuyi,*
*His white horse’s reins trailing into purple clouds.*
*In the empty air, only the three libations of wine are heard,*
*As rain and mist rise over Dragon Pool’s embankment.*

The immortal was greatly pleased by the poem. Observing that Zhang Zhan and the others possessed uncommon bone structure and a precise devotion to the Dao, he sensed that each had a destined share in immortality. He dispatched He Feng’s elder brother to Mount Tiantai to retrieve a scroll of the immortal registers. Upon examining it, he found that all had been banished to the mortal realm as common folk, fated to dwell upon this mountain for eight hundred years before attaining the Dao, undergoing bone-transformation, and returning as celestial immortals.

Once their names were confirmed in the register, he arranged for the Prince of Wei and the twelve others to reside upon the mountain, bestowing upon each a measure of sesame and half a measure of medicinal decoction. The prince then held a feast, where Zhang Zhan sent Yuanheng to play the *jiegu* drum, Peng Lingzhao to play the transverse flute, Gu Siyuan to perform a dance, and Li Sanniang to play the pipa. The gathering ended in joy, and the assembly of immortals dispersed.

The immortal told them, *"After eight hundred years, you may fell the yellow-hearted trees to make coffins. Within these cliffs, you shall undergo transformation, and your souls shall ascend to Heaven."* When the appointed time came, they indeed underwent transformation. Within the Lesser Hidden Cliff, thirteen long coffins were arranged, their wooden supports driven into the rock to suspend their spiritual remains, where they remain to this day.

It is also said that on the fifteenth day of the eighth month in the second year of the First Emperor of Qin, the Lord of Wuyi prepared food and wine and convened the villagers upon Peak of the Tent Pavilion. Over a thousand men and women, having purified themselves, arrived at the appointed time. They beheld a rainbow bridge spanning the stream, its craftsmanship exquisite, with winding staircases and balustrades set along its sides. Light of body and joyful of heart, they felt no weariness as they ascended.

At the mountain’s summit, within the Tent Pavilion’s resplendent halls—hundreds of chambers shimmering in dappled light—eight multicolored banners stood on either side, their silver dragons clutching jade-hemmed pennants, their golden phoenixes adorned with kingfisher plumes. The pavilion could seat over a thousand, with eastern and western seating mats arranged in long rows, much like the stations of monks and nuns today. Green-oiled and red-flowered screens were set before the tables, which stretched from north to south without interruption beneath the pavilion.

On the northern wall at the center stood a hollowed-out forest, called the Jade Throne of the Supreme Ultimate. To its west was another hollowed form, the seat of the Holy Matriarch and Perfected Wei. To the east was the seat of the Lord of Wuyi. Each was adorned with a crimson cloud-mat and a purple mist-cushion, with bronze basins holding flower-scented water.

When the villagers arrived at the peak, outside the pavilion’s gates they heard the sound of drums. Soon, a voice rang out from the void, addressing them all as *"descendants."* It said, *"Let the male descendants enter first through the eastern sequence, and the female descendants follow through the western sequence."*

Then came an announcement: *"The Jade Emperor of the Supreme Ultimate has descended to this mountain retreat. Let the descendants bow in gratitude."* Another voice declared, *"The Holy Matriarch and Perfected Wei—let the descendants bow."* Then, with a cough, the Lord of Wuyi spoke in a loud voice: *"All you descendants, men and women alike, are well and at peace. Let the men sit in the eastern seats, and the women in the western."*

Within the central pavilion hung a green silk canopy, beneath which stood a forest of musical instruments. Another announcement came: *"Let the drum master Zhang Anling strike the leading drum, Zhao Yuanqi the secondary drum, Liu Xiaoqin the bell-drum, Zeng Shaozhong the cluster drum, Qiao Zhiman the clamor drum, Gao Zichun the short drum. Let the flute master Bao Gongxi play the transverse flute, and the clapper master He Feng’er lead the ensemble."* Thus, in the eastern canopy, they performed *"Left Immortal’s Halted Clouds."*

Then came the command: *"Let the zither master Dong Jiaoniang pluck the konghou, Xie Yingfei stroke the long zither, and Lü Hexiang strum the round pipa. Let the next pipe master Gu Zao trill, Bi Yexiu softly play the dongxiao, Zhu Xiao’e play the sheng, and the bronze-cymbal master Luo Miaorong strike the tongbo."* Thus, in the western canopy, they performed *"Right Immortal’s Welcoming Clouds."*

The instruments, though untouched, resounded with wondrous precision. The order was given to serve wine, and in an instant, the wine arrived—no formal thanks were required. The wine was sweet, fragrant, and rich as nectar, accompanied by a hundred rare delicacies, all surpassing the ordinary.

Another round of wine was called for, and the song master Peng Lingzhao was bidden to sing *"Lament for the Mortal World,"* with these words:
*"In heaven above, in the mortal world below—rare are our meetings,
As the sun sinks west and the evening crows take flight.
A hundred years pass in a fleeting moment—hopes and wishes unfulfilled,
The Heavenly Palace so near, yet grief keeps us apart."*

As the song ended, suddenly colored clouds gathered on all sides, and the sounds of jade pendants and horses filled the air. Another announcement came: *"The Jade Spirit Grand Matriarch and the Great Matriarch bid farewell to their descendants—bow twice."* Then it was said: *"You must swiftly descend this mountain. Linger too long, and you will encounter serpents, centipedes, tigers, and leopards—meet them not."*

They descended the mountain, and soon a violent storm arose. When they turned to look back at the summit, not a single trace remained. The villagers called to one another: *"We, so base and mortal, have feasted with the immortals!"* Later, they established a shrine on the mountain, naming it Tongshan.

Attendant Gentleman Liu Kui’s preface states: *"The mountain lies over two hundred li north of Jianning and thirty li south of Chong’an County."* According to the *Inner Records of Master Mao*, *"Among the thirty-six grotto-heavens of the immortals, Mount Wuyi is the sixteenth, the Heaven of Ascended Perfection and Mystic Transformation."*

**Wang Zhangxuan**
Wang Zhangxuan—his origins are unknown. The *Declarations of the Perfected* states he was an attendant gentleman to King Zhuang of Chu, who received the Dao from Master Wang. Having attained the Way, he dwelled in the grotto-chamber of Mount Linwu. Han Chong of Wu, fond of the Dao, traveled famous mountains in search of esoteric arts. On Mount Linwu, he encountered Zhangxuan and sought the Way of transcending the world. Zhangxuan bestowed upon him the *Flowing Pearl Elixir*, saying: *"Practice this path without hindrance to your life in the world. When your merit is complete, you shall ascend as an immortal."* Han Chong’s practice proved greatly efficacious. He served as Governor of Runan, governing for fourteen years with such virtuous rule that his administration was deemed the finest in the realm. At seventy-four, Zhangxuan descended again to teach him the method of *Concealment and Dissolution of Form*. Entering the Great Mount Huo, he further transmitted the *Mud-Pill and Purple Portal* technique, whereupon Han Chong ascended to heaven.

**Han Zhong**
Han Zhong of Deyang County in Hanzhou studied the Dao in the Qinzhong region. The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign bestowed upon him golden script and jade characters, enabling him to ride purple mist wherever he went and ascend to heaven in broad daylight. The *Li Sao* in the *Songs of Chu* says: *"I marvel at Fu Yue’s lodging among the stars,
Envious of Han Zhong’s attainment of the One Form.
Serene and distant, he withdraws from the world of men,
Leaving the vulgar far behind."*

**Wang Cijun**
Wang Cijun was an immortal of ancient times. During the late Zhou and the Warring States period, amid the alliances and rivalries of the age, he secluded himself on Mount Xiaxia in Fanyang. Observing that the seal script of Cang Jie was too intricate for swift use, and that writing was the foremost tool of governance, he transformed the seal and great-seal styles, creating the clerical script.

After Qin Shihuang unified the realm, recognizing the script’s utility, he thrice summoned Wang Cijun to the capital, but Wang refused. The emperor dispatched envoys with this message: *"I have conquered the Six Directions and unified the world—who dares defy me? You, a mere scholar, defy the Son of Heaven’s command. I shall have you carried here in a light chariot. Refuse, and I will kill you, bearing your head back to rectify customs and curb insolence."* The envoys reached the mountain and delivered the decree, loading Wang into the carriage. Suddenly, Wang transformed into a great crow and soared out of the vehicle. The envoys, prostrating in shock, cried: *"If we return without fulfilling our mission, we shall be executed. Pity us, O divine one!"* The crow circled in the sky and plucked out one or two of its own feathers, which the envoys retrieved and presented to the emperor. Qin Shihuang, ever fond of the Way of immortals, was filled with regret upon hearing of the transformation. He named the place *Mount Fallen Feather*, and the locals have worshipped Wang there without cease.

**Ruoshi**
Ruoshi was an immortal of antiquity, his name unknown. Lu Ao of Yan, traveling during the Qin dynasty to the Northern Sea, passed through the Great Yin, entered the Dark Portal, and came to Mount Menggu, where he encountered Ruoshi. His appearance was striking: deep-set eyes and a dark nose, hawk-like shoulders and a long neck, broad above and tapering below. Joyfully, he danced in the wind. Glancing at Lu Ao, he fled and hid beneath a stele. Lu pursued and saw him crouched like a tortoise, eating crabs and clams.

Lu Ao addressed him: *"I alone have wandered, forsaking kin and companions, seeking all beyond the Six Directions. From youth I loved travel, and in age I have not ceased. I have traversed the Four Poles, save only the Northernmost. Now I behold you here—might I call you friend?"*

Ruoshi smiled faintly and said: *"Ah, you are a man of the Central States—how unfitting that you have come so far! This place is as the sun and moon in radiance, as the constellations in splendor. It is a realm beyond naming, like the innermost chamber of a house. Once I roamed south to the Wilderness of Vast Surge, rested north in the Land of Silence, penetrated west to the Chamber of Profound Darkness, and pierced east to the Light of Sudden Illumination. Below, there was no earth; above, no heaven. Gazing, I saw nothing; listening, I heard nothing. Beyond lies the boundless expanse of surging waters, where a single step spans ten thousand miles—yet even this I have not fully explored. You have only just arrived and speak of exhausting all sights—is this not shallow? Still, remain here. I have an appointment with Hanman at the Ninefold Summit and cannot tarry long."*

Then he raised his arms and refined his form, vanishing into the clouds. Lu Ao gazed upward, but seeing nothing, ceased his search—lost in a daze, as though something had slipped away. He sighed: "Compared to this master, I am but a yellow sparrow beside a clod-bound worm. Though I wander all day without leaving a foot’s span, I deem it far—how pitiful! The *Dao in Unity* states: *Lu Ao roamed the Northern Sea and met a transcendent being. When he spoke of exhausting all sights, how truly shallow he was. Yet even that transcendent wandered beyond the Six Directions, with no fixed limit, and still could not fathom its wonders. Later generations will surely have those who surpass Lu Ao—those who grasp a single method, a single art, and mistake it for the great Dao’s emptiness, believing nothing more exists. How shallow indeed!*

The *Dao De Jing* says:
*Look and it cannot be seen—call it the Subtle.
Listen and it cannot be heard—call it the Rare.
Grasp and it cannot be held—call it the Minute.
These three cannot be further questioned,
for they merge into One.
Above, it is not bright;
below, it is not dark.
Endless, unnameable,
it returns to nothingness.
This is called form without form,
image without image—
this is called the Vague and Elusive.*

That transcendent being nearly approached the Dao. O ancient man of resolve!"

Xu the Great and Master Yin Xu traveled together to Mount Song and Mount Hua. Beneath the pines, they encountered an ancient man and a woman. The two gentlemen asked, "How have immortals come to this place?"

The ancient man replied, "I was a laborer of Qin, and this Lady Mao was a palace woman of Qin. Both of us were conscripted laborers who escaped the disaster of Mount Li. We have hidden here ever since, unaware of how many cycles of sixty years have passed."

The two gentlemen said, "Fortunate to meet great immortals, we humbly seek the elixir of gold and the great medicine."

The ancient man said, "I was originally an ordinary man. At first, I consumed cypress seeds, then ate pine resin. Over the years, I ascended into the void, and my hair turned green as if forged. But I know not what the elixir of gold or the great medicine truly is."

Lady Mao recited a poem:
*Who knows what was ancient is not what is now,
Leisurely treading blue mist around emerald peaks;
The flute pipes of Qin towers must be still,
While floating clouds vainly cling to my vine-woven robe.*

The ancient man said, "There is pine resin of ten thousand years and cypress seeds of a thousand years. You may consume them, and you too shall transcend the world."

Later, the two gentlemen dwelled upon Lotus Flower Peak.

—Yanmenzi

Yanmenzi achieved the Dao through liberation by corpse-transfiguration. His tomb lies in Dili County of Yuyang, while his true self now resides in the Golden Court of the Great Cavern of Mount Meng, where he received scriptures and was appointed as the Middle Prime Immortal Minister. Yanmen is none other than Xianmen.

When Master Purple Yang, Zhou Yishan, heard of the elixir and that the master had attained the Dao on Mount Meng and could recite the *Dragon Hoof Scripture*, he pursued him there. Upon Mount Meng, he encountered Xianmenzi riding a white crane, holding a feathered canopy, and bearing a jade tally adorned with green plumes, attended by over ten jade maidens. Yishan then prostrated himself and kowtowed, entreating the essential secret of longevity. Xianmenzi replied, "Your name is already inscribed in the Cinnabar Terrace and Jade Chamber—what fear is there of not becoming immortal? You have crossed rivers and mountains to ascend here—what more do you seek?"

Shen Wentai
Shen Wentai was a native of Jiuyi. He obtained the method of the Crimson Spring Divine Elixir and the Way of Earth Talismans for prolonging life and enhancing destiny. Having verified its efficacy through ingestion, he journeyed to Kunlun. He remained in Anxi for over two thousand years before transmitting the teachings to Li Wenyuan, saying, "Earth Talismans alone, without ingesting medicines or practicing the Dao, are of no benefit." Wenyuan then received the esoteric essentials and later ascended as an immortal. Thereafter, the methods of decocting elixirs with bamboo-root sap and the Yellow and White Arts for expelling the Three Worms originated from these two men.

Dong Ye
Dong Ye, styled Zhongxuan, was a native of Yuyi in Wudu.

In his youth, he was fond of learning and often roamed mountains and marshes, carrying books on his back. Finding them cumbersome, he gathered tree leaves at home to replace bamboo slips, for they were easier to roll. He once worked as a hired herdsman and at times gathered firewood to sell. He would encounter books in the wild, all transformed by spirits and gods, and would copy them onto scrolls. Unrestrained and refusing office, he wandered among butcher shops. Sometimes he begged for dog or sheep skins to wear, and his dwelling was no larger than what could accommodate his knees. He carved wood into shapes and slept on piles of animal fur. In summer, he slept exposed on grass and rocks. At one hundred and ninety years of age, his hair and beard remained like that of a child. He appeared and vanished unpredictably, sometimes riding an ox or donkey, sometimes wearing straw sandals. His home lay three hundred *li* from Chang’an, yet he could reach it in less than a day. He often rested at people’s homes, writing on his palm, and upon returning home, transcribed it onto slips. Thus, the words on his palm and paper were few, but his diligence wore his tongue black and his palm raw. The world called him "one who studies with his tongue and records with his palm."

He despised the clamor and chaos of the world and wrote tens of thousands of words expounding his doctrines. He blamed the followers of Zhou and Confucius for misleading later generations, twisting and distorting ritual and music, causing many to lose their true nature. He said: "Man, endowed with the five constant *qi*, is the finest of all creatures. Naturally, he understands ritual and music—why must he be taught and have his emotions restrained? Fu Xi, the Yellow Emperor, Tang Yao, Yu of Xia, and Tang of Yin were supreme sages, while Zhou and Confucius were merely men of broad learning. Why do I say this? Fu Xi hunted birds and beasts to fill his kitchen, yet later understood the harm of raw and rank odors. The Yellow Emperor taught people to ride boats, yet later they built houses to dwell in. The three sages—Tang Yao, Yu of Xia, and Tang of Yin—could regulate floods, dispel droughts, and rid people of harm. But Zhou and Confucius forcibly bound people with ritual and confused them with music. When music reaches its extreme, sorrow deepens; when ritual becomes excessive, chaos ensues—neither is the great principle of governing a state."

Emperor Wu of Han, hearing of his unconventional ways, summoned him to the Western Capital. Their conversations were profound and harmonious. Later, none knew where he had gone.

Li Chong

Li Chong was a native of Fenglan. He claimed to be three hundred years old, having followed the First Emperor of Qin to Mount Kuaiji, where he gazed upon the rivers and seas. In his youth, he loved learning and became an erudite, with ten thousand disciples. When Master Fu was ten years old, he studied the *Book of Documents* with Chong in a stone chamber, who transmitted it orally to Fu’s son. The affairs of four generations were preserved without omission. Fu’s son, in turn, recited it, tying a rope of over ten *xun* around his waist—each recitation knotting it once—until the entire rope was filled with knots. He recited it tens of thousands of times. Yet he said that eating grain harmed one’s essence and wisdom, leading to forgetfulness. Of the hundred chapters now transmitted, only one remains; the *Canons of Yao and Shun* are largely lost.

During the Han era, Chong often consumed chrysanthemums and tree sap. When asked why he did not speak, he would remain silent for ten days or more, saying: "In this world, there is nothing worth eating, nor anyone worth speaking to. My spirit roams freely, gathering the essence of clouds and the nectar of dawn. Only my heart remains—how could I speak? I fear it would merely weary my spirit and move my tongue."

The Emperor, hearing of his divine peculiarities, summoned him. Chong arrived wearing a straw cloak and carrying a basket, bearing the *True Forms of the Five Peaks* on his back. The Emperor received him with ritual courtesy and also styled him "Master of the Borne Chart."

Meng Qi
Meng Qi was a reclusive gentleman of Qinghe.

Seeking masters, he shunned no peril or hardship. Having lived seven hundred years, he recalled events from the early Zhou as vividly as if they lay before his eyes. Some say: he once saw the Duke of Zhou holding King Cheng in audience at the ancestral temple of Zhou, while Qi stood by as the Duke ascended the altar. When the Duke mounted the steps, Qi reached out to brush King Cheng’s feet; the Duke then bestowed upon him the royal ornaments. Qi treasured them always, often dusting the bamboo case with his sleeve—its edges now sharp enough to snap.

He once consumed cassia leaves and gathered herbs at the foot of Mount Huayin. Hearing the Emperor favored immortals, he emerged from the wilds. **Guo Qiong**

Guo Qiong was a man of Dongfang Prefecture. Though his appearance was coarse and unremarkable, his bearing surpassed others. Leaning on a staff, he wandered at will. Whenever he lodged in a household, he would beg for firewood to light his way, reading through the night without rest. Once, a host possessed secret apocryphal texts and weft prophecies, sealed tightly in rattan. Yet Qiong had already learned of them and read them all—none failed to marvel at his uncanny ability. When word spread that Qiong sought lodging, households would bolt their doors and block their gates; any forbidden books were burned before they dared admit him, fearing he might uncover their secrets.

Qiong often carried a bamboo tube from which he drew a handful of counting rods, scattering them before his knees to divine a household’s hidden affairs. At times, he would walk abroad by day without closing his eyes, leaving no trace, his chest bared like a madman. Emperor Wu of Han esteemed his singular gifts.

Yellow An was a man of Daijun. He claimed himself lowly and unworthy to dwell among others, wielding a whip to clear brambles while reciting texts and tracing characters upon the earth to tally his words. One night, the ground beneath him turned into a pool; when he moved elsewhere the next day, the same occurred. The people of his time called this "plowing with the tongue." Though over eighty years of age, he appeared as a youth. He constantly ingested cinnabar, his entire body turning crimson, and wore no clothing. He sat upon a divine turtle, three feet wide.

People once asked him, "How many years have you sat upon this turtle?"
He replied, "Long ago, when Fuxi first crafted nets and traps, this turtle emerged from the sea to bestow itself upon me. Its back is seven spans flat. This turtle fears the light of sun and moon, emerging its head but once every two thousand years—I have already witnessed it emerge five times. When I walk, I bear a dragon upon my back, and the world calls me ten thousand years old."

Emperor Wu of Han, hearing of his extraordinary traces, summoned him to discourse on emptiness. Finding no talk of immortals or transcendents, the Emperor grew displeased. Later, during the Feng and Shan sacrifices at Mount Tai, Yellow An rode in the same carriage as Dongye, Li Chong, Meng Qi, and Guo Qiong—together they were called the Five Immortal Ministers. After the Emperor’s passing, he departed, and none knew his whereabouts.

Royal Chuiping

Royal Chuiping, also known as Lanxi of Danxi, was a native of that region. At the age of fifteen, while tending his family’s sheep, a Daoist priest, observing his goodness and prudence, took him to a stone chamber in Mount Jinhua. For over forty years, he remained there, utterly untroubled by thoughts of home.

His elder brother, Chuqi, had long searched for him in vain. Later, encountering a Daoist skilled in divination at the marketplace, he inquired, “My younger brother was herding sheep when he vanished over forty years ago. I know not whether he lives or has perished—would you divine his fate for me?” The Daoist replied, “I once saw a Royal Chuiping in Mount Jinhua. Could he be your brother?” Hearing this, Chuqi was overcome with joy and followed the Daoist to seek his brother. There they found him, and the brothers embraced in tearful reunion.

After speaking, Chuqi asked, “Where are your sheep?” Chuiping answered, “Just east of the mountain.” Chuqi went to look but saw nothing—only heaps of white stones. He returned and said, “There are no sheep east of the mountain.” Chuiping replied, “The sheep are there—you simply cannot see them.” The brothers went together, and Chuiping shouted, “Sheep, arise!” At once, the white stones all rose and transformed into tens of thousands of sheep.

Chuqi said, “My brother alone has attained the Dao of divine transcendence—can I learn it as well?” Chuiping replied, “Certainly, if you cultivate the Way earnestly, you may achieve it.” Thereupon, Chuqi abandoned his wife and children, remaining with Chuiping to ingest pine resin and fuling. After fifty thousand days, they could sit or stand at will, vanish or reappear, cast no shadow at noon, and their complexions retained the freshness of youth.

They returned together to their hometown, but by then, all their relatives had long since passed away. They departed once more, and before leaving, Chuiping taught his methods to Nan Bo Feng, changing his name to Red Pine Master. Chuqi altered his courtesy name to Luban, while Chuiping took the name Pine Master. Thereafter, dozens of others who consumed this elixir attained transcendence.

Mount Jinhua now lies within Weizhou. There, stone sheep remain visible to this day. Some say it was Cloudyang Mountain in Chaling, where Yellow Chuiping, known as Red Pine Master, dwelled on the southern slopes of Mount Heng. In that place, pines towered ten thousand feet high.

Shen Jian

Shen Jian was a native of Danyang.

His family had long served as local officials, yet Shen Jian alone loved the Dao and refused to enter public service. He studied the arts of *daoyin* and *fushi*, the methods for restoring youth and reversing aging. He was also skilled in treating illness—no matter how slight or severe, those who saw him were cured. Thousands of households revered him.

Whenever he traveled afar, he would entrust three to five servants, a donkey, and several dozen sheep to a host, giving each a single elixir pill. He would instruct the host, saying, "Simply provide them shelter; do not trouble yourself with food." Then he would take his leave. The host would be greatly perplexed, thinking, *"This gentleman has left over fifteen servants and animals in my care, yet not a single coin—what am I to do?"*

After Shen Jian’s departure, the host would offer food to the servants, but they would recoil at the scent, retching and refusing to look at it. When grass was given to the donkey and sheep, they too would avoid it, even turning aggressive toward people. The host was astonished. Yet after a hundred days, the servants’ bodies grew radiant, their complexions surpassing those of well-fed men, while the donkey and sheep became plump and vigorous.

Three years later, Shen Jian returned. He gave each servant, donkey, and sheep another elixir pill, and they resumed eating as before. Thereafter, he ceased consuming grain entirely, able to lift his body and fly, departing and returning at will. He lived in this manner for over three hundred years before vanishing without a trace.

Hua Ziqī

Hua Ziqī was a native of Huainan.

Master Shi Jiaoli received the esoteric *Lingbao* formulas from a mountain recluse: the first called *Flying Turtle Rite of the Yi and Luo*, the second *White Yu’s Correct Mechanism*, and the third *Balanced Alignment*. When taken together, they reversed aging day by day. He could walk five hundred *li* in a day, lift a thousand *jin*, and shed his skin ten times in a year. Later, he ascended as an immortal, and the mountain where he dwelled was named Mount Ziqī, now part of Jianning Prefecture.

Wang Yuan

Wang Yuan, styled Fangping, was a native of Donghai. He was nominated as a *xiaolian* and appointed Gentleman of the Palace, gradually rising to the rank of Grand Master for Splendid Happiness. Well-versed in the Five Classics, he also mastered astronomy, apocryphal texts, and the essentials of the *He* and *Luo* diagrams, enabling him to foresee the rise and fall of the realm and the fortunes of the Nine Provinces. Emperor Huan of the Han, having heard of him, repeatedly summoned him, but he refused to appear. The court then had local officials compel him to the capital by carriage. He kept his head bowed and mouth shut, declining to respond to the imperial decree. Instead, he inscribed over four hundred characters on the palace gate panels, all foretelling future events. The emperor, displeased, ordered the writing erased. The outer characters vanished, but the inner ones reappeared, the ink having seeped deep into the wood.

Fangping never returned. His descendants and fellow villagers transmitted his deeds for generations. Chen Dan, the Grand Commandant of the same commandery, built a chamber for him, bowing in reverence morning and evening, seeking blessings and wishing to study the Dao. Fangping stayed in Dan’s household for over thirty years. During this time, Dan’s family knew no illness, death, or misfortune; their servants and maids were at peace, their livestock multiplied, their fields and silkworms yielded severalfold, and their official ranks advanced. Later, Fangping told Dan, “My destined time to depart has come. I can no longer stay. Tomorrow at noon, I will leave.” When the hour arrived, Fangping died. Dan, realizing he had transformed and departed, dared not place the body on the ground. He wept and sighed, saying, “Master, you abandon me—what shall I rely on?” He prepared a coffin, burned incense, and dressed the body in its robes. After three days and nights, the body suddenly vanished, its clothing and belt undisturbed, like a cicada’s molted husk.

Over a hundred days after Fangping’s departure, Dan passed away. Some said Dan had attained Fangping’s Dao and transformed as well; others claimed Fangping, knowing Dan’s end was near, had simply left him behind.

Fangping later entered Mount Kuocang, passed through Wu, and visited Cai Jing’s home in Xumen. Having attained the rank of immortal, he became the Perfected One of the Western Citadel in the Western Extremity, commanding fifteen thousand immortals and governing the Nine Immortals’ Treasure Chamber of Mount Qingcheng. The *Tujing of Zhongzhou* states: “The Yu Temple and Jingde Abbey were once called the Immortals’ Palace, the mountain where Wang Fangping of the Former Han attained the Dao. In the first year of Xianping of Emperor Zhenzong of Song, it was bestowed with one hundred twenty volumes of imperial calligraphy; in the first year of Jingde, it received its present name.”

Cai Jing

Cai Jing was a commoner, yet his bones were such that he was destined for immortality. Fangping, recognizing this, visited his home—now the site of Cai Jing’s residence in Pingjiang Prefecture—and said to him, “Your fate is to transcend the world, so I have come to recruit you for the immortal bureaucracy. However, you are young and lack understanding of the Dao. With too little *qi* and too much flesh, you cannot ascend to heaven and must undergo *shijie* (corpse liberation). It will be as if passing through a dog’s burrow.” He imparted essential teachings and then departed.

Later, Cai Jing suddenly felt his body burning like fire, craving water to douse himself as if quenching something scorched. After three days, his bones dissolved entirely. He entered his chamber, covered himself with a blanket, and vanished. When his family looked beneath the blanket, they found only his skin, head, and feet intact, like a cicada’s shed husk.

Over ten years after his departure, he unexpectedly returned home. Though he had left aged, he now appeared youthful and robust, his hair entirely black. He told his family, “On the seventh day of the seventh month, Lord Wang will visit. Prepare several hundred *hu* of wine to serve his retinue.” He then left. His family followed his instructions, borrowing jars and brewing hundreds of *hu* of wine, arranging them in the courtyard to await his arrival.

On the appointed day, Fangping indeed arrived. Before reaching Cai Jing’s home, the sound of drums, flutes, and pipes filled the air. As he drew near, all were astonished, unsure of what approached. Upon arrival, Cai Jing’s entire household saw him. Fangping wore a *yuanyou* cap, a vermilion robe, a tiger-headed satchel, a multicolored sash, and a sword. His complexion was yellowish, his beard sparse, and his height average. He rode a carriage with five canopies, drawn by five dragons, each of a different hue. Preceded and followed by banners, standards, and an entourage befitting a grand general, he was accompanied by twelve companies of five hundred soldiers each. Their mouths were sealed with beeswax, and their musicians rode qilin, descending from the heavens rather than traveling by earthly roads.

Once they arrived, the attendants vanished, leaving only Fangping seated. After a moment, he summoned Cai Jing’s father and brothers. He then sent a messenger to inquire after Lady Ma Gu, though none knew what deity she was. The message read: “Wang Fangping respectfully reports: I have long been absent from the mortal realm. Now that I am here, might the Lady deign to visit briefly?” Shortly after, a reply came, though the messenger remained unseen. It said: “Ma Gu bows. Though we have not met, five hundred years have passed in an instant. With due reverence for hierarchy, I have long been troubled by your absence. Hearing you are here, I should come in person. However, I have just received a summons to inspect Penglai. I will go briefly and return, at which time I shall pay my respects. I hope you will not depart immediately.”

After two such exchanges, Ma Gu arrived, her approach also heralded by the sound of men and horses. Upon arrival, her retinue was half the size of Fangping’s. When Ma Gu appeared, Cai Jing’s entire household saw her—a beautiful woman of about eighteen. Her hair was coiled atop her head, the rest cascading to her waist. Her garments bore patterns, yet were not of brocade or silk; their radiance rivaled the sun, and their names were unknown, for they were unlike anything in the world.

She entered and bowed to Fangping, who rose to his feet in return. Once seated, each was served a feast. Gold platters and jade cups held dishes mostly of various flowers, their fragrance filling the inner and outer chambers. As they broke the dried meats to share, one resembled cypress-roasted flesh—it was, they said, the jerky of a qilin. Ma Gu herself remarked: “Since I began attending the immortals, I have witnessed the Eastern Sea transform into mulberry fields three times. Recently, when I visited Penglai, the waters were shallower than before—perhaps half their former depth. Could it soon become dry land?” Fangping smiled and said: “The sages all say that even the seas will one day stir up dust.”

Ma Gu wished to see Cai Jing’s mother and his wife, but his wife had recently given birth mere days before. Ma Gu caught sight of her and knew at once, saying: “Ah, stay back for now.” She asked for a handful of rice, then tossed it to the ground. Where the grains fell, they turned to cinnabar. Fangping laughed: “Ma Gu still plays youthful games. I am old now and no longer delight in such clever transformations.”

Fangping addressed Cai Jing’s family: “I wish to offer you wine, but this wine comes from the celestial kitchens. Its flavor is rich and sweet, unsuited for mortals—it may even corrode your innards. I shall dilute it with water, so do not be alarmed.” He mixed one *dou* of water with one *sheng* of wine and served it to the household. After drinking about one *dou*, they all grew drunk. When the wine ran out after some time, Fangping told his attendants: “It is not enough—fetch more.” He gave a string of cash to an old woman from Yuhang to buy wine. Soon, a messenger returned with an oilskin bag containing about five *dou* of wine. The old woman relayed: “I feared earthly wine would not suit your refined taste.”

Ma Gu’s fingernails did not resemble human hands—they were like a bird’s talons. Cai Jing thought to himself: “If my back itches, these claws would be perfect for scratching.” Fangping, already aware of his thoughts, had someone drag Cai Jing away and flog him, saying: “Ma Gu is a divine being. How could you think her claws suitable for scratching your back?” Though the whip struck Cai Jing’s back, no one holding it was visible. Fangping told Cai Jing: “My whip is not to be taken lightly.”

A neighbor of Cai Jing’s family, surnamed Chen, whose given name is lost, had once served as a magistrate. Hearing that divine beings were at Cai Jing’s home, he came to the door, kowtowed, and begged to meet them. Fangping brought him forward and spoke with him. The man then asked to serve as an attendant, like Cai Jing. Fangping said: “Stand and face the sun.” From behind, Fangping observed him and said: “Ah, your heart’s needle is not true. I cannot teach you the Dao of immortality. Instead, I shall grant you the office of an earthly overseer.” Before leaving, he placed a talisman and a manual in a small box and gave it to Magistrate Chen, saying: “This will not grant you transcendence, but it will extend your life. Your natural lifespan is already a century. You may use it to ward off disasters and cure illnesses. If a patient’s fate is not yet exhausted and they bear no grave transgressions, they will recover when you bring the talisman to their home. If malevolent spirits or blood-consuming ghosts cause harm, command the local earth deities to seize and deliver them. Judge each case with discernment.” Magistrate Chen used the talisman to heal the sick with great success, and hundreds of households sought his aid. He lived to be one hundred and ten before passing. After his death, his descendants used the talisman, but it no longer worked.

After Fangping departed, the several hundred *hu* of wine left in Cai Jing’s courtyard vanished, though no one was seen drinking it. Cai Jing’s parents privately asked him: “Where does Lord Wang usually reside?” Cai Jing replied: “He often governs Kunlun, traveling between Mount Luofu and Mount Kuocang. All three mountains have palaces, and Lord Wang regularly oversees the affairs of the celestial bureaus. In a single day, he journeys to and from the heavens dozens of times. The life and death matters of the Five Peaks on earth are all first reported to him. He travels only by riding a yellow qilin, his procession solemn. Wherever he goes, the spirits of mountains and seas come to pay homage, some even hailing him along the way.”

Decades later, Cai Jing briefly returned home to visit. Fangping sent a letter to Magistrate Chen. The characters were bold and large, though not in standard script. Before this, no one knew Fangping’s name, but word spread from afar, and many came to learn of it. Magistrate Chen’s family still preserves Lord Wang’s handwritten letter and the small box containing the talisman and manual to this day.

**She Zheng**

She Zheng, styled Xuanzhen, was a native of eastern Ba.

During the reign of the First Emperor of Qin, his deeds were as vivid as if one had witnessed them firsthand. By the end of the Han dynasty, She Zheng entered Mount Hao with twenty disciples, yet he kept his eyes closed at all times—even while walking, they remained shut. His disciples followed him for twenty years without ever seeing him open his eyes. One disciple persistently entreated him, so She Zheng finally opened them. When his eyes opened, a sound like thunderclap erupted, and a light like lightning flashed, striking his disciples, who all unconsciously prostrated themselves. Only after a long while could they rise, by which time She Zheng had already closed his eyes again.

After attaining the Dao, no one witnessed what he consumed or practiced, yet he taught his disciples to cultivate qi through breath control, abstain from the bedchamber, and ingest cinnabar and mineral elixirs. It was said that Li Babai called She Zheng a "four-hundred-year-old child."

Your servant Daoyi remarks: The *Daodejing* states, "The five colors blind the eye," and "The sage acts for the belly, not for the eyes." Ancient immortals also said, "The hun resides in the liver, not in the leaking eyes," and "Close your eyes to see your own vision." If one can guard the spirit within and not be swayed by external things, then even Mount Tai before one’s eyes will go unseen. Now, She Zheng kept his eyes closed even while walking—was this not to embody the sage’s principle of acting for the belly, not the eyes, and to spiritually instruct his disciples? Later Dao seekers should awaken to this.

**Sun Bo**

Sun Bo was a native of Hedong. Gifted with literary talent, he composed poetry in a hundred verses and recited tens of thousands of words of scripture. In his later years, he studied the Dao and mastered the arts of Mozi, enabling him to make plants, trees, metal, and stone all burst into flames, illuminating dozens of *li* around. He could also turn his body into fire and exhale flames from his mouth. Pointing at a tree would ignite it, scorching its leaves to withered crispness, but pointing again would restore it. Thus, he could also cause an entire army to form separate clusters of fire.

A man from the region had lost a slave who was hiding among the troops. After days of searching in vain, the slave’s master sought Sun Bo’s help. Sun Bo said, "I will set their camp ablaze, and the slave will surely flee. You need only watch carefully and seize him." Thereupon, Sun Bo hurled a red pellet into the military encampment. In an instant, flames soared to the heavens, and the slave indeed fled, whereupon he was captured. Sun Bo then threw a green pellet into the fire, and it immediately extinguished. All the charred houses and objects within were restored to their original state.

Whenever Sun Bo kindled fire to burn something, even if others doused it with water, it could not be quenched—only when he himself ceased did it stop. When crossing vast waters, not only did his own body remain dry, but he could also keep those with him from getting wet. Moreover, he could spread mats upon the water, sit with others to drink and feast, and have them dance atop the waves without sinking or getting drenched, reveling joyously all day.

Those afflicted with illness sought him out for healing. Without any elaborate methods, he merely pointed at them and declared their recovery, and they were cured. When he entered mountain cliffs or boulders on the ground, his back and ears would remain visible in the stone for a time before he vanished entirely. He could also swallow dozens of swords and pass through walls as if they had openings. He could bend mirrors into blades and straighten blades into mirrors, maintaining their altered forms for extended periods until he pointed at them to restore their original shapes.

Later, he entered the forests of Mount Linlü, where he compounded the divine elixir and ascended as an immortal.

**Ban Meng**

Ban Meng’s origins are unknown.

Some say she was a woman. She could fly and remain aloft all day. She could also sit in empty space and converse with others, or enter the earth—first her feet would vanish, then her waist, then her chest, until only her headdress remained visible, and after a long while, she would disappear entirely. She could pierce the ground with her finger, and a spring or well would form, from which water could be drawn. She could also inhale the tiles from people’s rooftops, causing them to fly into her home. If a household had thousands of mulberry trees or fruit trees, she could gather them all into a mound like a mountain; after ten or so days, she would blow on them, and they would return to their original places as before. She could also spread paper before her, chew ink, and spray it onto the page—whereupon the paper would fill with writing, each character bearing meaning. Later, she consumed wine and elixirs, and at the age of four hundred, her appearance grew youthful again. Finally, she entered the Great Cold Mountain and departed as an immortal.

**Wang Gang**

The Heavenly Gate Master’s surname was Wang, and his given name was Gang. He was particularly versed in the secrets of nourishment and cultivation. Thus, his classic states: *"Yang arises at the hour of yin (3–5 a.m.), the essence of pure Wood; Yin arises at the hour of shen (3–5 p.m.), the essence of pure Metal. When Wood is cast against Metal, it is invariably harmed—thus Yin exhausts Yang. Women adorn themselves with powder, emulating Metal’s whiteness. Therefore, true persons and Daoist adepts must focus their minds and refine their intentions, mastering the subtle and discerning the flourishing and declining. I move as the Azure Dragon, while she moves as the White Tiger; I seize the Vermilion Bird, while the Dark Warrior advances before me—this is the Way of immortality."*

It also states: *"A woman’s nature is more urgent than a man’s in desire, yet outwardly she restrains herself, unwilling to solicit the Yang—this reveals Metal’s refusal to yield to Wood. The Yang nature is fierce and impetuous, its will and conduct careless; yet in social gatherings, its voice softens, its words grow humble—this reveals Wood’s awe of Metal."*

Having mastered this Way, Wang Gang lived to two hundred and eighty years of age, retaining the complexion of a maiden. He then ingested the Pearl Elixir, attained immortality, and departed for the Dark Continent.

**Huang Hua**

The Nine Spirits Master’s surname was Huang, and his given name was Hua. He attained the essentials of rejuvenation, embryonic breathing, and inner vision, as well as the Way of the Five Phases. His classic states: *"This art can repel weapons, deter tigers and wolves, safeguard one’s body, protect one’s household, ensure the prosperity of descendants, and harmonize inner and outer realms. Those who see you will rejoice; those who do not will long for you. It is fitting for soldiers and beneficial for travelers."*

Those who scheme against one are dissolved before their plots take shape; a thousand calamities and ten thousand misfortunes lie dormant, never arising. The paths of treachery and deceit are blocked, the gates of malevolent spirits sealed. Those who curse you find their curses unfulfilled; those who cast hexes see their sorcery undone. All worthy men under heaven come to revere you, winning the favor of divine spirits and the hearts of the common folk. Fields yield abundant harvests, silkworms thrive, the six livestock multiply, servants remain loyal to their households, and illnesses are cured. Officials release their grievances, legal disputes are resolved in your favor, and every endeavor prospers. Those who devote themselves to this Way in their generation attain its profound wonders, living over five hundred years with ever-youthful countenances. Later, refining the elixir, they ascend as immortals and depart.

**Yin Heng**

The North Pole Master’s surname was Yin, and his given name was Heng. His classic states: *"The Way of cultivating the body treasures the love of spirit; the art of nurturing nature is to die into life and emerge anew. By practicing this constantly, one becomes as enduring as heaven. Seeking life through life, one attains true life. Forging iron with iron is called truth; refining man with man is called spirit."* Later, he ingested the Divine Elixir and departed as an immortal.

**Li Xiu**

The Peerless Grotto Master’s surname was Li, and his given name was Xiu. His classic states: *"The weak can overcome the strong; the yin can subdue the yang. Ever as if treading deep abysses or perilous heights, guiding a galloping steed or a speeding chariot—this is the Way of longevity."* He lived over four hundred years with an undiminished complexion.

Yan composed forty scrolls, titled *The Origin of the Dao*. He ingested the Returning Elixir and ascended to heaven.

**Liu Rong**

The Master of the Southern Pole’s surname was Liu, and his given name was Rong. He could hold powder in his mouth and form it into parrot chicks, spitting out dozens at a time. When boiled and eaten, they were indistinguishable from real parrot chicks. The remaining powder in his mouth, no larger than a fingertip, could be placed in a cup and enchanted, transforming into a turtle. When boiled, it became edible, with fully formed organs and entrails, while the cup turned into a turtle shell. Once the meat was removed, the shell reverted to a cup. Water enchanted by him became fine wine, intoxicating those who drank it. With a wave of his hand, he could conjure a great tree; if someone broke off a small branch to use as a roof beam, it would remain intact for days before gradually withering, no different from real wood. He ingested the Cloud-Frost Elixir and departed as an immortal.

**Ge Yue**

The Master of Yellow Reed’s surname was Ge, and his given name was Yue. He was highly skilled in healing illnesses. Even when patients were a thousand *li* away, he could cure them simply by receiving their names—there was no need to see the afflicted in person. He was adept in the arts of qi restraint, able to immobilize tigers, wolves, and all manner of insects, prevent birds from taking flight, and even reverse the flow of water for a *li*. At the age of two hundred and eighty, he could lift a thousand *jun* and run as swiftly as a galloping horse. Above his head, a five-colored qi often rose over a *zhang* high. During times of great drought, he could descend into deep pools, summon dragons to emerge, and urge them to ascend to the heavens to bring rain. He performed this feat repeatedly. One day, he bid farewell to his relatives and friends, mounted a dragon, and departed, never to return.

**Liu An**

Liu An, the Prince of Huainan, was the grandson of Emperor Gao of Han. He was fond of Confucian scholarship and esoteric arts, composing the *Inner Book* in twenty-one scrolls and the *Hongbao Wannian* in three volumes, expounding on the Dao of transformation. Eight elders came to visit him, and the gatekeeper, seeking to test them, said: "Our prince desires three things: first, the Way of extending life and reversing aging; second, a great scholar versed in broad learning, profound wisdom, and subtle principles; and third, a warrior of immense strength, capable of lifting tripods and braving death in battle. Yet you gentlemen are all advanced in years—you lack the art of annotating texts, the vigor of Meng Ben and Xia Yu, and the ability to master the Three Canons, Five Classics, Eight Compilations, and Nine Anthologies, to delve deeply and reach far, to exhaust principles and fulfill nature. Since you fall short in all three, I dare not announce your arrival."

The elders laughed and replied: "We have heard that the prince reveres worthies and cherishes scholars, sparing no effort in seeking even the humblest talent. The ancients valued the learning of the Nine-Nine, nurturing even barking and howling retainers, truly wishing to purchase a horse’s skeleton to attract unicorns, to emulate Master Guo to summon fine scholars. Though we are unworthy, we do not match your prince’s requests, yet we have come from afar to meet him. Even if we offer no benefit, we shall do no harm. Why do you obstruct us with such prejudice? If the prince insists on seeing only the young as those with the Dao and dismisses the gray-haired as mediocrities, this is hardly the way to strike stone to obtain jade or plumb the depths to seek pearls. You slight our age, yet we are still young at heart."

As they finished speaking, the eight elders transformed into youths of fifteen, their hair loose and temples dark, their complexions like peach blossoms. The gatekeeper, startled and trembling, rushed to inform the prince. Upon hearing this, Liu An did not even pause to put on his shoes but hurried out barefoot to greet them. He led them to the Terrace of Thoughtful Immortality, where he arrayed curtains of brocade, set out ivory couches, burned incense of a hundred fragrances, presented tables of gold and jade, and donned his disciples’ slippers. Facing north, he clasped his hands and said: "Though I possess only mediocre talent, I have long cherished the Dao and virtue. Yet shackled by worldly duties and mired in vulgar customs, I have been unable to cast off my burdens and roam free in the mountains and forests. Still, day and night, I hunger and thirst for the divine, cleansing myself of filth and sincerely reforming my frivolity. My pent-up longing remains unfulfilled, as distant as clouds and mud. I never imagined such great fortune—to have the Dao Lords deign to visit. This is my destiny, to be lifted from obscurity. Overwhelmed with joy and fear, I know not what to do. I only beg the Dao Lords to take pity and instruct me, that I may borrow wings like a cicada grub and soar from the earth."

The eight elders then reverted to their aged forms and said to the prince: "Though our knowledge is shallow, we have mastered the teachings of our predecessors. Knowing of your devotion to the Dao, we have come to follow you. We do not yet know what you desire. One of us can summon wind and rain at will, conjure clouds and mist in an instant, draw rivers on the ground, and pile mountains from handfuls of earth. Another can level heights and fill abysses, herd tigers and leopards, summon dragons and serpents, and command spirits and ghosts. Another can split his form and alter his appearance, sit yet vanish, stand yet disappear, conceal entire armies, and plunge daylight into darkness. Another can tread the void and walk the skies, rise from the sea and soar through mist, enter and exit without hindrance, and breathe across a thousand *li*. Another can enter fire without burning, enter water without getting wet, remain unharmed by blades or arrows, feel no cold in winter or sweat in summer. Another can transform endlessly at will, turning birds, beasts, grasses, and trees into being in an instant, and shifting mountains, rivers, and peaks. Another can avert disasters and transcend calamities, ward off evil and repel harm, extend life, and attain longevity. Another can smelt mud into gold, forge lead into silver, refine the Eight Minerals with water, make pearls fly and flow, ride dragons and drive clouds, and roam the Great Clarity. Whatever you desire, my prince, we can provide."

Thereafter, Liu An paid homage to them morning and night, offering fruit and wine. He first begged them to demonstrate their arts, and their transformations of wind, rain, clouds, and mist all proved effective. They then bestowed upon him the *Classic of the Elixir* and thirty-six formulas involving mercury, but before the medicine was completed, Liu An’s son, named Qian, who was fond of swordsmanship and considered himself unmatched, was sparring with the courtier Lei Bei. Bei accidentally struck Qian, who flew into a rage. Bei sought to join the campaign against the Xiongnu to atone for his offense, but Liu An refused. Fearing Qian would kill him, Bei submitted a memorial to the emperor. At that time, Han law decreed that any feudal lord who obstructed the passes or mobilized forces against the Xiongnu would be sentenced to death. Liu An was to be executed, but Emperor Wu, who had always respected him, merely stripped him of two counties.

When Lei Bei and Wu Bei had long been close, Wu Bei had also incurred Liu An’s wrath through illicit dealings, though Liu An had not yet acted on his anger. Fearing execution, Wu Bei falsely accused Liu An of plotting rebellion. The emperor dispatched the Minister of the Imperial Clan bearing the imperial tally to investigate Liu An. The Eight Perfected addressed Liu An, saying: “You may depart now—this is Heaven’s way of sending you forth. Do not hesitate.” Thereupon, Liu An ascended the mountain with them to perform a great sacrifice, burying gold in the earth before ascending to heaven in broad daylight. The stones trodden by the Eight Perfected and Liu An sank beneath their feet, and to this day, traces of their footprints and hoofprints remain. *The Treatise on Geography* states: “Mount Bagong lies north of the Fei River and south of the Huai, where the Prince of Huainan and the Eight Perfected dwelled before ascending to heaven in daylight. It now belongs to Shou Prefecture.” Another account claims this is not so, but rather the place where Fu Jian saw grasses and trees transformed into soldiers. Mount Bagong bears the “Resting Stones of the Eight Perfected of Huainan.” In Han times, it belonged to Jiujiang Commandery; today, it lies southwest of Lai’an County in Di Prefecture. Yet another account says that atop Mount Bagong stands a temple to Prince Liu An of Huainan, now within the boundaries of Chaoxian County in Wuwei Prefecture.

The Eight Perfected told Liu An: “Though the celestial envoy has come, Wu Bei, as a minister, has falsely accused his lord and father. Those whose names are recorded in the registers of immortals—any who conspire against them shall die, and any who offend them shall be destroyed. Wu Bei now faces execution.” When the Minister of the Imperial Clan arrived, Liu An was nowhere to be found. Upon inquiry, they were told: “The Prince has departed as an immortal.” The emperor, hearing this, was filled with regret and subtly instructed the Commandant of Justice, Zhang Tang, to indict Wu Bei for devising the rebellion on Liu An’s behalf. Both Wu Bei and Lei Bei were then executed by extermination of their clans, just as the Eight Perfected had foretold. The Han historians concealed the truth, unwilling to speak of divine transcendence lest later emperors neglect state affairs in pursuit of immortality. Thus, they claimed Liu An had taken his own life. Another version says that Liu An ascended to heaven with the Eight Perfected, leaving behind his alchemical cauldron; his parrot and dog licked the residue and likewise ascended, the parrot crying in the clouds and the dog barking in the heavens. Yet another account states that Liu An obtained the *Hongbao* and *Wannian* arts of immortality, departed as a transcendent, and was enfeoffed as the Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate.

**Liu Tu**
In the third year of *Yongchu* of Emperor An of Han (119 CE), on the *jiyou* day of the second month, the Venerable Lord descended upon Mount Tai. He dispatched the Feathered Messenger of Mount Tai with chariots and cavalry to summon Liu Tu, a virtuous man of Jiangxia, intending to have him collate the registers of all under heaven. When Liu Tu arrived, he saw the Venerable Lord seated facing south upon the throne, the Lord of Mount Tai seated facing east and west, the Nine Celestial Perfected seated facing south and north, and the Lords of the Eight Directions seated facing west and east. Liu Tu was commanded to collate the celestial registers of all under heaven alongside the officials, a task completed in three days. The Venerable Lord, wishing to demonstrate to Liu Tu the karmic retribution of sin and blessing, ordered the Feathered Messenger to escort him to the Heavenly Palace. There, he beheld the Golden Terrace and Jade Hall of the Grand Pure Palace, where music arose spontaneously, and the transcendent beings, clad in azure robes and bearing golden tablets, chanted the scriptures. After the visitation, he was sent back. Through this, Liu Tu attained the Dao, became a Daoist, and later departed as an immortal.

**Jie Jiu**
Jie Jiu’s origins are unknown. He traveled to Mount Fang in Jian’an, where he studied the Dao of the Mysterious Unity under Master White Sheep, Du Bi. He mastered transformation and concealment, often accompanying his master into the Eastern Sea. Passing briefly through Wu, its ruler Sun Quan treated him with reverence and built a quiet hall for him. Jiu visited several times a day, and Sun Quan sent attendants to inquire after his well-being. Jiu would appear now as a youth, now as an old man, ate nothing, and refused all gifts. When Sun Quan sought to learn his arts of protection, Jiu declined, saying that Sun Quan’s inner chambers were not conducive to transmission. Enraged, Sun Quan had Jiu bound in armor, tied to a crossbow, and shot. When the arrows were loosed, only the ropes remained—Jiu had vanished without a trace.

Minister Dao Yi remarked: “The Dao within a person is tranquil, silent, empty, and formless—serene, unadorned, and plain. Sensual pleasures cannot sway their resolve, nor can fame and profit muddy their hearts. How could Sun Quan, of all people, be worthy of discussing the Dao? By this time, Jie Jiu had already attained the Dao, mastering transformation, concealment, and the reversal of aging to youth. Truly, he could ‘enter an army without fearing weapons.’ Yet Sun Quan, in a moment of anger, sought to kill him—how base! As the *Daodejing* says: ‘Blades find no place to pierce—why? Because there is no ground for death.’ Let scholars take heed.”

Dragon Shu

Dragon Shu’s origins are unknown. On Mount Jin, he obtained the divine *lingzhi* fruit, the size of a phoenix tree seed. Refining and consuming it, he took a knife-tip’s measure daily. After two years, he achieved immortality through *shijie* and departed.

The *Zhenji Ying* states: Long Bogao was a man of the Later Han. When General Ma Yuan of the Han’s Fubo Army admonished his brother’s son, he praised this man as exemplary and worthy of emulation—this was he. Later, Bogao studied the method of ingesting *qi* for embryonic transformation under the immortal Diao Daolin. He also regularly consumed the "Green Hammer Elixir," feigning drunkenness to conceal his form, and vanished into Fangtai, where he became a disciple of Master Dinglu.

A note clarifies: Bogao’s given name was Shu, a native of Jingzhao. During the Jianwu era of the Han, he served as magistrate of Shandu, and when Ma Yuan, then governor of Lingling, campaigned in the south, he wrote to his brother’s son Yan, saying: “Long Bogao is sincere, circumspect, and prudent; his words are without fault. Humble and frugal, he is upright, impartial, and commanding. I cherish and esteem him—may you and your peers emulate him. Even if you fail to match Bogao, you will still become a man of disciplined conduct, like one who carves a swan but falls short yet still resembles a wild goose.”

Zhao Bing

Zhao Bing was a native of Dongyang in the Later Han.

Having wandered far and wide, he once chanced upon an old acquaintance. Drawing water, he transformed it into wine; shaving a single oar, he fashioned it into dried meat. Both drank their fill and ate to satiety. On another occasion, arriving at a ferry crossing and finding no boat, he spread his mat upon the water and sat, borne across by the wind. He could also chant incantations over withered trees, causing them to burst into bloom and leaf.

Zhe Xiang

Zhe Xiang, styled Boshi, was a native of Guanghan. From youth he devoted himself to the study of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi. Later, he became a disciple of Master Yushuya of Dongping, who had likewise attained the Dao. Xiang was steadfast in the pursuit of nurturing life, maintaining a profound silence. Though his family was wealthy, he believed that amassing riches brought no benefit. He distributed a thousand gold pieces to relieve the poor and suffering. When some admonished him, Xiang replied: “As Dou Ziwen once said, ‘My bestowal of goods is to flee misfortune, not to shun the times.’” Those who understood him all admired his wisdom. On the day he knew he would depart, his body dissolved like a snake shedding its skin.

Wang Yao

Wang Yao, styled Boliao, was a native of Poyang. He had a wife but no children. He was skilled in healing the sick, and none failed to recover under his care. He performed no sacrifices, used no talismanic water or sealed medicines. When treating illness, he would simply spread an eight-foot cloth upon the ground and sit, neither eating nor drinking. After a short while, the patient would recover, and he would rise and depart. If malevolent spirits caused affliction, Yao would draw a prison on the ground, summon them, and all would appear in their true forms within—foxes, lightning serpents, and the like. He would then behead them, burn the corpses, and the patient would immediately recover.

Yao possessed a bamboo basket several feet long. A boy surnamed Qian carried it on a nine-jointed bamboo staff, and when they set out, even in the rain, neither Yao nor his disciples were touched by the wet. At dusk, two torches would often light their way. After traveling some thirty *li*, they would ascend a small mountain and enter a stone chamber. Inside, two men were already present. Upon arrival, Yao took the basket from his disciple, opened it, and removed five bamboo flutes and three reed pipes. He played one himself, giving another to each of the two men in the chamber, and all three played together. After a long while, Yao took his leave. The three flutes were returned to the basket, which the boy Qian carried. The two men in the chamber saw Yao off, saying: “You should have come sooner. Why linger so long in the world of mortals?” Yao replied: “I have come as I am.” A hundred days after returning home, one night the sky again rained. Yao lit a lamp, prepared his belongings, and donned a hempen robe and headscarf he had not worn in over fifty years. His wife asked: “Are you leaving me?” Yao said: “Only for a short while.” She wept and pleaded: “Stay a little longer.” Yao replied: “If so, I shall return.” Over thirty years later, his disciples saw Yao again in the mountains of Ma’er, his complexion as youthful as before. He had already become an immortal.

Chen Yongbo

Chen Yongbo was a native of Nanyang.

Chen Yongbo obtained the Seven Stars Powder formula from the Prince of Huainan. After preparing and consuming it for twenty-one days, he suddenly vanished without a trace. Yongbo had a nephew named Zengzu, aged seventeen, who also took the powder. His father struck his feet and confined him in a sealed chamber, stationing guards to watch him day and night. After twenty-eight days, he too disappeared, gone without a trace. The original formula stated that one would attain immortality after thirty days of ingestion, yet the two Chen youths vanished before the thirty days were complete, so later generations dared not take it. When immortals depart, immortal officials must come to welcome them—it is only that mortals cannot see them.

Liu Zheng

Liu Zheng was a native of Peiguo. Gifted and erudite, he studied all branches of knowledge. Profoundly reflecting that worldly glory and honor are but fleeting, he deemed the pursuit of the Dao the only path to longevity. Thus, he abandoned all ambition for advancement and sought the arts of nurturing life. Diligently seeking rare knowledge, he traveled a thousand *li* without hesitation, and if he encountered someone superior to himself, even a servant or retainer, he would take them as his teacher. Later, he studied the *Mozi’s Five Elements Record* and also ingested the Vermilion Essence Pill. At over one hundred and eighty years of age, his complexion remained that of a child. He delighted in transformations and concealment, able to multiply one body into a hundred, a hundred into a thousand, and a thousand into ten thousand. He could also conceal an entire army, turning men into a grove of trees, or into birds and beasts. If he took another’s belongings and placed them elsewhere, no one would notice. He could cultivate fruit trees, making their blossoms and fruits edible, and conjure a traveling kitchen to serve hundreds. With a breath, he could summon wind, flinging sand and stones; pointing at houses, mountains, forests, or vessels would make them tremble as if about to collapse, but pointing again would restore them. He could transform into a beautiful woman or a wooden figure, traversing thousands of *li* in a single day. With a sigh, water became clouds; with a wave of his hand, mist arose. He could heap soil into mountains or pierce the earth to create abysses. He could shift between old and young, large and small. He walked through water without getting wet, strode upon its surface, and summoned fish, turtles, jiao-dragons, and giant sea turtles from rivers and seas to come ashore. From his mouth, he exhaled five-colored qi spanning ten *li*, rising to connect with the heavens. He could leap hundreds of *zhang* into the air, and later, his whereabouts became unknown.

Wang Qiao

Wang Qiao was a native of Wuyang in Jianwei. In Wuyang stood Mount Beiping, located 147 *li* south of Yizhou, towering 1,300 *zhang* high. At its summit grew a white toad, called the "flesh zhi," which granted longevity to those who consumed it. Only those with the bone structure of immortals could obtain it. Qiao, devoted to the Dao, faced the mountain in reverence for over a decade. His devotion moved the mountain, and he was able to eat the zhi. His body became light, his strength doubled, and he could run as swiftly as a galloping horse. Later, he served as magistrate of Boren and attained the Dao on Mount Dongguan. Today, Wuyang has a shrine to Immortal Qiao. There were three men named Wang Qiao: Prince Jin of the Crown, Magistrate Qiao of Ye, and the flesh-zhi-eating Wang Qiao of Shu, who was a divine immortal of the region.

Cheng Junping

Cheng Junping was a native of Changsha Commandery.

At the age of fifteen, his elder brother sent him to herd geese and sheep. Suddenly, he encountered an immortal elder who took him into Mount Shuhua. Later, his brother searched and found Junping in the mountains. Asking where the geese and sheep he had been herding were, Junping pointed to white stones and said, "These are they." He then drove them to rise, bidding them follow his brother. After ten days, they returned to the foot of the mountain and transformed back into stone. These stones remain to this day, and the mountain was thus named Mount Eyang. This mountain lies twenty *li* north of Changsha County. Originally called Mount Shuhua, it is also known as Mount Shibao. At its summit stands an immortal’s altar and cinnabar dragon. Bi Tian’s poem reads:

*In what year did the feathered guest refine the elixir here?*
*Still, the empty turtle shell guards the crumbling cliff.*
*In the clouds, the immortal’s parrot and hound must remain;*
*Below the mountain, the geese and sheep turn to stubborn stone.*
*How many times has the Xiang’s islets seen the sea transform?*
*No more does the city of Liaoyang see Lingwei return.*
*In what year will the immortal’s chariot come again?*
*Then all shall be sent soaring through the Nine Passes.*

Ding Yue

The extraordinary Ding Yue concealed himself among the ranks of soldiers.

Vei Ziwei became his disciple. One day, he took his leave. As he departed, he said to Ziwei: "Sir, you have attained the Dao, yet two layers of dust still separate you."

*End of Scroll Five of* A Comprehensive Mirror of Perennial Immortals Who Embodied the Dao

*Scroll Six of* A Comprehensive Mirror of Perennial Immortals Who Embodied the Dao

**Lord of the East**
The Lord of the East is also called the Earl of the East or the King Father of the East. He is the primordial essence of the Azure Yang and the progenitor of the ten thousand spirits. He wears a crown of triple ascent and robes of nine-hued clouds and mist, and is also known as the Jade Sovereign Lord. He dwells within the chambers of clouds, with purple clouds as his canopy and azure clouds as his city. Immortal youths stand in attendance, and jade maidens scatter incense. His true officials, immortal companions, and celestial friends number in the billions, each with their appointed duties, all receiving his command. Thus, those men who attain the Dao have their names recorded in his register. Their merits and deeds are assessed, then reported to the Primordial Beginning, who conveys the decree to the Lord Lao.

Another account states that the Lord of the East is the Azure Lad, governing Mount Fangzhu in the Eastern Sea.

**Ninefold Primordial Master**
The Ninefold Primordial Master refined purple gold and compounded the divine elixir to ascend as an immortal. His scripture is titled *The Scripture of Geng and Xin*.

**Supreme Yellow Master**
The Supreme Yellow Master cultivated the Way of pacing the Dipper and attained the method of concealment. He could render himself invisible.

**Master Everborn**
Master Everborn regularly rinsed his mouth with water mixed with jade fragments and consumed it to ascend.

**Master Everlasting**
Master Everlasting perfected the Dao and became the Immortal Earl of the Dark Continent.

**Master Zhang Mu**
Master Zhang Mu cultivated the Supreme Ultimate and ascended as an immortal in the first year of the *Nianji* era. Later, he transmitted this method to Gong Shujin, Wang Wenqing, and Yin Zifang, all of whom attained the Dao.

**Master Gaoqiu**
Master Gaoqiu was a man of the Yin dynasty.

He was devoted to the Dao and entered the Six Radiant Mountains, where he lived for over five hundred and twenty years, studying only the *Yellow and White Scripture of the Dao*. He consumed wood-based elixirs, later compounded the *Vast Cinnabar*, and thereby attained terrestrial immortality, wandering among the Five Peaks for over two hundred years. Later, he obtained the *Golden Liquid* and ascended to the Great Clarity. Today, he serves as the Perfected One of the Central Peak. The *Declarations of the Perfected* states: "His tomb lies in Wenxi County of Zhongshan." The annotation clarifies: "Zhongshan has a Nüxi County; Wenxi belongs to Hedong."

**Master Pu**
Master Pu often rode a white deer to gather magic mushrooms on Mount Mao.

**Master Everchild**
Master Everchild studied the Dao on Mount Di, where he cultivated the *Scripture of Bathing and the Contracting Bell* and attained immortality.

**Elder of the Nine Springs**
The Elder of the Nine Springs serves as the Lord of the Fangzhang Palace, overseeing all water spirits of the world, as well as the yin-essence water creatures such as dragons and whales.

**Master Wanqiu**
Master Wanqiu ingested the *Regulating Destiny Pill* and attained the Dao. By the end of King Tang of Yin’s reign, he had already lived over a thousand years. He transmitted the method to his disciple Jiang Ruochun, who, after three hundred years of practice, appeared no older than a fifteen-year-old child. Peng Zu’s teacher studied under him and received three of his formulas.

**Master Green Crow**
Master Green Crow was a disciple of Peng Zu. Having received the teachings of an enlightened master and mastered the subtle principles of immortality, he entered Mount Huayin to study the Dao. After 471 years, he underwent twelve trials, failing three. Later, he ingested the *Golden Liquid* and ascended to heaven. The Supreme Ultimate Dao Lord deemed that, having failed three trials, he was but an immortal and not a *Perfected One*.

**Master Longhair**
Master Longhair often went bareheaded and singing:
*"Silken gold, silken gold,
Enter the Gate of Heaven.
Call forth the long essence,
Draw the Dark Spring.
Sound the Celestial Drum,
Nurture the Cinnabar Field."*
The Archivist of the Pillars heard this and said: *"The words Master Longhair sings embody the Way of ingesting the Five Stars and guarding the Grotto Chamber."*

**Cai Qiong**
Cai Qiong, styled Boyao, studied under Laozi and received the *Tai Xuan Yangsheng Fu* and the *Returning Cinnabar Formula*. Through their combined practice, he attained the Dao and ascended to heaven in broad daylight. He often used the *Yangsheng Fu* to revive the dead—so long as their bones remained, casting the talisman upon them would restore them to life.

**Liezi**
Liezi was a native of Zheng, surnamed Lie and named Yukou. He sought the Dao from Master Guan Yin, then studied under Master Huqiu Zilin, and later under Master Lao Shang. He befriended Master Bogao Zijin. After nine years of practicing the Way of these two masters, he could ride the wind and rain. His disciple Yan Hui asked: *"When you speak of seeking the Dao, is it for wealth?"* Liezi replied: *"Jie and Zhou valued profit over the Dao and thus perished."* He once lived in seclusion in the Zheng gardens for forty years, unknown to others. After attaining the Dao, he composed a book titled *Liezi*, which circulated in the world.

During the Tang dynasty, Emperor Xuanzong posthumously bestowed upon him the title *Master of Serene Emptiness*, and his book was titled *The True Classic of Serene Emptiness*. During the Song dynasty, Emperor Huizong honored him as *Perfected Lord of Profound Mystery*.

**Zhuangzi**
Zhuangzi was a native of Song. His surname was Zhuang, given name Zhou, and courtesy name Zixiu. Born in Meng County of Suiyang, he studied the Dao of the Old Master. During the reign of King Hui of Liang, he served as the keeper of the lacquer garden in Meng County but, considering the position too base, refused to take office. King Wei of Chu sent envoys bearing jade and silk to summon him, wishing to appoint him as prime minister. Two grand officers were dispatched ahead, saying: *"We wish to burden you with the cares of our land."* Zhuangzi was fishing on the banks of the Pu River, holding his rod and ignoring them. He replied: *"I have heard that in Chu there is a divine turtle, dead for three thousand years, which the king keeps wrapped in silk and stored in a shrine. Would this turtle rather have died to leave its bones honored, or lived to drag its tail through the mud?"* The two grand officers said: *"It would rather live and drag its tail through the mud."* Zhuangzi said: *"Go your way. I shall drag my tail through the mud."*

Later, the King of Song sent envoys to summon Zhuangzi. Zhuangzi said: *"Have you seen the sacrificial ox? It is clothed in embroidered robes and fed with fine grain. Yet when it is led into the great temple, though it might wish to be a lonely calf, could it ever be so?"* He urged them: *"Leave quickly, lest you defile me. How could I be shackled by those who rule states?"* Thus, he never again took office.

Later, having attained the Dao, he composed a book titled *Zhuangzi*. The *True Records* states: *"Zhuangzi studied under Master Chang Sang, receiving his esoteric teachings, and was thus called Zhuangzi."* He concealed himself in Mount Baodu, consumed the *Northern Nurturing Fire Elixir*, ascended to heaven in broad daylight, and was appointed as an editor in the *Taiwei* Bureau. A note below clarifies: *"Master Chang Sang was the teacher of Bian Que, as recorded in the *Wei Annals* and the *Records of the Grand Historian*."* If the world truly knew Zhuangzi as such, his book would be all the more revered.

During the Tang dynasty, Emperor Xuanzong posthumously bestowed upon him the title *Master of Southern Florescence*, and his book was titled *The True Classic of Southern Florescence*. During the Song dynasty, Emperor Huizong honored him as *Perfected Lord of Subtle Wonder and Primordial Penetration*.

**Liu Yue**
During the Zhou dynasty, there was a Master Kuang named Xu who cultivated the Dao on Mount Nanzhang.

Later, a young man visited him several times, his words and discourse extraordinary and grand. The Master found him remarkable and asked, "I have long heard of your noble conduct—may I inquire as to your hometown and name?" The youth replied, "I am Liu Yue, dwelling to the left of this mountain. Below the peak stands a stone, roughly two feet high; knock upon it, and it shall invite you in." The Master followed his instructions and struck the stone, whereupon it suddenly parted, revealing a cavernous entrance. A young attendant with side-locks greeted him, leading him forward for several dozen paces. Then, two maidservants in azure robes, bearing crimson staffs, guided him onward. Gradually, pavilions and terraces came into view, their jade and gold hues shimmering in contrast, while rare birds and strange beasts roamed amidst exotic grasses and trees. A Perfected One, crowned with a jade diadem and girded with a vermilion sash and sword, came forth to welcome him. The Master wished to remain, but the Perfected One, sensing his intent, said, "Your hidden merits will soon be fulfilled; our reunion is not far off, and there will be time enough to follow me another day." He offered three cups of jade wine and a sip of the *Longevity-Preserving Elixir*, then sent him forth. When the Master turned to look back, the stone he had struck appeared just as it had before. On another day, he knocked again, but there was no response.

At present, outside the three gates of the Tai Ping Xing Jin Palace on Mount Lu stands a pavilion built of stone, named *Immortal Stone*. Upon the stone, the characters "Liu the Immortal" remain inscribed.

**Wang Guo**
Wang Guo was a worthy man of Chu. Disgusted by the filth of the world and the clamor of fame and profit, he retreated into the mountains and forests, cultivating stillness and withdrawal in all his conduct. One day, he rode away upon a cloud.

**Master Guigu**
Master Guigu was a man of the time of Duke Ping of Jin. His surname was Wang and his given name Ling; his place of origin is unknown. He received the Dao from the Old Lord. Entering the Cloud Qi Mountains to gather herbs and concoct elixirs, he attained the Dao through ingestion, his complexion like that of a young boy. He dwelled in Ghost Valley of Green Creek, whence his sobriquet.

Su Qin and Zhang Yi sought the Dao from the Master. The Master said, "Hearing the Dao is easy; cultivating the Dao is difficult. As your minds are still entangled with worldly concerns, you may study the art of persuasion to suit the needs of the present age. You will surely become ministers of state, but you will not escape death as ministers." If they were unafraid, he would transmit the teachings. The two men requested instruction, and after three years, they took their leave. The Master said, "You two have forsaken the eternal longevity of the pine and cedar for the fleeting glory of a single day—what a pity!"

Later, he sent them a letter, saying: "Gentlemen, you have toiled with four-horse chariots, your achievements and fame resplendent, the Nine Provinces bowing in reverence. Yet like spring blossoms that wither by autumn, your glory cannot long endure. Your allotted days draw to a close, and your time nears its end. Have you not seen the trees by the river? Horses and carriages break their branches, waves erode their roots—such is the fate of those who dwell in such places. Have you not seen the pines and cypresses of Mount Song and Mount Tai, or the catalpa and sandalwood of Hua and Huo? Their leaves and trunks reach the azure clouds, their roots penetrate the Three Springs, enduring for a thousand autumns and ten thousand years, untouched by axe or blade.

**The Fox and the Reviving Herb**
Once, a silver fox died of plague. A crow, like a raven, placed a blade of grass over its face, and the fox revived. The matter was reported to the throne, and the First Emperor of Qin dispatched envoys bearing the grass to inquire of the Master. The Master said, "In the vast sea lie the Ten Isles. On Ancestral Isle grows the herb of immortality, sprung from the midst of jasper fields, also called *yangshen zhi* (Spirit-Nourishing Mushroom). Its leaves resemble wild rice but do not grow in clusters; a single stalk can revive one person."

The Master dwelled among men for several hundred years, after which his whereabouts became unknown.

Some say that Ghost Valley lay in Yangcheng, south of Mount Song. **Mao Meng**—styled Chucheng—was a native of the southern gate of Xianyang. He was the great-great-grandfather of Ying, the Minister of Destiny of Shuqing, and a disciple of Master Ghost Valley. He entered Mount Hua to cultivate the Dao, later ascending to heaven in broad daylight, riding clouds and driving dragons. Earlier, a song had circulated in his village:

*"The immortal attained is Mao Chucheng,
Who rides dragons aloft into the Grand Clarity,
At times descending to Dark Continent to sport at Red Citadel.
Those who follow in his line shall be my kin—Ying.
If you would learn, emulate him on the feast of Jiaping."*

When the First Emperor of Qin heard this, he renamed the La festival *Jiaping*, in hopes of attaining immortality.

**Lord Ximen** was a man who from youth cherished the Dao and mastered the apocrypha and weft texts. He presented the *Chart of Mountain Opening* to the First Emperor of Qin, who failed to heed it.

**Xu Fu**, styled Junfang, was of unknown origin. During the reign of the First Emperor of Qin, many in Dayuan perished unjustly by the roadside. Frequently, crows resembling ravens would appear, placing blades of grass over the faces of the dead, who would revive at once. Xu Fu took the grass to inquire of Master Ghost Valley of Beiguo, who said it was the *Spirit-Nourishing Mushroom* from Ancestral Isle. The First Emperor then believed it could be sought and obtained. He sought out the most sincere Daoists and found Xu Fu, dispatching five hundred boys and five hundred girls—some say three thousand each—who set sail in towered ships to search for Ancestral Isle. They never returned, and their fate remains unknown. Later, when Shen Xi attained the Dao, the Yellow Emperor and Laozi sent Xu Fu as an emissary, arriving in a chariot drawn by white tigers. Thus, later generations knew that Xu Fu had attained the Dao.

The *Supplement to Biographies of Immortals* records: During the Kaiyuan era of the Tang, a scholar suffered from half his body withering and blackening. The imperial physician Zhang Shangke and others could not save him. His family gathered and said, "With a body in such a state, how can it long endure? We have heard that in the great sea dwell divine immortals. Only by seeking their arts can this illness be cured." His clan tried to dissuade him, but he would not be stopped. He took provisions and an attendant to the shores of the great sea near Dengzhou. There, they encountered an empty boat, which proved to be what they had brought. They hoisted the sail and followed the wind. After more than ten days, they neared a solitary island where several hundred people stood as if in audience. Soon, they reached the shore, where a woman was washing herbs. They asked who those people were, and she pointed, saying, "The white-haired one seated in the center is Lord Xu." They asked who Lord Xu was, and she replied, "Do you know of Xu Fu from the time of the First Emperor of Qin?" They said, "We do." She said, "This is he."

After a moment, the crowd dispersed. The scholar then disembarked to pay his respects, recounting his circumstances in full and seeking medical treatment. Lord Xu said, "Your illness—encountering me means you shall live." He first fed him a broth and rice, the vessels all strangely small. The scholar found the portions meager, but Lord Xu said, "If you can finish this, it will be a fine measure—though I fear you may not." The scholar ate continuously, consuming several bowls' worth until he was full and could eat no more. Lord Xu then gave him a small vessel of wine, which he drank until drunk.

The next day, Lord Xu gave him several black pellets to eat, after which he passed several *dou* of black fluid, and his illness was cured. The scholar asked to stay and serve him, but Lord Xu said, "You have an official position awaiting you; it is not yet fitting for you to remain. I shall send you back with a gust of wind—do not worry about the distance of your return journey." He then gave the scholar a pouch of yellow medicine, saying, "This medicine is effective for all ailments. If you encounter someone ill upon your return, you may administer it with a *daogui*."

The scholar returned, reaching Dengzhou in a few days. He presented the medicine to the court, and Emperor Xuanzong ordered those who were ill to take it—all were cured.

**Guo Sichao**
Guo Sichao was a man of Yan during the Zhou dynasty.

Guo Sichao and his three brothers studied the Dao together, with Sichao as the eldest. During the Qin dynasty, he attained the Dao and came to reside south of Gouqu Mountain. Where he lived, he built embankments to dam the streams, deepening the waters, and raised walls and dikes—traces of which remain discernible today. As *Zhengao* records: "Before his dwelling lies a pond, which was constructed by Guo Sichao." He heightened the banks, ensuring the water grew deep. Yet over the long passage of ages, the pond’s walls have crumbled.

A note adds: The present dwelling seems to be the residence of Secretary Xu, before which there is indeed a pond. To the west stands a dike, which dams the waters of Liuji—though this lies far from Guo Qian’s location. Guo Qian dwells northwest of the Northern Grotto, where a great reservoir now exists. Sichao likely first resided there, though the meaning of "before his dwelling" remains unclear; perhaps Secretary Xu later established fields by the reservoir. Further explanations follow.

Sichao would often drift upon the pond in a small boat, striking the gunwale as he sang:

*"A limpid pool girds the numinous peaks,
Long forests lush with verdant green.
Dark birds conceal themselves in secluded wilds,
While awakened words flow with ease.
Beating the oars, I ride the divine waves,
Bowing my head in hope of the Dawn Wind—*
*(Here, ‘Dawn Wind’ refers to the jade breeze of the Upper Clarity, not the feathered creature of the *Mao Odes*.)
*Yet the hour of liberation eludes me,
And I wander carefree amid the wooded hills.
The waves surge beyond the Nine Abysses,
As I refine the Dao and preserve my true nature.
I tuck away these spirit-phoenix wings,
Concealing my radiant dragon scales.
The inch within my breast soars high,
While myriad breaths all turn to dust.
I pity the morning-born clam and toad,
For who can exhaust your chariot wheels?*
*(The favor of women knows no bounds, nor the love of men ever tires of their wheels—here, the morning-born clam and toad serve as metaphors for the fleeting nature of mortal life.)
*Roaming the void, I let my spirit soar,
Treading the formless with phantom steps.
The round sun gleams with radiant mist,
As the Nine Phoenixes sing at dawn’s first light."*

I spread my wings to fan the Celestial Ford,
Shrouding the auspicious clouds in flight.
Thus I arrive at the Great Tenuity’s halls,
Embracing this golden pear nectar.
Roaming beyond the Dark Abyss,
Neither existing nor perishing—
*(The Dark Abyss and Nine Abysses denote realms beyond the Eight Extremities, atop the Nine Radiant Mists.)*
I ascend in flight to the Wood Star,
Also called the Dark Luminance, the easternmost of the Yang Abysses,
*(As the transcendent Lu Ao once declared: “I have made tryst with Hanman beyond the Nine Abysses.”)*
I mount the reverent dance of the Divine Empyrean,
Arrayed in radiance, girded with the Nine Suns.
The August Emperor’s dragon carriage aligns,
And I arrive at the Northern Flower Chamber.
The divine tiger stirs the jade grove,
As fragrant winds merge into one.
I unseal the gates of the hidden dark,
Where numinous transformations draw near to the mystery of annihilation.

*(Four served as Jade Terrace Bearer of the Canopy,
Hence the phrase “the August Emperor’s dragon carriage aligns.”)*
*(It is further said: In the true Dharma, those who serve the Three Offices for six hundred years without transgression are elevated in rank. When Four’s term ended, he was promoted to Left Immortal Duke of the Nine Palaces, overseeing the Jade Terrace Bearers of the Canopy—a post long vacant until Sihe succeeded him.)*
The mountain abides among the people,
And to this day a level marsh is called “Guo Thousand,”
For Four’s surname lingers on the lips of the folk.
Year after year, whenever Four journeyed forth,
He would pass through this place to visit Sihe,
Roaming the plains and hills.
*(A note below states: This is the Central Plain of the Mao tradition.)*
*(By this account, Guo Thousand was merely a place of cultivation, not a dwelling. His residence was the Prefect’s estate, which proves correct. Today, the embankments have crumbled, the central waters no longer grand, and all regard it as mere farmland. Yet the land remains broad and slightly dammed, still forming a pool where one might row a boat and sing. But none can trace the footsteps of that distant age—how lamentable! Later it is said: Even after Four’s promotion, he still yearned for his former home, often passing through to feast in the Eternal Constancy and gaze fondly upon his companions.)*

**Zhou Taibin**
Zhou Taibin was a Daoist of the Qin era.
He studied the Dao with Jiang Shumao,
Dwelling on Gouqu Mountain,
Where he cultivated the five fruits and five pungent herbs,
Selling them to purchase cinnabar.
To this day, the mountain is thick with chives—
The legacy of his planting—
Now called Chive Mountain,
West of Great Mao Peak, where great chives abound.
Elsewhere, too, garlic, lotus roots, and water chestnuts grow,
For Chive Mountain and Jiangba are one and the same.
Both attained immortality.
Taibin was gifted in the arts,
Skilled at the zither,
Able to play a single string and harmonize all eight tones,
Teaching Mi Changsheng and Sun Guangtian.
*(Guangtian was none other than Sun Deng.)*
**Jiang Shumao**

**Jiang Shumao**

Jiang Shumao’s origins are unknown. He was often a companion to Zhou Taibin, studying the Dao and cultivating immortality. Today, he serves as Left Minister in Penglai. The Jiang clans of Nanzheng are his descendants. Shumao once wrote to the officials of the Great Ultimate, saying: *"Formerly, I studied the Dao at Guigu; attained it at Shaoshi; nurtured my wings at Huayang; and awaited ascension in the Land of Leisure. At times, I rode the maple-wheel chariot and feasted at Gouqu. In moments of awakening, I sighed deeply at the swiftness of change—things endure while men perish. What labor is mine to bear?"*

*The Declarations of the Perfected* states: *"In the Qin era, the Daoist Zhou Taibin and the Marquis of Baling, Jiang Shumao, came to dwell at the foot of Gouqu Mountain, where they also planted the five fruits and five pungent herbs."* Shumao was enfeoffed as marquis during the reign of King Xiao of Qin. The place is now called Jiangba, named after him. A note below reads: *"The name of the land remains, and a great road still exists, running from behind Lesser Mao Peak to Yanling—now called Jiangba Road."* However, during the reign of Duke Xiao of Qin, the land had not yet been unified, and Chu established commanderies. Baling County was first established in the early Jin dynasty, so there could not have been a marquisate of Baling. It was likely the Ba of Bashu.

**Gong Zhongyang**

Gong Zhongyang received the Six Disciplines of the Stepping Method from the Lesser Lad of Mount Song.

**Gu Xizi**

Gu Xizi studied the Dao and attained immortality, becoming an authentic official of the Supreme Perfected. Dongfang Shuo was his disciple, receiving from him the *Plate of Wind*, the *Maps of Mount Zhong and Penglai*, and the *True Forms of the Divine Continent*.

*The Declarations of the Perfected* states: *"Gu Xizi served as Right Immortal Duke of the Great Ultimate."*

**Wang Zhonggao**

Wang Zhonggao’s origins are unknown.

In the markets of Huainan, he was often seen divining. Elders of successive generations beheld him, his face ever bearing the bloom of youth. Wu Bei spoke of him to Liu An, King of Huainan, who, upon hearing of him, rejoiced and immediately dispatched a summons. Bei said, "Zhonggao often stays at Zhang Meng’s home. I am on good terms with Meng, who always says that Zhonggao is of upright and unyielding character, difficult to invite, and cannot be bent by authority. I shall persuade him through Meng." The king ordered a carriage prepared and sent Bei to Meng’s residence to extend the invitation. Meng said, "Master Wang mentioned yesterday that he would be traveling briefly, though nearby, and we might see him from time to time. He has now gone out to divine and will return by evening." Bei waited, and before long, Zhonggao returned. Seeing Bei, he laughed heartily and said to Meng, "When I spoke of a brief departure yesterday, I was referring to this guest." He then followed Bei to see the king. The king came out to greet him, facing east to receive the Dao, and performed the rites of a disciple. Zhonggao said, "I am but an ordinary man who has merely attained the Way of long life and immortality. I possess no other abilities. Fearing my knowledge is too shallow to offer to Your Highness, I harbor no reluctance in my heart." The king repeatedly entreated him, but Zhonggao said to Bei, "I wish to transmit the Dao to the king, yet his heart and will are shallow. Even if he cannot practice it, he should not hear of it." He added, "The Yellow Emperor was the elder of my father’s generation. Formerly, I studied under Master Zhu Xiang and received the secret of long life. Later, I studied under Master Huang Dong and received the Way of immortality. To this day, I have lived for over six thousand years." He then transmitted the Dao to the king, and afterward, none knew where Zhonggao had gone.

**Gongsun Jing**

Gongsun Qing studied the Dao on Mount Dongliangfu, also said to be Mount Ziye. Within the mountain’s palace, there were ingredients for concocting the elixir of immortality. Those who consumed it would immediately ascend as immortals. The spirits of the sun and moon dwelled within the palace. When compounding the elixir, they chanted:

*The Jade Maiden divides the doses,*
*The Toad and Frog govern the blending;*
*One pill refines the human form,*
*Two pills beautify the countenance.*

During the reign of Emperor Wu of Han, when magicians ventured into the sea in search of Penglai, Gongsun Qing went ahead and encountered an old man leading a dog. The emperor believed him to be an immortal and hoped to obtain his true essence.

**Li Shaojun**

Li Shaojun, styled Yunyi, was fond of the Dao. He entered Mount Tai to gather herbs and practiced the arts of grain avoidance and bodily preservation. He met An Qisheng, and when Shaojun fell gravely ill, he kowtowed, begging for his life. An Qisheng gave him a dose of *Divine Tower Powder*, and he immediately recovered. In the early years of Emperor Wu of Han, he arrived at Yong during the suburban sacrifice and witnessed the Five Sacrificial Altars. Thereafter, the emperor performed the suburban sacrifice once every three years. At that time, Shaojun presented the emperor with the method of *Sacrificial Favor*, grain avoidance, and rejuvenation. He often claimed to be seventy years old yet could make things revert to youth. The emperor showed him an ancient bronze vessel, and Shaojun said, "This vessel was displayed in the Wuqin Terrace during the tenth year of Duke Huan of Qi." Upon examining the inscription, it was indeed a vessel from Duke Huan’s reign. The entire court was astonished, deeming Shaojun a man of several hundred years. Shaojun told the emperor, "Through sacrificial rites, all things may be summoned, and cinnabar can be transmuted into gold. Once gold is formed, it may be fashioned into vessels for food and drink, thereby prolonging life. With prolonged life, the immortals of Penglai may be seen. Through the Feng and Shan sacrifices, one may attain immortality—such was the case with the Yellow Emperor." He added, "I once traveled upon the sea and met An Qisheng, who fed me jujubes as large as melons." Thereupon, the emperor began performing the *Sacrificial Favor* rites and dispatched magicians into the sea to seek Penglai and the likes of An Qisheng.

Another account states that Shaojun, an ancient minister, could congeal mercury into silver and refine cinnabar into gold. Those who consumed it would ascend to heaven in broad daylight, their bodies refined to traverse the void, riding flying dragons to the eight distant realms or mounting white swans to circle the nine heavens. The jujubes of the Dark Sea were as large as melons, and the plums of Mount Zhong were as vast as basins. Having eaten them, he gained wondrous radiance.

The Master An Qisheng transmitted to me oral instructions, enabling the preservation of all things that may be perfected. Thereupon, the emperor held him in the highest esteem and built him a grand residence.

The *Baopuzi* states: According to *The Household Records of Li Shaojun* compiled by Dong Zhongshu, Shaojun possessed the formula for immortality, yet his family was impoverished and lacked the means to procure the necessary ingredients. Thus, he entered official service to secure a path to wealth, and once his Dao was accomplished, he departed.

Further, according to the *Han Dynasty Records of the Chu Palace* with annotations: As Shaojun was about to depart, Emperor Wu dreamed of ascending Mount Song with him. They encountered an emissary in embroidered robes riding a dragon down from the clouds, who declared, "The Great One summons Shaojun." The emperor awoke and said to his attendants, "As in my dream, Shaojun will leave me." Several days later, Shaojun fell ill and died. When placed in his coffin, the emperor ordered it opened—no body was found, only his robes and cap remained.

Dong Zhongjun

Dong Zhongjun was a native of Linhuai. From his youth, he practiced qi-cultivation and bodily refinement, and though he lived past a hundred years, he did not age. Once, falsely accused and imprisoned, he feigned death—his body rotted and teemed with maggots. The jailers carried him out, and only then did he revive, departing through *shi jie* (corpse liberation).

Che Zihou

Che Zihou was a native of Fufeng. Emperor Wu of Han admired his purity and tranquility, gradually promoting him to the position of *Shizhong* (Attendant Within). One morning, he told his family, "I have now been appointed to an immortal office. This spring I shall depart, but by midsummer I will return briefly before leaving again." His words proved true.

Emperor Wu, missing him, composed a song:
*"Fine the hidden orchid, its beauty unfurled,
Yet lurking within, the seductive and wild.
Bright the sun, resplendent the day,
The breeze lingers, scattering fragrance away.
O Heaven, unwise—
The perfected one departs for the immortal skies.
The celestial path stretches far, no return in sight,
Unbidden, my tears soak my robes in their flight."*

Wang Xing

Wang Xing was a native of Yangcheng. He dwelled in the Wan Valley, an ordinary man unaware of the Dao, with no thought of cultivating it. In the second year of the *Yuanfeng* era of Emperor Wu of Han, on the *jiazi* day of the first month, the emperor ascended Mount Songgao and climbed the *Dayu* stone to establish a Daoist temple. He sent Dong Zhongjun, Dongfang Shuo, and others to purify themselves and meditate upon the spirits. Suddenly, an immortal appeared, towering over two *zhang* in height, his ears extending above his head and hanging down to his shoulders. Emperor Wu bowed and questioned him. The immortal replied, "I am a man of Mount Jiuyi. I heard that on the stone mountain of the Central Peak grows inch-long *changpu* (calamus) with nine nodes, and consuming it grants longevity. Thus, I have come to gather it." With that, he vanished.

Emperor Wu turned to his attendants and said, "He is no mere cultivator of the Dao or consumer of herbs—he must be a spirit of the Central Peak, come to instruct me." Thereupon, he gathered and consumed *changpu* for two years. However, Emperor Wu favored rich, heated foods, and after eating *changpu*, he would invariably feel stifled and unwell, so he ceased. Many of his officials also consumed it, but none could persist. Only Wang Xing, having heard the immortal’s words, gathered and consumed it without pause.

Later, he became the *Zhubu* (Registrar) of Pujiang County. Hearing of divine transformations and immortals within the county’s borders, he would gaze toward the clouds, his heart filled with sincerity and longing. He resigned his post and secluded himself on Mount Qiuchang, where the twenty-two transformations occur. Below lies a cavern, within which dwells a thousand-year-old golden toad. According to ancient lore, those who behold it shall attain the Dao.

Atop the mountain grew a *qiong* flower tree, eight or nine feet in girth, its leaves resembling those of the white sandalwood. Though winter’s chill endured, its foliage remained ever lush. It was said that when this tree bloomed, someone on the mountain would ascend to heaven and attain the Dao. Its blossoms resembled hibiscus, their fragrance carrying for miles.

Wang Xing dwelled on this mountain, preserving his spirit and embracing the One, absorbing the radiance of the sun and moon in inner cultivation. He also practiced the *Way of Riding Dragons and Treading the Constellations*, refining himself for nine years. Suddenly, the *qiong* flowers burst into bloom, and the golden toad leapt forth, leading him into the cavern. There, he encountered the Golden Liquid Elixir, bowed, and consumed it. Later, a cloud chariot arrived to welcome him, and he ascended to heaven in broad daylight. Because Wang Xing attained the Dao, later generations transmitted the tale as the *Transformation of the Registrar*.

**Marquis of Longevity Light**
The Marquis of Longevity Light could subdue a hundred ghosts and myriad specters, compelling them to bind themselves and reveal their forms. A woman in his village fell ill from a specter’s affliction; the marquis subdued it, and a serpent of several dozen feet died outside her door. There was also a divine tree—anyone who rested beneath it would die, and birds that flew over it would fall. The marquis subdued it as well, and in the height of summer, the tree withered and shed its leaves. A serpent, seven or eight *zhang* in length, was found hanging dead among its branches.

Emperor Wu of Han heard of this and summoned him for an audience. The emperor tested him, saying: “After midnight in my palace hall, several figures in crimson robes with unbound hair, carrying torches, often follow me. Can you subdue them?” The marquis replied: “Such minor apparitions are easily dispelled.” The emperor secretly ordered three men to impersonate them. The marquis subdued the three, who immediately collapsed to the ground, lifeless. The emperor, greatly startled, said: “They were no specters—I was merely testing you.” He revived them, and they awoke.

**Wei Shuqing**

Wei Shuqing was one who attained immortality through ingesting mica. In the eighth month of the second year of the Tianhan era of Emperor Wu of Han, on the day *renchen*, the Venerable Lord once more dispatched Wei Shuqing to meet the emperor. At that time, the emperor was at leisure in his palace hall when suddenly he saw a figure clad in feathered robes and a star-crown, arriving in a cloud-chariot drawn by white deer. Startled, the emperor asked who it was, and the figure replied: “I am Wei Shuqing of Zhongshan.” The emperor said: “If you are a subject of Zhongshan, then you are my minister—come forward and speak with me.” Yet in an instant, Shuqing vanished without a trace. The emperor deeply regretted this and immediately sent Liang Bo to Zhongshan to seek him. Though he could not be found, Liang Bo brought Shuqing’s son, Dushi, back to see the emperor. The emperor asked: “Where is your father now?” Dushi replied: “My father has long been devoted to the Dao, shunning worldly affairs. He left our family forty-five years ago, saying he would enter Mount Hua.” The emperor again dispatched Liang Bo and Dushi together to Mount Hua to search for him. At the foot of a sheer cliff, they saw Shuqing playing a game of *bo* with several others atop the crag, enveloped in purple clouds, their pieces fashioned of white jade. Several immortals stood behind them, holding jade tablets. Dushi bowed twice from afar, and Shuqing said: “Why have you come?” Dushi replied: “The emperor deeply regrets that he could not speak with you the other day. He has now sent the emissary Liang Bo and me to seek you, hoping to see you once more.” Shuqing said: “I was previously sent by the Most High to inform the emperor of the time of great calamity and the method to avert peril, that the dynasty’s fate might be prolonged. But the emperor was arrogant and self-important, failing to recognize the true Dao, so I departed. Now I must join the Central Yellow and Grand Unity to stabilize the celestial origin—I shall not return again.” Liang Bo returned and reported this, and the emperor was filled with remorse. Then Dushi asked Shuqing: “May I ask who those seated with you are?” Shuqing replied: “They are Master Hongya, Xu You, Chao Fu, Lord Tai Xuan, Feihuangzi, Prince Wang Zijin, and Xue Rong. The world is soon to descend into great chaos. In several hundred years, earth will perish and metal will fall. Return home and retrieve the jade case beneath the northwestern pillar of my study. Inside is a divine book of plain silk—take it and follow its instructions for a year, and you will be able to ride the clouds. When your cultivation is complete, come join me here.” Dushi bowed and took his leave.

Later, he taught the divine method to Liang Bo’s master. Together, they refined and ingested the elixir, and both attained immortality.

**Dai Meng**
Dai Meng, a Daoist of Mount Wudang, styled Chengzi, was a native of Wuwei. During the reign of Emperor Wu of Han, he served as a general in the palace. Originally surnamed Yan, named Ji, and styled Zhongwei, he changed his name after attaining the Dao. Some say he lived during the reign of Emperor Ming of Han. Orphaned in youth, he cared for his mother with utmost devotion and was fond of studying immortality, traveling throughout the land. After his mother passed, he entered Mount Huayang, where he consumed white wood, Solomon’s seal, mica, realgar, cinnabar, and lingzhi mushrooms. His resolve for the Dao grew ever stronger with time. One day, the Pure Numinous Perfected Lord Pei bestowed upon him a jade pendant, a golden cauldron scripture, and the Stone Essence Golden Light Talisman. Through diligent cultivation, he felt his body grow lighter. He wandered famous mountains and sought transcendent realms, covering seven hundred *li* in a day, and attained the Dao of deathlessness. At his waist hung over ten scrolls of scripture, known as *The Yellow Writ of the Grand Tenuity*. The immortals Guo Zihua, Zhang Jilian, Zhao Shuda, and Shan Shiyuan often kept him company, and Xie Yun made him his teacher. Yun, styled Daotong, was a native of Liyang. In his youth, he was abducted and sold to Dongyang.

After some time, he reported his case to the authorities but was falsely accused in Wuniu. When his execution seemed imminent, an elderly man appeared at night to bestow a talisman upon him, and a yellow-robed youth came and went, thus sparing him from death. During the Xiankang era of Emperor Cheng of Jin, he arrived at Mount Wudang in Xiangyang, where he met Dai Meng. Observing his bearing and physique, he realized that the one who had granted him the talisman in prison was none other than Meng. Thereupon, he took the disciple’s rites and sought the essential teachings of the Dao.

Later, he entered official service, serving as magistrate of Liyang, Xinfeng, and Xidao counties. Wherever he went, his spiritual efficacy was widely attested. Yun remained youthful even at seventy, while Meng would appear and vanish unpredictably, his whereabouts unknown. *The Declarations of the Perfected* states: "The yellow-robed youth was an official of the Jade Pendant and Golden Cauldron."

**Shan Shiyuan**
Shan Shiyuan received the methods of Master Dai Meng. Every evening, before retiring, he would first recite *The Inner Radiance of the Yellow Court Classic* once, allowing his hun and po souls to refine themselves. He practiced this for twenty-one years and attained transcendence. The ideal was to complete ten thousand recitations, though three or four in an evening were considered excellent. Shiyuan achieved the Dao and became the Perfected Lord of Grand Harmony.

**Mao Bodao**
Mao Bodao, Liu Daogong, Xie Zhijian, and Zhang Zhaoqi were all men of the Later Han. Together, they studied the Dao on Mount Wangwu for over forty years and jointly compounded an elixir of transcendence. Bodao consumed it first and immediately died; Daogong followed and likewise perished. Zhijian and Zhaoqi dared not ingest it, so they abandoned the elixir and returned home. Before leaving the mountain, they suddenly saw Bodao and Daogong each riding a white deer, accompanied by immortals bearing ceremonial tablets. The two men were struck with grief and remorse, whereupon Daogong taught them the method of consuming fuling. Later, they too transcended the world.

A note in *The Declarations of the Perfected* states: "Xie Zhijian appears in three different accounts—one where he accompanied Ge Xuan, another where he resided in the Deer Track Grotto. This version is the most detailed and likely the correct one. The others may refer to individuals of the same name."

**Su Lin**
The gentleman Su, whose personal name was Lin and courtesy name Zixuan, was a native of Qu Shui in Puyang. From youth, he possessed extraordinary conduct and stood apart from his peers. His resolve to seek the Perfected grew ever more steadfast with each passing day.

Once, he journeyed to Zhao with a carrying pole to study under Master Qin Gao. At the age of twenty-one, he received the teachings of refining qi to nourish life. Qin Gao had initially served as a retainer in the court of King Kang of Zhou, where he mastered the arts of cultivating inner conduct, refining essence, and alchemical methods. Capable of traversing water, he had already lived for nine hundred years—immortal in body yet not a flying transcendent. Later, he would ride a red carp into the waters, sometimes emerging among men.

Yet Su Lin, gazing toward the cinnabar clouds, aspired to greater heights and eventually changed his teacher to Master Qiu of Mount Hua. Master Qiu had been the Minister of Wood during the reign of King Tang. He practiced the method of embryonic nourishment, the arts of returning spirit and guarding the soul, from which Su Lin greatly benefited. The master said, "You are a true person; you should study the true Dao. My path is no longer sufficient for you to tread." Thus, he introduced Su Lin to Master Juan.

Master Juan was a perfected one. Upon meeting Su Lin, he transmitted the true oral instructions, saying: "If you wish to become a terrestrial perfected one, you must first consume medicinal substances to expel the Three Corpses and eradicate the grain worms. The Three Corpses are: first, the Green Ancient, which attacks the eyes—hence dimmed vision, wrinkled face, foul breath, and tooth loss, all caused by the Green Ancient’s qi boring through the Mud Pill Palace. Second, the White Maiden, which assaults the five viscera—hence a muddled heart, depleted qi, forgetfulness, and confusion, as the White Maiden drains the fluids of the six bowels. Third, the Blood Corpse, which ravages the stomach and intestines—hence abdominal distension, withered bones, scorched flesh, a closed mind, unstable thoughts, hunger upon missing a meal, sorrow, sighing, mental dullness, and scattered spirit, all due to the Blood Corpse gnawing at the gates of the soul’s embryo. If one does not expel the Three Corpses before ingesting elixirs, though grain may be forsaken, the worms will not die. Merely abstaining from the five flavors and diligently practicing breath control will be of no benefit, for these worms, once born, seek to prevent man’s immortality. Thus, consuming elixirs without dispelling death and life is due to the Three Ghosts—the Green Ancient, White Maiden, and Blood Corpse—remaining within. Even if one abstains from grain, the body grows heavy and sluggish, listless and dull. Moreover, the dullness is not genuine; it is inverted and disordered, with licentiousness unremoved, because the worms within agitate the five spirits. Those who seek the true must first take the Worm-Restraining Pill. The Worm-Restraining Pill is also called the Primordial Spirit-Expelling Root-Removing Pill. To become a perfected one, one must first take the Transcendent-Restraining Pill. The Transcendent-Restraining Pill is the Supreme Eight-Jade Flying Essence Elixir. All who seek longevity and deathlessness, all who aspire to transcendence, must first take the Worm-Restraining Pill to eliminate the corpse-worms and establish the root of eternal life. How can one attain transcendence with worms in the belly? How can one achieve perfection with ghosts thriving in the body? These worms are malevolent, hastening one’s death—thus, they must be expelled."

Master Juan told Su Lin: "I have been summoned by the Emperor to ascend and fill the post of Grand Master of the Four Central Yellow Offices, assuming the title of Duke of the Northern Sea. My departure from the world is imminent." Later, Su Lin visited Master Juan’s chamber of quiet repose and received a scroll left for him. Its text read: "The secret of the Five Pecks and Three Ones was concealed by the Great Emperor. Through twenty years of concentrated meditation, the Three Ones appeared, and the scripture was transmitted to you. With only the Three Ones, one attains undying life and guards it even in death. If you can preserve the Three Ones, your name will be inscribed on the Jade Tablets. Will the corpse meet the Three Ones? By preserving the Cavern Chamber, one becomes a Duke of Supreme Clarity; by mastering the Three Origins, one becomes a Lord of the Five Emperors. The Golden Portal Emperor of Later Sageliness soars on lightning and traverses the ten heavens precisely through the Dao of the Cavern Chamber, Three Origins, and True One. I have consumed the essence of trees for three hundred years, refined qi for five hundred, meditated for six hundred, guarded the Three Ones for three hundred, preserved the Cavern Chamber for six hundred, and cultivated the Mysterious Elixir for five hundred. In the interim, I have wandered famous mountains, gazed upon the eight seas, circled the five peaks, and rested in grotto chambers. I delighted in the drooping branches of forests, frolicked with birds and beasts, read the rivers’ exhaled essence, and marveled at the lush hills. I witnessed the flourishing of all things, the turning of seasons, fished in long streams, roamed amid ethereal winds, stilled my heart in mountain vales, nurtured my spirit, and cultivated qi. I summoned the Six Dings, and jade maidens appeared as guards; I traversed the six directions without hindrance. For over two thousand eight hundred years, I guarded my form and contemplated the true, finding joy in the midst of transcendence, seeking no fame. Now, suddenly summoned to fill a celestial post, I linger in worldly grace, reluctant to part. I must go; let us take leave here. Strive diligently, and may our paths cross again in the Chamber of Soaring."

Su Lin read the scroll, tears streaming, and bowed in vain toward the empty air—Master Juan’s traces had already vanished. The Mysterious Elixir is the spirit of the Mud Pill Palace. Its method derives from the *Supreme Plain Numinous Instructions*: guarding the Three Ones makes one a terrestrial perfected one; preserving the Cavern Chamber makes one a perfected one; cultivating the Mysterious Elixir makes one a denizen of the Grand Tenuity Palace.

Su Lin reverently upheld the precepts, cultivated the Dao to completion, and surveyed the world. He wandered famous mountains, divided his form and scattered his radiance, rested on cinnabar mounds, sold shoes in market alleys, and tested his authenticity through humble guises. When content, he dwelled; when transformed, he followed no pattern—contemporaries could not recognize him. In the second year of Shenjue during the reign of Emperor Yuan of Han, on the sixth day of the third month, he told his disciple Zhou Jitong: "Yesterday, I was summoned by the Dark Continent to become a perfected one and assume the post of Grand Master of the Central Ultimate. Today, I take leave of you." By dawn the next day, a cloud chariot with feathered canopy, drawn by dragons and tigers, arrived with thousands of attendants to welcome Su Lin. That very day, he ascended to heaven, drifting slowly toward the northwest.

After a long while, clouds and mist enveloped him, and he vanished without trace.

Before Su Lin’s departure, the Supreme Ultimate had first dispatched an envoy to confer upon him the title of Perfected One of the Central Marchmount. Later, the Most High again sent the Jade Youth to bestow the rank of Perfected One of the Earthly Realms of the Five Marchmounts, with his palace located on Cinnabar Mound.

His disciple Zhou Jitong remarked:
"I witnessed my master attain the Dao and become an immortal. Thrice was he honored with appointments before ascending. His vast virtue was lofty and wondrous, his mysterious resonance long predestined. His numinous transformations flowed from the empty source, his spirit illumined the eight directions. Dragons ascended and phoenixes followed as he strode through the gates of reality. Concealed or revealed, he traversed the ford of existence, observing and testing the winds of the mortal world. His Dao was divine, his methods precious—beyond what brush and paper can fully convey. Here, I merely sketch its outline, hoping that future adepts of the Way may cast their gaze upon it."

Yang Sheng
Yang Sheng dwelled on Mount Jinmen in the west of Shaoshi. The mountain held a golden flask of nectar; those who drank it attained the Dao.

Wang Sizhen
Wang Sizhen’s era of attaining the Dao is unknown. He held the position of Immortal Attendant of the Scriptures to the Most High. On the first day of the first month in the second year of Guanghe during the reign of Emperor Ling of Han, the Most High Lord Lao descended upon Mount Tiantai and commanded Sizhen to don the nine-colored robe of retribution. He then presented the thirty-six scrolls of the *Dongxuan* and *Great Cavern* scriptures to the Immortal Duke Ge Xuan of the Left Palace of the Supreme Ultimate.

Wang Zhongdu
Wang Zhongdu was a man of the Han dynasty.

Yang Sheng (alternate account)
It is also said that he was a Daoist who studied the Way on Mount Liang, where he encountered the Perfected One of Venus, who bestowed upon him the Rainbow Elixir. Thereby he mastered cold and heat, and had already lived for over two hundred years. Emperor Yuan of Han summoned him to the capital and tested his arts. Once, in the depths of winter, the emperor took him on an outing. He ordered Zhongdu to ride a four-horse chariot through the Shanglin Park and around the Kunming Pond, clad only in a single layer of clothing. The emperor, wrapped in fox fur, still felt the cold, while Zhongdu’s countenance showed no change, and steam rose from his back in swirling wisps. Again, in the height of summer, he was exposed to the blazing sun and encircled by ten braziers, yet his mouth uttered no complaint of heat, nor did his body break into sweat. Later, he too departed as an immortal. Sun Simiao once dwelled on Mount Emei, cultivating truth and practicing the Dao. Zhongdu, along with three or five companions, disguised themselves as hunters and passed by his dwelling to test him. They discussed the principles of longevity, whereupon Zhongdu transmitted the Way to Simiao before departing.

Shang Chenggong
Shang Chenggong was a native of Xuan County. After setting out on a journey, he remained away from home for a long time. Upon his return, he told his family, “I have attained immortality.” He then bid them farewell and left. People saw him take a step and rise slightly into the empty air, lingering for a long while before vanishing. He lived during the Later Han dynasty.

Tong Jun

In the third year of Jian'an during the reign of Emperor Xian of Han, the kingdom of Ertu presented a wailing stone parrot. Its color was vermilion, and its size resembled that of a swallow. It would cry in the earth in accordance with the seasons, its voice carrying far. Upon hearing its cry, the people of the kingdom would slaughter animals to sacrifice to it, and where the sound emanated, they would dig and retrieve the parrot. If the world was at great peace, it would soar and fly, considered an auspicious omen, and was also called the treasure parrot. People listened to the earth to mark the hours. Daoist masters said: "The immortal Tong Jun gathered stones and entered a cave for several *li*, obtaining cinnabar. The stone parrot ground it into medicine, which, when consumed, gave one a resonant voice but caused death after heaven’s decree."

In the first year of Baoding during the reign of Emperor Hao, the four directions offered rare and marvelous tributes, including an amber swallow. Placed in a quiet chamber, it would cry and flutter within the room. Such was its kind.

Liu Chen and Ruan Zhao
Liu Chen and Ruan Zhao were natives of Ke County. In the fifteenth year of Yong'an during the reign of Emperor Ming of Han, the two went to Mount Tiantai to gather herbs but lost their way, and their provisions ran out. They saw a peach tree atop a mountain and together ate its fruit, feeling slightly invigorated. Descending the mountain, they found a stream and drank from it, bathing as well. Then they saw turnip greens growing from the mountainside, and next, a cup floated out, containing crumbs of sesame rice. The two said to each other, "People cannot be far from here." Crossing the water, which was about four *chi* deep, they traveled a *li* and crossed another mountain, emerging at a great ravine. There, they saw two women of unparalleled beauty, the likes of which the world had never seen. The women called out Liu and Ruan by name, as if they were old acquaintances. Delighted, they said, "Why have you gentlemen come so late?" They invited them to their home, where the halls were adorned with exquisite garments and ornaments, and the east and west chambers each had embroidered curtains and bed canopies, with seven-jeweled garlands—things not of this world. The attendants, all maidservants in azure robes, were uniformly comely, and there were no men or boys. Soon, they served sesame rice and dried mountain goat meat, which were delicious. They also offered sweet wine. Then, several immortals arrived at the women’s home with three or five peaches, saying, "We have come to celebrate the daughters’ husbands." Each brought out musical instruments, and they sang and played music. As dusk approached, the immortals departed.

Liu and Ruan stayed at the home of the women who had invited them, remaining for fifteen days. When they asked to return, the women replied, "Your coming here was summoned by the fortune of past lives, allowing you to reach the immortal abode. Compared to the mortal world, how could there be such joy?" They stayed for half a year. The weather was mild and pleasant, always like the second or third month. The cries of the hundred birds were mournful, and all felt sorrowful longing. Their desire to return grew urgent, and the women said, "The roots of your sins have not yet been eradicated, which is why you gentlemen feel this way." They then summoned all the immortal women to play music and send Liu and Ruan off from the mouth of the mountain cave. Not far from there, they reached the main road. Following the women’s words, they returned to their hometown, but no one recognized them. The villagers found it strange and verified that seven generations of descendants had passed, and their ancestors had entered the mountains and never returned, leaving no one to inquire after them. With no relatives, they had nowhere to stay. They wished to return to the women’s home but could not find the mountain path they had taken years before. By the eighth year of Taikang during the reign of Emperor Wu of Jin, the two gentlemen were ultimately lost, and no one knew where they had gone.

Wu Ding
Wu Ding of Guiyang City possessed the Way of immortals and often dwelled among people. Suddenly, he said to his younger brother, "On the seventh day of the seventh month, the Weaving Maiden crosses the river, and all the immortals return to their palaces. I have been summoned and cannot stay; I must bid you farewell." His brother asked, "Why does the Weaving Maiden cross the river, and when will you return?" He replied, "The Maiden briefly visits the Herdboy. Three thousand years after I depart, I shall return." The next morning, Wu Ding was gone. To this day, people still say that on the seventh day of the seventh month, the Weaving Maiden marries the Herdboy.

Master of the Dark Capital
The Master of the Dark Capital received the *Scripture of the Black Jade Heaven-Earth Bell of the Immortals* and, by practicing it, attained the Dao.

Cai Changru
Cai Changru was a native of Shu Commandery. By ingesting the Ten Essences Pellet, he lived to three hundred years of age, yet his complexion remained that of a young boy.

Yanming Zigao
Yanming Zigao attained immortality by consuming deer antler.

Cui Yezi
Cui Yezi consumed wood to transcend the world.

Ling Zizhen
Ling Zizhen achieved immortality by ingesting peach resin.

Ren Dun
Ren Dun was a native of Bochang. In his youth, he studied the Dao at Mount Luofu, later dwelling in the Southern Grotto of Mount Mao. He practiced the Dipper-Stepping Dao and the *Five Talismans of the Cavernous Mystery*, enabling him to command and summon spirits and gods, conceal his form, and divide his body. While residing in his mountain abode, tigers and wolves dared not violate his presence.

Jing Xuanzhi
Jing Xuanzhi cultivated the Dao of the Central Realm, preserving the Dao and guarding the Three Ones. He often sang:
*"From afar I gaze at Kunlun’s peaks,
Below lie three qing of fields.
I ask, who tends these fields?
The Red Child, named Yuanxian.
Earth births two numinous trees,
Twin gates flank either side.
Sun and moon illuminate each other,
The divine path spans the central heavens.
Gathering herbs on Three Subtleties Ridge,
I drink and rinse at Hua Pond’s spring.
Roaming the Twelve Towers,
I stride leisurely across the central plains.
I wish to behold the Crimson Palace,
But arrive as Zidan sleeps.
A golden tower holds a jade table,
Canopy linked in splendor.
Glancing, I see two envoys,
Clad in robes vast as Mount Taihang.
How towering the Long Valley,
Qi’s walls stand as neighbors.
Loosing my flying dragon’s reins,
I suddenly arrive at the Boundless Abyss.
Yellow essence grows at the spring’s depths,
Mushroom herbs spread along Qi’s streams.
I desire to take the yellow essence,
To refine cinnabar before my eyes.
Pacing, I drink the flowing elixir,
My feathered wings gleam with swift brilliance.
Yet beyond my plans,
Ziqiao lifts my arm.
The journey is truly perilous,
But what is prized is attaining immortality."*

Bo Ju
Bo Ju, styled Zigao, once entered the mountains to gather firewood when he saw two white cranes alight upon a stone and transform into two immortals. They spoke, saying, "We recently compounded the Yin Elixir and sought the Nine-Sword Wine from the Queen Mother of the West in Hebei. It proved most efficacious." Hearing the immortals’ words, Zigao sought out the Queen Mother, obtained the Nine-Sword Wine, and returned to inform the immortals. He begged for the Yin Elixir, consumed it, and instantly ascended into the void. He dwells among the clouds, charged with the task of governing cloud and rain. During the Wei and Jin dynasties, there was a Bo He who studied under the Queen Mother of the West in Hebei—it is uncertain whether this is the same person.

Xu Jidao
In his youth, Xu Jidao resided on Mount Huming. Later, he encountered a perfected one who said to him, "To study the Dao, one must don a sky-blue headscarf, chant the *Great Calendar*, tread the *True Annals* as a path, pair two whites, and circle two reds. These are the Five Spirits of Primordial Simplicity, the Dao’s secret matters—its language is veiled." The *Great Calendar* refers to the *Writings of the Three Sovereigns*. Jidao cultivated and attained the Dao.

Zhao Shuqi
Zhao Shuqi’s origins are unknown.

Zhao Shuqi studied the Dao within the mountains of Wangwu, often emerging to inquire among the people. Hearing of a diviner in the marketplace, he went to see him. The diviner said to Shuqi, "If you wish to enter the Gate of Heaven, harmonize the Three Passes, visualize the Crimson Robe, and align with Kunlun." Shuqi recognized him as a divine being, bowed deeply, and begged for the essential Dao. The diviner then gave him a scroll, the *Records of the Womb*. Having received it with reverence, Shuqi later compounded the divine elixir and ascended to heaven.

Zhuang Bowei
Zhuang Bowei was a man of the Han dynasty who, from youth, cherished the Dao but knew not the method to seek it. He would face the northwest at sunset, close his eyes, clench his fists, and visualize Mount Kunlun. After thirty years of this practice, he beheld a person from Kunlun who bestowed upon him the formula for the Golden Fluid. Having compounded and ingested it, he attained the Dao.

The *True Annals* states: "After visualizing Mount Kunlun for twenty-one years, he ingested medicinal substances and entered Mount Zhong to study the Dao. Still adhering to this method, he continued for another decade or so. Later, closing his eyes, he suddenly beheld Kunlun. Persisting in this visualization without cease, he then saw an immortal who transmitted to him the formula for the Golden Fluid, by which he attained the Dao."

Qu Wu
Qu Wu was a man of the Later Han dynasty.

At the age of seven, he abstained from grains and ingested yellow essence and purple mushrooms. Entering Mount Emei, the Perfected One of Heavenly Bamboo transmitted to him the true instructions, whereupon he departed riding a white dragon. Today, in Shuzhou, there stands a shrine to Master Qu.

Kuang Su
Kuang Su, styled Zixi, was renowned from youth for his filial piety and fraternal devotion. Though summoned and offered office, he declined and devoted himself wholeheartedly to the study of the Dao. Traveling through famous mountains, he came to Mount Fusun, atop which lay a lake spanning several *li*, abundant with numinous herbs and strange creatures beyond recognition. Beside it was a stone wellspring connected to the lake. There were also stone crows that took flight in flocks during spring and autumn. Moreover, small stone bamboo shoots stood there, within which lay jade tablets inscribed with the names of blessed mountains, blessed lands, and those who had attained the Dao. Later, through the ingestion of medicinal substances, he attained the Dao.

Lu Dan
Lu Dan, in his youth, studied the Dao and became an immortal. Later, he served as an administrator in a prefecture. Often, he would travel through the void to return home, only to return by dawn. Once, during a grand prefectural assembly, he arrived late as the officials were lined up in attendance. As he circled the pavilion, preparing to descend, the master of ceremonies hurled a tablet at him, striking one of his shoes to the ground. Thereupon, Lu Dan flew away.

Master Fu
Master Fu studied the Dao within Mount Jiao. After seven years of concentrated meditation, he encountered the Perfected One of the Great Ultimate (the *True Annals* states it was the Venerable Lord of the Great Ultimate), who gave him a wooden drill and instructed him to bore through a stone disc, some five *chi* thick, saying, "When the stone disc is pierced, immortality may be attained." Thereupon, he drilled day and night. After forty-seven years, the stone was finally pierced. The immortal came and said, "With such resolve, how could one fail to attain the Dao?" He then transmitted to him the formula for the Golden Fluid and the Reverted Elixir. Having ingested it, he transcended the world. The *Records of the Elixir Terrace* states that he ascended to the Great Clarity and became the Perfected One of the Southern Marchmount.

Huang Guanzi
Huang Guanzi, from youth, was devoted to the Dao. His family practiced both Buddhism and Daoism, and he paid homage morning and night, praying for longevity. After forty-nine years of such devotion, he began ingesting medicinal substances and entered Mount Jiao. The Perfected One of the Great Ultimate tested him with one hundred and forty trials, all of which he passed. Thereupon, he ingested the Golden Elixir and chanted the *Perfect Scripture of the Great Cavern*. Today, he holds office as the Left Immortal Minister of the Great Ultimate.

Shi Tan
Shi Tan, styled Hongsun, was a native of Bohai. Traveling through the famous mountains of Zhao and Wei, he attained the Dao and gained the ability to divide his body. When invited by more than ten households at once, each household would see a Shi Tan, though their words differed.

Zhang Jujun
Zhang Jujun’s origins are unknown. When Xu Jishan fell gravely ill and could not recover, he purified himself, fasted, and made offerings at Mount Tai, praying for his life day and night. Suddenly, a divine person appeared and asked, "Who are you, and why do you plead so earnestly to the unseen realm?" The Celestial Emperor has sent me to question you; answer truthfully." Jishan replied, "I am Xu Jishan of Pingyu in Runan. I have been afflicted for three years, yet I know not the cause of my transgression. Thus, I have come to this sacred mountain to entreat the powers of life and death." The divine person said, "I am the immortal Zhang Jujun. I possess the arts of the *Book of Changes* and divination, and I can discern the source of your misfortune." Jishan bowed twice and entreated, "By the grace of your descent, divine immortal, I humbly beg for your guidance." Jujun cast a hexagram and obtained *Zhen*, with changes in the first nine, six in the second, and six in the third. He said, "You are a man of no virtue; how could your illness be cured?" Jishan replied, "I beg you to reveal it." Jujun said, "Once, while escorting a guest on a journey, you avenged a wrong done to your father by killing the guest on the road and concealing his body in an empty well, covering it with a great stone. This man has appealed to the Celestial Court, and thus you suffer this affliction." Jishan said, "This crime is indeed mine." Jujun asked, "Why did you do such a thing?" Jishan replied, "My father was struck by another, and I could not bear the shame of this lasting disgrace. When I and a guest sought to avenge him, the guest intended to report the matter to the authorities, so I killed him." Jujun said, "The principles of the unseen realm are not to be deceived. You must earnestly confess your crime. I shall return to the mountain and plead on your behalf." Gradually, Jishan recovered. Jujun transmitted to him the arts of divination and hexagrams, and Jishan delighted in the practice of *Yi* divination, though he never obtained Jujun’s method for transcending the world.

Yin Xi, the Supreme Perfected Yin Xi, styled Gongwen. His mother once napped at midday and dreamed of the crimson heavens swirling around her body. When Xi was born, lotus flowers spontaneously bloomed upon the ground within his home, their radiance and hue resplendent. His eyes held the essence of the sun, his form tall and refined, arms hanging past his knees—his bearing majestic, befitting a celestial being. From youth, he devoted himself to the study of ancient texts and was skilled in celestial patterns and esoteric apocrypha. Gazing upward and peering downward, nothing escaped his penetrating insight; even spirits and gods could not conceal their truths from him. Of magnanimous and heroic disposition, he cared little for worldly etiquette. He diminished himself to aid others, seeking neither fame nor advancement. His renown spread far and wide, and during the reign of King Kang of Zhou, he served as a grandee before being summoned as a guest-friend to the Eastern Palace. He wove grass into a tower to observe the celestial bodies, his mind fixed upon the supreme Dao, and thus it was called the "Tower Observation." At that time, Xi beheld a purple qi advancing westward from the eastern horizon—a celestial omen foretelling the passage of a sage through the pass. He thus petitioned to be appointed magistrate of Hangu Pass, and the king granted his request.

In the distant kalpas, there was a sage named the Most High Lord Lao, who since the dawn of creation had propagated the great Dao, descending through the ages as the teacher of emperors (as detailed in Scroll Two, from the Heavenly Sovereign to Guo Shuzi of Zhou). His subsequent incarnations are recorded in the *Veritable Records of the Primordial Origin*. In the seventeenth year of King Yangjia of Yin, he divided his spirit and transformed his qi to descend, taking form in the womb of the Mysterious and Wondrous Jade Maiden. After eighty-one years, on the fifteenth day of the second month in the ninth year of King Wuding (a gengchen day), he was born. His hair was white from birth, hence he was called "Laozi" (Old Master). Laozi was none other than Lord Lao. In the forty-third year (a jiayin year), he ascended to heaven upon a white deer in Bozhou (as detailed in the later scroll, *Records of the Supreme Primordial Sovereign*).

In the twenty-first year of King Xin of Yin, King Wen descended again upon the southern slopes of Mount Qi. When King Wen of Zhou became the Lord of the West, he appointed Laozi as the Keeper of Archives. During the reign of King Wu, he was promoted to the Archivist Beneath the Pillars, and he retained this position under King Cheng. He then journeyed to the western lands of Da Qin, Jambudvipa, and other nations, where he was known as the Ancient Master, guiding and instructing those realms (Jambudvipa lies west of Kunlun, not the Tianzhu of the "Heavenly Poisonous" lands). During the reign of King Kang, he returned to Zhou and resumed his post as Archivist Beneath the Pillars. In the time of King Zhao, he resigned his office and retired to Bo, living in seclusion.

Lord Lao, wishing to enlighten the Western Regions, set out in the twenty-third year of King Zhao (a guichou year, the first year of the Heavenly Realm of the Infinite in the celestial reckoning), on the sixteenth day of the fifth month. He rode in a carriage drawn by a blue ox, its canopy fashioned from thin planks, with Xu Jia as his charioteer. Crossing westward through Hangu Pass, Xi arrived at the pass and declared: "The yang number reaches its apex at nine; the stellar lodges align with Metal; the year and month converge in sovereign harmony. Within ninety days, a great sage shall pass through the capital." He then instructed the pass officer Sun Jing: "If any appear with unusual features or attire, do not permit them to pass." Xi prepared in advance, purifying himself through fasting and ritual, ordering the roads swept for forty *li* and incense burned along the way to await the arrival of the celestial perfected.

On the twelfth day of the seventh month (a jiazi day), an elder indeed arrived—hoary-haired, keen-eared, riding in a white carriage drawn by a blue ox. The pass officer said, "Your Excellency has given orders; we humbly request you to tarry awhile." He entered to inform Xi, who exclaimed, "The Dao has come at last! I shall behold the sage!" Immediately donning his court robes, he went forth to welcome him, prostrating and kowtowing, entreating, "May the great one deign to pause his divine carriage." Lord Lao declined, saying, "I am but a poor old man dwelling east of the pass, my fields to the west. I am merely fetching firewood—why detain me? Pray, allow me to pass." Xi again bowed deeply, replying, "Surely the great one is not fetching firewood. I have long heard that a great sage would journey westward. Though weary from exposure, I beg you to rest your divine carriage awhile." Lord Lao said, "I have heard that in Jambudvipa there is an Ancient Master who has mastered non-action and abides in eternal continuity. Thus, I ascend the Way and pass through this pass. Why do you persist in detaining me?" Xi replied, "Now that I behold you, your sagely bearing surpasses all; you are the supreme one of heaven. What need have you to visit the borderlands? I beg you not to dissemble but to bestow your compassion." Lord Lao asked, "How do you recognize me?"

Xi answered, "Last winter, in the tenth month, the Celestial Reason stars traversed the Dipper (the Celestial Reason consists of four stars governing the ordering of all things). Since the first day of this month, the harmonizing winds have blown thrice, and a true qi from the east, resembling a dragon-serpent, has advanced westward—this is the sign of a great sage. From youth, I have studied the *Yi* and celestial patterns and esoteric apocrypha. All that I observe above and below has never failed to prove true, so I knew a sage would cross the pass. Day and night, I have meditated without cease. Now, by good fortune, I encounter your immortal carriage. I beg you to bestow your compassionate teaching and deliver those lost in darkness."

Lord Lao, having tested him thrice and found him worthy, smiled and said, "Excellent! You know me. I, too, have known you. You possess a vision that penetrates the divine and shall attain liberation from the world." Overjoyed, Xi leapt up, kowtowed, and bowed twice, asking, "May I dare inquire the great sage’s name and style?" Lord Lao replied, "My name and style are vast, spanning kalpas beyond recounting. Now, my surname is Li, my style Boyang, and I am called Old Cong (the character *cong* shares its pronunciation with *peng* and is also written as *yan*)."

Thereupon, Xi prepared a seat in the official residence and offered provisions, presenting washing implements and performing the rites of a disciple. Lord Lao’s charioteer, Xu Jia, had long been in his service, contracted at a daily wage of one hundred coins. By the time of their departure from the pass, the debt amounted to seven million three hundred thousand coins. Seeing Lord Lao resign his post and journey far, Xu Jia hastened to demand payment. Lord Lao said to him, "I am traveling to the Western Sea, to Da Qin, Jibin, Jambudvipa, Parthia, and other lands. As my charioteer, upon our return, I shall repay you in gold."

Xu Jia honored the agreement. Upon reaching the pass, as they fed the blue ox in the wild, Lord Lao wished to test him. He transformed an auspicious herb into a beautiful woman, who approached the place where the ox was grazing and began to jest with Xu Jia. Enchanted, Xu Jia wished to stay, thus breaking his prior vow. He then went to the Pass Prefect to lodge a complaint against Lord Lao, demanding his wages. Lord Lao said to him, "You have followed me for over two hundred years. You should have died long ago, but I gave you the *Tai Xuan Sheng Fu* to sustain you until today. How could you forget this and sue me?" As he spoke, the talisman flew from Xu Jia’s mouth, its cinnabar script still fresh. Xu Jia instantly became a pile of white bones.

Xi, pitying Xu Jia for dying due to his own betrayal, kowtowed and pleaded for his life, vowing to redeem his debt if granted rebirth. Moved by Xi’s compassion, Lord Lao said, "Very well." He cast the *Tai Xuan Sheng Fu* again, and Xu Jia revived at once. Lord Lao said, "I do not blame you. You broke your original vow, so the Dao abandoned you, and thus you died. Now I shall repay your wages." Xi then gave the money to Xu Jia and sent him off with proper rites. Xu Jia begged to stay, but Lord Lao refused. Prostrating himself, Xu Jia struck his cheeks and said, "I have been graced with your boundless mercy, my crimes pardoned. This withered bone has seen the light again. I shall carve your kindness into my heart and follow your cloud-borne chariot." Yet Lord Lao remained unmoved.

Lord Lao stayed with Xi at the pass for over a hundred days. Xi fasted, kowtowed, and knelt to implore, "This humble one has been blessed to meet a sage. I surrender myself entirely—pray, teach me the Great Dao." Lord Lao said, "How profound is your question! The Great Dao preserves the true. Its three grades serve as its rule, unity as its measure, and rectitude as its virtue."

Xi asked, "The Dao has three grades. Is it possible to ascend as an immortal by practicing them?" Lord Lao replied, "If you can grasp the One, all things are complete. Seal your passions, enter the inner chamber, refine gold, and ingest qi—this is the foremost path. Master it and never lose it."

Overjoyed, Xi prostrated himself and asked, "How does one refine gold?" Lord Lao said, "It is a divine method. Even the Most Perfect Sovereign attains the Dao through the Golden Elixir, traversing the Nine Darks to enter the profound void. Above and below, emptiness prevails, yet through spirit and illumination, all ascend together."

Xi prostrated himself again and said, "I beg to hear its essence." Lord Lao replied:
*"Red lead and black tin, the head of the Great Elixir,
From red to black is true cultivation.
Extract essence from black, marrow from red,
Resolve the red and black—no medicine compares.
Use red in black to preserve long life,
Use black in red to become a celestial immortal."*

Xi said, "The Dao is lofty and wondrous! This unworthy student has not yet fathomed it. Pray, grant further instruction." Lord Lao continued:
*"The first is lead—lead is the lord,
The second is mercury—mercury is the minister.
If lead is not true, mercury will not draw near;
If lead is true, the household minister will not stray.
The Green-Waisted Messenger, the Red-Blood General,
Harmonize the two clans, disparate yet of one root.
White mercury forms the brain, yellow sprouts the root,
Transform lead to powder, refine mercury to dust.
Yin dwells in yang’s place, yang’s number balances yin.
The sun waxes, the moon wanes, cold and heat divide.
The pattern unfolds, resplendent with script.
Only this Dao endures as heaven and earth."*

Xi bowed and said, "I reverently receive your teaching on the ingredients. But what of the furnace and crucible, the timing of water and fire?"

Lord Lao chanted:
*"Round as three-five, a tenth of an inch,
Mouth four-eight, lips two inches,
Two inches long, thickness even.
Belly threefold, warmth descending.
Yin above, yang below rushing.
Head and tail martial, center civil.
Begin with seventy, end at thirty,
Two hundred within, well-tempered.
White yin fire, yellow sprout silver,
Two sevens gather, aiding the adept.
Dwell in the palace, secure and abiding,
Roam and return without leaving the gate.
Gradually grow great, nature pure,
Return to the One, restore the origin.
When one cycle completes, be diligent,
Guard closely, never stray into confusion.
The path is distant, profoundly mysterious.
If you attain this, you will meet heaven and earth.
At midnight and noon, moisten soul and spirit,
Gain long life, enter the immortal village.
Those who delight in the Dao, seek its text,
Ponder deeply, speak no more."*

He chanted again:
*"Sun and moon are the essence of heaven and earth,
The hexagrams revolve, clearly manifest.
Three-five before, three-five after,
Five-six makes thirty, then reborn.
Born and extinguished, twelve cycles,
Twelve divides into twenty-four.
Within the twenty-four qi, all shifts,
All images and hexagrams reside here.
Mercury, one flavor, splits in two,
Transforming yin and yang, becoming ‘already’ and ‘not yet.’
‘Already’ and ‘not yet’ pair as husband and wife,
Then the pot holds heaven and earth."*

And again:
*"The Golden Fluid Returning Elixir flows with immortal splendor,
Soaring high on clouds, ascending celestial mounds.
Red and yellow substances form in an instant,
Obtaining the chaotic pearl of yin and yang.
It can summon transformations and summon the kitchen,
Spiritual beings and jade maidens accompany you.
Entering and exiting, no need to ask—one with heaven’s tally.
Its essence congeals like frost, adept at sinking and floating.
If you reverently await, they will surely come.
The secrets of the Golden Fluid end here."*

"When the elixir is complete, fashion vessels from gold to eat from, and you too may attain long life. First test the gold—only when it is perfected may you ingest it. Thus it is said: *Gold can be made, the world can be delivered.*"

Thereupon, he bestowed upon Xi the *Tai Qing Ba Fu Jing*, the *Tai Qing Guan Tian Jing*, the *Jiu Du Jing*, the *Shen Dan Jing*, the *Jin Ye Jing*, and the *Ba Lian Jiu Zhuan Huan Dan Fu Huo Jue*. Lord Lao further instructed, "If you truly desire to become a divine immortal, you must first ingest the Returning Elixir and Golden Fluid. If you do not, your suffering will be in vain—afflicted by cold, heat, wind, and damp, struck by demonic qi, even the Controller of Destinies cannot save you. Can you not strive?"

Strive diligently in elixir-making, and take early precautions to guard yourself. Do not reveal these teachings to fools, lest they mock and slander the divine Dao, compounding your transgressions.

Alas! Though the walking corpse may possess all things under heaven and hold rank as prince or lord, before a hundred years pass, it becomes but a basket of earth—how pitiable! Yet in the toil of compounding the divine elixir, though the labor lasts but a moment, once perfected, you ascend as an immortal, your years equaling heaven’s, your heart’s desires fulfilled—can such joy ever end?

Xi asked, "In refining gold and ingesting qi, are there two distinct Ways?"

Lord Lao replied, "The essence of heaven and earth, the root of yin and yang—these are the two qi. The yang dragon and yin tiger, the liquid of wood and the essence of metal—when these two qi unite and are refined, it is called the Outer Elixir. Holding harmony within and refining the storehouse, exhaling the old and inhaling the new, ascending to the Mud Pill Palace, descending to the Cinnabar Field, circulating without cease, ascending at dawn to the Crimson Palace, gathering from the Five Treasuries to nourish the hundred spirits—this is the Inner Elixir. Those who cultivate the Dao and attain the Inner Elixir may prolong their years; those who attain the Outer Elixir may ascend to heaven. The Three Ones and Nine Contemplations are the essence of inner cultivation; the Nine Elixirs and Golden Fluid are the pinnacle of outer refinement. Cultivate both together, and the Dao is perfected."

Xi again entreated, "I have received your instruction on the method of refining gold—may I now hear of ingesting qi?"

Lord Lao said, "To ingest qi and secure essence, receive the *Mysterious Classic of Radiance*. The essential subtleties of the generative Dao emerge from darkness into light. Above, secure the Cloud Gate; below, fortify the numinous root. To know this is easy; to practice it is difficult. When the body moves, virtue scatters; when qi strays, the Dao parts. Essence dissipates, the hun-soul wanes, the eyes stir, and the po-soul is thrown into chaos. Thus the sage stills the body and secures qi, hoards essence and cherishes vision—then the Dao and virtue congeal in emptiness, the hun and po are firmly guarded, the body is one, the spirit myriad, and the Dao is accomplished.

"Always after midnight, lie supine with fists clenched, inhale pure qi through the nose, and exhale slowly through the mouth. Then guard the Three Ones, enter the chamber, and practice the Nine Contemplations. When spirit is settled and qi is at peace, the immortal Dao draws near."

Thereupon, he bestowed upon Xi the *Thirty-Five Chapters of the Jade Calendar Classic*. Xi said, "I beg you to instruct me on the meaning of the Three Ones."

Lord Lao replied, "The Way of the Three Ones is revered by divine immortals, yet the world rarely hears of it—guard it well as a secret. Between the brows, one inch inward is the Hall of Light; two inches inward, the Grotto Chamber; three inches inward, the Mud Pill Palace—this is the Upper Cinnabar Field. Within it dwells the Red Child, styled Yuanxian, named Imperial Minister. The heart is the Crimson Palace, the Middle Cinnabar Field. Within it dwells the Perfected One, styled Zidan, named Radiant Firmness. Three inches inward from the navel is the Gate of Destiny, the Lower Cinnabar Field. Within it dwells the Infant, styled Yuanyang, named Mystic Valley. All are three inches in height, clad alike in red robes, red shoes, and red caps—these are the Three Ones. (Another version says: the Upper One wears purple, the Middle One red, the Lower One yellow, each in the form of an infant.) Below stands a golden forest and jade table, where with a golden furnace and jade spoon they stir the essence to nourish the Upper One, Middle One, and Lower One. You must visualize this day and night.

"If you desire long life, the Three Ones must be made clear. If you can guard the One, the One will guard you. Qi transforms into essence, essence into spirit, spirit into the infant, and the infant ascends as the Perfected One. The Perfected One then becomes the Red Child—this is the true One.

"It is also said: The false Dao nurtures the form; the true Dao nurtures the spirit. When spirit is true, the Dao is penetrated—it can vanish or endure. Spirit can make the body fly or move mountains. When the body turns to ash and earth, what awareness remains? The ears and eyes, sounds and sights, are transgressions that bind you; the nose and mouth, fragrances and flavors, are foes. The body is the root of affliction—pain, itching, cold, heat; the mind is the burden of form—sorrow, poison, worry, vexation. If you do not swiftly cast these aside, your will and qi will daily diminish, and your lifespan will not be prolonged. This has been so for ages. You must first diminish all desires and prevent the mind from straying. Dwell in seclusion, still your thoughts, and fast in purity. Though you may have ten thousand scrolls of elixir scriptures, they are not equal to guarding the One. Always take emptiness as your body and nothingness as your mind. The body of no-body, the mind of no-mind—this is called guarding the spirit. When spirit is guarded and the mysterious is penetrated, it is called unity with the Dao. It is like lofty mountains and vast marshes—not seeking insects, fish, birds, or beasts, yet they gather there of their own accord. If one can be empty, desireless, and non-active, though not seeking the Dao, the Dao will naturally come to them." (I have seen this in the *Scripture of Western Ascension*.)

Then he bestowed upon Xi the method of the Nine Refinements of the Golden Perfected of Grand Yang, calling it the Nine Chambers of Contemplation: First, the Contemplation of No Deviant Thoughts; second, the Contemplation of Upright Body; third, the Contemplation of Attaining Rectitude; fourth, the Contemplation of Grand Rectitude; fifth, the Contemplation of Utmost Rectitude; sixth, the Contemplation of Profound Rectitude; seventh, the Contemplation of True Rectitude; eighth, the Contemplation of Penetrating the Mysterious; ninth, the Contemplation of Grand Penetration. Entering these nine chambers and practicing these nine contemplations, you will unite your form with Grand Yang and together attain the Dao.

Xi received all these secrets, bowed twice, and prostrated himself, reverently cherishing the profound grace. Thereupon, he resigned from office on grounds of illness. On the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth month, he respectfully invited Lord Lao to his home. Another day, he asked, "My mind is dull and I know not what to ask—may I request further instruction?"

Lord Lao said, "If you wish to cultivate the body and nurture nature, practice the Dao and discipline the form, congeal qi into spirit, and attain endless continuity, nothing precedes stillness. Thus heaven is still to establish constancy, spirit is still to effect transformation, and man is still to attain life. When about to still yourself, turn your hearing inward and observe within. Let the mind not harbor reckless thoughts, the mouth not utter reckless words, the body not make reckless movements. The color of no-color becomes visible, the sound of no-sound becomes audible, the flavor of no-flavor becomes sweet, the teaching of no-words becomes instruction. The numinous radiance descends, blessings and virtue arrive, and harmonious qi responds. If you wish to still the spirit, first bathe and fast for twenty-five days, then refine your body until the hun and po are at peace—only then may you enter the chamber."

Upon entering the chamber, should a cinnabar serpent appear upon your heart, or the Queen Mother of the West descend, or a Dao-body manifest in response—these are but the spirits within your own body testing you. Remain unalarmed. If questioned, do not answer; if harmed or offended, do not fear. Simply settle the mind and steady the will, and the apparitions will depart of their own accord.

After twenty-five days, forty-five days, sixty days, eighty-five days, one hundred and five days, one hundred and twenty-five days, one hundred and fifty days, or one hundred and eighty days, spirits may come—all to test you. Keep the mind at peace and do not engage, and they cannot harm you. If fear arises and the trial is failed, the Way is lost. Be vigilant and cautious. After one hundred and eighty days, the chamber will brighten of itself, and matters of safety, peril, life, and death will be foreknown without exception. The palaces and chambers within the body will all become visible.

After two hundred and eighty days, all illnesses will vanish. After one year, scars will fade entirely. After a thousand days, both form and spirit will attain perfection, and you will become a Perfected Person. Then shall you be granted the *Wondrous Truth*, *Inner Explication*, *Supreme Methods of the Great Clarity*, *Three Admonitions of the True Scripture*, *Talismans and Diagrams of the Numinous Treasure*, and the *Great Mystery*, among other teachings, to instruct the most refined and benevolent. Thus shall the feathered transformation of divine immortality be perpetuated without end.

Xi bowed his head in reverence and gave thanks. The master then said to Xi: "I tell you again—of old, the Former Master was none other than my own body, once transformed in the land of Jambudvīpa. Now I shall return my spirit to the nameless, abiding endlessly as if present. I depart now, returning to the One Source."

As the Old Lord prepared to journey west, Xi kowtowed and begged to accompany him. The Old Lord replied: "I roam beyond heaven and earth, play within the depths of the Dark and Mysterious, traversing the four directions and eight limits, above and below without bound. How could you follow me?"

Xi said: "To enter fire or abyss, to ascend to heaven or descend to earth, to reduce this body to ashes or forfeit this life—I wish to follow the Great Immortal."

The Old Lord said: "Those who attain the Way can see through all with their eyes, hear through all with their ears, and perform transformations beyond measure, now hidden, now manifest, yet still they cannot follow me on my distant travels. Though your bones and countenance accord with the Dao and you are destined to achieve perfection, you have received the teachings but briefly and cannot yet penetrate the divine. How could you transform and follow my sacred body?"

Xi bowed again and asked: "May I hear of the Way of penetrating the divine and performing transformations?"

The Old Lord said: "The qi of the living and the forms of the shaped are all illusions. That from which creation begins, that which yin and yang transform—this is called life

The following year, in the jia-yin cycle, on the twenty-eighth day of the fourth month, the Old Lord prepared to take leave of Xi at his dwelling on the southern hill and ascend to heaven. The reason the Old Lord had not yet journeyed west but instead ascended was to await Guan Yin’s attainment of the Dao, that they might together transform the Western Regions.

Xi, overcome with sorrow and longing, pleaded for him to stay. The Old Lord once more instructed him in the principles of dispelling defilements, stilling thoughts, and guarding the One with a tranquil mind. He admonished Xi, saying: "After a thousand days, you may seek me at the Green Sheep Market in Shu."

Having spoken, he rose into the air, seated upon a cloud of radiant hues. His face emitted fivefold brilliance, his body shone with golden light, illuminating the ten directions. Slowly he ascended, his glow entwining the dwelling in five colors of dark and yellow. After a long while, he vanished from sight. Xi, his gaze fixed upon the clouds, wept and reached out in longing.

That day, rivers swelled and overflowed, mountains and streams trembled, and a five-colored light pierced the Purple Tenuity (or, as the *Records of the Grand Historian* has it, the Purple Subtlety), suffusing the four quarters. From the ninth year of King Gaozong of Yin to this day, two hundred and seventy-four years had passed.

Xi then took the Old Lord’s essential teachings on governing the state and cultivating the self, his words on abandoning extravagance and extinguishing desire, and compiled them into thirty-six chapters. As these were expounded at the time of his ascent to the Western Ultimate, the text was named the *Scripture of Western Ascension*. The humble cart the Old Lord had ridden was treasured by successive dynasties and remains extant to this day. The platform from which he ascended lies south of the Louguan Temple and is now commonly called the Old Lord’s Mound.

At the moment of his ascent, a five-colored light pierced the Purple Tenuity and suffused the four quarters. King Zhao inquired of his Grand Historian concerning the auspicious or inauspicious omens. The Grand Historian replied: "A sage shall depart to the west; after a thousand years, his teachings shall return here." King Zhao then had this recorded at the suburban altar.

This was the portent of the Western Transformation. From King Zhao’s jia-yin year to the Yongping era of the Han, precisely a thousand years had passed.

Xi then retired to a thatched hut, purified himself in fasting, and severed all worldly affairs. Within three years, his cultivation was complete. His mind congealed, his form dissolved; hunger and thirst no longer afflicted him, nor did cold or heat. He mastered the subtleties of reckoning and transformation, the principles of unifying form and multiplying spirit, attaining their utmost mystery.

Thereafter, he composed nine chapters, which he titled the *Guanzi*. In the ding-si year, he journeyed to western Shu in search of the Green Sheep Market. The Old Lord had ascended in the jia-yin year, and by the yi-mao year, he had divided his body from the Palace of Grand Tenuity to descend and be reborn in the household of the great official Li of Shu. He had previously saved the Azure Dragon of the Green Emperor, transforming it into a sheep—its coat lustrous and pure, its color like green gold. It remained by the infant’s side, eating rice without instruction. One day, the sheep suddenly vanished, and the child, searching for it, found it in the market. When Xi arrived in Shu, he inquired among the locals, but none knew of the Green Sheep Market. Suddenly, he saw a child leading a sheep and thought to himself: "Since there is a green sheep, and it is in the market, the sage’s promise must lie here." He asked: "Whose sheep is this, and where are you taking it?" The child replied: "My lady gave birth to a son, and this sheep eats rice by his side. It went missing two days ago, and the child has wept without cease. Now that I’ve found it, I’m taking it home."

Xi then instructed the child: "Please inform the lady’s son that Yin Xi has arrived." The child did as told and relayed the message. The infant immediately straightened his clothes and rose, saying: "Summon Xi to come forward." When Xi entered the household, the halls and courtyards suddenly expanded, and lotus thrones emerged. The Old Lord transformed into a body of white gold, towering several *zhang* in height, his brilliance like the sun, a halo encircling his neck. He wore a crown adorned with the seven luminaries, robes of morning essence, and a nine-colored mantle of parted silk. Seated upon the lotus throne, the entire household marveled in astonishment.

The Old Lord said: "This dwelling is the Palace of Grand Tenuity; my true body is the One. Supreme Harmony descends as essence, and the luminous soul becomes man. Guest and host are mutually dependent—why be astonished?"

Yin Xi prostrated himself in joy, weeping and leaping with boundless delight. He bowed his head and said: "I never dared hope to again behold your celestial countenance. May I ask how the Venerable One emerged from non-being into being, and how you fare?"

The Old Lord replied calmly: "Since we parted, what have you gained or lost? In preserving the Dao and guarding the One, have you found benefit?"

Xi bowed his head and said: "Since receiving your secret essentials, I have roughly grasped their mystery. My ancestors have all received boundless blessings."

The Old Lord said: "Good. The reason I kept you here is that you have dwelled in the world for a long time, deeply entangled in love and attachment. Though you first received the scriptural instructions, you had not yet achieved success. Thus, I awaited you here. Now, you have preserved your form and refined your *qi*; your three years of effort are complete. You have attained true subtlety, your heart bound with purple threads, your face radiant with divine light. Your golden name is inscribed on the Dark Diagram, your jade tablet tied to the Purple Chamber. Your *qi* merges with Grand Tenuity; you have dissolved your form and united with the Real."

Xi bowed twice, prostrating himself in gratitude, and said: "The sagely teacher’s virtue surpasses heaven and earth; your kindness exceeds that of father and mother. Heaven and earth can cover and bear me, yet they cannot grant me the Dao; my parents gave birth to and raised me, yet they cannot make me endure forever."

The Old Lord said: "This is also due to your own mysterious allotment."

He then commanded the summoning of the hosts of the Three Realms. In an instant, the Lords of the Heavens, the Divine Kings of the Ten Directions, and the multitudes of immortals arrived, floating in the air. Each held incense and flowers, bowing their heads to receive his decree.

The Old Lord instructed the Five Elder Thearchs and the Four Poles’ Overseers of the Real to confer upon Xi a jade tablet and golden script, bestowing the title "Master of the Literary Beginning" and the rank of Supreme Perfected. He granted him a crown of purple hibiscus, a skirt of flying kingfisher feathers, sleeves of cinnabar and green, a rainbow robe of intersecting harmony, a yellow sash of silk patterns, a nine-colored staff, and five thousand jade boys and jade maidens. He was to reside above the Twenty-Four Heavenly Kings and command eighty thousand immortals.

Xi descended in obeisance, prostrating himself, and said: "This dust-born child, having encountered the Great Sage, has been granted flesh upon withered bones. A thousand lifetimes of fortune could not equal this."

Xi was thus appointed to oversee the tasks of wealth and sweeping, with attendants readied for his journeys—this was both his desire and his honor. His rank and title were lofty, his ceremonial grace abundant. Ashamed of his meager virtue, how could he dare refuse? The Old Lord said: "You have long yearned for the Dao, your hidden virtue ascending to be heard. Your cultivation has been diligent, your mysterious merit now fulfilled. This is no favor I bestow upon you alone; press on with resolve." Xi, unable to decline, bowed twice and accepted the mandate.

From then on, he could soar through the empty void, attending the Dragon Chariot and roaming the Eight Directions. The Old Lord then expounded the *Primordial Yang Sutra* to the Great Official and Sacred Mother, and in an instant, her household of over two hundred—young and old—ascended to heaven together. The Old Lord, having accumulated merit and virtue, was fated to ascend, and thus manifested within her family. Today in Chengdu, the Green Ram Palace, the Birth-Descending Terrace, and the Boyang Terrace remain as vestiges. The Hanlin Academician and Drafter-in-Waiting, Yue Penggui, was commissioned by imperial decree to compose the stele.

The Old Lord said to Perfected Lord Yin: "Long ago, you wished to wander far with me. Now that your Dao is complete, you may roam beyond the Eight Cords." Thereupon, he exhaled the hidden script of the Eight Directions and bestowed it upon him. Xi, having received the transmission, summoned the Eight Radiance Cloud Chariot. The Old Lord mounted the chariot, drawn by five-colored divine dragons, bearing the Vermilion Nodes of the Flowing Empyrean and the Nine-Light Crane Canopy. Twelve guardian officials led the way, celestial soldiers wielding banners. Behind followed ninety thousand flying immortals, their pennants fluttering, lions clearing the path, phoenixes flanking the carriage. They traversed the void in formation, with the Perfected Lord and the Four Heavenly Kings in attendance.

They arrived at the Mountain of the Sun’s Cavern and the Eternal Radiance, where they plucked the cinnabar stalks of the Fusang and scattered the crimson blossoms of the Ruomu. They beheld the Azure Sea and embraced the Eastern Well. Passing the Jade Pool Palace, the Divine King of the Sun Valley and the Azure Lads of the Eastern Sea presented cinnabar fruits and golden nectars of jade-green wine. Next, they ascended the Ancestral Mountain, gazed upon the Mushroom Fields, gathered spirit-nourishing herbs, and rested at the Penglai Palace.

They then journeyed south to Phoenix Mountain, climbed Green Mound, crossed the Purple Court, where the Supreme Prime Perfected Lord and the Purple Court Master offered Nine-Light Sweet Dew, White Veined Jade Essence, and Azure Grove White Seeds. This mountain was also called Xiao Mound, yielding the essence of Nine Lights and the cloth of the Fire Court. Next, they ascended Longli Mountain, crossed the Crimson Ford, and entered the Great Cinnabar Palace, where the Lady of the Southern Culmen served jade-blossom wine and crimson-spirit fire dates. Arriving at Crimson Mountain, they observed the Land of Flowing Fire, rested at the Scarlet Mound’s gate, where the Jade Perfected of Supreme Harmony and the Upper Duke of the Florid Canopy presented embers of the Flame Ridge, flying cinnabar purple peaches, and the liquid of cloud waves.

They then traveled west to Tortoise Terrace, entered the Seven Treasures Garden, and beheld the Flying Mystery Purple Script. Passing the Flowing Essence Gate, the Nine Numinous Metal Mother and the Primordial Sovereign of the Great Simplicity offered jade-script dates, their fruit like ingots, and commanded her attendants to present soul-returning incense, dark-light azure peaches, and golden-purple intertwined pears. Next, they sailed the Weak Waters, climbed Phoenix Mountain, entered the Jade Pool, and rested at Kunwu Mountain, where the White Emperor Heavenly Lord gathered Seven Luminous Stone Mushrooms, flowing essence jade cream, and golden-light cinnabar wine to offer them.

They journeyed north to the Hollow Cavern Mountain, passed the Cavern Yin Palace, where the Northern Culmen Perfected Lord presented Ten-Knotted Spirit Herbs, dark-cloud plums, and hollow melons—melons that ripen once every four kalpas. Ascending the Dark Mound, they observed the Eight Refining Pools of the Northern Darkness, rested at the Vast Cold Ruins, where the Supreme Mystery Immortal Earl offered crimson-tree cinnabar fruits and Three Mysteries purple crabapples.

They then ascended the Central Marchmount, Kunlun Mountain—this was not the Five Marchmounts of the mortal world, but the divine mountain beyond the seas. The Eastern Marchmount was called Broad Mulberry, the Southern Marchmount Longli, the Western Marchmount Lovely Agriculture, the Northern Marchmount Vast Wilds, and the Central Marchmount Kunlun. They roamed the Jasper Terrace and Jade Tower, beheld the Seven Treasures’ Jade Grove, listened to the nine-plumed phoenix’s song, and gazed upon the sun, moon, and stars in radiant exchange. Below, the Four Heavens lay as if in the palm of their hand. Atop the mountain stood golden terraces and jade towers, seven-treasured palaces, luminous day and night, where the Heavenly Thearchs and divine kings roamed and dwelled. On one side were two hundred and forty gates, pearl and jade groves, purple blossoms, cinnabar fruits, and azure leaves. The jade music was like zither and lute, harmonizing with the pitch-pipes. The Great Mystery Nine Palaces were the abodes of immortals, all with natural celestial kitchens, their comings and goings as they willed. The heavenly retinues were exquisite, the music beyond compare—truly the Pure Capital of the Inner Realm, the grand spectacle of divine perfected beings.

When Perfected Lord Yin first received the office of Youthful Perfected, he followed the Old Lord in touring these and the world’s Five Marchmounts, grotto-heavens, palaces, and the four seas’ rivers, springs, and water palaces. Their lords were sometimes called Sacred Thearchs, sometimes Perfected Kings, or Dukes or Marquises. In their consultations, they often discussed the Two Modes and Three Radiances, the yin-yang qi and seasons, the length and brevity of kalpas; the lifespans of emperors and kings, their peace and peril, rise and fall; the fortunes and misfortunes of the multitudes; the stages of learning the Dao and ascending as immortals, the matters of demotion and promotion; the harmonizing of qi and seasons, the methods of suppressing and dissolving the Yang Nine and Hundred Six calamitous convergences. Sometimes they sought instruction on the origins of the Dao and virtue, the subtleties of the formless and traceless. The Old Lord answered all as requested, his words profound and obscure, untransmitted to the world.

The Old Lord said to Xi: "I shall now ascend with you to the Jade Dawn Court and wander the Emperor’s Realm." As he spoke, the eightfold numinous sounds arose, cloud steeds gathered from the four directions, and they slowly ascended into the void. They traversed the Nine Heavens, where the Heavenly Thearchs of each realm came to welcome the Old Lord into their palaces, offering jade blossoms and immortal fruits, moon liquid and cloud nectar, spirit mushrooms and celestial fruits. Radiance illuminated the seats, heavenly music filled the air, and the divine songs were wondrous beyond compare. The Heavenly Thearchs and immortal perfected beings all bowed in reverence, entreating the natural, supreme, mysterious, and perfect Dao of the Primordial One. Then the Supreme Perfected of the Upper Prime, the Supreme Immortal of the Middle Prime, and the Supreme Immortal Earl of the Lower Prime arrived in jade-green and yellow cloud chariots, drawn by azure qilin and lions, bearing canopies of intersecting radiance, streaming rosy clouds, simurghs, flying cranes, and phoenixes. They wielded the Sun Essence’s Perfected Banner, the Moon Radiance’s Demon-Quelling Nodes, and the Star Light’s Immortal Flags.

Amidst the procession, one hundred fifty thousand attendant immortals and spirit officials—seventy thousand from the Upper Prime, fifty thousand from the Middle Prime, and thirty thousand from the Lower Prime—followed in ranked array, their cloud chariots, canopies, banners, and ritual staffs likewise graded by station. Each bore incense and flowers, bowing their heads in reverent welcome as the Lord Lao ascended to the Vermilion City of the Sun Gate and the Jeweled Pearl Palace in the Upper Clarity heavens. There, the Lord commanded the Joyous Audience to pay homage to the Highest Sage, the Jade Dawn, the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao. In response, the Dao Lord bestowed upon him twelve treasures: the Joyous Ring, the Unyielding Elixir, the Hidden Dragon Mushroom, the Pearl Blossom, the Jade Nectar, and other sacred offerings.

From there, the Lord descended with his retinue to the numinous mountains of Tianshui, arriving at the present-day Mount Qiling in Qinzhou of the Western Regions, where the Western Ascent Terrace and the Hall of the Sacred Countenance stood beneath the cliffs. Earlier, when the Lord had departed the Zhou court, he had journeyed westward to transform the lands of Da Qin, Anxi, Yuezhi, Wuge, and Jambudvipa, where he was known as the Ancient Master. Their kings and subjects all embraced his teachings and precepts. Later, he returned to China with the Supreme Perfected Yin Xi, traveling to the kingdom of Yanbin to propagate the Dao, then proceeding to the lands of Tiaozhi and Khotan, where he subdued ninety-five schools of heterodox teachings.

In the fourth year of King Mu’s reign, the cyclical year jiashen, the Lord descended to roam the Eastern Sea, meeting the Great Emperor at Fusang to review and rank the merits of the various immortals. He then divided his form to descend upon the Western Sea, journeying to the kingdom of Sulin to spread the teachings before ascending once more to heaven. King Mu, who had long cherished the Way of divine transcendents, climbed Mount Zhong to the Jasper Pool before returning to his capital. He reigned for fifty-four years and lived to the age of one hundred and four.

After Yin Xi had crossed the Flowing Sands, his thatched hermitage stood on the northern slopes of Mount Zhongnan. The king, longing for the numinous presence, ordered his chariot to visit the site, where he had an abbey and shrine constructed. He appointed Du Chong and six others as Daoist priests to oversee the rites. During the reign of King Yi, the Lord, accompanied by the Three Ancient Masters, descended upon Mount Sanxue in Mianzhu of Shu, where he transmitted the Way of Ascension to Li Duoduo, who thereafter governed as Lord Duoduo.

In the twenty-first year of King Li’s reign, the cyclical year jiachen, the Lord descended to Louguan, where he bestowed upon the Daoist Song Lun the *Way of the Middle Effulgence*, the *Scripture of Penetrating the Real*, and the *Six Jia Talismans of the Numinous Flight in Plain Silk*. In the twenty-third year of King Ping’s reign, the cyclical year guimao, in the twelfth month, the Lord once again emerged from the Pass to enlighten the various kingdoms. He then traveled to the Western Sea, visiting the islands of Liulin and others to examine the merits and practices of the assembled immortals before ascending once more to heaven.

During the reign of King Ding, the king inquired of the Lord regarding the divine transcendents of the world. The Lord replied: "On the Eastern Marchmount resides Master Zhan Qin; on the Southern Marchmount, Master Kuang Xu; on the Western Marchmount, Yin Xi; on the Northern Marchmount, the August Person; and on the Central Marchmount, the Ancient Master—that is I."

In the eighth year of King Xian’s reign, the cyclical year gengshen, during the reign of Duke Xiao of Qin, the Lord returned eastward. Accompanied by the Perfected Yin and others, he wandered to the Red City of Shangyu and Mount Meng, revisiting the Fusang abode of the Great Emperor to review the assembled transcendents. Thereafter, he concealed himself in the Scenic Chamber Mountain of Luoyang. At times, five white-haired elders—some riding cranes, others clad in feathered robes, leaning on staffs of green bamboo—would gather to discourse on the reckonings of heaven and earth, though none in the world recognized them.

The Lord composed scriptures totaling one hundred thousand words. Beside him stood two divine attendants, bearing a golden flask filled with ink dark as pure lacquer, with which they inscribed the texts. Wherever the ink touched wood or stone, it formed characters in the ancient seal and great seal scripts.

In the ninth year of King Nan’s reign, the cyclical year yimao, the Lord, accompanied by the Perfected Yin and other immortals, wandered the mountains of Nüji, Difei, and Tianzhu. He then exited the western pass, crossed the Flowing Sands, ascended Kunlun, and returned to the Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace before journeying back to the homeland of the Supreme Mystery. When King Zhao of Qin learned of this, he lamented not having witnessed the event and ordered the construction of cities and towns along the western frontier where the Lord had passed, marking the sacred sites. To this day, the old post station of Lao Ting and the city of Yin Xi remain, their ruins still extant.

**Yin Gui, the Perfected of Great Harmony**
The Perfected of Great Harmony, Yin Gui, styled Gongdu, was a native of Taiyuan and the younger cousin of Master Wen Shi. From youth, he studied astronomy and was well-versed in apocrypha and weft texts. He came to serve the Master, who taught him to ingest the flowers of yellow essence and transmitted to him over a hundred Daoist scriptures, each accompanied by oral instructions. After the Master ascended in perfection, Yin Gui, then twenty-eight, secluded himself with the hermit Du Chong and others in the Master’s former residence to cultivate the teachings. He abstained from grains to nourish his qi and devoted himself to the highest methods.

The Supreme Lord took pity on him and bestowed upon him the title Perfected of Great Harmony, appointing him to oversee the immortal officials at the Du Yang Palace. Yin Gui often traveled abroad, carrying over ten tubes of divine elixirs, traversing the world to aid those in need. Sometimes he refined gold and silver to relieve the poor; at other times, he administered elixirs to rescue those in peril. All who sought his mercy received his blessings.

His comings and goings were unfathomable, his presence and absence inscrutable. Thus, the *Imperial Chapters of the Upper Clarity’s Jeweled Writ* states: "The Perfected of Great Harmony, together with the Perfected of Mount Taihua, the Three Heavens’ Lord of Longevity, the Southern Culmen’s General Overseer, the Northern Emperor’s Central Attendant of the Western Terrace, the Nine Numinous Princes of the Central Perfected, the Jade Maiden of the Supreme Numinous, the Crimson Essence Jade Youth, Master of the Dark Valley, Master Red Pine of the Southern Marchmount, Wang Qiao of Mount Zhong, the Perfected of Purple Yang, the Lord of the Western City, Master Zhonghuang Zhao Boxuan, Shan Zhongzong, and others—all cultivated the *Highest Methods of the Three Perfected Treasure Scriptures*. Their faces radiated golden light, their necks bore halos, and they rode the void to ascend the heavens, roaming and feasting in the Purple Court. Their transformations were boundless, their movements free and unfettered. At a whistle, they summoned all spirits; with a command, they subdued demonic forces and decided matters of life and death. They rode the clouds and mist, entering and departing the imperial courts of heaven."

In the second year of Emperor Hui of Jin’s Yongxing reign, he donned the Heaven-Penetrating Crown, wielded the Spirit-Subduing Staff, wore a crimson ceremonial skirt, and draped himself in a yellow-patterned robe. From the east, he arrived at the abbey of the Perfected Yin. At that time, the Daoist Liang Chen bowed his head and expressed his desire to present his studies. Yin Gui said to him: "I am the younger cousin of the Supreme Perfected Master Wen Shi. When the Master ascended in perfection, I was twenty-eight years old. Already, I had abstained from grains to nourish my qi and devoted myself to the highest Dao."

The Most High took pity on me and thus granted me ascent to the Great Harmony, entrusting me with the governance of the immortal officials at the Abbey of Du Chang. This abbey spans four thousand *li* from east to west and seven hundred *li* from north to south. It is encircled by ninefold golden walls and adorned with ten jade towers. Its palaces, furnishings, divine mushrooms, and sacred herbs defy enumeration. The myriad scrolls of the *Supreme Clarity*, *Primal Yang*, and *Great Cavern* scriptures—numbering in the hundreds of thousands—are all guarded by golden lads and jade maidens. Naturally, there are sun, moon, and stars, clouds and mist, concealed radiance and flowing essence, illuminating all below. The immortals, numbering in the tens of thousands, shimmer with divine light, live eternally, and abide in effortless freedom. Some roam the mortal realm, while others ascend to the Jade Capital to proclaim and assess all deeds—good and evil—and the karmic retribution and predestined cycles of beings. Some discourse on the celestial motions of heaven and earth, the sun, moon, and stars, and the measured or swift passage of time. Others feast among the heavens, deliberating the ranks and administrative methods of immortals as recorded in the divine registers. Some establish the protocols for the demeanor and bearing of youthful perfected ones and nascent immortals. Others oversee the mortal realm, inspecting the merits of those who perform virtuous deeds, erect altars, and hold fasts. Some supervise the ordination of male and female Dao seekers, as well as the arts of medicinal recipes and elixirs. Others traverse the hundreds of mountains and thousands of rivers, reviewing the records of divine overseers and ghostly officials to examine the causes of sin and fortune. Still others deliberate on matters of wind and rain, thunder and lightning, floods and droughts, abundance and scarcity.

My form knows no fixed appearance: at times a Daoist, at others a scholar, a child, or an elder—unconfined to a single path. Sometimes, I ride with the perfected immortals, the dragon-serpents and phoenixes, soaring through the void, racing like clouds and lightning, emerging from existence and vanishing into nothingness, multiplying my form and scattering my shadow, gathering and wandering everywhere. At times, I patrol the grottoes of the Five Marchmounts, or journey to the islands of the Ten Continents, or venture beyond the Eight Wastes, or descend into the Nine Dark Realms. Sometimes, I fish at the azure sea’s ford, or embrace the snow of the Black Hills, or pluck cinnabar blossoms from the Board Garden, or gather crimson fruits from the Jade Orchard. All this has been achieved through the accumulation of merit, the study of sacred texts, and the endurance of toil and hardship.

By now, I have lived over one thousand three hundred years, and the events I have witnessed are too numerous to record in your brief missives. I have merely outlined their general scope.

On the first day of the eighth month, I suddenly refined my body and ascended into the heavens, rising gently aloft. The lingering sound of pipes and flutes could still be heard, while only my robes and implements remained below.

Your servant Dao Yi says: Yin Gui’s Dao was lofty, his virtue wondrous, and his meritorious deeds unparalleled. His radiant form multiplied, and his divine powers were vast. As the *Dao De Jing* states: *"The ancient masters who excelled as scholars were subtly mysterious, profoundly penetrating, so deep as to be unknowable. It is only because they were unknowable that one is compelled to describe their appearance."* Such was Yin Gui—truly one who grasped its essence.

Du Chong

The Perfected of the Great Ultimate, Du Chong, styled Xuanyi, was a native of Gaojing. In the twenty-seventh year of King Zhao of Zhou, the ding-si year, upon hearing that Master Wen Shi had attained transcendence, he took residence at this numinous abode to cultivate the Dao in seclusion. At that time, recluses and eremites came from afar—five in number (the *Veritable Records of the Primal Origin* states seven). All were serene and detached, refined and lofty in character, their arts of the Dao mutually forgotten as they together upheld the principle of non-contention.

The master’s original residence, granted a hundred *yi* of gold during the reign of King Kang of Zhou, was extensively renovated and bestowed the name "Tower Abbey." Chong dwelled there, chanting and reciting the *Dao De Jing*, nurturing and guarding his spirit and qi. When King Mu learned of this, he had the abbey repaired and a shrine built, appointing Chong as a Daoist master. His qi was as balanced as that of [the sages] Chao and Xu, and his virtue served as a model for all things. Thus, the Son of Heaven honored him without subjecting him to servitude, and the feudal lords revered him without conferring rank.

After Chong had resided at Tower Abbey for over twenty years, the Perfected Zhenren Zhan Xiansheng descended in the quiet of his chamber. Two attendants stood to his left and right, bearing a case of green jade. Chong bowed his head and pleaded humbly, whereupon he was granted two cases of the *Scripture of the Nine Radiant Elixirs*. The master said to him: "Lord Lao and Master Yin summoned the Great Emperor at the Eight Haltings Mountain in the Eastern Sea to assemble the host of Perfected. Daoist immortals from grotto-heavens and mountain caves throughout the world came without exception. At that time, the local earth officials commended your diligence, and Lord Lao bestowed upon you this scripture of transcendence." Chong followed the formula in compounding and ingesting the elixir, whereupon his body took on a jade-like luster, his five viscera became firm and moist, and his countenance and breath were suffused with qi.

Later, the Perfected Li Jun appeared to him and transmitted the *Supreme Scripture of the Primordial Numinous Grotto’s Profound and Vast Wonders*. Chong cultivated it anew and found its effects most efficacious. Thereupon, he dissolved the bonds of the womb and untied the knots of fate, preserving life and congealing his true nature, commanding the host of spirits and penetrating the mysteries of all things.

King Mu personally revered the teachings of the Dao, seeking divine transcendence. Together, they harnessed steeds swift as the wind, covering a thousand *li* in a day. Midway, they reached Kunlun Mountain and ascended the Palace of the Mystic Orchard. To the west, they journeyed to Tortoise Mountain and paid homage to the Queen Mother in the Azure Jade Chamber. To the east, they roamed the Azure Sea, offering reverence to the Venerable Elder and gathering the blossoms of the Fusang Tree. To the north, they traveled to the Dark Mound, and to the south, they crossed the Long Flights, together embracing the marrow of Crimson Mountain. They drove tigers and leopards, commanded the hundred spirits, and traversed the hidden and the obscure—none could fathom their depths.

At the age of one hundred and twenty-odd years, in the twelfth year of King Yi’s reign (the *jihai* year), the Supreme Clarity Princess dispatched immortal officials to descend and welcome him, bestowing upon him scriptures and appointing him as the Perfected of the Great Ultimate, thereafter serving as the Immortal King of Mount Wangwu.

*The Record of the Primal Chaos* states: "At the age of one hundred and □-odd years, in the nineteenth year of King Mu’s reign (the *jihai* year), the Lord Lao sent the Supreme Clarity Princess to descend and welcome him, conferring scriptures." Upon examining the biographical records, it is clear that *The Record*’s account is in error.

Your servant Daoyi remarks: Du Chong delved into the mysteries of the Dao and held wealth and nobility in light esteem. Thus, the Son of Heaven honored him without subjecting him to servitude, and the feudal lords revered him without bestowing rank. As the *Dao De Jing* says: "The Dao is eternally nameless. Though its simplicity be small, none in the world dare claim dominion over it. If lords and kings could but hold to it, the myriad things would of themselves submit." Was not Du Chong one who took this Dao as his own burden, thereby guiding kings and lords to return to the Dao?

Peng Zong, the Perfected of Great Clarity, styled Faxian, was a native of Pengcheng. At the age of twenty, he became a disciple of the Perfected Du Chong, receiving profound favor and instruction. King Mu of Zhou revered the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, yearning for divine transcendence. Upon visiting Chong, he accordingly restored and adorned a hall of treasures, erecting a sacred altar and establishing a temple with statues of Lord Lao and the Perfected Yin. He widely summoned scholars of the Dao from across the land to propagate the immortal teachings. He further instituted offices to oversee the temple, ensuring its seasonal maintenance and adornment. Later, Peng Zong journeyed west to Kunlun Mountain, where he again paid homage to the Queen Mother before departing.

Peng Zong then dwelled in the truth, savoring the Dao, his essence penetrating both man and spirit. Once, while gathering herbs with his master, he suddenly fell into a deep ravine, injuring his hands and feet, leaving him in dire straits. After a long while, he revived, his reverence undiminished. Another time, while gathering firewood in the mountains, he was bitten by a snake, yet showed no sign of anger. Moved by his resolve, Du Chong established an altar and swore oaths over the *Elixir Canon*, the *Five Thousand Character Text*, and the Dao of Mysterious Unity. Peng Zong treasured and cultivated these teachings, daily delving into their profound mysteries.

At times, during the night, several divine lamps would float in the air, illuminating his mat, their radiance lingering and suffusing the darkness with clarity. When he rose at dawn to practice, the atmosphere would grow lofty and luminous, often with five-colored clouds and mist swirling around him. He could merge three days and nights into a single breath. At other times, he would submerge himself in water for an entire day before emerging. If he closed his eyes and lay still, he might remain motionless for over a year, dust accumulating upon him like layers of paper. Observers would suspect him dead, but when he rose, his complexion appeared even more radiant. He could recite the *Five Thousand Character Text* in a single breath, completing it twice, his voice clear and resonant, no different from that of an ordinary man.

In the mountains, venomous snakes and fierce tigers would cower at his qi, lurking in secluded dens. Though people might brush against them, the beasts would not stir until Peng Zong released them. Once, a hunter slandered him from afar, and when the man approached his door intending to humiliate him, Peng Zong restrained him with his qi. The hunter’s limbs involuntarily stiffened, leaving him standing rigid as a corpse. At other times, Peng Zong would send spirits to strike near the man’s door, eliciting only the sound of kowtowing, the cause unseen. Only after the man repented would Peng Zong release him.

At over one hundred and fifty years of age, he retained the vigor of a twenty-year-old. In the thirteenth year of King Li’s reign, the year *bingshen* of the first month, the Supreme Dao Lord dispatched immortals to welcome him, bestowing upon him the title of Perfected of Great Clarity and appointing him to govern the Red City Palace.

Song Lun, the Perfected of Great Clarity, styled Dexuan, was a native of Luoyang (also said to be from Luoyuan). In the twenty-first year of King Li’s reign, the year *jiachen*, he entered the Dao and took residence at Louguan. There, he concentrated his mind, stilled his spirit, embraced unity, and harmonized his qi, withdrawing from worldly affairs to wander the emptiness alone. Daily, he recited the *Five Thousand Character Text* several times and consumed yellow essence and white wood. After over twenty years of practice, he secretly beheld Lord Lao, whose neck bore a radiant halo and whose face emitted golden light. Clad in a nine-colored robe of parted mist and crowned with a seven-rayed dawn coronet, he was attended by six immortal youths who assisted and recorded his words.

Prostrating himself in grief, Song Lun pleaded, whereupon Lord Lao declared: *"I possess the Dao of the Radiant Center and the Scripture of Communing with the True, born at the inception of the Three Origins, issuing from the Court of the Nine Mysteries. The Five Virtues converge in celebration, the Six Qi congeal in essence, dispersing the true and scattering the radiant to preserve distant longevity. If you cultivate this, you will swiftly ascend in cloud chariots, moving between being and non-being, penetrating the obscure and illuminating the dark. The Three Luminaries will shine together, the Two Qi will purify the spirit, transformations will follow your will, and you will ascend to the Highest Clarity."*

Song Lun pressed his five limbs to the earth, weeping bitterly. Lord Lao calmed him and revealed a treasure, presenting him with the *Numinous Flight of the Six Jia and the Plain Memorial of the Elixir Talismans*. He further instructed: *"If you diligently cultivate the Supreme Dao, savor the true and contemplate the mysterious, practice without interruption, and persevere in refinement, you will ascend and traverse the void on cloud chariots. Reverence brings blessings; negligence invites calamity. The Dao aligns with those who practice it—guard this well and do not transmit it lightly."*

After receiving the scripture and cultivating it, Song Lun naturally attained spiritual resonance. Six jade lads took turns attending him. He could foresee events before they arose, discerning fortune and misfortune with divine clarity, his words invariably proving true. At times, he would rest among the inner immortals of the Five Emperors, where divine transcendents would invite him to wander and feast in the mountains and forests. Light as a feather, he could traverse three thousand *li* in a day, crossing waves and scaling perilous paths as if treading level ground. Occasionally, he would roam the marshes to test men’s hearts, transforming into birds or beasts to tame those around him.

At times, he became a deer, pursued by hunters who could never close the distance of a hundred or fifty paces, nor could the most skilled archers strike him. At others, he took the form of a wagtail, soaring over plains and hills, eluding the nets of fowlers. Or he might appear as a leper, offering expedient teachings to awaken those deluded by duality, instantly curing the afflicted.

At over ninety years of age, in the thirty-second year of King Xuan’s reign, the year *dingsi* of the seventh month, the Supreme Lord dispatched immortals to welcome him, bestowing the title of Perfected of Great Clarity and appointing him to oversee the divine transcendents’ register of Mount Song, the Central Peak.

Feng Chang, the Perfected of the Western Peak, styled Yanshou, was a native of Lishan. At fifteen, he mastered books on yin-yang and divination. King Xuan of Zhou, having heard of him, appointed him as an archivist. Feng Chang inwardly cultivated clarity while outwardly blending with the world, fearing entanglement in the rise and fall of fortunes. Observing the disorder in celestial patterns, he feared calamity would befall him. Thus, he retired on the pretext of illness, concealing his light and withdrawing into seclusion.

He discarded wealth and severed worldly ties, savoring the Dao and nurturing life while refining his spirit and preserving his qi. Daily, he recited the *Five Thousand Character Text* and consumed asparagus root. After five or six years, he gradually perceived its benefits. With unwavering diligence, he vowed to extend his heavenly allotment.

Thus, he was moved by the True Man Deng, who bestowed upon him the *Numinous Writ of Purple Text* and the Dao of Treasuring the Spirit. Chang then harnessed the dawn’s light to ascend, riding qi and roaming the primordial. At the sacred peaks of Zhongnan, he planted cliffs and bridged distances, summoning the radiance of the celestial luminaries. He refined his po-soul and softened his hun-soul, reversing yellow to red until his face gleamed with jade-like luster. After more than a decade, his vital essence flourished in luxuriant abundance. Naturally, azure essence congealed into liquid, purple clouds gathered into springs, all hundred vessels thrived, and the Three Passes flowed with moisture.

Later, he encountered the True Man Peng Zong, who rode a white tiger and descended into his chamber with two attendants. Chang performed the rites of a disciple, standing humbly to the side, restraining his breath and stilling his qi as he sought the essentials of the Dao. The True Man said: "Your virtuous resonance is profound and wondrous, your spirit and qi distant and pure. The Dao must return to the real; you are destined to transcend the world. If you wish to soar like a roc on the cloud-path, your jade-like brilliance resplendent, you must cultivate with unyielding diligence and never retreat. Then, you shall surely be summoned." Thereupon, he produced the *Hidden Writ of the Most High* and conferred it upon Chang.

Chang further annotated the *Eight Numinous Scenes*, savored the *Mysterious Nine Origins*, lodged his radiance in the streaming clouds, and guarded the Great Vastness in profound stillness. Thereafter, he roamed the primordial yang, observing the safety and peril of all things. Whenever he encountered illness, none failed to receive his protection. Once, a madman raged, and he cured him—some recovered in ten days, others in five. A leper pleaded for mercy, and within a month, he was healed. When a fire broke out, rafters and beams ignited in succession, wind and flames raging uncontrollably, none could extinguish it. Chang directed his intention toward it, and the raging fire stilled of its own accord.

At over eighty years of age, in the twentieth year of King Ping’s reign (the *gengyin* year), in the third month of spring, he ascended and transformed. At that time, the Heavenly Thearch dispatched immortals to descend and welcome him, appointing him as the True Man of the Western Peak. He ascended to the Upper Clarity, entering and exiting the realm of non-action.

Yao Tan
The True Man of the Dark Continent, Yao Tan, styled Yuantai, was a native of Pingyang. In the first year of King Ping of Zhou, when the court relocated to Luoyang, Duke Xiang of Jin, who had rendered meritorious service in escorting the Zhou, was enfeoffed as a feudal lord. The royal decree commanded the presentation of ritual gifts at the ancestral temple, the restoration of the abbey and shrine, and the allocation of five households and seventeen erudite scholars. At the time, Tan was nineteen years old. Due to his mastery of antiquity, he was singled out for special favor and reception. Duke Xiang knelt, bowed his head to the ground, and faced north to address him as his teacher. He partook of the wind and savored the Dao, and this continued for many years. Tan’s precision was so exacting that he seemed like a divine being, and all beneath the heavens revered and submitted to him.

His son, Duke Wen, also cultivated reverence and admiration for him. Once, during a four-year eastern journey that passed through the Wei River, he personally visited to offer congratulations and provide medicinal supplies. Tan, finding the world’s tumult oppressive, retreated to secluded cliffs. He constantly recited the *Five Thousand Character Text*, his concentrated thought never wavering. Suddenly, a crevice in the rock face split open, snapping trees as if descending from heaven, striking directly above his head. Sand and stones flew in countless numbers, yet Tan remained unmoved, his gaze fixed and unyielding. Soon after, a horde of great serpents emerged, converging upon his dwelling. Their mouths gaped and eyes stared, as if about to devour him. Some coiled around his body, yet Tan remained unafraid.

Then, the mountain spirit led a host of ghosts, bearing a colossal boulder towering like a peak. Driven by wind and lightning, it pressed ever closer, threatening to crush him. Tan slowly opened his eyes and rebuked them: "What petty fiends are you, daring to act so lawlessly? I have long cultivated true fruit, my sincere heart like jade. Your demonic delusions cannot obstruct my true path." Thereupon, he concentrated his mind and advanced single-mindedly. In an instant, the apparitions vanished.

Three figures of imposing stature then appeared and said to Tan: "We are the rightful spirits of this mountain. The Heavenly Thearch commanded us to test you, and now the trial is complete." With these words, they departed. Thereafter, Tan refined pine resin. Over decades, azure-clad youths often played in his bedchamber. Gradually, his room grew luminous, and all objects within became visible.

Later, the transcendent Lord Xu descended in secret and conferred upon him the *Dao of the Mysterious White Returning Form* and the *Scripture of the Three Celestial Passes for Flying Transcendence*. Tan cultivated his mind and mastered himself, attaining wondrous spiritual resonance. Within, his steps left no trace on his robes; treading through mud and mire, his shoes remained unstained. His eyes emitted divine radiance, flashing like lightning. He usually walked with his eyes closed. When disciples entreated him, he would open them slightly, and a swift, dazzling light would stream forth, startling all who saw it, leaving them unable to compose themselves. When he closed his eyes, the light ceased.

At over two hundred and ten years of age, in the eleventh year of King Jian’s reign (the *bingxu* year), in the fifth month of summer, a sudden storm darkened the sky, thunder roaring and crashing. None dared venture outside. As the thunder gradually subsided, disciples emerged to find silver flowers raining from the heavens, scattering in profusion upon the earth. After a long while, they dissolved. That day, the Primordial Lady of the Great Simplicity dispatched immortals to descend and welcome him, appointing him as the True Man of the Dark Continent. He ascended in blossoms at the White Water Palace.

Zhou Liang
The Eightfold Simplicity True Man, Zhou Liang, styled Taiyi, was a native of Taiyuan. His mother once dreamed of five-colored streaming clouds veiling her home, and thus conceived. After fifteen months, she gave birth. At nineteen, he stood eight *chi* tall, bearing the dignified air of the ancients. Free-spirited and aloof, he took no delight in glory or emolument. He was especially versed in the *Book of Changes*, the philosophers, and the histories. Though he dwelt amid worldly discourse, his aspirations were fixed upon the true and ultimate.

He became a disciple of Yao Tan, who transmitted to him the *Five Thousand Character Text* and the *Eightfold Simplicity True Scripture*. Liang cultivated these teachings and attained profound resonance. When households were troubled by ghosts and spirits shaking their dwellings, transforming water into blood, or harming people and livestock, Liang would recite the *Five Thousand Character Text* and perform hidden incantations, and the malevolent calamities would naturally dissipate. When foxes, turtles, or serpents bewitched people, defiled their food and drink, or stole their possessions, hurling tiles and pebbles in mischief—none could be expelled—Liang would recite scriptures and hold incantations, and the demonic beings would revert to their true forms, some dying at his side.

Prince Jin of King Ling of Zhou, having heard of him, summoned him for an audience. They played the zither and flute together, traveling through Shang and Luo. Liang then plucked the solitary strings of the *wuxian*, harmonizing the eight sounds until a hundred birds danced in unison. The prince admired him and bestowed upon him the *Nine Radiant Seven Luminous Mushrooms* and the *Dao of the Flying Goblet and Liberating Net*.

Liang cultivated the Dao and ingested the sacred mushrooms, daily perceiving their numinous efficacy. The Emperor secretly roamed the treasure caves with immortals, embracing and sipping jade wine, playing the zither, and playing chess, whistling and singing all day. At times, when he appeared seventy years old, his hair white and teeth fallen, after one or two nights in seclusion, he would transform into a youth, his countenance even more radiant. If seized by malevolent men who mocked him with filth, he would instantly vanish, leaving them unaware that they had bound and tormented themselves. Those who hurled abusive words at him would find their mouths spontaneously bleeding, and only after repenting and seeking forgiveness for a full day would they be released. At the age of over one hundred and ninety, in the twenty-fourth year of King Weilie’s reign, the year *jimao*, the Heavenly Emperor dispatched celestial officials to descend and welcome him, bestowing upon him the scriptures and appointing him as the Perfected One of the Qin-Long Palace. He came and went in the Great Clarity, feasting and wandering through the heavens.

Yin Cheng, the Perfected One of the Grand Tenuity, styled himself Chumo, and hailed from Fenyang. At twenty-eight, in the third year of King An’s reign, the winter of the year *renwu*, the tenth month, he lodged at Louguan to cultivate wisdom and refine his spirit, dwelling in emptiness and vastness. He purified himself with fasting, chanted scriptures, and kept apart from worldly affairs. His garments were like a belt of rope, and his food barely sufficed. He often purchased incense and arranged it upon the altar.

At first, when the incense in his casket was exhausted, suddenly divine fragrances filled the censer and burned—all were rare and precious scents. Once, when his lamp failed to cast light, a radiant glow naturally illuminated the space from the void. These were all manifestations of his refined essence moving the spirits, who aided him with divine favor.

While traveling in the mountains, he encountered a deer with an injured leg, struggling and unable to proceed. Moved by its suffering, Cheng applied medicine to its wound. Later, when he entered the mountains again, he was suddenly caught in a torrential downpour. With no food and only thin garments, he was stranded in the thickets. Just then, a herd of deer approached, gathering around him. When hungry, he drank their milk; when weary, he rested in their embrace. They accompanied him for days without returning.

He once lodged in a small cave atop a sheer cliff. One night, a mountain fire erupted, filling the valley with flames and smoke. With no escape, a troop of apes linked their arms and lowered him down, carrying him to safety beyond the peril. This, too, was the protection of the divine.

When Emperor Qin Shi Huang heard of him, he repeatedly issued edicts to summon him, seeking the arts of nurturing life. In the thirtieth year of his reign, when Mao Meng of Mount Hua ascended to heaven in broad daylight, a ballad spread. Upon hearing this, the emperor’s belief in immortals deepened, and he dispatched envoys bearing gold and silk to express his sincerity.

At the time, Cheng wished to journey to Penglai and Yingzhou, so the emperor ordered the statue of the Old Lord turned eastward. A separate temple was built south of the Perfected One’s shrine to house it, with fourteen Daoist priests appointed and thirty *qing* of incense fields granted, along with a hundred households for support. The edict read: *"The Great Dao flows boundlessly, ever near to left or right. Though the Old Lord wanders west, he turns his gaze eastward. As I seek to build Penglai and Yingzhou, may his influence linger like an echo."*

Emperors Gaozu, Empress Lü, Emperor Hui, Emperor Jing, and Empress Dowager Dou of the Han dynasty all inherited this devotion to the sacred realm. They frequently summoned recluses and transcendent scholars, keeping fourteen or sixteen in attendance at all times, each granted a disciple. The temple’s households were increased to one hundred fifty, with enhanced provisions for its upkeep and protection. Offerings and prayers never ceased, and the people’s reverence grew like gathering clouds.

Cheng, however, found the commotion disruptive. He secretly told his disciples: *"My immortal arts remain unfinished, and my virtue is tied to this fate. I must make the mountains and forests my home, living as a hermit of the wilds."* Thus, he changed his name to *Lin* ("Forest"). Wandering the valleys and peaks, he fled into secluded ravines, eating cypress leaves and sipping from streams. He traversed perilous paths and crumbling cliffs, enduring hardships in the wilderness. His form grew gaunt, yet he sought hidden masters, braving every trial. Though the roads were rugged and endless, he pressed onward without hesitation.

On Mount Taiyi, he encountered a stone bearing *zhi* mushrooms, glowing against the green cliffs. Gazing at it by night, he saw a radiant light and gathered them to consume. After seven days, he could travel six or seven hundred *li* in a day.

Later, in the mountains of Emei, he met the immortal Song Jun, who bestowed upon him the *Inner Writings of the Three Sovereigns* and the secret formulas of the Nine Elixirs. Cheng cultivated these arts with great efficacy, gaining the power to seal mountains and command peaks, to heal the sick and protect the living. Once, he cast a talisman into the water, and the current reversed for several paces before the surging waves abruptly stilled. With his medicines, he revived those who had died suddenly.

For years, malevolent spirits and ghosts plagued the land. When he subdued them, they bound themselves and came forth, some begging for mercy, others slain or released at his command. Once, a violent wind threatened to destroy homes and forests. He restrained it, and while the storm raged elsewhere, his dwelling alone was spared.

Another time, he encountered a landslide with trees crashing into the ravine. He sealed it with a talisman, and the disaster halted at his touch.

At over three hundred forty years of age, in the first year of Emperor Zhao’s reign, the sixth month of the year *yiwei*, the Lord of the Grand Tenuity dispatched celestial officials to descend and welcome him. Bestowing upon him the scriptures, he was appointed the Perfected One of the Grand Tenuity and ascended to wander the Nine Heavens.

Wang Tan, the Perfected One of the Yellow Court, styled himself Yangbo and hailed from Taiyuan. His appearance was striking, his bearing radiant as clouds and rosy dawn. He mastered the primordial currents and delved deeply into the roots of the Dao.

During the Han dynasty, he served as a Palace Attendant and Gentleman of the Interior. When Empress Lü usurped power, Tan withdrew to the southern mountains and dwelled at Louguan. There, he devoted himself to refining his essence through the *Morning Audience* and the arts of exhaling the old and inhaling the new.

When Emperor Wen ascended the throne, he revered Tan’s reputation and honored him as a man of leisure, though Tan was only thirty-six at the time. He often recited the *Five Thousand Character Scripture*, understanding that fame was fleeting while virtue was the foundation of the Dao. Thus, he widely practiced charity, ever mindful of the common people.

An immortal named Master Zhao disguised himself as a madman, his appearance disheveled. He begged from Tan without cease, yet Tan gave unstintingly, never doubting or questioning. Zhao secretly told him: *"I was testing you—you are worthy of instruction."* He then transmitted the *Inner Cultivation of the Yellow Court* and the formula for the *Alisma Elixir*. After months of practice, Tan’s spirit underwent a sudden transformation.

He entered the southern mountains to gather herbs and later returned to Louguan. There, he encountered the Jade Maiden of the Grand Primordium, Xiling Zidu, who taught him the *Way of Concealing the Radiance and Recording the Form*. He could then transform his body and alter his appearance in myriad ways—standing amidst groves, sitting by springs and stones, or shifting into water, fire, birds, or beasts. Yet his true form, following the *Fu of Yu*, remained unchanged.

He also studied under Sima Jizhu, mastering the *Boundless Arts of Spiritual Transformation*. Often walking with others, he would suddenly disperse his body into mist or stand upon level ground and become a towering peak. Onlookers trembled in awe, yet his original form remained serene in its place.

At the age of ninety-one, in the sixth year of Emperor Wu of Han’s *Yuanshuo* reign (the year *wuwu*, first month), the Golden Mother of the Western Numinosity dispatched immortal envoys to descend and welcome him. They conferred upon him the scriptures and named him Perfected of the Grand Ultimate, governing the Palace of Great Possession.

Li Yi, Immortal Minister of the Western Marchmount, studied under the Perfected Wang Tan and ascended as an immortal through the Dao.

He transmitted the Dao to the Elder of the River’s Bank, bestowing upon him the *Five Thousand Characters of the Dao and Virtue*, delving deeply into the mysteries of the Valley Spirit and the Dark Female. He also encountered extraordinary figures who imparted to him the *Book of Changes*, granting him penetrating insight into the workings of heaven, earth, yin, yang, and the transformations of creation. Thus, he traced hidden tracks and probed profound depths, aligning his virtue with heaven and earth, and his fortunes with spirits and gods. Through this, he could dwell in stillness like a corpse yet manifest like a dragon, remain as silent as the abyss yet resound like thunder, and stir the numinous to which heaven itself responded. He ascended into the heavens, roamed the mists, and traversed the boundless. Once his merit was complete and his Dao perfected, his dark virtue ascended to be heard, and the Heavenly Emperor conferred upon him the scriptures, appointing him Immortal Minister of the Western Marchmount.

*Comprehensive Mirror of Perfected Immortals Who Embodied the Dao Through the Ages*, Scroll Nine—concluded.
*Comprehensive Mirror of Perfected Immortals Who Embodied the Dao Through the Ages*, Scroll Ten.

Li Eight-Hundred, a native of Shu, whose given name remains unknown. Initially, he came to divine his dwelling at Five Dragons Ridge in Junyang, also called Red Ridge Stronghold—now the seat of Gao’an Prefecture—where the Quenching Sword Pool and Seven Stars Well still stand. Through the Xia, Shang, and Zhou dynasties, he lived eight hundred years, and when he moved, he could travel eight hundred li in a day; thus, the people of his time called him Li Eight-Hundred. At times he concealed himself in mountain forests, at others he dwelt amid the dust of markets.

Later, he cultivated his practice in a stone chamber on Mount Hualin. When his elixir was perfected and his Dao complete, he returned to Shu. By the Qin era, learning that Tang Gongfang possessed aspiration but had not encountered an enlightened master, he wished to instruct him. First, he went to test him, serving Gongfang as a hired laborer. Gongfang, unaware that he was an immortal, drove Eight-Hundred to work harder than the others, yet held him in great affection.

Later, Eight-Hundred feigned illness, growing weak as if near death. Gongfang summoned physicians and compounded medicines, spending tens of thousands of coins without regret, his concern for Eight-Hundred evident in his countenance. Then Eight-Hundred developed malignant sores covering his body, festering and foul, so noxious that none could approach. Gongfang wept and said: "You have toiled diligently for my household for years, only to fall gravely ill. I am most eager for your recovery and would spare nothing—yet now, what can be done?"

Eight-Hundred replied: "My sores may be cured, but they must be licked." Gongfang ordered three maidservants to lick them, but Eight-Hundred said: "The maids’ licking cannot heal me; if you yourself were to lick them, I should recover." Gongfang immediately did so. Eight-Hundred then said: "Even your licking cannot heal me; if your wife were to lick them, I would be cured." Gongfang then had his wife lick them.

Eight-Hundred declared: "My sores are healed. I now require thirty *hu* of fine wine for bathing, and then I shall be fully restored." Gongfang promptly prepared thirty *hu* of wine and filled a vessel with it. After bathing in the wine, Eight-Hundred’s sores vanished, his body smooth as congealed lard, without a trace of scarring. He then revealed to Gongfang: "I am an immortal. Because you possess a sincere heart, I came to test you. You are certainly fit to be taught. Now I shall truly transmit to you the secrets of transcending the world."

He had Gongfang, his wife, and the three maidservants who had licked his sores bathe in the leftover wine, whereupon they all grew youthful, their complexions fair and radiant. He bestowed upon Gongfang a scroll of elixir scriptures and entered Cloud Terrace Mountain to compound the elixir. When the elixir was complete, he consumed it and ascended as an immortal.

One tradition records Gongfang as Gong Fang, also called Tang Gongfang, a native of Xingyuan Prefecture, who drank the immortal wine of Li Eight-Hundred and later ascended with his entire household. Today, Dou Mountain Abbey stands as his legacy. The *Veritable Records of the Primordial Origin* state: Li Tuo studied the Dao of longevity and, during the reign of King Mu of Zhou, came to dwell beneath Dragon Bridge Peak on Mount Jintang in Shu. There he compounded the Nine-Flowered Elixir, and upon its completion, traveled among the Five Marchmounts, the Ten Grotto-Heavens, and over two hundred other sites for more than two hundred years. On the sea, he encountered the Flying Yang Lord, who transmitted to him the Dao of Water and Jade. Returning to this mountain, he refined the elixir to perfection, then departed for several hundred years more. Sometimes hidden, sometimes visible, he wandered through markets and courts.

Later, he returned beneath Dragon Bridge Peak, where he refined the Golden Tripod Returning Elixir. When the elixir was complete, he had already lived eight hundred years. The people of Shu saw him through successive generations, hence the name Li Eight-Hundred. As he studied the Dao thrice upon this mountain, later generations called it Three Studies Mountain—also known as Mount Xixian—now under the jurisdiction of Huaian Prefecture.

The *Illustrated Classic of Immortal Abodes in the Nine Regions* states that Li Eight-Hundred ascended from this place. The *Veritable Records of Mount Hualin* record that Li Eight-Hundred ascended in broad daylight at Three Studies Mountain in Jintang County, Hanzhou. His stone chamber lies a hundred paces west of Floating Cloud Abbey, beneath the central peak, measuring one *zhang* in both width and height, and is called the Eight-Hundred Grotto-Heaven. To the southeast is another grotto entrance, just large enough for a person to enter. After several *zhang*, the passage gradually widens and rises, its depths unfathomable.

During the early Kaiyuan era of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang, Celestial Master Sun received the esoteric formulas of Celestial Master Zhang and concealed them within this grotto, which people thereafter called the Grotto of Celestial Master Sun. In the Huichang era of Emperor Wuzong, a local man named Gong entered the grotto and obtained a scroll of the Six Ding Rain-Praying Formula. Whenever drought struck, his prayers were instantly answered. In the fifth year of the Xiantong era of Emperor Yizong, the Gao’an Daoist Zhu Yuanzheng entered the grotto and retrieved two scrolls of scripture from a stone casket, bearing the inscription: *The True Wind Reveals the Nature of Color*. Yuanzheng pondered: “Nature is surname; the nature of color must refer to the Zhu clan.” He then returned to Gao’an to propagate the teachings, which flourished in his time. Many have entered this grotto before and after, each encountering different circumstances, though those of impure or defiled disposition invariably meet with obstacles. Truly, the abodes of immortals and transcendents do not suffer those without the bone of the Dao to rashly intrude or pry.

Floating Cloud Abbey was later renamed Floating Cloud Mountain Abbey of Saintly Longevity and Myriad Years during the Song, and placed under the jurisdiction of Fengxin County, Longxing Prefecture.

**Master Kuang Fu of Mount Kuang**
Master Kuang Fu, whose given name was Xu and courtesy name Junping—also called Zixiao or Junji—was a native of Southern Chu. Some say he descended from the lineage of Great Yu. Endowed with divine intelligence from birth, he harbored aspirations beyond the mundane even in childhood. During the reign of King Wu of Zhou, he studied under Lao Cong, the Archivist Beneath the Pillars, and attained the Dao of longevity. He then built a thatched hut above Tiger Brook on the southern slope of Mount Nanfu and lived in seclusion.

Within his chamber, there was nothing—only a single couch and a few bundles of bamboo slips. When King Wu heard of his reputation, he repeatedly summoned and invited him, but the Master never rose to answer. After many years had passed, several youths came to visit him. One introduced himself, saying: "My surname is Liu, my given name Yue. My home lies to the left of the mountain ahead. I invite you, Master, to visit." He added: "At the foot of the mountain, there is a stone about two feet high—that is my dwelling." Later, the Master went as promised. When he reached the foot of the mountain, he looked around but saw no dwelling—only the stone. He knocked upon it, and the stone opened like double doors. Two attendants in blue, bearing crimson tally-staffs, led the way before him. Gradually, he beheld towers and terraces rising in tiers, their gold and jade radiance shimmering, birds soaring, and rare flowers and trees. The youth, wearing a crown of dark jade and girded with a vermilion sash and sword, ascended the hall to receive him. The Master realized this was no mortal realm and wished to remain. The youth said to him: "Your hidden merits are not yet complete; a later meeting may be expected." He then offered the Master three cups of jade wine, followed by a sip of the *Elixir of Longevity and Life-Preservation*. The Master took his leave and departed. When he turned to look back, only the great stone remained as before.

After this encounter, the Master’s spirit and countenance grew ever more luminous, and he never ceased his cultivation. King Ding once asked the Archivist Boyang Fu who among the immortals still dwelled in the world. Boyang Fu listed the immortals of the Five Peaks, and the Master was among them. The King then summoned him, but the Master delayed and did not appear. By the time of King Weilie, envoys were again sent with a comfortable carriage to invite him. Before they arrived, the Master said: "The time has come." He then ascended into the sky in broad daylight. When the envoys sought his place of seclusion, only an empty thatched hut remained. Upon their return, they memorialized the throne, requesting that Nanfu Mountain be renamed Jinglu Mountain. The people of the region also called it by the Master’s surname—Kuang Mountain, or Kuangfu, or Kuanglu. Later, to avoid the taboo of the Song founding emperor’s name, *Kuang* was changed to *Kang*. To this day, villages and altars in the area are named after him, and Tiger Brook became one of the Thirty-Six Blessed Lands.

According to the *True Record of the Primordial Origin*, citing the *Erya* and *Explanation of Names*: "A mound of earth is called *fu*." This mountain was originally named Nanfu, meaning "earth bearing the three celestial spears." In ancient times, Mount Qian was worshipped as the Southern Peak, and Nanfu served as its auxiliary, hence it was also called the Southern Peak. After the Master’s ascension, the Celestial Emperor commanded him to oversee the droughts and floods of the Huai and Chu regions and bestowed upon him the Seal of the Lord of Warmth, placing him in charge of the eight divisions of warmth spirits. Thus, he was popularly styled *Master of Harmonious Warmth and Prosperous Mound*.

The Master had two eminent disciples: one was the Perfected of the White Deer, the other the Perfected Hongzi. Today, on Mount Lu, the *Hong Well of Elixir-Refining* and the *White Deer Grotto* remain as their legacy. In the first year of the *Yuanfeng* era of Emperor Wu of Han, during his southern inspection tour, he ascended the Heavenly Pillar and offered sacrifices. Later, he shot a dragon in the Xunyang River. Turning to his attendants, he asked which spirit presided over this mountain. The scholar Liu Gu replied: "Master Kuang Xu attained the Dao here." The Emperor then enfeoffed him as the *Duke of Great Brilliance of the Southern Pole* and ordered a shrine built at his former seclusion by Tiger Brook, including it in the official sacrifices.

By the Eastern Jin, the monk Huiyuan of Yanmen, returning from Mount Luofu, spent the night at the shrine. Enamored of the beauty of the streams and mountains, he petitioned the prefect Huan Yi, saying: "Last night, I dreamed that Master Kuang wished to cede the shrine for a temple." Huan Yi consented, and thus the Eastern and Western Forests Monasteries were established, while the Master’s shrine was relocated to the northwest of the mountain’s entrance. During the *Kaiyuan* era of the Tang, the temple was further expanded. At the beginning of the *Tianbao* era, Emperor Ming commanded envoys to offer sacrifices, honoring it as an immortal sanctuary. When the local people suffered from floods, droughts, or epidemics, their prayers were always answered.

In the *Baoda* era of the Southern Tang, the chancellor Zhou Zong, serving as commissioner to the southern regions, arrived in Jiujiang. Seeing the shrine in disrepair, he ordered its restoration. He then summoned the Daoist Que Yuanyin to oversee it and ensure the continuity of incense offerings. He also memorialized the throne to grant a manor with lands, permanently endowing it for vegetarian feasts.

During the *Zhiping* era of Emperor Yingzong of the Song, the shrine was granted the plaque "Abbey" and bestowed the name *Shousheng*. When imperial sacrifices were conducted at the suburban altars, inscribed tablets were descended, and the prefectural deputy was dispatched to offer libations, establishing this as an enduring ritual. In the first year of the *Jianzhong Jingguo* era, Emperor Huizong issued a decree posthumously enfeoffing the Master as *Jingming Zhenren* ("True Person of Serene Illumination"). In the thirty-second year of the *Shaoxing* era of Emperor Gaozong, to avoid the honorific name of the *Deshou* Palace, the plaque was changed to *Guangfu* ("Vast Fortune").

Bai Yuchan of Qiongshan inscribed an ancient-style poem:
*King Wu laughed as he rode the azure jade steed,*
*Seizing the aged tyrant Zhou to dash him to pieces.*
*The four seas’ people all perished from plague,*
*While recluses in the woods willingly endured hunger.*
*One man wrote books beneath Mount Song,*
*Another gathered fern on Shouyang’s heights.*
*Eight demons spread pestilence to poison the young,*
*Eight-spoked wind-chariots blew fire-horses’ breath.*
*I have heard that Kang Xu hid in his serene hut,*
*Where the Old Man of the Azure Ox bestowed upon him a book.*
*The Purple Emperor granted him the Seal of Pestilence-Quelling,*
*And the world’s withered people gradually revived.*
*Yet when he heard of the ten rebellions in the human realm,*
*He steeled his will, ate asters, and drank from spring streams.*
*Neither King Ding nor King Lie could summon him forth,*
*Nor could the Qin king’s boats reach Xiaohan’s shores.*
*By the time the ruins of Wangyi were overgrown with moss,*
*The Central Plains’ deer had fled to the Han.*
*The Daoist-loving Son of Heaven swore oaths to the river dragon,*
*And thus enfeoffed the Master as Duke of Great Illumination.*
*A Jin monk loved the land and planted white lotuses,*
*Reporting his dream to the herdsman to build a Buddhist temple.*
*I suspect that Lao Cong once transformed into a dragon—*
*Could the Master’s intent not have been the same?*
*The waters of Tiger Creek coil with azure dragons,*
*The mountains of Tiger Creek scrape the azure heavens.*
*Later men mocked Ge Hong for his mistake:*
*Having reached Mount Lu, he still set foot elsewhere.*
*After Ge Hong’s departure, how many have come?*
*The cave is filled with white clouds, cold and desolate.*

Minister Dao Yi remarked: "Kang Xu, though repeatedly summoned by the Zhou king, refused to rise, honing his resolve in the Dao. He regarded the nobility of kings and marquises and the wealth of gold and jade as no more than dirt or grass. Ultimately, he perfected his merit and fulfilled his conduct, ascending in broad daylight. As the *Daodejing* states: *'Though one may offer a large jade ring followed by a team of four horses, it is not equal to sitting and advancing in this Dao.'* This was truly Kang Xu’s path. Among later Daoist adepts who spurned kings and lords, exalted their pursuits, and either ascended in flight or achieved liberation in death, there have been countless thousands—perhaps all tracing their origins to Kang Xu."

**Jade Master**
The Jade Master, surnamed Zhang and named Zhen, was a native of Nanjun. In his youth, he studied the various classics. When King You of Zhou summoned him, he refused to appear, sighing: "In this worldly life, one drifts ever farther from birth and ever nearer to death. Rather than coveting wealth and rank, it is better to nurture one’s nature. When life’s span ends and qi is exhausted, one dies—what use are titles like king or marquis, or mountains of gold and jade, when the body becomes ashes and dust? Only the immortals who transcend the world offer boundless existence." He then became a disciple of Sangzi, receiving all the classics in full. Later, he devised his own school of methods, composing over a hundred scrolls of Daoist texts. His arts centered on *wu kui* (the five astral emanations), and he mastered the subtleties of the Five Phases, expounding their mysteries to nurture life, cure illnesses, and dispel disasters and misfortunes.

He could summon whirlwinds to tear off roofs and snap trees, or conjure thunderstorms, clouds, and mists. He could transform grass, pebbles, and tiles into the six livestock or dragons and tigers, which would immediately come to life and move about. He could divide his form into hundreds or thousands of people. He could stride across rivers and seas; when he held water in his mouth and spat it out, it turned to pearls and jade, never reverting. At times, he would hold his breath until he could not be lifted, pushed, bent, or straightened, remaining thus for tens or even a hundred days before reviving. When traveling with disciples, he would mold clay into horses for each, instructing them to close their eyes. In an instant, the clay became great steeds, carrying them a thousand *li* in a day. He could exhale qi in five colors, rising hundreds of *zhang* high; if a flying bird passed by, he could point to it and it would fall to the ground. By casting talismans into deep pools, he could summon fish and turtles to shore.

He could also enable his disciples to see objects a thousand *li* away with a glance, though they could not sustain this for long. During *wu kui* rituals, he would fill a vessel with water, place two *kui* (astral markers) within, and blow upon it. A radiant red light would rise one or two *zhang* above the water. This water could cure all illnesses: those with internal ailments drank it, while external afflictions were washed with it, and all were instantly healed. Later, he entered Kongtong Mountain to compound the elixir and ascended to heaven in broad daylight.

**Luming**
The Master of Great Yang, surnamed Li and named Ming, was a close friend of the Jade Master from the same era. After the Jade Master had perfected his Daoist arts, Luming became his disciple, observing all the rites of a pupil without the slightest negligence. The Jade Master held him in particular affection; among his three thousand disciples, none could compare. However, Luming was fond of wine and often drunk, for which he was frequently reproached.

Though skilled in the arts of the Five Phases, his hair had turned grizzled with age, yet his flesh remained full, his complexion radiant, and even after three hundred years, his appearance showed no change. The Jade Master said to him: "You ought to cultivate the body and nurture the nature to serve as a model for all worthy disciples, yet you remain sunk in drunken stupor, neglecting your practice, failing to refine the great elixir. Even if you lived a thousand years, it would still not suffice to escape death—how much less so to die after merely a few hundred? Such conduct is beneath even the common and mediocre; how could it befit one who has attained understanding?" He replied: "As a latecomer to the Way, my nature is stubborn, and worldly habits have yet to be purged. Thus, I use wine to curb my own arrogance in this manner."

He composed *The Art of the Seven Jeweled Trees*, mastering the essentials of the Dao. Having ingested the elixir and attained immortality, he often remained in the world, and for five hundred years, his face retained the freshness of youth. His fondness for wine, however, left his temples and hair snowy white.

**Du Yu**
Du Yu was the lord of Shu. Once, when a great flood struck Shu, Yu and the people took refuge from the waters on Changping Mountain, located above the Weijiang River in Qingcheng, eighty *li* from the county seat, where they built ramparts and settled. Later, Bie Ling dredged the gorges and tamed the waters, allowing the people to return to dry land. Yu abdicated his throne to him and retired to the Western Mountains, where he attained the Dao and ascended to heaven. The descendants of Bie Ling ruled the land of Shu for twelve generations until the reign of Kaiming, when it was annexed by Qin and thus connected to the Central Kingdom.

**Li Bing**
Li Bing and Yang Mo were both adepts of the Dao from Shu who commanded ghosts and spirits, drove away clouds and dragons, and could accomplish anything. During the time of the Kaiming rulers, they wandered and rested in Shu, where they once assisted in governing the waters, bringing relief to the people of Shu. In the reign of King Xiaowen of Qin, Bing served as the governor of Shu Commandery and opened the rivers to irrigate ten thousand *qing* of fields. At the time, shamans claimed that each year the River Lord took a young girl as his bride. When Bing arrived at the river shrine to rebuke him, the spirit suddenly vanished. After a long while, two dark oxen appeared wrestling on the bank. Presently, Bing returned, drenched in sweat, and said to his officials: "I am utterly exhausted—can any of you assist me?" He pointed southward: "The one with the white at its waist is my transformed self." Soon after, he was again spent. The magistrate stabbed the ox facing north, and the River Lord perished. The river no longer brought disaster, nor did it demand brides.

Bing carved five stone rhinoceroses to suppress the waters: one at Qingcheng, two at Xipu, one at the bridge in Chengdu, and one at Wangzhong. He also set up three stone figures in the water beneath the White Sand Mound at the Jade Maiden’s Chamber north of the county, swearing an oath with the river spirit: "When the waters recede, they shall not fall below the feet; when they rise, they shall not reach the shoulders." To this day, the oath holds, and the stone figures remain on the left bank of the river. The people of Shu have worshipped Bing for generations. When Emperor Xuanzong of Tang fled to Shu, in recognition of Bing’s contributions to the people, he ordered the shrine to be adorned and posthumously bestowed upon him the titles of Minister of Works and Chancellor. He decreed that wherever floods threatened, villages should erect temples to Bing, and the waters would subside.

Yang Mo also possessed divine guardians and could subdue dragons and tigers. He likewise diverted water to irrigate fields at the side of Great Soapberry Hill, swearing an oath with the dragon.

**Lu Ban**
Lu Ban, a man of Dunhuang, was so skilled in craftsmanship that his works rivaled the creations of heaven and earth.

Lu Ban once resented the people of Wu for killing his father. At the south of Su City, he crafted a wooden immortal whose hand pointed toward the land of Wu, causing a great drought there for three years. Divination revealed: "This is Ban’s doing." The people of Wu offered sacrifices and made amends, whereupon Ban severed the wooden hand. That very month, heavy rains fell across Wu.

**Ma Chengzi**
Between the Zhou and Qin dynasties, the realm was in tumult—strong states encroached upon the weak, the many oppressed the few, and ceaseless campaigns left people no respite for peace. Ma Chengzi of Fufeng, witnessing this, sighed: "A lifespan of a hundred years, a body of six feet—yet none can preserve themselves. Such is the world entire. Since heaven has given me life, there must be a Way to prolong it. Why cast myself into death? I have heard that the Dao is the ancestor of the ten thousand things, the origin of life’s essence, the root of transformation, the foundation of heaven and earth, unchanging through the ages, abiding in stillness. How might I find an enlightened teacher to reveal the gate of cultivating the Dao?"

For years, this thought occupied him. He abandoned his home, sought masters, and pursued the Dao. Hearing that on the southern slopes of Mount Qi, beside the branching Wei River, lay Boyang Valley—a place where the Old Lord (Laozi) and Yin Xi had once traversed—and that there stood a terrace where the Old Lord had transmitted the supreme Dao to King Wen of Zhou, he set out to find it.

Arriving at Boyang Valley, he encountered a youth who asked Chengzi: "What do you seek by climbing this mountain?" Chengzi explained his quest for the Dao. The youth laughed: "I have served the Old Lord for twelve thousand years, yet I have not heard of the profound and subtle Great Cavern Dao. You, who have barely ventured beyond the narrow confines of this world, dare seek the Dao—is this not difficult?" Astonished by his words, Chengzi bowed deeply and pleaded: "The life of a morning mushroom is but a fleeting instant. Without a sage to prolong it, it will rot and crumble into dust. Once this body is lost, when shall I again hear the Dao? I beg you, sage, take pity and instruct me."

The youth replied: "I am but a servant of the Most High, young and ignorant, unversed in the great Dao. I cannot teach you. Yet your苦志 in the mountains and springs, your weariness and spiritual strain, your tireless devotion to the Dao—these are truly pitiable. Still, I have heard the Most High Old Lord once tell King Yudan of the Heaven of Abundant Joy: 'The Dao gives birth to the ten thousand things, and the things do not depart from the Dao. Those who attain the Dao live; those who lose it die. The Dao resides within the self, not in others.' Now you exhaust yourself traversing mountains and rivers, enduring hardships—this is indeed a sign of resolve, yet you remain far from the Dao."

Chengzi bowed again and asked: "If the Dao is within the self, by what gate may one cultivate it?" The youth then taught him the method of refining the primordial qi of the embryo.

Chengzi entered Shu and arrived at Hummingbird Mountain, where he secluded himself in a stone cave. There, a man over ten feet tall, clad in a deerskin robe of coarse hair, leaning on a staff, approached him and discoursed on the arts of reclusion. He said to Chengzi: "This mountain is home to a stone pigeon that cries once every three hundred years. When it cries, someone in this mountain attains the Dao and ascends to heaven. This bird has cried frequently of late—you shall ascend soon." He then transmitted the divine elixir, saying: "The Dao-qi of the Most High is the inner elixir; herbs are the outer elixir. Hidden merit is the inner elixir; minerals and metals are the outer elixir. You have refined the primordial qi of the embryo, taught by the Yellow Canopy Youth. The Yellow Canopy is the son of the Dark Heaven and Grand Yang, and with the Golden Flower Jade Maiden, he attends the Most High. Through countless kalpas, his countenance remains ever youthful. To have encountered such a teacher is no different from personally attending the Most High. Since the inner elixir is already complete, my outer elixir is but a trifle. The Most High taught this to the Lord of the Grand Tenuity, who transmitted it to the Later Sage Lord of Great Peace, who in turn passed the secret to me. On the Central Mystery Mountain, I gathered the essence of the eight winds and the five planets, employed the furnace of the sun and moon, harmonized the qi of heaven and earth, commanded the Three Origins, summoned the myriad spirits, and refined it for eighty-one years before the elixir was complete. Now I bestow it upon you. Consume it before the Nine Heavens, and you shall be appointed the Most High’s Grand Minister of the Supreme Ultimate and Attendant of the Nine Florets, entering to serve the Jade Dawn and ranking among the lofty perfected."

With these words, he departed on a cloud. Chengzi reverently received and consumed the elixir, then told his disciples: "The Dao-qi of this mountain is extraordinary. Those who achieve great merit and rank among the highest perfected in the Three Heavens often attain the Dao here—this is why the stone pigeon cries every three hundred years." Soon after, he ascended to heaven in broad daylight.

Later, Celestial Master Zhang Daoling also dwelled on this mountain. The Most High descended to him, bestowing the title of Great Dharma Master of the Three Heavens and appointing him to oversee the Bureau of the Grand Mystery. Indeed, this occurred over three hundred years later.

**King Kang of Chu**
King Kang of Chu’s given name is unknown; he was a descendant of King Huai.

King Kang was known for his virtuous conduct and won the people’s allegiance, so the nation enthroned him. When the First Emperor of Qin conquered the six states and divided the land into thirty-six commanderies, King Kang, pressed to extremity, fled to Mount Lu and took refuge in a deep valley to the southeast to evade disaster. There, he secretly prayed to the mountain spirit, hoping for unseen aid. At that time, General Wang Jian led his troops to the valley’s mouth, but seeing mists and dust swirling, thunderstorms raging, and ravines flooding—obscuring all paths—he grew fearful and withdrew his forces. Thus, King Kang escaped. From afar, he saw the retreating army hasten away. The place is now called Horse’s Arrival Ridge.

King Kang sighed and said: “In ancient times, Shun’s southern tour never ended; I have found refuge on Mount Lu, to grow old among its forests and springs—this is enough.” He ventured deeper into the valley and never emerged. After a long time, he encountered an extraordinary person and attained the Dao. Later, those who entered the mountain sometimes saw him. When they observed his unusual movements and questioned him, he would give them his hairpin or beard, or reveal his name. In the early Datong era of the Liang dynasty, a temple was built beside the site, which Emperor Wu named the Temple of King Kang.

Dai Shiyu praised him, saying: “Chen Shunyu of Mount Lu recorded that this was King Kang of Chu. According to the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, he died in the twenty-first year of Duke Xiang of Lu, when the lords of Chen, Xu, Zheng, and Lu sent their rulers’ envoys to attend his funeral beyond the western gate, and the ministers of the feudal lords all gathered at his tomb. At that time, Chu was strong, yet three hundred twenty-six years later, Qin rose and destroyed it. How could King Kang still exist? Yet it is not unknown that before the Zhou, there was King Ding Yu, and after, King Ding Jie; before Lu, there was Duke Wen Xing, and after, Duke Wen Jia. Thus, the Zhou had two King Dings, and Lu had two Duke Wens. By this logic, there could indeed have been another King Kang after King Kang Zhao—it is no wonder, merely an omission in the Grand Historian’s records. Many renowned figures of Mount Lu do not appear in the standard histories but emerge only in miscellaneous accounts.”

The Three Generals of Tang and Qin:
One was named Jianwei, of the Tang clan;
Another was named Deshou, of the Li clan.

One was named Yundiao, of the Song clan—none knew their origins. During the reign of the First Emperor, the three were all warriors who had rendered great service to the state and held lofty ranks and titles. Later, seeing the governance of Qin grow increasingly disordered, they conferred among themselves: “The tide of the times has turned; heroes shall rise. Now petty men fill the court, upright words go unheeded, the Kingly Way is in disarray, and governance is perverse. If we do not act soon, we shall be but fish and meat for others.” At that time, ten renowned officials—all upright gentlemen—also departed in succession. Thus, the thirteen men all abandoned their posts to cultivate the Dao, seeking famous mountains and entering mist-laden groves, like deer escaping the hunting grounds, with no thought of return.

They passed along the southern slopes of Mount Lu and came to the foot of Purple Cloud Peak, where they admired the beauty of the mountains and waters. The three warriors wished to settle there, but the ten others said: “Not so. Our original intent was to return to the Cavern of Assembled Jade—how can we abandon our path midway?” Before they could set out, one night a thunderstorm suddenly descended, and torrents surged forth. At daybreak, they saw that their dwellings had transformed on either side into two streams, and upon a boulder in the midst of the waters lay a jade slip inscribed in celestial script: *“By divine transformation, the Spirit Stream arises; the golden tablet marks where true adepts dwell in the hidden Jade Cavern.”* The ten men vanished without a trace, while the three warriors took up residence beside the stream, planting peach trees and gathering lingzhi to sustain their cultivation.

Jianwei said: “We should bestow alms upon the poor.”
Deshou said: “We should heal the sick with medicine.”
Yundiao said: “We should speak to dispel delusion.”
Though their methods differed, their merit was the same, and those near and far reaped their blessings. In time, only auspicious clouds drifted through the sky and a pair of cranes danced in flight—from then on, the three attained the Dao and ascended as immortals.

Later generations named their dwelling the Cave of the Three Generals and established a shrine there. In the reign of Emperor Wu of Han, it was bestowed the name Spirit Stream Abbey.

*Records of Perfected Immortals Through the Ages Who Embodied the Dao, Scroll Ten—concluded*
*Records of Perfected Immortals Through the Ages Who Embodied the Dao, Scroll Eleven*

Kong Qiuming, Luo Fatong, Wu Tianyin, Zhang Fashu, Xie Zhikong, Zhou Xianyong, Zou Wujun, Xie Youcha, Yang Yuanzhong, He Zixiao, and three others—thirteen in all—lived during the reign of Qin Ershi. Distressed by the chaos of the times, they swore fellowship, abandoned their official posts, and journeyed far in search of the Great Dao. Among them were three warriors: Li Deshou, Song Yundiao, and Tang Jianwei, whose lineages, ranks, and native places remain unknown. Upon first arriving at Mount Lu, they wished to rest. One evening, a fierce wind and torrential rain formed a stream, within which they discovered a stone inscription reading: *"Divine transformation at Spirit Stream; golden tablets mark the Perfected’s decree—hidden dwelling in the Jade Grotto."* The three remained by the stream, and this is the site of present-day Spirit Stream Abbey.

The other ten—Kong’s family resided southwest of Jade Bamboo Mountain, and Wu’s family west of Gan River. Kong said: *"The peaks of Qunyu in the south are the Seventeenth Grotto-Heaven, known as the Celestial Realm of Great Elegance and Dharma Joy. The mountains are refined, the grottoes numinous—we may follow our original resolve and dwell here in retreat. How could we abandon our path midway?"* The ten prepared their belongings and hastened to Qunyu. Kong said: *"West of the Grotto-Heaven, extraordinary peaks rise in splendor—there must be a sacred crag where we may rest and pay homage to the Primordial."* Indeed, before a southeastern stone cliff, they encountered a branching cavern. On the wall was ancient seal script, which read: *"Western Gate of the Grotto-Heaven."*

All ten were reclusive gentlemen of lofty virtue, refining their spirits and harmonizing their qi, each practicing distinct arts. One day, an elder in plain robes arrived holding a bronze basin containing ten small carp. He said: *"These fish are extraordinary—tend to them well."* They promptly dug a pond behind the Grotto-Heaven to house them, and later generations called it the Dragon-Rearing Pool.

He Zixiao loved distant travels and was often careless, ignoring the exhortations of his companions. The other nine, recognizing that immortality could be cultivated, redoubled their efforts. During the reign of Emperor Jing of Han, their Daoist practices reached perfection. A spirit descended to their hermitage, identifying itself as the Controller of Destiny of the Grotto-Heaven, and addressed the nine: *"Your sincerity has reached its peak. Today, your names are inscribed in the northern register of Dengluo, and your titles engraved in the Southern Palace."* It then transmitted the secret of returning cinnabar and departed. After refining and consuming the elixir, the spirit returned, saying: *"The August Emperor’s edict is imminent—hasten to the Immortal-Sending Terrace."* They awaited the appointed hour, and when the time came, a host of immortals had already arrived. A grand feast was laid out in farewell, resembling an imperial court assembly. As the wine circulated, a pure breeze arose, clouds gathered in ranks, and a fragrant mist enveloped them. Nine dragons drew the carriage, while phoenixes and luan birds danced before them. The Jade Emperor dispatched envoys in embroidered robes and azure-clad youths, bearing ten jade tablets, ten chests of rosy-cloud robes, a casket of golden elixir, and rainbow banners with feathered staffs—all presented upon the terrace.

Only He Zixiao, still wandering afar, had not returned. From dawn to mid-morning, the nine Perfected consumed the elixir, changed into their celestial robes, and prepared their carriages. As they waited in vain, they left one jade tablet, one chest of rosy-cloud robes, and a plain register upon the Flying Immortal Stone for him. The immortal music grew plaintive, and the assembly of immortals urged their departure. Perfected Kong sighed: *"Immortal Liang, oh Immortal Liang! To what realm do you wander? I now depart—why do you alone remain?"* Soon after, their forms ascended, vanishing into the distance. The nine dragons that drew their carriage were none other than the carp they had once reared.

Before their ascension, the nine Perfected had forged ten treasured swords at the Stone Terrace in the eastern sun. One was given to Immortal Liang to wear, another buried at the Immortal-Sending Terrace, and the rest enshrined to guard the eight gates of the Grotto-Heaven.

**He Zixiao**
He Zixiao, styled Immortal Liang, was also said to bear the surname Deng. After the nine Perfected had ascended, Immortal Liang finally returned, his spirit untrammeled, weeping before the mist and clouds. He climbed the Flying Immortal Stone and received the chest and register. The Perfected Lord Controller of Destiny arrived and said: *"You, Perfected One, have defied the Jade Emperor’s decree and may not attend the Primordial Assembly of the Nine Perfected. Your merit remains incomplete—you may conceal yourself in the Yuan Gui Grotto."* Opening the chest and donning the robe, he examined the plain register, which contained the method for consuming the herbs of Great Clarity, stating that it could confer earthly immortality. It also mentioned a grotto northeast of the mountain, situated in the open plains—this was the abode of earthly immortals, where he might reside.

Immortal Liang overturned the chest atop the peak, and in an instant, it transformed into stone. Later generations named the peak after it, for its shape bore a striking resemblance. He also released a white ape and a dog, both of which fed on the immortal herbs and ascended into the void. Immortal Liang consumed the herbs of Great Clarity and practiced the secret methods of the plain register. Within days, he could traverse the emptiness. Massive boulders from the remnant mountains flew into the stone grotto—such was the way of earthly immortals.

Initially, the spirit had commanded them to rear the fish in the pool, which transformed into nine dragons to carry the nine Perfected aloft. Upon inspection, the pool was gone. Only one fish surfaced intermittently, later transforming into a dragon that concealed itself in the branching grotto.

**Tang Gongfang**
Tang Gongfang, also recorded as Tang Gongfang, was a native of Xingyuan Prefecture.

In Xingyuan stood the Dou Mountain Abbey. From the flat plains rose a solitary mountain, its four faces sheer cliffs, its summit flat as the bottom of a dipper—hence its name. The *Kaishan Jing* states: "Five caverns of Dou Mountain connect to Kunlun. Among the mountains dwell thousand-year-old toads called *rouzhi*, whose flesh, when eaten, grants a thousand years of life." The mountain was wreathed in creeping fig and draped in fir and juniper, its scenery most wondrous. Nearby lay the site where Tang Gongfang had drunk immortal wine with Li Babai, and where his entire household had ascended bodily into the heavens. The foundation of his former residence, some three *mu* in size, had sunken into a pit—this was where the earth itself had risen with them. Another account claims that when Gongfang ascended with his household, his parrot and dog followed, but his rat, despising its own lack of ambition, refused to go. The rat later repented, vomiting thrice in a month to replace its entrails, becoming the famed "Tang rat" of Guang Weimo’s records. A poem left by a former visitor reads:

*Robe of rosy mist, half-drunk, near to soar,*
*Unseen, the whole household dwells now evermore.*
*The homestead recalls but parrot and hound,*
*Who would believe the road to heaven so near and bound?*
*From the Three Clarities’ vastness, the dust-dream cast,*
*To the Eight Radiant Mists, the morning court is passed.*
*Only the old grove, verdant and proud,*
*Where dew and haze veil the startled terrace, enshroud.*

In Yangzhou stood Cold Spring Mountain. The *Hanzhong Ji* records: "Qin-era Tang Gongfang became a disciple of the immortal Li Babai. When Gongfang grew thirsty, Li struck the cliff with his staff, and a spring gushed forth." This was the very mountain. Those who ascend it must do so with utmost reverence.

At times, when disputes arose, sudden storms of wind and thunder would erupt—hence its name.

**Ding Lingwei**
Ding Lingwei was a native of Liaodong. In his youth, he followed a master and attained the Dao of immortality, gaining the power to divide his form at will. Often, he would transform into a white crane and alight upon the ornamental pillar outside the city gate of his hometown, where he spoke:

*"I am Ding Lingwei, gone from home a thousand years. Now I return—
The city walls stand as before, but the people are not the same.
Why not learn the Way and flee the tomb’s shadow?"*

Then he soared high into the heavens and departed. That Zuo Yuanfang became a sheep and Lingwei a crane were but fleeting transformations of their time, not permanent forms. The genealogies of Liaodong’s Ding clan record that Lingwei attained immortality through Daoist practice during the early Han.

**Zhang Liang**
Zhang Liang, styled Zifang, was descended from the people of Han. When Qin destroyed Han, Liang used his family’s wealth to hire assassins to strike at the King of Qin and avenge his homeland. As his ancestors had served five generations as Han’s ministers, Liang once studied rites in Huaiyang. On the shores of Cangzhou, he encountered a strongman who wielded an iron mace weighing one hundred and twenty *jin*. When the First Emperor of Qin toured the east and reached Bolangsha, Liang and his retainer lay in ambush. They struck at the imperial procession but mistakenly hit the escort carriage. Enraged, the First Emperor sought the assailants with great urgency. Liang changed his name and fled into hiding in Xiapi.

Once, while strolling near Xiapi, Liang came upon an old man in coarse hempen robes standing on a bridge (the people of Chu called bridges *yi*). The man deliberately dropped his shoe beneath the bridge and said to Liang, "Boy, go down and fetch it." Liang was startled and wished to strike him, but out of respect for his age, he restrained himself, descended, retrieved the shoe, and knelt to present it. The old man placed his foot out to receive it, much to Liang’s astonishment. The man said, "You are teachable. Meet me here at dawn in five days." Liang, puzzled, knelt and agreed.

At dawn on the fifth day, Liang arrived, but the old man was already there. Angrily, he asked, "Why are you late?" He instructed Liang to return at the crowing of the rooster five days later. When Liang arrived, the old man was again already there and scolded him for his tardiness. After another five days, Liang went at midnight. After a short while, the old man arrived and, pleased, said, "This is how it should be." He produced a scroll and said, "Read this, and you will become the teacher of kings. In ten years, you will rise. Thirteen years from now, you will see me beneath the city walls of Jibei in Gucheng—there, the yellow stone is me." Then he vanished.

At daybreak, Liang examined the scroll and found it to be *The Art of War of the Grand Duke*. Astonished, he studied and recited it often. While in Xiapi, he acted as a knight-errant and frequently advised the Lord of Pei using the strategies of the Grand Duke. The Lord of Pei delighted in his counsel and often followed it, though he paid little heed to others’ advice. Liang remarked, "The Lord of Pei is surely heaven’s chosen." Thus, he remained by his side and never left.

When the Lord of Pei sought to attack Qin’s forces at Hangu Pass, Liang said, "I hear their general is the son of a butcher, a merchant easily swayed by profit. I suggest we hold our position, raise more banners on the mountains to create the illusion of a larger force, and send Li Yiji with precious gifts to win over the Qin general." The Qin general considered making peace, and when his guard was down, they struck. The Qin army was defeated, and they advanced to Xianyang, where the King of Qin, Ziying, surrendered.

When the Lord of Pei entered the Qin palace, he saw its curtains, carriages, hunting dogs, treasures, and women—numbering in the thousands—and wished to remain. Though Fan Kuai remonstrated, he did not listen. Liang said, "Qin ruled without the Way, which is why you have come this far. To rid the world of tyranny, you should conduct yourself with simplicity. Now, upon entering Qin, you indulge in its pleasures—this is to aid Jie in his cruelty. Loyal words may grate upon the ear, but they benefit conduct; bitter medicine may be hard to swallow, but it cures illness. I hope you will heed this advice." The Lord of Pei then withdrew his troops to Bashang. (For the meeting at Hongmen, see *The Annals of the Han Emperor Gao*.)

When the Lord of Pei became the King of Han, Liang advised him to burn and sever the plank roads, signaling to the world that he had no intention of returning, thus reassuring Xiang Yu. After the King of Han pacified the Three Qin, Liang sent a letter to Xiang Yu, saying, "The King of Han lost his rightful position and merely wishes to reclaim Guanzhong. If the covenant is honored, he will stop and dare not advance further." He also sent a letter to Xiang Yu regarding Qi’s rebellion, stating, "Qi and Zhao seek to jointly destroy Chu." As a result, Xiang Yu turned north to attack Qi.

The King of Han enfeoffed Liang as the Marquis of Chengxin and followed him east to strike at Chu. After their forces were defeated and they retreated, the king dismounted, sat upon his saddle, and asked, "I wish to relinquish the lands east of Hangu Pass—who can I entrust with this task to share in the merit of defeating Chu?" Liang replied, "The King of Jiujiang, Ying Bu, was once a fierce general under Xiang Yu and has a rift with him. Peng Yue has rebelled in Liang with the King of Qi. These two men can be urgently dispatched. Among your generals, only Han Xin can be entrusted with great matters and command an entire front. If you wish to relinquish these lands, bestow them upon these three men, and Chu can be destroyed." The King of Han then sent Sui He to persuade Ying Bu to join forces with Peng Yue. Ultimately, it was these three who defeated Chu.

Liang was often ill and served as a strategist, accompanying the king intermittently. In the third year of Han, Xiang Yu besieged the King of Han at Xingyang. The king consulted with Li Yiji on how to undermine Chu’s power. Li Yiji said, "In ancient times, when Tang overthrew Jie, he enfeoffed Jie’s descendants in Qi; when King Wu punished Zhou, he enfeoffed Zhou’s descendants in Song. Now that Qin has destroyed the Six States, if Your Majesty truly restores their descendants, they will all vie to support your virtue and righteousness, willingly becoming your subjects. Once your virtue and righteousness are established, you may face south and proclaim yourself overlord, and Chu will surely fold its robes and pay homage." The King of Han said, "Excellent." He hurriedly had seals carved and instructed Li Yiji to distribute them.

Before Li Yiji could depart, Liang arrived from outside. The King of Han was eating and said, "A guest has devised a plan for me to undermine Chu’s power." He recounted Li Yiji’s proposal in full. Liang said, "Allow me to borrow your chopsticks to calculate this." (See the first scroll of *Western Texts* for the argument against restoring the Six States.) "If this plan is truly adopted, Your Majesty’s cause is lost."

The King of Han spat out his food in fury and cursed, "This pedantic fool nearly ruined my great enterprise!"

When Han Xin conquered Qi and sought to be named its king, the King of Han flew into a rage. Zhang Liang persuaded him—this is recorded in *The Biography of Han Xin*.

In the fifth year, the King of Han fortified his position at Guling, but the feudal lords failed to arrive. Zhang Liang advised him, and the lords all came—this is recorded in *The Annals of Emperor Gao*.

In the sixth year, he enfeoffed his meritorious ministers. Though Zhang Liang had never fought on the battlefield, the Emperor said, "To devise strategies within the command tent and secure victory a thousand *li* away—this is your achievement, Master Zhang." He offered Zhang Liang the choice of any three *wan* households in Qi. Zhang Liang replied, "When I first joined you at Xiapi, we met at Liu, and Heaven bestowed me upon Your Majesty. Though my plans have fortunately met with success, I ask only for Liu as my fief." Thus, he was enfeoffed as the Marquis of Liu, ranked alongside Xiao He and the others. The remaining ministers, still vying for rewards, had yet to receive their enfeoffments.

The Emperor resided in Luoyang—further details are in the first scroll of *Western Texts*—and Zhang Liang petitioned him to establish the western capital in Guanzhong. That very day, the Emperor set out for Guanzhong, with Zhang Liang accompanying him. Prone to illness, Zhang Liang practiced *daoyin*, abstained from grains, and secluded himself indoors. Over a year later, the Emperor sought to depose the Crown Prince and install Lady Qi’s son, Prince Ruyi of Zhao, in his place.

Empress Lü dispatched Lü Ze, the Marquis of Jiancheng, to coerce Zhang Liang, saying, "You have long been the Emperor’s chief strategist. Now that he daily contemplates replacing the Crown Prince, how can you rest easy?" Zhang Liang replied, "This cannot be resolved with mere words. However, there are four men the Emperor has been unable to summon. All are advanced in years, and because the Emperor treats scholars with disdain, they fled into hiding in the mountains, refusing to serve Han on principle. Yet the Emperor holds them in high regard. If you earnestly invite them, they may come. Once here, treat them as guests and have them accompany the Crown Prince to court. Their presence alone will be of aid."

Thereupon, Empress Lü instructed Lü Ze to send envoys bearing the Crown Prince’s letter, with humble words and generous gifts, to welcome the four men. By the eleventh year, when Ying Bu rebelled, the Emperor, stricken with illness, wished to send the Crown Prince to suppress the revolt. The four men then advised the Marquis of Jiancheng, "If the Crown Prince leads troops and achieves merit, his position will not be strengthened; if he fails, he will invite disaster. The generals who helped the Emperor conquer the realm are all formidable warriors. To have the Crown Prince command them would be like setting a sheep to lead wolves. We have heard that the mother who is loved will see her son embraced. Now, Lady Qi attends the Emperor day and night, and the Prince of Zhao is always at his side—it is clear he is destined to replace the Crown Prince. Why not urgently petition Empress Lü to seize the moment and weep before the Emperor, saying: ‘Ying Bu is a fierce general, skilled in warfare. The other generals are all Your Majesty’s peers—if you send the Crown Prince to command them, none will obey. Moreover, when Ying Bu hears of this, he will march west with drums beating. Though Your Majesty is ill, you must force yourself into a war chariot and personally oversee the campaign, for none will dare to hold back.’"

Following the four men’s advice, the Emperor said, "This boy is not up to the task—I must go myself." As he prepared to lead the army east, Zhang Liang, though ill, struggled to rise and see him, saying, "The men of Chu are swift and fierce—I urge you not to engage them directly." He then advised the Emperor to appoint the Crown Prince as General and overseer of the troops in Guanzhong. The Emperor replied, "Though you are ill, Master Zhang, force yourself to assist the Crown Prince." At the time, Shusun Tong served as Grand Tutor, while Zhang Liang acted as Junior Tutor. They accompanied the Emperor to crush Ying Bu.

Upon their return, the Emperor’s illness worsened, and his desire to replace the Crown Prince grew stronger. Zhang Liang remonstrated, but the Emperor would not listen, so he withdrew from court due to illness. Shusun Tong cited ancient precedents and risked death to protest, but the Emperor feigned agreement while still intending to make the change.

At a banquet, the Crown Prince attended as cupbearer, accompanied by the four men. All were over eighty, with snowy hair and brows, their robes and caps magnificent. The Emperor, surprised, asked, "Who are these four?" Each gave his name, and the Emperor exclaimed, "I have sought you, yet you fled from me. Why now do you accompany my elder brother?" The four replied, "Your Majesty treats scholars lightly and often berates them. We refused to endure such humiliation. But we have heard the Crown Prince is benevolent and filial, respectful and fond of scholars. All under Heaven stretch their necks, longing to die for him. That is why we have come." The Emperor said, "I trouble you to continue guiding and protecting the Crown Prince."

After the four men offered their toasts and departed, the Emperor watched them go, then summoned Lady Qi and pointed them out, saying, "I wished to replace the Crown Prince, but these four have become his wings. Now that they are fully formed, he cannot be shaken." Lady Qi wept, and the Emperor said, "Dance the Chu dance for me, and I will sing you a Chu song." His song went:

*"The swan goose soars high, with a single flight a thousand* li.
Its wings now fully grown, it cuts across the four seas.
Cutting across the four seas—what can be done?
Though there be nets and arrows, where can they be set?"*

After singing several stanzas, Lady Qi danced with forced cheer, her tears flowing. The banquet ended, and the Crown Prince’s position was never changed—this was due to Zhang Liang’s success in summoning the four men.

Zhang Liang had often discussed matters of state with the Emperor at leisure. He then declared, "My family served as ministers to Han for generations. When Han fell, I did not惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜惜

Six years later, he passed away, and was posthumously enfeoffed as Marquis Wen of Liu. When Master Zhang first encountered the old man on the Yí Bridge, thirteen years later he followed the High Emperor in passing through Jǐběi, and indeed found the yellow stone beneath Gǔchéng Mountain, which he took and treasured, enshrining it in worship. When Master Zhang passed away, he was buried together with the yellow stone. Each time he visited the tomb, he would prostrate himself and sacrifice to the yellow stone. His son, Bùyí, succeeded him, and the *Book of Han* records this.

Daoist scriptures state: After Master Zhang ascended as an immortal, by the eighth generation his descendant Dàolíng attained the Dao and ascended in flight. The Supreme Lord sent Master Zhang down as an imperial envoy. Your servant Dao Yi says: The perfected man, when hidden, becomes a celestial immortal; when manifest, he brings auspiciousness to the world. Thus, in cultivating himself alone, he rectifies his mind and nurtures his person with sincerity; in benefiting all under heaven, he orders his household, governs the state, and brings peace to the realm. The Way is ever present in both, depending only on whether one’s circumstances are straitened or flourishing, concealed or revealed. Zhang Liang may be called one who embodied the Way in both aspects.

The *Dao De Jing* says:
Cultivated in the person, its virtue becomes true;
Cultivated in the household, its virtue overflows;
Cultivated in the village, its virtue endures;
Cultivated in the state, its virtue abounds;
Cultivated in all under heaven, its virtue is universal.

This precisely describes Zhang Liang’s loyalty to Hán, through which he accomplished the great enterprise of Hàn. Yet though immortals achieve merit and fame in the world, do they seek wealth and honor for self-glorification? No—it is but the fulfillment of their aspiration, and thus in the end they return to the world’s refuge.

The scripture further says: "When merit is accomplished, fame achieved, and the person withdrawn—this is the Way of Heaven." Is this not what it means?

Sū Dān.

Sū Dān was a native of Guìyáng. His mother, née Lǐ, once washed silk in the river when she struck a sunken log and conceived. At Dān’s birth, a pair of cranes flew into the courtyard, their radiance piercing the doors and windows. As a child of but a few years, he seldom spoke and took no part in childish games—some say he had already attained the Dao of immortality. When he played with other children, he often rode a deer, which appeared no different from any other. Yet when they came to perilous or impassable terrain, he could always leap across. The children asked, “How is it that your deer is unlike all others?” He replied, “It is a dragon.”

From youth, he was renowned for his utmost filial piety. At fourteen, his mother, who had been eating meat, said, “I suddenly crave *lǒng* fish from Zīxīng, but it is too far to obtain.” Dān replied, “I shall go to the market for it.” His mother took it as a jest and smiled. Before she had finished eating, Dān placed the fresh fish before her, saying, “Here is *lǒng* fish from Zīxīng.” His mother said, “You are most honest and sincere—Zīxīng is over two hundred *lǐ* away. How could you go and return in an instant? You deceive me.” Dān replied, “When I bought the fish, I saw my uncle. I told him to convey my regards to you, and he will visit in a few days.” His mother ate the fish and found it was indeed *lǒng* fish from Zīxīng. Soon after, his uncle arrived and recounted seeing Dān in the market. His mother marveled greatly at the affair—some say that when his mother desired fish soup, Dān went to the market in Xiāngzhōu to buy it, though it was fourteen hundred *lǐ* from home, and returned in an instant. Dān’s uncle, a clerk in the prefecture, saw the boy in the market and sent a letter home, astonishing the household.

One day, Dān told his mother, “The fruit of the Dao is now perfected, and the day of my ascension draws near. I shall soar through the realm of clouds and waters, freed from the dust and mire of the world. The stem and root of life are now mine to command; the jade terrace and purple palace are but my own abode. Neither yīn nor yáng can mold me, nor heaven and earth claim jurisdiction over me. Though mountains and valleys shift, I shall not; though sun and moon age, I shall not. The primordial qi of the true origin endures for ten thousand ages.”

His mother said, “I rely on you—if you leave, on whom shall I depend? Why speak of going?” Dān replied, “I have often heard my master say: When one ascends as an immortal, nine generations of kin receive protection, and even those who have passed are no longer mere shades. Though I depart, I shall know all your movements and breaths.” He then left a locked chest, sealing it tightly, and instructed her not to open it. If she needed anything, she had but to speak of it, and it would be as she wished—some say he told her thus.

He said to the villagers, “In two years, a great plague will strike the land.” He planted orange trees and dug a well, saying, “Those who fall ill need only eat one orange leaf and drink a cup of this spring water to recover”—some say that when Dān was about to depart, he warned, “This year, a great pestilence will come, and nearly half will perish. Draw water from this well and drink, and you shall suffer no harm.” Later, all came to pass as he had foretold.

As he finished speaking, five-colored clouds descended into the courtyard, and the faint strains of flutes and drums approached.

Dān then ascended into the clouds, weeping as he bid farewell to his mother and the villagers, and slowly drifted away toward the southeast. Hundreds of villagers and local officials witnessed this—it was the third year of Emperor Wen of Han’s reign. Some say that when Dān had attained the Dao, dozens of white cranes descended at his gate, and he mounted them to rise into the clouds and the heavens.

Thereafter, whenever his mother lacked for anything, she would pray before the chest, and all she desired would appear. One day, missing Dān, she thought he might be inside and opened the chest—only to find nothing within, save two cranes soaring into the sky.

Two years after Sū Xiān’s ascension, a great plague indeed struck the region. The people took orange leaves and spring water to cure their illness, and all recovered at once; hundreds, even thousands, were saved. The prefect, his officials, and the townsfolk all bowed in worship beneath the orange trees and by the well, where offerings were made as if at a bustling market.

Before long, Dān’s mother fell ill, and Dān would often come to inquire after her. Soon after, she passed away at over a hundred years of age. The court ordered the prefect to oversee her funeral, and she was buried south of Sū Mountain. At that time, apes wailed in grief and cranes cried in sorrow; the wind grew bleak and the mist dim, clouds of sorrow lingered unbroken, and a mournful rain fell cold. From the mountaintop came the sound of weeping—distant when heard from afar, yet near when listened to closely.

The prefect, leading his officials and the townsfolk, climbed the mountain to console Dān. Though they heard the weeping of the immortal, they could not see his form. Prefect Lú Xiànkě then said, “Without this visit of consolation, we would have no chance to pay homage to the immortal. I wish to behold your countenance, that my worldly hindrances may be dispelled—this would be not only my own fortune, but that of my entire clan.”

Dān replied, “The paths of immortals and mortals differ; our fates rise and fall along separate roads. I do not begrudge letting you see me, but I fear your blessings and karmic retribution may not allow you to behold me fully.” He then said, “I shall let you see half of me.” Dān revealed half his face and one arm to Xiànkě and the others. The officials saw that his face was like true jade, radiant and luminous, while his arm bore fine hair, its glow rivaling the sun’s rays.

The officials bowed again in reverence. The immortal Dān said, “The mountain path is perilous, and you have labored far, my lords. I shall build a bridge so you may return home safely—only, do not look back.” He took a scroll of the *Jade Axis Scripture of the Golden Court* and cast it into the air. In an instant, a great bridge formed, spanning the void like a jade rainbow, its railings and beams adorned with gold and jewels.

Lú Xiànkě and the officials ascended the bridge, soon arriving at the prefecture. Only the magistrate Zhāng Xìnchén glanced back and fell into a deep ravine. Yet he landed upon rotten wood and withered leaves, unharmed, and after three days made his way back to the prefecture.

After Dān’s mother’s passing, the weeping on the mountain ceased only when the mourning garments were put away. Later, the prefect reported these events to the throne. The mountain was named Sū Immortal Mountain, its temple called Sū Immortal Temple, and the prefect conducted seasonal rites there with solemn purity.

Yuán Jié wrote a poem:
*A divine orange, rootless, a well with spring—*
*This world is but a dream, another thousand years.*
*No homeland to return to, only cranes alight again;*
*Now which immortal is this, bearing what name?*
*Wind chimes on the dew-drenched altar, all is still;*
*Desolate paths, overgrown with creeping grass.*
*How might one draw near to Lord Sū,*
*As rainbow banners escort him to the heavens in broad daylight?*

Another poem by Shěn Bīn on Sū Immortal Mountain:
*Eyes strain through the forest altar to see Bāng Prefecture,*
*Where well and spring intertwine in tangled roots.*
*Seeking the Dao, yet sitting idle—*
*When will this toiling life ever cease?*
*Sū’s old dwelling, aged in mist and clouds;*
*Xī’s tomb, overgrown with sorrowful grass and trees.*
*Of right and wrong through the ages, none can ask—*
*As the sun sets in the west, the waters flow east.*

In the early Song dynasty, a crane alighted upon the roof beams of the prefectural hall and remained for some time. The prefect’s subordinates and their sons gathered to watch, and one shot at it with a pellet bow. The crane lifted its foot and traced characters upon the roof, which was tiled with wooden planks. Then it spread its wings and ascended into the clouds. The prefect sent men to climb onto the roof, where they found the inscribed words:
*Returning once more after parting from my homeland,*
*Yet not by the reckoning of sixty-year cycles.*
*Do you not recall the shifting hills and valleys,*
*The white bones blanketing the fields, the green mountains of old?*
*Perched high upon the rooftop,*
*I look down upon the crowd of children below.*
*I am Sū the Immortal—why shoot at me?*
*Turning beyond the clouds, I return to my abode.*

Some say Dān rode a white crane to alight upon the northeastern tower of the prefectural city. When someone shot at it with a pellet bow, the crane inscribed upon the lacquered roof planks:
*Though the city walls remain, the people are not the same;*
*Two hundred and forty years have passed since I last returned.*
*I am Sū the Immortal—why shoot at me?*
The prefect took the plank and stored it in the government office, later returning it to the temple. The immortal never came again.

During the Shaoxing reign of Emperor Gaozong, Sū Xiān was granted the title *True Man of Pure Ascension and Universal Response*.

Sīmǎ Jìzhǔ

Sīmǎ Jìzhǔ was a man of Chǔ who practiced divination in the markets of Cháng’ān. During the reign of Emperor Wen of Han, the grand masters Jiǎ Yì and Sòng Zhōng said, “We have heard that sages do not always dwell in court but may wander among the dusty streets. Let us go and observe him.”

They found Jìzhǔ seated in leisure, his disciples reciting the *Records of Yin and Yang* at his side. The two said, “Judging by your appearance, Master, and listening to your words, we have never seen the like. High rank and noble position are bestowed upon the worthy—why do you follow such a roundabout path?”

Jìzhǔ laughed and said, “You gentlemen seem to possess some Daoist arts, yet your words are crude. Now, when barbarians refuse to submit and the four seasons fall out of harmony, you rise in vain to speak, drawing one another by power and extending one another by profit. Even the worthy should be ashamed of this. To be free of hunger and cold within, untroubled by robbery or seizure without, honored when in high position and unharmed when in low—this is the Way of the noble man. Divination as a profession is what is called ‘the highest virtue not acting as virtue.’ The phoenix does not flock with sparrows and swallows—how could you petty men understand the elder?”

The two were suddenly struck with self-doubt. Later, they said to each other, “The Way is honored when one is at peace; power is dangerous when it is high. To divine without careful consideration is to risk losing one’s essence. To plan for one’s life without caution is to have no place to stand.”

Later, Song Zhong met with punishment, and Jia Yi, moved by the roc’s fate, did not flee from Master Ji’s mirror of warning.

Master Ji entered the Great Abundance Palace within Mount Weiyu, where he studied under Master Xiling. Master Xiling was a transcendent maiden of the Supreme Mystery, who had received the Dao of the Stone Essence, Golden Radiance, Hidden Light, and Transformative Form. As he prepared to depart, he left behind a pillow and mat in place of his form, nearly indistinguishable from his true body. His family buried them south of Mount Pan in Shu.

Zhuge Liang inscribed his stele in praise:
*"In the vast silence of the mysterious desert,
Yin and Yang merge in primordial oneness.
Heaven and Earth intermingle in flux,
Myriad beings flourish in manifestation.
The Master’s principles were set forth,
Distinguishing softness and hardness.
Spirits and gods beheld them,
The Six Perfections made luminous."*

After attaining the Dao, Master Ji often recited the Jade Canon, ingested the essence of Bright Cinnabar, and embraced the radiance of Dawn’s Brilliance. His complexion remained like a maiden’s, his beard three feet long, black as ink. He had two children: his son, named Fayu, and his daughter, named Jihua. Both dwelled on Mount Weiyu, together studying the Thirty-Nine Chapters.

Liu Feng

Liu Feng, styled Weihui, was a native of Yingchuan. He studied under Master Ji and ingested the essence of the sun and moon. After attaining the Dao, he returned to his hometown, departing with the semblance of a staff and sandals.

*The Declarations of the Perfected* states: "Liu Weihui of Yingchuan was Liu Feng, the Master of the Imperial Carriage under the Han Emperor. He served Sima Jizhu as an inner disciple. After achieving the Dao, he returned to his hometown in his later years, assuming the form of a staff and sandals, his body concealed beneath a mulberry tree. His traces remain in Ancheng County, Runan."

Bao Shuyang

Bao Shuyang was a native of Guangning. During the reign of Emperor Gao of Han, he served as a grandee to King Zhang Er and King Zhang Ao of Zhao. From

Liu Cheng

Liu Cheng had long arms that hung past his knees and a thick beard. He dwelled for many years on Mount Wudang, five hundred *li* from Xiangyang, a journey he could make from dawn to dusk. Though he made no show of cultivation, he often healed the common folk with medicines and arts. He labored tirelessly, gathering most of his own herbs, and his knowledge of plants and minerals was exhaustive. Liu Daochan, the Inspector of Yongzhou, grew envious of his long arms and had him seized in Xiangyang and sent to the capital under Emperor Wen. Each morning, he was taken by caged cart to the mountains to gather herbs and returned by dusk to the prison of the Minister of Justice. Later, he handed two short scrolls to the jailers, who dared not accept them and burned them in disgust. By night, the scrolls vanished entirely, though the locks and bolts remained undisturbed. One evening, the night patrol of the prison gate captured him and sent him to the Minister of Justice. Liu Cheng told the jailers, "The court will soon execute me. After my burial, I beg you not to nail the coffin shut." He was indeed put to death. Days later, Emperor Wen, troubled by his words, ordered the coffin opened. Inside, no corpse was found—only a bamboo staff.

Minister Dao Yi remarked: "Liu Cheng’s long arms spared him from military service, yet his body brought about his death. Had he truly understood that to know the body is not to know the Dao, and to know the Dao is not to know the body, he would have grasped the subtlety of the Dao—an existence beyond the body, not of a single day’s attainment. This is why, after his execution, only a bamboo staff remained in his coffin." The *Daodejing* states: "My greatest affliction is that I have a body. If I had no body, what affliction could I have?" Scholars should ponder this deeply.

Yan Qing

Yan Qing was a native of Kuaiji. Though poor, he often made charcoal in the mountains when he encountered a stranger who spoke with him. Unaware the man was a divine being, Yan received a scroll as the stranger departed. "Your bones are fit for immortality," the stranger said. "I grant you this divine formula." Yan replied, "I cannot read. What am I to do?" The divine being answered, "No need to read it. Simply place it in a clean vessel and set it on high." He also taught Yan the method of ingesting stalactite essence. Yan accepted the scroll and lived in the mountains, possessing no fine vessel—only a drinking flask. He used it to hold the scroll, and soon, dozens of attendants appeared at his side. When Yan transported charcoal by boat down the mountain, the spirits would tow his vessel, making it seem to move on its own. He healed the sick by bringing the scroll to their homes, and many revered him. One night, returning from a disciple’s home, Yan was stopped by a night patrol. The captain demanded, "Who goes there?" Yan retorted, "Who are *you* to be out at night?" Enraged by his insolence, the captain ordered his men to seize the offender. Yan then commanded his attendant spirits, "Arrest all these night travelers!" He strode away, leaving the captain and his dozens of men and horses unable to move. The next morning, passersby found the captain and asked why he was stranded. He recounted the events, and they said, "This must be Master Yan." The captain replied, "I cannot move. Send word to my family to kneel before Yan and beg forgiveness, saying I did not know it was you last night. Ask him to release us." Yan then shouted, "Release those arrested last night!" The captain and his men were freed. Thereafter, night travelers would first ask, "Are you Master Yan?" before proceeding. Later, Yan ceased eating grains and, after a year, ascended to Mount Xiaohuo as an immortal. Today, in Wu and Kuaiji, many honor him as the deity of the Yan family, though they no longer seek immortality through herbs and elixirs, content with offerings alone.

Wang Gushen

Wang Gushen and Pi Xuanyao were Daoist masters of Mount Qingcheng in Shu during the Western Han. Precocious from youth, they spurned worldly honors and mastered the *Laozi*, *Zhuangzi*, *Wenzi*, and *Liezi*, excelling in astrology and cosmology. They wandered famous mountains, crossed the Panzhou shallows, sailed the Xiao and Xiang rivers, and reached Mount Heng, where they built a hut beside the Golden Mother’s shrine.

Later, they cultivated embryonic breathing to return to the primordial, and after several years, their Dao was accomplished. They roamed the Jade Clusters and sought the Nine Immortals. During Emperor Wu’s southern progress, he encountered them and saw their extraordinary spirit and qi, so he invited them to reside in seclusion on the Western Peak. The emperor bestowed generous gifts and enfeoffed Wang as Master of the Grand Tenuity and Pi as Master of the Primordial Simplicity, honoring them with the rites of a senior minister. Three years later, they rode azure mules and ascended to immortality.

**The Old Man of Mount Tai**
The Old Man of Mount Tai—his name and origins were unknown. During Emperor Wu’s eastern progress and hunt, he saw an old man hoeing by the roadside, his white hair glowing several feet high. Struck by his strangeness, the emperor summoned and questioned him. The old man appeared to be about fifty, yet his face bore the complexion of a youth, his skin and body radiant, unlike ordinary men.

The emperor asked, “What arts of the Dao do you possess?”

The old man replied, “When I was eighty-five, I was decrepit and near death, my hair white and teeth fallen. A Daoist master taught me to abstain from grains, consume wood-infused water, and fashion a spirit pillow. Within the pillow were thirty-two substances: twenty-four to correspond to the twenty-four qi, and eight to align with the eight winds. I practiced this, and my old age reverted to youth—black hair regrew, lost teeth reappeared, and I could walk three hundred li in a day. Now I am one hundred and eighty years old.”

Emperor Wu accepted his formula and bestowed upon him gold and silk. The old man then entered the mountains of Tai, returning to his hometown every five or ten years. After more than three hundred years, he no longer returned.

**Wu Yan**
Wu Yan, styled Zidu, was a native of Beihai. When Emperor Wu of Han encountered Zidu at the Wei Bridge, a dense purple qi, over a *zhang* in height, rose above his head. The emperor summoned and questioned him: “How old are you, and what arts have you attained to bear such an extraordinary qi?”

Zidu replied, “I am now one hundred and thirty-eight years old, yet I possess no special attainment.”

As he prepared to depart, the emperor summoned Dongfang Shuo to assess what Daoist protection this man possessed. Shuo responded, “This gentleman has *yin* protection.”

Emperor Wu dismissed his attendants and questioned Zidu further. Zidu answered, “When I was twenty-five, I suffered from pain in my waist and spine, cold feet I could not warm, a parched and bitter mouth, a dry tongue, and constant nasal discharge. Every joint and limb ached, and my feet were numb—I could not stand for long. Since obtaining this Dao, seventy-three years have passed. I have thirty-six sons, my body remains robust, free from illness, and my strength is as it was in my prime.”

The emperor said, “You are unkind. To possess the Dao and not share it with me is not the conduct of a loyal subject.”

Zidu kowtowed and replied, “I truly know this Dao to be authentic, yet matters of *yin* and *yang* are private affairs within the public sphere—difficult for a subject to speak of. Moreover, its practice runs counter to human nature, and few can endure it. Thus, I dared not make it known.”

The emperor said, “Do not apologize; I was merely jesting with you.” He then received Zidu’s method.

Zidu lived to over two hundred years of age, consuming and refining cinnabar. He ascended to heaven in broad daylight. Emperor Wu later practiced his method but could not fully adhere to it; nevertheless, he attained a lifespan far surpassing that of other emperors.

Li Fengxian was a native of Shu. From childhood, he did not speak. At eighteen, he often sought cold and secluded dwellings to avoid the stench of cooked food and meat. When asked why, he replied, “To know the white and guard the black—Dao values obscurity and silence.”

His master, the Lord of South Mountain, said to him, “I was the flute-playing crown prince of King Ling of Zhou. You have served the Dao for three lifetimes, yet your trials have not been marked by conspicuous merit. Now I transmit to you the method of the Crimson Network, that you may ascend and be delivered to the Southern Palace. My master, Lord Fuqiu, bestowed it upon me, and now I pass it to you. You must apply yourself diligently. If you delay further in this life, you will not be delivered for ten thousand kalpas. I am to become the Attendant of the Morning Audience to the Controller of Destiny of South Mountain, and shall also be appointed as the Perfected One of Tongbai.”

Having spoken, he vanished. Emperor Xuan of Han summoned him, but he did not respond. All was clear, peaceful, and auspicious.

The land was clear, peaceful, and auspicious. Of Pei Commandery was a man who had been Wei Ping in the time of Emperor Gao of Han and whose complexion remained unaged by the reign of Emperor Guangwu. Later, he departed through *shijie* and, over a hundred years later, returned to his hometown. After several days, he again departed through *shijie*.

**Lord of Yellow Mountain**
The Lord of Yellow Mountain cultivated the arts of Pengzu and lived for several hundred years while retaining a youthful appearance. He also pursued the path of earthbound immortality, not seeking ascent to the heavens. After Pengzu’s departure, he compiled Pengzu’s teachings into the *Scripture of Pengzu*. Those who obtain the *Scripture of Pengzu* become like the pine and cypress among trees.

**Lü Gong**
Lü Gong, styled Wenjing, had loved ingesting medicinal substances since youth. Taking one servant and one maidservant, he gathered herbs in the Taihang Mountains when suddenly three figures appeared in the valley. They asked him, “Do you desire long life, yet endure such toil and hardship?” Gong replied, “I truly desire long life but have not encountered a proper method. Thus, I gather and ingest these herbs, hoping for some small benefit.”

One said, “I am surnamed Lü, styled Wenqi.”
Another said, “I am surnamed Sun, styled Wenyang.”
The third said, “I am surnamed Li, styled Wenshang. We are all immortals of the Grand Clarity and Grand Harmony Palace, here to gather herbs and instruct new learners. Since you share our surname and your style contains half of mine, it is your destiny to attain long life. If you follow us to gather herbs, we will teach you the method of immortality.”

Gong bowed and said, “I am fortunate to meet divine beings, but I fear my transgressions are too many to be worthy of instruction. If you deign to save me, it would be as if I were reborn.” He then followed the immortals. After two days, they transmitted a secret formula to Gong and sent him home, saying, “Return to visit your hometown.”

Gong bowed in farewell. The immortals told him, “Though you have been with us for only two days, two hundred years have passed in the human world.” When Gong returned home, he found only empty fields, with no trace of his descendants. He then encountered Zhao Guangfu, a descendant of his hometown several generations later, and asked, “Where is the Lü Gong household?”

The man regarded him with surprise and said, “Where do you come from, to ask about such an ancient figure? I have heard from my ancestors that Lü Gong took one servant and one maidservant into the mountains to gather herbs and never returned, presumed to have been devoured by tigers or wolves. Over two hundred years have passed—why do you ask?” He added, “Your descendant Lü Xi, who lives ten *li* northeast of the city as a Daoist, is often revered by people. You may find him easily.”

Following Guangfu’s words, Gong went to Xi’s home and knocked on the door, calling out. A servant answered, “Where do you come from?” Gong said, “This is my home. Long ago, I went to gather herbs and followed immortals away. Over two hundred years have passed, and now I have returned.”

Xi’s entire household emerged in astonishment and joy, prostrating themselves and saying, “The immortal has returned!” They wept uncontrollably. After staying for some time, Gong transmitted the divine formula to Xi and departed. At the time, Xi was already eighty years old, but after ingesting the formula, he grew increasingly youthful. At two hundred years of age, he entered the mountains. His descendants, generation after generation, took this medicine, never aging or dying, and all attained immortality.

**Chen Anshi**
Chen Anshi was a native of Jingzhao.

Chen Anshi served as a retainer to Guan Shuping. By nature compassionate and kind, whenever he encountered birds or beasts on the road, he would step aside to avoid startling them. He never trod upon living insects nor took any life. At thirty years of age, Shuping, who was devoted to the Dao and longed for transcendence, was suddenly visited by two immortals disguised as scholars. They accompanied Shuping on his travels to observe and test him. Unaware of their true nature, Shuping grew increasingly negligent over time.

One day, as Shuping prepared a fine meal inside, the two immortals returned to the gate and asked Anshi, “Is Shuping at home?” Anshi replied, “He is.” He went inside to inform Shuping, who immediately rose to greet them. His wife stopped him, saying, “Those starving scholars only seek to fill their bellies. Do not feed them.” Shuping then instructed Anshi to go out and say he was not at home. The two men said, “You just said he was here, and now you say he is not. Why?” Anshi replied, “My master told me to say so.” The two men praised him for his honesty and said to one another, “Shuping has cultivated diligently for many years, yet today, upon meeting us, he has grown negligent. Had he not encountered us, he would have nearly succeeded only to fail.”

They then asked Anshi, “Do you enjoy idle amusements?” He answered, “I do not.” They asked further, “Do you seek the Dao and long for immortality?” He replied, “I do seek the Dao, but I have no means to learn it.” The two said, “If you truly seek the Dao, meet us tomorrow morning beneath the great tree north of the road.” Anshi arrived early at the appointed place, but by sunset, the two had not appeared. He rose to leave, saying, “Those scholars must have deceived me.” Just then, the two called out from beside his ear, “Anshi, why are you so late?” He answered, “I came early, but I did not see you.” They said, “We are here to transmit the Dao to you. You have kept our three appointments faithfully.” Anshi always arrived early, and knowing he was teachable, they gave him two pills of medicine, instructing him, “Return home, abstain from all food, and stay in a separate place.” Anshi followed their instructions, and the two often visited him there.

Shuping found this strange, asking, “Anshi stays in an empty room. How can there be voices speaking? I go back and forth but see no one. Why?” Anshi replied, “I am speaking to myself.” Seeing that Anshi no longer ate, drank only water, and rested in a separate place, Shuping suspected he was no ordinary man. Realizing his own folly in failing to recognize a worthy one, he sighed and said, “The Dao is noble, and virtue is precious—they do not depend on age. Though my parents gave me life, without a teacher, I cannot attain longevity. He who first attains the Dao shall be my teacher.” He then humbly assumed the role of a disciple, serving Anshi morning and night, sweeping and cleaning for him. When Anshi’s cultivation was complete, he ascended to heaven in broad daylight. Before departing, he transmitted the essential Dao to Shuping, who later also attained immortality.

**Ling Shouguang**
Ling Shouguang was a native of Fufeng. At over seventy years of age, he obtained the formula for the Vermilion Radiance Pill. After preparing and ingesting it, he experienced its effects, growing increasingly youthful until he appeared no older than twenty. In the first year of *Jian’an* during the reign of Emperor Xian of Han, Shouguang was already two hundred and twenty years old. He often lodged with Hu Tian in Jiangling and died without illness. Tian buried him, but over a hundred days later, someone saw him in Xiaohuang. He sent a letter to Tian, who, upon receiving it, opened the coffin to find it empty. The nails were still intact, and only his sandals remained inside.

**Zhang Lizheng**

Zhang Lizheng and Shi Mingqi were both Daoist practitioners who once studied the Way in the Heng Mountains. During the late Han, Lizheng entered the mountains and consumed *huangjing* (yellow essence), maintaining a robust complexion as though he were still forty years of age. Mingqi entered the mountains at the end of the Wei dynasty, ingesting the *Zexie Baisi* Pill (made of *zexie* and cypress seeds). Together, they dwelled in a cave until both received the *Hongjing* Elixir formula from Lord Wang of Xicheng. They had been taking this elixir for forty years—*Zhen’gao* states forty-three—though they often lamented the scarcity of cinnabar. Both later left for Guangzhou, where they became Buddhist monks during the tenure of Governor Teng Han. There, they achieved inner and outer clarity, their eyes sharp and bodies light, capable of walking five hundred *li* in a day. They then entered the Jiuyi Mountains.

*Zhen’gao* records: "They also practiced *shouyi* (guarding the One) for thirty years." On the first day of the third month, they were summoned by the Eastern Flower Realm and ascended to heaven upon clouds that very day. Their former abodes in Fangzhu remain beneath the earthen mounds.

*Note*: Teng Han served as Governor of Guangzhou in the *jiachen* year of the tenth *Yonghe* reign (354 CE). Their ascension occurred in the *yichou* year, twelve years later, meaning they had already been taking the elixir for thirty years before venturing out.

**Li Gen**

Li Gen, styled Ziyuan, was a native of Xuchang.

There was a man named Zhao Mai who, having heard from his father and grandfather of their transmission through the generations of Li Gen’s teachings, followed Gen from childhood. By the time Mai reached eighty-four, Gen remained youthful and unaged. Formerly, he resided in Shouchun at the home of Wu Dawen, who studied the Dao under him. Gen taught him the method for transmuting gold and silver, which succeeded immediately. Gen possessed transformative abilities: he could sit unharmed in water or fire, and his traveling kitchen could provide for twenty people, serving refined delicacies and rare, exotic foods not native to the region.

One day, he suddenly told Dawen: “Wang Ling is doomed to fail, and Shouchun will soon fall into military chaos. You can no longer stay here—flee at once.” Dawen secretly relayed this to his younger brother, who carelessly let the words slip. When Wang Ling heard of it, he took it as seditious sorcery and sent men to arrest Gen, intending to execute him. At that moment, Gen was about to write a memorial when he suddenly heard that over a thousand soldiers had surrounded Wu’s home in search of him. Gen said to Dawen’s father: “Do not panic. Simply tell them I am not here, and let the officials search themselves. I left yesterday.” Dawen stepped outside, then turned back to glance at Gen—only to find him gone. All his writing implements and belongings had vanished as well.

The soldiers entered and searched every container for food and clothing, leaving no corner unturned, yet they found no trace of Gen. After a long while, Dawen emerged to meet them, and there was Gen, seated as before, composed and unchanged. Gen said to Dawen: “Minister Wang will be executed with his entire clan. Your brother leaked the words, and within ten days, he will die.” All came to pass as he foretold.

Among Dawen’s disciples, there was one who offered his daughter to Gen. This girl was literate, and when Gen was away, she secretly took a scroll of his *Plain Book*. Upon reading it, she found Gen’s own records of his Daoist studies, which stated that he had begun his training under a certain master during the *Yuanfeng* era of the Han (110–105 BCE). Calculating from that time, Gen was already over seven hundred years old. Dawen also described Gen’s eyes as having square pupils, and the *Scriptures of the Immortals* state: “At eight hundred years, a person’s pupils become square.” Gen told his disciples: “I have not attained the great elixir or the ultimate Daoist formulas, only the methods of an earthbound immortal. My lifespan will endure as long as heaven and earth, yet I shall not be counted among the immortals of the lower realms.”

**Huang Jing**

Huang Jing, styled Boyan, was a native of Wuling.

In his youth, Huang Jing studied the classics and served in his prefecture as a subordinate official. Later, he abandoned worldly life to study the Dao on Mount Huo for over eighty years, after which he entered the Central Marchmount. He specialized in qi-absorption and grain avoidance, practicing breath-swallowing and exhalation, embryonic respiration and inner visualization, summoning the Six Jia Jade Maidens, and ingesting the yin-yang talismans. He also visualized the Red Star before the Grotto Chamber, expanding it until it filled his body like fire. By two hundred years of age, he had reverted to youthful vigor. The Daoist Wang Ziyang visited him several times, seeking essential teachings. Huang Jing told Ziyang: “I do not cultivate the Way of ingesting medicinal elixirs, but merely abide by nature—this is but the path of an earthbound immortal. What is there to ask of me?” When asked about the method of the Yin Lord of Xinye for ascending to heaven through divine elixirs, he replied: “That is the ultimate attainment of the great Dao. You may follow him.” He added: “One who can cast aside desires as I have cannot learn what I practice.” Ziyang persisted in his request, so Huang Jing instructed him: “Within the Great Pass lies the Auxiliary Star. Visualize and perceive it, and through repeated practice, the Red Youth will appear there, pointing to the Vermilion Court. Direct your attention and sway it to refine your form. Dispel the Three Corpses, erase the name of death, and if you can guard this steadfastly, you may attain longevity. Lose it, and you will soon sink into darkness.” Ziyang received these teachings and obtained the Dao of long life.

**Gan Shi**

Gan Shi was a native of Taiyuan. He was skilled in qi-absorption and abstained from food and drink. He also ingested *asparagus cochinchinensis* and practiced the arts of the bedchamber, following the methods of Rong Cheng’s *Profound* and *Plain* texts, which he expanded and refined into a single scroll. His practices yielded immediate results, and he cured illnesses without acupuncture, moxibustion, or herbal decoctions. After living over a hundred years, he entered Mount Wangwu and departed as an immortal.

**Huang Ziyang**

Huang Ziyang was a man of the Later Wei who understood the subtleties of long life. He studied the Dao in Mount Boluo for over ninety years, subsisting solely on peach bark and drinking the yellow water from stones. Sima Jizhu transmitted to him the *Eight Directions of Daoist Guidance*, enabling him to transcend the world.

**The Riverside Master**

The Riverside Master’s personal name is unknown; he was also called the Riverside Elder. During the reign of Emperor Wen of the Han, he built a hut of thatch by the river and constantly recited the *Daodejing* of Laozi. Emperor Wen, who admired Laozi’s teachings, issued an edict commanding all princes, nobles, ministers, and prefectural governors with salaries of two thousand *shi* to recite the text. Several passages remained obscure, and none in the realm could elucidate them. Upon hearing the attendant gentleman Pei Kai speak of the Riverside Master’s study of the *Laozi*, the emperor dispatched envoys bearing the unresolved passages to inquire of him. The Master replied: “The Dao is revered, and virtue is noble; they cannot be pressed with questions.” Emperor Wen then personally traveled to see him and said: “Under the vast heavens, there is no land that is not the king’s domain; within the bounds of the earth, there are no subjects who are not the king’s servants. Among the Four Greats of the cosmos, the king occupies one. Though you possess the Dao, you are still my subject. Why do you not humble yourself? I can make men rich or poor, noble or base.” In an instant, the Riverside Master clapped his hands, rose into the air, and floated gently upward like ascending clouds, stopping over a hundred *zhang* above the earth in the void. After a long while, he looked down and replied: “Above, I do not reach heaven; in the middle, I do not burden men; below, I do not dwell on earth. What subject am I to you? How can Your Majesty make me rich or poor, noble or base?” The emperor then understood he was a divine being. He alighted from his carriage, bowed deeply, and apologized: “I, unworthy as I am, have inherited the legacy of my ancestors and bear a talent unequal to my duties, burdened by my inadequacies. Though I govern the affairs of the world, my heart reveres the Dao and virtue. It is only due to my ignorance that much remains unclear. If the Daoist Master would show mercy and aid me, it would be like seeing the light of the sun in the dark of night.” The Riverside Master then presented him with two scrolls of the *Laozi’s Chapter and Verse in Plain Script*, saying: “Study this thoroughly, and your doubts will resolve themselves. Since I annotated this scripture, over seven thousand years have passed, and it has been transmitted to only three people—you make the fourth. Do not pass it to the unworthy.” Emperor Wen knelt to receive the text, and when he finished speaking, the Master vanished. Some say he departed in a rising mist.

Here now stands the Riverside Master’s Temple north of Shan Prefecture, alongside the remnants of Emperor Wen’s Terrace for Gazing at Immortals.

Your servant Daoyi observes: The Riverside Master built his hut by the river, serene and uncalculating, drifting in effortless non-action. His going forth and returning, his concealment and revelation between sacred and mundane, have not been the work of a single day. As the *Daodejing* says: “The Dao is honored, virtue is prized—no one bestows rank upon them, yet they are ever spontaneous.” Truly, this describes the Riverside Master.

One day, Emperor Wen of Han, hearing of his attainment, personally journeyed to him. The Riverside Master then presented him with two scrolls of the *Laozi’s Chapter and Verse in Plain Script*. Thereafter, Emperor Wen governed the realm with reverence and frugality, and later generations praised him as possessing the spirit of the Three Dynasties—was this not the transformative influence of the Riverside Master’s Dao and virtue?

*Comprehensive Mirror of Perfected Immortals Embracing the Dao, Scroll Thirteen*

An Qisheng

An Qisheng was a native of Fuxiang in Langye. He sold medicines by the Eastern Sea, and the people of his time called him the “Thousand-Year Elder.” When the First Emperor of Qin made his eastern progress, he requested an audience and spoke with him for three days and nights. The First Emperor, struck with wonder, bestowed upon him gold and jade worth tens of millions. An Qisheng left them all at the pavilion of Fuxiang, offering only a single red jade crow in return. He left a letter saying: “Seek me at Penglai a thousand years hence.” The First Emperor then dispatched envoys—Xu Fu, Lu Sheng, and several hundred others—to enter the sea, but before they reached Mount Penglai, they repeatedly encountered winds and waves and returned. Shrines were erected along the shores of Fuxiang Pavilion, numbering in the dozens.

The *Han Records of Sacrifices* states: “An Qisheng, the immortal, traverses Penglai. When conditions align, he appears to men; when they do not, he remains hidden.” Yan Shigu’s commentary explains: “Alignment refers to harmony with the Dao.”

The *Veritable Records of the Primal Origin* states: “Later, An Qisheng transmitted the Dao to Ma Mingsheng, Ma to Yin Changsheng, and Yin to Master Erzhu.”

Furthermore, according to the *Records of the Grand Historian*: “Among the descendants of Yue Yi was Yue Chengong, who excelled in cultivating the teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi. His original master was the Riverside Elder, though his origins are unknown. The Riverside Elder taught An Qisheng, An Qisheng taught Mao Xigong, Mao Xigong taught Yue Xiagong, Yue Xiagong taught Yue Chengong, Yue Chengong taught Gai Gong, and Gai Gong taught in Gaomi and Jiaoxi, becoming the master of Chancellor Cao.” It is also said: “In the first year of Emperor Hui’s reign, when Cao Shen was Chancellor of Qi, he summoned all the elders and scholars to inquire how to gather and govern the people. The scholars numbered in the hundreds, each offering different advice, and Cao was unsure whom to follow. Hearing that Gai Gong was skilled in the teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, he sent a messenger with generous gifts to invite him. Gai Gong expounded: ‘In governing, value clarity and stillness, and the people will naturally settle.’ He elaborated on this principle in detail. Cao adopted his methods, and thus served as Chancellor of Qi for nine years, bringing peace to the state.”

The *Collected Biographies of Immortals* records: There was a certain Wang Lao, whose name is unknown. He befriended Feng Junda and the Woman of Lu, wandering in search of the Dao among the famous mountains. On the southern slopes of Mount Tai, they encountered divine immortals riding white deer, accompanied by ten or so attendants, descending from the mountains. Knowing them to be transcendent beings, they bowed twice and begged for the Way of prolonging life. The immortals said: “Do you know of An Qisheng? It is I. Your sincerity has moved Heaven, and the Most High has sent me to transmit to you the secrets of transcending the world.” They then instructed him: “The Dao of immortality is not distant—seek it within yourself. Without thought, without action, neither expelling nor absorbing, the true unity fills your being, and you will attain long life and ascend in flight. Do not let your thoughts churn restlessly, exhausting your vitality.” The Most High says: “Subtle yet ever-present, its use is inexhaustible.” This is the true Dao. With these words, they ascended into the heavens and departed.

The *Baopuzi* further states: An Qisheng had dragon-like brows and a broad forehead, cultivating himself through refinement and ingesting golden elixir to attain long life. He would dwell among the world for a thousand years or more before departing.

Minister Dao Yi remarked: Qin Shihuang, a ruler of boundless extravagance and cruel tyranny—how could one speak to him of the Dao? An Qisheng left behind his gold and jade to show him the virtue of frugality. "Seek me on Penglai a thousand years hence"—this was to show him that immortality could not be learned. Yet he sought to force his way with a single moment’s effort, sailing into the sea to find Penglai—how could he succeed? An Qisheng did not conceal the Dao; Qin Shihuang was simply unworthy of attaining it.

The *Daodejing* says: "Heaven and Earth are not humane; they regard the myriad things as straw dogs. The sage is not humane; he regards the hundred clans as straw dogs." Qin Shihuang indulged his desires of ear and eye, exhausting the world with ceaseless labor, utterly at odds with the hearts of Heaven, Earth, and the sage. Abandoning the Dao to seek long life—could there be immortality outside the Dao? This is why An Qisheng could not remain within the seas and departed for Penglai.

Ma Mingsheng (also written as Ma Wusheng) was a native of Linzi in the state of Qi. His original surname was He, and his courtesy name was Junshi (also written as Xian or Bao). In his youth, he served as a county clerk hunting bandits and was wounded by them. The Perfected Lady of Great Truth, passing by Mount Tai on her way east, saw him and took pity on him.

At that moment, he was near death. After a long while, he suddenly saw a maiden of sixteen or seventeen, her attire strangely magnificent, her beauty unmatched in the world. She walked beside him and asked Junshi, "Why are you bleeding so?" Junshi answered truthfully. The lady said, "Your wound is grave—the blade pierced your lung, your five viscera are ruptured, blood congeals in the Crimson Palace, and qi surges beyond your intestines. This is a mortal crisis. What can be done?" Junshi, realizing she was a divine being, kowtowed and pleaded for mercy, begging for salvation. The lady took a pill from a case at her elbow, no larger than a small bean, and immediately had him swallow it. In an instant, he was cured: the bleeding ceased, the wound closed, and all pain vanished.

Junshi bowed again and knelt, saying, "My family’s wealth is insufficient to repay you. I do not know how to requite your kindness, but I shall devote my humble strength to repay what I have received." The lady replied, "If you truly wish to thank me, your intent is commendable. Would you follow me?" Junshi then changed his name and styled himself Ma Mingsheng, serving the lady as an attendant.

The lady entered the sheer cliffs of Mount Tai in the Eastern Marchmount, where stone chambers clung to precipitous walls, suspended between towering crags and hidden depths, over a thousand *zhang* above the earth. Within the stone chamber stood golden forests and jade tables, rare treasures of wondrous splendor—places no mortal could reach. At first, Mingsheng only wished to learn the art of treating sword wounds, but upon witnessing the comings and goings of immortals, he came to know of the Way of Undying.

From dawn to dusk, he attended to her needs, sweeping and serving without the slightest negligence. The lady tested him with illusions of ghosts, monsters, wolves, and tigers, but Mingsheng remained clear-minded and unshaken, utterly unafraid. She also sent him on errands to lodge elsewhere, where beautiful women would tempt him with flirtation, yet his heart remained steadfast, his resolve untainted by impure thoughts.

At times, the lady would depart for ten or five days, or even a month or twenty, and upon her return, he would see immortals and guests arriving on dragons and phoenixes. Some came to pay their respects, filling the chamber with true immortals for days on end. When guests arrived, she would send Mingsheng to another room. At times, exquisite delicacies, rare fruits, fragrant wines, and strange nectars would appear unbidden, their names beyond mortal ken. Occasionally, she would call Mingsheng to sit and share the feast.

He also heard the ethereal strains of zithers and lutes, their songs exquisitely sweet. The lady herself would sometimes play, her instrument having but one string, yet producing all five notes in harmony—its lofty, mysterious resonance carrying for miles. Flocks of birds would gather at the mouth of the cave, circling and soaring, undeterred even when driven away. Such was the celestial music, the wondrous sound of nature itself.

The lady dwelled with Mingsheng in the same stone chamber, though on separate couches. In that secluded place, only the two of them resided. When she departed, she never revealed her destination, but he would always see a white dragon arrive to welcome her. She would don a cloud-patterned embroidered robe, mount the white dragon, and depart. The robe was adorned with luminous moon pearls stitched along its seams, jade pendants at her waist, and a golden crown of Supreme Mystery. No attendants accompanied her; upon her return, the dragon would vanish, its whereabouts unknown.

Upon a jade-like platform in the stone chamber lay purple brocade quilts and sheer silk curtains. Among the treasures were objects of adornment and playthings—golden caskets, radiant gems, and arrays of black and yellow silks—none of which existed in the mortal world, their names beyond his knowledge. Two scrolls of plain silk bore the title *The Supreme Daoist Scripture of the Nine Heavens*. Mingsheng dared not unroll them to read their contents, attending only to sweeping and guarding the stone chamber. Even the treasures he did not dare to gaze upon, nor did he presume to ask about them.

For five years, he served with ever-increasing diligence, never slackening.

The lady sighed and said to him, "You are truly teachable—surely one who will attain the Dao. Though you are a mortal, you are neither licentious nor negligent, reverently honoring the numinous qi without fail. Even if you sought only longevity and immortality, how could you not succeed?

She then revealed her origins to him: "My surname is Wang, my given name Wanluo, and my courtesy name Bosui. I serve in the Supreme Mystery of the Great Perfection. My son holds the post of Chief Inspector of the Three Heavens’ Supreme Bureau, overseeing the ranks of celestial officials. In his youth, he was repeatedly entrusted with duties but wandered in idleness, neglecting his responsibilities. The authorities memorialized his misconduct, and he was demoted to the register of Mount Tai’s Retired Perfected King, where he now oversees the teachers of ghosts and spirits, with his term renewed every five hundred years. I came to observe him and urge him to mend his ways, governing his duties to atone for his past faults.

I have long dwelled among mortals, but now, by the command of our sovereign and the summons of the Supreme One, I may no longer remain. Yet I think fondly of your devotion and thus confide in you. I wished to teach you the methods of longevity and the arts of extending life, but what I have received—nourishment through the Great Harmony, a body naturally formed of dragon’s essence—can only be transmitted to the Perfected of the Three Heavens, not to one at the beginning of their studies. It is not something you may yet hear. Even if you were to hear it, you would surely be unable to apply it to preserve yourself.

There is Anqisheng, who understands the method of the Golden Elixir and the Reverted Cinnabar. His formula is secret and essential, the Dao of the Nine Lords and the Great Unity, by which one ascends to heaven in broad daylight. Anqisheng will come tomorrow, and I shall entrust you to his care. Follow him for a time, and his arts will surely be passed on to you."

The next day, Anqisheng arrived, riding a piebald qilin. He wore a robe of sheer silk, a *yuanyou* cap upon his head, and a jade girdle with a tiger-headed pouch. He appeared to be no more than twenty, radiant and dignified. Six or seven immortals accompanied him, each bearing a staff and attending in reverence.

Upon meeting the Lady, he bowed with utmost reverence and addressed himself as "your humble servant." Soon after, wine, fruit, and a feast were laid out, and they drank and feasted for half a day. The Lady then spoke to Mingsheng: "I can no longer stay. You must follow this gentleman and set your worries aside, for I shall visit you from time to time." With that, she presented him with two five-character poems to sustain their bond.

Mingsheng wept as he took his leave, preparing to follow Anqisheng and receive the Way of the Nine Elixirs. The Lady’s first poem read:

*For now, I leave the city’s walls,*
*To ride my chariot to Mount Tai’s folds.*
*Gazing up at the Great Clarity’s gates,*
*Cloud-palaces rise, towering and cold.*

*Within the void dwells the True One,*
*Coming and going in splendor bright.*
*Refine your form, preserve the natural state,*
*And feast on the Great Harmony’s light.*

*Each dawn, the Nine Heavenly Kings attend,*
*At dusk, I lodge in Western Hua’s embrace.*
*Essence refined may take flight,*
*Breathing in qi to nurture jade’s grace.*

*The supreme medicine is no gold or stone,*
*Yet the wind sings its song untold.*
*Ascending and descending through radiant skies,*
*In feathered robes, how free and bold!*

*The Five Peaks are not my abode,*
*The Dark Capital is my true home.*
*Below, men vie in vain pursuit,*
*Like snails and toads in muck they roam.*

*Gazing back at the dust-choked world,*
*Where woes entangle all they see.*
*If you’ve not grasped the Mystery’s core,*
*Why strive for carving jade needlessly?*

*Misfortune comes when the Dao is revealed,*
*Guard its secrets—blessings will then unfold.*

The second poem read:

*Once I dwelt in Kunlun’s halls,*
*Discoursing on how to extend heaven’s span.*
*Though Golden Elixir grants long years,*
*It cannot match the Great Harmony’s plan.*

*I ascended the Tower of Dark Spirit,*
*In empty reverie, chanting to the divine.*
*Suddenly, I met the King of Mulberry Trees,*
*And the Nine Elders, immortals divine.*

*His chariot was drawn by purple rainbows,*
*His visage radiant, fresh, and bright.*
*He urged me to seek the endless path,*
*And invited me to the Ford of Spontaneity’s light.*

*He taught me the art of soaring flight,*
*And bestowed the Jade Embryo’s scroll.*
*Jade nectar congealed with primal qi,*
*While the White Maiden expounded its role.*

*Embracing the lush jade phoenix’s breast,*
*I soared upward through the Three Heavens’ height.*
*The Cloud Net set my steps in place,*
*And the Five Peaks I could visit in flight.*

*The Dark Capital is not so far,*
*Nor Penglai’s mountain beyond reach.*
*Transmission and reception bind us in love,*
*As friends, we become heaven’s kin.*

*Reveal it, and you’ll face judgment’s decree,*
*For calamity spares neither fool nor sage.*
*Guard it well, and eternity is yours,*
*But leak it, and your body will age.*

After receiving the poems, Mingsheng followed Anqisheng, carrying his staff. They journeyed west to Nüji, north to Yuánqiū, south to Qínlú, and secretly to Qīngchéng and Jiǔyí, traversing the world entire. For twenty years, he endured every hardship. At last, Anqisheng declared: "You truly possess the bones of an immortal, and your devotion surpasses even mine." Thereupon, he transmitted the formula for the Great Clarity’s Golden Elixir Divine Cinnabar and instructed: "If you do not yet wish to ascend to heaven, simply consume half a dose to attain longevity."

Mingsheng then parted ways with Anqisheng and entered Huàyīn Mountain. There, he compounded the Golden Elixir according to the formula and consumed half a dose, attaining immortality while appearing no different from ordinary men—none recognized his extraordinary nature. During the reign of Emperor Ling of Han, only Grand Tutor Hú Guǎng discerned his attainment of the Dao. He once sought Mingsheng’s counsel regarding the dynasty’s fate. At first, Mingsheng remained silent, but later, he revealed all, and every prediction came to pass.

Later, people marveled at his agelessness. He then consumed the remaining half-dose of the Golden Elixir and ascended to heaven in broad daylight. Before departing, he left behind three poems for posterity, written in the third year of *Guānghé*. The first read:

*How enduring is the Great Harmony,*
*Yet man’s life is fleeting as dew at dawn.*
*Gathering like morning’s mist,*
*Vanishing in the blink of an eye upon waking.*

*Life’s cycles are the world’s delusion,*
*For suffering arises from restlessness.*
*I sought the True One,*
*Calming my spirit to embrace the luminous.*

*I lingered in Kunlun’s halls,*
*And roamed the Dark Capital’s expanse.*
*Juānzǐ guided my wanderings,*
*While the Supreme Perfected came to call.*

*Each dawn, I stood before the Queen Mother,*
*At dusk, I returned to Zhōngyuè’s peak.*
*Gazing up, I plucked jade blossoms,*
*Below, I sipped from the gemstone well’s deep.*

*A thousand years pass like a moment,*
*Ten thousand ages like lightning’s flash.*

The second poem read:

*Heaven and earth have their constancy,*
*Yet man’s life is most perilous.*
*Years fly swifter than an arrow loosed,*
*Or a fleeting moment’s light.*

*Though one may possess a radiant form,*
*Jade too gathers dust and grime.*
*Forests and grasses gleam not in autumn,*
*Nor do green leaves endure the year’s time.*

*Pity the lush and thriving, cut down,*
*By a single morning’s frost so dire.*
*Where there is preservation, there is loss,*
*Where there is rise, there is decay’s mire.*

*The True Lord plays at the Mystic Ford,*
*Unfettered by the world’s embrace.*
*His spirit roams the purple clouds,*
*His form dwells by mountain streams’ grace.*

*Facing the void, he forgets all cares,*
*His gaze wanders to the horizon’s rim.*
*What can the world’s dust bring?*
*For the true Dao is vast and prim.*

The third poem read:

*Truly, the turbid world is cause for sighs,*
*Its pleasures unworthy of pursuit.*
*Shaking off my robes, I sweep the dust away,*
*And soar alone, remote and absolute.*

*Amidst the desolate peaks and cliffs,*
*My myriad thoughts scatter like the wind.*
*The numinous Perfected wander with me,*
*As I ride the sun’s descent, a swan’s kin.*

*At dawn, I arrive on cloud-wheels,*
*At dusk, I depart on the whirlwind’s flight.*
*Amidst the clamor of heaven and earth,*
*How can the clamorous find a foothold in light?*

**Yin Changsheng**
Yin Changsheng was a native of Xinye.

In the eighth year of *Yongyuan* during the reign of Emperor He of Han, on the *jichou* day of the third month, Lady Yin was established as empress—she was the great-granddaughter of Yin Changsheng.

Though born into wealth and nobility, she disdained honor and rank. Concealing herself in seclusion, she devoted herself entirely to the arts of the Dao. Later, she heard of Ma Mingsheng, who had attained the method of transcending the world, and so she entered the famous mountains in search of him. Arriving at Taihe Mountain in Nanyang, she finally met him and served as his menial, personally performing the most laborious tasks. Yet Ma Mingsheng did not teach her the Way of transcendence; instead, from dawn to dusk, he spoke only of the fleeting glory of the world and the management of gardens and estates. For over a decade, Changsheng never wavered in her diligence. Twelve others had also sought Ma Mingsheng’s instruction, but all grew resentful and departed—only Changsheng’s reverence deepened. Whenever she erred in speech, Ma Mingsheng would scold and berate her, yet she remained composed, offering apologies without hesitation. After twenty years of such devotion, one day in leisure, Ma Mingsheng asked what she desired. Changsheng knelt and replied: *"I seek only life itself. With this body of dust and straw, I have entrusted myself to the Heavenly Craftsman. I dare not be impatient, nor fear delay."*

Moved by her words, Ma Mingsheng said: *"You are truly one who can attain the Dao."* He then took her to Mount Qingcheng, where he transmuted yellow earth into gold to demonstrate its truth. They erected an altar, made a blood oath, and on that very day, he bestowed upon her the Divine Elixir of Golden Liquor from the Great Clarity. As he prepared to depart, Changsheng kowtowed, entreating him to linger a while longer. She bowed in farewell, saying: *"From youth, I was raised in luxury, yet I shunned arrogance and embraced humility, disciplining myself as if standing at the edge of an abyss. I could not propagate the Dao nor glorify its virtue, nor spread its wondrous essence—merely stood idle like a hollow vessel, and now old age has come upon me. Thus, I set my heart on life’s covenant and abandoned the world to seek the true. Heaven granted this blessed encounter, and I was fortunate to meet you. For twenty-two years, I have served you, yet my strength has faltered, ever fearful of failure. My sinews grow weak, my efforts meager, and I have repaid none of your kindness. Day and night, my gratitude overflows. Now, reborn by your grace, I receive this sacred formula—this ashen form is granted extended years, like parched grass revived by sweet rain. You have restored breath to the lifeless and opened the eyes and ears of the blind. My debt is beyond words.*

*In the year *gengchen*, I heard that you, Master, along with the Perfected of South Mountain, Lord Hongya, Lord Yuncheng, and the Immortal Maidens of Yingzhou, sat in council to transmit the teachings. There were oaths of silk and pledges of shared sashes, and offerings were made to the Nine Elders of the Immortal Capital and the Nine Black Venerables. Prayers were answered, and the great elixir was to be bestowed. Yet when the rites were performed, it did not succeed. I, your disciple, was present in the hall, weary yet attentive, and heard the immortals recount the origins of their attainment, as well as the former instructions on the alchemical process. Today, you enlighten me anew—should I not mention this? Or is it that your teaching was incomplete, or perhaps you feared I was not yet ready?"*

Ma Mingsheng consoled her, saying: *"It was not incomplete. Your nature delights in the profound and abides in harmony. The numinous officials have observed and approved—there is no need for the oaths of common men."*

Thereupon, Changsheng entered a stone chamber in Mount Wudang to compound the elixir. She first consumed half a dose and did not immediately ascend to heaven. Instead, she transmuted tens of thousands of catties of gold and distributed it to the poor and needy, whether she knew them or not. She traveled throughout the world without her family, yet all her household enjoyed long life. Later, she entrusted her affairs to others and entered Mount Pingdu in Zhongzhou to refine and consume the elixir. On a bright day, she ascended to heaven. Before departing, she composed nine scrolls, recording that immortals of ancient times were too numerous to recount in full. She noted that since the rise of the Han, forty-five lofty scholars had attained transcendence, though only six had reached the thousand-year mark. Twenty-eight had departed through *shijie* (corpse-liberation), while the rest ascended in broad daylight. She also wrote a preface, stating: *"In the first year of *Yanguang* of the Han, I received the essential secrets of the divine elixir north of Xinye Mountain and achieved the Dao, departing the world. Copies are hidden in famous mountains—whoever obtains them shall be ranked among the Perfected, free to come and go. This is the way for the worldly to attain deathlessness. The key lies in the divine elixir. Practices such as circulating *qi*, guiding and stretching, and consuming herbs and plants may yield minor attainments, but they cannot grant eternal transcendence to become a Heavenly Immortal. If you wish to hear the Dao, this is the essential teaching—it comes from accumulated study, not divine intervention. The superior person pursues it with diligence; the foolish laugh and dismiss it as false. Yet those who know the divine elixir shall enjoy enduring vision and eternal life."*

She then inscribed three copies of the elixir scripture on yellow silk and golden tablets, depositing them in Mount Song, Mount Hua, and Mount Huan. One copy on silk was entrusted to her disciples, to be passed down through generations. She left behind three *four-character* poems for the world, which read:

---

*Of my ancestors,*
*They aided the reigns of Tang and Yu.*
*Through the Han, purple seals entwined.*
*Yet I alone loved the Dao,*
*And lived as a common man.*
*My lofty, pure resolve*
*Shunned lords and kings.*
*To live having gained life—*
*What more could I seek?*
*Beyond the azure vault,*
*I ride the floating chariot.*
*The Blue Consort mounts wings,*
*Yet stands as my foe.*
*Fire cannot burn me,*
*Water cannot drench.*
*Roaming the Great Ultimate,*
*What care or sorrow remains?*
*Sporting in the Immortal Capital,*
*I pity the foolish and dull.*
*Life’s passing years*
*Flow like a river.*
*In an instant, all is gone—*
*Dust and earth their due.*
*Racing toward death,*
*Never pausing to rest.*

*My sagely teacher,*
*Embodied the true Dao.*
*Ascending, transforming,*
*With Red Pine and Wang Qiao as kin.*
*Of my fellow students,*
*Twelve in all,*
*We sought the Dao through cold and heat,*
*For twenty years.*
*Many grew weary,*
*Their resolve unsteady.*
*Alas, my companions—*
*Fate lies with Heaven.*
*Heaven does not bestow in vain;*
*The Dao must return to the worthy.*
*Buried in dark earth,*
*When shall they return?*
*O you who come after,*
*Strive with diligence and devotion."*

Do not be swayed by the vulgar currents, nor ensnared by wealth and rank.
Once the divine elixir is perfected,
You shall ascend to the Nine Heavens.
Your lifespan shall equal the Three Luminaries—
How could it be a mere hundred million years?

From the time my hair was bound in youth,
I loved the Dao and its virtue.
Leaving home to follow my teacher,
I wandered east and west, south and north.
I cast aside the Five Classics,
Withdrawing from the world to seek my own path.
For over twenty years,
I dwelled beside sacred mountains.
Cold, I had no time for clothing;
Hungry, I had no leisure to eat.
I dared not think of returning,
Nor dared to rest from my toil.
I served my sagely teacher,
Attending him with joyful countenance.
Though my face was grimed and my feet calloused,
He saw my devotion and took pity.
He transmitted the essential secrets to me—
His grace was profound and unfathomable.
My wife and children gained long life,
All enjoying boundless years.
The yellow and white elixirs were perfected,
Bringing wealth beyond measure.
I commanded spirits and gods,
With jade maidens attending at my side.
I attained deliverance from the world—
All through the power of the divine elixir.

This stele is inscribed at Jingde Abbey on Pingdu Mountain for posterity.

The Jin dynasty’s Ge Hong of Danyang said:
I once heard a proverb: *"If you do not walk at night, you will not know there are night-walkers on the road."*
Those who have not attained immortality—how can they know that in the secluded mountains and forests of the world, there are those who study the Dao and achieve transcendence?
Lord Yin has already consumed the divine medicine. Though he has not yet ascended to heaven, his presence is stern and majestic. When like minds resonate, he naturally seeks out and encounters immortals. Thus, I know that in recent times, the number of such transcendents is not few.
Yet the common folk dismiss this as false. What they themselves have not heard, they declare nonexistent—is this not lamentable?
Even reclusive scholars, who find fulfillment in seclusion, delight in the classics, and shun ostentation, do not flaunt their literary brilliance, nor seek fame, nor cultivate friendships, nor pursue worldly success—even they cannot recognize such truths.
How much less, then, would immortals hasten to make known their deeds to those as ephemeral as morning mushrooms?

Minister Dao Yi said:
Yin Changsheng’s devotion to his teacher was arduous. Though he did not obtain the Dao at first, he never wearied—his sincerity was perfect, beyond the reach of ordinary men.
Of the twelve who studied under Ma Mingsheng at the same time, all grew resentful and left. Only Changsheng’s reverence deepened, and in the end, he alone attained the Dao.
As the *Daodejing* says: *"To learn what others do not learn is to redress the errors of the multitude, aiding the self-so of the myriad things without presuming to act."*
This describes Changsheng.

Wei Boyang,
Wei Boyang was a man of Wu. Born into a noble family, he was by nature drawn to the Daoist arts and refused to enter official service. Living in seclusion to cultivate his nature, none knew his origins—people assumed he merely tended to the people and nurtured himself.
He entered the mountains to concoct the divine elixir, taking three disciples with him. Knowing that two of them were not entirely sincere, once the elixir was complete, he tested it, saying:
*"Though the golden elixir is made, we must first try it. Feed it to a white dog—if the dog can fly, then humans may consume it. If the dog dies, it must not be taken."*
When Boyang had entered the mountains, he had brought a white dog with him. The elixir’s cycles were not yet complete, its fusion imperfect, and the toxic elixir, if consumed, would cause temporary death.
Boyang thus fed the toxic elixir to the white dog, and the dog immediately died. He then asked his disciples:
*"I feared the elixir might not succeed. Now that it is made and the dog has died after consuming it, I worry it may not have the approval of the divine spirits. If we take it, we may suffer the dog’s fate—what should we do?"*
The disciples asked: *"Will you take it, Master?"*
Boyang replied: *"I have turned my back on the world’s paths, left my family, and entered the mountains. If I do not attain the Dao of immortality, I would be ashamed to return. Whether death or life, I shall consume it."*
He then took the elixir, and as soon as it entered his mouth, he died.
The disciples looked at one another and said: *"The purpose of making the elixir was to seek long life. Yet consuming it brings death—what are we to do?"*
One disciple said: *"Our teacher is no ordinary man. If he died after taking the elixir, could there be a deeper meaning?"*
Boyang took the elixir again, and once more, he died. The remaining two disciples said to each other:
*"We made the elixir to seek long life. Now that consuming it brings death, what use is it? If we do not take it, we can still live for decades in the world."*
They refused to consume it and left the mountain together, intending to seek coffins and burial goods for Boyang and the deceased disciple.
After the two had gone, Boyang revived. He placed the elixir he had consumed into the mouths of the disciple and the white dog, and in an instant, both arose. Taking the disciple surnamed Yu and the white dog, he departed. He encountered a woodcutter in the mountains and wrote a letter to his fellow villagers, entrusting it to the two disciples.
When the disciples saw the letter, they were filled with remorse.

Boyang wrote the *Cantong Qi* and its five related texts, totaling two volumes. Though it appears to explain the *Zhouyi*, it actually borrows the hexagrams and images to discuss the intent behind elixir-making.
Another account states: Wei Boyang of the Eastern Han was a native of Shangyu in Kuaiji. Born into a family of officials, he alone refused office, cultivating truth in seclusion and nurturing his will in emptiness. He regarded courtly robes as mere husks, indifferent to worldly glory.
It is unknown from whom he received instruction, but he obtained the *Dragon and Tiger Classic* of the ancients and mastered its profound secrets. He then drew upon the *Zhouyi* to compose the *Cantong Qi* in three chapters. Feeling it had not exhausted the subtleties, he wrote an additional chapter, *Supplementing Omissions*, to further elucidate the mysteries of the elixir texts.
His writings often employ allegory and metaphor, concealing and revealing meaning through varied expressions.
Boyang composed the *Cantong Qi* to show that elixir-making follows the same path as creation itself, and thus he used the images of the *Yi* to discuss it. The work has circulated in the world, and later commentators number several, but only Peng Xiao of the True Unity School provided the most accurate exegesis. After achieving the elixir and ascending as an immortal, his book fortunately survived.

Minister Dao Yi said:
The *Daodejing* states: *"The Dao is the mystery of the myriad things, the treasure of the good."*
Wei Boyang was a good man. He did not keep this treasure for himself but shared it with the world—this is the height of goodness.
Since Guangchengzi revealed the secrets of the Three Elixirs and Nine Tripods to illuminate the supreme Dao, through the eras of the Five Emperors and the Xia dynasty, though immortals consumed the elixir and transmitted its teachings, the profound resonance of the elixir’s Way nearly faded into silence.

By the Yin and Zhou dynasties, the Supreme One once more manifested in the world, and the Way was revived. During the Former Han, various immortals subtly embedded its teachings in songs and poems, yet the Way remained not fully expounded. Then came Boyang, who borrowed the principles of the *Yijing* to compose the *Cantong qi*, exhaustively revealing the subtleties of the supreme Way. He established a model for the world, one that could be transmitted endlessly—thus did the treasure of the good man become known. From this, its teachings flourished in the Han and Jin, thrived in the Sui and Tang, and have endured to this day. Is this not the merit of Boyang?

Zhou Yishan
The Purple Yang Perfected, surnamed Zhou, named Yishan, styled Jitong, was a native of Ruyin. A seventh-generation descendant of the Han Chancellor Bo, his family, renowned for its noble lineage, had long held high office. His grandfather Xuan served as Inspector of Qingzhou in the first year of Emperor Zhaodi’s Yuanfeng reign. His father, Mi, was Magistrate of Fanyang, and it was then that the young master was born. Later, his father accumulated ranks and promotions, rising to become Inspector of Chenliu. At sixteen, the young master followed his father to the prefecture, where he first studied the *Classic of Filial Piety*, the *Analects*, and the *Yijing*. Grave and composed, he spoke little, his joy or anger never showing on his face. He favored solitude, sitting in quiet places, and formed no attachments to fame or favor. Yet his mind was keen and meticulous, and whatever he contemplated, he brought to fruition.

Each day, after the first light of dawn but before sunrise, he would stand facing east, rinse his mouth, swallow his saliva, and circulate his *qi* a hundred times, then bow twice toward the sun. He maintained this practice for years, until his father, finding it strange, asked what he was doing. The young master knelt and replied: *"Yishan delights in the radiance of the sun’s long light, and so I bow to it."*

On the first day of each lunar month, he would wander through markets, alleys, and humble lanes, where upon seeing the destitute and starving, he would remove his clothes to clothe them and provide food. Often he climbed famous mountains, sighing with sorrow.

At times, he would enter a stone chamber, where he would laugh joyfully in solitude. Renowned scholars of Chenliu, hearing of his profound virtue and serene, refined nature, all came to visit him, but he would always claim illness and refuse to meet with guests. Cai Xian, the Han Attendant Gentleman and a distinguished scholar of Chenliu who had some understanding of the Dao, also heard of his virtuous conduct and repeatedly sought him out. Each time, he feigned illness to avoid seeing him, until his father grew deeply perplexed and angrily rebuked him, pressing him to go out and meet the visitor. With no choice, he finally emerged to greet Cai Xian. Cai launched into an expansive discourse on pure conversation, discussing the Dao of immortals and the arts of transformation. Yet the young master remained silent, inwardly withdrawn, his spirit empty and still, merely nodding in response—never uttering a word.

That year, a severe drought struck, and a *dou* of rice cost a thousand coins. Starving people filled the roads, reduced to eating wild grasses. He then exhausted his wealth and emptied his household to relieve their suffering, performing these acts of kindness in secret so that no one knew it was his compassion at work. He treated all beings as if they were newborn infants—such was the depth of his accumulated virtue and benevolence.

Later, Huang Tai of Chenliu came to him and said: *"I have heard of your devotion to the Dao, your hidden virtues flowing like a current, and your subtle, wondrous thoughts that have truly moved me. That is why I have come to see you. I am Xu Lin, styled Zixuan, an immortal of Mount Song. Originally from Wei, I was born in the final years of Duke Ling. From youth, I loved the Dao and studied under Master Cen, who taught me arts for refining the body and dispelling calamities. Later, I met Master Qiu, who instructed me in the methods of circulating *qi*, returning the spirit, and guarding the soul. I practiced these diligently, and the benefits were profound. You, in your youth, already know how to return the yang, preserve your essence and marrow, and practice guiding and gathering *qi*, swallowing sunlight and drinking dew—so you no longer require the inner arts of yin elixirs or embryonic nourishment. However, the Three Worms remain unharmed, and the Three Corpses are not yet dead, which is why your practice of guiding *qi* and circulating breath has not yet attained its principle. You should first take refined pills to kill the grain worms. These worms have three names: the first is Green Ancient, the second is White Maiden, and the third is Blood Corpse—they are called the Three Worms. When they reside within, they cause restlessness, fullness in the heart, a clouded will, and unstable thoughts. When you miss a meal, you feel hunger; sorrow and melancholy arise, and your essence and spirit fail to settle—all due to the disruption caused by irregular eating. Even if you abstain from grains, your body will feel heavy and sluggish, your mind dull and oppressed, your dreams unreal, your thoughts confused and inverted, and worldly impurities will not be purged—all because these worms stir within and agitate the five viscera. The formula uses five *liang* of aconite, seven *sheng* of hemp seeds, six *liang* of rehmannia, seven *liang* of *mu* (cinnamon or another wood), a seven-inch segment of large evodia root, four *liang* of cassia, and five *liang* of cloud fungus—seven ingredients in total. First, boil calamus root to make a thick broth, then strain it to clarity. Heat one and a half *dou* of thick broth, and steep the seven herbs in it—you may either chop them coarsely or leave them whole. After three days, remove and dry them in the sun. Then steep them again in the same broth for another three days, dry them once more, and repeat until the broth is exhausted. Grind the dried herbs in an iron mortar until they become a fine powder. Mix with white honey to form pills. At dawn, facing east, begin by taking two pills the size of small beans, gradually increasing by one pill until you reach ten or more. This will relieve abdominal tension, upward counterflow of *qi*, and blockages in the chest, while nourishing the skin, lightening the body, and imparting a radiant glow. After finishing one course, the worms will die, and once the worms are dead, the Three Corpses will wither and naturally fall away. You may prepare this remedy multiple times without limit. Afterward, combine the Four Guardian Pills, adding one *liang* each of azurite and Solomon’s seal to complete the grain-abstention process. If your practice of guiding *qi* and circulating breath still does not attain its principle, you may first consume various herbs such as *ju sheng*, *fu ling*, *mu* (wood), cassia, asparagus, coptis, rehmannia, rhubarb, peach kernels, and their skins—choose as you see fit. Though these medicines may grant you strength, without the Dao of the Nine-Turned Divine Elixir and Golden Liquid, you cannot become a flying immortal—you may only extend your years and prolong your life. Follow these steps in order, and after five years of consuming the wood medicine, your body will emanate a luminous glow, and you will be able to see clearly within, perceiving your five viscera. Then, seek out an immortal to request the essential techniques of flying transcendence. The immortal said: 'There are many kinds of medicines and many ranks of immortals. Some ride clouds and drive dragons, ascending to heaven in broad daylight, befriending the Perfected of the Great Ultimate and becoming lords of the immortal palaces—equal in rank to the True Duke, the Fixed Prime Duke, the Great Life Duke, the Central Yellow Grand Master, the Nine Qi Elder, and the Duke of the Immortal Capital. These are the highest immortals. Others become immortal ministers or great masters, ranking just below the highest immortals. They wander the Five Peaks or ascend to the Great Clarity, commanding ghosts and spirits—these are the middle immortals. Some are enfeoffed with a mountain and govern ghosts and spirits; others roam the lesser realms, gathering in the palaces of Pure Emptiness—these are the next rank of middle immortals. Those who eat grains yet do not die, casting no shadow at noon, are the lower immortals. Others undergo corpse liberation in daylight, passing through the Great Yin before attaining immortality—these are the next rank of lower immortals. I received the secret essentials of Master Juan, and I am but a middle immortal. Your name is recorded in the Golden Register, and you are destined to become a Perfected One. My Dao is not what a Perfected One like you should study. Today, I transmit to you the method of guarding the Three Ones, two hundred texts from the Mysterious Lesser Realm, stone fungi, red stalks, and several divine mushrooms for you to consume. My teachings are now complete, and you may seek a master farther afield.'*

The young master bowed twice to receive the instructions. Afterward, he consumed divine mushrooms for five years, gaining the ability to see a thousand *li* away and travel five hundred *li* in a day. He then wandered through famous mountains in search of immortals. Hearing that Master Le of Mount Meng could recite the *Dragon’s Pride Scripture*, he went to seek him out. There, he met Master Yanmen, who transmitted to him the *Dragon’s Pride Scripture* and the *Inner Writings of the Three Sovereigns*. Ascending Mount Wangwu, he encountered Master Zhao Tuo, who bestowed upon him sixteen charts of divine mushrooms and the secret talismans of the Five Phases.

Then he encountered Master Huang, who transmitted to him the *Divine Prescriptions of the Yellow Simplicity*, along with forty-four formulas of the *Five Emperors and Six Jia Spirit-Flight Writings of the Left and Right*. Ascending Mount Panzhong, he met Lord Shangwei, who bestowed upon him the *Transmission of the Great Simplicity*, the *Record of Left Yi and the Chaotic East*, and the *Statutes of Right Yu and the Subduing Killings*. Climbing Mount Songgao, he came upon the Central Yellow Venerable Lord, who was convening with immortals within the Cavern Gate of the Great Chamber. The young master prostrated himself and bowed, entreating for the Way of long life and deliverance from the world.

The Yellow Venerable Lord asked, “Have you beheld the White Prime Lord within your Chamber of the Grotto?”

The young master replied, “Indeed, I have beheld the White Prime Lord within the Chamber of the Grotto.”

The Yellow Venerable Lord said, “Your Dao is not yet sufficient, for you have not seen the Peerless Lord. Continue your wanderings and receive the essential formulas; then I shall transmit to you the scriptures of the Supreme Perfection.”

“To behold the White Prime Lord is the affair of a lesser immortal, granting a lifespan of three thousand years. To behold the Peerless Lord is to become a true one, granting a lifespan of ten thousand years.”

The young master bowed twice to receive the teachings and withdrew. He then roamed through the renowned mountains and great marshes of the world. Westward, he ascended White Void Mountain, where he met Master Bo of Shayeh and received the *Supreme Scripture of the Great Clarity*. Climbing Mount Emei, he entered the Golden Treasury of the Empty Grotto and encountered Master Ning, who transmitted to him the *Hidden Writings of the Great Elixir* and the *Ten Formulas of the Eight Endowments*. Ascending Mount Min, he met Master Yin and received the *Nine Crimson Mottled Talismans*. Climbing Mount Qi, he encountered Zang Yanfu and was given the *Essential Formulas of the Melancholy and Joyful Plain Songs*. Ascending Mount Liang, he met Lord Cheng of Huainan and received the *Three Charts of the Celestial Pass*. Climbing Oxhead Mountain, he encountered Zhang Zifang and was bestowed the *Authentic Scripture of the Great Clarity*. Ascending Mount Jiuyi, he met Li Boyang and received the *Mysterious Scripture of the Li Clan*. Climbing Mount Zhong, he encountered Master Gaoqiu and was given twenty-seven *Divine Elixir Prescriptions*. Ascending Mount Heming, he met Lord Yang’an and received the *Scripture of the Golden Liquid Elixir* and the *Divine Elixir of the Nine Tripods*. Climbing Mount Meng, he encountered Master Azure Essence and was transmitted the *Transmission of the Yellow Simplicity*. Descending into the grotto chamber of the Yi River at Mount Luhun, he met Li Zi’er and received the *Eight Arts of the Hidden Earth*. Ascending Mount Rong, he encountered Zhao Boxuan and was given the *Art of the Twenty-Seven Plain Women*. Climbing Mount Yangluo, he met the Young Yang Lord and received the *Purple Writings of the Azure Essentials*. Ascending Mount Huo, he encountered the Lord of Destiny and was bestowed the *Blue Charts of Life*, the *Registers of the Supreme Sovereign’s People*. Climbing Mount Wushu, he met Master Mo Di and received the *Inner Vision Charts of the Purple Radiance and Blazing Light*. Ascending Mount Yaoming, he encountered the Divine Youth Who Awaits the Night on Behalf of the Great Emperor and was given the *Scripture of the Golden Root*. Climbing Mount Weiyu, he met Sima Jizhu and received the *Stone Essence and Golden Light Concealing Radiance Transforming Form*. Ascending Mount Dadu, he encountered Liu Zixian and was transmitted the *Sevenfold Divine Arts of Transformation*. Climbing the Towering Tree of Duguan, he met Gu Xizi and received the *Art of the Yellow Qi*, the *Techniques of the Great Void*, and the *Essentials of the Three Paths of Solar Essence*. Ascending Mount Tongbai, he met Wang Qiao and was given the *Plain Memorials of the Cinnabar Talismans*. Climbing Mount Taihua, he encountered Master Red Pine of the Southern Marchmount and received the *Authentic Writings of the Upper Prime*. Ascending Mount Taiming, he met the Nine Elder Immortals of the Divine Metropolis and was bestowed the *Four Authentic Arts of the Yellow Water and Moonlight*. Climbing Mount Heli, he met the August Personage and received the *Eight Simplicities Authentic Scripture* and the *Hidden Writings of the Supreme*. Ascending Mount Jing, he encountered Master Wanbi of the Yellow Terrace and was given the *Central Scripture of the Nine Perfections*. Climbing Mount Xuanlongyu, he met ten Jade Lads and the Nine Qi Venerable, who transmitted to him the *Art of the White Feather and Purple Canopy, Clad in the Yellow Water and Moonlight*.

Arriving at the Mulberry Grove, he ascended Mount Fuguang and encountered the Young Lord of Azure Perfection, who bestowed upon him the *Secret Characters of the Golden Writ*. Journeying south to the Vermilion Fire, he climbed Mount Danling and met Gong Zhongyang, who transmitted the *Authentic Records of the Immortal Taboos*. Traveling west, he ascended the Hollow Mountain and beheld the Peerless Lord. Gazing westward into the Chamber of the Grotto, he saw the Peerless Lord seated to the left, the White Prime Lord to the right, and the Yellow Venerable Lord in their midst.

The Peerless Lord wore a robe of golden essence and vermilion-jade-green silk, its radiance like the dawn’s rosy clouds, its brilliance illuminating the heavens. He bore the *Luminous Chapters of the Supreme Numinous Qi*, wielded the *Nine Emperors’ Exorcising Wands*, and wore the *Azure-Topped Purple-Spirit Crown*—he was the Ancestral Father of the Supreme Elixir, the Numinous Upper Prime, and the Crimson Child. To his left, the qi of the Azure Palace connected, crowning the myriad spirits. He had existed before heaven and earth, born from the empty void.

The White Prime Lord wore a layered robe of cinnabar-jade brocade and cloud gauze, its white light inwardly vermilion, its radiance piercing the heavens, its splendor reflecting the spirits, its dark and yellow hues penetrating the void. He bore the *Luminous Chapters of the Supreme Numinous Essence*, wielded the *Mysterious Prime’s Demon-Subduing Wands*, and wore the *Black Dragon-Summoning Crown*—he was the Father of the Upper Prime Crimson Child of the Jade Chamber and Cloud Court, the Lord of the Luminous Azure Chamber who governs life at dawn.

The Central Yellow Venerable Lord was the aged master of the Four Perfected Kings of the Supreme Ultimate. Above, he oversaw the Nine Heavens; in the middle, he roamed Kunlun. The Yellow Gate stood without, the Purple Portal within. Below, he entered the Chamber of the Grotto with the two lords, its circumference three inches, all majesty therein complete.

“Only through profound contemplation of the spirits may one become a perfected person. To behold the White Prime Lord is to become a lesser perfected one, with a lifespan of three thousand years. To behold the Peerless Lord is to become a middle perfected one, with a lifespan of ten thousand years. To behold the Yellow Venerable Lord is to rival heaven, ascending as a perfected person and inscribing one’s name upon the Golden Terrace.”

Having arrived, the young master prostrated himself and bowed, entreating for the supreme essential formulas. The Yellow Venerable Lord said, “Turn your gaze back to your Chamber of the Grotto.”

The young master then closed his eyes and inwardly beheld. After a long while, he indeed saw within the Chamber of the Grotto two divine persons—the Peerless Lord and the White Prime Lord—clad as they had been on the Hollow Mountain.

The Yellow Venerable Lord smiled and said, “How subtle and profound! The precision of your intent and thought is the Way of ascending to heaven in broad daylight. Return to Mount Chang and I shall transmit to you the Way of the Supreme Perfection.”

The young master then returned to the stone chamber of Mount Chang, where he fasted and meditated upon the Dao. After accumulating over ninety years more, the White Prime Lord, the Peerless Lord, and the Yellow Venerable Lord dispatched their attendants to transmit to him the *Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Great Grotto Authentic Scripture*. Twenty-one Jade Lads and twenty-one Jade Maidens, all serving the perfected, burned incense and practiced day and night.

After eleven more years, he ascended to heaven in broad daylight, riding clouds and driving dragons, to reach the Grand Tenuity Palace, where he received the scriptures and was named the Perfected One of Purple Yang. He bore the Yellow Pennant’s staff, the Eight Might’s scepter, a belt hung with flowing-gold bells, and wore robes of spontaneity. He consumed the sweet dew of jade nectar and drank the golden liquid’s broth. He governed the Bronze City of Golden Court on Mount Geyan—this was the Purple Yang Palace. Among the eight Perfected Ones of Purple Yang, he stood at their right. Thrice daily he ascended Kunlun, and each dawn he attended the Lord Emperor of Grand Tenuity. Mount Panzhong became his Purple Yang detached palace, known as the Hidden Palace of Dongting. Within Mount Panzhong’s caverns, a hidden passage led to the Clear Void Lesser Heaven of Wangwu, which also secretly connected to the Gate Wind.

Minister Dao Yi said: Zhou Yishan feigned illness to nurture obscurity, accumulating virtue and piling up benevolence. From beginning to end, his sincerity remained unbroken. He broadly studied the myriad wonders and became a true erudite of divine transcendence. Witnessing the Han Attendant-in-Ordinary Cai Xian and the eminent scholar of Chenliu visit him, Xian expounded at length on pure discourse, discussing the Dao of divine transcendents and the affairs of transformation. Yet Yishan remained inwardly still, gathering his spirit in emptiness and tranquility. He nodded in harmony but did not reply.

The *Scripture of Dao and Virtue* states: “Trustworthy words are not embellished; embellished words are not trustworthy. The good do not dispute; the disputatious are not good. The knowing are not broadly learned; the broadly learned do not know.” Such was Yishan’s intent.

The Perfected One of Clear Void, Lord Wang, named Bao, styled Zideng, was a native of Xiangping in Fanyang and a seventh-generation descendant of the Marquis of Anguo. He was born on the twenty-seventh day of the ninth month in the third year of Jianzhao during the reign of Emperor Yuan of Han. His family’s great foundation and enterprise had long been recorded among the eminent and prosperous.

His father, whose personal name was Kai, was renowned for his virtuous conduct and noble character, celebrated throughout the province. He was nominated as a *maocai* (Exemplary Talent), appointed *Yilang* (Discussion Gentleman), and successively promoted to *Zhonglei Dafu* (Grandee of the Central Rampart), *Tai Shou* (Grand Administrator) of Shangdang, *Huangmen Shilang* (Gentleman of the Yellow Gate), *Shizhong* (Palace Attendant), *Zuo Jiangjun* (General of the Left), and *Tai Shou* of Yamen. Kai maintained an upright demeanor, offering forthright counsel and forthright remonstrance. His governance was marked by sincerity and directness, fulfilling his duties with diligence, ruling through ritual, and lightening punishments and taxes—commanding respect without sternness. The Son of Heaven esteemed him, promoting him to *Dian Shang San Lao* (One of the Three Elders of the Palace), where he served as an honored guest to the Crown Prince, lecturing on the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, the *Book of Documents*, the *Analects*, the *Rites*, and the *Book of Changes*. His magnanimity and benevolence, his patient and skillful instruction, brought him renown that resounded beyond the imperial gardens, his fame spreading throughout the capital and the land. One quiet night, the Lord was moved by profound reflection and sighed in sorrow: “The world is enveloped in the dust of mundane strife, where men rush after gain and loss, where profit and harm assail one another—this is like the fledgling crane gazing upon the aging swallow.” Resolving to leave his family, he entered Mount Hua, where he remained for nine years.

One night at midnight, he suddenly heard the sounds of pipes, drums, and the clamor of men and horses rising from the forest marshes. Gradually, the noise drew nearer. Looking up, he beheld a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders descending through the empty sky. Divine beings rode upon three clouds of pure white, bearing tiger tallies in hand, their crimson seals opening the way. They grasped standards and banners, their brocade flags veiling the void as the procession cast shifting shadows in the pale dawn. One of the divine beings halted his carriage and spoke: “I am the True Man of the Supreme Ultimate, Xi Liang Ziwen of the Western Beam. Hearing of your devotion to the Dao and your arduous toil in the mountains and forests, though you have yet to grasp the essential truths, I pity your sincerity. Your earnest pursuit of immortality is indeed most commendable.”

The Lord hastened to the wheels of the divine carriage, prostrating himself and striking his head upon the ground as he spoke: “I, Bao, am but a mortal, dull-witted and base, yet from youth I have cherished the Way of life, though I know nothing of its hidden secrets.” The True Man replied: “To study the Dao without a master is to lack the thread that unravels the knot. I, the True Man of the Supreme Ultimate, preside over the affairs of divine transcendents, overseeing the examination and selection of scholars, and recommending the upright. Your name has been recorded in the Golden Writ of the Upper Clarity of the Eastern Flower, enrolled among the ranks of the Pure Void. You shall ascend to the Lesser Existence and inevitably take charge of the treasuries of sacred texts, assuming the office of Heavenly King. Simply focus your mind on the Four Effulgences, diligently cultivate the supreme practice, and the Dao will naturally be achieved.”

Later, while secluded in the Yangluo Mountains, he was visited by the Lady of the Southern Culmen and the True Man of the Western City, who bestowed upon him the *Precious Writ of the Most High*, the *Hidden Writ of the Eight Simplicities*, the *Perfect Scripture of the Great Cavern*, the *Numinous Writ*, the *Eightfold Dao of the Purple Crossing*, the *Flame-Light Stone Essence*, the *Jade Steed of the Divine Tiger*, and the *Feathered Mystery of the Lofty Transcendent*—thirty-one scrolls in all. Following the prescribed rites, he swore an oath and received them. The True Man then escorted him to the Dark Continent, arriving in an instant.

The four sides were bound by vast seas, their towering waves suspended a thousand *zhang* high. Upon the continent stood palaces and towers, jasper chambers and jade halls—beyond all reckoning. The True Man of the Western City said, “This is the capital of the immortals’ realm, where the Most High Elder dwells.”

He then led the disciple into the Palace of Purple Cassia, where he beheld the Elder clad in a feathered robe of flowing rosy clouds, crowned with a lotus coronet, a belt of divine radiance at his waist, and a fire-bell in hand. Hundreds of maidens attended him, while dragons and tigers guarded the steps. The Most High Elder and the True Man of the Western City exchanged courtesies, then clasped hands and sat together, the disciple standing at their side.

The Most High Elder said, “Is this not the one called Wang Zideng? He has met with a worthy teacher in his pursuit of the Dao and is on the verge of attaining it.” The True Man of the Western City smiled and ordered the disciple to bow. After the obeisance, the Most High Elder had him sit facing north. The Elder then prepared a feast, and in an instant, the meal was set. A thousand kinds of numinous delicacies were arrayed, the cinnabar wine brimming, sandalwood smoke curling in fragrant coils, and incense of dark mystery wafting through the air. The grand music of the *Jun Tian* resounded as golden chimes struck the seven luminaries, the melodies of Mount Kongtong rising to pierce the luminous heavens.

Then dragons soared upon cloud-capped cliffs, and phoenixes cried out in flight. Mountains trembled as leviathans surged through the waves, and billows crashed in towering swells. Flowers of light bloomed in the void, and winds stirred across the boundless expanse. The Nine Perfected sang sacred hymns, their refined chants echoing through the emptiness; jade maidens joined in harmony as the Western Consorts swayed in dance.

Thereupon, the immortals swept their sleeves in unison, and the myriad spirits advanced in procession. Feathered youths bore the ritual staffs, and auspicious clouds wove brocade patterns in the sky. The Most High Elder then convened twenty-nine Perfected Ones, all Great Perfected Lords of the Dark Continent. The first among them, who styled himself the Lord of the Dao of Immortals, pointed to the disciple and said to the True Man of the Western City, “Behold this one—his eyes are limpid and distant, his spirit serene, his form composed. The radiance of the Six Effulgences shines forth from him. He is among the finest of the Perfected, a worthy prince of the Lesser Existence.”

The True Man of the Western City replied, “It is said that nature arises from Heaven, while destiny is shaped by man.”

Then the Lord of the Dao of Immortals commanded the attendants Fan Yunhua, Zhao Junzhu, and Wang Baotai to open the jasper coffer, unfurl the green scrolls, and present the *Hidden Writ of the Supreme Clarity* and the *Two Scrolls of the Dragon-Script Eightfold Numinous Canon*. They also bestowed upon him two *sheng* of *Cloud Azure Yang Water* and *Morning-Flying Cinnabar Elixir*. The disciple bowed and consumed them.

The Perfected Ones then escorted him back to the Western City. After nine years, his Dao was perfected, and he was granted a chariot of flying terraces. He journeyed east, crossing the *Starry Dawn* and the *Azure Sea*, ascending Mount Guang Sang to enter the *Court of First Light*, where he paid homage to the Great Emperor Lord. Kneeling twice in reverence, he received from the Emperor the *Nine-Script Dragon Radiance of the Purple Phoenix and Vermilion Writ* and the *Eightfold Dao Jade Record of the Supreme Clarity*.

Next, he traveled south, crossing the *Bo Sea* and the *Cinnabar Sea*, ascending Mount Chang Li to pay homage to the Lady of the Southern Culmen, the *Purple Prime*, and the *Lord of the Canopy of Flowers*. They bestowed upon him the *Five-Cloud Night-Glowing Jade Frost*.

Then he journeyed west, crossing the *Yuqiu* and the vast *Sea of Sunken Feathers* at the *Ford of the Gourd*, ascending Mount Li Nong to pay homage to the Lady of the Purple Canopy of Dawn and the *Three August Lords of the Radiant Perfection*. They granted him the *Jade Dao of Green Script* and the *Hidden Writ of the Refulgent Supreme Perfected*.

Next, he traveled north, crossing the *Xuan Sea of Carved Gentleness* and fording the *Upper River of the Gourd* at the *Ford of the Bottle Gourd*, ascending Mount Guang Ye to pay homage to the *Supreme Jade Lord of the Great Dao of the Void*. There, he encountered the Lord as he set forth on his journey, driving the chariot of the sun and moon’s dawn, riding the radiance of the *Purple Origin*, enveloped in clouds of yellow essence, resplendent with the effulgence of the Eight Effulgences. Countless flying immortals accompanied him, beyond all numbering.

The disciple bowed twice by the roadside, then proceeded to pay homage to the *Jade Dawn Emperor of the Supreme Clarity* and the *Six Subtle Lords of the Mysterious Clarity*. The two Lords bestowed upon him the *Precious Writ of the Soaring Empyrean and the Absolute Mystery*, the *Gold Chapters*, the *Hidden Writ of the Great Ultimate*, the *Dragon-Luminous Precious Pearl*, and the *Crimson Harmony Cloud Mushroom*. He bowed and consumed them, whereupon his body turned golden, a halo of radiance encircling his neck, the Seven Luminaries scattering blossoms that shimmered upon his form.

He then withdrew to wander the wilds of *Yue Feng* and the palaces of *Xuan Pu*, where he paid homage to the *Jade Emperor of the Central Augustness* and received the *Jade Canon of Dissolving Form, Vanishing, and Flowing Radiance*.

Next, he crossed the *Yu* and *Jue* rivers, fording the *Weak River* to the west, arriving at *Turtle Terrace* to pay homage to the *Nine Numinous Supreme Perfected Lady of the Supreme Clarity*. Afterward, he purified himself in retreat for three months and received the *Three-Flowered Precious Radiance of the Jasper Writ*, the *Jade Record of Numinous Splendor*, and the *Seven Dawns of the Plain Scripture*.

He then purified himself in retreat for another three years, floated upon the *Vast Sweat River*, and ascended Mount Bai Kong Yu. The mountain spanned thirty thousand *li* in circumference, and he wandered its expanse. The following day, he hastened to the *Jasper Tower of the Purple Clarity and Grand Simplicity*, the domain of the *Three Primordials of the Grand Simplicity, the Supreme Lord of the Dao*. There, within the *Palace of Cinnabar Spirit and White Jade*, resplendent with flying radiance and absolute brilliance, purple auroras cascaded in luminous streams, and the seven lights intertwined, weaving above the clouded eaves. The wondrous hues of dark and yellow defied all description.

Countless jade lads and maidens, along with Perfected attendants, stood in service. The disciple knelt twice in reverence before the jasper tower. After some time, the *Three Primordials of the Grand Simplicity, the Supreme Lord of the Dao*, sent forth the embroidered-robed messenger Xi Linzao to bestow upon him the *Golden Perfection and Jade Radiance of Flowing Gold Fire-Bells* and the *Seven Primordials of the Vast and Eight Effulgences of Soaring Auroras*.

The Lord also dispatched the *Left Lady of Pure Perfection*, Guo Linggai, and the *Right Jade Maiden of the Yang*, Zhong Feiji, to present him with the *Divine Talisman and Jade Seal*, appointing him as the *Perfected of the Grand Simplicity and Pure Void*, the *Heavenly King of the Lesser Existence*, the *Right Protector and Supreme Duke of the Three Primordials and Four Offices*, charged with governing the *Grotto-Heaven of Mount Wangwu*.

He was granted three hundred jade lads and maidens each, tasked with overseeing the *Jade Chapters of the Supreme Clarity*, the *Precious Mysteries of the Grand Simplicity and the Great Ultimate*, the *Nine Heavens’ Numinous Writ of the Supreme Grade*, the *Secret Records of the Six Harmonies*, and the *Wondrous Canons of Mountains and Seas*. He was also entrusted with the oversight of the *Three Treasures of Luminous Clarity* within the grotto, permitted to ride the chariot of tigers and the carriage of dragons, with a golden canopy and jasper wheels, and the *Flying Chariot of the Eight Effulgences*, to travel in and out of the *Supreme Clarity*, attend to affairs in the *Grand Simplicity*, and repose in the *Great Ultimate*.

**Mei Fu**
Mei Fu, styled Zizhen, was a native of Shouchun in Jiujiang.

In his youth, Mei Fu studied in Chang’an, mastering the *Book of Documents*, *Guliang Commentary*, and *Spring and Autumn Annals*. He served as a scholar in his commandery and was later appointed as the magistrate of Nanchang. During the reign of Emperor Cheng of Han, the emperor entrusted power to the Grand General Wang Feng, who monopolized authority. The Metropolitan Prefect of the Capital, San Zhang, had long been loyal and forthright, openly criticizing Wang Feng and was executed by him. The Wang clan grew increasingly powerful, and omens of disaster frequently appeared, yet none among the officials dared to speak truthfully. Mei Fu again submitted a memorial sharply criticizing the Wang clan, but the emperor did not heed it. Moreover, as Emperor Cheng had long been without an heir, Mei Fu proposed establishing the Three Sequences and enfeoffing Confucius’ descendants as the successors of Yin, submitting another memorial—yet it, too, went unheeded.

At that time, Mei Fu lived at home, devoting himself to reading and cultivating his nature. By the *Yuanshi* era of Emperor Ping, Wang Mang had seized power. One morning, Mei Fu abandoned his wife and children, left Jiujiang, and became a gatekeeper in the market of Wu, as recorded in the *Former Han History*. Daoist texts state that Mei Fu attained the Dao and ascended as an immortal.

The *Yuzhang Provincial Gazetteer* records: Mei Ridge lies in the Western Mountains, towering and precipitous. A winding path like a sheep’s intestines ascends five *li* to its summit. At the mountain’s base stands the Plum Immortal Temple, now called the Yangling Temple. Above the temple is the Plum Immortal Altar, where, according to tradition, Mei Zizhen resigned his post as Nanchang magistrate to study the Dao. Below Mei Ridge, the White Stone Spring emerges.

It is also said that the Ink Pool lies within the administrative precinct of Nanchang County. The site was once the former residence of Mei Fu, the Han-era magistrate of Nanchang, and was later established as a temple. The waters and bamboo there are secluded and lush. When the Jin-dynasty calligrapher Wang Xizhi governed Linchuan Commandery, he would pass by daily, lingering long and unable to depart, hence its name, the Ink Pool. The Song poet Xie Lingyun also resided there for a year, composing his *Hidden Explanations on the Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue* along with a commentary. During the *Zhenguan* era of Emperor Taizong of Tang, it was renamed the Taiyi Temple, where the Celestial Master Wan was ceremonially received to reside. In the second year of the *Longshuo* era of Emperor Gaozong, an offering ritual was held, and at night, clouds descended upon the hall, dispersing by dawn. On the altar appeared the auspicious sign of immortal lamps. During the *Kaiyuan* era of Emperor Xuanzong, it was renamed the Kaiyuan Temple, with the emperor himself inscribing the plaque. In the second year of the *Chongning* era of Emperor Huizong of Song, it was renamed the Chongning Wanshou Temple, and later the Tianning Temple.

The *Records of the Ten Circuits and Four Barbarians* state: Mei Fu’s Pool was where Mei Fu planted lotuses. He sighed, “Life is my torment, the body my shackles, form my humiliation, and wife my poison.” He then abandoned his wife and entered Hongya Mountain. Could this Ink Pool be the same? Elsewhere, such as the Plum Immortal Temple on Plum Mountain in Fuzhou, the Plum Immortal Temple in Fengcheng County of Longxing Prefecture—where an immortal altar and cinnabar well remain—the Jade Bamboo Mountain’s Chengtian Palace in Xingan County of Linjiang Prefecture, the Plum Mound Immortal Residence and Plum Immortal Temple in Xinchang County of Ruizhou, all mark places where Mei Fu traveled to cultivate the Dao.

The *Veritable Records of Plum Immortal Affairs* recount: Seeking a master and yearning for the Dao, Mei Fu visited the Ya Dang Mountains, journeyed through southern Min, and entered Zhiti Mountain. He then entered Xianxia Mountain, which lies east of Mount Wuyi. There, he built a hut on the cliffs and dwelled for years until he encountered the Immortal Lord of Kongtong, who transmitted to him the methods of inner and outer alchemy. He then proceeded to Yinglong Mountain but failed to achieve refinement. Next, he entered Maozhu Cave and Yanxian Mountain, then traveled to Yuhua Mountain, followed by Wushi Mountain. Upon reaching the western ridge of Jian River, he again met the Immortal Lord of Kongtong, who descended and said, “Your destined path lies on Flying Swan Mountain.” Mei Fu then went to Flying Swan Mountain, built a hut, and cultivated for a thousand days. His work complete, his spirit roamed beyond his body, and the radiance of his elixir illuminated the heavens. After consuming the cinnabar, Mei Fu prepared to depart and returned to Jiujiang. There, he beheld auspicious light piercing the sun and purple mist floating in the sky, while celestial music resounded from the clouds. Golden lads bore the imperial tally, jade maidens held banners, warriors controlled the phoenix chariot, and immortal attendants carried the *Shao* music. Mei Fu bowed to the decree, expressed his gratitude, and ascended on a green *luan* bird. Thereafter, Flying Swan Mountain was called Plum Immortal Mountain.

In the fifth year of the *Yuanfeng* era of Emperor Shenzong of Song, an imperial edict proclaimed: “In the time of the Han, Mei Fu, though isolated and distant, boldly spoke on the empire’s affairs—how noble was his ambition! In his later years, he lived at home, reading and cultivating his nature, ultimately transcending the world and ascending as an immortal, as tradition holds. Today, west of the Great River, his temple and image remain, and prayers there are always answered, bringing blessings to our people.”

The authorities reported this to the throne, and thus bestowed upon him this illustrious title, that his luminous spirit might not fade. In gratitude for Our grace, he is hereby specially enfeoffed as Perfected One of Shouchun.

In the second year of the *Shaoxing* era of Emperor Gaozong, in the intercalary fourth month, an imperial edict proclaimed: “When We formerly journeyed through the southern lands, We took Yuzhang as the eastern court of the Empress Dowager. Leading the palace ladies, We traveled by boat, braving the perils of wind and wave. Wherever We passed, protection was surely granted. Now We bestow this grace in recompense for the divine favor received. At the Immortal Ascension Altar of Mei Fu on the north bank of the Great River in Fengcheng County, Hongzhou, the Perfected One of Shouchun, though his forthright remonstrance went unheeded, left behind a lofty name unblemished. Moved by the Han court’s lack of discipline, he departed for the marketplace of Wu and never returned. Having already honored his temple with a title, We now further adorn it with a noble designation, that the fresh grace bestowed may be but slightly extended. Let this extraordinary favor console his lifelong aspirations. He is hereby specially enfeoffed as Perfected One of Reclusive Service in Shouchun.”

Minister Dao Yi states: “The *Daodejing* says: ‘Those who would take the world and act upon it, I see they will not succeed.’ This is like Tang and Wu, who revolutionized the mandate, aligning with Heaven and responding to the people. It also says: ‘The world is a sacred vessel; it cannot be acted upon. Those who act upon it ruin it.’ This is like Wang Mang of the Xin dynasty, who overstepped his bounds and usurped the throne. Even with the benevolence of Tang and Wu, they could not escape later criticism. How much more so for rebellious ministers and treacherous sons who monopolize power and plot usurpation and regicide? How excellent was Mei Fu’s memorial, which cautiously admonished against the gradual encroachments of the Wang clan! His foresight was profound, his concern for the moral order meticulous. Alas, the ruler of his time could not heed his words, and disaster ultimately unfolded, giving rise to treachery. Thus, later generations saw the likes of Huan Xuan and Hou Jing, who followed in his wake. The *Daodejing* says: ‘Act before things exist; govern before disorder arises.’ Was this not Mei Fu’s intent—to reinforce the weight of the Three Bonds and Five Constants with this Dao? Alas, his warning went unheeded. The *Daodejing* further says: ‘When the great Dao declines, benevolence and righteousness arise; when cunning and wisdom emerge, great falsehood follows.’ These words say it all.”

*Records of Perfected Immortals Through the Ages Who Embodied the Dao*, Scroll Fourteen concludes.
*Comprehensive Mirror of Perfected Immortals Through the Ages Who Embodied the Dao*, Scroll Fifteen begins.

Master Pei, the Perfected One of Pure Tranquility—styled Xuanren—hailed from Xiayang in Youfufeng. He was born in the second year of the reign of Emperor Ming of Han. Of clear and luminous bearing, his countenance and demeanor were refined and unadorned; he excelled in speech and laughter. His eyes shone with keen light, his arms hung past his knees, and his voice carried with resonant clarity, ringing like a struck bell.

His family revered both the Buddhist and Daoist Ways. From the age of ten, he remained awake day and night, immersing himself in the study of scriptures with single-minded devotion. On the eighth day of the fourth month, he once traveled by carriage with Feng Lan, Zhao Kangzi, and Hao Jicheng of Shangdang to a Buddhist stupa. The sky was overcast and rain fell when suddenly a lowly man, clad in a worn hempen robe and a yellow headscarf, approached the rear of their carriage and begged for a ride. Master Pei greeted him with courtesy and inquired after him, but the man did not reply. Pei alighted and invited him aboard. Kangzi and Jicheng grew furious and rebuked him: “What manner of man is this, that he should ride in our carriage?” Pei reasoned with them, and they relented, allowing the man to join them. Pei himself walked behind the carriage, his expression unchanged, while the stranger rode in ease, showing no sign of shame.

As they neared the stupa, the man said, “My home lies nearby.” He stepped down from the carriage and vanished abruptly within the stupa. A Daoist adept named Zhi Ziyuan, who possessed some knowledge of the Way and was said by elders to be one hundred seventy years old, saw Pei and sighed: “From youth to old age, I have seen many people, yet never one like you.” He invited Pei into a secluded chamber, a quiet and serene room, where a lavish feast was laid out. After they had eaten and drunk, the adept led Pei to a more secluded retreat and bade him sit. He then said, “I am skilled in reading faces, but none compare to yours. The pupils of your eyes resemble the moon’s pearl, and your forehead mirrors the radiant Yaoguang star of the Northern Dipper. From your back downward, your form is like that of the celestial stalwart. You are destined for noble rank and shall become a divine immortal—your aspirations in this world shall be fulfilled. Yet the bridge to the Way has not yet opened, and the seven qi remain unrefined. Without witnessing wondrous phenomena, you cannot achieve success without cause.”

He then revealed to Pei the secret methods of cultivation he had practiced, saying, “These are the inner arts of longevity, unknown to the world. Long ago, I wandered to Mount Jiao and the slopes of Ao Zu, where I encountered the immortal Master Jiang—none other than Chi Jiang Ziyu. He bestowed upon me five divine formulas. I have followed them for one hundred seventy years, and my vitality remains youthful; I do not feel the onset of age. Yet because I have not practiced diligently, my true resolve has faltered, and I have not transcended the world. Though my years have been prolonged, I have not attained divine immortality. This is the fault of lax practice and insufficient focus. Now I shall teach them to you.”

Thus he instructed Pei in the various stages of meditative visualization, the methods of circulation and breath-holding, and bestowed upon him sacred scriptures and talismanic writings from the loftiest perfected ones. He also transmitted the two formulas for consuming *fuling* and sesame, as taught by Master Jiang of Mount Jiao to Ziyuan. The method for preparing *fuling* is as follows:

Take five *jin* of *fuling*, thoroughly clean and remove the outer skin, then pound it finely and soak it in three *dou* of white honey. Place this in a copper vessel—or a heat-resistant white ceramic vessel—and set this vessel inside a large cauldron, filling the cauldron with water halfway up the sides of the drug container. Simmer with a gentle fire, allowing the water to boil and the vessel to heat. Frequently turn and stir the mixture to ensure thorough blending. When the honey has fully dissolved and the liquid has reduced, remove it and place it in an iron mortar. Pound it thirty thousand times until it can be formed into pills. Take thirty pills daily, each the size of a *wutong* seed. After one hundred days, all ailments will vanish; after two hundred days, one may read by night; after two years, one may command ghosts and spirits; after four years, jade maidens will attend you; after ten years, your night vision will gleam with light, and you will be able to conceal or reveal yourself at will, achieving longevity and enduring sight.

After one year of taking this, no harm can befall you, no illness can afflict you; your complexion will revert to that of an infant, your skin will be plump and radiant, white hair will turn black again, and your eyes will gleam with flowing light. When compounding the medicine, fast for three days and prepare it in a secluded chamber. Ensure no women, birds, dogs, or impure persons witness the process. For five *jin* of *fuling* and one or two *dou* of white honey, use a wooden lid to cover the vessel during cooking, keeping it sealed. Stir frequently while cooking, and only open the lid once the medicine is fully prepared. Use only fine firewood and charcoal, not rough kindling. Pay close attention to the process, constantly monitoring and adjusting as needed. The quantity for compounding may be adjusted as desired.

Once the medicine is prepared, form it into pills in advance and store them in a honey vessel, where they will keep for a thousand years without spoiling.

The method for consuming sesame, as taught by Master Jiang to Ziyuan in the Golden Ao Zu Mountains, is as follows:

Take three *dou* of sesame, selecting plump, clean seeds regardless of whether they are yellow or black. Roast them over a gentle fire until fragrant and thoroughly dry, then grind them finely into a powder, ensuring it is fine and even. Do not sift it. Mix three *dou* of white honey with the sesame powder, stirring until fully blended and smooth. Place the mixture in a vessel and set it in a cauldron of water, then cook it following the same method as for *fuling*. Once the mixture has reduced, remove it and pound it thirty thousand times until it can be formed into pills the size of *wutong* seeds. Take thirty pills daily. After consuming one full dose, your intestines will transform into sinew, you will be unaffected by cold or heat, your face will regain a youthful glow, and you will command a host of spirits.

Master Jiang relied solely on these two formulas, ascending through the mist in transformation, his breath summoning instant arrival, moving without hindrance, riding a retinue of dragons, ascending to pay homage to the imperial perfected ones, and attaining the rank of immortal patriarch.

**Le Ba**
Le Ba, styled Shuyuan, was a transcendent from Neihuang. The *Immortals’ Biographies* states he was from Shu Commandery.

Le Ba served the Han Emperor Huan, rising through four promotions to become Grand Administrator of Guiyang, where his governance earned great renown. Later, he was transferred to Yuzhang as Grand Administrator. The commandery’s lands abounded with mountains and rivers teeming with malevolent spirits, and the common folk often ruined their fortunes in offerings and prayers. Le Ba, who had long cultivated the Dao and could command ghosts and gods, systematically destroyed the illicit shrines, suppressed the deceitful shamans, and thus caused all uncanny phenomena to vanish. Though the people initially feared his measures, they ultimately found peace.

After Emperor Huan’s death, when Emperor Ling ascended the throne and Chen Fan was executed, Le Ba was implicated in the partisan affair and demoted to Grand Administrator of Yongchang. He submitted a memorial citing his merits to request dismissal, pleading illness and refusing to assume office. He submitted another memorial in vehement remonstrance, arguing the injustice of the Dou clan’s case. Enraged, the emperor issued an edict of severe rebuke, ordering his arrest and delivery to the廷尉. Le Ba took his own life.

The *Record of the Ocean of Compiled Accounts* states: The following day, a great wind arose, and the sky darkened into gloom, and Le Ba vanished. When inquiries were made, it was learned that on that very day, he had returned to Chengdu to bid farewell to his relatives before ascending to heaven.

The *Immortals’ Biographies* records: Le Ba was a native of Chengdu in Shu. From youth, he loved the Dao and neglected worldly affairs. When the Grand Administrator visited him, he requested that Le Ba serve as his Merit Officer, treating him with the courtesy due a teacher or friend. Upon Le Ba’s arrival, the Grand Administrator said, “I have heard that you possess the Dao. Might you demonstrate some marvel?” Le Ba assented. Seated calmly, he entered the wall and vanished, drifting like a wisp of cloudy qi, until his whereabouts were no longer known. Outside the wall, witnesses saw him transform into a tiger—indeed, the tiger was Le Ba.

Later, he was nominated as Filial and Incorrupt and appointed Gentleman Cadet, then promoted to Grand Administrator of Yuzhang. The temple on Mount Lu housed a spirit that could converse with outsiders from within its curtains, tossing wine cups into the air. Those who sought its blessings could command the winds on rivers and lakes, raising sails to meet passing ships. When Le Ba arrived in the commandery, he went to the temple and the spirit vanished. Le Ba declared, “This temple spirit has falsely posed as a celestial official, harming the people for too long. Its crimes warrant punishment.” He entrusted the matter to his Merit Officer while personally pursuing the spirit. “If we do not swiftly subdue it,” he warned, “it may roam the realm, accepting sacrifices everywhere and wrongfully harming good people. We must press it with severe interrogation.” He dispatched orders throughout the region, investigating mountain groves and earth-altars to track the spirit’s traces. The spirit fled to Qi Commandery, where it transformed into a scholar well-versed in the Five Classics. The Grand Administrator of Qi took the scholar as his son-in-law. Le Ba, learning of its whereabouts, submitted a memorial requesting leave from his post to capture the spirit.

Upon arrival, Le Ba visited the Grand Administrator and said, “I have heard you have a worthy son-in-law. Might I meet him?” The spirit, aware of Le Ba’s coming, feigned illness and refused to emerge. Le Ba told the Grand Administrator, “Your son-in-law is no man—he is the old spirit who impersonated a temple god. He has fled here, and I have come to seize him.” When the Grand Administrator summoned the scholar to no avail, Le Ba said, “Bringing him out will be easy.” He requested the Grand Administrator’s brush, ink, and memorial case, then inscribed a talisman. As he finished, he let out a long whistle into the air. Suddenly, an unseen figure took the talisman, and the entire assembly was startled. The talisman reached the scholar, who wept to his wife, “I must die if I go.” Moments later, the scholar clutched the talisman and appeared in the courtyard. Upon seeing Le Ba, he dared not approach. Le Ba rebuked him, “Old spirit, why not resume your true form?” At once, the scholar transformed into a raccoon dog, kowtowing and begging for mercy. Le Ba executed it, and all saw the blade descend from the air, the raccoon dog’s head rolling to the ground. The Grand Administrator’s daughter had borne a child, which also transformed into a raccoon dog and was killed.

Le Ba returned to Yuzhang. The commandery had many ghosts, including numerous one-legged spirits that harmed the people. After his arrival, such afflictions ceased, and all malevolent and uncanny forces vanished at once. Later, he was summoned to serve as Gentleman of the Palace. On New Year’s Day, during the grand court assembly, Le Ba arrived with the scent of wine about him. When the emperor bestowed wine upon the officials, Le Ba did not drink but instead spat three times toward the west and southwest. The censors reported his disrespect. Summoned to explain, Le Ba said, “In my hometown, the people built a temple for me in my lifetime, believing I could subdue ghosts and protect the sick. Now, elders from my village have come to my temple to make offerings. I could not bear to turn them away, which is why I carry the scent of wine. Just now, I saw a fire in the marketplace of Chengdu, so I spat wine to summon rain and extinguish it. I dared not show disrespect.” He requested that an imperial edict be sent to verify the matter, offering to accept punishment if his claim proved false.

A courier was dispatched to Chengdu, which reported: “On New Year’s Day, after the morning meal, a fire broke out. Suddenly, three great rains came from the northeast, and the fire was quenched. The rain that fell upon people carried the scent of wine.”

One day, a sudden storm arose, and the sky darkened until those seated opposite could not see one another. Le Ba vanished. When inquiries were made, it was learned that he had returned to Chengdu to bid farewell to his relatives, declaring he would not return. Young and old gathered at his temple to see him off. As they did, the wind and rain darkened the sky, and none knew where he had gone.

The *Declarations of the Perfected* states: “Formerly, Le Ba departed through a martial liberation and entered the forests of Lü Mountain, where he remained for thirteen years before returning home. He now dwells in the Red Rock Mountains of Heming.”

**Zuo Ci**
Zuo Ci, styled Yuanfang, was a native of Lujiang. From youth, he was well-versed in the Five Classics and also mastered astral prognostication. Seeing that the Han dynasty’s mandate was nearing its end and the realm was descending into chaos, he lamented, “In this declining era, high office invites peril, and great wealth courts death. The glory of this world is not worth coveting.” He thus devoted himself to the Dao, becoming particularly adept in the Six Jia techniques and able to command ghosts and gods, conjuring banquets at will. He meditated deeply in the Tianzhu Mountains and obtained the *Nine Elixirs of the Golden Liquid* from a stone chamber. His transformations were myriad and beyond count.

Cao Cao heard of his fame and summoned him, confining him in a chamber under guard and cutting off his grain, providing only two *sheng* of water daily. After a year, Zuo Ci emerged, his complexion unchanged. Cao Cao wished to learn the Dao, but Zuo Ci said, “To cultivate the Dao, one must be pure and inactive.” Enraged, Cao Cao plotted to kill him. Zuo Ci, sensing this, requested to resign and return home. Cao Cao asked, “Why so suddenly?”

Zuo Ci replied, “I knew you intended to kill me, so I sought to leave.” Cao Cao said, “I had no such intention. If you wish to pursue lofty aspirations, you should not stay long.” He then prepared a feast for him. Zuo Ci said, “Now that we part ways, I wish to share this cup of wine with you.” Cao Cao agreed. Zuo Ci drew his hairpin and traced the wine in the cup, which instantly split in two, leaving a gap of about a *fen* between them. Zuo Ci then drank half and offered the rest to Cao Cao, who was displeased and did not drink at once. Zuo Ci urged him to finish it, then tossed the cup toward the roof beam. The cup hung suspended from the beam, swaying as if a bird in flight—seeming about to fall yet never falling. All present fixed their gaze upon it. After a long while, the cup finally fell to the ground. When they looked, Zuo Ci had vanished.

Later, during one of Cao Cao’s banquets, Zuo Ci was also in attendance. Cao Cao turned to his guests and said, “Today’s gathering is grand, with delicacies nearly complete—all that is missing is a *Wu* River perch from Songjiang.” Zuo Ci then asked for a bronze tray filled with water, into which he cast a bamboo rod with bait. In an instant, he pulled out a perch. Cao Cao said, “One fish is not enough for all our guests.” Zuo Ci cast his line again and pulled out another perch, each over three *chi* long. Cao Cao then remarked, “Now that we have the fish, it is a pity we lack fresh ginger from Shu.” Zuo Ci said, “That is easily obtained.” Fearing he might fetch it from nearby, Cao Cao said, “I previously sent men to Shu to buy brocade—tell them to add two more bolts.” In moments, the ginger arrived, along with the messenger’s report. When the messenger returned and was questioned about the additional brocade, his account matched perfectly.

Later, Cao Cao went to the outskirts of the city, accompanied by over a hundred officials. Zuo Ci produced a *sheng* of wine and a *jin* of dried meat, pouring and serving it himself. All the officials drank and ate their fill. Cao Cao, harboring ill intent, ordered his men to seize Zuo Ci and kill him. Zuo Ci stepped back into the wall and vanished without a trace. Later, someone reported seeing Zuo Ci at his dwelling, and Cao Cao sent men to capture him. They seized Zuo Ci, who did not resist—he wished the world to witness his divine powers. He was then imprisoned. The jailers prepared to torture him, but when they opened the cell door, there stood one Zuo Ci inside and another outside. Unsure which to interrogate, they reported to Cao Cao, who, enraged, ordered a general to take him out and execute him in the marketplace.

In an instant, seven Zuo Cis appeared. The officer managed to seize six, but one escaped. Soon after, the six vanished as well. Cao Cao then ordered the four city gates closed and a search conducted. Some, unfamiliar with Zuo Ci, asked what he looked like. They were told, “He has one blind eye, wears a hempen headscarf, and a plain blue robe.” Yet every man they saw resembled Zuo Ci, and none could be captured. Cao Cao commanded that whoever was caught should be beheaded on the spot. Days later, Zuo Ci appeared and had his head cut off, presenting it to Cao Cao. Overjoyed, Cao Cao declared it was indeed Zuo Ci’s head. But upon closer inspection, it was merely a bundle of thatch. When they turned to look at the body, it too had vanished.

Later, a traveler from Kuaiji arrived and reported seeing Zuo Ci there. Another encounter occurred at the summit of Yangcheng Mountain, where pursuers chased him until he fled into a flock of sheep. Knowing he could not be caught, Cao Cao ordered his men to call out from among the sheep, “We will not kill you—we only wished to test your arts.” Suddenly, an old ram knelt on its forelegs, stood upright, and spoke, “Why so hasty?” As they rushed toward it, the entire flock of several hundred sheep transformed into old rams, all kneeling on their forelegs and repeating, “Why so hasty?” Thus, they could not tell which to seize.

The above accounts largely align with those in the *Book of the Later Han*. Governor Liu Biao also deemed Zuo Ci a corrupting influence and planned to arrest and execute him. Liu Biao led his troops in a display of force. Zuo Ci, sensing his intent to test his arts, approached him and said, “I have some humble wine—I wish to offer it to your army.” Liu Biao replied, “You are but a solitary Daoist—how can your meager provisions suffice for my many soldiers?” Zuo Ci insisted. Liu Biao sent men to inspect the offerings: a *dou* of wine in a vessel and a bundle of dried meat, which ten men together could not lift. Zuo Ci then stepped forward, took the meat, sliced it with a knife, and scattered the pieces on the ground. He invited a hundred men to distribute the wine and meat to the soldiers. Each received three cups of wine and one slice of meat, which tasted like ordinary fare. Though over ten thousand men were fully sated, the vessel’s wine remained as before, and the meat was not exhausted. Even the thousand guests at the banquet grew thoroughly drunk. Liu Biao was astonished and abandoned any thought of harming Zuo Ci.

Zuo Ci then took his leave of Liu Biao and entered Dongwu. Xu Duo of Dantu was a practitioner of the Dao, and Zuo Ci visited him. Xu Duo’s retainers had six or seven ox-drawn carts parked at his gate. They deceived Zuo Ci, saying, “Master Xu is not at home.” Zuo Ci, knowing they lied, ordered them to leave. Immediately, the oxen were seen walking along the treetops. When the men climbed the trees, the oxen vanished; when they descended, the oxen reappeared, still walking above. The carts’ hubs sprouted thorns a *chi* long, which could not be cut or moved. Terrified, the retainers reported to Xu Duo: “An old man with one blind eye—we thought him an unimportant person and lied, saying you were not at home. After he left, the oxen began behaving strangely. We do not know what this means.” Xu Duo exclaimed, “Ah! That must have been Master Zuo passing by. How could you deceive him? Hurry and pursue him—you may still catch up!” The retainers scattered to search, and upon finding Zuo Ci, they surrounded him and kowtowed in apology. Zuo Ci’s anger subsided, and he let them return. When they arrived, the carts and oxen had returned to normal.

Zuo Ci later visited Sun Ce, who also wished to kill him. Once, while out on an excursion, Sun Ce invited Zuo Ci to accompany him and had him walk ahead of his horse, intending to stab him from behind. Zuo Ci wore wooden clogs and leaned on a bamboo staff, walking slowly. Sun Ce whipped his horse in pursuit but could not catch up and eventually gave up. Later, Zuo Ci entered Mount Huo, where he compounded the *Nine-Flower Elixir*. Upon its completion, he ascended as an immortal.

The *True Records* states: “Zuo Ci now resides on Mount Xiao Kuo, often traveling here and there. He will soon receive another appointment.”

Zuo Ci’s complexion remained youthful, having benefited from the refining fire of the *Nine-Flower Elixir*. The annotation below states: Zuo Ci, styled Yuanfang, was the younger brother of Li Zhongfu and the master of Ge Xuan. The Wei ruler and his son summoned various masters of esoteric arts, and Zuo Ci was among them. At the end of Emperor Xian of Han’s *Jian’an* era, he crossed the Yangtze in search of mountains and entered a grotto. There, he begged for cinnabar and compounded the *Nine-Flower Elixir*. The *Nine-Flower Elixir* is a method from the *Taiqing* canon; *Xiao Kuo* refers to Mount Xiao Kuocang, located north of Yongjia’s Xi Bridge.

Kong Yuanfang was a native of Xuchang. He regularly consumed pine resin and fuling fruit. When he first obtained this medicine, he was already advanced in years. Thereafter, he grew younger with each passing year, maintaining the appearance of a man in his forties. You Yuanjie and Zuo Yuanfang were close friends, both well-versed in the Five Classics and worldly affairs, yet devoted to the cultivation of Daoist arts. Yuanfang was benevolent and kind, wearing coarse clothing and eating simple fare. He drank no more than one *sheng* of wine a day. He lived to be over one hundred and seventy years old. Daoists would occasionally invite Yuanfang to gatherings where guests took turns proposing drinking games. When his turn came, Yuanfang said nothing but propped his staff against the ground, then grasped it and stood upside down, head below and feet above, holding a wine cup in one hand to drink. No one else could perform such a feat.

Yuanfang had one wife and one son. He accumulated no surplus wealth and grew a modest amount of grain. Once, when a fire broke out, neighbors rushed to help salvage his belongings—clothing, provisions, and household items—but Yuanfang paid no heed, sitting exposed beneath a fence to watch the flames. His wife urged him to assist, but Yuanfang laughed and said, “Why fret over such things?” Elsewhere, by the water’s edge, he carved a cave into the bank, over a *zhang* in width and breadth. Yuanfang entered it to abstain from grain for months before returning home. Even his family was not permitted to visit. Before the cave stood a mulberry tree, and he would come and go through brambles and undergrowth, his path winding and concealed. When disciples had urgent matters and sought his dwelling, none could find it.

Later, a young man from the east, surnamed Feng and named Yu, was fond of the Dao. He observed Yuanfang entering the cave and followed him inside. Yuanfang said, “No one has ever found me before. Today you have seen me—you seem teachable.” He then presented two scrolls of plain script and said, “These contain the essential teachings of the Dao. Every forty years, I may transmit them to one person. If the world lacks a worthy recipient, I will not recklessly pass them on merely to fulfill the time limit. If after forty years no one is found, but after eighty years two suitable candidates appear, I will transmit the teachings to both at once. To withhold transmission from one who is fit is to obstruct the Dao of Heaven; to transmit to one who is unfit is to leak Heaven’s treasure. Obstructing the Dao or leaking its treasure brings misfortune upon one’s descendants. Now that I have found my successor, I shall depart.” He then abandoned his wife and child and entered the western cliffs.

Fifty years later, he briefly returned to his hometown, where some recognized him.

Jiao Xian, styled Xiaoran, was a native of Dayang in Hedong.

In his hometown, he lived for many years, reaching the age of one hundred and seventy. He subsisted on white stones, resembling the large taro of today. Daily, Jiao Xian would enter the mountains to gather firewood, which he distributed to others, beginning with the first household at the village head and proceeding in order, cycling through them again and again. He would first place the firewood outside a person’s door, and if they saw him, they would spread a mat for him to sit and prepare a meal. Jiao Xian would then sit and eat but never spoke to anyone. If no one noticed him, he would quietly leave the firewood at the door and depart. He continued this for years.

When the Wei dynasty received the Mandate of Heaven, he dwelled by the banks of the river, weaving grass into a hut where he lived alone. He did not arrange mats or cushions, using only grass as his seat. His body was filthy, caked with grime like mud or lacquer. Sometimes he ate only once every few days. He never walked along paths and avoided all association with women. When his clothes wore out, he would sell firewood at the market to buy new ones, yet he always wore only a single layer, even in winter.

Governor Dong Jing visited him, but Jiao Xian refused to speak. Nevertheless, Jing regarded him as a worthy. Later, a wildfire broke out and burned down his grass hut.

When people came to see him, they found Jiao Xian seated solemnly beneath his hut, unmoving. After the fire had passed and the hut was entirely consumed, he slowly rose—his clothes unscorched by the flames. He then built another hut. One day, a great snow fell, and many houses collapsed. Jiao Xian’s hut also toppled, and when people came, they could not find him, fearing he had frozen to death. They dismantled the hut to search for him and discovered him soundly asleep beneath the snow, his complexion flushed, his breath steady and deep, as if he were a drunkard napping in the heat of summer. Though none understood his strangeness, many wished to study the Way under him. Jiao Xian said, "I possess no Way." Whether old or young, he remained thus for over three hundred years before taking leave of others, vanishing without a trace. Those who sought his teachings never received a single word from him.

*The Book of Wei* states: "Since the time of Fuxi, there has been only one such man."

**Yang Wengbo**
Yang Wengbo served his parents with filial devotion. When he buried his father and mother, the spirits were so moved that a spring welled forth beside their grave. One day, a man who had come to water his horse gave Yang a pint of white stones, telling him to plant them, for they would grow into fine jade. Later, a youth in blue led him to a mountain by the sea, where an immortal said, "Your filial piety toward your parents has earned you and your wife immortality." Soon after, a woman of the Xu clan was betrothed to him with a white jade as the bride-price. Several years later, the couple ascended together to heaven.

*The Records of Anomalies* also states: Yang Wengbo often offered travelers broth. One day, after a man had drunk his fill, he took a pint of white seeds from his sleeve and gave them to Yang, saying, "Plant these, and they will grow into fine jade, and you will also gain a good wife." Yang did as instructed. A woman of the Xu clan, surpassingly beautiful, sought his hand in marriage. Lord Xu said, "Only if you present a pair of fine jade." Yang gave him the jade disks he had grown, and so took her as his wife.

**Li Yiqí**
Li Yiqí was a man of Shu Commandery. He lived from the time of Emperor Wen of Han until the reign of Liu Bei of Shu. When someone spoke of the palaces, temples, markets, and streets of the commanderies and kingdoms, Li Yiqí would mold soil into miniature replicas—every detail of the lands and their people perfectly rendered, though in minute scale. In an instant, they would crumble away, vanishing without a trace.

When Liu Bei prepared to launch a campaign against Wu to avenge Guan Yu, he summoned Li Yiqí. When Li arrived, Liu Bei asked him about the campaign’s fortunes. Li Yiqí did not answer but instead took up brush and paper, drawing a dozen or so soldiers, horses, and weapons before tearing the paper to shreds. He then drew a great man digging a pit and burying something before departing without a word. Liu Bei was displeased. He indeed set out with his army, only to be defeated by Lu Xun. His forces—over a hundred thousand strong—were slaughtered, and only a few hundred men returned. Their armor, weapons, and provisions were utterly lost. Overcome with shame and distress, Liu Bei fell ill and died at Yong’an.

The assembled company then reflected on the figure Li Yiqí had drawn—of the great man digging a pit and burying something—and realized it had been an omen of Liu Bei’s death.

Another account states: Li Yiqí hollowed out a clay cave at the corner of the city wall and lived within it. Winter and summer alike, he wore only a single robe, drinking wine and eating dried meat and dates. Sometimes he would not emerge for a hundred days, sometimes two hundred.

Du Qi
Du Qi, styled Guangping, was a native of Duling in Jingzhao. In the early Jian’an era of Emperor Ling of Han, he crossed the Yangtze to join Sun Ce. Later, under Sun Quan (in *True and Unadorned Pavilion*, mistakenly written as Sun Hao), he served as □□ Commandant. In the second year of Huangwu, Du Qi studied the Dao, taking Jie Ying as his teacher. He received the arts of the Mysterious and the White and dwelled on the eastern slopes of Mount Mao. After a long time, he gained the ability to conceal his form and vanish from sight. Often, he would gather firewood with his disciples and trade it for clothing and provisions, yet no one could detect him. Several times, he entered grottoes and attained immortality.

*The True Records* states: He had two disciples, one named Sun Gui, a woman called Cold Blossom, and the other Chen Shijing. During the reign of Sun Xiu, Shijing served as Gentleman Attendant.

Li A
Li A was a man of Shu during the Three Kingdoms period. Those who passed down his story saw him unchanged by age. He often begged for food in the markets of Chengdu, distributing whatever he received to the poor. He would depart at night and return by dawn, yet no one in the market knew where he lodged. An old man named Gu Qiang suspected Li A was an extraordinary person and frequently attended to him. Once, he followed Li A to his dwelling and discovered it was in the Qingcheng Mountains. Later, Gu Qiang trailed him again but, fearing tigers and wolves, secretly carried his father’s great sword. Li A saw this and grew angry, saying, “You follow me, yet fear tigers?” He took the sword and struck a rock, shattering it. Gu Qiang was deeply distressed over the broken blade. The next morning, Li A asked him, “Are you worried about the ruined sword?” Gu Qiang replied, “I truly fear my father’s anger.” Li A then gathered the fragments, struck the ground with them, and restored the sword to its original state before returning it.

Gu Qiang followed Li A back to Chengdu. Before they arrived, they encountered a man driving an ox-cart. Li A placed his foot beneath the wheel, crushing his bones to pieces, and died instantly. Gu Qiang watched over him, but after a moment, Li A revived, pressing his foot back into place as if nothing had happened. At the time, Gu Qiang was eighteen, while Li A appeared to be around fifty. When Gu Qiang was over eighty, Li A remained unchanged. Li A told others that he had been summoned by the Kunlun Mountains and would not return.

*The Nine Regions Record* states: On Jiaotan Mountain in Zizhou, the Perfected One Li A once cultivated the Dao. Later, he ascended to immortality at Xinjin in Shuzhou.

Your servant Daoyi remarks: Li A had long since attained the Dao, and many years had passed. Observing his eagerness to aid the orphaned and poor, even humbling himself to beg for food to fulfill his teachings, his intent was profound. Note his words to Gu Qiang: “You follow me, yet fear tigers?” This aligns precisely with the *Daodejing*’s meaning of “traveling by land without encountering rhinoceros or tiger.” That Gu Qiang, though sharp-eyed enough to recognize Li A as an extraordinary person, could not comprehend that rhinoceroses would have nowhere to thrust their horns nor tigers to place their claws!

Jie Xiang
Jie Xiang, styled Yuanze, was a native of Kuaiji. Well-versed in the Five Classics and widely read in the works of the Hundred Schools, he was also skilled in composition. Secretly, he practiced Daoist arts and entered the Eastern Marchmount to receive esoteric techniques of restraint. He could kindle fire atop reeds to boil a goose, leaving the reeds unscorched. He could ensure that within a mile, no one cooked or steamed food, and dogs and chickens would remain silent for three days. He could make an entire marketplace sit motionless, conceal his form, and transform into grasses, trees, birds, or beasts.

Having heard of the *Scripture of the Nine Elixirs*, he traveled thousands of miles in search of it. Failing to find a enlightened teacher, he entered the mountains to meditate in solitude, hoping to encounter immortals. Exhausted, he lay down upon a rock, where a tiger approached to devour him. Awakening, he saw the tiger and said, “If Heaven sent you to attend and protect me, stay. If the mountain spirit sent you to test me, leave at once.” Entering the mountains, he found in a valley countless purple-hued stones, radiant and as large as goose eggs. He took two and wandered deeper into the valley, but the depths were impassable, so he returned to the mountains.

There, he saw a beautiful girl of fifteen or sixteen, her appearance extraordinary, clad in five-colored garments—clearly an immortal. Jie Xiang bowed and begged for the method of longevity. The girl said, “Hurry and return what you hold to its original place, then come back. I will wait for you here.” Jie Xiang returned the stones to the valley and came back to find the girl still in the same spot. He bowed again, and she said, “The qi of your blood and food has not yet dissipated. Abstain from grains for three years, then return. I will remain here.” Jie Xiang went home, fasted for three years, and returned. The girl was still in the same place. She gave him a single elixir formula and instructed, “Attain this and you will become immortal. Do nothing else.”

Before he could compound the medicine, Jie Xiang often stayed at the home of his disciple Le Yanya. Beneath the curtains, several scholars debated unresolved matters from books and records. Unable to restrain himself, Jie Xiang intervened to resolve their disputes. The scholars, realizing he was no ordinary man, secretly memorialized him to the lord of Wu. Jie Xiang learned of this and wished to leave, saying, “I fear official duties will constrain me.” Le Yanya firmly detained him.

The lord of Wu issued an edict to summon him. When Jie Xiang arrived at Wuchang, he was treated with great respect and addressed as “Master Jie.” A residence was built for him, furnished with imperial curtains, and he was bestowed gifts worth thousands of gold. He taught the lord of Wu the art of concealment. After testing it in the rear palace and passing through palace gates unseen, the lord was astonished. He also commanded Jie Xiang to transform and cultivate melons, vegetables, and a hundred fruits, all of which sprouted instantly. When the lord discussed with him which fish dish was finest, Jie Xiang replied, “Steamed fish is the best.”

The lord said, “This fish dwells in the sea—how can it be obtained?”

Jie Xiang replied, “It can be obtained.” He instructed that a square pond be prepared in the palace courtyard and filled with water. Then he cast a line with hook and bait, lowering the line into the flames. In less than the time it takes to eat a meal, he caught a small fish. The lord was astonished and delighted, asking, “Is this edible?”

Jie Xiang said, “I retrieved it precisely to prepare a steamed dish for Your Majesty—how could it not be edible?” He then had the royal chefs cut the fish. The lord remarked, “When the envoys from Shu do not come, the finest steamed fish is made with ginger. Yet even that cannot compare to this—how can ginger be obtained?”

Jie Xiang replied, “It is easily done. Send someone with fifty coins, and I will inscribe a talisman on a bamboo staff. Have the person close their eyes and mount the staff, and when the staff stops, let them buy ginger. Once purchased, they must close their eyes again.” The person followed his instructions and mounted the staff. In an instant, they arrived in Chengdu, unaware of where they were until they asked and were told they were in Shu. There, they bought ginger. At that time, the lord of Wu’s envoy, Zhang Wen, was in Shu, and his attendants happened to meet the ginger-buyer. Startled, they wrote a letter to send home. The buyer returned with the ginger to the palace kitchens, and the steamed fish was prepared.

Jie Xiang could also read all talismanic scripts as if reading a book, without error. When some doubted him, they took various talismans, removed their annotations, and showed them to him. Jie Xiang distinguished each one without fail.

Another man planted millet in the mountains and was constantly troubled by macaques eating it. Hearing of Jie Xiang’s mastery of the Dao, he sought a method to repel the monkeys. Jie Xiang told him there was no other way but this: “Tomorrow, go to your millet field. When you see a troop of monkeys, do not shout loudly but say to them, ‘I have already informed Master Jie, and he has instructed you not to eat the millet.’” The man, taken aback, thought Jie Xiang was deceiving him. The next day, when he saw the monkeys about to descend from the trees, he tried speaking as instructed. The monkeys immediately retreated to the farthest branches.

Jie Xiang repeatedly requested to leave Wu, but the lord would not permit it. He then declared that he would fall ill on a certain day. The lord sent attendants to bestow upon him a box of pears. Jie Xiang ate them and died in an instant. The lord had him buried. Though he died at midday, by dusk that same day, he had already arrived in Jianye. There, he gave the pears he had been bestowed to the palace gardeners to plant. Later, the gardeners reported this to the lord, who opened the coffin to find only a wooden tablet with a talisman.

The lord, missing Jie Xiang, converted his residence into a temple and frequently went in person to offer sacrifices. Often, a white crane would alight upon the seat and remain for a long while before departing. Later, his disciples saw Jie Xiang in the Gai Zhu Mountains, his complexion even more youthful than before.

*Record of Perfected Immortals Through the Ages Who Embodied the Dao, Scroll Fifteen Concludes*
*Record of Perfected Immortals Through the Ages Who Embodied the Dao, Scroll Sixteen*

Dong Feng, styled Junyi, was a native of Houguan County in Fuzhou. During the reign of the former lord of Wu, a young man once served as magistrate of his home county. At the time, Junyi was over thirty, though the magistrate did not know he possessed the Dao. More than fifty years later, the magistrate returned to another post and passed through Houguan. All the former officials and clerks went to see their old superior, and Junyi also went. His complexion remained as before, entirely unchanged. The former magistrate, who had known him long ago, asked, "Do you cultivate the Dao? When you were in the county all those years ago, those of your age are now white-haired, yet you remain youthful." Junyi replied, "It is merely happenstance."

Du Xie, serving as Inspector of Jiaozhou, contracted a poisonous illness and died. Three days had passed when Junyi, who was then in the south, went to him. He placed three medicinal pellets into the dead man’s mouth and had others lift Xie’s head to help him swallow them. After the time it takes to eat a meal, Xie opened his eyes and moved his limbs. His complexion gradually returned, and within half a day, he could sit up. He revived completely. Four days later, he was able to speak and recounted, "At the moment of death, it was as if I had fallen into a dream. I saw dozens of black-clad men come to take me away. They placed me on a dew cart and entered through a great vermilion gate, then delivered me directly to a prison. Each cell had but a single door, just wide enough for one person. They put me into one and sealed it from the outside with earth, so I could no longer see beyond. In a daze, I heard someone say, ‘The Great One has sent an envoy to summon Du Xie. Quickly, open the door and let him out.’ I heard people digging at the cell with shovels, and after a long while, they pulled me out. Outside, I saw carriages and horses with vermilion canopies. Three men sat together in one carriage. One held a tally and called for Du Xie to board. They were about to return to the gate when I awoke."

After Xie revived, he had a tall tower built for Junyi in his central courtyard. Junyi did not consume ordinary food, eating only dried meat and jujubes, though he greatly enjoyed drinking wine. Three times a day, Xie would prepare a feast for him, and Junyi would come to his residence to eat and drink. When descending the tower, he would suddenly seem like a flying bird, instantly arriving at his seat without any sense of moving downward. Ascending was the same. This continued for three years, until Junyi sought to leave. Xie wept and begged him to stay, but Junyi did not consent.

Xie asked, "Where do you wish to go? I shall prepare a great ship for you." Junyi replied, "No ship is needed—only a coffin will suffice." Xie then had one prepared. By midday the next day, Junyi had died. Xie ordered his burial. Seven days later, a traveler from Yanchang arrived and saw Junyi, who thanked Duke Du, urging him to take good care of himself. Xie then opened Junyi’s coffin and found only a piece of silk bearing a talisman inscribed in cinnabar.

Later, Junyi returned to live beneath Mount Lu. A young man afflicted with leprosy, near death, carried himself to Junyi, kowtowed, and begged for mercy. Junyi had the man sit in a room, covering his eyes with five layers of cloth and warning him not to move. He instructed his household to keep away. The man said, "I felt something come and lick me—so painful I could not endure it. Its tongue seemed about a foot long, its breath as heavy as an ox’s. I do not know what it was, but after a long while, it left." Junyi then returned, removed the blindfold, gave the man water to drink, and sent him away, saying, "You will soon recover. Only avoid the wind." After ten days, the man’s body turned entirely red, skinless and in agony, but bathing in water eased the pain. After twenty days, new skin grew, and his sores healed, leaving his body smooth as congealed fat.

Once, during a great drought when all grains withered, the county magistrate Ding Shiyan said to his clerks, "Master Dong possesses the Dao and must be able to summon rain." He personally brought wine and dried meat to Junyi and explained the suffering caused by the drought. Junyi replied, "Rain is easily obtained." Looking up at his roof, he said, "A poor man’s house lets in the sky—how can rain be summoned here?" The magistrate understood and said, "Master, only pray for rain, and I shall have a proper roof built for you." The next day, Shiyan led his officials and laborers to gather bamboo and timber to construct a house. When it was finished, they prepared to plaster the walls, digging earth to mix with water for mortar. Junyi said, "No need to fetch water—by dusk, rain will come of its own." That night, a great rain fell, filling both high and low places.

Junyi dwelled in the mountains, healing the sick with incantations and water, never accepting money or goods. Instead, he instructed those cured of serious illnesses to plant five apricot trees, and those with minor ailments to plant one. Over several years, he amassed over seventy thousand trees, which grew into a dense forest. Beneath the apricots, beasts and insects of the mountain roamed freely, yet no weeds grew, as if the ground had been meticulously tended. When the apricots ripened, Junyi built a granary beneath the trees and told the villagers, "Those who wish to buy apricots need not announce themselves—simply take them. Place a measure of grain in the granary, and take an equal measure of apricots." If someone took more apricots than the grain they offered, three or four tigers would glare and chase them. Terrified, the person would flee, the apricots spilling, and the tigers would depart. Upon returning home, they would find the apricots matched the grain they had given. Others who stole apricots without leaving grain would find their families dead upon returning home. Only after returning the apricots and kowtowing in apology would the dead revive. From then on, those buying apricots measured them fairly in the grove, daring no deceit.

Junyi used the grain he received to relieve the poor and aid travelers, distributing three thousand *hu* each year, yet still having much left over. The magistrate’s relative had a daughter possessed by a malevolent spirit, and no one could cure her. He told Junyi, "If you heal her, I shall give her to you as a wife." Junyi summoned the spirits, and a great white dragon, sixteen feet long, slithered overland to the girl’s door. Junyi ordered it slain, and the girl recovered. The magistrate then gave his daughter to Junyi in marriage. For a long time, they had no children, and as Junyi often traveled, his wife could not live alone. He adopted a ten-year-old girl to keep her company. One day, Junyi received a mandate from the Supreme Emperor, appointing him Overseer of the Azure Void and Perfected Man of the Great One. He ascended in broad daylight. His wife and adopted daughter continued to live in his house, selling apricots. If anyone cheated them, tigers chased them as before. The adopted daughter grew up and married, but her husband was a violent man who often stole sacred robes and objects from temples. The temple deity spoke through a shaman, saying, "So-and-so relies on being the immortal’s son-in-law to steal my clothes. I am not here, so I can only shame him. For the immortal’s sake, I shall not pursue the matter."

Junyi lived among the people for a hundred years, his complexion ever like that of a man in his thirties. After his ascension, people built a shrine on the site of the apricot grove, calling it the Palace of the Great One. Emperor Zhenzong of the Song bestowed the name *Da Zhongxiangfu Guan*, and Emperor Huizong of the Song, during the Xuanhe era, posthumously enfeoffed him as Perfected Man of Ascending Primordiality. Some say that south of Zhongli County in Haozhou lies Apricot Mountain, where Dong Feng planted his trees.

Yao Guang—Yao Guang was a man of unknown origin.

Having mastered the Dao of divine elixirs, he could divide his form and scatter his shadow, sit or stand at will and vanish, remain unscorched by fire, and unharmed by blades. The King of Wu personally tested him: stacking thousands of bundles of reeds, he had Yao Guang sit within them and set fire to the pile on all sides. The smoke and flames blotted out the sun, and the onlookers filling the capital all believed Yao Guang would be reduced to ashes. Yet when the fire died down, Yao Guang emerged from the ashes, shaking out his robes, his countenance as composed as ever. In his hand he held a scroll, which the King of Wu read but could not comprehend. Later, his whereabouts became unknown.

Xu Wan—Xu Wan was a native of Haiguan in Wu Commandery. From a young age, he possessed Daoist arts and could subdue malevolent spirits. A girl of the Du family in Qiantang suffered from a demonic affliction. Xu Wan performed a ritual to summon the specter, and suddenly a man clad in a white linen robe entered the door. With a single shout from Xu Wan, the man transformed into a white tortoise. One day, Xu Wan went with several of his cousins to Stone Ridge Mountain to gather spring firewood. As dusk fell, he did not return. The next morning, they searched but found no trace of him—until they suddenly saw him on the mountain, his sickle tucked under his arm, leaning against a tree, motionless. They embraced him, only to find an empty husk.

Master Mao—The Perfected One’s surname was Mao, his given name Ying, and his courtesy name Shushen. He was a native of Nanguan in Xianyang. His ancestral line descended from the Ji clan, and his family took the name Mao, accumulating virtue and benevolence over generations, their blessings flowing through a hundred ages. Their descendants were born with luminous wisdom, succeeding one another in an unbroken line.

His great-great-grandfather, whose given name was Meng and courtesy name Chucheng, possessed profound insight into the mysteries and surveyed the rise and fall of states. Foreseeing the decline of Zhou, he refused to serve any of the feudal lords and instead became a disciple of Master Guigu of Beiguo Bei’e. He then retreated into seclusion on Mount Hua, dwelling on the western peak Lingfeng, roaming the secluded valleys, contemplating the immortals, and maintaining a lofty detachment from the world of mortals.

His great-grandfather, whose given name was Yan and courtesy name Taineng, was the fourth son of Meng. He served during the reign of King Zhaoxiang of Qin, beginning as a Gentleman of the Palace and later rising to the rank of Cavalry Colonel and Marquis of Changping, known for his loyalty and integrity. He rendered meritorious service to his time.

His grandfather, whose given name was Jia and courtesy name Zhenglun, served King Zhuangxiang of Qin as Marquis of Guangxin. At that time, Qin had already annexed Ba, Shu, Hanzhong, and the regions of Wan and Ying, establishing Nanjun. To the north, it had seized Shangjun and the lands eastward, establishing Hedong, Taiyuan, and Shangdang, extending east to Xingyang, annihilating the Two Zhous, and establishing Sanchuan Commandery. Lü Buwei was appointed Chancellor and enfeoffed as Marquis Wenxin, tasked with attracting wandering scholars and strategists to unify the realm. When the First Emperor ascended the throne, Jia assisted the imperial house and was enfeoffed as Marquis Dexin. In the sixth year of his reign, Han, Wei, Zhao, Wei, and Chu jointly attacked Qin (the *Zizhi Tongjian* records that Qin was attacked by the five states of Chu, Zhao, Wei, Han, and Yan, who seized Shouling). The First Emperor dispatched Jia to lead troops against them, achieving great merit. When Wei was pressed toward its eastern capital, Jia again subdued it, pacifying the region. The First Emperor, admiring Jia’s resolve and integrity, bestowed upon him five thousand catties of gold. In the twenty-fifth year, Qin launched a massive military campaign, sending Jia to attack Liaodong in Yan. He captured the King of Yan and returned. He was then dispatched to pacify the Jiang region of Jing, and the southern lands all submitted. That same year, Kuaiji Commandery was established, and Jia was sent to lead troops there but vanished. The First Emperor, mourning his loyalty, buried him with the rites of a Chancellor on the southwestern slope of Longshou Mountain in Chang’an.

Jia had six sons, all renowned in their time. The First Emperor granted them official ranks and titles to honor their father, each receiving a surname. His sixth son, whose given name was Zuo and courtesy name Yanying, neither sought office nor pursued scholarship, content to live as a farmer. He was Mao Ying’s father.

Zuo had three sons: the eldest, whose given name was Ying and courtesy name Shushen; the second, whose given name was Gu and courtesy name Jiwei; and the youngest, whose given name was Zhong and courtesy name Sihe. Mao Ying was born in the fifth year of Emperor Jing of Han’s Zhongyuan era (the bingshen year). From childhood, he possessed extraordinary conduct, his natural talent shining brightly. He harbored lofty aspirations and distant ambitions, neither seeking fame nor associating with the unworthy. He delighted in purity and emptiness, his heart tranquil and his spirit attuned to the mysteries. At the age of eighteen, he abandoned his home and left his family, entering Mount Heng, where he studied the *Laozi’s Dao and Virtue Classic* and the *Zhouyi Commentaries*, gathering mountain herbs to consume as food. Dwelling in secluded cliffs and pristine valleys, he aspired to the sublime, forever estranged from the world.

In the thirtieth year of the First Emperor’s reign, on the gengzi day of the ninth month, Mao Ying’s great-great-grandfather Meng, who had studied under Master Guigu on Mount Hua, ascended to heaven in broad daylight, riding clouds and dragons. Earlier, a folk song in his hometown had foretold:

*"The immortal attained is Mao Chucheng,*
*Riding dragons to ascend into the Great Clarity,*
*Now descending to the Dark Continent to sport in Red City.*
*In generations to come, it shall be our Ying,*
*If the Emperor learns this, let the twelfth month be renamed Jiaping."*

When the First Emperor heard the song, he inquired about its meaning. The village elders explained, "This is an immortal’s song, exhorting the Emperor to seek longevity." Thereupon, the First Emperor joyfully conceived the desire to seek immortals and renamed the twelfth month Jiaping.

After six years on Mount Heng, Mao Ying’s devotion to the supreme Dao evoked a profound response. In his dreams, he communed with divine discourse, and one day, a transcendent jade maiden of the Great Mystery appeared before him, holding a jade tablet. She said, "In the Western City resides Lord Wang, who has attained the Dao. He can be your teacher. Why do you not seek him out and receive his teachings?" Mao Ying was awakened and inspired. He climbed perilous peaks and traversed rugged paths to reach the Western City. After three months of fasting and purification, he bathed and faced the sacred realm. Pushing through brambles and braving dangers, he prostrated himself before the divine precinct and finally beheld Lord Wang.

Twenty years later, he followed Lord Wang west to Mount Gui, where he met the Queen Mother of the West. Mao Ying kowtowed and bowed twice, addressing the Queen Mother: "I, Mao Ying, am a humble and lowly being, a remnant of withered bones. How dare I, with my unworthy frame, aspire to the lifespan of dragons and phoenixes? How can one of ephemeral existence seek the duration of endless ages? Though I gaze upon the distant current, I know not how to cross the ford, for the path is blocked and impassable, and my desires find no refuge. I constantly fear that one day I shall perish in the calamity of the mundane world, becoming a laughingstock to the vulgar."

Thus, in days past, he bore his pack into the secluded groves, craving the life his master bestowed. There he encountered Lord Wang, who took pity on Mao Ying’s earnest suffering and imparted to him the essentials of bodily cultivation and the method of absorbing qi. Thereafter, he retired to a quiet chamber in profound seclusion to practice these arts. His master further instructed him, saying: “Your body is not of jade or stone, nor does it possess an enduring master within; your qi does not arise from the four seasons as an unceasing inner spring. You must properly guide its ingress and egress, regulate your breath to achieve harmony, refine your fluids through cultivation, and align form and spirit without error. When resonance and reflection accumulate, the hun and po will not stagnate; when principle accords with its proper measure and qi is tempered to its rightful state, then the essence of form will not wither, and the dwelling of the spirit will not decay.

“If, however, the spirit is wearied by constant to-and-fro, and the fluids are taxed by ceaseless outflow and inflow, then the form will daily wither, the spirit will likewise fade, the years will diminish from their beginning, and the months will wane from their former fullness. You must seek with subtle discernment the benefits of enduring transformation.”

The Queen Mother of the West said: “Your heart has reached true sincerity. In former times, my own masters—the Primordial Celestial King of the Origin and the Great Emperor Lord of the Fusang Tree—entrusted me with essential teachings. Do you wish to hear them?”

Thereupon, she orally transmitted to Mao Ying the Dao of the Jade Pendant and Golden Wheel, along with the *Canon of the Supreme Ultimate and Mysterious Perfection*. Mao Ying bowed to receive her words and stood with head reverently lowered.

She further instructed him: “The Golden Wheel is the radiant canopy of the Upper Clarity, the inner perfection of the yin luminants. The Jade Pendant is the hidden mystery of the Supreme Lord, the treasured script of the Cavernous Flight. Those who attain this Dao ascend through the rosy clouds, roam the eight poles, repose in the high void, and wander the Purple Emptiness.”

The words spoken earlier by the Primordial Celestial King and the Great Emperor Lord were the esoteric writings of the Two Luminants of the Grand Empyrean, the texts of the Jade Pendant and Golden Wheel. There are also the inner true writings of the yin and yang luminants, which accompany the original texts. By the law of the Supreme Lord, these are to be transmitted only to the Directors of Destinies. You, Mao Ying, are divinely chosen and inscribed in jade; your name is carved in gold, your inner radiance shines with yellow brilliance, and your pure script belongs to the Upper Clarity. It seems you are destined to become a Lord of the Upper Ministers, entrusted with the office of Director of Destinies. This Dao shall later be bestowed upon you in full.

“Yet without first mastering the Dao of the Mysterious Perfection of the Hall of Light, you cannot obtain the esoteric writings of the Grand Empyrean.”

Thereupon, Mao Ying took leave of his master and returned home. Though he dwelt among the common folk, he did not conform to worldly ways. He later recounted that he entered the northern valley of Mount Heng to study the teachings of the Confucians, at which time he was forty-nine years of age.

His parents were still living. When his father saw him, he flew into a rage, reproaching his son for unfilial conduct, for failing to attend to their care. He accused him of pursuing delusions and drove him away, declaring, “I shall disown you as if you had never been born!” He sought to beat him with a staff. Mao Ying knelt in obeisance and pleaded: “I have received a mandate to attain the Dao. The laws of the Dao and the affairs of the world cannot both be served. Though I am far from your daily care, I bring no momentary benefit, yet I can ensure the peace of our household and the long life of my parents.

“I have already received the talismans and registers of my sagely master. Those who assist me are the soldiers of the Celestial Ding, and those who attend me are the jade maidens and immortal youths. Now that my Dao is accomplished, I cannot be struck, for even a minor official’s investigation would not be a trivial matter.”

His father, outwardly bound by ritual propriety, had not yet grasped the inner subtleties. The mysterious realm of the Dao remained beyond his understanding. Thus, Mao Ying demonstrated his true condition to dispel the doubts of the multitude.

Then, as his father raised the staff toward Mao Ying, poised to strike, the staff suddenly shattered into dozens of fragments, each flying like loosed arrows—those that struck the wall pierced it through, and those that struck the pillar sank deep into the wood. His father, awakened to the extraordinary, abandoned his anger and desisted.

Mao Ying said, “What I warned of earlier was precisely this: had the blow fallen upon another, injury would have been unavoidable.”

By the time of Emperor Xuan of Han, both of Mao Ying’s younger brothers had risen to prominence. Mao Zhong served as Grand Master of the Five Officials and Governor of Xihe, while Mao Gu became Commandant of the Capital. As they prepared to assume their posts, hundreds from their hometown gathered to see them off. Mao Ying, also present, addressed the guests: “Though I do not hold a two-thousand-bushel office, I too have a celestial appointment. Next year, on the third day of the fourth month, you shall know. Could you gather again as we do today?” The assembly agreed, for it was the fourth year of Emperor Yuan’s *Chuyuan* reign.

The following year, the guests assembled as before. On the appointed day, several *qing* of land before Mao Ying’s gate suddenly leveled itself, not a blade of grass or speck of dust remaining, all covered in azure silk that draped over the eaves. Beneath the roof, layers of white felt were spread, enough to seat hundreds. Word spread far and wide, and the road was choked with those who came—far more than had gathered to send off his brothers. As the guests assembled, Mao Ying played the gracious host, yet no servants were seen. Instead, golden platters and jade cups appeared of their own accord before each guest, bearing rare delicacies and fruits beyond naming, and wine of surpassing excellence. There were also musicians—strings, winds, bells, and chimes—whose music shook heaven and earth, while the fragrance of musk and orchid drifted for miles. Over six hundred dined and drank, all sated and intoxicated.

The next day, when the officials arrived to welcome them, hundreds of civil officers in crimson robes and white sashes appeared, while the military escort bore armor, weapons, and banners that blazed like the sun. Mao Ying took leave of his family and kin, then addressed his clansmen: “The true Dao of immortals is hidden, its glory veiled at the edges, not meant to dazzle the eyes or deafen the ears. That I cannot silently withdraw into obscurity or ascend the empty peaks of Mount Kongtong is only to inspire my younger brothers to follow this path. How could it be only Gu and Zhong who turn from delusion? All under heaven with hearts inclined should aspire to the hope of attaining transcendence.”

Having spoken, he returned to Mount Juyu, which the people thereafter called the Mountain of Lord Mao. Meanwhile, his brothers, still in office, heard of Mao Ying’s divine feats—how he walked upon the void, crossed waves as if treading land, and was attended by spirit officials, his fame on every tongue, his banners and standards illuminating the world. Only then did they believe that immortality could be cultivated and the divine attained, that Wang Qiao and Chisongzi were no mere legends, and that the tripod of Mount Dinghu was real.

Thereupon, they both resigned their posts and returned home. In the year corresponding to their birth signs, they began to practice the remnants of Mao Ying’s teachings. Yet without the oral instructions, they gained no benefit. Sighing together, they said, “Our elder brother has attained the Dao—who else could it be? If we do not go to him and ask for the secret instructions, but remain here studying these common methods, how can we hope to grasp the Way?” Resolved, they abandoned their homes, carrying their own provisions, and set out in search of him.

In the second year of Emperor Yuan’s *Yongguang* reign, on the sixth day of the third month, they crossed the Yangtze to seek their brother on the Eastern Mountain. At last, they met, tears of sorrow and joy mingling. Mao Ying said, “Why have you awakened so late?”

His brothers knelt and replied, “Gu and Zhong were dull and ignorant, blind to the Dao. We beg you to grant us long life and salvation.”

Mao Ying said, “You are already old—it will be difficult to restore you. Even with the true instructions, you may only become earthbound immortals. Ascending to the great heights of the heavens is beyond what I have studied. For now, I will teach you gradual steps, easier practices to sustain yourselves.”

Thereupon, he instructed them in the Way of swallowing the first sprouts of green teeth and circulating saliva, a method to stanch the flow of blood, replenish desiccation, and strengthen sinews and bones—a practice to prolong life without death. After three years of strict fasting, he transmitted the higher Dao, teaching them to visualize the *qi* of the Mysterious True within the Hall of Light, to refine and circulate generative essence, and to harmonize the spirit and soul. Within three years, through sincere and concentrated effort, their divine radiance manifested. Then the Six Ding spirits attended them, and celestial soldiers guarded them.

Mao Ying also bestowed upon each a dose of Nine-Turn Returning Elixir and a divine formula. They bowed, consumed them, and attained the immortal Dao. Later, he gave each a scroll of Purple Silk Script, a hundred characters long, which Gu and Zhong received with reverence.

Some still harbored doubts, so Mao Ying revealed the Purple Silk Text, which read:

*“By the command of the Supreme, the Heaven-Bearing True Scripture declares: Mao Gu of Xianyang, dwelling at the Southern Pass, styled Jiwei, is destined for transcendence. His rank is Fixed Record, and he oversees the earthly immortals. He is to recommend the worthy and the Dao-endowed, whose lifespans are intertwined. Through diligence and reverence, he upholds the laws of the Four Poles. His palaces and towers are established on Mount Juyu in Danyang. Gu, be vigilant—your every movement is observed.”*

And further:

*“Mao Ying and his brother Zhong, of pure and accomplished virtue, though versed in returning to the correct path, have probed the subtle and perfected sincerity. They have severed ties with the Six Heavens and displayed keen discernment. Now they are humbled to the Three Offices, preserving life and establishing their names. They govern Mount Tai, record life and death, and hold the rank of Earth Immortal. As luminaries of the Nine Palaces, they instruct the young, open the path to power, and teach the women’s quarters. They are entrusted with wondrous numina, govern the hundred ghosts, oversee the spirits, and examine the sources of rivers. They regulate the flow of the Yangtze and seas, seal the Golden Valley, and store the Jade Liquor. They oversee the cultivation of dragon mushrooms and luminous herbs of the caves. They govern Mount Liangchang, stand at the mouth of the Northern Grotto, and guard the gate of the Dark Palace.”*

The messenger delivered the scripture and departed.

In the second year of *Yuanshou* of Emperor Ai of Han, on the *jiyou* day of the eighth month, the Five Themes each rode their directional chariots, accompanied by their retinues of officials, descending to receive the mandate of the Great Emperor. They bestowed upon Ying the title of *Supreme Minister of the Eastern Marchmount and Lord Controller of Destiny*. The decree was inscribed on purple jade tablets in golden characters. Its text read:

“Whereas Ying, born of emptiness and clarity, has long been steeped in the subtle mysteries of the profound; from childhood, he let his hair loose upon the Northern Mountains, stilled his heart amidst forests and marshes, and with concentrated spirit sought the divine. He scaled perilous peaks and traversed deep valleys, enduring hardship in his quest for a master’s gate. Casting off his form in utter abandon, he flung himself across ten thousand fords; with cinnabar sincerity and untrammeled nature, he followed the promptings of Heaven. Thus he attained the radiant craftsman and received the numinous scriptures ninefold. He sheared his hair in solemn vow, severed his head and body in sacrifice, girded himself with ropes in joy, and scorned hunger and cold. His path was the Dao alone; his safeguard, authenticity. His heart shone before the Supreme Emperor, and his fervor moved the Great Mystery.

Now, with reverence, We appoint Ying as *Great Perfected of the Primordial Origin* and *Supreme Minister of the Eastern Marchmount and Lord Controller of Destiny*. You have aligned your heart with uprightness, held fast to integrity firm as metal and stone, and with a cinnabar heart outshone the multitude, your spirit soaring in lofty radiance. Therefore, We bestow upon you the *Jade-Iron Green Banner and the Eight Might-Wielding Staff*, that you may subdue the sources of streams and marshes and vanquish the myriad spirits.

You have endured cold in forest valleys, savored the mysterious and gazed upon the real, your thoughts stirred by secluded peaks, your heart opened in pure sincerity. Therefore, We grant you the *Purple Tassel Staff and the Lotus-Blossom Crown*, that you may summon and command the myriad numina, seal mountains, and call forth clouds.

You have forsaken home and journeyed alone, parted from kin to delight in immortality, embraced hardship in your duties, and bared your breast to the mountains and rivers in winter. Therefore, We bestow upon you the *Embroidered Feather Purple Robe and the Vermilion-and-Indigo Flying Skirt*, that you may ascend the celestial steps with ease and bear the mandate of the Jade Perfected.

You have traversed marshes and trodden perilous cliffs, your heart devoted and your aspirations lofty, undaunted by fear. Therefore, We grant you the *Spotted Dragon Chariot and the White Tiger Plow*, that you may float upon the luminous void and soar to the imperial court.

You have pushed through brambles to merge with the light, endured cold and braved frost and snow, your heart seeking the radiant and true, unwavering and unafraid. Therefore, We bestow upon you the *Curved Dawn Jeweled Canopy and the Jasper Curtain Green Chamber*, that you may roam and gaze upon the Nine Palaces, your spirit serene in tranquil seclusion.

You have shunned worldly glory and withdrawn in reclusion, your heart untroubled, your form hidden in secluded peaks, your thoughts stilled amidst the myriad forests. Therefore, We grant you the *Flowing Gold Fire Bells and the Twin Pearl Moonlight*, that you may ascend to the Supreme Ultimate and communicate your voice to the *Upper Clarity*.

Your true heart is lofty and still, untouched by excess or entanglement, naturally resplendent, inwardly and outwardly at peace. Therefore, We bestow upon you the *Brocade Banner and Embroidered Pennant, the White Feather Black Staff*, that you may summon the Six Yin and command the Jade Maidens to attend your chariot.

Your kindness extends to all things, your hidden virtue nurtures the myriad beings, and even the tiniest creatures are tended with care. Therefore, We grant you the *Phoenix and Luan Flutes, the Golden Bell and Jade Chime*, that you may harmonize the spirits in the empty halls and delight the Perfected with dances of the numina.

You have nourished your spirit through hunger and thirst, sought the true through hardship, undeluded by the myriad things, your purity uncorrupted by a thousand evils. Therefore, We bestow upon you the *Purple Essence of the Lin Tree and the Jade Liquor in Golden Vessels*, that your life may equal the Three Luminaries and your name be inscribed upon the cinnabar jade tablets.

Ying, you preside over the pure and mysterious, your purple jade gleams with eightfold radiance, your heart shines with the brilliance of the double sun, and your spirit blazes with the great rosy clouds. Truly, you are foremost among the Perfected, and thus We honor you with the title *Great Primordial*. Your nine virtues are now complete, fully accumulated in the *Grand Tenuity*; Heaven and humanity dwell in empty whiteness, and without seeking, they converge as one. Now We requite your nine deeds to repay your past aspirations.

Ying, your heart and spirit are now radiant, the Four Numinous Ones abide within you, your cinnabar spirit shines forth, and you hold fast to uprightness without wavering. Your integrity is whole and steadfast, and your oversight leaves nothing unseen. Now We appoint you as *Minister of the Supreme Office* to govern the Eastern Marchmount. We further entrust you with the duty of *Controller of Destiny* to oversee the recording of registers and charts. We assign forty Jade Boys and forty Jade Maidens to attend you, that you may enter and exit the *Grand Tenuity* and serve in the *Supreme Ultimate*.

Your administrative palace is the *Red City Jade Grotto Residence*; govern it with care, and report all activities without fail.”

Thereupon, Ying took leave of his two younger brothers, Yu and Zhong, and departed with the Perfected Lord Wang for the *Red City Jade Grotto Residence*. As they passed through the mountains and rivers, the spirits and officials in charge came forth to welcome, guide, and follow them—numbering in the thousands and tens of thousands. Before departing, Ying addressed his two brothers: “I now leave and assume my duties, and we shall no longer be able to visit each other frequently. Though we may see each other morning and evening, it will be a thousand years before I return to this mountain. Mark these dates: on the eighteenth day of the third month and the first day of the twelfth month, my master, the *Great Void Red City Perfected of the Southern Marchmount*, will visit you here. Remember this well. If any aspirants to the Dao await me here, I shall personally attend to them, instructing and guiding those who have not yet awakened.”

Thereupon, Jiwei and Sihe remained to govern this mountain grotto, establishing palaces and structures outside. They spread the Dao to nurture the myriad things, bestowing moisture upon the mortal world, their virtue extending to birds and beasts, each attaining its true nature. Their spiritual efficacy revealed fortune and misfortune, and all sins and transgressions were made manifest. With inner teachings harmonized and outer teachings at peace, wind and rain came in due season, the five grains ripened, pestilence did not arise, and calamities were averted.

The *True Records* state: Yu held the position of *Perfected of Juqu* and *Recorder of the Right Prohibitions*; Zhong held the office of *Controller of Destiny in the Three Offices, Preserver of Life*.

The village elders sang:
“Maoshan joins Jinling,
Lakes and rivers lie downstream.
Three divinities ride white wagtails,
Each presiding o’er a mountain’s crown.
Sweet rains drench the parched rice,
Dry fields’ seedlings grow supple too.
Wives and children keep their homes secure,
Freeing me from every care.
White cranes soar in azure clouds—
When shall they return to roam?”

Minister Daoyi said: Mao Ying, scion of true immortals, fulfilled the immortals’ prophecy, spurned the glory of tripods and cauldrons, and yearned for the teachings of the Mysterious Origin. Thus he fixed his resolve on the Dao, his purity moved the numinous, and through profound merit he attained success. Though wealth and nobility abounded, and his two younger brothers held lofty ranks and illustrious positions, Ying remained unmoved. To him, his brothers’ splendor was but a fleeting dream, a bubble, a shadow. Yet they had not yet awakened, so he manifested divine transformations to enlighten them, ultimately guiding both brothers to return to the □ Dao.

The *Daodejing* says:
“Music and fine food—
passing travelers pause.
The Dao, when spoken,
is bland, without flavor.
Look—it cannot be seen;
listen—it cannot be heard.
Yet its use is inexhaustible.”

Such was Mao Ying’s intent.

Han Chong
Han Chong, styled Changji, was a native of Piling in Wu Commandery.

In his youth, Han Chong was devoted to the Dao. The immortal Wang Zhangxuan of Linwu Cave once transmitted to him the method of the Flowing Pearl Elixir, which he reverently practiced with great efficacy. Zhangxuan told him, “By following this Way, you may still enter officialdom without hindering your ascent to immortality.” Chong thus served as Magistrate of Wanling, governing with benevolence and pacifying the people through the Dao. Tigers and wolves kept their distance, and locusts never alighted within his borders. Later promoted to Governor of Runan, he recognized the talent of his clerk, Yuan An, and recommended him for advancement. An would later rise to the position of Minister over the Masses, and contemporaries universally acknowledged Chong’s discernment in judging men.

Chong lived in simplicity, and the emperor, marveling at this, increased his salary to the rank of *zhong erqian shi*. When Emperor Xiaoming of the Later Han toured Runan, he visited Chong’s residence, where Chong had sent his wife to stay with a solitary elderly woman. Upon hearing of this, the emperor sighed, “Han Chong is truly tempered steel that does not melt.” He bestowed upon him fifty bolts of fine silk.

Chong governed the commandery for fourteen years, his transformative governance renowned as the finest in the realm. At the age of seventy-four, Zhangxuan transmitted to him the method of Hidden Liberation. He departed to enter Great Huo Mountain, where he received Zhangxuan’s technique of the Mud-Pill Cinnabar Gate for transcending the world. Today, he serves as Left Supervisor of the Central Bureau within the grotto.

The *Book of Han* records similar events, though its phrasing differs slightly.

Yuan An, styled Shaoping, began as a county clerk and, through successive promotions, rose to the Three Excellencies, passing away during the reign of Emperor He. He was the great-grandfather of Yuan Shao. During the Jin dynasty, there was also Feng Xi, who likewise served as Grand Master, their fame and rank being comparable.

After Han Chong achieved Hidden Liberation, he must have left behind an empty corpse. In Shangjin of Jin Commandery stands a towering tomb, long known as Han’s Mound. Some suspect it resembles the tomb of Lord Peach, and that this is merely an empty barrow, though later generations mistakenly call it the tomb of Sun Ce’s general, Han Dang.

Feng Liang

Feng Liang was a native of Guanjun in Nanyanɡ. In his youth, he served as a county clerk. At the age of twenty, he was appointed as an attendant to welcome the Inspector. Ashamed of his lack of ambition, he smashed the linchpins of his carriage, tore his tattered robes, and fled. He studied the *Book of Songs*, the *Book of Rites*, and the *Book of Changes* under a teacher, and later learned Daoist arts and divination. His family believed him dead, but after fifteen years, he returned. He cultivated his resolve and integrity, maintaining strict discipline. Though the province and commandery summoned him with honors, he refused. The imperial court specially summoned him as a Filial and Incorrupt candidate of the highest rank, but halfway there, he abandoned the journey and returned home. At the time, the Three Excellencies vied to yield their positions to him, yet he declined to descend and accept. At the age of sixty-seven, he abandoned the world, crossed eastward into the mountains, and now resides in the Deer’s Approach Grotto. He was a man of Emperor An of the Later Han’s reign. The *Book of Han* records a similar account.

Lang Zong

Lang Zong, styled Zhongsui, was a native of Anqiu in Beihai. In his youth, he served as an official and became the magistrate of Wu County. He studied Daoist arts with precision and divined the winds and qi. One day, a violent wind passed through his window. He divined that a great fire would burn the Great Xia Gate in the capital and sent someone to verify it—indeed, it was so. When the various nobles heard of this, they summoned Zong as a Court Academician. Zong, ashamed to be appointed for his divination skills, removed his official seal and sash by night, shouldered his books, and fled.

Dwelling at the foot of Mount Hua, he consumed sesame pills, attained the Dao, and now resides in the Deer’s Approach Grotto on Mount Mao.

The *Book of Later Han* records Lang Zong’s affairs as follows: He mastered the *Changes* of Jing Fang, excelling in astrology, wind divination, the six-day and seven-part cycles, and the observation of qi to prognosticate fortune and misfortune. He often earned his livelihood through divination. Emperor An summoned him to respond to a policy discussion, and the various scholars endorsed him. Later, he was appointed magistrate of Wu County. One day, a sudden violent wind arose, and Zong divined that the capital would suffer a great fire. He noted the year and month, sent someone to verify it, and the event unfolded exactly as he had foretold. The nobles, upon hearing of this, memorialized the throne, and he was summoned as a Court Academician. Zong, ashamed to be recognized for his divinations, received the summons, hung his official seal and sash in the county courtyard, and fled, never again to serve in office.

His son, Chan, styled Zhiyuan, inherited his father’s arts and studied them with precision, gathering several hundred disciples. In the second year of Emperor Shun’s *Yangjia* reign (133 CE), he was summoned to the palace and presented eleven memorials, after which he was appointed Gentleman of the Palace. Upon returning home, he was later murdered by a fellow townsman, Sun Li.

Chunyu Shen

Chunyu Shen, styled Shuxian, was a native of Shangyu in Kuaiji. During the reign of Emperor Huan of the Han, he served as magistrate of a county in Xuzhou. In Emperor Ling’s time, he was summoned by the Grand General. From youth, he was devoted to the Dao, mastered arts of calculation, and consumed sesame and Solomon’s seal as elixirs. Later, he retired to Mount Wuwumu in Wu to live in seclusion, where he encountered the immortal Huichezi, who transmitted to him the *Scripture of the Rainbow Radiance Elixir*. Through cultivation, he attained the Dao and now resides in the Grotto’s Registry of Attainment as the Law-Enforcing Gentleman of the Standard-Bearing Bureau.

The *Triplex Unity of the Book of Changes* states: "During Emperor Huan’s reign, Chunyu Shutong of Shangyu received instruction from Xu, an Attendant in Xuzhou. Gazing upon the celestial patterns to discern disasters and anomalies, his predictions often proved accurate. For this discernment, the commandery recommended him as a fangshi, and he was promoted to Market Director of Luoyang." This account differs slightly, for there is no Mount Wuwumu in Wu. Both Jiaxing and Wuxing have Mount Tianmu; perhaps it is one of these.

Tao Jun

Tao Jun, styled Wengzhong, was a native of Qiantang. In his youth, he served as an assistant in the commandery, but later abandoned his post to study at the Imperial Academy, where he mastered classical arts and the interpretation of disasters and anomalies. In his later years, he became Governor of Jiaozhi. At the end of the Han, he renounced the world and entered Mount Zengcheng to study the Dao, where he encountered Dongguo Youping. Youping, a man of the Qin era who had long dwelled in seclusion in Mount Zengcheng and attained the Dao, taught Jun the method of refining qi with the Nine Essences to align the heart with the auxiliary stars. Jun cultivated this practice to perfection and now resides in the grotto, concurrently serving as the Controller of the Northern River and Director of Punishments for the Water Bureau. Though this position falls under the Registry of Attainment, in truth, he receives his duties from the Central Palace’s Discipline Office. The *Book of Han* makes no mention of these events.

The tomb now lies in Linping of Qiantang, its mound and altar still distinct, with descendants yet remaining. Locals have at times heard the sound of drums and horns nearby, so none dare encroach or damage it, all addressing it as the Tomb of Controller Tao. The Qiantang recluse Du Jing, who served Jing Chan, and the former worthy Xian Yinju, together composed poems in praise of his virtue, which are collected separately.

As for Youping, nothing further is recorded of note.

Liu Lan

Liu Lan, styled Zixiang, was a native of Yingchuan. From youth, he cherished the Dao and virtue, though his family was exceedingly wealthy. He often aided the poor and distressed, delighting in bestowing hidden kindnesses and secret favors. When Zhang Jizha of Chenliu was returning to mourn his teacher, his funeral carriage broke down and his ox faltered, leaving him stranded on the road in Runan. Lan encountered him and spoke with him without revealing his name, then immediately offered his own carriage and ox for Zhang’s use. He aided the bereaved and rescued the destitute on more than one occasion.

Later, when Lan was in Chang’an, he was recommended for office. Upon arriving in the capital, the Emperor praised his heart and appointed him Gentleman of the Palace, then promoted him to Governor of Chenliu. For five hundred *li* beyond Chang’an, he gathered the dead and succored the poor, diminishing himself to share with others. While traveling through Yangping, he encountered Master Ma Huang, who told him: “Your benevolent heart has moved Heaven, and your hidden virtues have touched gods and spirits. The Supreme One will commend your sincerity and has sent me to impart to you the Dao of longevity. I am an immortal official—would you be willing to follow me?”

Lan then knocked his head upon the ground and struck his breast, saying: “From youth I have loved longevity. Now, by good fortune, I have met a divine immortal—pray, allow me to attend and serve you.” Master Ma Huang then led Lan into Mount Tongbai, where he transmitted the Eight Arts of Concealing the Earth and the method of ingesting the essence of the Five Stars. He now bears the name Donghua and resides in the grotto, serving as Right Supervisor of the Registry of Attainment.

The *Book of Han* states: “Lan, styled Zixiang, was a native of Yin. His family was wealthy, and he was ever able to bestow aid without considering it a favor. Once, while traveling through Runan, he encountered Zhang Jizha of Chenliu, who was hastening to a teacher’s funeral. Struck by cold and ice, Zhang’s carriage had broken down, leaving him stranded upon the road.”

Lan, seeing this, said to him: “You hasten to fulfill your duty with such reverence—your journey must not be delayed.” He then dismounted, gave Zhang his own carriage, and departed without revealing his name, urging his horse onward. Zhang Jizha suspected it was Lan Zixiang.

Later, when Zhang returned to Lingyin, he sought to return the borrowed carriage, but Lan shut his gate and refused to receive him. He remained steadfast in his resolve, lying ill in bed, declining all official summons. The prefect of Henan’s Shen□kou Commandery appointed him as a Merit Officer. When the Yellow Turban rebels arose, Lan aided those in dire distress, providing sustenance to several hundred. When villagers or clansmen perished, he ensured their burial; when widows or widowers lacked means, he assisted in their remarriage.

When Emperor Xian relocated the capital to the Western Metropolis, Lan was recommended as an Exemplary Filial and Incorrupt Candidate. At the time, bandits blocked the roads, so he traveled by night and hid by day, eventually reaching Chang’an. The emperor, admiring his loyalty and diligence, appointed him Gentleman-Consultant and later promoted him to Grand Administrator of Chenliu. Lan then distributed his treasures, keeping only his carriage and horses, and set out eastward on his own. Several hundred *li* beyond the pass, he came upon a scholar-official who had died by the roadside; he exchanged his horse for a coffin and removed his own robes to clothe the deceased.

Later, he encountered an old acquaintance starving by the road. Unable to bear leaving him, he slaughtered the ox pulling his carriage to feed the man. Others urged him to stop, but Lan said: “To see someone perish and not save them is no act of a man of resolve.” In the end, they both starved to death.

These accounts differ in minor details, so both are recorded here for consideration. Lan’s courtesy name, Zixiang, aligns with the naming conventions of the time, and the character *shuo* (朔) also carries fitting connotations—though it remains unclear which is correct.

**Lü Zihua**
Lü Zihua (or Lü Zi□hua) was a native of Shanyang.

The disciple of the Yin Lord had already consumed the liquid of rainbow elixir but had not yet studied the *Inner Canon*. He came to follow Shu Qing to receive the *Hidden Writ of the Grand Empyrean* and recited it twice daily, delighting in the secluded retreat of the Square Terrace. He had no desire to ascend to the rank of immortal.

**Cai Tiansheng**
Cai Tiansheng was a native of Shanggu. In his youth, he sold miscellaneous incense for the Whistling Master in the wilds to sustain himself. His nature was kind and sincere, and he never spoke ill of others. Once, while traveling, he encountered a young girl from Hebei who was purchasing incense from him. Tiansheng recognized her as an extraordinary being and, bowing twice, offered her a full load of incense. Moved by his gesture, the girl taught him the method of paying homage to the Heavenly Emperor and the Jade Sovereign. Thereupon, he attained immortality, assuming the form of a crow perched upon a staff, and secluded himself on the Square Terrace. The girl still visits him from time to time. Tiansheng became her disciple.

**Liu Ping’a**
Liu Ping’a had no given name and never revealed it to others. During the late Han, he served as the magistrate of Ping’a in Jiujiang, hence his sobriquet. He practiced medicine with great virtue, healing others’ illnesses as if they were his own. While traveling, he encountered the immortal Zhou Zhengshi, who transmitted to him the Dao of concealed existence. Assuming the form of straw sandals and a hat, he came to dwell on the Square Terrace of Mount Mao. To the southwest of Greater Mount Mao lies the Four-Year Mountain, commonly known as Square Mountain. At its base is a grotto named the Square Terrace. He regularly absorbed the morning qi of the sun and moon, his complexion like jade, appearing as a man of thirty or so.

**Zhang Jizi**
Zhang Jizi was a native of Henan, originally named Zhang Feng, courtesy name Gongxian. In his youth, he was called Jizi. This man also seldom disclosed his name. The Grand Tutor Yuan Chen admired his lofty conduct and married his daughter to him. The daughter’s attire was extravagant and ornate, but Feng paid it no heed, treating her no differently than a stranger. Only after she changed her garments did they become a proper household. Later, he abandoned the world and entered Mount Ke, where he encountered the Mountain Chart Noble. The Mountain Chart Noble had been a grandee during the reign of King Ai of Zhou and was an immortal. He transmitted to Jizi the *Nine Clouds’ Robust Jade Method*. Through cultivation, Jizi attained the Dao and now resides in the Eastern Florescence Palace, serving as an appointee of the Supreme Ultimate. At times, he oversees the Nine Palaces as Minister, working alongside the Northern River Marquis to govern waterways and examine the Northern River’s Controller of Destinies. At other times, he serves as the Marquis of Prohibitions and Protections, sharing duties with others for this purpose. The Northern River’s Controller of Destinies also governs within the grotto-heavens, working in tandem with Zhang Jizi.

The *Book of Wei* records: Zhang Fan, courtesy name Gongyi, was a native of Xiuwu in Henan. His grandfather Yin served as Minister over the Masses in the Han, and his father Yan was Grand Commandant. Yuan Yi of Taiwei wished to marry his daughter to Fan, but Fan declined. His nature was tranquil, and he delighted in the Dao, refusing all official summons. Later, he became a Gentleman Consultant and served as an aide in the arsenal of the Chancellor and Martial Lord, who held him in great esteem. He was fond of aiding the poor and destitute, leaving no surplus wealth in his household. He died in the seventeenth year of the Jian’an era. His younger brother, Cheng, courtesy name Gongxian, was also renowned. He was appointed Gentleman of Rectitude, Remonstrating Gentleman, Grand Master for Remonstrance, and Grand Administrator of Zhao Commandery. Later, he followed the Martial Lord on a western campaign and died of illness in Chang’an. The names and details here differ significantly: Cheng and Feng are similar but not Yuan’s sons-in-law. If this refers to Fan, their courtesy names do not match. Upon careful examination of the circumstances, it is likely that they were brothers. The *Book of Wei*’s *Biography of Wang Xiu* further states: Xiu frequently traveled to Nanyang and often lodged at Zhang Feng’s residence. When Feng’s entire household fell ill, Xiu nursed them back to health. However, Zhang Fan and his brother had once taken refuge in Yangzhou, seeking shelter with Yuan Wei—not Liu Biao—and should not have been in Nanyang. These inconsistencies raise doubts.

**Zhao Guangxin**
In the Minor White Mountains of Ke, there was a Daoist practitioner named Zhao Guangxin, a native of Yangcheng.

At the end of the Wei dynasty, he crossed the Yangtze and entered these mountains, where he received from Li Facheng the method of *fuqi* (absorbing qi) and from his master Zuo Jun the Way of Guarding the Mysterious Center and the technique of internal visualization to see clearly through the five viscera. For seventy or eighty years, he wandered among the commanderies and states. Sometimes he sold medicines among the people, yet none recognized him. He often came to the capital, where he refined cinnabar into Nine-Flowered Elixir. Upon completing the elixir, with a single dose, the Supreme One Dao Lord dispatched an envoy on the seventeenth day of the sixth month in the first year of Emperor Mu’s *Yonghe* reign (345 CE). After three days, he bid farewell to his fellow practitioners in the mountains, then rode clouds and mounted a dragon to ascend to heaven in broad daylight. He now resides in the Eastern Florescence Sea.

**Zhang Zuchang**
Zhang Zuchang was a native of Pengcheng. During the Wu dynasty, he came from the north and entered the Fang Terrace Grotto of Mount Mao. Zuchang feigned death in a carriage accident, concealing his form in a secluded abode while cultivating the practice of Guarding the One. His master was Bao Cha of Shangdang, a fifth-generation descendant of Bao Xuan, the Han dynasty Minister over the Masses. Cha received the Dao from Master Wang. Bao Xuan, a Han dynasty Colonel-Director of Retainers, was killed by Wang Mang. Xuan’s son was Yong, Yong’s son was Yu, and Yu’s son was [unnamed].

**Yu Wengsheng**
In the Langwu Mountains lived a Daoist practitioner named Yu Wengsheng, a native of Kuaiji. Formerly, he received from the immortal Jie Jun the method of consuming solar essence, and during the Wu era, he came to seclude himself in these mountains. He also practiced the Way of Cloud Qi and Returning the Form. Through prolonged and concentrated meditation, his body reverted to the youthfulness of a child. On the twenty-third day of the seventh month in the first year of Emperor Mu’s *Yonghe* reign (345 CE), the Eastern Great Emperor dispatched an envoy to welcome him. That very day, he ascended to heaven on clouds and now resides in the Yang Valley Mountains. The Langwu Mountains contain a sea, directly facing the White Chapter Shore and Valley, commonly called Wolf Mountain.

**Zhu Ruzi**
In the Red Waters Mountains lived a Daoist practitioner named Zhu Ruzi. At the end of the Wu dynasty, he entered the mountains and consumed chrysanthemum flowers and tree fungi. Later, he encountered the Master of Western Return, who transmitted to him essential instructions and the method of internal visualization of the *niwan* (mud-pill). After thirty years, he could summon clouds and rain within his grotto chamber. On the fifth day of the eighth month in the first year of Emperor Mu’s *Yonghe* reign (345 CE), the Queen Mother of the West sent an envoy to welcome him. That same day, he ascended to heaven in a five-colored cloud chariot and now resides on the Terrace of Accumulated Stones. The Red Waters Mountain is said to lie a thousand *li* south of Yin County, three hundred *li* inward from the mouth of the Xi Creek. The mountain itself is entirely red, spanning fifty *li* in circumference and rising over a thousand *zhang* in height. This likely corresponds to the so-called Red Rock in the northeast of Yongjia in Linhai. The Red Mountain where Master Xu resided, also called Burning Mountain, is this same place.

**Yin Qianzi**
In the Huayin Mountains lived Daoist practitioners Yin Qianzi, Zhang Shisheng, and Li Fangbai, all contemporaries of Emperor Wu of the Jin. They received from the immortal Guan Chengzi the method of steaming elixirs and consuming tree fungi, and all partook of them to prolong life and strengthen their movements. They further received from Zhou Shouling of Sumen the Way of Consuming Rosy Clouds. After fifty years of practice, their concentrated minds turned inward, and they no longer required food or drink. Their bodies became light and robust, their complexions like those of children. On the twelfth day of the second month in the first year of Emperor Mu’s *Yonghe* reign (345 CE), the Supreme One dispatched an envoy to welcome them. That day, they ascended to heaven on clouds. Now on the Dark Continent, they received scriptures and were appointed as Perfected Ones of the Lofty Mountain, with Zhang Shisheng as the Earl of Eastern Source.

**Zheng Jingshi**
In the Qian Mountains of Lujiang lived Daoist practitioners Zheng Jingshi and Zhang Chonghua. Both received oral instructions from the immortal Meng Deran at the beginning of the Jin dynasty and entered the mountains to practice the method of Guarding the Five Viscera and Containing the Sun, along with consuming sesame and the Dark Elixir. Over time, they no longer required food or drink, their bodies became light and strong, and they transformed their former forms. On the nineteenth day of the fourth month in the first year of Emperor Mu’s *Yonghe* reign (345 CE), the Northern Dark Elder Supreme One welcomed them with a cloud palanquin, and they ascended to heaven in broad daylight. They now reside on the Dark Continent.

**Ping Zhongjie**
In the Kuocang Mountains lived a Daoist practitioner named Ping Zhongjie, a native of Hezhong.

During the Great Hu’s chaos in the Central Plains, Ping fled across the Yangtze and entered the Kuocang Mountains, where he received from Master Song the Way of the Mind-Mirror and the practice of the Hundred Spirits traversing the Grotto-Chambers. After forty-five years of such concentrated cultivation, his body grew younger and was filled with true qi. On the first day of the fifth month in the first year of Emperor Mu’s *Yonghe* reign (345 CE), the Central Yellow Elder dispatched an envoy to welcome him. That very day, he rode clouds and drove dragons, ascending to heaven in broad daylight. He now resides in the Cloud Terrace of the Canglang. The "Great Hu’s chaos" refers to the time of Liu Yuan and Liu Cong, while Shi Le was the "Lesser Hu."

**Wu Mu**
Wu Mu was a native of Chang’an. In his youth, he served as a county clerk, abusing his office to extort the people. When one of his victims brought suit against him, the law demanded his execution. Mu abandoned his post and fled deep into the mountains. After days without food, he came upon a stone chamber where Master Sun was secluded in study. The chamber was surrounded by fields of millet and sesame, and its stores were ever full. Mu begged for food and stayed for a month without leaving. Though Master Sun knew he was a fugitive, he did not question him, instead providing meals, tending to his needs, and reciting scriptures while expounding the Dao, speaking of fortune and misfortune. Upon hearing this, Mu’s heart opened and his mind awakened. He knocked his head to the ground, striking his chest in remorse, recounting the origins of his crimes, the deeds of his former life, and confessing his wrongs, pleading for a chance to reform. He remained in the stone chamber, sweeping and serving the master. After forty years, the master transmitted the Dao to him, and together they gathered herbs and consumed sesame. Through diligent cultivation of the scriptural teachings, he attained three hundred and twenty years of life before ingesting the elixir and ascending to heaven in broad daylight.

**Guo Jing**
Guo Jing was a native of Yingchuan.

Guo Jing lost his parents in childhood, with neither siblings nor kin, and lived in destitution, drifting without refuge. At sixteen, the county summoned him to serve as a minor official. Later, he committed an offense and fled into hiding, remaining concealed for two months without venturing out by day. He encountered Master Zheng, who saved and instructed him in the Dharma, exhorting him with teachings of transformation. Jing then followed Zheng, carrying his burdens and serving him for seven years without敢懈怠. He received the essential methods of Daoist guidance and ingestion, consuming mountain herbs and fuling, and lived for three hundred years. Later, on Tianwei Mountain, Master Chisong descended, and the two attained the true Dao. Today, they dwell as Perfected Ones in the Dayou Grotto.

**Fan Bocien**
Fan Bocien was a native of Guiyang. His family was originally of the scholar-gentry, but he suddenly fell into madness and demonic possession, developing a chronic ailment that confined him to his bed for over a year. He sought out physicians and exorcists, depleting his family’s wealth, yet his illness remained uncured. Hearing that the Great Dao was pure and required no expenditure, his resolve shifted. Learning that Shen Jing, a diligent Daoist, had effectively treated many illnesses, he abandoned his secular physicians and followed him. After fifty days, his ailments were entirely healed. Later, he met Lu Wanzhi and received the true inner Dao. Wanzhi could not enter the mountains, but Bocien, discontent with the world, bid farewell and retreated into Tianmu Mountain. Consuming sesame and cultivating with deep concentration for seventeen years, the Perfected Lord of the Great Grotto and Controller of Destiny descended, bestowing upon him the thirty-six-scroll scripture. Having ingested the returning elixir, he ascended to heaven in broad daylight and now serves as the Perfected One of Primordial Unity.

**Han Weiyuan**
The Perfected One of Jiuyi, Han Weiyuan, once received teachings from Song Dexuan of Mount Song. Dexuan lived during the reign of King Xuan of Zhou, attained the Dao through ingesting the *Lingfei Liujia*, and could traverse three thousand *li* in a single day. He could transform his shape into birds and beasts, mastering the Way of Mystic Numinosity, and now resides on Mount Song. Weiyuan followed him for many years before receiving the method. Having perfected the Dao in practice, he now dwells on Mount Jiuyi.

**Liu Shaoweng**
Long ago, there was Liu Shaoweng, who repeatedly entered Mount Taihua to pay homage and bow toward the mountain. After twenty years of this, one day he suddenly beheld the Venerable Elder of the Western Peak, who bestowed upon him the Dao of immortality.

*End of Scroll Seventeen of the Comprehensive Mirror of Perfected Immortals Who Embodied the Dao*

*Scroll Eighteen of the Comprehensive Mirror of Perfected Immortals Who Embodied the Dao*

**Celestial Master Zhang**
The Perfected Celestial Master bore the surname Zhang, with the personal name Daoling and the courtesy name Fuhan. A native of Pei’s Fengyi County, he was the eighth-generation descendant of Zhang Liang, the Marquis of Liu. When Liang first traveled to Xiapi, he encountered the Yellow Stone Elder, who transmitted to him the *Unadorned Writ*. Later, he followed Emperor Gao of Han and rendered meritorious service, for which he was enfeoffed as a marquis. Cultivating his true nature and abstaining from grains, he took Red Pine as his teacher and friend, receiving the esoteric method of "flying steps" from the Eastern Garden Elder. He was posthumously titled the Marquis of Literary Achievement. His hidden virtues and concealed deeds left a fragrant legacy for later generations.

He had a son named Buyi. Buyi’s second son was Gao; Gao’s son was Tong; Tong’s son was Wuwang; Wuwang’s son was Liren; Liren’s son was Jue; Jue’s son was Qi; Qi’s son was Dashun. The Perfected One was Dashun’s eldest son.

His mother once dreamed of a celestial being descending from the Dipper’s *Kui* star, over a *zhang* in height, clad in embroidered robes, who bestowed upon her a fragrant rose. Upon waking, her clothing and chamber were suffused with an extraordinary fragrance that lingered for months. Moved by this, she conceived and gave birth on the fifteenth day of the first month in the *jiawu* year of Jianwu 10 (34 CE), during the reign of Emperor Guangwu of the Eastern Han, in the Wudi region of Mount Tianmu. At the time, yellow clouds shrouded the house, purple *qi* filled the courtyard, and the chamber glowed with light like the sun and moon. The fragrance from the dream lingered for days before dissipating.

By the time he came of age, he stood nine *chi* and two *cun* tall, with towering brows, a broad forehead, green eyes, a vermilion crown, a high nose, a square jaw, and eyes bearing three pupils. His brow ridge extended into his skull, his jade-like occipital bone rose like a peak, his arms hung past his knees, and his beard was magnificent. He carried himself with the poise of a dragon and the stride of a tiger, broad below and tapering above, his presence commanding reverence. Even family and friends regarded him with solemn awe.

At seven, he read the *Two Chapters on the Dao and Virtue* over ten times and grasped their essence. He mastered the subtleties of astronomy, geography, and the *River Chart* and *Luo Writ* apocrypha, delving deeply into their mysteries. Well-versed in the Three Canons, nothing he perused escaped his comprehension. Over a thousand disciples studied under him. Thirty *li* south of Mount Tianmu and eighty *li* northwest, halls for lecturing and recitation stood—present-day Lin’an Immortal’s Abbey and Yuantong Immortal’s Abbey occupy those sites.

Later, he was recommended for the *Xianliang Fangzheng* examination, which tested upright speech and forthright remonstrance. One of the commendations read: "The Celestial Master is stern and upright by nature, profound in classical learning and refined in conduct, and has mastered the methods of Daoist cultivation." In the second year of Yongping (59 CE) during Emperor Ming’s reign, an imperial edict appointed him Magistrate of Jiangzhou in Bazhou, at the age of twenty-six. Though he held office, his heart remained set on refining his form and achieving lightness of body. After a time, he retired to seclusion in the northern mountains of Beimiu, where he cultivated his practice in Luoyang.

In the third year, a white tiger appeared, holding a talismanic text in its mouth and placing it beside his seat. The court summoned him to serve as *Erudite*, but he claimed illness and declined. When Emperor He ascended the throne, hearing of his mastery of the Dao, the emperor dispatched an envoy with a third-rank seal and cord, a four-horse carriage, and an appointment as Grand Mentor, later offering the title of Marquis of Jixian—yet he refused all three summons. To the messenger, he said: "Convey my gratitude to the Son of Heaven. A human life spans a hundred years, yet time slips by in an instant. Parents, wife, and children—how deep the bonds of love, yet how fleeting their constancy! Above the Nine Heavens lies the Realm of Nothingness, where the Golden Portal’s Celestial Lord has issued a decree to enlist me as his subject. If one but embraces purity and stillness, restraining desire, the world will govern itself—what need have I for office?" This occurred in the fourth year of *Yongyuan* (92 CE), the *renchen* year.

Thereafter, he departed from the Central Plains, drawn to the deep and verdant valleys of Shu. Concealing himself in those mountains, he practiced austerity, cultivated the Dao, conserved his *qi*, and nurtured his spirit. To his disciples, he declared: "From youth, I was devoted to study, delving deeply into the Six Classics—yet all are but tools for ordering the world. What weight do high rank and golden chariots hold compared to a single hair of this body? And even this body of flesh and bone—is it truly mine? It is but a transient aggregation of drifting dust. To refine the heart and temper the form, merging with the true Dao, then riding clouds and mounting dragons to ascend in broad daylight—is this not bliss? Human life is marked by partings and meetings, by birth and death. In death, the spirit fades into obscurity, never to return. Yet recall how the Yellow Emperor savored the Dao, or how Master Red Pine and Wang Qiao consumed the morning mist—both ascended in daylight, enduring for eternity. Is this not sublime? The ancients renounced the splendor of ten thousand chariots and the wealth of a thousand teams—surely they had good reason. Since I cannot both master the Dao and serve the world, let me follow my learning while time permits. Is this not fitting?

"Human emotions know no bounds: when gatherings reach their peak, they scatter; when joy reaches its height, sorrow follows. How can one escape this? I shall now wander mountains and seas, far from the dust of the world, dwelling in seclusion to pursue my studies. As I part from you, how do you feel?" Among his disciples, one named Wang Chang had studied astronomy and mastered the teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, remaining at his side. The Master then dispersed his followers, devoting himself to purity, emptiness, and detachment, severing all worldly ties. Wang Chang carried books and sang as they journeyed together to Yun Jin Mountain, where they took residence.

There, the Perfected One cultivated the profoundest Dao. Later, he followed the method to refine the Great Elixir of Dragon and Tiger. In the first year, a crimson glow illuminated his chamber. In the second, five-colored clouds enveloped the crucible; by night, no lamp was needed, for a coiled green dragon and white tiger constantly circled the alchemical vessel. In the third year, the elixir was complete. Though the Perfected One was over sixty, after consuming it, his appearance grew ever younger, resembling a man of thirty, his stride outpacing a galloping horse.

He also obtained esoteric texts and secret writs, enabling him to command mountains and summon the myriad spirits. One day, he said to Wang Chang: "The Five Peaks teem with immortals, and the Three Shu abound in famed mountains—shall we journey together?" They then traveled north to the cliffs and ridges of Mount Song, dwelling in a stone abode for several years. His concentrated meditation pierced the heavens, and a messenger in embroidered robes appeared, declaring: "Within the stone chamber of the Central Peak lies the *Inner Writings of the Three Sovereigns*, the *Nine Cauldrons of the Yellow Emperor*, and the *Great Clarity Scripture of the Golden Elixir*—whoever obtains and cultivates these shall ascend to heaven." Moved by these words, the Perfected One fasted for seven days, then entered the chamber. Wherever his feet trod, the ground resounded hollowly. He dug at the spot and indeed retrieved the alchemical texts, which he then received.

Then he once more sought the renowned mountains of the Western Limits—alternately called the Western Sea, for as the *Annals of Chengdu* records, when the gorges of the Yangzi were blocked, Shu became a western sea. The land abounded in marvels and rare treasures, so he entered Mount Yangping, where the Yangping Oratory stood in Jiulong County of Pengzhou. Through concentrated meditation and alchemical refinement, he gained the ability to soar in flight and hear at vast distances, mastering the arts of multiplying his form and dispersing his shadow, communicating with spirits, and transforming at will—sitting yet gone, standing yet vanished. Often he would drift in a boat upon the pond, recite scriptures in the hall, recline unseen before guests, or wander with a flowering staff, chanting verses. All these acts occurred simultaneously, yet none could fathom his divine marvels.

The Perfected One devoted himself solely to reciting the *Five Thousand Characters*, day and night without weariness. Later, he journeyed to Mount Xicheng, where he built an altar to invoke the Perfected Ones and summon the Five Thearchs. Suddenly, a villager reported: "Between Fangling and Xicheng in the west, there dwells a White Tiger Spirit who craves human blood, and each year the people sacrifice a life to it." The Perfected One summoned the spirit and admonished it, and it was destroyed. Another warned: "In Zizhou, a great serpent lurks in a mountain cavern; when it roars, the rocks tremble, and it spews poisonous mists. Travelers rarely survive three or five *li* before succumbing." The Perfected One restrained it with his arts, and it no longer wrought harm. As the *Annals of Mount Qingcheng* notes: "The Terrace of the Oath-Bound Dragon lies on the Peak of the Venerable One. In ancient times, a dragon’s lair there would flood fields each summer and autumn. The Heavenly Master erected a stone terrace to subdue the poisonous dragon and suppress the water demon."

On Mount Gezuo—where the Gezuo Oratory stood in Jiulong County of Pengzhou—he concealed himself in a cliffside abode, refining his *qi* and harmonizing his spirit. On Mount Qinzhong—where the Qinzhong Oratory stood in Deyang County of Hanzhou—he cultivated the *Nine Perfected Esoteric Methods*. On Mount Changli—where the Changli Oratory stood in Jintang County of Hanzhou—he gathered and ingested the Five Fungi and myriad herbs. On Mount Lishang—where the Lishang Oratory stood in Deyang County of Hanzhou—he first transmitted to his disciples the methods of nurturing the body and lightening its form. On Mount Yongquan—alternately called Mount Pinggang, where the Yongquan Oratory stood in Deyang County of Hanzhou and the Pinggang Oratory in Xinjin County of Shuzhou—he attained the arts of entering water and fire unscathed. Thus, he saved beings and aided creatures, accumulating hidden merit.

On Mount Zhenduo—where the Zhenduo Oratory stood in Deyang County of Hanzhou—he contemplated spirits and meditated upon the Perfected Ones. On Mount Beiping—also called Mount Dou, where the Dou Oratory stood in Xinjin County of Shuzhou—hundreds of fierce beasts roamed, yet they were tamed and lingered outside his door. On Mount Chougeng—where the Chougeng Oratory stood in Pengshan County of Meizhou—a withered old man transformed into a ferocious ghost to terrify him, but the Perfected One recited scriptures without heed, and the apparition retreated of its own accord. On Mount Heming—where the Heming Oratory stood in Dayi County of Yazhou—he ingested the *qi* of the Five Clouds. There, when the stone cranes cried, some ascended to heaven. Earlier, during the *Zhanghe* era, Emperor Zhang had inquired about the cranes’ cries. As the *Annals of Mount Qingcheng* records: "The Terrace of Sheep and Horses lies upon the cliffs of Redstone City. It is said that the Heavenly Master and ghosts carried stones like sheep and horses, or that when sheep and horses cried there, some ascended to heaven. When the Heavenly Master dwelt on Mount Heming, these sheep and horses cried frequently."

Later, he resided on Mount Quting. As the *Annals of Chengdu* notes: "At the Heavenly Master’s Abbey in Guangdu County, beneath the altar lay a well called the Ghost-Subduing Well, where malevolent spirits hid. During the decline of the Han, the boundary between humans and ghosts blurred, and in the region between Hanzhong and Shu, people suffered grievously. Just as the Heavenly Master received the Han court’s decree to dwell in the stone chamber of Quting in Shu, he commanded divine beings to transport the dark stones of Mount Qingcheng to seal the well. The demonic spirits were thus eradicated."

There, he refined the divine elixir of the Nine Cauldrons. After three years, the work neared completion, yet he dared not ingest it. He said to Wang Chang: "Those who would ascend to heaven must first extend their merit to living beings, aid the state and establish their lineage, promote benefit and eliminate harm—only then may they rise lightly, serving the Three Realms without shame. To seek profit for oneself alone, without merit reaching the people, is not the great Dao’s principle of vast salvation. I see that in Shu, serpent poisons and ghostly *qi* coil through the mountains and valleys, and the people, unaware, suffer in secret. I pity them deeply. Now I shall cultivate the transformation of purity and stillness, assist and exalt the great Dao, and nurture the common folk."

Thus, with concentrated thought, his spirit ascended to the Golden Gates of the Latter Sage. In the first year of Han’an of Emperor Shun’s reign, the *renwu* year, on the fifteenth day of the first month, beneath the bright moon of midnight, the Perfected One lay in deep slumber upon Mount Heming. The Lord Lao—also called the Lord of the Dao, for the Latter Sage of the Golden Gates, the Mysterious Primordial Lord of the Dao, is none other than Lord Lao—rode a chariot of flying clouds and green plough-oxen, halting at the southeast of the mountain. Turning to the assembled immortals, he said: "Daoling’s cultivation is arduous and bitter; I am moved by his resolve and shall bestow upon him the secret writings of bodily governance and the Dao of soaring immortality. Yet he has now fallen into rest, his spirit wandering beyond the world of things. You must not startle him; he will awaken of himself."

In his dream, the Perfected One saw a figure clad in armor of night-glowing luminance, crowned with a cap of celestial achievement, bearing the banner of the Three *Qi* of Life and Demons. The figure addressed him: "Ho, Daoling! Why does your heart grow weary? The Sage’s chariot has long awaited you." The dream dissolved, and the Perfected One suddenly started awake, pulling his sleeves and straightening his robes, suspecting some external evil had disturbed him. After a long moment, the jade pendants chimed softly, celestial music murmured faintly, fragrant blossoms blanketed the earth, and purple clouds filled the sky. Gazing eastward, he beheld above the purple clouds a plain chariot drawn by five white dragons. Twenty-four attendants in crimson robes and golden armor, wielding halberds, stood in ranks on either side, facing forward before the chariot. Jade maidens in flowered garments, their cloud-like hair cascading over their shoulders, each held a banner inscribed in gold with the words *Banner of Life and Demons*. Behind them stood two youths, their heads bound in blue cloth, jade rings dangling, trailing skirts, each bearing a tablet—one with a green dragon on the left, the other a white tiger on the right—golden plaques with vermilion script reading *Millstone for Summoning Immortals*. Further back, two more figures in crimson sleeves and golden armor each held a standard of the Three *Qi* and Ten Absolute Principles, its cinnabar plaque and plain script proclaiming *Standard of the Inverted Scene*. Before the chariot stood one in embroidered robes and jade crown, bearing the twin divine swords of *Three-Five Slaying Evil*, each inscribed with the patterns of stars, the sun, and the moon. To the chariot’s right stood another in rosy robes and golden crown, holding a jade seal inscribed *Seal of Merit for Governing the Yang-Ping District*. Countless other attendants and guards flanked them.

Above the plain chariot, nine-colored mist swirled gently. In an instant, the radiance cleared, revealing within the chariot a divine being whose countenance was like ice and jade, holding a five-fold luminous treasure fan, his neck bearing the eightfold halo of the Round Light, his body over six *zhang* in height. His divine radiance dazzled the eyes, making direct gaze impossible. One before the chariot called to the Perfected One: "Do not fear; this is the Most High Lord Lao." The Perfected One gathered his robes and bowed deeply, not daring to raise his eyes.

Lord Lao spoke: "Long ago, I descended upon the mountains of Shu and established the Twenty-Four Districts—*The Record of Chengdu* states: 'The Daoist scriptures speak of twenty-four districts corresponding to the twenty-four *qi*, with the sixty *jiazi* cycles distributed among them.' To avoid the taboo of Emperor Gaozong of Tang, they were later renamed 'transformations,' yet they remain the prisons beneath the Twenty-Eight Constellations, the offices of the Dark Registers of Yin Shadows, governing the life and death, sin and fortune of the human world. I pitied the souls of the lower realm, bound in suffering, their ancestors burdened by karmic transgressions, accumulating hidden grievances that cut short their lives and prevent them from attaining the Dao, all confined within these very prisons. I have since established courts of blessing, yet for countless kalpas, the celestial bureaucracy has been understaffed, its duties neglected. Recently, the blood-consuming spirits of the Six Heavens have seized and occupied them, blurring the boundaries of day and night, confounding humans and ghosts, wantonly harming the living, and inflicting unjust calamities—deeply lamentable. Why do you not rectify the perverse and restore the upright, distinguish between humans and ghosts, restore the proper order of day and night, and resume governance of these districts to bless the people? Your merit would then be boundless. I have seen your name inscribed upon the Cinnabar Terrace; you shall be a Perfected One, and thus I entrust this to you."

The Perfected One kowtowed and replied: "Daoling’s nature and understanding are dull and slow. Through ten thousand kalpas, I have been fortunate to encounter the great Dao, my dead soul reborn, my withered bones reclothed in flesh. I revere and embrace the Dao’s decree and shall diligently carry it out without slackening."

Lord Lao then summoned the Three-Five Merit Officers. In an instant, from the west arose a vigorous surge of five-colored *qi*, within which two immortals rode mounts of dragon and tiger, each several *zhang* in length, clad in black caps and crimson robes, bearing swords and jade tablets. One hundred twenty attendants, all in black-capped embroidered robes, wielding swords and halberds, advanced and bowed in attendance. Lord Lao said: "Are you the Three-Five Merit Officers? Swiftly open the Jade Palace of the Southern Purple Yang and the inner halls of the Jade Dawn, and retrieve the *Secret Writings of the Orthodox Unity Alliance and Might*. I wish to transmit them." In a brief moment, from the south arose the twenty-four *qi* of life, auspicious lights and propitious hues filling the sky. Within them, jade lads each bore a jade case containing one volume—all inscribed with jade tablets and golden script, along with the registers of merit and deeds—and presented them to the Perfected One.

Lord Lao said: "I grant you a term of a thousand days; our next meeting shall be in the Garden of Wen." He further bestowed upon the Perfected One the *Three Clarities’ Collected Scriptures* in nine hundred thirty volumes, the *Seventy-Two Scrolls of Talismans and Cinnabar Turtle Secret Methods*, the *One Thousand Two Hundred Official Petitions*, the twin swords—*The Record of Mount Qingcheng* states: "At the Altar of the Descended Swords, where the Lord of the Dao once conferred the Yin-Yang Swords upon the Heavenly Master, there remains a hidden sword cave"—the *Seal of Merit for Governing the Yang-Ping District*, the *Crown of the Intermingling of the Two Modes*, the *Robes for Driving Away Evil*, the *Fish-Scale Garment*, the *Square Skirt*, and *Vermilion Shoes*. He commanded him to establish regulations and assist the state in enacting transformation. "After a thousand days of practice, even evil spirits shall not dare to meet your gaze directly."

Upon completing the transmission of teachings, he retreated to Mount Heming to study and savor the secret texts, following their methods in practice. After a thousand days of cultivation, he could inwardly perceive his five viscera and outwardly gather the thirty-six thousand spirits. Moreover, he was visited by the Jade Maiden of Pure Harmony, who instructed him in the art of exhaling and inhaling the qi of pure harmony, subduing wayward essences and malevolent forces. He mastered the Way of the Three Steps and Nine Paces from the scriptures, as well as the path of treading the Dipper and intersecting the Qian hexagram. Thus, the Seven Origins of the Northern Dipper manifested before him, and wherever his troops pointed, he could conceal or reveal himself at will, all occurring naturally.

Thereupon, in accordance with the divine mandate, he waged war against the ghosts in Shu. At that time, eight ghostly marshals, each leading ghostly legions numbering in the tens of millions, roamed among humanity. Liu Yuanda commanded ghosts that caused miscellaneous illnesses; Zhang Yuanbo, those that spread pestilence; Zhao Gongming, those that induced dysentery; Zhong Ziji, those that caused ulcers and swellings; Shi Wenye, those that brought sudden sweats and malarial chills; Fan Juqing, those that inflicted aches and pains; Yao Gongbo, those that wielded the Five Poisons; and Li Gongzhong, those that provoked madness, demonic possession, and red eyes. All were perverse qi of the Five Phases, harbingers of calamity and misfortune. They changed their names with the seasons: in the east, they were called Demon Kings; in the south, Ghost Marshals; in the west, Heterodox Ways; in the north, Ghost Lords; and in the center, Spirit-Ghosts.

During the three months of spring, when the hundred birds cried out, they became the ghosts of the Five Graves, offering curses and invocations. By autumn, they transformed into the ghosts of ancestral earth, household earth lords, dwelling dragons, and lingering corpses. In winter, they became the ghosts of tombs and graves, attacking and devouring the living. Following the monthly cyclical signs, they took form in the womb, sometimes appearing as beasts, exhaling poison and howling calamity, violently slaughtering countless people and cutting short innumerable lives.

These eight ghostly marshals led their ghostly hosts to dwell atop Mount Qingcheng in western Shu, where they had a ghostly city and ghostly market. There, they assumed various forms, mingling among humanity, spreading pestilential sands, unbeknownst to mortals. Humans and ghosts intermingled, trading goods and profits. On the first day of the seventh month in the second year of the Han’an era, the Perfected One, bearing the secret registers of the Covenant of Might, journeyed to Mount Qingcheng—*The Record of Mount Qingcheng* states: "There is a Dragon Palace stone chamber, where the Heavenly Master cultivated the Dao." *The Old唐书* notes: "In Qingcheng County of Shuzhou, there is Mount Qingcheng." He set up a throne of glassy azure, with the Great Dao’s Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Origin on the left and the Thirty-Six Divisions of Perfected Scriptures on the right. He erected the Ten Absolute Spirit Talismans around the ritual mat, sounded the bells and struck the chime stones, burned incense, performed the Dao, and recited the scriptures of the *Dao* and *Virtue*. He deployed the divine troops of the Dragon and Tiger in the city.

The ghostly hosts then brandished weapons, arrows, and stones, advancing to harm the Perfected One. With a single gesture of his hand, he transformed his finger into a great lotus flower to repel them. The ghostly legions bore over a thousand torches of fire, but when the Perfected One raised his hand and pointed, the ghosts set themselves ablaze, unable to advance. From afar, they cried out to the Perfected One: "Master, you dwell on Mount Emei—*Tang Jia Prefecture has Emei County*—why have you come to seize our dwelling? Descend the mountain swiftly, or we shall surely kill you."

The Perfected One replied: "You are cruel and venomous, harming all living beings. Therefore, I shall not allow you to remain here. You shall be banished to the barren lands of the west." Upon hearing this, Yuanda and the others summoned the ghostly marshals and their troops, each amassing millions, clad in fine armor and rhinoceros-blade weapons, surrounding the mountain. Wang Chang, alarmed, entreated the Perfected One: "The Demon Kings and their legions have come. What strategy shall we employ?"

The Perfected One smiled and said: "Why fear such petty ghosts? Bring me the cinnabar brush." Wang Chang presented it, and the Perfected One, wielding the brush, drew in the air toward the ghostly ranks. Instantly, all perished; the lesser marshals and officers collapsed in unison, while the eight great ghost kings lay prostrate, knocking their heads and slapping their cheeks, begging for their lives. The Perfected One remained silent for a long while, then reversed the brushstroke, and the ghostly hosts revived.

He then summoned the ghost kings, saying: "Come forward. I have instructions for you." The ghost kings approached and stood before him. The Perfected One declared: "You must swiftly retreat and henceforth cease spreading illness and wantonly harming lives. The common people are all my disciples and kin. If you disobey, I shall exterminate you without mercy." The ghost kings replied: "The people of the world originally belonged to us. Why do you seek to take them all? At least grant us half." The Perfected One refused and rebuked them.

The ghost kings then assembled the six great demon kings, leading a million ghostly troops to attack once more, encircling the mountain. Wang Chang said: "The ghostly hosts are overwhelming. What shall we do?" The Perfected One laughed and said: "Do not fear. I shall command them myself." Again, he drew with the cinnabar brush, and all the ghosts perished. Only the Six Heavenly Demon Kings lay prone, unable to rise, knocking their heads and slapping their cheeks, begging for their lives before departing. The Perfected One paid them no heed. With another stroke of the cinnabar brush, the mountain split in two, cleaving the sky and piercing the springs—*The Record of Mount Qingcheng* states: "The mountain has an Oath Stone, where the Heavenly Master swore an oath with the ghosts. With a cinnabar brush, he drew a line across the mountain’s sheer cliffs, a crimson mark two *cun* wide and a *zhang* deep, six or seven *zhang* in length." It also notes: "The Ghost-Restraining Brush’s edge lies beside the Great Dragon Bridge, where the Heavenly Master subdued ghosts and spirits with the Orthodox Unity’s methods, swearing: 'Humans live by day; ghosts move by night. Yin and Yang are distinct, each governed by its own office. Those who violate this shall be punished by the Orthodox Unity’s laws without mercy.'"

The ghostly troops, unable to cross, wailed piteously. From then on, they vowed never to return, begging to dwell in the western land of Bāluka. The Perfected One relented and granted permission. With another stroke of the brush, the eight marshals and six demon kings revived. He summoned them forward, but they could not advance. The Perfected One then ordered Wang Chang to shoulder a great stone to form a bridge, allowing the ghost kings to cross. Only then did they approach, standing in attendance with hands clasped.

The Perfected One addressed them: "If you can split this stone with your brush, I shall grant you a share of the people. If you cannot, flee ten thousand *li* at once." Yuanda and the others took the brush and drew upon the stone, but it remained unbroken—*The Record of Mount Qingcheng* states: "Behind the Yinxuan Abbey lies the Trial Brush’s Edge, where the Demon-Subduing Stone of Ritual Law stands."

Though the ghostly hosts had been subdued, the Perfected One sought to fully subdue their hearts as well. He addressed them: "Since you wish to share the people with me, let each of us exhaust our powers to determine victory."

Yuanda and the others replied, "We shall obey your command."

The Perfected One cast himself into a great fire, emerging with his feet treading upon a blue lotus; when the ghostly marshals leapt in, they were consumed by the flames. The Perfected One entered a tree, his body passing beyond its bounds as the wood closed behind him; when the ghostly marshals threw themselves in, they fell to the ground. The Perfected One entered water, riding forth upon a yellow dragon; when the ghostly marshals plunged in, they were drowned by the waves. The Perfected One entered stone, emerging through its other side; when the ghostly marshals cast themselves in, they penetrated but an inch. The Perfected One entered an iron mountain, passing through its depths; when the ghostly marshals attempted the same, they barely breached half an inch.

The Perfected One intoned a divine talisman, and with a gesture of his left hand, the ghosts perished; with a gesture of his right, they revived. When the ghostly marshals raised their hands to do the same, the dead did not return to life. Yuanda and the others then transformed into eight great tigers, roaring and lunging forward. The Perfected One became two lions, pursuing them until they fled in terror. The ghostly marshals next transformed into eight great dragons, seeking to seize the master, but the Perfected One became a golden-winged roc, pecking out the dragons’ eyes, and they scattered in flight. They then took the form of a colossal deity, Nie Zui, who let out a thunderous roar, wielding a massive mace to strike the Perfected One. The Perfected One transformed into a vajra, his body towering seventy-two *wan* in height and fifty-two *wan* in girth, crowned with a great diadem and bearing a halo of radiance. He stood upon a lotus throne, adorned with twelve boundless marks. With a single staff, fist, or gesture, the great deity retreated in defeat.

When the ghostly marshals leapt twelve *zhang* into the air, they fell back down; the Perfected One soared over a hundred *zhang* high, with nothing above to grasp and nothing below to bear him. The ghostly marshals conjured five-colored clouds, darkening heaven and earth so that no light could be seen. The Perfected One transformed into a five-hued auspicious sun, its blazing radiance scattering the clouds. The ghostly marshals exhausted every transformation, yet could do no more.

The Perfected One then manifested a great stone, weighing over a thousand *jin*, suspended by a lotus-fiber thread above the ghostly marshals’ encampment. He commanded two rats to gnaw at the thread, threatening to crush the host below. With no escape, the ghostly marshals cried out in unison, begging for their lives and vowing to flee far away, never again to harm the living.

Thereupon, the Perfected One summoned the gods of the five directions, the eight divisions, and the six heavens to convene an oath at the Yellow Emperor’s altar on Mount Qingcheng. He decreed that humans would dwell in the realm of brightness while ghosts would wander in darkness, commanding the six heavenly ghost kings to return to Beideng and the eight divisions of ghostly marshals to scatter into the Western Regions. The poisons of the five phases were also restrained and released.

Taking up his cinnabar brush, he declared: "Wherever my brush points, the ghostly hosts shall be annihilated." Yet in essence, he sought not to exterminate their kind entirely, but to separate the governance of humans and ghosts, dividing the realms of light and shadow. He swore a covenant with them, breaking a stone to serve as a contract, carving upon it the forms of heaven and earth, sun and moon. Upon the sheer cliff above the Yellow Emperor’s altar—*The Record of Mount Qingcheng* states: "On Mount Qingcheng stands the Stone Heaven and Earth, round above and square below, twelve *chi* in breadth, with twelve corners. There are also the Stone Sun and Moon, each five *zhang* wide and one *zhang* two *cun* thick, standing opposite one another upon pillars, their forms of crow and hare resplendent, their roundness and squareness, thickness and thinness plainly visible." *The Record of Mount Qingcheng* further notes: "The Master of Heaven’s oath with the ghosts upon the Stone Heaven and Earth, Stone Sun and Moon, decreed that only when the sun, moon, heaven, and earth shone anew would they regain human form." *The Record of Chengdu* adds: "Before the Zhaoqing Abbey on Mount Qingcheng stand the Five Talisman Steles, carved by the Heavenly Master to bind ghostly spirits. Today, a separate stone stele stands before the Yuju Abbey."

Another version states: Upon the Plain of Gang in the mountains, the Perfected One eradicated the residual *qi* of the Six Heavens, inscribing an oath upon stone: "When heaven and earth unite and the sun and moon conjoin, if you dare act again, you shall be utterly exterminated, leaving no trace." He then sealed the ghostly encampments with a divine seal, cutting off all communication between them.

After the oath, the ghostly hosts lingered, unwilling to depart. The Perfected One uttered a divine talisman, which flew into the highest heavens. At once, wind and rain, celestial immortals, heavenly soldiers, and wind blades descended. The ghosts vanished without a trace, fleeing in terror. Thus, the fourteen battles against the ghosts were won, their lairs swept clean, and their dark prisons seized. Twenty-four blessed courts were established, along with twenty-four officials of the netherworld, and the upright *qi* of the twenty-eight constellations was summoned to connect with the earth—another version states: "He also established twenty-four *zhi* in the Gongmu Mountains, further refining the twenty-four *qi* of the mountains to harmonize with the Great Dao, restoring the halls of tranquility." The Gongmu *zhi* was located in Shiyu County of Hanzhou, while the Further Refining *zhi* was in Mianzhu County of Hanzhou.

For each *zhi*, one netherworld official and one immortal official were appointed to oversee the merits and transgressions of the living. Those who performed good deeds, cultivated conduct, held fasts, set up offerings, submitted memorials, offered prayers, or sought blessings for their ancestors would have their merits recorded by the immortal officials and reported to the celestial palaces, thereby increasing their fortune and longevity. Conversely, those who were unfilial, disloyal, deceitful, or cruel, persisting in evil without repentance, would have their sins recorded by the netherworld officials and reported to the earthly courts, diminishing their fortune and longevity, or even severing their lineage. Thus, the retribution for good and evil followed as swiftly as shadow and echo.

Having propagated the teachings of the Orthodox Unity, the Perfected One subdued thirty-six thousand kinds of heretical demons and evil spirits, eradicating falsehood and deceit. The people unanimously accepted him as their master, with tens of thousands of households becoming his disciples. He appointed various *jijiu* to oversee the populace, much like government officials. Regulations were established, requiring the people to contribute grain, silk, utensils, paper, mats, firewood, and other supplies as needed, storing them for rituals, offerings, and the aid of travelers. The people followed his teachings without daring to deceive or steal.

He instructed them to build bridges, repair roads, and dig public wells, calling these acts of merit.

Should any prefectural or county officials or common folk fall ill, they would present a written petition to the Perfected One. He would examine the petitioner’s transgressions, listing two offenses, and command them to hold purification rites and offerings, to make amends through almsgiving, and thus their illness would be cured. He further instructed officials to govern with integrity and diligence, sparing the use of punishments. The people of Shu, in awe of retribution, turned from wrongdoing, and banditry ceased. No blight or pestilence afflicted the land—all was the transformative power of the Heavenly Master.

The Perfected One then arrived at Cloud Terrace Mountain in Cangxi County (the Cloud Terrace Abbey lay in Xixian of Liangzhou). According to the *Tang Book*, Junxi County of Minzhou had a Cloud Terrace Mountain, where he beheld its extraordinary landscape, its peaks arrayed in homage, its earth free of malevolent forces. He said to Wang Chang, “This mountain shall be the place of my ascension and transcendence.” There he chose his dwelling to cultivate the arts of the Ninefold Return and Sevenfold Reversion, focusing his mind solely on the Great Dao.

After forty-nine days, he once more heard the celestial music of jade chimes and carriages from days past. The Perfected One straightened his robes and prostrated himself, whereupon he saw the Lord Lao as before, attended by a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, descending from the void. For a long while, they hovered without alighting. The Perfected One bowed again, weeping and leaping in grief, saying, “Your servant once reflected that, having long basked in your sacred grace and received your secret texts, I followed heaven’s decree, battled demons, and spread the teachings. My work complete, I retired to seclusion. Now, as your august carriage returns, you do not descend to me—does this mean the Great Dao has forsaken your servant, and I am but a hollow husk?”

He raised his hands and cast himself to the ground. The Lord Lao then commanded his messenger to declare: “Your merits have earned you the rank of a Ninefold Perfected Upper Immortal. I sent you to Shu to wrest the ghostly nether-prisons, to distinguish between humans and spirits, and to spread the teachings of purity and tranquility. Yet you have slain ghosts excessively, summoned wind and rain at will, commanded spirits and gods, driven the stars in their courses, shaken mountains and rivers, darkened the sunlit sky, and polluted the air with killing intent—this is not the Great Dao’s love of life. The Celestial Emperor has rebuked you for these transgressions, and thus I cannot draw near you. I am unable to assess your merits; you must withdraw into the world of men and await the Sovereign of the Lower Prime. Then I shall plead your case to absolve your grave faults.”

The Perfected One wept bitterly, begging to die that very day. The Lord Lao spoke again: “Close your eyes and bind your gaze.” Thereupon he saw a figure in yellow robes with black sashes, bearing a jade casket containing three plain silk scrolls, titled *The Three Eights: Atonement, Erasure of the Black Ledger, and the Chapters of Transcending the Mysterious Ancestors*. The Perfected One bowed twice and received them. The Lord Lao instructed: “Diligently perform rites of atonement to the twenty-eight lunar lodges, the twenty-four solar terms, and the lords of yin, yang, and destiny. When your sins are erased from the Black Ledger, your name will ascend to the Purple Clarity, and your seven ancestors and nine forebears shall together become Upper Immortals. After atoning, you must further cultivate for three thousand six hundred days, and I shall await you in the Land of Nothing-Whatever, within the Eightfold Radiance Palace of the Upper Clarity.”

With these words, the sacred carriage departed. The Perfected One followed the instructions, leading his disciples to Crane Cry Mountain, where he built an altar to perform rites for the sun and moon. On the Three Primes, the eight festivals, his own destiny days, the beding and jiazi cycles, the three assemblies, and the five seasonal fasts, he held purification rites, set up offerings, recited scriptures, lit lamps, and repented before the sun, moon, and stars, heaven and earth, yin and yang, and the sins of his nine forebears and seven ancestors. After three years, his mysterious ancestors ascended to heaven.

His disciples gathered once more for several days, then together they went to the Registrar’s Mountain (the Registrar’s Abbey lay in Pujiang County of Nazhou). There, his hidden merits became renowned, and myriad auspicious signs manifested. One night, a divine being presented him with a jade disk, saying, “The host of immortals sends me to illuminate your dwelling at Original Bamboo Mountain (the Original Bamboo Abbey lay in Xinjin County of Shuzhou). The Perfected Ones have bestowed upon you the *Upper Scripture of the Numinous Treasure* at Mount Mengqin (the Mengqin Abbey lay in Taideng County of Kuizhou).”

A divine messenger summoned the Perfected One by night to accompany him, and after three days, he returned. He then led his disciples to Queting Mountain. At that time, dozens followed him. One day, he addressed his disciples: “My disciples, I thank you for your diligent service. Yet your worldly attachments remain unsevered, and you cannot yet renounce the mortal realm. You may learn my arts of circulating qi and guiding the body, or perhaps the methods of consuming herbs and plants in their hundreds. Your karmic burden is heavy, and your blessings thin—you cannot yet swiftly attain the Dao. After three more lifetimes, you may meet me again. Now, depart.”

Then he pointed to Wang Chang and said: “Only you, having cultivated goodness over many lifetimes, may now achieve perfection.”

He added: “In the east, there is a man named Xiao Yue who shall likewise ascend in flight. Though he comes from a thousand *li* away, he will arrive on the seventh day of the first month next year.” He described in full his height, build, and complexion.

When the appointed day came, the Perfected One said: “The sun nears noon—surely Master Zhao has arrived.” No sooner had he spoken than the man appeared, matching every detail as foretold. The disciples reported this, and the Perfected One said: “Ah, this man has come—but he may not yet be admitted at once.” He subjected him to seven trials.

First, he refused to receive him, sending servants to spit and revile him, yet Xiao Yue did not leave. He endured forty days of open-air lodging, his resolve only growing firmer, until at last the Perfected One granted him an audience. Next, he was sent into the mountains to guard millet and drive off beasts. That evening, a beautiful woman appeared, claiming to be a traveler caught by nightfall and seeking shelter. Xiao Yue shared her mat but sat upright until dawn. The following day, she feigned a lame foot to linger, then adorned herself and attempted to seduce him, yet he never strayed from rectitude.

Later, while walking along the path, he came upon dozens of gold cakes left behind, but passed them by without taking any. He was then ordered to gather firewood, whereupon three tigers roared and charged before him. Unperturbed, Xiao Yue said: “I have journeyed far to seek the deathless Dao from a sage—are you mountain spirits testing me?” The tigers then departed. Finally, he was sent to a shop to purchase silk. Though he paid in full, the merchant falsely accused him of failing to settle the debt.

Xiao Yue made no dispute, instead selling his clothes to repay the debt. He was then ordered to guard the rice fields, where a man in tattered robes, emaciated and covered in sores, his skin ulcerated and his breath foul, knelt to beg for food. Xiao Yue’s heart was moved, and he removed his own garments to clothe the man, giving him rice and leaving him the rest of his provisions. After six trials—each designed to stir the heart or provoke emotion—Xiao Yue remained steadfast in his resolve, his mind unwavering.

The Perfected One then led them to the summit of Cloud Terrace, a sheer cliff where he wandered freely, chanting and tasting the wind, gazing down into an abyss of ten thousand fathoms. A peach tree grew from the precipice, its fruit most extraordinary. The Perfected One addressed his disciples: “Whoever can retrieve this fruit shall be taught the Dao.” Over two hundred disciples leaned forward to peer down, but all trembled in fear, their bodies drenched in cold sweat, and they pleaded, “This peach cannot be obtained.” Only Xiao Yue stepped forward and said, “With the sagely master’s protection, what peril could there be? As long as the master lives, he will not let me fall into this ravine. If my destiny permits instruction, then this peach can be plucked.” With that, he cast himself downward, landing precisely upon the peach tree without stumbling, and gathered an armful of fruit. Clinging to the green stone wall, he found no way to ascend, so he tossed the peaches upward—over two hundred in all. The Perfected One divided the fruit among the disciples, keeping one for Xiao Yue, then reached down over the ravine to pull him up. The others saw that his arm did not lengthen, yet the Perfected One, with a gentle tug, drew him up and said, “Xiao Yue obtained the peaches through the steadfastness of his heart, avoiding a fatal fall. Now, I shall test myself by leaping down—I should surely gather even more peaches.” The disciples all protested, but only Xiao Yue and Chang remained silent. The Perfected One then cast himself down and vanished. After a long while, with no sign of his return, the disciples were struck with dread. Xiao Yue and Chang remained silent for a time before saying, “The master is like a father to us. Now that he has departed, where shall we go?” With that, they both leapt into the ravine, landing before the master. There they saw the Perfected One seated in a jeweled forest beneath a canopy of precious silk, upon a seven-jeweled terrace, his eyes closed in meditation. He smiled and said, “I knew you two would come.” He then bestowed upon them divine elixirs and secret scriptures of profound wisdom. The other disciples waited atop the cliff for two days before scattering.

The Perfected One returned with Wang and Zhao to the central realm three days later. One day, while leading his disciples afar, he saw a white vapor rising from Yang Mountain, stretching to the heavens. He said to Chang and Xiao Yue, “There must be a demonic presence there. We shall go and eliminate it.” Upon arriving, they encountered twelve divine maidens before the mountain, their forms enchanting and alluring. The Perfected One questioned them, and the maidens replied, “We are the yin spirits of this land.” The Perfected One then asked where the salt spring was, and the maidens answered, “Ahead lies a great pool where a poisonous dragon dwells. Though you summon it with your arts, it will not emerge.” The Perfected One inscribed a talisman, which transformed into a golden-winged phoenix. It circled above, crying out, and the dragon, seized with terror, abandoned the pool and fled. The waters receded, revealing the salt spring, which they boiled into salt. The golden-winged phoenix alighted upon the southern mountain, and later generations called it Phoenix Terrace, where to this day no birds or beasts dare perch.

The twelve divine maidens each presented a jade bracelet, saying, “We wish to serve you as your humble attendants.” The Perfected One accepted the bracelets, and with a gesture of his hand, the twelve merged into one. He said, “I shall cast this bracelet into the well. Whoever retrieves it shall be my destined companion.” Hearing this, the maidens stripped off their garments and plunged into the well, scrambling to seize the jade bracelet. The Perfected One then sealed the well, swearing an oath: “Henceforth, you shall be well spirits. You may not emerge again, lest you bring harm to the living.” As the Perfected One refined the salt spring, a hunter arrived. The Perfected One admonished him for his fondness for killing and taught him the method of boiling salt. The well was five hundred and forty feet deep and ten feet wide, yielding over forty measures of brine daily, bringing great profit.

The Perfected One then pointed to the northwest mountain and said, “This place is fit for building a city.” He then indicated the land south of the city: “Here, where the rivers and mountains pay homage, a blessed sanctuary may be established.” Later generations, moved by the Perfected One’s words, built a shrine there, and to this day, offerings and prayers continue without end.

The Perfected One took Xiao Yue and Chang to reside in Ban Valley. One day, lost in thought, he said to them, “When I took the divine maidens’ garments, I feared they might reclaim them and bring harm to the people.” He then returned to the place, hiding the clothes in a stone chamber atop a high peak, commanding the earth spirits to guard them. This is the Flame Sun Grotto, and to this day, the people of that region remain free from the maidens’ harm while enjoying the benefits of the salt well. Later, the place was named in honor of the Perfected One’s deeds, and it is now Lingzhou. In the salt marshes of Shu, shrines to the Lord of Qinghe were established nearby—Qinghe being a prefecture of the Zhang clan.

At the foot of the mountain, there were no rivers or wells, and the people suffered from a lack of water. The Perfected One plunged his divine sword into the earth, and a well sprang forth. He set spirits to guard it, ensuring its waters would never fail. The Perfected One then said to Xiao Yue and Chang, “This mountain is full of cliffs, and people dwell here. I fear the rocks may fall and harm them.” He summoned the mountain spirits and bound them by oath to spare the people.

The Perfected One and his disciples crossed the Song River, where many strange creatures harmed the people. He placed a stone casket in the river, recording the names of the malevolent spirits and summoning them with his arts, sealing them within. He then inscribed a great talisman of mountain script to suppress them, and the monstrosities ceased. Later generations called it the *Bingui Talisman*, and when the waters receded, people often saw it. They would copy it and keep it in their homes to ward off evil.

The Perfected One then led Xiao Yue and Chang to Crane Cry Mountain. At midday, they suddenly saw a man in vermilion robes with a blue sash, wearing slippers and holding a tablet. Beside him was another man in black silk, girded with a sword, bearing a jade casket. The vermilion-clad messenger approached and said, “By command of the Supreme Clarity, a true talisman summons the Perfected One to wander the Ban Gardens.” In an instant, from the northeast appeared fourteen attendants, riding dragons, tigers, simurghs, cranes, tortoises, scaled creatures, fish, and crows. They bore standards and banners, with a procession of thousands of chariots and ten thousand riders—lions, apotropaic beasts, celestial soldiers, and countless mounted officials—all come to welcome the Perfected One.

Next, a black dragon drew a purple chariot, and two jade maidens escorted the Perfected One to mount it. In an instant, they arrived at the palace gates, where a placard above read: *Gate of the Supreme Mystery Capital’s Orthodox Unity Perfected One*. Upon the Perfected One’s arrival, the assembled immortals bowed in reverence.

After some time, two black-robed officials bearing celestial talismans, girded with swords, and holding registers of destinies approached. The documents stated that the records of the Perfected One’s ancestors had been elevated, and all were now enrolled in the Vermilion Mound Prefecture. Having concluded his duties, the Perfected One led his disciples to reside in a stone chamber on Queting Mountain, where they cultivated the qi of the Grand Perfection.

One day, two azure lads led a host of immortals, all clad in vermilion robes and bearing crimson standards, who announced: “The Venerable Lord has arrived.” Among them stood a figure over ten feet tall, with silver hair and a ruddy complexion, a halo of radiance crowning his head. Two attendants, appearing no older than twenty, accompanied him. Some pointed and said, “This is Master Zhang Liang, and this is Master Yan Hui.”

After a moment, a jade-green chariot was brought forth, and two others assisted the Perfected One into it. They soared into the heavens and arrived at a place where towering terraces and palaces rose, their steps of gold and jade. Someone told the Perfected One, “You are to pay homage to the Most High Primordial Heavenly Worthy.” The Perfected One adjusted his robes and hastened forward, but the radiant halo above the hall was too dazzling to gaze upon directly. A voice explained: “To the left stands the Most Supreme Lord of the Great Dao; to the right, the Perfected One of the Supreme Ultimate; before him, the Lady of the Void and Subtle; and behind, the Most High Perfected One.” Golden lads and jade maidens attended with incense and scattered blossoms, while the Wondrous Conduct Perfected Ones held scriptures and bowed, stepping forward to form ranks.

The assembly of immortals declared: “Today, you have all attained perfection. By your single thought, the karmic entanglements of ten thousand kalpas have been extinguished in this moment.” After some time, a green lad from the hall conveyed to the Perfected One the methods of the Orthodox Unity Alliance of Might, charging him to transmit them through the ages, to serve as a teacher of humans and gods. He was then invested as the Great Master of the Supreme Mystery Capital’s Orthodox Unity, Pacifier of the Three Black Heavens, Supporter of the Dao, and Assistant to the Primordial, and exhorted to return to the mortal realm to awaken the unawakened. The time of his ascension was also secretly revealed to him.

Having received his mandate, the Perfected One returned to the Red Stone Cliff abode on Queting Mountain. There, he transmitted the Three Heavens’ Orthodox Unity esoteric methods to Chang and Sheng, instructing them to present themselves for testing in the mountains behind the city. At Jade Bureau Mountain, he imparted secret instructions to Sheng and Chang. (The rear-city retreat was located in Shiyu County of Hanzhou.) He later expounded the teachings in the Li Yuan Mountains (Li Yuan retreat in Jiulong County of Pengzhou), then returned to Yangping Mountain, where he entrusted his successor with the methods of light-ascent for immortals.

He next entered Lutang Mountain (Lutang retreat in Mianzhu County of Hanzhou), where he refined the Nine-Cauldron divine elixir, then moved to Pinggai Mountain (Pinggai retreat in Xinjin County of Shuzhou) to compound the Great Nine-Splendor Medicine.

At that time, two masters of restraint and qi-binding, Yao and Xu, who could summon the spirits of local shrines, reverse funeral processions, and revive the dead, roamed the Nine Provinces with legions of spectral soldiers and tens of thousands of ghostly cavalry. Hearing of the Master’s presence in Shu, they sought an audience, declaring: “The Great Dao is but a single qi. Among spirits and numina, is there truly high or low? We command the eight directions and a hundred million yin soldiers. Even if you possess the Dao, what can you do to us?” They ordered their followers to assemble outside the gate, but the Perfected One refused them entry. Turning to Chang and Sheng, he said: “These are the heterodox deities of the Six Heavens; they should not meet with the orthodox qi.” He commanded them to stand by the roadside for three days and nights without moving.

His disciples, puzzled, questioned him, and the Perfected One replied: “They have come with a host of malevolent spirits to test me. Having them stand outside the gate causes them no real harm.” Yao and Xu cried out: “We heard the Master possessed the Dao, so we came seeking an audience. Not only were we denied entry, but we have been made to stand here for so long—what crime have we committed?” The Perfected One then instructed his disciples to tell them: “Today, I pardon you and will not inquire into your past offenses.” Only then were they permitted to depart.

The Perfected One led his disciples back to Mount Heming. On the seventh day of the first month in the first year of Yongshou of Emperor Huan’s reign (the year *yiwei*), at the fifth watch of the night, Chang and Sheng saw a celestial immortal official riding through the sky, driving a cloud chariot. He lingered in the southeast of the mountain and cried aloud: “Zhang Daoling’s merits and conduct are now complete; he shall be conferred with the secret registers.” As his words faded, Lord Lao arrived in a dragon-drawn carriage, while the Perfected One rode a white crane, meeting at the foot of Chengdu beneath Mount Quting.

When Lord Lao arrived together with him, the myriad spirits came forth in grand welcome. A jade platform, over a *zhang* in height, emerged from the earth. The platform was established in Yizhou’s Chengdu County—what is now the Jade Platform Abbey. Lord Lao ascended the seat and once more transmitted the essentials of the Dao to the Perfected One, reiterating the principles of the Orthodox Unity and Alliance of Powers. He expounded the *Scripture of the Northern Dipper for Prolonging Life*. On the fifteenth day, the Shangyuan Festival, they met again in Chengdu, where he taught the *Scripture of the Southern Dipper* and expounded various other scriptures.

After the Perfected One had heard all, Lord Lao departed, and the jade platform dissolved, leaving an empty cavern. The *Records of Chengdu* states: “After Lord Lao’s departure, the seat sank into the earth, forming a deep cave that connected with the fifth cavern of Mount Qingcheng.” Daoling, however, deemed the jade platform’s alignment with the Ghost Star inauspicious, fearing it would disrupt the *fenye* (territorial correspondences) if the cave were left open to the qi. Thus, he sealed it with stone and blade.

The Perfected One then proceeded to Lutang Abbey, where he summoned the Four Guardian Deities of the Year, the Five Peaks and Four Seas, the deities of soil and grain, and all the immortals, who assembled in full. Before the mountain stood a stone spire, over a *zhang* tall. The Perfected One lifted it and swore an oath before the gathered spirits: “The Supreme Lord has commanded me to bind you by this vow: uphold the true Dao, cherish life and abhor killing, aid the state and pacify the people. Those who disobey shall be punished by the myriad spirits.” He then cast the stone spire down the cliff, where it stood erect beside the abbey.

Thereafter, he established the ranks of the thirty-six *jinglu* (serene hermitages), seventy-two *fudi* (blessed lands), and three hundred sixty sacred mountains, each assigned a presiding deity, mirroring the governance of commanderies and counties in the mortal realm. He then led Sheng and Chang to Yuntai Abbey, where in the northwest corner they built an altar and installed a furnace to refine the Great Elixir. Upon its completion, he consumed it, bathed in water, and a divine radiance spanned the heavens.

In the second year of Yongshou (*bingshen*), the Perfected One, deeming his work accomplished and his Dao manifest, leapt from the mid-cliff of the abbey into the stone wall, emerging from the summit, thus forming two caverns. The one halfway up the cliff is called the Steep Immortal Grotto; the one atop is called the Level Immortal Grotto. On the ninth day of the ninth month that year, in the Red City Grotto of Mount Quting in Baxi, the Supreme Lord dispatched envoys accompanied by the retinues of the Five Emperors, bearing a jade tablet to confer upon him the title of Perfected One of Orthodox Unity.

The Perfected One then transmitted to his eldest son, Heng, the secret registers of the Alliance of Powers and Merit, the Two Swords for Slaying Demons, the jade tablet, and the jade seal, admonishing him: “These texts govern the Three and Five Steps of Manifestation and the essentials of Orthodox Unity. They shall pass to one son in each generation, succeeding my position. They must not be transmitted to those outside our clan or lineage.” The *Records of Mount Qingcheng* state: “On Red City Mountain lies the repository of the Heavenly Master’s scriptures,” while another account places the sealed scriptures and decrees in the mountains of Jinkou. (Note: The Jinkou Abbey is located in Cangxi County of Hezhou.)

To Chang and Sheng, he said: “I have remaining elixir in the golden basin atop the Elixir-Refining Pavilion. You two may divide and consume it, for today you shall follow me.” At noon that day, they saw a man in vermilion robes with a cyan sash, wearing sandals and holding a tablet, and another in black silk with a sword at his waist, both bearing jade caskets. They followed the vermilion-robed messenger forward, prostrated themselves, and said: “By command of the Supreme Clarity, we present the true talismans to welcome the Perfected One to the Gardens of Paradise.”

Presently, from the northeast appeared twenty-four riders mounted on dragons, tigers, simurghs, and cranes, each bearing green banners and crimson staffs. Lion-like and *pixie*-warding creatures, along with armored celestial soldiers, arrived, announcing themselves as the officials of Jingyang. Then a black dragon drew a purple carriage, and two jade maidens escorted the Perfected One and his wife, Lady Yong (or Lady Sun, according to some accounts), into the vehicle. Preceded by a celestial procession and followed by heavenly music, they ascended to the heavens in broad daylight from the summit of Yuntai Peak. At that time, the Perfected One was one hundred and twenty-three years old.

Emperor Xuanzong of Tang composed this eulogy:
*In that distant age of fiery Han,*
*The celestial chart was flawed, the cosmos rent;*
*All things withered, the Three Powers in disarray.*
*Yet our Master arose to meet the mandate,*
*His divine might swiftly unleashed.*
*He served the true origin in person,*
*Receiving the secret transmissions.*
*Demonic toxins scattered like clouds,*
*Haunted mountains split by his sword.*
*He widely proclaimed the teachings,*
*Thoroughly purging the plague of corruption.*
*With a single flourish of non-action,*
*He brought eternal radiance to the bounded realm.*
*Soaring on simurghs and cranes,*
*His image was captured in cinnabar and ink.*
*His jade countenance and true form*
*Transmit an undying fragrance.*

He composed another eulogy:
*Remote is the true immortal,*
*Lofty and unyielding his integrity.*
*His qi pierced the vault of heaven,*
*As the Mysterious Origin revealed its secrets.*
*His divine bearing was resplendent,*
*Like the moon in its purity.*
*He executed demons and severed spirits,*
*Driving away ghosts and banishing malevolence.*
*In the Han, he established the Alliance of Powers,*
*Its transmission unbroken to this day.*

Emperor Suzong of Tang composed this eulogy:
*Virtue arises from purity and emptiness,*
*The essence of the sagely teachings.*
*Now hidden, now revealed,*
*He embodied simplicity and substance.*
*Abiding in a jade hall,*
*He begged for incense in a chamber of jade.*
*His Dao-heart was undivided—*
*Such is Orthodox Unity.*

The jade tablet for the posthumous investiture of the Perfected Lord, bestowed by Emperor Huizong of Song, reads:
*In the second year of Daguan, the cyclical year* wuzi*, on the sixteenth day of the tenth month, the first day of which was* dingchou*, We, the Emperor, reverently bow and declare:*
*The Dao is without fixed form,*
*Yet is perfected through humanity.*
*Of old, the utmost perfected ones*
*Used the Dao to flourish the age.*
*Their merit embraced the myriad things,*
*Thus they became enlightened sovereigns...*

The task is deemed worthy of such honor—how dare We not revere it? With reverence, We recall the Orthodox Unity Perfected Lord, the Three Heavens’ Upholder of the Dao, Auxiliary of Primordial Qi, Great Dharma Master of the Han Celestial Master: his embodiment of the subtle revealed the profound, bringing great benefit to the world. In the twilight of the Liu dynasty, his achievements flourished abundantly. Thus, he harnessed radiance and light, transcending the common multitude, concealing the true charts and secret ordinances, entrusting them to posterity. He eradicated demonic afflictions, warded off inauspicious omens, and in the unseen realm, startled the people—his fame enduring and ever more resplendent. Without such illustrious titles, how could We fully repay him? By bestowing honor and extolling his gracious favor, We now dispatch the Court-Bestowed Grand Master and Prefect of Xinzhou, Liu Yan, to confer the exalted title: *Perfected Lord of Orthodox Unity, Serene Response*.

The Great Dao is concealed in obscurity yet manifests in clarity; its merit extends afar yet is evident near at hand. Not that We alone can achieve this—only through unceasing constancy may one ascend to observe and reflect upon these deeds, thereby perpetuating their legacy, aiding and assisting Our state and household, and extending blessings to Our people. May boundless prosperity be proclaimed, enduring through eternal ages.

In the third year of Jiaxi under Emperor Lizong, he was further enfeoffed as *Perfected Lord of Orthodox Unity, Serene Response, Manifest Assistance*.

Minister Dao Yi states: The transformations of ghosts and spirits have existed since antiquity. When humans and ghosts intermingle in slaughter, the Dao is forsaken. The Celestial Master Zhang discerned the teachings of talismans and registers, comprehending the sentiments of Heaven and Earth, distinguishing yin and yang, and separating humans from ghosts. As for seizing ghosts in their hidden prisons and establishing the Twenty-Four Dioceses, this differs not from the Most High’s descent to subdue the ninety-five kinds of heterodox ways. The transmission of the Orthodox Unity teachings to later generations has been no small contribution.

Moreover, his virtue has descended to his descendants, who have inherited the true wind generation after generation, enduring to this day—could this not be Heaven’s reward for his merit?

The *Daodejing* states: *"When the Dao is used to govern the world, its ghosts lose their numinosity."* It is not that the ghosts lose their numinosity, but that their numinosity does no harm to people. And since their numinosity does no harm, the sage likewise does no harm. The Celestial Master Zhang must have profoundly grasped this principle.

Wang Chang

Perfected Immortal Wang Chang—his native place is unknown—studied under Perfected Zhang of the Orthodox Unity. When the Perfected departed for Yunjin Mountain and dispersed his many disciples, only Wang Chang, versed in celestial patterns and master of the Huang-Lao teachings, remained to attend him. Chang then carried books and sang as he walked, accompanying the Perfected to Yunjin Mountain, where he served him daily. Ingesting elixirs and battling demons, he accumulated deeds and amassed merit. Later, on Quting Mountain, the Perfected one day pointed to Chang and said: “Only you, having planted goodness over many lives, bear the bone of an immortal from former times—you may now be brought to completion.” Thereupon he transmitted to him the essentials of the Nine Cauldrons, and Chang ascended in broad daylight.

Zhao Sheng

Perfected Immortal Zhao Sheng, styled Master Deer Hall—his native place is unknown. At first, when Perfected Zhang of the Orthodox Unity was in Shu, Sheng came from a thousand *li* away, wishing to take the disciple’s rites. The Perfected tested him with seven difficult tasks, yet Sheng remained steadfast from beginning to end. For the seventh trial, he and Wang Chang were sent to fetch peaches and cast into a valley, where they beheld the Perfected seated in a jeweled grove beneath a canopy of treasures. There they bowed and received the divine elixir and sacred scriptures. Later, having served the Perfected until his merit and conduct were complete, Sheng ascended to Heaven in broad daylight.

Your servant Daoyi observes: Zhao Sheng sought a master from a thousand *li* away, maintained unwavering sincerity, and was devoted to the Dao, forgetting his own body. He endured humiliation and bore disgrace, his resolve firm and his integrity unyielding. In the end, he grasped the Perfected’s teachings, received the profound mysteries of the Dao and virtue, accumulated deeds and amassed merit, refined his form, and ascended lightly. In his resolve, he differed not from the transmitted accounts of the Master who pierced the stone. Later seekers of immortality may truly take him as their model.

The *Daodejing* states: *“Those who strive resolutely possess the will.”* This is what it means.

Zhang Heng

Successor Master Zhang Heng, styled Lingzhen—also recorded as Ziping—was the eldest son of Zhang Zhengyi the Perfected. Skilled in celestial portents and the study of the Dao, he later emerged to serve the Han as Governor of Longxi, then rose to Attendant-in-Ordinary. From youth, he was broadly learned, yet lived in reclusion, refusing office, and gained great renown throughout the realm. When the Emperor heard of his mastery of the Dao, he summoned him to serve as Gentleman of the Yellow Gate, but Zhang declined. He withdrew from worldly affairs, practicing breath control and abstaining from grain. In the second year of Guanghe of Emperor Ling’s reign (159 C.E.), on the twenty-third day of the first lunar month, he transmitted the Perfected’s teachings to his son.

The Master and his wife, Lady Lu, attained the Dao on Mount Yangping and ascended to Heaven in broad daylight.

Zhang Lu
Zhang Lu, styled Gongqi—recorded in the *Book of Han* as Gongqi—was the eldest son of Successor Master Zhang. Devoted to the Dao, he upheld the Perfected’s teachings. He served the Han as Chief of Agriculture, General of Pacification, and Governor of Hanzhong and Nanzheng. Later, he withdrew to study the Dao, healing illnesses with talismans and methods, accepting a single *dou* of rice as payment, whereupon the afflicted would recover at once. Over time, his store of rice grew to tens of thousands. When the King of Wei learned of this, he dispatched envoys with troops to subdue him. His disciples warned him, but the Master said, “Take care not to fear.” He then ascended a ridge with his disciples and gazed out, seeing troops encircling them on all sides. The Master drew a river upon the earth with his tablet, its raging waves surging forth, plunging into unfathomable depths, blocking the soldiers’ advance. When the envoys returned with a naval force to the riverbank, the Master again drew upon the earth with his tablet, and a peak rose from the river’s midst, towering over a thousand *zhang*, halting their progress. The envoys returned and reported all that had transpired.

(Alternatively recorded: During the Jian’an era, Cao Cao usurped power, threatening the Han house. Though Zhang Lu resented this, he lacked the strength to oppose Cao, so he raised troops and fortified his position. Later, when King Liu Bei established Shu, he enfeoffed Zhang Lu as Duke of Fuyi, recognizing his loyalty. The King of Wei sent envoys to apologize, offering seals and ribbons to appoint him Governor of Liang and Yi Provinces, General Who Pacifies the South, and Marquis of Wen, with a fief of thirty thousand households. The Master firmly declined, telling the envoys, “I am a cultivator of the Dao, and the world admires those who ascend lightly. This division of land and titles is not my desire. Return the seals and ribbons, and do not come again.”)

Later, he refined his practice and ascended to Heaven riding a dragon.

(Alternatively recorded: Zhang Lu transcended on the southern peak of Mount Taibai, and his burial was in the southern district of Baocheng. Later, when Jiang Wei stationed troops in the western mountains of Shu, he encountered Zhang Lu amidst the celestial mists, but after a long while, he vanished.)

The Master had two younger brothers: the elder named Wei, the younger named Kui. Wei served as General Who Summons Righteousness, devoted himself to the Dao, and ascended to Heaven from Jialing. Kui served as Governor of Nanjun, then abandoned office to study the Dao. After a long time, he too ascended to Heaven in broad daylight.

Zhang Zi
Zhang Zi—recorded in the *Book of Han* as Fu, styled Yuanwei—was the eldest son of Successor Master Zhang. He was summoned to serve as an aide to the Chancellor, then as Gentleman of the Yellow Gate, later becoming Governor of Hanzhong and enfeoffed as Marquis of Changting. After a long time, he attained the Dao and departed through *shijie*.

He had four younger brothers: Yong, Sheng, Yi, and Ju.

Yong, styled Lingzong, served as Commandant of the Imperial Carriage, Gentleman-Consultant, and was enfeoffed as Marquis of Louting. He attained the Dao and departed through *shijie*.

Sheng, styled Yuanzong, served as Commandant of the Imperial Carriage and Gentleman Cavalier Attendant, enfeoffed as Marquis of Duting. Once, he sighed deeply and said, “The teachings of our ancestors have always been transmitted to the eldest son, yet my elder brothers all remained unmarried. Can it be that this line will end here?” During the Yongjia era of the Western Jin, one night he gazed eastward over the great river and saw auspicious vapors piercing the heavens. He said to his wife, “This can complete my elixir.” He then abandoned office and journeyed south. Upon reaching Poyang Commandery, he observed the vapors and said, “It is near.” After five days of traveling through the mountains, he arrived at a range of peaks, their beauty unmatched. Rejoicing, he declared, “I have found it!” At the summit stood a well and a cave where Perfected Ones had once refined elixirs and cultivated the Dao. He built a hut beside the well and cave. After a year, Lady Lu came searching for him, and they dwelled together on the mountain. They had one son.

(Alternatively recorded: Lady Lu carried a son from Shu and settled at the mountain’s base. After nine years, the elixir was complete. One day, he departed through *shijie*, and people called him the Dragon-Tiger. His descendants mostly lived to the northeast of the mountain.)

Yi, styled Lizong, served as General of the Van, Commandant of the Empress’s Carriage, General Who Quells Bandits, Governor of Hanzhong and Nanzheng, and Marquis of Wen. After a long time, he attained the Dao and departed through *shijie*.

Ju, styled Ruzong, served as Palace Attendant, Pacification Commissioner of the South, and Governor of Yiyang. After a long time, he too attained the Dao and departed through *shijie*.

(Alternatively recorded: The fourth brother was Sheng, the fifth Yi, the sixth Ju, and the seventh Mengde, styled Wenzong, who served as Grand Master for Admonition and Director of the Clan Court. He attained the Dao and departed through *shijie*.)

Today, at White Mist Abbey in Linlü, stands Great Auspicious Mountain. It is said to be the place where the fourth-generation descendant of the Celestial Master refined elixirs and attained the Dao. Tao Bi of the Song dynasty wrote a poem:

*Here the feathered guests ascend to the origin,*
*Ancient altars stand amid old trees.*
*The elixir’s auspicious glow remains,*
*Where the crane’s nest emptied as he rode away.*
*Seals were bestowed from Heaven,*
*Talismans linked to the Dao’s flow.*
*That true qi of the time—*
*In pines and cassia, the night wind blows.*

Zhang Zhaocheng
Zhang Zhaocheng, styled Daorong, was the eldest son of Sheng. He cultivated the Dao tirelessly, often sitting upright in his chamber while his spirit wandered hundreds of *li* away. He could tame tigers and leopards. At the age of one hundred and nineteen, he passed away, yet his body remained warm as if alive. After burial, thousands of mushrooms sprouted upon his tomb.

One day, villagers witnessed a crane emerge from his tomb, borne aloft by a radiant cloud. When the tomb was later opened, only his cap and shoes remained. Another account states that he attained the Dao during the early Jin dynasty and ascended as an immortal in the Xiankang era of Emperor Cheng.

Zhang Jiao
Zhang Jiao, styled Dexin, was the eldest son of Daorong. Having mastered the true method of governing spirits, he transmitted the secret registers bestowed by the perfected ones to ordain disciples in the world. The Jin emperor repeatedly summoned him, but he never answered the call. After attaining the Dao at over a hundred years of age, he bade farewell to his disciples and passed away in serene transformation.

Zhang Zhonghui
Zhang Zhonghui, styled Dechang, was the eldest son of Dexin. Inheriting his father’s teachings, he could abstain from grain and travel hundreds of *li* in a day. Later, he entered the Shu Mountains and never returned; his fate remains unknown.

Zhang Jiong
Zhang Jiong, styled Yanchao, was the eldest son of Dechang. He attained the Dao in his youth, possessed a graceful bearing, and excelled in discernment. Daily, he arranged the registers of the perfected ones by rank, reverently enshrining them in his oratory, where incense and offerings burned without cease throughout his life. In healing illnesses and expelling evil, none failed to recover, and the world held him in high esteem.

At ninety years of age, he passed away—alternatively, it is said that Emperor Tai of Qi summoned him to court.

Zhang Fu
Zhang Fu, styled Dexin, was the eldest son of Yanchao. Devoted to the Dao, he inherited and upheld the teachings of the Perfected Ones. He died at the age of ninety-two.

Zhang Zixiang
Zhang Zixiang, styled Linbo, was the eldest son of Dexin. Well-versed in the classics, he explored the wisdom of past and present. Assuming the robes of a scholar, he served the Sui dynasty as a magistrate in Luoyang. Before long, he resigned his post, retiring with his wife and children to Mount Longhu—alternatively, it is said that he once sighed: "Though the Sui have unified the realm, chaos will not be long in coming." Thus, he withdrew and never again took office. Hundreds of disciples gathered around him, their aspirations fixed on self-cultivation. His complexion grew ever more youthful, perpetually resembling that of a man of twenty. He could expel the cinnabar elixir from his abdomen, place it in his palm, and play with it; or cast it into a vessel at night, where its radiance pierced the roof, before swallowing it again. After long years, he attained the Dao and died at the age of one hundred and two—alternatively, one hundred and twenty. His coffin was remarkably light. On the night of his burial, a hole suddenly appeared in his tomb. When the mound was opened, only his clothing remained.

Zhang Tong
Zhang Tong—alternatively, his given name was Zhongda, as the character *tong* conflicted with a taboo name of the Song dynasty—was the eldest son of Linbo. He inherited and upheld the teachings of the Perfected Ones. For forty years, he kept his door closed and never ventured out, and his wife and children saw him only at appointed times. After many years, he attained the Dao and died at the age of ninety-seven.

After several months in the coffin, his corpse remained entirely undecayed. Both Tong and Gaoshun shared names that violated ancestral naming taboos—though the reason for this remains unclear.

Zhang Zhongchang
Zhang Zhongchang, styled Derun, was the eldest son of Zhongda. Well-versed in Confucian texts, he too possessed numinous abilities. Emperor Gaozong of Tang summoned him to court, but he secretly returned home, sighing, *"I nearly fell into the snare of the world."* He studied the Dao at home, inheriting and upholding the teachings of the Perfected Ones. Skilled in bilocation and transformation, he once pushed a vat into his chamber, where he ate meat and drank wine with his wife. That night, drunk beside the vat, he vomited into it—yet the contents remained unspoiled for days. He died at the age of ninety-eight. Another account states that he buried the vat in his chamber, eating meat and drinking wine before his wife and children. That night, when the vat was opened, all were found inside, yet none had decayed after days.

Zhang Guang
Zhang Guang, styled Dezhao, was the eldest son of Derun. From youth, he received the teachings of the Perfected Ones. After many years, he abandoned his wife and, with his second son Wu, entered the mountains to cultivate for over two decades. He later emerged to reunite with his wife, living together for another five years. He passed away at home at the age of one hundred and two, while Wu also mastered the art of grain avoidance.

Zhang Cizheng
Zhang Cizheng, styled Ziming, was the eldest son of Dezhao. Well-versed in the classics, he excelled in the *Book of Changes*, with over a hundred disciples studying under him. After many years, he withdrew to the mountains to cultivate the Dao, living apart from his wife and children. He transmitted the teachings of the Perfected Ones, bestowing the secret registers of the Three Primes upon initiates each year, drawing seekers from all directions. With the alms he accumulated, he aided impoverished scholars during famine years. He also mastered the arts of refining cinnabar and transmuting base metals. He died in the mountains at over a hundred years of age, and faint strains of celestial music were heard in the air. Another account states that he could transmute tiles into gold and silver with an elixir, forging them into vessels; when cast into water or passed through fire, they reverted to tiles.

Zhang Gao
Zhang Gao, styled Shilong (later changed from Shilong to Shilong to avoid the taboo of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang), was the eldest son of Ziming. He studied the Dao and upheld the teachings of the Perfected Ones, drinking up to a *dan* of wine without intoxication. Emperor Minghuang of Tang summoned him to the capital, where he officiated at an altar to receive the registers. The emperor bestowed gold and silk upon him, exempted him from taxes, and enfeoffed him with the title "Celestial Master of the Han Ancestor." Emperor Suzong burned incense and performed rituals, personally inscribing a eulogy in imperial calligraphy to honor the Celestial Master. During the Zhenyuan era, imperial offerings were sent, including a gold-gilded silver censer, incense box, a brocade-trimmed golden scarf, and yellow-covered vessels. He died at home at the age of ninety-one.

Zhang Yingshao
Zhang Yingshao, styled Zhifeng, was the eldest son of Shilong. Well-versed in the classics, he later retreated to the mountains to practice grain avoidance, capable of fasting for a hundred days. He farmed alongside his wife and children and could play an iron flute, its notes carrying for miles.

One day, he said to his son: "Our family has transmitted the teachings of the Perfected for generations, and our merits have extended to many. Now, as my years draw to a close, you must carry on and preserve them." Having spoken, he sat upright in stillness, closed his eyes, and passed away at the age of ninety-nine.

Zhang Shun
Zhang Shun, styled Zhongfu (also recorded as Zhongfu), was the eldest son of Zhifeng. From youth, he served his mother with filial piety, saying: "To seek the Dao and pursue immortality while being unfilial and disloyal is like abandoning a boat to ford a great river." He served as the Guishui Magistrate of his home county but later relinquished his post along with his wife and children, dwelling in a thatched hut. At the age of eighty-seven, his complexion remained youthful and his teeth white; he passed away without illness.

Zhang Shiyuan
Zhang Shiyuan, styled Zhongliang, was the eldest son of Zhongfu. In his youth, he studied broadly across many books and only began cultivating the Dao after the age of forty. He practiced night meditation, and after a long time, he could move his arms freely up and down, entering and exiting as if flying. He transmitted talismanic methods to others and treated illnesses, and he could make peach and plum trees bear fruit in an instant. When the local lord heard of his attainment, he repeatedly summoned him with offers of prestigious offices, but Shiyuan firmly declined. He passed away at home at the age of ninety-two.

Zhang Xiu
Zhang Xiu, styled Dezhen, was the eldest son of Zhongliang. He was simple and unadorned, always wearing plain cloth and disliking ostentation. He farmed with his wife in the fields and did not associate with the villagers.

Each year, he transmitted talismanic methods to others and treated illnesses, with effects manifesting immediately. All the alms he received from his teachings he distributed to impoverished scholars, content in solitude and free from desire. Two years prior, he personally arranged his tomb and said, "I shall depart in two years." When the time came, he bathed, changed his clothes, sat upright, and passed away, aged eighty-five.

*The Record of Divine Verifications* states: Liu Qian, a wealthy merchant from Jiangxi, sought the transmission of the *Dugong* talismanic cord from the Nineteenth-Generation Celestial Master. The following year, he died in Jinling but revived after two nights. He recounted: "I was seized by officials of the underworld when suddenly a golden light descended from the heavens. A yellow-robed messenger arrived through the air, holding a white tablet and reading aloud: 'Liu Qian bears the *Zhengyi* cord; his name is recorded in the celestial registers, not under the jurisdiction of the earthly authorities. Though his allotted time has come, he may be granted thirty more years.'" Thereafter, he donned coarse robes and cultivated the Dao, entering Dragon-Tiger Mountain to serve as a disciple to the Celestial Master.

Zhang Chen
Zhang Chen, styled Zijian, was the eldest son of Dezhen. A learned scholar of his time, he mastered both cursive and clerical scripts. In his later years, he embraced the Dao and was capable of *bigu*. Some say Emperor Wenzong of Tang summoned him and offered an official post, which he declined before returning home. During the *Xiantong* era of Emperor Yizong, he was invited to preside over a grand *Jian* ritual. One day, after three rounds of drinking, he became thoroughly intoxicated and passed away, aged over a hundred.

Zhang Bingyi
Zhang Bingyi, also known as Yankang, styled Wenfu, was the eldest son of Zijian. His mother initially dreamed of a golden—or in some versions, enormous—tortoise entering her womb, and upon waking, conceived. In his youth, he studied the Dao and could see clearly through walls.

Zhang Bingyi once amassed a fortune of a thousand gold pieces, which he used during years of famine to purchase grain and distribute it to the poor and destitute. At the age of ninety-two, he said to his wife one day, "When I die, if there is an earthquake, then encoffin and bury me." Having spoken these words, he sat upright, holding a ritual tablet, and passed away. Seven days later, an earthquake indeed occurred, and they encoffined and buried him; his body remained warm and uncorrupted.

Zhang Shan
Zhang Shan, styled Yuanchang, was the eldest son of Wenfu. From childhood, he abstained from meat, and in adulthood, he embraced the Dao. He traveled through famous mountains and great rivers for twenty years before returning home. Thereafter, he never left his dwelling, deeply cultivating inner refinement. He died at the age of eighty-seven—or, in some accounts, eighty-one.

Zhang Jiwen
Zhang Jiwen, styled Zhonggui, was the son of Yuanchang. Each year, he transmitted the secret methods of the various ranks to disciples capable of cultivation, using talismanic water to cure illnesses with immediate effect. He died at the age of eighty-seven.

Zhang Zhengsui
Zhang Zhengsui, styled Baoshen, was the eldest son of Zhonggui. His nature was honest and unadorned; he did not associate with worldly people and, when encountering them on the road, would hasten to avoid them. Each year, he transmitted the dharma of initiation and alms to relieve the poor and destitute, disregarding his own poverty.

Zhang passed away at the age of eighty-seven and was posthumously enfeoffed as Master Zhenjing.

Zhang Qianyao
Zhang Qianyao was the eldest son of Baoshen. Fond of the Dao, he upheld the teachings and statutes of the Perfected Master. The *Huiyao* states: In the eighth year of the Dazhong Xiangfu era, the Daoist Zhang Qianyao of Xinzhou was summoned to the capital, where an altar was established at the Upper Clarity Palace to transmit the register and ordain disciples. When Emperor Renzong of Song heard of his attainment in the Dao, he summoned him to court in the fifth month of the eighth year of the Tiansheng era and bestowed upon him the title Master Chengsu. The emperor inquired about the matter of ascending in flight, and after a long pause, he replied, "This cannot serve to assist governance and instruction." The emperor praised his response. When asked about his sons, he answered that his eldest had inherited the Dao while the second pursued Confucian studies. Thereupon, his second son, Jiansu, was appointed as a general and served as a supervisor of the registry. Though Jiansu held office, his heart remained devoted to the Dao. After retiring as a Gentleman of the Court of the Imperial Stud, he withdrew to seclusion at Shuhu in Poyang, where his descendants reside to this day.

Zhang Sizong
Zhang Sizong was the eldest son of Master Chengsu. He inherited the teachings of the Perfected Master and transmitted the secret registers. Having mastered the method of exhaling and inhaling qi, he appeared as a child at seventy. He died at the age of eighty-one and was posthumously enfeoffed as Master Xubai. The *Huiyao* states: In the eighth month of the third year of the Zhihe era, he was bestowed the title Master Chongjing.

Zhang Xiangzhong
Zhang Xiangzhong, styled Gongchen, was the eldest son of Master Xubai. At the age of seven, he was granted the purple robe and succeeded to the lineage. Another account states that at thirteen, he was exceptionally intelligent, widely versed in the classics and histories, and particularly skilled in the arts of the Dao.

Emperor Renzong of the Song summoned him for an audience, granted him a seat, and consulted him on the subtleties of Daoist methods. The emperor specially bestowed upon him a purple robe and personally brushed an imperial inscription to bless the ancestral temple, further presenting him with silk and gold vessels. Thereafter, the court’s favor and honors continued unabated, and he succeeded to the teachings of the Perfected Master without negligence throughout his life.

Zhang Dunfu
Zhang Dunfu, styled Yanzhi, was the eldest son of Gongchen. In his youth, he wore the scholar’s robe and gained renown in the examination halls. Later, as the eldest son, he succeeded to the twenty-eighth generation of the Orthodox Unity lineage, greatly promoting his ancestral traditions, which were revered by all quarters. He died at the age of fifty-three and was posthumously enfeoffed as Master Baoguang.

Zhang Jingduan
Zhang Jingduan, styled Ziren, was a descendant of the twenty-fourth generation, named Di, the fifth son. Devoted to the Dao, he succeeded to the teachings of the Perfected Master. He died at the age of thirty-one—another account states fifty-two—and was posthumously enfeoffed as Master Baozhen.

Zhang Jixian
Zhang Jixian, styled Zunzheng, was a descendant of the twenty-sixth generation. His father, named Churen and styled Dexuan, was a Gentleman for Announcing Teachings and magistrate of Linchuan, and he was the second son. At the age of nine, he succeeded to the teachings of the Perfected Master. From the Chongning era of Emperor Huizong onward, he was summoned to court four times, granted the title Master Xujing, and ranked as a Grand Master for Thorough Service. Initially, Emperor Shenzong had the six-character seal of the Perfected Master—"Yangping Zhi Du Gong Yin"—carved from kun jade and stored in the Repository of the Processional Regalia at the Sanqing Chuxiang Palace, intending to bestow it upon one of virtuous attainment. At this time, it was granted to Jixian. Subsequently, he was further enfeoffed as Perfected Lord of Orthodox Unity, Serene Response, and Manifest Protection, and an edict was issued to the relevant authorities to establish a subordinate abbey in the eastern part of his fief for his residence, bestowing upon it the name Chongdao. Additional funds were granted to renovate the Shangqing Palace on Longhu Mountain, and the Bukou Estate, valued at fifty thousand, was allocated to provide meals for his followers. The name of the palace was changed to the Shangqing Orthodox Unity Palace. His ancestors and father were posthumously enfeoffed with honorific titles, and his grandmothers, née Chen and Feng, as well as his sister Baozhen, were ordained as Daoist priestesses and provided with a Daoist abbey for their residence. Following the precedent of Master Chengsu, his elder brother Shaoxian was appointed Acting Gentleman of the Interior, and the imperial favors were exceedingly generous. The Master’s aspirations lay in serenity and simplicity, and he declined further honors to return home. He once constructed the Jingtong Hermitage behind the Shangqing Palace as a place for heart-fasting and sitting in forgetfulness, and he also practiced refinement following the legacy of his ancestral master’s Cloud Brocade Mountain, Dragon-Tiger Elixir Cauldron. Auspicious radiance and propitious light illuminated the valleys, and sites such as the Hall of Descending Auspiciousness and the Cauldron-Washing Pool remain to this day. Later, he composed *Heart Discourse* and *Song of the Great Dao* to bequeath to the world.

In the dingwei year, at the age of thirty-six, Emperor Qinzong summoned him to court. He reached Sizhou, where he attained transformation. In the winter of the jiyou year, he attended the birthday feast of Master Bi at the Ximen in Hangzhou. That year, bandits invaded the region, and the Master forewarned the assembly before departing. To this day, those who chant the Dao and travel often encounter him at Luofu or in western Shu, his presence elusive and uncertain.

Another account states: In the sixth month of the wushen year, the Master, together with Zhang Tongzhi of Hedong, returned from the capital. Upon reaching Sizhou, they rested at the Weaving Boat Tax Pavilion. Feeling slightly unwell, he drank a cup of broth and immediately departed this life, his body taking on the hue of wax. Daoist priests from Yanchang Abbey requested his remains for burial, but the tax official refused. He was temporarily interred on official land, with Magistrate Zhang overseeing the matter. Later, Zhang received an edict to retrieve Liu Wenkou, and he recounted the events to Zhang Jiuzhong of Xinzhou, who served as Military Attaché. Jiuzhong said, "At that time, the Heavenly Master came to die by this river, and a tomb of the immortal remains there." Shortly afterward, someone arrived from Guizhou bearing a letter from the Heavenly Master thanking Magistrate Zhang, revealing that he had not died. Others claimed to have seen him at Luofu in Huizhou.

Zhang Shixiu
Zhang Shixiu, styled Chaoying, was a descendant of Master Xubai. He was well-versed in Confucian scholarship and sat for the examinations multiple times without success. Thereafter, he retired in tranquility, his aspirations turning toward cultivation and refinement. As Master Xujing remained unmarried and had no heir, the community urged Shixiu to succeed to the lineage.

At the age of sixty-one, he shed his mortal form at the ancestral residence of Longhu. **Zhang Shouzhen**

Zhang Shouzhen, styled Zunyi, was the eldest son of Chaoying. His mother, née Wu, once dreamed that she was given a divine fruit, and was told, "If you eat this, the son you bear will preside over the seal of merit for the Yangping governance." Born with a pure and serene disposition, he grew to be sparing of desires.

In the tenth year of the Shaoxing reign of the Song (gengshen, 1140), he succeeded to the hereditary teachings. Each year during the Three Primes, he transmitted the precepts, and from all directions, people gathered like spokes to a hub. He dispelled evil and purified toxins, and the Dao flourished under his guidance.

On the seventh day of the second month in the twenty-ninth year (1159), Emperor Gaozong bestowed upon him the title *Master of Right Response*. On the thirteenth day of the tenth month in the sixth year of the Qiandao reign (1170), Emperor Gaozong summoned him. On the thirteenth day of the eleventh month, he was ordered to proceed to the Deshou Palace and was lodged at the Yangyu Villa. Three days later, he was granted an audience, offered a seat, and consulted on the methods of the Dao, with great warmth. On the nineteenth day, Emperor Xiaozong summoned him, granted him a seat, bestowed upon him a golden-tin fast, and upon his return to his lodgings, presented him with frequent gifts.

On the nineteenth day of the twelfth month, Emperor Gaozong commanded a jiao ritual at the Yuetai Terrace, where his prayers met with extraordinary responses. The following year, he was summoned again.

Having long preserved the various treasures of the Three Caverns, he was granted gold by the Directorate of Daoist Rites to cast movable type and compile the texts. At the Yanxiang Abbey, he transmitted the precepts and was commanded to take the printing blocks back with him. He was also bestowed an ivory tablet, a *jingzhen* sword, and a handwritten copy of the *Yinfu Jing*.

After Master Shouzhen returned to his retreat, he remained carefree and content, untroubled by worldly concerns. He often said, "I have collected the writings of my elder brother, Master Xujing, who made an appointment to travel to Shu. I shall go there to wander." On the thirtieth day of the tenth month in the third year of the Chunxi reign (1176), he shed his mortal form without illness.

**Zhang Bojing**

Zhang Bojing, styled Deying, was the eldest son of Master of Right Response. Tall and dignified, with a jade-like complexion, a fine beard, and a majestic presence, people said he bore the manner of the Orthodox Unity lineage.

During the Qiandao reign of Emperor Xiaozong of the Song, he accompanied Master of Right Response to the imperial summons. Emperor Gaozong granted him a seat and bestowed a fast upon him, and with his own brush, changed his name to Jingyuan. Later, he was received in the Southern Palace, where he expounded on the methods of the Dao and was greatly praised and accepted.

A month later, Emperor Gaozong commanded Master of Right Response to perform a grand jiao ritual at the Yuetai Terrace. Master of Right Response entrusted Jingyuan with the proceedings, and each time, extraordinary responses were obtained. The emperor bestowed frequent gifts and presented him with an ivory tablet before his return.

Thereafter, he oversaw the teachings of the Three Primes and the transmission of talismans and registers, which flourished under his guidance. Initially, the Prince of Wei, who was stationed in Mingzhou, summoned the master to his jade altar, and their bond grew especially deep. One day, after sending someone to present gifts and extend an invitation, he suddenly said to his disciples, "Though the favor of men may reach its height, I have my own celestial appointment, which I cannot miss." He then leaned against his desk and shed his mortal form.

**Zhang Qingxian**

Zhang Qingxian, styled Shaozu, was the legitimate son of Deying. Before Qingxian’s birth, Deying had raised his younger brother Sixian as his heir and subsequently instructed him in the ancestral teachings. When Qingxian descended into the world, his celestial bearing was refined and elegant, his nature simple and reticent—much like Liezi dwelling in the gardens of Zheng, unknown to his contemporaries. In time, his reputation grew fragrant, his numinous marvels shone forth, and Daoists and layfolk alike revered and turned toward him, unanimously declaring: “Truly the heir of the Master of Right Response.” Thereupon, he was officially recognized, and in the first month of the fifth year of Jiatai of Song Ningzong’s reign (the xinyou year), he inherited the thirty-fourth generation’s position. The transmission of the Three Primes and registers drew clouds of devotees bearing incense and offerings.

The master ever maintained his true purity, lived frugally at home, and treated all beings with kindness and compassion. Upon encountering scholars in poverty or wandering in cold solitude, he felt particular pity and relieved their distress. He had no other indulgences, save for a fondness for wine, though he never succumbed to drunkenness. In the second year of Jiading, during the Lower Prime’s altar-opening, seven days later, a scholar in a crimson robe and headscarf appeared—his spirit majestic and towering, resembling one of the Dao. The crowd did not inquire whence he came, but the master, upon seeing him, opened the wine vessel and offered his seat, as if they were lifelong friends. After parting, they still whispered to each other, lingering for some time before he departed. From then on, the master burned incense and abstained from grain, disengaging from worldly affairs. His family, sensing his imminent transformation, entreated him for final teachings, but he remained silent. On the twenty-ninth day of that month, he rose at dawn, washed and groomed as usual, then sat serenely in repose and shed his mortal form.

**Zhang Keda**
Zhang Keda, styled Zixian, was the second son of Master of Right Response, grandson of Boli, and second son of Master of Benevolent Stillness, Tianlin. Earlier, when Jingyuan ascended, Boli had temporarily assumed the thirty-fourth generation’s duties. When Qingxian ascended, his legitimate son Chengda was still young, so Tianlin again acted as the thirty-fifth generation’s master, transmitting its teachings. He was summoned by Song Ningzong and bestowed the title *Master of Benevolent Stillness*. Soon after, Chengda passed early, and Keda was designated Qingxian’s successor. In the third year of Shaoding of Lizong’s reign, when Master of Benevolent Stillness ascended, Keda was only thirteen, yet he rightfully inherited the thirty-fifth generation’s teachings. His spirit was striking and extraordinary, his nature and wisdom uncommon. Disciples from all directions seeking registers and transmissions numbered in the tens of thousands, and the Dao’s transformation flourished.

In the third year of Duanping, he received an imperial decree granting funds to reprint the registers bestowed by previous emperors. In the second year of Jiaxi, he was enfeoffed as *True Lord of Right Response, Stillness, Manifest Aid*. The deities of Zhufa, Wushan, Yuquan, and Longjing were all granted titles. In the third year’s fourth month, he was summoned by imperial decree to the temporary capital, where his prayers for receding tides, rain, locust eradication, and frontier protection all met with divine response. In the seventh month, he was received in audience, granted a seat and vegetarian meal, and bestowed the title *Master of Observing the Mysterious*. The emperor’s praise was profound, his gifts abundant, and he further granted funds to restore the *True and August Abbey* of former reigns, designating it as a residence for mother and son, endowing it with land and exempting it from taxes. The emperor personally inscribed the abbey’s plaque, as well as those of the *Hall of True Wind* and the *Purple Tenuity Pavilion*, and bestowed a fan inscribed with his own calligraphy:

*"When spirit and Dao become one,
Heaven and man are linked as kin.
If with precision and devotion you guard,
You shall ride the clouds and soar the mists."*

The master also petitioned the court on behalf of the deities of Zhufa, Wushan, Yuquan, and Longjing, all of whom were granted noble ranks. Thereafter, imperial favor deepened, and there was no year without imperial summons, incense offerings, or altar rites—each prayer met with response. In the second year of Baoyou, he was again summoned by imperial decree to the temporary capital to preside over Longxiang Abbey. Pleading old age among his kin, he declined, and the emperor assented, appointing him *Supervisor of the Three Mountains’ Registers, Overseer of the Imperial Abbeys’ Teachings, and Director of Longxiang Abbey*—a position he held in absentia to this day.

Having secured his request, he harbored the intent to wander beyond the world. In the third year of Jingding, he transmitted the teachings to his second son, Zongyan, and submitted a memorial to inform the throne. On the tenth day of the fourth month, he shed his mortal form. The emperor and crown prince each bestowed funeral gifts, and upon his interment, imperial bestowals were especially generous. Chancellor Jiang Wanli composed his stele inscription.

Gan Ji

Gan Ji was a native of Langye—some say of Beihai. Originally named Shi, he later changed his name to Ji. His ancestors for generations had possessed Daoist arts and refrained from taking life; Ji’s devotion and austerity surpassed even theirs. He often wandered by the flowing waters of Quyang, where he obtained over a hundred scrolls of divine scripture, written on red silk with white silk borders, their headings in blue and their characters in vermilion. These were called the *Tai Ping Qing Ling Shu* (The Green-Headed Scripture of Great Peace), received in the second year of Heping, the jiawu year, during the reign of Emperor Cheng of Han. It is said that Ji personally received this teaching from Lord Lao, and it is now known as the *Daoist Scripture of Great Peace*. The text is divided into ten sections according to the ten celestial stems—jia, yi, bing, ding, wu, ji, geng, xin, ren, and gui—each section comprising seventeen scrolls.

Another account states that Ji suddenly fell gravely ill, suffering for over a decade without remedy. One morning, he burned incense and piteously entreated Heaven, vowing to seek deliverance. Lord Lao, moved by his sincerity, sent the immortal Bo He to appear as an old medicine-seller in the marketplace. There, Bo He bestowed the scripture upon Ji, saying, “By obtaining this book, you will not only be cured of your illness but will attain longevity and transform the world.” Ji bowed in gratitude and received it; his illness vanished at once. Lord Lao descended again to personally instruct him in its essentials. Ji then compiled the earlier scriptures into a total of one hundred and seventy scrolls.

Having grasped its teachings, he cultivated himself and nurtured his nature, dispelling misfortune and curing illnesses—all with unfailing efficacy. Its core principles declare: “When a person is born, Heaven bestows spirit upon them, Earth bestows essence, and the harmonious void bestows qi. If one can preserve essence, cherish spirit, and safeguard qi, then inwardly one attains longevity, and outwardly one brings great peace to the realm.”

It further states: “A minister’s conduct should begin with love for their lord, desiring his long life. As a child, one should remember their parents, fearing their advancing age, and guide their hearts toward the Dao. One should constantly seek rare formulas and extraordinary arts to serve one’s lord and parents. As a disciple, one should remember the kindness of one’s teacher. For a person is born of parents, their virtue and power are perfected by their teacher, and their honor and glory come from their lord. When one reflects that one’s lord, parents, and teacher are aging and there is nothing to repay them, one should study diligently, serve the worthy and enlightened, and seek rare formulas and wondrous methods to benefit them. Such is the most excellent loyal minister, filial child, and obedient disciple of the Highest Antiquity and the August Sovereigns. If all people act thus, the world will be at great peace.”

“Those with sincerity in their hearts perform only good deeds. Their words and actions are pure and steadfast, their minds self-disciplined. They purify their hearts and reform their conduct, moving even the heavens above. When they receive Heaven’s grace, they express gratitude and repay it. Through unwavering devotion, they attain the realm of immortals.”

One of its formulas states: “My character ‘shi’ with eleven strokes is called ‘scholar.’ Bingwu and dingsi are the ancestral beginnings. Four mouths govern affairs and the principles of all things. The child’s cap uses the corner to govern the right. The hidden dragon must not act—Kan corresponds to si. If people see it, their lives will be long. Dwelling between Heaven and Earth, one merely lives, yet by governing a hundred thousand people, immortality may be awaited. Those who skillfully cure illness must not dispense lightly. There is no joy like that of the marketplace in Chang’an. May people’s lives be as long as the Queen Mother of the West, returning to the beginning like the four seasons in their cycle.” Ninety characters in all, this strategy was transmitted to the fangshi.

For these were the divine elixirs and rare medicines with which one could serve one’s lord, parents, and teacher. Lord Lao also bestowed upon Ji the methods of the *Kejie Jijiu* (Precepts and Admonitions for Libationers) to transmit to him.

Later, Ji revered the scripture and practiced the Dao, disseminating its teachings among his disciples. He established male and female officials, widely transforming the people, and from all directions they turned toward him. In the second year of Yuanhe during the reign of Emperor Xiaozhang, Lord Lao descended again and reproached Ji, saying, “I previously entrusted you with the Dao to aid the state and sustain life, worrying for the myriad people. Yet in recent times, your male and female disciples, invoking my name and position, have grown greedy for wealth, indulged in desire, become arrogant and haughty, envied the worthy, and suppressed talent, all the while engaging in mutual slander. This is not how it should be, and so I have come to speak with you.”

Ji prostrated himself, touching his head to the ground a hundred times, and said, “Yes, yes! I beg the Most High to pardon past transgressions and allow me to cultivate future goodness. From this day forward, how may I save my male and female disciples from reproach?”

Lord Lao replied, “Listen well to my teaching. Even if a person lives ten thousand years, without upholding the precepts, how do they differ from an ancient tree or a long-standing stone? Better to die upholding the precepts for the sake of virtue and power than to live in violation of them. Those who uphold the precepts mend the heavenly offices and ascend as immortals through liberation in the corpse. Though one may be a king or a duke, or even an emperor, if they commit grave sins, it will be of no benefit to their soul and spirit. Can they not grieve over this? Clearly uphold my precepts and teach them to others.”

Thereupon, he expounded one hundred and eighty precepts. When he finished, he said to Ji, “The ancient sages of old all attained the Dao through these. The Dao has no form; it is perfected through a teacher. The Dao must not be abandoned, nor the teacher slighted.”

Ji bowed deeply, received the command, and expressed his gratitude with repeated bows.

Later, Ji took up residence in Kuaiji. When Sun Ce pacified the Jiangdong region and advanced to attack Kuaiji, he saw that the people all called Ji “Gan Lang” and revered him as a deity. Sun Ce summoned Ji to be a guest in his army. Many of his officers and soldiers fell ill, and when Ji prayed over water for them, they were immediately cured. Sun Ce, leading tens of thousands of troops, intended to welcome Emperor Xian and campaign against Cao Cao. He had Ji divine the winds and omens, and each time the results were divinely accurate. The officers and soldiers all venerated Ji, bowing to him before paying respects to Sun Ce.

Sun Ce, seeing that many of his officers were with Ji, grew enraged and said, “Am I not the equal of Lord Gan?” He arrested Ji and reproached him, saying, “The heavens have long been dry, and the waterways are blocked. You do not share in the people’s worries but sit idly in your boat, playing the part of a ghost, misleading my officers and soldiers, and disrupting my ranks. Today I shall do away with you.” He bound Ji and exposed him to the scorching sun, ordering him to pray for rain. “If you can move Heaven and bring a great downpour by midday, I will pardon you. If not, you will be executed.”

Suddenly, clouds gathered and rain poured down in torrents, causing the river to overflow. The officers and soldiers all congratulated Ji, but Sun Ce proceeded to kill him. The officers and soldiers wept as they collected his remains for burial. The next day, when they went to visit the grave, his body had vanished.

Sun Ce was deeply remorseful, and from then on, Ji often appeared before and behind him. Later, Sun Ce was soon wounded by an assassin sent by Xu Gong. Gazing into a mirror, he saw Ji within it; greatly startled, he struck the mirror and cried out, whereupon the wound in his chest split open and he died.

The *Hunyuan Shilu* states: Ji lingered among people for over a hundred years before ascending as an immortal.

Your servant Daoyi says: The *Daodejing* states, “Fine weapons are inauspicious tools—things may detest them, and thus those who possess the Dao do not dwell with them.” Ji’s ancestors revered the Dao, and he himself diligently cultivated the practices of those who came before him. Yet he ended up in the midst of military affairs and was killed by Sun Ce. Though this may be called a “martial liberation,” had Ji instead withdrawn into seclusion, accumulating merit through hidden deeds, who is to say he would not have attained the rank of ascension? Those who study the immortal arts hereafter should take the presence of fine weapons as a profound warning.

Guan Song
Guan Song was a native of Langye. Gifted in literature, he composed over a hundred scrolls of writings. He became a disciple of the adept Gan Shi. During the reign of Emperor Yuan of Han, Song followed Ji to Quyang Spring, where they encountered celestial immortals who bestowed upon Ji the *Tai Ping Jing* in ten fascicles, written in cinnabar on green silk. Ji practiced its teachings and attained the Dao, then transmitted the text to Song. Later, Song presented this work to the court. Its contents extensively discuss the waxing and waning of yin and yang, calamities and blessings, and expound the Dao of Heaven, the Dao of Earth, and the Dao of Man. It declares that rulers who employ its principles may attain longevity—such is its essence. Song ingested mica and lived for several centuries, retaining the complexion of a youth. Later, he entered and exited Fenlyu Mountain and ascended as an immortal.

Wang Daozhen
Wang Daozhen was a man of the Han dynasty.

Wang Daozhen attained the Dao at the Ancient Cypress Terrace east of Ghost Valley Mountain, where white clouds perpetually emerged from within the terrace, appearing from afar like a towering pavilion of a hundred feet. Daozhen often rode these clouds, frolicking atop the mountain peaks, and at dusk returned to the terrace, where the white clouds would likewise gather and withdraw into it. This place is Ghost Valley Mountain north of Qingxi in Jingzhou. Some claim this to be a terrace, but this is incorrect.

The Perfected Immortal Wang Xuanfu
The Perfected Immortal, surnamed Wang and named Xuanfu, was a man of Donghai from the Han dynasty. He studied the Dao under the Perfected One of White Clouds and was also known as the Perfected One of Huayang. He descended to the world on the fifteenth day of the sixth month and ascended on the sixteenth day of the tenth month, though the dynasty of his time is unrecorded. Later, he transmitted the Dao to Zhongli Quan, also known as Zhongli Jue, the Master of Rectifying the Intestines. His written works, though profound, were not widely transmitted. One of his poems, recorded in the *Hun Cheng Ji*, reads:

Within Huayang Mountain lie fields of magic mushrooms,
The old man of Huayang ever extends his years.
Beneath the towering boughs by the verdant pine crags,
He drinks from flying springs amid the billowing white clouds.
Neither cold nor hot, his spirit drifts free,
From east to west his qi flows unbroken.
With three thousand meritorious deeds complete, he returns—
No need to ask others of the grotto-heavens.

In the sixth year of the Zhiyuan reign of the Great Yuan, he was posthumously enfeoffed as the Lesser Yang Emperor of the Purple Palace of Donghua.

Ji Zixun
Ji Zixun’s countenance remained youthful even after two hundred years.

Once, while holding a neighbor’s infant at a gathering, he accidentally dropped the child, who died upon hitting the ground. The child’s family immediately buried it. Ji Zixun arrived from outside, retrieved the child, and returned it alive. Fearing he might be a ghost, the family dug up the burial site, only to find nothing but earth. During the Han dynasty, no noble in the capital failed to earnestly seek an audience with him. Upon his arrival in the capital, officials from the ranks of ministers and below thronged his residence, often numbering in the hundreds, all offering him wine and dried meats, which never ran out throughout the day. One day, students from the Imperial Academy came to invite Ji Zixun. He set out at mealtime and arrived by midday, having traveled over a thousand *li* in less than half a day. He visited twenty-three households, and the nobles, delighted, each believed he had come to them first. The next day, when they inquired among themselves, they found that Ji Zixun’s attire and complexion had remained unchanged, astonishing all near and far. Later, he departed belatedly, and his whereabouts became unknown. On the day he left, only white clouds were seen rising in dozens of places. Travelers in Bacheng, east of Chang’an, witnessed him rubbing a bronze statue with an old man, remarking to each other, “We just saw this cast, yet nearly five hundred years have passed.” Those who saw him called out, “Master Ji, stay a while!” Though he walked at a leisurely pace, even galloping horses could not overtake him.

According to the *Accounts of Immortals*, Ji Zixun was a native of Qi. He was recommended as a filial and incorrupt candidate, appointed Gentleman of the Palace, and later served as a Commandant. None knew he possessed the Dao. Other records of his deeds are largely the same.

Wang Qiao
Wang Qiao was a native of Hedong. During the reign of Emperor Ming of the Han, he served as a Gentleman of the Imperial Secretariat before being appointed Magistrate of Ye County. By Han law, officials within the capital region were required to return to court on the first day of each month. Wang Qiao, however, would arrive at the imperial court from his county every first day of the month. The emperor marveled at his frequent appearances yet absence of carriage or escort, so he secretly ordered the court astronomers to observe him. They reported that each time he neared, a pair of birds would fly in from the southeast. The emperor then ordered nets to be set, and upon capture, one of the birds was found to be a single shoe. When sent to the Imperial Workshop for examination, it was identified as one of the shoes issued to Gentlemen of the Imperial Secretariat four years prior. Whenever court was in session, the drum at the gate of Ye County would sound of its own accord, audible even in the capital.

Later, a jade coffin appeared before the hall. Though officials and commoners pushed and pulled, it would not budge. Wang Qiao said, “Does the Heavenly Emperor summon me alone?” He bathed, donned his robes, lay within the coffin, and the lid sealed itself at once. By the next morning, he was buried east of the city, his tomb forming naturally. That night, all the cattle in the county sweated and panted in exhaustion, though no one knew why. The people built a temple in his honor, calling it the Shrine of Lord Ye. Officials and commoners who prayed there found their requests invariably answered. If any violated their vows, misfortune would swiftly follow.

Some say he was the ancient immortal Wang Ziqiao, as recorded in the *Book of the Later Han*. Later, the shrine was converted into the Shuangliang Abbey, which fell under the jurisdiction of Ruzhou.

**Hugong**

Hugong’s origins are unknown. He often sold medicine, hanging a gourd at the front of his stall. When the market closed, he would leap into the gourd. No one in the marketplace saw him enter, save for Fei Zhangfang of Runan, who observed from an upper floor. Marveling at the sight, Zhangfang approached and bowed twice, offering wine and dried meat. Hugong, perceiving Zhangfang’s divine potential, said, “Come again tomorrow.” The next day, Zhangfang returned, and Hugong took him into the gourd. Inside, they beheld halls of jade, resplendent with fine wine and delicacies in abundance. After drinking, Hugong emerged and said, “I am an immortal, demoted for a transgression. Now I must depart—can you follow?” Below the building stood a small jar of wine, which Hugong offered as a parting gift. Zhangfang ordered ten men to lift it, but they could not budge it. Hugong laughed, hoisted it with a single finger, and when they looked, the vessel held no more than a liter, yet two men could drink from it all day without exhausting it.

Zhangfang wished to seek the Dao but worried for his family. Hugong cut a green bamboo stalk, measuring it to Zhangfang’s height, and told him to hang it in his house. Later, his family saw it and mistook it for Zhangfang’s corpse, believing he had hanged himself. They wailed in grief and buried it. Zhangfang stood beside them, unseen.

Thereafter, he followed Hugong into the mountains, treading through thorns and brambles. Left alone among a pack of tigers, Zhangfang felt no fear. He was made to lie in an empty chamber with a rotten rope suspending a thousand-catty stone over his heart, while serpents gnawed at the rope, nearly severing it—yet he did not flinch. Hugong returned, stroked his head, and said, “You are teachable.” He then ordered Zhangfang to eat excrement, which contained three worms, foul and putrid beyond measure. Zhangfang recoiled in disgust, but Hugong said, “You were nearly enlightened—what a pity this flaw remains.”

Zhangfang asked to return home. Hugong gave him a bamboo staff, saying, “Ride this wherever you wish, and you will arrive. Cast it into Ge Marsh when done.” (The marsh lies in present-day Xinjian County, Yuzhou.) He also gave Zhangfang a talisman, instructing, “Use this to command earthly spirits.” Zhangfang hung the staff, and in an instant, he was home. Though he believed only ten days had passed, over a decade had elapsed. He cast the staff into Ge Marsh, and it transformed into a dragon. His family, assuming him long dead, refused to believe him. Zhangfang said, “The bamboo stalk you buried was the staff.” They exhumed the coffin and found the staff still inside.

Thereafter, Zhangfang could heal all manner of illnesses, flog and command ghosts, and even compel the local earth god. Sometimes, he would sit alone in anger, and when asked why, he would say, “I am punishing lawbreaking spirits.” Once, while seated with guests, he sent someone to fetch fresh fish from Wan Market, and the man returned in an instant with a meal. On a single day, people saw him in several places a thousand *li* apart.

Later, he lost the talisman and was killed by ghosts, as recorded in the *Book of the Later Han*.

Another tradition states: In Runan, a demon annually impersonated the prefect, donning official robes and beating the drum at the government gate, much to the distress of the populace. One day, as the demon arrived, it encountered Zhangfang, who was paying respects to the prefect. Terrified, the demon could not retreat. It removed its robes, kowtowed, and begged for mercy. Zhangfang rebuked it, saying, “Reveal your true form in the courtyard.” It transformed into an ancient turtle, as large as a cartwheel, with a neck a *zhang* long. Zhangfang gave it a writ to deliver to the Lord of Ge Marsh. The demon kowtowed, weeping, and planted the writ by the marsh, coiling its neck around it before dying.

Later, the Lord of the Eastern Sea visited the Lord of Ge Marsh and seduced his wife. Zhangfang bound him for three years, during which the Eastern Sea suffered a great drought. When Zhangfang arrived at the shore, the people begged for rain. He said, “The Lord of the Eastern Sea has sinned; I once bound him at Ge Marsh. Now I release him to bring rain.” Immediately, the rains poured.

Once, while traveling with others, Zhangfang saw a scholar in a yellow turban and fur robe riding a saddless horse. The scholar dismounted and kowtowed. Zhangfang said, “Return the horse and I will pardon you.” When asked why, he replied, “This is a fox spirit—it stole the earth god’s horse.”

Zhangfang could also contract the earth’s veins, drawing distant places before him as if they were fully present.

Wu Jun’s *Continuation of the Qi Xie Record* states: Huan Jing of Runan studied under Fei Zhangfang. Zhangfang told him, “On the ninth day of the ninth month, your family will face disaster. Have them sew crimson pouches, fill them with cornel, and tie them to their arms. Ascend a height and drink chrysanthemum wine—this will avert the calamity.” Jing followed his advice, and when his family returned that evening, they found all their chickens and dogs dead. This is the origin of the custom of ascending heights on the ninth day of the ninth month. Today, Denggao Mountain in Jianning Prefecture preserves this tradition.

The *Record of the Cinnabar Terrace* states: Hugong’s surname was Xie, his given name Yuanyi. In Xinghua Prefecture, there is a Mount Hugong, where a man once met Hugong and was led to the summit. There, he saw palaces and towers, which Hugong said were “the sun and moon within the gourd.” A shrine to Hugong still stands there. Another account claims that the Xuanhu Abbey in Caizhou was Fei Zhangfang’s former retreat, where a “hanging gourd tree” grows. The Lingyang Abbey in Xinzhou is also said to be where Zhangfang’s bamboo staff transformed into a dragon, though the details are unclear.

**Hua Tuo**

Hua Tuo, styled Yuanhua, was a native of Qiao in Peiguo during the Han. Well-versed in the classics and skilled in the arts of nurturing life, he lived past a hundred yet retained the vigor of youth. His contemporaries regarded him as an immortal. The prefect of Pei, Chen Gui, recommended him as a filial and incorruptible scholar, and the Grand Commandant Huang Wan summoned him, but he declined both appointments.

Proficient in medicine and prescriptions, he used no more than a few ingredients, intuiting their precise weights without measurement. His acupuncture and moxibustion required but a few points.

If an illness was lodged deep within, beyond the reach of acupuncture or medicine, he would have the patient take *mafei powder* with wine. Once intoxicated and insensate, he would incise the abdomen or back to excise the affliction. If accumulations lay in the intestines or stomach, he would sever, rinse, and remove the diseased filth before suturing, then apply a divine salve. The wound would heal in four or five days, and full recovery would follow within a month.

Wu Pu of Guangling and Fan A of Pengcheng both studied under him, and by following his methods, saved many lives.

*From the* **Book of the Later Han**.

**Master of the Azure Vale**

The Master of the Azure Vale’s origins are unknown. He constantly practiced the Dao of the Nine Breaths and *qi*-ingestion. Later, he compounded the furnace fire and the Great Elixir, and by ingesting it, attained the Way.

**Liu Wenrao**

Liu Wenrao was Liu Kuan of Hongnong. From youth, he was devoted to the Way. Once recommended as a *fangzheng* of the Han, he gradually rose to become Prefect of Nanyang. He treated the people as his children, never letting anger show on his face or harsh words escape his lips. He practiced hidden virtue, aiding the cold and destitute, so that the people cherished him as a parent. Later, he became Minister over the Masses and Grand Commandant.

The emperor bestowed wine upon him, but he prostrated himself and fell asleep. When summoned by imperial decree, he answered: "Your servant bears heavy responsibilities, and my heart is ever anxious as though drunk." Once, he sent a servant to the market to buy vegetables, but the servant stole the money to drink and returned late, then lay down in the courtyard without bringing the vegetables. When he awoke, he cursed the servant as a "worthless cur." After scolding him, he fastened his sash and entered the hall. Fearing the servant might take his own life afterward, he was so preoccupied with concern that he unknowingly fell asleep. He begged for the emperor’s mercy and forgiveness.

His benevolence and compassion extended to all things in this manner. At the age of seventy-three, the Master of the Azure Vale descended into his bedchamber one day and taught him the method of the Staff of Liberation. He then entered Mount Taihua, practicing the Dao of the Nine Breaths and *qi*-ingestion. Later, he was given the formula for the furnace fire and the Great Elixir, and through cultivation, attained the Way. Now, he resides in the grotto as the Youthful Prime Marshal and Supreme Marquis, overseeing those who first embark on the Dao.

A note in *True Reports* states: Liu Kuan, styled Wenrao, was a native of Huayin in Hongnong. His father, Liu Qi, served as Minister over the Masses during the reign of Emperor Shun. Kuan was a man of prudence and integrity. Once, a man who had lost his ox came to Kuan’s carriage to claim it. Kuan said nothing, untethered the ox, and gave it to him, then walked home. Soon after, the man who had found the ox returned it, ashamed and fearful. Kuan merely thanked him and sent him away.

In the eighth year of Emperor Huan’s *Yanxi* reign, he became Prefect of Nanyang, where he always used whips made of rushes. In the fifth year of Emperor Ling’s *Jianning* reign, he was appointed Grand Commandant. Once, in the emperor’s presence, he fell asleep after drinking. The emperor asked, "Is the Grand Commandant drunk?" Kuan looked up and replied, "Your servant does not dare to be drunk, but my heavy responsibilities weigh upon my heart like intoxication."

On another occasion, a guest arrived at Kuan’s home, and he sent a servant to buy wine. The servant returned late, thoroughly drunk. The guest cursed him as a "beast." Kuan said, "What greater humiliation could there be? That is why I feared he might take his own life." Later, he was enfeoffed as Marquis of Daixiang with six hundred households. He passed away in the second year of *Zhongping*, aged sixty-six, and was posthumously honored as General of Chariots and Cavalry. His posthumous title was Marquis Zhaodao. His son, Liu Song, succeeded him.

As these accounts differ, they are recorded here in detail.

Minister Dao’s First Account states: Liu Wenrao served in the Han court, regarding the people as his own children—such was the outward manifestation of his virtue and power. Observing his governance, his anger never showed on his face, nor did harsh words escape his lips. He delighted in performing hidden acts of virtue, aiding the cold and destitute. Truly, he could serve as a model for those who withdraw from court and marketplace to cultivate immortality. In general, the accumulation of merit and the refinement of conduct lie in such deeds. The *Daodejing* says: "The sage has no constant heart, taking the people’s heart as his own. Those who are good, I treat with goodness; those who are not good, I also treat with goodness—thus virtue becomes goodness." Could this not describe Liu Wenrao?

Zhao Weipa and Zhao Weibo, natives of Dongjun, were brothers. From youth, they loved the Dao and studied under Master Deng Zhang of Na. In later years, on Mount Zhongyue, they received the Jade Pendant and Golden Cauldron Scripture from Fan Qiulin, the wife of Wei Xingdao, the Han dynasty’s General of Tower Ships. Having attained immortality through Daoist cultivation, she transmitted to them the Way of Embracing the Sun and Moon and the practice of ingesting the essence of the Nine Luminous Mirrors. After achieving the Dao, they entered Huayang within, where Weibo served as Minister of Life Preservation.

The *Hetu* states: "...In Wu and Chu, many have witnessed the Great Peace." When told of this, they said, "These words are not empty; the verification will come soon." The mirrors they preserved were not of the common methods of this world. Weibo was also skilled in the art of whistling—its sound like the rushing wind striking a vast forest or a flock of birds crying in unison. Once, while whistling atop the Celestial Market Altar to summon the wind, clouds soon gathered above, and in an instant, dark mist closed in from all sides, bringing a light rain. The Ministry of Life Preservation had four ministers, with Weibo overseeing the registers of immortals and recording those who studied the Dao. They also summoned sudden rains and the numinous zhi herbs.

Le Changzhi, a native of the village of the Lord of Life in Dongqing, served during the reign of Emperor Huan of Han, rising to the position of Gentleman of the Palace. Later, he studied under Master Li of Mount Zhongyue and received the method of pacing the Seven Primes.

Having cultivated the Dao to fruition, he entered Hua Yang to serve as a Minister of Life Preservation.

Liu Gen
Liu Gen was a native of Yingchuan. He could summon ghosts and concealed himself on Mount Song. When Du Xin, the Prefect of Yingchuan, heard of him, he suspected sorcery and summoned him to the prefectural seat. Xin addressed Gen, saying, "What powers do you possess that you so delude the people?" Gen replied, "I can make men see ghosts." Xin retorted, "Prove it now. If no ghost appears, you shall be executed." Thereupon, Gen glanced left and laughed. In an instant, Xin’s deceased parents appeared before him, bound and reversed. The ghosts reproached him, saying, "You, as a son, have failed to honor us—why trouble the dead?" They then urged Xin, "Hasten to apologize to Master Liu." Xin wept and kowtowed in repentance. Soon after, both Gen and the ghosts vanished, their whereabouts unknown. Within days, Xin also died.

Some say Liu Gen regularly consumed the kernels of jujube pits, rendering him immune to all malevolent influences. A man of the Later Han, Pi Rixiu wrote in a poem to Mao Gongquan:

*Long ago, Liu Gen attained the Dao,
This vale has known him four hundred years.
Matted fur cloaks his form—
They call him the Green-Furred Immortal.*

*I think of the pure spring he drew,
Bored through the narrow ridge’s crest.
Five hues refined to perfection,
A single ladle rings clear.*

*Now with civil and martial fire,
Swiftly he mastered the Yin-Yang Canon.
Crimson basins splash scarlet mist,
Sunlight scatters pale smoke.*

*Consuming it, wings sprouted,
In a flash, he soared to the Dark Heavens.
Though his true reclusion lingers near,
His rites approach a thousand years.*

*I come seeking numinous wonders,
Here to end my days at last.
Drops race like water from a broken spout,
Moss deepens where the incense coils.*

*Clear as jade marrow’s purity,
Bright as gold’s essence, fresh.
Its hue half-mingled with milk,
Its savor wholly lead’s harmony.*

*Drink it, and obstructions melt,
Bathe in it, and the spirit leaps.
At times, those who dine here are struck—
In a trice, wind and thunder rage.*

*White rice threads remain uncut,
Viet jars hold the belly’s ease.
When drawn, moonlight stirs the liquid,
Where borne, water swirls in its wake.*

*Great offerings to the Grand Censor,
Placed before the bell-pavilion’s gate.
Pure as one of unblemished integrity,
It cleanses even the sweeping might of power.*

*Sun-basking rustics feel their spirits rise,
And I, too, pity the lords and marquises.
I know the bitterness of drinking mere water—
Would that I might receive but a single spring’s gourd.*

*The *Nanyue Zongsheng Ji* states: Master Liu Gen cultivated the Great Cavern’s Emperor Yi’s Dao, traveling as an official in all directions, governing with virtue. In his later years, he returned to the eastern peak of Mount Heng, refining his essence to greet the Dipper, ingesting qi and offering sacrifices to the gods, until he transcended in mystery.*

Liu Weidao
Liu Weidao of Zhongshan was a man of the Han. He studied immortality on Mount Pan Zhong for twelve years. An immortal tested him by suspending a stone weighing a hundred thousand *jin* with a single white hair, ordering Weidao to lie beneath it. Weidao’s heart remained at ease, his body joyful, utterly free of fear or dread. After twelve years, the immortal tested him repeatedly in every conceivable way, and at last bestowed upon him a divine elixir. He ascended to heaven in broad daylight.

Xia Fu
Xia Fu, styled Zileng, was a native of Chenliu.

In his youth, he was fond of the Dao and regularly ingested *muhe* and mica. Later, he entered Mount Wu, where he received the *Lianhun* method from the Red-Bearded Master. He also encountered the Perfected One of Mount Tongbai, who transmitted to him the *Huangshui Yunjiang* method, and by practicing it, he attained the Dao.

In his early years, Xia Fu was summoned by the public office, yet he hung the summons on a mulberry tree and departed—such was his lofty and unyielding nature. After achieving the Dao, he became Attendant Gentleman of the Dawn.

The *Later Han Records* and *Biographies of Eminent Recluses* both state: He was a native of Yu in Chenliu, a scholar in his youth. During Emperor Huan’s reign, he was recommended for his forthright speech but declined the appointment. By nature upright and uncompromising, he refused to join the cliques of his time. The powerful despised him, and he was ensnared in the proscription of the party factions. To evade disaster, he cut his beard and hair, altered his appearance, and fled into the forests and mountains, where he worked as a laborer. Later, he returned home but shut his door and refused to see anyone. He died before the party prohibitions were lifted.

Fan Youchong
Fan Youchong was a native of Liaoxi. He once served as Gentleman of the Palace of the Han and was skilled in geomancy. He mastered the Dao of embryonic transformation and altering form, daily visualizing three qi—blue, white, and red—each like a boat, entering his mouth directly from beneath the eastern sun. He embraced them ninety times, stopping only when sated. After ten years of practice, the three-colored qi naturally resided within him, and he attained immortality. This is the *Neijing* method of High Lord Tai Su.

The *True Records* states: Fan the Overseer was this very man, who in former times became a youthful immortal. He now resides in Central Huayang.

Zhongli Jian
Zhongli Jian was a man of the Later Han. He served as Gentleman of the Palace, and together with his younger brother Quan, entered the Three Peaks of Mount Hua and attained the Dao. After his practice was complete, he ascended to heaven in broad daylight.

*Comprehensive Mirror of Perfected Immortals Who Embody the Dao Through the Ages, Volume Twenty-One*

Feng Heng
Feng Heng, styled Junda, was a native of Longxi. From youth, he studied the Dao and mastered the teachings of Laozi and Zhuangzi, diligently seeking true formulas. Initially, he ingested *huanglian* for fifty years, then entered Wu Shou Mountain to gather herbs. Later, he consumed wood for over a hundred years, yet upon returning to his hometown, he appeared as a man of scarcely twenty. Whenever he heard of someone ill or dying—whether acquaintance or stranger—he would offer medicine from the bamboo tube at his waist or apply needles, curing them instantly with a touch. He cherished and conserved his essence and qi, never gazing excessively or speaking boastfully. Of all charts, records, and transmitted texts, there was none he did not study and recite from memory. Later, he encountered Lu Nüsheng, who transmitted to him the formula for *huandan* and the *True Forms of the Five Peaks*, whereupon he traveled throughout the world. Thus, mountain officials and water spirits secretly welcomed and attended him, while malevolent ghosts and strange creatures invariably fled. Some doubted him and sought to harm him with arrows and blades, yet none could injure him. He often rode a black ox, the name of which no one knew, and so he was called the Black Ox Daoist. When Emperor Wu of Wei inquired about the essentials of nurturing life, the Master replied: "Let the body be constantly active, but not to excess; let food be constantly moderate, but not to the point of depletion. Avoid rich and heavy flavors, temper sour and salty tastes, restrain thoughts, curb joy and anger, abandon reckless pursuits, and be cautious in the bedchamber—then you will approach the Dao. Thus, the sage nourishes yang in spring and summer, and yin in autumn and winter, aligning with their root to harmonize with the subtleties of creation." He had two attendants: one carried a stack of books, the other a medicine basket. Among his works were the *Twelve Scrolls of Rongcheng’s Qi-Nurturing Arts*, *Mozi’s Method of Concealing Form*, and the *Scripture of Numinous Treasure Life Preservation*. In his basket were refined *shuang* of mercury, *huanglian* powder, and the like. He lived among people for over two hundred years before vanishing into Yuanqiu Mountain.

Wang Lao
Wang Lao, whose given name is unknown, was a friend of Lu Nüsheng and Feng Junda.

Wang Lao sought the Dao amidst famous mountains and, on the southern slopes of Mount Tai, encountered immortals riding white deer, accompanied by some ten attendants descending from the mountains. Recognizing them as divine beings, he bowed twice and begged for the Way of longevity. The immortal said: "Do you know of Lord Anqi? I am he. Your sincerity has moved Heaven, and the Supreme Lord has sent me to bestow upon you the secret of transcending the world." The *Scripture* states: "Subtle yet ever-present, its use is never exhausted—this is the true Dao." With these words, he ascended into the heavens and departed. Wang Lao practiced all the more diligently; after three years, he could outrun a galloping horse, his skin became lustrous, and his appearance resembled that of a maiden. He could divide his form and transform at will, sitting or standing yet vanishing without trace. He wandered throughout the world, and from time to time, people would catch sight of him.

Zhang Hao
Zhang Hao, styled Wenming, was a native of Runan. During the Yongchu era of Emperor An of the Eastern Han, he was once summoned by imperial decree among the recluses to become a Daoist adept. At the age of twenty, he was selected. One day, Feng Heng summoned him. Zhang Hao, upon seeing him, was filled with reverence and sought enlightenment. Heng, observing his heart, sent him to cross a deep abyss, where he encountered coiled serpents pressing in, yet his countenance remained unchanged. Tempted with beauty and tested with wealth, his heart did not waver. Heng said: "He is teachable." Thereupon, he entrusted him with the *Green Essentials and Purple Writ of the Golden Root Scripture* and half a tael of divine elixir, admonishing him: "Diligence will attain it; negligence will lose it." Zhang Hao prostrated himself and accepted the charge, then entered Mount Chicheng to ingest the elixir and practice the Dao. After a long time, his ears could hear with perfect clarity, and his eyes could see through all things. Whenever seekers of the Dao came to visit, he would sometimes transform into a white crane, sometimes into drifting clouds, soaring through the void and vanishing without a trace. By the Taihe era of Emperor Ming of Wei, he ascended as a perfected immortal.

Wang Shaodao
Wang Shaodao and his like-minded companion Li Boshan often practiced hidden virtues and secret kindnesses to rescue others. Both had cultivated the Dao for generations, their conduct so refined that merit and virtue accumulated until they attained immortality. Shaodao often said to people: "When merit fills three thousand, one ascends to Heaven in broad daylight. With surplus goodness, a cloud chariot descends to receive you. Ceaselessly propagating the Dao, one naturally attains deathlessness." These words are true indeed. Of old, the Perfected One of the Great Ultimate achieved the Dao by manifesting eight bodies in a single day, while Ge Xuan required seven lifetimes to assume the office of Immortal Duke. Yet the merit of accumulated goodness aids the mysterious ancestors above and flows to posterity below—how could it be merely for one’s own longevity? Strive on, exert yourselves; my words are not empty. Both attained the status of divine immortals.

*The Declarations of the Perfected* states: In the Youthful Prime Bureau were Wang Shaodao, Fan Shusheng, and Li Boshan—all paragons of that bureau. Shaodao was Wang Zhu’er of the Han dynasty. Fan Shusheng, Prefect of Shanyang during the Han, hailed from Beidi. Li Boshan, Yellow Gate Gentleman under Emperor Wen of Wei, was the son of Li Zhongfu. His father, Zhongfu, served as Magistrate of Baima during the Han, practicing hidden virtue and accumulating the Dao over generations, his conduct refined and his merit profound. These immortals of the two bureaus all advanced step by step to enter this realm.

The Perfected One Lu Da’an, surnamed Lu and named Guang (also called Da’an), was a native of Neihuang County in Daning Commandery, Xishu. Later, he relocated to Bozhou, being a ninth-generation descendant of Lu Wenshu of the Han. Born at the hour of *zi* on the fifteenth day of the ninth month in the first year of *Han’an* under Emperor Shun, he possessed a spirit of clarity and bones of elegance, with sparse hair and blue eyes. Inheriting his family’s legacy, he mastered the classics and histories. Through the tripartite division of the Three Kingdoms and the founding of the Jin dynasty, as the examination system remained unjust and official advancement grew arduous, he sighed: "From youth, I have been hindered by fate, my fortunes rising and falling with the times. Though I possess the talent to aid the world, how can I contend with the discord between timing and destiny? My schemes come to naught, and my aspirations for merit and fame have now ceased." Thus, he abandoned his home to cultivate the Dao.

Traveling to Heyang, he sought lodging at the home of Mo Yu. The clerk warned: "You cannot stay at the post station—there are malevolent spirits. If you doubt this, misfortune will surely befall you." The Perfected One replied: "I wield a divine sword capable of slaying evil specters. Say no more." He took up residence there. At midnight, a chill wind howled. As he gazed into the darkness, a woman’s sorrowful voice emerged from the courtyard’s miasma: "Noble official, I beg your deliverance. This was once the Zhang family estate, where bandits slaughtered and buried me here. If you would rebury my remains, I may at last attain rebirth." The next day, he excavated the site and indeed unearthed linked white bones, which he interred on a high mound. From that moment, his resolve to pursue the Dao deepened, and he sought widely the arts of delivering the living and transcending death, visiting renowned mountains.

In the fifth year of *Taikang* of Emperor Wu of Jin (the *jiachen* year), on the fifth day of the fifth month, he wandered to Mount Gushe. Beneath an ancient juniper, he suddenly beheld an old man clad in yellow fur, seated upon a stone. Bowing in greeting, he asked: "Why does the master sit alone here?" The elder looked up, sighed deeply, and remained silent for a long while.

The Perfected One’s courtesy was most reverent. After a long while, the old man addressed him: "You have stood by my side for so long—what is it you truly seek?" He observed, "Your official destiny is meager, but your Dao-nature is weighty. In time to come, your name and years shall endure together." Hearing these words, the Perfected One felt as though awakened from a dream. He bowed again and declared, "What your disciple seeks is the Dao."

The elder replied, "The Dao is formless and imageless—how can one seek it?" The Perfected One bowed once more and entreated, "Though the Dao is ineffable, might I obtain the arts of delivering the living and transcending death to save the world?" The old man said, "The Dao, in its wondrousness, gives rise to all things. It is ever-responsive, ever-still, not to be sought by sound nor grasped by effort. Only in preserving serenity, gathering the spirit in stillness, and abiding in the primordial qi, undisturbed by external things, may one then practice the circulation of qi, refine the essence, and temper the spirit—thus transcending the mundane to enter sagehood."

The Perfected One said, "Today, I have heard your instruction, and my heart is as dead ashes. I beseech you, Master, to bestow upon me a single art for saving others and cultivating myself." The elder replied, "You are teachable." Thereupon, he transmitted the *Scripture of the Six Heavens’ As-You-Will Great Method*, saying, "Follow this in practice, and you shall deliver the living and transcend death—its wondrous efficacy is beyond thought. Guard it well." With that, he brushed his sleeves and departed; pursuit was in vain. Turning back, he called to the Perfected One, "After thirty years, we shall meet again."

From then on, the Perfected One retreated to the Immortal’s Palm Peak of Mount Hua to cultivate. On the fifteenth night of the tenth month in the second year of *Yongxi* under Emperor Hui, he dreamed that the Most High Lord Lao commanded his right attendant jade youth to bestow ten jade keys, which he combined with the elder’s earlier scripture. Upon waking, his spirit was enlightened, and his mind unsealed. From that time, his written talismans, qi-circulation practices, and healing arts—whether curing illness or expelling evil—were all efficacious without fail.

By the first year of *Yongkang*, blood rain fell upon the Qin region, baleful stars appeared at noon, and pestilential toxins spread, causing the people to perish unjustly. The Perfected One reverently distributed talismanic water and lit Primordial Lamps; after thirty days, the calamity subsided. In the first month of the second year of *Yongkang*, tigers and rhinoceroses entered the city, stirring unrest among the people, yet none could stop them. At the time, Wang Rong held the position of chief minister. Emperor Hui rebuked him: "You bear the weight of the realm’s governance—how have such creatures come to harass my people? I now issue an edict to summon men to exterminate them."

The Perfected One was Wang Rong’s nephew by marriage. He approached the posted notice and said to Rong, "I possess an art to restrain these beasts." Rong, hearing his nephew’s words, memorialized the emperor, who summoned him to court. The Perfected One petitioned to be allowed to remove the harm from the people, and the emperor granted him full authority. Invoking the Primordial Method, he summoned the tigers and rhinoceroses, which flew through the air to him. The emperor was astonished. The Perfected One spat water and intoned over them, transforming them into toads, which he then absorbed with his qi. The city was at once pacified.

Delighted, the emperor praised and questioned him: "You are a true Heavenly Master of our dynasty, sharing the same title as the Heavenly Master of Han, though in a different age, yet with the same merit." He bestowed upon him a green robe with vermilion trim, a black silk sash, jade rings, gold, and silk. The Perfected One smiled but declined, memorializing: "To aid the state and save the people—how could I defile myself with material rewards?" He then returned to Mount Hua, transmitting the *Primordial Record* to Ding Yi, the *Primordial Scripture* to Guo Pu, the *Primordial Method* to Xu Jingyang, and the *Primordial Acupuncture* to the wondrous adept Zhu Xian.

On the twelfth day of the eighth month in the first year of *Da’an*, he dreamed that the Most High Lord Lao said to him: "Your name and years are now one—you may ascend to the heavens, to assist the Purple Tenuity and the Northern Pole Great Emperor, assuming the office of Controller of Destinies Perfected Lord. Furthermore, you shall descend to the mortal realm every third and ninth day of each month to examine men’s merits and transgressions. Those facing disasters, calamities, or urgent perils shall be delivered at the sound of your call." Upon waking, his body felt light; in an instant, he soared into the heavens and departed. His Primordial Method endures in the world to this day.

**Wang Zhen**
Wang Zhen was a native of Shangdang.

At seventy-nine, he took up the Dao, practicing the art of embryonic respiration and abstaining from grains for over thirty years. His complexion remained youthful and fair, his gait swift enough to outpace a galloping horse, and his strength equal to that of several men. When Emperor Wu of Wei heard of him, he summoned the man for an audience, estimating his age at no more than thirty. Suspecting deception, the emperor investigated his hometown, where all witnesses—many of whom had known him since their own childhood—spoke with one voice: Wang Zhen was already four hundred years old. Convinced of his mastery of the Way, the emperor held him in the highest reverence.

**Chen Chang**
Chen Chang dwelled on Mount Fenyu for over six hundred years. The people of Fenyu Mountain built him a dwelling and, with each season, prepared sacrificial offerings of meat and wine. Though Chen never partook of food or drink, his appearance remained that of a man in his sixties. Whenever his devotees fell ill, they would bring vessels to him, begging for consecrated water to drink, and all were cured. For generations, the people of Fenyu Mountain served him in succession, yet none knew his origins or the details of his diet and practices. Fenyu lies in the Eastern Sea; those from Wu who accidentally landed there remained for three years before returning, recounting all they had witnessed. The mountain spans a thousand *li* in circumference, home to over a thousand households. Its five grains ripen in abundance, though none know the era of its founding. Its customs mirror those of Wu.

**Wang Hui**
The Daoist Wang Hui was a man of the Wei era and a disciple of the White Ram Master. He resided in the Cavern of the Bear’s Den on Mount Hua, within the *Zhen* Abbey. He often cultivated Solomon’s seal by the streamside, where tigers plowed the earth for him and leopards weeded the fields. He rode tigers and leopards as mounts, outfitting them with saddles and bridles, guiding them with a whip as one would a horse—no different in practice. He subsisted on Solomon’s seal and *cangmu*, having done so for many years.

Wang Hui later transmitted the Daoist arts to Wang Fachong, then departed through *shijie* corpse-liberation. His disciples buried his cap and sandals to the left of the cliff, where a yellow cloud settled above them. He once composed over a hundred words of esoteric instructions to teach others, yet none could comprehend them. The verses read:

The Yellow Emperor ascended to Dinghu Lake,
Riding the plain into purple mist.
Bright essence and yin do not endure long—
As fate turns, dragons wheel in flight.
Withered forests soon shall fade,
Gleaming scales sink in the deep abyss.
Wandering immortals soar through clouded heights,
Delighting in the endless flow of years.
By day, cast no tortoise-shell divination;
At dusk, sing where verdant hues arise.
The Central Peak anchors harmonious qi,
The *banshu* completes the scroll as one.
Should you grasp its meaning,
A measure of gold shall be your reward.

**Chang Ji**
Chang Ji’s origins are unknown. While gathering firewood in the mountains, he was crushed by a collapsing cliff and fell to his death, though a faint breath remained. His wife arrived to find him, weeping in grief. The immortal Yin Yi, moved by her sorrow, said to her, “I am an immortal and can heal your husband.” He gave her medicine along with the formula, instructing, “If the first dose does not fully restore him, prepare more as needed. With prolonged use, it will make one an immortal.” The wife administered the medicine, and Ji recovered. After compounding and consuming the remedy for a thousand days, he suddenly ascended in flight. His wife, weeping, pursued him, whereupon he turned and said, “The Dao differs from the world—take care to honor yourself.” Filled with resolve, she too prepared the medicine and took it for three years, then likewise flew away. She reached Mount Penglai, where Ji greeted her, saying, “I knew you would come.”

**Zhang Xuanbin**
Zhang Xuanbin was a native of Dingxiang.

During the reign of Emperor Wu of Wei, Zhang Xuanbin was nominated as a *maocai* (esteemed talent). Returning to his hometown, he became a disciple of Ji Gong of Xihe, receiving the arts of ingesting wood, practicing the *Dongfang Baiyuan* (White Prime of the Cavern Chamber). Later, he encountered Fan Ziming on Mount Shaoshi, who taught him the Dao of concealment, transformation, and hidden radiance. Formerly dwelling on Mount Tianzhu, he now serves as the *Lijin Bo* (Master of Water and Rain) in Huayang. The *Zhen Gao* states: The *Lijin Bo* is an official who also oversees the guardianship of life as a steward of the realm.

Xuanbin was skilled in discoursing on *wu* (non-being). He said: "The *yuan* (primordial) is the dwelling of *dayou* (great being), while *xiaoyou* (small being) arises from it. By accumulating *xiaoyou* to nurture *xiaoyuan* (small primordial), one perceives *dayou* as the root of *dayuan* (great primordial). Being arises from *yuan*, and *yuan* arises from being. Thus, my eyes see no things, nor do things see *yuan*. By lodging in being to perfect *yuan*, and lodging in *yuan* to attain *yuan*—there, *yuan* is the dwelling of *yuan*, and the great void is also the dwelling of *yuan*. Before my birth, all under heaven was *yuanyuan* (primordial primordiality)."

His arguments were so well-founded that even the immortals of Mount Tongbai could not refute them. He claimed to have once visited Song Chensheng on Mount Penglai. Song Chensheng was the Left Immortal Elder of Penglai, and in their discussion of *yuan*, Xuanbin roughly grasped the essential meaning.

Minister Dao Yi said: "To discuss the Dao through the single word *yuan* is truly to grasp the subtlety of the Dao." The *Daode Jing* states: "*Wu* (non-being) is named the beginning of heaven and earth; *you* (being) is named the mother of the myriad things. Thus, by constantly abiding in *wu*, one observes its mystery; by constantly abiding in *you*, one observes its manifestations. These two emerge together yet bear different names, both called *xuan* (profound)." It also says: "The myriad things under heaven are born of *you*; *you* is born of *wu*." Zhang Xuanbin must have deeply grasped this principle, though he expressed it only obliquely.

**Wang Zhonglun**
On Mount Wushi in Gaotang County stood a cliff over a hundred *ren* high. When struck with objects, the rock emitted a clear, resonant sound. During the *Taikang* era of Emperor Wu of Jin, the reclusive scholar Tian Xuan dwelled beneath the cliff, delighting in the wind, frost, and moon amid the village stones. Often, he saw a man in a plain white robe pacing the cliff’s edge, departing only at dawn. Later, Tian Xuan had someone strike the rock while lying in wait within the cliff. When the man appeared, they swiftly seized his sleeve and entreated him. He revealed: "I am Wang Zhonglun, a native of Wei. During the reign of King Xuan of Zhou, I entered Mount Shaoshi to study the Dao. Passing through this place on my frequent journeys to Mount Fang, I grew fond of the stone’s resonance and lingered to listen."

Tian Xuan earnestly begged for the secret of longevity. Wang left him a stone the size of a sparrow’s egg, saying, "This will allow you to abstain from grain." At their parting, he ascended over a hundred paces into the air, still visible, until gradually obscured by mist. Tian Xuan held the stone in his mouth and went a hundred days without hunger.

**Peng Qiu**
Peng Qiu, styled Bojian, was a native of Beihai.

During the *Taishi* era of Emperor Wu of Jin, Peng Qiu entered the western Jade Maiden Mountain of Juqiu to fell timber. Suddenly, he detected a strange fragrance. Following the scent with the wind, he saw the mountain open of its own accord, revealing palaces dense with verdure and towers vast and bright. Peng Qiu entered the gate and peered within, where he beheld five jade trees. Advancing further, he saw four immortal maidens playing *weiqi* in a hall. Upon seeing him, they all rose in surprise and asked, "Master Peng, how have you come here?" Peng Qiu replied, "I followed the fragrance and arrived." With that, they resumed their game as before. A younger maiden ascended a tower to play the zither, jesting, "Why has Yuanhui alone gone up to the tower?" Peng Qiu stood beneath the trees, sating his hunger by licking the dew that dripped from their leaves.

Presently, a woman arrived riding a crane and said, "Jade Flower Cloud, why do you entertain this mortal here? The Queen Mother has ordered Wang Fangping to inspect the immortal chambers—he must depart at once." Terrified, Peng Qiu exited the gate, and when he turned back, all had vanished. Upon returning home, he found it was already the *Jianzhong* era; his former dwelling and estate had become graves and ruins.

Having thus roamed through renowned mountains in search of the Dao, he never returned.

**Bao Shuo**
Bao Shuo, styled Taixuan, was a native of Chenliu. From youth, he possessed keen insight and profound understanding of the mysterious and subtle, his mind deeply absorbed in the arcane—none could fathom him. Some accounts state he served as Governor of Nanhai, where he attained secret methods and awakened to the truth of the Dao, receiving the essential precepts of true immortality from Chen Mu. According to the *Records of Grotto Heavens*, Shuo and his sister were reborn from former lives. Their seven-times-great-grandfathers, Li Zhan and Zhang Lü, both natives of Beixiang in Duling, had once lodged together at an inn by the Wei Bridge. There, they accumulated hidden virtues, cherished the Dao, and longed for transcendence, and so their blessings extended to Shuo and his kin. Though their lineages changed across generations and their surnames altered, they were reunited as kin by heaven’s design. Though their ancestral roots differed, the shade of their virtue remained the same.

Shuo studied the classics and mastered astrological prognostication. He became a disciple of Zuo Yuanfang, receiving the Central Scripture’s methods and the essential techniques for summoning the Three Sovereigns and Five Peaks, which he practiced with divine efficacy. He could command ghosts and spirits, seal mountains, and subdue demons. In the first year of *Daxing* under Emperor Yuan of Jin, Shuo briefly traveled east of the Yangtze. On the northern road of Jiang Mountain, he encountered a youth of sixteen or seventeen, radiant in countenance. They walked together for several *li*, but the youth’s steps grew gradually swifter, and Shuo, though riding a galloping horse, could not keep pace, falling ever farther behind. He asked, “Judging by your gait, you must be one who has attained the Dao.” The youth replied, “I am the immortal Yin Changsheng. The Most High has sent me to Red City. You have long yearned for the Dao, and thus you were permitted to see me.” Shuo dismounted and bowed, inquiring after his well-being, but before he could speak further, Yin said, “This land will see war and bloodshed in ten years.” Later, during Su Jun’s rebellion, the prophecy was fulfilled to the decade.

Yin continued, “You have long aspired to the Dao, and I shall deliver you.” The immortal arts teach that for those who attain transcendence, *shijie*—corpse liberation—is the most wondrous method. The higher form of *shijie* employs a blade, the lower a bamboo or wooden implement. Both require a brush dipped in divine elixir to inscribe the *Tai Shang Tai Xuan Yin Sheng Fu* upon the blade’s edges, whereupon the characters vanish in an instant. The inscribed face and body then perish upon the forest floor, while the true self escapes, never to return home. The family, believing the blade to be the deceased, mourns accordingly. The method with bamboo or wood follows the same principle. Yin then transmitted this Way to Shuo.

He further discussed the rise and fall of the Jin dynasty with Shuo, expounding one as ten and ten as a hundred to convey the reign’s duration to Emperor Yuan. Shuo claimed these were calculations from his astrological studies, never revealing they came from Yin’s teachings—a silence Yin had enjoined. The *Illustrated Records of Mount Luofu* state that when Ge Zhichuan resided on Luofu, Shuo, then Governor of Nanhai, was renowned for his mastery of the Dao. Once, while inspecting his domain by sea, he was caught in a storm and, ravenous, boiled white stones to eat. He was close to Zhichuan and often visited the mountain, sometimes debating until dawn before departing. When people saw him arrive, there were no carriages or horses—only a pair of swallows flying to and fro. When questioned, he revealed they were but a pair of slippers.

The *Collected Immortal Biographies of Pengcheng* records that Shuo married his daughter to Ge Hong. Later, Shuo returned to Danyang and was buried at Shizigang. When Su Jun’s rebellion erupted, his coffin was opened, but no corpse was found—only a great blade. As the rebels sought to take it, thunderous sounds of soldiers and horses arose from the tomb’s surroundings. Startled, they turned to see the blade humming with a roar like thunder, and the rebels fled in terror. After the rebellion was quelled, the blade was recovered and buried anew.

The *True Reports* states that Shuo became a subterranean overseer, bearing the title *True Man of Qian Mountain*. After five hundred years, he would serve as *Keeper of the Kunlun Chambers*. The *Book of Jin* records: Bao Shuo, styled Taixuan, was a native of Donghai. At five, he told his parents, “I was once a child of the Li family in Quyang. At nine, I fell into a well and died.” His parents sought out the Li household, and all details matched. Shuo’s learning spanned both exoteric and esoteric traditions; he mastered astronomy and the *River Chart* and *Luo Scripture*. Later, he became Governor of Nanhai. Once, while inspecting his domain by sea, he was caught in a storm and, starving, boiled white stones to sustain himself. He once met the immortal Yin Jun, who transmitted the Dao’s essential precepts to him. He lived over a hundred years before passing.

**Xu Mai**
Xu Mai, styled Shu Xuan and nicknamed Ying, was a native of Juqu in Danyang. His family had long been of noble lineage, their eminence passed down through generations.

Xu Ying, from childhood, was drawn to the Dao. As the *True Records* states: "With a pure and empty heart, he embraced the Dao, dwelling far beyond the worldly realm," and so he changed his name to Yuanyou. He associated with the Wang family, father and sons, and Wang Youcheng treated him with repeated reverence. According to a handwritten transmission of the Six Jia Yin-Yang Talismans: "In the first year of Yongchang, at twenty-three years of age," this places his birth in the first year of Yongkang, the gengshen year. Yet genealogical records state that in the autumn of the fourth year of Yonghe, he severed all ties with the world at West Mountain in Lin’an, aged forty-eight. This would make the first year xinyou, one year short of his age; here, his own account is taken as correct, making him forty-nine at the time of his departure. He married the daughter of Sun Chong, styled Yanda, of Wu Commandery—granddaughter of General-in-Chief Sun Xiu.

Once, he consulted Guo Pu for a divination, drawing the hexagram *Great Strength* transforming into *Great Possession*, with the top line activated. Guo Pu told Ying: "Your primordial fortune descends from Heaven; you should study the Dao of light ascent." Earlier, Bao Shuo had transmitted to him the Central Scripture’s methods and the *Inner Writings of the Three Sovereigns*. One day, he bid farewell to his family and departed, never to return. He entered the Suspended Torrent Mountain in Lin’an, unbound his hair, shed his burdens, and took the name Yuanyou. He consumed the wood essence and yellow essence, gradually reaping their benefits, focusing his mind on the subtle and imperceptible, day and night without ceasing. Over several years, he secretly perceived the mysteries of the Void, and the Supreme One True Person, the Record-Keeper Lord Mao, descended to transmit the supreme methods. Thereupon, he mastered embryonic breathing and inner vision, pacing the Dipper in reclusion. With each communion, he neared transcendence beyond the Milky Way.

Later, he moved to Red City in Lin’an, where he encountered Wang Shilong, Zhao Daoxuan, and Fu Taichu. Yuanyou then took Shilong as his teacher, receiving the Dao of Unbinding and Reverse Circulation, and ingested the Jade Fluid and Morning Brain Essence. Within three years, his face bore the glow of youth. As Yuanyou attained the Dao, the Three Offices issued a general prohibition, dispatching the Custodian of the Registers, Zhou Fang, and the Enforcer of Transgressions, Yan Baihu, each bearing a cinnabar tablet of his transgressions to interrogate him. Had his answers been inadequate, they would have seized him. Fortunately, Gong Youjie and Li Kailin came to his aid.

Yuanyou, greatly alarmed, forced a long laugh, rebuked them sternly, and replied: "The Great Dao is impartial, bestowing only upon the good; Heaven and Earth are without favor, sparing only those of virtue. Thus, when the Ban Spring flowed with blood, did the dragon’s beard spare the Three Miao? When the Crimson Wilderness saw the battle of Zhuolu, did the crimson grasses hinder the divine transformations of the Great Sage, his lofty communion and ascent? My seventh-generation ancestor, Xu Zia, accumulated benevolence and amassed virtue, secretly aiding birds and beasts. In years of famine and pestilence, when a hundred were left with but one survivor, Zia dispersed his wealth to save them, personally preparing remedies. Lives on the brink of death hung in his hands, and those he delivered numbered four hundred and eight. The virtue he bequeathed to us should yield five immortals, all recorded in the Azure Palace—how could the likes of you presume to interfere?"

As the *True Records* states: "The Prefect’s seventh-generation ancestor, Ziao, styled Zia, performed deeds of relief and kindness." Yet upon consulting the genealogy, his seventh-generation ancestor was named Jing, styled Wuqing, who served as Minister of Ceremonies under Emperor An and was appointed Grand Commandant in the first year of Yongjian under Emperor Shun. The names and styles differ from the *True Records*, and the reason for this discrepancy remains unclear. In the second year of Yongchu under Emperor An, a great famine struck: a *dou* of grain cost two thousand coins, and people resorted to cannibalism. If he saved four hundred and eight lives, it must have been during this time. The *Discussions on Han Offices* by Ying Zhu records a memorial by Cui Yuan, which states: "Xu Jing, nearly a hundred years old, still holds the position of Grand Commandant." Thus, not only did his hidden virtue flow to his descendants, but Jing’s manifest merit was renowned in his own time, ensuring his longevity, safety, and ascent to the highest offices. His son Xun and grandson Xiang both became the Three Excellencies. Since their migration south of the Yangtze, their lineage has flourished, ultimately attaining divine transcendence.

When he finished speaking, the Lord of Life’s Destiny dispatched the Listener-in-Waiting, Li Zun, who arrived grasping a bell. Zhou Fang and his companions laughed and fled, whereupon Yuanyou was delivered to the Eastern Palace and ranked among the middle-grade earthbound immortals. Yuanyou’s fifth younger brother, Mu, also attained the Dao at the same time.

The *Book of Jin*’s biographies state: "Xu Mai, styled Shuxuan, was a native of Jurong in Danyang. His family had long been an official clan, yet Mai, from youth, was serene and indifferent, showing no ambition for official advancement. At the time, his father was still living, and he could not bear to leave his parents. He noted that Suspended Torrent Mountain in Yuhang was near Maoshan in Yanling, the western gate of Dongting, which grinds through the Five Peaks. There, he established a meditation hut. On the first and fifteenth of each month, he returned home solely to pay his respects. After his parents passed away, he sent his wife, née Sun, back to her family and roamed the famous mountains, gathering herbs on Changshan in Tonglu County. He consumed the wood essence for three years, intending to cease grain consumption. Finding this mountain too near human habitation to focus, he enclosed it on all sides. Those who wished to meet this devotee of the Dao could not do so. He regularly practiced qi absorption, sustaining a single breath for over a thousand cycles."

Later, he moved to the Western Mountains of Lin’an and changed his name to Xuan, styled Yuanyou. He wrote a letter to bid farewell to his wife. When Wang Xizhi visited him, they would often spend entire days together, forgetting to return, forming a bond beyond the mundane world. Xuan wrote to Xizhi: "From Shanyin south to Lin’an, there are many golden halls and jade chambers, as well as immortal herbs and mushrooms. Zuo Yuanfang and his followers, along with all those who attained the Dao in the late Han, reside there." Thereafter, Xuan’s fate became unknown, and those devoted to the Dao all claimed he had ascended as a feathered immortal.

Xu Mu, styled Sixuan, also named Mi, had an ancestor named Shang and a father named Fu. From a young age, Mu was renowned. When Emperor Jianwen of Jin was still a prince, Mu became his close companion. He began his career as a scholar at the Imperial Academy and was gradually promoted to Gentleman Attendant at the Yellow Gates and Chief Clerk of the Protector-General. Though he wore the robes of office, his heart yearned for the Dao and virtue. When his fourth elder brother, Yuanyou, pursued the distant and never returned, Mu submitted a memorial to resign his honors. Emperor Taizong respected his resolve and did not oppose it. Mu then settled on Maoshan, where, alongside Yang Xi, he delved into the profound mysteries of the numinous. Heaven bestowed upon him jade tablets, appointing him as a Perfected One of Highest Clarity. At the age of seventy-two, he shed his mortal coil. The *True Reports* states: "Mu was refined and pure in disposition, erudite and gifted in literary composition. Emperor Jianwen long regarded him as a paragon above worldly concerns, and he associated with many of the era’s worthies. In his youth, he served as a clerk in the commandery and as a secretary in the office of merit."

Wang Dao and Cai Mo both summoned him as an Attendant Gentleman of Linchuan, but he declined. Later selected to fill a vacancy as Erudite of the National University, he was then appointed Magistrate of Yuyao. Returning to the capital, he served as Gentleman of the Secretariat, Rectifier of the Capital District, Attendant Gentleman of the Protectorate, Palace Attendant, and Cavalier Attendant-in-Ordinary. Outwardly, he blended with worldly affairs, yet inwardly he cultivated the study of the true. Secretly receiving teachings and records, he followed the supreme Dao. By the measure of his innate portion, he became a Perfected One of Highest Clarity, his rank elevated to that of a marquis or earl, his position among the secondary ministers and directors. He aided in the governance of immortals and assisted the sagely in shepherding the people. He passed away in the first year of Taikang during the reign of Emperor Xiaowu, at the age of seventy-one. His wife, a daughter of Tao Wei of the same commandery named Kedou, died during the Xingning era and likewise entered the teachings of the School of Easy Transformation. Emperor Wu of Liang later established a shrine, the Hall of the Perfected, on the mountain in his honor. The former residence of the Attendant Gentleman was, in the thirteenth year of Tianjian, converted into Zongyang Abbey, which is today’s Ziyang Abbey. A well south of the residence was dug by the Attendant Gentleman himself. To the south lies a pond, constructed by the four courts of Guo to dam Liugu Valley, known as Gong Spring. The *Records of Maoshan* states: "North of Minor Maoshan lies a mountain called Leiping. To its northwest stands the former residence of the Perfected One of Highest Clarity, Attendant Gentleman Xu, now an abbey. Before the abbey is the sacred altar of the Perfected One."

Hu Qian, a native of Wei Commandery...

Hu Qian was by nature unrestrained and unconventional, unashamed of coarse clothing or simple fare. Fond of wine, he cared nothing for its quality or refinement. He would often chant:

*"The wind enters through the window’s chink,
Wine sways within the cup’s embrace.
Forty-nine in hand, I grip,
While numinous light shines from above.
Beneath the towering catalpa’s shade,
Alone I laugh at mysteries profound."*

And again:

*"Advance—I’ll not scale the Dragon Gate,
Retreat—I’ll not seek rank or fame.
To while away the endless day,
Ever drunk, ever towering high."*

Skilled in *Yi* divination, he often practiced his craft before the shop of a woman named Xu in the back alleys of Jiankang. For each reading, he charged one hundred coins, stopping once he had earned five hundred a day—never accepting a second reading for a thousand. His mother lived west of Shangfang Gate, and each day he gave her three hundred coins for her support. The remaining two hundred he spent on wine, either drinking himself or sharing with the poor and destitute.

Once, Emperor Hai Xi of Jin went out at dawn and saw a crimson serpent coiled upon the imperial carriage, only for it to vanish moments later. He summoned Hu Qian to divine the omen using the *Forest of Changes*. Qian said, "The Jin house stands firm as bedrock, but Your Majesty bears the sign of one who must depart the palace." The emperor asked, "Can this be averted?" Qian replied, "In two years, a great general will suffer defeat in a northern campaign. If you dispatch thirty thousand men to intercept him north of Shouchun, this disaster may be dispelled."

The following autumn, Huan Wen’s northern expedition ended in failure. Blaming Yu Province Inspector Yuan Zhen for failing to provide reinforcements, he executed him. Returning to Stone Citadel, Huan deposed Hai Xi and enthroned Emperor Jianwen. When Huan’s concubine later gave birth with great difficulty, Qian divined, "In the sixth stable west of your residence, a wall will collapse—once this happens, the crisis will pass. The child will be a son, his voice and spirit fierce and mighty, destined to shake the four seas." Huan rewarded Qian with three hundred thousand coins. Qian said, "I always struggle to spend my divination earnings, and besides, I have no place to store money. Please return it to the treasury." Huan refused.

The Xu family lent Qian an empty chest to hold the coins, but soon after, Huan’s wife sent another three hundred thousand. After receiving Huan’s money, Qian divined three times daily to support his mother, while spending the rest on wine, inviting all who could hold their drink—whether acquaintances or strangers—to join him in revelry. His following grew large, and the Xu family always treated him with the courtesy due a worthy, never questioning how much he drank.

Later, Qian severed ties and no longer visited the Xu household. After searching for him for over a year, they suddenly encountered him by the Qiao Ditch. "We need the chest back," they said. "Please return home to retrieve the money you left with us." Qian laughed and replied, "In three years, I’ve drunk several thousand *dou* of wine—only forty days’ worth would cover the debt. There’s barely a hundred and fifty coins left. You needn’t trouble yourself further. I’ve scratched a tally on the wall with my nail; check it yourself, and you’ll find not a single coin missing." The Xu family tested his words and found the account exact.

Later, when Qian’s mother passed away in the night, Qian returned at dawn and said, “The green is exhausted.” He buried her and departed, and none knew where he went. Several days later, members of the Xu household saw Qian on the roadside near Luoxing. At first, they thought him drunk and grasped his hand to lead him, only to find an empty robe with no body inside.

Minister Dao Yi remarked: Hu Qian nurtured his mother with filial devotion, never seeking fame or profit. Within, he cultivated the utmost Dao; without, he blended with the dust and light. Each divination he cast earned him a hundred coins, but he limited himself to five hundred coins a day. Most he offered to his mother, a little he kept for himself, and if a second divination was needed, he required a thousand coins—yet he was not avaricious. Had he not been so restrained, how could he have reached such a state?

The *Dao De Jing* says: Which is dearer, name or self? Which is greater, self or wealth? Which is more harmful, gain or loss? Thus, excessive attachment brings great expense, and hoarding invites heavy loss. Knowing contentment averts disgrace; knowing when to stop prevents peril—this is how one endures.

Hu Qian truly mastered this Dao.

*Comprehensive Mirror of Perfected Immortals Embodying the Dao Throughout the Ages, Scroll Twenty-One* (conclusion)
*Comprehensive Mirror of Perfected Immortals Embodying the Dao Throughout the Ages, Scroll Twenty-Two*

Du Bing, styled Shugong, was a native of Qiantang in the state of Wu. At eighteen, while playing with his peers outside the northern walls of the city, an elderly man called out to Yu, saying: "This youth bears an extraordinary countenance. Alas, I am too old to witness what he will become."

Yu had been orphaned young and served his stepmother with utmost filial piety, his reputation spreading throughout the village and commandery. Thrice summoned to office, he declined. Sighing, he said: "Now is a time when the realms of men and spirits are in chaos—only the primordial qi of the Orthodox Unity can bring order."

Thereupon, he became a disciple of Chen Wenzi of Yuhang, receiving the methods of the Orthodox Unity. His cures proved effective, and the people flocked to him. One night, a divine being descended, declaring: "I am Zhang Zhennan. You are destined to transmit my Daoist arts, so I have come to bestow upon you their secret essentials and the canonical rites of the Yangping governance."

Whenever Yu entered meditation and burned incense, he could perceive the fortunes and misfortunes of the people for three to five generations, foretelling them with perfect clarity. His written talismans and consecrated water worked instantaneously, and Daoists and layfolk from near and far gathered like clouds to follow his teachings. Within a decade, the households pledging their rice offerings numbered in the tens of thousands.

During the tenure of the Jin Grand Tutor Xie An as Governor of Wuxing, he once observed a radiance of yellow and white and inquired of Yu about it. Yu replied: "Your ancestors accumulated hidden virtue among the people, and their blessings flow to their descendants—you shall rise to the highest rank among ministers."

The Director of the Imperial Secretariat, Lu Na, had seen his forebears afflicted by creeping paralysis at the end of their lives. When Na was just over thirty, he suddenly received a memorial stating: "The eldest scion of the Lu family shall pass through this trial." Yu then transmitted to him the *Lingfei San* formula. After taking it, Na declared that he would live to seventy-nine.

When Sima Huan Wen launched his northern expedition, he asked Yu whether he would achieve victory. Yu replied: "Next year, in the third month, you shall undertake a campaign alone and blunt the enemy’s edge." When Huan Wen reached Fangtou, the Stone Gate remained sealed, the waters dried up, and provisions ran out. He was captured by the Xianbei and said to his disciple Taoye: "I regret not heeding Master Du’s words, and thus have met with this defeat."

Before Fu Jian reached Shouchun, the General of Chariots and Cavalry, Xie Xuan, led troops to campaign against him. Xie asked Yu about the outcome. Yu said: "We must not advance—if we do, we shall fail. They must not come—if they do, they shall be utterly routed. This is the season for you to render your service." Fu Jian was indeed defeated and scattered.

Lu Lian styled himself "Master" and was always accompanied by over three hundred disciples. Yu reported to Huan Wen: "Lian is but a demonic essence of withered wood, deceiving the common folk. Soon he shall storm the palace gates, and only then will he perish." During the Xian’an era of Emperor Jianwen of Jin, in the dead of night, Lian led several hundred men and women straight into the palace, proclaiming the restoration of the deposed Emperor Hai Xi. The imperial guards swiftly suppressed them, and only then did Huan Wen sigh in admiration.

Later, Huan Chong sought to appoint Yu’s descendant Yu Xigai as an attendant official, but Yu declined, saying: "My children and grandchildren are all short-lived; I do not wish them to enter officialdom. Only in my fifth-generation descendant shall my blessings manifest." Yu also stated: "After my passing, there will be those who usurp my methods to disrupt the Great Dao—this is but a minor purge, akin to the Yellow Turbans, and shall soon vanish." He wrote these words on plain silk, sealed them in a box, and entrusted them to his wife, Lady Feng, instructing: "Should calamity or omen arise, open this and show it to our nephews and sons, that they may diligently cultivate virtue and guard themselves."

During the Long’an era of Emperor An, Sun Tai of Langye was executed for sorcery and deception, bringing ruin and misfortune to many. Yu suddenly gathered disciples for days on end, indulging in revelry without restraint. He ordered his scribe, Chong Tao, to purchase funeral implements in the market and had his family sew mourning garments, declaring: "On the twenty-sixth day of the third month, at noon, I shall depart." Shortly after, he fell mildly ill, and on the appointed day, he lay down in his chamber, his body softening as his qi dissipated. His Daoist followers and disciples erected a stele for him, posthumously honoring him as the "Illustrious Master."

Zhu Ku
Zhu Ku was a man of unknown origin.

Zhu Ku had long ingested mineral elixirs, practiced spring breath-holding, abstained from grains, and consumed talismanic water, never feeling hunger or thirst, growing robust and ageless. Suddenly, he declared: "I am destined for transcendence and shall depart on an appointed day." Taking leave of his kin and old friends, he said: "There will be those who come to welcome me." Clad in a single robe and white boots, in an instant, two yellow cranes descended into the central courtyard. Zhu Ku then ascended beyond the world. Three yellow cranes followed in the courtyard, flying toward the outskirts east of the city, while three Daoist adepts in yellow robes walked hand in hand toward the east. He entrusted a letter to a villager to deliver to his family. When his family examined his body, only an empty husk remained.

Jiang Bozhen
Jiang Bozhen was a man of unknown origin. From youth, he was fond of the Dao. While gathering herbs on Mount Meng, he suddenly encountered the immortal Shi Bozhen. Standing upright in the midday sun, he turned to observe his shadow behind him, only to find his heart misaligned. The immortal said: "You have studied diligently to the utmost, yet remain unaware that the misalignment of your heart is a flaw." Thereupon, he taught him to ingest *shinao*. *Shinao* is mottled in color, soft in texture, and shaped like small stones, found everywhere. After prolonged ingestion, the body grows warm yet does not thirst, and one may eventually attain transcendence. Fan Yangzi, who also consumed it, likewise achieved the Dao.

Wang Ba
Wang Ba was a man of the Liang dynasty.

He ascended at Yishan in Sanshan, Fuzhou—now the site of Zhongxu Palace—where the soapberry tree still stands. Wang Ba once inscribed the elixir formula on gold tablets and buried them behind the mountain; those who later unearthed them also attained the Dao.

The formula states:
Gold is the essence of cinnabar,
Teeth are the foundation of lead.
Grasp but the root and branch,
And in practice you shall not err.
After one full cycle of refinement,
Open the furnace to succeed—
Crimson and violet rays will strike the eye,
Dazzling in radiant splendor.
Ground fine as powdered fat,
Grains like sesame seeds.
Take one each day,
Never recklessly increase.
Bones transform to golden substance,
Countenance regains youthful bloom.
Should you wish to transmute,
A single grain’s power
Turns ten ounces of dry mercury
Instantly to horse-tooth silver.

Later, Cai Junmo left this inscription:
The perfected one’s jade bones are light,
Riding the qi to ascend Jasper Terrace.
Bowing his head to gaze below,
Ten thousand hamlets lie in foul dust.
Incense and flame long extinguished,
Mountains and rivers stand desolate.
The old tree entwined with green vines,
The empty grave overgrown with purple moss.
In serene meditation, the white day lingers,
A long chant summons the clear breeze.
Falling blossoms scatter like chess pieces,
Wandering bees alight on wine cups.
In the fair moon, much drinking,
Noble guests truly rare talents.
How could immortality be hoped for?
When will the golden crucible open?
*Yuanzang ji*

The Sui dynasty recluse Yuan Zangji served as an adjudicator for a maritime envoy. Caught in a storm, his ship broke apart, and he drifted on wreckage to an island. The locals said: "This is Cangzhou, tens of thousands of li from the Middle Kingdom. The island spans a thousand li, its flowers and trees ever in the bloom of the second or third month, and its people rarely die. Here grow split-stem melons two feet long, green dates and red chestnuts, all as large as pears. In the pools swim four-legged fish, and women gather golden lotus blossoms for their hair—without wearing them, one may not dwell among the immortals."

Zangji suddenly longed for China, so the islanders fashioned for him a wind-skimming boat that shot across the water like an arrow. In ten days, he reached Donglai. When he inquired about the dynasty, he learned it was now Tang. From the Daye era to Zhenyuan, two hundred years had passed.

Wang Yin
The *jinshi* Wang Jie was a scholar of the *Yujing* and *Lashi*, diligent and unyielding. He plumbed depths untouched by ancients, grasped truths unattained by former Confucians, and composed the *Zhiguzi* in thirty scrolls. No error in the Six Classics or flaw in the historical records escaped his needle piercing their fat and his medicine curing their marrow. In his two kinds of essays and exegetical explanations, even the most penetrating insights of ancient sages fell short.

He delighted in wine and lived for his own pleasure, unbound by convention. Beyond the joy of intoxication, he invariably probed the treasuries of meaning, refining the pivots of rhetoric—much like Liu Lan, who reviled the ancients. Yet his habit of inhaling wind and dew, chewing mist and clouds, led to chronic illness, years of suffering from a cold malady that no remedy could cure.

While traveling in Yan, he met on the road a man leaning on a cherry staff and wearing a palm-bark hat. With the bearing of a crane and an air of lofty antiquity, he stood apart from his peers. His name was Xidao. Smiling, he said: "Young man, are you burdened by the three delusions? Why else would you be so emaciated?" Jie explained his condition, and Xidao replied: "I possess the art of the crucible and furnace—what illness could withstand it?"

Jie submitted himself as a disciple. After purifying himself for three days by the Zhang River, he received the secret formula: "The essence of wood is the celestial soul; the liquid of metal, the terrestrial spirit. Kan and Li circulate—neither laxity nor force achieves success. Metal and wood have their measures; Qin and Jin must harmonize." The near effect would come in sixty days, the distant in three years. He taught this song:

*"When the spirit enters the soul and the female and male unite,
Yang refines, yin nourishes, gods and ghosts perish.
A thousand hymns, ten thousand praises—none compare;
From ancient times to now, they cast aside sun and moon."*

Jie followed the instructions, ingested the elixir, and within a year his illness vanished. Thereafter, he lived in seclusion, feigning madness to blend with the times. At eighty, he died on the road to Pengshan, and those who recognized him mourned him. Soon after, he reappeared in Chengdu, often lodging in Lewen County. At the time, a beast with a knotted tail was wreaking havoc. Jie, drunk, slept in the wild grass, his body exposed in the forest, fearing nothing—such was his transformation, like the cicada shedding its husk.

Li Jian
Li Quan, styled Daguanzi, dwelled on Shaoshi Mountain and was devoted to the Dao of immortals.

Li Quan frequently traversed famous mountains, broadly gathering esoteric arts. At Tiger’s Maw Crag on Mount Song, he obtained the *Yellow Emperor’s Original Scripture of the Yin Talisman*—a plain silk scroll sealed in a lacquered jade casket, inscribed: *"Seventh day of the seventh month, second year of Tai Ping Zhen Jun of the Great Wei. Hidden among the famous mountains by the Highest Clarity Daoist Kou Qianzhi, to be transmitted to those of like aspiration."* The text was moth-eaten and decayed; Quan copied and read it thousands of times, yet still failed to grasp its principles.

Thereupon he entered Qin, and at the foot of Mount Li encountered an old woman—her topknot coiled atop her head, the rest of her hair hanging loose, clad in tattered robes, leaning on a staff, her appearance most singular. By the roadside, she saw embers left burning a tree and remarked to herself: *"Fire is born of wood; calamity inevitably consumes its source."* Quan, startled, asked her: *"This is the* Yellow Emperor’s Yin Talisman—*how does an old woman know of it?"* The woman replied: *"I have received this scripture for three kalpas and six cycles of sixty years. How did a youth like you come by it?"* Quan bowed deeply, prostrating himself, and recounted how he had obtained it. The woman said: *"Your facial bones align with the Gate of Life, your Mandate Gate levels with the Sun’s Angle; your blood and marrow are not yet exhausted, your heart’s reflection remains unbiased. You are virtuous and fond of the Dao, spirited and delighted by wisdom—truly my disciple. Yet at forty-five, you shall face a great sigh."*

She then produced a cinnabar talisman, threading it onto the tip of her staff, and bade Quan kneel to receive it. The woman thereupon sat upon a rock and expounded the meaning of the *Yin Talisman* to him: *"The* Yin Talisman *comprises three hundred words: one hundred expound the Dao, one hundred expound the Law, one hundred expound the Arts. Above lies the Dao of immortals embracing the One; in the middle, the methods for enriching the state and pacifying the people; below, the techniques for strengthening armies and securing victory. All arise from the inner workings of the heart’s mechanism, outwardly harmonizing with human affairs."*

Gazing into its subtleties, the *Eight Scenes of the Yellow Court* are not profound enough to be called mysterious; examining its essentials, the classics, commentaries, philosophers, and histories are not refined enough to be called literature. Applying its ingenuity, even Sun Wu, Wu Qi, Han Xin, and Bai Qi would not be extraordinary enough to be called marvelous. Those without the Dao must not be allowed to hear of it.

Thus, the perfected person who employs it attains the Dao; the worthy person who employs it attains the Law; the upright person who employs it attains the Arts—each according to their capacity. If transmitting it to a like-minded companion, one must first purify oneself with fasting before imparting it. Those with the root become teachers; those without, disciples. One must not value the rich and noble nor slight the poor and humble. Those who violate this shall have twenty years deducted from their lifespan.

Recite it seven times on one’s natal day to sharpen the heart’s mechanism and extend one’s years. On the seventh day of the seventh month each year, copy one text and conceal it within a famous mountain’s stone cavern to gain additional years. After some time, the woman said, "The sun has already set. I have barley porridge—let us eat together." From her sleeve she produced a gourd ladle and bade Quan fetch water from the valley. Once filled, the ladle suddenly grew heavy by over a hundred *jin*, and Quan could not control it, causing it to sink into the spring. Upon returning, the woman had vanished, leaving only several *sheng* of barley porridge. Quan ate it and thereafter abstained from grain.

During Emperor Xuanzong of Tang’s *Kaiyuan* era, he served as Vice Military Commissioner of Jiangling and Imperial Censor. Quan possessed military strategy and composed the *Tai Bai Yin Jing* in ten scrolls, as well as the *Zhong Tai Zhi* in ten scrolls. At the time, he was sidelined by Li Linfu and never rose to prominence. He eventually entered the famous mountains in search of the Dao, and his later whereabouts remain unknown.

Wang Kejiao was a native of Kunshan in Suzhou. Originally a farmer, he had no prior knowledge of the Dao. At several years of age, his eyes began to emit a five-colored radiance, which intensified at night, allowing him to discern objects even in pitch darkness. Someone told his kin, "This is an ailment—once the light fades, he will lose his sight." His ignorant parents summoned a quack physician to cauterize his eyes, and the light vanished.

In the eleventh month of the tenth year of Emperor Yizong of Tang’s *Xiantong* era, Kejiao was returning home from the market when he saw a grand barge by the riverbank, its hull adorned with gold and brocade, embellished with pearls and kingfisher feathers, sailing to the accompaniment of music. Kejiao stood watching as the barge docked by the shore. A youth in azure robes beckoned him aboard, where he saw over ten men in towering caps and feathered robes, their garments patterned with clouds, mist, mountains, and rivers. Each held a musical instrument. One sang, "The Third Uncle wishes to meet you," though none knew whence he hailed. Another remarked, "He has the bones of an immortal, but they were damaged by fire. He must not drink wine yet—only after abstaining from grain for ten years may he attain the Dao." They gave him a chestnut, instructing him to eat it. Kejiao consumed half, keeping the other half in his hand, as the company played music and drank. The youth then led him back to shore, and all seemed like a dream. No sooner had his feet touched the ground than he found himself beneath the waterfall cliffs of Mount Tiantai. In an instant, he had traversed a thousand *li* by land and water.

The prefect of Taizhou, Yuan Cong, suspected deception and sent an official dispatch to verify his origins. From the day Kejiao vanished to his arrival at Mount Tiantai, thirty days had passed. Thereafter, Kejiao abstained from food, his complexion glowing with vitality. Yuan granted him a feathered robe and allowed him to reside in the Purple Ultimate Temple. Wang Feng, the Surveillance Commissioner of Yuezhou, memorialized: "He seemed to have wandered to the celestial realm, hearing but a single strain of the *Xiao Shao* melody. Awakening as from a dream, he was asked the date—thirty days had passed. Though he spoke of a decade-long trial, one fears he may yet take flight one day."

The imperial edict read: "The annals of immortals abound with such marvels, their divine wonders worthy of record. Having ascended from mortal flesh, he now dwells in a famed mountain—an age-old tale, no different from ancient times. How distant, then, are Penglai and Yingzhou? Let the local authorities ensure he finds refuge like Master Anqi." Thus left to roam freely, he remained in the Jiangbiao region for several years.

---

Chen Jian was a minor clerk of Jinhua County in Wuzhou. Arriving early at the county office before the gates opened, he lingered in hesitation. Suddenly, he encountered a Daoist traveler hurrying on his way.

Chen Jian unconsciously followed him. After three or five *li*, they suddenly arrived at a Daoist abbey, its halls and pavilions towering in solemn grandeur, flanked by a great mountain. The Daoist traveler led him into a chamber, where a desk, brushes, ink, and other writing implements were laid out. He handed Chen a scroll of yellow silk and over ten sheets of paper, saying, "As you have an affinity for calligraphy, transcribe this for me." Unfurling the scroll, Chen saw it was all in ancient seal script. Though he had never studied such characters nor devoted himself to learning, his heart sank at the difficulty. The Daoist had already departed, leaving no room for refusal. Tentatively, he followed the text and copied it—surprisingly, with ease. By midday, he had finished.

The Daoist gave him a cup of broth, saying, "This is the divine nectar of Jinhua, not to be lightly obtained. Whoever drinks it shall enjoy boundless longevity, and its taste is sweet and exquisite." Then, with words of encouragement and gratitude, he sent Chen off, adding, "When worldly troubles arise, return here—this is the Golden Flower Grotto-Heaven." Stepping outside, Chen felt as if waking from a dream—three days had already passed.

Upon returning home, he practiced seal script, his strokes bold and vigorous beyond compare, yet he no longer partook of food or drink.

The Prefect Xian Zifang, upon receiving the record, found the matter extraordinary and deemed it a propitious sign from the immortals. He issued a county verdict stating: *"Having obtained the secret record, this auspicious omen has appeared. It clearly marks the threshold of enlightenment and truly accords with the portent of attaining the true Dao."* Soon after, Chen returned to Golden Flower Mountain and was never heard from again.

**Lu Jun**
The Chancellor Lu Jun, having passed the imperial examinations and served as a Gentleman of the Ministry, sought leave due to illness and was appointed Prefect of Junzhou. Upon arriving in his jurisdiction, his condition worsened—he grew emaciated and could no longer bear the sight of others. He often secluded himself in a mountain studio behind the prefectural residence to cultivate his nature, sending even his attendants far away; none dared approach unless summoned.

One day, a man in tattered clothing scaled the wall and entered. Lu invited him in, and the man said his surname was Wang. Asked where he came from, he replied, *"From the mountains."* Lu smiled and said, *"Then you must be Master Wang of the mountains."* Lu asked, *"What guidance do you bring this time?"* The man replied, *"Your Excellency holds the highest rank among men, yet your years are not long. Disaster now befalls you, manifesting as this lingering illness—thus I have come to save you."*

Noting there was no water in the studio, Lu intended to call for servants to fetch tea or the like, but Wang stopped him. Dipping his sash into the well, he dissolved a grain of cinnabar, wrung the water from the sash, and gave it to Lu. Then he made an appointment: *"In five days, your illness will be cured, and your health will surpass your former state. Three years hence, you will face a great calamity. I urge you to accumulate hidden merit—be mindful of saving lives and showing compassion to all beings. At that time, I will meet you again at the beginning of summer."*

From then on, Lu’s illness improved, and within ten days, he fully recovered. The following year, he resigned his post and returned to the capital, where he was appointed Salt and Iron Revenue Officer. In the fourth month of summer, as he passed by the eastern gate of the Wuben Bureau, he suddenly saw the mountain man arrive at his residence. The man said, *"This year marks the end of your second life limit, and the disaster would have been severe. However, last year in your prefecture, you exonerated the wrongly accused and saved three lives—thus the calamity has been averted. Within this month, on the third or fifth day, you will suffer a minor ailment, but it will pass without harm."*

The next day, the mountain man instructed two servants to take ten thousand coins to Gouji Slope and distribute them among the poor and sick before departing. He added, *"On the fifth day of the fifth month, twenty-three years from now, at noon, have a Daoist await me atop Wanshan Peak. By then, you will govern Hanzhong, and I will bestow upon you the Elixir of Golden Flower—do not miss the appointed time."*

Thereafter, Lu advanced through illustrious offices, growing ever more prosperous. The following year, he was posted to Hanzhong—twenty-three years had indeed passed. At the appointed time, he sent the Daoist Niu Zhiwei to ascend Wanshan Peak at noon on the fifth day of the fifth month. The mountain man was there and gave Niu two grains of golden elixir to swallow, saying, *"You possess the qi of the Dao but lack hidden merit, so you have not yet attained the rank of immortality. You must cultivate diligently."* He then presented Lu with ten grains of the elixir, saying, *"You will enjoy a long life. Do not cease your practice. When your worldly allotment is complete, I await your return to the Peng Palace."*

After parting with Niu with a bow, the mountain man vanished. Later, Niu lived to over eighty, yet his appearance remained as that of a man in his thirties. Lu, at ninety, retained sharp senses and unflagging vigor. After his passing, his chamber was filled with an extraordinary fragrance.

**Wang Zizhi**
Wang Zizhi, styled Xianmiao, claimed to be from Weishan in Henan. He often traveled between the capital and Luoyang, and elders said they had seen him for fifty years—his appearance always that of a man in his forties, his age unknown. He was devoted to cultivating qi and fond of wine.

When the Prince of Langye, Pu Chongying, first took up his post as military governor of Puzhou, Zizhi resided at the Purple Ultimate Palace. The prince treated him with great courtesy and, hearing of his love for wine, sent him two large jars daily. One day, Zizhi went out and encountered a woodcutter at the palace gate carrying firewood. The man’s appearance was extraordinary, and Zizhi found him remarkable. He bought the wood, paying generously, and the woodcutter accepted the money without protest before leaving.

Zizhi had someone follow him to observe. The woodcutter went straight to a tavern, drank all the wine, and returned home. The next day, he reappeared and said to Zizhi, *"This wine is fine, but it cannot compare to the brew of the Shi family in Jie County. I just came from there and regret not having a companion to share it fully."* Zizhi descended the steps, took his hand, and sat with him by the brazier, entreating, *"Could you obtain some of the Shi family’s wine?"*

The woodcutter agreed and wrote a talisman in cinnabar, placing it over the fire. Before the smoke faded, a young servant appeared. The woodcutter commanded, *"Take this gentleman’s servant with these two jars and go directly to the Shi family to fetch wine. I will await you here to share a drink with the master."* Though it was already night and the gates were barred, the young servant told Zizhi’s servant, *"Close your eyes."* He then lifted the servant’s head, and both man and jars slipped through the gate’s crack. They reached Jie County, bought the wine, and returned.

Zizhi shared the wine with the woodcutter—its sweetness, richness, and purity were unmatched in the world. At midnight, the woodcutter said, *"You are drunk. Shall I summon a guest to sit beside you?"* Zizhi agreed. The woodcutter wrote another vermilion talisman and burned it. In an instant, a rare fragrance filled the room, and a man of imposing bearing, with fine beard and brows, clad in purple robes and holding a tablet, entered and bowed before sitting down. They drank together for a long while. Then the woodcutter heated an iron poker and warmed the purple-robed man’s garments, saying, *"You may go."* By then, dawn was breaking, and they rose to part.

The woodcutter asked Zizhi, *"Do you recognize the man who just left?"* After a moment, he added, *"Go to the riverbank temple to see him."* Zizhi escorted the woodcutter away, then visited the temple, where he saw the man from the previous night—it was the deity. The mark from the iron poker remained clearly visible.

Later, Zizhi encountered the woodcutter-immortal again, who imparted to him the secrets of cultivation and refinement, whereupon he became an earthbound immortal.

Wang Kuo
Wang Kuo, a commoner of the Tang dynasty during Emperor Yizong’s Xiantong era, was sailing from Kezhu when a fierce wind forced his boat to anchor beneath Jun Mountain. With several companions, he followed a mountain path along the shore and ascended the slopes. Suddenly, he caught the scent of wine, but when he asked his companions, none detected it. The fragrance grew stronger, and upon the cliffside beside the path, he noticed a cave. Suspecting something unusual, he entered. After walking about ten paces, he found a depression in a flat stone holding wine. He scooped some and drank; its flavor was rich and exquisite. After consuming half a *dou* or more, he became pleasantly intoxicated. Resting beside the depression, he gradually sobered and returned to the boat, where he recounted the experience to his companions. They rushed to search but found nothing. From then on, Wang Kuo felt invigorated and free of illness, gradually losing his taste for grains. He entered the famous mountains to study the Dao.

Later, he read in an immortal’s book: *"On Jun Mountain there is celestial wine; drinking it, one ascends as an immortal."* What Wang Kuo had encountered was this very wine.

*History of Perfected Immortals Embracing the Dao Through the Ages, Scroll Twenty-Two (concluded)*
*History of Perfected Immortals Embracing the Dao Through the Ages, Scroll Twenty-Three*

The Perfected Immortal Lord Ge

The Perfected Immortal Lord was surnamed Ge, named Xuan, and styled Xiaoxian. His family originally hailed from Langye. Their ancestral line of officials and scholars traced back to their great-great-grandfather Lu, who served as the Han dynasty’s General of Agile Cavalry and was enfeoffed as the Marquis of Xiana. Later, he relinquished his state and, together with his younger brother Wentuo, journeyed south to the lands east of the Yangtze, wandering freely among the hills and valleys. Arriving in Jurong of Danyang, they found its mountains and waters elegant and its customs simple and honest, which perfectly suited their refined sensibilities. By chance, their second cousin Sun had come to serve as Administrator, and one day, while attending upon him, they remarked: “Our ancestor was Taibo, yet this unworthy descendant may be considered a successor to Zhongyong.” Thus, they settled there together.

The Perfected Immortal’s grandfather, Ju, served the Han as Gentleman of the Yellow Gate. His father, Xiaoru, successively held the offices of Grand Herald and rose to become a Minister of the Imperial Secretariat. Their lineage descended from the Ge Tian clan, who had been enfeoffed at Ge and thus adopted the state as their surname. The family had long borne the virtue of loyalty, serving as feudal lords through the ages.

The Perfected Immortal was originally a Perfected One of the Great Canopy Heaven, who descended to the world in the seventh year of the *Yanxi* era of Emperor Huan of the Later Han, on the eighth day of the fourth month of the *jiachen* year. His father had long practiced the Daoist arts and, upon his birth, dispatched messengers bearing incense, flowers, and coins to the local Xuanjing Abbey to procure fragrant water for the child’s bath. At that time, there appeared a transcendent Daoist named Zhi Daoji, whose origins were unknown. Hearing that the Minister had been blessed with a son, he joyfully addressed the messenger: “Last night, I dreamed that the Master of Penetrating the Mysteries descended from the Great Canopy Heaven and said to me: ‘It has been kalpas since we last parted—have you forgotten me?’ I bowed and replied: ‘This disciple wishes to attain the eye of the supreme, orthodox, and true Dao.’ He instructed: ‘Return and inform the Minister that I shall come tomorrow to congratulate him on the birth of this extraordinary boy.’”

The messenger returned and reported this in full. The following day, Daoji indeed arrived to offer his congratulations. The Minister said: “This child is my firstborn, and I had hoped to secure him as heir to our lineage, fulfilling my aspirations.” Daoji requested to see the infant, but the mother hesitated. The father ordered the child brought out, and upon seeing him, Daoji unconsciously rose in reverence. The Minister, astonished, inquired further, to which Daoji replied: “I had foreseen this auspicious sign and now dare to offer my congratulations. This child is enveloped in purple qi, like a precious canopy, with divine radiance flowing and shimmering—he is destined to become a divine immortal, unlike ordinary mortals.” The Minister said: “The sages and immortals are distant and elusive, their transformations obscure and unfathomable. I would be content if he could live a long life as heir to our lineage.” Daoji replied: “His wisdom and intelligence, though briefly passing through this world, will bring celebration in the Nine Heavens and joy to his seven generations of ancestors. The living will be blessed, and the dead will ascend to heaven.”

Thereupon, Daoji recalled the Perfected One’s merits from past lives and performed obeisance to the immortals and sages of the ten directions, praying for eternal and supreme fortune. After the rites, he composed a eulogy for the Perfected Immortal, which read:

Though the body cycles through sacred transformations,
The soul and spirit never perish for a moment.
Virtues accumulated through kalpas of past merit,
Vows of old are fulfilled not in this day alone.
A Perfected One of the Great Canopy descends,
Immortals and sages emerge bearing true essence.
Heavenly dragons sprinkle fragrant blossoms,
Fearing lest I refine this mortal frame.
Who would believe such subtle words?
Yet the divine appointment is fulfilled by mysterious blessing.
The mind of the Dao transcends duality,
Its primordial unity manifest in perfect completion.
Alone, he awakens to the original thought,
Radiant and free in the Great Vehicle’s ease.

After reciting the eulogy, Daoji bowed deeply and departed, vanishing in an instant.

At the age of eight, the Perfected Immortal lost his parents but was already able to devote himself to learning and stand on his own. From birth, he was exceptionally bright, his heroic bearing vibrant, his natural talent surpassing others, and his nature and intellect keen and flourishing. By thirteen, he had mastered the classics of past and present, and there was no work among the Confucian canons, histories, philosophers, or masters that he had not thoroughly perused. Whenever he encountered his father’s handwritten manuscripts, he would gaze heavenward, weep aloud, and birds would circle above, their cries mournful. Sighing, he would say: “The mountains and rivers do not change their hues, yet my stern father has returned to emptiness. If there exists a Way to long life and immortality, why should I not cultivate it?” Thus, he wandered near sacred peaks and distant mountains, seeking extraordinary masters.

He was fond of playing the zither, reciting the works of Zhuangzi and Laozi, and lived in tranquil detachment, inwardly content and without desires. By fifteen or sixteen, his name resounded throughout the lands east of the Yangtze. Eminent men sought to recruit him for office, but the Perfected Immortal said: “To eat simple fare, wear coarse cloth, rest my head on stone, and rinse my mouth with flowing water—this is my joy. How could I exchange it for that?” Thereupon, he donned Daoist robes and entered the Tiantai, Chicheng, and Shangyu mountains, where he concentrated his thoughts on the Dao. As his aspirations bore fruit, he encountered the Perfected One Zuo Yuanfang, who transmitted to him the *Scripture of Nine Elixirs and Golden Liquor*, methods for refining cinnabar to preserve the body, secret techniques for healing illnesses and subduing spirits, and the *Wondrous Scripture of the Three Primes and True Unity*. Practicing these for three years, he amassed vast merit and efficacy.

On the first day of the first month of the second year of the *Guanghe* era of Emperor Ling, the Most High Lord Lao, together with the Perfected One of the Great Ultimate, Xu Laile, and others, descended upon Mount Tiantai. Lord Lao rode in an eightfold-jewel jade chariot, accompanied by a retinue of ten thousand attendants, with the Perfected One of the Orthodox Unity in attendance. Lord Lao styled himself the Perfected One of the Supreme Mystery and Unity, and the Perfected One of True Stability and Radiance as the High Master of the Mysterious Canon. He commanded the Immortal Attendant of the Scriptures, Wang Sizhen, to unfurl the ninefold-luminous jade cords and present the *Cavernous Mystery Great Cavern Numinous Treasure Scripture* in thirty-six sections, which he bestowed upon the immortal Ge Xuan, along with the two grades of Upper Clarity purification rites and the seven ranks of the Three Registers purification methods.

The Three Registers were: the Golden Register purification, for safeguarding the nation’s destiny; the Jade Register purification, for protecting empresses, consorts, dukes, and noble clans; and the Yellow Register purification, for delivering the nine generations of ancestors and seven generations of forebears, freeing them from the eternal night of suffering.

The seven ranks were: the Illumination of the Perfected purification, for transcending the departed and resolving all karmic entanglements; the Spontaneous purification, for universally seeking blessings and atoning for transgressions on behalf of all beings, and for the methods of cultivating immortality; the Three Primes purification, for repenting transgressions of precepts and absolving oneself before the Three Officials; the Eight Nodes purification, for repenting the sins of one’s primal ancestors and oneself, and for the method of erasing the Black Register; the Cavernous Spirit purification, which valued purity and simplicity, for the methods of seeking immortality and protecting the nation; and the Upholding the Teachings purification, which prized clarity and frugality, for the methods of healing illnesses and averting disasters.

The Mortification purification, which valued suffering and austerity as merit, for the methods of repenting transgressions and seeking blessings.

He also expounded the *Dharma Wheel Sutra* in forty-five fascicles, along with the *Sutra of Infinite Penetration*, the *Sutra of the Mysterious Turning of the Spirit*, and the *Sutra of Entering Samādhi*, bestowing them upon the Perfected Lord to propagate in the world. He declared: "You should constantly contemplate the Highest Great Daoist King of the Vastly Empty Primordial Perfected One, whose title in the great thousandfold world is Laozi, the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Realm."

He further revealed the celestial registers of human transgressions and blessings, titled *The Ledger of Karmic Responses*. And he said: "When merit fills three thousand, one ascends to the heavens in broad daylight. With surplus goodness, one descends seated upon a cloud chariot. Unceasingly propagating the Dao, one naturally attains immortality."

The Perfected Lord bowed in reverence and gratitude. Today, on Mount Tiantai at Tongbo Abbey, there stands the Dharma Wheel Cloister, where the Three Perfected Ones descended with the scriptures. The altar where the Perfected Lord commanded spirits to construct the platform for receiving celestial decrees still remains.

At eighteen or nineteen, the Perfected Lord’s immortal arts gradually matured. He roamed mountains and seas, appearing and vanishing in an instant, then journeyed to Kuocang, where he visited his uncle. His uncle, named Mi, styled Xiaogong, was then lecturing on the classics, surrounded by scholars from all directions, their shoulders and sleeves brushing together. A lecture hall stood beside his residence. The Perfected Lord returned to pay his respects, and Mi inquired about his wanderings, saying: "I have often thought of you, dwelling in seclusion, distant from worldly affairs, gazing up at the azure clouds and down upon the vast sea, enduring hardships and dangers—what others dread, you have accomplished. Now the realm enjoys cultural brilliance, and the Three States seek talent. With your vast and extraordinary learning, you are surely destined for greatness."

The Perfected Lord replied: "I am dull by nature, unfit for worldly affairs, and have failed my ancestors’ legacy. I decline the company of those who seek office and renounce the path of those who bear the tripod’s weight. I have long resolved to dwell in mountain caves, my heart nestled in mist and clouds, wandering rivers and peaks for my delight. I hope to befriend Master Juan and take Red Pine as my companion. My uncle, you widely propagate the Dao and the arts, expounding the Five Classics, reviving the legacy of the Lu and Si rivers, and restoring the flourishing of poetry and refinement. With the Three States at peace, the teachings of non-action must prevail. My aspirations are vast and distant; I forsake worldly glory. May you, my uncle, achieve renown and dedicate yourself to the realm, bringing prosperity to future generations."

Mi answered: "You transcend the common and enter the sacred—something I cannot match. You should diligently study the canons of preserving life and heed the admonitions of prudence. Then, ascending to the tripod lake will be no difficulty."

The Perfected Lord took his leave and once more traversed the mountains of Kuocang, Nanyue, and Luofu, seeking a site for refining the golden elixir. Wending his way through Yunsun, he arrived at Hezao, then ascended the lofty peaks of Shoulou to survey the land. He declared: "The form is harmonious, the colors deep; the soil is fertile, the waters clear—this is truly a dwelling for immortals, the very ground for my golden elixir. Yet after the elixir is complete, I must broadly accumulate hidden merit, delivering all beings, so that my name may be inscribed in the registers of the Three Heavens and my rank established among the Nine Empyreans, leaving no cause for remorse."

Then, lamenting the fall of the Han, the wars of the Three States, the ravages of drought and flood, famine, and the countless dead from warfare and captivity—lost souls and stagnant spirits, sunk in evil destinies, unable to escape the wheel of rebirth—he compiled the *Lingbao Scriptures and Decrees*, composing the *Great Rites of Sacrificial Refinement*, the *Precious Register for Ascending to Heaven*, and the *Secret Talismans of the Numinous Treasure*, presenting them to the Heavenly Emperor. He established a Dharma altar and, on the auspicious days of the Three Primes and Eight Nodes, summoned the destitute souls and stagnant spirits from the ten directions’ great hells to gather before the altar, where they all received sacrificial refinement, talismanic registers, and liberation to be reborn.

After practicing these rites, responses were frequently witnessed. On the evening of the Lower Prime Festival in the year of Jiawu, during the sacrificial refinement, a ghost king, five *zhang* in height and clad in a brown robe, bowed twice, stepped forward, and said: "I am a lowly ghost, governing destitute spirits. For countless kalpas, I have sunk in evil destinies with no hope of escape. Yet through the true immortals’ universal Dharma assemblies, sacrificial deliverance of lost souls, bestowal of talismanic registers, and salvation of the netherworld, hundreds of thousands have attained rebirth. We all share in this blessing and hear the Dharma’s sound. Overwhelmed with gratitude, I have come to pay homage. Moreover, I have heard the Dark Heaven North Emperor proclaim to the hells’ ghosts and spirits: ‘The Perfected Lord Ge has long practiced sacrificial refinement, his merit recorded in jade tablets, his name inscribed on golden slips. In five years, the Three Heavens will descend a decree, bestowing a commission to ascend and join the celestial bureaus.’" With that, he took his leave.

Thereupon, the Perfected Lord entrusted the *Scriptures of Sacrificial Refinement*, the Dharma methods, precious threads, talismanic texts, and secret instructions to the Zong Altar of Hezao and the Chongxu Altar, transmitting them to later disciples to broadly deliver the lost.

The Perfected Lord further reflected that beings, having attained human form and birth in a land of bliss, indulge their desires and neglect the true Dao. As transgressions accumulate, karmic retribution becomes inescapable. Only the *Three Vehicles’ Secret Scriptures of Lingbao* can enlighten beings, repent their sins, deliver the suffering, and awaken them to the true and real. Thus, he synthesized the essentials of the *Shangqing* and *Lingbao* scriptural corpora, compiling the *Nine Dark Hells Great Repentance Rites of the Merciful Dharma Altar* in ten fascicles, which spread throughout the world among devout men and women. Those afflicted by disasters in their homes or mourning deceased kin may establish grand Dharma altars, array the true images, and recite the *Nine Dark Hells Great Repentance*. Thereby, the living may receive blessings, the departed may attain rebirth, and both old and new karmic debts may be extinguished. The cold courts of hell will adjourn their trials, and suffering spirits will receive grace. This repentance rite has spread across the four seas, bestowing boundless beneficence.

The Perfected Lord, having received the *Shangqing* and *Lingbao* scriptural corpora, studied and recited them with utmost devotion. Within the *Dongshen* and *Taiqing* corpora, he expanded the *Dao and Its Virtue*, composing commentaries and prefaces, which he placed at the beginning of the texts.

Still, in his commentary on the present scripture, he declared: "I attained the true Dao and once recited this scripture ten thousand times. I received it from the Lord of Eastern Splendor, who received it from the Lord of the Golden Portals, who received it from the Queen Mother of the West—each transmitting it orally, without committing it to writing. Now, in this world, I have inscribed and recorded it. Thus, the transmission of this scripture truly begins with me.

In former times, when the Perfected Lord encountered his true master, he was taught the arts of multiplying his form ten thousandfold and the methods of numinous responsiveness and transformation. He could sit upon kindling and set it aflame without his robes or cap being singed, or drink deeply and lie upon a spring without his body becoming wet. While traveling, if he encountered kin or friends, he would invite them to stay, plucking grass or piercing a tree to draw forth sap, which he collected in a cup—flowing like a spring until the cup was full. When he urged his guests to drink, it was always fine wine. Taking shards of tile, pebbles, or the fruits of plants and trees, he would offer them to his guests, saying, 'These are delicacies,' and upon eating, they became dried meats and jujubes.

Once, while boating with a guest, the guest noticed a box containing a dozen or so talismans and asked, 'Might I witness the efficacy of these talismans?' The Perfected Lord immediately took one and cast it into the water, where it drifted downstream. He asked, 'What do you think?' The guest replied, 'Even an ordinary person could do the same.' The Perfected Lord took another talisman and cast it into the water, where it traveled upstream. He asked, 'What do you think?' The guest said, 'That is extraordinary.' The Perfected Lord cast yet another talisman into the water, where it neither sank nor floated but remained suspended. After a moment, the upstream talisman descended, the downstream talisman ascended, and they met in the current, the three talismans gathering together before he retrieved them.

On another occasion, by the water’s edge, he saw a man fishing for large fish and said to the fisherman, 'I wish to borrow this fish to take to the River Earl.' The fisherman replied, 'This one is already dead.' The Perfected Lord said, 'Even so, place this cinnabar-inscribed paper in its mouth and cast it into the water, and it will leap away.' Later, a guest arrived for an audience. As they sat, another visitor arrived, and the Perfected Lord rose to greet and escort him in, yet the Perfected Lord on the seat continued conversing and laughing with the guest, unmoved.

During a bitter cold spell, he said to his guests, 'Living in poverty, I cannot afford a brazier to warm you. Let me conjure a fire to await you all.' Thereupon, he exhaled, and flames burst forth, filling the room in an instant. On another sweltering day, as he lay resting, he had someone apply powder to his abdomen and said to his guests, 'It is too hot for other amusements.' He then slowly rubbed his abdomen upward, and the powder adhered to the roof beam.

Once, while dining with guests, he spoke of divine transformations. A guest said, 'After we finish eating, you must perform a marvel.' Before the meal was done, the Perfected Lord asked, 'Do you wish to see it sooner?' He then spat out the rice from his mouth, which transformed into flying bees filling the room. Some alighted on the guests, who were all astonished, though the bees did not sting. After a while, he opened his mouth, and the bees flew back in, returning to rice, which they ate again.

He pointed to a forest, commanding it to walk; to toads and other creatures, commanding them to fly; and to swallows, sparrows, and turtles, commanding them to dance—all moving in rhythm like humans. In winter, he served his guests fresh melons and jujubes, and in summer, he provided ice and snow. He once had someone scatter dozens of coins into a well, then held a vessel over the well and called for the coins to emerge. One by one, the coins flew out of the well, each returning to where it had been cast.

When he served wine to guests, no one passed the cups, for they came of their own accord. If a guest did not finish drinking, the cup would not depart. Once, while traveling, the Perfected Lord passed a spirit shrine where all who passed were required to dismount a hundred paces away, or else misfortune would befall them. Beside the shrine stood dozens of large trees, upon which perched several birds that none dared disturb. The Perfected Lord drove his carriage straight toward it. Suddenly, a great wind arose, and dust obscured the sky. His attendants were terrified, but the Perfected Lord grew angry and said, 'How dare a petty demon act thus!' He raised his hand and pointed at the wind, which immediately ceased. He then had someone cast a talisman into the shrine, and the birds all fell dead while the shrine itself burst into flames.

Passing through Wukang, he saw a household where illness had taken hold, and a shaman was summoned to sacrifice to the malevolent spirits. The spirit possessing the shaman demanded that the Perfected Lord drink. He refused, and the pernicious spirit spoke insolently. The Perfected Lord rebuked it sternly, saying, 'How dare you, wicked ghost!' He commanded the Earth Lord to drag the possessed man’s head and lash his back against a pillar. The sound of whipping was heard, and blood flowed to the ground. The possessed man, terrified, begged for mercy, saying, 'I have offended the Perfected One. I beg for forgiveness.' The Perfected Lord asked, 'What kind of malevolent spirit are you? Confess at once.' It replied, 'I am a ghost from the rear mountain.' The Perfected Lord said, 'I pardon your offense, but the sick one must recover within three days, or I will punish you severely without mercy.'

Once, while passing through Huayin, he saw a scholar entrapped in the household of a serpent spirit. The Perfected Lord transformed into a peasant driving a yellow calf to plow. He said to the scholar, 'You have fallen into a perilous place. This woman is a serpent spirit who has devoured countless people.' He led the scholar to an ancient well filled with white bones. Then he instructed the scholar to secretly observe, saying, 'Flee eastward, and I will protect you.' The scholar did as told and saw the serpent spirit—fangs bared, eyes glaring—lying in a netted canopy with a small serpent brother beside her. The Perfected Lord slew and beheaded her. Innumerable small serpents came to her aid, but he slaughtered them all. He gave the scholar a talisman to ingest, and the scholar vomited up earthworms, toads, and the like, thus preserving his life.

In former times, the Perfected Lord received from the Most High Lord Lao the *Thunder Rites of the Lightning Fire Palace*, enabling him to command thunder deities and punish the unrighteous. In the second year of the Chiwu reign, on the first day of the first month, the Perfected Lord ascended Laoshan Mountain to meditate upon the Dao. At noon, the Most High bestowed upon him the *Thousand Perfected Precepts and Admonitions*, which he expounded to the assembled immortals, exhorting and admonishing those yet unenlightened. These teachings have since spread throughout the world."

The Perfected Lord once resided on Purple Canopy Mountain in Jingmen Commandery to cultivate and refine his practice. There, he encountered a bitter cold that froze his feet, and his garments were tattered and threadbare. Two daughters of the Qu family, observing from afar, pitied his endurance of the cold. Under the cover of night, they hastily crafted a pair of shoes and, the following day, sought to present them to him. Arriving at his alchemical furnace, they found the Perfected Lord already departed, though the ashes in the hearth remained warm. The sisters raked through the ashes and discovered a single elixir pellet, which they divided and ingested. Thereafter, their *qi* surged with vitality; they neither hungered nor thirsted, and yearned only for purity and stillness. Later, they vanished into seclusion, and people of the time declared them to have attained immortality, as recorded in Sima Ziwei’s *Record of the Ma Immortal’s Abode*.

The Perfected Lord and the Celestial Master shared a bond like that of outer and inner garments, their traces and wanderings often found in the lands of Shu. Across the ages, their deeds have grown distant, and few among the people could fully comprehend them—thus, they cannot be exhaustively recounted.

The Perfected Lord once cultivated on Xiaoyou Grotto-Heaven of Mount Magu in Xujiang, where he carved five wells corresponding to the Five Phases, aligning them with the Five Stars above. To this day, the ebb and flow of their waters follow a cyclical pattern from one to five, endlessly repeating, as if governed by a fixed measure. These wells lie before the foothills of Mount Magu.

At that time, the Lord of Wu received the Perfected Lord with the courtesy due a guest. One day, as they sat upon a high tower, they observed from afar a petitioner offering prayers to the earth deity for rain. The Lord of Wu asked, “The people long for rain—can it be granted?” The Perfected Lord replied, “It can.” He inscribed a talisman and ordered it burned at the altar. In an instant, the heavens darkened, wind and thunder arose in tumult, and a timely rain fell, reviving the withered crops.

Once, the Perfected Lord accompanied the Lord of Wu on a voyage to the confluence of the Three Rivers. A storm arose, and many boats were lost to the waves; the Perfected Lord’s vessel, too, vanished without trace. The Lord of Wu sighed, “The Perfected Lord of Ge is a man of the Dao—how could he not escape this?” He dispatched messengers in search, and by nightfall, they suddenly beheld the Perfected Lord striding across the water toward them. Upon arrival, he still bore the flush of wine. He apologized, saying, “Yesterday, Wu Zixu insisted I stay for drinks, delaying me and causing Your Majesty this distress.” The Lord of Wu smiled and replied, “Masters are often detained by spirits and deities—such is the reach of your virtue and power.”

One day, the Perfected Lord wandered at leisure in Kuaiji. A merchant from the region, returning from the sea, passed by a spirit’s shrine and saw an attendant summon him, saying, “I wish to entrust a letter to the Perfected Lord of Ge on Mount Kuaiji.” With that, the attendant tossed a sealed missive onto the merchant’s boat. The seal was as if nailed fast, immovable. Upon returning to Kuaiji, the merchant reported this to the Perfected Lord, who received the letter and opened it with ease. It was a missive from the Lord of the Lesser Hua Flowers, addressed to “The Perfected Lord of the Left Palace of the Great Ultimate.” The characters were written in tadpole script, an ancient form. Upon seeing this, people knew the Perfected Lord’s name had long been recorded in the celestial registers.

One day, the Lord of Wu invited the Perfected Lord to ascend the palace hall, where incense was burned and a fast observed. His disciples Zhang Tai, Kong Long, Zheng Siyuan, and others stood in attendance. The Lord of Wu said, “In my ignorance, I have yet to grasp the profound mysteries. I delight in tales of immortals and spirits and wish for you, Master, to instruct me in the secret canons, the principles of fasting and purification, and the swiftest path to cultivating truth. Among the ranks of Daoist scriptures, which should take precedence? Among talismans and secret diagrams, which are most wondrous? Enlighten my ignorance and fulfill my hopes.”

The Perfected Lord rose from his seat and replied, “Since Your Majesty deigns to inquire, how dare I conceal anything? Yet this is not a matter for rulers to pursue with single-minded devotion. If, amidst the myriad affairs of state, you can still the heart and hold to the One, the Way is not far off. The Dao of immortals is subtle and wondrous, as recorded in the alchemical classics. To study the Dao and cultivate immortality, one must first refine conduct and uphold precepts—only then can gradual progress be made. Once the Dao is established in practice, one may ingest numinous medicines, guide and refine the primordial *qi*, swallow and absorb the Great Harmony, regulate the breath of yin and yang, and forge the inner elixir. Thus may one become an earthbound immortal: unscathed by fire, undrowned by water, transcending calamities, averting misfortune, and summoning good fortune. Yet this requires the completion of fasting and purification.

“The scripture containing these teachings emerges from the *Wondrous Canon of the Numinous Treasure, the Cavernous Mystery of the Great Dao, the Primordial Ultimate, the Spontaneous and True One, the Five Invocations*, found within the *Inner Writings of the Three Sovereigns*. The ancient texts on immortality therein declare that all wondrous arts culminate in the Great Law of the Numinous Treasure. In former times, Celestial Master Zhang attained immortality after personally receiving from the Most High Lord Lao the secret methods of the Orthodox Unity Alliance of Might for cultivating truth, as well as the *Five Invocations of the Numinous Treasure*, with fasting as their foundation. The Great Law of the Numinous Treasure is concise in text yet profound in meaning—its depths cannot be fully expounded.

“Earthbound immortals first ascend the numinous mountains to become their divine overseers. Their great term spans six hundred years, or three hundred for some, after which they all ascend to become celestial immortals. Only through the ninefold cyclical refinement of the golden elixir, the golden liquid and jade nectar, can one ride clouds and mount dragons to ascend to heaven in broad daylight. As for the *True Scripture of the Great Cavern*, its recitation alone enables ascension, allowing one to sit and behold the ten directions without need for elixirs or potions. Those with the bone of immortals may encounter this text. Those who steal its numinous words, though they grow wings, cannot fly. One must receive oral transmission from a master, swear oaths before the heavens and true immortals—only then may it be passed on.

“The *Inner Writings of the Three Sovereigns*, the *Seven Transformations and Seven Treasures of the Ten Lands of the Five Marchmounts*, and the *Inner Chapters of the Numinous Diagrams* are all treasured by the highest immortals. Those who study the Dao progress from the subtle to the manifest, from the near to the distant, without skipping steps. The talismans and diagrams of the Numinous Treasure are most exalted and weighty, capable of delivering one from the nine hundred and six calamities of the Great Yang. Those who transcend the Three Realms and become Perfected Ones all follow this path.”

The Lord of Wu said, “By the accumulated blessings of past lives, I have become a ruler. Now, by good fortune, I have met a sage and heard these wondrous teachings. Though I am mired in frivolity, my heart holds reverence. I shall inscribe them upon golden tablets, seal them in a jade casket, and never dare show them to the unworthy. I shall venerate them all my life.” The Perfected Lord replied, “If Your Majesty can do so, it is most excellent.”

At that time, a Buddhist monk named Daowei, having heard from afar of the Perfected Lord’s attainment of the Dao, came seeking him as a teacher. He bowed and inquired, “I have heard that the Dao knows no before or after, no past or present. May I ask whether its principles are the same or different?”

The Perfected Lord said, “In its essence, there is no distinction of high or low, noble or base, form or name—hence it is called the Dao. Laozi existed before Heaven and Earth, and in the age of the Shang dynasty, he manifested to broadly proclaim the teachings of the Dao, guiding both Hua and Rong. Responding to things naturally, he is forever without birth or extinction.”

The Perfected Lord said, “The left is yang, and yang governs generation. The right is yin, and yin governs extinction. In utmost yin there is no birth; in utmost yang there is no extinction—such is the principle of nature. Yet the Great Dao is profoundly esoteric and not transmitted to the vulgar. None but the utmost persons of the world may hear of it.”

Daowei bowed again and exclaimed in admiration, “Excellent! I wish to hear of this Dao.”

The Perfected Lord said, “Those whose merit and virtue are not yet complete do not seek immortality. You, however, have fulfilled your merit and completed your virtue in past lives. My predecessors have already been your teachers. By karmic affinity, we meet again, and you shall soon transcend the world.”

Thereupon, he established an altar on Mount Tiantai and bestowed upon Daowei the *True Forms of the Five Peaks*, saying, “This is the token of transmission from the Most High. Carry it as you travel to the famous mountains of the eight directions, and the Three Realms shall receive you with reverence.” He also transmitted the *Scripture of the Golden Elixir of the Most High*, the *Five Sacred Treasures of the Numinous Treasure’s Natural Radiance*, the *Inner Writings of the Three Sovereigns*, the *Golden Writ of the Wondrous Scripture of Great Possession*, the *Jade-Light Numinous Writ*, the *Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Purple Writ of the Great Cavern*, the *Hidden Writ of the Grand Empyrean*, the *Illuminated Mirror Register*, and a single stalk of *Taiyi’s Dragon-Soaring Mushroom*. He summoned the covenant spirits and commanded each to be worn upon the body. He then instructed his disciple Zheng Siyuan to orally transmit the essential instructions.

He further addressed Siyuan and the others, saying, “Long ago, I received the *True Forms of the Five Peaks* and the *Scripture of the Golden Elixir* from Master Zuo Yuanfang on Mount Chicheng. Today, I entrust them to you. As for the various talismans and registers, the *True Scriptures of the Cavern of Perfection*, the *Cavern of Mystery*, and the *Cavern of Divinity*, these were transmitted to me by the Perfected One of the Great Ultimate, Xu Laile, at Kuaiji. I have already disseminated them in the Hezao Grotto-Heaven west of the Great River. These are forbidden texts of the Upper Realm, guarded by flying immortals. Today, I entrust them to you to uphold the Great Dharma. Yet the prohibitions of the Nine Heavens are weighty—do not show them to the unworthy. If there are those of utmost sincerity, transmit them in accordance with the *Bright Statutes of the Four Poles* over the span of kalpas.”

Siyuan and the others bowed again, receiving the precepts and commands.

He also gave Daowei a grain of immortal medicine, enabling him to abstain from grains and forsake the five flavors and worldly cravings, so that he might wander far among the famous mountains and sever worldly affairs. After Daowei ingested it, along with the *Flowing Brilliance’s Seven Luminaries Purple Pellet Elixir*, he immediately felt his body lighten, his mind and spirit at ease, free from all desires. When the hundred-day retreat was complete, the Perfected Lord further instructed Daowei, “You should return to Mount Song and fast for three years. Thereafter, go to Wangwu Mountain, purify your fast, and meditate deeply upon the Great Dharma.”

Having received the essential instructions, sacred scriptures, and immortal medicines, Daowei was neither hungry nor thirsty. He wished to remain and attend the Perfected Lord, but the Perfected Lord said, “If your heart holds me, I shall be visible to you—there is no need for attachment. Now, your mortal form has only just begun to learn and has not yet attained penetrating vision. You should ascend Mount Song. When you arrive, you will see the various Perfected Ones, who will further instruct you. After five years, I shall transmit to you the secret instructions, perfecting your Dao, so that you may attain penetrating vision of the formless and perceive the ten directions as clearly as objects in your palm or reflections in a mirror. You and your companions shall dwell on the Terrace of Gentle Winds for three hundred years before ascending to Heaven.”

“Some attain the Dao of immortality and ascend to Heaven in broad daylight within their lifetime. Others take ten, dozens, or hundreds of years, or even three thousand, five thousand, or ten thousand years before ascending. Before attaining ascension, they temporarily reside in the Five Peaks, the famous mountains, the grotto-heavens and blessed lands, or among the Ten Continents and Three Islands in the Eight Seas. There, palaces of the seven treasures and chambers of jade and jasper abound, along with natural gold, silver, pearls, and jade, immortal medicines, and countless rare and wondrous treasures beyond description. Natural music resounds through the Great Void, phoenixes and qilin intermingle in dance. Amid jade trees and forests of coral, pure winds arise, their sounds like the *Nine Shao* melodies. Those immortals who have not yet ascended dwell in these palaces within and beyond the mountains, at leisure in joyous feasting. To wander together with your companions—is this not bliss? Yet you must broadly accumulate good deeds and travel to the Five Peaks to pay homage to the various Perfected Lords. I may not tarry in these mountains to wander and rest with the host of immortals. Fast for seven days, then ingest the mushroom I gave you earlier. You will need no food or drink, and your harmonious qi will be at ease, sparing you from old age. How much more so if you cultivate the Great Scriptures!”

Then, on the famous mountain of Tiantai, he addressed Zheng Siyuan, saying, “The various scriptures of the Three Caverns and Numinous Treasure, the covenants of the Upper Clarity, which I have transmitted—on the day of my ascension, one copy shall be entrusted to Hezao Mountain, and another to the disciples of my lineage, to be transmitted through the generations to those of worth. Do not lightly bestow them, nor show them to the unworthy. If you find the right person, transmit them without secrecy.”

He further instructed his disciples, “I shall traverse the Five Peaks and rest my carriage on Penglai.”

At that time, he briefly returned to the capital to pay his respects to Lord Xie Hao. During a gathering with his younger cousin, the Director of the Bureau of Scrutiny Xi, he remarked, “Among my disciples, there are those of broad talent and erudition, whose reputations resound at court and whose families flourish. Yet I fear none have pursued the Way of immortality. They are steadfast in refining literary arts

When the Immortal Lord refined his elixir, he often ground herbs in a stone mortar embedded in the cliff face of West Peak. Once, a grain no larger than a millet seed fell from his pestle. A bird happened upon it, ate it, and thereby attained immortality. To this day, on nights of still moonlight and gentle breeze, the bird can be heard making the *ding-dang* sound of pestle and mortar—hence its name, the Elixir-Pounding Crow.

The Immortal Qin Gao, having heard of the Immortal Lord’s attainment of the Dao, rode a pair of carp from the Eastern Sea to visit him at Reclining Cloud Hermitage. The two drank deeply together. Once intoxicated, Qin Gao stepped outside to relieve himself, and upon sobering, found the carp transformed into stone. The Immortal Lord then gifted him a pair of cranes, upon which he departed. Those stones remain to this day in the rear mountains.

In the first year of the Red Crow era, the year *wuwu* of the sexagenary cycle, on the first day of the eleventh month, the Most High successively bestowed three decrees, dispatching celestial officials to announce them in the Court of Blessings.

The first decree read: *"The Jade Writ of the Most High proclaims: The disciple of the Supreme Learning of Immortality, Ge Xuan, has cultivated苦行 through past kalpas, accumulating merit, sacrificing his body in almsgiving, and delivering those in peril. His devotion has moved the Most High, and his name is now inscribed in the Mystic Capital, his rank fixed among the Upper Immortals. Thus, wisdom and brilliance have descended upon his virtuous lineage. His nature is jade-pure, his fragrance like orchid in bloom; his celestial gifts surpass all, standing tall and unmatched. His Dao is profound and majestic, unrivaled in his generation. Forsaking worldly glory, he embraces simplicity and truth, devoting himself to the scriptures of immortality, preserving the One in hidden radiance. Roaming forests and peaks, he spurns the bustle of courts. With a compassionate heart, he ceaselessly delivers others. Now that his virtue and power are full, he is worthy of this decree. We hereby bestow upon him the Heavenly Treasure Feathered Robe, a skirt of cinnabar clouds to shatter the nets of the flying snare, a lotus-flowered crown of precious jade, the Golden True Divine Tiger Staff, the Banner of Commanding Demons, and the power to summon seas and mountains at will."*

The second decree read: *"We exhort the disciple of the Supreme Learning of Immortality, Ge Xuan: You have delved into hidden scriptures, translated sutras, observed long fasts, and cultivated stillness in thought. Your concentration is unwavering, your diligence tireless. We now grant you the Eight-Scenery Jade Chariot, drawn by dragons and borne on clouds, with a halo of radiant light crowning your head, golden seals and jade inscriptions to reward your past virtues, and authority to uphold the discipline of the Daoist gate. May later worthies look up to you as you uphold the Dharma Wheel. This decree of the Most High is weighed by the Three Heavens."*

The third decree read: *"The disciple of the Supreme Learning of Immortality, Ge Xuan, embodies virtue and magnifies the Dao, enlightening the unenlightened, universally delivering all beings to transcendence and awakening. His merits are accomplished, his name resounds, and even the loftiest immortals submit in faith. The hosts of the Three Realms and all spirits revere him with solemnity; his grace fills the ten directions, his might fulfills all desires. We now bestow upon him the title of Immortal Lord of the Supreme Jade Capital’s Great Ultimate Left Palace, with authority over the Six Heavens of the Three Realms and the Great Demon Kings. He shall preside over the registers of the Three Caverns and Four Supplements, attended by five hundred jade lads and maidens. In his left hand, he shall hold the Nine Radiance Flower Pestle; in his right, the True Scripture of the Mystic Cavern. With dragon banners and tiger tallies, he shall traverse the Nine Palaces of the Upper Clarity, thrice yearly paying homage at the Jade Capital and Golden Portals of the Mystic Capital in the Supreme Heaven. This decree of the Most High, borne by the Celestial Emperor, shall be executed in accordance with the ancient statutes of the Three Heavens."*

On the *jiazi* day of the first day of the eleventh month of the first year of the Red Crow era, the Celestial Emperor, whose taboo name is Yuan, proclaimed the decree at Huo Tong Mountain—also called Huo Mountain: *"The Immortal Lord’s golden elixir has ripened, and he has received three decrees from the Jade Emperor. He may no longer tarry in the mortal world. He must erect an altar, offer libations to heaven and earth, mountains and rivers, and all spirits before consuming the elixir."* Thereupon, within the Court of Blessings, he constructed an altar named the Eight Sceneries. On an auspicious day, he ascended the altar to offer thanks to heaven and earth. After three days of grand libations, he knelt and consumed the golden elixir. At that moment, celestial blossoms drifted to the earth, and divine light illuminated the heavens.

The Immortal Lord then addressed his disciples: *"Now that I have consumed the golden elixir, a celestial decree shall descend from heaven. The day of my ascension draws near."* He then concealed the secret registers of the Three Caverns and Four Supplements upon the sacred altar, saying, *"In time, a disciple of my lineage, devoted in heart and practice, shall inherit these. The transmission of these arcane scriptures and numinous texts shall bring blessings to the four seas."*

On the fifteenth day of the eighth month in the seventh year of the Red Crow era, at midday, suddenly celestial music resounded, banners and canopies veiled the sky, and a phoenix-drawn jade chariot descended from the void. Jade lads and maidens, divine officials in resplendent array, alighted before and behind the altar. A Flying Celestial Deva bore a jade edict; the Immortal Lord straightened his tablet, knelt, and faced the Heavenly Gate to receive the proclamation:

*"The disciple of the Supreme Learning of Immortality, Grand Master of the Mystic Treasure Scriptures and Registers, Ge Xuan, has long devoted himself to the supreme Dao, skillfully nurturing the essence of the embryo. He has expounded true scriptures, refining and offering them for the deliverance of sunken souls; he has compiled immortal classics, illuminating the path for later learners. His hidden deeds have saved the world, his secret practices align with the true. His name is inscribed in the Jade Capital, his body belongs to the celestial realms. We hereby specially bestow upon him the title of Immortal Lord of the Supreme Jade Capital’s Great Ultimate Left Palace, with authority over the Six Heavens of the Three Realms and the Great Demon Kings, and charge him with presiding over the affairs of the Three Caverns and Four Supplements. He shall ascend at the hour of noon on the fifteenth day of the eighth month of the *jiazi* year, proceeding directly to the celestial court. We further grant him a jade casket of golden elixir and immortal robes."*

This decree of the Most High, borne by the Celestial Emperor, shall be executed in accordance with the ancient statutes of the Three Heavens. The Celestial Emperor, whose taboo name is Yuan, proclaimed the edict at the Court of Blessings on Mount Hezao.

The Immortal Lord gazed toward the Heavenly Gate, bowed twice, and received the decree. Then, beside East Peak, he bid farewell to his disciples and friends. Ascending the Robing Terrace, he donned a gown of parted mist, a lotus-flowered crown of precious jade, a halo of radiant light crowning his head, and held a jade tablet. Clad in crimson skirts and vermilion shoes, jade pendants chiming at his waist, he seated himself in the Eight-Scenery Jade Chariot, preceded and followed by jade lads and maidens, flanked by divine escorts. Auspicious clouds and white cranes swirled in the azure sky as he rose slowly aloft.

The disciples and friends clung to him, reluctant to part. Thereupon, the Immortal Lord briefly halted his celestial chariot and composed three five-character poems, which he bestowed upon his companions, bidding them chant and recite them widely to enlighten those yet to come. In the year of his ascension, he was eighty-one. The three poems are recorded below.

**The First:**
The Perfected One once left his teachings,
Moved by pity for the benighted and foolish.
Those who reject the Dao and trust in wickedness—
From this do calamity and chaos arise.
The body fades swift as morning dew,
Regret and remorse know no end.
Sins too great to cast away
Poison the streams—who shall govern them?
In darkness, the hour of deliverance unseen,
Only when the kalpa ends will it cease.
Passed down to the poor and lowly,
Again they are made to serve.
Their limbs may be broken,
Begging in the marketplace with shattered jade.
Unknowing of the retribution for accumulated sins,
They rail against Heaven, spurning the gods.
The Great Dao is ever non-action,
Its vastness begins with goodness.
Now I attain lightness and ascent,
Through cultivation and merit achieved.
The Three Realms all bow their heads,
As I recline in the Purple Palace’s ease.
Halting my chariot in the Void,
Life flows like water.
At parting, I inscribe these plain words,
Roughly marking the wondrous and subtle.

**The Second:**
Now I ascend to Heaven,
My thoughts turn to all you learned ones.
The Dao’s essence is emptiness and nothingness,
In stillness, its essence abides.
Though it seems obscure and dim,
Within its depths, all is bright and clear.
Do not call the Dao false and vain—
The fault lies in lack of sincerity.
Why not climb the sacred mountains,
And chant the *Dongzhen Jing*?
With each recitation and song,
The mystic sound pierces the Great Clarity.
The Most High radiates a golden countenance,
All immortals join in unison.
From the ten directions, fragrant flowers scatter,
Incense smoke of plum and sandalwood perfumes the air.
The Royal Consort plays the *Nine Shao*,
Phoenixes and simurghs harmonize in song.
Dragon-drawn chariots veil the sky in welcome,
Canopies of light illumine the distant dark.
Leisurely, I ascend the Terrace of Kalpas,
Indra suddenly descends to the courtyard.
The Eight Kings offer elixir,
Which I drink—my body grows light.
Carefree, I wander the realms of being and non-being,
Luminous, beyond form and name.
Divine youths attend at my side,
Naturally paying homage to the myriad spirits.
Swaying in the Eight-Scenery Chariot,
I feast and wander in the White Jade Capital.
My seven ancestors ascend to the Hall of Blessings,
All the departed are liberated and reborn.
If kings and lords hold steadfast faith,
They shall surely become the world’s pillars.
The great embrace the supreme virtue,
All things partake of its completion.

**The Third:**
Roaming freely through mountains and waters,
I exhaled and inhaled the numinous springs.
Refining qi, I awaited the subtle and still,
Silently chanting the *Daode Pian*.
With utmost sincerity, I revered the Mystic One,
And now, at last, my hidden resonance is revealed.
A flying chariot drawn by nine dragons,
I soar on swirling purple mist.
Radiant splendor lights the celestial thoroughfare,
Crimson clouds gather before the Emperor.
Briefly I tarry at Penglai Palace,
In an instant, I am a guest of Heaven.
Majestic, the assembly of all Perfected,
Vast, I ascend through the layered mysteries.
My form is eternal, beyond kalpas,
My golden visage shines fresh as the sun.
In joy, I forget the upper realms,
Yet grieve for all living beings.
Who can escape decay and death,
Bound by unseen karmic threads?
Vast and boundless, the perfect Dao,
No gap exists where it does not enter.
Subtle and wondrous, hard to fathom—
The wise call me worthy.
If one can magnify its myriad wonders,
Lightly they shall rise as immortals.

When the songs were finished, clouds and birds slowly ascended to Heaven and departed. The Immortal Lord left behind for the world the *Preface to Laozi’s Daode Jing*, three scrolls of *Methods for Fasting and Ingesting Qi*, nineteen scrolls of the *Scripture on Meditation in the Mountains*, along with his divine immortal songs and poems.

According to the *Annals of Yu and Earth*, Emperor Wu of the Han dynasty favored the Daoist arts and often consorted with the immortal Ge Xuan, whom he deeply respected. For him, he specially established the Dongxuan Abbey on Mount Fang. Later, the Immortal Lord ascended to Heaven in broad daylight at Mount Hezao, and to this day, the cauldron for decocting medicine and the mortar for grinding elixirs remain on Mount Fang.

In the third year of Chongning of the Song dynasty, on the twenty-eighth day of the second month, the imperial carriage visited the Altar of Immortal Lord Ge in Hezao Mountain, Qingren County, Linjiang Prefecture. A land of sublime mountains and rivers, a dwelling of immortals and sages—his illustrious virtue and mighty deeds, renowned throughout the world, compelled Us to honor him with rites. The Perfected One’s parting words and established teachings all lead to the ultimate principle, transcending the mundane to soar with the Dao. His altar within the jade palace has stood for years, where prayers for blessings and relief have brought great benefit to the people.

Bestowing splendid honors in commendation, We specially establish a lofty title, that his beneficent influence may be sought, and this realm eternally blessed. Let him be specially enfeoffed as Perfected One of Penetrating Response.

In the sixth year of Chunyou of the reign of Emperor Lizong, on the seventeenth day of the third month, an imperial decree was issued concerning the Perfected One of Penetrating Response, Lord Ge of Mount Hezao under the jurisdiction of Qingjiang County, Linjiang Prefecture. Zhuang Zhou said: "The spirit-man employs things without harm, and the grain ripens in season—is this not what is meant by an immortal?" You cultivated the sublime Dao upon the renowned mountain, and the age has transmitted the tale of your ascension—this is long established. During the Chongning era, you were already granted enfeoffment. Recently, the regional commissioner, responding to the entreaties of the local officials, again memorialized the efficacy of prayers and the repeated abundance of the harvests. Though We hold no predilection for the discourse of Daoist adepts, We commend your merit among the people and thus command the ritual officials to expand your honorific title. As for riding clouds and driving the wind, roaming beyond the eight directions—what need is there for a name? Yet this is but to manifest Our heartfelt admiration and esteem.

Let him be specially enfeoffed as Perfected Lord of Penetrating Response and Blessed Protection.

*Record of Perfected Immortals Through the Ages Who Embodied the Dao and Penetrated the Mysteries, Scroll Twenty-Three* (concluded)
*Record of Perfected Immortals Through the Ages Who Embodied the Dao and Penetrated the Mysteries, Scroll Twenty-Four*

Zheng Siyuan

In his youth, Zheng Siyuan was a scholar well-versed in the laws of calendrical astronomy and apocryphal texts. In later years, he became a disciple of Ge Xiaoxian, receiving the Orthodox Unity scriptures, the Three Sovereigns’ esoteric texts, the True Forms of the Five Peaks, the *Taiqing Scripture of Golden Liquor*, and the *Five Talismans of the Cavernous Mystery*. He took residence in Ma’er Mountain of Lujiang, where his benevolence extended even to birds and beasts. On the mountain where he dwelled, a tiger gave birth to two cubs. The villagers below captured the mother tiger, causing the father to flee in alarm, leaving the cubs unable to fend for themselves. Upon witnessing this, Siyuan took them back to his mountain abode and raised them. The father tiger later returned and remained by Siyuan’s side. Thereafter, whenever Siyuan traveled, he would ride the father tiger, while the two cubs carried his scriptures, clothing, and medicines in tow.

Once, at Yongkang’s Hengjiang Bridge, he encountered an acquaintance, Xu Yin, who prepared warm medicinal wine. The tigers immediately gathered firewood and kindled a fire. Xu Yin suffered from a toothache and asked Siyuan for a tiger’s whisker, intending to heat it and insert it into the aching tooth for relief. Siyuan plucked the whisker for him, and the tiger remained still, submitting without resistance.

Minister Daoyi remarks: The *Daodejing* states, “The highest virtue is like water; water benefits all things and does not contend.” Siyuan may indeed be called one of the highest virtue. In nurturing the Dao amidst forests and springs, his benevolence extended even to birds and beasts. Tigers are creatures that harm humans, universally feared and reviled. Yet Siyuan pitied the cubs for losing their mother, taking them in and raising them. The ancients warned that “raising a tiger invites calamity,” a principle that would seem inevitable. Yet Siyuan saw no peril in this, and the tigers even carried his scriptures, clothing, and medicines, gathering firewood to kindle flames. Truly, this may be called the loftiness of the Dao, the depth of virtue, and the resonance of the highest goodness.

—Ge Hong

Ge Hong, styled Zhichuan, was a native of Jurong in Danyang. From youth, he loved learning, but his family was poor. He personally chopped firewood to trade for paper and ink, and at night, he would transcribe books and recite them, thereby gaining renown as a Confucian scholar. By nature, he was free from desires, possessing no fondness for playthings, unaware even of the number of lines on a chessboard or the names of dice games. He was simple and inarticulate, disdaining fame and profit. He shut his door and swept away worldly dust, never engaging in social visits. Occasionally, he would seek out books or inquire about their meanings, traveling thousands of miles over rugged paths, enduring hardships to obtain them. Thus, he thoroughly studied the classics and canons, with a particular fondness for the methods of divine transcendents and Daoist nourishment. His great-uncle, Ge Xuan, had learned the Dao and attained immortality during the Wu dynasty, earning the title "Divine Lord Ge." Xuan transmitted his secret arts of elixir refinement to his disciple Zheng Yin, and Hong studied under Yin, mastering all his techniques.

In the early years of Emperor Cheng of Jin’s reign during the Xianhe era, the Minister over the Masses, Wang Dao, summoned him to serve as a clerk in the provincial administration, later selecting him as a Gentleman Cavalier Attendant and concurrently Director of the Palace Library. Hong firmly declined and did not accept the posts. As he grew older, he wished to refine elixirs to prolong his life. Hearing that cinnabar was produced in Jiaozhi, he requested to be appointed Magistrate of Julou. The emperor, considering Hong’s high reputation, refused. Hong said, “I do not seek honor; it is for the cinnabar.” The emperor relented. Hong then set out with his sons and nephews. Upon reaching Guangzhou, the provincial governor Deng Yue detained him, but Hong refused to stay and departed. He eventually settled on Mount Luofu to refine elixirs, residing there for many years, living in leisurely seclusion and writing without cease.

In his preface, he wrote: “Hong lacks the talent for advancement, yet by chance favors the pursuit of non-action. If I were to spread my wings, I could soar through the ethereal skies; if I were to spur my feet, I could chase the wind and tread upon shadows. Yet I still wish to restrain my strong pinions among the flock of sparrows and conceal my swiftness among the ranks of lame donkeys. How much more so when the great cosmos has endowed me with but ordinary, short wings, and creation has lent me the most sluggish and halting of steps? Having carefully assessed my limitations, how dare I strive like a fly aspiring to soar to the heavens or urge on a lame turtle to pursue the path of a flying hare? Thus, I have turned away from the path of glory and honor, contenting my aspirations in the realm of poverty and ruin. The petals of the lotus possess the sweetness of the eight delicacies, while the thatched hut offers the joy of floating duckweed.”

The Confucians of the world know only to revere the teachings of Zhou and Confucius, disbelieving in the books of divine transcendents. Not only do they ridicule them, but they also slander and defame the true and correct. Therefore, I have written on the matters of alchemical gold and silver in what I call the *Inner Chapters*. The remaining refutations and explanations are titled the *Outer Chapters*. Together, the inner and outer chapters number one hundred and sixteen. Though they may not be worthy of concealment in the famous mountains, I intend to seal them in a golden casket to show to those who understand. I style myself the *Master Embracing Simplicity*, and thus name the book accordingly.

Hong was erudite and deeply versed in learning, unmatched in the lands south of the Yangtze. His writings were more abundant than those of Ban [Gu] and Sima [Qian]. He was also skilled in discerning the traces of the mysterious and analyzing principles with profound subtlety. Later, he suddenly sent a letter to Yue, saying, “I shall travel to seek a teacher and will depart on the appointed day.” When Yue received the letter, he hurried to bid farewell, but by the time he arrived, Hong had sat motionless until midday, appearing as if asleep, and had passed away. Yue thus did not get to see him again. Hong was eighty-one years old. His complexion appeared as if alive, and his body remained supple. When his body was lifted into the coffin, it was as light as an empty garment, and the world believed he had attained immortality through *shijie* (release from the corpse).

The historian remarks: From the time Zhichuan first tied his hair to study, he remained tireless in old age. He gathered rare texts from the archives, compiling the lost writings of a hundred generations; he recorded the transformations of the immortal realms, exhausting the secret arts of the nine elixirs. He rejected fleeting honors and abandoned miscellaneous arts, disdaining worldly treasures and cherishing every moment. Roaming in virtue and dwelling in truth, he transcended the mundane world. Among the ways of preserving life, his was the most excellent.

Tang Geng of Meishan in the Zixi year of the Xianchun era of Emperor Duzong of the Song wrote a eulogy: “The lands south of the Yangtze had grown coarse, devoid of moral splendor. Soaring yet not alighting, he flew gracefully south. Deng Yue was but a petty child, a remnant of the faction of [Sima] Zhong. What understanding could he possess? Yet even he looked up in admiration. I refine the inner elixir and thus dwell on Mount Luofu. Was it because of Yue that I debated staying or leaving? What I sought was great; why should I care for the small? My association with Yue was like befriending gulls.”

Daoyi remarks: The *Daodejing* states, “Favor and disgrace are like startling alarms; regard great trouble as you would your own body.” Ge Hong, with his outstanding talent and learning, abandoned the esteemed path of official rank—how could this be without reason? After the Jin court moved east, treacherous ministers wrought disaster, and the royal way declined. Extraordinary scholars and remarkable individuals rarely appeared. The lands south of the Yangtze were in turmoil—when would they find stability? Ge Hong’s vision may be called rising above the common herd. Thus, he was untroubled by the world’s neglect and delighted in the Dao, preserving his true nature. He left favor behind, and disgrace did not touch him; he forgot himself, and trouble did not reach him. In the end, he remained steadfast in his studies, and the immortal Dao was accomplished. Later Daoists should take him as their model.

Huang Yeren—Huang Yeren was a disciple of the Divine Lord Ge, or some say he was Ge’s servant. When Zhichuan retired to the mountains to refine elixirs, Yeren followed him. After Ge attained immortality and departed, he left an elixir between the pillar and the stone. Yeren, returning from outside, found a single pill and consumed it, becoming an earth-traveling immortal. His physical body remains in the world to this day, and those who are fortunate may encounter him.

Later, someone traveling on Mount Luofu stayed overnight in a rocky valley. In the middle of the night, they saw a man whose body was unclothed but covered in green fur, and they surmised he must be an immortal. They bowed and inquired of the Dao, but the man paid no heed, merely laughing loudly several times, his voice shaking the forest trees. He sang a poem:
*“Clouds come, and ten thousand peaks stir;*
*Clouds depart, and the sky is one hue.*
*Laughing long two or three times,*
*The empty mountains beneath the autumn moon turn white.”*
This was clearly Yeren.

During the Xianchun era of Emperor Duzong of the Song, a traveler wearing a black square hat and a Han-style robe wandered about Mount Luofu. Upon seeing people, he would laugh loudly and run away. For three years, he did not reveal his name. One day, returning drunk, he suddenly took coal and wrote on the wall:
*“The clouds’ intent is unknown,*
*As the blue sea’s spring light.”*

Seeking to ascend the verdant heights, one stumbles at a single misstep.
Though a thousand kalpas pass in longing, the plum blossoms have not returned.
Having written this, he crossed the sea and departed—was he not one of the wild immortals’ company?

**Perfected Yang Xi**
The Perfected Yang, styled Junxi, was born in the ninth month of the gengyin year of the fifth Xianhe era of Emperor Cheng of Jin. A native of Wu, he came to reside in Jurong and studied the Dao on Mount Mao. Of fair complexion and handsome bearing, he was eloquent and fond of laughter. Diligent in calligraphy and devoted to learning, he was well-versed in the classics and histories. Profound and solemn by nature, he possessed from childhood the discernment of spiritual communion. Early on, he formed a divine bond with the two Xus: Xu Mai, the Far-Wanderer, and Xu Mu, the Prefect. The Prefect recommended him to the Prince-Regent, who appointed him Attendant of the Ducal Residence. In the early Yonghe era of Emperor Mu, he received the *Zhonghuang Method for Taming Tigers and Leopards*. In the sixth year, he studied the *Five Lingbao Talismans* under Liu Pu, the eldest son of Lady Wei. The Master was deep and serene in his responses, embracing emptiness with self-possession, like the natural affinity of dryness and moisture for fire and water. In profound stillness, he revered the unseen, and the transmission flowed without trace.

At thirty-six, in the third year of the Xingning era of Emperor Ai (yichou), a host of Perfected descended to bestow upon him the essentials of the Dao. Among them were the Supreme Minister Green Lad, the Perfected of Great Emptiness, the Crimson Lord High Steward, the Lord of Western Citadel, the Perfected Mao of Taiyuan, the Perfected Pei of Pure Numinosity, the Perfected King of Tongbai, the Perfected Zhou of Purple Yang, the Middle Mao Lord, the Lesser Mao Lord, the Marquis Fan, the Marquis Xun, the Lady of Purple Radiance, the Lady of Southern Marchmount, the Lady of Right Florescence, the Lady of Purple Tenuity, the Ninth Hua Consort An, the Lady of Illustrious Numinosity, and the Lady of the Marquisate—none failed to trail rainbow banners in the hidden dusk, refine their spirit steeds in secret, or gather like drifting clouds in the ethereal void, their traces vanishing from mortal paths. Their golden voices resounded like chimes in the Master’s presence. Not a day passed without their visitation, nor a year without fulfillment.

Yang studied under Lady Wei, befriending the Nine Hua and the assembly of Perfected. Thus the Ninth Hua Consort An declared: “The Radiant Master’s spirit is empty and at ease, his secret structure jade-bright. A lofty current from the orchid spring, his pure resonance fills the golden palace. He is destined to serve as a high minister among the Four Assistants, receiving the mandate of the Sage Lord, governing life and severing death, rewarding and punishing spirits, commanding the thousand numina, sealing mountains and summoning clouds. He shall oversee the harmonious qi of yin and yang and become the Lord of Spirits and Gods over Wu and Yue.” Twenty-two years later, he would ride the dragon and mount the clouds in broad daylight to ascend to heaven. If he could not endure the smoke of wind and fire, he might seek release by the sword as a final defense.

The Perfected of Mystic Purity further instructed Xi: “To study the Dao is like shooting an arrow: one must aim straight and unwavering to strike the target. Enter the mountains with resolve, advance without doubt, and you shall attain the utmost truth.” Xi reverently received the teaching, practiced diligently, and achieved immortality. Later, Emperor Jianwen of Jin’s empress became his disciple and attained the Dao. Xi eventually departed through the sword-release and vanished in concealment. The *True Reports* record that he passed away in the twelfth year of the Taiyuan era of Emperor Xiaowu (bingxu).

His disciple Xu Liu—whose father, Xu Mu, had also encountered the Perfected through Yang—continued the lineage. Thus the nine members of the Xu clan, though blessed with prior karmic connections, saw their spiritual awakening unfold like dust settling on a mirror, their brilliance polished by Yang’s guidance. In the thirteenth year of the Taiyuan era, Yang rode the clouds and drove the dragon westward to pay homage at the Great Simplicity, northward to the Jade Purity. He assisted the Eastern Florescence and oversaw the affairs of spirits and gods in Wu and Yue. The *Records of the Cinnabar Terrace* state that he became the Eastern Florescence’s chief assistant.

**Xu Liu, the Perfected of Leiping Mountain**
The Perfected Xu Liu, styled Daoxiang and nicknamed Jade Axe, was the son of Xu Mu, the Jin Prefect and Defender-in-Chief, who held the true rank of Left Minister of Supreme Clarity. His mother, née Tao and named Tadpole, had earlier entered the grotto-heavens before Xu Mu and was appointed Lady of the Transmuted Office. From childhood, the Perfected stood out with exceptional purity, his inner truth profound and inscrutable. Xu Mu recognized his extraordinary qualities. Though recommended for the posts of Provincial Accounts Officer and Registrar, he declined all appointments. Radiant and refined, he shed worldly concerns like a spring clearing its turbidity, advancing naturally as his vessel filled.

Residing at the foot of Leiping Mountain, he studied under Master Yang and transmitted the *Orthodox Script of the Three Heavens* and the *Phoenix Texts of Plain Silk*. Later, the Perfected of the Definitive Register bestowed upon him the Supreme Dao, admonishing him: “Studying the Dao is like digging a well: the deeper you go, the harder it is to remove the earth. Without unwavering resolve and upright conduct, how can you reach the spring’s source?” The Perfected longed to wander the grotto-chambers early and did not wish to linger in the mortal realm. He journeyed north to announce his departure and dwelled in the Fangyuan Hall of the Fang’ou Grotto on Square Mountain. He often traveled to the Four-Square Terrace, hence the *True Reports* state: “Though the secluded one lived in the world, his heart always delighted in dwelling there.” A letter from Master Yang to Xu Mu also mentions: “I wonder if the Perfected of the Directions has established his seat in the Transmuted Gate. Sixteen years later, he shall ascend to the Eastern Florescence, receive the scriptures, and be appointed Perfected Lord of Supreme Clarity and Prime Minister.”

The *Genealogy of the Celestial Dawn* records his age as thirty but does not note the year of his departure. According to the two registers, in the second year of the Taihe era of Emperor Fei of Jin (dingmao), he was twenty-seven. Thus he was born in the seventh year of the Xiankang era of Emperor Cheng (xinchou). The *Annotations to the True Reports* state he was born in the sixth year of the Xianhe era, and the records of his appointment by the Minister of Education are incorrect. After the third year of the Taihe era, no further traces of him appeared. According to the genealogy, he was thirty at his departure, which would place his passing in the gengwu year. The *Traditions of the Elders* recount: “On the northern stone altar of the northern grotto, he burned incense and prostrated himself, then lay down and did not rise. The next morning, his form appeared as if alive. The altar remains to this day.”

It is further said that he received the method of ritual disrobing from Zhang Zhennan, which he performed at night upon the altar, then departed. He married the daughter of Huang Yan, Prefect of Jiankang, and fathered a son, Huang Min, before returning home.

Xu Huangmin, Magistrate of Linju and Perfected Immortal of the Xu clan—styled Xuanwen, son of Li of the Upper Clarity Immortal Lords and grandson of Mu, Left Minister of Upper Clarity—was born in the fifth year of the Shengping era of Emperor Mu of Jin (xinyou). At the age of twenty-one, he married the daughter of Ge Wan’an, Prefect of Xiyang (Wan’an being the second grandson of the *Baopuzi*), and served successively as Registrar of the Commandery, Filial and Incorrupt Candidate, Aide to the Minister of Agriculture, Adjunct to the Protector of the Southern Man, and Magistrate of Linju. In the third year of the Yongxing era of Emperor Hui, when the capital was in turmoil, he carried the scriptures to Kuaiji, where he was revered by Ma Lang. Lang’s younger cousin, Han, also provided him with generous support. At the time, all knew that Master Xu had attained the Dao, and as both his father and grandfather were renowned, they accorded him even greater veneration.

In the sixth year of the Yuanjia era of Emperor Wen of Liu Song, wishing to relocate to Qiantang, he sealed a cabinet of his true scriptures in Lang’s quiet quarters, instructing, “This is the abode of immortals and spirits—even if there are books, do not share them with others.” Later, when he stayed briefly at the home of Du Daoju, he passed away at the age of sixty-nine. The *True Reports* state that Huang Min, his great-uncle Mai, his grandaunt Ehuang, his elder cousin Lian, Huang Min’s son Rong, and his grandniece Qionghui all achieved transcendence.

Ma Lang revered the scriptures as he would his lord and father. Whenever numinous radiance and sacred qi manifested in his halls, Lang’s wife repeatedly saw jade maidens in azure robes moving through the air. His household thus enjoyed prosperity and longevity. Later, Lang, enraged that He Dao of Shanyin had stolen the books and divulged their contents, cast molten bronze to seal the cabinet’s lock, forbidding his family from ever opening it again. After Lang’s death, his son Hong, who had received the teachings from Ji Zhen, continued to uphold the tradition.

In the first year of the Jinghe era of the Deposed Emperor, the lay scholar Lou Huiming persuaded Ji Zhen to petition for the cabinet’s forced opening. Ji Zhen, well-versed in the Daoist arts, was esteemed in his time. Upon its opening, the scriptures were presented at the Hualin Gardens.

Upon beholding the true scriptures at last, their vermilion and yellow hues blazed with such radiance that none dared to peruse them fully. When Emperor Ming ascended the throne, Ji Zhen petitioned to reclaim the texts for his private collection. Later, Lu Jianji journeyed south to establish the Chongxu Cloister, and the scriptures were thus returned to the imperial repository.

How wondrous was the divine workings—first concealed within Ma’s lineage, then revealed through Ji, and finally entrusted to Master Lu. Though Ma and Ji revered the tradition of wrapping texts in silk and storing them in cabinets, they never penetrated its profound mysteries.

Lu Xiujing, the Master of Mount Lu, was a scion of the illustrious Lu clan of Wuxing, styled Xiujing. From the moment primordial qi descended and gave him life, he stood apart from the common world. His countenance was ever serene, his virtue ever radiant. Clarity illumined his writings, and emptiness bridged the unseen. In his youth, he devoted himself to Confucian scholarship, mastering the classics, apocrypha, and weft texts without exception. Yet he believed that those who aided the primordial transformation, uniting the essence of qi with the True Sovereign, were recorded in golden registers and jade scripts. Thus, he gathered the sacred texts scattered across the world, delving into hidden realms and obscure paths.

From Xiongxiang and Jiuyi to Luofu, westward to Wu Gorge and Mount Emei, his journey was like clouds mirrored in pine winds, resplendent upon mountains and reflected in waters. After his labors bore fruit and he knocked upon the gates of mystery, spirits bestowed upon him divine secrets. In that moment of serendipity, he attained communion with the questions of immortals and perfected beings.

At the end of the Yuanjia era of the Song, while selling medicine in the capital, Emperor Wen, who had long admired his Daoist bearing, dispatched a jeweled carriage drawn by rosy clouds, with the Left Chief Minister Xu Zhan conveying the imperial decree to detain him. The Master firmly declined, turning away without a glance, and departed with a sweep of his robes. Later, when the Emperor faced the disaster of the Taichu era, all marveled at the Master’s foresight.

At the time, the Master was sailing south along the Yangtze, particularly enamored with the sublime scenery of Mount Kuang. In the fifth year of the Daming era of Emperor Xiaowu, he built a hermitage at the foot of White Cloud Peak. In the third year of the Taishi era, Emperor Ming again issued an edict, dispatching Governor Wang Jingwen to earnestly persuade him. Reluctantly, the Master acquiesced. On the day of his departure, bears, tigers, apes, and crows filled the road with mournful cries, ceasing only when he left the mountain.

Upon his arrival at the capital, the Emperor established the Chongxu Cloister and Tongxian Terrace to receive him. There, the Master expounded the Dao with the wind at his back, his teachings profoundly nourishing the Emperor’s heart. Scholars of the court and commoners who recognized the truth flocked to him like water rushing into a ravine or wind responding to a tiger—who could resist? The Master dispelled the mists and unveiled the sun, sifted the sand to reveal gold, and pointed the way to overturn falsehoods. Those of middling capacity and above all fulfilled their destined measure, as did figures like Minister Yuan Ji.

After establishing the Chongxu Cloister, the treasured scriptures and esoteric teachings of Ji’s lineage were all entrusted to it. From then on, the degenerate customs of the age were transformed in an instant, and the Master became the revered teacher of both court and commonwealth.

The following year, when the Emperor fell ill, he summoned the Master to perform the Xu Tan ritual. That night, auspicious clouds swirled around the altar, and by dawn, the Emperor’s illness had abated. When Prince Guiyang waged war, leaving bleached bones strewn across the fields, the Master provided coffins and burial shrouds to inter them. His hidden virtues and subtle acts of kindness were too numerous to recount.

The Master repeatedly sought to return to his mountain, but the Emperor would not permit it. In the fifth year of the Yuanyong era of Emperor Cangwu, on the first day of spring, he suddenly addressed his disciples: “Bound by imperial favor, I have long deferred my deepest aspirations. Now I shall return to my old mountain—prepare the carriage.” His disciples drew near. On the second day of the third month, he lay down and peacefully departed, his body glowing with radiance, an extraordinary fragrance suffusing the air.

Three days later, disciples on Mount Lu witnessed the Master, his cloud banner shimmering, returning to his former retreat. In an instant, he vanished, leaving them astonished and awestruck. He had left instructions to be wrapped in a cloth sack and cast into a mountain ravine, but his disciples could not bear it. Thus, they returned his remains to Mount Lu. He was seventy-two years old—one who refined his form in the hidden earth and ascended in splendor to the Great Subtlety.

An edict posthumously bestowed upon him the title Master of Simplicity and Seclusion, and his former residence was designated the Jianji Abbey, honoring his Daoist legacy. Previously, the authenticity of texts in the Dongzhen canon had been muddled, but the Master edited and corrected them, drawing a clear line between the pure and the turbid. Thus, his liturgical and ritual standards became the model for future generations. He authored over a hundred works—records, treatises, and discourses—all of which circulated in the world. Among his disciples who attained the Dao, Sun Youyue and Li Guozhi were the most renowned.

Later, in a letter to Guozhi, Kong Dezhang wrote of the Master: “The Master’s Dao crowned the central capital, and his transformative influence flowed to the eastern lands. Emperors received his guidance, and the people revered his teachings. Now that his subtle words have ceased, the great Dharma is fading. As a preceptor endowed with divine stability and occupying the highest rank, your learning and enlightenment are the refuge of disciples. It is fitting that you restore his legacy, uphold the essentials, illuminate the Master’s remaining influence, and compile the transmission of his profound teachings. In doing so, you may guide the degenerate customs of later ages and enlighten those who follow.”

When the Master first answered the imperial summons, he had carried a cloth sack. After his passing and return to the mountain, a cloth sack was found hanging from a tree on the cliff. Today, the western ravine of his residence is named the Cloth Sack Peak. There stands a stone for offerings, six or seven feet tall, over a zhang in width and breadth, oriented toward the northwest—also called the Dipper-Worshipping Stone. Outside the stone gate lies the Alchemical Well, and a twin-trunked tree with intertwined roots. There is also a stone chime, its sound clear and resonant, and medicinal herbs and bitter bamboo that once grew in the mountain valleys—all remnants of his presence.

In the first year of the Taiji era of Empress Wu Zetian of the Tang, a grand offering was held at the abbey, where black dragons and flocks of cranes appeared as omens. An imperial decree praised and honored him, and the records were entrusted to the official archives.

On the first day of the seventh month of the first year of the Xuanhe era of Emperor Huizong of the Song, he was posthumously enfeoffed as the Perfected One of Cinnabar Primordial. The edict read: “We consider the lofty recluses of antiquity—those whose names endure but whose titles remain unbestowed—and deliberate how to posthumously honor them. The Master of Simplicity and Seclusion, Lu Xiujing, attained perfection within, corrected the lost scriptures, and established standards for his age, transcending the world in an instant. His former retreat on Mount Lu has long had a shrine, and now, after verifying the facts, We bestow upon him the title of Perfected One. This is not merely to honor his past footsteps but also to inspire those who hear of him to recognize where the Dao resides and to strive accordingly.”

Let him be specially enfeoffed as the Perfected One of Cinnabar Primordial.

Lu Xiujing passed away during the Yuanhui era of the Song, yet *The Comprehensive Mirror of Buddhist History* records: “In the first year of Shaotai of Emperor Jing of Liang, the Daoist Lu Xiujing and others, having been cast aside by Emperor Wu of Liang, fled to Wei. By then, their followers had grown numerous. When Emperor of Qi embraced Buddhism, Xiujing and his disciples, resenting this, petitioned the court to debate the Dharma with the Buddhist monks.” However, when one examines the chronology, the Yuanhui era lies more than sixty years after Shaotai—how could such an account not be erroneous?

Master Sun Youyue, whose surname was Sun and given name Youyue, styled Yingda, was a descendant of the House of Wu of Dongyang. From childhood, he was reverent; in maturity, he was harmonious. His stillness was like an abyss; his qi was like spring. He sifted the common and refined the divine, plumbing the subtle and obscure. Once, he wandered to the Crimson Pine Gorge and the Cloud-Wrapped Hall of Mount Jinyun, where he divined a site for his final repose.

During the Taichu era of Emperor Wen of Song, when Master of Simplicity and Seclusion [Lu Xiujing] arrived at Mount Lu, Youyue presented himself as a disciple and received the scriptures and methods of the Three Caverns, along with the ink traces of the Two Perfected Ones, Yang and Xu. Thereafter, he subsisted on fungi and abstained from grains, later devoting himself solely to the Elixir of Grain Transcendence. At sixty-seven, his complexion remained radiant, and with time, he grew ever younger.

After Master of Simplicity and Seclusion ascended as a feathered transcendent, Youyue returned to his former retreat to delve into the true essence of the Dao. In the second year of Yongming of Emperor Wu of Qi, he was summoned to preside over the Xingshi Abbey. Thereupon, extraordinary and reclusive scholars vied to gather around him, including Kong Dezhang and Liu Xiaobiao, who formed bonds beyond the mundane world. Though he often petitioned to return home on grounds of illness, the imperial decree never permitted it. In the fifth month of the seventh year, he suddenly bathed, sat in repose, and passed away. His disciples numbered in the hundreds, but only Tao Hongjing was deemed an inner-chamber successor. To him, Youyue entrusted the Three Caverns scriptures and the ink traces of Yang and Xu, emptying his baskets in full.

Later, Hongjing compiled *Declarations of the Perfected*, which circulated in the world.

Tao Hongjing, the Recluse Master, whose surname was Tao and given name Hongjing, styled Tongming, was a native of Danyang. His residence lay east of the southern ridge of White Poplar Lane. When the Song dynasty first implemented the *tuduan* land registration, his household was assigned to Tongxia Ward in the western precinct of Moling County, where his descendants have resided ever since.

The Tao clan originally hailed from Pingyang in Jizhou, descendants of the sage-king Yao of the House of Tao Tang. As Yao governed Pingyang in Jizhou, his lineage settled there. When the Han arose, Tao She served as Marshal to Emperor Gaozu, and his son Qing rose to the rank of Chancellor. Their thirteenth-generation ancestor, Tao Chao, crossed the Yangtze at the end of the Han and first settled in Danyang.

Their seventh-generation ancestor, Tao Jun, was the younger brother of Tao Huang, Inspector of Jiaozhou. He served the state of Wu as General Who Pacifies the South, was enfeoffed as Marquis of Jurong with a fief of two thousand households, and, along with Sun Hao, surrendered to Jin. He was appointed Gentleman Consultant, Cavalier Attendant-in-Ordinary, and Master of Writing.

Their sixth-generation ancestor, Tao Mo, was the third son of Jun. During the Yongjia era of Emperor Huai, he served as Marshal to the Prince of Donghai, Sima Yue, commanding garrison troops and following the prince to Xuchang. After their defeat, he returned south of the Yangtze and became a military advisor to the Grand General Wang Dun. When Dun was appointed Chancellor, Mo was transferred to Military Consultant and Libationer. Later, he accompanied Dun on his southern campaign but, fearing the disaster to come, petitioned to sever his clan registry and was confined for many years. In his later years, he was appointed Military Advisor to the General of Chariots and Cavalry but declined the post. He died in the fourth year of the Shengping era of Emperor Mu and was buried separately on the northern slope of Mount Baishi, overlooking the lake.

Their great-grandfather, Tao Pi, was discerning in judgment and possessed a lofty and extraordinary bearing. Though demoted for his literary pursuits, he refused to seek office, declining all summons from the prefecture and commandery. Later, he was selected as an aide to the Governor of Nan’an but never assumed the post. He died in the third year of the Yuanxing era of Emperor An.

Their grandfather, Tao Long, stood seven *chi* and five *cun* tall, with a handsome appearance, great strength, and skill in riding and archery. He loved learning, was adept at calligraphy, and also understood the properties of medicines, often dedicating himself to healing and rescue. He served as a military advisor to the General of the South.

Accompanying Emperor Xiaowu of Song on his campaign against the rebels, he rendered meritorious service and was enfeoffed as Marquis of Jin’an, appointed as a principal aide, but firmly declined. Yan Jun, relying on imperial favor, sought to exchange his residence for a Buddhist temple, but he refused. Consequently, he resigned from office, was secretly stripped of his title, and exiled to Guangzhou. Later, by imperial grace, he was appointed Magistrate of Xiping County in Nanhai and subsequently served as Supervisor of Xinhui Commandery, where he died in the fifth year of the Daming era of Emperor Xiaowu of Song.

His father, named Zhenbao, styled Guozhong, was summoned by Liu Tiren, Prince Jian’an and Minister of Education, to serve as Gentleman Attendant, then promoted to Gentleman Attendant of the Southern Bureau, and appointed Chancellor of Xiaochang in Jiangxia. He was also skilled in riding and archery, and excelled in clerical and official script. Though his family was poor, he made a living by copying sutras, earning forty coins per sheet. His calligraphy followed the styles of Yang Xin and Xiao Sihua. Deeply versed in medical arts and widely read in the classics and histories, he was fond of literature and possessed a dignified bearing. In his social circles, he associated with Xiao Sihua, Wang Zhao, and Liu Bing, and was highly esteemed by the nobility. In the winter of the fourth year of the Yuanyuan era of Emperor Cangwu, he was dispatched as an envoy to the northern court to foster amicable relations with neighboring states, earning widespread acclaim. In the first year of the Shengming era of Emperor Shundi, he returned to the capital and compiled an account of his travels, along with several thousand characters of poetry and other writings. Liu Bing requested to read them, but they were lost during the Stone Fortress affair, with no other copies surviving, and thus did not circulate in later generations.

Previously, Zhenbao had relocated his family to Yingzhou with Xiao, and in the second year of the Xiaojian era of Emperor Wu of Song, Xiao perished. That September, his mother realized she was with child and dreamed of a small azure dragon emerging from her body, ascending straight toward the east. Upon waking, she looked but could not see its tail. (*The History of the Southern Dynasties* states: His mother, née Hao, dreamed of two celestial beings holding incense burners approaching her, after which she conceived. Tang scholar Li Bo’s account records: His mother, early in her pregnancy, dreamed of the essence of the sun within her womb, and two celestial beings descending with golden censers. Upon waking, she confided to her attendants: "I shall bear a son, no ordinary man, though I fear he may have no posterity." At the time, she was twenty-five.) That winter, she returned to the capital with Xiao’s troops, residing in the eastern quarters near the archery hall among the left encampments.

On the thirtieth day of the fourth month of the *bingshen* year of the Xiaojian era—with that year having an intercalary third month, and the following dawn marking the Summer Solstice—the Master was born at midnight. At birth, his countenance was luminous and refined, his eyes bright and brows well-spaced, his frame slender, his forehead broad, and his ears prominent. On his right knee were several dozen dark moles arranged in the pattern of the Seven Stars. From childhood, he was perceptive and quick-witted, and as he matured, his learning became vast and profound. At four or five, he took to books, and even now, examples of his writing from the age of six survive, already composed with proper structure. By nine, he began reciting the Six Classics and delved into composition. At ten, upon obtaining *The Biographies of Divine Immortals* by Ge Hong, he studied it day and night, nurturing aspirations for cultivating longevity. He remarked to others: "Gazing at the azure clouds and beholding the white sun, I feel no distance is beyond reach." He read over ten thousand volumes, and any subject he did not know he deemed a deep shame. Skilled in the qin and chess, he also mastered cursive and clerical scripts.

At eleven, he became a tutor to Liu Hao, son of Wang Zhao, Left Chief of the Minister of Education. At thirteen, his father relocated the household, following Liu Bing, Minister of Personnel, to Huainan Commandery. At fifteen, he returned to the capital, lodging temporarily in the outer barracks behind the armory, then established a separate residence, never again returning to his former home. At seventeen, he underwent the capping ceremony. He often accompanied Liu Bing, who governed Danyang Commandery, receiving provisions from the household guard and riding a subordinate’s horse when traveling. Liu Bing’s second son, Si, was renowned from a young age and served as Sacrificial Wine Officer of the Minister of Education. Si had a refined appreciation for literature and spent days and nights searching for texts with the Master, often sharing meals and traveling together in the same carriage. Si, along with Jiang Shu, Chu Xuan, and Liu Si, were known as the Four Companions of Emperor Shundi, and Si was particularly celebrated for his talent and learning. He composed *Eulogies on the Virtues of Song*, a series of seven *lianju* poems, which were hailed as unparalleled in his time. After Si’s death, his writings scattered, and though the Master wished to compile them, he was ultimately unable to do so.

In the winter of the first year of the Shengming era, at the age of twenty-two, the Master followed Liu Bing into Stone Fortress to join Yuan Ji’s cause. The Master, along with Han Bin and Mi Tan, was responsible for drafting official documents. When the affair failed and the fortress fell, he managed to escape. Si and his younger brother Gai fled disguised as Buddhist monks but were captured and died in the prison of Jiankang. None dared approach their bodies, but the Master personally gathered and buried them, interring them in an old family grave. After arranging everything, he renounced the world and retreated into the mountains. Amid the transition from Song to Qi, the realm remained unsettled. Having been allied with the Liu clan, he harbored deep apprehensions. His father, through Ji Sengzhen, sought service under Emperor Gao of Qi at Xinting and was accepted as a retainer. In the second month, after Shen Youzhi’s rebellion was quelled, he returned to the eastern quarters with the emperor. The emperor then dispatched envoys to instruct his younger brothers, the fifth son Hua and the sixth son Gui, in their studies, while also assisting the emperor with official correspondence.

The Master, then twenty-three, was appointed Gentleman Attendant to the Prince of Baling. He remarked: "In times of dynastic change, even modest contributions merit a rank or two. Why should there be no place for me?" Thus, he declined the appointment. The following year, he accompanied the Prince of Ancheng to garrison Stone Fortress. The next summer, he observed the mourning rites for his father, Chancellor of Xiaochang. (*The History of the Southern Dynasties* states: Before reaching adulthood, Emperor Gao of Qi, then serving as regent, summoned him as a tutor to the imperial princes and appointed him Gentleman for Court Audiences. Though within the imperial gates, he kept to himself, avoiding external affairs and devoting himself solely to reading. His opinions on court precedents were often adopted as standards.)

Upon Emperor Wu’s ascension, he was appointed General of Vibrant Might and assigned as tutor to the Prince of Yidu. During the Qi dynasty, the role of imperial tutor entailed overseeing all matters of the secretariat, requiring individuals of exceptional talent. The Master excelled in all ceremonial and administrative documents, from auspicious and inauspicious rites to internal and external protocols, as well as memorials, memorialized reports, and official correspondence, surpassing all others.

Several princes’ document clerks took his writings as models for drafting, and many imperial tutors grew envious and resentful. The Master paid no heed, remaining untroubled. At twenty-eight, upon completing his mourning period, he was appointed General of the Left Guard and Palace Attendant, much to the satisfaction of contemporary expectations. The Master, however, was taken aback, unable to fathom the reason. He confided in Yu Daomin, discussing those who had been overlooked. Yu then petitioned Emperor Wu in person, to which the emperor replied, “This office was personally bestowed by the late emperor—did you not know? How can it be declined?” Yu relayed this to the Master, who sighed deeply and said, “Five years ago, I declined the position of Gentleman Attendant to the Prince of Yuzhang, yet now I am given this post. A post horse is no steed of swift flight.” He wished to firmly decline, but Yu pressed him, saying, “Since the founding of the dynasty, this office has always been held by men of renown, such as Pei Songzhi, who advanced from it to Gentleman Attendant. If the man fits the office, what wrong is done to you? I fear you may hinder my affairs.” At the time, he was entrusted with overseeing all matters of the princes’ households, and thus, with no alternative, he accepted the appointment.

At twenty-nine, when the new Clear Stream Palace was completed, the emperor celebrated with feasting. The Master submitted a memorial and presented an ode, while Fu Manrong also offered a rhapsody. Thereupon, the emperor instructed the Palace Secretary Liu Xi to issue an edict, praising both works and urging the preservation of the old palace’s bronze and stone inscriptions. The emperor intended to have the Master’s ode engraved on a stele, but Wang Jian opposed the idea, and it was abandoned. Among the five who presented rhapsodies, the Master’s was deemed the finest. Promotion was imminent when he was bereaved by his mother’s death and left office. Soon after, he was reappointed General of Vibrant Might. Upon his return to service, he was specially granted wine and food, and his salary was adjusted to accompany the Prince of Yidu to the capital. When the emperor planned to visit the Wujin Palace, the Master composed another ode. Though the ode was completed, the imperial procession was canceled, and it was never presented. It was said, “This ode’s style is surpassingly fresh, far exceeding the old forms.”

After three years, he returned to the capital and was appointed Gentleman for Court Audiences. Displeased with the appointment, he wrote to his cousin, “In official service, one should decide based on one’s health. I had hoped to become a Gentleman Attendant around forty, then serve as magistrate of a reputable eastern Zhe county, where I might enjoy the mountains and waters before retiring to lofty reclusion. These long-held aspirations now seem as clear as the palm of my hand. Yet at thirty-six, I am only appointed Gentleman for Court Audiences—what does this portend for my future? Better to leave early than to endure such humiliation.” The following May, he submitted a memorial to resign, seeking refuge in the mountains and forests. Thus began his aspirations for the azure clouds.

That year was the eleventh of Emperor Wu’s Yongming reign, the *ren-shen* year. When the Master first withdrew, he did not wish to formally resign from the court. Instead, he removed his official robes and hung them at the Divine Tiger Gate. Donning a deer-fur cap, he departed directly from the Eastern Pavilion, instructing his attendants, “Let no one know of this.” He then bid farewell to Wang Yan, who cautioned, “His Majesty is most severe in governance and does not permit eccentric conduct. If you act contrary to his wishes, you may incur blame. How then can your aspirations be fulfilled?” The Master pondered in silence for a long while before replying, “I follow my own resolve, not for fame. If such concerns arise, what is there to be done?” Thereupon, he did not return to the court but submitted a memorial expressing his sincerity. (*The History of the Southern Dynasties* states: In the tenth year of Yongming, he removed his official robes at the Divine Martial Gate and submitted a memorial to resign his salary.) An edict granted him ten bolts of silk, twenty torches of wax, and a monthly allotment of five *jin* of *fuling* and two *sheng* of white honey for his medicinal regimen.

Having fulfilled his wish, he ordered a small boat prepared and descended the river. The court officials and nobles saw him off at the Zhenlu Pavilion with lavish provisions, carriages, and horses crowding the roads. All remarked, “Nothing like this has been seen east of the Yangtze in recent times—until today.” He then settled on Mount Gouqu in Jurong. The Master said, “This mountain is the Grotto Palace of Jintan, encircling a hundred and fifty *li*, known as the Heaven of Huayang. It houses the offices of the Three Mao Lords of Destiny, hence its name, Maoshan.” There, he established a retreat, styling himself the Recluse of Huayang, much like Shi’an of Xuanyan or Zichuan of Baopu. In all his letters and documents, he used this name in place of his own.

The Master was well-versed in antiquity, expounding the Seven Classics with comprehensive understanding of their great principles, yet he disliked establishing doctrines at odds with earlier scholars’ discussions. He preferred writing to oral debate. He was particularly fond of the Five Phases and yin-yang, divination by wind and celestial omens, the *Taiyi* and *Dunjia* systems, astrology, calendrical calculations, geography, the products of various regions, medical prescriptions, the blending of incense and herbs, and the classification of insects, birds, plants, and trees—mastering all these subjects without omission. His clerical script was unlike conventional styles, forming a distinct school with vigorous and elegant strokes. He was also skilled in the qin, chess, archery, and horsemanship.

By nature, he was adaptable and modest, his mind a mirror that comprehended all it encountered, perceiving things with clarity. His speech was free of confusion, and if errors arose, he corrected them at once. He was seldom sorrowful or envious, indifferent to joy and anger, and untroubled by grief or delight.

In the *jia-zi*, *yi-chou*, and *bing-yin* years, he studied Daoist talismans and scriptures under Sun Youyue, master of the Xingshi Lodge in the Eastern Yang. Though the transmitted texts were authentic, repeated copying had introduced discrepancies. He thus sought widely to correct them. In the *wu-chen* year, he first journeyed to Maoshan, where he obtained the authentic handwritten texts of Yang and Xu, filling him with joy and inspiration. By the *geng-wu* year, he requested leave to travel through Zhe and Yue, seeking spiritual wonders in every place. He visited the recluse Lou Huiming at Great Flood Mountain in Kuaiji, the recluse Du Jingchan at Taiping Mountain in Yuyao, and the master Zhong Yishan at Chaoshan in Shining. He also traveled to Mount Tiantai in Shifeng, meeting the monk Zhu Sengbiao and various senior Daoists, acquiring over ten volumes of the Perfected Ones’ posthumous writings.

Having traveled through mountains and rivers for over two hundred days, he then returned. From there, he journeyed to Changshan in Dongyang, Tianmu Mountain in Wuxing, and all the renowned peaks of Yuqian, Linhai, and Angu, leaving none unvisited. His body was naturally lithe and agile, making ascents effortless—*The History of the Southern Dynasties* records: "He traversed famous mountains in search of immortal herbs. Light and nimble in body, he was by nature drawn to landscapes." Whenever he passed through ravines or valleys, he would sit or lie among them, chanting verses and lingering, unable to tear himself away.

To his disciples he remarked: "I see vermilion gates and vast halls, and though I recognize their splendor and joy, I feel no desire to enter them. Gazing upon towering cliffs or vast marshes, I know such places are hard to dwell in, yet I cannot help but yearn to approach them." He took pity on those who lived in cold and solitude, aiding those in peril or distress, healing the sick and ailing, tireless from dawn to dusk. Beyond these acts, he bestowed hidden kindnesses and secret favors, known to none.

Even when borrowing others’ books, he would correct errors as he read. In the early years of Emperor Yongyuan of the Qi dynasty’s reign, he had a three-story tower constructed. He resided at the top, his disciples in the middle, and guests below, thus cutting himself off from the world. Only a single servant was permitted to attend him. Though once skilled in horsemanship and archery, he abandoned both in later years, content only to listen to the sound of the *sheng*. He had a particular fondness for the wind in the pines, planting them throughout his courtyard; whenever he heard their rustling, he would rejoice in delight. At times, wandering alone among springs and rocks, those who glimpsed him took him for an immortal.

By nature, he loved writing and cherished the strange and wondrous. He treasured every moment of light and scenery, a devotion that only deepened with age.

He was particularly versed in yin-yang and the Five Phases, divination by wind and stars, astrological calculations, the geography of mountains and rivers, the products of various regions, medical arts and pharmacology, and the chronology of imperial dynasties. Through calculation, he determined that in the second year of the Han dynasty’s Xiping reign (173 CE), the winter solstice occurred at noon on the *dingchou* day, whereas the true *xiantian* calendar placed it at midnight on the *yihai* day—thirty-eight *ke* earlier—meaning the Han calendar lagged two days and twelve *ke* behind. He also constructed a *huntian* celestial model, roughly three *chi* in height, with the earth at its center and the heavens revolving around it while the earth remained still. The twenty-eight lunar mansions, their degrees, and the paths of the seven luminaries were all clearly marked, as were the rising and setting of the central stars. When turned by mechanism at dawn or dusk, it aligned perfectly with the heavens. He remarked, "This is essential for cultivating the Dao, not merely a tool for court astronomers." He further sought to create a natural water clock, using flowing water to drive a twelve-hour wheel in perpetual motion without need for supervision. However, he worried that mountain streams would accumulate moss and sediment, causing irregularities, and so the project remained unrealized.

In his movements and bearing, he was light and agile, his countenance gentle and radiant, never stern or severe. Young and old alike took joy in his presence and were drawn to him, yet all held him in awe and reverence. His disciples gathered around him, attending with reverence as if in a palace hall. From childhood, he kept a distance from others, and after a few years, he no longer shared bowls or chopsticks when eating. As he grew older, whether traveling, lodging, or resting, he remained composed, never engaging in jest or idle talk. He eschewed all worldly frivolity. His spirit was strong and unyielding; he walked alone at night and slept in solitude without fear. He deeply admired Zhang Liang, declaring no ancient worthy could compare. Unburdened by worldly concerns, he moved with the lightness of clouds and mist. All his practices arose from his own insight, beyond the reach of ordinary understanding.

In the second year of Yongyuan (500 CE), he withdrew into seclusion as dusk approached. When Emperor Wu of Liang rose to power and deliberated on the new dynasty’s name, the Master cited various prophecies and omens, showing that "Liang" was the destined sign. He also selected an auspicious day for the suburban sacrifice, and its efficacy was manifest. The emperor urged him to enter the mountains and sent envoys with gifts in gratitude. Having long been acquainted with the Master, the emperor, after ascending the throne, treated him with even greater favor, sending letters and inquiries without cease, so that carriages and officials were constantly seen at his door. After receiving his esoteric teachings, the emperor believed the elixir of immortality could be achieved but lamented the lack of ingredients, which the emperor then provided. Whenever the emperor received his writings, he burned incense and reverently accepted them.

The emperor commissioned him to create a new calendar, marking the *jisi* year (549 CE) with a red dot—this was the third year of Taiqing. The emperor personally summoned him with a handwritten decree and bestowed upon him a deerskin cap. Despite repeated summons and honors, the Master responded by drawing two oxen: one roaming freely among water and grass, the other adorned with a golden bridle, led by a man holding a rope and driven by a staff. The emperor laughed and said, "This man seeks nothing; he wishes to be like the tortoise dragging its tail in the mud. How could he be compelled to come?" Yet on matters of state, the emperor consulted him without fail, and contemporaries called him the "Prime Minister of the Mountains."

In the fourth year of Tianjian (505 CE), he moved to Jijin Ravine. Practicing breath abstention and guiding *qi* through *daoyin* exercises, he lived in seclusion for over forty years, yet at eighty, his appearance remained robust. In the early Datong era (527 CE), he presented two blades, one named *Shansheng* ("Excellent Victory") and the other *Chengsheng* ("Perfect Victory"), both prized treasures. In the second year of Datong (536 CE), he announced the day of his passing. At eighty-five, his complexion remained unchanged, his limbs supple as ever, and the fragrance in his chamber lingered for days.

A decree was issued posthumously appointing him Gentleman Cavalier Attendant and conferring the posthumous title *Master Zhenbai* ("Pure and White"). An emissary was dispatched to oversee his funeral rites. Among his dozens of disciples, only Wang Yuanzhi was deemed his foremost successor.

Master Hongjing possessed profound mastery of numerology and divination, foreseeing the fall of the Liang dynasty. He composed a poem in advance, which read:
*"Yifu indulged in idle abandon,
Pingshu sat discoursing on emptiness.
Who would have thought the Hall of Zhaoyang
Would transform into the Khan’s palace?"*
The poem remained hidden in a basket until after his passing, when his disciples gradually revealed it.

By the late Datong era, scholars vied to expound on metaphysical principles, neglecting martial affairs. Later, when Hou Jing usurped the throne, it indeed occurred in the Hall of Zhaoyang. His writings included *Academy of Learning* in one hundred fascicles, *Collected Annotations on the Classic of Filial Piety and the Analects*, *Imperial Chronology*, *Collected Annotations on the Materia Medica*, *Proven Remedies*, *One Hundred and One Emergency Prescriptions from Behind the Elbow*, *Records of Ancient and Modern Prefectures and Commanderies*, *Essential Illustrated Compendium*, *Jade Casket Records*, *New and Old Seven Luminaries*, *Commentaries on Numerology and Astrology*, and *Formulae for Alchemical Elixirs*. The esoteric portions of these works were not transmitted, and ten additional unfinished treatises were accessible only to his disciples.

In *The Golden Tower Master*, Emperor Liang remarked: *"Among recluses, I esteem Tao Hongjing; among scholar-officials, I esteem Zhou Hongzheng."* His grasp of principle and meaning was inexhaustibly profound—truly a paragon of his age.

Ma Shu, in *Transmission of the Dao*, recorded: *"Tao Hongjing was invested as the Celestial Overseer of Penglai."* Much of the foregoing account aligns with *The History of the Southern Dynasties*.

Minister Dao Yi observed: *"The* Dao De Jing *states: ‘Govern the state with uprightness, deploy troops with cunning, and win the world through non-interference.’ It further declares: ‘Weapons are inauspicious tools, not instruments for the noble. When their use is unavoidable, restraint is paramount. To triumph and then glorify it is to delight in slaughter. Those who delight in slaughter shall never prevail under heaven.’*

*Laozi’s intent was to restore the customs of high antiquity—of Fuxi, the Yellow Emperor, Tang, and Yu—emphasizing substance over ostentation, ensuring rulers and ministers alike shunned sensual indulgence and extravagance to cultivate a transformation of tranquility. Thus, they would avoid the exhaustion of warfare and preserve the governance of non-action. Yet later generations, failing to grasp his essence, mistook idle discourse and reckless abandon for profundity. Some administrations erred toward leniency, obscuring rewards and punishments; others succumbed to indolence, neglecting diligence and reverence; still others faltered in carelessness, ignoring precision and subtlety; or relied on talent while growing arrogant and negligent. These corruptions were manifold, culminating in the catastrophic failures of the Jin dynasty’s rulers and ministers.*

*In later times, some even lectured on the* Dao De Jing *while preparing for battle. By then, Laozi’s Way had been defiled. Had those who truly understood his teachings acted thus?*

*Tao Hongjing lived through turbulent times, dwelling in reclusion among the mountains. Observing the flaws of court governance, he wrote:*
*‘Yifu indulged in idle abandon,
Pingshu sat discoursing on emptiness.
Who would have thought the Hall of Zhaoyang
Would transform into the Khan’s palace?’*

*Emperor Wu of Liang governed the realm through Buddhist teachings, and his ministers likewise competed in metaphysical discourse, leading to misguided policies and neglected defenses, gradually culminating in the dynasty’s ruin. Thus, Hongjing’s poem alluded to this. As a scholar of Laozi’s Way, those who later studied it and entered officialdom should deeply ponder its meaning."*

Here ends *Volume Twenty-Four of the Comprehensive Mirror of Perfected Immortals Who Embodied the Dao Through the Ages*.
*Volume Twenty-Five of the Comprehensive Mirror of Perfected Immortals Who Embodied the Dao Through the Ages* begins.

**Wang Yuanzhi**

The Daoist Wang Yuanzhi of Langye was the son of Tan Shou, Regional Inspector of Yangzhou under the Chen. His maternal grandfather, Ding Chao, served as Gentleman of the Palace Carriages under the Liang. His mother conceived him after dreaming of a divine phoenix. The monk Baoji declared, “The child she bears shall become a patriarch of divine transcendents.”

At seven, he could recite ten thousand words a day, mastering all books with profound comprehension of the supreme Dao. At fifteen, he entered Huayang to study under Master Tao Zhenbai, receiving the Three Caverns’ teachings. He also followed Master Zang Jin of the Zong Dao lineage, inheriting esoteric oral instructions.

The Chen sovereign summoned him to Chongyang Hall, honoring him with exceptional courtesy, bestowing gifts and provisions before sending him back to Mount Mao. There, on the northwest ridge, he built a quiet chamber to dwell in, delving into the mysteries of the arcane.

In the final years of Emperor Xuan of Chen’s reign, a divine being suddenly appeared in his chamber, drunk and vomiting. Yuanzhi lit incense and paid homage. The spirit said, “I am bound for Mount Tiantai—can you accompany me?” Yuanzhi followed him out and ascended the ridge. Midway up the mountain, he recalled that he had not entrusted his scriptures to two or three disciples. After retreating a dozen paces to look back, he saw the spirit transform into a crane and fly away.

When Prince Guang of Jin, later the Duke of Yang, governed Yangzhou, his ministers Liu and Gu successively invited Yuanzhi. Upon arrival, his hair and beard suddenly turned white in an instant. Alarmed, the prince sent him back, and shortly after, his appearance returned to normal.

After ascending the throne, the prince dispatched Cui Feng to summon him. The emperor personally received him as a disciple. In Jiangdu, a Jade Clarity Abbey was built to house him, and he was appointed to succeed Master Yue as preceptor.

During the time when the future Tang Gaozu was still in obscurity, Yuanzhi secretly revealed to him the celestial mandate. Prince Qin (later Taizong) and Fang Xuanling visited him in plain clothes. Yuanzhi greeted them, saying, “A sage is among you.” When Prince Qin pressed him to reveal the truth, he replied, “You shall become the Emperor of Great Peace—cherish yourself.” Prince Qin then received the Three Caverns’ teachings from him.

Upon ascending the throne, Gaozu sought to bestow high office upon him, but Yuanzhi firmly declined and returned to the mountains. In the ninth year of Zhenguan, Taizong established the Taiping Abbey in Runzhou on Mount Mao and ordained seven disciples. He sent an imperial edict, saying:

*“When I was still a prince, I early had the fortune to seek your teachings. Your noble bearing remains ever present in my waking and dreaming thoughts. Recently, upon reading your memorial requesting to return to your former mountain retreat, I have issued a separate decree to honor your lofty aspirations. The abbey I have ordered built shall serve as a testament to my enduring devotion.”*

Yuanzhi’s vital essence was vast and his mind empty; his speech and silence were as one. His illumination was like a mirror, responding to all things without partiality.

There was a man named Dou Deglun who, having previously passed through Yangzhou, encountered an emissary of the Controller of Destiny. The emissary told him he was destined for high office but would die at the age of eighty-one. Deglun pleaded for mercy, and the emissary said, “The Perfected One, Wang, the Dharma Master, is the Immortal Elder of Shaoshi. He oversees the records of humans and spirits and submits memorials to the celestial bureaus, which are always promptly answered.” Deglun then earnestly entreated Yuanzhi, who, though reluctant, interceded on his behalf. The emissary reported back, “His life shall be extended by thirteen years.” During the reign of Gaozong, Deglun served as Left Chancellor and died at the appointed time—all as foretold. Thus, the world came to call Yuanzhi the “Dharma Master.”

He later learned that he had been appointed to an immortal office. He told Pan Shizheng, “Yesterday, I saw the celestial register. Due to a childhood mistake—injuring a boy’s lip—I was denied ascension to heaven in broad daylight. Instead, I was appointed Immortal Elder of Shaoshi, with a near-term assignment.” The next day, he bathed, donned his cap and robes, burned incense, and lay down to pass away in meditation at the age of one hundred and twenty-one.

Pan Shizheng and Xu Daomiao both received his esoteric instructions and became his foremost disciples. Chen Yu and Wang Gui followed next, while others dwelled in grotto-heavens, never wavering in their practice for the rest of their lives.

In the second year of Tiaolu, Gaozong posthumously granted him the title of Grand Master for Thorough Counsel and the posthumous name Master Shengxuan. He also ordered the establishment of the Taiping Abbey and the ordination of forty-nine Daoists. At the beginning of Empress Wu’s reign, he was further posthumously honored as Grand Master of the Palace with Gold and Purple and his posthumous name was changed to Master Shengzhen.

During the Tianbao era of Emperor Ming, he urged Li Hanguang to build a portrait hall at the Taiping Abbey, where his likeness was painted to commemorate his immortal legacy.

Another account states that Yuanzhi was skilled in the *Book of Changes* and could foretell life, death, fortune, and misfortune. He authored the *Comprehensive Commentary on the Changes* in fifteen scrolls. One day, amid thunder, rain, and mist, an elder rebuked him, saying, “Where are the books you have divulged? The Celestial Emperor has commanded me to dispatch the Six Ding spirits and thunderbolts to retrieve them.” Terrified, Yuanzhi prostrated himself upon the ground. Beside him stood six attendants in black, already holding the books. The elder scolded him, “The celestial realm forbids such texts. They are guarded by flying immortals, and their golden precepts are hidden in the Mystic Capital. How dare you secretly keep such records?” Yuanzhi replied, “The Elder of Qingxi transmitted them to me.” The elder said, “The Celestial Emperor has shown mercy. Your immortal rank is now assured, and your ordination is deferred by four years—a span of two cycles.” After Yuanzhi’s passing, a traveler crossing the sea was blown off course by the wind. Suddenly, a leaf-like boat appeared from the horizon—it was Yuanzhi. He said, “Why have you endured such peril? This is the eastern edge of the vast ocean, a hundred thousand *li* away. With a swift wind, you may reach Dengzhou in a single night.” After he departed, the boat flew like a feather, the wind howling behind. By the next day, the traveler indeed arrived at Dengzhou.

**Wang Gui**

The Daoist Wang Gui, styled Hongfan, was a native of Linyi. His great-grandfather, Jun, served as Cavalier Attendant-in-Ordinary, Minister of the Palace Treasury, and Minister of Revenue under the Liang. His grandfather, Ku, was Gentleman of the Palace Washbasin and General Who Summons the Distant for Emperor Jianwen’s Crown Prince.

His father, Yu, served as Editorial Director and Regular Attendant to the Prince of Poyang under the Chen. At twenty, Gui became a disciple of his master Wang Yuanzhi, observing the rites of the towel and water vessel for sixteen years. Whenever he sat beneath his master to hear the *Dao De Jing*, *Scripture of Western Ascension*, *Lingbao* scriptures, and *Nanhua* sutras, he would later expound their meanings in detail to others. He also transcribed the revered methods of *Shangqing*, the talismans and secret treasures of *Dongxuan* and *Dongshen*, sealing them in a stone chamber to guard the mountains and peaks. He consumed the resin of the *zhun* pine and *song* pine, a practice he maintained for many years. In his teachings and transmissions, he prioritized the creation of sacred images and aiding those in urgent need.

Emperor Taizong of Tang, knowing his reputation, frequently consulted him on the essentials of the Dao. On the first day of the eleventh month in the second year of Qianfeng under Emperor Gaozong, he said to his disciples: “Last night, I dreamed of three figures in feathered robes, each holding a tablet. The first said: ‘The Celestial Official of Huayang has been appointed by the Divine Immortals as their master, and will also oversee the review and administration of celestial offices.’ Long ago, on Mount Tongbai, I had this same dream, but declined the summons. Now it has returned—my departure must be near.” He instructed his disciples on the essentials of cultivating the Dao, entrusting each with scriptures and secret teachings. On the eighth day, he bathed and dressed in ceremonial robes. The following day, he sat in a bamboo chair and transformed. When they prepared to enshroud him, only his empty garments and tied sash remained. He was eighty-eight years old. Yu Xinzhi of Henan later inscribed a stele at Huayang Cave.

**Pan Shizheng**

The Daoist Pan Shizheng, styled Zizhen, was a native of Zongcheng in Beizhou. His grandfather, Chang, served as Prefect of Chuzhou under the Zhou, and his father, Kuan, as Prefect of Tongzhou under the Sui. His mother, née Lu, was skilled in discourse on names and principles. At Shizheng’s birth, a radiant light filled the room.

The neighbor’s mother, skilled in physiognomy, declared, “This child will either become an immortal or attain high rank.” When he could speak, he was taught the Six Classics and mastered them all. One day, he asked, “Beyond these books, is there anything greater?” His mother replied, “Only the *Five Thousand Characters of the Dao and Its Virtue*.” He then recited it.

When his mother fell gravely ill, she said to Shizheng, “Death is the great appointed end for all; when the time comes, one must go. What regret could I have? Yet you are still young, and I cannot help but worry for you.” Shizheng, weeping blood, clasped her hand and said, “If heaven takes your kind face from me, I will not live on.” His mother replied, “If you destroy yourself, that would not be true filial piety from beginning to end.” After a long collapse, Shizheng revived and said, “Though I endure life against my will, I shall fast and follow the Dao, hoping to rely on the true teaching as my bridge.” His mother stroked his head and encouraged him.

After the burial, he built a hut by her grave and became renowned for his filial devotion. During the *Daye* era of Emperor Yang of Sui, the Daoist Liu Aidao saw him and esteemed him, saying, “The steed of the Three Clarities—who but you could ride it?” At the time, Wang Yuanzhi of Mount Mao was favored by Emperor Yang, who often summoned him to the palace to offer pine and spring water for blessings. Aidao said to Shizheng, “It is not that I do not wish to keep you with me, but to accomplish the work of the Dao, none but Yuanzhi will do.” When Yuanzhi met him, he exclaimed to Aidao, “Today, another immortal Pan has appeared—how fortunate for my teaching!” Thus, Shizheng was registered among the Daoist clergy and received the hidden scriptures and true texts of the Three Caverns.

Soon after, Yuanzhi requested to return to Mount Mao, and Shizheng accompanied him. While crossing the Yangzi River, he drank foul water and suffered dysentery so severe his stool resembled congealed fat. Then he dreamed of a man in dazzling white robes descending from the sky, who gave him a white pill. Upon waking, he was cured.

Upon arrival, Yuanzhi said, “Though I wish to keep you here, Mount Songyang is your destined place for cultivating the true Dao. You must return at once.” There, he lived with Liu Aidao on the summit of Double Springs for over twenty years, later building a hut in Xiaoyao Valley. His sustenance was only the water of green pines and mountain streams. He purified his heart and forgot his form, becoming one with the grasses and trees. The scriptures and methods he practiced included three of the Great Clarity, six of the Middle Perfection, and eight of the Lower Perfection.

Emperor Gaozong of Tang, visiting the eastern capital, summoned him and requested talismanic writing, but Shizheng declined, saying he did not know it. The emperor then asked what he needed in the mountains. Shizheng replied, “Lush pines and clear springs are all I require, and this mountain has them in abundance.” The emperor, struck by his words, did not detain him but instead built Chongtang Abbey and Fengtian Palace at his dwelling. He also ordered a gate built at Xiaoyao Valley, naming the southern side “Weary of Wandering” and the northern “Seeking the True.” When the Court of Imperial Sacrifices presented new music, the emperor renamed the pieces *Praying for Immortals*, *Gazing for Immortals*, and *Longing for Immortals*.

In the early *Tiaolu* era, Emperor Gaozong hunted at Mount Song and had his carriage bring Shizheng to Songyang Abbey to inquire about the Dao, then escorted him back to Xiaoyao Valley. There, he saw a rattan couch on the verge of decay, with no cooking utensils—only two large gourds. When asked their purpose, Shizheng replied, “I have *qingzhui* rice, which Lord Wang of the Western City made from *nan zhu*. Eating it leads to the Dao.” Upon returning to the capital, the emperor ordered envoys to Jiangdong to prepare *qingqu* rice as a gift.

Frequently, the emperor sent handwritten edicts to comfort and inquire after him, always addressing him with the names of his disciples. Robes, incense, candles, gold, and silk were sent without cease. Such was the depth of his imperial favor. Shizheng told his disciples, “I truly have no use for these things, yet the emperor’s grace overflows. As a Daoist, my robes are all imperial gifts, and grand structures have been built for me, disturbing the earth, slaughtering plants and trees, and startling birds and beasts. I am a sinner and will surely incur dark retribution. You young disciples should seek the deepest mountains and most remote valleys, far from the world’s entanglements, to avoid such burdens.”

When the emperor was in Luoyang, he issued another summons. Unable to refuse, Shizheng stayed at the Celestial Garden. Upon returning to the mountain, the emperor sent him off with a poem.

On the first day of the first month of *Shuishen* year, from the eastern cliff of the valley, sounds of flutes and ethereal singing suddenly arose. His disciples came to report it. The master said, “I hear nothing. Do not seek fame to dazzle the world.”

Suddenly, he said to his disciple Han Wenli, “Build me a stone chamber beneath the northern cliff. By late summer, I shall move there.” Wenli could not bear to do it, but Shizheng urged him relentlessly. Wenli asked, “Would the northern cliff, connected to the sacred mountain, be suitable?” Shizheng replied, “I have lived here for over fifty years. Three times have perfected beings descended, and seven times have they spoken of essentials. Each of you has mastered one thing—you will understand in time.”

On the fourteenth day of the sixth month, he asked for a bath and wrote a green talisman, placing it in the water. He said, “This is my lifelong struggle.” The next day, just before dawn, the cries of gibbons and cranes echoed mournfully, lingering without departure. By evening, hearing the stone chamber was unfinished, he said, “It seems it will not serve my purpose after all.” Then he abruptly declared, “I am leaving.” Wenli asked, “Where are you going?”

He replied, “To inspect merits and virtues at Mount Tai.”

On the sixteenth day, he said again, “Since the stone chamber is not yet complete, temporarily build a tiled house to preserve my true self. Do not alter my garments. After a hundred days, move me into the stone chamber.” That day, clouds enveloped the courtyard, and a strange fragrance filled the room. In an instant, he dissolved into transformation at the age of ninety-eight. An imperial edict posthumously conferred upon him the title of *Grand Master for Palace Counsel*, with the posthumous name *Master of Embodied Mystery*.

The Master’s divine bearing and immortal bones were refined, much like a reclusive sage. Those who conceal their truth to refine their truth, who temper their radiance and wander in transformation—are they not of this kind?

His disciples numbered eight in all, each exceptionally gifted. Yet those whose phoenix-like grace and crane-like poise shimmered among the cloud-pine were Wei Fazhao, Sima Ziwei, and Guo Chongzhen. All had received instruction in the Jade Court, secretly inherited the teachings of the Jasper Chamber, devoted themselves to the arts of the Jade Clarity, and left behind the company of mortal immortals.

At the time, Chen Zi’ang composed an ode.

Sima Chengzhen was a descendant of Sima Yixuan, Duke of Langye in the Later Zhou. His given name was Chengzhen, and his courtesy name was Ziwei. A native of Wen in Luozhou, he studied under Master Pan, transmitting the arts of grain avoidance and guiding-and-pulling, mastering them all without exception. Master Pan marveled at him, saying, “I have received the Orthodox Unity teachings of Tao Hongjing. Now, through four generations, it has reached you.” After a long time, he took leave of his teacher’s mat and traveled extensively among the famous mountains.

He built a retreat on Mount Tiantai, constructing a tiered pavilion atop the altar, which he named the Terrace of Myriad Wonders. Empress Wu of the Tang once summoned him, but he soon departed. With Chen Zi’ang, Lu Zangyong, Song Zhiwen, Wang Shi, Bi Gou, Li Bai, Meng Haoran, Wang Wei, and He Zhizhang, he formed the Ten Daoist Friends.

Emperor Ruizong later dispatched his elder brother Chengwei to visit him, with an edict that read: “The Perfected Master’s virtue transcends the banks of the Yellow River, his ease like that of Fuqiu. He soars high in the azure courts of heaven, strides alone through the pure springs of the Dao. As We have newly ascended the throne, We have long relied upon his illustrious guidance. Though Emperor Yao yearned for the great plans of Nie Que, and the Yellow Emperor gazed afar toward Mount Kongtong, We cherish those distant aspirations yet do not neglect this present regard. Morning and evening, Our thoughts linger, Our heart soars near though We remain distant. We wished to send envoys to welcome him specially, but feared the Perfected Master might find the occasion inopportune. Thus, We have sent Chengwei to convey Our wish that he come with him. Should he decline, let there be no concern beforehand. Once arrived, he shall be received within the inner palace.”

When questioned about his arts, he replied: "In pursuing the Dao, one reduces daily—reducing and reducing again—until reaching non-action. The knowledge and perceptions of the heart and eyes, even when diminished, cannot be entirely stilled; how much more so when one assails heterodoxies and increases cunning thoughts?"

The Emperor asked: "For cultivating the self, this may suffice—but how does one govern a state?"

He answered: "A state is like the self. Thus, let the mind wander in simplicity, unite the qi in stillness, and move with things naturally without harboring private desires—then the world will be well-ordered."

The Emperor sighed in admiration: "What words of Guangcheng could surpass these?" He bestowed upon him a treasure zither and a rosy cloud-woven robe before sending him away. The court ministers composed poems to see him off, later compiled by Chang Heng and Xu Yantan into a preface titled *Record of White Clouds*.

Later, the Emperor again dispatched envoys to summon him to the capital, personally conferring talismans and registers upon him, with lavish rewards. Yet he repeatedly declined, requesting to return home. Lu Zangyong, who had once secluded himself on Mount Zhongnan before rising to high office, saw Chengzhen preparing to depart for Mount Tiantai. Pointing to Zhongnan, he remarked: "This mountain holds many fine places—why must you go to Tiantai?"

Chengzhen replied: "From my perspective, it is merely a shortcut for official advancement." Lu Zangyong flushed with shame.

Emperor Minghuang ordered the construction of an altar chamber on Mount Wangwu to house him. Chengzhen excelled in seal and clerical scripts, and his "golden scissors calligraphy" formed a style uniquely his own. The Emperor commanded him to transcribe the *Laozi* in three scripts, correcting its text and punctuation. He once forged a *Containing-Image Mirror* and a *Quaking-Light Sword* as tribute. The Emperor sent the Minister of Works, Wei Tao, to his residence to establish a ritual altar according to the *Golden Register*, bestowing generous gifts.

Upon returning from the Feng and Shan sacrifices, the Emperor asked Chengzhen which spirits presided over the Five Peaks. He answered: "The peaks are the great mountains of the realm, capable of summoning clouds and rain, and serve as the nation’s beacons. Yet the immortals who dwell there are governed by separate celestial officials." Thereupon, the Emperor decreed that separate temples for the immortal officials be established at each of the Five Peaks.

At that time, the female immortal Jiao Jingzhen crossed the sea to Penglai in search of a master. On an island, she encountered a Daoist who pointed and said: "Sima Chengzhen of Mount Tiantai—his name is inscribed on the Cinnabar Terrace, his body dwells in the Red City—he is a true and worthy teacher." Jingzhen returned and sought initiation from Chengzhen, and before long, ascended to heaven.

Once, he descended to address Xue Jichang, saying: "Master, your attainment surpasses that of Ren of Taodu Waters—you shall become the Perfected Lord of the Upper Clarity of Eastern Florescence."

During the Kaiyuan era, the Celestial Master Wenjing and Chengzhen attended the *Changsheng* Palace for the *Qianqiu* Festival’s dawn vigil. After the midnight rites, they retired behind cloud-patterned screens to rest. Suddenly, the sound of a child reciting scripture arose, clear and resonant as jade and gold. The Celestial Master lifted his robe and crept forward to peer, seeing a coin-sized sun upon Chengzhen’s forehead, its radiance illuminating the entire chamber. Drawing nearer to listen, he realized the voice emanated from within Chengzhen’s skull. The Celestial Master withdrew and told his disciples: "The *Yellow Court Scripture* says, ‘The Nine Perfected of the Mud-Pill Palace each have their chambers, a square inch within this place.’ It also says, ‘The Divine Lord of the Left, Gongzi, speaks the divine language.’ This describes our Master." He had over seventy disciples.

Suddenly he declared: "From Jade Cloud Peak, gazing east toward Penglai, I see a numinous perfected one descending in a chariot—now the Lesser Green Lad of the Eastern Sea. The Lord of Eastern Radiance has summoned me; I must depart." In an instant, he transformed and departed like a cicada shedding its husk. His disciples buried his robes and cap. He was eighty-nine years of age. By imperial edict, he was posthumously appointed Grand Master for Splendid Happiness with Silver and Cyan, and granted the posthumous title *Master of Orthodox Unity*. The emperor personally composed the inscription for his stele, and Wei Qumou wrote his biography. His works—*Arcane Essentials of Cultivating Perfection*, *Chart of the Palaces of Heaven and Earth*, *On Sitting in Forgetfulness*, and *Lineage of Ascending Perfection*—circulated in the world.

Minister Dao Yi remarked: "Sima Chengzhen scorned the trappings of rank, dwelling in grotto-heavens. His lofty heart-mind and profound learning are not easily matched. In reply to Emperor Ruizong of Tang, he said: ‘The state is like the body. Thus, to wander the heart in tranquility, to merge intent with the vast, and to follow things as they are without private bias—this is how the realm is governed.’ Truly, he grasped the profound purport of the Supreme. As the *Dao De Jing* states: ‘When I practice non-action, the people transform themselves; when I cherish stillness, the people rectify themselves; when I am without affairs, the people enrich themselves; when I am without desire, the people return to simplicity.’ This is the very meaning." —Li Hanguang.

The subject was a native of Jinling. His family, originally of pure Confucian stock, was known in the region as the "Master of Integrity and Reclusion." Later, to avoid the personal name of Emperor Jingzong of Tang, the family changed its surname to Li. His son, Han’guang, at the age of thirteen, was deeply devoted to Daoist learning. Even in seclusion, he conducted himself as though in the presence of a sovereign or father. When others beheld him, his demeanor was always composed. Skilled in seal and clerical scripts, some even claimed he surpassed his father. Upon hearing such praise, he never wrote again in those styles for the rest of his life.

Later, he became a disciple of the Master of Orthodox Unity, who entrusted him with the sacred texts of cloud-seal scriptures, bestowing them without reservation. The master declared: "You are a guest of the Pure Jade Clarity. Embrace emptiness and practice cultivation, and your Dao shall never be exhausted. Yet if you seclude yourself in remote mountains and conceal your traces, your virtue will remain shallow." Though the teachings were profound, he urged Han’guang to prioritize saving others.

Having received this true instruction, Han’guang forgot his own concerns and aided those in distress. Whenever he composed memorials or petitions, he purified his heart and body, never once growing negligent. Emperor Ming of Tang summoned him and inquired about governance and transformation. Han’guang replied: "The *Dao De Jing* is the teacher of rulers. Formerly, Emperor Wen of Han practiced its principles and guided the people into the realm of benevolence and longevity."

When asked about the golden elixir, he said: "The Dao and virtue are impartial. Lightness and transcendence are but private inclinations within impartiality. Though such inclinations appear self-serving, they remain part of the sagely teachings—like seeking life. Yet to pursue desires is like grasping at the wind. Is that not difficult?" The emperor praised him and treated him with great courtesy.

Before long, Han’guang pleaded illness and returned to Juqu, where an imperial edict established the Ziyang Abbey as his residence. When the emperor received the *True Scripture of Yang and Xu*, he requested Han’guang as his teacher, but Han’guang again declined due to illness. Thereupon, in the Hall of Great Unity, the emperor composed a formal address, bestowing upon him the posthumous title "Master Wenjing" from afar. Imperial decrees were repeatedly issued, and provisions were continuously supplied.

Han’guang once compiled the *Biographies of Immortals’ Learning*, a treatise on the differences and similarities among the Three Mysteries, and the *Phonetic Glosses of the Materia Medica*. He was also ordered to complete several pages of calligraphy left unfinished by Yang the Perfected. In the eleventh month of the fourth year of the Dali era of Emperor Daizong, he told his disciples Wei Jingzhao and Meng Zhanran: "I shall follow the transformation of nature." Shortly after, his countenance remained serene as he departed. Auspicious clouds descended, and lingzhi mushrooms sprouted. He lived to the age of eighty-seven.

*Comprehensive Mirror of Perfected Immortals Who Embodied the Dao*, Scroll Twenty-Five—concluded.
*Comprehensive Mirror of Perfected Immortals Who Embodied the Dao*, Scroll Twenty-Six.

Master Historian Xu, the Perfected Lord of the Grand Scribe, bore the surname Xu and the given name Xun, styled Jingzhi. His great-grandfather was Xu Mei, his grandfather Xu Wang, and his father Xu Su. The family had long resided in Xuchang, maintaining lofty integrity and declining public office. They were descendants of the Yingyang You lineage. During the Han dynasty’s decline, his father relocated to Nanchang in Yuzhang, where they settled. In the second year of Chiwu of the Wu kingdom (the year *jiwei*), his mother, the Lady of the House, dreamed of a golden phoenix bearing a pearl that alighted in her palm. She admired and swallowed it, and upon waking, felt movement in her womb. Thus she conceived and gave birth to the Perfected Lord.

Master Yuanyou of Mount Juqu and Mu, the Chief Clerk of the Protector-General of the Jin, were the Perfected Lord’s second cousins. From birth, the Perfected Lord displayed exceptional intelligence and a striking, majestic appearance. As a child, he was open and guileless, never acting against others. Once, while hunting, he shot a pregnant doe, and its fawn fell to the ground. The mother doe turned back to lick it, dying before she could finish. Moved by this, he immediately cast aside his bow and arrows, resolving to devote himself to learning.

He mastered the classics and histories, attaining profound knowledge of astronomy, geography, music, the Five Phases, and apocryphal texts. Yet he was especially drawn to the arts of divine transcendence and self-cultivation, achieving remarkable mastery. Hearing that Wu Meng of Xi’an had received esoteric methods from the perfected adept Ding Yi, he journeyed to study under him, receiving the full transmission of his secrets. Thereafter, he and Guo Pu explored famous mountains in search of auspicious sites for dwelling in truth. They found the southern slope of Mount Xiaoyao in Xishan, the residence of the Jin family, and moved there—now known as the Xiaoyao Blessed Land and the Jade Prosperity Palace of Ten Thousand Longevities.

He devoted himself daily to cultivation, and to this day, the Elixir Well and Mortar remain. Though he sought no fame or prominence, his village was transformed by his filial piety and brotherly love, and his associates admired his virtue and righteousness. Once, a merchant sold him an iron lampstand. That night, as he lit the lamp, he noticed peeling lacquer, revealing gold beneath. The next day, he sought out the owner and returned it. If someone offered him a gift, he would accept nothing unless it accorded with propriety. Though recommended as a Filial and Incorrupt candidate by the prefecture, he declined the appointment.

The court repeatedly extended offers of official appointment, and he could no longer decline. Thus, in the first year of Emperor Wu of Jin’s Taikang era (280 CE), at the age of forty-two, he assumed the post of magistrate of Jingyang County in Shu Commandery. Upon taking office, he earnestly exhorted the clerks and subordinates to abandon greed and vulgarity, eliminate trivial regulations, and release prisoners from their fetters. He instructed them all in the Dao, and both officials and commoners were pleased and submitted willingly, all wishing to reform themselves. His administrative decisions were as if divinely inspired, and the clerks dared not deceive him. When hearing lawsuits, he would first teach the litigants about loyalty, filial piety, kindness, benevolence, patience, prudence, diligence, and frugality—drawing near to the worthy, distancing the treacherous, and putting an end to greed and violence. These teachings were recorded in detail in his *Wencheng* texts.

Yet he lamented that the county’s vast expanse made it difficult to ensure every household understood his governance. Thus, he selected virtuous and respected commoners, along with elders of wisdom, and entrusted them with the task of exhortation and leadership. As a result, the spirit of contention gradually faded, and over time, lawsuits ceased entirely.

Previously, during a year of famine, the people had no means to pay their taxes, and the commandery and county enforced the law strictly, driving many to flee. The Perfected Lord then transmuted tiles and pebbles into gold using an elixir and had them secretly buried in the county garden. One day, he summoned all those who had yet to pay their taxes to the courtyard and set them to work in the rear garden. As they dug, they unearthed gold, which they used to pay their taxes, and thus all were able to remain in their homes. Hearing of his virtue and benevolence, refugees from neighboring regions flocked to him in great numbers, and the population flourished.

When a great epidemic later struck, killing seven or eight out of every ten people, the Perfected Lord employed the divine formulas he had been taught to heal them. Wherever his talismans and incantations reached, the afflicted recovered instantly. Even those suffering from chronic or severe illnesses were cured without exception. Word spread to other commanderies, and the sick arrived in an unbroken stream, numbering in the thousands daily. He then planted bamboo outside the city walls along a ten-*li* stretch of the river, placing talismanic water within it, and instructed the people to drink beneath the bamboo—all were healed. For the elderly, the frail, and those too ill to come themselves, he allowed them to draw the water and drink it at home, and they too recovered. The people of Shu composed a song about him:

*No theft or robbery,*
*No deceit from officials.*
*Our lord revives the people,*
*No illness can withstand him.*

Later, people from the region east of the Yangtze also came to draw water from Jingyang. The Perfected Lord then consecrated a vessel of water with a talisman and instructed them to take it back and place it by the riverbank, planting bamboo to mark the spot. The sick who drank from it were likewise cured. This river is now called the Shu River, also known as the Brocade Waters, and lies within present-day Gao’an County in Ruizhou.

After serving as magistrate of Jingyang for many years, the Perfected Lord foresaw the coming chaos of the Jin dynasty and resigned his post to return east. Jingyang County belonged to Hanzhou; after the Perfected Lord’s ascension, the imperial court renamed it Deyang in honor of his virtue and its people. Later, the county seat was moved west, and the former site was converted into a Daoist temple, now known as Jingyang Abbey.

The people of Shu, moved by his transformative virtue, could find no way to detain him. Everywhere he had been, they erected shrines to him in life, and households enshrined his portrait, revering him as a divine being. On the day of his departure, those carrying provisions to see him off filled the fields. Some followed him for a thousand *li* before turning back, while others accompanied him to his home, wishing to serve him and never return. They settled on vacant land east of his residence, building huts like a military encampment. Many even changed their surnames to match his, and thus the place became known as the Xu Family Encampment. Such was the depth of his enduring love among the people.

Once, the Perfected Lord traveled to Xinyu and rested beneath a bridge grove. Suddenly, five maidens appeared, each bearing a precious sword, which they offered to him. Marveling, he accepted them. The site is now known as Bridge Grove Abbey. Thereafter, the maidens accompanied him to his residence, where they amused themselves daily by striking the swords together, their purpose unfathomable to others. The Perfected Lord, recognizing their exhaustion from the swords, treated them with courtesy, and in time, they proved their worth as divine blades. After his ascension, they concealed themselves beneath the wutong tree he had planted, and thus became known as the Wutong Immortal Maidens.

Later, he and Lord Wu journeyed to Songyang, where they heard of a female master named Chen Mu in Huangtang, Danyang County, near Jinling, who possessed many Daoist arts. Together, they went to pay their respects and inquired about the subtleties of the Dao. The mistress said: “You both were born with sacred bones, and your names are recorded in the celestial registers as immortals. Yet in the past, the Filial and Fraternal King descended from the Upper Clarity to transform and deliver the mortal world, demonstrating the practice of filial piety. He first descended to the home of Master Lan in Qufu, Yanzhou, and said to him: ‘In a later age of the Jin dynasty, a divine immortal named Xu Sun will appear, to whom you shall transmit this Dao, for he shall be the leader of all the Perfected.’ He left behind the Golden Elixir and Precious Scriptures, along with bronze talismans and iron charters, instructing Master Lan to safeguard them until Xu Sun’s arrival. This has been many years. I, too, have received the teachings of the Filial Dao Bright King, which also take filial piety as their foundation. Have you now come?’ I shall transmit them to you.”

She then selected an auspicious day and ascended the altar. Following the ritual protocols, she administered the oaths and instructions, expounding on the Way of Filial Piety with solemn admonitions. She produced the bronze talismans, iron charters, Golden Elixir and Precious Scriptures, along with the Orthodox Unity methods for slaying demons, the arts of the Three and Five Flying Steps, and all the secret techniques of the various ranks, transmitting them all to Lord Xu. Turning to Lord Wu, she said: “In the past, you served as Lord Xu’s teacher in divine formulas, but now only he has received the teachings of the Filial Dao Bright King. You should now defer to him as your master. Moreover, the Jade Emperor’s celestial register ranks you as the Inspector of the Mystic Capital, while Lord Xu holds the position of High and Illustrious Grand Master, overseeing the celestial registers and outranking all others. You are each assigned to govern one of the twelve earthly branches corresponding to the twelve states: Lord Xu presides over the Xuan Yang region, corresponding to the *zi* branch, and oversees the twelve terrestrial divisions. You govern the Star Chronicle state, corresponding to the *chou* branch. From now on, you should acknowledge Lord Xu as your superior.”

The two lords bowed in gratitude and took their leave. The Perfected Lord then resolved to visit the mistress every year. Sensing his intention, she said: “Do not come again, for I shall soon return to the imperial realm.” She then took a stalk of fragrant cogon grass, faced south, and cast it, saying: “When you return, build my shrine where the grass falls. A visit each autumn will suffice.” The two lords returned and first sought the place where the grass had landed. They found it over forty *li* south of their residence, where it had already grown into a thicket.

Thereupon they built a shrine hall, likewise with a yellow chamber, naming it the Venerable Dao Abbey. Each year on the third day of mid-autumn, they would invariably go to pay homage. Earlier, when the Perfected Lord had gone to seek the fallen cogon grass, he saw by the roadside a clear pond and rested there briefly, saying: “This is where I rested in true tranquility—now known as the Qingbei Village Tranquility Abbey.” He also saw villagers preparing lavish feasts of slaughtered animals to sacrifice to the gods, remarking to one another in surprise: “If the offerings are not abundant, the gods will grow angry and send down calamity.” The Perfected Lord said: “How dare such malevolent spirits act thus?” That night, lodging at an inn, he summoned wind and thunder to strike them, uprooting their grove. The next day, he told the villagers: “The demonic shrine has been driven away; there is no need for sacrifices.” To this day, the site lies abandoned, and no one makes offerings there.

He also saw travelers burdened with water jars along the road, so he thrust his staff into the dried marsh before the shrine, causing a spring to gush forth to aid them. Even in drought, it never runs dry—now known as the Purple Yang Tranquility Stone Well of Daze Village. The next day, ascending a mountain peak, he pointed to a spring altar halfway up the slope and said: “There is a strange creature hidden here, which will later bring harm.” Thereupon he established an altar to pacify and suppress it. Each year when he came to pay homage to the mistress, he would rest here, and it is now called Dragon City Abbey.

He then crossed the Xiao Shu River—now called Huanghu Port—and reached a tavern by the riverbank. The proprietor, a man surnamed Zhu, though poor, received him with great reverence. The Perfected Lord playfully drew a pine tree on the wall before departing. From that day on, the family’s profits doubled. Later, when the river flooded and breached the dike, all the market stalls were swept away—only the wall with the pine remained intact. Now called Pine Lake Market, the Zhu family built a temple there and still draws sustenance from the land.

The Perfected Lord once refined divine elixir on Yellow Dragon Mountain in Aicheng. The mountain stream harbored a flood dragon, which made its lair in the deep pools and frequently unleashed floods to sweep away the elixir chamber. The Perfected Lord dispatched divine soldiers to capture it and nail it to a stone cliff—where the Dragon-Nailing Stone remains to this day. After the elixir was completed, he offered it in sacrifice at the stone chamber of Immortal Ge on Mofu Mountain.

He then came to Xiuchuan, admiring its swift currents and firm waters, and took his divine sword to whet it on a stone by the stream. The site remains in Meishan of Xiuchuan, and later generations built an abbey there to mark the sacred proximity—now called Jingyang Abbey. Soon after, he crossed the river and ascended秀峰—now called Jingyang Mountain—where he built an altar on the peak to offer thanks to the Supreme Emperor before consuming the immortal elixir.

Lord Hao resided nearby—south of the stream lies Hao Immortal Village and Hao Immortal Abbey, the former dwelling of Perfected Lord Hao. The Perfected Lord then visited Lord Hao’s residence. Passing through Xi’an County—now known as Fennin—he was met by the local earth god, who inquired about malevolent creatures harming the people, only for the god to conceal them. As the Perfected Lord passed a small shrine, the deity within—a man surnamed Mao with four brothers, now known as the Temple of Harmonious Protection, located four hundred paces east of the county—came forth to greet him, saying: “Here dwells a flood dragon that harms the people. Knowing of your arrival, it has fled to Ezhu. It will return later, so I beg you to rid this land of it for the people’s sake.”

The Perfected Lord followed his words, tracking its trail to Ezhu. By the roadside, he encountered three elders—now the Three Kings Temple—who, when asked about the dragon’s whereabouts, all pointed and said: “We saw it lurking beneath the bridge ahead”—now called Hidden Dragon Bridge. The Perfected Lord reached the bridge, brandished his sword, and rebuked it. The dragon, startled, fled into the great river and concealed itself in the depths—now called Lower Dragon Hollow. He then compelled the local officials and soldiers to drive it out. The dragon burst forth from the upper reaches, and he slew it—now called Upper Dragon Mouth.

Enraged at the dereliction of the Xi’an earth god, the Perfected Lord sealed the temple gates and forbade the people from making offerings. To this day, the main gate of the City God Temple in Fennin County remains closed, and it is said that when it opens, the town will suffer fire. The priests now enter and exit only through the side door, and few villagers make offerings. Instead, they now worship at the small shrine—now the Temple of the Marquis of Harmonious Protection—which receives abundant sacrifices and is renowned for its divine efficacy.

Finally, he returned to the prefectural city. The Perfected Lord said: “This place is a vital hub of water and land routes, teeming with people—how could there not be those weary of the world’s divisions and seeking repose?”

Having tested the waters by mixing several grains of his elixir with other medicines for sale, he let the credulous purchase them. Though many later sought to redeem their purchases, not a single one succeeded. The Perfected Lord sighed, lamenting the rarity of those in the world fit for transcendence.

Hearing that a flood dragon was wreaking havoc in Xinho, he took up his sword and gave chase. The path he traversed is now called Dragon Spring Abbey—later renamed Immortal’s Journey. The dragon, terrified, fled into a mountain stream, which to this day is called Hiding Creek. The Perfected Lord then inscribed talismans upon a massive boulder and composed the *Text for Suppressing the Dragon* to bind it. The stone stele bearing the *Text for Suppressing the Dragon* still stands, now within a monastery called Prolonging the True. Nearby is an abbey, also named Prolonging the True, ten *li* west of Fengxin County.

At that time, in the upper reaches of Haihun, a colossal serpent had claimed a mountain cave as its lair, exhaling clouds of qi that, once spread, would swallow any man or beast within forty *li* of its miasma—none escaped. Boats on the rivers and lakes were likewise capsized and drowned, bringing great suffering to the people. The Perfected Lord, upon hearing of this, ascended the summit of the northern ridge to investigate. The peak east of Red Crow Abbey—now called Immortals’ Gathering Peak—was the very place. There, he saw the venomous qi darkening the sky.

Moved by the plight of the people, he gathered his disciples, intending to slay the beast. As they first entered its domain, over three hundred residents from near and far, knowing of the Perfected Lord’s mastery of the Dao, came pleading for help, their entreaties earnest. The Perfected Lord said: “The turning of the world’s fortunes brings calamity in its wake, and the people must endure its trials. I have come precisely for this purpose. I shall rid you of this scourge—I swear I shall not live in the same age as this serpent.” Soon after, his disciples arrived, all urging him to act. The Perfected Lord replied: “The time must be ripe.”

Thus, he planted his sword into the earth and silently prayed to Heaven. After a long while, a spring gushed forth, and soon a red crow flew past. The Perfected Lord said: “The time is ripe.” That place was named the Time-Watching Terrace, later renamed Red Crow Abbey, and now called Longevity Sage Abbey, also known as Broad Blessings.

A Daoist of the Song dynasty, Wan Zhongxing, wrote a poem:
*Of old a giant serpent wrought its venomous might,
Jingyang here awaited the hour to smite.
Cave-dwelling immortals gathered in the know,
While in the heavens a sacred crow marked the time’s flow.
Talismans flew in wrath o’er the valley’s mouth,
Sword-stars clashed down—ghosts and gods grieved in drouth.
A thousand years hence, rise and fall swift unfold,
Yet boundless remains the hidden merit untold.*

Zhang Tianjue also composed a poem on the Sword-Planting Spring:
*The sword planted became a well beneath the stone,
Waiting for the crow at noon to stir alone.
The sea’s dark fiends now purged, their taint undone,
Yet blessings linger still in the Seven Tranquil Charts shown.*

Proceeding to the serpent’s lair, he brandished his sword and deployed his qi. The serpent, terrified, retreated into its cave. He then sent a flying talisman to summon the Lord of Haihun’s Earth Altar to drive it out, but it could not emerge. He next summoned the Lord of Nanchang’s Earth Altar to assist, and the talisman fell two *li* east of the county, where an abbey was later built, named Talisman-Fall Abbey, now called Supreme Harmony.

The serpent emerged from its cave, rearing its head over ten *zhang* high, its eyes like torches of fire, spewing venom that blotted out the sky. The villagers all clamored and drummed to aid him. At that moment, the Perfected Lord whistled, commanding wind and thunder, and summoned divine soldiers with a gesture to subdue it, rendering it immobile. Then, Lord Wu strode forward and trampled its head, cleaving its skull with his sword. The serpent at last cowered low, and his disciples Shi Cen, Gan Zhan, and others led the troops to strike. The serpent’s belly split open, and a smaller serpent, several *zhang* long, slithered out from within. Lord Gan sought to slay it, but the Perfected Lord said: “It has done no harm—we must not kill without cause.” The young serpent, frightened, fled six or seven *li*, the clamor of the drums still audible as it turned to glance back at its mother. The place is now called Serpent’s Offspring Harbor and Seven-*Li* Ford.

His disciples urged him to pursue and slay it, but the Perfected Lord said: “If this serpent brings harm to the people in a hundred and fifty years, I shall return to slay it. The banyan I plant before my altar shall serve as proof—when its branches sweep the ground, that will be the time.” He also foretold: “One thousand two hundred and forty years after my departure as an immortal, within the borders of Yuzhang and the Five Mounds, in the eastern lands of Jiangzhou and Fengshui’s celestial divisions, the eastern gate’s stronghold shall be Wanling. In the southern lands of Yangzhou’s celestial divisions, the southern gate’s stronghold shall be Haoling. In the western lands of Yongzhou and Weitai’s celestial divisions, the western gate’s stronghold shall be Queling. In the northern lands of Youzhou and Taiyuan’s celestial divisions, the northern gate’s stronghold shall be Fuling. In the central lands of Chang’an and Changpu’s celestial divisions, the central gate’s stronghold shall be Tailing. Then shall emerge eight hundred earthbound immortals, whose master shall arise in Yuzhang to greatly propagate my teachings. When a sandbar suddenly rises in the heart of the prefectural river, covering the mouth of Shajing, that will be the time.” (This event is recorded in *Longsha’s Rise* in *Yuzhang’s Gazetteer of Administrative Geography*. Longsha lies atop the rocks on the western bank of Zhang River, facing the prefectural city.)

Pan Qingyi wrote a poem, *Gazing at Longsha*:
*Countless souls dwell in the Five Mounds’ keep,
Their eyes fixed on Longsha’s record deep.
Though Longsha has not yet fully grown,
Its aura already stirs with mystic tone.
Once dragons writhed here in ancient days,
Now mulberry and hemp claim their maze.
The land curves with the river’s bend,
Isles float in chains without end.*

“If at that time the young serpent brings harm, those eight hundred shall surely slay it. But if it harms no living thing, it must not be killed.” The serpent’s offspring thus entered the river at Jianchang County’s Serpent’s Offspring Harbor, where a temple stands on Xinjian County’s Wucheng Mountain, renowned for its efficacy. In the Song dynasty, it was enfeoffed as the Spirit-Compliant, Manifest-Response, Peace-Bringing, Blessing-Bestowing King, commonly called the Little Dragon Temple.

After the great serpent’s death, its bones piled into an islet, now called Serpent-Bone Isle. Wherever the Perfected Lord passed through Haihun, he left behind altars and wells—six in all, including the Time-Watching Terrace, making seven. Their arrangement mirrored the Dipper’s form, serving to suppress future calamities. The Seven Tranquilities refer to Advancing Transformation Tranquility, Imperial Memorial Tranquility, Cinnabar Talisman Tranquility, Flowery Tablet Tranquility, Purple Yang Tranquility, Huo Yang Tranquility, and Liu the Perfected’s Tranquility. Today, all have become official abbeys, some now temples or government residences.

He then traveled to the northwest of the county, where he found a mountain spring clear and pure. He cast a talisman into it, enabling the people to cure illnesses with its waters, its efficacy rivaling that of the Shu River. The place is now called Jade Water Terrace.

After the giant python was slain, its monstrous blood stained his sword. He thus sharpened and washed it, testing its edge on a stone. Today, in Jianchang County, the Sword-Sharpening Pool and Sword-Testing Stone remain. He addressed his disciples: “Though the great serpent is destroyed, the dragon-spirit remains unvanquished. That creature is cunning—it must know of my intent to eradicate harm. I fear it may seize an opportunity to breach the prefectural city. Let us return to the prefecture.” Shi and Cen followed him.

This occurred in the sixth year of Emperor Huai’s Yongjia reign. The Perfected Lord’s Daoist arts were wondrous and widely renowned. Hundreds sought to become his disciples, but he could not accept them all.

Then he transformed charcoal into a beautiful woman and dispersed her among his disciples at night to test them. At dawn, he reviewed them, and only ten remained unstained by her allure—these were the very disciples who would later ascend to immortality. Thereafter, whenever he roamed rivers and lakes to slay dragons and serpents, they never failed to accompany him. The rest, ashamed, departed. Today, at West Ford in Jianchang County, the market is called Charcoal Woman Market, and a temple named Miaoming stands there.

The Perfected Lord then returned to the prefecture with Lords Gan and Shi, surveying the city. There, a youth of refined bearing and splendid attire presented himself, announcing his surname as Shen. His manners were earnest, his responses quick, and he soon took his leave. The Perfected Lord said to his disciples: “That was no man, but the spirit of the old dragon, come to test me. Though his form was human, a rank wind clung to him. I feigned ignorance to expose his kind fully.” Tracking his path, they found him by the river, transformed into a yellow ox, lying upon the sands outside the prefectural city—now called Yellow Ox Shoal. The Perfected Lord cut paper into a black ox and sent it to engage the creature, ordering Shi Cen to conceal himself with a sword and strike when the beast was off guard. With a single swing, Shi Cen severed its left thigh, and the ox fled into a well south of the city. The well, named Horizontal Spring, still lies at the southeast corner of Upper Blue Temple, its mouth sealed by a wall—hence its other name, Dragon Well. The Perfected Lord dispatched a talismanic officer to trace its tracks, discovering it had fled straight to Changsha, emerging from the well of Jia Yi. There, it took human form and entered the household of Prefect Jia Yu.

Earlier, the dragon spirit had admired Jia’s daughter for her beauty and, transforming into a handsome youth, sought an audience. Jia, impressed by his talent, promised him his daughter’s hand and, through lavish gifts to Jia’s confidants, secured their praise. The marriage was thus arranged. After several years, they had two sons. Each spring and summer, the husband would depart alone, roaming rivers and lakes as if a merchant. By autumn, he returned in a great ship laden with treasures—plunder from vessels capsized in the floods. That autumn, he returned to Jia, claiming: “Bandits seized our goods and wounded my left thigh.” The entire household lamented, and Jia sought physicians to treat him.

The Perfected Lord then disguised himself as a physician and called upon Jia, who welcomed him and summoned his son-in-law for treatment. Sensing danger, the dragon spirit dared not appear. Jia rose to fetch him, and the Perfected Lord followed into the hall, crying in a stern voice: “Dragon spirit of rivers and lakes, you have wrought harm beyond count! I have tracked you here—how dare you flee! Come forth at once!” Cornered, the creature revealed its true form, coiling beneath the hall, and was slain by the officers. The Perfected Lord sprinkled its two sons with ritual water, and they too transformed into small dragons, promptly executed. Jia’s daughter nearly changed form as well, but her parents pleaded for mercy, and the Perfected Lord gave them a divine talisman, sparing her.

He warned Jia: “Beneath the dragon spirit’s dwelling lies water. Dig but a few feet beneath your home, and you will find vast waves. Move at once, lest you court disaster.” The entire household, terrified, relocated to high ground. Soon after, the site sank into an abyss, its depths unfathomable—now known as Bright Pool in Changsha.

The Perfected Lord returned to Yuzhang, but the dragon’s remaining followers thrived, uneasy at the prospect of his wrath. They took human form and wandered the city, seeking his disciples. Feigning innocence, one said: “I hail from Chang’an, where my family has long practiced virtue. I have heard of your master, Lord Xu, and his divine sword—might I learn of its power?” A disciple replied: “Our master’s sword is divine: point it at the heavens, and they split; at the earth, and it cracks; at the stars, and they lose their course; at rivers, and they reverse their flow. No evil dares stand before it—it is a treasure of gods and sages.” Another added: “Yet is there aught it cannot harm?”

The disciple jested, “It can harm all but winter melons and gourds.” Taking this as truth, the dragons transformed themselves and their kin into gourds and winter melons, vines and all, floating in dense clusters upon the river, intending to drift beyond the borders.

At dawn, the Perfected Lord sensed a surge of malevolent qi. Gazing upon the river, he saw the shapes of the dragon spirits and handed his sword to Shi Cen, commanding him to tread the waters and slay them. Their followers, entwined like vines, were annihilated without exception, turning the river’s flow murky. The Perfected Lord declared, “This place is a den of dragons and serpents. Without a means to suppress them, they will resurface to wreak havoc, beyond human control.” Thus, he summoned spirits and gods to forge an iron pillar at the well south of the yamen, its shaft rising several feet above the ground, its base secured by eight chains to anchor the earth’s veins—now the site of Yan Zhen Abbey. He intoned, “If the iron pillar bends, the demons shall rise again, and I will return. If the pillar stands true, the demons are vanquished forever.” From then on, water spirits withdrew, and the city knew peace.

Yet he feared that future generations might breed treachery, so he inscribed upon the iron pillar a cryptic verse: *“Where the land prevails and hearts are virtuous, no villainy shall arise. Even if schemes take root, they will never reach fruition.”* Such was the depth of the Perfected Lord’s foresight for posterity.

The following year, learning that remnants of the dragons and serpents had scattered into Poyang and Deyang, he feared their return. He traversed rivers and lakes, eradicating them utterly. Atop Mount Caoxiao, three dragon lakes pierced the cliffs, their caverns connecting to the great river and the lands of Rao and Xin. The Perfected Lord slew their dragon spirits and established Yuyang Prefecture’s Jing to suppress them. At the bay beneath the northwestern stone cliffs, he founded Kaihua Jing for the same purpose. He further established Taicheng Prefecture’s Jing, beside which lay a bottomless abyss teeming with dragons and serpents—these he exterminated entirely, save for one young dragon that fled. Thus, he erected this Jing to sever its path. He also cast an iron talisman to seal the mouth of Poyang Lake, blocking their entry—now embedded in the river at Shangzhong Stone in Hukou County. He forged an iron lid to cover Yuan Pond in Luling, restraining their hidden lair, and set an iron talisman upon it—now called Feifu Ridge, home to Chongzhen Abbey. A sword was left there, a foot and a handspan in length, resembling jade or stone, yet neither—its nature unrecognizable to men.

The next year, the seventh of Yongjia, he journeyed again to Changsha, then to Shaoyang. The following year, he visited the prefectures of Tan and Heng, purging poisons and eliminating harm wherever he went, before returning to Yuzhang. In all, he established over seventy prefectures and Jings to suppress malevolence and avert calamities across commanderies and towns.

In the second year of Emperor Ming’s Taining era, the Grand General Wang Dun, styled Chuzhong, raised arms against the court and encamped by the lake. The Perfected Lord and Lord Wu went to pay their respects, hoping to dissuade him. At the time, Master Guo Pu served in the general’s staff, and they entered together. Chuzhong, pleased, invited them to drink and asked, “I dreamed of a tree splitting the sky—what does this portend?” The Perfected Lord replied, “It is no auspicious sign.” Lord Wu said, “A tree splitting the sky forms the character *wei* (未, ‘not yet’). You should not act rashly.” Chuzhong’s expression darkened, and he ordered Guo Pu to divine the outcome. Guo Pu said, “It will not succeed.” Chuzhong grew displeased. “How long do I have to live?” he demanded. Guo Pu answered, “If you proceed, disaster will strike soon. If you return to Wuchang, your lifespan cannot be measured.” Enraged, Chuzhong asked, “And how long do *you* have to live?” Guo Pu replied, “My life ends at midday today.” Chuzhong flew into a fury and ordered his guards to seize and behead Guo Pu. (The *Biographies of Immortals* records that Guo Pu had forewarned his family, preparing funeral arrangements at his encampment. His fate was sealed by the river’s western pines. Three days later, merchants in Nanzhou market saw Guo Pu selling his garments, conversing with acquaintances. When Chuzhong heard this, he refused to believe it. Opening the coffin, he found no corpse—Guo Pu had attained liberation through death and now serves as an immortal lord of the water realm.)

The Perfected Lord then raised his cup and cast it into the air, where it transformed into a white wagtail, circling the beams. When Chuzhong looked up, the two Lords had vanished. Chuzhong ultimately met defeat, dying in bitter regret, his corpse subjected to posthumous punishment.

The two Lords returned to Jinling and sought to hire a boat to Yuzhang. The boatman claimed no hands were available to row. The Perfected Lord said, “Close your eyes and sit calmly—do not peek. I will steer for you.” He summoned two dragons to flank the vessel, and with his seal, he imprinted the western cliff to ward off water spirits. The seal’s mark remains to this day. The boat glided through the air, swiftly passing over the summit of Mount Lu, arriving at the Golden Palace Grotto on Purple Cloud Peak. The two Lords wished to explore the cave, so the boat descended slightly, scraping the treetops with a grating sound. The boatman could not resist peeking; the dragons abandoned the vessel upon a towering peak, snapping the mast into a deep ravine—both later turned to iron and stone, now called Iron Boat Peak. The mast lies broken in the gorge.

The Perfected Lord admonished the boatman, “You disobeyed my command—where will you go now?” The boatman knelt, begging for salvation. The Perfected Lord taught him to ingest sacred herbs, enabling him to fast and achieve immortality. He vanished into these mountains. Later, when Huan Yi governed Jiangzhou, he sent men to investigate the wonders of Mount Lu. At Purple Cloud Peak, they saw a boat in the lake, accompanied by cranes, red-scaled fish, and a youth on a white horse, his long whistle audible for hundreds of paces—suspecting him to be one of the boatmen. The two Lords, each riding a dragon, traveled by land and water to reunite at Heavenly Treasure Grotto on the northern ridge. They returned to their former retreat, spending their days expounding the true Dao with their disciples. For decades, they paid no heed to worldly affairs, devoted solely to cultivating the supreme Way.

He composed the *"Drunken Thoughts of an Immortal"* song and inscribed the *"Eight Treasures of Sagely Instruction"*, which read:

**Loyalty and filial piety, integrity and prudence—**
Loyalty precludes deceit; filial piety averts rebellion.
Integrity shuns greed; prudence prevents loss.
Cultivate the self thus, and virtue may be perfected.

**Magnanimity and tolerance, forbearance and composure—**
Magnanimity wins the multitude; abundance leaves no lack.
Tolerance embraces all; forbearance brings ease.
Conduct yourself thus with others, and grievances shall vanish.

**All my disciples of the Dao, in motion or stillness, be diligent and sincere.**
Keep these precepts ever in mind, ever guarding your solitude.
Should your heart stray, the Three Officials shall examine and punish.
When the village and community emulate this, all turn toward goodness and distance themselves from transgression, and filial piety flourishes in practice.

In daily life, his comings and goings, his responses to circumstances, differed not from ordinary men. Only in his dwelling did cranes circle in flight, and auspicious clouds swirl about.

Since the chaos of the Eastern Jin’s collapse and the frequent disturbances along the Jiangnan region, within a hundred *li* of the Perfected Lord’s abode, bandits dared not intrude. The villages knew peace, harvests were bountiful year after year, and the people suffered no calamities. Such blessings showered upon the living, yet none knew their source.

In the second year of Ningkang of Emperor Xiaowu (the *jiaxu* year), the Perfected Lord was one hundred and thirty-six years old. On the first day of the eighth month, a cloud-borne procession descended from heaven. Two immortals, accompanied by a grand retinue, alighted in the Perfected Lord’s courtyard. The Perfected Lord descended the steps to receive them with bows. The two immortals said, "By the Jade Emperor’s decree, we present you with an edict." The Perfected Lord prostrated himself to listen as the edict was proclaimed:

*"The Supreme Edict to the Immortal Student Xu Sun: In countless kalpas past, you have assiduously cultivated the supreme Dao, enduring hardships and mastering its profound intricacies. Of the myriad methods and thousand gates, none have you not studied. You have rescued the distressed, delivered the imperiled, eradicated harm, and vanquished demons—your merits have succored the living, and your name is exalted in the Jade Register. The host of immortals reveres you; it is fitting you be elevated. You are hereby appointed the Celestial Historian of the Nine Provinces and Grand Illuminator, bestowed with a purple feathered robe, a jade banner, a sacred staff, an elixir of jade nectar, and a pill of golden cinnabar. Receive and execute this decree."*

The Perfected Lord bowed twice, ascended the steps, and accepted the edict. One immortal said, "I am Cui Ziwen, the Jade True Lord." The other said, "I am Xiaqiu Zhong, the Primordial True Minister." Having spoken, they invited the Perfected Lord to sit and informed him of the day of his ascension. Then they departed in a cloud chariot.

The Perfected Lord summoned his disciples and the village elders to announce his departure. Thereafter, he gathered with them day and night at his residence, hosting feasts and cherishing their parting moments. He instructed them in the principles of performing good deeds and accumulating merit to attain the Dao of immortality. He composed works such as the *Book of the Spirit Sword* and, for each of his eleven disciples, wrote ten five-line poems of admonition in couplets to bequeath to the world. He also transmitted the formula for the *"Great Merit Wish-Fulfilling Elixir"* to those disciples who would not ascend with him—a formula also found among Ding Yi’s divine prescriptions. The method required first selecting an auspicious day, observing purification rites, and setting up an altar to invoke the spirits of the eighteen medicinal ingredients. Only then were talismans inscribed, incantations recited for each ingredient, and the elixir compounded. It cured all manner of ailments as desired.

On the fifteenth of the month, he held a grand feast, inviting all the villagers, young and old, to gather. At midday, music was heard from afar, and auspicious clouds filled the sky, gradually approaching the assembly. A dragon-drawn chariot with a feathered canopy arrived, flanked by attendants, celestial youths, and maidens in colorful attire, with red auroras and purple vapors spreading all around. The two envoys arrived again, and the Perfected Lord descended the steps to receive them. The two immortals once more proclaimed an edict:

*"The Supreme Edict to the Immortal Student Xu Sun: Your past-life sins of greed, killing, and neglecting ancestral rites are absolved. Your present-life merits in chanting spells, wielding talismans, healing the sick, and punishing evil with potent toxins are recorded. The Controller of Life of Mount Qian has been commanded to transmit the golden elixir to the mortal realm. Your debts are sealed, your form concealed; your body, household, and all possessions are to return to the Three Heavens. Hasten to purify yourself. Ascend through the earth, soaring aloft. The Celestial Ding of Great Power on your left, with the Flowing Gold Fire Bell, shall illuminate and protect the Central Yellow. Let none be negligent. Upon your departure, your remote ancestor You is appointed Attendant of the Jade Void; your great-grandfather Ying, Grand Guardian of the Grand Tenuity; your grandfather Yu, Registrar of the Supreme Ultimate; your father Su, Immortal Official of the Central Marchmount. Your residence is named the Left Mansion of the Immortal Court."*

The Jade True Lord said, "Though your disciples are many, only six may accompany you. The rest shall each have their own day of ascension and may not join you." He then bowed to the Perfected Lord.

The Perfected Lord mounted the dragon chariot, with Chen Xun and Shi He bearing the registers in the lead, Zhou Guang and Zeng Heng driving, Huang Renlan and his clan following, and Xu Lie with his mother and a retinue of forty-two immortal kin ascending together. Even their parrot and dog soared after them. The villagers, clinging in sorrow, threw themselves to the ground in lamentation, unable to bear the parting. The Perfected Lord said, "Our paths diverge, and grief is natural. Uphold filial piety and benevolence, revere Heaven and Earth—what cause is there to fear no reward?" He left behind a meditation bell and a stone casket, saying, "As the world changes and times shift, this shall serve as a sign for future ages."

A servant named Xu Da, who had gone with his wife to buy rice at West Ridge, heard that the Perfected Lord was about to ascend. He rushed back in haste.

In their haste, the cart overturned, scattering rice upon the ground—where it took root and sprouted, giving the place its present names: Overturned Cart Ridge and Sprouted Rice Town. By the time Xu Da arrived, he wept and begged to follow. The Perfected Lord, seeing that his destiny did not yet align with immortality, taught him the arts of an earthbound immortal, and he and his wife both withdrew into seclusion on West Mountain (for details, see *The Biography of Xu Da*).

Once the immortal procession had ascended, a mortar and pestle soon fell from the sky, along with a wheel hub, while a parrot’s cage plummeted ten *li* southeast of the residence—now called Parrot Perch Ridge, today the site of Chongyuan Abbey. Several mice also fell to the ground, their entrails dragging yet still alive, for they had once stolen and eaten the immortal elixir. Later, those who glimpsed them took it as an auspicious omen.

As the immortal chariot soared into the heavens, it vanished from sight, leaving only auspicious clouds and rosy mists filling the mountains and valleys. For a hundred *li* around, an extraordinary fragrance lingered, unwaning for a month.

Earlier, when the Perfected Lord had returned from Jingyang, he presented a bolt of Shu brocade as a token of sincerity to Mistress Chen. She fashioned it into a temple curtain. On the day of his ascension, it suddenly flew back, circling above his former residence for an entire day before vanishing into the clouds. Later, when the abbey was built, it was named *Wandering Curtain* in commemoration.

Long before, the Perfected Lord and Guo Pu had sought the Dao and chosen scenic sites, arriving at Bingwu Mountain in Yichun, where Wang Shu, son of the Prefectural Governor, welcomed them to stay in the West Pavilion. After some time, the Perfected Lord told Shu, "I see that you are fit to inherit my arts." He secretly imparted the immortal formulas, then added, "This place boasts elegant mountains and rivers, with a sacred spring flowing south of the path, a grotto-heaven before it, and the Yuan River below—it is well-suited for a Daoist sanctuary." Shu followed his advice. The Perfected Lord inscribed a celestial seal—the character *jing*—upon the wall before departing.

On the day of his ascension, a cloud-drawn plow passed overhead. Two azure-clad attendants descended to inform Shu: "We have been summoned by the Jade Emperor’s decree and come now to bid you farewell." Shu and his entire household gazed upward in reverence, praying for deliverance. The Perfected Lord leaned down and said, "Your immortal bones are not yet fully tempered, but you may prolong your years." He then bestowed a single stalk of celestial thatch, saying, "This thatch has a rare flavor. Planted here and consumed over time, it grants longevity. Its sweetness nourishes the flesh, its pungency the joints, its bitterness the *qi*, its saltiness the bones, its slipperiness the skin, and its sourness the sinews. Blend it with bitter wine and drink—it will surely prove effective." With these words, he took his leave.

Following their counsel, the Wang clan consumed the elixir as prescribed, each attaining a lifespan of a century. Today, the Jade Void Abbey in Linjiang Prefecture stands upon this very site, where the immortal thatch still endures.

Of the more than three hundred who accompanied the Perfected Lord in his wanderings, eleven—including Master Tonghao—distinguished themselves through merit and conduct. After the Perfected Lord’s ascension, the villagers and Jian, a descendant of his clan, established a shrine upon the spot. There, they inscribed the one hundred and twenty poems he had left behind onto bamboo slips, which they placed within a great calabash. Visitors would draw these slips to divine fortune or misfortune, calling them the "Sacred Lots." His bell, carriage, mortar, and pestle—all treasures—were enshrined within. Later, the shrine was expanded into an abbey and named *Youwei* ("Wandering Canopy") after the embroidered curtains that adorned it.

The people of Shu’s Jianyang Prefecture, eager to repay his virtue, competed to donate gold and silk, carrying bricks and tiles to rebuild the well in his honor. Each inscribed their names upon the bricks—though later, when the abbey was renovated, these were removed. A few remnants remain to this day.

During the reign of Emperor Yang of Sui, the rites fell into neglect, and the abbey soon fell into ruin. In the *Yongchun* era of Emperor Gaozong of Tang, Celestial Master Hu Huichao revived its construction. Emperor Minghuang of Tang later bestowed particular reverence upon it. Emperors Taizong, Zhenzong, and Renzong of Song each presented calligraphic gifts, while Zhenzong further dispatched envoys bearing incense, candles, floral offerings, ritual banners, and dancing effigies. He renamed the abbey *Yulong* ("Jade Exaltation"), drawing from the *Scripture of Salvation*: *"The Great Release, the Jade Exaltation, Soars Victorious to Heaven."* He also forbade logging in the sacred mountains and exempted the land from taxes and corvée labor. An official was appointed to oversee the abbey, designating it a place of honor for venerable ministers.

Emperor Huizong later conferred a jade tablet and an exalted title, with the prayer text for the offering rite reading:

*"In the second year of Zhenghe, the cyclical year *renchen*, the fifth month, the *dingsi* day of the new moon, the seventeenth day, *guiyou*, the Emperor, in his sacred name, respectfully dispatches Cheng Qi of the Inner Court’s Palace Domestic Service to invite twenty-one Daoist priests to conduct a seven-day ritual at Hongzhou’s Jade Exaltation Abbey. Upon its conclusion, a grand offering of one altar and three hundred sixty divine stations shall be established. We humbly invoke the Perfected Lord of Wondrous Aid and Divine Merit: Though the utmost spirit defies form and eludes naming, its accomplished virtue resides in humanity. Thus, we follow the signs you have shown, honoring and exalting your traces. We now offer this first tribute of reverent praise, praying that you deign to accept our devotion and forever bless this sacred land."*

The undersigned, with utmost reverence and trepidation, prostrates in earnest supplication. Humbly submitting these words:

The sacred scripture and proclamation bestowed by Your Imperial Majesty for the Perfected Lord have been reverently received. We, your servant, now invoke the exalted Perfected Ones, inaugurating the display of their manifest traces. Gazing toward the celestial vault above, we present our devotion within this numinous sanctuary. As the blessings of bounty descend, the people’s fortune shines resplendent. May these graces extend further, prolonging the splendor of this reign. Your servant, with unwavering sincerity and fervent devotion, prostrates in utmost reverence.

We respectfully present this memorial to make known our plea.

Your servant, with profound awe and trepidation, bows his head and speaks with utmost sincerity.

The text of the jade scripture reads:

In the second year of Zhenghe, the year *renchen*, the fifth month, the *dingsi* day of the new moon, the seventeenth day, *guiyou*, the Emperor again bows and declares:

Heaven’s favor is abundant, bestowing grace upon the four directions. There exists a Perfected One, who assists the Supreme Emperor, wielding awe-inspiring virtue and power, granting prosperity and peace. Yet without a proclaimed name and title, how can the rites of reverence be fully manifested? Thus, We command the relevant offices to examine the secret registers, to expound upon the hidden virtues, and to transmit them for endless generations.

We reflect upon the Perfected Lord, who personally grasps the primordial chart, secretly aligning with the wondrous Dao. From the Wei to the Jin dynasties, his illustrious spirit has shone brilliantly. He relieves the destitute and heals the afflicted, upon whom an entire region relies. He vanquishes malevolent forces and poisons, harmonizing the three qi. Thus, he received the celestial mandate, his name inscribed in the registers of the capital’s immortals. Ascending beyond the highest realms, his legacy endures through the ages. His temple image stands majestic, his virtuous influence as if still present. Like the radiant sun, his glory shines, aligning with the flourishing of the imperial destiny. Auspicious omens descend, revealing his hidden assistance. Through prayers and exorcisms, his responses echo, bringing abundance and peace to the people.

It is fitting to bestow upon him the most exalted title, to manifest our solemn reverence.

We respectfully dispatch Wang Jian, Gentleman for Court Service, Compiler of the Jixian Hall, Administrator of Hongzhou’s Military and Civil Affairs, Concurrent Commissioner of Agriculture for the Region, Concurrent Military Commissioner of the Jiangnan West Circuit, Defender-in-Chief, and recipient of the Purple Gold Fish Bag, to confer the honorific title: *Perfected Lord of Wondrous Aid and Divine Merit*.

May the Perfected Lord deign to witness this, graciously accepting this grand decree, granting us boundless protection and preserving this glorious mandate. May he bring radiant harmony to the realm and bestow blessings upon all people.

Respectfully submitted.

In the sixth year of the Zhenghe reign, the temple was elevated to the status of a palace.

The Perfected Lord’s numinous efficacy and manifest proofs have been manifold. Having repeatedly received imperial favor, the details of these events are recorded in the *Records of the Xiaoyao Mountain Yulong Wanshou Palace*. Your servant Daoyi states:

The Grand Scribe Xu renounced official glory to devote himself to the Daoist arts. To succor the people, he employed talismanic water and incantations; to eliminate harm, he slew dragons and serpents. His merits complete and his practice perfected, he ascended to the ranks of immortality. Yet among his village and kin, he was known for his filial piety and fraternal love, while his companions admired his virtue and righteousness. Adapting to circumstances and responding to all things, he differed not from ordinary men—save that where he dwelled, cranes would cry and soar, and auspicious clouds would spiral about.

In his official career, his governance was worthy of note; in his reclusion, he cultivated the elixir within while blending with the world without. Truly, he was a hero among divine immortals.

The *Daodejing* says: "The Dao is empty, yet its use is inexhaustible. Profound! It seems the ancestor of the myriad things. Blunting its sharpness, unraveling its tangles, harmonizing its brilliance, uniting with the dust. Submerged, it seems to endure. I know not whose child it is—it appears before the Lord on High."

The Grand Scribe Xu attained this.

Wu Meng, styled Shiyun, was a native of Puyang. He served as Magistrate of Xi’an in Wu, and later settled there—this is present-day Fennin County. His nature was supremely filial: in his youth, during summer months, he would not drive away mosquitoes, fearing they might leave him only to bite his parents. At forty, he received esoteric formulas from the perfected one Ding Yi, and later studied under Bao Shuo, Prefect of Nanhai, from whom he obtained secret methods. During the Huanglong era of Wu, heaven descended a white-cloud talisman to him, and he thereafter widely propagated his arts of the Dao throughout Wu and Jin.

During the reign of Emperor Wu of Jin, the Perfected Lord Xu received transmission of the teachings from Shiyun, who imparted all his secret essentials to him. At the end of the Yongjia era, Du Qiang rebelled in Shu, overrunning its prefectures and counties. After the Perfected Lord had slain the great serpent, Shiyun said, “The serpent was the spirit of Shu; with its death, Du Qiang will perish.” And so it came to pass.

Once, as a violent gale arose, he inscribed a talisman and cast it onto the roof. A green bird carried it away, and the wind immediately ceased. When asked the reason, he replied, “On South Lake, a boat was caught in this storm, and two Daoist priests cried out to heaven for deliverance. Thus I halted it.” Investigation confirmed his words.

When Magistrate Yu Qing of Xi’an died and had lain three days, Shiyun said, “The magistrate’s allotted years are not yet spent; I shall plead his case before heaven.” He then performed rites beside the corpse, and after several days, both he and Qing arose together. Yu Qing’s younger brother, the Gentleman of Writing Bao, moved by this marvel, composed the *Soushen Ji*, which circulated in the world.

Once, while crossing the Yuzhang River, he encountered wind and waves that left no boat serviceable. Shiyun drew upon the water with his white feather fan and crossed over, to the astonishment of onlookers.

The *Book of Jin* states: Wu Meng was a native of Yuzhang. From youth, he was filial, never driving away mosquitoes in summer, lest they leave him to bite his parents. At forty, the villager Ding Yi first transmitted to him esoteric formulas. Returning to Yuzhang, where the river’s currents ran swift and deep, Meng crossed without boat or oar, drawing upon the water with a white feather fan, to the wonder of all who saw.

In the second year of Ningkang of Emperor Xiaowu of Jin, the Perfected Lord ascended. Shiyun then returned to Xi’an. On the fifteenth day of the tenth month that year, the Celestial Thearch commanded the Perfected Zhou Guang to bear an edict summoning Shiyun. He then mounted a white-deer carriage and, with four disciples, ascended in broad daylight. His abode was named the Purple Cloud Palace—now the Wu Immortal Temple of Peaceful Repose in Wu Immortal Village, Fennin County.

In the second year of Zhenghe of Emperor Huizong of Song, by imperial decree he was enfeoffed as Perfected Immortal. The edict read: “In the blessed land of Hongdu, among the perfected of the Purple Palace, your numinous wonders are renowned—how could honors be withheld? You early pursued the supreme Dao, awakened to secret words, and spread transformative teachings, earning the world’s name of ‘Compassionate Father.’ With merits complete, you ascended to the celestial realm.”

To the west of the Great River, his former abode still stands, where every prayer meets response, and our people find refuge. Bestowing this new enfeoffment serves to manifest his illustrious virtue. Our decree is just, and may it be witnessed herewith. Let him be specially enfeoffed as Perfected Immortal of Divine Might.

Chen Xun
Chen Xun, styled Xiaoju, was a native of Shu. Learned and widely informed, he lived when Wei dispatched Zhong Hui and Deng Ai to conquer Shu, and Liu Shan surrendered. Though still young, Xiaoju already harbored aspirations beyond the dusty world. He entered Mount Qingcheng and sought the method of transcending the world from Master Gu Yuanzǐ. Later, hearing of Perfected Xu’s benevolent governance in Jingyang, he hastened to the public court, wishing to serve as a scribe. Perfected Xu commended him and entrusted him with clerical duties. In leading his peers, transforming local customs, and practicing the art of nurturing the people, he contributed greatly. Thus, he was drawn into the master’s inner circle as a disciple and confidant. He oversaw the scriptures and guarded the alchemical furnace. When Perfected Xu ascended, he was commanded to hold the reins and lead the way. Formerly, to the west of Yulong Palace in Xima stood Xiaoju’s hermitage, named the Mansion of Inheriting Immortality, where he planted a great cypress. The hermitage faced north. In the second year of Zhenghe of Emperor Huizong of Song, he was enfeoffed as Perfected Immortal of Upright Distinction. The edict read in part: “For you early devoted yourself with sincerity, serving the Dao Lord as your master. Among his disciples, you alone were entrusted with the arcane mysteries. With merits complete, you ascended bearing the banner. To the west of the Great River, your legacy endures, akin to the edict of Perfected Wu.”

Zhou Guang
Zhou Guang, styled Huichang, was a native of Luling and a descendant of the great general Zhou Yu. From youth, he delighted in the study of astronomy and music; in maturity, he mastered the teachings of primordial purity and stillness. Once, while traveling with like-minded companions in Mount Yuntai of Bashu, he obtained the Han Celestial Master’s method for expelling noxious qi and malevolent spirits, thereby relieving the people’s suffering. Hearing of Perfected Xu’s presence in Jingyang, he journeyed directly to the public court, wishing to serve in a humble capacity. Perfected Xu accepted him and assigned him to attend to his staff and sandals. Diligent day and night, he practiced the Daoist methods without cease. Upon returning to his private residence, he remained ever obedient. Then, a hundred paces west of his home, he built a chamber to dwell in.

When Perfected Xu ascended in flight, Hui-chang and Zeng Xingguo together harnessed the dragon carriage. His residence was named the Xuan Zhao Palace. During the Tai-zhong reign of the Tang, the prefectural governor Zhou, styled Lord Shaozhen, honored him as an ancestor and renovated his dwelling, renaming it the Xuan Zhao Palace. The stele inscription remains extant; today it is called the Tai Xu Abbey. In the second year of Zhenghe of Emperor Huizong of the Song, he was enfeoffed as Perfected Yuan Tong. The decree read in part: "For you early aligned with the mountain’s embrace, serving the immortal lord as master. Your primordial transformation communicated with the divine, enabling you to attain the Dao. With meritorious practice now complete, you ascend together to the imperial realm. West of the great river, your former precincts stand solemn, their beginning and end echoing the decree of Lord Hao."

Zeng Heng
Zeng Heng, styled Xingguo, was a native of Sishui and a descendant of Zeng Can. From youth he was a Daoist, endowed with keen intelligence and broad learning. He cultivated the teachings of the Three Celestial Masters and could foresee future events. Every path through the famed mountains and sacred peaks lay open to him. His wondrous formulas and efficacious talismans cured all ailments without fail. The divine man Sun Deng, upon seeing him, declared: "Your bones are refined, your spirit astute; through diligent tempering of your essence, you shall surely become a being beyond the heavens. Strive onward." Later, he withdrew to reside in Fengcheng of Yuzhang. Hearing of Perfected Xu’s renown, he presented himself at his gate, wishing to attend to his towels and desk. Perfected Xu esteemed him greatly, transmitting to him without reserve all esoteric methods and secret formulas. Later, he too ascended to heaven in a dragon carriage. Today, the Zhen Yang Abbey in Fengcheng County marks his former abode. In the second year of Zhenghe of Emperor Huizong of the Song, he was enfeoffed as Perfected Shen Hui. The decree read in part: "For your refined bones and divine intelligence, your heaven-endowed exceptional bearing, serving the immortal lord as master, you harmonized elegantly with the Dao. With meritorious practice now complete, you journey together to the imperial realm. West of the great river, your altars and wells remain, their beginning and end echoing the decree of Lord Hao."

Shi He
Shi He, styled Daoyang, was a native of Julu.

In his youth, he became a Daoist and entered the Four Bright Mountains, where he encountered a divine being who taught him the arts of embryonic breathing and myriad wondrous techniques. Through these, he could dispel sleep and abstain from grain, command ghosts and spirits, expel malevolent specters, transmute gold and jade, and relieve the impoverished. The people received his beneficence, and his fame spread far and near.

During the reigns of Emperors Hui and Huai, hearing of Perfected Xu’s filial piety and the flourishing of his teachings east of the Yangtze, Shi He journeyed on foot to his door, wishing to become his disciple. Perfected Xu accepted him and transmitted secret formulas. Later, he sent Shi He back to the mountains to instruct his followers. Emperor Ming of the Jin summoned him to court, but when the master questioned him, Shi He steadfastly refused to remain. He ultimately returned to attend by Perfected Xu’s side.

In the second year of Emperor Xiaowu’s Ningkang era, he ascended to heaven in the company of Chen Xiaoju, bearing the imperial册 and leading the procession. His former abode in Yuzhang City was named the Purple Canopy Palace, now the county hall of Nanchang. The Fengxian Abbey in Muyang County of Donghai marks his earlier retreat.

In the second year of the Song’s Zhenghe era, he was enfeoffed as Perfected Hong Shi. The decree read in part: "For your lineage from Donghai, long esteemed as a family of immortals, you found your own master and attained the grand model. Preceding the dragon standards, you ascended together. West of the great river, your former residence remains, its beginning and end echoing the decree of Lord Hao."

Gan Zhan
Gan Zhan, styled Bowu, was a native of Fengcheng.

For his filial piety, he was esteemed among his village and kin. Amidst the chaos of the age, he concealed himself in the wilds and marshes, drawn to the arts of divine transcendence and long life. Hearing of Perfected Xu’s practice of filial virtue and the Daoist arts—eradicating harm and benefiting all beings—he journeyed to his gate and earnestly entreated, wishing to serve as his attendant. Perfected Xu, recognizing his exceptional talent and bearing, granted his request. When Perfected Xu ascended, he further entrusted him with the secret formulas of the Golden Elixir.

Later, Bowu returned to Fengcheng, where he spread virtue and bestowed kindness. In the first year of Emperor Xuān’s Dajian era, on the seventh day of the first month at noon, a celestial decree descended, and he mounted a qilin-drawn carriage, riding the clouds away. The present Qingdu Abbey in the county marks the site where he once concealed his elixir. His former residence, named Huayang Pavilion, has the Feihuang Abbey dedicated to his veneration.

In the second year of Emperor Huizong’s Zhenghe era, he was enfeoffed as Perfected Jingxing. The decree read in part: "From your youth, you devoted yourself to the Daoist teachings; in maturity, you served the Immortal Lord. Driving out demons and dispelling evil, your merits were abundant. With consummate conduct, you ascended to wander in the imperial realm. West of the great river, your former residence remains, its beginning and end echoing the decree of Lord Hao."

Shi Cen
Shi Cen, styled Taiyu, was a native of Pei Commandery. His grandfather, Shi Shuo, had served in Wu and thus relocated to Chiyu County in Jiujiang. Taiyu possessed a commanding and heroic appearance, unmatched strength and valor, and excelled in archery and swordsmanship. When Perfected Xu first led his disciples to slay the great serpent of Haihun, over three hundred stalwarts from the village arrived to assist, and Taiyu was among them. He presented himself with reverence and sincerity, offering to serve. Perfected Xu accepted him, and he, along with Gan Bowu, often stood wielding swords at his side.

On the morning of the twenty-eighth day of the tenth month in the second year of Ningkang of Emperor Xiaowu of Jin, a youth was seen in the eastern sunrise, riding upon multicolored clouds, holding a white staff, and driving a green ox, descending to his dwelling. He proclaimed the Jade Emperor’s decree, then ascended upon a green rainbow and rode the clouds away. Two *li* southeast of Perfected Xu’s residence stood an altar called the Purple Jade Palace—this was the place where he had dwelled. On the western ridge, by the riverbank, a stone bore an inscription reading "Utmost Virtue," which served as Taiyu’s watchtower. A similar site existed in Nanchang, both used to observe water demons. Later, the Tang immortal Shi Jianwu retreated here to fish, and the place thus became known as the Fishing Terrace. In the second year of Zhenghe of Emperor Huizong of Song, Taiyu was enfeoffed as the Perfected of Courageous Awakening. The edict read in part: "By your nature brave and awakened, you received the master’s transmission of the profound teaching, enabling you to enter the inner chamber. A divine youth revealed the wondrous, and you ascended to the imperial realm. West of the great river, your former residence remains, its beginning and end echoing the decree of Lord Hao."

Peng Kang
Peng Kang, styled Wuyang, was a native of Lanling.

Peng Kang was nominated as Filial and Incorrupt and served the Jin, rising through the ranks to become Left Assistant Director of the Imperial Secretariat. He diligently cultivated the Daoist arts and resigned from court due to illness. He became a disciple of the Perfected Lord Xu, and his beloved daughter was betrothed to the Perfected Lord’s son—though the old claim that Peng’s daughter became the Perfected Lord’s consort is mistaken. The elders referred to her as the Perfected Lord’s daughter-in-law, which is correct. When the Perfected Lord, during the final years of Emperor Huai’s Yongjia era, transformed a charcoal-seller’s wife and executed the serpent, Peng Kang was already in office, seventy-six years of age—how could he have taken a wife at that time? It is often said that the Perfected Lord’s consort was Lady Zhou. Upon examining the *Eulogy on Filial Piety*, one finds a brilliant piece titled "Lady Historian Zhou’s Reply to Her Mother-in-Law of Xuyi," which may well be the consort’s humble self-designation as "Lady Historian." The *New Canon of Scriptures* mistakenly calls her the "Holy Mother." Moved by Peng Kang’s reverent sincerity, the Perfected Lord entrusted him with all the essential secrets in their finest detail and promptly sent him back to court.

In the second year of Emperor Mu’s Yonghe era, Peng Kang retired from office and journeyed south, bringing his family to reside in Yuzhang’s city. He returned to the Perfected Lord’s gate, inquiring morning and evening, and his mastery of the Dao grew ever more refined.

In the second year of Emperor Gaozu’s Yongchu era of the Liu Song dynasty, the *Record of Administrative Geography* dated the event to the twenty-fourth day of the eighth month in the second year of the Yixi era, when Peng Kang and his entire household of twenty-six ascended to heaven in broad daylight. The present Zonghua Abbey in the capital is the site of this ascension.

In the second year of Emperor Huizong’s Zhenghe era of the Song dynasty, Peng Kang was enfeoffed as Perfected Person of Latent Benevolence. The imperial edict read in part: "For you renounced fame and forsake profit, cultivating in seclusion and refining within. You exhausted your sincerity in serving your master and were entrusted with the essential secrets. As your merit and practice neared completion, you ascended to the celestial realm. West of the Great River, your former residence still stands, where the immortal’s chamber and sacred altar remain in solemn array, as recorded in the imperial edict for Master Hao of Junzhuo."

Xu Lie
Xu Lie, styled Daowei, was a native of Nanchang. Orphaned in youth, he served his mother with such filial devotion that it became widely known. His mother was in fact the elder sister of the Perfected Lord. The Perfected Lord had two sisters, and Xu’s mother was the eldest. As the *Record of Enduring Love* states: "Xu Junlie and Zhongli Junjia of Nanchang were nephews of Lord Xu." Thus, it is certain that Xu’s mother was the Perfected Lord’s sister. Seeing her widowed state, the Perfected Lord built a chamber for her several dozen paces west of his residence, where she and her son could daily hear the wondrous Dao. Whenever the Perfected Lord went out, Xu’s mother would manage his household affairs, and all immortal guests and reclusive visitors were received by her. As Celestial Master Hu Shi’s eulogy says: "I once came here," indicating he was a guest of Xu’s mother. Both mother and son received a decree from the Jade Emperor, and with their celestial retinue, they ascended to heaven. The Daoist abbey west of the wall is their former residence, now called the Mansion of Harmonious Rites.

In the second year of Emperor Huizong’s Zhenghe era, Xu Lie was enfeoffed as Perfected Person of Harmonious Tranquility. The imperial edict read in part: "For you studied the Perfected Lord’s Dao and awakened to the source of the Five Refinements. Your nature was serene and harmonious, moving in accord with the great transformation. In the end, you ascended to the celestial realm with your mother. West of the Great River, your former residence still stands, as recorded in the imperial edict for Master Hao of Junzhuo."

Zhongli Jia
Zhongli Jia, styled Gongyang and also Chaomu, was a native of Nanchang and the son of the Perfected Lord’s second sister. Orphaned in youth, his nature was simple and indifferent. The Perfected Lord once sighed that he possessed the capacity to receive the Dao, and so entrusted him with divine formulas to save and succor, and wondrous instructions to command and expel. When the Perfected Lord ascended to heaven, he first bestowed upon Zhongli Jia the gift of golden elixir. On the fifteenth day of the tenth month of that year, a jade carriage of azure radiance descended from heaven to welcome him. Gongyang bowed to the celestial music, mounted the carriage, and departed.

His former residence was at Xiyuan in Xiangyashan of Xinjian. There stands an abbey called Danling, where a stone mortar for alchemical drugs remains, now known as the Jade Mansion of Zhong. In the second year of Emperor Huizong’s Zhenghe era, Zhongli Jia was enfeoffed as Perfected Person of Universal Benevolence. The imperial edict read in part: "For you upheld the arts of refinement and cultivation, and excelled in the skills of talismans and prohibitions. Your universal benevolence extended near and far, and your merit and practice shone brightly. The Perfected Lord entrusted you with his instructions, and you ascended to wander in the celestial realm. West of the Great River, your former residence still stands, as recorded in the imperial edict for Master Hao of Junzhuo."

Huang Renlan
Huang Renlan, styled Ziting, was a native of Gao’an. His father, Huang Fu, styled Wanshi, was recommended as a Filial and Incorruptible Scholar and served as a censor. Ziting was of striking and elegant appearance, with a bearing both composed and far-reaching. The Perfected Lord gave his daughter to him in marriage, and Huang Renlan fully attained the Perfected Lord’s Dao. When he took office as an attendant in Qingzhou, he left his wife to serve his parents. Yet every night, he would return home, unbeknownst to others.

One evening, a servant reported that voices and laughter had been heard in the Lady Xu’s courtyard at night. His mother-in-law questioned her, and Lady Xu replied, "It was Huang Lang." His mother-in-law said, "My son is serving in office thousands of *li* away. How could he be here?" Lady Xu said, "He has already attained the immortal Dao and can traverse a thousand *li* in an instant. He warned me not to speak of it, so I dared not let you know." His mother-in-law said, "If that is so, let me see him."

That night, when Ziting returned, Lady Xu told him what had transpired. By dawn, Ziting had no choice but to present himself to his parents, saying, "Though Renlan serves in a distant office, he returns secretly every night to attend you. The immortal Dao is secret and must not be spoken of, lest it bring calamity and trouble." Having spoken, he took a bamboo staff and transformed it into a green dragon, mounting it to depart.

Thereafter, Wanshi also came to know and admire the immortal Dao, and he served the Perfected Lord with the rites of a disciple. However, Ziting’s two younger brothers were bold and unrestrained, spending their days hunting. Though their father and brother received the imperial decree and ascended in flight, the two remained at their hunting grounds. They declared that their natures were too unruly for immortality, and begged to be allowed to continue hunting deer while their elder brother’s entire clan soared away. Ziting sighed at their allotted fate and transformed a blade of grass into a deer to curb their reckless hearts.

Then, with his parents and a household of thirty-two, he rode the clouds eastward, following the Perfected Lord’s immortal procession to ascend to heaven. The two younger brothers later concealed themselves on West Mountain—now the Fangang Temple, where they are popularly called the Fourth and Fifth Lords of the Huang Clan.

After the immortal procession departed, a stone ball and a mortar for alchemical drugs fell from the clouds at Xiangfu Abbey in Gao’an County of Ruizhou. This was once the Abbey of Prayers to the Immortals, and Huang Renlan’s former residence. Nearby lies the Isle of Lady Xu’s Fallen Hairpin.

In the second year of Emperor Huizong’s Zhenghe era, Huang Renlan was enfeoffed as Perfected Person of Penetrating the Dao. The imperial edict read in part: "For you held to the arts of refinement and cultivation, and your virtue and power extended universally. Your merit and practice were illustrious. The Perfected Lord entrusted you with his instructions, and you ascended to wander in the celestial realm. West of the Great River, your former residence still stands."

The edict continued in part: "As you inherited the blessings of Chuping, you were endowed with extraordinary gifts. You served the Dao Lord as your master, mastering the most profound mysteries. No sooner had your merit and practice reached fulfillment than you ascended to wander in the imperial realm. West of the Great River, your former residence still stands, its beginning and end alike recorded in the imperial decrees of the House of Hao.

Renlan’s father, Fu, also sought to become a disciple of the Perfected Lord. The Perfected Lord, considering him a kinsman of honor, treated him with the courtesy due a guest, and thus he was not counted among the eleven disciples. All the disciples who received the teachings were permitted to transmit them to their clans. Altars and oratories were established, each bearing the names of *fu* and *ting*. The great ritual of the teaching states: the *fu* is the lesser ritual, the *ting* the greater. In practicing the Dao and its methods, they are named according to the number of participants.

Long ago, there was an extraordinary person named Lan Qi, whose given name none dared speak, and so he was called Master Lan. He first resided in Jiuyuan Village of Gaoping Township, Qufu County in Yanzhou. His family of over a hundred members cultivated filial piety with utmost devotion, prompting a Perfected One from the Dipper to descend into their home. He called himself the Filial and Fraternal King, with the taboo name Hongkang and the style Bozhong. He said to Master Lan: 'The primordial *qi* is the Great Dao. In the sun, it becomes the Dao of Filial Piety; the primordial *qi* of the Immortal Kings is the Supreme Dao. In the moon, it becomes the Filial Dao Radiant King; the mysterious *qi* is the Dao of Filial Piety. In the Dipper, it becomes the Filial and Fraternal King. When filial piety reaches heaven, the sun and moon shine brightly. When it reaches earth, the myriad things are born. When it reaches the people, the kingly Way is accomplished. From the Upper Clarity downward, I have manifested in the human realm to expound the teaching of filial piety. In later generations of the Jin dynasty, there will be a true immortal, Xu Xun, who will transmit the lineage of my filial Dao and become the leader of all immortals.'

Thereupon, he bestowed upon Master Lan secret instructions, the *Precious Canon of the Golden Elixir*, and bronze talismans and iron charters, commanding him to transmit them to the female Perfected Chen Mu of Huangtang Oratory in Danyang. He further admonished him: 'In the future, when the aspiring immortal Xu Xun appears, you must transmit these to him.'

The Filial and Fraternal King then led Master Lan to wander in the outskirts. By the roadside, three ancient tombs suddenly appeared. Pointing to them, he said to Master Lan: 'These are the traces of your three past lives’ transformations. The first tomb holds the immortal remains you left behind after liberation in the corpse. The second tomb is where you refined your form in the Great Yin; your body is now complete and will soon rise. The third tomb contains only your discarded bones. You should move it away from the roadside to prevent people and animals from treading upon it.' Having spoken, the Filial and Fraternal King ascended to heaven.

Master Lan then posted a notice to travelers, blocking the old path. People called him deluded and reckless for altering the road, and they seized him to bring before the authorities. The officials detained him and demanded proof of his claims. Master Lan recounted the previous events in full. The officials said: 'If your words are false, you will be executed.' Master Lan replied: 'My words come from the Filial and Fraternal King—how could they be false?'

The officials then led Master Lan to the site to open the tombs in their presence. The first tomb indeed contained a yellow robe. The second revealed a person with the complexion of a child and a delicate frame, as if just awakened from sleep. The third held a set of interconnected bones. The crowd was astonished, and the officials took the robe to present to the prefect. The prefect tried to wear it, but it was too large for him, so he returned it to Master Lan. When Master Lan donned it, he merged with the person from the tomb, his body refined and light, ready to ascend.

The officials, filled with remorse, prostrated themselves and earnestly asked when he would descend to the human realm again. Master Lan leaned down and said: 'From now on, I may descend every ten days or every hundred days to propagate the Dao of Filial Piety and aid those lost on the path.' Thereafter, in the capital of Wu, a fifteen-year-old youth appeared, and in Danyang, a three-year-old divine child—both were incarnations of true immortals, come to propagate the teaching of filial piety and transmit it to those destined for transcendence.

Your servant Daoyi says: Lan Qi cultivated the truth across lifetimes, his mind never straying from the Dao. His devotion moved a Perfected One from the Dipper to descend and expound the Dao of Filial Piety, opening the way for future generations. Among those who attained the status of true immortals, none exemplified sincerity more than Lan Qi. Beholding the traces of his three lives’ transformations, one is vividly moved. As for the wondrous union of form and spirit, the refinement of the body, and the lightness of ascension—these were achieved through a single sincerity spanning four lifetimes. The Dao of immortality was ultimately perfected, how could this be the work of a single day’s merit and practice?

The *Daode Jing* says: 'One who does not lose their place endures. One who dies yet does not perish is long-lived.' Does this not speak of Lan Qi?

Xu [Xun] the Great..."

Xu Da was a servant in the retinue of the Perfected Lord. On the day the Perfected Lord ascended, Xu Da and his wife happened to be transporting rice to the market—now called West Ridge Market—when they heard of their master’s ascent. They overturned their rice cart and rushed home. By the time they arrived, the immortal procession had already departed. The couple beat their breasts and wailed, begging to follow. The Perfected Lord told them their merit was not yet complete and they were unfit for ascension, but he bestowed upon them the arts of earthbound immortality. The two then concealed themselves in the Western Mountains. The rice spilled from their overturned cart took root in the earth, and the place is now called Overturned Cart Ridge and Sprouted Rice Market. After going into seclusion, they wished to remain unknown and changed their surname to Wu. When this was discovered, they altered it again to Gan.

Both left poems for the world. Gan Jun’s poem reads:
*Since the Bright Prefect ascended to the heavens,*
*I have wandered the mortal realm to this day.*
*Not to hide my name and blend with the vulgar,*
*But selling firewood and buying wine, I forget worldly cares.*

His wife’s poem says:
*Drunk, I dance and sing amidst fallen blossoms,*
*My green silk skirt bears traces of cinnabar.*
*Coming and going through the city, I sell herbs—*
*Only these Western Mountains are my home.*

Another of her poems:
*Entering and leaving the immortal realm, I forget the seasons,*
*How could I know the world’s cold and warmth?*
*My home lies only within the Western Mountains—*
*None but white clouds ever reach my door.*

When Gan Jun traveled and did not return for some time, she walked alone to the altar platform and, moved by emotion, composed this verse:
*Yesterday I wandered to the emerald peaks,*
*Where altar bells chimed amid sparse apricot blossoms.*
*The green peach tree bore my message—*
*Why does no one return from the mortal world?*

When Xu and his wife heard the Perfected Lord was about to ascend, they desperately begged to accompany him. The Perfected Lord, bound by celestial decree, explained that the number of those permitted to ascend was already fixed and their request could not be granted. Thus, he had arranged for them to be away beforehand. Though they overturned their cart and hurried back, it was already too late. Even now, some claim to have seen them.

The *Records of Divine Investigations* states: In the Western Mountains of Hongzhou, there was a woodcutter who called himself Gan Da. None knew his true name. He would occasionally appear in the villages, greeting people with clasped hands but never speaking a word. If anyone tried to question him, he would bow and depart.

A young man once awaited his appearance and bowed to him, saying, "I wish to serve you, Master." Gan Da was startled and tried to leave, but the youth hastily grasped his coarse robe and followed him. Gan Da asked, "What do you want?" The youth replied, "I wish to serve you, Master," bowing repeatedly as they walked. They traversed perilous and desolate paths without pause. After some time, Gan Da sat by a mountain stream and asked, "Would you like some tea?" The youth assented. Gan Da then loosened his robe, took out tea powder, placed it in the youth’s palm, and instructed him to scoop water and swallow it. When the youth finished and looked up, Gan Da had vanished. He searched for the woodcutter’s path and emerged, finding himself in the territory of Fennin County. Several days later, he returned home. From then on, the youth felt light and vigorous, free from illness.

Master Celestial Hu Huichao, styled Basu, was of unknown origin. No one knew his age. During the *Shangyuan* era of Emperor Gaozong of Tang, he came from Mount Lu and settled at Hongjing in the Western Mountains of Yuzhang. Clad in a simple cloth headscarf and hempen robe, he walked barefoot, staff in hand.

Upon arriving at Youwei Abbey, he met his fellow Daoists, yet his hands held no ritual tablet—only a raised fist in greeting. His beard and brows were fine, his bearing majestic, resembling a man of some forty years. Though not exceptionally tall, whenever he stood among crowds, his head alone rose above the rest; even the tallest men reached only to his shoulders. Thus, the people of the time called him "Tall Immortal Hu." When asked his age, he would say, "Fifty-two years." Decades later, the same answer was given. Yet when he spoke of the rise and fall of dynasties since the Jin and Song, not a single detail was amiss. He delighted in discussing the writings of Jin Minister Zhang Hua, whose encyclopedic knowledge he matched as a friend might. Some said that Masters Xu and Wu had once taught him the arts of longevity, refinement, and transformation—the Way of the Three Primes and Nine Cycles—enabling him to summon spirits, command thunder, and summon rain.

When Tao Hongjing collated the *Seventy Scrolls of the Supreme Clarity Scripture* at Huayang Cave on Mount Mao, the Celestial Master likewise participated. His name was inscribed in vermilion on the seams of the scrolls, visible to all who beheld them. He once remarked, "When I first came here, I lodged with an old woman named Xu Mu—yet I know not from what age she hailed." Whenever he encountered exposed bones or abandoned remains by the roadside, he would bury them. Where ancient treasures or sacred vessels lay buried, excavation would yield them just as he had foretold. He despised malevolent spirits and monstrous beings as one would a bandit or hawk, and was swift to eradicate them.

At the time, a camphorwood spirit near the western gate of Yuzhang had become a one-legged deity, wreaking havoc with its sorcery and luring people into lewd sacrifices. The Celestial Master, upon seeing it, rebuked and cursed it, then inscribed a talisman to bind it. He ordered the tree felled, stacked with firewood, drenched in oil, and set ablaze. The demonic haunting ceased, and the site became the abbey formerly known as Xinguo; its plaque now reads Tianqing.

Once, while visiting Youwei Abbey, he found it in ruins from the early Tang. When he asked the abbot why it had not been restored, the reply was a lack of resources. The Celestial Master strode forth resolutely and, within a month, had timber bundles delivered. At the mouth of Zhangmu River in Gao’an—ninety *li* from the abbey—he commanded raftsmen to lash the logs tightly and moor them by the riverbank. As dusk fell, he cast a black talisman, and by midnight, a fierce storm of wind and thunder raged. By dawn, the bundles lay at the abbey’s foundation. Along the route through the ridges and valleys, the forest trees were swept aside, broken and felled.

He also unearthed a vault at the foot of the mountain, yielding three hundred thousand coins to fund labor and supplies. For structures unfit for human habitation, he employed ghosts and spirits to work through the night. Outside the gates, three wells were dug to avert fire disasters—commonly called "Fire-Prohibiting Wells"—and indeed, Yongyuan County has since been free of fires.

In time, his extraordinary deeds became widely known. During the reign of Emperor Gaozong of Tang, he happened to visit the capital and was summoned to exorcise fox demons from Shouchun Palace, for which he was granted the title *Master of Cavernous Truth*. Later, Empress Wu dispatched envoys with a rush-wheeled carriage to summon him. The Celestial Master had long concealed himself in the mountains and valleys, but when local officials pressed their search, he had no choice but to emerge. Arriving in the capital, he was received at Wucheng Hall. The Empress inquired about immortal arts, yet the Celestial Master spoke only of the Dao, virtue, and the foundations of imperial governance. Delighted, she sought to retain him in the capital to oversee alchemical work, but he declined, requesting to return to his mountain retreat for cultivation. She then sent envoys bearing gold and jade to escort him home.

As he passed through Shanfu, she bestowed a letter upon him, which read: *"Master, your Dao and rank are lofty, having long transcended the mundane world—like Guangchengzi of ancient times or the River Earl of Han. Thus, you journeyed a thousand *li* to answer our summons in the Three Rivers. Now, as the sun rises first in the east, your cloud-borne robes fade into the distance; as the Heavenly Ford lies behind, your crane-borne canopy grows ever more remote."*

The winds and clouds of the empty terrace left her endlessly forlorn. Should the Master’s ninefold elixir yield a remnant, she longed for but a single pill. Thereupon, the Celestial Master refined his cinnabar at the ancient altar of Master Hongya, a labor spanning three years. An imperial edict hastened his summons to court, and upon arrival, he was lodged within the palace precincts. When he sought leave to return, the sovereign firmly denied his request. Yet one morning, the Master vanished without trace. The emperor, upon hearing the news, sighed in deep regret. He dispatched envoys bearing lavish gifts and a poem, which read:

*"The lofty man aligns with lofty aims,
In mountain garb he seeks his mountain home.
Far, far the wind and moon now drift apart,
Beyond the mists where rosy clouds are blown.
The azure peaks reveal the mystic grotto,
The jade cauldron refines the cinnabar’s glow.
Today, by Starry Ford, I lift my gaze,
Yearning for the sacred raft’s swift flow."*

The Celestial Master returned to West Mountain, dwelling at Xumu Jing. There stood the Three Clarities’ Central Gate, and the Hall of the Perfected Lords, which remains atop the old pavilion of the Immortal’s Well—all wrought by spirits’ craft. The beams and rafters, stacked to the ridge, bore cuts so precise that human hands might emulate, yet their upright stance, unwavering and enduring, surpassed mortal skill. The imperial plaque bore the reign title in vigorous calligraphy. He also painted his true likeness upon the rear hall’s wall.

During his residence on West Mountain, all deferred to him as master. For a thousand *li* around, no pestilence, drought, or flood brought suffering; no fierce beasts nor untimely deaths afflicted the land, and all near and far depended on his grace.

On the sixteenth day of the second month in the third year of the Chang’an era, he commanded his disciples to construct a brick tomb on Hidden Dragon Ridge northwest of the Wandering Canopy Abbey. Within were interred two *Tai Xuan* True Talismans, one Seven Stars Divine Sword, and one Numinous Treasure Staff. The work was completed in three days. The Celestial Master, clad in full regalia, sat upon a rope-strung couch as rare fragrance filled the chamber. From the void came the cries of cranes and clouds; beyond the walls, the clamor of men and horses swelled without cease. When they looked again, he had already shed his mortal form.

The prefecture reported the event, and the court bestowed funds for a grand offering rite, posthumously honoring him as Master of the Grotto’s Truth. Sima Zhen of Gusuzhen composed the stele, recording the details in full.

During the Kaiyuan era, the Celestial Master reappeared, earning the esteem of Emperor Minghuang, who sent him back to the mountains with a poem:

*"The immortal wearies of the mortal realm,
As lone clouds match his tranquil soul.
Unfinished, our parting words remain,
While mist and water stretch o’er myriad hills."*

It is also told that three of Minghuang’s princesses studied the Dao under him: the Eldest Princess Yuzhen, the Second Princess Yuzhen, and Princess Zhenyi. After attaining the Way, they all vanished into the Cavern of Soaring Simurghs. Their master, too, withdrew into seclusion.

The present Fulong Mountain’s Lingyun Abbey was where the Master resided upon his return to the mountains. The site where the princesses studied the Dao under him lies over ten *li* south of Lingyun, where three mounds rise from level ground. The place where the Master later concealed his sword, seal, and talismans is commonly called the Three Coffers and remains under the registry of Lingyun Abbey. His disciples and foremost students were many, the most eminent being Master Wan and Master Lan.

Linchuan’s Jing Mountain’s Huanghua Gu relates: At Weiguan Abbey, there was a mural of Master Hu’s true likeness. One day, as the wall threatened to collapse, a wandering *yunshui* Daoist suddenly arrived, traced the image onto wooden boards, and restored it to its former appearance. The next evening, the wall crumbled, and the Daoist vanished without a trace. The temple hall was rebuilt by imperial decree in the sixth year of Song Huizong’s Zhenghe reign, and the original mural was removed. Only the wooden replica remains today.

*Comprehensive Mirror of Perfected Immortals Through the Ages, Scroll Twenty-Eight*

**Wang Zuan**
Daoist Wang Zuan was a native of Jintan. He dwelled on Maji Mountain, ever practicing hidden merits to aid all beings. During the late Western Jin, as the Central Plains descended into chaos—famine, pestilence, and plague raging—many perished without succor. Moved by their plight, Zuan retired to his oratory, weeping as he submitted a flying memorial to Heaven.

Three days later, his chamber blazed with daylight brilliance. Soon, auspicious winds and rosy clouds swirled in the sky, while rare fragrances and celestial music descended into the courtyard. First came over thirty armored warriors, wielding golden weapons. Then, in swift succession, pearl-encrusted canopies, jeweled banners, rainbow streamers, and feathered standards appeared, borne by an entourage before and behind. Four azure youths held flowers and incense, while two attendants unfurled a cloud-brocade mat upon the ground. A towering screen stood at the fore, flanked by Dragon and Tiger Generals and their retinues—over twenty on each side—arrayed as if in solemn guard. Beyond them stood twenty-six armored generals and ten divine kings, their ranks as orderly as the Dragon and Tiger Lords’.

Suddenly, reed pipes and flutes sounded from the northwest, and five-colored auspicious radiance blazed forth. A figure bearing a sword and tablet stepped forward and announced to Zuan: “The Supreme Dao Lord has arrived.” At once, a throne of myriad treasures descended from the void. The Dao Lord sat upon it, attended by two Perfected Ones and two Heavenly Emperors. Zuan prostrated himself, kowtowing in reverence. The Dao Lord spoke: “You have pitied the living, expressing your plea in memorials, carving your heart and wiping your blood—moving both the seen and unseen realms. The Earth Bureau has reported your merit, and I have taken note of you.”

After Zuan offered his thanks, the Dao Lord continued: “The interplay of yin and yang nurtures the myriad things, with the Five Phases as their sovereign. The Five Phases vie in dominance, each waxing and waning in turn, their transformations ceaseless. Qi and life perpetuate one another without pause, unbroken since time immemorial. Those who attain life align with supreme yang, ascending to Heaven as immortals; those who meet death sink into supreme yin, becoming ghosts upon the earth. Among ghostly beings, there are gradations of strength and weakness, hardness and softness, goodness and evil—no different from the mortal world. The Jade Emperor, fearing the wanton harm wrought by ghosts and spirits, has charged the Five Emperors and the Three Officials with their regulation, ensuring that laws, commands, punishments, and statutes are clear and complete.

Yet in this degenerate age, the wellspring of purity has dispersed, and deceit and falsity arise daily. People disloyal to their lords, unfilial to their parents, violate the teachings of the Three Bonds and Five Constants, casting themselves into the realm of death. Thus, the followers of the Six Heavens’ Black Demons, along with the defeated generals and slain warriors of ages past—who once slaughtered the living—now ride the winds and rains, seizing upon weakness and opportunity to spread manifold diseases. Countless are those afflicted, even those who do not meet their allotted years, like Wang Jian and Bai Qi. Generals in life become commanders of troops in death; those who served well are promoted to yin officials, while the cruel and destructive remain among the demonic. They exploit the qi of the Five Phases’ decline, bringing plagues and pestilence. Yet I restrain them with the might of yang and subdue them with divine incantations, so they must ever be curbed.

Today, I bestow upon you the *True Tang Scripture of Pacifying Spirits and Transforming Demons* and the *Divine Incantation Scripture*, which I once conferred at the Duyang Palace. Practice them, and you may deliver the multitudes.” He then commanded an attendant to unroll the Nine Radiance Scroll, presenting the two scriptures along with the secrets of the Three and Five Grand Fasts. “Strive in your practice,” he said, “and hidden merit may be fulfilled, and the rank of Perfection attained.” With these words, the thousand chariots and ten thousand riders ascended to the northwest.

Zuan followed the scriptures’ teachings and disseminated the fasts’ rituals. From that time forth, no pestilence or plague arose south of the Yangtze.

**Shan Daokai**
Shan Daokai was a native of Dunhuang.

Shan Daokai customarily wore coarse robes, and though others often gifted him fine silks, he never donned them. He feared neither cold nor heat and remained awake day and night. He regularly ingested fine pebbles, swallowing several at a time, once daily—sometimes more, sometimes less. Fond of dwelling in mountains, he encountered spirits of all strange forms among the trees, yet his countenance never betrayed fear. During the reign of Shi Jilong, he traveled from Xiping, covering seven hundred *li* in a single day to reach Qinzhou. A memorial was sent to Ye, recorded in the *Records of Buddhist Teachings*: In the third year of Yonghe under Emperor Mu of Jin, the imperial astronomer reported to Jilong, “A star of immortals has appeared; a lofty adept is about to enter the realm.” Jilong pressured the prefectures to seek out extraordinary persons and report them. In the eleventh month, the Inspector of Qinzhou memorialized the arrival of Shan Daokai in Ye. Jilong ordered Fotucheng to converse with him, but could not humble him. Fotucheng remarked, “This Daoist observes the rise and fall of states. If he departs, great chaos will befall the land.” True to his words, as Jilong’s reign neared its end, Daokai crossed south to Xuchang, and soon after, Ye descended into turmoil.

In the third year of Shengping under Emperor Mu of Jin, he arrived in the capital, later journeying to Luofu Mountain in Nanhai. There, he dwelt alone in a thatched hut, detached from worldly concerns. Having lived over a hundred years, he passed away in his mountain abode. His disciples placed his body in a stone cavern, then later moved it to a stone chamber.

When Yuan Hong of Chen Commandery served as Prefect of Nanhai, he ascended Luofu Mountain and arrived at the mouth of the stone chamber. There, he beheld Shan Daokai’s remains, appearing as though still alive, with incense and earthenware vessels still present. Hong remarked, “The Master’s deeds and conduct stand apart from the multitude—this is truly the molting of a cicada.” He then composed a eulogy, as recorded in *The Book of Jin*.

Tang Zixi of Meishan in the Song Dynasty wrote in his preface: “Over thirty years after Ge Zhichuan’s transformation, Shan Daokai first came to Luofu. Today, those in the mountains know of Zhichuan but not of Daokai. For Zhichuan, having been detained by Deng Yue, resided on the mountain for years, refining elixirs and writing books, his alchemical furnace and cauldron still preserved. Daokai, however, consumed only a few small stones daily, remaining indifferent to worldly affairs. Thus, later generations could find no records of him.”

Though Yuan Hong of Chen Commandery composed a eulogy for Daokai, he had once written the *Nine Bestowments* for Huan Wen—how could such hands again engage in matters beyond the world? Moreover, his eulogy no longer survives. Therefore, two eulogies were inscribed in the mountain valleys, their locations left unmarked, to bequeath them to later seekers of the extraordinary.

The eulogy for Daokai reads:
Ordinary men chew the soft,
Yet spit out what is hard.
Scooping mushy rice,
Their mouths bellow like oxen.
The perfected forget things,
Hard and soft as one.
To them, eating stones
Is like consuming cakes.
The Northern Plain’s pearl-drinkers,
Acting without intent—
The principle of stone-eating
May be sought therein.
Though I cannot do the same,
I grasp its truth,
And may rinse with it
To whet my teeth.

From *Luofu Illustrated Records*.

Wang Jia
Wang Jia, styled Zinian, was a native of Anyang in Longxi.

Light of bearing yet coarse in appearance, he was witty and fond of jest. He ate no grains, wore no fine garments. Clad in black, serene and empty, he shunned the company of worldly men. He concealed himself in Shuyang Valley, carving a cave into the cliff to dwell within. His disciples numbered in the hundreds, all living in caverns. He claimed to ride six black dragons, guarding the Three Ones, and neither winter nor summer altered his robes—his complexion grew ever more youthful.

At the end of Shi Hu’s reign, he abandoned his followers and hid on Mount Zhongnan, building a thatched hut to stay. His disciples followed once more, so he moved to Daoshou Mountain. Scholars and admirers flocked to him, inquiring about worldly affairs, and he answered each question as it came. Fond of parables, he spoke as if in jest. His words foretold events yet to pass, his phrases like prophecies. None of his contemporaries understood, yet all came to pass. Those who sought him with sincerity saw him; those without sincerity found him invisible, his form concealed. His robes hung on the rack, his sandals and staff remained in place. Should one attempt to take his clothes, they could never reach them—the rack would rise higher, the room no larger. The same held for his sandals and staff.

Fu Jian of Qin repeatedly summoned him, but he refused. When Jian later launched a great southern campaign, appointing Mao Rong as grand general, he sent envoys to question Jia. Jia replied: *"Metal is firm, fire is strong."* Then, mounting the envoy’s horse, he straightened his robes and cap, slowly riding eastward for several hundred paces before whipping the horse into a gallop and returning. He stripped off his clothes, cast aside his cap and sandals, and went back inside. Dismounting, he sat upon his bed in silence. Jian, still perplexed, sent another envoy to ask about the fate of his reign. Jia said: *"Not yet ended."* Jian rejoiced, taking it as an auspicious omen. The following year, in the *guiwei* cycle, Jian suffered a crushing defeat at Shouchun and lost the state of Qin. *"Not yet ended"* referred to that year. Qin, ruling in the west, was metal; Jin, seated in the south, was fire—fire could melt metal.

Jia later moved to Mount Songgao. When Yao Chang and Fu Deng clashed, Chang asked Jia: *"If I kill Deng, will I secure the realm?"* Jia replied: *"You will roughly gain it."* Enraged, Chang snapped: *"If I gain it, I will say I have gained it—what is this ‘roughly’?"* He then executed Jia along with two disciples. Earlier, Chang had sent men to meet Jia and his two disciples on the Longyou road, over a thousand *li* away—it was the very day Jia was slain. Jia had sent a letter to Chang, who ordered the opening of Jia’s coffin and those of his two disciples. No corpses were found, only a bamboo staff in each.

Jia authored the *Records of Gleanings* in ten scrolls, filled with strange accounts, which circulated in the world.

Meng Qin
Meng Qin was a native of Luoyang.

Left Ci and Liu Gen possessed arts that drew the admiration and devotion of the common folk. Fu Jian summoned Meng Qin to Chang’an, and, displeased by his ability to delude the masses, ordered Fu Rong to execute him. Soon after, Qin arrived, and Rong detained him, hosting a grand feast for the officials. As the wine flowed freely, Rong signaled his attendants to seize Qin. Qin transformed into a whirlwind and flew beyond the hall. Shortly after, word came that he had been spotted east of the city, and Rong dispatched cavalry to pursue him. Though they nearly closed the distance, he was already far ahead. At times, armed forces barred their path, or streams and ravines blocked their way, and Qin vanished without a trace. In the final years of Jian’s reign, he reappeared in Qingzhou, where Fu Lang pursued him to a sea island.

Guo Zhisheng
Guo Zhisheng, styled Tongming, was a native of Zhuti Prefecture. During the reign of Emperor Yuan of Jin, he claimed to be four hundred years old, though he appeared no older than fifty. He carried two baskets filled with short scrolls of writings, which he bore on his back at all times. He often stayed at the home of Zhang Ji of Wuchang, where he would sigh: *"War and famine will soon spread their poison, and the living will find their coffins in ditches, their mourners in flies. This inevitable fate is heartbreaking to behold."* Two years later, Sun En’s rebellion erupted, and winter and summer alike saw slaughter and starvation—barely one in ten survived. Suddenly, he told Ji: *"My time has come. Prepare the coffin and funeral implements, but do not bury me. Instead, carry me to a mountain crag and weigh the coffin down with stones."* Shortly after, he died, and Ji followed his instructions precisely. Days later, a kinsman of Ji’s returned from Fuyang and saw Zhisheng riding a white deer through the mountains. Zhisheng sent a letter to Ji.

Guo Pu
Guo Pu, styled Jingchun, was a native of Hedong.

Guo Pu was deeply devoted to the classical arts, erudite and gifted, yet reticent in speech and discourse. His *fu* rhapsodies stood as the finest of the Jin restoration, and he was fond of ancient scripts and rare characters, excelling in the mysteries of yin-yang, divination, and calendrical astronomy. There was a certain Master Guo who dwelled as a guest in Hedong, mastering the arts of divination. Pu studied under him, and the master bestowed upon him nine scrolls from his green satchel. From then on, Pu penetrated the secrets of the Five Phases, celestial patterns, and the arts of divination—warding off disasters, averting misfortunes, and summoning blessings without limit. Even Jing Fang and Guan Lu could not surpass him.

Once, his disciple Zhao Zai stole the green satchel’s texts but had not yet read them when they were consumed by fire. During the reigns of Emperors Hui and Huai, Hedong was first to descend into chaos. Pu divined the coming calamity and fled southeast, seeking refuge with General Zhao Gu. At that time, the general’s prized steed had just died, and in his grief, he refused to receive guests. When Pu arrived, the gatekeeper did not announce him. Pu declared, *"I can revive the horse."* The gatekeeper, astonished, relayed this to Gu. The general rushed out and asked, *"Can you truly save my horse?"* Pu replied, *"Gather two or three dozen strong men, each with a long pole. Proceed thirty *li* east until you reach a wooded mound with a shrine. Strike the area with the poles, and you will find a creature—seize it at once and bring it back. With this, the horse will live."* Gu followed his instructions and indeed captured a creature resembling a monkey. As they returned, the beast approached the dead horse and exhaled into its nostrils. Moments later, the horse rose, shook itself, neighed, and began eating as before. The creature then vanished. Gu marveled and rewarded Pu generously.

After crossing the Yangtze, Wang Dao held Pu in high esteem and enlisted him as an advisor in his military affairs. When Emperor Yuan first established his court in Jianye, Dao had Pu divine the omens, and all his predictions proved accurate. Pu was promoted to Gentleman of Writing. At the time, the balance of yin and yang was disrupted, and punishments and trials proliferated. Pu submitted a memorial, stating: *"Those who revere the Way will enjoy fortune; those who grow arrogant will invite disaster. We must purge transgressions and promote yang while bestowing benevolence."* In the fourth year of Jianwu, on the *guihai* day of the third month, a dark spot appeared in the sun. Pu attributed this to the emperor’s excessive use of punishment, which had thrown yin and yang into disorder. Pardons, he argued, should not be granted too frequently. Yet, as Zichan’s casting of penal statutes—though not an ideal policy—was necessary to remedy abuses, so too was a pardon now warranted. Soon after, he was promoted to Gentleman of the Masters of Writing.

In the first month of the first year of Yongchang, Pu again submitted a memorial, urging a general amnesty to celebrate the birth of the imperial grandson. The emperor consented, and a great amnesty was declared, along with a change of era. Wang Dun appointed Pu as his Recorder and Military Advisor. Pu, skilled in divination, foresaw Dun’s inevitable rebellion and the calamity it would bring, and he grieved deeply. When the general Yuan Shu died, Pu wept with profound sorrow, saying, *"Who knows if this is not a blessing in disguise?"*

After Emperor Yuan’s passing, Pu resigned due to his mother’s mourning. He divined a burial site in Jiyang, about a hundred paces from water. Others warned of its proximity to the river, but Pu replied, *"It will soon become dry land."* Later, silt accumulated, covering the tomb, and for miles around, the land turned to mulberry fields.

Pu once arranged a burial for a client. Emperor Ming, in disguise, observed the proceedings and asked the host, *"Why bury at Dragon’s Horn? This method will bring annihilation to your clan."* The host replied, *"Master Guo said this is the burial of a dragon. Within three years, it will summon the Son of Heaven."* The emperor asked, *"Summon the Son of Heaven?"* The host answered, *"It will at least summon the Son of Heaven’s inquiry."*

The emperor found this most extraordinary.

In the third month of the first year of *Daning* during Emperor Ming’s reign, Wang Dun plotted to usurp the throne and subtly pressured the court to summon him. The emperor personally issued an edict to recall him, and Wang Dun relocated his garrison to Gushu. By the fifth month of the second year, he prepared to march his troops toward the capital and ordered Guo Pu to interpret his dreams. Pu divined and said, *"It will not succeed."* Wang Dun asked, *"How long do I have to live?"* Pu replied, *"If you proceed with this, disaster will come swiftly. But if you return to Wuchang, your lifespan cannot yet be measured."* Enraged, Wang Dun demanded, *"How long do you have to live?"* Pu answered, *"My life ends at midday today."*

Wang Dun flew into a rage and ordered his guards to bind Pu. Pu said to the guard, *"When I was thirteen, I took off my robe at Zhatang and gave it to you, telling you that my life would one day be in your hands. You may use my blade."* The guard, moved by this past kindness, wept as he carried out the execution. Even before divining Wang Dun’s dreams, Pu had already informed his family to prepare funeral arrangements at the execution site. His life ended between two pines by the riverbank. Three days later, people in the southern market saw Pu selling his lifelong garments and conversing with acquaintances. When Wang Dun heard this, he refused to believe it; upon opening the coffin, he found no body—Pu had achieved *bingjie* (transcendence through violent death). Later, he became the Immortal Lord of the Water Palace.

Pu had long been close friends with Huan Yi. Whenever Yi visited, he would enter directly, even if Pu was inside or outside. Pu once told him, *"When you come, you may go straight to any other place, but never seek me in the privy—it will bring misfortune to both host and guest."* Later, Yi, drunk, visited Pu and found him in the privy. Peering in, he saw Pu naked, hair unbound, holding a blade and arranging ritual objects. Seeing Yi, Pu clutched his chest in shock and exclaimed, *"I warned you not to come, yet you do this! Not only will it bring disaster upon me, but you will not escape it either."* In the end, Pu met his doom at Wang Dun’s hands, and Yi perished in Su Jun’s rebellion.

Pu compiled over sixty cases of divination and verification, titling the work *Donglin*. He also excerpted the essentials from the *Jing* and *Fei* schools, composing *Xinlin* in ten chapters, along with *Bu Yun* in one chapter. He annotated the *Erya*, as well as the *San Cang*, *Fangyan*, *Mu Tianzi Zhuan*, *Shanhai Jing*, and *Chu Ci*, all of which circulated in the world. His poems and *fu* (rhapsodies) amounted to tens of thousands of words. Much of the above aligns with the *Book of Jin*.

Your servant Daoyi remarks: Guo Pu’s response to Wang Dun was meant to deter the heart of a treacherous minister. Wang Dun, holding the esteemed rank of Grand General and perceiving the weakness of the Jin court, sought to betray and devour it—truly a man who desired what he should not and knew no contentment. Pu hoped to dissuade him, as seen in his words: *"If you proceed with this, disaster will come swiftly; but if you return to Wuchang, your lifespan cannot yet be measured."* Was not Guo Pu taking the Dao upon himself, hoping to turn the heart of a treacherous minister? The *Daodejing* states: *"No crime is greater than yielding to desire; no disaster is greater than discontent; no fault is greater than covetousness. Thus, contentment alone brings lasting satisfaction."* This was indeed Guo Pu’s intent in stopping Wang Dun.

—Guo Wenju

Guo Wenju was a native of Chaohun in Henei. From his youth, he loved mountains and rivers, often wandering among famous peaks and visiting the stone chambers of Huayin. When Luoyang fell, he entered the Wu region and dwelled on Mount Dapi. He lodged in the hollows of trees, covering himself with thatch for shelter. Though fierce beasts ran rampant at the time, Wenju lived there for over a decade without harm. The Chancellor, Wang Dao, sent for him to come to the capital, and all the court officials gathered to see him. Wenju sat slouched with legs sprawled, as if no one were present. Zhou Ji asked, *"Fierce beasts harm men—why do you alone fear them not?"* Wenju replied, *"I harbor no intent to harm beasts, so beasts do not harm men."* Zhou Ji, Yu Liang, Huan Wen, and Liu Hui all sighed in admiration: *"Though Wenju lacks the talents of a worthy man, he possesses the virtue of one."*

In the first year of the Xianhe era under Emperor Cheng of Jin, he earnestly petitioned to return to the mountains, but Wang Dao refused. Soon after, he fled to Mount Baitu in Lin’an. The following year, Su Jun rebelled, and people remarked that Wenju had foreseen this, hence his departure. He possessed two scrolls of the *Laozi*, which he reverently hung in his dwelling, though he was never seen reading them. A man from beyond the mountains, Xu Kai, became his disciple and received his records. The generals, officers, and soldiers from the records appeared to Kai in form, serving him. Wenju also allowed Kai to see the spirit of the local altar, warning him: *"You must not take a wife, or I shall no longer send them to you."* Later, Kai married a woman of the Ji clan, and the spirits vanished at once. Only two record-keeping officers remained, no longer obeying his commands. They told Kai: *"You have violated your master’s covenant. The celestial bureau has already seized the officers and soldiers. We remain only to guard the Supreme Records and can no longer be sent."* When Wenju died, his body vanished like a cicada shedding its husk. The people below the mountain erected a stele in his memory.

Xu Wenju inscribed on lotus leaves, composing the *Golden Male Poems* and *Golden Female Records*. Later generations discovered them beneath his bedding, and upon examining them in order, found them to resemble prophecies and apocrypha, whereupon they were transmitted to the world.

Your servant Daoyi remarks: Guo Wenju dwelled in reclusion among the mountains and forests, unafraid of fierce beasts. Consider his reply to Zhou Ji’s question: *"I harbor no intent to harm beasts, so beasts do no harm to man."* From this, his cultivation and learning may be discerned—no wonder he inspired such admiration. The *Daodejing* states: *"One whose virtue is profoundly deep resembles an infant: no venomous creature stings them, no fierce beast seizes them, no bird of prey snatches them."* Could this not describe Guo Wenju?

Wang Zhi
Wang Zhi was a native of Dongyang during the Jin dynasty. While felling trees in the mountains, he came to the Stone Chamber Mountain in Xin’an Commandery, where he saw several boys gathered in a stone chamber, playing go and laughing—one version says he encountered Red Pine Master and Anqi Sheng playing go. Zhi set down his axe and watched. The boys gave him an object like a jujube pit, instructing him to hold it in his mouth and swallow its juice, whereupon he felt neither hunger nor thirst. The boys said: *"You have stayed long enough; you may return."* Zhi took up his axe, only to find its handle had rotted away entirely. When he returned home, he calculated that centuries had passed; all his kin and acquaintances had perished, none remaining. He reentered the mountains, attained the Dao, and for over a hundred years, people occasionally saw him. Later, he too ascended to heaven. In eastern Zhejiang’s Xin’an, there is a Rotten Axe Handle Mountain, the very place—also called Axe Handle Mountain, now under Xi’an County in Quzhou. Another Rotten Axe Handle Mountain exists in Xin’an, Guangdong, now under Zhaoqing Prefecture.

Dong You
Dong You was a native of Hailing.

The three brothers were born of the same parents, with You being the youngest. Having lost their father early, their mother doted on You, who was often ill, and thus unable to manage the household. At eighteen, he said to his mother: *"My illness is severe and will not soon be cured. I only burden my two elder brothers and will never live a full life. I wish to enter the Daoist gate, sweeping and cleaning to pass my days."* His mother consented.

In his master’s household, You was reverent, diligent, and devoted to cultivation. He observed long fasts, studied earnestly, and never rested for a moment. Thus, he thoroughly mastered the arts of Daoist practice. At forty-one, one night, a perfected being descended to teach him the Way of walking on water without drowning. The immortal gave him a horsewhip and instructed him to strike the water with it, allowing him to walk upon its surface as if on level ground.

During the *Yixi* era of Emperor An of Jin, You returned home to bid farewell to his mother: *"I have attained the Dao and will no longer remain in the human realm. I have come now only to take leave of my family."* His mother asked: *"Where will you go, and when may you return?"* You replied: *"I must go to Mount Emei to receive further instruction; there is no set time for my return."*

Relatives and neighbors all came to see him off. When they reached the West River at Quyang, they saw You strike the water with his whip and walk away, gradually receding into the distance. Turning to his two brothers, he said: *"Pass down our family’s Daoist tradition through the generations."*

Fan Bao
Fan Bao was a native of Weizhong in Baxi. For a long time, he dwelled on Baili Isle in the Zhi River, cultivating the Way of Supreme Peace and Non-Action. When he exhaled and rinsed his mouth at the end of the day, a five-colored light arose from the back of his neck.

In winter and summer, he wore only a single layer of cloth. By the time of Huan Wen, his hair had already turned gray. Yet by the *yuanjia* era of Emperor Wen of the Song, his appearance remained unchanged. His divinations of fortune and misfortune—even matters thousands of miles away—were as clear as if he held them in his palm. All who met him asked: *"Are you a banished immortal?"* He replied: *"Dongfang Shuo once mocked me. In my youth, I often played tricks with him."* He also said: *"I saw King Wu of Zhou conquer King Zhou at the head of Luoyang’s city walls—singing before battle, dancing after victory."*

Emperor Wen of the Song summoned him for an audience. Fan Bao replied to the imperial edict, saying: *"I may call myself ‘I,’ but the Crown Prince is a great villain."* As he passed by the Eastern Palace, he pointed to its gates and said: *"Within lies a shrike-crow—why nurture a traitor unknowingly?"* The emperor, enraged, ordered Fan Bao to take his own life. Prince Jiangxia had him buried at Chiling Ridge by the Red Shore of Xinting. When the emperor later commanded his coffin be opened, it was found empty. He then regretted his actions.

The following year, Chen Zhong, a disciple of Fan Bao, rose in the night and suddenly saw the room illuminated as if by daylight. Fan Bao entered, walked to the bed, and sat down. An old man arrived shortly after, and Fan Bao stood to greet him. When Chen Zhong asked who the visitor was, Fan Bao only smiled and did not answer. After a moment, both departed. Fan Bao then said to Chen Zhong: *"I shall return to the eastern countryside soon. Guard my home well."* This was none other than Baili Isle.

Feng Boda
Feng Boda was a native of Jianchang in Yuzhang. His family had long practiced filial piety, and he himself was diligent in aiding others. Among the Daoist followers, Chen Ci received the imperial decree, much like Dai Jin—both were his contemporaries.

During the *yuanjia* era of Emperor Wen of the Song, Feng Boda traveled to the capital. Later, he hitched a ride home with a fellow townsman. When their boat reached Meigen, they were delayed for days by contrary winds. Feng Boda said to the boatmaster: *"If you wish to reach home swiftly, simply rest and do not open your eyes."* That night, those aboard heard the sound of branches scraping beneath the boat, yet it remained steady. Those who secretly peered out saw two dragons bearing the vessel on their wings, swift as lightning. Before dawn, they arrived at his home. Soon after, Feng Boda entered Mount Lu and did not return.

Ma Rong

Ma Rong resided in Gucheng of Liangguo. Though his eyes were inflamed and ulcerated, his pupils blind to the world, he possessed a penetrating vision that saw through all things. The north suffered from a prevalence of leprosy, and those shunned by their villages would invariably seek him out. Ma Rong treated them, and all were cured. He claimed affliction in his legs and often rode a white deer-drawn carriage, traveling near and far without any visible hand to guide it—yet the carriage arrived of its own accord. At times, he would answer dozens of summons in a single day, and at each place, a Ma Rong would appear. In conversation, he referred to himself as "the Wretched One." He composed three poems about pulling the carriage, akin to prophetic verse.

In the second year of the *xiaojian* era of Emperor Wu of the Song, on the third day of the third month, he wrote letters bidding farewell to the people of two kingdoms. On the sixteenth day at midday, he indeed departed this world.

Han Yue

Han Yue was a native of Guanjun in Nanling. His heart yearned for immortality, though his appearance resembled that of a mad fool. He followed his master in long periods of fasting and chanting, his voice never ceasing. He always wore wooden clogs and walked without regard for distance. When he entered the mountains, he might stay for a hundred days or fifty, then return home. If questioned, Han Yue never gave a straightforward answer.

Later, a villager hewed a bow from withered wood and, in a stone chamber on a sheer cliff in Mount Dayang, saw Han Yue reading scriptures with six or seven immortals. Afterward, Han Yue returned from the mountains and suddenly died in Luancun. His family prepared to receive his coffin, but it felt unusually light, raising doubts that it contained his true body. When they opened it, they found only a bamboo staff.

During the *daming* era of Emperor Xiaowu of the Song, a villager of Han Yue’s became a general in the imperial court. While on a northern mission to Qingzhou, he encountered Han Yue at the southern gate—his countenance now youthful. They spoke for some time, inquiring after the lives and deaths of relatives, their emotions mingling sorrow and joy. Han Yue said, *"My wife suffers from a persistent cough that has not yet healed. Today, I will give you a packet of medicine to steep in warm wine and have her drink it all at once."* The general returned to the capital and relayed Han Yue’s words. His wife took the medicine, and her cough was cured.

Daoist Yan Dong

Daoist Yan Dong’s origins were unknown.

Daoist Yan Dong was over forty years of age. During the *jianyuan* era of Emperor Gao of the Qi, he traveled to Jinling and became a disciple of Daoist Li Jing. He often reproached himself for his foolishness, wearing tattered clothes and worn-out shoes, carrying only a gourd, and possessing no scriptures. Yet when he engaged in discussion, his insights were profound and subtle, his voice clear and resonant, astonishing all who heard him. In his laughter, songs, and verses, he blended light and shadow, mingling with the common world. Though all knew him to be no ordinary man, they revered and admired him. After five or six years in Jinling, one day he announced his departure. Taking up his brush, he began annotating the *Scripture of the Numinous Treasure for Salvation*. His writing flowed without pause, continuing until the day’s end. Then he entered the Fan Mountains of Liyang, and his whereabouts thereafter were unknown.

Wang Lingyu

Wang Lingyu was a Daoist from Jiujiang. His nature was gentle and patient, and he was diligent in the Dao. He first resided on the Five Elders Peak, where one night a divine being spoke to him: *"Those who attain the Dao each have their proper place. Just as planting the five grains in sand and stone will yield no harvest, so too if one possesses the bone of ascension but lacks a blessed land or numinous abode, transformation cannot be achieved. Though one may accumulate virtue as earth and amass conduct as wings, if the place is not fitting, demons will corrupt one’s merit, and the Dao will never be attained."* Lingyu asked where he might dwell, and the being replied: *"The highest peak of Zhu Ling and the neighboring summit of Zi Gai—there you may ascend to heaven."* He then moved to the Central Temple of Mount Heng, where he remained for twelve years. On the thirteenth day of the seventh month in the eleventh year of the *tianjian* era of Emperor Wu of the Liang, a host of immortals descended to welcome him at the altar, and he ascended to heaven. Emperor Huizong of the Song later bestowed upon him the title *Master of Penetrating the Subtle and Gathering the Void*.

Daoist Shuang Xizu

Daoist Shuang Xizu, styled Zhongyuan, was a native of Wu during the Liang dynasty. He first dwelled on Mount Heng, later moving to the Nine Doubts Mountain. He devoted himself to the Dao in pursuit of transcendence.

Daoist Shuang once declared that where sincerity and purity reach, the loftiest immortals must respond. Thus, he resolved to recite the *Huangting Jade Chapters* with unwavering devotion. He built the Hall of the Yellow Court and had his disciples reside there, while he himself dwelled in White Horse Crag. One day, he returned to the hall to bathe and meditate, shutting himself in his chamber. For seven days he did not emerge. His disciples, alarmed, opened the door to find him suddenly ascending in lightness, leaving behind his immortal robe upon the treetops. This occurred in the fourth month of the first year of the *zhen'guan* era of Emperor Taizong of the Tang. The sleeping mat in the crag remained intact for over a hundred years thereafter, as recorded in *The Collected Wonders of Mount Heng*.

Huan He

Huan He, whose origins are unknown, served Master Tao the Recluse at the Huayang Lodge on Mount Mao for over a decade. His nature was upright and meticulous; beyond his duties, he remained still and seemingly idle. One day, two azure lads and a white crane descended from the sky and alighted in the courtyard. The Recluse, overjoyed, received them, believing the summons was for him. The lads said, "The Most High has called for Master Huan." The Recluse silently reviewed his disciples but found none surnamed Huan. Upon inquiry, he discovered only the attendant Huan He. When asked how he had attained this, Huan replied, "I have long practiced the Dao of silent audience, paying homage to the Great Emperor for nine years—hence today’s summons." As he prepared to ascend, the Recluse sought to become his disciple, but Huan firmly declined out of humility. Unable to persuade him, the Recluse lamented, "I have propagated the teachings and cultivated the Dao with utmost diligence, yet remain mired in the mundane. Must there be some fault in me?" He entreated Huan to investigate and inform him later. Thereupon, Huan donned celestial robes, mounted the white crane, and ascended into the void.

Three days later, he descended in secret and said, "Your hidden merits are indeed manifest, yet in compiling the *Materia Medica*, you employed creatures like horseflies and leeches as medicine. Though your work benefits humanity, it harms living beings. For this, you must undergo another twelve-year cycle before shedding your form and departing, whereupon you shall be appointed Supervisor of the Waters of Penglai." The Recluse then composed a separate *Materia Medica* in three volumes, substituting mineral, plant, and other remedies for those that took life, to atone for his transgression. Later, he indeed shed his form and departed.

*Comprehensive Mirror of Immortals Through the Ages Who Embodied the Dao*, Scroll Twenty-Eight (concluded)
*Comprehensive Mirror of Immortals Through the Ages Who Embodied the Dao*, Scroll Twenty-Nine

Master Celestial Master Kou Qianzhi, styled Fuzhen, was a native of Pingchang in Shanggu. He was the younger brother of Kou Zan, the Prefect of the Wei dynasty. His distant ancestor, Kou Ren, had concealed himself on Mount Wangwu during the reign of Emperor Cheng of Han, ascending in broad daylight to become an immortal, whereupon he was styled Master Illuminated Perfection. Ren’s grandson, Kou Jun, likewise departed riding a dragon. His father, Kou Fenlan, served as Governor of Hedong. The Celestial Master was born in the seventh month of the *yichou* year of the Jianyuan era of Fu Jian of Qin (365 CE), on the seventh day of the seventh month. At sixteen, he stood over eight *chi* tall. By eighteen, he had turned his heart wholly toward the Dao, his hidden yearnings reaching the heavens.

There was an immortal named Cheng Gongxing who had hired himself out to the household of the Celestial Master’s maternal aunt. One day, while clearing fields, Kou Qianzhi sat beneath a grove calculating the cycles of the viscera, but his reckoning did not align. Gongxing thereupon instructed him, and the calculations fell into place at his touch. Kou Qianzhi marveled and, after a moment, suddenly said to him, “If the Master is inclined to study the Dao, might we withdraw together into seclusion?” They then traveled to Mount Hua, where they gathered herbs for sustenance, and Kou Qianzhi never again knew hunger.

Later, they concealed themselves on Mount Song for several years. One day, Gongxing said to Kou Qianzhi, “When I depart, someone will bring you medicine—simply consume it.” As foretold, someone arrived bearing medicine, but upon inspection, it was composed of venomous insects and foul, noxious substances. Kou Qianzhi, seized by fear, went out to meet him. When Gongxing returned, Kou Qianzhi recounted what had occurred. Gongxing sighed and said, “The Master is not yet ready to attain immortality, but he may serve as a teacher to kings.” He added, “I shall not remain long. Tomorrow at noon, I will depart.” After Gongxing’s death, he instructed Kou Qianzhi, “If you bathe yourself, someone will come to receive you.” Gongxing then entered the third chamber of a stone grotto and expired. Kou Qianzhi personally performed the ablutions.

At noon the following day, someone knocked at the stone chamber. Kou Qianzhi emerged to find two youths—one bearing ritual vestments, the other a bowl and staff. He led them inside to Gongxing’s corpse. Suddenly, Gongxing rose, donned the garments, took up the bowl and staff, and departed. Kou Qianzhi thereafter remained steadfast in his resolve on Mount Songyang, never again venturing forth.

In the summer of the second year of the Shenrui era of Emperor Mingyuan of Wei (415 CE), on the first day of the fourth month, two figures clad in kingfisher-feathered robes and cloud-woven crowns, riding dragons and bearing banners, suddenly appeared, announcing, “The Venerable Lord has arrived.” Soon after, celestial music resounded, and the Most High descended in a white jade chariot, drawn by nine dragons, his majesty resplendent, accompanied by a procession of immortals and divine attendants, alighting upon the mountain’s summit. Kou Qianzhi reverently prostrated himself and beheld the five palace gates swing open, revealing towering terraces and halls.

The Most High sat beneath a silver-flowered forest and commanded the Immortal Duke Wang Fangping to bring Kou Qianzhi before him. He declared, “I have received a memorial from the Master of the Assembly of Immortals at Mount Song, stating that since Zhang Daoling attained perfection, those who cultivate the Dao have lacked proper instruction. Now, the Daoist Kou Qianzhi of Mount Song conducts himself in accord with the natural order and is fit to occupy the position of master. Therefore, I confer upon you the office of Celestial Master, along with the *Yunzhong Chants* and the new scriptures and precepts of the Dao. Since the beginning of time, these have never been transmitted to the world.”

Now the turning of the celestial cycles has come to fruition, and you must cultivate these teachings to assist the state and uphold the Mandate, transforming the living beings. Thereupon, he produced nine scrolls of the new scriptures and precepts. Once Kou Qianzhi had received them, the five-cloud terrace and halls vanished from sight.

On the fifteenth day of the first month in the second year of the Tai Chang era, the Most High descended once more, bestowing over ten scrolls of new talismans and registers. He admonished Kou, saying, “The talismans and registers given before and after may only be transmitted to those who are worthy. If you confer them upon the unworthy, the fault shall be yours.” Kou Qianzhi bowed deeply and accepted the instruction, and thereafter his resolve and conduct daily renewed.

During the Shi Guang reign of Emperor Taiwu, the court dispatched the Governor of Luozhou, Duke Liang, along with over a thousand officials to the mountain to welcome the Master to the capital. Yet the court and common folk did not yet fully believe or revere him, save for the Minister of Education, Cui Hao, who became his disciple. Cui memorialized the throne, saying, “I have heard that when a sagely ruler receives the Mandate, Heaven responds with auspicious signs. The *River Chart* and *Luo Writing* conveyed their messages through creatures and beasts, yet none compare to the divine and mortal communion of today. Though Emperor Gao of Han was most sagely, the Four Hoary Ones still refused to bend to him.” The Emperor grasped his meaning and ordered envoys to present jade and silk in sacrifice to Mount Song, and to bestow upon the Master palaces and lodgings. He drew near to inquire of the Dao, and his reverence grew ever more profound. Again, he sought to appoint the Master to the position of chief minister, but the Master firmly declined, saying, “I am now the Sagely Master, for the Most High has descended four times, and immortals have descended six times, all bestowing upon me the celestial scriptures and precepts. Judging by these manifestations, he is truly a sage.”

Thereupon, the Emperor established a capital altar, constructed the Palace of Serene Wheels, and instituted rituals and regalia, all in accordance with the scriptures and precepts. Thus, the realm turned in reverence toward him.

In the year *gengchen*, the Master requested to pray for blessings on the Emperor’s behalf at Mount Song. Through his utmost sincerity, he moved the unseen, and the Most High secretly bestowed upon the Emperor the title *Tai Ping Zhen Jun* (“True Lord of Great Peace”), along with ceremonial caps, robes, talismans, and registers. Upon his return, the Master memorialized the throne in full, and that year was changed to the first year of the *Tai Ping Zhen Jun* era.

In the second year, Kou Qianzhi memorialized, saying, “Now that Your Majesty rules as the *True Lord*, having established the Palace of Serene Wheels—an achievement unparalleled since antiquity—you should receive the talismans and registers to manifest your sagely virtue.” The Emperor assented and ascended the altar to receive them.

On the seventh day of the first month in the ninth year, he said to his disciples, “Last night, I dreamed that Cheng Gongxing summoned me to the Immortal Palace of Mount Song.” On the twenty-fifth day of the fifth month, he indeed ascended as an immortal. A mist of blue-black qi issued from his mouth, rising halfway to the heavens before dissipating.

His form gradually shrank, which those with insight called a "corpse-deliverance." He lived to the age of eighty-four. On the fifteenth day of the seventh month, Shen You of Dongjun, while gathering herbs atop Mount Song’s summit, saw Qianzhi’s body gleam like silver, radiant as the sun. Thus it was known he had become an immortal.

Li Jiao, a disciple of Kou Qianzhi, practiced qi-absorption and grain avoidance, secluding himself in Changshan for decades. At over ninety years of age, his complexion remained that of a youth. Each day, he bathed and donned his cap and sash, to the astonishment of his household. Soon after, he sat in transformation, and Daoist priests all declared he had attained immortal corpse-deliverance.

Master Wei Jie, styled Chuyuan, was a native of Duling in Jingzhao. His family was eminent, possessing over ten thousand scrolls. From childhood, Jie loved antiquity, mastering the classics, histories, and various arts, including divination and astrology. At fourteen, Emperor Wu of the Later Wei appointed him as a calligrapher in the Eastern Palace. When Emperor Xiaoming first ascended the throne and the Empress Dowager held court, he was sent to govern Lu Commandery. After Emperor Zhuang’s enthronement, he was reassigned to Yangxia, drawn by its proximity to Mount Song and the true Daoist priest Zhao Jingtong. Upon arrival, he returned his official regalia to the court and sought out the master. He received the sacred texts of the Three Caverns, divine formulas, and esoteric instructions.

Jingtong said, “Mount Song is a blessed land for immortals, yet lately Buddhists have dwelled here. Lacking transcendent conduct, they merely seek to lend their names to the mountain to enhance their reputation. Thus, corpses accumulate and souls stagnate, defiling this sacred peak. Recently, celestial signs and climatic patterns have grown violent and unbalanced. I fear calamity may flow from this—how can one remain at ease? You should journey to Shangluo, Min, and Yi to inquire further. I shall wander to Mount Tai or perhaps sail the seas on a raft.”

Jie then settled on the southern slopes of Mount Hua, where people called him the Master of Huayang. He consumed yellow essence, white wood, sesame, fuling, cinnabar, and realgar, practicing the Three Ones, the Feminine One, the Eight Ways, and the Nine Perfected. He also performed the *Huangting Neijing* and the *Dharani of Wisdom-Dispelling Demons*. He compiled the *Preface to the Three Caverns Rituals*, annotated the *Miaozhen*, *Xisheng*, *Zhuangzi*, *Liezi*, *Doctrine of the Mean*, *Classic of Filial Piety*, and *Analects*, while the *Laozi* and *Book of Changes* received separate treatises totaling over eighty scrolls. After reading the *Inner Biography of Master Louguan of the Taihe Era*, he composed an additional volume.

Emperor Wu of the Northern Zhou once invited him to receive the *Five Talismans of the Numinous Treasure* and the *Red Writ of the True Script*. A white crane descended upon the altar, circling before departing. The Emperor praised him and bestowed frequent gifts. He was further ordered to compose a hymn for cultivating the Dao, and thus he wrote the *Method of Refined Contemplation*. The Emperor repeatedly expressed his admiration and granted him the title Master of Refined Contemplation.

At the time, Zhou Hongzheng, an envoy from Chen, heard of the master’s renown and wished to seek his teachings. The Emperor summoned them for discourse, where Jie expounded profound mysteries, weighing and comparing the Three Teachings. Hongzheng marveled, saying, “This is a paragon of the three realms, not merely one to be revered by two nations.” The Emperor specially renamed him the Great Master of the Mystic Center.

Later, he dwelled on the eastern ridge of the mountain, shielding himself from noise to dwell in purity and vastness. The Emperor, upon hearing this, bestowed upon him the Taiyuan Refined Abode. In the fourth year of Emperor Wu’s Taihe era (recorded as Tiankang in the *Outer Annals*), a canopy of colored clouds suddenly appeared, covering his hut. He declared, “I shall depart upon this.” Thereafter, he did not leave his chamber. Twelve days later, he peacefully transformed, having lived seventy-three years.

Field Master Wen, whose personal name was Shiwen, hailed from You’e. In the seventh year of Emperor Wen of Sui’s Kaihuang era, he tested his studies and entered the Dao, serving Master Wei Jie to receive transmission of the Three Caverns’ scriptures and methods, along with talismanic incantations. He also recited the *Scripture of the Numinous Treasure* and the *Chapters on Generating the Spirit*. In his daily life, he consumed white wood and narrow-leaved hoelen, and over time, it proved beneficial. He would refine his qi in a quiet chamber, sometimes emerging only after ten or fifteen days, his complexion growing ever more radiant. On all eight seasonal nodes, ten auspicious days, and Gengshen days, he observed fasts and rites without fail. When petitioned to pray for blessings, none failed to evoke a response. When called to heal the sick, none did not recover fully.

Master Chen Gang once invited him to perform a jiao offering; suddenly, he produced from his sleeve several dates that appeared upon the altar—when eaten, they were unlike anything found in the human realm. Another time, the Daoist Yin Qi had him wear a talisman and register; in an instant, it fell into water with a splash, yet Qi was already standing on the shore. Such were the wonders of his true registers and divine talismans.

He often told others, “If people suffer, one must aid them.” Yet few believed him. There was a villager named Helan Kai who had received the precepts from the Master. One night, Kai suddenly died and was seized by ghostly officers, taken to a yamen-like court in the unseen realm. The record-keeper examined his ledger and said to Kai, “You bear the name of one who has received the precepts—you may return.” Thus, he revived. Such were the effects of his communion with the hidden and penetration into the netherworld. Far and wide, many came to believe and revere him, and the blessings he bestowed were too numerous to record.

In the seventeenth year of the Zhenguan era of the Tang Emperor Taizong, on the nineteenth day of the sixth month, the Master ascended in transcendence. All witnessed divine maidens bearing flowered banners and feathered regalia come to escort him away, and he declared, “Now I ascend to the Hall of Blessings in the Southern Palace.” He had lived seventy-five years. Among his disciples, only Yin Wencao had entered the inner chamber.

As for the Daoist Xu Ze—Xu Ze was a man of the Eastern Sea region. Serene and sparing of desire, he had long harbored the aspiration to dwell in reclusion. He thus entered Mount Jinyun to cultivate the Dao. After a long time, the Perfected One Xu of the Great Ultimate descended and told him, “When you reach eighty, you shall become the teacher of a king, and only then will you attain the Dao.” Thereupon, he built a hut on Mount Tiantai, fasting to nourish his vastness, subsisting on nothing but pine and water.

When Emperor Yang of the Sui was Prince of Jin and garrisoned Yangzhou, he summoned Xu Ze with a letter. Xu Ze said to his disciples, “This year I turn eighty-one; the prince summons me—thus the words of Perfected One Xu are proven true.” Upon arrival, the Prince of Jin requested instruction in the Daoist arts, but Xu Ze declined, citing an inauspicious day. That night, though incense and lamps remained as usual, at dawn after the fifth watch, he silently returned to the True.

The prince ordered envoys to escort him back to Mount Tiantai. Along the route from Jiangdu, some saw the Master walking on foot, saying he had returned home. When he reached his former hermitage, he bequeathed his scriptures and Daoist arts to his disciples. Then he swept a chamber clean and said, “If a guest arrives, receive them here.” After a while, he mounted the stone bridge and departed, vanishing without a trace. The next day, the envoys indeed arrived.

At the age of eighty-two, the Prince of Jin, filled with remorse, thrice dispatched envoys to capture his likeness and commanded Liu Shi to compose a eulogy, which read:

*"The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao;
The name that can be named is not the eternal name.
Supreme virtue does not feign virtue—
Perfect power seeks no adornment.
The true wind now stirs.*

*In the land of Yue, he tempered his golden bones of old,
Delighting his spirit in the Jade Clarity.
Washing with stone marrow, refining the elixir near completion,
His thoughts turned to Ge Zhi, soon to follow Mao Ying.
Our prince, from afar, was moved by his empty sincerity.
For a moment, he descended from the pillar’s height,
Immersing his essence by the river’s flow.
He left behind a talisman as token,
Transforming his staff into a light-footed dragon.
Seeking the numinous beyond, how could mere sentiment suffice?"*

Master Qihui, styled Pingding, was a native of Jingzhao. In the fifth year of Emperor Wu of Zhou’s Taihe reign, he entered the Dao. Soon after, when the emperor purged the followers of Buddhism and Daoism, he reverted to lay life. By the time Daoist arts flourished again under the Sui, he was twenty-six, his resolve for the virtuous path ever firmer. He then studied under Master Su at the Tongdao Abbey. Over time, he transmitted the teachings of the Three Caverns, practicing and expounding without rest. Within, he embraced stillness to preserve his true nature; without, he roamed freely to suit his inclinations. Through the passing years, he attained profound self-mastery.

In the seventh year of the Sui Dynasty’s Daye era, Emperor Yang personally led an expedition against Liaodong. Qihui addressed his disciples, saying: "The Dao of Heaven is about to change; I shall yet live to see it, and it will come to pass in no more than a few years." Someone asked: "What will the future hold?" He replied: "A descendant of the Old Lord shall rule the world, and thereafter our teachings shall flourish greatly." Several years later, the Sui Dynasty indeed fell into chaos.

When Emperor Gaozu of Tang revered his virtue, he dispatched envoys bearing treasures, silks, and a jade dragon to seek his blessings. On the night of the ritual, white clouds enveloped the altar, and a pair of deer docilely approached the steps—such was the depth of his spiritual resonance. The emperor, greatly pleased, issued an edict to renovate the Louguan Abbey, restoring its altars, halls, and sacred images to pristine splendor. He further granted the lands of Lantian to fund its rituals and appointed Qihui as its master.

One day, the emperor personally visited the temple and said to his attendants: "The Old Lord is our sagely ancestor. Now that he presides over the state, how can we fail to honor him with grand constructions?" Thus, he renamed the abbey *Zongsheng* ("Ancestral Sage") and bestowed grain and silk to support its observances.

Beyond his prayers for the nation, Qihui practiced the Three Guardians of Unity and the methods of the Outer Constellations. As the *Scriptures of the Immortals* state that those who seek to become immortal must enter Mount Taibai, he selected his most devoted disciples and journeyed there together. Upon their return, his chamber was often filled with the laughter and conversation of divine immortals.

In the fourth year of Emperor Taizong’s Zhenguan reign, on the eighteenth day of the seventh month, Qihui suddenly told his disciples: "At the Si hour tomorrow, I shall depart this world." At the appointed time, he indeed ascended in transcendence, having lived seventy-three years.

---

Sun Simiao was a native of Huayuan in Jingzhao. At seven, he began his studies, reciting a thousand words daily. When the Governor of Luozhou, Dugu Xin, saw the young boy, he marveled: "A sagely child indeed, though his talents may prove too vast for the world to employ." As he grew, he delighted in the teachings of Zhuangzi, Laozi, and the Hundred Schools.

During the reign of Emperor Xuan of Zhou, amid the turmoil of the imperial house, he withdrew to Mount Taibai to study the Dao, refining his qi and nurturing his form in pursuit of transcendence. Proficient in astronomy and calendrical calculations, he mastered medicine and pharmacology, scrutinizing the subtleties of pulse and complexion. His heart ever brimmed with benevolence; in all his actions, he strove to accumulate hidden virtues and aid all beings.

Once, while traveling, he encountered a cowherd boy killing a small snake, its blood already spilled. Simiao sought out the boy, bartered his own clothes to ransom the creature, and tended its wounds with medicine before releasing it into the grass. Over a month later, while traveling again, he saw a young man in white, his horse and retinue impeccably arrayed, dismount and bow before him. The youth expressed his gratitude: "My younger brother was saved by your kindness." Simiao paid little heed.

The youth bowed again and urged him to mount a spare horse, and together they sped away as if flying. They arrived at a city where flowers bloomed in springtime splendor, the scenery radiant and gentle. The gates and halls gleamed resplendently, teeming with people, resembling the abode of a king. The youth led Simiao inside to meet a man of dignified and handsome bearing, clad in a crimson robe and a black cap. Surrounded by a vast retinue, the man welcomed him warmly.

He thanked Simiao, saying: "I deeply admire your virtue, so I sent my son to welcome you. Earlier, my youngest child ventured out alone and was grievously wounded by a fool. Thanks to your ransom and rescue, his life was spared. Here, none of our kin are few, and we are all indebted to you for this second life. To meet you today is our greatest honor."

Moments later, they entered an inner chamber where a young woman, accompanied by a maidservant and a small boy in green, emerged to bow repeatedly in gratitude. "This child was reckless," she said, "and was harmed by others. We owe his survival to your kindness." Simiao recalled having saved a green snake and wondered at this strange turn.

He noticed that those around him were palace attendants and courtesans, addressing the robed man as "Lord" and the woman as "Queen." Perplexed, he discreetly inquired and was told: "This is the Water Palace of Jingyang." The king then ordered his ministers to prepare a feast with music and entertainment, but Simiao declined, explaining that he subsisted on breath and qi, drinking only wine.

After three days of hospitality, the king asked what he desired. Simiao replied: "I delight in dwelling in the mountains, cultivating the Dao, refining my spirit. Though my eyes may see, my heart harbors no desires." The king then offered him fine silk, pearls, and gold, but Simiao firmly refused. "Does the Daoist truly disdain such things?" the king asked. "How then may I repay you?" He commanded his son to present Simiao with thirty prescriptions from the Dragon Palace, saying: "These are true methods for a Daoist, capable of saving lives and aiding the world."

Soon after, the king ordered his attendants to escort Simiao back to the mountains. Upon his return, he marveled at the encounter. Testing the prescriptions, he found them miraculously effective. Later, he compiled the *Essential Prescriptions Worth a Thousand Gold Pieces* in thirty volumes, including the Dragon Palace formulas. He also authored the *Pulse Classic*, which circulated widely.

When Emperor Wen of Sui served as regent, he summoned Simiao to the post of Erudite of the Imperial Academy, but he declined. He once told others: "Fifty years hence, a sage shall arise, and I shall aid him in saving the people." By the time of Emperor Taizong of Tang, he was summoned to the capital. The emperor, astonished by his youthful appearance, remarked: "Now I understand that those of the Dao are truly worthy of reverence. The tales of immortals like Xianmen are no empty words." When offered a noble rank, Simiao steadfastly refused.

At the beginning of Emperor Gaozong’s reign, he was appointed Remonstrance Grandee but again declined. Though he was ninety-nine years old, his hearing and sight remained sharp. Lu Zhaolin of Fanyang, a man of renown, suffered from a grievous illness. Lamenting the disparities of fate and the mysteries of longevity, he asked Simiao: "What is the Way of a great physician in curing illness?"

Simiao replied: "I have heard that one who speaks well of Heaven must ground it in man, and one who speaks well of man must root it in Heaven. Heaven has its four seasons and five phases, with cold and heat alternating in succession. Its movements bring harmony as rain, fury as wind, condensation as frost and snow, and expansion as rainbows—such are the constant patterns of Heaven and Earth."

Man has four limbs and five viscera, waking and sleeping, exhalation and inhalation. In motion, they become going and coming; in flow, they become *ying* and *wei*. Manifest, they become complexion; expressed, they become voice and sound—such are the constant patterns of man.

Yang employs its essence, while Yin employs its form—this is what Heaven and Earth share. When these patterns fail, steaming gives rise to heat, stagnation to cold. Coagulation forms warts and tumors; collapse forms ulcers and abscesses. Rushing brings panting; exhaustion brings withering and desiccation. Diagnosis appears in the face, and changes move through the body.

Extending this to Heaven and Earth, it is likewise so. Thus, the five planets wax and wane, stars and constellations lose their courses, the sun and moon err in their paths, comets and shooting stars streak across the sky—these are the illnesses and sores of Heaven and Earth. Untimely cold and heat are their steaming and stagnation. Rocks standing and earth surging are their warts and tumors. Mountains collapsing and land caving in are their ulcers and abscesses. Rushing winds and violent rains are their panting and exhaustion. Untimely droughts and dried-up rivers are their withering and desiccation.

The skilled physician follows these principles with medicinal stones, rescues with acupuncture, harmonizes with virtue and the Dao, and assists with human affairs. Thus, man has curable illnesses, and Heaven and Earth have avertable disasters.

Zhaolin asked: "What of human affairs?"

Simiao replied: "The heart is the ruler; a ruler must be reverent, thus desires should be small. As the *Book of Songs* says: *As if treading over a deep abyss, as if walking on thin ice*—this speaks of smallness. The gallbladder is the general, charged with decisiveness and resolve, thus desires should be great. As the *Book of Songs* says: *Valiant warriors, the shields and walls of lords and marquises*—this speaks of greatness. Benevolence is the image of Earth’s stillness, thus it should be square. As the tradition says: *Not swayed by profit, not pained by righteousness*—this speaks of squareness. Wisdom is the image of Heaven’s movement, thus it should be round. As the *Book of Changes* says: *Seeing the moment and acting, not waiting the whole day*—this speaks of roundness."

Thus, his literary works stand out brilliantly, and his arts of the Dao are beyond enumeration.

Zhaolin again asked about the essentials of nurturing life.

Simiao answered: "Heaven has fullness and emptiness; man has hardship and peril. Without self-caution, one cannot overcome them. Thus, nurturing life must begin with knowing self-caution. Caution is rooted in awe.

A scholar without awe neglects benevolence and righteousness; a farmer without awe slacks in sowing and reaping; a craftsman without awe disregards rules and measures; a merchant without awe fails to grow his goods; a child without awe forgets filial piety; a father without awe abandons kindness; a minister without awe achieves no merit; a ruler without awe leaves chaos ungoverned.

Therefore, the highest awe the Dao; next, awe Heaven; next, awe things; next, awe others; next, awe oneself. He who worries for himself is not constrained by others. Caution in small matters brings no fear of great ones. Vigilance in near things brings no regret for distant ones. Thus are human affairs complete."

In the latter years of Emperor Gaozong’s reign, an imperial decree appointed him Gentleman for Rendering Service, assigning him to the Imperial Pharmacy Bureau, but he declined the post. On the fifteenth day of the second month in the third year of Yonghui (652 CE), at over a hundred years of age, he bathed at dawn, donned his robes and cap with solemn dignity, and sat upright with hands clasped. Addressing his descendants, he said: “Pressed by the world, I secluded myself in mountain grottoes to cultivate and refine my nature, soon to ascend to the realm of Nothingness, to serve in the Golden Towers. I cannot answer the summons to come and go.” Soon after, his qi ceased.

He left instructions for a simple burial, forbidding the use of funerary objects, sacrificial vessels, or animal offerings. Over a month later, his complexion remained unchanged. When his body was lifted into the coffin, it was as light as an empty garment—he had already achieved *shijie* (liberation through apparent death). The dates of his transformation recorded in the hagiographies of immortals align with those in *The Old Book of Tang*. *The Old Book of Tang* states he lived over a hundred years, while *The Comprehensive Mirror of Buddhism* records that the recluse Sun Simiao died in the first year of Yongchun (682 CE). Proficient in the teachings of Lao-Zhuang, yin-yang, and medicine, he held Buddhist scriptures in particular esteem, and the world honored him as Sun the Perfected One.

Reconciling the recorded dates of his transformation, however, reveals he lived over thirty years longer—thus exceeding one hundred and twenty years. Comparing this with reliable historical records, the account in *The Comprehensive Mirror of Buddhism* is incorrect.

When Emperor Xuanzong of Tang fled to Shu, he dreamed of Sun Simiao requesting realgar. The emperor then ordered an imperial envoy to deliver ten catties of it to the summit of Mount Emei. As the envoy ascended the mountain, he saw an old man in a headscarf and coarse robe, flanked by two young attendants in blue. The old man said, “I have a memorial to present to the emperor.” The envoy looked upon a stone where over a hundred characters were inscribed in vermilion. As he copied them, the writing vanished as soon as it was transcribed. Suddenly, a white mist arose, and the figures disappeared.

Later, in Chengdu, there was a monk who recited the *Lotus Sutra* with great devotion. Though wars raged, he remained unharmed. One day, a mountain servant arrived and said, “The Master requests the monk to recite the sutra.” He was led through several streams and ridges, entering a mountain dwelling amid mist and clouds. The servant said, “The Master is elderly and ill, rising late. Please recite the ‘Treasure Tower’ chapter so he may hear it.” At that moment, the Master emerged—clad in rustic garb, leaning on a flowering staff, his ears hanging to his shoulders. After burning incense and listening to the recitation, he returned inside and did not reappear. The monk was served a meal of wild rice in a bamboo bowl, with dishes of wolfberry and chrysanthemum. Though lacking salt or dairy, the food tasted as sweet as ambrosia. He was also given a ring of bronze coins. The servant escorted him to the path’s end, where the monk asked, “What is the Master’s surname?” “Sun,” came the reply. “And his given name?” The servant wrote two characters in the monk’s palm: *Simiao*. The monk was startled; when he turned back, the servant had vanished. Searching the mountains, he could not find the old path. Upon returning, he examined the coins—now a hundred pieces of gold.

From that single meal, his body became light and free of illness. By the Tianxi era of Emperor Zhenzong of Song (1017–1021 CE), the monk was already over a hundred years old. Later, he vanished into seclusion, and none knew his whereabouts.

Minister Dao Yi remarked: Sun Simiao refined his qi and nurtured his spirit, delving deeply into medicine and tirelessly practicing hidden virtue. His compassion was boundless, and he devoted himself to goodness. Even for the bite of a small snake or the tiniest insect, he would apply medicine, seal the wound, and release them. His virtue extended even to insects—beyond what ordinary people could achieve. Thus, he received the dragon palace’s repayment, and such wondrous responses followed. As the *Daodejing* says: “Constantly good at saving all things, there is nothing discarded.” Sun Simiao embodied this principle.

Hu Yin Yao

Hu Yin Yao was a Daoist from Mount Dongting, who claimed to be a descendant of Master Jiaoli. On that mountain stood Jiaoli Village and Jiaoli Temple, where generations had attained the Dao. Yin Yao resided on Mount Jiao, where he studied the method of refining the form through the Great Yin. He died within a cave, instructing his disciples: "Observe my body constantly, and allow no thing to violate it. After six years, if I revive, clothe me again in robes and cap." His disciples watched over him—his flesh had decayed, yet his five viscera remained unchanged. They sealed and guarded him, and at the appointed time, he indeed revived. They prepared hot water for his bath and dressed him in new garments. His hair was loose and black, his beard thick and straight. Sixteen years later, he died again as before, reviving after another seven years. This occurred thrice in all, and though he lived some eighty years, his appearance remained that of a man in his thirties. Emperor Yang of Sui heard of him and summoned him, bestowing extraordinary favor and courtesy. During the *Zhenguan* era of Tang, Emperor Taizong summoned him to the inner palace and inquired about the Way of nurturing life.

He replied, "What I cultivate is but the resolve of a common man, my merits too slight to benefit the world. When an emperor cultivates the Dao, a single word of his brings fortune to ten thousand lands, and the efficacy of attaining the Way is all the swifter. My humble learning is not what one of Your Majesty’s exalted station should pursue." He then begged leave to return to the mountains, and his whereabouts thereafter were unknown.

**Liu Daohé**
Liu Daohé, also named Ai Dao, was a native of Wanqiu in Chen. From childhood he harbored reclusive aspirations and dwelt on Anyang Mountain in Shouchun. At the end of the Sui, he moved to Su Mountain and received the Dao from the Daoist Meng Shuo of Xiantang Abbey. Later he entered Huo Mountain. On the Spring Equinox, he opened his vow-text in a valley and, after walking several *li* back, was met with thunder, lightning, and rain, whereupon he took shelter in a cave. That night, he dreamed of being summoned; upon waking, a radiant light filled the air, and he saw a divine figure over ten feet tall, clad in robes, cap, sword, and sash, holding a talisman and accompanied by six or seven armored guards. The figure said to Daohé, "I am the Yellow Spirit, Great Mightful Envoy. Now the Six Heavens’ vile fiends harm the people and all things. Hearing of your devotion to the Dao and your unyielding integrity, you may subdue these demonic hordes. I bestow upon you the talismans and contracts of the Three Heavens’ Orthodox Unity and Alliance Might." Daohé received and swallowed them, and from then on, wherever he applied his Daoist arts, none failed to prove efficacious.

During the *Wude* era of Tang Gaozu, he entered Song Mountain and dwelt alongside Pan Shizheng. Gaozong, learning of this, issued an edict establishing Taiyi Abbey at his place of seclusion and bade him reside there. When the emperor was about to perform the Feng sacrifice at Mount Tai, unceasing rain fell. He dispatched Daohé to perform exorcisms, and the skies soon cleared. Favored by the court, Daohé would distribute any gifts he received to the poor and needy. When Luoyi suffered a plague of locusts, Daohé presented a talisman to the officials, instructing them to distribute copies throughout the region, whereupon the locusts vanished at once.

In the *Xianheng* era of Tang Gaozong, the emperor summoned him to create talismans. Having completed them but before he could present them, Daohé suddenly sorted through his writings with restless urgency, as if preparing to depart. When his disciples asked him about it, he replied, "The Lord of Life of Mount Lu has summoned me." Shortly after, he bathed, donned his cap and hempen robe, and transformed. During the *Diaolu* era, when the Fengtian Palace was being constructed, Daohé’s tomb was relocated. Upon opening the coffin, his bones were found disjointed, like a cicada’s molted husk—some say only an empty skin remained, split open along the back like a cicada’s cast-off shell. The emperor, hearing of this, remarked, "He prepared elixirs for me, yet consumed them himself and departed!" Thus concludes *Volume Twenty-Nine of A Comprehensive Mirror of Perfected Immortals Through the Ages Who Embodied the Dao*, and begins *Volume Thirty*.

Master Liang Chen

Daoist Liang Chen, styled Kaocheng, was a native of Fufeng in Jingzhao. He was broadly versed in the classics and histories, and though he delved into the arts of yin-yang divination and astrological observation, there was nothing he did not thoroughly master. He spurned fame and profit, disdained rich flavors, and found contentment only in tranquility and ease.

One day, a physiognomist saw him and remarked, "This youth’s eyes radiate a white light, and his countenance gathers true *qi*—he is no ordinary man." Later, he indeed took delight in the Dao of divine transcendents.

In the early *Xianxi* era of Emperor Yuan of the Great Wei, at the age of seventeen, he studied under Master Zheng at Louguan. His benevolence overcame his attachment to life, and his harmony precluded any desire to compete; all who knew him found joy in his presence. He often dreamed of wandering with immortals—now ascending famous mountains, now drinking stone marrow—and thus found his own amusement.

In the second year of the *Yongxing* era of Emperor Hui of Jin, the fifth day of the fifth month of the *yichou* year, Lord Lao commanded the Perfected One Yin Gui to descend at Louguan. Liang Chen then served him with the utmost reverence as a disciple. The following month, he was first taught the method of refining *qi* to conceal his form, then the arts of the cinnabar elixir of water and stone, and finally the talismans of the Six *Jia* spirits and the technique of gathering and ingesting the yellow essence of the sun and moon.

Later, he secluded himself on Mount Zhongnan, consuming black millet and swallowing talismans, fully realizing their wonders. He also extensively sought cinnabar, which he refined into an elixir. Whenever he spoke, his voice carried a clear and resonant tone. As his admirers grew in number, he withdrew deeper into the cliffs and valleys.

Once, trapped by a great snowstorm in which birds and beasts perished, Liang Chen alone remained in serene solitude, his resolve steadfast and sincere—thus, numinous immortals naturally gathered to him. His eyes could see things beneath the earth, and his ears could hear sounds from miles away.

One day, he suddenly told his disciples, "A friend awaits me on the southern peak; I must go now." He then donned his cap and robes and departed. Clouds and mist obscured his form, and only the faint strains of ceremonial music lingered in the air.

This occurred in the first year of the *Daxing* era of Emperor Yuan. The *Annals of the Primordial Origin* states: "He could fly and transform at will. After three years, his elixir was complete, and he ascended to heaven in broad daylight." —Sun Che

The Daoist Sun Che, styled Zhongxuan, was of unknown origin and served as the master of registers to Yin Tong. His nature was upright and forthright, sparing of speech. Outwardly, he seemed simple, yet within, he cultivated purity—no one could fathom him. In the early years of the *Chuguang* era of the Former Zhao, at the age of eighteen, he became a disciple of Master Wang. The master guided him in matters of withdrawal and engagement; people called the master the Great Refiner and Che the Lesser Refiner. As the master was held in high esteem by his age, those seeking his counsel grew numerous, and he soon withdrew into seclusion. Only Che remained at Louguan, sometimes lodging in the treetops or in places seldom frequented by others. He habitually wove kudzu into mats, sat upright with eyes closed, as if lost in thought. When others mocked him, he responded with humility, so that they would feel ashamed and withdraw. He could discern a person’s fortune or misfortune merely by observing their countenance, without waiting for them to speak.

At over seventy years of age, in the spring of the eighth year of the *Jianyuan* era of the Qin, he suddenly told his attendant, "I must depart for a time." He then brushed his robes and left, and no one ever knew his destination. His friend Ma Jian, missing him, took his kudzu mat and enshrined it in a quiet chamber. For several days, voices were heard speaking from the mat. Such were his numinous wonders.

Minister Dao Yi said: "Sun Che kept himself aloof from the dust of the world, delighting in the Dao and nurturing his true nature. When others treated him with disdain, he responded with humility, so that all felt ashamed of themselves. As the *Daodejing* says: *Only because he does not contend does the world not contend with him.* And again: *The Dao of the sage is to act without contending.* This describes Sun Che." —Ma Jian

Master of the Dao Ma Jian, styled Yuanyue, was a native of Youfufeng in Jingzhao and the tonsure-master of Yin Tong. At sixteen, he stood eight *chi* tall, with large, thick ears, arms that hung past his knees, a ridge of hidden rhinoceros bone upon his brow, and vertical lines upon his palms. He diminished his indulgence in music and beauty, and set aside fame and profit. Widely versed in the classics and histories, he excelled especially in the *Songs of Chu* and the *Airs of the States*. The commanderies and counties marveled at him and offered official appointments, but he declined. During the *Ganling* era of the Qin, he entered the register of Daoist adepts at Louguan and studied the Dao under Sun Che, at the time aged seventeen. Sun Che then transmitted to him the essentials of the Dao.

In scriptural abundance, these included the *Five Talismans of the True Writ*, the *Inner Writ of the Three Sovereigns*, the *Daodejing*, the *Scriptures of Numinous Treasure*, and the arts of *dunjia* divination and astrological prognostication. In the subtleties of medicinal arts, these encompassed grain avoidance and water ingestion, the consumption of jujube paste, *tianmen* elixirs, wood decoctions, *jianshang* preparations, *lu* wine, the *Cloud Teeth of the Five Directions*, the *Six Jia Talismans*, the *Inner Sounds of the Myriad Heavens*, and methods of *xingqi* and *daoyin*. In commanding the myriad spirits and subduing the host of demons, he mastered the ordinances of the *Eight Officials and Six Ding*, the *Twenty-Four Spirits*, and the *Essentials of the Three Sovereigns*—none of which failed to prove efficacious.

Yao Chang, hearing of him, found him extraordinary and dispatched envoys to summon him, but he declined on grounds of illness. Yao Chang, admiring his integrity, provided him with incense and candles, his reverence and esteem deepening. Jian’s resolve in the Dao grew ever firmer; his benevolence and kindness extended to all things, and those who flocked to him for aid increased daily.

One day, a celestial spirit descended and declared: "Master of the Dao, you have long accumulated merit and virtue, and now you diligently cultivate the Daoist arts. Your cinnabar name is inscribed in the Jade Register, your white tally recorded in the Dark Terrace—this has been so for some time. But preserve your heavenly years... you shall surely attain transcendence."

Why should one trifle with prayers and petitions, toil over summons and exorcisms? One may instead roam freely through the Three Primes, merge with the Five Spirits, sever all sensory perceptions, and preserve solitude in purity and vastness. Thus, nurturing the spirit and cultivating simplicity, he no longer ventured forth, while immortals and perfected beings descended at times.

At ninety-eight years of age, in the winter of the tenth month on the first day of the fifth year of Emperor Taiwu of the Later Wei’s *Dayan* reign, he said to his disciple Yin Tong: "All that I have cultivated and attained in this life must be kept secret and not revealed." Soon after, a white cloud came from the northwest, covering his bedchamber. In an instant, he returned to the True, leaving only an unceasing fragrance, as the white cloud ascended to the south.

The Daoist Yin Tong, styled Lingjian, was a descendant of the Perfected One’s lineage. From childhood, he studied the Confucian classics, mastering all the group of classics, histories, and philosophers without exception. He often lamented the impermanence of worldly transformations, gazing at the heavens in sighs. His parents, unaware of his aspirations, pressed him to marry and pursue an official career. Tong knelt and said: "I have heard that when Zhang the Perfected ascended to heaven, Zhen Nan succeeded his glory; when the Mao Lords attained the Dao, the Grand Guardian pledged his faith. How much more, as the descendant of the Supreme Pole Perfected One’s legacy, should I not honor and continue it? I wish to follow my own resolve." His parents consented, and he departed in a gust of wind.

At the time, banditry and calamity ravaged the land. Tong endured hardships and dangers, braving perils to reach Louguan. At twenty-six, in the first year of Emperor Taiwu’s *Shiguang* reign, he served Master Ma Jian. After years of diligent service, he was finally bestowed the Perfected One’s secret transmissions: jade scripts and golden writings. When his parents passed away, he observed the rites of filial piety to their fullest, yet his resolve to seek the True and guard the One grew daily. Morning and evening, he tended the incense and paid homage without the slightest slackening. For decades, he consumed yellow essence, realgar, and asparagus root, his body growing ever lighter and his nature more keen. He was especially devoted to healing the sick—those who could be cured, he treated; those beyond hope, he declared incurable.

Emperor Taiwu, fond of the Dao, revered his reputation and often sent envoys with incense and candles, commissioning him to perform purification rites and conduct Daoist ceremonies. From then on, visitors from all directions sought his audience without cease, yet Tong’s heart dwelled only on merit and virtue, giving without seeking, dispersing without hoarding. At the time, his nephew Fa Xing, along with Niu Wenhou, Wang Daoyi, and seven other disciples, followed in his footsteps, all aspiring to the numinous path. Thus, the teachings of the immortal winds and true way flourished anew.

At one hundred and one years of age, his hearing and vision remained sharp, and he could still write by night. In the fourth month of summer, on the eighth day of the twenty-third year of Emperor Xiaowen’s *Taihe* reign (later revised to *Chengming* in the second year), he suddenly bid his disciples a final farewell. After a moment, he passed away in an instant, his complexion unchanged. After his burial, on the western slope of Laozi’s Ascension Mound, several divine lamps appeared, their light illuminating the site before gradually dispersing.

The Daoist Niu Wenhou, a native of Longxi, was of exceptional intelligence and learning, deeply versed in the ancient and modern, particularly in the teachings of Zhuangzi and Laozi. He mastered astronomy and geography, leaving no detail unexamined.

He was also skilled in instructing others, guiding them in loyalty and filial piety according to their nature. In exhortation and admonition, he revealed the principles of sin and blessing; in enforcing prohibitions, he employed talismans and registers. Thus, the Daoist teachings flourished anew, and many turned from evil to goodness. When lecturing to others, he never concerned himself with profit or wealth; if compelled to accept, he took little and declined much. When he learned of someone in poverty, he would secretly send goods to their home, wishing to conceal the source. Each winter’s cold, he scattered grain upon the ground so that birds and insects might have food. His hidden merits and quiet kindness extended greatly to people and slightly to creatures. Cultivating himself and accumulating virtue, his dedication deepened with time.

In the fifth year of Emperor Wen of Western Wei’s *Datong* reign, on the twenty-eighth day of the eighth month, he dreamed of a young Daoist in blue robes who announced: "The Emperor Above has issued a decree—you should prepare at once, for you shall depart at dawn tomorrow." Upon waking, he bid farewell to his disciples. The next day, after bathing, he indeed passed away, having lived eighty-two years.

**Wang Daoyi**
The Daoist Wang Daoyi was a man of the Wei dynasty. Well-read in all classics, he also mastered apocryphal texts and prognostication. Knowing that Mount Zhongnan held the site of Yin Xi’s transcendence, during Emperor Xiaowen of Northern Wei’s *Taihe* reign, he led six or seven disciples from Mount Guye to reside there. Earlier, Daoists Niu Wenhou, Yin Lingjian, and over forty others had propagated the Dao and its teachings, earning reverence from court and commoner alike. In times of famine, when the monastery’s resources were nearly exhausted, Daoyi undertook grand renovations, mobilizing laborers and craftsmen. Though hundreds worked daily, supplies never ran short. Those who marveled and observed found storehouses fully stocked, their contents inexhaustible. All knew the master’s divine transformation was secretly aided by spirits. Thus, halls, altars, and pavilions were all renewed. Only the Laozi Hall built by the First Emperor of Qin, for its grandeur, remained untouched. He instructed his disciples to collect over ten thousand volumes of sacred scriptures, all funded by his own means, never soliciting others. His nature was vast and unburdened.

Within his chamber, voices were often heard. When disciples stealthily investigated, they discovered gatherings of true immortals. During Emperor Xuanwu of Northern Wei’s *Yongping* reign, as he neared his return to the Dao, white clouds filled the room and rare fragrances perfumed the courtyard, lingering until sunset. Locals later saw Daoyi riding a deer as he departed.

**Chen Baochi**
Master Zhengyi Chen Baochi was a native of Yingchuan. At twenty-one, he took no pleasure in marriage or office. In the eighteenth year of Emperor Xiaowen’s *Taihe* reign, he entered the register of Louguan Monastery and served the Dharma Master Wang Daoyi. Soon after attaining transcendence, he journeyed to Huayin.

Once more, he encountered the Perfected Immortal Lu Jing, who transmitted secret methods to him before he returned. From then on, he cultivated with utmost sincerity and emptied himself, adhering faithfully to the practices and reciting the *Great Cavern Scripture*. Over time, his communion deepened, and rare birds and strange beasts would often come to attend and guard him. Whenever he paid homage at the Laozi shrine or presented dragon tablets at the eight solar nodes, white tigers would docilely follow at a distance, escorting him to and fro. If travelers harbored ill intent, the tigers would roar and surge forward, once even striking the locust tree to the left of the temple, causing the malevolent to flee in terror. The people thus named it the "Tiger Tree." His virtue manifested so profoundly that he communed with the unseen and reached the hidden realms, leaving nothing beyond his influence. Before events came to pass, he would know of them in advance. When malevolent spirits or demons harmed people, his prohibitions would halt them at once.

Emperor Wen of Western Wei, struck by his extraordinary abilities, summoned him to the Yan Ying Palace to inquire about the Dao. At the time, the Grand Preceptor, the Duke of Anding, and the court’s scholar-officials all followed and took him as their master. At seventy-six, on the seventeenth day of the third month in the fifteenth year of the *Datong* era, he addressed his disciples: "Last night, I dreamed that immortals summoned me, and I shall not tarry long. Why rejoice at coming? Why grieve at going? Life and death are one in the Dao; dream and waking share the same principle. You must embody this—let no sorrow arise." With these words, he suddenly departed.

An imperial edict posthumously bestowed upon him the title "Master of Upright Virtue."

**Wang Yan**
Daoist Wang Yan, styled Ziyuan, was a native of Fufeng. At just nine years old, he was drawn to the Dao. In the third year of Emperor Xiaowen of Western Wei’s *Datong* era, the *ding-si* year, he entered the Dao under Master of Upright Virtue Chen Baochi. By eighteen, he was studying at Louguan Monastery and befriended the Perfected Immortal Li Shun. Later, he visited the Yuntai Temple on Mount Hua and took Jiao Kuang, the Perfected Immortal, as his master, receiving the secret oral instructions and true scriptures of the Three Caverns. He subsisted on pine needles and drank from mountain streams, seeking the profound truths of the Dao.

Emperor Wu of Northern Zhou, having heard of his reputation, dispatched envoys to summon him. The Perfected Immortal Jiao said to him: "The Daoist teachings have declined, long bereft of support. You should answer the summons and propagate the great Daoist teachings. From this moment, I shall depart." Upon arriving at the capital, after some time, he obtained permission to return to the Yuntai Temple on Mount Hua’s western peak. The emperor then ordered its expansion to accommodate him. However, the mountain’s rocky terrain lacked soil, making its transport exceedingly laborious. In silent prayer to Heaven, soil suddenly welled forth beside the temple, inexhaustible no matter how much was taken.

Once, troubled by a shortage of oil, he placed a vessel there, and by morning it was full, remaining abundant even after prolonged use. Whenever guests were about to arrive, two azure crows—shaped like ravens—would fly and cry out in advance. Climbing the Immortals’ Palm or the Lotus Peak, he moved as if treading level ground. Wherever he dwelled, fierce tigers would appear, tame and distant, as if guarding him.

At that time, the world was submerged in the teachings of the Buddha. Yet his followers failed to uphold the discipline of meditation, instead wielding notions of sin and fortune to alarm the common folk. The corruption grew rampant, prompting a purge. Daoist teachings teetered on the brink of extinction. Only the Master’s name was held in reverence by the emperor, who summoned him to the palace to consult on the essentials of the Dao. The emperor also wished to establish a Tongdao Temple and commanded him to collate and compile the Three Caverns’ scriptures, rituals, precepts, talismans, and registers—over eighty scrolls in total. He further composed the *Three Caverns Pearl Satchel* in seven scrolls, which the emperor ordered disseminated at the Tongdao Temple. Thus, Daoist teachings revived, and the court adopted the era name *Daxiang* in recognition.

When Emperor Wen of Sui abdicated, he established the Xuandu Temple and decreed that Yan oversee it. In the sixth year of the *Kaihuang* era, the *bing-wu* year, he was specially summoned to the Daxing Palace. The emperor, in sincere devotion, received the Great Precepts of Wisdom. Auspicious winds and propitious clouds then enveloped the altar. From this, the rituals and decorum of the Daoist gate were established—the term "decorum" originated here. At the time, the court’s ministers and scholar-officials all revered and followed him.

In the fourth year of the *Renshou* era, on an auspicious day in the third month, he addressed his disciples: "I wish to return to the western peak, but I fear the emperor may not permit it." On the ninth day, he ascended at the Xiandu Temple, where white cranes flew and cried, circling the courtyard. The emperor, struck by the marvel, sent envoys to escort his burial at the western peak. When the tomb was opened, only an empty coffin remained.

Minister Dao Yi remarked: "Wang Yan, from his youth, studied the Dao and found enlightened masters. He upheld the teachings and established their lineage, communing with spirits and moving all things. When Emperor Wu ordered the expansion of the Yuntai Temple, the labor of transporting soil was a concern. In silent prayer to Heaven and Earth, soil suddenly surged forth, inexhaustible no matter how much was taken. This was the power of accumulated sincerity moving Heaven—how could such a feat be easily achieved? As the *Dao De Jing* states: 'The Dao of Heaven shows no partiality; it always aligns with the good.'"

Li Shunxing

Daoist Li Shunxing was a native of Jingzhao. His mother conceived after dreaming of a bright star descending from the heavens. At his birth, a Daoist arrived and said: "This child was once an attained adept of the Dao, temporarily lodged in the womb." At just nine years old, he loved purity and emptiness, often sitting in perfect stillness. His parents, discerning his inclination, sent him to study under Master Zheng Yi. At eleven, he took the Daoist register.

He constantly recited the *Great Cavern Sutra*, never tiring. Zheng Yi then established an altar for him, transmitting the *Five Thousand Character Text* and the *Yellow Court Scripture*, saying: "Though you are still young, your heart already aligns with the Real. According to the hidden instructions, if you recite these for three years, you will ascend to heaven in broad daylight. You must strive diligently." Thereupon, he devoted himself to recitation in his dwelling. Before three years had passed, on an autumn equinox evening, thousands of flying immortals gathered in the sky, their divine radiance illuminating his chamber. Stepping outside to gaze, he saw two figures who said: "The Supreme Emperor has commanded us to await you in the Purple Pavilion Grotto. We are the gods of the Direct Day and have come to summon you." He then mounted a wind-borne chariot and arrived in an instant.

There, he saw three immortals, each seated upon a couch, with five-colored clouds and mist swirling above them. Their attendants bore banners and plumes beyond description. He bowed and inquired about the Way of ascending in flight. They said: "You possess accumulated virtue from past lives, and your rank is that of a Perfected. To ascend in both form and spirit would not be difficult. However, the Most High has sent you to be reborn to accumulate merit through diligent practice. Though you have fasted and recited scriptures for some time, your merit has not yet extended to others—how could you attain this so soon?" He then earnestly pleaded, hoping to inspire the common and mediocre, and asked: "If I accumulate merit and deeds to atone for past transgressions, would that be possible?" The immortals replied: "Excellent! Such a heart is truly pitiable. Though your bones and qi align with the Real, your fetal form has not yet been shed."

The attendant scripture immortal then opened the *Nine-Colored Flowing Radiance Record* and presented three scrolls before the three immortals. The eldest immortal unfurled the *Jade Perfection Golden Radiance Scripture of the Most High*, saying: "I am Perfected Zhao Boyuan of the Supreme Clarity. I once received this scripture from the Eastern Flower Youth and cultivated it to attain perfection. I now transmit it to you—you must cultivate it." The next immortal produced the *Divine Continent’s Seven Transformations and Seven Changes, with the Heavenly Scripture*, saying: "I am Perfected Zhang Zhongyi of the Supreme Clarity. I once received this scripture from the Heavenly King of Lesser Existence and cultivated it to become a Perfected. I now bestow it upon you—you must strive diligently." The third immortal then took the true scriptures from the hands of the other two and exhorted: "I am Perfected Li Shaojun of the Supreme Clarity. I once received this scripture and thereby attained ascension. I share a karmic connection with you, so I have come to oversee your transcendence. If you follow the rites of the Four Poles and practice for seven years, your body will gain the power of flight. After seven hundred years, you may transmit these teachings to three others; if no suitable person is found, you must seal them in a famous mountain. The true arts of immortality now bestowed upon you—if you cultivate them without cease, you will transform the mundane and succeed, ascending to immortality in due time. Without this Way, your spirit will not achieve penetrating clarity, your body will not attain purity and emptiness, and you will be recorded by the Eight Emperors and overthrown by the Six Heavens—how then could you transform the mundane?"

They then composed a verse:
The supreme Dao is originally formless,
Yet takes names from things.
If one diligently studies the highest,
The Way of immortality naturally succeeds.
The Jade Emperor summons the Crimson Child,
The Golden Perfection unites the Yellow Court.
The six senses achieve profound union,
The eight difficulties thus vanish.
The radiant spirit revolves sevenfold,
The empty breast illumines the Four Clarities.
Breath and transformation can shift ten thousand ways,
Revering and gazing upon the hundred spirits.
In harmonious transformation, roam the dusty paths,
Swiftly rein the cloud-banners.
I pledge to my many friends,
To meet you in Penglai’s isles.

Thereafter, the three immortals mounted their chariots and departed, and he returned to his dwelling. Upon his return, he recited the scriptures and practiced their arts. At seventeen, his Dao was accomplished: his transformations were boundless, and he responded to circumstances and engaged with others without obstruction. Zheng Yi, recognizing this, treated him with even greater esteem. Skeptics secretly tested him by pouring boiling water and exposing him to fire, yet he never complained of heat. When made to tread fire or enter water, he could not be burned or drowned.

Emperor Wen of the Western Wei, hearing of his fame, summoned him to the capital, where he attended over a hundred vegetarian feasts held in the city’s wards, all of which he could attend. Though the emperor knew of his ability to divide his form and transform his shadow, he still doubted whether he could be near and far at once. He then ordered simultaneous vegetarian feasts in the four prefectures of Qi, Ning, Tong, and Hua, all of which he attended in full. From then on, both court and common folk revered and believed in him.

Initially, people did not know of his abilities and simply called him "Master Li the Cultivator." After his spiritual transformations became widely known, he was styled "Master Li the Sage." At thirty-eight, in the eighth year of the Datong era, he feigned illness and passed away. On the day of his burial, a nephew encountered him on the road to Mount Li and was told: "If the Son of Heaven has not forgotten me, erect my image here, facing north, and I will ward off the perverse customs of the northern lands for the state." The nephew returned home only to learn of his passing. He reported the matter in full, and envoys were sent to open the tomb, finding only an empty coffin. A shrine was then established in Shayuan.

Hou Kai

Daoist Hou Kai, styled Faxian, was also a native of Jingzhao. At fourteen, he devoted himself to the study of scriptures, particularly excelling in the teachings of Laozi and Zhuangzi. Drawn to solitude and loftiness, he neither married nor pursued office, instead studying under Master Zheng Yi. At nineteen, during the Zhengshi era of Emperor Xuanwu of the Later Wei, he became a Daoist and was transmitted the secret instructions of the *Mysterious Text*. His morning and evening devotions grew ever more fervent over time.

Zheng Yi said: "Though you are steadfast in heart and resolute in conduct, unwavering in the Dao, without retiring to the mountains and forests, attainment will not come easily." Hou Kai replied: "The Dao resides in the square inch of the heart—why must one seek the mountains and forests?" Zheng Yi said: "I too know the Dao is everywhere, yet when cultivated among people, there are times when attainment is possible."

Yet since ancient times, those who attained transcendence often first took refuge in the wilds and marshes. Only after achieving perfection did they emerge to mingle with the world of dust. The Perfected of the Highest Realms have also said: *"The* Great Cavern Perfection Scripture *must not be chanted among men—if chanted, great demons will corrupt it."* Moreover, when the Venerable Master Ge was about to ascend to perfection, he parted from his disciple Zheng Siyuan, saying: *"Why not ascend a famous mountain to recite the* Great Cavern Perfection Scripture*, intoning each verse with resonant harmony, so that the mystic sound pierces the Great Clarity?"* From this, we know that entering the mountains is not merely a matter of preference—it naturally accords with the scriptures and the Dao. You now yearn for the profound and the subtle; thus, retiring to the mountains is most fitting.

Hou Kai replied: *"Though dwelling in the mountains may preserve perfection, does it not distance one from the master’s teachings and the discipline of precepts?"* His master praised his words and added: *"The Dao is not difficult to know—it is difficult to practice. If you can remain steadfast from beginning to end, the Dao will reside within you."*

When Zheng Yi ascended as an immortal, Hou Kai chose to dwell in Cold Valley, where he practiced the *Three Rushing Arts*—a method attributed to the Yellow Emperor’s *Three Rushing Arts of Governing Women*. Later generations, misled by its transmission, have come to mistake it for what the immortals strictly forbid. Yet Hou Kai, having studied under Chen Baochi, traced his lineage to the authentic traditions of divine transcendence; it was unlikely he practiced the *Three Rushing Arts*. Rather, it was likely the *High Rushing* method of the immortals, a practice aligned with the Great Dao—perhaps a scribal error in later transmissions.

He recited the *Great Cavern Scripture*, the *Inner Texts of the Three Sovereigns*, and the arts of summoning and exorcism. His dwelling was encircled by clear springs, and three pines arched overhead, creating a secluded and tranquil retreat—his abode of true attainment. Thus, he named it Three Pines Abbey. Whenever people suffered from the harm of mountain spirits or demons, regardless of distance, they sought his aid. Some he cured with incantations, others with talismans and arts, and all afflictions were instantly dispelled.

When his end drew near, he was free of illness. He addressed his disciples, saying: *"Long ago, Fei Zhangfang lost his talisman and was slain by ghosts. I have not lost my talisman—I am returning to the perfection of the Dao. If the world fails to understand, they may mistake me for Zhangfang."*

In his eighty-sixth spring and autumn, he transcended form in the winter of the tenth month of the second year of Jiande under Emperor Wu of Zhou.

Master Yán Dá, styled Dàotōng, was a native of Fúfēng. From his earliest years, he harbored aspirations beyond the mundane world. Whenever he obtained a flower or a fruit, he would reverently offer it before the sacred image. Master Hóu of Lóuguàn observed this and esteemed him highly. In the *Yǒngxīng* era of Emperor Míngyuán of the Later Wèi, he entered the Dao at the age of twenty. During his intervals of fasting and cultivation, he would often seek instruction in the great scriptures. Thus, he mastered the *Qióngchuò* and attained broad comprehension of the subtle and profound.

During the *Jiàndé* era of Emperor Wu of Zhou, the emperor summoned Master Yán and Wáng Yán to the private palace hall. At that time, the emperor had already purged the Buddhist clergy and had further consulted his ministers, intending to abolish the Daoist tradition as well. The emperor asked the master which was superior, the Dao or the teachings of Śākyamuni. The master replied: *"The host is superior, the guest inferior."* The emperor asked: *"How does one distinguish host from guest?"* The master said: *"Śākyamuni came from the West—is he not the guest? The Dao arose in the Central Lands—is it not the host?"* The emperor said: *"If the guest returns to the West, does the host not see him off?"* The master replied: *"If the guest returns, it benefits the lands of the Hu; if the host remains, it does no harm to the Middle Kingdom. What need is there to pursue the departed or send them off? Let those who remain be officially preserved."* The emperor praised his response, yet could not avoid some suppression. Apart from the temples of the Five Marchmounts, all others were abolished. He specially built the Tōngdào Abbey for the master to the left of Tiángǔ, and selected ten disciples from Lóuguàn to jointly propagate the true teaching.

At the time, Wáng Yán sought to acquire more disciples, but the master said: *"The enlightened of antiquity first established it within themselves before establishing it in others. Now, though the emperor does not wish to abolish the Daoist teaching, his intent is to reduce its excesses. Yet the Dao values those who embody it; the subtle net of the Way will naturally uphold itself. Why must there be many? For many bring many burdens, and this would instead become a blemish upon our Way. The Dao does not favor mixture; mixture leads to excess, excess to confusion, confusion to disorder, and disorder to the loss of true principle. What benefit could there be?"* Thus, together with Wáng Yán, Sū Dàobiāo, Chéng Fǎmíng, Zhōu Huàshēng, Wáng Zhēnwēi, Shǐ Dàolè, Yú Chángwén, Zhāng Fǎchéng, and Fú Dàochóng—ten in all—they forgot worldly concerns through the arts of the Dao, harmonizing their comings and goings. The age called them the *Ten Elders of Tiángǔ*.

When the Dàoist teaching revived under the Suí dynasty, Emperor Wén in the *Kāihuáng* era issued an edict to restore the two temples, meticulously selecting Daoist clergy and repeatedly presenting written prayers to invoke blessings. Thus, both court and common folk revered and followed them. In the fifth year of *Dàyè* under Emperor Yáng, on the seventeenth day of the third month, the emperor listened as Master Zhōu played the zither. He remarked: *"The zither’s sound moves the spirits; a deity shall descend."* He asked for another piece to be played. Before the melody concluded, the master suddenly returned to the true, having lived ninety-one springs and autumns.

Master Yú Zhāng, styled Chángwén, was a native of Yòu Fúfēng.

At the age of seven, his parents taught him the *Classic of Filial Piety*. After several days, he said: *"I have heard of the* Dàodé Jīng*; my heart wishes to study and recite it."* His parents, struck by his words, allowed him to follow his inclination and study under Master Hóu. In the ninth year of *Dàtǒng* under the Western Wèi, he took the tonsure, enduring the toils of the monastic life for fourteen years. The master, moved by his dedication, revealed to him the essential methods of the *Three Caverns* and the host of perfected beings, bestowing them as if overturning a basket. He once said to himself: *"The talismans and mandates of the perfected are not for common transmission. Now that I have obtained them, they are truly my treasures."* Thereupon, in a quiet chamber, he transcribed cloud scripts and dragon charts, conducting the rites with utmost reverence. When he applied these to others, none failed to manifest divine efficacy.

It so happened that an imperial edict selected ten clerics of pure precepts to reside at the *Tōngdào* Abbey, and he was among them. Yet he always harbored a longing for the true, aspiring to dwell in seclusion. In the second year of *Dàxiàng* under Emperor Jìng of Zhōu, he chose a site beneath the western ridge below the abbey. There, he felled thatch, piled stones, and roamed the forests and springs, savoring their flavors. He consumed yellow essence, fuling, and mountain rehmannia, practiced *qi*-absorption, swallowed talismans, and conducted *fēizhāng* rites. Through such unceasing diligence over the years, in the seventeenth year of *Kāihuáng* under Emperor Wén of Suí, he again received the *Sixty Jiazi* and the talismanic seals of the *Five Emperors* and *Five Marchmounts* from the *Royal Elder of Transformation* and the *Perfected Lord of the Supreme Ultimate*, totaling one hundred and thirty-six items. He also expounded the origins of heaven and earth, the roots and branches of talismans, and the ritual forms for altar arrangements. Recording the days and months for talisman transmission and the instructions of perfected immortals, he compiled them in order, titling it *Origins and Sequence*. Thus, his aspiration to commune with the true advanced daily. His divine transformations in dispelling demonic dreams and malevolent spirits were immeasurable, and the benefits bestowed upon the common folk grew ever more abundant.

On the fourteenth day of the sixth month in the tenth year of *Dàyè* under Emperor Yáng, he ascended in feathered transformation, having lived eighty-two springs and autumns. On the day of his passing, a white crow departed from his coffin, and people said he had attained the Dao of shedding his mortal form.

**Master Zhāng Fǎlè**
The Daoist Master Zhāng Fǎlè was a native of Nányáng.

In his youth, he studied the Dao and took delight in springs and rocks. Upon reaching the age of adolescence, he took refuge at the Edge Tower Abbey, serving Master Yǐn Qǐ. With wholehearted devotion, he attended to his master’s side for many years. Moved by his diligence and toil, Master Yǐn eventually entrusted him with the essentials of the Dao. On the night of his initiation under the open sky, divine lamps radiated brilliance, and auspicious clouds shimmered with color. Thereafter, he fulfilled his duties with utmost reverence—tending to the master’s headscarf and water vessel, bearing the labors of desk and mat—observing every ritual from beginning to end. Later, he sought seclusion and explored wonders, choosing to dwell west of Gěng Valley. Wearing tattered robes and subsisting on vegetables, he severed all worldly ties. Daily, he recited the *Five Thousand Character Text* and cultivated the Dao of *Cíyī*. Refining his form and nurturing his *qi*, he embraced oneness and guarded the true, enduring thus for thirty years. Clouds gathered upon the beams, and rosy hues settled upon his window—people called his abode Cloud Abode Abbey. In time, his Daoist practice flourished, and spiritual resonance came naturally. Once, a tiger’s roar shook the earth, yet he regarded it without fear. Later, the beast came and went, docile as if offering protection. When visitors approached with disrespect or insincerity, they were invariably repelled and could not draw near. Morning and evening, the faint sound of divine bells lingered in his ears, though none could discern their source. On fast days, twenty-odd figures clad in grass garments would deliver frankincense and a few dried jujubes; when he stepped outside to look, they vanished.

In the third year of Emperor Fèi of the Western Wèi, in the third month, he said to his disciple Zhāng Tōng: “Though I have received subtle signs, my merits and virtues remain incomplete. Recently, a spirit foretold that I shall not linger long and must entrust my form to the deep earth for over two hundred years. The affairs of the unseen realm value secrecy—you may know but a little.” On the fifteenth day of the fourth month, at dawn, he leaned upon his desk and transformed. At that moment, a white *qi*, cloud-like, pierced through the window, stretching over a *zhàng* in length, and dispersed only after the time it takes to eat a meal.

**Jù Guózhēn**
The Master Jù, named Guózhēn, was a native of Wǔgōng. Of sincere and honest nature, he was fond of the study of immortals and transcendents. At thirty, he severed worldly ties and served Master Yóu at the Abbey of the Tower. This was in the fourth year of *Rénshòu* under Emperor Wén of the Suí. Beyond his devotions, he recited scriptures without cease, his heart ever fixed on the One. He forgot both fame and profit, relinquishing joy and anger. Subsisting on vegetables and wearing tattered robes, his resolve only deepened. If anyone offered him goods, he would accept and distribute them at once.

Should anyone treat him with disdain or contempt, he never once grew resentful or angry. Pleased with his conduct, the Dharma Master bestowed upon him the *Sīwēi Precepts Record*, along with sealed talismans and summons. Following these texts in his practice, his diligence knew no bounds. Whenever he approached the altar to recite scriptures, though he might not yet have completed even a few rounds, neither winter’s winds nor summer’s heat ever caused him to falter. One day, struck by illness, others urged him to take medicine. He replied, “When the Dao prevails, illness vanishes—what cause for concern is there?” Such was his unshakable faith.

From near and far, the common folk, drawn by his virtue, came in numbers beyond counting. At the age of sixty, on the thirteenth day of the fifth month in the summer of the eighth year of *Zhēnguàn* under Emperor Tàizōng of the Táng, as he napped in the daytime, his disciples suddenly heard the sound of carriages and horses. Moments later, the tiled roof trembled, and the Dharma Master thus departed. *Lìshì Zhēnxiān Tǐdào Tōngjiàn*, Scroll Thirty, ends here.

**Zhōnglí Quán**
The Perfected One, surnamed Zhōnglí, named Quán, later changed his name to Jué. His courtesy name was Jìdào, and his sobriquets included Hé Gǔzǐ, Zhèng Yángzǐ, and Yúnfáng Xiānshēng. A native of Yàntái—some say of Xiányáng in Jīngzhào—his great-grandfather’s name was Pǔ, his grandfather’s name was Shǒudào, and his father’s name was Yuán, all renowned figures of the Hàn dynasty. His father held the rank of marquis and served in the Yúnzhōng Prefecture.

At the time of the Perfected One’s miraculous birth, a radiance spanning several *zhàng*, resembling a raging fire, illuminated the surroundings, startling all who stood guard. The Perfected One’s appearance was striking: his head was round, his forehead broad, his ears thick, his shoulders long, his eyes deep-set, his nose prominent, his mouth square, his cheeks full, and his lips and face as rosy as cinnabar or milk. His arms hung long, like those of a three-year-old child. For seven days and nights, he neither cried nor fed, until on the seventh day, he leapt up with a resonant voice, declaring, “My body roams the Purple Palace; my name is inscribed in the Jade Capital.” His voice rang like a bell, and his gait was swift as a galloping horse—no child of his age could match him. (Some accounts say that in his youth, he studied literature and served the Hàn dynasty as a Remonstrating Grandee. Having submitted a memorial on Lǐ Jiān’s frontier affairs, he was exiled to the south of the Jiāng. After the Hàn dynasty fell, he served the Wèi and later the Jìn.) *Lìshì Zhēnxiān Tǐdào Tōngjiàn*, Scroll Thirty-One.

In his prime, he served the Jìn as a great general, leading troops to battle the Tǔfān in the northwest. As the two armies clashed, suddenly heaven shook with thunder and lightning, wind and rain plunged the world into darkness, and men could not see one another—both armies scattered without a fight. (Another account says that during the reign of Emperor Wǔ of Jìn, he was ordered to join the Vice General Zhōu Chǔ in a campaign that ended in defeat. The Perfected One fled alone into the mountains, losing his way. That night, he pressed deep into a secluded forest ravine, hoping to preserve his life. There he encountered a foreign monk, his forehead shaded by a bamboo hat, his body clad in a robe of woven grass. The monk led him for several *lǐ* to a village, saying, “This is where Master Dōnghuá attained the Dao. You may rest here.” With a bow, the monk departed.)

(Another version says he met a monk who, without speaking, pointed southeast toward a temple. Before its gates stood two Daoists in blue robes. When he asked where he was, they replied, “This is the abode of the Lesser Yáng Emperor of the Purple Palace.” The Perfected One dared not disturb the village. After a long while, he suddenly heard voices saying, “That green-eyed foreign monk is meddlesome.” Then an old man in a white deer-fur cloak, leaning on a staff of green jade, called out, “Are you not the great general Zhōnglí Quán?” The Perfected One answered, “I am.” The old man continued, “Why did you not lodge with the mountain monk?” Startled, the Perfected One thought, *This must be no ordinary man.* His tiger-like ferocity vanished, and his heart turned toward the Dao like a phoenix or crane. Unaware, he had already resolved to seek the path to transcendence.

Thereupon, the old man bestowed upon him the True Oral Formula for Longevity, the Vermilion Talisman and Jade Script, the Golden Regulations and Sacred Texts, the Fire Phases of the Golden Elixir, and the Sword Techniques of the Azure Dragon, urging him to practice diligently. When the Perfected One took his leave and turned back, the village had vanished. From then on, he grasped the profound mysteries.

(Another account says that, knowing he possessed the bones of an immortal, he cast off worldly entanglements to inherit the fruits of transcendence. First, he met the Supreme Immortal Wáng Xuánfǔ, from whom he received the Oral Formula for Longevity. Later, he encountered the Perfected One of Huáyáng, who transmitted the Great Unity’s Knife and Spoon, the Fire Talismans of Internal Alchemy, and the profound mysteries of the Mysterious Dao.)

(Another version says that long ago, the Yellow Emperor obtained the secret formula of the Golden Elixir and concealed it in a jade casket within the Suspended Bell Cavern on Purple Gold Mountain east of Shòuchūn County. After receiving transmission from his master, the Perfected One wandered as a cloud or flowing water. Arriving in Lǔ, he dwelled in Zōuchéng, entered Kōngtóng, and resided on the Four Elders’ Peak of Purple Gold Mountain. There, an immortal led him into a cavern, where he retrieved the jade casket and its secret formula. His inner virtue perfected, he ultimately attained the wondrous Dao.)

*The Complete Transmission of the Perfect Realization* states: The Perfected One was born on the fifteenth day of the fourth month in the Hàn dynasty and ascended on the twentieth day of the fifth month during the Jìn, though the year is unrecorded.

Later, Lǚ Shàoxiān, a Táng dynasty *jìnshì*, failed the imperial examinations repeatedly and roamed the world. First, on Mount Lú, he met the Perfected One of the Fire Dragon, who transmitted sword techniques. Later, on the road to Cháng’ān, he encountered the Perfected One’s inscription on a wall:

*Sitting or lying, always with a jug of wine,*
*Never letting both eyes gaze toward the Eastern Capital.*
*In heaven and earth, nameless and unknown,*
*A carefree man of the world, a true gentleman.*

Shàoxiān bowed deeply. The Perfected One bade him compose a poem expressing his aspirations. Shàoxiān wrote:

*Born into a Confucian family in peaceful times,*
*With scholar’s cap and sash, clad in humble cloth.*
*Who in this world would vie for fame and profit?*
*I serve the Jade Emperor, returning to the Supreme Clarity.*

The Perfected One rejoiced, saying, “My dwelling is on Crane Peak in the Zhōngnán Mountains, where there is a cavern. You may follow me.” Then, through divine transformation, they arrived in an instant at a peak. The cavern’s gate shimmered with rosy clouds, and three tigers crouched before it. The Perfected One rebuked them, and they leapt into a bottomless ravine. He offered Shàoxiān the Wine of Primordial Harmony and sat upon a stone to discourse on the mysteries. Soon, a youth in blue arrived bearing a letter from Mount Pénglái, inviting the master to the Heavenly Pond to discuss the Five Primes.

As the Perfected One prepared to depart, he said to Shàoxiān, “Since you have come here to follow me in the Dao, I now name you Chà, with the courtesy name Dòngbīn. I must go now, but you should dispel worldly cares and purify your immortal bones. I shall return before long.” With three tigers guarding the gate, he mounted a white crane and slowly vanished into the southeastern clouds.

Chà then studied day and night the texts the Perfected One had left in the cavern. The next day, the Perfected One returned and asked, “Do you not long for home?” Chà replied, “I have severed worldly ties and purified my mortal bones. Having followed you to explore the wondrous Dao, how could I dare to be burdened by worldly dust again?” The Perfected One said, “Excellent! Those who guard the yīn know only the pò; those with yáng are merely wandering hún. Mortals do not understand the difference between yīn and yáng. If one can preserve the yáng and gather the wandering hún, uniting them with the yīn pò, so that yīn and yáng merge and hún and pò become true, this is called a Perfected One.”

Chà asked, “The principle is profound—how can one preserve the form?” The Perfected One replied, “When wisdom arises from obscurity and the spirit is firmly settled in serenity, the spirit merges completely—how could it not unite with the true? The golden form and jade substance arise from utmost sincerity. Once the Great Medicine is complete, the body becomes as light as flight.”

That evening, he bestowed upon him the Supreme Perfected’s Mysterious Oral Formula. Soon, someone knocked at the door—it was Zhèng Sīyuǎn of Qīngxī and the Perfected One Shī of Tàihuá, arriving from the southeast, walking leisurely through the void, their forms radiant as gold and jade. They bowed, sat together, and after a while, proceeded to the alchemical chamber of Yǐn Sīyì. There, they entered the immortal’s gate.

The Perfected One Shī asked, “Who is this attendant?” The Perfected One replied, “This is the son of Lǚ Hǎizhōu Ràng of today, originally versed in Confucianism and Mohism. Disheartened in the capital, he chanced upon me in a Cháng’ān wineshop and followed me in the Dao, mastering the subtleties of yīn-yáng refinement and the merging of form and spirit into the wondrous.”

Chà then bowed to the two immortals. The Perfected One Zhèng said, “His form is pure, his spirit present; his eyes are bright, his essence concealed. If you wish to escape the net of the world, let him compose a poem.”

They bestowed upon Chà a golden brush and rosy-cloud stationery, along with divine glue and a rhinoceros-inkstone. Standing, Chà presented a poem:

Through ten thousand kalpas and a thousand lives I’ve come to this,
At last this body, life after life, attains the lightness of flight.
I cast aside home and kingdom for the joy of cloud-wrapped peaks,
Refining soul and spirit with the essence of sun and moon.
I’ve seen worldly men debate the Nine Tripods,
Seeking the Great Elixir and visiting the Three Pure Ones.
Now, having met the faces of immortals,
My name is recorded at the gates of the Purple Palace.

The three immortals exchanged glances, sighing at his pure talent and elegant lines. Just then, spring birds chirped melodiously. The Perfected One said to Chà, “You may inscribe at the cave’s entrance: ‘Spring’s qi fills the sky, flower-dew drips; dawn’s sun strikes the sea as mountain clouds withdraw.’” Then, turning to Chà, he said, “Our audience at the Primordial Court draws near. The feathered adepts of the Ten Isles will journey to the Jade Capital to report their merits and ascend the immortal ranks. I fear you cannot long remain in this cave. We shall meet again at Dongting Lake in ten years.”

Taking up his brush, he swiftly wrote sixteen characters on the cave’s stone wall in cursive script:
*By day, lofty and bright;
By night, the moon full and clear.
Yin and yang, soul and spirit,
Merge and ascend together.*

Tossing the brush aside, he told Chà, “As you wander the world, practice the Way of beneficence. When your deeds are complete and your merit fulfilled, we shall meet again.” Suddenly, several immortals appeared, their gossamer robes shimmering, bearing golden tablets and divine talismans. They announced, “The Celestial Emperor summons Zhongli Quan.” At once, phoenixes and simurghs soared, golden banners and jade regalia trailing, their celestial music fading into the dawn as they drifted away. Chà could not bear to part. After some time, he traveled as a guest through the Jiang-Huai region and Dongting, carving inscriptions at Hubei’s Yue, the two capitals of Bian and Luo. When his Dao was perfected, he departed elsewhere.

Their profound exchanges were compiled by the immortal Shi Jianwu into *The Anthology of Zhong and Lü Transmitting the Dao*, which circulates in the world. In the first year of Jingkang during the reign of Emperor Qinzong of Song, the Perfected One was enfeoffed as the Perfected Lord of True Yang. In the sixth year of the Zhiyuan era of the Yuan dynasty, he was further honored as the Perfected Lord of True Yang, the Enlightened Transmitter of the Dao.

Liu Gang
Liu Gang was a native of Xia’na during the Jin dynasty. Initially dwelling on Siming Mountain, he later served as magistrate of Shangyu. He studied the Dao under Master Bo and administered affairs in the central region. After years of cultivation, his Dao was perfected, and he composed *Sequel to the Biographies of Immortals*, which circulated in the world. One day, he invited his relatives and old friends to a farewell gathering. After the feast, he ascended a large honey locust tree beside the county hall, over ten yards above the ground. Raising his hand in farewell, he suddenly flew into the clouds and vanished. His wife, too, attained the Dao and ascended at the same time.

Wang Lie, styled Changxiu, was a native of Na’e. He entered the eastern seas and dwelt in Baodu Mountain, where he once traveled in company with Ji Shuye. Lie obtained a stone marrow resembling maltose; he consumed half himself and gave the other half to Shuye. By the time Shuye arrived, it had all congealed into stone. Later, he entered a stone chamber, within which lay two scrolls of plain silk. Lie read them but did not recognize the characters and dared not take them, though he memorized the forms of a dozen or so. Upon returning, he transcribed them to show Shuye, who recognized all the characters. Delighted, Lie then led Shuye back to the place, clearly recalling the path. When they arrived, the stone chamber was nowhere to be found. Lie thus said to his disciples: “Shuye is not yet destined to attain immortality.”

Liu Daocheng
Liu Daocheng was a native of Xinhao in Yuzhang. He studied the arts of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi. During the Yongjia reign of Emperor Huai of Jin, he entered officialdom through his mastery of the classics and was repeatedly promoted, eventually becoming governor of Chenzhou. Later, he returned to his hometown, where he diligently maintained incense offerings and revered the True Talisman of the Great Luo. Decades later, his entire family ascended to heaven in broad daylight. Xu Xuan’s *Stele Inscription of Kaiye Abbey* records: “On the fifteenth day of the eighth month in the second year of Yongjia, the whole clan ascended; several thousand villagers gazed at the clouds as they bid farewell.” During the Datong reign of Emperor Wu of Liang, his former residence was established as Kaiye Abbey, now named Zhaode Abbey, over a hundred paces from the county seat. When Bai Yuchan visited Zhaode, Chen Lingbao composed a poem:

*I’ve seen the immortals of my homeland—no idle boast,*
*Their faces gleam like jade, radiant as cinnabar clouds.*
*Newly opened, the celestial library of scriptures,*
*Once the home of cloud-dwelling phoenixes and hounds.*
*Thirty-seven years, a heart stronger than iron,*
*Countless affairs, yet eyes unblurred by flowers.*
*Now I sense my greetings grow ever more unrefined,*
*Twice daily, bees report to the court like officials.*

Xiang Mandu
Xiang Mandu was a native of Puji in Hedong.

Xiang Mandu entered the mountains in search of immortality and returned after ten years. When his family asked the reason, Mandu said: “After three years of concentrated meditation in the mountains, an immortal came to welcome me, and together we rode a dragon to ascend to heaven. After a long while, I lowered my head to gaze at the earth—all was dark and indistinct, with no visible boundary above, and the distance from the earth was immeasurable. The dragon flew swiftly, its head and tail rising and falling. As I sat upon its back, my face turned ashen with terror. Upon reaching heaven, I first beheld the Purple Palace with its golden couches and jade tables, gleaming and resplendent—a place of true nobility. The immortal offered me but a single cup of flowing rosy clouds; after drinking it, I suddenly forgot my home. Before the heavenly beings, I lost my composure and was reprimanded, then sent back to the mortal realm. Only after further self-reflection and correction may I be permitted to return. In former times, King Liu An of Huainan, upon meeting the Great Pure Immortal Elder, was punished with three years of guarding the celestial privy for his lack of reverence in rising and sitting. Those who study the Dao thereafter—can they not be cautious?” For this reason, the people of Hedong called Mandu the “Reprimanded Immortal.”

Xu Changxuan
The Daoist Xu Qixuan resided on Mount Zhongnan during the Yuanjia reign of Emperor Wen of Song. His virtue and power were held in high esteem, and all who knew him revered him. Skilled in the arts of the Dao, he could discern good and ill fortune.

Past affairs were vividly discernible. There was once a certain Grand Master Wang, who had but one daughter, named Jin Ying in her childhood. She was a beauty of the highest order, and he cherished her deeply. One day, as Xu Qixuan wandered at leisure, he passed by the Wang residence. Observing that the house was enveloped in the lingering resentment of a past-life grievance, its rancorous qi stretching to the heavens, Qixuan asked the gatekeeper, “Is the Grand Master at home?” The gatekeeper replied, “He is.” Qixuan said, “Go and announce to him that the Daoist Xu Qixuan of Mount Zhongnan wishes to see him on a small matter.” The gatekeeper entered and relayed the message, whereupon the Grand Master immediately came out to receive him.

Qixuan said, “Do not rise hastily. I have something to consult with you—may I speak?” The Grand Master replied, “I await your instruction.” Qixuan said, “Just now, I observed that your residence is burdened by a deep grievance from a past life, and the aggrieved party seeks an opportunity for vengeance. Are you aware of this?” The Grand Master answered, “Without your sagely insight, how could I, with my mundane eyes, perceive such a thing?” Qixuan asked the household servants, both male and female, to observe, but none could see anything amiss. He then inquired, “Is there anyone else in the residence?” The Grand Master replied, “I have a daughter, Jin Ying by her childhood name. I dote on her so much that I am almost ashamed of it.” Qixuan said, “This young lady is none other than your past-life adversary. Summon her at once.”

Hearing this, the Grand Master thought it absurd, but he instructed his wife to call her. When the lady went to fetch her, they found the girl leaning against her chamber door, facing the wall, and sighing, “My past-life enmity remains unresolved, and I was about to seize the chance for vengeance—how vexing that this Daoist has revealed my past affairs!” The lady, alarmed, reported this to the Grand Master. Overwhelmed with dread, he bowed to Qixuan and pleaded, “This is a past-life feud—how may we escape it?” Qixuan replied, “It is but a small matter.” The Grand Master said, “If you, Venerable Master, would show mercy and deliver us, I would be indebted to you for life and death.” He bowed again, and Qixuan said, “No more words—let me dispel it at once.”

Qixuan then took up a sword and a bowl of water. Brandishing the sword, he spat the water and followed the Grand Master into the residence, ordering the door to be opened. Jin Ying said, “This is my grudge—what concern is it of yours?” Qixuan replied, “The Daoist gate takes salvation as its merit and aiding others as its highest duty. You must swiftly reveal your true form and no longer dwell here.” He glanced at her, then ordered a coffin and lining to be prepared, which arrived shortly after. Qixuan opened the door and beheld her transformed into white bones. He commanded the attendants to gather them and place them in a spirit carriage, instructing, “Take it beyond the city gate, travel over ten *li*, and cast it into a great grove of trees. Flee swiftly and do not look back.” The attendants followed his words, carrying it beyond the city gate for over ten *li* until they reached a vast forest, where they placed it beneath the trees and hurried back. Only after returning to the city gate did they turn to look—there, the great forest was engulfed in crimson flames that stretched to the heavens, reducing all to ashes.

The Grand Master and his wife, weeping in gratitude, bowed in thanks and offered precious treasures, silks, and coins in recompense, but Qixuan paid them no heed and departed.

Master Wan Zhen, styled Changsheng, was a native of Nanchang in Hongzhou. He attained the Dao of long life and enduring vision, and his fame flourished between the Qi and Liang dynasties, though none knew his true age. Skilled in talismans and incantations, he healed the suffering of others with immediate efficacy, and his contemporaries regarded him as a peer of Jingyang and Le Ba. Emperor Wen of Sui, having heard of his renown, held him in high esteem and decreed the construction of a meditation hall for him on Mount Hongya—this is the present-day Bingzhen Abbey. In the fifteenth year of the Zhenguan reign of Emperor Taizong of Tang, Governor Zhou Xun requested the establishment of Taiyi Abbey on the former residence of Mei Fu, and respectfully invited the Master to reside there—this is the present-day Tianning Wanshou Abbey.

Earlier, a fisherman had recovered a blue-green stone, seven feet in length, which emitted musical tones when struck. The prefecture presented it to the imperial court, and Emperor Gaozong ordered it broken open, revealing two swords. On their hilts were inscribed the Master’s name. The Emperor marveled at this.

In the second year of the Xianqing reign, Emperor Gaozong summoned the Master to the Guangyao Hall of the palace. The Emperor inquired about the Dao of governing the state and nurturing life. The Master replied: *"Without thought, without action—embrace clarity and stillness as the rectification of all under Heaven. Governing the state is like governing the body."* The Emperor honored him as both teacher and friend, bestowing gifts upon him, though the Master accepted none.

In the first year of the Longshuo reign, the Master underwent *shijie* in the capital. When the coffin was opened several days later, only a sword and a staff remained. By imperial decree, the sword and staff were encased in a bronze casket and interred beside the Heavenly Treasure Grotto on Western Mountain—this is the present-day Dongyang Abbey. The Master’s stele of virtue and achievement, composed by Prince Teng Yuan Ying of the Tang, stands within Kaiyuan Abbey.

Cao Dexiu
Cao Dexiu claimed to have journeyed from Green Islet Mountain in the Eastern Sea to travel through Jiangxi. For over thirty years, those who saw him found his countenance unchanged. He often walked among the people, healing the sick with talismans and medicines—none failed to recover. There was a man with a daughter, over twenty years of age, who was betrothed to another.

Suddenly, a malevolent spirit possessed her, and despite every treatment attempted, her condition only worsened. Her father sought out Dexiu and recounted her symptoms in full. Dexiu asked, “Does your home lie near a mountain stream with a deep pool?” The father replied that it did. Dexiu continued, “In spring, as your daughter strolled by the stream, a flood dragon spied her and has since seized and confined her essence and soul within its lair. Take this talisman of mine and cast it into the pool.” Soon after the talisman was thrown, the pool’s waters surged violently, accompanied by thunderous roars. In an instant, a creature over twenty feet long surfaced—its form resembled a black serpent, its head like a great ladle—already split open, its brains spilling forth as it perished in a pool of blood. The father returned home to find his daughter’s spirit clear and bright, her illness entirely vanished. He brought gifts of silk and wealth to express his gratitude, but Dexiu said, “I acted only to heal the sick—why offer such things?” He steadfastly refused to accept them.

Dexiu often told others, “If your household suffers illness or hardship, there is no need for wealth or silk. Come to me for talismans and medicines. Offer a platter of river fish and a flask of fine wine, feast me, and make your plea—your ailment will naturally be cured.” The villagers followed his instructions, and none failed to see results; all revered him as a divine being. Later, he suddenly announced to the people, “I shall now depart this place for the Heavenly Treasure Grotto on Western Mountain. Yet come spring, a severe cattle plague will strike. I leave you a name to transcribe and pass on: when the plague comes, feast me with offerings, inscribe this name, and affix it to the horns of your cattle—they shall suffer no harm.” That spring, a great cattle plague indeed swept through the land. In every household where the name was affixed, the cattle were spared; where it was not, they perished. The people longed for him, but he was never seen again.

The *Biography of Wang Yuanzhi* states: Cao Dexiu was a Grand Scribe of the Jin, later serving as Minister of the Board of Rites under the Later Liang. He attained the Dao of immortality.

Du Tanyong
Du Tanyong, styled Yuanlao, was also known by his Daoist name, Yuanlao. A native of Jingzhao in the Three Metropolitan Districts, his family’s official rank spanned generations until the imperial decree of the Southern Migration, when they settled in Qiantang County of Wujun. He began his career as Left Gentleman of the Household of the Grand Marshal, Prince of Yuzhang, and later served as Gentleman Attendant to Xiao Ziyun, a former official of the Southern Qi. Outwardly, he devoted himself to Confucian scholarship; inwardly, he cultivated the true Dao. When the Qi and Liang dynasties underwent revolution, he sighed deeply with emotion. Comparing his brush to the reins of a carriage and his arrogance to the bonds of the world, he cast off the trappings of prosperity, shook out his robes, and departed. He journeyed far to the Min and Long regions, sojourned in Lin Tao and Emei, then returned to his old mountains—more than two years had passed.

Later, he passed through Juqu, seeking the Dao and searching for the true. He devoted himself wholly to the gates of the teachings, humble and serene in silence, so that none knew what he practiced. In the twelfth year of the Tianjian era of Emperor Wu of Liang (the year *jiazi*), he set down his staff and emerged from the valley. From Qiantang, he lightly loaded his family onto a boat and sailed south to Yushun Mountain in Luling Commandery, where he rebuilt the Pavilion of Pure Emptiness as his dwelling. At the time, the forest

From this point onward, disciples seeking the Dao followed in his footsteps. The next year, he entered the Great Emptiness Grotto-Heaven of Fa Le, and with the resources he had brought, constructed several dozen rafters for living quarters. He rebuilt the palace halls, personally inscribed a grand stele, and recorded the wonders of the grotto-heaven. He established fields in the Oriole Valley west of the grotto, as well as in the western mountains beside the grotto—Great Dragon’s South Gully, Great Boulder, and Melon Source—so that those who cultivated truth and nurtured the Dao might have sustenance, and he inscribed the name "Grotto-Heaven Stone Terrace" upon them.

That same year he entered the grotto, Emperor Wu, having heard of his reputation, bestowed upon him the title Master of the Golden Watchtower. Xiao Zhen, too, came from the lands south of the Yangtze with his kin, sailing to join him, and took him as his teacher. He received the secret Dao and personally inscribed a stele to commemorate Du’s virtue. This was the seventh year of the Putong era.

Later, while the Master remained in the grotto, he and his disciple, the Gentleman of Outer Affairs Qian, refined the secret of the Nine Cauldrons’ Returned Elixir. Spirit immortals descended frequently, foretelling that his ascension was near. When the elixir was complete, he and Qian consumed it atop the summit of Mount Taibai, and in broad daylight, they ascended to the heavens in a most manifest manner. His family became earthbound immortals, concealing themselves in the rear grotto.

Xiao Ziyun, styled Jingmu, was a grandson of Emperor Gao of the Southern Qi and the son of Yu Jing, the Prince of Wenxian. He was a descendant of He, the Chancellor of Han. Among his sixteen brothers, all were enfeoffed as commandery dukes. When Emperor Wu of Liang received the abdication, in the early years of the Tianjian era, Xiao Ziyun, then twelve, had his rank reduced to viscount. In his youth, he was drawn to the Dao, aspiring to uprightness and tranquility, and took no pleasure in official advancement. Though he held eminent office, he often conversed and laughed in secret with extraordinary persons. He was repeatedly promoted, serving as Aide of Danyang Commandery, then soon after as Gentleman of the Yellow Gate and Left Director of the Department of the Grand Master of Ceremonies.

Xiao Ziyun often journeyed with his family to the famous mountains of Jiangbiao. One day, he set sail to visit the Jade Bamboo of Luling. Upon first arriving at the Pavilion of Clarity and Emptiness, he found that Du Yuanlao had already attained the Dao at Jade Bamboo. A former colleague from the Southern Qi court, they met again with the same warmth as before, and Xiao treated him as his master. Traveling to the grotto heavens, he gained much of Du’s esoteric teachings. He personally carved an inscription in stone to extol Du’s virtue.

Later, passing through the southeastern range of Jade Bamboo’s interconnected mountains and layered cliffs—now called Xiaoshan—he left behind altars, furnaces, and mortar pits, the traces of which remain to this day. Just then, an imperial edict from Emperor Wu of Liang arrived, summoning him to court along with his son, Xiao Te, and entrusting his family to the capital. Upon arrival, he was appointed Gentleman of the Palace. His mastery of cursive and clerical scripts further enhanced his reputation. Xiao Te was also skilled in calligraphy and held the post of Attendant Gentleman of the Palace, but he predeceased his father.

In the first year of the Taiqing era, during Hou Jing’s rebellion, Xiao Ziyun was among the captured court officials. Though over sixty, his bearing was extraordinary, and his spirit remained transcendent. Fearing he would not escape disaster, he hastily returned to Xiaoshan, later relocating again to the Pavilion of Clarity and Emptiness. In the fifth year, a divine being suddenly descended and declared: “To the northeast lies a dense grove, where a ravine’s waters flow eastward—there you may dwell long.” Xiao moved his family and settled there.

After two twelve-year cycles, the Celestial Emperor bestowed upon him a jade tablet, appointing him as Chief Administrator of Wuzhou and Keeper of the Registers of the Blessed Grove’s Felicitous Court—a divine immortal’s office. Together with eighty-two fellow immortals of the prefecture, he vanished from the world, never to be seen again. The matter was kept secret, known to few. Later, those who entered the grotto would occasionally glimpse his dwelling.

Should one seek him with single-minded devotion, he would remain forever unattainable.

Ding Xuanzhen—Master Ding’s religious name—styled Zhongcheng, was a native of Deyang. By nature diligent and keen, he observed the precepts with utmost rigor, earning the reverence of his village. Once, he encountered a master of esoteric arts and received transmission of a teaching both subtle and wondrous. Thereby, he gained command over spirits and demons, bending them to his will without fail.

He often remarked that the land of Kangwang Valley was most numinous and refined. At its mouth stood the Temple of the Bronze Horse, said to house a bronze steed cast by Wang Mang of Han. Over time, a spirit had possessed it, wreaking havoc as a malevolent entity—devouring livestock, crops, and even the people’s belongings—until the villagers built a shrine to appease it. Xuanzhen, disdaining such practices, demolished the temple and erected a sanctuary of true teaching upon the site. He then cast the bronze horse into the Southern River, yet before the men returned, the steed had already reappeared in its former place. Xuanzhen severed its left foreleg, whereupon the horse transformed into a human figure, weeping and pleading, “Grant me but a place to feed.” Xuanzhen then relocated its shrine to the west of the ravine, permitting it to remain so long as it ceased its depredations.

Further ahead lay the Poison Dragon Pool. One storm-wracked, murky day, two dragons emerged to sport with a pearl, its radiance dazzling the gloom. Xuanzhen rebuked them and seized the pearl, placing it within his sanctuary. The dragons followed, snatching back the pearl, and when they failed to retrieve it, they spewed saliva across the floor. Then, upon the sanctuary’s pillars—where the painter Zhang Sengyao had depicted two dragons—they took flight, summoning wind and thunder to shatter the eaves and beams. Xuanzhen inscribed an iron talisman, cast an iron bell, and subdued the pool’s dragon, which fled westward through the mountain. He then drove an iron nail into the pillar, piercing the painted dragons’ eyes, and the calamity ceased. Thus, all manner of spirits and anomalies fled the land, and the site became a court of blessing.

This occurred in the tenth year of Emperor Wen of Sui’s *Kaihuang* era. The Prefect of Jiangzhou memorialized the events to the throne, and the emperor, struck by their marvel, issued an edict of praise and honor, commanding the prefecture to accord Xuanzhen due reverence. In the third year of Emperor Yang’s *Daye* era, he departed this world, and that very night, a white light stretched across the southeastern sky. Only after Xuanzhen’s passing did it fade. He was seventy-eight.

Master Liu, whose personal name is unknown, dwelt at Yuntai Abbey in Huayin during the *Zhenguan* era of Emperor Taizong of Tang. For twenty years, he refined his *qi* and abstained from grain. Each year, on the Three Yuan fasts, a man clad in a patched robe of coarse cloth, his appearance plain and swarthy, would arrive and take the lowest seat. When the fast concluded, he would depart in silence. This continued for over a decade, yet his garments and complexion never altered. Finding him strange, Master Liu questioned him, to which the man replied: “I am surnamed Zhang, named Gongbi, and dwell in the northeast corner of Lianhua Peak.” Master Liu, supposing the place uninhabited, asked to accompany him. Gongbi assented, saying, “It is most pleasant there. If you wish to stay, there will be no hindrance.” After journeying over twenty *li*, grasping vines and creepers, they came upon a path barely wide enough for crows. The cliffs and ravines were perilously sheer, impassable even to apes and monkeys. Yet to Gongbi, it was as level as a thoroughfare, and Master Liu followed without difficulty.

They arrived at a stone wall towering over a thousand *ren*, its base overlooking a bottomless gorge. A path, mere inches wide, allowed only the edge of one’s foot. Gongbi tapped the wall with his finger, and a voice from within asked who it was. “It is I,” he replied. Suddenly, a door opened, revealing a world of boundless expanse, teeming with all things under heaven. As Gongbi led Master Liu to enter, the man within grew angry: “Why have you brought an outsider?” He shut the door, and the wall became solid stone once more. Gongbi said, “This is no stranger—he is Master Liu of Yuntai Abbey, an old acquaintance. Let us enter together.” The door opened again to admit them. Gongbi said, “Master, since you have come, he may prepare a meal.” The man asked if Master Liu would stay, to which the latter replied he would return another day. The man then took a bowl of water, mixed it with a powder from the blade in his green pouch at his elbow, and offered it to Master Liu to drink. Its taste was sweet and fragrant.

Gongbi said, “I have often spoken of the joys of this mountain. Why not perform for the master’s amusement?” The man sprinkled water into the valley, and soon a black dragon and a white elephant appeared, dancing in perfect harmony. A vermilion phoenix and a green *luan* bird sang in antiphonal clarity. Gongbi and Master Liu bade farewell and stepped outside. After walking several dozen paces and turning back, they saw only towering cliffs and deep ravines. As they neared the abbey, Gongbi took his leave. Master Liu returned, settled his affairs, and sought Gongbi again, but each step was fraught with peril, and he could not proceed. Thereafter, Gongbi never returned.

Li Yuanji
Li Yuanji was a man of the early *Wude* era of Emperor Gaozu of Tang.

Deep in the Hidden Vine Mountain, he possessed Daoist arts and could vanish while sitting or standing, leaving others baffled. Often traveling, he healed people with talismans and medicines. He extracted tiger bones, needled the shadow of magpies, and revived countless fish and turtles. By day he wandered forth, but at nightfall he halted, sleeping exposed in the wild grasses. In the final years of Emperor Daizong’s reign, while in Jianchang County, he covered his body with pine and cypress branches and flew away. Later, someone gathering herbs on Hidden Vine Mountain saw Yuanji riding a green deer, moving as if in flight; when questioned, he gave no answer, and none knew where he had gone.

Master Chen Daozhong
The Dharma Master bore the surname Chen and the given name Daochong. He was a native of Deyang. While his mother was pregnant, she dreamed of heavenly immortals entering her chamber. At birth, he bore extraordinary marks. As a child, he neither drank wine nor ate meat, and whenever he heard others expounding sutras or discoursing on the Dao, he would incline his ear to listen intently. As he grew, his precepts and conduct were lofty and pure, and he transmitted the Dharma records to extraordinary men. He then built a hermitage on a separate peak of Purple Empyrean, a place of surpassing beauty. He had eight or nine disciples, all of whom observed strict precepts and were learned; the standards of his gate were most exacting, and he did not casually receive others. Those of his time who were favored with his company were said to have ascended the Dragon Gate, a comparison to Li Ying of the Han. Daochong was deeply devoted to Laozi and Zhuangzi, and not merely did he recite their words—he thoroughly grasped their principles. He once declared, “Our teaching fundamentally follows Laozi and Zhuangzi, and the intent of Laozi and Zhuangzi is originally to awaken and illuminate the nature-ground. Thus their words often say, ‘Nothing is better than clarity’—this is their essential point. Later people merely practice techniques and cling to the superficial, missing the mark by far.” Morning and evening, he invariably lectured to his assembled disciples. He composed a treatise that circulated in the world. In the spring of the twenty-first year of the Zhenguan era of Emperor Taizong of Tang, he suddenly told his disciples, “I wish to travel to the famous mountains.” The assembly, considering his age, urged him to desist. Daochong replied, “I must go.”

At midday, he dissolved into transformation—he was one hundred fourteen years old. His complexion remained as in life, and his body was still supple. When the coffin was lifted, it felt as though it held nothing; people believed he had ascended as an immortal.

**Wang Shouyi**
Wang Shouyi, in the early Zhenguan era of Emperor Taizong of Tang, styled himself "Wang the Commoner of Mount Zhongnan" in Luoyang. He sold medicine in the Luoyang marketplace. A wealthy man named Liu Xinwei had an only son with a fleshy growth above his brow. The commoner drew a pill from his gourd and gave it to him; in an instant, the growth burst open, and a small serpent, resplendent in five colors, leapt forth, growing to over a *zhang* in length. Wang shouted at it, and the serpent soared upward, clouds and mist darkening the sky. Wang mounted the serpent and flew away.

*Volume Thirty-One of* Comprehensive Mirror of Immortals Who Embodied the Dao *concludes here.*
*Volume Thirty-Two of* Comprehensive Mirror of Immortals Who Embodied the Dao

**Master He the Venerable**
Master He the Venerable—no one knew his origins—dwelt on Mount Heng during the Longshuo era of Emperor Gaozong of Tang, concealing his name and lineage. His countenance resembled that of a man of forty, and he moved as swiftly as the wind. He often traveled between Cangwu and the Five Ridges, coming without desire and departing without instruction. For over a hundred years, people frequently saw him, his appearance unchanged. When asked about his clan, he would only say, "He, he." When questioned about his homeland or cultivation, he likewise replied, "He, he." Thus, people called him Master He the Venerable. Though his robes were tattered and his sandals worn, his heart was vast as the void.

Daoists Tian Xuying and Deng Zhongxu once asked him, "Master, you never speak—how can you enlighten disciples?" He replied, "To know and yet not know is supreme; to not know and yet know is inferior. Who can chisel the apertures of chaos or awaken to the principle of spontaneity?" Then, leaning on a flowering staff, he entered the forest and vanished. Soon after, a pack of tigers followed him, and he was seen no more.

During the Kaiyuan era of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang, Sima Chengzhen traveled to Mount Heng. Gazing at Zhurong Peak, he remarked, "A lofty immortal must dwell here—how else could the qi and color be so extraordinary?" Presently, he saw the Venerable Master in the forest. Chengzhen paid his respects and posed questions, but the Master sat upon a rock as if seeing nothing. Receiving no answer, Chengzhen withdrew, sighing, "This is one who may be called whole, whose virtue is unexpressed in words." He then built a hut on Zhurong Peak to invite the Master, who came and never again emerged. The regional inspector, Lü Wei, visited the hut to receive talismans and mantras. Though Zhang Taikong, Tian Xuying, and Deng Zhongxu served as his disciples, none grasped his essential teaching.

On the Lower Prime Day of the second year of the Tianbao era, clouds and cranes soared in the sky, and a rare fragrance filled the air. He told his disciples, "After I depart, you shall find me on the coiled stone of the southern peak of Purple Canopy." Then he transformed, his complexion unchanged.

The disciples then encircled him and performed the rites for transmuting the spirit. At midnight, a thunderous roar shook the heavens, and he vanished from their sight. The Prefect of Hengyang, Su Wulian, composed the inscription for his stele.

The Daoist Liu Zhigu, styled Guangxuan, hailed from Pengcheng in Pei. His lineage traced back twelve generations to Prince Jing of Zhongshan, all of whom had attained prominence. His great-grandfather, Ying, passed the imperial examination for filial piety and incorruptibility during the Sui dynasty and served as Magistrate of Linna; thus, his grandfather and father settled in Linna. His mother, the Lady Wu, conceived him after an auspicious dream. Born with wisdom, he displayed intelligence in childhood, elegance in youth, and uprightness in maturity. He regarded fame and profit as foes and devoted himself solely to the Dao. During the Longshuo era of Emperor Gaozong of Tang, he left home to become a Daoist of the Three Caverns at Taiqing Abbey. He mastered the esoteric teachings of the Eight Lords and the Elegant Chapters, the secret registers of the Three Simplicities, the principles of alchemical classics and pulse diagnosis, and the arts of transcending death and returning to life.

Emperor Ruizong summoned him to court to inquire about Daoist affairs. Pleased with his responses, the emperor bestowed special honors upon him and sent him back to the mountains. During the Kaiyuan era of Emperor Xuanzong, when natural disasters and epidemics afflicted the land, with eight or nine out of ten people falling ill, the emperor called upon Zhigu to treat them. Sighing, he declared: "Even the Sage of the Fire Virtue and the Star Lord suffer from pestilence. Lowering oneself to refine medicines and examining voices as a physician—how far is this from moxibustion and acupuncture?" Thereupon, he diagnosed illness by observing complexion and cured it by regulating qi. Thus, he could dissolve obstructions deep as the Gaohuang and disperse stagnation like melting snow, so exquisite was his skill. The emperor favored him with gifts, all of which he declined.

In the nineteenth year of the Tianbao era, Zhigu was ordered to assist the Minister of the Interior, Tian Sichong, in conducting a grand jiao ritual for the Twenty-Four Lords. After some time, he requested to return to Shu and offered his residence to be converted into Daqianqiu Abbey. The emperor personally inscribed the plaque and bestowed it upon him, while Li Yong composed the stele inscription.

As his elder brother followed Confucianism and his younger brother embraced Buddhism, Zhigu installed images of the Three Teachings to honor them. Duke Zhang Yue of Yi, having heard of his reputation, was delighted and composed the *Inscription on the Three Teachings*, which read:

*"The upright qi generates spirits,
Weaving emptiness into reality.
The Supreme Clarity venerates the Emperor,
The Central Yellow guards the emergence.
Robed in radiant hues,
They dwell in palaces of vacuity.
Riding the purple aurora, they mount the Dipper;
From the red furnace, they drink the sun.
The Ten Heavens and the Twenty Thousand Spirits
Receive their commands from this.
The Lotus of the Buddha’s gate,
The Unicorn’s horn of Confucian arts—
Their dharma is not two,
Their minds attain the One.
The mind of Dao is subtle;
Guard it and never lose it."*

Later, on the emperor’s birthday, the abbey was renamed Tianchang Abbey. Once, a guest taught him the arts of alchemical transmutation. Though the abbey’s halls and pavilions were grand and magnificent, costing tens of thousands, he never sought funds from others. When the construction was complete, the guest returned and arranged to meet him at Funiushan in Shuyang, where an ancient abbey stood. There, he restored it and took up residence.

The guest then transmitted to him the *Divine Tiger’s Treasure Scripture*, the *Hidden Writings of Supreme Clarity*, and the essentials of the *High Ascent to the Dao*. After practicing these for ten years, a light suddenly appeared in his chamber, and a stalk of cinnabar lingzhi mushroom grew, emitting a metallic resonance when struck. In a dream, a divine being told him: "Behind the mountain, within a stone cliff, lies a golden fish. Mount it, and you may ascend to the heavens. Without this mushroom to strike the stone, it cannot be obtained." At dawn, he searched for the golden fish but found no trace. That night, he dreamed again: "It lies beneath the dripping spring." Arriving there, he struck the stone with the mushroom, and with a roar like thunder, the massive boulder split open. He found a golden fish, over three feet long. Mounting it, he soared into the sky, enveloped in swirling clouds and mist, and departed.

Wang Yu.

Wang Yu resided on Green Gauze Mountain in Luoyang. The villagers had known him for several hundred years, yet he retained the appearance of youth. Dwelling in seclusion amid serene landscapes, he cultivated lingzhi mushrooms, medicinal herbs, and flowering trees, all with meticulous method. He authored three scrolls titled *Miscellaneous Records of Mountain Dwelling*. Daily sustenance came from powdered lingzhi blossoms, which he exchanged for green-skiff rice. His arts spread throughout the world. At times, he wandered renowned mountains; at others, he sojourned in Jingzhou.

During the reign of Emperor Gaozong of Tang, when the Wu clan wielded power and their might overshadowed the realm, only Wu Youxu, the Crown Prince’s Attendant and nephew to the Heavenly Empress, withdrew to avoid disaster. He settled in Songyang, where he took Wang Yu as his teacher and master, receiving from him the secrets of guiding, nurturing, and refining qi. Wang Yu told him: "To forsake noble rank for the immortal’s path is a difficult endeavor. It demands unwavering resolve in the forests and valleys, fulfilling its principles in full. Do not let the summons of imperial edicts sway your resolve."

In the Kaiyuan era of Emperor Xuanzong, Wang Yu was summoned to the capital and received with great favor and courtesy. Earlier, the emperor had obtained on Mount Mao the original manuscripts of the Seven Perfected of Yang and Xu, along with the calligraphy of Tao the Recluse for the various Shangqing scriptures. After receiving the *Three Caverns’ Precious Records* from Sima Baiyun, he later sought the *True Scripture of the Original Traces* from Li Yuanjing. For the dozen or so missing pages in Yang Jun’s hand, he dispatched Wang Yu with imperial letters and gifts to Purple Yang Abbey, entreating Master Yuanjing to complete them, saying: "I do not wish to send lesser officials to trouble you. Entrusting this mission to you alone, I hope the immortal’s brush may bridge past and present." On the day of his arrival, sacred cranes soared and cried. As the scriptures were being supplemented, an extraordinary fragrance filled the air, and divine beings descended into Yuanjing’s chamber—all responses to his profound sincerity.

After returning to the capital, Wang Yu requested, a year later, to return to his old mountain. He never again wandered the imperial city.

Wang Yu frequently corresponded with Minister Daxi. After Wang’s death, Daxi visited his abode with staff and sandals, only then learning that he had undergone *shijie*—transcendence through simulated death.

Wu Daoyuan, originally named Wu Daozi, had mastered the arts of the immortals. After traveling widely among the people, he changed his name to Daoyuan. His painting was divinely inspired, surpassing all others in skill. When Emperor Xuanzong of Tang heard of him, he summoned him to the palace. There, a freshly plastered wall several *xun* in length awaited his brush. The emperor asked what Daoyuan required, to which he replied: "Have the wall draped with curtains and bring me a vat of ink." The emperor complied. In an instant, Daoyuan drew back the curtains, scooped the ink onto the wall, and with a single vigorous sweep, covered it again. After a brief moment, the emperor inquired about the progress of the landscape. Daoyuan replied: "It is finished. Pray, Your Majesty, behold it." The emperor approached and saw mountains, waters, forests, and trees, along with human dwellings, birds, and beasts—all rendered in exquisite detail. The craftsmanship was so extraordinary that even the finest court painters could not rival it. The emperor gazed in admiration for a long while, then Daoyuan slowly stepped forward and pointed, saying: "Beneath this cliff lies a small grotto, home to many immortals. If one knocks, they will surely respond." He tapped the spot with his finger, and suddenly a door opened, revealing a young attendant. Daoyuan addressed the emperor: "This grotto may be entered, and its wonders are many. I shall go first; may Your Majesty follow." With that, he leapt inside. From within, he beckoned to the emperor, who could not pass through. The door then closed. Moments later, guards outside the palace reported: "Wu Daozi has leapt over the imperial walls and vanished—his whereabouts are unknown." The emperor returned to inspect the wall, only to find it smooth and white as before, the painted landscape gone.

Yan Zhenqing, styled Qingchen, was a descendant of Yan Shigu in the fifth generation. A man of broad learning and literary skill, he served his parents with filial devotion. During the Kaiyuan era of Emperor Xuanzong, he passed the imperial examinations and was later promoted to the post of Investigating Censor. His later virtues and deeds are recorded in detail in the *Old唐书*. Ouyang Xiu’s *Catalogue of Ancient Inscriptions* notes: "Yan Zhenqing authored and inscribed the *Stele of the Altar of Lady Ma Gu*. Though his loyalty and righteousness shone as brightly as the sun and moon, he was not immune to the allure of tales of immortals. How deeply have the old ways of Daoists and Buddhists troubled this people!"

The *Qingsuo Gaoyi* records: "Ouyang Yongshu and Mei Shengyu once traveled to Mount Song in a drunken state. Gazing at the towering cliffs of the western peak, they saw four large cinnabar characters inscribed there: *Grotto of Divine Clarity*. Yongshu pointed them out to Shengyu, who saw nothing. Yongshu said no more. Later, when he retired from office, he composed a poem:

*Four cinnabar words on a cliff ten thousand feet high,*
*The Grotto of Divine Clarity locks its towers away.*
*Gazing to the ends of the rosy clouds, none come near—*
*Only phoenix and crane await my arrival today.*

A few days later, he passed away. Throughout his life, he never spoke of immortals or transcendents, yet his convictions in the Way were thus."

In the fourth year of the Jianzhong era, Emperor Dezong dispatched Yan Zhenqing to punish Li Xilie. All within and without knew he would not return, and his kin bid him farewell at the Slope of Everlasting Joy. Intoxicated, Zhenqing leapt and danced before the front pillar, saying: "Long ago, a Daoist told me: 'Tao Baba bestowed upon me the Elixir of Azure Radiance, and to this day I have not declined.' He also said: 'At seventy, misfortune shall turn to fortune, and one day, await me on Mount Luofu.' Could this be the misfortune of today?" Upon reaching Daliang, Xilie ordered him strangled, and his body was placed south of the city. When Xilie was defeated, his family opened the coffin and found his countenance as if alive, his entire body golden, his nails grown beyond his hands, and his beard and hair several feet long. He was reburied in the northern mountains of Yanshi, an event recorded in the seventeenth year of Emperor Minghuang’s reign.

Yan Zhenqing had once obtained and consumed a divine elixir. Later, when killed by Li Xilie, his coffin was reopened after Xilie’s defeat, and his face appeared as in life. The recluse Cao Yong remarked: "Thirty years hence, he shall burst forth, soaring aloft, clad in feathered robes, wandering the mountains and marshes. This is what is called an *earthly immortal*." Later, a merchant traveling to Mount Luofu encountered two Daoists playing go beneath a tree. One asked: "Who comes here?" The merchant replied: "A humble traveler from Luoyang." The Daoist smiled and said: "Then kindly deliver a letter to my family." He sent a boy to fetch paper and brush

Initially, he secluded himself in the northwest of Magu Altar. Later, while returning home to visit his parents, he chanced upon a divine sword along the way and wore it at his side. His nature was resolute and unyielding, and he carried himself with the confidence of one destined to save the world. Whenever he rested among the streams and valleys, he would recite the *Tianpeng Incantation* without cease, until at last he moved the Northern Emperor to dispatch a divine messenger to instruct him in the sword’s art. He journeyed far to seek out Zhu Ling of Mount Nanyue, paid homage at the Green Jade and Radiant Heaven Altars, and offered rites to the Perfected One Deng. There, he dreamed of a revelation.

During the Kaiyuan era of Emperor Minghuang of Tang, he was summoned to the Datong Hall, where he performed rites for the protection of the northern frontier and was enfeoffed as *Heavenly Master*. For twenty-seven years, he cultivated merit and virtue, until one day he saw a tiger-drawn chariot and a dragon carriage appear, with two attendants bearing tallies standing in the courtyard. Turning to his friend Zhu Wuyou, he said: "This comes to welcome me. Petition on my behalf that I be permitted to return for burial on my native mountain, and that a temple be established beside the altar." Emperor Minghuang granted his request, and afterward, he underwent *shijie*—transformation through the corpse.

**Yiqi Xuanjie**
Yiqi Xuanjie had the complexion of a child and the fragrant purity of his breath. He often rode a yellow mare, which neither ate fodder nor wore bridle or reins, its back cushioned only by a green felt mat. He wandered between Qingzhou and Yanzhou, speaking of events a thousand years past as though he had witnessed them with his own eyes. When Emperor Xianzong of Tang heard of his extraordinary gifts, he summoned him to court. There, Xuanjie was lodged in a chamber on Mount Jiuhua, seated upon a purple *jiá* mat, and served wine infused with dragon’s essence. Each day, the emperor visited him personally, treating him with profound reverence. Yet Xuanjie remained simple and unrefined, never once observing the etiquette of a subject.

The emperor then asked, *"Master, your years are many, yet your countenance remains unaged—how is this so?"*
Xuanjie replied, *"I cultivate and consume enchanted herbs from the shores of the Eastern Sea."* Thereupon, he planted three varieties before the palace hall: the first, *Twin-Unicorn Fungus*; the second, *Six-Harmonies Sunflower*; the third, *Ten-Thousand-Root Vine*. The emperor partook of them and felt their numinous efficacy.

At that time, the Western Regions presented two exquisite jades, one round and one square. Xuanjie declared, *"These are the Dragon-and-Tiger Jades. The round was born in water—treasured by dragons. The square was born in mountains—treasured by tigers."* When envoys were dispatched to inquire, they indeed learned the jades had been obtained from hunters and fishermen.

Xuanjie wished to return to the Eastern Sea and petitioned the emperor, who did not grant leave. One day, the palace artisans carved a replica of the Three Isles of the Eastern Sea, adorning it lavishly with pigments and inlaying it with pearls and jades. On New Year’s Day, the emperor and Xuanjie beheld it together. The emperor pointed to Penglai and sighed, *"Were one not an immortal transcendent, none could ever reach such a realm."*
Xuanjie smiled and said, *"The Three Isles lie but a foot’s measure away—who says they are hard to attain? Though I am unworthy, I shall attempt a journey for Your Majesty, to gather its wonders and judge their beauty or baseness."* With that, his form rose into the void, gradually diminishing in size. In an instant, he vanished into the golden and silver towers. Though attendants called out repeatedly, he was seen no more.

The emperor, lost in longing and regret, nearly fell gravely ill. He named the isle *Hidden Perfection Isle*. Ten days later, a report arrived from Qingzhou: Xuanjie had been seen riding his mare across the sea.

**Xu Bingyan**
The scholar Xu Bingyan dwelled at the foot of Mount Qi.

During the *Zhenyuan* era of Emperor Dezong of Tang, Xu Bingyan sat for the imperial examinations but failed to pass. While studying at the Haotian Temple in Chang’an for over a month, he lost three horses in succession, leaving him unable to travel. Seeking another fine steed, a foreigner led a horse to him, claiming it was of unmatched speed. Bingyan wished to purchase it but remained doubtful. At the temple was a Daoist skilled in divination, so Bingyan asked him to cast a hexagram. The reading was *Qian*: *"The flying dragon soars in the heavens—auspicious to meet a great person."* The Daoist said, *"This horse is of dragon lineage. Through it, you shall meet a great person, and all affairs will be harmonious."* Others scoffed at the absurdity, but Bingyan alone believed and bought the horse. Though he tended to it with care, its coat and hide remained lackluster.

Later, when Lord Wei was stationed as military governor in western Shu, Bingyan—once a retainer under him—traveled to the region to pay his respects. Passing through Jian’ge, the horse startled and lost its footing, plunging both rider and mount into a ravine tens of thousands of feet deep. They landed upon a bed of withered leaves, unharmed. Gazing upward at the sheer cliffs, Bingyan saw no way to climb out.

After a long while, Bingyan prayed aloud: *"I am not Liu Bei, nor are you the steed of Lu. There is no way to leap free."* Sighing, he said, *"Ah, how mistaken was the Daoist’s divination!"* Thereupon, he removed the horse’s bit and bridle, stripped off its saddle and pad, and let it roam as it pleased.

After what seemed a full day, Bingyan groped among the stone crevices and gradually found footing. Stepping upon fist-sized chestnuts, he gathered and ate them, which greatly eased his hunger and thirst. Thus he traveled some tens of *li* more, until the crevices grew brighter. Suddenly, as if emerging from a cave’s mouth, he beheld a level expanse of several *li*, resplendent with spring’s glory. Over ten thousand peach trees flourished in emerald verdure, and among the blossoms lay a pool of blue-green stone. Beside it stood a stone hut, within which a Daoist—white-haired and ruddy-faced—reclined upon a stone couch, attended by two jade maidens.

Bingyan prostrated himself and bowed twice. The maidens cried out in alarm: *"Who are you, to suddenly appear in the chamber of the Great One, Primordial Lord?"* Bingyan recounted the whole affair, and the maidens reported it to the Primordial Lord. The Lord summoned Bingyan, who knelt and touched his forehead to the ground in reverence.

*"What do you favor in the human realm?"* the Primordial Lord asked.
*"I favor the Dao,"* Bingyan replied, *"and have read much of *Zhuangzi*, *Laozi*, and the *Huangting Jing*."*
*"What lines have you grasped from each of the Three Daoist texts? Recite them one by one."*
Bingyan answered: *"Zhuangzi says, ‘The perfected person breathes through their heels.’ Laozi says, ‘Their essence is most true.’ The *Huangting Jing* says, ‘Simply contemplate this one scripture for boundless longevity.’"*
The Primordial Lord nodded: *"You have drawn near the Dao."* Then he commanded Bingyan to sit, and the jade maidens poured stone marrow for him to drink. *"Even Xi Kang could not obtain this,"* they said. *"That you do is your destined fortune."* Bingyan knelt in thanks and drank.

One of the maidens then announced: *"The Daoist of Ying has arrived."* The Primordial Lord ordered a couch prepared, and a Daoist entered—long-browed, thick-lipped, with an imposing, ancient countenance. He held a divining rod and knelt in greeting. The Primordial Lord welcomed him: *"Why have you come from afar?"*
*"I came to pay my respects,"* the Daoist replied.
*"Then let us test your calculations on two matters,"* said the Primordial Lord. *"First, what spirit cleaved Mount Hua? Second, what ghost erected the bridge over the sea? I have not been able to discern these."*
The Daoist spread his divining rods with a rustling sound, perusing the Three Realms and deliberating the Six Directions, ranging from the highest heavens to the deepest springs. After a long while, he declared: *"Though it is said the Giant Spirit cleft Mount Hua, in truth it was the spirit of Kuafu. Though the sea-bridge’s builder is called a hideous monster, it was the ghost of the Five Ding."* The Primordial Lord nodded: *"Just so."*

*"Now calculate what I shall do this very night,"* he said.
The Daoist cast his rods again: *"Tonight, the Primordial Lord will journey eastward thirty thousand *li*."*
*"Why so far?"* the Lord asked.
Bingyan, gazing intently at the Daoist, recognized him as the one who had divined about the horse. Astonished, he marveled at the turn of events. The Daoist said: *"The *Qian* hexagram of that day is fulfilled today."* Bingyan bowed his head in gratitude.

Presently, a transcendent youth arrived, riding a deer-dragon, and announced: *"The Lord of the Eastern Marchmount has sent me to welcome the Primordial Lord. Tonight, you are to admire the moon at Qulong Mountain."* The Primordial Lord clapped his hands and laughed: *"The Daoist’s divination was correct!"* The Daoist respectfully took his leave, and the Primordial Lord said: *"Tell Xing Hepu for me."*
*"As you command,"* the Daoist replied.

To Bingyan, the Primordial Lord said: *"You may accompany me to Qulong Mountain."* They bathed in the pool and together mounted the deer-dragon, arriving in an instant. There, they beheld a perilous bridge a thousand paces long, its towering pillars stretching ten thousand *xun*, like a rainbow spanning the azure sky or a silken sash trailing across the heavens. Its form linked the Milky Way, its reflection plunged into the deep blue sea. Gleaming jade bore no dust, and clouds congealed without dispersing.

The Primordial Lord bade Bingyan bow to the Lord of the Eastern Marchmount, who said: *"You are the grandson of Prefect Xu."* Bingyan replied: *"I was orphaned young and do not know what office my ancestor held."* The Lord of the Eastern Marchmount said: *"Last night, I drank with your grandfather and knew you would come."*

He then commanded a transcendent youth to pour sweet wine, and the three drank together. The Primordial Lord asked: *"How fares the sea of late?"*
*"Compared to our last gathering, it has receded by half,"* the Lord of the Eastern Marchmount replied. *"Alas, the mulberry fields will not be long in coming."*

He ordered the jade maidens to sing the *"Song of the Master of Qingcheng"* to toast the Primordial Lord:
*"Moonlit jade steps where spring water drips like milk,
Jade flutes urge the phoenix to dance amid the mist.
Where does the Master of Qingcheng wander?
A crane’s cry pierces the sky, a wisp of cloud remains."*

The transcendent youths struck jade chimes and joined in harmony. When the feast reached its height, the Lord of the Eastern Marchmount took up a jade tablet and inscribed a poem:
*"The Bridge of Creation spans the eastern sea,
The jade wheel rolls past, crushing the rainbow bright.
A rainbow sash seems to brush the peak of Yingzhou,
The luminous breath stealthily dissolves the lock of decay."*

The Primordial Lord continued:
*"A perilous bridge arches on stone above the clouds,
Riding a deer, the view is vast and boundless.
The luminous soul washes the mist, the azure sky clears,
Osmanthus blooms brush the cold jade hairpin."*

He then asked Bingyan to compose a verse. Bingyan said:
*"Atop Qulong Bridge, I feast on Yingzhou’s fare,
A mortal bone, I join the boundless wanderer’s flight.
No need for a cinnabar ladder to tread the empyrean—
A crystal platter gleams in osmanthus autumn’s light."*

Then red luan birds sang, and colorful phoenixes danced. Pipes and flutes resounded beyond the heavens, while zither and lute melodies drifted down to the mortal realm. The transcendent revelers, their joy complete, prepared their chariots and palanquins. They ordered Bingyan to mount a deer-dragon and return with them. Looking down upon a great city below, Bingyan asked: *"What place is this?"*

The Perfected Lord said: *"This is Silla."*
They then arrived at a small town by the sea. Again, Bingyan asked: *"What place is this?"*
*"This is Dengzhou in the Tang realm,"* came the reply.

In an instant, they reached his old grotto abode. Bingyan bowed twice and took his leave. The Perfected Lord said: *"You have drunk the marrow of stones and already gained a thousand years among mortals. Do not leak secrets, do not indulge in dissipation. If you can do this, you may yet see me again."*

She commanded a jade maiden to bring Bingyan’s horse, saying: *"Though this is your steed, it is in truth the dragon-child of my grotto. Once, for no reason, it raged and harmed the crops, and so was banished to bear burdens among men. By chance, it departed to join you."*

When the horse reached the place where its saddle had once been removed, its coat was as before—its spirit soared, its frame lean, like the Eight Steeds in form.

The Perfected Lord said: *"When you return to the mortal world, you will have no use for this horse. Simply release it in the Wei Stream, and it shall transform into a dragon, no different from Fei Zhangfang casting his green bamboo staff into Ge Marsh."*

Bingyan leapt in astonishment, bowed his head, and took his leave.

The jade maiden said to Bingyan: *"When the dragon-child returns, have the woman called Tiánpó seal a small gift and send it to me."*

Then, mounting his horse, he flew like the wind. In the time it takes to eat a meal, he had already reached his old estate in Haoxian. The fields lay overgrown, the wells and towns in ruin.

Upon inquiry, he learned that sixty years had passed—it was now the fifth year of Emperor Xuānzōng’s Dàzhōng era. Bingyan’s body had grown pure and empty, his nature both serene and indifferent. With no desires left, what use had he for worldly things? Thus, he made no claim to his former properties, seeking only to fulfill the task of delivering Tiánpó’s sealed gift.

One day, he found Tiánpó and asked after her. She replied, *"The sisters of the Tàiyī household in Zǐxiāo often send letters asking me to buy seals for them."* When pressed further, she fell silent, her lips sealed, refusing to speak.

Bingyan then took the seal, struck it against his horse’s mane, and released the steed by the banks of the Wei. True to the Perfected Lord’s word, it turned north, transformed into a dragon, and vanished into the waters. Later, Bingyan secluded himself in the mountains of Kuānglú, where many claimed to have seen him.

**Mō the Healer**
Mō the Healer—no one knew his origins. He wandered the capital, carrying a small bamboo basket to peddle medicines. When someone fell ill, he would touch them with his hand, and they would invariably recover; thus, people called him *Mō the Healer*. His true name remained unknown. If offered money, he accepted it; if not, he never asked. His hair was tied in twin knots atop his head, his appearance wild. Yet his eyes were clear, his gaze arresting.

One day, caught in the rain, he sought shelter at the home of a tea merchant named Lǐ. The merchant welcomed him, and from then on, Mō would return each night to stay, departing only at dawn. Later, he arrived with another guest, and though the merchant hesitated, he did not refuse them.

In the dead of night, Lǐ rose to check on them through the window and saw a radiant glow. Startled, he peered closer and beheld Mō sitting amidst flames, while the other guest strained against the bed, his shoulder pressed hard against it. Lǐ cried out in alarm, and the fire vanished at once. The room plunged into darkness, leaving only the sound of snoring. The next morning, Lǐ questioned Mō: *"What were you doing last night?"* Both men merely laughed, offering no answer.

After that, Mō departed and was never seen again.

**Lord Wáng the Perfected**
Lord Wáng the Perfected had loved the Daoist arts since youth. He and his wife entered the mountains together, cultivating their practice with single-minded devotion, cutting themselves off from worldly affairs. On the eight seasonal festivals, they would pay homage according to the four directions.

Later, they encountered the Perfected of Tàixū, and both husband and wife bowed before him, entreating him to impart the Way. The Perfected presented Wáng with twenty-five scrolls of plain script—*The Way of the Nine Heavens’ August Immortals and the Supreme Numinous Elixir*—and said: *"You possess the highest affinity and are destined for transcendence. Your immortal name is already fixed; simply reverently guard this Way and never show it to others."* He then bestowed the scriptures upon him.

After seven more years, the Central Yellow of Tàiyī granted him the *Elixir of Numinous Blossoms*. Soon after, a dragon-drawn chariot with a feathered escort descended from the heavens. In broad daylight, he ascended as an immortal, becoming the Perfected of Tàihé. Only after his ascension did he learn, upon paying homage to his teacher, that the one who had bestowed the scriptures was none other than the Perfected of Tàixū—Chìsōngzǐ of Mount Nányuè.

**Liáng Xū the Daoist**
Liáng Xū the Daoist—no one knew his origins. As a Daoist, he had heard that consuming the seeds of the *dìngláng* tree could reverse aging and restore youth, granting the ability to see ghosts clearly at night. Though Xū was already seventy, he took the remedy and grew even younger and stronger. By the time he reached one hundred and forty, he could read by night and run as swiftly as a galloping horse. He later departed for the Green Cloud Mountains.

**Wáng Yuánzhī**
Wáng Yuánzhī was a native of Zhōnglíng.

At the age of ten or so, he went out one night and encountered a Daoist. After conversing with him, Yuánzhī followed the Daoist as they walked beneath the water of the river, bathed in moonlight. No mud or sand was visible, and the water parted with each step. Along the path, he saw a creature like a dragon, or perhaps a serpent, some ten *zhàng* in length, radiating five-colored light. When he asked the Daoist what it was, the reply came: "This is the Water Mother. Those who see her attain longevity."

By dawn, he had returned home. From then on, he delighted in roaming the mountains and seeking out mysteries. He drank wine often but consumed no medicinal elixirs. He would speak of having traversed the immortal sites of the Xiāoshǐ Altar on Mount Hóngyá in the western mountains, the Jade Bamboo of Mount Lú, and the grottoes of Mágū—none were left unexplored.

During his travels, he once met the immortal Cáo Déxiū in Jiāngyòu. Déxiū had been a Grand Scribe of the Western Jìn and later a Minister of the Liáng. He had attained the Dao of deathlessness and sailed the western rivers, coming and going with Yuánzhī. Yuánzhī had once served as a county clerk but was imprisoned. When Déxiū learned of this, he visited Yuánzhī’s family and instructed them to fetch a small amount of water. He then performed an incantation over it and had someone deliver it to Yuánzhī. After drinking it, Yuánzhī’s shackles fell away. He returned home and departed with Déxiū.

For over forty years, they traveled between Jiǔjiāng, Jīnlíng, and Jiāngdū before finally returning. Yuánzhī grew ever younger. Previously, Zhōnglíng had been plagued by mountain demons, but when Yuánzhī approached, they fled, saying to one another, "The Master Wáng is coming." Some saw a thousand soldiers with banners and flags on the road, only to realize it was Yuánzhī passing by. Sometimes he sailed against the wind with his sail hoisted, or drifted upon the water in perfect repose.

In the final years of the Xiàntōng era under Emperor Yìzōng of the Táng, Yuánzhī visited Jade Bamboo Mountain. Pí Yuánxiū, a Daoist of the Cloud and Water, had long been his close friend. One day, at Yùmù Hollow, he suddenly saw Yuánzhī strolling with several Daoist companions. He asked where they were headed.

Yuánzhī replied, "It is Xiāo Zǐyún, Wú Shìyún, Méi Fú, and Dàxiū—several immortals have invited me to ascend Jade Beam Mountain and await Immortal Fàn of Pénglái." No sooner had he spoken than he vanished, clouds and mist swirling thickly as wind shook the forest valleys. Yuánxiū gazed after him in dismay before returning home. (One version writes Yuánzhī’s name with the character *zhī* instead of *zhī*; it is unclear which is correct.)

**The Medicine-Selling Elder**
The Medicine-Selling Elder’s name was unknown; when asked, he would say that was his name. Some who had seen him as children still found his appearance unchanged in their old age. He always carried a large gourd to sell medicines. When people sought remedies for their illnesses, he gave them freely, whether they paid or not, and his medicines were miraculously effective. But if someone without illness asked for medicine in jest, they would inevitably lose it. Thus, people dared not request medicine lightly and revered him as a divine being.

Often drunk in the marketplace, he would give any money he received to the poor. Once, someone teased him, asking, "Do you sell the Great Return Elixir?" He replied, "I have one pill, but it costs a thousand strings of cash." People laughed, thinking him mad. He would often shout in the streets, "You have money but won’t buy medicine—you’ll all end up as dirt dumplings!" No one understood his meaning, and they only laughed.

Later, in Cháng’ān, he shook his gourd, which was now empty, and a single pill emerged, radiating brilliant light. Placing it in his palm, he said to the crowd, "For a hundred years, I’ve sold medicine among you, passing by countless millions, yet not one person was willing to spend money on medicine. How lamentable! Now I must take it myself." He placed the pill in his mouth, and five-colored clouds rose beneath his feet. A wind arose, and he ascended, drifting away.

**Master Yuán Kàng**
Master Yuán Kàng’s origins were unknown. Clad in hempen robes and straw sandals, he wandered the world, always deeply drunk. While traveling through the market of Chángqīng County in Qízhōu, he encountered a wealthy young man named Lǐ, who was oppressed by a local magnate. The Master visited Lǐ’s home daily, extending his hand to say, "Give me a hundred gold pieces for wine." Lǐ never refused, and the Master came every day for a full year without tiring.

One day, the Master took his leave, saying, "I have long imposed upon you. Now I must journey far. If you would host a farewell feast, you will have fulfilled your duty as host—and I will have something to teach you." Lǐ replied, "I was just about to prepare a parting banquet." They went beyond the city outskirts, and as the wine flowed freely, the Master said, "You bear a great grievance. If you are cautious, you may avoid it; otherwise, calamity will strike unpredictably."

Lǐ replied, "If you would instruct me, how dare I not obey?" The Master took up a brush and wrote the character *shèn* (caution) on Lǐ’s palm, saying, "Beware of striking anyone. If you do, the person will die by your hand, and you will only be safe after a month." Lǐ returned home, brooding day and night, too afraid to go out.

Ten days later, he suddenly heard a commotion outside his gate. Forgetting the Master’s warning, he rushed out to see. A lame beggar stood before his granary, hurling foul insults. Enraged, Lǐ struck him, and the beggar fell, his head striking the doorstep. He lay motionless, without breath. Lǐ wept in remorse, saying to his mother, "I did not heed the Master’s teaching, and now disaster has struck! To flee would be unfilial, but to stay means certain execution."

A man of utmost filial piety, he wailed in despair. His mother said, "You must flee to survive—do not wait to be bound." He slipped out through the back door, but as he emerged, he suddenly saw the Master. Weeping, Lǐ bowed and said, "It has barely been a month since we parted, and I have already disregarded your warning. Now, as you foretold, what is to be done?"

The Master replied, "Return home. I will devise a solution for you." He entered a quiet chamber and said to Lǐ, "Go out and submit to arrest. I have a plan." The Master then shut the door, closed his eyes, and sat in meditation. Lǐ stepped outside, where a crowd had gathered like a wall. The officers seized him.

Soon after, the lame man sat up, and after a moment, he walked away swiftly. The officers released Lǐ, allowing him to return home. Entering the chamber, he found the Master still sitting with eyes closed in deep meditation. The next day, the Master opened his eyes and said, "The lame man was indeed dead. I projected my spirit into his body to make him walk. Now I have placed his corpse by a dry ravine on Língyán Mountain, where no one goes."

The Master added, "You are a filial son and deserve a good reward. Your destined lifespan was seventy-four years, but striking the lame man has shortened it by four." The Master then prepared to leave. Lǐ said, "You have given me life anew—all my family’s wealth is insufficient to repay your kindness. What do you desire?"

The Master smiled and said, "I roam with the stars and endure with heaven and earth. What use have I for worldly goods?" And with that, he departed.

*Comprehensive Mirror of Perfected Immortals Who Embodied the Dao, Scroll Thirty-Three*

Chen Xingming
Perfected Immortal Chen Xingming cultivated his practice at Yuanyang Palace on Mount Nanyue. The palace stood northeast of the temple, five *li* up the mountain, forming a tripod-like formation with the Upper Clarity Central Palace. This was during the Taishi era of Emperor Wu of the Jin dynasty.

In his youth, the Perfected One wandered through famous mountains, seeking to visit the abodes of immortals. On the summit of Heavenly Pillar Peak, he encountered two divine beings, both appearing eighteen or nineteen years old. They declared, "We traverse the four seas, guiding those of resolute aspiration. Worldly practitioners of the Dao may briefly attain single-minded devotion, yet halfway abandon their efforts, failing to persevere with diligence. How then could they ascend in bodily form to the heavens, soaring through the celestial thoroughfares? Your accumulated merit is commendable, but you must not retreat. Why fear your name will not be inscribed in the Golden Gates and Jade Halls? The bitterness of the path precedes its joy—for suffering has its limit, while bliss knows no end.

Why is this so? Dwelling in secluded forests and valleys, with birds and beasts as your companions, hunger and thirst inevitably arise. Enduring cold and heat, toiling in hardship, you sever worldly ties, forsake glory, bid farewell to kin, and relinquish love—this is true suffering. Yet to live as long as heaven and earth, to transform without end, to ride the void and mount the empty air, to grow wings at will—this is true joy. How could one not strive with unwavering effort?"

Xingming bowed deeply and replied, "I shall forever bear your sacred words in mind. I will attain the Dao without the slightest negligence."

The divine beings then bestowed upon him the Way of the Luminous Mirror. After eighteen years of cultivation, the two immortals descended once more and declared, "We once imparted to you the supreme Dao, and you have indeed practiced with diligence. Now you ascend to the Nine Heavens, roaming and feasting across the Eight Extremities—a reward for your accumulated merit. The bitterness of the path precedes its joy, and now you have attained it."

On the first day of the third month in the first year of the Taikang era of Emperor Wu of the Jin, mist and rosy clouds enveloped his chamber, while celestial music floated in the air. The villagers below rushed to witness the spectacle, but found only an empty room—even the chickens and dogs had ascended with him.

In the first year of the Chonghe era, Emperor Huizong bestowed upon him the title *Zhixu Shoujing* ("Void-Guarding and Stillness-Abiding") Perfected Immortal.

---

Yin Daoquan
Perfected Immortal Yin Daoquan, surnamed Yin and named Daoquan, was a native of Tianshui. He cultivated the Way of Returning to Spirit through Cavernous Perfection, wearing the talismans of the Five Thearchs and Six Jia, as well as the Left and Right Numinous Flight.

A celestial immortal descended and addressed him, saying, "Those who ascend in flight must possess the requisite capacity before achieving the Dao. In former times, Emperor Wu of Han personally received from the Queen Mother of the West the Twelve Arts of Numinous Flight and the True Forms of the Five Peaks, yet he only attained liberation through the deathless body, unable to make his form and bones ascend together. You have obtained but one of these arts, yet harbor the hope of ascending to heaven—is this not due to the merit accumulated in past lives and the seeds planted by your destiny?"

Daoquan replied, "My learning is shallow and my knowledge limited. I humbly request you reveal the titles of the Twelve Arts."

The celestial immortal recited:
1. The talismans of the Five Thearchs and Six Jia, and the Left and Right Numinous Flight.
2. The scripture of the Great One’s Primal Chaos and Eastern Meng.
3. The Nine Vermilion Spotted Talismans of Bing and Ding Entering Fire.
4. The Register of the Six Ding of Grand Yin, the Way of Permeating Perfection and Concealing the Numinous, and the Jade Maidens.
5. The Book of the Six Wu of Grand Yang, Summoning Perfection and the Celestial Light’s Essence-Strategy.
6. The Oral Instructions of the Six Ji, the Golden Light of Stone Essence, and the Method of Concealing the Radiant Form.
7. The Statutes of the Six Geng for Summoning and Commanding Servitors.
8. The Method of the Six Xin for Attracting the Yellow Water and Moonlight Essence.
9. The Eight Techniques of the Six Ren and Gui for Concealing and Hiding in Earth.
10. The Six Void Dignities of the Eight Endowments of Zi, Wu, Mao, and You, and the Ten Oral Instructions.
11. The Three-Five Sequential Practices of the Earthly Perfection and Plain Oral Instructions of Chou, Chen, Xu, and Wei.
12. The Central Internal Vision of the Purple Degree and Blazing Light of Yin, Si, Shen, and Hai.

The celestial immortal continued:
1. The Mountain Talismans of the Five Peaks, which pacify and guard the sacred mountains, summon the myriad spirits, and are the true scriptures of the Most High.
2. The Mountain Traces of the Five Peaks, where immortals observe the inverted reflections, gazing down upon the mountains and rivers, transcribing their winding contours and the coiled, layered terrain.
3. The Mountain Forms of the Five Peaks, detailing the locations of their peaks and grotto chambers, the habitats of divine mushrooms and numinous herbs, their heights and measurements, and the distances of their eastern, western, southern, and northern boundaries.
4. The Mountain Bones of the Five Peaks, depicting their skeletal structures and branching divisions, modeled above on the stellar patterns and governing below the origins of human affairs.
5. The Charts of the Water Caves and Passages of the Five Peaks, mapping the sources of their springs, the locations of their hidden gold and treasures, and the networks of their earthly veins.

Each talisman and chart commands tens of thousands of officials, soldiers, and subordinates. The Five Peaks alone govern three great mountains and one hundred sixty lesser ones, along with one thousand two hundred minor mountains. Together with the bureaus and offices of the immortals, their numbers are vast indeed.

Though Emperor Wu of Han obtained these methods, he failed to uphold their precepts, exhausting his military might and indulging in warfare, thereby destroying his own fortune. Thus, he could not achieve the same merit as the Yellow Thearch. Now that you have encountered them, it is clear you descend from the lineage of Wen Shi and belong to the clan of Great Harmony—a family that has produced such individuals across generations. I shall await you above the Nine Purities, within the Great Void."

With these words, the celestial immortal departed.

The Perfected One, on the ninth day of the third month in the first year of Emperor Huaidi of Jin’s Yuankang reign, saw a white cloud arise within his chamber, lingering for three days without dissipating. When it finally dispersed, the Perfected One had vanished, leaving only a lingering fragrance that filled the room. In the first year of Emperor Huizong of Song’s Chonghe reign, he was bestowed the title *Tongzhen Guan Miaozhen Ren* (Perfected One of Wondrous Reality at the Abbey of Communion with the Real).

Prefect of Tanzhou Zhang Maozong inscribed a poem at the Hengyue Abbey, which reads:
*Before the sacred peaks of the numinous mountain, I wander the ancient abbey—*
*How does this place differ from the jeweled palaces of alchemy?*
*Five-cloud immortals, each with forms most strange,*
*Ten-grotto mists and blossoms, their scenes unlike the heart’s design.*
*By the elixir furnace, golden and mineral qi rises in fragrant coils;*
*At the star-summoning altar, the wind sighs through creeping fig and pine.*
*Having heard the great Dao’s secrets of perfected cultivation,*
*Are the Three Clarities’ realms truly so near, yet so far?*

The Abbey of the Grotto Gate at Hengyue, where Shi Cun dwelled, lies west of Stone Mill Peak and south of Pomegranate Peak, twenty *li* from the temple below. The Perfected One Shi, whose given name was Cun and who styled himself Master Hufu (or "Wanpenzi"), studied under Huang Luzi and mastered the *Inner Writings of the Three Sovereigns*. He commanded the guardianship of tigers and leopards, mastered the arts of concealment and transformation, and the methods of shifting through light and shadow. For centuries, he appeared and vanished at will. Admiring the austere purity of the Grotto Gate, he deemed it a place of vital resonance with the Real and took up residence there. On the western peak, he constructed a pavilion within a stone chamber, which one day stood empty for over ten *zhang*. He would ride a white leopard or return to the mountain on foot, the leopard always coming to greet him. Immortals of the seas and mountains would gather there from time to time. Though the villagers revered and longed for him, few were granted an audience. On the seventh day of the fourth month in the first year of Emperor Huidi of Jin’s Yongkang reign, he ascended to heaven riding his leopard. In the first year of Emperor Huizong of Song’s Chonghe reign, he was bestowed the title *Chonghe Jiansu Zhenren* (Perfected One of Harmonious Simplicity and Unadorned Reality).

There was also Li Changli of Shu, who dwelled in seclusion for years before wandering to the Heavenly Treasure Grotto. Today, only the remnants of the Leopard-Taming Crag remain. The *Zhen’gao* states: "Shi Cun was a man of Qi who styled himself Wanpenzi. Having attained the Dao of transformation and shifting through light, he now resides on Central Peak or at Shaoshi." It is said that the famed Master Hu of old was none other than he.

Yet he had not received the scriptures of the Most High, and thus had not attained perfection as a Perfected One. He wielded the jade axe and military fire talismans—these were but branches of what he had received.

Shi Cun was counted among the three thousand disciples of Confucius.

**Master Liaoran**
Master Liaoran was a man of Liaodong whose given name and surname remain unknown. After wandering through the twenty-four sacred sites of western Shu, he later dwelled on Mount Taibai. Tigers and leopards, tamed, would circle him as he came and went, though none knew what arts he cultivated. Later, he journeyed through the Three Chu regions, living for over a hundred years. Those with whom he shared close bonds included Wu Meng, Lu Xiujing, Guo Pu, Xie Lingyun, and the monk Huiyuan, who followed one after another. Yu Liang once took him as his teacher and asked: "Master, in your view, can these worthies escape this turbid world?" He replied: "Their merits vary in depth, but the Dao is of one essence. Though each has found their own path, none have attained perfect clarity." Yu Liang then asked: "And what of the Master?" He answered: "Leave this month, and I shall speak further to you." Before the month had passed, Yu Liang died.

Later, the Master traveled from the Western Mountains to visit South Peak, where he paid homage at the Green Jade and White Jade altars. Seeking the cave entrance ahead, he visited Master Li Changli, and they drank deeply for several days. When Li then departed for the mountains of Shu, the Master returned to seclude himself in the front cave. The Song monk Zong Bing once sought him there but did not encounter him.

**Deng Yuzhi**
Deng Yuzhi, styled Yanda, lived in reclusion at the Terrace of Flowers on South Peak. By night he recited the *Great Cavern Scripture*, and in response, the Lady Wei descended to address him, saying: "You possess the destiny of an immortal; I have come especially to visit you." One day, he suddenly saw three azure crows, large as cranes, dancing and calling as they flew—only after some time did they depart. Yuzhi then said to his disciples: "The azure crows have come; the appointed time has arrived." Soon after, he shed his mortal form.

Xu Lingqi

**Xu the Perfected One**
Xu the Perfected One, named Lingqi, was a native of Wu. He dwelt in reclusion at the Upper Clarity Palace on Mount Heng, cultivating the Dao. The palace lay seven *li* northeast of the temple. In his youth, a divine being imparted to him the essentials of the Mysterious Elixir, the method of absorbing the sun’s radiance, and the Way of guarding the Mud-Pill Palace. He subsisted on sesame rice, and thus was able to wander the seas and mountains, journeying to and from the Southern Mountains for many years. He explored the mountain’s grottoes and valleys, composing the *Record of Mount Heng*, which recounts the numinous wonders of its grotto-palaces.

He wrote that the Purple Canopy and Cloudy Screen Peaks each rose over five thousand *zhang* in height, and that on Cloudy Screen stood a stele from Yu the Great’s flood-control efforts, inscribed in tadpole script. Below the stele lay a stone altar, encircled by flowing water, a most sublime site. On Purple Canopy, cranes often gathered at its summit, where divine mushrooms and numinous herbs grew. Below stood a stone chamber, within which were a censer, pestle, mortar, and cinnabar tortoise.

Atop the Peak of Zhurong stood a jade altar, five *chi* square. To its east grew a purple pear tree, three hundred *chi* tall, planted by Yu of Xia. Its fruit was as large as a *dou*, red as the sun; those who ate it would attain immortality and never die. During the Yixi era of Emperor An of Jin, the mountain-dweller Pan Jue reached the western side of the peak. A rock split open, and a substance emerged, like purple clay, fragrant and soft, edible. Jue, not recognizing it as stone marrow, ultimately did not eat it and cast it aside. When he suddenly realized and returned, it was already gone. These were the sacred marvels he recorded.

He could also command spirits and gods, subdue dragons and tigers. On the ninth day of the ninth month in the first year of Yuanwei of King Cangwu of Song, he ascended as a perfected being. In the seventh year of Dali during the reign of Emperor Daizong of Tang, the Master of Mystic Harmony, Zhang Dakong—teacher of Li Bi—resided there and attained the Dao, later achieving liberation through the corpse at Yuanyang Palace. In the first year of Dazhong, Han Weiyi, admiring his example, dwelt there in cultivation and likewise attained the Dao. In the first year of Chonghe, Emperor Huizong of Song bestowed upon him the title *Mingzhen Dongwei Perfected One*. The foundations of the palace remain today.

A stone stele records that in former times, an immortal parrot announced the dawn, having eaten the immortal herb and become deathless. Occasionally, woodcutters glimpsed it but could not capture it.

**Deng Yuzhi of the Nine Immortals Palace on Purple Canopy Peak**
Deng Yuzhi, styled Yuanda, was a native of Xinye in Nanyang. In his youth, he dreamed of a flying crow bearing an official seal. Later, he obtained a talisman for expelling evil and dispelling poisons, and all whom he treated were cured. He formed a bond of transcendents’ friendship with Xu Lingqi, wandering famous mountains and seeking out perfected beings.

Having encountered a perfected being, he was transmitted the arts of the golden crucible and fire talismans. In the second year of Yuanhui under Song Emperor Cangwu, after Xu had ascended, Deng Yuzhi concealed himself in the cavern gate. After a long while, he wandered beyond the lakes, traversing every grotto-heaven and blessed land. Unable to procure the ingredients for his elixir, he gathered herbs and lodged for the night in a stone grotto. In a dream, a divine personage said to him: "You have merit and shall soon be summoned. You ought to emerge at the appointed time, for the host of immortals awaits you." Awakening, he was startled and overjoyed.

In the early years of Tianjian under the Liang, the imperial court memorialized that the Lesser Yang star had appeared in the Changsha region of southern Chu. Emperor Wu dispatched an inspector to seek him out. When asked of his practices, he replied: "This poor Daoist refines the golden liquor but lacks the ingredients for the elixir." The emperor bestowed gold and silk and permitted him to select a secluded and propitious site in the Grotto of Perfection and Blessed Land of Mount Nanyue, establishing upper, middle, and lower abbeys to cultivate both inner and outer elixirs.

One evening, a divine personage addressed him, saying: "The neighbor of the Great Grotto is the land that summons blessings, the hamlet that extends life. Mark this well and do not forget." Later, when his elixir was complete, he again moved to the eastern slopes of Purple Canopy Peak. On the thirtieth day of the twelfth month in the final year of Tianjian, eight perfected ones descended into his chamber in feathered canopies and cloud chariots—the same eight perfected beings who had previously attained the Dao. Thereupon, he ascended to heaven from the natural stone altar.

In the first year of Chonghe, Emperor Huizong of Song bestowed upon him the title *Chaozhen Jimiao Perfected One*. Zhang Guan, prefect of Hengzhou, submitted a memorial to establish an abbey plaque.

**Chen Xidu**
Chen the Perfected One, whose personal name was Huidu, was a native of Yingchuan.

Initially, he resided on Mount Mao, where he gathered rare and wondrous herbs to sell, drinking wine without taking food. After but a few years, he journeyed south. The two peaks he carried were filled with minerals and stones. Upon reaching Mount Heng, he chose a secluded and scenic spot to dwell at Jade Purity Abbey. South of Stone Gruel Peak, twenty-five *li* from the temple up the mountain, he made a covenant with Heaven and swore to refine the elixir. Deep in the night, he was harassed by ghosts, who thrice pounded his alchemical furnace and hurled stones to crush him. Yet he sat cross-legged upon a rock in deep meditation, reciting the *Huangting Jing*, wearing the *Yuelan Wuyue Zhenxing Tu*. His resolve grew ever more steadfast; in secret, resonance was achieved, and the power of the Dao lent its support. He captured the mountain spirits and demons, and the malevolent qi gradually dispersed. The ghosts, trembling and wailing in terror, were made by the Perfected One to shoulder stones and swear oaths to spare their lives, whereupon they were banished far beyond the borders. Later, when his elixir was complete, radiant qi filled the mountain, illuminating all near and far. After consuming it, on the thirteenth day of the fifth month in the third year of Yongming under Emperor Wu of Qi, he ascended to heaven.

The Tang poet Zhang Jiuling’s *Poem on the Elixir Terrace* reads:
*"West of Parrot’s Head, the side gate opens wide—*
*Chen’s elixir soars to the Terrace of Kalpas past.*
*Do the oaths sworn to demons in years gone by still hold?*
*Even now, they speak of the ghosts made to bear the stones."*

In the first year of Chonghe, Emperor Huizong of Song bestowed upon him the title *Chongxu Yuanmiao Perfected One*. Today, atop the abbey’s foundation, one may still find the Elixir Terrace, the Ghost-Bearing Stones, the Thunder Pool and Wind Cavern, the Scripture-Recitation Altar, and the Elixir-Bathing Spring. In later times, a monk established a temple called Brightness upon the abbey’s foundation, though it was soon abandoned. During the Qiandao era of Emperor Xiaozong, the Daoist Deng Shiyong and the lay practitioner Huang Shouzhen opened the mountain, felled trees, and cleared the undergrowth. They appealed to the worthy and virtuous, newly constructing halls and pavilions.

Rain prayers and disaster averting rites alike proved responsive, their efficacy manifest. Rustic dwellers in mountain huts deeply embraced the Dao’s transforming influence.

**Zhang Tanyao**
The Zhaoxian Abbey of Hengyang lies eight *li* east of the temple. Old records state its foundation was laid by Liu Zong, its site divined during the Xiao Qi dynasty. Another account dates its establishment to the reign of Emperor Wu of Jin, during the Xianning era. Formerly, the Perfected Zhang, whose name was Tanyao, dwelt here. Moved by his devotion, the Heavenly Perfected secretly descended, transmitting the Way of Internal Nourishment of Primordial Harmony and the Silent Audience before the Great Emperor. After twelve years of practice, his spirit ascended the Great Void, where he was received in audience by the August Emperor of the Supreme Ultimate. Bestowed with jade treasures, langgan elixir, and the fluid of merged spirit and radiance, he consumed them, undergoing transformations beyond measure, his divine powers boundless. On the third day of the seventh month in the first year of Yanxing under Emperor Fei of Qi, a sudden thunderous roar shook heaven and earth. In an instant, phoenixes and cranes bore a vermilion edict, bearing him aloft to ascend as an immortal. In the first year of Chonghe, Emperor Huizong of Song granted him the title *Baoguang Ximing Perfected One*.

**Zhang Ruzhen**
The Jiuzhen Abbey of Mount Heng lies ten *li* east of the temple. Old records state it was built by the Master of Xinye during the Taikang era of Jin. In the early years of the Tianjian era under Emperor Wu of Liang, the Perfected Zhang Ruzhen resided there. Zhang was a fellow villager and neighbor of the Master. From childhood, he spoke little, his temperament aloof and untouched by worldly concerns. In his prime, he dwelt in seclusion, his innate spiritual bone drawing the descent of a divine being to his thatched chamber, who transmitted the Way of the Luminous Mirror and Penetrating Insight. The divine being said: "That which illumines the principles of things is Heaven; that which reflects their forms is the Dao. Heaven’s Way is pure; the mirror’s Way is bright. Scrutinized without error, form is fixed here, while things respond there. Thus, the shapes of rivers and mountains, the dispositions of ghosts and spirits—none can escape or conceal themselves. Heaven, in its clarity, embraces the myriad things; the mirror, in its brightness, reflects all forms. If one cultivates the clarity of Heaven and the brightness of the mirror, calming the heart and settling the spirit to achieve inner and outer transparency, then the supreme Dao is attained. But if one is externally enslaved by things and internally wearied by the spirit, the spirit and heart grow turbid and cannot be stilled—then one strays far from the Dao. This method I once received from Master Changsang, who received it from the Heavenly Emperor of the Great Tenuity. Those who obtain it gain penetrating insight and far-reaching vision, illuminating the eight directions. Within the methods of the *Dongzhen*, there is the Way of the Four Regulations, practiced in accord with the four seasons, which is of the same essence as this. The ancients spoke truly: 'Empty the chamber, and whiteness arises of itself; settle the heart, and the Dao comes of itself.'"

Ruzhen practiced this for nine years, his vision penetrating a thousand *li*, nothing able to remain hidden. On the eighteenth day of the eleventh month in the thirteenth year of Tianjian under Emperor Wu of Liang, he wandered alone into the mountains and did not return for three days. His disciples searched for him and saw Ruzhen then clad in immortal robes, riding a cloud chariot, accompanied by flutes and drums, ascending into the heavens in ethereal splendor. In the first year of Chonghe, Emperor Huizong of Song granted him the title *Quanzhen Dadao Perfected One*.

**Liao Zhong**
Liao Chong, styled Qingxu, resided in Lianshan Prefecture during the third year of Datong under Emperor Wu of Liang. Renowned for his talent and virtue, he served as the chief clerk of his home prefecture. Later, he resigned his seals and ribbons, roaming in search of the essentials of the Dao. He dwelt on Mount Songgao for a time, then passed through Jingzhou and Gong’an, where two spirits stirred up mischief, conjuring winds and waves to obstruct his boat.

Having subdued and expelled them, he commanded the two spirits to guard the boat and ferry him across. Upon reaching Mount Nanyue, he encountered the Supreme Peace Perfected Lord atop Zhurong Peak, who transmitted to him the essentials of the Dao. He then addressed the two spirits: "I shall dwell in Bangyang to refine the elixir. You may guard my furnace, and when the elixir is complete, you too shall have a share." The elixir was duly perfected, and he returned to his hometown. He would often ride a tiger, wielding a serpent as his whip. Having lived over a hundred years, in the second year of *Xiantian* under Emperor Ruizong of Tang, he ascended amid darkening winds and clouds.

**You Daorong**
You Daorong of the Northern Qi was taciturn from childhood, disinclined toward literature, and fond of solitude. While roaming Mount Nanyue, he met the Red Lord, who taught him the arts of talismanic water, prohibitive incantations, and the reckoning of celestial portents—all of which he mastered in full. Another account states that in his youth, he became a Daoist and, hearing of a man in Jinyang renowned for his mastery of esoteric arts, sought him out. That man, well-versed in Daoist talismans, prohibitive incantations, yin-yang calculations, celestial patterns, and the properties of medicinal herbs, transmitted all his knowledge to Daorong. After more than a year, he said: "I am originally an immortal of Mount Heng, but for a minor transgression, I was demoted by the celestial bureaucracy. Now my term is complete, and I shall return home. Escort me to the Fen River." Upon arrival, the river had surged violently, and the bridge was destroyed. The man then performed the *Yu step* by the water’s edge, casting a talisman into the current, which instantly parted. Moments later, the waters rose, yet the two crossed unhurriedly over the sand. Daorong was later summoned by Emperor Wenxuan to the Liaoyang Mountains of Jinyang. In the dead of night, his horse startled, and a fierce beast appeared mere paces away. Daorong calmly drew his staff across the ground, forming a fiery pit, and the beast fled in haste.

**Jia Ziran**
Jia Ziran cultivated himself through fasting and meditation at the Supreme Peace Abbey on Mount Heng, where he encountered the Nanyue Perfected Lord Chen Shaowei, who had descended from Ziming. The Perfected Lord said: "I am aware of your cultivation. When a lofty immortal is destined to appear, the mysteries must be transmitted." Later, the Venerable Master of Qingcheng descended to his chamber and bestowed upon him the secret of the *Nine-One Flying Immortal*, enabling his ascension in broad daylight.

**Xiao Linghu**
Xiao Linghu, styled Tianyou, was a native of Luling. At seven, he could compose poetry, all his verses imbued with otherworldly intent. At fifteen, he developed a passion for the Dao, and in his prime, he met a perfected being who transmitted to him the arts of the *Golden Liquor Elixir* and *Embryonic Breathing*. He traversed renowned mountains, carrying over a hundred scrolls of Daoist scriptures. He often said: "To ascend to the Southern Palace, one must first cross the Vermilion Mound." While visiting Dongyang, he passed by Mount Lu and gazed upon the image of Perfected Lord Deng, remarking: "This mountain is one of the blessed lands of the Vermilion Mound." That night, the Perfected Lord appeared to him and transmitted the art of the *Fire Cauldron*. In the second year of *Zhenguan* under Emperor Taizong of Tang, he sailed the Xiang and Xiao Rivers, personally performing rituals to invoke life and expel evil, bringing immeasurable relief to the local populace. Later, he resided at Zhao Xian Abbey, refining the *Fire Cauldron* technique, transmuting base metals into gold and silver for alms, and renovating the abbey’s halls, restoring them to pristine condition. A certain marquis or prince revered him, inviting him to serve as the master of rites, and all deferred to him. In the fifth year, he established the Pavilion for Seeking the Perfected. In the sixth year, the year *Renchen*, he cast a bronze bell weighing five hundred *jin* in Guizhou. Upon returning to the abbey, he refrained from striking it for five watches, lest he disturb the earth spirits. Later, he selected a secluded and scenic site to the north of the mountain to refine the divine elixir. After three altars, the elixir was finally perfected. Having consumed it, in the second year of *Hongdao* under Emperor Gaozong, on the Mid-Autumn Festival, he addressed his disciples: "My time of departure has come; I must go and cannot tarry. You must diligently cultivate, for there will be those who succeed me." Thereupon, he underwent *shi jie*, his chamber filled with fragrant vapors, and faint celestial strains seemed to linger beyond the door for some time before fading. In the final years of *Duan’gong* under Emperor Taizong of Song, at the fifth watch one day, the abbey’s bell suddenly tolled. The assembly was astonished and rose to investigate, only to find the bell cracked. Within ten days, a Daoist appeared, melting copper in his palm and mending the fissure, the crimson glow dimming of its own accord. The onlookers were filled with awe. The Daoist then entered the stream to wash his hands and vanished without a trace. To this day, the bell bears the marks of those who touch it, a testament to its numinous wonder.

**Zhang Huiming**
Zhang Huiming was a native of Zhaojun.

Zhang Huiming built his hut upon Mount Zhongtiao and received the teachings at Yuanzhen Abbey. He regularly practiced incantations and exorcisms, driving away malevolent spirits. Later, he journeyed to Chang’an, where he encountered Master Hunyuan and was initiated into the Dao of *Gaoben*. Through its practice, his merits flourished and his virtue perfected, his Daoist learning surpassing all others. Those who gathered at his seat were all disciples of the highest order. Emperor Taizong of Tang summoned him to the inner palace, where he conducted a grand offering that moved the spirits. Later, he petitioned to return to the mountains and forests, and the emperor permitted him to reside at Mount Nanyue, bestowing upon him the title *Master of Wondrous Salvation*. One evening, he unexpectedly encountered the Lady Youying of the Southern Peak, who transmitted to him the essentials of *embracing oneness and guarding the true*, and the *unity of the Three and Five*. After practicing these for twelve years, he was again summoned to the western capital to attend to imperial inquiries. Once more, he underwent *shi jie*.

**Li Simu**
Li Simu was a native of Chengji. He formed bonds of mist and clouds with Dong the Alchemist and Master Bai. Together, they wandered the famous mountains of the Three Xiang regions before visiting the Five Peaks of Mount Nanyue. Though their masters and teachings differed, each had his own path to enlightenment. After Master Bai ascended from Stone Drum Peak, Li Simu entered the capital, where Gao Lishi, resentful of Wu Yun, recommended him to Emperor Xuanzong. His answers to the emperor’s questions were well-received, and later, he petitioned to return to the mountains. The emperor bestowed upon him generous gifts for his journey. He annotated the *Classic of Purity and Stillness*, which circulated in the world. Later, he achieved profound transformation upon Purple Canopy Peak. Only Dong remained at the rear cavern of Mount Heng in Hengyang, where he often used incantations to heal the sick. Those who offered him recompense found that only wine—enough to intoxicate—sufficed. Thus, he was never sober; his drunken traces marked roads and streams, yet when rain fell, his robes remained dry, and in the biting frost, his hair gleamed white. After several years, he went door to door, telling people, "Take good care of yourselves." The people were astonished, and soon after, he underwent *shi jie* behind the cavern, as if shedding an old husk. The Tang poet Du Fu, in his poem *Recalling the Past*, wrote in its closing lines: *"Then I sought Dong the Alchemist of Hengyang— / Southward journey, early drums trailing along the Xiao and Xiang."*

**Shen Taizhi**
Shen Taizhi, styled Guangxiang, was originally from Luoyang. His ancestors, having served as officials in the southern lakes, settled in Changsha for generations before dispersing and wandering the four directions. Admired near and far, Taizhi chose to reside by Willow Pond in Renfeng Village of Shaozhou. For generations, his family cultivated kindness and benevolence. From childhood, he kept to himself, avoiding even relatives and friends. Fond of reading, he lived with constant frugality and purity.

He wandered and rested upon Mount Nanyue, inquiring into the affairs of divine transcendents. One evening atop Zhurong Peak, he encountered a Perfected One, who transmitted to him the defense of the Golden Elixir and Fire Dragon. Returning, he refined the elixir upon the northern summit of Yunshan, where the clouds gather, for many years. When the Great Medicine was complete and his merit and practice both perfected, he could ride the void and spirit-travel, appearing and vanishing at will, endowed with numinous marvels beyond mortal comprehension.

In the twenty-sixth year of the Kaiyuan era of the Tang, the year *wuyin* (738), on the sixteenth day of the eighth month, Emperor Minghuang addressed his close ministers: "Last night, on the Mid-Autumn, I dreamed that a divine personage told me: 'In Yunshan of Shaozhou in Hunan, there is a Daoist refining the elixir who has attained transcendence. If you honor and receive him, he may serve as the state preceptor.'"

**Master Zhang Taikong**
Master Zhang, whose surname was Zhang and given name Taikong, secluded himself in the Upper Clarity Palace on Mount Heng, cultivating practice to attain the Dao. In the seventh year of the Dali era of Emperor Daizong of the Tang (772), he became the teacher of the Tang minister Li Bi. Later, he secluded himself in the Yuanyang Palace, and on the thirteenth day of the sixth month of the fourth year of the Zhenyuan era of Emperor Dezong (788), he underwent *shi jie* upon Lingyin Peak. The imperial composition read:

*"The supreme Dao is nameless; we provisionally bestow a name to honor the Dao. The supreme Perfected is without designation; we must seek a title to clarify the Perfected. Only that which may be named resides in the perfection of virtue. Thus, the Daoist Zhang Taikong of the Yuanyang Palace on Mount Nanyue, nurtured by the Primordial Chaos, delved into the profound mystery beyond mystery. He refined his bones in the Three Clarities and preserved his spirit in the Eight Effulgences. Cultivating virtue upon the peaks of Heng, he neared a century in years. Relying on the formless to seek the hidden, he wielded the primordial chaos with effortless mastery. His vital force was vast as the ancient void, his true form that of primordial antiquity. Recently, under the former emperor, he expounded the wondrous subtleties of the Dao. Gazing upon the chariot of the dark crane, he was bestowed with robes of purple mist. I have a minister of aid, whose lofty words and footsteps I revere; ever do I cherish this transcendent, regretting that we did not live in the same age. To express my admiration, I now confer this illustrious command. Let his name be recorded and his virtue proclaimed, that it may endure without end. He is to be posthumously honored as Master Xuanhe."*

The palace underwent renovations during the Chunhua, Tiansheng, and Zhenghe eras of the Song. In the first year of the Xuanhe era (1119), Emperor Huizong renamed it Chongming Abbey. Three *li* beyond it lies Fuhu (Crouching Tiger) Crag.

**Liu Shi**
During the Yuanhe era of Emperor Xianzong of the Tang, there were two men, Liu Shi and Yuan Che, who resided upon Mount Heng. Both had uncles who served as officials in the eastern regions of Zhe, but due to the entanglements of commoners in legal troubles, each was exiled to the remote prefectures of Guan and Ai. The two gentlemen, bound by filial duty, journeyed to visit them. Arriving at Baipu County in Lianzhou, they boarded a boat to cross the sea. As they neared Jiaozhi, their vessel moored at Hepu’s shore.

That night, villagers were offering a feast to the gods, with flutes and drums clamoring. The boatmen and the two gentlemen’s servants all went to watch. As the night deepened toward midnight, a sudden gale arose, snapping the mooring ropes. The boat drifted into the vast sea, directionless. Soon, it reached a solitary island where the wind stilled. The two gentlemen, disheartened, disembarked. They saw an image of the Jade Heavenly Worthy, resplendent upon an altar, with a golden incense burner but nothing else.

As they surveyed the surroundings, they suddenly beheld a colossal beast emerging from the eastern sea. It turned its head in all directions, as if listening intently, then after a long while, departed. Hesitantly, a purple cloud surged from the sea, spreading for several hundred paces. A five-colored lotus leaf, over a hundred *chi* tall, unfolded petal by petal. Within, a canopy shimmered, woven of brocade and embroidery, dazzling the eyes. A rainbow bridge suddenly extended, reaching directly to the island.

Presently, two maidens with twin buns appeared, as if bearing a jade casket and holding a golden censer shaped like a lotus, approaching the Heavenly Worthy’s altar. They replaced the spent incense with exotic fragrances. Seeing the maidens, the two gentlemen kowtowed repeatedly, their pleas mournful and bitter, beseeching a return to the mortal world. The maidens did not respond. After the two men entreated for a long while, one of them asked: "Who are you, and how have you come here?" The two men recounted their circumstances.

The maiden said, "Shortly, the Venerable Master of Jade Void will descend upon this island to meet with the Lady of Southern Qi. If you persist in your entreaties, your wishes may yet be fulfilled." As her words ended, a Daoist riding a white deer and wielding colored clouds descended straight onto the island. The two men bowed and wept as they recounted their plight. The Venerable Master, moved by their pleas, said, "Follow this maiden to pay homage to the Lady of Southern Qi, and your return shall be granted. Have no fear." Turning to the maiden, the Master instructed, "Attend briefly to your cultivation, then guide these two men to receive her teachings."

Before the canopy, they performed the rites of obeisance. There they beheld a woman of unmatched beauty, clad in robes of five-colored patterns. The two men announced their names, and the Lady smiled, saying, "Long ago on Tiantai Mountain there was Liu Chen, and now there is Liu Shi; once there was Ruan Zhao, and now there is Yuan Che—surely this is fate." She prepared two couches for them to sit.

Presently, the Venerable Master arrived, and the Lady rose to greet him before resuming her seat. Several fairy maidens played flutes, pipes, and sheng, while phoenixes and simurghs danced beside them, their movements in perfect harmony. The two men felt as though lost in a dream, for such sights were rare even in the mortal world. Then, the Lady ordered wine to be served.

Suddenly, a black crane descended from the sky, bearing a brocade scroll in its beak. It announced, "Master Anqi, knowing the Venerable Master attends the Southern Assembly, humbly requests your presence." The Venerable Master read the message and said to the crane, "I shall go there shortly." Turning to the Lady, he remarked, "Master Anqi and I have not met in a thousand years. Though he has not journeyed south, there is no chance to converse." The Lady then urged her maidens to serve refreshments. The vessels were of luminous jade, and she dined with the Venerable Master, while the two men were not permitted to partake.

The Venerable Master said, "These two guests are not yet fit to share this repast, but let them be given food for mortals." The Lady assented and had common fare served to them. After the Master finished eating, he drew from his robe a scroll of cinnabar talismans and presented it to the Lady, who received it with reverence. Then he took his leave, saying to the two men, "You possess the bones of Dao. Your return will not be difficult. Yet this chance encounter means you are destined to receive an elixir. However, your destined master is another—I am not fit to be your teacher." The two men bowed, and the Venerable Master departed.

The Lady commanded her maidens, "Escort these two guests away." She asked, "By what means shall they travel?" A maiden replied, "The Hundred-Flower Bridge will serve." The two men expressed their gratitude and took their leave. The Lady gifted them a jade flask, over a *chi* in height, and inscribed upon it a poem with her brush:

*You came by a single-leaf skiff,*
*You depart upon the Hundred-Flower Bridge.*
*Should you knock the jade flask in the mortal world,*
*The mandarin ducks will speak plainly to you.*

Soon, a bridge spanning several hundred paces appeared, its railings adorned with rare blossoms. The two men peered between the flowers and saw thousands of dragons and rainbows intertwined as pillars and stones. A messenger addressed them, "I ought not to be your guide, but I bear a weighty request and am compelled to this task." From his sash, he produced a small box, within which something stirred faintly, resembling a spider. He said, "We are water immortals, beings of yin, and thus have no men among us. Long ago, I encountered a youth from Panyu, and our deep affection bore a child. Before he turned three, we were forced to abandon him. The Lady commanded that he be given to the God of Southern Marchmount as a son, and he has been there for some time. Recently, the God of Southern Marchmount returned to Crow Peak, and as I had business in the water palace, I entrusted my son to a messenger upon his return. The messenger took the jade ring my son was playing with and vanished—I hold this a great grievance. I ask you, noble sirs, to carry this box to the foot of Crow Peak, seek out the messenger’s shrine, and cast it there. There will be a wondrous transformation. If you recover the jade ring, deliver it to my son, and he will surely reward you. Do not open the box." The two men accepted it, and one asked, "The Lady’s poem says, *Should you knock the jade flask in the mortal world, the mandarin ducks will speak plainly to you.* What does this mean?" The messenger replied, "When you return, should you have need, knock the flask, and a bird will answer. Your wishes will be granted." The other asked, "The Venerable Master said we each have our own master. Who might that be?" The messenger answered, "The Supreme Master of Southern Marchmount. You will meet him in time." Then they parted from the messenger.

As the bridge ended, they reached the place where they had moored their boat in Hepu. Looking back, the bridge was gone. When they inquired about the era, they found that ten years had passed. They hastened to their home provinces, only to find their kin long deceased. Overcome with sorrow, they resolved to return to Mount Heng. Along the way, they knocked the jade flask, and a pair of mandarin ducks spoke, "Eat and drink, and you will encounter what you seek ahead." Soon, by the roadside, platters of food and wine appeared, and the two men ate their fill. After several days’ journey, they reached home, where the children of their youth had grown to adulthood. Yet they learned that each had died three days prior, and their families were torn between grief and joy. People said, "The young masters perished at sea, and their mourning periods have long since ended." The two men seemed weary of the world, their bodies light and ethereal. Seeing their wives’ funerals, they felt little sorrow.

Together, they traveled to the foot of Crow Peak and sought the messenger’s shrine, casting the box into it. Suddenly, a black dragon dozens of *zhang* long stirred the winds and spat hail, snapping trees and uprooting houses. With a thunderous crack, the shrine shattered. Trembling, the two men dared not look closely. From the air, a jade ring was tossed down, which they retrieved and delivered to the shrine of Southern Marchmount.

Upon their return, a youth in yellow robes arrived at each of their homes, bearing two golden boxes. He said, "The masters’ elixir is *Returning Soul Ointment*. Should any in your families have died, even if a full cycle of sixty years has passed, anoint their crowns, and they will revive." Then the youth vanished. The two men used the ointment to revive their wives. Later, they wandered together in search of the Supreme Master, but no trace of him was found.

Amidst the snow, they saw an old woodcutter selling firewood. Moved by his age and the cold, the two men gave him wine to drink. Noticing the characters "Tai Ji" carved on the eaves above his firewood, they found it strange and bowed to him as their teacher. They presented the jade flask to him, and the old man said, "This flask is where I store my jade liquid." Overjoyed, he then led the two men up Mount Zhurong, and they never emerged again.

**Chen Faming**
The Dongyang Palace of Mount Heng stands northwest of Shileng Peak, where the True Man Shi subdued demons in assembly. When Chen Faming returned in response to the imperial summons during the Tang, he opened a cave and built an altar at the foot of this peak, aided in secret by mountain dwellers. Gazing south toward Yunyang, he paid homage to the Dao each morning and evening, reciting the *Great Cavern Scripture*. Later, he ingested the elixir and transcended through the mysterious. Today, the old foundations remain, along with a few monastic halls.

**Wang the Eighteenth**

When the Tang dynasty’s Grand Councilor, Lord Liu Yan, was young, he was fond of Daoist arts and practiced them diligently without wearying, yet he never encountered a master. He had heard that extraordinary persons often frequented market stalls, for the bustle and commotion allowed them to blend in unnoticed. While traveling in Chang’an, he came to an apothecary shop where he overheard someone say: “There are usually three or four old men—wearing gauze hats and leaning on staffs—who come to drink wine. Once they finish, they leave. They also ask to see the herbs but never buy much. I suspect they are no ordinary folk.” Lord Liu asked, “Do they come at a fixed time?” The man replied, “They should arrive tomorrow.” At dawn the next day, Liu went to wait for them. Soon enough, three Daoist adepts arrived. They drank their fill, conversing and jesting with great delight, as if no one else were present. After a long while, one asked, “Are there any in the world like us?” Another answered, “Wang the Eighteenth.” Then they departed. From that day on, Liu remembered the name but could never find him.

Later, when Liu served as prefect, he passed through Hengshan County in the southern regions. It was early spring, the weather mild and warm. He was served a plate of chilled noodles with fragrant herbs—artemisia and the like—remarkably fresh and pure. Struck by this, Liu asked the postal clerk, “Is there anyone of refined bearing nearby? Where did these vegetables come from?” The clerk replied, “The county has an official garden. Wang the Eighteenth tends it, so the kitchen always has fine greens.” Liu suddenly recalled the Daoists’ words. He asked, “Is the garden far?” The clerk said, “It’s right behind the guesthouse.” Liu went to inquire and saw Wang the Eighteenth, wearing a loincloth and tending the beds, his appearance rough and rustic. At the sight of Liu, he hurried forward to bow, trembling. Liu gradually asked about his hometown and family, and Wang replied, “I drift like tumbleweed, with no memory of such things, nor any kin.” Liu found this even more extraordinary. He invited Wang to sit, offered him wine, and pressed him to accept, but Wang firmly refused.

Upon returning, Liu went to the county office and requested that Wang accompany him beyond the mountain range. The magistrate, not understanding his intent, immediately sent Wang off—still in tattered clothes and straw sandals—boarding the boat with Liu. As they traveled, Liu grew familiar with Wang and had his wife and children pay their respects, sharing tea and meals with him. Yet Wang’s appearance and clothing grew increasingly filthy, and the household secretly despised him. Liu’s wife asked, “Is there something special about him? Why do you treat him so?” Liu remained unwavering. After traveling several hundred *li* toward their destination, Wang fell ill with dysentery, growing weaker by the day.

The boat’s cabin was cramped, and Wang never left Liu’s side. Those around him pinched their noses and refused to eat, unable to bear the stench. Yet Liu showed no sign of disgust—only deep sorrow. He urged Wang to take broth and porridge, but after several days, Wang passed away. Liu sighed in grief, weeping as he performed every funeral rite without omission, then buried him by the roadside.

The following year, Liu’s term ended, and he returned to the capital. On his way back, he stopped at Hengshan, where the county magistrate greeted him outside the city. Once seated, the magistrate said, “The servant you brought with you left not long ago to search for something and has just returned. He must have been unfit for service.” Liu asked in shock, “When did he return?” The magistrate replied, “A little over a month ago. He said you had given him leave to go back.” Horrified, Liu rushed on foot to the garden estate. The thatched hut still stood, but all within was empty. A neighbor told him, “Wang the Eighteenth left last night.” Overcome with remorse, Liu bowed twice toward the hut, weeping as he turned away. Upon checking the date, he realized it was the very day Wang had died of illness on the road. He sent men to open the grave, but only Wang’s clothes remained.

Months later, Liu arrived in the capital and took his place among the court officials. One day, he fell gravely ill, his condition worsening until his family gathered around him, wailing in distress. Suddenly, a frantic knocking came at the door. The doorman rushed in, announcing, “A man calling himself Wang the Eighteenth asks to be announced.” The household, trembling, hurried to greet him. Wang entered with a faint smile and went straight to Liu’s bedside. He ordered all screens and medicines removed, then drew three pills the size of small beans from a gourd at his waist. Using a reed tube, he poured half a bowl of water, fed the pills to Liu, and shook him gently. Soon, Liu’s belly rumbled like thunder. In moments, he opened his eyes, sprang up, and stood—no trace of illness remained.

Lady Liu exclaimed, "Wang the Eighteenth!" Tears and mucus streamed down her face as she bowed again and again, overcome with emotion. His wife, daughters, and servants all wept as well. Wang the Eighteenth, unmoved, said, "I am ashamed to have repaid an old debt so belatedly—thus I came to save him. This pill grants ten more years of life; when the time comes, I shall return." With that, he drank a bowl of tea and departed. Minister Liu entreated him to stay a while, but Wang refused. When Liu offered gold and silk, Wang only laughed aloud.

Later, Minister Liu was appointed Chancellor and concurrently oversaw the Salt and Iron Commission. Due to a misstep, he was demoted to Prefect of Zhongzhou. Thirty years passed. One day, stricken with illness, he was visited again by Wang the Eighteenth, who said, "I must see the Minister." Liu sighed deeply with emotion and welcomed him into his chamber. Once more, he pleaded earnestly. Wang the Eighteenth replied, "Your illness will soon pass—return the pills to me." He then dropped a tael of *ling* into water, and after Liu drank it, he vomited up three pills, their color unchanged from those he had taken thirty years before. Wang the Eighteenth asked for scented water to wash them. Liu’s nephew, who had been attending his uncle’s illness, seized two of the pills and swallowed them. Wang the Eighteenth gazed at him intently and smiled, saying, "You possess the qi of the Dao—I knew these were meant for you." He strode out and left without another word of farewell.

Minister Liu soon recovered. Months later, an imperial edict arrived, and he passed away.

Sun Deng

Sun Deng, styled Gonghe, was a native of Jiyin Commandery. He had no family and dwelt in an earthen cave in the northern mountains of the commandery. Skilled in the art of long whistling and fond of studying the *Book of Changes*, he would pluck a single-stringed zither. His nature was free of anger or ambition.

Once, he traveled to Mount Yiyang, where a charcoal-burner saw him and, recognizing him as no ordinary man, spoke to him. Sun Deng made no reply. When Emperor Wen of Jin heard of him, he dispatched Ruan Ji to observe him. After meeting, Ruan Ji spoke to him, but Sun Deng again remained silent.

Ji Kang later accompanied him for three years, asking about his aspirations, yet Sun Deng never answered. As Ji Kang prepared to take leave, he said, "Master, will you truly say nothing?" Sun Deng replied, "Do you understand fire? Fire is born with light, yet it does not use its light—does its purpose lie in using light? A man is born with talent, yet he does not use his talent—does his purpose lie in using talent? Thus, using light depends on obtaining fuel to preserve its brilliance; using talent depends on recognizing truth to preserve one’s years."

Ji Kang then asked to learn the zither, but Sun Deng refused to teach him, saying, "Your talent is vast, but your understanding is shallow—how will you escape the perils of this age?" Ji Kang departed, and Sun Deng ascended to heaven in broad daylight.

The *Book of Jin*’s biography of Ruan Ji states: Ruan Ji once encountered Sun Deng on Mount Sumen, where they discussed ancient matters and the arts of nurturing spirit and guiding *qi*. Sun Deng remained silent. Ruan Ji then let out a long whistle and withdrew. Halfway down the ridge, he heard a sound like the cry of phoenixes, echoing through the cliffs and valleys—it was Sun Deng’s whistle.

The *Comprehensive Records of Mount Nanyue* states: Sun Deng abandoned honor and rank, secluding himself to seek immortality. He endured sleeping in the open and bearing the cold, eating grasses to stave off hunger, and earnestly pursued the supreme Dao. Moved by the Red Lord, he obtained the Jade Elixir Paste and later entered Kuaiji. Thus, records say Sun Deng dwelt there, leaving his memorial tablets on Tiger Mountain.

Ji Kang

Ji Kang, styled Shuye, once followed the Daoist Sun Deng in the northern mountains to learn the zither. Sun Deng refused to teach him, saying, "You possess the talent of a fugitive—you will surely be executed in the marketplace." Ji Kang then took his leave, and Sun Deng ascended in a sudden ascent. Ji Kang traveled south and sought lodging at the home of Wang Botong of Kuaiji.

Wang Botong had built a lodge, but before three years had passed, every guest who spent the night there would die before dawn. Witnessing this ominous sign, he had long since sealed it shut. Now, as Ji Kang stayed the night within, he took up his zither after the first watch. By the second watch, he saw eight ghosts emerge from the rear of the lodge. Fearing them, he quietly recited the hexagram *Qian*—"Originating, Penetrating, Beneficial, Steadfast"—three times, then asked the ghosts: "Wang Botong built this lodge three years ago, and every guest who has stayed here has died. Was it you eight ghosts who killed them?"

The ghosts replied: "We are not murderous spirits. We were the eight brothers who served as music officials in the time of Emperor Shun, known as the *Ling Lun*. Shun, swayed by slanderous ministers, wrongfully executed us, and we were buried here. When Master Wang built this lodge, he unknowingly raised walls over our remains, crushing us beneath. Whenever someone stayed here, we would appear to warn them, but they would die of fright upon seeing us—not by our hands. Now, we beg you to tell our master to exhume our bones and rebury them elsewhere. Within half a year, he will be appointed governor of this commandery. In gratitude, we will teach you a *Guangling* melody, unmatched in all the world."

Delighted by this, Ji Kang offered his zither to the ghosts. After they played it once, he could replicate the tune perfectly. As he played deep into the night, Wang Botong, hearing the exquisite music from his residence, rose in his robe to listen. Perplexed, he questioned Ji Kang, who answered: "The ghosts who kill in this lodge—I have just seen them."

"How so?" asked Botong.

Ji Kang recounted the entire affair. The next day, Botong sent men to dig at the site, and indeed, they unearthed eight skeletons. He had coffins made and reburied them in a pure, elevated place. Later, during the reign of Emperor Wen of Jin, Botong was appointed governor as foretold, while Ji Kang became *Zhongsan Dafu*. The emperor ordered Ji Kang to face north and receive his decree, instructing palace women in music, but Ji refused. Later, swayed by slanderous ministers, the emperor had Ji executed in the marketplace. Ji embraced his zither as he died. When his coffin was opened after burial, it was empty—his body had vanished.

The *Book of Jin* states: Ji Kang, styled Shuye, was a native of *Quan* in Qiaoguo. His ancestors, originally surnamed Xi, were from Shangyu in Kuaiji but relocated to avoid enmity. Nearby stood Mount Ji, and his family settled beside it, adopting the mountain’s name as their surname. Orphaned young, Ji possessed extraordinary talent, surpassing his peers without arrogance. Standing seven *chi* and eight *cun* tall, he spoke with eloquence and carried himself with grace. Yet he cared little for his appearance, and others saw in him the bearing of a dragon or phoenix—his nature was divinely innate. Well-read and broadly learned, he married into the imperial clan of Wei and was appointed *Zhongsan Dafu*. He devoted himself to cultivating his nature, practicing dietary regimens, playing the zither, and composing poetry, finding contentment in these pursuits. He believed that the Dao of immortals was endowed by nature, not acquired through study, though through proper nourishment and guidance, one might attain the longevity of Peng Zu or Anqi Sheng. Thus, he wrote *On Nurturing Life*. He often mused that only Ruan Ji of Chenliu, Shan Tao of Henei, and their circle—Xiang Xiu, Liu Ling, Ruan Xian (Ruan Ji’s nephew), and Wang Rong—shared his aspirations. Together, they roamed the bamboo groves, becoming known to the world as the Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove. Wang Rong once remarked that in twenty years of living with Ji in Shanyang, he had never seen him display joy or anger.

Ji often gathered herbs in the mountains and marshes, losing track of time when absorbed in his pursuits. Woodcutters and gatherers who encountered him took him for a divine being. Once, in the mountains of Jijun, he met Sun Deng and traveled with him. Sun remained silent and self-contained, offering no teachings. As Ji prepared to leave, Sun said: "Your nature is fiery, your talent sharp—how will you escape calamity?" Later, Ji encountered Wang Lie, and together they entered the mountains. Wang had once found stone marrow resembling malt sugar; he consumed half and gave the rest to Ji, but it hardened into stone. They also entered a stone chamber where Ji saw a scroll of plain silk. When he called out to Wang, the scroll vanished. Wang sighed: "Shuye’s aspirations are extraordinary, yet he meets with such misfortune—it is fate."

When Shan Tao was about to depart for an official post, he recommended Ji as his replacement. Ji wrote to sever ties with him, declaring: "I have heard that Daoist adepts say consuming the yellow essence of *huangjing* grants long life, and I believe it. Roaming mountains and marshes, observing fish and birds, brings me great joy. To take office would mean abandoning what I love for what I fear—how could I do so?"

Now I wish only to dwell in my humble lane, teaching and raising my children and grandchildren, and from time to time reuniting with old friends and kin to reminisce about our lives. A cup of unstrained wine, a tune upon the zither—my aspirations are fulfilled. This letter having been sent, you will know that I cannot be fettered or bent to another’s will.

Ji was exceptionally skilled yet fond of forging. In his courtyard stood a flourishing willow, whose trunk he hollowed with rushing water to power his bellows. Each summer, he would sit beneath it to work the hammer. Lu An of Ping束, admiring Ji’s lofty spirit, would travel a thousand *li* at the slightest longing to visit him. Ji befriended and cherished him.

Later, Lu An was wronged by his elder brother’s false accusation and dragged into litigation. When called to testify, he implicated Ji, who was then arrested as well. Though Ji was cautious in speech and conduct, once bound in prison, he composed the *"Poem of Hidden Grief"*:

*"Though the day’s cause be just,
The spirit is shamed, loyalty thwarted.
Washing oneself in the Canglang’s waters—
How can this ever make amends?"*

Earlier, when Ji lived in poverty, he and Xiang Xiu would forge together beneath a great tree to sustain themselves. Zhong Hui of Yingchuan, a nobleman’s son, was sharp-witted and eloquent, yet he deigned to visit Ji uninvited. Ji neither paid him courtesy nor ceased his hammering. After a long while, Zhong left. Ji asked: *"What did you hear to come? What did you see to go?"* Zhong replied: *"I came for what I heard, and left for what I saw."* From then on, he bore resentment toward Ji.

On this occasion, Zhong told Emperor Wen: *"Ji Kang is a sleeping dragon—best not to rouse him. Your Highness need not fear the realm, but you should be wary of Ji."* He then fabricated a claim that Ji had conspired with Gongsun Qian. The emperor thus had Ji executed.

As Ji was led to the execution ground, three thousand students of the Imperial Academy petitioned to take him as their teacher, but their plea was denied. Ji glanced at the sun’s shadow, called for a zither, and played, saying: *"Yuan Xiaohong once sought to learn the *Guangling San* from me, but I always refused him outright. Now the *Guangling San* is lost forever."* He was forty years old. Scholars across the land mourned him deeply.

The emperor soon came to his senses and regretted his decision.

Earlier, Ji had once traveled to the west of Luoyang and lodged for the night at Huayang Pavilion. He took up his zither and played, and at midnight, a visitor suddenly arrived, claiming to be an ancient man. He spoke with Ji about music and rhythm, his words refined and eloquent. Then he asked for the zither, played *Guangling San*, and its melody was unparalleled. He taught it to Ji, making him swear never to pass it on to others, nor to reveal his name.

Ji was skilled in discourse and adept at composition. He compiled biographies and eulogies of lofty recluses from antiquity onward and wrote the *Admonitions of the Grand Preceptor*. The *Jizuan Yuanhai* records: Bao Shuo, Governor of Nanhai, was a man of spiritual insight. Xu Ning of Donghai studied under him, and one night, Xu heard the sound of a zither in a quiet chamber. Marveling at its mastery, he asked about it, and Bao replied, "Ji Shuye." Xu said, "Ji was bound and executed in the marketplace—how could he be here?" Bao answered, "Though Shuye appeared to die, he truly achieved *shijie*."

Dongguo Yan
Dongguo Yan was a native of Shanyang. He consumed *Lingfei San* and could write in the dark. In a dim chamber, his body emitted light, illuminating the entire room. He could also discern small objects dozens of *li* away on level ground, perceiving their true forms and colors. Moreover, regardless of whether he knew someone or not, he could foretell their life or death with perfect accuracy. In his village, he lived for four hundred years without aging. One day, dozens of people arrived in carriages to welcome him. His neighbors all witnessed this, and he bid farewell to his kin and acquaintances before departing, saying he was bound for Kunlun Mountain.

Yue Zichang
The Perfected Lord of Qianshan was a distant ancestor of Yue Shi. According to the *Zongxian Ji*, the Perfected Lord’s name was Zichang, a native of Qi. From youth, he was devoted to the Dao. At Huolin, he encountered the immortal Han Zhong, who bestowed upon him the *Lingbao Fu* and transmitted the *Jusheng* and *Chisong San*. After consuming the elixir, Zichang lived to one hundred and eighty, his complexion like that of a young girl. His nine wives and children all took the same elixir. He ascended to immortality at Laoshan, dwelling in a chamber on Fangzhang. In the divine realm, he received the *Tai Xuan Sheng Lu* and subsisted on the Five Sacred Fungi. The Supreme Lord appointed him as Gentleman of the Gate of Cultivation, ranking just below the divine hierarchy. Emperor Xuanzong of Tang dreamed of the Twenty-Eight Immortals, who corresponded to the Twenty-Eight Constellations. Among them was the Perfected Lord, who had attained the Dao at Qianshan and was titled the Perfected Lord of Qianshan.

Feng Gang
Feng Gang was a native of Yuyang.

Feng Gang often gathered the blossoms of a hundred herbs, steeping them in water and sealing them with clay. Beginning in the first month and continuing until the end of the ninth, he buried them for a hundred days, then decocted and formed them into pills. When administered to those who had suddenly died, the medicine, placed in their mouths, revived them all instantly. Gang consumed this elixir for long years, living to several hundred without aging. Later, he entered the Mountain of Earth’s Lung and ascended as an immortal.

Zhao Zhai
Zhao Zhai, styled Zirong, was a native of Shangdang. Afflicted with leprosy and near death, someone warned Zhai’s family: "Abandon him while he yet lives, for if he dies at home, this disease will plague your descendants for generations." Thus, his kin prepared a year’s provisions and carried him deep into the mountains, placing him in a stone chamber. Fearing beasts might devour him, they barred the entrance with wooden stakes. Zirong, grieving and full of self-reproach, wept day and night. After more than a hundred days, two figures suddenly appeared before the stone chamber at night. They asked, "Who are you?" Zirong, realizing he was in a remote mountain forest where mortals seldom ventured, surmised they must be divine beings. He prostrated himself, recounting his plight and begging for mercy. The figures moved through the stakes as though through mist, unimpeded. They then asked, "If you truly wish to be cured, you must take medicine. Are you willing?" Zirong replied, "Burdened by past sins, I suffer this vile affliction and have been cast out, my death imminent. If severing my feet or slicing my nose could restore me, I would gladly endure it—how much more so for medicine? I beg you, divine ones, grant me these remaining years." The immortals bestowed upon him five *sheng* of pine resin and said, "Consume this, and not only will your illness vanish, but you shall transcend the world and attain longevity." Before Zirong finished the dose, his leprous sores healed entirely, and his body grew light and strong. Returning home, his family mistook him for a ghost until he recounted what had transpired, whereupon they rejoiced. He continued taking the medicine, and after two years, his complexion grew youthful, his skin lustrous. He could outrun birds and beasts, and though over seventy, he ate pheasants and hares, crunching their bones, and carried heavy burdens all day without fatigue. At one hundred and seventy, he suddenly saw a light outside his house at night, as large as a mirror. When he asked those around him, they saw nothing. The following nights, the light grew brighter, until after several dozen days, an entire room was illuminated, allowing him to write at night. Later, he saw two figures, about three *cun* tall, on his face—exquisite maidens who played about his nose and mouth. After another year, the maidens grew to human size, no longer appearing on his face but standing beside him. He often heard the sounds of zithers and lutes, delighting in solitary joy. Living among the people for over three hundred years, his appearance like that of a child, he finally entered Baodu Mountain and ascended as an immortal.

Wang Xuanfu
Wang Xuanfu was a native of Pei.

The people of Tonghao, Deng Boyuan, studied the Dao at Chicheng and Huo Mountains. He received the methods of consuming azure essence stone rice and swallowing the elixir of solar essence, inwardly contemplating the Grotto Chamber. After thirty-four years, he could inwardly perceive his five viscera and write in the dark of night. On the fifteenth day of the first lunar month in the first year of the Yonghe reign of Emperor Mu of Jin, the Great Emperor dispatched a feathered carriage to welcome him. Xuanfu and Deng Boyuan rode clouds and mounted dragons, ascending to heaven in broad daylight. Today, he resides in the Northern Dark Garden Terrace, where he received scriptures and was appointed as the Perfected One of the Central Marchmount.

Yin Si
Yin Si was a man of Jin. On the night of the fifteenth day of the first lunar month, he sat in his chamber and sent his son to observe whether there was anything unusual in the moon. His son said, "This year will bring floods, for I see a man in the moon wearing a straw raincoat and carrying a sword." Si went out to look and said, "It is not floods but impending military chaos, for the man in the moon wears armor and bears a spear."

Zhang Li
The Minister of Works was surnamed Zhang, named Tian, and styled Ba, a native of Fengchuan County in Guangnan, Yuqi. From youth, he studied Confucian scholarship and was esteemed by all. For his talent and ability, Emperor Ming valued him, and he rose to the position of Minister of Works.

When Emperor Donghun ascended the throne, Zhang Li sighed and said, "Glory must give way to disgrace—this will harm my spirit." He then submitted a memorial to resign and retired to the south. He vowed to seek the methods of long life and enduring vision, wishing to choose a place to cultivate truth and nurture his nature. The emperor refused his resignation, but after repeated petitions, he was permitted to leave. The civil and military officials saw the Minister of Works off at the eastern gate. After several weeks, he arrived at Wenqing Post in You County, where he encountered continuous rain for over a month. Suddenly, the sky cleared, and as he stepped into the post courtyard and looked around, he caught sight of a mountain to the east of the town—its peak towering above the rest, uniquely elegant and rare, the likes of which he had seldom seen. Filled with admiration, he summoned the post official and asked about it, but the man replied, "This humble one does not know." He then called for Mao Guohua, an elder of the market, who said, "According to ancient tradition, it is called Wenshui Mountain, also known as Zilin Mountain." The Minister of Works, hearing this, found it extraordinary.

The next day, he arrived at the foot of the mountain and said to the villagers, "From the town, I saw auspicious clouds veiling its summit and purple qi congealing in the sky. There must be immortals hidden within this mountain—this is precisely what I have longed for in my life." He then entered the Wenshui source beneath the Fangguang Peak, where he built over thirty thatched huts and settled there. His entire family observed abstinence, reciting the *Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Great Cavern Scripture*. By day, he worked with the villagers to channel water and irrigate fields, upholding the Three Hundred Great Precepts. After nearly twenty years, one day, he saw a divine person holding a flowered staff emerge from the mountain and say to him, "I am the disciple of Ge Hong. By the command of the Supreme Emperor, I am to transmit to you the secrets of the golden elixir and the fire cauldron. You must keep them hidden and practice them in secret, using them to relieve the poor and suffering. When your merit is complete, we shall meet again without delay." As he left, the divine person spoke again: "I often gather with the nine immortal companions—Fuqiu, Hongya, Chisongzi, Wang Qiao, Su Dan, Ding Lingwei, Su Yin, and Yan Zhen—on the Immortals’ Summit (now called Huixian Peak), where we play the qin, chess, and enjoy wine and fruit, delighting in perfect harmony. Our comings and goings are not fixed, beyond the knowledge of the mundane world. The great medicine of the golden elixir can transcend the world and become a divine immortal. You have received it—do not lightly disclose it." The Minister of Works, having received the teaching, bowed in gratitude. Suddenly, the divine person vanished, and no one knew where he had gone.

From then on, the Minister of Works diligently practiced abstinence. Later, he perfected the work of the fire cauldron, transmuting tiles and stones into gold, which he secretly used to aid the poor, elderly, and sick. In the second year of the Tianjian era of Emperor Wu of Liang, on the fourteenth night of the eighth month, he suddenly heard a divine voice calling his name from the sky: "At dawn, lead your family into the mountain, but leave your daughter Lu Qiong at home." Between the hours of *chen* and *si*, a maidservant saw a Daoist descend from the sky, his body covered in scabs and sores. He asked, "Is the Minister of Works here?" She replied, "The Minister of Works entered the mountain early this morning and has not yet returned." The Daoist then asked, "Where is the wine cellar?" The maidservant pointed it out, and the Daoist removed his robe, entered a vat in the cellar, and bathed his afflicted body in the wine. When he emerged, he dressed properly and left. At the gate, he said to the maidservant, "When the Minister of Works returns, tell him that Daoist Ge came especially to visit him." The Minister of Works, upon hearing this, rejoiced. Detecting an extraordinary fragrance in the cellar’s wine, he ordered his servants to set up mats in the hall, and all in the household, high and low, drank the fragrant wine from the cellar until it was exhausted. Only the maidservant who had seen the Daoist bathing his sores feigned illness and did not drink.

After the feast, the Minister of Works ordered his servants to prepare hot water so he could bathe and change his clothes before sitting down. He then summoned the village elders and his disciples. He entered the mountain again, lit incense, and ascended the altar, saying to the elders and disciples, "Heaven is summoning me—I do not despise the world." As he finished speaking, phoenixes and cranes danced in the sky, and auspicious clouds gathered above the altar. His entire household of over eighty people ascended lightly into the daylight, leaving only the maidservant, who fell from the clouds midair. The Minister of Works sighed and said, "You lack the destiny for immortality—stay in the mortal world for now. When I see the Supreme Emperor, I will petition on your behalf." On the eighteenth day, the emperor ordered the Dark Warrior deity to descend and guard the mountain’s borders, appointing the maidservant as the local earth deity to protect the mountain altar.

On that day, the village elders and disciples, including Chen Ang, submitted a report to the county, which forwarded it to the prefecture. The facts were recorded in detail and memorialized to the throne, and the edict was issued to the relevant offices. From then on, the mountain was called Sikong Mountain. In the early years of the Yongjia era of Emperor Wen of Chen, two masters, Zhang and Ma of Danyang, whose full names were unknown, arrived at the mountain and said to the villagers, "We are disciples of Minister Zhang Sikong and have come especially to find his dwelling." The villagers replied, "The Minister ascended to heaven with his household on the fifteenth day of the eighth month in the second year of the Tianjian era of Emperor Wu of Liang. Only his abandoned residence remains, and no one dares to live there." The two masters, overjoyed upon hearing this, entered the mountain to fast and cultivate the Dao. One day, their work complete, an extraordinary fragrance filled the mountain.

Woodcutters who heard this perceived no omen, yet they heard the clear resonance of strings and flutes echoing through the distant sky. Raising their eyes, they saw the two masters each riding a propitious cloud and a white crane, ascending into the heavens. Today, the two peaks are named White Cloud and White Crane.

On the night of the twelfth day of the fifth month in the seventh year of the Tianbao era of the Tang, the August Emperor dreamed of the immortal altar on Sikong Mountain and ordered a shrine hall to be established there. Daoist practitioners of virtuous conduct were selected to reside and maintain the rites of incense and cultivation, and the temple was bestowed the name Zhuyang Abbey. In the seventh month of the third year of the Zhenghe era of the Song, the name was changed to Yangsheng, and Master Zhang was canonized as the Perfected One of Grand Simplicity. In the eighth month of the same year, he was further canonized as the Perfected One of Ascension.

Wang Zhongfu
Wang Zhongfu’s origins are unknown. From a young age, he was inclined toward spiritual matters and practiced the method of absorbing the dual luminaries and ingesting the rosy clouds. After more than forty years, he perceived no benefit. His son, who also practiced this method, ascended to heaven in broad daylight after eighteen years. Later, the Perfected One of Southern Marchmount suddenly descended before Zhongfu and instructed him, saying, "The reason you have not attained transcendence is that your body suffers from a grave affliction: your cranial palace is deficient, your sinews and fluids fail to flow, and your numinous essence is red and overflowing. Though you have absorbed the luminaries and ingested the rosy clouds, it has not benefited your body." Zhongfu then followed the instruction, taking medicine to treat his illness while continuing his practice. After another eighteen years, he ascended to heaven in broad daylight and now resides in the Dark Realm, where he has received scriptures and been appointed the Perfected One of the Central Marchmount.

Master Wang
Master Wang’s origins are unknown.

There was one Yang Huizhi, who had long traveled from An in the east through Wu and Chu, and upon reaching Wujiang, heard that Master Wang possessed profound mastery of the Dao. He thus presented himself at the master’s gate. The master, clad in a dark cap and hempen robe, sat leaning against a low table, his bearing refined and elegant. Huizhi bowed twice with full courtesy, and the master returned his greeting with folded hands at his side. Their discourse soared and flowed freely, and unnoticed, the day drew to evening—it was the twelfth day of the eighth month.

The master summoned his daughter, saying, “Sev’nth Maiden.” There appeared an old woman, over seventy years of age, her teeth and hair entirely withered, who shuffled forward leaning on a staff. The master said to Huizhi, “This is my daughter. Lazy and disinclined toward the Dao, she has now grown old.” Then, turning to Sev’nth Maiden, he instructed, “For me, cut paper to fashion the moon of this evening, and place it upon the eastern wall of the chamber.” Soon after, Sev’nth Maiden did as she was told. Presently, a wondrous radiance blazed forth, illuminating every fine detail within the room.

Master and guest conversed within, the cold so piercing it seemed they stood halfway to heaven. As dawn approached and they prepared to part, the master traced a line upon the courtyard with his staff. Dust swirled, obscuring all sight, and when they looked again at their surroundings, they beheld towering cliffs and ravines ten thousand *ren* deep, forests soaring to the sky, and before them, a vast expanse of water stretching beyond the horizon. Huizhi and the master stood at the water’s edge, trembling in awe and astonishment. Huizhi exclaimed, “What we have witnessed this night—is this not a single evening in the realm of immortals, a thousand years in the world of men?”

The master smiled and said, “I meant it only as amusement.” With a shake of his robe and a wave of his hand, in an instant, the courtyard returned to its former state. Huizhi fled in haste, not daring to glance back.

Lord Zhao.

Lord Zhao, Zuo Ci, and others could command water through qi, causing it to flow backward for one or two *zhang*. They once kindled a fire beneath a thatched hut to cook, yet the food was done while the hut remained unburnt. Taking a large nail, they drove it seven or eight *cun* into a pillar, then blew upon it with qi—the nail leapt forth as if shot. They boiled water to a hundred bubbling ferocities, cast in a hundred-odd coins, and bade men pluck them one by one from the scalding broth, their hands unscathed and unblistered. They could restrain water in the central courtyard, leaving it exposed to the open air, yet even in bitter cold it would not freeze. They could also bind the qi of an entire *li*, rendering the scorched impervious to heat.

*Comprehensive Mirror of Perfected Immortals Who Embodied the Dao, Scroll Thirty-Five*

Wang Lübing.
Wang Lübing had not originally grasped the great Dao, nor did he know the method of refining the great elixir. He chanced upon the *Precious Scriptures of Supreme Purity* and the *Billion-Morning Ritual Vows of the Perfected One of Grand Simplicity*, and thereafter, on the appointed evenings of each month, would enter a quiet chamber to burn incense, face north, and practice his devotions. After thirty years of secret cultivation, he attained the power to ride clouds and mount cranes, ascending to the Dark Continent. His disciples—Li Zhongzi, Zhao Shuangcheng, Fan Shu, Guan Ping’a, Li Shunxian, and Yan Ansheng—all mastered this Dao, diligently persevering without falter, and likewise became perfected immortals. Some dwelt on the Dark Continent, others ascended the slopes of Kunlun, or mounted the palaces of the Three Primes.

Cen Daoyuan.
Cen Daoyuan was a native of Jiangling. The region around Wanzhou abounded in great mountains. South of the Hong River, the forests and ravines were especially deep and secluded, where a cavern yawned, vast and resonant. At the end of the Sui dynasty, the master fled turmoil, journeying through the Three Gorges until he arrived here. Enamored of the place, he took refuge beneath the cavern. He subsisted on Solomon’s seal, and though he lived over a hundred years, his skin remained like ice and snow, his bearing serene, never betraying joy or anger. After twenty years, he departed, leaving no trace. In the tenth year of the Zhenguan era, a Jiang merchant traveling to Guangling was returning home when he spied an old man of majestic and sagely mien, his appearance most extraordinary. The merchant prostrated himself and offered fragrant tea. The merchant departed, and the master vanished from the cavern. Upon the merchant’s return, his wife was aboard the boat when they reached the lake shoals—suddenly, waves roared like thunder, unstoppable.

The merchant, startled and awakened, hastened back to the cavern, where the lingering fragrance remained—but the master had already set sail upon the calm waters, leaving no trace behind.

During the Zhenyuan era of Emperor Dezong, the Investigating Censor Duan Wenchang remarked: "The master was a transcendent of the boundless kalpa—why then did he trouble himself to dazzle the eyes and ears of mortals with wonders? Upon examining his deeds, one must conclude that the floating world is deaf and blind, oblivious to the supreme Dao, and thus he sought to stir their awakening through marvels."

In the tenth year of the Xining era of Emperor Shenzong of the Song, the prefecture’s prayers for rain were immediately answered. The prefect reported this to the court, and an imperial edict was issued, bestowing upon the master the title *True Person of Empty Mirror*.

Wang Yuan and Wang Shun gathered herbs on Mount Zhongnan when they encountered a Daoist. Today, Mount Zhongnan bears the name *Wang Shun Peak*, its numinous efficacy resplendent and unceasing to this day.

Ji Liuxin
In Jiaodong, there lived an extraordinary figure whose name is unknown. He would sing and dance in the marketplace, calling himself *Ji Liuxin*. Later, in broad daylight amidst the market crowd, he ascended upon clouds and departed.

Wang Jia
Wang Jia dwelled in the mountains of the Eastern Sea, where he sought out the immortal Huwu Qiu Lijun. From him, he received the *Defense of the Supreme Ultimate’s First Kalpa*, and by ingesting *crimson herbs* and *divine mushrooms*, he attained transcendence. The mountain lies in the sea—though it appears close, none can reach it. Upon its slopes grow *tree mushrooms*, *numinous woods*, and *divine herbs*; azure *spirit dragons* and *tortoises* dwell there, along with the rare treasures of heaven and earth, whose names cannot be spoken. Within its caverns lie texts such as the *He Luo* and the *Yuanming Calendar*.

Wang Shuming
Wang Shuming’s origins are unknown.

In his youth, he was fond of the Dao and dwelled north of Huayang Mountain, where he cultivated the Way alongside Bao Yuanzhi, sharing the same aspiration. It is unknown which immortal they encountered or what method of defense they practiced, but both attained transcendence and departed.

Tang Ruoshan
Tang Ruoshan was a native of Lu Commandery. During the *Xiantian* era of Emperor Ruizong of Tang, he served as a gentleman in the Ministry of Works and successively governed several demanding prefectures. In the *Kaiyuan* era of Emperor Xuanzong, he was appointed governor of Runzhou, where his benevolent governance earned him widespread praise near and far.

Ruoshan had long been devoted to the Dao of longevity. His younger brother, Ruoshui, was a Daoist priest at Mount Heng, having mastered the essentials of the *Womb-Origin* and *Valley Spirit*. Ruoshui was often summoned to the inner palace, where he earnestly requested to return to the mountains; the emperor granted his plea.

Ruoshan had always been fond of esoteric arts. Wherever he went, he would gather alchemists and their crucibles. Even those whose techniques were of little use were treated with courtesy and respect. His family wealth was nearly exhausted, and though his official salary never left surplus, the expenses on minerals and elixirs knew no bounds. In his later years, his resolve grew even firmer. Using the treasury funds of Runzhou to purchase ingredients, his subordinates, kin, and advisors repeatedly admonished him, but Ruoshan paid no heed.

One day, an elderly man—frail, emaciated, and with a withered countenance—arrived at his gate and requested an audience, claiming to possess the Dao of longevity. Those who saw him laughed at his decrepitude, but Ruoshan received him with utmost reverence and hospitality, keeping him for over a month. Yet all the old man discussed strayed from the principles of alchemy.

Ruoshan had extensively studied myriad formulas, songs, chants, diagrams, and records, examining them all with care. When he inquired about the old man’s strengths, he found them utterly insignificant. Moreover, the old man relished rich foods and fine wine, consuming as much as three or four men despite his frail appearance. Ruoshan served him with unwavering devotion, never showing weariness.

One day, the old man spoke leisurely to Ruoshan: "Your household of a hundred mouths is perpetually in want. Though you hold high office, your resources remain insufficient. Should you one day retire, how will you provide for them? You have misappropriated treasury funds and silks—this is truly a cause for concern."

Ruoshan replied in alarm: "I, too, have long worried about this impending transfer of office, yet I see no solution. If I am punished for this, I shall accept it willingly—my only fear is that my family will suffer hunger and cold."

The old man said: "Do not worry excessively." He urged more wine, and they drank for days. Ruoshan was not a heavy drinker, yet that day he consumed three or four cups without feeling intoxicated, which struck him as strange.

As night fell and the moon shone brightly, they set aside their cups and strolled in the courtyard. After a long while, the old man said to Ruoshan: "Have a servant bring a dozen or so iron pots, cauldrons, and utensils to the alchemical chamber. Let him arrange charcoal, build a furnace, and prepare the mortar, crucible, and tongs into a single pile. Ignite the charcoal until it blazes like a kiln, too fierce to approach."

The old man then untied a small gourd from his belt, took out two cinnabar pills, and cast them into the fire. He closed the door and stepped out, saying to Ruoshan: "You possess the bones of a Daoist and are destined for transcendence. Moreover, your conduct is upright and sincere, free from anger or resentment—such virtues are especially prized by immortals. I am a Perfected One of the Supreme Clarity, roaming the mortal realm to deliver those of earnest heart. Moved by your diligence, I have come to deliver you.

The gold and silver I transmute shall serve two purposes: one, to bequeath to your descendants and aid the poor; the other, to repay the treasury, sparing you future troubles. You should now prepare a boat to travel the river and plan your departure. Tomorrow, await me in midstream."

With that, he vanished.

At dawn, Ruoshan opened the chamber to find the transmuted treasures gleaming brilliantly, illuminating the room. He sealed them again and, with three or five of his officials and guests, set sail upon the river. As they neared Gold Mountain Temple and reached midstream, a dense fog obscured the waters, rendering even nearby objects indistinct. Ruoshan alone saw the old man rowing a fishing boat, which drew alongside their vessel. He beckoned, and Ruoshan stepped into the fishing boat, ascending beyond the mortal realm.

After some time, the wind and waves calmed, and the fog lifted. Ruoshan was gone.

Among the documents left in his office, a letter of farewell was found, instructing his family affairs. Another was a memorial to the throne, its main points as follows:

"Worldly emoluments are fleeting, and floating life is precarious. Only by ascending to the realm of the Perfected and shedding the mortal coil can one set a course for the hereafter. Of old, Minister Fan sailed away to the Five Lakes, knowing his lord could not share his joy; Zhang, Marquis of Liu, followed Master Red Pine, fearing his life could not long endure. Though their aspirations differed from mine, I, favored by an enlightened age and repeatedly honored with rank, early grasped the principle of rise and fall and deeply understood the rule of knowing when to stop.

My heart has long dwelled at the Mystic Pass, and by chance, I obtained the alchemical formula. That gold can be made confirms the ancient words of Huainan; that the white sun can be prolonged reveals the wondrous workings of the true scriptures. Having attained this, what more could I seek? Thus, I wave farewell to the red dust and soar my spirit over the azure sea. Penglai is not far, and Fusang lies in sight. Gazing afar at the imperial court, I am overwhelmed by the depth of my devotion, like a dog or horse to its master."

When Emperor Xuanzong read the memorial, he was astonished and promptly ordered that Ruoshan’s family be generously provided for. He also summoned Tang Ruoshui and dispatched him with an imperial envoy to search the rivers and coasts, but no trace was found.

Twenty years later, an old acquaintance of Ruoshan, serving as an emissary from Zhexi to Huainan, encountered him at a fish market in the city, where he was purchasing fish like an ordinary man. Ruoshan glanced at the emissary and invited him into a humble alley. After winding through several hundred paces, they arrived at a magnificent residence. The emissary was served a meal, and when Ruoshan learned of his long-standing poverty, he purchased twenty ingots of iron for him. The next day, they met again, and the iron had turned to gold, which Ruoshan gave to him entirely. The emissary, surnamed Liu, later settled in Jinling, and his descendants have included those who cultivate the Dao.

*The Comprehensive Record of the Perfected of Mount Heng* states that his brother Ruoshui achieved *corpse liberation* at Mount Heng.

Wang Xiang
The gentleman Wang, whose given name was Xiang, was a native of Duling. From birth, he possessed extraordinary integrity. Gazing for long at the lofty peaks of Mount Zhongnan, he said to his parents: "When I grow up, I shall dwell upon this mountain to seek liberation from the world."

The villagers marveled at him. He broadly studied the ancient classics and could recite whatever he read at a glance. Having come of age, he and his fellow villager Zheng Shuang pursued literary studies and sat for the imperial examinations, yet failed to pass after two years. Retiring to Stone Gate Valley in the Southern Mountains, he devoted himself to sitting in forgetfulness and returning illumination. Over the years, the transcendent Master Meng descended to transmit to him the Dao of the Three Ones and Five Thousands, enabling him to transform, take flight, and divide his form to scatter his shadow.

At the end of the *Kaiyuan* era of Tang Emperor Minghuang, his friend Zheng Shuang, then serving as a censor, was dispatched on a mission to Yangzhou. Upon arrival, he saw Wang Xiang lying in a tower in tattered clothes, standing to one side of the road. Zheng, moved with pity, sent someone to summon him to the postal station and inquired about his travels and rest. Wang replied that his sojourn had left him destitute and emaciated. The next day, he returned and said to Zheng: "You cherish the affection of an old friend—could you change into plain clothes and condescend to visit my humble abode?" Zheng agreed. Changing his attire, he followed Wang in secret, passing through gates and entering a narrow lane as if by an overgrown path, where scarcely a human footprint could be seen. After several *li* through thickets of brambles and dense undergrowth, they reached his dwelling. At the gate, Wang asked to enter first to prepare the seating. After some time, he sent an attendant to lead Zheng inside. As Zheng advanced, he beheld golden towers and jeweled terraces, vermilion eaves and jade-green halls—sights not of the mortal world. Wang wore a rosy cloud crown and cloud-embroidered robes, his feathered guards arrayed in solemn grandeur, his bearing that of a king. Zheng trembled with awe and dared not lift his gaze. Wang detained him for a feast lasting the night, with rare delicacies and immortal music beyond description.

At dawn, Wang saw him to the gate and said: "Though you have achieved fame and success, your strength remains meager and your circumstances straitened." He ordered his woodcutter attendants to carry a tattered canopy and escort Zheng back to the postal station, then instructed him to pawn the canopy at the market for a million coins as a gift. After this, Wang vanished without a trace. Zheng returned to search, but no vestige of the former place remained.

Upon returning to the capital, Zheng submitted a confidential memorial detailing all that had transpired. At the time, Emperor Minghuang was deeply devoted to the pursuit of immortals and the Dao, and had also commanded the military governor of Huaihai to seek out and inquire after Wang—but to no avail. During their conversation, Wang had told Zheng that he had already become an immortal of the Great One.

Lu Zifang
Master Void-Unbound, whose surname was Lu and given name Zifang, practiced cultivation with his father during the Kaiyuan era of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang at the Jade Bamboo Abbey of Primordial Purity. His father achieved liberation through the corpse, leaving behind an empty coffin buried beside the abbey. In time, Master Void-Unbound also perfected his practice, ascending in an airborne vessel from the tip of a cedar outside the abbey gates, vanishing into the heavens.

Wang Yu
The Perfected of Lesser Cavern, Wang Jun, whose personal name was Xia, had once committed an offense and was banished to the mortal realm for five years, during which he was to serve as a chamber attendant. Zhang Maoshi of Nanyang, whose family resided at the foot of Mount Hua, happened to travel to Luoyang during the Dali era of Emperor Daizong of Tang. There, he hired a servant in the southern market and thus obtained Xia. Though Xia appeared to be over forty, he was diligent, capable, and selfless, acting always with utmost sincerity. Whatever task could be done, he performed without needing to be instructed.

Tea Master admired him greatly and changed his name to Dabao. When he sought to reward him generously, Dabao declined. His household only cherished him all the more. After five years, one day Dabao took leave of Maoshi, saying: "Originally, my home was in the mountains, and our family estate was not meager. Yet fate cast me into misfortune, requiring me to serve as an attendant to dispel it. Now my term is complete, and I must take my leave." Maoshi, unable to fathom his words, did not detain him, allowing him to depart that very evening. As dusk fell, Dabao entered to address Maoshi: "I am deeply grateful for your kindness and wish to repay it in some way. My home lies not far from here, and its scenery is worth seeing. Might you accompany me for a visit?" Maoshi replied, "Very well."

Thereupon, Dabao cut a bamboo stalk several feet long, inscribed a talisman upon it, and handed it to Maoshi, saying: "Take this staff and enter the chamber, feigning stomach pain. Send all attendants away to fetch medicine. Once they are gone, secretly place the staff in the quilt, then slip out." Maoshi followed his instructions. Dabao then said: "You may now visit my dwelling." Together they traveled south for over a mile, where a yellow-capped attendant wielding a whip herded a green unicorn and two vermilion-striped tigers, awaiting them by the roadside. Maoshi hesitated, but Dabao said: "Have no fear, proceed forward." Upon arrival, Dabao mounted the unicorn, instructing Maoshi and the yellow-capped attendant each to ride a tiger. Maoshi, trembling with fear, dared not advance. Dabao said: "Since you trust me, why fear now? These creatures are the swiftest in the mortal realm—simply try riding one." Maoshi then mounted, finding it remarkably steady.

Thus, the servant led Maoshi, ascending and traversing peaks and valleys as if by mere thought, the perilous heights unnoticed. By the third watch, they had traveled several hundred *li*. Descending a mountain, they beheld a realm of radiant beauty, where pines and rocks were lovely beyond compare, and towers, palaces, and abbeys appeared unlike anything seen in the mortal world. As they approached the gate, Dabao flicked his whip and called: "The young master arrives." Hundreds of purple-robed officials lined the path, and gradually, dozens of maidservants in azure attire—each of extraordinary beauty and clad in resplendent, indescribable garments—approached, bearing musical instruments to lead the way. They entered the central hall, where a feast was laid. Dabao bade Maoshi sit, then withdrew, changing into ceremonial robes before returning to his seat. His attire, crown, and bearing were majestic, truly befitting an immortal.

The windows, steps, railings, screens, couches, and cushions—all were of a splendor unknown in the mortal realm. Music of phoenixes and luan birds, along with melodies of every kind, filled the air, unheard of before. Maoshi’s spirit soared, his thoughts no longer dwelling on worldly affairs. At the height of their joy, Dabao said: "This is an immortal’s abode, not a place mortals may reach. Your past karma destined you to witness this, granting you this fleeting respite. The path of immortals diverges from the mortal dust; worldly and pure cannot mingle. You should return and cultivate your mind for three or five kalpas, and we shall meet again. My mortal term is nearly complete, and my name is recorded in the upper realms. I have been summoned by the Perfected of Grand Clarity to the Grotto of Lesser Cavern, where I beheld the joys of the Nine Heavens. I was also shown the Sea of Birth and Death, and told: 'Joy is not hard to seek, nor is suffering hard to cast off—like one who builds a mountain, adding earth handful by handful.' Since then, I have cultivated through five or six kalpas, attaining this form. Looking back upon my discarded remains, they have piled like mountains. With each thought, I refined my mind, and in an instant, an age passed. Though my form has changed, this heart remains unchanged. By diligently cultivating its power, the goal is not far off. Some, when their minds are enlightened and their *qi* purified, awaken with a single word—strive on."

Dabao presented a hundred *yi* of gold to aid Maoshi’s cultivation. He then ordered the yellow-capped attendant to accompany Maoshi back to the place where they had mounted the unicorn. Again, the attendant guided him, and Dabao walked Maoshi to his home, where his family was gathered in tears. Maoshi cast the gold into a well. Dabao withdrew the bamboo staff, instructing Maoshi to secretly lie within the quilt. Dabao said: "I must now ascend to Penglai to pay respects to the Great Immortal Elder. Tomorrow morning, atop Lotus Peak, a cloud of radiant hues will gather—I shall ride it." With that, he bowed and departed.

Maoshi suddenly groaned, startling those around him. When asked, he deceived them, saying: "At first my stomach ached, then it seemed someone summoned me—suddenly, it was like this. I know not how much time has passed." His family said: "When we fetched medicine, we called to you but received no answer. Seven days have already passed. Only because your heart remained warm did we not yet prepare you for burial."

The next morning, atop Lotus Peak, a cloud of radiant hues indeed gathered and departed. Thereafter, Maoshi traveled among the famous mountains. Later, none knew where Dabao had gone, and so they named him the Unicorn Guest.

Wang the Fourth

Wang the Fourth, styled as a recluse, was the fourth son of Wang Shān, a magistrate of Luoyang. In his youth, he followed his mother to another household, and afterward, whenever he returned, the Shān family no longer acknowledged him. During the *Yuanhe* era of Emperor Xianzong of Tang, Shān was often transferred from Zheng Prefecture to the capital. Passing through the great ferry at Dongdu’s Jin Bridge, the Fourth knelt before his horse. Clad in coarse cloth and straw sandals, his appearance was that of a rustic. Shān did not recognize him. When he gave his name, Shān took pity on him.

The Fourth then said: "Uncle, now that you are bound for the imperial selection, your nephew has a small gift to offer." From within his robe, he produced five *liang* of gold, its hue like a parrot’s crest, and said: "This cannot be compared to ordinary gold. In the capital, seek out Zhang Pengzi at the gold market and give it to him—he will provide two hundred thousand *qian* in return." Shān was astonished and immediately asked: "Where have you been all this time, and where are you going now?"

He replied: "Lately, I have dwelt in the lesser grotto-heaven of Wangwu. Now I am returning to my home on Mount Emei. Knowing you would pass here, I came to pay my respects." Shān asked: "Where are you staying?" He answered: "At the Xi family’s inn by the central bridge." Shān said: "I will come to see you." The Fourth replied: "My journey has its appointed time; I fear I cannot await your visit."

Shān returned home, changed his clothes, and hurried to the inn, but the Fourth had already departed. Inquiring of the Xi family, they said: "He had four or five wives, all of exceptional beauty. When he stayed here, his saddles and horses were extraordinarily lavish. The recluse Wang carried his own sedan chair and left ahead, bound for Jiannan." Shān privately marveled but did not yet place great trust in him.

Upon reaching the capital, he instructed his servant Jier: "Take the gold left by the Fourth and seek out Zhang Pengzi in the market." Sure enough, they found him. When Jier showed him the gold, Pengzi exclaimed in surprise and delight: "Where did you obtain this? How much do you require?" Jier said: "Two hundred thousand *qian*." Pengzi then gave him the sum as before, saying: "If you need more, you may return again." Jier took the money and returned. Shān was greatly astonished.

The next day, he personally visited Pengzi, who said: "This is alchemical gold sold by the Daoist Wang the Fourth. Western merchants from the Hu lands specialize in purchasing it, and there is no fixed price. It depends only on how much the Fourth originally agreed upon—beyond that, it cannot be sold." Shān then took no more. Thereafter, though he made inquiries, he never saw the Fourth again.

Ye Qianxiao

Ye Qianxiao, styled Lucong, was a native of Jianchang in Hongzhou.

In his youth, Qianxiao served under a Daoist master on West Mountain, studying the arts of the Twelve Perfected Lords—abstaining from grains and absorbing *qi*. Once, while dwelling alone, a sudden storm arose with fierce wind, rain, thunder, and lightning. A man in white robes appeared, bowing to Qianxiao and saying: "Your virtue and power have reached perfection, and the celestial registers have honored you with promotion. You are destined to command ghosts and spirits among men, achieving even greater merits. Now, divine beings shall descend to you—you may meet them without fear." Thereupon, Qianxiao burned incense, clasped his hands in silence, and sat in meditation. Soon, from the clouds descended a vermilion-robed Perfected Official on a distant journey, accompanied by over ten divine generals, all bearing swords and tiger-and-dragon talismans. Their retinue of ghosts and spirits was vast, with yellow-robed and green-robed clerks each holding a scroll. The generals arrayed themselves and bowed to Qianxiao. The Perfected Official addressed him: "Heaven commands that these scrolls of divine generals, clerks, and soldiers be entrusted to you. May you employ them diligently to save the people of the world." Qianxiao bowed, received the celestial writ, and reverently unrolled the scrolls—like mortal military registers. The clerks managed the records, and when summoned, the spirits answered without delay.

Thereafter, when Qianxiao let out a long whistle, winds stirred through the valleys; when he sighed at the waters, rains flowed across the plains; when he scraped his foot against the earth, thunder rumbled in deep tones; when he traced his hand through the air, lightning flashed brilliantly. He wandered the world, often feigning madness, drunk and arrogant in the streets. Yet when he suddenly roared and brandished his power, those who asked would learn: "I saw a fire in such-and-such a place, or a drought in another—I summoned rain to save them." When verified, it proved true. Passing through prefectures and counties during droughts, people would beg Qianxiao to pray for rain. He would prepare an incense table, offer prayers, and in an instant, rain would fall. When asked to summon thunder, he would scrape his foot, and a crackling sound would erupt from the earth. If excessive rain caused suffering and his prayers went unanswered, he would stand and halt the rain. In winter droughts, when snow was sought, Qianxiao would don a single robe, bare his feet, and stand in the sun, whistling and chanting. Soon, winds and clouds would gather, and snow would fall through the night.

He also used talismans to relieve people’s suffering, not waiting for their pleas. Seeing the afflicted, he pitied and healed them without exception. Those with malevolent illnesses would recover merely upon hearing his name, and those who received his talismans would never suffer the same ailment again. In the eleventh year of Xiantong during the reign of Emperor Yizong of Tang, Qianxiao traveled to Haozhou, where he learned that the prefect, Liu Fang, had suddenly been struck by wind-stroke and lay at death’s door, beyond the help of renowned physicians. Qianxiao entered the prefecture with his staff and declared: "By my arrival, the governor shall be revived." He inscribed three talismans and affixed them to Fang’s shoulder, flank, and leg, saying: "Drive the wind out through the feet—you will recover in three days." The wind then whistled from the soles of Fang’s feet, and after three days, he was restored to health.

Fang, a man of broad learning and long devoted to the Dao, had governed with benevolence throughout his career. He said to his guests and officials: "I have always followed the Way, yet was suddenly stricken by this violent wind. Now, an extraordinary man has come to save me. Like Dong Feng restoring Du Xie’s soul, I have found my companion—truly, this is the reward of Daoist power." The people of the prefecture revered Qianxiao, and Fang welcomed him to the prefectural hall, treating him as a master and offering rich gifts of gold and silk in gratitude. Yet Qianxiao abruptly left Fang and departed, vanishing without a trace. Later, someone encountered him in the region of Jing and Xiang, where he spoke of the Haozhou affair and laughed. Over a decade afterward, he secluded himself on West Mountain, though some still claimed to have seen him.

Wang Can

Wang Can (some texts record the surname as Xu) served as magistrate of Wangwu during the thirteenth year of Xiantong in the renchen year of Emperor Yizong’s reign. He once recited the *Huangting Jing* six thousand times, desiring to annotate it himself but finding its profound meanings elusive. After resigning his post, he dwelled at the foot of the mountain, abstaining from grains and swallowing *qi*. He entered a cave and traveled twenty or thirty *li* until suddenly the path opened into a vast expanse. Towering cliffs rose ten thousand *ren* high, and within a grotto stood stone tables and chairs, arranged as if inhabited. On the table lay an ancient scroll of scripture. Not daring to take it, he bowed twice and said: "Your servant, aspiring to longevity, has trespassed into this grotto heaven—what a rare encounter across ten thousand kalpas! Now, beholding this jade table and mysterious scripture, I humbly beg the Perfected Immortal to permit this mortal’s eyes a glimpse."

After a long while, a figure suddenly appeared beside the table and said: "You have come with great diligence. I am Wang Taixu, the Perfected Lord of the Boundless Void, sharing your surname. I have completed my annotations on the *Huangting Jing* and shall now bestow them upon you." He also gave Can a peach pit, large as a vessel holding several *dou*. "This peach grows in the Fusang Grove of the Radiant Emperor. Those who eat it ascend in broad daylight. Grind and consume this pit—it will not only cure illness but also prolong life. You may not remain here; our next meeting shall be in twenty years." With these words, he vanished. Can carried the pit and the scripture back, consumed the pit, and recited the text. His appearance grew ever more youthful.

The *Huangting Jing* annotated by the Perfected Lord of the Eastern Extremity exists in the world.

Li Jue

Li Jue was a native of Jiangyang in Guangling.

Li Jue was born into a family that had long resided in the city, trading in salt as their livelihood. Yet his nature was singularly upright and cautious, setting him apart from his peers. At fifteen, he followed his father in the salt trade. When his father grew old, Li Jue took over the business. Whenever someone came to purchase salt, he would hand them a measuring scoop and let them measure it themselves, charging only two *wen* of profit per *sheng*, regardless of whether the price was high or low, all to support his parents. As the years passed, his clothing and possessions grew abundant. His father, finding this strange, questioned him, and Li Jue truthfully explained. His father said, "Among those who share our trade, none do not manipulate their measures—giving less when selling and taking more when buying—to seek greater profit. Though officials conduct biannual inspections, they cannot eradicate this practice. I realized this long ago, yet even I use the same measure for both buying and selling, believing it to be impartial. But you now leave the measuring entirely to the customers—something I cannot match. That our family enjoys such abundance must surely be the aid of divine spirits."

After his parents passed away, Li Jue, even at over eighty years of age, did not alter his trade. During the Tang Dynasty, when another Li Jue became Chancellor and took command of Huainan, the elder Li Jue, sharing the same name as the new governor, avoided him by changing his name to Kuan.

After the Chancellor Li Jue assumed office, he began cultivating the Dao several months later. One night during his fast, he dreamed he entered a grotto palace, where the scenery was that of spring—mist and blossoms in riotous bloom, phoenixes soaring and cranes dancing amid clouds of auspicious hues, with pavilions stretching endlessly. Li Jue wandered alone beneath them when he saw a gleaming stone wall inscribed with golden characters listing people’s names. Among them was "Li Jue," the characters over two *chi* in length. Overjoyed, he thought to himself, "Born in an enlightened age, I have long held high office and risen to the rank of Chancellor—could I lack merit and virtue that extend to the world? To have my name inscribed in this grotto palace means I am an immortal!" He rejoiced repeatedly.

As he did so, two immortal youths emerged from either side of the stone wall. Li Jue asked, "What place is this?" They replied, "The Hua Yang Grotto-Heaven. But this name is not yours, Chancellor." Startled, he asked again, "If not mine, then whose is it?" The youths said, "This belongs to a commoner from Jiangyang District." At dawn, Li Jue recalled the dream in vivid detail and was filled with astonishment. He inquired among Daoist priests, but none could explain it. He then summoned the officials of Jiangyang to question them, but they too knew nothing. Thus, he ordered a search within the prefectural city for someone sharing his name. After several days, through the recommendations of military camps and neighborhoods, they found Li Kuan, formerly named Jue.

Li Jue had him brought to the prefectural residence by carriage, provided him with a chamber for fasting and bathing, and bowed to him as his Daoist elder brother. His entire household revered and served him, paying their respects morning and evening. Li Kuan’s temperament was naturally serene, his Daoist bearing refined and striking, with a beard over a *chi* long, white and admirable. At sixty, he had once been taught embryonic breathing by a Daoist and had long since ceased eating. The Chancellor Li Jue grew even more reverent toward him. After more than a month, he asked, "Elder brother, what Daoist arts have you mastered in your life? What elixirs have you refined and consumed?" He explained that he had dreamed of the grotto palace and seen the name on the stone wall, and that the immortal youths had pointed to Li Kuan—thus, he had invited him to be his teacher and wished to be instructed.

Li Kuan declined, saying he knew nothing of Daoist arts or elixir refinement. When Li Jue pressed him earnestly about his cultivation, Li Kuan, as a humble commoner unaware of such practices, simply described his salt-trading business. After repeated questioning, Li Jue sighed in admiration, "This is a task most men find difficult—your hidden merit is beyond compare." He added, "Now I understand that even the wealthy and noble may suffer loss, while the poor and lowly, through such deeds, gain divine protection. To have one’s name inscribed in the immortal registry serves as a warning to the worldly. As for embryonic breathing and abstaining from food, I have answered truthfully."

Thereafter, Li Jue daily practiced embryonic breathing under Li Kuan’s guidance. Later, Li Kuan lived to over a hundred years of age, his vigor and health extraordinary. One day, he told his descendants, "I have lingered in this world for many years. Though I have nurtured my *qi*, it brings you no benefit." That night, he passed away. Three days later, a sound came from his coffin. When opened, his clothes and belt remained untied, as if he had shed them like a cicada—he had achieved liberation in the flesh.

Xu Zhongyuan

One day in a Tang Dynasty winehouse in Shu, a Daoist priest passed by to drink. His complexion was youthful, his hair black as lacquer, and his brows and eyes sparse yet refined. As the wine took effect, he leaned on Xu’s shoulder and sang:

*"The tail stream cannot hold back the draining of the vast river,
The nine-cycled divine elixir is all but idle talk.
Only the pearl atop the dragon’s head
Can mend the cave beneath the Jade Hall’s gate."*

Among the neighboring patrons was a man named Xu Zhongyuan who, observing him, said to his companions, "This is no ordinary mortal." He rose to show respect and asked to understand the meaning of the song. The Daoist replied, "Today is not the time to explain. If you truly wish to know, come seek me at the Zhangren Temple on the Double Ninth Festival." Xu then moved his seat to drink with him, but the Daoist left before finishing.

On the appointed day, Xu arrived at the temple at dawn, only to find the Daoist already there. The Daoist reached into his robe and produced a short scroll, handing it to Xu. "This is Lord Lao’s art of returning to youth. I have consumed this elixir and now live to four hundred and twenty-three years. As your innate destiny aligns with this, and your sincerity is profound, I bestow it upon you. If you cultivate hidden merit to perfect it, you shall become an immortal." With these words, he transformed into a white crane and flew away. Xu bowed twice and accepted the scroll. Returning home, he refined and consumed the elixir without cease. Within a few years, his appearance grew youthful, his movements swift as a galloping horse, and his strength equal to that of several men. Later, he entered Mount Qingcheng and was never seen again. Some of his disciples who obtained his arts passed them on to others.

The song speaks of the "Weilü" that cannot withstand the exhaustion of the vast and dark: this refers to the Weilü as the water-draining cave of the Eastern Sea, the place where the qi of the human body is discharged—also called the Weilü. If this is not restrained, even the boundless ocean will run dry.

As for the "Nine-Turn Divine Elixir" being entirely deceptive: it means that dragon-tiger lead and mercury, yin and yang, sun and moon, yellow sprouts and white snow, infant boy and crone girl—none of these return to unity. Only the pearl atop the striped dragon’s crown can mend the cavity beneath the Jade Hall Pass.

This refers to taking a pair of deer antlers, cutting them into three-inch sections, and soaking them in east-flowing river water to wash away the earth. For each catty, use one tael of paper mulberry fruit, two taels each of yellow wax and white mulberry bark, place them in a vessel of metal or stone, and simmer over a slow fire for three days and nights, replenishing with hot water as needed. Once done, pare away the blackened skin and consume it.

Shi Wuji
Master Shi’s given name was Wuji, and his place of origin is unknown. He often traveled to the capital, eating little—sometimes going months without food, drinking only a small amount of wine each day. When pressed to eat, he could consume a whole *dou* of rice in one meal. His body bore blue-green fur, and when people saw him, their qi would circulate; his hair stood straight on end.

He treated illness with water instead of medicine and taught others to practice propriety and righteousness. A mad scholar named Ma Cun followed him for several days, to which the master said, "What do you seek from me?" Cun replied, "I have devoted myself to the furnace and fire for some time, yet have achieved nothing. I wish you would briefly outline the essentials."

At first, the master looked up and sighed deeply, then lowered his head and reproached Cun, saying: "Your family’s wealth exceeds tens of millions—gold and jade piled high, their cords rotting in the treasury, grain moldering in the granary. Yet you eat no more than a few bowls a day and wear no more than a bolt of cloth. Still, you are not content; your insatiable heart is plain to see. A swindler might deceive you, saying, 'Obtain the great elixir, burn strange substances into gold, use it to make drinking vessels, and you may learn to become an immortal.' These are the private words of a fraud, not the ultimate discourse of a true adept.

Long ago, Han Yu and Lü Dongbin first studied the Dao. Someone told them, 'You must obtain an auxiliary art. I possess a guard, which, when used with medicine to boil copper, turns it into silver.' They asked, 'Will it change?' The man replied, 'After five hundred years, it will revert to its original state.'"

Vang replied, "I would not wish to learn it, lest I lead others astray five hundred years hence." With these words, his profound sincerity moved the heavens, and his name was concealed in the true register. To this day, he remains among the immortals.

Cun bowed twice and departed. The Master often resided on Mount Hua.

**Scroll Thirty-Six of the Comprehensive Mirror of True Immortals Through the Ages Who Embodied the Dao**

Wei Yu
Wei Yu was a native of the capital. His father, Xian, was a traveling merchant who frequently journeyed to the regions of Hunan and Hubei. After three years without returning, his mother said to Yu, "Your father has been gone so long—if all were well, he would have come back. I worry day and night. You should go and seek him."

Yu then traveled south into Chu and reached Tanzhou, where he encountered a lame man with whom he shared a drink. The lame man took a large jar and filled their cups. After drinking, he left half the wine and handed it to Yu, saying, "You may drink this." Yu did so and immediately detected an extraordinary fragrance. He drained the cup in one gulp, and the lame man rejoiced, saying to him, "You have come seeking your father. Do you know who I am?" Yu bowed and replied that he did not. The lame man said, "I know where he is."

Yu bowed again and asked what he knew. The lame man said, "Tomorrow, go several *li* beyond the Qingtai Gate. You will see several newly built thatched huts—those are my dwelling. I will show you where your father is." Then they parted.

Yu sat and waited for dawn, then set out beyond the Qingtai Gate. After traveling more than ten *li*, he saw on the left side of the road several new huts, neat and elegant. Two young attendants in blue stood at the gate and asked, "Are you not Master Song?" He replied, "I am."

They led him inside. Upon ascending the hall, he saw the lame man, now wearing a tall hat and purple robe, his bearing fierce as a wolf or tiger. He bowed to Yu and invited him to sit. Soon, wine and dice were brought forth, along with rare delicacies and exotic treasures—even the households of princes and dukes could not compare.

After some time, the lame man said, "Let us have some amusement. Bring the Great Flyer and the Lesser Flyer." A servant took two pellets from a vessel, their luster like silver, placing one before the lame man and one before Yu. The lame man commanded, "Let the two of you display your skills to entertain our guest."

The two pellets flew up and struck each other, transforming into long swords that clashed without cease, multiplying into over a thousand blades. Their edges were as sharp as autumn waters; they scattered like stars in formation, gathered like bundled silk, flashed like startled lightning, moved slowly like a drawn rope, spun like a wheel of fire, or flowed like waves. After some time, the lame man asked, "Would you like to master this art? Simply swallow one pellet, and its transformations will be yours."

Yu replied, "I came only to seek my father and do not wish to learn this."

The lame man said, "You have traveled long and must be weary, lacking even daily necessities. I have a method for transmuting silver with an elixir—I could teach it to you."

Yu said, "My fate is meager, and my capacity is limited to mere pecks and bushels. I fear I am unworthy, nor do I wish to learn."

The lame man exclaimed in surprise, "Your Dao surpasses even mine!" He ordered the attendants to clear away the cups and dishes, then said, "Your father died as a traveler in Xiangzhou. Go and seek him, and you will find what you seek. You may return here another day."

Yu returned home. The next day, he went back, but the hut was already empty. He journeyed to Xiang and indeed recovered his father’s bones.

Later, Yu passed the imperial examinations and wandered as a cloud-water monk. His complexion remained rosy and lustrous, and he lives to this day—likely due to the lingering power of that half-cup of wine.

Wei Shanjun
Wei Shanjun was descended from a family of the capital, Jingzhao.

Great-Grandfather roamed freely and never entered official service. Grandfather Xuanmin once served as magistrate of Gong County, and so the family settled in Gong. Father Ang was fond of mountains and rivers.

His mother, née Wang, during her early pregnancy, would suffer abdominal pain for nights on end whenever she glimpsed sacrificial meats, and so she ate only vegetables. After Wei Shanjun was born, at the age of thirteen he maintained a strict vegetarian diet and recited the *Scripture of Dao and Virtue*, the *Scripture of Salvation for Humanity*, the *Western Ascension*, and the *Ascension to the Mystery*, among other texts. Whatever others bestowed upon him, he used entirely for relief and charity.

In his prime, he journeyed to Songyang Abbey to study the Daoist arts under Huang Yuanji, then followed Han Yuanzui of Dongyuan Abbey in Linru, receiving further esoteric teachings. Two blue youths often attended him at his side.

In the early *Tiaolu* reign of Emperor Gaozong of Tang, a man named Liu Wener passed west of the mountain and saw a divine being over ten feet tall, clad in armor and seated. Upon seeing Shanjun approach, the figure rose and drew near. Wener asked those familiar with such matters, who said, "This is a follower of the Precept Dao." His elder brother Qin, struck by wonder, then followed Shanjun back to Songyang.

During Empress Wu’s *Tisheng* era, he took residence at Ascension Abbey. One day, he again saw the divine being, who cried harshly, "Who are you, daring to come here? Leave at once, or you will be harmed!" Shanjun replied, "Are you testing me, divine one? Why press so severely?" The divine being then yielded and departed.

Another time, passing through Tanxu Village to the east, he encountered a black-and-grey dog that circled him without leaving. He took it in and named it Black Dragon. During the *Ruyi* era, intending to visit Shaolin Temple, he fed it his vegetarian meal. A monk said, "Is it right to feed a dog before people eat?" Shanjun apologized, "I was wrong." Soon after, he left the temple, and as he looked back from a distance, the dog grew larger, stretching several *zhang* in length, transforming into a dragon. Shanjun mounted it and returned to Songyang, never venturing beyond its borders again.

In the *Changshou* era, he suddenly told his disciples, "I have studied the Dao for ninety-nine years, and now it is a hundred. The Most High summons me; I must go." Then he rode the dragon away.

Zhang Huigan, styled Zhiyuan, was a native of Gao'an and the fourteenth-generation descendant of the Orthodox Unity Perfected One. He relocated from Chongyuan Abbey to seclude himself at Fuyun, dedicating himself to the cultivation of the Dao of divine transcendents during the reign of Empress Wu of the Tang. A wandering Daoist of Weiguan Abbey, Hu Huichao, who had lived for several centuries, once traveled to the Wu Field Waterfall in Gao'an and paid homage to the Fuyun Master Huigan at the Wu Immortal Altar.

In the fifth year of the *Chang'an* era, Empress Wu summoned Huigan to serve as State Preceptor, holding a ritual fast in the Hall of Light. There, he beheld auspicious clouds, divine dragons, and yellow cranes soaring and alighting. She then dispatched him to Taiqing Palace in Bozhou to perform the Golden Register Fast and offer libations at the Nine Wells. The wells had long been dry, and at the time, ice and snow congealed thickly. Suddenly, a sound like thunder arose, and water surged violently forth as two dragons emerged to frolic. The Empress, astonished, bestowed upon him five hundred bolts of silk.

Returning to Fuyun, he wandered to the Wu Field Waterfall, the Two Worthies Temple of Shulin, and the Three Primordials Abbey, where he made offerings to the Six Ding spirits, expressed gratitude to the Seven Primes, and refined elixirs at Fuyun. During the *Tianbao* era of Emperor Ming, a divine being descended upon the altar and declared, "Your cultivation has been diligent and arduous; the various transcendents have recommended you. Tomorrow at cockcrow, you shall ascend in broad daylight." As foretold, clouds and strange phenomena descended, and he ascended in a blaze of daylight.

A bell cast in the first year of the *Jiushi* era of Empress Wu (the *Gengzi* year) bears an inscription recording Huigan’s name, which may still be examined. In the *Diaolu* Township of Gao'an, the ancestral lane of the Zhang family, where Huigan once lived, remains to this day.

Zhang Zhihe, the Master of Profound Reality, was surnamed Zhang, named Zhihe, and styled Zitong. A native of Shanyin in Kuaiji, some say he was originally from Jinhua in Muzhou, and his original name was Guiling. At sixteen, he passed the *Mingjing* examinations and presented a memorial to Emperor Suzong of Tang, who esteemed and favored him, appointing him as an Academician-in-Attendance in the Hanlin Academy and bestowing upon him his new name. After the passing of his parents, he no longer served in office.

Dwelling upon rivers and lakes, he called himself the "Fisherman of Mist and Waves." He wrote the *Master of Profound Reality*, adopting it as his sobriquet. A certain Wei Yi composed an inner commentary for it. Zhihe also wrote the *Great Simplicity* in fifteen chapters, comprising three hundred and sixty-five hexagrams. His elder brother, Heling, fearing he would linger in the world and never return, built him a hut east of Yuezhou. Its thatch was of living grass, its beams and rafters untouched by axe or adze, its mats of leopard skin, its sandals woven of rushes. Whenever he fished, he used no bait, for his aim was not the catch.

Governor Chen Shaoyou visited him and was detained for the whole day. He memorialized the dwelling as "Profound Reality Lane." Finding the gate too narrow, he expanded it, naming it "Turning Pavilion Alley." Previously, the gate had been blocked by a flowing stream with no bridge; Shaoyou built one, and the people called it "The Grand Master’s Bridge."

The emperor once bestowed upon him a male and female slave, whom Zhihe paired as husband and wife, naming them "Fisher Boy" and "Woodcutter Green." When Lu Yu asked who his companions were, he replied: "The Great Void is my chamber, the bright moon my candle; I dwell with all gentlemen under heaven—who is there to come or go?"

Zhihe was skilled in painting. He could drink three *dou* of wine without becoming drunk. Preserving his true nature and nurturing his *qi*, he felt no cold in snow nor wetness in water. He traveled through all the mountains and rivers under heaven.

The Duke of Lu, Yan Zhenqing, was a close friend. When Zhenqing served as prefect of Huzhou, he gathered his retainers for a drinking feast and composed *Fisherman’s Songs* in turn. The first verse was Zhihe’s own:

*By West Fortress Mountain, white gulls take flight,*
*Peach blossoms drift on waters where mandarin fish grow plump.*
*In bamboo hat and green straw cloak,*
*Through slanting wind and fine rain, there’s no need to return.*

Zhenqing, along with Lu Hongjian, Xu Shiheng, and Li Chengju, composed twenty-five verses in response, each praising the others. Zhihe then took up brush and silk, painting scenes to accompany the lyrics. In an instant, five scrolls were complete—trees and flowers, birds and fish, mountains and waters—so wondrous in their traces that none before or since could match them. Zhenqing and his guests passed them around, marveling without end.

Later, when Zhenqing traveled east to Pingwang Post, Zhihe, flushed with wine, played upon the water. He spread a mat upon its surface and sat alone, drinking and chanting. The mat moved to and fro with the speed of a punted boat. Clouds and cranes followed, hovering above. Zhenqing, his attendants, and guests watched in astonishment. Soon after, Zhihe waved farewell to Zhenqing from the water’s surface and ascended, vanishing into the sky. His treasures are still said to be preserved among the people.

**Zhu Ruzi**
Zhu Ruzi was a native of Angu in Yongjia. From childhood, he studied under the Daoist Wang Xuanzhen, dwelling in the cliffs of Great Bamboo Rock. His master, Tao Liju, had once cultivated the *True Instructions* there, so the place was also called *True Instructions Rock*. To the west of the rock lay Mount Tao. Ruzi served Xuanzhen with diligence and reverence, deeply admiring the Dao of immortality. He often climbed mountains to gather Solomon’s seal, which he consumed as sustenance, continuing thus for over a decade.

One day, as he washed vegetables by the stream, he noticed two small flower-like dogs by the bank. Finding them strange, he chased them to the base of a wolfberry bush. Xuanzhen and Ruzi searched together and dug up two wolfberry roots, their shapes resembling the flower-dogs, hard as stone. They washed them clean, took them home, and boiled them. Ruzi tended the fire, adding fuel for three days and nights without leaving the hearth. He tasted the broth and drank it endlessly. When the roots softened, he told Xuanzhen, and together they ate them. Suddenly, Ruzi ascended in flight to the peak before them. Xuanzhen watched in astonishment for a long while. Ruzi bid farewell to Xuanzhen and rose into the clouds, departing. To this day, the peak is called *Tongzi Peak* ("Boy’s Peak"). Later, Xuanzhen consumed all the remaining roots but lived on without anyone knowing his age or lifespan, eventually vanishing into the western cliffs. On Mount Tao, hunters sometimes claim to see him.

**Wang Lao**
Wang Lao was a native of Yijun County in Fangzhou. He lived in the countryside, deeply devoted to the Dao and fond of guests, diligently performing hidden acts of virtue. His wife shared his aspirations without weariness. One day, a Daoist in tattered robes arrived at his door. Wang Lao and his wife welcomed him, treating him with reverence for over a month. Daily, they engaged in profound discussions and drank together in great harmony. Soon after, the Daoist developed severe sores all over his body. Wang Lao sought medicine and tended to him with even greater care. The sores worsened, persisting for nearly a year, until the Daoist said, "There is no need for ordinary medicine. Simply soak me in several *dou* of wine, and I will heal." Wang Lao prepared the wine with meticulous care. When it was ready, the Daoist instructed, "Fill a large jar with the wine, and I will add medicine to it myself." He then stripped, climbed into the jar, and emerged three days later—his hair and beard turned black, his face youthful, his skin smooth as congealed lard. Wang Lao’s entire household marveled at the sight. The Daoist told him, "This wine can be drunk and will enable one to ascend to heaven." Wang Lao believed him.

Initially, the jar held over five *hu* of wine. When they checked later, only two or three *dou* remained—clear, fragrant, and far superior to ordinary wine. At the time, Wang Lao was threshing wheat with two others. They drank together and became thoroughly drunk. The Daoist also drank and asked, "Shall we ascend to heaven?" Wang Lao replied, "I will follow wherever you lead." Suddenly, an auspicious wind arose, and colorful clouds swirled like steam. The house, thatched roof, trees, the entire household—people, parrots, and dogs—all ascended at once, the sound of threshing still audible in the air. Villagers gathered to watch in awe. Only the cats and mice were left behind. When the wind settled, the two hired threshers were found beneath a tree in a neighboring village. Later, they ate nothing yet lived long lives. Today, thirty *li* west of Yijun County, the *Shengxian Township* ("Ascension Village") still stands.

**Hou Daohua**

Hou Daohua claimed to have come from Mount Emei, and he stayed at Daojing Monastery in Yongle County of Hezhong. He behaved like a madman, and all the Daoist priests looked down upon him. He also said he was from Yincheng in Shanzhou and had traveled to Daojing Abbey on Mount Zhongtiao to serve Master Zhou, whose religious name was Wu Xian. He often acted like a madman, and whenever any part of the monastery was damaged, he would take up an axe to repair it. He climbed perilous heights and stood on precarious ledges where others dared not go. Yet he also performed menial tasks: when guests arrived, regardless of whether they were Daoists, laypeople, or commoners, he would carry water, draw hot water, and wash their feet and clothes. He also dredged ditches, watered gardens, and endured every hardship to serve the community. The others despised him even more, driving him with harsher commands than they would a servant, yet Hou Daohua remained ever compliant. He was also fond of histories and philosophical texts, never letting a book leave his hands, reciting whatever he read aloud. When others asked why he bothered, he replied, "There are no foolish immortals in heaven." They all laughed at him.

After more than ten years, a divine light sometimes appeared on the beams of the main hall, and people often saw it. According to legend, during the Kaiyuan era of the Tang, Master Liu once refined an elixir. He tested it on a dog, which died, so no one dared consume it, and he hid it in the hall’s beams. Most dismissed this as nonsense. *The Precious Jade Record of the Primordial* states: According to *The Xuan Shi Records*, during the reign of Emperor Wenzong of the Tang, the Daoist Deng Taixuan refined an elixir and left a small box of it in the monastery. When the hall later fell into disrepair, Hou Daohua repaired it. Climbing onto the beam, he found a small golden box containing the elixir, which he swallowed before tossing the box aside. After consuming the elixir, he showed no immediate change.

One day, he went to the market and returned drunk. The monastery had a pine tree with sprawling branches, a fine sight. Hou Daohua put on wooden clogs, climbed the tree, and began chopping off all the branches. The other Daoists repeatedly tried to stop him, but he refused. As he chopped, he said, "This will be where I ascend one day." The others, thinking him mad, grew even angrier. Just then, the magistrate of Yongle County arrived, and his attendants, seeing Hou Daohua cutting the pine, were deeply astonished. The Daoists reported the matter to the magistrate, who reprimanded and humiliated him, but Hou Daohua remained unperturbed.

Seven days later, Hou Daohua rose at dawn, bathed, dressed, and burned incense, saying, "The immortals’ envoys will come to welcome me." He bowed repeatedly toward the sky, though no one believed him. Soon, people said they saw clouds and cranes swirling above the pine, accompanied by the clear sounds of flutes and reed pipes. Suddenly, Hou Daohua flew to the top of the pine and sat there. The crowd, greatly alarmed, rushed to watch, along with the magistrate of Yongle County and both Daoists and laypeople. The magistrate who had once humiliated him kowtowed until his forehead bled, but Hou Daohua waved his hand in farewell. He said, "I have received a decree from the Jade Emperor, appointing me as Immortal Terrace Gentleman and Keeper of the Shangqing Palace’s Hall of Good Faith. I depart now." He left behind a poem:

*Within the wrapper, the Great Return Elixir,*
*Its color unchanged for many years.*
*Last night, I carelessly consumed it all—*
*Today, I soar into the azure sky.*
*With shame and gratitude, I bid you farewell,*
*Farewell, Master Deng.*
*Years ago, you refined this medicine,*
*Leaving it for the inner zhi.*
*My master, knowing this art,*
*Refine it swiftly, do not delay.*
*Standing in attendance before the Three Pure Ones,*
*My appointment in the Great Luo is assured.*

In an instant, celestial music filled the air, and banners and canopies appeared faintly in the distance. He ascended into the sky.

In the fifth year of the Dazhong era of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang—alternatively recorded as his farewell address—he declared: "On the first day of the seventh month last year, I was graced by the descent of the Perfected One Han Zhong, sent by the Supreme Lord Lao, who bestowed upon me the surname Li and the name Neizhi, appointing me to reside in the Shangqing Palace’s Hall of Good Faith." Thereupon, he removed his sandals beneath the pine, ascended beyond the ancient pine’s crown, and hung his robes upon its branches before ascending.

Zheng Yunsu of Zhongtiao composed a poem at the Daojing Abbey:

*Upon the pine’s peak, robes left to soar to jade skies,*
*An eternal legacy of the sacred near, transforming Zhongtiao.*
*Do the immortals in their finery bow in greeting?*
*How could it be that now, but two nights part us?*

Governor Zheng Guang inspected the site and reported the matter to the throne. By imperial decree, five hundred bolts of silk were granted, along with imperial robes to adorn the halls and corridors. The abbey was named Ascension Abbey.

Your servant Daoyi remarks: Hou Daohua cultivated the Dao through diligence and humility, subordinating himself to serve others. Witness how he personally wielded the axe and adze to repair the halls and chambers, and performed tasks such as drawing water, boiling broth, and tending the gardens—laboring like a servant among the assembly. Had he not ultimately attained transcendence, would anyone have regarded him as an immortal? For true immortals, in their manifestation of transformation, must carry profound intent.

The *Daodejing* states: "Heaven is eternal, earth enduring. The reason heaven and earth can be eternal and enduring is that they do not live for themselves—thus they attain long life. Therefore the sage places himself last yet finds himself first; disregards his form yet preserves it. Is it not because he is selfless that he fulfills himself?" Hou Daohua embodied this principle.

Ma Xiang
Ma Xiang, styled Ziran, was a native of Guano County in Hangzhou. His family had long served as minor clerks in the county, but Xiang alone delighted in the classics and history, devoting himself to literature. One day, the county magistrate ordered him to travel to Xichuan. Xiang fretted over the journey, but after covering twelve *li* north of the county, he suddenly encountered a Daoist, who led him into a stone well. In an instant, they arrived in Xichuan. After retrieving the documents, he emerged unknowingly from the same well and returned to the county to deliver them. All who witnessed this were astonished, and the well came to be called the "Stone Well of the Immortal," which remains to this day. Thereafter, he followed a Daoist master, wandering throughout the land.

Later, he returned to Jiangnan and often became drunk in Huzhou. Once, he fell into the Shu Brook and emerged after a full day, his robes dry. Sitting upon the water, he declared: "Just now, I was summoned by King Xiang Yu for wine. I grew tipsy and have only now returned to the brook’s edge." A throng gathered to watch, and the scent of alcohol still assailed them. His manner was wild, like one possessed, and many followed to observe. At times, he would thrust his fist into his nose, and upon withdrawing it, his nose remained unchanged. He could also point at the brook’s waters and make them flow backward; after a meal’s time, he pointed at a willow tree, causing it to drift with the current, then return. He pointed at a bridge, breaking it, then mending it again.

Later, while traveling in Changzhou, he met Ma Zhi, who was appointed prefect of the region. Zhi, having long heard of Xiang’s reputation, invited him for an audience and received him with extraordinary courtesy. Zhi asked: "Reverend brother, since we share the same surname, might we become sworn brothers, that I may learn from your Way?" Xiang replied: "What is your ancestral seat?" Zhi answered: "Fufeng." Xiang jested: "Your Excellency is a Fufeng horse, while I am but a wind-driven ox—let us simply know one another, without pressing our shared surname." His meaning was that he and Zhi were as unrelated as wind and horse or ox. Nevertheless, Zhi detained him in the prefectural residence, treating him with even greater respect.

During a drinking gathering, Zhi requested to witness a minor display of his powers. Xiang then took a porcelain vessel, filled it with soil, and planted a melon. In moments, the vine grew, blossomed, and bore fruit. He plucked and shared it, and all the guests marveled at its fragrance and sweetness, unlike any ordinary melon. He also reached into his robe and socks, drawing forth an uncountable number of coins, all of which were cast as bronze cash. Tossing a handful into a well, he called to them, and each coin flew out one by one.

Those who took the coins soon lost them again.

Zhi also remarked that rats infested the city. Xiang inscribed a talisman and had it affixed beneath the southern wall. Striking a plate with a chopstick, he let out a long whistle, and rats came in swarms, scurrying to the talisman and prostrating themselves. Xiang then called to the rats, and a large one approached the steps. He admonished it: "You, a mere creature of fur, are granted grain by Heaven—how dare you gnaw through walls and disturb the prefect day and night? Though I pity you and do not wish to kill you, you must lead your kind away from here at once." The large rat turned to the others, and all kowtowed in apology before forming ranks—numberless as they were—and departing through the city gate. From that day forth, rats vanished from the city.

Later, Xiang journeyed south to Yuezhou. Passing the Dongyan Monastery, he encountered three or four hundred monks at their midday meal. When the monks saw Xiang and the Daoist Wang Zhiwei of Muma Rock in Weizhou’s Yongkang County, along with Zhiwei’s disciple Wang Yansou, they merely gestured for them to sit and eat, offering no bows—only sending someone with rice. Xiang refused to eat, urging Zhiwei and Yansou to finish quickly and rise. The monks had not yet concluded their meal when they left the monastery, and Xiang again hastened their departure. By the time they reached an inn seventy *li* south of Zhuji County, it was deep night when they heard voices calling for the Daoist. The innkeeper hurried to answer, and two monks begged to see the Daoist. When brought before Xiang, they prostrated themselves, weeping and wailing: "The monks failed to recognize a Daoist adept yesterday. We neglected to welcome you properly, incurring your anger. Three hundred monks remain unable to descend from the forest even now. We two, as the monastery’s stewards, could not sit still, so we came to beg your forgiveness." Xiang merely lay sleeping, ignoring them, while Zhiwei and Yansou laughed. The monks pleaded all the more desperately. Finally, Xiang rose and said: "Hereafter, do not treat others with such disdain. Return to the monastery, and the monks will be able to descend from the forest." The monks returned, and it proved as he had said.

The next day, Xiang continued south. It was spring, and he saw a household with fine *song* greens. When he asked for some but was refused—and even met with harsh words—he told Yansou to fetch paper and brush. Zhiwei said: "To be denied greens is no matter for litigation. Besides, those in the Daoist path should not resort to curses." Xiang smiled: "I do not mean to litigate. I merely play a small trick." Yansou presented the paper and brush, and Xiang drew a white egret. Sprinkling it with water, he sent it flying into the vegetable patch, where it pecked at the greens. The owner rushed to shoo it away, but the egret would fly up only to land again, repeating this several times. Xiang then drew a badger, which chased the egret, trampling the greens until they were utterly destroyed. Seeing the Daoist’s mischief, the owner—fearing further sorcery—came to plead for mercy. Xiang said: "I did not truly want the greens. It was only a jest." He then called the egret and badger, which flew and scurried into his sleeve. The greens remained unharmed, as if nothing had happened.

Later, Xiang traveled south to Huotong Mountain and entered Changxi County. That night, he sought lodging at an inn, but the rooms were few and travelers many. The innkeeper jested: "If you Daoists can sleep on the wall, I’ll make room for you." As dusk fell, Zhiwei and Yansou said: "We’ll take any lodging—even if we must sleep on the wall." Xiang replied: "You may sleep among the common travelers. I will sit until dawn." The others slept, but Xiang leapt onto a beam, dangling upside down by one foot. The innkeeper, rising in the night, saw him by candlelight and was astonished. Xiang said: "If I can sleep on a beam, what difficulty is a wall?" He then entered the wall and did not emerge for some time. The innkeeper prayed and apologized for a while before inviting Zhiwei and Yansou inside to sleep in a proper room. At dawn, he lingered, sighing with regret. Zhiwei and Yansou took their leave, and after traveling a few *li*, they found Xiang waiting by the roadside.

Returning from Huotong to the Tianbao Abbey east of Yongkang County, Xiang pointed to a great withered pine before the abbey and said: "This pine is over three thousand years old and will soon turn to stone." Later, it did indeed petrify. Suddenly, a great wind and thunder shook the mountain, and the stone pine toppled, breaking into several sections. Yang Fa, demoted from his post as military governor of Guangzhou to prefect of Weizhou, had a taste for the strange. Learning of this, he had two sections moved to the prefectural residence, then to the Nine Pines Courtyard of Longxing Temple. Each stood six or seven *chi* tall, over three *chi* in girth. The stone bore the pine’s bark and scales, and it remains there to this day.

When someone came to report an illness, Xiang used no medicine but struck the afflicted area—whether on the abdomen or elsewhere—with his bamboo staff. For all ailments, he would apply the staff, then blow upon its tip, producing a sound like rolling thunder, and the patient would recover. One man, bent at the waist and crooked in the legs, arrived leaning on a cane; Xiang struck him with his staff, bidding him cast aside his cane, and at once the man’s limbs straightened. Though some offered him wealth and silk, he would refuse, yet if pressed, he would accept and later distribute it among the poor.

Wherever he traveled—whether to temples, abbeys, or mountain caves—he often left poems inscribed. One, composed upon ascending Hangzhou’s Mount Qinwang, reads:

*Where to seek the first division of the Great One?*
*Only the reckoning of time alters the human heart.*
*Sun and moon of the nine heavens shift dawn and dusk;*
*Rivers and mountains of ten thousand li exchange old and new.*
*The wind stirs the water’s light, swallowing distant peaks;*
*Rain swells the mist, drowning towering forests.*
*Qin’s emperor vainly schemed to drive the mountains—*
*The boundless sea grows only deeper with the turning years.*

Later, he returned to his hometown to visit his elder brother, but the brother was away. His sister-in-law and nephews rejoiced at his return. Xiang told them, “I share this house with my brother. Now that I’ve come back, I claim my portion—only the eastern garden for myself.” His kin found this strange, saying, “Uncle, you’ve been gone so long, and your brother hasn’t even seen you. How can you speak of dividing the land? Surely no one of flesh and blood would be so unfeeling.” He stayed three days, to their growing unease. He ate nothing, drinking only wine, and waited for his brother’s return. When night fell, he suddenly passed away.

The next day, his brother returned and questioned his wife and children, who told him all that had occurred. Grief-stricken, his brother said, “My brother studied the Dao for many years. He did not return to claim a share of the house, but to entrust his transformation to me, cutting off all longing.” They prepared his coffin. That night, a sound arose from within it, startling the household. He was buried in the eastern garden, nine *li* north of the county—a place now called Horse’s Tomb. This took place in the tenth year of Dazhong during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang.

The following year, a report came from Dongchuan: in Zitong County of Jianzhou, the Daoist Ma Ziran had ascended to heaven in broad daylight.

Xiang of Dongchuan said to others: “I am a native of Yanzhou County. Recently, I underwent transformation in the west of Zhejiang, and now I have been summoned by the Jade Emperor to ascend from here.” When this was reported, an imperial edict ordered the Zhexi Circuit to investigate. They opened his tomb and found in the coffin only a bamboo staff.

Wu Tongwei
Wu Tongwei’s origins are unknown. He was a Daoist whose spirit was pure and bearing serene, ever tranquil and unassuming. Sometimes he would chant verses, sometimes drink to intoxication, often wandering among the famous mountains of Hongzhou. Though people had seen him for many years, if he vanished for a decade or more, upon his return his appearance would be even younger than before. None could fathom what elixirs he refined, where he roamed, or when he rested. Later, atop a wineshop, he ascended in flight while drunk.

Xu Cuo
Xu Cuo claimed to be from Gaoyang. In his youth, he sat for the imperial examinations but repeatedly failed. In later years, he studied the Dao on Mount Wangwu, traveling among the Five Peaks and the renowned grotto-heavens. Later, he journeyed from Mount Emei, passing through the two capitals, then from Kefu, Bian, Song, and on to Jianghuai—visiting Maoshan, Tiantai, Siming, Xiandu, Weiyu, Wuyi, Huotong, and Luofu, leaving no place unvisited. Wherever he went, he inscribed upon sheer cliffs and precipices—places no man could reach—these words: “Xu Cuo, seeking Master Crescent Moon, has come here from Mount Emei.” Those who saw his brushstrokes marveled at their uncanniness, though none could identify Master Crescent Moon.

Later, he often wandered on Mount Lu, and once, drunk, he sang:
*Before the gardens of the Jasper Court lies the land of drunkenness,*
*Where the Queen Mother toasts with nine rosy goblets.*
*The immortals point and scorn my frivolity,*
*Exiling me to the mortal world as a wine-mad fool.*

When curious onlookers questioned him, he replied: “I am a celestial immortal, just now feasting on Kunlun. I was banished for a lapse in decorum.” People laughed, dismissing him as a madman. Later, on a spring day, he adorned his head with flowers and danced with blossoms in hand. He climbed a wineshop, sang while drunk, and ascended upon the clouds.

Jin Keji

Jin Keji was a man of Silla who, during the reign of Emperor Xuānzong of Tang, was honored in the court for his literary talents. By nature serene and devoted to the Dao, he disdained extravagance and ostentation. At times, he practiced qi refinement and bodily cultivation, finding joy in such pursuits. Broad in learning and retentive of memory, his compositions were elegant and refined. His bearing was graceful, and his speech and conduct bore the unmistakable air of a scholar of the Central Kingdom. Shortly after passing the imperial examinations, he declined official appointment and withdrew to Zǐwǔ Valley in the Zhongnan Mountains, where he built a humble dwelling and embraced a life of reclusion. He planted a great many rare flowers and exotic fruits with his own hands. Often, he would burn incense and sit in quiet meditation; whenever thoughts arose, he would recite without cease the *Dao and Virtue* and various scriptures of the immortals.

After three years, he longed to return to his homeland and departed by sea. Later, he came again, clad in Daoist robes, and reentered the Zhongnan Mountains, where he devoted himself to performing hidden acts of virtue. Whatever people sought of him, he never refused, and his diligence in all matters was unmatched. In the twelfth month of the eleventh year of Dazhong, he submitted a memorial stating: “Your servant has received a decree from the Jade Emperor, appointing him as Attendant Gentleman of the English Terrace. On the fifteenth day of the second month of next year, he shall ascend to the heavens.” At the time, Emperor Xuānzong found this extraordinary and dispatched an imperial envoy to summon him to court, but he firmly declined. When asked to produce the Jade Emperor’s decree, he demurred, saying it was held by another immortal and not left in the mortal realm.

The emperor then bestowed upon him four palace ladies, fragrant medicines, gold, and silks. He also dispatched two imperial envoys to attend him exclusively, yet he insisted on residing alone in a quiet chamber, allowing neither the palace ladies nor the envoys to approach. Each night, voices of conversation and laughter could be heard from within his room. The envoys, peering secretly, saw only immortal officials and maidens seated upon dragon and phoenix thrones, facing one another with solemn dignity. Attendants and guards stood in great number, yet the palace ladies and envoys dared not disturb them. On the fifteenth day of the second month, as spring blossomed in radiant beauty and flowers shone in full splendor, five-colored clouds, crying cranes, soaring simurghs, and white swans appeared, accompanied by the music of reed pipes, stone chimes, feathered canopies, and jade carriages. Banners and pennants filled the sky as they bore him away to ascend to heaven. The court officials and common folk who gathered to witness the spectacle filled the mountains and valleys, all gazing in reverence and marveling in awe.

**Song Xuanbai**
Song Xuanbai’s origins are unknown. A Daoist adept, he stood over seven feet tall, with brows and eyes like a painting, his bearing refined, handsome, plump, and fair. His speech was elegant, and all who saw him cherished him. Possessing profound arts of the Dao, he wore cotton in summer and a single layer in winter, yet when standing in snow, steam-like qi would emanate in a circle more than a *zhang* around him, preventing the snow from settling. With a point of his finger, lamps would extinguish, and people would feel as though swept by a draft, rustling faintly. When he gestured toward flowers and grasses in the courtyard, they would sway as if stirred by wind.

He wandered among famous mountains, emerging from Mao Mountain to reside at the Xixuan Abbey in Runzhou, then entering the Kuocang Grotto, where he practiced grain avoidance and qi absorption. At times, he would consume five *jin* of fatty meat, devour a whole basin of garlic, then drink two *dou* of wine with a single white plum. Those who obtained and ate a piece of his garlic claimed it left no garlicky odor but instead an exotic fragrance lingering on their teeth and tongue all day, never fading. Many who ate it lived long, healthy lives, reaching eighty or ninety years of age.

Wherever Xuanbai stayed, he would use gold and silk to acquire two or three beautiful concubines, only to abandon them when he departed. People speculated that he had mastered the arts of "supplementing the brain and restoring primordial qi" through the "Three Peaks" method of bedroom cultivation—practices unworthy of a true immortal. Yet if Xuanbai had indeed ascended as an immortal, why did he keep concubines? This only deepened their doubts. However, it was clear he did not practice the "bedroom arts." Perhaps his intent was to blend with the world and conceal his true nature, leaving others uncertain of his immortality.

Later, he traveled to Yuezhou during a severe drought. The local authorities were performing music and dragon dances to pray for rain, but after ten days, the scorching heat only worsened. Xuanbai, observing this, remarked that rain could only be summoned by aligning with the Mandate of Heaven, not through mere petitions. He then burned incense at his abode and offered prayers, and by nightfall, a great thunderstorm brought ample rain, astonishing the people of Yue.

Later still, he arrived in Xinzhou, where another drought had prompted prayers for rain. A Daoist adept, knowing of Xuanbai’s ability to summon rain, was invited by the locals. He swiftly performed his arts, driving a flying nail into the eyes of the city god. The prefect, Wei Delin, falsely accused him of harboring women and drove another nail into the city god. Declaring Xuanbai a demonic trickster, Wei ordered his subordinates to seize and punish him. Yet as they approached, their limbs stiffened, and they collapsed to the ground, their willow-wood shackles snapping apart. Xuanbai laughed and said to Wei, “Sir, are you acting like Liu Gen, seeking to punish the ancestral *mi*?” Terrified, Wei begged forgiveness and soon after sent him off with courtesy. His numinous wonders were tested time and again, too numerous to record in full.

Later, in Nancheng County of Fuzhou—now under the jurisdiction of Jianchang Prefecture—he ascended to the heavens in broad daylight.

He Zizhen
He Zizhen’s origins were unknown. A Daoist adept, he dwelled on Mount Song. Cultured and refined, he conducted himself with lofty antiquity, ever diligent in his austerities and meditations. Though young in appearance, none could determine his age; yet among both Daoists and layfolk, it was widely said that he had been seen for many years, though none knew the nature of his practice. One day, clouds of cranes filled the sky, their cries and music clear and resonant, as Zizhen suddenly ascended in flight. At the time, the scholar-recluse Chen Tao was in the eastern capital and witnessed the people of Luoyang gazing in awe and reverence. Overcome with wonder, he composed a poem:

"Like Zǐjìn’s phoenix-flight o’er ancient Luò’s streams,
Golden peaches ripen anew for Lord Hè’s ascent.
Triple Clarity’s music swells beneath Sōng’s peaks,
Five-hued clouds gather before the imperial gardens.
Crimson-crested dancers whirl to greet the scarlet staff,
Blue-maned singers pause beside the perfumed carriage.
Who now weeps in daylight’s sorrow?
How many myriad years stretch through the Supreme Pole’s light?"

Deng Qushe

Deng Qushe was a native of Longqiu in Quzhou, dwelling at the foot of Nine Peaks Mountain. From youth he entered the Dao, traveling to study its arts, his concentrated thought never flagging in weariness. At over thirty years of age, he took residence at Anhe Abbey in Songyang County of Chuzhou, the very place where Ye Jingneng had once studied the Dao in his native village. Five *li* north of the abbey rose Mao Mountain, towering over fifty *zhang* in height. Tradition held that Celestial Master Zhang and Ye Jingneng had both dwelt upon this mountain to cultivate the Dao. Inspired by their precedent, Qushe ascended the peak and built a thatched hut to live in.

Later, the abbey’s Daoists followed him to dwell at the mountain’s base, where people constructed houses, halls, and temples. There they enshrined images of Lord Lao, Celestial Master Zhang, and the true portrait of Ye Jingneng, burning incense and performing rites morning and evening. To the mountain’s southeast lay a square stone, over two *zhang* in width, flat as a whetstone—formed by nature itself. Qushe often sat upon it, hands clasped in silent meditation.

One day, a spirit appeared to him, saying: “Celestial Master Zhang’s two demon-slaying swords and a jar of elixir lie buried beneath this stone. You may retrieve them.” Qushe bowed to the spirit and replied: “This stone is of heaven; no human effort could alter it. I am but a humble, deluded man who guards the truth—content to dwell here in peace, long sheltered by sacred protection. How could I presume to take the elixir and swords?”

The spirit said: “Simply cultivate diligently without slackening, and the swords and elixir will come to you of their own accord.” Three years later, the spirit delivered the swords and elixir to Qushe. The swords were Celestial Master Zhang’s Seven-Star Swords, while the elixir was stored in a stone casket, sealed in a jar. When poured, the medicine filled over a *dou*, resembling sesame seeds in size, crimson in color, and radiant with light. Qushe consumed some himself and distributed the rest to others, and all were cured.

At that time, Hua Zao of Lishui County, in the wake of the famine and chaos of the Zhonghe era, gathered local people to fortify a crag and defend it.

The military governor of eastern Zhejiang reported the matter to the court, where it was debated that the troops should be withdrawn. Hua Zao was thus appointed prefect. Yet Zao, treacherous and ruthless, had heard of Qushe’s divine swords and elixir. He surrounded the mountain with soldiers, seized Qushe along with the swords and elixir, and brought them to the prefectural seat. There, he confiscated the swords and elixir and imprisoned Qushe in an airless cell. It was the height of summer, and for a full month, no water was given to him. Zao assumed Qushe must have perished, but when the cell was opened, his countenance remained solemn, his complexion rosy and fair—even more radiant than before. Astonished, Zao sent Qushe back to the mountain but kept the swords and elixir. That very night, a storm of wind and thunder roared through the sky, and they vanished without a trace. Qushe later said the swords had returned to their place beneath the stone.

For over fifteen years thereafter, Qushe dwelled on the mountain. He often spoke of seeing dragons, tigers, and strange birds moving through his courtyard. Daoist priests from Anhe Temple who lodged on the summit to perform rituals would witness these creatures nearby and marvel at the sight. Qushe had not eaten for many years; if anyone defiled the mountain, fierce beasts would appear in spring and winter to startle them, while in summer and autumn, venomous snakes would strike. Qushe also recounted that during thunderstorms, the clouds, dragons, thunder gods, lightning matrons, and countless spirits would gather halfway up the mountain, sometimes appearing before him with great courtesy.

Daoist priests who stayed overnight would hear voices as if Qushe were conversing with others in his quiet chamber. Peering in, they detected only a room suffused with strange fragrance and the sound of jade pendants. At times, they saw four figures seated facing one another—men and women wearing distant-travel caps, crimson robes, coiled topknots, and flowing green silk garments—while jade boys and jade maidens stood in attendance, their bodies aglow. Other divine beings stood at a distance. The priests dared not disturb them, offering only reverence.

One day, Qushe told the priests: “I fear I must soon leave this mountain and may not see you for long.” Several days later, a procession of colored clouds and phoenixes filled the sky with music, hovering above the summit. A palanquin adorned with banners and canopies arrived, borne by spirit officials riding dragons and five-colored deer, some mounted on phoenixes. They came to escort Qushe as he ascended to heaven, witnessed by a great crowd of Daoists and laypeople below.

**Lan Caihe**
Lan Caihe’s origins are unknown.

Lan Caihe was ever clad in a tattered indigo robe, wooden clogs bound with six black straps, and a belt over three inches wide. One foot shod, the other bare, they walked with a halting gait. In summer, they lined their robe with padding; in winter, they lay in the snow, their breath rising like steam. Wherever they went, they sang through the streets, begging for alms. In hand they carried a large clapper, over three feet long. Often drunk, they danced and sang, drawing crowds of old and young alike. Quick-witted and full of jest, they would banter with passersby, their replies so apt that all who heard would collapse in laughter. Though seeming mad, they were not mad. As they walked, they would shake their shoes and sing:

*Dance, dance the song—*
*Lan Caihe!*
*How long can this world last?*
*Youth is a tree in spring bloom,*
*Light a shuttle cast.*
*The ancients, lost in the great flow, never return;*
*Today’s multitudes press on, ever more.*
*At dawn, riding simurghs and phoenixes to the azure vault;*
*At dusk, watching mulberry fields turn to white waves.*
*Bright radiance lingers in the empty sky,*
*Where golden and silver palaces rise, towering and steep.*

Their songs, though often improvised, were imbued with the spirit of immortals—none could fathom their meaning. When given coins, they would string them together and drag them along, or let them scatter, never glancing back. If they saw the poor, they would give freely; if they met a tavern, they would share their alms with the wine-seller.

Wandering the world, there were those who had seen them as children, and upon meeting them again with hair turned gray, found their appearance unchanged. Later, they danced and sang between the beams of the Huai River, and while drunk in a tavern’s upper story, a sound of cloud-cranes, reed pipes, and flutes arose. Suddenly, they rose lightly into the air, casting down their hanfu robe, sash, and clappers into the clouds before drifting away. The robe and other items soon vanished as well.

Zhang Guo
Zhang Guo concealed himself on Mount Tiao in Hengzhou, traveling between Fen and Jin. People of the time spoke of his secret to longevity, and elders who had seen him as children claimed he was already several hundred years old. He often rode a white donkey, covering tens of thousands of li in a day. When resting, he would fold it up—its thickness like paper—and store it in his headscarf box. When he wished to ride again, he would sprinkle water on it, and it would once more become a donkey.

Emperor Taizong and Emperor Gaozong of Tang summoned him, but he did not rise. Empress Wu Zetian called him forth from the mountains, and he feigned death before the shrine of Tuo Nu. It was midsummer, and soon his corpse rotted and teemed with maggots, so the empress believed he was truly dead. (Another account says he later concealed himself in Fengzhou, dwelling on Mount Douji in summer and Mount Jingnu in winter.) Emperor Minghuang invited him, but he did not come. Later, someone saw him again in the mountains of Hengzhou.

In the twenty-third year of the Kaiyuan era, Emperor Minghuang dispatched the Court Messenger Pei Wu to Hengzhou by post-horse to welcome him. Upon meeting Wu, Guo indeed appeared before him—then ceased breathing and died. Wu thereupon burned incense and proclaimed the Son of Heaven’s desire to invite him on a journey. After a brief moment, Guo gradually revived. Fearing to press further, Wu hastened back to report.

The emperor then commanded the Drafter of Imperial Decrees Xu Jiao and Court Messenger Lu Chongxuan to present Guo with an invitation bearing the imperial seal. Guo accompanied Jiao to the Eastern Capital. As Emperor Minghuang was traveling to the hot springs and had arrived at Luoyang, Guo was lodged in the Jixian Institute. Carried into the palace by sedan chair, he was treated with utmost reverence, and all the high ministers came to pay their respects. When the emperor inquired about the arts of immortality, Guo did not answer. He was skilled in breath-holding and could go for days without food, though he drank wine several times a day. When the emperor offered him wine, Guo declined, saying, “This humble servant cannot drink more than two *sheng*. I have a disciple, however, who can drink one *dou*.”

Delighted by this, the emperor ordered the disciple summoned. In an instant, a young Daoist descended from the palace eaves, appearing sixteen or seventeen years old, with a handsome countenance and refined, elegant demeanor. He paid his respects to the emperor with clear, crisp speech and impeccable manners. When the emperor commanded him to sit, Guo said, “My disciple should stand in attendance at my side; he cannot be granted a seat.” The emperor was even more pleased. He offered the disciple wine, who drank a full *dou* without becoming drunk. Guo then entreated, “Do not offer him more. Excess will lead to some mishap, if only to amuse Your Majesty.” The emperor pressed him further, and suddenly wine gushed from the disciple’s crown, his cap falling to the ground and transforming into a comb-cover. The emperor and his consorts all gasped and laughed in astonishment. When they looked again, the young Daoist had vanished—only a golden comb remained on the ground. When they lifted the cover, it held exactly one *dou* of wine. Upon verification, it proved to be a comb from the Jixian Institute. Guo’s immortal arts were tested repeatedly, yet their depths could not be fathomed.

Guo once remarked, “I was born in the *bingzi* year of Emperor Yao and held the position of *Shizhong*.” His appearance suggested a man of sixty or seventy. There was Xing Hepu, who could discern a person’s lifespan, and Shuai Yeguang, who could see ghosts. The emperor ordered Hepu to divine Guo’s longevity, but Hepu was utterly baffled. Secretly, he sent Yeguang to observe him, yet Yeguang could not perceive Guo’s whereabouts.

The emperor said to Gao Lishi, “I have heard that one who drinks wormwood wine without bitterness is an extraordinary man.” As the weather was cold, he took some and offered it to Guo, who drank three cups and then frowned, saying, “This is not fine wine.” He then lay down, and upon closer inspection, one of his teeth appeared scorched and shrunken. Turning to his attendants, he took an iron *ruyi* and struck the tooth, knocking it out and tucking it into his sash. He then produced a medicine and applied it to the gap. After a while, the tooth regrew, straight and gleaming white.

When the emperor hunted in Xianyang, he captured a large deer and ordered the royal chefs to prepare it. Guo said, “This is a celestial deer, already a thousand years old. In the fifth year of *Yuanshou* during the reign of Emperor Wu of Han, I once accompanied him on a hunt in the Shanglin Park, where we caught this deer—and released it.” The emperor said, “There are many deer. Over the long passage of time, how could it not have been taken by hunters?” Guo replied, “When Emperor Wu released it, he marked it with a bronze plaque beneath its left antler.” The emperor ordered it checked, and indeed, a bronze plaque about two *cun* long was found, though the inscription was worn and faint.

The emperor asked, “What was the *jiazi* year of *Yuanshou*? How many years have passed since then?” Guo answered, “That year was *guihai*. Emperor Wu had just begun excavating the Kunming Pool. Now, in the *jiaxu* year, eight hundred and fifty-two years have passed.” The emperor commanded the Grand Historian to verify the calendar, and it proved nearly without discrepancy.

The emperor then asked Ye Fashan, “What manner of man is Guo?”

Guo answered, “I know, yet if I speak, I shall die. Now I dare not speak. If Your Majesty would remove your crown and bare your feet to save me, then I may live.” The emperor consented.

Ye Fashan said, “At the primal division of *hun-tun*, he was the essence of the white bat.” As the words left his mouth, blood flowed from his seven orifices, and he collapsed to the ground. The emperor hastened to Guo’s side, removed his crown, bared his feet, and confessed his fault.

Guo slowly said, “This child speaks too freely. If I do not chastise him, the secrets of Heaven and Earth may be revealed.” The emperor grieved and pondered for a long while. Guo then sprinkled water on Ye’s face, and he revived at once. The emperor marveled at him all the more and issued an edict to have his portrait painted and displayed in the Jixian Institute.

The edict read: “The Master Zhang Guo of Hengzhou wanders beyond the bounds of the world. His spirit soars to lofty heights, his heart enters the distant and obscure. He merges with the radiance of dust, answering the summons to court. None know the count of his years; some say he is a man of the age of Fuxi. Question him on the pivot of the Dao, and he exhausts the ultimate principles. Now, as he prepares to observe court ritual, We elevate him with honor and appointment. Let him be granted the title of *Yinqing Guanglu Daifu* and styled Master of Penetrating the Mysterious.”

Guo repeatedly pleaded old age and illness, begging to return to Hengzhou. The emperor bestowed three hundred bolts of silk upon him, along with two disciples to accompany him, and provided post horses for their journey to Huan Prefecture. One disciple was sent back, while the other followed him into the mountains.

At the beginning of the *Tianbao* era, Emperor Minghuang sent envoys to summon Guo again. They found he had already died, and his disciples buried him. Later, when the tomb was opened, only an empty coffin remained. The emperor had the Qixia Abbey built in his honor.

Minister Dao Yi said: “Zhang Guo transcended the mortal to attain the sagely. He could sit and vanish at will, his transformations boundless, his virtue and power pure. Observing how he left his form in the world, he was no different from Guangchengzi or Qian Keng. Those who attain the immortals are not easily matched.”

The *Daode Jing* says: “In governing people and serving Heaven, nothing surpasses frugality. Only through frugality can one be said to serve early. To serve early is to accumulate virtue heavily. With heavy accumulation of virtue, there is nothing one cannot overcome. With nothing one cannot overcome, none can fathom one’s limits. With none able to fathom one’s limits, one may possess the state. Possessing the state’s mother, one may endure long. This is called having deep roots and a firm stem—the Dao of long life and enduring vision.” Such was Zhang Guo.

Xu Xuanping.

Xu Xuanping was a native of She in Xin’an. During the Jingyun era of Emperor Ruizong’s reign in the Tang, he secluded himself in the southern valley of Chengyang Mountain, where he built a thatched hut to dwell in. Though no one knew what he consumed, he was seen to eat nothing. His complexion resembled that of a man in his forties, and he moved with such lightness and agility that he could outrun a galloping horse. At times, he would carry firewood to sell, his load always bearing a gourd and a crooked bamboo staff. When drunk, he would stagger homeward, chanting:

*With firewood at dawn I set out to sell,*
*To buy wine and return as the sun dips low.*
*None ask of me—*
*Through clouds I vanish into emerald peaks.*

For over thirty years, he aided those in peril or distress. Many in the city sought him, but he was never seen; they found only poems inscribed on the walls of his hut:

*For thirty years I’ve dwelt in seclusion,*
*My hut built high on the southern mountain’s crest.*
*At still night I dine beneath the bright moon,*
*At leisure morn I drink from the jade spring.*
*Woodcutters sing on the slopes,*
*Valley birds play before the cliffs.*
*Joyful, I forget age,*
*And all reckoning of years.*

Those fond of such matters often recited his verses. Some who traveled to Chang’an left them inscribed at post stations along the road to Luoyang and Tonghua. During the Tianbao era of Emperor Minghuang’s reign, Li Bai, having left the Hanlin Academy, journeyed through these stations. Upon reading the poem, he sighed, “This is the work of an immortal.” Inquiring among the locals, he learned of Xuanping’s story. Li Bai then traveled to Xin’an, crossing streams and climbing mountains in search of him, but never found him. He left a poem on the hut’s wall:

*I chanted the poem from the post station,*
*And came to seek the immortal’s abode.*
*Misty ridges obscure the heights,*
*Clouded forests veil the vast void.*
*Peering in, I find only desolation;*
*Leaning on my staff, I stand in vain.*
*He must have transformed into a crane soaring beyond the skies,*
*And will return only after a thousand years.*

When Xuanping returned to his hut and saw the poem on the wall, he chanted in reply:

*A pond of lotus leaves—endless robes,*
*Two acres of yellow essence—abundant fare.*
*Again, men come seeking me,*
*So I must move my hut deeper into the wilds.*

Later, his hut was burned by a wildfire, and no trace of Xuanping was ever found. Over a hundred years later, in the twelfth year of Emperor Yizong’s Xiantong era, a servant of the local man Xu Mingru accompanied others into the mountains to gather firewood. One day, she came upon a man sitting on a rock, eating an exceptionally large peach. He asked her, “Are you from Xu Mingru’s household?” She replied, “Yes.” The man said, “I am Xu Mingru’s ancestor, Xuanping.” The servant said, “I have often heard my family speak of my ancestor’s attainment of immortality, but we had no way to seek him.” Xuanping told her, “Return and tell Mingru that I dwell in these mountains. Give him this peach to eat, but do not take it out of the mountains—tigers and wolves abound here, and the mountain spirit cherishes this peach.” The servant ate it, finding it delicious, and soon finished it. She was sent back with the woodcutters to relay the encounter. Upon returning, she felt her load of firewood light and nimble. At home, she recounted meeting her ancestor Xuanping in the mountains. Mingru, enraged that she had presumptuously invoked his ancestor’s name, took up a staff to strike her. As the staff fell, the servant’s body rose and vanished. Later, someone entering the mountains encountered her—her face youthful, her body light, clad in tree bark, moving swiftly as the wind. She then ascended into the treetops and disappeared.

The Daoist Xue Chang was a native of You and Ji. During the Tianbao era of the Tang, he resided at the Cavern Heaven Abbey on Mount Qingcheng in Shu. One day, he obtained wine made from *shanglu* (pokeweed) and drank it, causing blood to flow from his ears and nose until he died. After three days, he suddenly revived, his skin fair, his appearance instantly youthful, his body light, his eyes bright, as if he might take flight. Within days, he could perceive distant and near objects with clarity, seeing and hearing through mountains, forests, and cliffs as if nothing obstructed him. At the time, Emperor Xuanzong revered the supreme Dao, and the regional military governor invited Xue Chang to the guest quarters, intending to send him to the capital with a four-horse carriage. Suddenly, the master vanished. Some later claimed to have seen him on Mount Damian.

---

Wu Yun, styled Zhengjie, was a native of Huayin. Well-versed in the classics and skilled in literary composition, he sat for the imperial examinations but did not pass. Proud and unyielding, he could not conform to the times, so he left to dwell on Mount Yichang in Nanyang. At the beginning of Emperor Minghuang’s Tianbao era, he was summoned to the capital and registered as a Daoist. He entered Mount Song to study under Master Pan Zheng, then journeyed south to Mount Tiantai and observed the Eastern Sea. He delighted in the company of renowned scholars, and his writings circulated in the capital. Emperor Minghuang dispatched an envoy to summon him to the Datong Hall. Pleased with their conversation, the emperor ordered him to await imperial summons at the Hanlin Academy and presented *Three Treatises on the Mystical Framework*. When asked about the Dao, Wu Yun replied, “In seeking the Dao, nothing surpasses the *Five Thousand Words* of Laozi.” When asked about the methods of immortality and alchemy, he answered, “These are the pursuits of rustics, requiring years of effort—hardly matters for a sovereign to attend to.” In his discourses, Wu Yun often addressed the teachings of the age and subtly admonished the emperor, who held him in high regard. The Buddhist clergy, jealous of his favor, and Gao Lishi, who had long served the monks, together slandered him before the emperor. Wu Yun, sensing the realm’s impending disorder, requested to return to Mount Song, where the emperor ordered a residence built for him. Soon after, the An Lushan Rebellion erupted, and he traveled to Mount Mao, then eastward to Kuaiji and the Ke region.

Wu Yun composed treatises on the wonders of the Valley Spirit, such as *On the Mystical Framework*; on the remoteness of the Dao from worldly concerns, such as *On the Pursuit of Immortality*; on cleansing the heart and shedding worldly dust, such as *Rinsing the Heart* and *Dwelling in the Cliffs*; on cultivating sincerity within and resting in the lord of heaven, such as *On the Heart and Eyes* and *In Harmony with the Spirit*. His works also included *Roaming Immortals* and *Pacing the Void*, as well as poems on royal governance and miscellaneous reflections, totaling over four hundred and fifty pieces. The Vice Minister of Rites, Quan Deyu, compiled and prefaced them. Initially, Wu Yun was despised by Gao Lishi and banished, which led his writings to sharply criticize Buddhism. He admired the songs and poems of Kong Chaofu, ranking them among the finest. In the thirteenth year of Emperor Daizong’s Dali era, Wu Yun suddenly burned incense and departed this world at a Daoist abbey in Xuancheng. His disciple Shao Jiyuan and his followers buried him at the western foot of Mount Tianzhu, privately bestowing upon him the posthumous title *Master Zongyuan*.

Li Bai, styled Taibai, was a ninth-generation descendant of the Tang’s Sacred Emperor. His mother dreamed of the Longgeng star before conceiving him, and thus he was named. Born in the second year of Empress Wu Zetian’s Shengli era (699, *jihai*), he recited the *Six Jia* at five and mastered the *Book of Poetry* and *Book of Documents* by ten, studying the works of a hundred schools. Su Ting marveled at him, saying, “This child is a prodigy of heaven; with a little more learning, he may rival Sima Xiangru.”

At fifteen, he took up swordsmanship and roamed in search of immortals, often dwelling in the Min Mountains. He wandered amid rivers and mountains, composing verses as he went. Later, he ascended Mount Emei and journeyed through Jianghuai, visiting the Yunmeng Marsh. There, he married the granddaughter of Xu Yuan, a minister of the Tang court, and stayed in Yunmeng for three years. Fond of the arts of persuasion and knight-errantry, he wielded his sword, valued generosity, and scorned wealth.

Leaving for Qi and Lu, he sojourned in Rencheng, where he joined Kong Chaofu, Han Zhun, Pei Zheng, Zhang Shuming, and Tao Mian in dwelling on Mount Zulai, drinking deeply. They were known as the Six Idlers of Bamboo Creek. In the sixteenth year of Emperor Xuanzong’s Kaiyuan era (728), the emperor wrote in a letter to Pei Yaoqing: “His literary labors have been tireless for thirty springs now.”

In the third year of the Tianbao era (744, *jiashen*), Bai befriended Wu Yun, who was then serving as a drafter in the Hanlin Academy. Bai also traveled to Chang’an, where he met the Grand Tutor of the Heir Apparent, He Zhizhang, at the Purple Ultimate Palace. There, he removed his golden marten cap to exchange for wine in revelry. Zhizhang, upon reading his writings, exclaimed, “You are a banished immortal!” He recommended Bai to the emperor, who summoned him to the Golden Bells Hall. There, Bai discoursed on current affairs and presented an ode. The emperor, moved, personally ladled soup for him. Though appointed as a Hanlin Academician, Bai continued to drink with his boon companions in the marketplace.

One day, the emperor sat in the Agarwood Pavilion, inspired to compose music, and desired Bai to write lyrics. Summoned, Bai arrived drunk. His attendants splashed water on his face to rouse him, and he took up his brush, composing verses of exquisite beauty and precision without hesitation. The emperor cherished his talent. Once, while attending the emperor in his cups, Bai ordered Gao Lishi to remove his boots. Lishi, humiliated, seized upon his poems to incite Yang Guifei. Whenever the emperor sought to appoint Bai to office, the consort would obstruct it. Bai grew ever more unrestrained, joining He Zhizhang, Li Shizhi, Prince Rui of Suyang, Cui Zongzhi, Su Jin, Zhang Xu, and Jiao Sui as the Eight Immortals of Wine. He pleaded to return to the mountains, and the emperor granted him gold and dismissed him.

As he left the Golden Gate, he sought an audience with an imperial censor but failed to find him. Thereupon, he composed a poem on the parrot: *“Shedding feathers, it departs the golden hall, / Crying out, it scolds the brocade-robed one. / Though it could speak, it was cast aside, / And now flies back to the mountains of Long.”* He then visited his distant cousin, Li Yenyun, the Investigating Censor of Chenliu, and requested the High Master of Beihai to initiate him into the registers of Daoist ordination. After receiving the transmission, he returned to Beihai.

From there, he traveled through Zhao, Wei, Yan, Jin, Qi, and Shang, lingering longest in Luoyang and Liang. He revisited Qi and Lu, the Huai and Si rivers, entered Wu again, and wandered to Jinling, ascending Qiupu and Xunyang, leaving poems and prose wherever he went, though the dates are unrecorded.

Bai roamed the four directions. Once, he boarded a boat with Cui Zongzhi from Caishi to Jinling, wearing a brocade robe of the imperial court. Seated in the boat, he appeared as if no one else were present. Another time, he traveled to Mount Hua and passed through a county seat. The magistrate was just opening the gate to attend to official business when Bai, drunk, rode his donkey through the gate. The magistrate, enraged and unaware of his identity, dragged him to the courtyard and demanded, “Who are you, to dare such rudeness?” Bai requested paper to write a statement, declaring: *“I have wiped spittle with the dragon’s kerchief, had soup stirred by the imperial hand, held the inkstone for the noble consort, and had my boots removed by Gao Lishi. Before the gates of the Son of Heaven, I was still permitted to gallop my horse—how can the precincts of Huayin County forbid me to ride my donkey?”* The magistrate, startled, rose to bow in apology, saying, “I did not realize the Hanlin Academician had come here.” Bai mounted his donkey and departed.

In the fourteenth year of the Tianbao era (755), An Lushan rebelled. Prince Yong of Lin marched east, and Bai, taking refuge on Mount Lu, was coerced into joining him. When Prince Yong’s forces were defeated and he was executed, Bai was implicated. Guo Ziyi pleaded to resign his office to atone for Bai’s crime, and thus Bai was exiled to Yelang. This occurred in the first year of Emperor Suzong’s Qianyuan era (758). Earlier, Bai had written in a poem: *“At midnight, the naval forces arrived, / Yuzhang filled with banners. / An empty name led me astray, / Forced aboard the towering ship. / Granted five hundred gold, / I cast it away like floating smoke. / Refusing office and reward, / I was instead exiled to the heavens of Yelang.”* Midway through his journey, he received a pardon and was allowed to return. He ascended Mount Wu and descended the Qutang Gorge. Later, he passed through Jiangxia, Xunyang, Jinling, Liyang, and Xuancheng, leaving poems in both commanderies, though the details are no longer traceable.

Bai’s lifelong aspiration was to become an immortal, and his studies followed the teachings of Laozi. He once wrote in an ancient-style poem on Daoist learning: *“How vast and blue is Mount Tai, / Where stars array in lofty ranks. / Three hundred leagues from heaven, / Remote and severed from the world. / Within, a green-haired elder, / Clad in clouds and pine-snow. / Neither laughing nor speaking, / Truly dwelling in a rocky cave. / I came to ask the perfected one, / Kneeling long to seek the precious formula. / Suddenly, he laughed to himself, / And taught me the art of refining elixirs. / I engraved his words upon my bones, / Refining my body until it vanished like lightning. / Gazing up, I could not reach him, / My five emotions burning with sorrow. / I shall cultivate cinnabar, / And forever part from the world of men.”*

In another poem, he wrote: *“Five cranes came from the northwest, / Soaring and soaring into the Great Clarity. / An immortal upon green clouds, / Claiming to be Anqi Sheng. / Two jade lads in pairs, / Blowing purple phoenix flutes. / Floating down in inverted reflection, / Swiftly leaving no trace. / They left me golden radiance herbs, / Which, when consumed, made my limbs light. / I shall follow Red Pine, / Playing chess upon Penglai.”*

In the eleventh month of the first year of the Baoying era, he departed from Jinling to Caishi to visit his clansman Li Yangbing. There, he seized the moon and plunged into the waters, ending his life—people called it a "water liberation." He was sixty-four years old.

When Emperor Daizong ascended the throne, he summoned Li Bai to the post of *Shiyi*, but the poet had already dissolved into transformation. The *Collected Works of Li Taibai of the Tang* circulates in the world. Its preface states:

Li Bai, styled Taibai, was a native of Chengji in Longxi and a ninth-generation descendant of Emperor Wu of Liang’s clan. His family, long distinguished by official seals and girdle ornaments, had been illustrious for generations. In middle antiquity, however, they were unjustly exiled to Tiaozhi, where they changed their surname and given name. From the impoverished cicada to Shun, five generations remained commoners, their luster dimmed for ages—a lamentable fate.

At the dawn of the Shenlong era, he fled back to Shu. There, pointing to a plum tree, his mother gave birth to Boyang. On the night of his conception, the Star of Venus entered her dream, so he was named *Bai* ("White") and styled *Taibai* ("Great White"). His essence was indeed that of the planet.

He scorned books not of the sages and disdained the compositions of Zheng and Wei. Thus, his words often resembled the speech of celestial immortals. All his writings brimmed with admonition and inspiration. Since the Three Dynasties, after the *Feng* and *Sao*, he galloped past Qu and Song, lashed Yang and Ma, and stood alone for a thousand years—none but he.

Thus, princes and lords hastened to follow his wind; mountains and rivers aligned their paths. Scholars gathered like birds flocking to the phoenix. Lu, the Minister of the Yellow Gate, said: “Chen Shiyi stemmed the tide of decay, and the literary world transformed as one. Even now, court poetry retains the style of the Liang and Chen palace chambers. But with Li Bai’s great transformation, all was swept away. Ancient and modern anthologies fell silent, while his works spread across the Six Directions—truly, his power rivaled creation itself.”

During the Tianbao era, the imperial ancestor issued an edict summoning him to the Golden Horse Gate. The emperor alighted from his carriage to welcome him on foot, as if meeting Qi and Hao. He bestowed a seven-jeweled tray for his meal, personally ladled broth to feed him, and said: “You are a commoner, yet your name is known to me. Without long-cultivated Dao and virtue, how could you have reached this?”

He was installed in the Golden Bells Hall, moving in and out of the Hanlin Academy. The emperor consulted him on state affairs, and he secretly drafted edicts. Yet petty officials, envious of his talent, slandered him. His enlightened counsel went unheeded, and the emperor grew distant.

Thus, Li Bai roamed near and far, drowning himself in wine to cloud his senses. In his songs, he often invoked Mount Shu. With He Zhizhang, Cui Zongzhi, and others, he formed the "Eight Immortals of the Wine Cup." They called him the "Banished Immortal," and court officials composed hundreds of *Songs of the Banished Immortal*, most lamenting his unfulfilled aspirations.

The emperor, knowing he could not be retained, bestowed gold and sent him away. He then sought his distant cousin, Chenliu’s Investigating Censor Yan Yun, and requested the High Celestial Master Gao of Beihai to confer the Daoist registers at the Purple Ultimate Palace in Qizhou. He prepared to return to Penglai, become a feathered immortal, ride to Red Pine, and test his zither and songs. Yet in Dangtu, his heart found no joy.

“Though I am unworthy,” he said, “the Master has not abandoned me.” They shared a small boat in delight. As he neared retirement, Li Bai hastily compiled a hundred scrolls on herbs, leaving his work unfinished. On his deathbed, he entrusted the manuscripts to me, bidding me write a preface.

Discussing the *Book of Changes*, I am shamed before Bu Shang; expounding the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, I pale beside Du Yu. Since the Central Plains fell into turmoil, I have taken refuge for eight years. Of my writings from that time, nine-tenths are lost. What remains has been gathered from others.

This was written on the *jiyou* day of the eleventh month, the first year of the Baoying era.

In the early years of Emperor Xianzong’s Yuanhe era, a man at sea witnessed Li Taibai conversing and laughing with a Daoist atop a high mountain. After some time, the Daoist rode a crimson rainbow through the emerald mist and departed. Taibai leapt up, strode vigorously, and caught up with him, mounting the rainbow together and vanishing.

Later, Li Guinian arrived at Mount Song. From afar, he saw the eastern cliffs draped in ancient trees, their canopies like curtains stretching to the ground. As he approached, tables laden with vessels and offerings came into view. A man stepped forward and said, “Li Hanlin summons you.” Guinian hastened forward, whereupon the man—robed in flowing garments, his complexion radiant and hair lustrous—declared, “I am Li Bai. Your ancestor was Bai Juyi. Though we lived in different eras, we were men of the same age. Our Dao being the same, we now commune across time. Since my release from the waters, I have wandered freely among mountains and rivers, but longing for my homeland drew me back to the peaks of Song. The Celestial Emperor submitted a memorial on my behalf, and I was summoned here to oversee memorials and petitions—a century has passed. Recently, I passed through Tong Pass and composed a lyric:

*Once in the peach-blossom caves so deep,*
*A phoenix danced to a song divine.*
*Still I recall the parting hour,*
*Moonlight and fallen blooms, the mist so fine—*
*Like a dream, like a dream.*

With tears, I saw you off at the gate.”

Guinian asked, “Where is my ancestor now?”
“He resides on Mount Wutai, overseeing merit and virtue—fulfilling his long-held aspiration.”

The man then presented Guinian with a scroll, saying, “Read this, and you may discern the speech of the nine heavens’ birds and the earth’s beasts. Cultivate further merits, and you too may attain immortality.”

Later, Guinian traveled to Youzhou. The prefect, learning of his extraordinary arts, summoned him for inquiry. As two sparrows chirped past the courtyard, the prefect asked, “What do they say?”
Guinian replied, “They speak of grain left uncovered west of the city—they feast upon it.”
The prefect sent men to verify, and it was so.

Then, a tethered horse raised its head and neighed. The prefect asked, “And what does this one say?”
“It complains the trough’s feed is too hot to eat.”
Again, they checked, and it was true.

As the Qingming Festival neared, officials herded over twenty sheep. One lagged behind, refusing to move, and cried out when struck. The prefect asked, “Why does the sheep resist?”
Guinian answered, “It says it carries a lamb and begs to give birth before facing slaughter.”
The prefect kept the sheep for over a month, and indeed, it bore a lamb.

Afterward, Guinian wandered beyond the frontier, and his whereabouts became unknown.

White Haiqiong said: "Li Bai now serves as the Overseer of Pure Transcendence in the Upper Clarity of the Eastern Florescence, while Bai Letian has become the Perpetual Immortal Governor of Penglai."

*Compendium of Perfected Immortals Through the Ages Who Embodied the Dao, Scroll Thirty-Seven Concluded*
*Compendium of Perfected Immortals Through the Ages Who Embodied the Dao, Scroll Thirty-Eight*

**Master Liu Xuanhe**

The Master’s surname was Liu, his given name Xuanhe, and his style Hunchenzi. His ancestors hailed from Pengcheng, but with the Jin dynasty’s southward migration, they settled in Duchang of Jiujiang—now under the jurisdiction of Nankang Prefecture. His father and forebears were scholars who delighted in the Dao and the rustic life of gardens and fields.

In the second year of Emperor Ming of Tang’s Kaiyuan reign, the Master was born. From childhood, he was keenly perceptive, and as he grew, he stood apart from the crowd. After fulfilling the rites of filial piety upon his parents’ passing, he was nearly forty when he resolved to transcend the mundane and withdraw from the world. He entered the Longxing Abbey on Mount Lu—now known as the White Crane Abbey—and paid homage to the abbot, the Three Caverns Master He Ziyu, as his teacher. In the second year of the Tianbao reign, he was ordained as a Daoist priest.

Thereafter, he had a remarkable encounter and dwelled for fifty-two years in a stone chamber on the Five Old Peaks. His resolve was unyielding through frost and dew; he consumed the fruits of pines and cypresses, swallowed the streaming rosy clouds of the two luminaries, and nurtured the jadelike elixir of the three fields. His true essence remained uncarved, and his great vessel was late in its completion. Fierce beasts guarded his hut, and spirit cranes were as tame as domesticated fowl. Such was the purity of his Dao and qi, where self and other were undisturbed, emotions and perceptions both forgotten—harmony perfected.

To the north of the mountain lay a crag, precipitous and towering. The Master planted papaya trees beneath it, and to this day, it is called Papaya Crag. The terrain is perilous, and few people reach it. One day, the Master descended to the west of the abbey, where he planted pines and cypresses, dug an elixir well, and drew water to heal the sick—many were cured. In the courtyard stood an ancient cedar, a hundred feet tall, also planted by the Master’s own hand.

During the Zhenyuan era of Emperor Dezong, Wu Yuanji rebelled, and disorderly troops ravaged the Huai region. The military governor of Hongzhou dispatched his aide, Wang Gou, to present a memorial to the capital, but he was seized by bandits from the Huai.

Wang Gou’s family came to the mountain in grief and knelt before the Master, who said: “Within the abbey dwell the Two Perfected Lords, Controller of Destinies and Recorder of Deeds—attendants of the Jade Emperor. You must pray with utmost sincerity, and I shall present a memorial on your behalf.” Soon after, two divine beings escorted Wang Gou away, their chariots and steeds racing a thousand *li* in an instant, and thus he escaped peril and returned home. This was the proof of the Master’s memorial.

From then on, court and commoner alike revered him, and eminent figures of the age bowed in homage. Yet the Master remained serene and silent, emptying himself to aid others, seeking nothing from the world. At the age of eighty-six, on the eighteenth day of the tenth month in the tenth year of the Zhenyuan era, he suddenly turned to his disciple Fan Xianzhou and said: “I have long dwelled on the Five Elders Peak, but now I shall journey to Golden Florescence. My name is recorded in the Mystic Register, and I must depart. You and the others must devote yourselves to the Dao with diligence, lest you sink into ruin.” With these words, he passed away. Following his instructions, his disciples concealed his sword beneath the Wutong Altar. On the day of his departure, white cranes circled and cried, thunder rumbled in a cloudless sky, and a rare fragrance filled the air. When they examined the coffin, they found it empty—only his shoes remained, which they buried at Crow’s Crag.

Later, Fan Xianzhou and the others erected a grand hall to honor him. Fan Xianzhou himself later attained the Dao, and none knew his end.

**Yang Taiming**
Yang Taiming, styled the Filial Son, was of unknown origin. A scholar by training, he served his parents with utmost devotion and was thus called Yang the Filial. He once served as a retainer to Prince Guo Ziyi of Fenyang, living with indifference to rank and wealth. He often advised Guo: “Though military governance demands strictness, human life is of utmost weight—one must not kill lightly.” For over twenty years, Guo Ziyi commanded troops without arbitrary executions, and his soldiers loved him as a father or elder brother—all due to Yang’s influence.

Yet Yang felt that endless warfare wounded the heart of compassion. He resigned to become Prefect of Chang’an. In the first year of the Yongtai era of Emperor Daizong, he donned Daoist robes, abandoned his post, and vanished into seclusion. First, he hid on Mount Mao, but finding it too shallow, he came to the summit of Mount Lu, where he built a hut, prepared azure-essence rice, and practiced grain avoidance. He crafted pine and wutong incense and prayed to the Perfected King, Envoy of the Nine Heavens, seeking the Dao of immortality. After fourteen years, on a clear autumn night when the moon was full, the sky vast and serene, he suddenly beheld a divine being at his place of worship—clad in a golden crown and crimson robe, adorned with strands of white pearls. Beside him stood one bearing a jade axe and another holding a jade casket.

The divine being said: “I am the Envoy of the Nine Heavens, sent to survey the good and evil of the world. For your lifelong service to the people, your pure and ascetic heart, and your unwavering devotion to the Dao, your sincerity has reached the Nine Heavens. The Three Primordial Lords of Jade Purity and Great Simplicity have commanded me to bestow upon you the *Scripture of the Supreme Great Cavern*, also called the *Nine Heavens Perfected Dao Scripture*.” Yang Taiming prostrated himself in gratitude. The divine being slowly opened the jade casket and presented him with the sacred text, then warned: “Remain steadfast in your practice to the end. When the Dao is perfected, I shall summon you.” With these words, wind and clouds surged, and the being vanished. Opening the scripture, Yang found it to be the *Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Supreme Great Cavern Scripture*, also titled the *Nine Heavens Perfected Dao Scripture*.

From then on, Yang followed the scripture’s teachings, shunning the dust of the world. Thirty-six years later, on the first day of the first month in the eighth year of the Yuanhe era of Emperor Xianzong, auspicious clouds gathered before his hut at noon. Yang ascended upon the clouds and departed.

**Li He**
Li He, styled Changji, was a descendant of the Prince of Zheng and a scion of the Later Tang royal house.

At seven, he could compose literary works. Han Yu and Huangfu Ti, upon first hearing of this, did not believe it. They visited his home and asked him to compose a poem. He took up his brush and finished it at once, entitling it *"A Lofty Chariot Passes By."* The two were astounded, and from then on, his name was known. He was slender and frail, with connected eyebrows, long fingernails, and could write with great speed. Whenever he went out, he rode a weak horse, followed by a young servant carrying an antique brocade satchel. Whenever inspiration struck, he would write it down and toss it into the satchel. Upon returning home at dusk, his mother would search the satchel, and seeing the abundance of writings, would exclaim in anger: "This child will vomit out his very heart before he is done!" Because his father’s name was Jin Su, he refused to take the imperial examinations. Han Yu wrote *"On Taboo Names"* on his behalf, yet in the end, he still did not sit for the exams.

His diction favored the strange and uncanny. What he produced was so startling and transcendent that it left the well-trodden paths of brush and ink far behind—no one of his time could imitate him. He composed several dozen *yuefu* poems, which the musicians of the *Yunshao* orchestra set to strings and pipes, and he was appointed Assistant Director of Music. He died at twenty-seven—some say at twenty-four—having never risen above the rank of Assistant in the Court of Imperial Sacrifices.

As Li He lay dying, he suddenly saw in broad daylight a man in dark robes riding a red steed, holding a tablet inscribed with characters resembling ancient seal script or the markings of thunder-struck stone. The man said: "I have come by the Emperor’s command to summon Li Changji." Li He, unable to read the script, knelt by his bed and kowtowed, saying: "My mother is old and ill. I do not wish to go." The dark-robed man laughed and said: "The Emperor has completed a white jade tower and summons you to compose its record. There is music in heaven—it is no hardship." Li He wept alone, though all around him saw it. Soon after, he breathed his last. From the window of his room, a billowing smoke arose, and the sounds of rumbling chariots and piping flutes filled the air. His mother hastily ordered the mourners to stop weeping and waited as if cooking five *dou* of millet.

*The Xuan Shi Zhi* records: After Li He’s death, his mother dreamed of him saying: "The Supreme Emperor has recently established a capital in the Cinnabar Garden and built a White Jade Palace. He has summoned me to compose the record of the new palace. He has also constructed the Hall of Congealed Emptiness and commands me to compile its musical chapters." Xuanyuan Mi Ming...

The Daoist of Mount Heng, Xuanyuan Miming, was a man of unknown origin who dwelled in the region between Heng and Xiang for over ninety years. *The Comprehensive Gazetteer of Southern Sacred Peak* states: "Linglu Peak is none other than the peak of the mountain, situated west of the Xiang River, a blessed land of the Twenty Caves and the abode of immortals. During the Song Dynasty, it was bestowed the name Jingde, and in the reign of Emperor Huizong, it was renamed the Longevity Palace of Mount Lu. Xuanyuan Miming once secluded himself here."

Skilled in capturing spectral beings, he imprisoned jiao dragons, glass tigers, and leopards. None knew his true age. The scholar Liu Shifu once encountered him south of the Xiang. On the fourth day of the twelfth month in the seventh year of the Yuanhe era of Emperor Xianzong’s reign, Miming traveled from Mount Heng past Mount Taibai, knowing Shifu was in a certain town. That night, he arrived at Shifu’s dwelling to lodge.

The editorial scholar Hou Xi had recently taken in a poetic guest. As Shifu and Xi gathered around the stove to discuss poetry, Miming sat among them. His appearance was exceedingly coarse, and he spoke in the Chu dialect, so Xi regarded him with disdain. Miming suddenly straightened his robes, fixed his gaze, and pointed to the stone tripod in the stove, saying to Xi: "Since you are a poet, can you compose a verse with me on this?"

Shifu, having known Miming from Heng and Xiang, saw only his age and treated him with superficial respect, unaware of his literary talent. Xi, pleased by the proposal, began with the first line: *"A skillful craftsman severs the mountain’s bone, / Carving its core for boiling and searing."* He then passed it to Xi, who eagerly continued: *"The straight handle holds no power, / Its mouth sealed, it swallows its own sound."*

Miming laughed soundlessly and said: "Is this all your poetry amounts to?" He then tucked his hands into his sleeves, hunched his shoulders, and leaned against the northern wall, saying to Shifu: "I do not understand the books of the worldly. Write for me." Thereupon, he intoned loudly: *"The dragon’s head shrinks like a slug, / The pig’s belly swells like Peng Xian."* Though seemingly careless, his words carried a veiled mockery of Xi. The two men exchanged glances, ashamed and startled, and pressed him further.

Shifu then said: *"Its outer layer bears the pattern of dry moss, / Within, dark waves stir in alarm."* Xi followed: *"Though its feet are delicate, it stands firm, / Even when scorched, its resolve remains unshaken."* Miming instructed Shifu to write: *"Mistakenly placed among tripods, / It recklessly pits water against fire."* Shifu replied: *"Its courage is like that of a stalwart warrior, / Round as the tassel of an iron-clad steed."* Xi added: *"Above, it rivals the peak of an incense burner, / Below, it mirrors the flatness of a mirror’s face."*

Miming said: *"Like an autumn melon clinging to its stem, / Or a frozen taro forcing its sprouts."* Shifu continued: *"A lump of primordial qi sealed within, / A slender spring pouring from a hidden crevice."* Xi said: *"Unworthy of the place where offerings are poured, / How could it know the purity of one’s heart?"* Miming replied: *"Just as a great furnace blazes, / So too does a petty vessel brim."* Shifu said: *"Its edges are bladeless, / Its form, like heaven’s own crafting."* Xi added: *"From afar, it seems a tortoise bearing a diagram, / Emerging to bask in the morning’s clear light."*

Miming said: *"Beside it, a single ear is pierced, / Above, a lone topknot juts."* Shifu said: *"Some marvel at its short tail’s leap, / Others liken it to a footless cauldron."* Xi said: *"What a pity, like a cold-food ball, / Cast aside by the roadside ditch."* Miming replied: *"When will it emerge from the ash pit? / No way to escape the jar’s confinement."* Shifu said: *"Its crude form bears the weight of pouring, / Its narrow midst shames the act of lifting."* Xi said: *"How could it boil the elixir of immortals? / Yet it has not sullied the lamb’s broth."*

Miming said: *"Its shape invites women’s laughter, / Its capacity is as light as a child’s."* Shifu said: *"In vain its unyielding nature, / It holds no more than a sheng or a ge."* Xi said: *"From the side, it resembles an upturned broken wheel, / From another, a snapped axle lies crosswise."* Miming said: *"At times, through the holes of an earthworm, / It faintly hums like a fly."* Shifu said: *"Though it spills over with excess, / It truly fails in its appointed task."* Xi said: *"Ever dwelling in the corner of the path, / How dare it harbor thoughts of leakage?"*

Miming said: *"Better to cling to warmth and decay, / Than to share the fate of the frozen."* Shifu said: *"In vain it strives to serve, / Too trifling to be presented."* Xi said: *"It turns and turns, ever motionless, / Opening and closing with a clank."* Xi’s thoughts grew increasingly strained, desperate to surpass Miming. Each time he searched for words, his voice grew more pained; each time he lifted his brush, he hesitated, and in the end, nothing remarkable emerged.

The two men composed over ten couplets, while Miming responded instantaneously, each line sharp and laced with mockery. As the night deepened, the two exhausted their thoughts and could no longer continue. They rose and bowed, saying: "Master, you are no ordinary man—we yield. We wish to join your disciples and dare not discuss poetry further."

Miming, roused, declared: "This poem must be completed." Turning to Shifu, he said: "Take up your brush. I will finish it with you." Then he recited: *"Far surpassing the precious coral, / Yet only a name passed by word of mouth. / Though it graces ancient sacrificial vessels, / It is not held in the hand as a root. / Polished to remove its edges, / Steeped until it gleams with light. / I hope you will not mock it— / This vessel is now in use."*

Shifu wrote it down and had them read it. He asked the two: "Is the poem not yet complete?" Both replied in unison: "It is complete." Miming said: "Neither of you is worthy of my words. Is this truly literature? I have composed within the limits of your abilities, not what I have learned from my masters. What I have heard, you are not fit to hear. Is it only in writing? Even my speech is not commonly heard. I shall close my mouth now."

The two men, greatly alarmed, rose and bowed, saying: "We dare not ask further questions. We only wish to hear a single word." They asked: "Master, you claim not to understand the books of men. Then what books do you understand?" He gave no answer. Discomfited, they withdrew to their seats.

Miming leaned against the wall and fell asleep, his snores rumbling like thunder. The two men turned pale with dread and dared not even breathe. Soon after, the two also succumbed to exhaustion and dozed off. When they awoke, Miming was gone. They heard a servant boy say: "Dawn is near. The Daoist has left the house—he is nowhere to be found." The two, astonished, took the poem and sought out Han Yu to inquire about the man. Han Yu said: "I have heard of a reclusive gentleman named Miming—could this be him?" Thereupon, he composed the *Preface to Linked Verses on the Stone Tripod*.

Miming once passed by the Eight Cassia Yao Temple, where his calligraphy remained. Later generations carved it into stone, recording: "During the reign of Emperor Lizong of the Song, the state historian of Xiaoshan, Ze, wrote *Record of Miming’s Newly Established Hermitage on Mount Heng*, which states: *The Water Curtain Grotto is the most secluded spot of the Southern Marchmount. On the last day of the seventh month in the second year of the Duanping era, Ze of Xiaoshan in Jiangxi visited at dawn and, captivated by its purity, lingered past noon without leaving. Three fellow Daoists grew weary, their servants hungry and seeking food—all departed. I sat alone in the Tianni Pavilion, chanting verses: ‘The old tree’s shade, a weary traveler’s rest / The cold spring, a wanderer’s hunger-quenching rinse.’*"

A recluse with a topknot, leaning on a staff, emerged from the ravine and inquired about the verses I had chanted. Taking the first line I had recited, he immediately responded with a matching couplet: *"This mountain’s vastness holds boundless space— / Lightly chant no verse in haste."* His features were delicate yet ancient. I asked his origin, and he replied: *"The Western White Tortoise dwells in the Land of White Waters."* When I pressed for his name, he gave none. Instead, he plucked a fallen pine needle and inscribed upon the cliff: *"Heaven sent me in the Tang, / Sun and moon illuminate me, / Han Yu knows me."* Suddenly, he drew from his sleeve a stalk of grass, coral-like in form, and said: *"Are you hungry? Eat this."* Then he strode away. Suspecting him to be no ordinary man, I hurried after him and asked: *"What elixir did you just leave me?"* He did not turn back. Upon consulting the *Classic of Materia Medica*, I found that red lingzhi grows on Mount Heng—this must have been a kind of lingzhi.

Later, the Daoist Luo Zhizhen invited me to the White Tortoise Spring, and I realized it was the very White Water Spring! *"Yu"* (愈) combined with *"mi"* (弥) forms *"Ming"* (明), and *"sun and moon"* (日月) also make *"Ming"*—surely this was Miming. I asked Zhizhen: *"Has this old man appeared by the spring?"* He replied: *"No, but who can say he does not dwell unseen beneath this roof?"* So we fashioned an image of him by the spring and established a shrine.

Some say Miming was none other than Han Yu himself. Alas, the old man had already told me as much. Others claim his legacy rests in the *Stone Cauldron Linked Verses* and Han Yu’s preface, not in a shrine. Alas, though the old man has passed through countless kalpas, the karmic habit of speech lingers untransformed, and his lofty, disdainful air toward Magistrate Liu remains unsoftened. From the Yuanhe era of the Tang to this day, the mountain has forgotten him entirely. I was fortunate to encounter him, and Zhizhen fortunate to heed me. To soothe the spirit is one purpose; to fill the mountain’s missing records is another. Was this fated? I commissioned the hermitage of Miming’s companion to inscribe a plaque, and composed a Chu song to summon him:

*"The simurgh leads the way, the swan-drawn chariot soars—
To the Great White Peak, what path shall we meet?
The stone cauldron’s words are small, yet their fame towers high,
Above the peaks of Heng, his name ascends the sky.
O immortal, when shall you return?
Your song defies age beneath the southern heavens’ turn.
How many scrolls lie hidden in the mountain’s keep?
The wooden wings’ secrets lost, no trace to reap.
Within the cauldron’s depths, immortal traces gleam,
Mortal bones shed, his form like a dream.
We offer jade blossoms, the cinnabar’s flow,
Awakening the numinous, stirring the soul’s glow."*

In the second year of the Chunyou era, I further inscribed the *Illustration of the Stone Cauldron Linked Verses*, noting: *"A Tang scholar, reading Jia Dao’s stele, remarked: ‘The Miming of the *Stone Cauldron Linked Verses* is none other than Jia Dao himself.’ But Jia Dao was a Buddhist monk from Fanyang, while Miming was a Daoist from Mount Heng—they do not align. The stele’s claim is baseless; how can it be trusted?"*

Liu Shang, a native of Pengcheng, settled in Chang’an. Diligent in study, he excelled in memorization and literary composition. His *Eighteen Stanzas of the Barbarian Reed-Pipe* circulated widely, recited even by women and children. Passing the imperial examinations, he served in the central bureaucracy, rising to the rank of Gentleman.

His nature was deeply drawn to Daoist arts; whenever he encountered a Daoist, he would take them as his master, diligently practicing alchemy and qi-absorption without exception. Often he lamented how fleeting time was, how his sinews and bones gradually weakened, how he rushed about from dawn to dusk, only to exhaust himself—what benefit did the floating glory of worldly office bring to him? The ancient worthies all abandoned their posts to seek the Dao, many attaining transcendence. Now that his children’s marriages were settled and he was no longer burdened by worldly ties, how was he inferior to Xu of the Far Wanderings? Thus, feigning illness, he resigned his post and entered the Daoist path.

Traveling to Guangling, he encountered a Daoist selling medicine on a city street, drawing crowds with meals, and many spoke of its miraculous efficacy. Among the throng, the Daoist fixed his gaze on Liu Shang with unusual intensity, then set aside his medicines, took his hand, and ascended to a tavern’s upper floor, where they drank in celebration. The Daoist’s discourse spanned events from the Qin and Han dynasties, as if he had witnessed them firsthand. Liu Shang was astonished; he immediately took him as his master and paid him reverence. The Daoist then said: "The Way of divine transcendence cannot be attained so easily." As dusk fell, Liu Shang returned to his lodging, while the Daoist descended the stairs—vanishing without a trace. Liu Shang was even more bewildered. The next day, he searched the marketplace again, where the Daoist was still selling medicine. Seeing Liu Shang, he grew even more delighted, once more leading him to the wine tavern, where they drank deeply and talked animatedly. Producing a small medicine pouch, he presented it to Liu Shang with a playful chant:

*"Should you find yourself in Yangzhou with naught to do,
Come, let us climb the tavern’s stair anew.
This pouch I gift you as we part—
What more could one desire through endless years apart?"*

Liu Shang memorized the words and received the pouch. That evening, they parted. Later, when Liu Shang sought him again, the Daoist was nowhere to be found. Opening the pouch, he found layer upon layer of paper wrapping a gourd, inside which were nine pills resembling sesame seeds. Following the Daoist’s oral instructions, he swallowed them and suddenly felt his spirit invigorated, hunger dispelled, his body light and buoyant. Crossing the river, he traveled to Mount Mao, then later to Zhanggong Cave in Yixing. In springtime, enamored of the scenery by the Hu Stream near his thatched hut, he entered Hufu Islet, secluding himself in the mountains. Nearby woodcutters still glimpsed him, saying: "That is Gentleman Liu." No one knew where he ultimately went—he had already become an earthbound immortal.

Liu Shi
Liu Shi, whose childhood name was Yige, was the elder brother of Liu Zhan. Born into poverty yet devoted to the Dao, he often encountered Daoists passing by his home. One Daoist, seeing something extraordinary in him, asked if he understood the Dao. "I do," he replied. Yet the Daoist observed: "Your nature still carries too much worldly qi, and your karmic obstacles have not been smoothed—how can you force yourself to study?" Liu Shi asked: "Could I take you as my master?" The Daoist replied: "Would you dare?" Thereupon, he became his disciple and followed him into Luofu Mountain.

Liu Shi and Liu Zhan both studied books, but while Liu Shi dwelled in the mountains seeking the Dao—eschewing headscarves, wearing hempen clothes, and serving the Daoist as a scribe—Liu Zhan aspired to glory and officialdom. Liu Shi told him: "If he fails the examinations, he will wander the mountains and wilds; if he passes, he will toil in the dust of the world. Yet beware of wealth and rank—within forty years, this will be proven." Liu Zhan said: "The immortals are distant and hard to seek. Even Qin Shihuang and Han Wudi spared no effort, yet the halls of power are within reach. It is easier to become a Ma Zhou or Zhang Jiuling." Thereafter, Liu Shi devoted himself even more intensely to the Dao, eventually secluding himself on Luofu Mountain.

Liu Zhan passed the imperial examinations and held a series of prestigious posts, rising to the rank of chief minister, where he earned a reputation for harmonizing governance. Later, he was demoted and sent south. While mooring his boat by the riverside at Chaotai in Guangzhou, a youth with hempen clothes and unbound hair suddenly appeared through a torrential downpour—his robes and shoes untouched by rain—and sought to see him. The attendants were astonished and announced: "Yige has come." Reporting this to Liu Zhan and describing the visitor’s appearance, Liu Zhan was struck with wonder and rushed to greet him. Liu Shi appeared no older than twenty, while Liu Zhan, now a disgraced official, had grown frail and aged. Overcome with grief and joy, Liu Shi consoled him: "We are brothers, bound as flesh and bone. I grieve that my words of old have come to pass—forty years have now elapsed." Liu Zhan, sighing deeply, asked: "Can I still cultivate the Dao?" Liu Shi replied: "You have long basked in honor and glory, charged with harmonizing yin and yang. How could your thoughts and actions not have taken their toll? Unless I intervene, what can be done? Even if I had ascended as a celestial immortal, how could I save you? I have come only to bid you farewell, not to rescue you." They boarded the same boat, reminiscing about their long separation, and by the next morning, Liu Shi had vanished. To this day, he is occasionally seen on Luofu Mountain. Liu Zhan continued his journey south and died in exile.

Luo Wanxiang
Luo Wanxiang’s origins are unknown. A man of letters, well-versed in astronomy and profoundly skilled in the *Book of Changes*, he was of extraordinary integrity, wandering the world as a commoner. He dwelled on Wangwu Mountain for many years, then later traveled to Luofu Mountain, where he sighed: "This is the Cave Heaven of Vermilion Brightness, where Ge Zhichuan once refined his elixir. Though Deng Yue is no longer here to detain me, I shall linger awhile." Enamored of the scenery at Stone Tower, he built a thatched hut at the mountain’s foot and took up residence. For decades, he consumed yellow essence, practiced qi-absorption in his hut, and occasionally ventured to Zengcheng, Quanshan, or the waters below Bushui to gather herbs. He also traveled to the cities of Fujian and Guangdong, selling medicine and drinking wine, coming and going without fixed routine. Sometimes he ate enough for ten men; other times, he fasted for months or years. Light and agile, he could cover three or four hundred *li* in a day, outpacing galloping horses even at a leisurely pace. Later, he returned to his hut by Stone Tower and never emerged again, secluding himself in the mountains.

Yin Wenxiang
Yin Wenxiang, also named Daoquan, commonly called Qiqi, was known to many by this name, though his origins are unknown. He wandered the world, and though people saw him for many years, none could fathom his age. His face was fair and bright, as if he were a man of forty. Wherever he went, he often changed his name, never settling in one place.

Once, he sold medicine in Jingzhou. At the time, both the Tibetan and Han populations in Lingtai suffered severely from epidemics, but those who took his remedies recovered instantly, and all called him divine. He would distribute any money he earned to others, yet often remained drunk in the city streets. Zhou Bao met him in Chang’an and later, upon becoming the Jingyuan military governor, invited him with great reverence, admiring his arts of Daoist cultivation and return to the primordial. When Zhou Bao was transferred to govern Zhexi, after several years, Qiqi suddenly reappeared, again selling medicine. Hearing this, Bao was overjoyed and hastily summoned him, treating him with even greater veneration. Whenever Qiqi was drunk, he would sing:

*"In a moment, wine is brewed,
In an instant, flowers bloom.
The zither plays the tune of ‘Green Jade,’
The furnace refines cinnabar bright."*

Bao tested these claims, and all proved true. Qiqi’s other arts—planting melons, angling for fish—resembled those of the immortal Ge Xianweng.

At Hulín Temple, a azalea tree stood over a *zhang* tall. Each late spring, its blossoms would burst into riotous color. Monks said that during the Zhenyuan era of Emperor Dezong of Tang, a foreign monk had brought its roots in his alms bowl, nourished with some elixir, and planted them. Thereafter, the temple adorned the flower courtyard and kept it locked. Some who peered inside claimed to see women in crimson robes, radiant and lovely, wandering beneath the tree. Anyone who plucked a flower or broke a branch would invariably come to harm. The locals called them the flower spirits, and thus all protected the tree, which bloomed more luxuriantly than ordinary flowers. When the blossoms were about to open, scouts would report their progress, and the military governor, his guests, and officials would gather daily to admire them. Later, the entire city—men and women, people from all directions—would follow with wine and music, reveling from spring into summer, from dawn till dusk, until the streets and alleys nearly abandoned their livelihoods.

One day, Bao said to Qiqi: *"The flowers of Hulín Temple are the most wondrous in the world. I’ve heard you can make flowers bloom out of season—could you do so with these?"*
Qiqi replied: *"I can."*
Bao said: *"The Double Ninth Festival is near. Could you make them bloom by then?"*
Qiqi agreed. Three days before the festival, he went to Hulín Temple to spend the night. At midnight, a woman appeared and said: *"Daoist, do you wish to make these flowers bloom?"*
Qiqi asked: *"Who comes here in the dead of night?"*
The woman replied: *"I was sent by the Supreme Mystery to tend these flowers in the mortal realm. I have been here over a hundred years, and soon I must return to the gardens of heaven. Today, I will bloom them with you—none but you could move me to do so."* With that, she vanished.

The next morning, the temple monks were astonished to see the flowers gradually unfurling their buds. By the ninth day, they burst into full, riotous bloom, as splendid as in spring or summer. After several days, the flowers suddenly vanished—no petals littered the ground.

Later, Qiqi happened to visit the home of an official, arriving just as a banquet was underway. The host and guests hurried to greet him, but some entertainers and courtesans present mocked him. Qiqi said: *"The host wishes to use two chestnuts as a drinking game—will that do?"* All agreed, expecting some amusing trick to enliven the feast. He passed the chestnuts around, and those who sniffed them detected a strange, wondrous fragrance and gasped in awe. Only two who had laughed at Qiqi smelled them and turned to stone, their noses stuck fast. They cried out that the stench was unbearable. The two leapt up, dancing wildly, their hairpins scattering, tears mingling with their powder and rouge. The other performers began dancing in chaos, music playing of its own accord, perfectly in time. The song would end, but the dance never ceased. The entire gathering collapsed in laughter.

After some time, the host pleaded with Qiqi for mercy. Soon after, the stone fell from their noses, and the chestnuts reappeared. When passed around again, they still bore the same strange fragrance, and the hairpins and cosmetics were restored, unharmed. Some thereafter treated Qiqi with reverence.

Qiqi could also turn water into wine, carve wood into dried meat, make people walk backward until he told them to stop, or halt a boat with a command. He called birds to follow him, spat on fish to revive them, and by pinching earth and drawing on the ground, could shape mountains and rivers. He would break reeds to gather ants, transforming them into cities and people. Those who had traveled the places he depicted said they matched perfectly—only smaller. His wonders were too numerous to record.

Two years later, Xue Xuan and Liu Hao rebelled, and Bao Nan fled to Hangzhou. Bao Zongrong, who commanded the troops, governed with harsh justice, and his punishments often fell upon the innocent. Former Prefect of Shangrao, Chen Quanyu, passed through his territory and was framed for disaster—his entire clan was executed in a bloodbath. Bao, at eighty-three, remained vigorous in sinew and strength, with a hundred female entertainers in his service, having acquired Qiqi’s arts. Later, as retribution for the innocent and for Quanyu’s wrongful death, he suddenly perished in a single day.

During the mutiny of Liu Hao’s army, Qiqi was pushed off the northern cliff of Ganlu Temple by the mob and presumed drowned in the river. Yet years later, he was seen in Jiangxi, selling medicines and traveling into Shu, his whereabouts ultimately unknown. The flowers of Hulun Temple, their roots lost when the temple burned in the war, had truly returned to the gardens of the immortals.

Tan Qiaoyan was a Daoist of Mount Mao. During the Baoli era of Emperor Jingzong of Tang, he traveled through Tiantai, Jiang, and Zhe, his appearance that of a man barely twenty. None knew he possessed the Way; he devoted himself to hidden acts of kindness, often leaving gold on the roads to aid the poor. If thanked, he would not acknowledge it. Asked why, he replied: “The Perfected Lord of the Hidden transforms earth into gold to relieve want—I regret I cannot do the same. To seek gratitude with useless things is no wonder.” Over time, people learned of his arts: he transmuted roof tiles into elixirs with divine cinnabar and commanded ghosts and spirits with talismans.

Once, discussing Emperor Yang of Sui’s eastern progress, Qiaoyan inadvertently remarked: “When the Dan River was dug in the Daye era, three ridges were severed, and blood flowed beneath—I once went to see it.” From this, it became clear that Qiaoyan had lived for several centuries.

His disciple Deng Jia served him for many years and was taught the secrets of alchemy and talismanic arts, though he could not master their full subtlety. He could only subdue tigers on land and bind jiao and li in water. Qiaoyan told him: “A person’s allotment is fixed by fate. Water and stone may be made hot, but fire cannot make them cold. Though you exhaust my Way, this is all you will achieve.” In the Kaicheng era of Emperor Wenzong, he ascended lightly to Mount Nanyue.

*Comprehensive Mirror of Perfected Immortals Who Embodied the Dao, Volume 38 (concluded)*

*Comprehensive Mirror of Perfected Immortals Who Embodied the Dao, Volume 39*

Ye Fashan, styled Daoyuan, was a native of Kuocang in Chuzhou and came from a family of Daoists. His mother, née Liu, napped one day and dreamed of a shooting star entering her mouth; she swallowed it and conceived. After fifteen months, she gave birth. At seven, he drowned in the great river for three years before returning. His parents asked why, and he said: “The Azure Lad led me to drink cloud-essence and pay court to the Most High—thus my brief delay.” When he came of age, he stood nine feet tall, his nature simple and sincere, and he abstained from meat.

He received the arts of concealment from Zhao Yuanyang of Qingcheng and the *Eight Histories* from Wei Shanjun of Songyang, thereafter mastering the suppression of ghosts and spirits. He chose to dwell on the Mao-You Mountain, where a massive boulder blocked the road, forcing travelers to take a detour. He cast a talisman, and the stone rose of its own accord.

Once, while traveling on White Horse Mountain, he encountered three divine beings in a stone chamber, all clad in brocade and jeweled crowns. They told Fashan: “We bear the Most High’s secret decree: you are the Left Immortal Minister of the Purple Tenuity of the Great Ultimate, demoted to the mortal realm for negligence in recording merits. Hasten to perform deeds, aid the people, and assist the state—you shall regain your original post. We now transmit to you the methods of the Orthodox Unity of the Three and Five. Strive to practice them.” With that, they departed. Thereafter, his sincerity dispelled all manner of malevolent forces, and his arts proved unfailingly efficacious.

Emperor Gaozong of the Tang, having heard of his reputation, favored him with an official post, but Fashan declined and requested instead to be ordained as a Daoist priest. He was retained in the palace’s inner chambers for rituals, and the emperor bestowed upon him lavish gifts. At the time, the emperor had summoned all alchemists to transmute cinnabar into gold and refine elixirs. Fashan advised, “Elixirs cannot be swiftly concocted; they only waste wealth and time. I beg to distinguish the true from the false.” The emperor agreed, and over a hundred alchemists were dismissed.

Once, while performing a ritual at the Lingkong Shrine in the eastern capital, he erected an altar for sacrifice, drawing crowds of onlookers. Several dozen people rushed into the fire, causing great alarm; they were rescued just in time. Fashan smiled and said, “These were possessed by demons—my method has subdued them.” Upon inquiry, it proved true, and their illnesses were all cured.

For fifty years, spanning the reigns of Gaozong and Zhongzong, he wandered among the mountains yet was frequently summoned to court. He held no fondness for Buddhist teachings, often vehemently criticizing them, which led some to dismiss him as biased against monks. Yet none could fathom the depth of his arts.

On the ninth day of the third month in the fourth year of Jinglong under Emperor Zhongzong, the three divine beings descended again, conveying the Most High’s decree: “You shall assist Our Lord Ruizong and the Emperor of Kaiyuan.” They added, “You must not seclude yourself in remote mountains and crags, neglecting your appointed duty.” At the time, neither emperor had yet ascended the throne, yet Fashan already knew their temple names and reign titles. Thus, he secretly aided Ruizong and Minghuang.

When Tubo presented tribute, the sealed casket bore the inscription: *“Let the Emperor open this himself, lest others know.”* Fashan memorialized, “This is inauspicious—let the Tubo envoy open it.” When opened, a crossbow bolt sprang from the casket, striking the envoy dead.

In the *Xiantian* era of Ruizong, Fashan was appointed *Honglu Qing* in an honorary capacity and enfeoffed as Duke of Yue, with Jinglong Abbey as his residence. His grandfather, Chongmi, was posthumously honored as *“Master of the Dao, of Profound Virtue,”* while his father, Huiming, was posthumously appointed Governor of Shezhou, their renown shining brightly in their time. The number of officials and commoners who received his teachings was beyond count.

His granduncle, Jingneng, was a master of the Dao and skilled in composition. During the reign of Emperor Gaozu, he served in the Hanlin Academy and as Libationer of the Directorate of Education. Once, the Prince of Ruyang hosted a feast for Jingneng, who remarked, “I have a disciple who can drink—let me summon him to meet you.” The next day, a visitor announced himself: *“Daoist Chang Chiman, at your service.”* He appeared as a dwarf. They discoursed on the Dao of the primordial chaos, and when offered wine, he drank some five *dou* before suddenly collapsing—only to reveal himself as a jar.

At Qiantang, a monstrous clam drowned boats, tormenting travelers. Fashan cast a talisman into the water, and the clam perished.

In the early *Kaiyuan* era, Emperor Minghuang, observing the Lantern Festival at the Shangyuan Palace, declared no spectacle could surpass it. Fashan replied, “Tonight’s lanterns in the Western Freezing Prefecture are nearly its equal.” The emperor, astonished, demanded to see them. Fashan bade him close his eyes, and in an instant, they arrived.

The emperor then presented him with an iron ruyi scepter as a reward for his wine, and the next day sent an envoy to retrieve it—sure enough, it was still there.

On another Mid-Autumn night, Fashan accompanied the emperor to the Lunar Palace, where they heard celestial music. When asked its name, they were told it was *"Purple Cloud Melody."* The emperor, well-versed in music, memorized it and later composed a *yuefu* piece, renaming it *"The Rainbow Skirt and Feathered Robe Dance."*

As they returned from the Moon Palace, passing over Youzhou, they looked down to see the city eerily still, bathed in moonlight as bright as day. Fashan took up a jade flute and asked the emperor to play a tune, then tossed a handful of gold coins into the city below. Within ten days, Youzhou reported that on Mid-Autumn night, celestial music had descended over the city, and gold coins were recovered and presented to the court.

For several years, Fashan resided beneath Siming Mountain and east of Tiantai. One day, on the first of the fifth month, an old man arrived at his gate, wailing and begging for help. His disciples, thinking him ill, informed their master. Fashan summoned the man and asked his trouble. The man replied, *"I am a dragon of the Eastern Sea. The Celestial Emperor commanded me to guard the treasures of the Eight Seas, with each term lasting a thousand years. Those who complete their duty without fault are enrolled among the immortals. I have served nine hundred and seventy years—my merit nearly complete. But recently, a Brahmin sorcerer, practicing illusions on the seashore, has spent thirty years chanting spells day and night. His magic is nearly perfected, and on the fifth day of the fifth month, the sea will dry up. The treasures that govern the tides and secure the seas—divine artifacts ordained by the Celestial Emperor—will surely be seized by the Brahmin. I beg you to save me with your talismanic power."* Fashan immediately dispatched a flying talisman, and the sea returned to its former state. The Brahmin, ashamed and sighing, plunged into the sea and drowned. The next day, the dragon and his kin presented treasures in gratitude, but Fashan said, *"This mountain wild is a dwelling for spirits—pearls and jewels are of no use to me."* He refused the gifts, then told the dragon, *"If you could bring a clear spring to the rocky heights, some distance from the water, it would be a fine favor."* That night, the sound of wind and rain filled the air, and by dawn, a stone channel of flowing spring water encircled the mountain hermitage. To this day, it is called *"The Celestial Master’s Channel."*

The Duke of Yan, Zhang Shuo, once drank with Fashan, who remarked, *"There is a recluse here named Gou—prudent and reticent, but deeply fond of wine. He can drink a *zhong* or a *shi* without issue."* When summoned, Gou appeared as a dwarf, his waist several spans thick, his bows and salutations clumsy. Yet whenever wine was served, he drained it without change in expression. Suddenly, Fashan rebuked him: *"You offer no lofty discourse or refined conversation—only an obsession with wine. What use are you?"* He seized Gou and lifted him—only to reveal him as a massive wine jar.

In the eighth year of *Kaiyuan*, Fashan underwent *shijie* at Jinglong Abbey. Some say he was born in the *bingzi* year of the *Daye* era of the Sui and died in the *rentu* year, living to the age of one hundred and seven. After his transformation, Emperor Minghuang, missing him, issued an edict:

*"The late Daoist Ye [Fashan], whose name and rank are known, possessed celestial purity and profound subtlety, mastering the arcane and expounding the mysteries of talismans. Though his wisdom was ineffable and his nature elusive, he dwelled in the humble abode of the Dao yet mingled with the court. He wore the yellow cap without pride and accepted the purple sash without vanity—peerless in his solitary grace, serene in his singular path."*

His vital qi transcended the mundane, his steadfast wind left no dust; his golden bones jutted outward, his pearlescent radiance shone within. Such was his embodiment of the celestial immortals, his name ascending to the highest virtue.

In moments of respite from governance, We would summon him to inquire of the supreme Dao. He, with the methods of ordering the state, repeatedly offered sagacious counsel—his plans subtle as hidden admonitions, his affairs yielding great benefit. We sigh that his noble voice has not yet faded, yet grieve that his transformation came so soon. Why must such sorrow strike, why must such goodness be cut short? In remembrance of our past sorrow, it is fitting to bestow posthumous honors, to grace his resting earth with dignity. Let him be posthumously appointed Prefect of Yuezhou. By edict, he shall be interred in Songyang, with all officials in white mourning robes weeping as they escort him beyond the city gates. His nephew, the Vice Governor of Runzhou, shall be ordained as a Daoist master.

Among his hundred-odd disciples, only Ji Qiwu and Yin Xi were deemed his true heirs.

**Xing Hepu**

Xing Hepu’s origins are unknown. He dwelled in seclusion near the Ying Sea, skilled in mental calculation and divination—whatever a person’s mind conceived, he could discern by casting his calculations. He settled in the region between Mount Song and the Ying River, composing the *Three Treatises of Yingyang*, which included the method of "revolving the mind through empty space." He could also revive the dead through his arts.

In the twelfth year of *Kaiyuan*, Emperor Minghuang summoned him to the capital, where the nobility and high officials flocked to his door like a marketplace. A friend of his lived at the foot of Baima Slope; when Hepu arrived, the man had already been dead for several days. As his mother mourned, Hepu laid the corpse on a bed, then lay down beside it. After sealing the room for a long while, he rose, prepared a bath, and though the man had not yet revived, Hepu lay down with him again. In a moment, the man came back to life.

There was also a certain Marshal Cui, a close friend of Hepu’s, who fell gravely ill. He lamented, *"Master, why have you abandoned me?"* Soon after, they heard a sound like a hole being bored through the wall of his bedchamber. Peering through, they saw a tiny crack, which gradually widened. A procession of several hundred attendants appeared, with one figure in purple robes and a tall hat seated in a carriage. He addressed Cui: *"Master Xing is destined to be saved by the Great Unity."* With these words, they departed, and Cui’s illness immediately improved; the hole in the wall vanished as well.

Fang Guan, serving as Magistrate of Tonglu, treated Hepu with great kindness. One day, they strolled hand in hand beyond the city gates, unknowingly walking ten *li* or more. They arrived at Xiagu Village, where an abandoned Buddhist hall stood, its pines and bamboos dense and shimmering. They sat beneath them. Hepu struck the ground with his staff and ordered his attendant to dig. After several feet, they unearthed a clay jar containing a letter from Lou Shide to Yong the Elder. Hepu laughed and asked Guan, *"Do you recall this?"* Guan’s topknot had once been a monk’s topknot in a past life—his name had been Yong. Hepu said, *"You will rise to the rank of chief minister. Take good care of yourself. Yet in the end, you will be buried in a painted coffin, with a Kuchean pall, neither in your private residence, nor at public expense, nor in a temple, nor at your in-laws’ home."* Later, Guan indeed became a chief minister, but was demoted and exiled to Guizhou, where he died of illness at the Purple Ultimate Palace.

After his condition slightly improved, the prefect summoned him to the prefectural hall, where he was served painted delicacies. Once he finished eating, his illness flared up again. That night, he dreamed of a divine being who said, *"This is the ancient truth of Master Xing."* The omen proved true. The next day, he indeed passed away. Earlier, a merchant had been dragging Kuchean planks to fashion a canopy for the Lord Lao; these were borrowed to make his coffin.

Hepu dwelled on Mount Zhongnan, and many Dao seekers gathered around him. At the time, Cui Wu and his friend served him with reverence. One day, Hepu said to his disciples, *"This evening, an unusual guest will arrive. Prepare a feast for me."* He also warned, *"Be careful not to spy on us."* The next day, a man indeed arrived—five feet tall, three feet wide, with a head occupying half his frame. Clad in coarse robes and holding a tablet, he stroked his thick beard and roared with laughter, his lips nearly touching his ears. His boisterous speech was mostly unintelligible to mortals. Cui Wu, unable to restrain his curiosity, hurried past without facing him directly. The guest fixed his gaze and asked Hepu, *"Is this not the Teacher of Mount Tai?"* Hepu replied, *"Indeed."* After eating, the guest departed.

Hepu said to Wu, *"This was the Celestial Emperor’s playful envoy. When he spoke of the Teacher of Mount Tai, did you understand?"* Wu, tears streaming, replied, *"In my youth, I heard my elders say I was the reincarnation of Master Bao, though my past life remains unclear."* Later, Hepu also vanished without a trace.

**Shen Yuanzhi**
Shen Yuanzhi was a man of unknown origins.

Shen Yuanzhi wandered among famous mountains, broadly gathering esoteric arts, and attained the Dao of inner cultivation and transcendence. During the Kaiyuan era of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang, he was summoned to the capital and installed at the Kaiyuan Abbey. At the time, Zhang Guo, Xing Hepu, Luo Gongyuan, Ye Fashan, Yin Xi, He Siyuan, Shi Chong, and Mi □ Xiyan together upheld the true wind of the Left Assistant, supporting and safeguarding the sovereign. When the emperor traveled to the hot springs or visited the eastern capital, Yuanzhi always accompanied him. Skilled in discoursing on purity and stillness, the emperor frequently summoned him for counsel, their conversations often lasting hours. Only the Noble Consort and the palace lady Zhao Yunrong, who attended the imperial morning audience, were privy to his teachings. Once, as Yunrong served tea, she repeatedly begged for an elixir to prolong her life. Yuanzhi replied, *"What I regret is only that you will not long remain in this world."* Yunrong persisted in her entreaties, and moved by her earnestness, Yuanzhi relented, giving her a single pellet of Crimson Cloud Elixir. *"If you take this,"* he said, *"your body will not decay in death. Only ensure your coffin is large, your tomb spacious, and that you are interred with pearls and jade. Leave gaps for air to circulate, so that your hun-soul does not drift into emptiness nor your po-soul sink into the depths. After a hundred years, you may be reborn. This is the Way of Refining the Form in the Great Yin—you will become an Earth Immortal, and after another century, ascend to a Grotto-Heaven."* When Yunrong fell ill at Lanchang Palace while accompanying the emperor to the eastern capital, she specifically recalled Yuanzhi’s words and consulted the Noble Consort. The emperor ordered the eunuch Chen Yuanzao to fulfill her requests and bury her accordingly. By the final years of Emperor Xianzong’s Yuanhe era, a century later, Yunrong indeed revived.

Yuanzhi, too, appeared and vanished unpredictably, styling himself Master Tian. Those who knew him claimed he was a man of the Wei dynasty, having already lived for several centuries. *The Dragon City Record* states: *"On the fifteenth day of the eighth month, Emperor Xuanzong of Tang, accompanied by Master Shen, journeyed to the Lunar Palace. The cold was piercing, and pure dew dampened their robes. Passing through a great gate, they saw within a radiance of jade a vast palace hall, its plaque reading ‘Palace of Vast Cold and Pure Emptiness.’ Soon after, they beheld over ten moon maidens in white, riding white simurghs, laughing and dancing beneath a great osmanthus tree in the broad courtyard, their music clear and exquisite. Upon his return, the emperor composed the ‘Rainbow Skirt and Feathered Robe Dance.’"* This account closely resembles one involving Ye Fashan, and both are preserved here. Another unofficial history records a similar tale in the biography of Luo Gongyuan.

**Luo Gongyuan**
The Daoist Luo Gongyuan, also named Siyuan, was a native of Ezhou. Some say he was from Jiulong County in Pengzhou. He cultivated the Dao in a hermitage at Liyuan, often traveling to Qingcheng and Luochuan to seek instruction. Having lived through the Zhou, Sui, and Tang dynasties, he reached an age of several centuries, sometimes appearing old, sometimes young, concealing his fame while remaining known far and wide.

During the Kaiyuan era of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang, in the third month of spring, the prefect of Ezhou hosted a banquet for his subordinates in the gardens of the prefectural residence. All the local gentry and commoners came to enjoy the outing. Among them appeared a man in white robes, eight or nine feet tall, his bearing majestic and dignified. The gatekeeper initially grew suspicious, but soon a young boy spotted him and rebuked him sharply: "Why have you left your proper place and come here? You should depart at once." The white-robed man immediately gathered his robes and fled. The gatekeeper seized the boy and reported the matter to the prefect, who questioned him about his family. The boy replied, "My surname is Luo, my given name Gongyuan. From childhood I have studied the Daoist arts. Just now I saw the river-dragon guardian come here, so I drove it away for Your Excellency."

The prefect remained unconvinced. "I must see its form," he insisted.

"Then I ask you to wait until the day after tomorrow," the boy replied.

When the appointed time arrived, he dug a small channel at the riverbank, barely over a foot wide, to draw in the waters of the Yangtze. The prefect and the people of the prefecture all gathered to watch. Presently, a white fish, five or six inches long, swam in with the current. As it leapt, it grew larger, its trail of mist rising like a thread. Moments later, black vapor filled the sky, obscuring everything within arm’s reach. Gongyuan addressed the prefect: "Quickly, take the people of the prefecture up to the ferry pavilion." Before they could reach it, thunder crashed, lightning flashed, and rain poured down. When the storm briefly cleared, a white dragon appeared in the river’s center, its head merging with the clouds. After the space of a meal, it vanished.

At the time, Emperor Xuanzong favored those beyond the mundane world. The prefect reported all this in full, and the emperor summoned Gongyuan. Whatever he was asked, his answers always met the emperor’s expectations.

In Jiannan, there grew a fruit called the *ri shu zi* ("sun-ripened fruit"). Zhang Guo and Ye Fashan once told the emperor that through their arts they could obtain it, saying, "It will arrive by afternoon." That day, as they sat by the brazier, Gongyuan joined them. Evening fell, yet the fruit did not come. Zhang and Ye exchanged glances. "Could it be Master Luo?" they wondered. Gongyuan smiled, reached into the brazier, and pulled out a fire iron. In an instant, a messenger arrived bearing the sun-ripened fruit. Ye questioned the messenger, who replied, "When I reached the capital, flames stretched across the sky, blocking every path. I had to rest awhile before I could get here." The assembled company turned pale.

The emperor often summoned Gongyuan, Fashan, Jingang, and the Tripiṭaka Master to test their arts, and Gongyuan always prevailed. Whenever he entered or left the palace, he would sometimes offer subtle admonitions, sometimes speak plainly to advise or correct. He excelled at dispelling demons, summoning dragons, and bringing rain, while Ye Fashan concealed his own abilities.

The emperor wished to learn Gongyuan’s arts of protection. Gongyuan said, "Your Majesty’s jade tablets and golden slips have already reached the Nine Heavens. You should emulate the effortless governance of Yao and Shun, follow the frugality of Wen and Jing. How can one of Your Majesty’s stature—the lord of all under heaven, the possessor of ten thousand chariots, the guardian of the ancestral temples, the pillar of the altars of soil and grain—lightly pursue such minor arts? If I were to teach you all my skills, you would surely end up carrying the imperial seal among the common folk, trapped in the guise of a fish."

The emperor did not heed his words and instead berated Gongyuan. Gongyuan fled into a palace pillar, leaping through it several times. The emperor grew angrier and split the pillar in pursuit. When Gongyuan reappeared, he entered a stone block, which the emperor then shattered into dozens of pieces—each bearing Gongyuan’s form. The emperor apologized, and Gongyuan returned to normal.

Though the emperor pressed him relentlessly, Gongyuan only taught a little, refusing to reveal all his arts. When others attempted to conceal themselves, they could manage no more than hiding their clothing or belt, or at best their shadow. But when Gongyuan tested his own arts, they proved effective. The emperor bestowed lavish gifts of gold and silk, yet in the end, he could not grasp their subtleties. Enraged, he ordered Gongyuan beheaded.

A eunuch attendant, Fu Xianyu, returned from Shu and hastened Gongyuan westward by carriage. To Xianyu, he said: "I entered Shu during the Xianhe era of Emperor Cheng of Jin, dwelling among forests and springs to cultivate the true Dao. Hearing the Son of Heaven favored the Way, I abandoned the joys of mist and clouds to brave the dust of the mortal world. I wished to teach the supreme Dao to the imperial lord, but when he summoned me to a separate palace to refine elixirs, I told him: 'The human body’s organs are clogged with meat and blood; the Three Fields remain unemptied, the Six Qi uncleansed. Allow me ten years to prepare before receiving the elixir.' Yet he could not endure the wait and, enraged, executed me with a blade to the neck—how cruel! Still, one who has attained the Dao unites form and qi; how could worldly weapons, water, or fire harm me? Yet I recall His Majesty’s name inscribed in the registers of cinnabar splendor, bound by an old jade bond, and my lingering affection for him cannot fade. Take this letter," he said, drawing it from his sleeve, "and deliver it to the emperor. Tell him I am Luo Gongda, disciple of Master Jingzhen. He will surely understand."

He added: "When I secluded myself in the mountains, I ate fruit and drank water, passing the years in quietude. When I came to court to expound the Dao, I subsisted on three jujubes." The emperor sighed deeply and sent him to the Suming Abbey, dispatching the eunuch attendant Guo Daozan with two trays of jujubes. In the sixth month, he was summoned again. The emperor led him into the inner palace, granted him a seat, and together they admired the lotus pond in the sleeping quarters.

The emperor asked: "The land suffers from drought and scorching heat; autumn’s harvest is lost. What can be done?"
Gongyuan replied: "If Your Majesty’s sincerity can move Heaven, I humbly request a nocturnal jiao ritual. It will surely bring sweet rain."
The emperor approved. When the ritual concluded, thunder and rain followed immediately. Overjoyed, the emperor inquired about the essentials of governing the state.
Gongyuan answered: "The sage’s Dao resides in the heart, not in external pursuits."
The emperor bestowed upon him a purple robe and ordained him as a Daoist priest. Thereafter, Gongyuan begged leave of the court and, by imperial decree, returned to his old retreat to refine elixirs, receiving five hundred bolts of silk. In the twenty-seventh year, his elixir was completed. The emperor summoned him to court and lavished him with rewards. When Emperor Suzong issued a summons in the second year of the Zhide era, Gongyuan did not go. In the early Qianyuan era, he reached the age of one hundred and forty before ascending in broad daylight at the Fuyun Abbey.

Xue Youqi
Xue Youqi was a native of Baoding in Pu Prefecture. Of a serene and composed nature, he possessed keen insight and remarkable foresight. In his leisure from scholarly pursuits, he delighted in hearing of matters beyond the mundane. During the Kaiyuan era of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang, he passed the imperial examinations at the tender age of twenty and was appointed magistrate of Ling Prefecture. Before his term ended, he felt a longing for forests and springs, so he cast off his official robes, donned a hempen cap and coarse cloth, and wandered between Qingcheng and Emei. After some time, he traveled to Mount Heming, seeking the former abode of the Han Celestial Master. After twelve years of cultivation, his Daoist qi flourished.

In the early Tianbao era, he journeyed to Mount Heng, where he chose a secluded dwelling. Concealing his name, he settled beneath the Five Elders Peak, roaming freely in a realm of self-attainment, unbound and at ease. Though he harmonized with the world and adapted to its ways, his true nature remained uncompromised. He was well-versed in the *Three Caverns’ True Teachings*, and recluses and wanderers flocked to him daily, drawn by his reputation. With vast and profound eloquence, he illuminated the Way according to each disciple’s capacity.

He presented the *Treatise on the Mysterious Subtle* in three volumes, which the emperor praised for its profound insight. Soon after, he achieved liberation from the corpse at Mount Mo. He had once annotated the *Scripture of the Numinous Treasure’s Salvation of Humankind*, which circulated widely. The *Compendium of Mount Heng’s Marvels* records: "Today, the Lingxu Palace’s Celestial Fragrance Terrace is where he annotated the scripture. At dawn and dusk, clouds and mist swirl like incense."

Wang Ke
Wang Ke, styled Xianke, was a native of Hengyuan in Qingcheng—some say he hailed from beneath Cuishan in Yongkang County, Shuzhou. His mother, Lady Ding, dreamed of a great star illuminating her body. Upon waking, her chamber was filled with light, and she conceived. At birth, his afterbirth was purple, his veins green, and his appearance extraordinary. As a child, his intelligence surpassed the common. Though his family was immensely wealthy, he paid it no mind. As he grew, he was kind and benevolent, moved to pity by the old, weak, and destitute, his compassion evident in his expression. He aided those in need and bestowed charity. During heavy snowfalls, he scattered grain to feed the birds.

Later, he encountered an immortal who transmitted the alchemical formula. He retreated to a side cave to cultivate, but after years of effort, he achieved nothing. Suddenly, his crucible cracked, and the elixir transformed into golden-threaded stone. Later, while tending his mountain garden, he came one day to the Dragon Pool of the Wei River and ascended the Western Peak, where he met a Daoist refining elixirs. Ke assisted with firewood and charcoal, serving him for three years through cold and heat without faltering. The Daoist, admiring his dedication, imparted secret teachings, instructing him to cultivate the supreme Dao internally while accumulating hidden merits externally. When the elixir was complete, the Daoist shared a portion with him. After consuming it, Ke gradually felt his spirit invigorated, his qi unburdened, his body light, and his mind at ease.

Beside his dwelling stood several large parasol trees. With a leap, he ascended to their crowns and from there rose into the heavens. The trees remain to this day. He attained the Dao in the third year of the Yifeng era of Emperor Gaozong of Tang. The site is now called Luojia Mountain, and the Daoist was none other than Luo Gongyuan.

Li Yu
Li Yu was a member of the Tang imperial clan. When Luo Gongyuan discoursed on the wonders of the Dao during Emperor Xuanzong’s leisure, he frequented the Han Yuan Hall and was once tested there. Later, he was appointed prefect of She Prefecture and set out with his family for his post. As they crossed the Yangtze, a turtle spirit seized Yu’s soul and possessed his body, continuing the journey to the prefecture in his stead. One day, Gongyuan, inspecting the records of the water府, discovered this and dispatched a talisman to slay the turtle, restoring Yu’s soul. Yu then abandoned his office and entered the Taiyi Cave on Mount Qingcheng, beseeching Gongyuan for talismans to save his family. He became Gongyuan’s disciple and later attained immortality, now serving at his side.

Du Sheng
Du Sheng, styled Keyun, claimed to be a native of Duling in Jingzhao, though his age was unknown. He ate nothing but drank three *dou* of wine without becoming drunk. His complexion was radiant, as if he were a man of thirty.

Du Sheng wore a large square kerchief, a tattered hat, and a green cloth robe in both winter and summer. His discourse was lofty, and he possessed considerable literary talent. If someone offered him a new kerchief or robe, he would accept it but never remove the old one. Upon receiving the new, he would go out and give it to the first person he met. He often wandered the streets in a drunken stagger, skilled in writing with sand. He favored inscribing the character for "dragon" in water bowls or basins, letting it float and turn left and right. If he shouted at it, the character would rise over a *zhang* high, faint as mist, taking the form of a small dragon, and upon being called, descend back into the water. He never asked people for money, but when they gave it to him of their own accord and summoned him to perform under the eaves, he would earn a great deal in a short while—then scatter it among the poor or taverns. He did this daily wherever he went, and people never grew weary of giving him money, though some suspected him of bewitching the crowd with his arts. In winter, he would lie in the snow for two or three days, and people thought him frozen to death. But when they prodded him, he would rise slowly, shake off the snow, and walk away as if still drunk, his breath steaming as though he had just awoken from a summer nap.

Du Ruxiu, son of the Duke of Heguo, served as governor of Suzhou. Hearing that Keyun was in the city, he rejoiced and invited him in, bowing to him and addressing him as "Daoist Master." His guests and subordinates were astonished, but Ruxiu said, "When my late father governed Xichuan, he held this Daoist elder in the highest esteem, and they often exchanged visits in his study. At the time, I was only ten years old. Now, over fifty, I have not seen him for forty years—yet his appearance and bearing remain unchanged." He kept Keyun in the prefectural residence and consulted him on Daoist arts. Keyun replied, "Simply govern with virtue and care for the people. Given the troubled times, you must especially protect yourself. You cannot yet cast off worldly dust and retreat to the mountains and forests with your family. Keep far from the wounds of war—Daoist arts are not yet for you."

When the people of the prefecture offered him money and silk, he declined at first but then, upon leaving the city, distributed it all to others. Ruxiu’s reverence for him grew even deeper. Sometimes Keyun joined Ruxiu and his guests for drinking gatherings. When others composed poems in response to one another, Keyun would speak verses offhand, profound in meaning and rich with the themes of immortals and transcendents—none could match him.

Later, during military chaos, Ruxiu was indeed killed by soldiers, and people saw Keyun wounded and slain as well. Soon after, only his old robe remained, torn into three or four pieces with slashed marks on the ground. Yet days later, many saw Keyun crossing the Song River and Zhe River, passing through Hangzhou, Yue, Qu, and Xin into Jiangxi, still drunk and writing in sand as before. A year later, he was spotted in Hunan. When asked about Suzhou, he recounted the events clearly and laughed. He also mentioned having lived on Mount Nanyue and that he would soon depart. Upon closer inquiry, it became clear he had mastered the Dao of invisibility and transformation—none could fathom it.

Your servant Daoyi remarks: Du Sheng’s attainment of the Dao ran deep. He blended with the world, carefree in poetry and wine, fasting yet clad in rags. His square kerchief and cloth robe, though old, he never discarded; when given new ones, he passed them to others. In winter, he slept in the snow, and daily wandered the streets—yet none could guess his age. Had one judged him by his attire alone, they would never have known he had attained the Dao. True immortals conceal and reveal themselves in the world—how easily can they be perceived? Thus the *Daodejing* says: "The sage wears coarse cloth yet holds jade within."

Yang Xi
Yang Xi was a native of Mount Tai.

Yang Xi held hereditary office and resided in Jinyun. Having passed the imperial examination in classics, he was appointed as the assistant magistrate of Jiajing County in Xizhou. Upon resigning, he returned to Jinyun. His elder brother, Yang Ting, served as the magistrate of Le’an in Taizhou.

Yang Xi dwelled in seclusion on Mount Kuocang, his nature serene and withdrawn, indifferent to worldly honors. He aspired to a life of freedom and long cherished the arts of the Dao. One day, his wife suddenly died. He remarked, "Zhuangzi drummed on a basin to express his enlightenment—now I, too, am joyful. Is it not fitting to bury her?" His son had his own calling, and his daughter was already wed; thus, he was forever unencumbered.

Later, he visited Ruanlang Pavilion. On a cliff over ten *zhang* above the ground, there was an inscription in seal script, its characters immense. The world believed it to be the hand of Ruan Zhao. Later, when Sheng Cheng sent craftsmen to chisel the stone for a rubbing, they discovered that it was in fact a poem left by Li Yangbing, who had once served as magistrate of Jinyun and visited the pavilion:

*"Where has the wanderer Ruan gone?*
*Immortal clouds stretch o’er the cave’s mouth.*
*Where none have trodden for ages past,*
*Today I walk this very ground."*

Beside the pavilion, Yang Xi drank wine with several Daoist priests from Jinyun Observatory during the blossoming season. At midday, he suddenly collapsed as if dead, though his breath remained warm. Carried home, he revived after seven days. The villagers and Daoists came to inquire, and Yang Xi recounted:

"At first, a person in a green turban and crimson robes, who called themselves Lingying, invited me into a grotto palace. There, I saw towering pavilions, phoenixes and cranes circling, the sky clear and the air warm—unlike the mortal world. Soon, from a stone crevice, something flew out, shaped like a pair of objects with long green stems. Lingying pointed and said, ‘This is the Azure Spirit Mushroom. Eat it, and you may attain immortality.’ I was ravenous and, sitting upon a rock, consumed it entirely. The taste was sweet and delicious.

Lingying said, ‘You have long borne the destiny of an immortal; today, you shall at last meet the celestial officials.’ They led me before three immortals: one wore a *yuanyou* cap, the other two, iridescent feathered robes. Their attendants, both civil and martial, were innumerable. Lingying told me, ‘The first is the Lesser Heavenly King, the second the Great Master of Huayang, and the third the Hidden Mystery Celestial Aide.’ I bowed to each in turn, and they all said, ‘You possess the bones of an immortal but cannot yet ascend. You must still cultivate upon the earth.’

Presently, Lingying escorted me out—through the western gate of the Kuocang Grotto. Only then did I awaken to my true self."

Thereafter, Yang Xi no longer favored the scent of grains. He drank three *sheng* of water daily and ate a single bowl of lilies. His body grew light, his joints all moved, rustling like bamboo slats or the sound of clappers. He spoke and chanted incessantly, as if conversing with unseen others, day and night. At times, he would take two or three hundred sheets of paper and fill them with writing in an instant—characters no one could decipher. When Yang Xi read them aloud, they proved to be refined compositions. Daoist priests and curious scholars transcribed them from his dictation; indeed, they were elegant verses, rich with allusions to immortals, Penglai, and the Isles of the Blessed.

For over a year, he remained lean yet vigorous. By the second year, he grew plump and fair, abstaining entirely from grains and drinking only water. In his third year, his hair turned black as lacquer, his complexion like a child’s. He walked as if flying, could drink three *dou* of wine without intoxication, and usually wore coarse cloth. Later, he visited his brother in Le’an, arriving in a single day. He then traveled to Tiantai, again arriving in a day, covering two to four hundred *li* daily. He returned to Mount Xiandu, where he ingested elixirs and cultivated *qi* for over twenty years. Finally, he journeyed south into Mount Weiyu, and none saw him again.

Tan Qiao
Tan Qiao, styled Jingsheng, was the son of Tan Hui, a scholar of the Directorate of Education during the Tang. Precocious in childhood, he grew to be well-versed in the classics and histories, with an exceptional memory—no question stumped him. His prose was pure and elegant. Though his father urged him to pursue the imperial examinations, Tan Qiao had no interest. Instead, he was drawn to the works of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, as well as the *Inner Biography of the Perfected Lords* from the reigns of King Mu of Zhou and Emperor Wu of Han. He studied them all with meticulous care.

One day, he informed his father of his intent to travel to Mount Zhongnan. His father, considering the mountain’s proximity to the capital, permitted him. From there, he traversed Mount Zhongnan, Mount Taibai, the Taihang range, Mount Wangwu, Mount Song, Mount Hua, and Mount Tai, wandering through renowned mountains in succession, never returning home. His father sent letters in reproach, to which Tan Qiao replied: "In ancient times, Lord Mao was once a son who left his father to study the Dao. Now I emulate him, hoping it may benefit my parents." His parents, seeing his unwavering resolve in seeking the Way, no longer constrained him with worldly affairs and allowed him to follow his path.

For over a decade, Tan Qiao studied under a Daoist master on Mount Song, mastering the arts of *bigu* (abstaining from grains) and cultivating *qi*. He took delight only in wine, often wandering in a drunken haze, going wherever he pleased. In summer, he wore a black fur robe; in winter, a green cloth garment. At times, he would lie in wind, snow, or frost for days on end. People assumed he had perished, but upon inspection, his *qi* remained steady and serene. His father, ever mindful of him, frequently sent servants to seek him out, and without fail, each spring and winter, he would send clothes, money, and silk. Tan Qiao would receive them with joy, then promptly dispatch the servants with a reply, lavishing them with gifts. No sooner had they departed than he would take the clothes his father had sent into the streets, giving them to the poor and destitute, or leaving them at taverns, keeping nothing for himself. When asked why he did this, he replied: "How can I bear to keep them? If they were stolen, it would implicate others. Unburdened by clothes or food, I have no worries." He was always cheerful, though some called him mad. As he wandered, he would chant:

*A thread spun into the Yangtze, a fan spread as the sky,
My straw sandals cast to the eastern sea’s side.
Penglai’s Way is not so far—
Just before this wanderer’s staff, it lies.*

Later, he resided on Mount Heng, where he refined an elixir and consumed it. Thereafter, he could enter water without getting wet, walk through fire without being scorched, and conceal or transform his form at will. He then departed for Mount Qingcheng.

Tan Qiao once composed the *Book of Transformation*. Song Qiqiu of the Southern Tang plagiarized it, claiming authorship, and it circulated under his name. In the summer of the fifth year of Emperor Renzong of Song’s Jiayou era (1060), the fourth month, Bixuzi wrote a postscript to the *Book of Transformation*, stating:

The Lord of Primal Chaos said: "I once asked Master Layman Chen Tuan to recite this book. Upon reaching the *Chapter of the Child*, he closed the volume and told me: 'My friend Tan Jingsheng first composed the *Book of Transformation* on Mount Zhongnan. Later, he traveled to the Three Maos and passed through Jiankang. There, he met Song Qiqiu, who possessed the bearing of an immortal, though mired in cunning. Yet he stood apart from the dust-bound masses. Tan Qiao thus shared this passage with him: *The child plays with his shadow, unaware he is played by it; the madman mocks the image, unaware he is mocked by it. The transformer of the household does not know he is transformed by it; the transformer of the state does not know he is transformed by it. The drunkard clings to his drunkenness, the scabbed treats his scabs—the more they persist, the more their afflictions deepen, and none turn back.* Qiqiu remained unmoved. Tan Jingsheng then presented the *Book of Transformation* to him, saying: *This book’s transformations are boundless. I hope you will write a preface and transmit it to later generations.*' With that, he took up his staff and departed. Qiqiu seized the work as his own and wrote the preface."

Alas! In ancient times, Xiang Xiu expounded on the *Zhuangzi*, but before his commentary could be transmitted, he died. Guo Xiang surreptitiously altered and published it as his own—a true culprit. Now, Tan Qiao’s name is inscribed in the annals of immortals, his body untouched by age, yet Song Qiqiu dared to indulge his thieving heart, obscuring the immortal’s legacy. His crime was grave indeed. It is no wonder he met an unworthy end.

She Xichang

She Xichang, a native of Hedong—*The Comprehensive Gazetteer of Mount Nanyue* records him as a man of Mianzhu in Hanzhou. His family had long held official rank. From childhood, Xichang scorned worldly glory, abstained from meat, and dressed only in plain cloth. He was deeply fond of mountains and rivers. One day, while wandering Mount Qingcheng, he journeyed south to Taoyuan. Later, he encountered Master Zhengyi, Sima Chengzhen, on Mount Nanyue, who transmitted to him the *Three Caverns Scriptural Canon*. He delved into the profound mysteries of the Dao, practicing diligently without respite. Thus, exalted perfected beings descended frequently, and wondrous fragrances and celestial music were often heard in his quiet chamber.

Emperor Ming of Tang summoned him to the palace, where he was asked about the Dao and virtue. His discourse was supremely subtle. The emperor, delighted, bestowed upon him exceptional favor and honor, though Xichang soon returned to the mountains. The emperor commanded him to compose a poem and presented him with a preface, which read:

*"The Master of Refinement aspires to the Mystic Gate, his heart anchored on Mount Nanyue. Having ascended to the register of Daoist adepts, he suddenly came to take his leave, wishing to return to his old mountain and preserve the purity of emptiness. We do not oppose his noble resolve, for we esteem his devoted cultivation. Should he encounter perfected beings or divine elixirs, he may yet visit the imperial palace."*

The poem said:
*A cultivator of the grotto-palace,
He longs for his old dwelling on Mount Heng.
Having attained the essentials of the Golden Tower,
He offers the sacred texts of Jade Clarity.
The cloud-path to the Three Heavens draws near,
The pine-stream holds ten thousand silences.
Still, he should transmit the secret formulas,
Coming and going to await the immortal’s chariot.*

Xichang once composed the *Mystic Pivot of Dao and Virtue*, a work that encompassed the subtleties of nurturing the true, and annotated the *Nine Perfected’s Descent of the Sage*. He returned to his former hermitage beneath the Flower-Canopy Peak, where he refined the elixir to completion. One day, he suddenly told his disciples: *"This evening, the Celestial Perfected will gather on Zhurong Peak. I have been summoned and must depart."* Thereupon, he ascended into the void and did not return. Later, the Ascending Void Palace was built in his honor.

Tian Xuying

The Daoist Tian Xuying, styled Liangyi, was a native of the State of Qi. By nature, he was simple and unrefined, speaking without reservation. During the Kaihuang era of Emperor Wen of Sui, while serving his parents in You County, he was exiled to Mount Nanyue due to a clamor. There, he tilled the soil on Purple Canopy Peak, fulfilling his filial duty for over fifty years.

After his mother’s passing, he wandered among the Five Peaks, roaming freely to his heart’s content. During the *Longshuo* era of Emperor Gaozong of Tang, the prefect of the state, Lord Tian, built the Hall of Descending Perfection at the Yue Temple to house him, while Tian Qiancheng adorned its walls with white plaster. The esoteric methods of the *Shangqing* Great Cavern he received had been transmitted from Master Zhengyi to Xue Jichang, and from Jichang to Xuying. Having inherited the essentials of the Dao, he traversed rivers and clouds, befriending only Jiang Hanhong. At the time, Lü Wei and Yang Feng, envoys to Hunan, once sought him out for lofty discourse.

When Changsha suffered drought and prayers went unanswered for a long time, Xuying was summoned. Wearing tattered robes, he arrived at the prefecture—without a word, rain fell of its own accord. Another time, when incessant rains persisted, the prefect built an altar at the Yue Temple. Xuying sat in silent composure by the shore; as soon as he ascended the altar, the skies cleared. During the *Yuanhe* era of Emperor Xianzong, he entered Mount Tiantai and never emerged again. When Emperor Xianzong issued an edict, he did not respond.

There was a certain Ouyang Ping, also a master of Daoist learning, who treated him as an elder brother. One evening, he dreamed of three divine beings descending from heaven, each holding a golden censer, as if to summon someone. He secretly told others: *"The two masters will soon depart, and I shall follow."* Before long, Xuying indeed ascended as an immortal, and Jiang followed soon after.

Among his disciples, three achieved prominence: Bingyao Feng Weiliang, Xianglin Chen Guayan, and Fangying Xu Lingfu.

**Feng Weiliang**

The Daoist Feng Weiliang, styled Yunyi, was a native of Xiangzhou. He cultivated the Dao at the Central Palace of Mount Heng, forming a bond of "mist-and-vine" friendship with Xu Lingfu and Chen Guayan. Beyond tending to incense and flame, he found joy in zither and wine. After some time, he came to the Hall of Descending Perfection and became a disciple of Tian Xuying, receiving the secret formulas of the Three Caverns.

During the *Yuanhe* era of Emperor Xianzong of Tang, he entered Mount Tiantai and Guiji. Yuan Ji, the surveillance commissioner, heard of his reputation and admired him, often visiting to inquire about matters beyond the mundane. The Tongwu Temple, since its restoration by Master Zhengyi, had long fallen into disrepair. Weiliang rebuilt it, constructing the Upper Clarity Pavilion, the Hall of Descending Perfection, the White Cloud Pavilion, and the Leisurely Retreat, thus reviving the legacy of Master Zhengyi. He propagated the Dao of the Three Caverns throughout the Jiangnan region.

When Emperor Xianzong summoned him, he did not go, instead establishing the Bingyao Hermitage in the Valley of Flourishing Forests to reside there. He often wandered alone to the Peach Blossom Spring and Golden Mound, returning only once every few months. One day, he suddenly ordered a bath, donned his cap and robe, and descended to the courtyard, as if responding to a summons.

In an instant, he ascended the steps and passed away, aged ninety. Of the hundred-odd disciples he transmitted his teachings to, only Ying Yijie, Ye Cangzhi, and Shen Guanwai grasped their essence; none others attained his profundities.

**Daoist Chen Guayan**
Daoist Chen Guayan, styled Dachu, was a native of Jiyang in Yuezhou. He dwelt in seclusion upon Jade Radiance Peak, calling his abode the Forest of Flourishing Hua. Where the ritual codes of Tiantai had fallen into neglect, he gathered and restored them. In daily life, he made the zither and wine his companions, composing verses with untrammeled abandon, never embellishing his words. One of his mountain-dwelling poems reads:

*Beyond drunkenness, the thatched hall’s gate stands ajar,*
*Awakening, I open my eyes to green mountains afar.*
*Where pine blossoms fall, gibbons still roost at night,*
*Deer in herds return through the forest’s fading light.*

Another verse declares:

*Ice mirrors the water like a polished glass,*
*Snow swept, jade turns to dust as it must pass.*
*Why ask of past or present’s fleeting span?*
*Here stands a man of the primordial clan.*

Though Guayan restored the missing ritual codes, he did not practice them himself. Among his transmitted disciples, only Liu Jie—styled Chujing—abandoned his studies in the classics, left his home in Lanxi of Wuzhou, and became a Daoist under Wu Shousu, master of the Lingrui Abbey. Hearing of Guayan’s renown, he journeyed to the Forest of Flourishing Hua to seek instruction, serving with incense and staff for twenty years until he mastered Guayan’s Way. As Guayan prepared for his *shijie* (liberation by means of a simulated corpse), he instructed Chujing: *"Encase me in a cloth sack and place me in a stone chamber—take care not to use wood."* He lived to sixty-four. Chujing, along with Ye Cangzhi and Ying Yijie, became friends in the realm beyond form. After a long time, as he prepared to sit in transformation, he revealed a poem to his disciples before returning to the True:

*I, formless in origin, briefly took form,*
*By chance came to the mortal world, chasing its swarm.*
*The debts of rebirth now repaid in full,*
*I scratch my head, indifferent, and ascend to the Upper Clarity.*

Ten other poems of his remain in the Daoyuan Abbey of Tiantai.

**Daoist Xu Lingfu**
Daoist Xu Lingfu, styled Moxi Zi, was a native of Tianmu Mountain in Qiantang. Well-versed in Confucian learning, he harbored no ambition for fame or profit. He dwelt in a stone chamber on Tigerhead Rock of Cloud-Covered Peak in Tiantai for over a decade. His disciples built a thatched hut and entreated him to reside there, but he refused. Instead, he constructed his own hut atop a rocky ledge, where towering pines and verdant bamboo stood in solemn array. Nearby lay a square pond over a hundred paces wide, filled with strange rocks resembling islets—thus he named it Square Ying. Daily, he delighted in self-cultivation, and in his leisure, he composed verses such as:

*Silent and still, spirit congeals at the Great Ultimate’s dawn,*
*Responding to things without intent, riding clouds as my throne.*
*Cultivating one’s nature is no quest for attainment—*
*To know the True Person, look no further than this one.*

Another poem reads:

*To learn the Dao and perfect the True lies in this life alone,*
*Deluded fools await death, then seek life anew.*
*If this life fails to grasp the principle of non-birth,*
*Even if reborn, where shall rebirth ensue?*

In the early years of Emperor Wuzong’s Huichang era, the emperor dispatched the eastern Zhejiang inspector to summon him. Unable to decline, Lingfu emerged to meet the inspector and presented a poem expressing his resolve:

*My rustic nature sings of the Three Joys,*
*Imperial grace descends from the Ninefold Throne.*
*I seek to transmit the Purple Chamber’s decree,*
*To avoid descending from White Cloud Peak’s zone.*
*Much shamed by the crane in the books I’ve known,*
*Deeply humbled by dragons drawn on scrolls alone.*
*How might I assist the enlightened lord?*
*I’d rather grow old among pines and stone.*

The inspector memorialized Lingfu’s frailty and infirmity, and the summons was rescinded. Thereafter, he ceased eating, and after a long time, he entered quiescence and passed away, aged eighty-two. His works include *Five Essays on Mystic Insight*, a commentary on the *Tongxuan Zhenjing* in twelve chapters, as well as the *Record of Tiantai Mountain* and *Essentials of the Three Caverns*. Of his disciples, only Zuo Yuanze attained his Way.

**Daoist Liu Yuanqing**
Daoist Liu Yuanqing was a native of Wuchang. He studied under Wang Daozong and received the *Zhengyi Lu*. Before long, as Daozong prepared for his final repose, he bequeathed all his possessions to his disciples, but Yuanqing took only his books. After Daozong was buried on Eastern Mountain, on a clear night, a column of *qi* several *zhang* high arose from the tomb. Yuanqing found this strange and had the grave reopened. When the coffin was opened, only his master’s clothes and cap remained—thus he knew Daozong had attained the Dao. Moved by this realization, Yuanqing sailed across Dongting Lake, traveled to Wuling, and later entered Nanyue, where he studied under Tian Liangyi. Ascending the Immortal Altar of Lady Wei, he conceived the idea of settling there. From the altar, he climbed sixty-five *li* up a precipitous peak (*The Comprehensive Record of Nanyue’s Perfected* states: *ten-odd li*), where he found a south-facing stone cave and made it his dwelling. He channeled a spring to encircle his home, felled trees and cleared brambles, and built a small pavilion in front. A chessboard and tea set were carved from stone. When the prefectural governor Han Yue visited, he named the pavilion the Gathering of Immortals. Yuanqing often brewed wine from the sprouts of a hundred herbs. Though he ceased eating and refined his *qi*, he could still drink over a *dou* at a time.

In the early years of Emperor Jingzong’s Baoli era, he was summoned to the Hall of State Affairs. When asked about longevity, he replied: *"To be free of profit-seeking and scheming, to reduce selfishness and desire—this is the essence of cultivating the self across lifetimes."* The emperor was displeased and posed further challenges, then dismissed him to return to the mountains. When the wife of Tang Shen, prefect of Mingzhou, fell ill, she sought a talisman from Yuanqing. He warned the messenger: *"Present this talisman to the prefect first—do not show it to the lady beforehand."* When the messenger returned, Shen had already recovered, and his wife’s illness had resolved on its own.

During Emperor Wuzong’s Huichang era, Yuanqing was again summoned to the palace. The emperor requested the transmission of the Dharma register and inquired about the Three Pacts of blood sacrifice. He replied: *"What the world values most is the body’s hair and skin. For one of the Son of Heaven’s stature, it suffices to drink elixirs as a substitute."* After purifying himself, Yuanqing ascended the altar to transmit the register. He was bestowed the title of Grand Master for Splendid Happiness, Grand Academician of the Chongxuan Abbey, and styled Master of Broad Perfection. A separate Chongxuan Abbey was constructed for his residence. When he petitioned to return to the mountains, the emperor granted his request.

In the winter of the tenth month of the fifth year of Dazhong during Emperor Xuanzong’s reign, clouds and cranes descended repeatedly, and soon after, he passed away. Heavenly music was heard floating in the air, and on the day his spirit departed, only his staff and sandals remained. His disciple Lü Zhizhen attained his Dao. The Minister of War, Wan Ye, composed a stele inscription; the Vice Minister of Personnel, Zhao Lu, wrote his biography; Lu Fan authored the stone chamber inscription; and the Daoist Zhang Jianbai composed his esoteric biography.

Ye Cangzhi, a Daoist whose courtesy name was Hanxiang, was a native of Songyang in Chuzhou and a descendant of Fa Shan. Initially, he entered Anhe Abbey as a Daoist and traveled to Tiantai to receive the Three Caverns scriptures and registers from Feng Weiliang. He selected a scenic site on Yuxiao Peak to establish a Daoist retreat, naming it the Stone Gate Mountain Abode. Before it stood two peaks, towering and facing each other, hence the name Stone Gate. Daily, he recited the *Dao De Jing* and the *Scripture of Salvation*. In his later years, he became particularly skilled in talismanic arts, and those who sought his aid came in great numbers.

The prefect of Zizhou was afflicted by a malevolent entity and journeyed to request a talisman. Midway, he violated taboos of impurity and lost it. The prefect personally visited again and saw a bamboo tube on the table, sealed tightly—it was the talisman he had previously lost. He burned incense, took the case, and reverently carried it back, whereupon the malevolent entity vanished. Thereafter, households that received his proven talismans offered donations, and if not for his own use, he set them aside entirely for the repair of altars and the expenses of meritorious works. The prefect memorialized his virtue, and Emperor Yizong of Tang issued an imperial decree renaming the Stone Gate Mountain Abode as Yuxiao Abbey.

One day, he suddenly ordered wine and summoned his friend Ying Yijie to drink together. He spoke of his life’s affairs, then announced the day of his departure. When the time came, he inscribed on his door: *"Departing at the hour of the cock’s crow."* His disciples soon heard the sounds of pearl ornaments and mixed drum music in the air, and in an instant, as the cock crowed, they looked and found he had already transformed. He was seventy-four years old. Ying Yijie...

Ying Yijie, styled Shizhong, was a native of Runan. He was the great-grandson of the eminent recluse Ying Ning from the Kaiyuan era of the illustrious Emperor Xuanzong. For generations, his family had declined official service, dedicating themselves instead to the Dao and the cultivation of their nature.

His mother, née He, once dreamed of a shooting star entering her window. Startled awake, she found the room suffused with light and soon conceived. From birth, he showed no taste for meat or fish. At the age of seven, his nature was already keen and perceptive. He journeyed to Lingrui Abbey at Lan Brook, where Master Wu instructed him in the *Wenlie* of Laozi and Zhuangzi, as well as the *Book of Changes*. At thirteen, he took the tonsure as a Daoist, observing the Ten Precepts with diligence, his devotion evident in his constant burning of incense and recitation of scriptures. His masters and peers regarded him with reverence.

In time, he traveled to Mount Tiantai and Mount Longhu, where he received the registers of the Orthodox Unity, Purple Void, and Capital Merit, among others. Later, he was initiated into the *Ascending Mystery* and *Highest Clarity* traditions—the *Returning Chariot* and *Graded Dao*—along with the *Purple Texts*, *Plain Sashes*, *Earth-Traversing*, and *Heaven-Soaring Talismans*.

The great teachings of Highest Clarity had been transmitted from Tao Hongjing to Wang Yuanzhi, then to Master Pan, then to Alchemist Sima, then to Xue Jichang, then to Tian Liangyi, then to Feng Weiliang, and finally to Yijie. His mastery of these practices was meticulous, and thus his every action was subtly aided by numinous forces.

He formed bonds of friendship with the recluses Ye Cangzhi and Liu Chujing in the forests and springs.

During the Huichang era of Emperor Wuzong of the Tang, he established a separate Cold Altar southwest of the Tongqiao Abbey on Mount Tiantai to reside in. The Surveillance Commissioner Li Bao visited to inquire about the Dao, and subsequently memorialized the throne to request a name for the abbey, which was then bestowed as "Dao Origin." Remembrancer Zhang Ying composed the record.

Master Bingzhen dwelled in this place for over fifty years. People from Wu and Yue, gazing upon his virtuous influence, bowed in reverence, and the number of those who wished to attend him as disciples was beyond count. Whenever he entered stillness to perform the Dao, ascended the altar to inspect the registers, or bestowed blessings upon others, his actions were frequently met with numinous responses. In his daily practice, he recited the *Huangting* and *Dadong* scriptures, and was especially diligent in performing the arts of the *Eight Daoist Observances of Clouds*, the *Triple Prime Receptions*, the *Returning Wind Concealing Earth*, and the *Grasping the Dipper Hiding Heaven*.

At times, high officials memorialized the throne on his behalf, and an imperial edict was issued granting him a robe and honorific title, which he firmly declined. He once said to his disciples: "I have upheld the teachings and the Dharma, yet I cannot conceal my traces or hide my beginnings. Though the Dao does not shun humanity, one must practice diligently to attain it. Yet the Jade Capital and Golden Towers, the Yellow Springs and the Deng Metropolis—how far apart are they? They are but summoned by the mind. Strive earnestly, all of you."

During the Qianning era of Emperor Zhaozong, one day, after bathing and entering stillness, he composed his spirit as if awaiting something. At dawn the following day, he peacefully passed away at the age of eighty-five. That night, a clear fragrance filled the air, and apes and crows cried in sorrow. When his spirit was transferred to its resting place, only an empty coffin remained. Luo Yin of Dongyang composed a eulogy. Zuo Yuanze.

The Daoist Zuo Yuanze was a native of Yongjia. By nature, he was upright and unyielding, refusing to bend to the times. He served the master Fang Ying of Lingying, residing in a stone chamber on Fragrant Grove Peak after divining its auspiciousness, roughly a li from Fang Ying’s abode. Morning and evening, he paid his respects, never failing to visit, even in bitter cold or sweltering heat. Moved by his diligence and reverence, Fang Ying transmitted to him the secret essentials.

Later, on Jade Cloud Peak, someone held a Yellow Register Retreat, and Yuanze was listed among the compilers. He ascended the altar in straw sandals. When asked to do so, he replied: “The Three Realms are but a passing vision—what are these mounds of earth?”

Afterward, he returned to his pine chamber, abstained from grain, and ceased speaking. Suddenly, he shouldered a cloth sack containing wooden sandals and an ancient mirror, then entered the mountains, his destination unknown. Occasionally, he would emerge after a month or two to visit his friend Ying Yijie. Beyond discussing the purity of emptiness, he once spoke of his dwelling: a grotto with several dozen great bamboos to the left and right, a pond before it, and amid the winding islets, dozens of emerald lotuses. There were also several dozen patterned birds, resembling swans or roc, swimming among them. Charmed by the scene, he spent the night in the grotto. As night fell, something encircled his body. Awakening, he merely closed his eyes and sat in oblivion, and it departed only at dawn.

His coarse hempen robe reeked only of drool and fishy stench.

That night, he sat again in the grotto, pacing with a net laid out to await it. Sure enough, a creature emerged from the pond—several *zhang* in length, its eyes casting beams like those of a flood-dragon or oyster. He leaned over the cliff and scolded it; slowly, it shrank back into the water. Thereupon he warned: "Those who come after me are defenseless—take care not to dwell in these rocky caverns."

At the Green Barrier Abbey in Wenzhou stood a local earth deity, to whom villagers regularly offered blood sacrifices. Should the rites lapse, it would bring misfortune. Yuze struck the spirit’s back three times with his staff. The next day, a large wildcat lay dead in the courtyard, its back bearing three staff marks. The villagers later dreamed the deity saying: "The one who relied on me was beaten to death by an immortal officer—henceforth, do not offer me blood sacrifices."

One day, Yuze suddenly told the abbey’s keeper: "I shall depart elsewhere; prepare a bath for me." He then instructed: "When covering me, simply follow the scent of incense until it fades, and there you shall stop." That night, wind and rain clashed with thunder and lightning; within the radiance, armored guards appeared. As dawn approached, a voice called out, "Take care." They went to look—he had already transformed.

They followed the fading scent of incense as instructed and, upon reaching its end, found precisely as he had said: a natural stone vault, its age unknown.

He once composed a *Hymn to the True One*, inscribing it upon the cliff face of Fangying:

The Great Dao is profound and obscure, beyond all explication.
It embraces the vast void as its boundless abode,
and unites the ten thousand realms within the True One.
Guard the True with the Dao, yet the True is not singular.
Expressed in spontaneity,
entrusted to the myriad things.
Once the root of the womb is severed,
one transcends the Three Realms,
nine generations attain deliverance,
and the Three Bureaus lay down their brushes.
This truly relies on the merit of non-merit—
a merit so wondrous it defies comparison.

**Lü Zhi Zhen**
Lü Zhi Zhen, of unknown origin, was a disciple of Master Liu Yuanqing of the Broad Accomplishment. Inwardly pure and outwardly harmonious, he seemed incapable of speech. He dwelled in a stone chamber for over a decade, later visiting the capital each year, wandering the Xiao and Xiang rivers, and calling upon the homes of various disciples. He always carried two large gourds, in which he stored medicinal herbs, clothing, scriptures, and Daoist implements. Fond of healing others with minerals and stones, when he entered forests and valleys, tigers and leopards would follow him. When asked about the Dao, he would remain silent, offering no response.

Once, on the road through Shang Mountain, he suddenly paled and halted. Others were astonished, but soon after, bandits appeared ahead, brandishing blades. Zhi Zhen addressed them: "These travelers are all my disciples—do not disturb them." The bandits bowed and stepped aside, no longer daring to advance.

On another occasion, at the mouth of a valley, he declared, "Something harmful to people is traveling with us." He then entered the forest, emerging with two tigers bound by rope. From this, it was known that Zhi Zhen had deeply mastered the Way of Broad Accomplishment.

He once remarked: "In the early days of my stone chamber dwelling, the space was exceedingly cramped. One evening, while performing a jiao ritual, the mountain suddenly opened to reveal a level expanse dozens of paces wide, within which a black leopard tamedly circled my side."

**Du Guangting**
The Daoist Du Guangting, styled Binsheng and known as the Master of Bound Seas, was originally from Chuzhou. *The Record of Mount Qingcheng* states he was from Duling in Jingzhao. Well-versed in all books, his aspirations soared beyond the ordinary. During the reign of Emperor Yizong of Tang, he and Zheng Yunshou composed a ten-thousand-character rhapsody but failed to pass the examination. Resolutely, he embraced the Dao and became a disciple of the Tiantai Daoist Ying Yijie.

He often remarked that the Daoist laws, rituals, and teachings—since their compilation by Celestial Master Zhang of the Han and Lu Xiujing—had spanned vast ages and nearly fallen into ruin. Thus, he examined their authenticity, arranged them in order from beginning to end, so that all Daoist followers might forever benefit from his work. Zheng Tian recommended his writings to the court, and Emperor Xizong summoned him for an audience, bestowing upon him a purple robe and ivory tablet. He was appointed as a scholar of the Linde Hall and, by imperial decree, became the leader of the Daoist clergy. At the time, all deferred to him, saying: "A thousand fathoms deep is his sea of learning, ten thousand leaves thick his forest of words—he alone upholds the ancestral teachings and establishes the Daoist school throughout the realm."

At the beginning of the Zhonghe era, he followed the imperial carriage to Xingyuan, traveling through Xixian. There, he encountered the diviner Chen Qizi, known as Xiufu, whose unconventional manner struck him as extraordinary. Pushing through brambles, he dug into the earth, gathered gourds of wine, and poured a cup, saying: "With this, I exchange your five viscera." Knowing the nation’s troubles were not yet settled, the Master submitted a memorial requesting leave to wander to Chengdu. Delighted by the rugged grandeur of White Cloud Stream on Mount Qingcheng, he built a thatched hut and took up residence there. The stream was, in fact, the site where the Perfected One Xue Chang had ascended to immortality. Soon after, as the imperial court prepared to return to the capital, an edict commanded Guangting to perform a jiao ritual for the Twenty-Four Deities. When Wang Jian established his rule over Shu, he summoned Guangting to serve as tutor to the imperial prince.

King Jian remarked to him, "In former times, the Han had its Four Hoary Ones, yet none compare to my single Master here." Guangting, however, found no joy in palace life and recommended Xu Ji and Xu Jianfu to take his place. Thus, he retired to spend his later years in Chengdu. When Chancellor Xu Guangpu was still a youth devoted to learning, he paid homage to Guangting as a disciple. Guangting once told him, "When I first studied at the Imperial Academy, the National University’s collection was already complete. I began with books on astronomy and the immortals, then turned to the classics, histories, philosophers, and literary anthologies. Within a month, I arranged a fixed schedule for my studies: the first day for reciting the classics, the second for reading philosophers and histories, the third for composition, the fourth for memorizing historical anecdotes, and the fifth for leisure. Each of these five tasks occupied six days of the month. Following this regimen for no more than five or seven years, I mastered the classics and histories thoroughly."

Scholar Wei Ao requested a preface for the collected works of his elder brother, Chancellor Zhuang. Guangting replied, "The Chancellor’s writings are abundant, yet if the collection retains poems of petty sorrow or frivolous elegance, I dare not comply." King Jian appointed Zhang Ge, son of the late Tang Chancellor Zhang Jun, whose literary talent surpassed his contemporaries, though he lacked mastery of historical precedents. In the early years of his rule over Shu, Zhang Ge consulted Guangting on all matters, great and small—for Guangting’s talents extended beyond eloquence to encompass the grand arts of statecraft.

At that time, a Daoist, moved by autumn’s melancholy, sought an audience with Guangting but failed to meet him. One day, Guangting suddenly told his disciples, "The True Palace on Mount Qingcheng is newly founded, and its construction is not yet complete. Last night, I dreamed of attending the Celestial Emperor, who appointed me overseer of the Min and Emei mountains. I fear my time in this world is short." His disciples wept, their sleeves damp with tears. When the True Palace was finished, in the eleventh month of the fourth year of Changxing of the Later Tang (the *guisi* year), Guangting, at the age of eighty-four, donned his ritual robes one last time, bowed in farewell to heaven, ascended the hall, and passed away in lotus posture. His complexion remained warm, his eyes bright, as if still alive. A rare fragrance filled the chamber, lingering long before dissipating.

Guangting had a white dog named Feiyun. He ordered its paws to be coated with sesame oil and wrapped in cloth, saying, "I have heard that a dog with oil on its paws can travel a thousand *li* in a day." Soon after, Feiyun howled several times and died.

Guangting once composed the *Illustration of the Primordial Origin*, *Rhapsody on the Sage’s Chronicle*, *Expansions on the Sage’s Teachings*, *Records of Successive Emperors*, as well as odes, poems, and miscellaneous writings—altogether over a hundred *juan*, all circulating in the world. In all his works, he never failed to take statecraft as his intent. The *Shu Tao Wu* states: "He produced over a thousand *juan* of writings, all grounded in the principle of non-action. Works such as the *Hundred-Verse Poem on Mountain Dwelling* and the two *Rhapsodies on the Dao and Virtue, Reflecting on Past and Present*—ranging from one to fifteen characters per line—proved greatly beneficial to moral instruction."

The Shu ruler Wang Jian initially bestowed upon him the title "Master of Vast Virtue." Later, wishing to elevate his rank and title, Wang inquired into precedent. Mao Wenxi offered this counsel: "In the early years of Wude during the Tang, Qi Pinding was appointed Grand Master for Splendid Happiness. During the Kaiyuan era, Yin Xiju served in the remonstrance office. Thus, he was made Grand Master for Court Consultation, enfeoffed as Duke of Cai, and advanced to the title 'Master of Vast Accomplishment.'" Guangting was subsequently appointed to the Jade Bureau for Transformation. In the first year of Tongzheng, he was promoted to Vice Minister of Revenue. When Wang Yan ascended the throne, he honored Guangting as "Celestial Master of Transmitted Truth," specially advancing him to the ranks of Grand Preceptor, Palace Attendant to the Crown Prince, and concurrently Grand Academician of the Institute for the Veneration of Literature.

Gu Qiu Fangyuan, styled Dafang, was a native of Susong in Shuzhou. From childhood, he was quick-witted and discerning. At sixteen, he mastered the classics and histories, and studied the *Book of Changes* under Chen Yuanwu of Mount Lu. At twenty-nine, he sought the Great Elixir from Zuo Yuanze of Fragrant Grove. Yuanze marveled at him and said to Fangyuan: "Have you not heard Laozi’s words: *My greatest trouble is that I have a body*? For the body arises from non-action and gives rise to action; now, returning to the root is called non-action. As for non-action, to speak of ‘non-being’ is to cling to emptiness, while to speak of ‘being’ is to create obstruction. Clinging to either being or non-being creates stagnation. Only when being and non-being are unified, and the mind is utterly serene, does one approach the Dao. Moreover, the Buddhists take this as the essence of Chan, and Yanzi [Yan Hui] called it ‘sitting in forgetfulness.’ The *Book of Changes* says: *Without thought, without action, utterly still, yet responsive and penetrating.* The principles of all under heaven ultimately converge as one. The scripture also says: *Pursue it, and you do not see its head; follow it, and you do not see its tail.* What is this thing? If you silently comprehend and spiritually realize it, what more is there to seek?" He added: "What a pity—your talent and capacity are so lofty that you could stand as a beacon for the gate of truth." Fangyuan bowed deeply in gratitude and departed. Later, he journeyed to Hidden Truth Cliff in Mount Xiandu, where he served Liu Chujing and studied the arts of cultivating truth and transcending the world.

At thirty-four, he received the esoteric teachings of the *Method of the Celestial Girdle* from Ye Cangzhi at Jade Cloud Palace on Mount Tiantai, and all the secret formulas and arcane instructions were transmitted to him in full. In his spare time from guarding the One and circulating qi, Fangyuan devoted himself to the various works of philosophers and historians. Whenever he opened a book, he would read it through without letting a single word slip from his mind. He often said: "Ge Zhichuan [Ge Hong] and Tao Zhenbai [Tao Hongjing] are my teachers and friends." He edited the *Scripture of Great Peace* into thirty chapters, exhaustively covering its essential principles. His reputation spread ever more widely throughout the Jiang-Huai region.

In the second year of Jingfu during the reign of Emperor Zhaozong of Tang, Qian Liu, Prince of Pengcheng of Qiantang, deeply admired Fangyuan’s virtue and Dao. He sought him out at Great Cleansing Grotto in Yuhang and built a residence to house him. Emperor Zhaozong repeatedly summoned Fangyuan to court, but he declined. Through astronomical divination, Fangyuan had deduced that the lands of Qin would soon be overgrown with brambles and that the Tang mandate was destined for change. Thus, like the recluses Yuan and Qi of old, he refused to emerge from the mountains and never answered the imperial summons. The emperor then issued an edict in praise of his exceptional qualities, bestowing upon him official robes where he dwelt, that he might illuminate the mystic Dao. He was granted the titles *Master of Wondrous Being* and *Master of Mystic Unity*. Spreading the sagely transformation and awakening the benighted, his numinous deeds became widely known throughout Wu and Chu.

From then on, disciples flocked to him from near and far, numbering over two hundred. Among them were Xia Yinyan of Kuaiji, Dai Yinyu of Qiao, Zheng Yinyao of Rongyang, Ling Yinzhou of Wu Commandery, Sheng Yinlin of Guangling, and Zhang Yinzhi of Wudu—all of whom mastered the essentials of the Dao and ascended to its inner sanctum. Guangping’s Cheng Zixiao answered the summons to the Qin palace, while Xin’an’s Nie Shidao propagated the teachings in the land of Wu. Anding’s Hu Qianguang and Lu’s Kong Zonglu, along with ten others, all received the wondrous instructions on refining the spirit through contemplation of the true. Others drew near to the sagely presence or concealed themselves in famous mountains, their names no longer recorded.

On the fourteenth day of the second month in the second year of Tianfu, after bathing and burning incense, Fangyuan sat upright in perfect composure. He awaited the hour of noon and passed away. His complexion remained serene and joyful, his limbs supple and at ease. A rare fragrance filled the air, lingering for three days without dissipating.

The disciples, following worldly custom, prepared the funeral and placed him in the coffin—yet only his empty garments remained, for his body had attained liberation. He was interred beside White Deer Mountain near the Great Cleansing Grotto. Later, both Daoists and laypeople repeatedly encountered him on Immortal Capital Mountain and Mount Lu, where he declared: *"I have left the Great Cleansing Grotto to conceal myself in the Heavenly Pillar Source of Mount Shan."*

Minister Daoyi remarked: Zuo Yuanze’s response to Qiu Fangyuan’s inquiry was excellent, yet his concluding words—*"merely aligning being and non-being, dissolving all distinctions in a state of no-mind"*—still left students unaware of the subtleties between existence and void. Only by recognizing that *"non-being is not entirely void"* and *"being is not entirely substantial"* can one truly harmonize with the Dao. Fangyuan’s attainment, I surmise, went far beyond this.

The *Daodejing* states:
*"Thirty spokes converge at a single hub—
it is the emptiness within that grants the wheel its use.
Clay is shaped into a vessel—
it is the hollowness within that grants the vessel its use.
Doors and windows are carved into a chamber—
it is the void within that grants the chamber its use.
Thus, being provides the advantage,
but non-being enables the function."*
This speaks of non-being.

It further says:
*"The bearing of great virtue follows only the Dao.
The Dao as a thing is elusive and indistinct.
Indistinct yet elusive, within it lies an image;
elusive yet indistinct, within it lies a thing.
Profound and obscure, within it lies an essence—
an essence most true, within it lies certainty."*
And:
*"There is a thing, formless yet complete,
born before heaven and earth.
Silent and boundless, it stands alone and unchanging,
circulating without cease—it may be called the Mother of all under heaven.
I know not its name; I style it the Dao."*
This speaks of being.

Grasping this, one would surely hear Zuo Yuanze declare: *"These words exhaust the truth."*

Nié Shīdào

Nié Shīdào, styled Tōngwēi, was a native of Shè in Xīn’ān. By nature he was keen, pure, and forthright, his words and deeds marked by humility and prudence. He cared for his parents with such filial devotion that he became widely respected in his village. In his youth he took a master beyond the world—this was the elder cousin of Déhuì. When Déhuì left his post as a provincial vice-director to govern Xīn’ān, he chose a scenic spot on the eastern mountain of the prefecture, built a retreat there, and named it the Wènzhèng Mountain Lodge. Shīdào served him with diligence: at thirteen he donned cap and robe, and at fifteen he received the essentials of the Dharma lineage and the cultivation of the True.

Later he traveled to the mountains of Jìxī. He once read in an esoteric transmission about the method of ingesting pine resin, so he and his Daoist companion ascended Bǎizhàng Mountain to gather it. The cliffs there rose sheer for a hundred fathoms, hence the name. From its summit, the four directions stretched upward for over a thousand yards. One night they lodged beneath a pine on the cliff-top. The sky was clear, the moon bright, when suddenly they heard immortal music arising from the southeast, borne on purple clouds. It drifted slowly past, even more leisurely than the music of Shíjīn Mountain. Shíjīn and Bǎizhàng were of equal height, and though thirty li of flat land lay between them, their summits stood within a hand’s breadth of each other. When the immortal music reached Shíjīn, it paused briefly, then three rolls of a small drum were sounded, followed by a full ensemble of metal, stone, sheng, xiao, silk, and gourd. The drumbeats set the rhythm, but the melody remained unknown—its sound soaring and clear, utterly unlike the music of the human realm. It began at the third watch and ceased only at cockcrow. Later, when they asked people at the foot of the mountain, all confirmed they had heard it that night. His companion sighed and said, “Just as we were gathering numinous herbs, we suddenly heard immortal music. Could this not be a response? Truly, this is an auspicious omen of your attaining the Dao.”

Thereafter, he journeyed to Nányuè, where he paid homage at the Jade Clarity Altar and the Azure Jade Altar of the Radiant Heaven. Later he stayed at the Summoning Immortals Abbey and entered the Cavern of Numinous Source. It was spring, and he heard that not far from the former hermitage of the Perfected Master Cài grew extraordinary flowers and trees, and that woodcutters sometimes saw the Perfected Master there. Delighted, Shīdào fasted for seven days. At dawn he set out alone into the mountains. As he walked, he caught the scent of rare blossoms and lost track of time until dusk. Suddenly he found himself beside a great stream. There, a woodcutter sat by the water on the sand. Just as Shīdào hurried to approach, the man shouldered his load of firewood and prepared to cross the stream. Turning, he saw Shīdào and paused, leaning on his carrying-pole. “Where are you going alone?” he asked. Shīdào replied, “I seek the Dao and search for immortals. I have long heard that the Perfected Master Cài dwells in these mountains, and I wish to pay my respects.” The woodcutter said, “The abode of Master Cài lies deep within; no one can reach it.” Shīdào said, “I have climbed vines and scaled cliffs to come this far. If there is a path through the mountains, why should I fear the distance?” The woodcutter said, “Night is falling. Go past this mountain to the east, where you will find homes where you may lodge.” Shīdào wished to follow him, but the woodcutter suddenly stepped into the stream, where the water was shallow. When Shīdào entered, the water became deep and swift, and he dared not wade across. The woodcutter said, “You will not cross this stream for another fifty years.” He watched as the woodcutter walked across the surface of the water and vanished.

Shīdào turned back toward the mountain’s east side and walked over ten li. In the distance he saw three thatched huts surrounded by a fence, with chickens and dogs. As he drew near, he saw a man of thirty, with a complexion of bluish-white, who appeared to be a farmer and lived alone. Seeing Shīdào arrive, the man was surprised that he had come alone through the deep mountains. “My family is all away,” he said. “Why is the master here?” He then asked Shīdào the purpose of his journey. Shīdào replied, “I seek the hermitage of the Perfected Master Cài.” The master of the house said, “Did you meet a woodcutter on the way?” “Yes,” Shīdào said. The master said, “That was the Daoist Cài who just passed by.” Upon hearing this, Shīdào bowed and prayed, saying, “A foolish mortal like myself failed to recognize a sage or immortal. Such is my fate.” Night was falling, and the mountain forest grew dark. With nowhere to stay, he asked, “Where have you come from?” Shīdào recounted his origins in Xīn’ān and his quest for the True. The man then allowed him into his hut. He pointed to a seat by the fire and said, “I happened to run out of food in the mountains and have not yet returned with more.” Shīdào said, “I have abstained from grain for some time and no longer think of food.” Beside the fire stood a cauldron of hot water and several yellow porcelain jars. The master said, “The contents of the jars are edible. Help yourself.” Shīdào lifted one lid—it was tea. The master said, “Pour hot water over it to drink.” When he drank, the flavor was far superior to ordinary tea. After a while, he wished for more tea and tried to open another jar, but it would not budge. He tried all the jars, but none would open. Shīdào was astonished—this did not seem like the home of a villager—but he dared not speak of it. The master slept in another room and did not rise even when the sun was high. There was no lamp or candle. In his sleep, the master said, “This is a lonely place, and I have suddenly fallen ill. I have nothing to offer you. There are many homes in the village ahead; you may go there.” Shīdào set out, but after several li he saw no houses, only perilous cliffs. He turned back, but the place where he had lodged was now lost to him. He walked another thirty li or so until he suddenly encountered an old man. Overjoyed, he invited him to sit on a rock and asked the purpose of his journey into the mountains. Shīdào recounted all that had happened. The old man said, “The father and son of the Cài family both dwell in seclusion in these mountains. The place where you lodged last night was the home of the son.” He added, “Your Dao-qi is strong, but your immortal bones are not yet fully formed. How can you endure hunger and thirst in these mountains for long?”

Suddenly, the old man plucked a blade of grass and handed it to Shīdào—its form resembled ginger sprouts, yet it stretched over a foot long. When chewed, its flavor was sweet and fragrant. The old man then bade him drink from a spring. As Shīdào raised his head, the old man had vanished without a trace. Overcome with sorrow, Shīdào sighed deeply, yet after eating the herb, he felt his qi and strength grow light and vigorous, surpassing even his condition before entering the mountains.

Turning back to follow the mountain path in search of his lodging, he found the way now choked with brambles and vines, impassable. He returned instead to Zhāoxiān Abbey, where the assembled Daoists greeted him with astonishment: “Though this abbey lies near sacred peaks, the mountains teem with beasts and serpents, and few dare travel alone. Why have you been gone for over a month? We have long feared for you.” Shīdào replied, “I left only yesterday and spent but a single night away.” He recounted his encounter with the woodcutter, his lodging, and his meeting with the old man. The Daoists all sighed in wonder, saying, “Though we dwell here together in study of the Dao, we have only heard of the True Man Cài—never once have we been granted a glimpse. Yet you, by virtue of your destined affinity with immortality, have already met both father and son. As for the old man, we have heard that True Man Péng also dwells in seclusion on this mountain. Could he not have been Péng himself? In a single day and night, you have encountered three immortals—yet in the human world, a month has passed. Truly, this is the work of accumulated merit from past lives.”

Shīdào marveled deeply at this and remained at Zhāoxiān Abbey to cultivate and refine his practice for over a year. Later, longing to return home to care for his aging parents, he made his way back to Wènzhèng Mountain. Whenever he ventured into the mountains to gather firewood or medicinal herbs, even tigers and leopards would lower their ears, wag their tails, and prostrate themselves before him. Shīdào would reach out to stroke them, calling them gently, and they would rise and follow at his heels. Sometimes he would place firewood or herbs upon their backs, and they would carry his burdens homeward before vanishing into the wilds. Long ago, Guō Wénjǔ of Dàdí Cave had tamed tigers in much the same way. Since Shīdào’s influence, the mountains near Shè had abounded with fierce beasts, yet they harmed no one.

When his parents asked what he had gained from his travels in search of learning, Shīdào recounted all that had transpired. Upon hearing his tale, they rejoiced, saying, “You tend to us with filial devotion, and we are sustained by your Dao. How fortunate this is for your mother as well! This must be the blessing of good karma from past lives.”

Later, Shīdào set out once more, this time longing to visit Nányuè and Jiǔyí Mountain. He had long heard that True Man Méi and Attendant Gentleman Xiāo both dwelled in seclusion on Yùsǔn Mountain, and many had claimed to see them. Méi was none other than Méi Fú, once magistrate of Nánchāng, while Xiāo was the noble son of the Liáng dynasty, Xiāo Zǐyún. After fleeing the chaos of Hóu Jǐng’s rebellion as governor of Shùyáng, Xiāo had brought his entire family into these mountains, and both men had attained the Dao here.

Shīdào lingered at Qīngxū Abbey on Yùsǔn Mountain, his heart filled with longing for Méi and Xiāo. He ventured into Yùmù Hollow, hoping for even a single glimpse of them, and pressed onward with unwavering resolve, journeying ever deeper into the mountains. Suddenly, he encountered a man dressed in plain cloth and a black gauze hat, his face bearing the appearance of a man in his fifties. Shīdào bowed in respect and asked his name. At first, the man called himself a traveler, then inquired where Shīdào was bound. When Shīdào replied that he sought Méi and Xiāo, the traveler said, “I have heard of your diligent pursuit of the Dao and your pilgrimage to renowned mountains—this is no easy feat. If you wish to meet those two gentlemen, I can guide you.” He added, “Your past karma is strong, and your name is already inscribed in the Jade Register. Though you may not yet ascend in flight, you shall surely transcend this world.”

The traveler continued, “I am Xiè Tōngxiū. I feared you might not recognize me, so I have revealed myself. I once dwelled on Nányuè Mountain alongside Péng and Cài, and three hundred years have passed since then. I know you have traveled to Dònglíngyuán. By chance, the Eastern Flower Lord has commanded me to serve as the Earth Immortal of Yùsǔn Mountain’s forests, overseeing the lands of Qīngxū Abbey as its local deity. You and I share a karmic bond with the Dao, which is why we have met. However, Méi and Xiāo are often summoned by the King of the Lesser Heaven during the day, and I fear they may not return soon—you cannot wait for them.”

Shīdào bowed reverently and said, “A mortal of this fleeting world, I have presumptuously sought the Great Dao, focusing my spirit and thoughts day and night, yet I know nothing of its essential mysteries. Adrift like a man upon the sea, I cannot even discern its shores. Never did I dare hope to meet a Daoist lord such as yourself today—this is the good fortune of eons.”

Tōngxiū replied, “Your sincerity and devotion are deeply moving. Yet your worldly affairs remain unfinished. For now, let me guide you out of the mountains to my dwelling.” They walked several *li* together until suddenly, two thatched huts appeared, neat and pristine. Inside were a bed, a mat, and a small cauldron simmering over a fire, as though a scholar lived there—yet no one was present. Tōngxiū bade Shīdào enter and sit upon a wooden horse, while he himself sat upon a white stone deer. Presently, a youth with flowing hair brought a basin of broth to Shīdào. After sipping it, his spirit and qi felt refreshed and clear.

Tōngxiū then pointed to a shelf and instructed him to take down a scroll. “This is the *Plain Book*,” he said. “Study it without ceasing, and you shall grasp its true essence.” Shīdào wished to remain and study under him, but before he could speak, Tōngxiū already knew his thoughts. “Your parents are advanced in years,” he said. “Though you have an elder brother who can care for them, if you wish to travel further south, you cannot yet stay here. I have a disciple named Zǐzhī, who resides on Jiǔyí Mountain. Seek him out and convey my message. Show him this *Plain Book*, and he will teach you its full meaning. If you do not find him, simply leave the book by Máorú Stream and inscribe a record upon the stone wall of the cave. My words will reach him, and Zǐzhī will impart the essential Dao to you.”

With that, he sent Shīdào on his way. In an instant, Tōngxiū vanished, and Shīdào found himself outside Yùmù Hollow. He returned to Qīngxū Abbey, where the Daoists greeted him in astonishment: “You have been gone for seven days—where have you been?” Shīdào recounted all that had occurred. Two of the Daoists, overjoyed, begged to accompany him back to Yùmù Hollow. When they arrived at the familiar place, the rocks, grasses, and trees remained unchanged, yet the thatched huts were nowhere to be found. They lingered in disappointment for the rest of the day before returning.

Shīdào had obtained the *Plain Book*, its characters legible and clear—all expounding the secret essentials of the Queen Mother of Mount Guī’s governance of the host of immortals.

Those who practice this among the immortals shall ascend to heaven. When passed to mortals, their traces may mingle with the grotto-heavens. Should doubts arise that cannot be resolved, proceed later to Xiāngzhēn Abbey on Mount Jiǔyí of the Southern Marchmount. After more than a month of inquiries along the paths where Zǐzhī’s traces were said to linger, all spoke of a recluse by a certain Máorú Stream—no one knew his name, though some had glimpsed him. Shīdào repeatedly entered the mountains in search, but found no one. Then, following Tōngxiū’s instruction, he left a letter inscribed upon the stone wall.

Later, in a dream, a divine being who called himself Zǐzhī taught him how to dissolve his lingering doubts, and he awoke. Yet after more than a year, he returned to govern, remaining for over twenty. With every act of devotion, he venerated the true-form portraits of the Two Càis, Péng, and Xiè, and on his own silk scrolls, he compiled *Strange Tales* for Daoists and laity alike.

Later, when Emperor Tàizǔ of Wú was consolidating his rule over the Jiāng-Huái region, he heard of Shīdào’s name and deeds and, hoping to benefit from his virtue, seized Guǎnglíng to build the Xuányuán Palace as his residence. Whenever Shīdào ascended the altar to pray for blessings or beseech the heavens, whether for rain or drought, his prayers were never unanswered. So moved were heaven and earth that auspicious clouds appeared in celebration, and he was honored with the titles *Xiāoyáo Dàshī* and *Master of Governance*.

Shīdào’s Dao was rooted in filial devotion, never straying far from his parents. When his mother, who had lived to ninety-five, passed away, he rushed to her side in mourning, crawling on hands and knees to carry the soil and raise her grave. He refused all sustenance beyond what ritual prescribed, then planned to withdraw into seclusion to fulfill his original resolve. Soon after, however, imperial messengers arrived in swift succession, their edicts impossible to refuse. Tàizǔ’s regard for him only deepened, and the entire realm turned to him in reverence.

The disciples Zōu Dékuāng, Wáng Chǔnè, Yáng Kuāngyì, Wāng Yòngzhēn, Chéng Shǒupǔ, Zēng Jǐngxiāo, Wáng Kěrú, Cuī Chánrán, Dù Chóngzhēn, Dèng Qǐxiá, Wú Zhīgǔ, Fàn Kěbǎo, Liú Rìxiáng, Kāng Kějiǔ, Wáng Bǐngxiá, and others were all inner-chamber disciples who transmitted the Shangqing methods. They dispersed across the various prefectures and commanderies, inheriting the true wind to propagate the teachings, and the court bestowed upon them purple robes to honor their Daoist lineage.

Scholars from Qín, Wú, Jīng, Qí, Yàn, Liáng, Mǐn, and Shǔ came in droves, serving with diligence and devotion for over a decade. Shīdào often said to them, *"I possess no Daoist arts—why have you come from such great distances?"* The disciples all replied, *"Just as when Master Zhāng dwelled in Shǔ and the world flocked to him, so too have we followed you."* He guided each according to their practice, imparting the essentials of the Dao.

The disciples performed menial tasks like servants, and only those who remained unwavering for years attained transcendence. Now, they are but descendants of withered bones, their days hastening toward decay. They sought to escape the brevity of life and aspire to longevity, their pleas earnest and unrelenting. Yet Shīdào met all with benevolence, never rebuffing their words. He adapted to their natures and understanding, pointing them toward the Dao’s essentials—like one who walks long through mist and dew, whose garments become damp with lingering moisture, or who draws near to silk and sandalwood, whose body is subtly imbued with fragrance.

Thus, he resided in Guǎnglíng for over thirty years, with more than five hundred disciples. By then, his embryonic breathing had long been perfected, and his elixir refinement had borne fruit. He often wished to return to his native mountains, but the emperor’s favor compelled him, thwarting his long-held resolve.

In the autumn of the year *xīnwèi*, he dreamed of a figure clad in black, girded with crimson, who said, *"Master, your Dao has long been accomplished. Heaven now summons you."* Awakening in a daze, he told his disciples, *"I have been called by the immortals. My time in this world will not be long."*

On the twenty-third day of the tenth month that year, rare fragrance filled the chamber, and cranes stood in the courtyard as if divine spirits had gathered. He took leave and transformed in the Purple Ultimate Palace of the capital, at the age of sixty-eight. A sacred tomb was established outside the Tàipíng Gate, and when his disciples prepared his coffin, a sound arose from within. Upon inspection, it was as if he had shed his mortal form like a cicada’s husk.

Days later, a man from Yùzhāng saw him, accompanied by a youth with hair tied in side knots. Many Daoists and laypeople recognized him and asked, *"Why have you traveled so far?"* He replied, *"I have been away from the Southern Marchmount for many years. I am but making a brief visit."* He stayed in the temples and abbeys of his former travels.

Half a year later, a man from Chángshā reported the same sighting. He added that on the road to Héngyáng, he had seen Shīdào returning to the Cavern of Numinous Source. A woodcutter remarked, *"Fifty years hence, he will pass this stream again."* Truly, the prophecy was fulfilled.

In the third month of the *dīnghǎi* year of Shùnyì, the Grand Preceptor and Duke of Dōnghǎi, Wáng Gōng, in accordance with ritual, escorted his remains back to Xīn’ān. A sacred altar was erected, lands were granted, and his former residence was converted into the Returning to the True Abbey. A memorial was submitted to posthumously appoint him Minister of Ceremonies, bestowing upon him a cap, sword, and ritual vestments—his honors abundant.

Zhāng Yūn, a native of Shénshān County in Jìnzhōu...

Zhang Yun, also named Yun and styled Cangzhen.

His father, Zhang Juqin, and his mother, née Yang, conceived him after she was touched by a black light. After eighteen months, he was born on the sixteenth day of the fourth month in the fourth year of Yonghui during the reign of Emperor Gaozong of Tang. Standing seven *chi* and five *cun* tall, he possessed an elegant and refined bearing, a leisurely disposition, and features as finely drawn as a painting. His speech resonated like a bell. Skilled in the qin and calligraphy, adept at the long whistle, he favored the teachings of the Yellow Emperor, Laozi, and the fangshi.

After his father’s death, when others sought to wed him to their daughters, he fled, declaring, *"I admire the ancient immortal Hongya; henceforth, I shall style myself Hongyazi."* Wandering to Mount Qinggai, he encountered an old man in coarse brown robes who said, *"This is Jingchengzi, your master."* Following his advice, Zhang sought him out and found a man with unbound hair and grass-cloth garments seated upon a flat rock. Zhang bowed twice, and Jingchengzi asked, *"Who sent you?"* Zhang recounted the old man’s words, and Jingchengzi transmitted all his methods to him. He then said, *"South of Gushe lies an ancient cavern where you should dwell. If you obtain the Five Medicines and have the five youths serve you, you will ascend as an immortal."* Zhang journeyed to Gushe, where a divine being pointed out the cavern. There, he indeed found five youths—Ju, Li, Mu, Ge, and Zhuo—who attended him on either side.

For fifteen years, he secluded himself in the cavern, mastering immortal scriptures, secret classics, the Nine Classics, and the works of a hundred schools. A woodcutter once sighed in admiration, so Zhang poured a cup of water onto a stone, which turned to coins when the woodcutter looked—whenever he returned, he found them there. A scholar named Liu Hui marveled at this and followed him, but Zhang vanished without a trace.

Zhang often rode a blue donkey, accompanied by the five youths, traveling to Lingxia, visiting Kunlun, wandering Mounts Zhongnan, Taihua, Qingcheng, Wangwu, and Taihang. He and the two Heavenly Masters, Ye and Luo, explored the arts of the golden elixir and the Flowery Pond, as well as the techniques of transformation and refinement, though none could fathom their mysteries.

During the Shengli era, Empress Wu summoned him, but he did not go. Once, while drunk outside the cavern’s entrance, he awoke to see a divine being over ten *chi* tall, imposing in stature and dignified in attire. The being pointed at him and asked, *"Why do you not study the Great Reclusion?"* Zhang asked, *"What is the Great Reclusion?"* The divine being replied, *"Amid the nine thoroughfares and three markets, where crowds clamor before you."* Zhang asked again, *"Then what is the Lesser Reclusion?"* The divine being said, *"Dwelling alone in forests and springs, at ease in solitude. This was Bo Yi and Shu Qi on Mount Shouyang—such is the Lesser Reclusion. To immerse oneself in the mundane world is the Great Reclusion."* Zhang bowed in assent, and the divine being vanished.

Later, he lodged in Luoyang with Li Jiao, a Gentleman of the Palace, for thirteen years, where scholars and recluses vied to meet him. In the seventh year of Kaiyuan during Emperor Xuanzong’s reign, he was repeatedly summoned but could not refuse. He finally appeared at the Zhanlu Hall. The emperor asked, *"Master, you are skilled in the long whistle—may I hear it?"* Zhang responded with a sound, its ethereal tones stirring the heart and ear. The emperor said, *"How do I compare to Emperor Yao? How do you compare to Xu You?"* Zhang replied, *"Your Majesty’s Dao surpasses that of Emperor Yao, but my virtue falls short of Xu You’s. When Emperor Yao summoned Xu You, he did not come; now, when Your Majesty summons me, I come."* The emperor praised him and appointed him Minister of Ceremonies, later promoting him to Minister of Works, but Zhang declined all offices, saying, *"Why does Your Majesty begrudge me a mountain or a stream, preventing me from following the path of Xu You and Chao Fu?"* That year, in the eighth month, he was permitted to return to the mountains.

While in the palace, Zhang pointed to a white donkey and said, *"This is a thousand-year-old snow spirit."* The emperor thus bestowed it upon him. An edict ordered his home prefecture to renovate his residence in Xiaoyi Village, naming the village Hongya and the neighborhood Zhengjun. Pastureland for his donkey was granted by the Fen River.

Deng Wang Shouli once asked, *"In Huainan, did the chickens and dogs all ascend as immortals?"* Zhang replied, *"Pursuing the Dao and seeking immortality is like waking from a strange dream—father and son, husband and wife cannot share it."* Shouli asked, *"Can one consume the divine elixir and transmute gold?"* Zhang said, *"Wealth, honor, fame, and sensuality are axes that hew the nature; alchemical refinement and transmutation are blades that cut short life. Herbs, trees, metals, and stones are medicines that rot the intestines—these arts are not to be learned."* Shouli asked, *"Are we not fit to be immortals?"* Zhang replied, *"Do not exhaust your form, do not disturb your essence. Be tranquil, desire little, and you may live long, fulfilling your years."* Shouli said, *"I shall heed your teaching."*

Zhang had a refined taste for antiquities, and many renowned figures of the time gifted him treasures. Li Taiyi, Duke of Kaiguo, sent a letter: *"I have heard of your fondness for antiquities and have long admired you. Recently, a man named Zhang, a ninth-generation descendant of Sima Hua of Jin, traveled a thousand *li* to present me with a wooden sandal once worn by Confucius, saying it had been treasured for two hundred years. Gazing upon an object trodden by the Sage, I dared not keep it and hasten to offer it to you."* Tian Youyan, Gentleman Attendant to the Crown Prince, gifted a tortoise once owned by Yin Xi and a ruyi staff once held by Wang Rong. Guo Han, Imperial Censor, presented Wang Lie’s stone marrow and a pair of Confucius’ sandals. Yang Jiong gave a stone inkstone used by Confucius and an iron inkstone used by Yang Xiong. Monk Weigong offered a bamboo staff with joints. Yang Qizhe bestowed Ji Kang’s forging hammer and Chen Ping’s harmonizing steps. Yuan Ting presented several strands of Xie Lingyun’s beard. Monk Zhiyuan gave Cai Yong’s *jiaowei* qin and Ge Hong’s scraping comb. Monk Touran offered the alms bowl of Kasyapa’s skull. Qin Xiuzhuang presented a draft of the *Daodejing* annotated by the Old Master of the River. Liu Shouzhang gifted a deer-antler pillow once used by the Four Hoary Ones. Sima Ziwei gave the mortar and pestle of the Prince of Huainan. Zhou Zigong presented a scroll of ancient imperial portraits. Military Commissioner Zhang Shougui gifted a giant tooth of a sea toad, measuring one *chi* and eight *cun*. Wei Su gave Tao Yuanming’s *Wuming* qin and a lotus crown. Liu Changxin presented Wang Qiao’s sheng.

Zhang ultimately entered the mountains, abstaining from grain and practicing qi absorption. He secluded himself on Mount Gushe and never emerged again. After some time, Li Sizhen, the Inspector of Hedong, and Guo Zhengyi, the Governor of Jin, went to Gushe in search of him. After several days, they found him beneath a pine tree, wearing a horned cap and a deerskin robe, lying in repose.

Then he said, "Why do court visitors press upon this rustic?" The two sighed and said, "Truly a lofty scholar of the rank of Chaofu and Xu You."

He had once annotated the *Laozi*, the *Book of Changes*, the *Three Ritual Classics*, and the *Guliang Commentary*. He also composed the *Records of Lofty Scholars* in ten fascicles, the *Records of Divine Transcendents* in twenty fascicles, the *Records of Hedong* in thirty fascicles, and the *Great Zhou Treatise* in ten fascicles—none of which were circulated in the world.

In the sixteenth year, a great plague struck Hongzhou. A mad Daoist riding a donkey, followed by five youths, dispensed medicine in the marketplace, and the afflicted were cured on the spot. The prefecture, having heard of this, suspected it was Yun and summoned him by post-horse. Indeed, it was Yun. Yet though summoned thrice, he ultimately did not go. Instead, he took refuge at the ancient altar of Master Hongya, coming and going astride a snow-white steed. He commonly wore a black square cap, a red plantain-fiber robe, a black rhinoceros-hide belt, and short boots. The five youths each carried a six-angled fan, an iron *ruyi*, a bamboo staff, a long brimming flask, a perpetually full cup, a carved pomegranate-wood wine comb, and a natural pomegranate-wood ladle—though some say he habitually wore a tangled-hazelwood cap, a six-angled fan, a cloud-drooping hat, a square wooden stool, the *Two Mysteries* book, a mulberry-wood *ruyi*, a Wei Hu flask, and a cypress-wood ladle, with the five youths attending him in all his comings and goings.

He wandered through the cities, drinking and laughing as he pleased, and none could fathom his words. In the twenty-fifth year, a man from Fanyang obtained two great teeth, each one *chi* and eight *cun* in length, and presented them to the throne.

The throne dispatched an envoy to inquire of Yun, who replied: "Recently beneath Kunlun, I saw toads—some as large as a hundred *chi*—likely inauspicious omens."

In the fourth year of the Tianbao era, at the age of ninety-three, on the eighth day of the fourth month at dawn amid a great mist, he underwent *shijie* upon his couch. The townspeople witnessed him ascend slowly with the five youths. That same year, in the eighth month, he again drank heavily with the villagers of Jinzhou, leaving his robes and shoes behind in farewell. On the sixth day, he underwent *shijie* and ascended in the same manner; the people of Jin preserved his sloughed form at Beiyuan.

During the An Lushan rebellion, his numinous resonance aided Emperor Suzong. In the Qianyuan era, upon Shen Taizhi’s report of strange *qi* at Fulong Mountain in Yuzhang, an edict was issued to establish the Yingsheng Palace, where a statue of Suzong was sculpted, and the Master was enshrined alongside him. This is the present-day Ziqing Palace.

In the reign of Dezong, a temple was erected at his former residence in Jinzhou, and another was built at the site of his *shijie* on Hongya Mountain—both now known as Qizhen Observatories.

Three of Yun’s poems survive in the world. The first reads:
*Last year I had no fields to sow,*
*This spring I lack the wine to brew.*
*Let the crows and blossoms mock my plight—*
*Feigning drunk, I lie upon the tower.*

The second:
*Lowly men are scorned, unfit for use,*
*Yet lofty hearts are met with caution.*
*Unversed in the ways of the vulgar age,*
*How am I to conduct myself as a man?*

The third:
*I enter the market not for gain,*
*Nor pass the court to seek renown.*
*At times I mingle with the common throng,*
*And drift along with their ceaseless round.*

From the western springs of Yuzhang’s Bishui Grotto, several *li* onward to the former site of Xichang County in the Sui and Tang, a stretch of several hundred paces of low-lying stone is known as Little Stonehead. There stands a stone jetty called Hongya Fishing Terrace, and a stone pool called Hongya Inkstone Pond, both traditionally held to mark Yun’s study. Yun resided in Yuzhang for eighteen years, and these are the only traces still verifiable.

*The Taiping Guangji* records that during the reign of Emperor Xianzong of Tang, Han Yu was demoted to Chaozhou. Passing through Shang Mountain, he encountered a nephew who had long followed the cloud-and-water path to Dao, and whose whereabouts had been unknown for years. Suddenly, the nephew appeared before Han Yu’s horse, escorting him as far as Dengzhou. There, he said: “My master dwells on this mountain’s Xuanyu Peak, beneath the Emperor’s Canopy, where he serves as Master of the Eastern Garden. He refines the Nine Radiant Elixir from malleable gold and jade-like water, its firing so subtle that he cannot bear to leave it even briefly. I must take my leave here.” Asked who his master was, the nephew replied: “Master Hongya.” The Master of Crimson Clouds remarked: “Master Hongya is known from antiquity, while Hongya Zi lived in the Tang—clearly two distinct figures.” Yet Hongya Zi was also once addressed as “Master” by Emperor Xuanzong. Was the figure Han Yu’s nephew met truly Hongya Zi, or the ancient Hongya? This remains uncertain, though the world must surely hold those who know.

Minister Dao Yi said: Zhang Yun lived among the common folk to nurture his true nature, yet his name resounded throughout court and countryside. Observe his reply to Emperor Minghuang’s question: “Your Majesty’s Dao surpasses that of Emperor Yao, while my own virtue falls short of Xu You’s.” Such was the height of his humility. Since the Five Emperors ruled the world as an office and the Three Kings as a patrimony, the ranks of emperors and kings have differed. How could Minghuang’s Dao truly surpass Yao’s, or Zhang Yun’s virtue truly fall short of Xu You’s? As the *Daodejing* states: “The reason the rivers and seas can be kings of the hundred valleys is that they excel at lying low—thus they become kings of the hundred valleys. Therefore, the sage who wishes to stand above the people must speak as though beneath them.”

Zhang Yun’s words proved prophetic.

The Recluse Fu Xianzong
Master Fu Xianzong of the Immortal Lineage was a native of Chang’an. His father, Lun, served as magistrate of Ziyang. From childhood, Xianzong was bright and drawn to Daoist learning. At twelve, he withdrew to Mount Ziyang. Soon after, a divine being informed him that Jade Table Mountain was a land of fortune, where he might cultivate his practice. Upon arrival, he built the Abbey of Mystic Tranquility as his dwelling. Within a mere twelve-year cycle, armored warriors appeared one day, announcing: “We are the mountain’s guardian spirits. Since your arrival, we have known no peace. Moreover, this is no place for true cultivation. West of the prefecture lies Flat Ridge Mountain, where you should reside.” Xianzong accepted their counsel, mounted a blue mule, and journeyed to Flat Ridge, where he was attended by spirits and gods. There he built a star altar and a quiet chamber, and between them erected a hall to Lord Lao. Emperor Minghuang summoned him to court. At the Jujube Ford of Lizhou, where boats were annually wrecked by the river’s fury, Xianzong arrived at the crossing. Hearing of the people’s suffering, he inscribed talismans on two stone slabs and cast them into the water. The next day, two great fish were found beached on the shoals, their bellies bearing vermilion characters: “Red carp, red carp, born in river waters, refusing to yield to the immortal master—meet your death.” The prefect reported the event, and an imperial edict established a shrine to Xianzong at the ford. Upon reaching the capital, his responses pleased the emperor, who bestowed generous gifts and commanded him to perform a jiao ritual at the Upper Clarity Palace, which the emperor himself attended. Xianzong invoked the Azure Emperor of the East, the Azure Lads, their divine retinue, and the ranked stellar deities, all of whom descended in solemn procession. The emperor, awestruck, asked: “What Dao have you cultivated to achieve this?” Xianzong replied: “I cultivate the Dao by striving to bring peace to people and benefit to all things. I eat sparingly, dress plainly, abide in tranquility, and act with simplicity. Though stirred, I remain clear; though disturbed, I remain pure. By mastering myself thus, all spirits and gods answer my call.” When asked about the golden elixir, he said: “The elixir of liquid gold cannot be consumed at once. Only when merit is complete, conduct perfected, and kindness extended to all beings may one ingest it to attain longevity.” The emperor was greatly pleased. After some time, Xianzong requested leave to return to the mountains. An edict ordered the restoration of his former abbey, which was granted the name “Abbey of the Perfected,” inscribed by the emperor’s own hand. Thereafter, envoys bearing incense and candles were sent without cease to perform rituals at his altar. On the fourteenth day of the tenth month in the third year of Qianyuan of Emperor Suzong’s reign, a voice was suddenly heard in the sky: “The Supreme Lord faces tribulation.” Xianzong asked for water to bathe, then ascended his couch and departed. A townsman, Wang Nian, returning from Chengdu, saw Xianzong riding his blue mule toward Jianzhou, but thereafter none knew his whereabouts. The memorial stele was composed by Song Hun, Vice Censor-in-Chief.

The Daoist Cheng
Of Master Cheng the Daoist, neither his origins nor his name are known; he concealed himself in obscurity. In the late Kaiyuan era of Emperor Minghuang’s reign, an imperial messenger visited the Temple of the Golden Heaven and heard of the Perfected Cheng. Eager to meet him, the messenger awaited his arrival. A Daoist in tattered robes, bearing a cloth sack, approached. When asked his surname, he replied: “Cheng.” The messenger invited him to the post station and inquired about his studies, but received no answer. He provided a horse to take him to Chengdu, where the matter was reported in secret. Minghuang, intrigued by the account, summoned him to court and lodged him in the Penglai Courtyard. When asked about his arts and practices, Cheng remained silent. Soon after, he requested leave to return to the mountains. The emperor consented, and Cheng departed with his cloth sack, drawing laughter from onlookers. Later, it was discovered that the walls of his chamber bore an inscription, which had been scraped and washed but grew ever clearer: “Westward the road to Shu, northward the Yan army advances. Once meant to ascend in broad daylight, now watch the Black Dragon drink from the Wei.” The emperor heard of it but could not fathom its meaning. Within months, he indeed fled to Shu. The events unfolded as foretold.

Daoist Zhao Huizong
Daoist Zhao Huizong was a native of Yidu in Kuizhou. After long years of registration in the Daoist registers, he mastered the *Nine Heavens’ Immortal Record* and the secret methods of the Three Caverns. Later, he dwelled on Mount Guodao. At the end of the Tianbao era, as Emperor Minghuang returned to the gorges, Huizong suddenly piled firewood in the northeast of the prefecture and set himself ablaze. Officials and commoners rushed to witness the spectacle. Seated serenely amidst the flames, Huizong recited the *Scripture of Salvation*. In an instant, he transformed into auspicious clouds and a crane, vanishing into the sky. When the fire subsided, the grass beneath remained green. A bamboo slip was found, bearing two poems. The first read:
Born of emptiness, placed in nothingness,
Essence becomes spirit, primordial qi the body.
Scattered yang brings light, conjoined yin forms the tally.
The form turns to ash and dust, the spirit dwells among the vulgar.

When all defilements are soon to end, all affairs shall be eternally dissolved.

The second poem read:
I ride the steed of time, the sun and moon my guards,
Illuminating the nine heavens, I ascend to meet the Heavenly Emperor.
O my radiant assembly, and my disciples,
False Dao nurtures the form, true Dao nurtures the spirit.
Diligently, diligently—no more need I say.

Zhai Fayan
Zhai Fayan, styled Qianyu, was a native of Yun’an in Kuizhou. Standing six *chi* tall, he took delight in the teachings of Laozi from a young age, cultivating purity and rejecting the five pungent foods. He dwelled in a hermitage in the Jade Stone Village. In the fourteenth year of the Tianbao era of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang, Qianyu was forty-one when he suddenly dreamed of a youth who said, “Two Perfected Ones bid me tell you: tomorrow, go to the stream.” Qianyu awoke with sudden clarity and, at dawn, arrived at the stream, where he saw two figures seated upon a boulder, their bearing transcendent—they were the two Perfected Ones. Qianyu hastened to pay his respects with utmost reverence. Soon, clouds and mist darkened the sky, and the Perfected Ones mounted them to depart, turning to Qianyu to say, “We have recently perused the *Scripture of Numinous Marvels* and learned of your name, so we came bearing a thread. Hasten to the Cloud Ascension Palace, where we shall transmit to you.” Qianyu immediately went, and the Perfected Ones bestowed upon him the three divisions of the sacred writ of the *Lingji*: first, the secret guardianship of the Three Generals; second, the esoteric arts of the Purple Void; and third, the secret methods of the Supreme Alliance of Orthodox Unity. They also granted him one hundred and twenty divine pills, instructing him to consume one at dawn on the first day of the new year, whereby his lifespan would match their number. They further admonished him, “To the west lies the Reservoir Pool, where five dragons reside. You may summon and employ them to benefit all living beings.” Qianyu bowed and received their words. Thereafter, he built a secluded abode and devotedly practiced the three divisions. Thus, the Perfected Ones, along with the lords of the sun, moon, and stars, descended to his chamber night after night.

The villagers drew water from the Jiangxia River, but it was bitter and turbid. Qianyu dug a well beside his hut and summoned a dragon to preside over it. Even in the height of summer, the water remained sweet and cool. Qianyu became renowned for his mastery of summoning. Reflecting on the perilous rapids of the Yangtze in Yun’an—fifteen in all—he performed a ritual to summon the rapids’ spirits and command them to be stilled. That night, fourteen rapids answered his call, but one failed to appear. Enraged, Qianyu insisted on summoning it. When it finally arrived, it took the form of a woman in a towering headdress and voluminous sleeves, who advanced and addressed him with resolve: “Heavenly Master, you act by the mandate of heaven to transform the world. I am but a water spirit—how dare I resist? Yet there is an unsettled matter I must report. Your intent, I perceive, is merely to ease the passage of boats, but you fail to consider that those who labor in boating already profit doubly each day. Though there may be minor costs, they are no great loss. Along this river live three or four hundred humble folk with no fields to till, no mulberry to weave, who rely entirely on hauling goods for their livelihood. If you flatten all the rapids, while it may benefit boats, what will become of these people’s sustenance? The Supreme’s will surely does not intend this. I fear you may incur blame in the future and bring trouble upon yourself. You ought to reconsider.” Qianyu sighed and said, “Your concerns are beyond my reckoning.” He then commanded the spirits of the fourteen rapids to restore their former dangers. That night, wind and rain roared, thunder crashed, and by morning, the fifteen rapids surged with furious waves, just as before.

The military governor of Jingnan, Wang Ji, heard of Qianyu’s fame and personally sought to receive his teachings. That very night, Emperor Daizong dreamed that Ji was wandering with three divine beings. He dispatched the eunuch emissary Ma Chengjing to inquire, and Ji replied with Qianyu’s account. Daizong then said, “I have a Hall of the Six Jia, fashioned of seven treasures, wherein lies a golden casket with jade slips. I have repeatedly sent masters to open it, but the lock remains immovable. Qianyu is a man of the Dao—he should be able to open it.” He issued an edict for Ji to hasten Qianyu’s preparations. Upon arriving in Chang’an, Qianyu spat wine upon the Hall of the Six Jia, and its doors swung open. Daizong was pleased and bestowed upon him the title *Master of Penetrating the Numinous*. Soon after, Qianyu took his leave, and Daizong gathered his court to bid him farewell. Qianyu took a *yue* and placed it upon a jade table. The other Daoists did not know its purpose. Qianyu said, “In my art, the most skilled goes first. Whoever can lift this *yue* shall be my teacher.” None of the Daoists could lift it. Qianyu slowly took it and placed it before them, yet none could raise it. Daizong asked, “What now?” Qianyu replied, “Lifting it is no difficulty—I merely wished to humble these gentlemen.” He then shouted, and the *yue* rose. Daizong marveled greatly. Qianyu then departed, reaching Jiangling in three days.

Upon returning to his dwelling, he found his mother had been killed by a tiger. Qianyu summoned the tiger, and the earth spirit followed, saying, “The Heavenly Master’s mother suffered the Nine Perils and Eight Calamities—it was by heavenly decree that she was slain.” Qianyu flogged the tiger dozens of times before releasing it. Thereafter, he redoubled his efforts to relieve human suffering, refining cinnabar and gold to aid the destitute. In the twelfth month of the tenth year of the Taihe era of Emperor Wenzong, on the first day, he told his disciples, “Five days hence, I shall ascend to the heavens.” At the appointed time, he passed away, and his disciples buried him. At dusk, they heard the sound of bells and chimes in the clouds, which shone in five resplendent hues. Qianyu appeared above them, leaning down to address his disciples: “Strive diligently—do not forget my Dao.” Then, he slowly ascended and vanished. When they opened his coffin, only his clothes and shoes remained.

Fifteen years later, a man named Li Wensheng encountered Qianyu in Yidu, who said to him, “I have briefly journeyed to Qingcheng; upon my return, I shall ascend in the clouds.” In Xinjin County of Yizhou, the Jilong River bears a tree called the Tethered Dragon Tree. The *Fangyu Ji* records: “The immortal Di Shi came from Mount Emei and tethered a dragon here.” This may well have been Qianyu; let those who later peruse widely determine its veracity.

**Volume Forty-One of *Comprehensive Mirror of Realized Immortals Through the Ages Who Embodied the Dao* concludes here**
**Volume Forty-Two of *Comprehensive Mirror of Realized Immortals Through the Ages Who Embodied the Dao***

**Shu Xujī**
Shu Xujī, styled Dezhen, was a native of Kaizhou. His family had long tilled the soil, but Xujī alone delighted in forests and springs, favoring the arts of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi. He served the Heavenly Master Di Qianyu.

Once, the Heavenly Master traveled down the river to the Immortals’ Grotto Abbey, where he discovered the *Divine Writ of the Radiant Staff* in a cave—a text bestowed upon Ge Zhichuan by immortals on Mount Luofu. Qianyu said to Xujī, “This was once secretly obtained by my late master, Song Chongyuan, and its name is recorded in the immortal registers. Though you have now acquired it, you do not yet grasp its essence.” Thereupon, he instructed him, adding, “Before the dual qi, the Dao is the Ancestor. From the Dao, the One Qi generates the Three Powers. Thus, heaven possesses the Nine Yangs, humanity the Nine Origins, and earth the Nine Yins. If one, in receiving life, can return to the Ancestor and guard the Origin, then in resonance and transformation, there is nothing to which one cannot adapt.”

“This text was once bestowed upon Emperor Wu of Han by the Queen Mother of the West. The emperor transmitted it to Li Shaojun, and later the Left Immortal Duke of the Supreme Ultimate obtained it. Ge Zhichuan again received it on Mount Luofu, and my master recovered it from Ge the Immortal Duke on Mount Jun in Dongting. Now I charge you: the Dao of the Radiant Staff rides the Great Culmen, treads the North Pole, gazes upon the Jade Light, follows the Cinnabar Origin, leans upon the Numinous Field, steps upon the Gate of Yang, moves the Primal Net, and grasps the Pivot of Heaven. By wielding the Six Qi and commanding the myriad spirits, one may externally summon gods and internally prolong life.”

Xujī cultivated this as instructed, and all proved divinely efficacious. One day, he told others, “Shu abounds with famous mountains, where gods and immortals gather. I shall journey there.” Upon arrival, he always carried several spoonfuls of ashes in a paper pouch. When asked, he replied, “This can cure a hundred ailments.” To those who sought his aid, he mixed the ashes with his saliva and administered it; no illness failed to be healed.

Once, suffering from mouth sores, he said to others, “Look into my mouth.” He opened it wide as a winnowing basket, revealing all five viscera. Those who saw it were astonished. Later, he entered the Bronze Horse Abbey in Xinfan, where he remained for a long time. He often told people, “Long ago, the Yellow Emperor met with Master Yu and the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign here, gathering the host of immortals. The place was named the Three Assemblies Terrace. A bronze horse lay hidden among the trees, and the Dragon Bridge nearby marks its former site. Later generations built a terrace where the bronze horse was concealed to commemorate it. On clear autumn evenings, the bronze horse would suddenly leap and neigh, and those who witnessed it attained the Dao. I have come and gone from this place for thirty years and have been fortunate enough to see it once.”

After residing there for over a year, he suddenly said to an elderly neighbor woman, “Tonight I shall depart for another place. I wish to entrust my final affairs to you.” Pointing to the ground, he instructed, “Bury me here, digging more than three *chi* deep, and I shall surely repay you generously.” That very night, he passed away. The neighbor woman followed his words and interred him, whereupon she indeed found a *yi* of gold. She reported this to the authorities, who examined the burial site and found only a staff and sandals. Thus, they knew he was a divine immortal who had transformed and departed. In gratitude, the gold was returned to the neighbor woman.

Her son, returning from Linna, saw the empty dwelling. On the bank of the Xinjin River, he placed two sweet melons, inviting her to sit, and they shared one between them. The other he sent to his mother with a message: “After years of troubling you, I now depart far away. We shall never meet again—how could I not feel sorrow?” Only when her son returned home did she learn of his transformation.

The *jinshi* Feng Xiao wrote an account of his life.

**Daoist Xiang Daorong**
Daoist Xiang Daorong, whose origins are unknown, was a man of simple and unrefined manner. He served Xu Jie, receiving from him the *Zhenyuan Celestial Writs*, and his name became widely known in Shu. Once, he wished to cast a white horse and a statue of Lord Lao from thirty *liang* of gold. Two-thirds of the gold had already been prepared, yet he remained unsatisfied, lamenting his incomplete work.

One day, while burning incense and reciting scriptures, an object suddenly fell to the ground. Upon opening it, he found ten *liang* of gold, allowing him to fulfill his vow.

He was close friends with Lü Yi, the vice-magistrate of Huayang. Once, he set out several *dou* of wine and urged Lü Yi to drink, who remained sober until dawn. Daorong then declared the date of his departure from the world, saying, “When the time comes, I ask that you send me off beneath the great pine in the eastern outskirts. Kindly cremate my coffin with firewood as a favor.”

Lü Yi found his precise prediction strange and informed his friends Zhang Sheng and Chang Ji. Together with dozens of others, they marked the appointed day to observe him. The evening before, Daorong visited the homes of all his acquaintances, drinking and laughing until nightfall, when he lodged at an inn. Lü Yi secretly sent someone to watch him, who saw him sleeping as usual. Yet by dawn, he had already transformed, his complexion unchanged.

Lü Yi, Zhang Sheng, and Chang Ji prepared a coffin and lined it with silk at the base of the great pine west of the sandy hollow. They piled firewood and set it alight. As the flames rose, the coffin became too fierce to approach. Then, they saw Daorong emerge above the smoke and fire, slowly ascending into the void.

**Daoist Ren Keju**
Daoist Ren Keju, whose origins are unknown...

At forty, Keju was simple and earnest, carrying his satchel to serve Daorong with utmost devotion. Moved by his dedication, Daorong entrusted him with the *Zhenyuan* talismanic script and esoteric instructions, cautioning: "Only after eighteen years may you reveal its efficacy in averting misfortune or foretelling fortune. Do not seek profit or fame, nor recklessly transmit it. Those who attain this Dao become immortals; those who leak it meet premature death. Formerly, Song Chongyuan transmitted it to Zhai Qianyu, Qianyu to Shu Xūjì, Xūjì to me, and now I transmit it to you—this is the fifth generation. When passing it on, you must scrutinize the recipient’s resolve and conduct; do not bring calamity upon yourself." Keju guarded it in secrecy, sustaining himself with other arts, so none could discern his true attainment.

After twenty years, he gradually began to speak of others’ fortunes and misfortunes, sometimes performing rituals of exorcism or offering. For each divination, he first required the querent to purify themselves through fasting, then arranged lamps against a wall to form the image of the Dipper’s handle. Seated before it, he would perceive the weal or woe, fortune or misfortune, as vividly as if witnessing it firsthand.

During the *Dashun* era of Emperor Zhaozong of Tang, he suddenly told Gao Lusī, magistrate of Huayang: "In ten days, I shall depart this life. I ask you to instruct my disciples to refrain from vulgar rites, for such are forbidden by the Dao." When the appointed day arrived, he passed without illness, and Lusī heeded his words, admonishing the disciples accordingly. The *Zhenyuan* talismanic script and esoteric instructions were never transmitted again.

Program Taixu was a native of Xidui in Guozhou. From childhood, he was devoted to the Dao, his moral integrity unlike that of ordinary men. At fifteen, he ascended the eastern mountain near his home, his spirit soaring as if to transcend the void. Soon, clouds of five colors enveloped him, and celestial music with feathered canopies descended in obscurity. Taixu silently reflected that he had not yet bid farewell to kin and friends when suddenly a thunderclap resounded, and all vanished from sight. Returning home, he redoubled his resolve, his cultivation and recitations growing ever more diligent.

At eighteen, having lost both parents, he abandoned his inheritance and dwelled on Mount Nanmin, fasting until he forgot both body and mind. Months and years passed thus, and two tigers attended him on either side, as if awaiting his commands. He named them Good Word and Good Deed, then imparted to them the Three Refuges. They knelt and obeyed, and from then on, they came whenever he called their names. One night, a great wind uprooted trees amid thunder, lightning, and rain. The courtyard’s foundation collapsed, revealing a pit from which boiling water surged. Stirring it with his staff, he retrieved a double-handled jade seal of deep green. Each year, when farmers sought talismans and registers for bountiful harvests, he would imprint them with the seal, and those who received them enjoyed ever greater abundance. Whatever remained after his acts of charity, he used to build shrines and commission images, keeping nothing for himself.

A Daoist nun named Xie Ziran received his teachings and talismans. After imprinting them, he would conceal the seal, but one day it vanished without a trace. In the tenth year of the *Zhenyuan* era of Emperor Dezong of Tang, Ziran ascended to heaven in broad daylight. In the fourth year of the *Yuanhe* era of Emperor Xianzong, Taixu dissolved his mortal form.

In the fifth year, during the second month, he was interred in the divine abode of Zixuan. His countenance remained unchanged, and his body was as light as an empty robe. Where he had transformed, a single *zaojia* tree suddenly sprouted, its branches and leaves drooping—commonly called the "hanging-head *zaojia*."

In the tenth year of the *Dazhong* era of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang, an imperial envoy traveling from the gorges into Shu passed through southern Min to visit Taixu’s shrine. To his disciples, he recounted: "Last winter, as I passed through Shangshan and lodged at an inn, I stepped outside and saw flowers and trees flourishing upon the ridge. Impulsively, I climbed the rocks and scaled the perilous path, ascending some fifty or sixty steps. Below, rare blossoms lined the way for over a *li*. There stood a residence like an official guest hall, where a youth in blue led me inside. I met a Daoist who called himself Cheng Taixu, saying his ancestors hailed from the Western Dui and that he now rested there. He lingered with great warmth and earnestly urged, ‘Next year, when you return from Shu to Min, do not forget to visit me.’ Now, gazing closely at his image, it is indeed no different from the man I saw."

**Yu Lingzuo**
Yu Lingzuo was a native of Hejian. He resided at the Jiuzhen Abbey on Mount Heng, studying the Dao for over a decade. The Red Lord of the Southern Marchmount took notice of him and transmitted the Way of Returning Wind and the method of Guarding the Bright Beam. After practicing for twenty years, he could sit and perceive the affairs of heaven as if viewing his own palm. Yet he concealed his abilities, refusing to astonish the common folk with marvels, and thus none knew of his spiritual attainment. When conversing with others, he often spoke of his travels across the Four Seas and the Nine Provinces. His appearance remained that of a man in his thirties.

During the *Yuanhe* era of Emperor Xianzong of Tang, officials in Bangzhou heard Lingzuo recount the names, appearances, preferences, temperaments, posts, and lifespans of their ancestors—all accurate. The crowd marveled and paid him reverence, but he merely said, "This was mere happenstance, not something I comprehend." He then withdrew, sealing his gate and refusing to emerge, even when earnestly entreated. Only then did they realize he was an extraordinary man. He frequently recited the *Scripture of the Great Cavern*, sometimes fasting, sometimes drinking wine.

An elder immortal named Pan traveled to the Marchmount and befriended Lingzuo closely. He kept an primordial tortoise, four or five *chi* in breadth, whose strength rivaled that of ten men—those who saw it feared it. Lingzuo later rode it into the Jiuyi Mountains, where woodcutters occasionally glimpsed him.

**Zhao Zhiwei**
The Daoist Zhao Zhiwei’s origins were unknown. He built a hut on Phoenix Ridge of Mount Jiuhua, reciting Daoist scriptures daily. For decades, he wore clothing of grass and ate only wild plants, thereby attaining the Dao. Many followed him, and Huangfu Yuanzhen became his disciple for fifteen years.

During the *Xiantong* era of Emperor Yizong of Tang, Zhiwei refined elixirs and sent Yuanzhen to the capital to purchase ingredients. Yuanzhen lodged at the Upper Clarity Courtyard of the Jade Purity Abbey. At the time, Huangfu Mei visited him daily, inquiring about Zhiwei’s affairs. Yuanzhen said: "Since becoming his disciple, I have never seen him display laziness. He once said that he had mastered the arts of dividing cups to form mist and transforming bamboo to angle for bream—though these are but minor parlor tricks.

Last year, on Mid-Autumn, heavy rains fell, and the disciples lamented that the fine evening would pass without moon-viewing. Suddenly, our master ordered a servant to prepare wine and hastily summoned the students. He asked, ‘Who among you dares ascend Heavenly Pillar Peak to admire the moon?’ Though the students assented, they were inwardly astonished. Soon after, our master emerged with his staff, and we followed. When the gate was opened, the sky had cleared, and the bright moon shone as if day. Grasping vines and bamboo, we stood atop the peak. Our master sat solemnly, while we disciples arrayed ourselves beside him. We raised our cups and chanted several poems by Guo Jingchun on roaming immortals. Some disciples whistled clearly, some paced the void, and one played the zither. We did not return until the moon had set. Yet upon lying down, the wind and rain resumed as before."

Yuanzhen was unmatched in chess and skilled in the arts of transformation. After a long time, he returned to Mount Jiuhua and never emerged again.

**Liu Daoping**

Master Liu the Immortal, styled Daoping, resided at Chongxian Abbey of Jade Bamboo, which is today’s Qianyuan Abbey. As early as the reign of Emperor Wu of Han, Dongfang Shuo memorialized: *"Among those destined for celestial office, only Liu Daoping of Pengcheng shall be chosen."* Thus it is known that Master Liu’s immortality was no mere accident.

From childhood, the Master’s inclinations and conduct set him apart from ordinary men. Whenever households were afflicted by pestilence, he would fashion a bamboo horn, inscribe talismans on palm-leaf paper, and with raised arm cry out commands—whereupon all would instantly recover. In times of drought or locust plagues, his invocations were always answered.

When Huang Chao rose in rebellion and swept southward with relentless force, every city he reached fell. Fearing his savagery, the people fortified the ridges and hills. Yet still they fretted over their weak defenses and scant weaponry, so they hastened to Chongxian Abbey to plead for the Master’s aid. Taking pity, he emerged from the northern slopes of the peaks and dispatched spirit soldiers to repel the rebels. Without brandishing a single blade or loosing a single arrow, they routed Huang Chao’s forces—clear proof of the Immortal’s power.

Thereafter, his numinous manifestations multiplied, until at last he ascended lightly into the heavens.

At the summit where he ascended, a yellow stone remains, traditionally called the "Flying Immortal’s Stone," bearing only the imprint of two sandals in white, marking its singularity.

Master Lian Nie Shao-yuan, styled Bozu, was a Daoist adept. His mother, née Cheng, during her pregnancy, abstained from meat and fish. She once dreamed of a celestial being pointing to her belly and saying, "This child shall attain the fruit of the Dao." Born with exceptional intelligence, he kept apart from other children. As he grew, he developed a refined love for books and history, particularly excelling in the works of Laozi, Zhuangzi, Wenzi, and Liezi.

One day, he traveled to Jinling and became a disciple of the Daoist master Gao Lang-zhao, receiving the precepts and registers. That night, he dreamed of entering a city with solemn and imposing offices. Within, a figure in crimson robes, leaning on a desk, addressed Shao-yuan: "This is the Bureau of Longevity. You may examine your own record." The register read: "Nie Shao-yuan enters the Dao at eighteen. At twenty, he receives the Shangqing Perfect Methods. At twenty-six, he journeys to Mount Nanyue." He closed the scroll and awoke.

Later, returning from Jinling to Mount Wen-zheng, he built a hut to reside in. Disdaining worldly conventions, he styled himself the "Nameless One" and wrote the *Record of the Nameless One’s Thatched Hall*. The world often addressed him as Master Lian.

At that time, the Later Lord of Southern Tang was devoted to Buddhism, honoring monks and nuns with reverence, while showing disdain for those in Daoist crowns and coarse robes. Many, lured by fame and profit, shaved their heads and beards to join the Buddhist ranks. Master Lian submitted a memorial in earnest admonition.

Later, due to his mother’s advanced age, he attended to her with utmost devotion, exhausting himself in care. One morning, after bathing, he declared, "My ancestor Bozu once said: ‘Our family, generation after generation, should cultivate the Dao. Each of you must strive earnestly and never forget the teachings of the Most High.’" Suddenly, four cranes alighted on the roof, and a divine radiance descended from the sky, blazing brightly in all four directions. Those in the city who saw it mistook it for a fire and rushed to the scene, only to find nothing amiss—yet Shao-yuan had already departed. The four cranes and the divine radiance ascended slowly into the distance.

The evening before, he had told his mother, "General Hu is arriving. Prepare wine and fruit for fourteen guests." Soon after, sounds and shadows suggested the presence of seated guests. At dawn, the estate servants arrived, reporting: "Master Lian, accompanied by three Daoists in green robes, rode horses southward, followed by dozens of attendants in resplendent attire." Shao-yuan turned his head and said, "I am going to Mount Nanyue."

He authored the *Treatise on the Nature of the Dao* and *Secret Methods of Cultivating Perfection*. Scholars Xu Xuan and Xu Cuo both praised his works, declaring, "Wu Jun and Shi Jian-wu cannot surpass him."

Xu Zuo-qing was a man of unknown origins.

In the thirteenth year of the Tianbao era of the Tang, on the Double Ninth Festival, Emperor Minghuang was hunting at Shayuan when a lone crane was seen circling in the clouds. The emperor personally shot it, and the crane fell with the arrow still lodged in its body. When it was about ten feet from the ground, it suddenly spread its wings and soared toward the southwest. The crowd gazed after it for a long time, but it vanished from sight.

Fifteen *li* west of Chengdu stood a Daoist abbey, whose halls were inhabited only by those devoted to cultivation. The first courtyard of the eastern cloister was especially secluded. Zuo-qing often called himself a Daoist of Mount Qingcheng, his bearing refined and ancient. Three or four times a year, he would visit the abbey, lodging in the Hall of Empty Virtue to await his arrival. When he came, he would stay for three to five days—or even a full month—before declaring his return to Mount Qingcheng. He was deeply revered by all.

One day, he arrived unexpectedly from outside, his countenance troubled. Carrying an arrow, he said to those present, "I was accidentally struck by this in the mountains, but I have recovered. However, this arrow does not belong to any mortal. The owner will come here next year, and I shall return it then." He left it behind the wall and inscribed the date: "The ninth day of the ninth month in the thirteenth year." When Emperor Minghuang fled to Shu and visited the abbey, he saw the arrow and ordered it brought to him. Upon inspection, he recognized it as his own. Startled, he questioned the Daoist, who answered truthfully. Thus, the crane shot at Shayuan the previous year was none other than Xu Zuo-qing. Upon reading the inscription, the emperor realized that in a single instant, the crane had flown from Shayuan to this place. Thereafter, no one in Shu ever encountered Zuo-qing again.

Thirty *li* east of Wuxing, a lovely stretch of streams and mountains lay between two towering peaks to the north and south, known as Feixian Ridge. Elders of the region passed down that this was where Zuo-qing, wounded by the arrow, had alighted. Below the ridge, the ruins of Feixian Abbey still stood. During the Huangyou era of Emperor Renzong of the Song, the northern envoy Guo Zi inscribed a poem there:

*"The emerald ridge marks the immortal’s path near,
Where azure trees part in the mist.
Often when a crane cries over the crags,
One wonders if a feathered robe descends.
At times, a stone flies from the sheer cliff,
Or a cold pool suddenly thunders—
Surely the arrow from the imperial hunt
Still lingers in the cinnabar terrace."*

Li Xia-zhou was a man of unknown origins, possessed of Daoist arts, his appearances and disappearances unfathomable. During the Kaiyuan era of Emperor Minghuang of the Tang, he was once summoned into the imperial palace. After some time, he requested leave to reside at Xuandu Abbey. The chancellor Li Linfu visited him, and Xia-zhou said, "While you live, your family will prosper; when you die, your family will perish." Linfu bowed, weeping, and begged for salvation. Xia-zhou merely smiled and did not answer, then said, "I was only jesting."

In the final years of the Tianbao era, An Lushan grew arrogant and overbearing, causing widespread concern, though the emperor remained oblivious. One day, Xia-zhou vanished without a trace. All that remained were several poems inscribed on the walls of his dwelling, foretelling Lushan’s usurpation and the emperor’s flight to Shu. No one could decipher them at the time, but later, all came to pass. The last lines read:

*"In the Yan market, all the people depart;
At Hangu Pass, the horses do not return.
If you meet the ghost beneath the mountain,
Bind a silk sash upon the jade ring."*

"The Yan market, all the people depart" referred to Lushan’s rebellion, raised with the forces of You and Ji. "At Hangu Pass, the horses do not return" foretold the defeat of Geshu Han at Tong Pass, where not a single horse escaped. "If you meet the ghost beneath the mountain" alluded to *gui* (ghost), the name of a post station. "Bind a silk sash upon the jade ring" referred to Precious Consort Yang, whose childhood name was Jade Ring, and who was strangled with a silk sash by Gao Lishi at Mawei. All his prophecies were of this nature.

Xie Tong-xiu.

Xie Tong-xiu was originally a native of Yichun Prefecture. By nature gentle and refined, he disliked adornment; hearing of goodness brought him joy, while encountering evil was like plunging his hand into boiling water. He served his mother with utmost filial devotion, always wearing a cheerful countenance. In the early years of the Dazong Emperor’s *Dali* reign, one night he suddenly dreamed of a man in a hempen cap who approached and said to him, "Your bones are not those of an ordinary man—why not study the Dao?" Upon waking, he recounted the words to his mother. She approved of his intent and permitted him to seek the Way.

He then journeyed to Mount Heng, where he requested ordination as a Daoist priest. After a long absence, he returned home to visit his mother, only to find five years of famine and scarcity. His kin had scattered, and his acquaintances had fled. One night, he dreamed again of the same man in the hempen cap, who said to him, "In the celestial division of Luling, there is a Jade Bamboo Mountain—a grotto-heaven and blessed land. Within it lies the Pavilion of Pure Emptiness, a detached palace of the Bureau of Destiny, a realm where perfected beings gather and feast. You should go there to cultivate the Dao."

The next day, his mother again consented. Carried in a litter, he entered Jade Bamboo Mountain, where he built no hermitage but dwelled beneath cliffs and among trees. His sustenance consisted of hazelnuts, chestnuts, peaches, apricots, and lingzhi mushrooms. Thus he lived for nearly half a *ji*. When his mother grew old, he buried her in the family tomb. After sealing the burial mound, he donned straw sandals and took up a pilgrim’s staff, wandering among the peaks to seek the numinous. He never left the mountain caves, wearing only grass and eating only wild plants. If anyone encountered him, he would remove his own robe to clothe them.

For over thirty years, he slept in forests and dwelled in caves, cutting himself off from the world of men. One day, deep in a mountain stream’s source, he came upon a stone stele, some three *chi* in length, its surface overgrown with moss and eroded by rain. Brushing it aside, he saw that the inscription remained legible—it was the text of the Pavilion of Pure Emptiness, composed by Minister Xiao. A hundred paces farther, he found an old site where broken tiles and shattered bricks lay scattered upon the ground. The springs and forests were pristine, the flowers fragrant. There he built a hut, choosing it as his place to ascend to perfection.

Before long, the villagers learned of him and, one after another, helped construct an abbey, which they named *Qingju* ("Pure Dwelling"). Some say that from this place, he delved into the mysteries of the Dao, transmitting its teachings, and disciples from all directions flocked to him in numbers beyond counting. When Tong-xiu entered the mountain caves, he would return after five days or ten, speaking of strange and wondrous things.

In the early years of Emperor Muzong’s *Changqing* reign, he entered Yu Wood Hollow and suddenly beheld a mansion with layered eaves and spacious halls, its whitewashed walls and long corridors flanked by rare trees and divine birds—nothing of this world. His spirit instantly felt refreshed, and he lingered in admiration. Soon, a youth in green robes emerged and asked, "Are you Xie Tong-xiu?" "Yes," he replied. The youth said, "The two perfected ones, Xiao and Mei, have awaited you for a long time." He led Tong-xiu inside, where he saw one figure wearing a purple sash and girded with a sword, seated to the left of the hall, and another in a green sash and holding a bamboo slip, seated to the right.

Tong-xiu bowed twice and addressed them: "I am but an ant in the dust of the mortal world, yet I yearn for the Way of immortality. For thirty-six years, I have toiled in devotion. Today, by some fate, I have reached this sacred realm and stand before perfected immortals. My withered bones are reborn, and I have attained this meeting of the mysterious." Xiao said, "Though your heart longs for the Dao and you dwell at the edge of mountains and forests, the *qi* of pungent and acrid foods has not yet dissipated—how could you remain here?" (Tong-xiu had eaten garlic in his youth.) Overcome with sorrow, he prostrated himself and pleaded unceasingly. The two perfected ones, moved by his sincerity, bestowed upon him five ears of auspicious grain and half a *jin* of pine needles, instructing him to consume them at once. Tong-xiu knelt to receive them and ate half, but could not finish the rest.

The two said, "You should return to your dwelling and await further instructions." Upon his return, in the eighth year of Emperor Xuanzong’s *Dazhong* reign, he suffered from bloody dysentery, which only abated the following spring—this was the sign of his purification from the impurities of pungent foods. On the seventh day of the fourth month that year, he suddenly told his disciples, "Last night, I dreamed that the grotto-palace had summoned me to the ranks of immortals. I shall depart soon." The next day, he passed away. His disciples laid him in a coffin.

That night, he dreamed of his master, who said, "I possess a treasured sword—why do you not follow me?" At dawn, he placed the sword in the coffin, but when he looked, his master’s mortal remains had vanished. Thus, he buried the empty coffin at the northeast corner of the abbey. Tong-xiu was then ninety-eight years old.

In the early years of Emperor Yizong’s *Xiantong* reign, a Daoist from Wen-zheng Mountain named Nie Shi-dao, traveling through Yu-mu Hollow, encountered him. Only then was it known that Tong-xiu had indeed become a perfected one.

**Han Xiang**

Han Xiang, styled Qing-fu, was the nephew of Han Yu, Duke Wen-gong. Wild and unrestrained, he paid little heed to his uncle’s exhortations to study. When Wen-gong urged him, Xiang replied, "What I pursue is beyond your understanding." Wen-gong bade him compose a poem to reveal his aspirations. Xiang wrote:

*"Green mountains, cloud-wreathed caves—
this place is my home.
At midnight, I drink the flowing nectar;
at dawn, I chew the crimson mist.
My zither plays the ‘Jade Melody’;
my furnace refines cinnabar.
The golden tiger guards the cauldron;
white crows feed in the primal field.
A gourd holds the world entire;
a blade of three feet slays demons.
I brew wine for border patrols;
I make flowers bloom in an instant.
Whoever can learn from me
shall witness the immortal blossoms with me."*

Wen-gong read it and teased, "Can you truly seize the workings of creation?" Xiang replied, "This is a trifling matter." Wen-gong opened a wine vessel, and Xiang took up soil, covering it with a basin. After a long while, two blossoms emerged—jade-green, resembling peonies but larger, their hues radiant. Between the petals appeared a couplet in golden script:

*"Clouds veil the Qin Ridge—where is my home?
Snow chokes Blue Pass—my horse will not advance."*

Wen-gong did not grasp its meaning, but Xiang said, "Time will prove its truth." Then he took his leave.

Before long, Wen-gong was demoted to Chaozhou for his memorial on the Buddha’s relic. One day on the road, amid falling snow, a man suddenly appeared through the storm—it was Xiang. He said, "Do you recall the lines on the flowers? They foretell today’s events." Wen-gong asked where they were, and Xiang replied, "This is Blue Pass." Sighing deeply, Wen-gong composed a poem:

*"A single memorial submitted at dawn to the ninefold heavens,
by dusk, I am exiled eight thousand leagues to Chaoyang.
I sought to purge corruption for a sagely reign—
how could I, feeble and worn, cling to these fading years?
Clouds veil the Qin Ridge—where is my home?
Snow chokes Blue Pass—my horse will not advance.
Knowing you have come from afar with purpose,
tend well to my bones by the miasmic river’s edge."*

They lodged that night at Blue Pass’s posting house, and only then did Wen-gong believe the Dao was no deception. When Xiang prepared to depart, Wen-gong tried to detain him, but in the end, he wrote a farewell poem:

*"Since ancient times, many have been called to serve the world—
yet who among them rivals your prodigious talent?
Wait until your name and deeds are fulfilled,
then withdraw to the misty wilds beyond."*

Xiang’s parting poem read:

*"The world is drunk on fame and gain,
while I alone awaken to the Dao.
One day, I shall ascend in flight,
piercing the autumn sky—a speck of blue."*

Xiang said to Wen-gong, "You journey to a land of miasmic poison—it will be difficult to preserve your health." He took out a gourd of medicine and said, "Take one pill, and it will shield you from the noxious vapors." Wen-gong replied, "I truly fear I may not escape death, my soul wandering beyond the seas. The thought brings tears to my eyes. I dare not hope for wealth or rank again—if only I might live to pass through Ghost Gate Pass, it would suffice." Xiang said, "You will not remain there long. Not only will your family be safe, but you shall be restored to office." Wen-gong asked, "Will we meet again?" Xiang replied, "Our prior agreement remains uncertain." Later, all came to pass as he had foretold.

**Xuan-yuan Ji**

Master Xuan-yuan Ji of Mount Luo-fu was a man of unknown origins. He dwelled on Mount Luo-fu, and it was said he had lived for centuries, yet his complexion remained youthful, his hair so long it trailed upon the ground. When he sat in a dark room, his eyes emitted beams of light several *zhang* in length. Whenever he gathered herbs in the cliffs and valleys, venomous dragons and fierce beasts followed him as if to guard and protect. Though he was often invited to over a hundred households for vegetarian feasts, he would arrive at each without fail, as if dividing his form. When drinking with others, he would produce a single pot no larger than one or two *sheng*, yet no matter how many guests filled the hall, the wine flowed endlessly for days. If he commanded someone to drink, they could consume a hundred *sheng* without intoxication. At night, he would hang his hair over a basin, and wine would drip forth in a steady stream, its fragrance of yeast and malt undiminished. If he wrote talismans in vermilion, they could summon things from a thousand *li* away. When he brushed the sick with a cloth, they would recover at once.

Emperor Xuan-zong summoned him and asked, "Can long life be attained?" He replied, "Abandon sensual pleasures, temper rich flavors, find joy in simplicity, and practice virtue without partiality. Then you will naturally align your power with Heaven and Earth, your brightness with the sun and moon. Even the Dao of Yao, Shun, Yu, and Tang can be achieved—how much more so long life and enduring vision?" The emperor asked, "How do you compare to Zhang Guo?" He answered, "I know nothing of others, only that I am younger than Guo."

As he withdrew, the emperor tested him by covering a white magpie with a golden basin. Ji was resting outside when he said to the eunuch, "How can the emperor make this old man divine what is hidden?" The eunuch did not understand, and the emperor summoned him again, urging haste. As Ji reached the jade steps, he said to the emperor, "The white magpie beneath the basin should be released." The emperor laughed and said, "You knew it all along." He ordered Ji to sit before the imperial dais and had palace attendants serve him tea.

Ji’s appearance was ancient yet unadorned. Those who laughed at him would suddenly find themselves with crimson lips and the visage of a maiden of sixteen, only to transform in an instant into withered crones—skin sagging, hair ashen—weeping uncontrollably. The emperor ordered Ji to undo the spell, and they reverted to their former selves.

The capital had never seen *dou-lu* or lychee blossoms. When the emperor mentioned this, in moments both flowers arrived—hundreds of blooms each, branches lush and leaves as if freshly trimmed.

Once, when examining lychees, Ji said, “Beneath my mountain grows a finer variety.” The emperor replied, “I have never tasted them.” Ji then took a jade bowl from before the imperial seat, covered it with a jeweled tray, and in an instant lifted the tray to reveal lychees beneath. The emperor ate them and marveled at their unmatched sweetness.

The emperor asked, “How many years will I reign?” Ji took up a brush and wrote forty characters. Each set of ten formed a line, and the emperor laughed, “How could I hope for forty years?” Yet when he passed, it was indeed fourteen years later.

After some time, Ji requested to return to his mountain. The emperor sent an attendant to escort him. Along the way, Ji was seen drawing coins from a cloth sack to give to the poor; by the time they reached Jiangling, he had dispensed tens of thousands, yet the sack never emptied. Before reaching the mountain, he vanished without a trace. The attendant, alarmed, soon received word from Nanhai that the master had returned to Mount Luofu.

**Xiong Derong**
The Perfected Master Xiong, named Derong and styled Daguang, was a native of Jingzhou. From childhood, he was indifferent to worldly desires, abstaining from meat and strong flavors, his resolve sharp with a longing to transcend the mundane. At thirteen, he left home to seek the Dao, enduring hardship and toil across a thousand *li*. All who saw him marveled.

Later, when he reached Mount Jiuyi, he suddenly encountered a man by the roadside—his hair green, his complexion crimson, his eyes luminous and bright. Suspecting this was no ordinary person, Derong approached and questioned him, but the man only murmured in assent without speaking. Then, taking Derong by the hand, he led him deep into the mountains until they reached a stone chamber. There, he seated Derong and said: *"The Dao abhors杂乱;杂乱 brings disturbance, disturbance brings sorrow, and sorrow cannot be remedied. Thus the sage first cultivates it within himself before extending it to others."* He added: *"It endures like an unbroken thread, yet its use is never exhausted."* Then he declared: *"Your bone structure foretells your eventual attainment of immortality, though not yet."* With that, he reached into his waistband, drew out a gourd, and poured wine for them to drink, saying: *"We shall meet again one day—strive on, strive on!"* Then he entered the chamber. Derong waited for days, but the man never reemerged. For months afterward, he wandered in melancholy, lost in thought.

In the early years of Emperor Xuānzōng’s *Taizhong* era, Derong traveled to Mount Lu, where he took up residence at the Abbey of Simplicity and Stillness. There, he would sit in meditation in a solitary chamber, motionless all day, leaving others to wonder at his practices. In the second year of Emperor Yìzōng’s *Xiantong* era, he departed this world.

Several days after the burial, a Daoist priest returning south encountered Derong on the road, walking alone with a silk headscarf and a flowering staff. The priest asked where he was going, and Derong replied, *"I am bound for Mount Jiuyi to seek my master."* The priest returned home and recounted the meeting. When they opened the coffin, they found nothing inside but a single hairpin.

Earlier, those who had followed Derong—such as Chancellor Li Jue, Chancellor Cui Zhi, and Prefect Yu Dehui—all revered his Way and called themselves his disciples.

**Liu Deben**
Liu Deben, styled Xiaoshu, was a native of Ezhou. Skilled in many arts and fond of antiquity, he once inscribed the Six Classics and the histories of the philosophers in seal script. Though his family was wealthy and noble, he sought no official position, instead traveling the great rivers as a merchant.

In the second year of Emperor Xizong’s *Qianfu* era, Huang Chao sacked Ezhou, and the Yangtze region was thrown into turmoil. Judging that he could not return home, Deben abandoned his house and boat, taking to the roads by land. That year, famine was severe, and many starved. Deben distributed the tens of thousands of *shi* of rice he had been transporting, saving over ten thousand households. He buried the dead, and his virtue was admired far and wide.

Later, he took refuge at the foot of the Five Old Peaks, on the southern slope of Mount Lu. One day, a Daoist with unbound hair and a deer-fur robe came to visit, refusing to give his name. Deben welcomed him with poetry and wine, and they enjoyed each other’s company. After some time, the Daoist took Deben by the arm and led him into a deep ravine. Suddenly, they saw an old man leaning on a staff among the rocks. Deben bowed twice, but the old man did not respond. Slowly, he asked, *"What brings you here?"* Deben recounted his journey. The old man seemed about to speak, then said, *"Go to the rear courtyard."* They walked together for four or five *li* until they saw another gate, its vermilion and azure hues radiant, inscribed in gold with the words *"Gate of Purple Radiance of the Primordial Essence."* Beyond it rose tiered pavilions and connected halls, guarded by stern sentinels who barred Deben from advancing. Overawed, he dared not lift his gaze. As he hesitated, the old man said, *"This is the Grotto-Heaven of Chanting Perfection. The Celestial Envoy, the True King, surveys the mortal realm. Because of your good deeds, you are permitted to come here. Your name shall be recorded in the Celestial Register of Immortals, and you will transcend the world without dying."*

Deben bowed again and asked, *"Where does the Celestial Envoy, the True King, reside?"* The old man replied, *"You have lived through four lifetimes, and your karmic burdens remain heavy. Your bone structure is not yet purified—it is not yet time to ask. You must strictly uphold the precepts, clarify your mind and spirit, aid others, and benefit all beings. The True King perceives even the subtlest deeds. One day, he will surely lift you to transcendence."*

Deben bowed in gratitude. Before he could blink, the old man vanished. Returning to his former lodging, Deben asked the Daoist, *"Who was that immortal elder?"* The Daoist answered, *"He is the spirit-official of the Grotto of Chanting Perfection, a guardian of the Celestial Envoy, the True King. Since you have once entered the divine precincts and received solemn instruction, I must now take my leave of you."*

Thereafter, Deben wandered among the Five Sacred Peaks and other blessed mountains. One day, auspicious clouds and auspicious cranes encircled his dwelling. Deben then ascended in flight, and from that time on, he was called *"Immortal Elder Liu."*

**Li Guizhen**
The Daoist Li Guizhen’s origins are unknown. In the late Tang, he traveled to Hongzhou’s Xinguo Abbey, where he saw an imperial edict of Emperor Minghuang displayed in the Hall of the Three Officials. The edict praised the exquisite craftsmanship of the clay statues, but the caretakers had not guarded them well, and sparrows had soiled them with droppings. Guizhen then painted an osprey on the wall, and from that time on, no sparrows perched there again.

Later, someone saw Guizhen ascending to immortality on Mount Luofu.

Zhu Taochui, styled as *Taochui* in the alchemical retreats of Lingquan’s Fenglian Mountain, attained the Dao and realized the fruit of immortality. Yet he took no delight in ascending in flight, instead mingling among woodcutters and herdsmen, moving between cities and mountains, ever mindful of saving the world and delivering others. The marvels witnessed by those who encountered him defy easy recounting.

Another account holds that he achieved the Dao on Yuzhen Mountain in Shu, leaving behind works such as *Inscription on Nurturing Life*, *Rhapsody on the Thatched Cottage*, *Water Melody Song*, and *Autumn Stirring the Courtyard*, among others. In essence, these writings describe the joys of reclusion and the secrets of inner alchemy.

*The Chronicles of Shu* states: The Daoist Zhu Taochui once visited Wang Chuhui. At the steps before the hall, he drew his sword to turn the earth and planted three flower seeds. In an instant, three blossoms bloomed. Taochui said to Chuhui, "These are the *Banner Flowers of the Immortals*—an omen of your wealth and nobility." Chuhui later governed Shu’s three commanderies, retiring as Grand Tutor to the Crown Prince, just as Taochui had foretold.

Many in Shu revered him. Later, someone commissioned a painter surnamed Xu to capture his likeness. Xu, who had never known what Taochui looked like, struggled to begin. Then, one day, an old man in tattered robes, his face gaunt, arrived with two young attendants. "I am the Perfected Zhu," he said. He then took from the attendants’ satchel a yellow Daoist robe, a deerskin cap, and a white jade hairpin. Donning the cap and changing into the robe, he sat upright, stroking his face until his complexion became youthful. He tugged at his beard, and it turned black at his touch, revealing a handsome, imposing figure—his bearing ethereal, his spirit transcendent. One attendant appeared most peculiar, the other strikingly refined. In an instant, their forms transformed.

The painter, astonished, exclaimed, "I did not know a divine immortal would descend!" The Daoist said, "Render my spirit in your shop. If anyone seeks to purchase it, ask only for a thousand coins." Later, someone recognized him, saying, "This is Zhu Taochui from *The Traditions of Divine Immortals of the Tang*."

Afterward, those seeking the painting came in droves. Xu raised the price to two thousand coins, whereupon he dreamed of the Daoist saying, "Your blessings are limited—how can you demand more?" He then struck Xu’s left cheek. When Xu awoke, his head was permanently tilted. He bowed before the painted image, repenting his greed and refusing to raise the price again. Thereafter, in Shu, Xu’s lopsided depiction of the Perfected Zhu became renowned as a masterpiece, and it was said that the Perfected had been enfeoffed as *Marvelously Responsive and Efficacious Perfected Lord*.

**Autumn Stirring the Courtyard**

In the late Tang, there was a mad Daoist of unknown origin, who concealed even his name.

In Chengdu, the mad Daoist suddenly visited the Purple Ultimate Palace to call upon Master Du Guangting, seeking a place to lodge. The master assented but did not provide one. The Daoist was seen daily selling medicines in the market, using whatever coins he earned to buy wine and drink, singing only the lyrics of *Autumn Stirring the Courtyard*. His intent was to lament the impending fall of Shu, as autumn withers the garden. Yet none understood him, and people simply called him the *Autumn Stirring the Courtyard* Daoist. For half a year, no one suspected he was extraordinary.

One evening, returning deeply drunk as night drew late, his singing grew ever louder. Those who found it strange peered through the door and saw a dazzling scene: lamps and candles ablaze, tables and vessels arrayed in splendor. The mad Daoist was attended by two blue-clad youths standing at his side, pouring wine as he sang. The onlookers reported this to Master Du, who then knocked at the door, saying, "Guangting’s capacity and knowledge are shallow. I never imagined an immortal would deign to visit—this is a grave transgression. Yet, unworthy as I am, I prostrate myself at your gate, hoping for a glimpse of your radiant presence to dispel the dust of my hindrances."

The Daoist replied, "Why such earnest humility? I shall come forth to receive you." He then instructed the two youths to gather the tables, vessels, and all the furnishings before them. As they did so, the objects shrank in their hands to the size of talismans and were placed inside his cap. Next, he pressed the two youths down like wooden puppets, reducing them to the length of a thumb, and tucked them into his cap as well. When the door opened, Master Du entered with reverence, but the room was empty.

Du bowed and sought instruction. The Daoist said, "Your cultivation has not yet reached fruition; you must further refine your true heart. I now leave you with three wine cups and two jade candles. These cups are the pits of peaches from the Southern Sea, sized like goblets. When struck, they emit a clear, golden chime. Their surfaces are carved with patterns resembling a hundred flowers, their radiance translucent, their interiors and exteriors gleaming white. Keep them as tokens, and await your destined meeting in three years." With these words, he transformed into a streak of fiery light and soared into the sky.

**Bian Dongyuan**

Bian Dongyuan was a native of Luoyang. From youth, he admired the learning of Laozi and Zhuangzi and thus entered the Daoist register. He traveled the four directions, selling medicines to sustain himself.

One day, Bian Dongyuan ascended the E’ Ridge of Mount Song, where he encountered a scholar carrying several scrolls on a wooden tablet and a large gourd flask. Together, they rested beneath an ancient pine. Dongyuan asked, "Where are you bound?" The scholar replied, "To Songyang to pursue my studies. If you have acquaintances there, I would be grateful if you could introduce me to your esteemed teacher with a letter of recommendation." Dongyuan agreed.

The scholar then said, "The wine in my flask—might I offer you a drink?" Dongyuan answered, "I have long been fond of wine; your invitation honors me." Thereupon, he drank over ten cups in succession and became intoxicated. The scholar said, "I have a method to sober you, though you must not be alarmed." He took the wooden tablet, polished it, and in an instant, it transformed into a sword. Then he said, "May I borrow your liver to inscribe upon it?" Terrified, Dongyuan sobered at once and prostrated himself, begging for mercy. The scholar observed, "You possess the bearing of an immortal and the bones of a Daoist, yet you have not yet met your destined master." With that, he brandished his sword and soared into the sky, tossing down a scroll. He said to Dongyuan, "Keep this, and come visit me at Five Clouds Stream."

When Dongyuan unfurled the scroll, he found several sheets of five-colored paper and twenty tea-grinding pestles, though their meaning eluded him. At the end of the paper was a quatrain:

*By chance we met on E’ Ridge’s side,*
*Shared wine and spoke of mysteries profound.*
*I meant to teach you swordplay’s art,*
*But you, lost soul, lacked fate’s green ground.*

Dongyuan sighed over his missed encounter, feeling as though he had lost something precious. Wherever he went, he asked people, "Do you know the way to Five Clouds?" Most took him for a madman and ignored him. After some time, he returned to Luoyang, entered the water while drunk, and did not emerge.

Later, a traveler from Heng and Xiang arrived, and Dongyuan entrusted him with a letter at the Southern Marchmount Temple to deliver to his friends and kin in Luoyang. The script bore the distinctive brushwork of his own hand. Those fond of such matters all remarked that he had dissolved into water.

**Li Zhen**

The Daoist Li Zhen was of unknown origin, dwelling in reclusion west of Mount Hua in Qizhou. Wang You, whose family wealth numbered in the tens of thousands, often maintained a guesthouse to welcome scholars from all directions, providing fine delicacies and wine without stint. Zhen arrived bearing a zither and a medicine gourd to call upon You, who then welcomed him into his residence.

Zhen asked, "Your wealth affords you the pleasures of a marquis or earl—yet what if you are not a worthy man?" You smiled and assented. Zhen continued, "Do you keep this empty hall and set out food in hunger for worthy men—or in hunger for the hungry? If for the hungry, then fortunately the world today suffers no shortage of the starving. If for the worthy, then I have yet to hear of your finding one. Thus I know you are not a worthy man myself—do not be surprised by my words. I only fear you pursue an empty reputation while lacking the substance of one who truly awaits the worthy. If you can awaken to this, my words will not have been in vain."

You’s expression shifted, and he bowed twice, saying, "I have heard that all human joys have their purpose. Those who study the arts of persuasion must harbor ambitions of roaming as advisors; those who read military strategy must hold the heart of a warrior. Yet I carry only a zither and a gourd of medicine—could there be no intent in this?" He continued, "The zither: I know it bears the ancient spirit, and I wish to return men to simplicity, to curb their frivolous excess. The medicine gourd: I know men suffer many illnesses, and I wish to ease their pain and grant them enduring peace. Moreover, my zither does not transform me—it transforms others; my medicine does not preserve me—it preserves others. Though you use your abundance to aid people, this differs from those who amass wealth through plunder and injustice. Yet even so, this is how the noble and powerful of old treated scholars—you have not yet done so. The key lies in distinguishing the worthy from the unworthy, and thus your person may remain free of entanglements."

You bowed again, and Zhen then called for wine, pouring for himself. By dusk, he was drunk and departed. Wang Qian, watching in secret, saw Zhen transform into a great stag and bound westward, vanishing without a trace.

---

Zheng Ao (styled Yun sou) was a native of Baima in Huazhou. To avoid the taboo of Emperor Mingzong of Later Tang’s personal name, the world knew him by his courtesy name. In his youth, he studied diligently and excelled in literary composition. At the end of the Tang, he sat for the imperial examinations but did not pass. As the realm descended into chaos, he resolved to cast off worldly ties and depart. He wished to take his wife and children into reclusion with him, but his wife refused, so Ao entered Mount Shaoshi and became a Daoist. His wife sent him letters urging him to return, but he never once glanced at them, casting them into the fire instead. Such was his renunciation of worldly burdens. When his wife and children died one after another, he wept once upon hearing each news and then ceased.

Two azure youths, a crane, and a zither followed him. Ao was close friends with Li Zhen, a powerful minister of the Liang court. Zhen wished to secure him an official post, but Ao refused. Later, when Zhen was exiled to the south after falling from favor, Ao walked a thousand *li* to visit him. From then on, those who heard of this held his conduct in even higher esteem.

Ao heard that on Mount Hua, resin from the five-needle pine had seeped into the earth, transforming over a thousand years into a medicine that could expel the Three Corpses. Thus he moved to the northern slopes of Mount Hua to seek it. He befriended the Daoists Li Daosheng and Luo Yinzhi, forming a bond of "mist and vine" friendship. The world regarded them as the Three Eminent Recluses. Ao tilled the fields, Yinzhi sold medicine to support himself, and Daosheng possessed the art of fishing without bait and could transmute stone into gold. Ao tested this once and believed it, though he did not seek it for himself.

All three loved wine and poetry, excelled at *weiqi*, and were skilled in the long whistle. Ao had a large gourd, said to ward off cold and heat. When wine was placed inside, its flavor remained unchanged over time. Each day, he wandered among flowers, trees, waters, and rocks, sipping and reciting verses. Once, in the midst of revelry, they composed linked verses. Zheng said:
*A gourd holds a treasure named in heaven above,*
*Two men in the world without cares to move.*
Luo replied:
*Drunk beyond Cloud Elder and Yinzhi’s sway,*
*Who knows where true nature may hold its way?*

When Emperor Gaozu of Later Jin ascended the throne, he dispatched envoys to appoint Ao as Remonstrance Grandee. Ao claimed illness and declined, submitting a memorial in refusal. The emperor, admiring him all the more, bestowed the title "Master of Carefree Wandering" and granted him the rank of Remonstrance Grandee in retirement, along with a monthly stipend. Ao once composed a thousand-three-hundred-word poem on wine, which scholars of renown across the land transcribed onto silk scrolls to present to him. Others sent artists from a thousand *li* away to secretly paint his likeness on screens and partitions. Such was the esteem in which the world held him.

In the final years of the Tianfu era, at the age of seventy-four, he passed away in peace.

The poems he composed were collected by the dynastic historian Xue Juzheng, who compiled and prefaced them under the title *Imitating the Peaks Collection*, which circulated in the world.

Daoist Li Shouwei
Daoist Li Shouwei’s origins are unknown. He often wandered in Shu, skilled in nurturing *qi* without eating, and moved swiftly as the wind. Fond of wine, his conversations were full of wit, and he paid no heed to minor conventions, so people often slighted him. One day, he suddenly told others: “I wish to roam the Five Sacred Mountains—now I depart.” When asked about methods for seeking profit, he replied: “This floating life passes in an instant; one should seek truth and visit the Dao, casting off the dusty net. As for absorbing *qi*, refining elixirs, eating magic mushrooms, or fasting—all are beneficial. Why fixate on profit-seeking arts?” Then he vanished.

Some regretted his departure and reported it to the ruler of the false Shu, who ordered a search, but he was never found. Long after, someone saw him in the Liang-Song region, or in Wu and Chu, his appearance entirely unchanged. He told people: “I have just come from the Eastern Sea and now wish to go to the Southern Sacred Mountain.” Later, he was seen no more.

He was on good terms with Han Yu of the Bureau of Sacrifices, who presented him with a poem:
*Ever youthful though the years grow old,*
*Poor and cold, you wander noble halls.*
*Refined, your upright* qi *grows mighty,*
*Nurtured, your primordial spirit strays not from the Dao.*
*Feathers of crane and crow drag your dry mat,*
*Your staff, gnarled as twisted teeth, bears your steps.*
*Why cling to reclusion and not return?*
*Where have all the peaches of immortality bloomed?*

Peng Xiao of Feihe Mountain in Changli, originally surnamed Cheng, was a native of Yongkang in Western Shu. From youth, he devoted himself to self-cultivation, styling himself Master Zhenyi. He was on good terms with He Wuyun, the Bamboo-Striker. During the Later Shu dynasty, he passed the imperial examination in the classics and was repeatedly promoted, eventually becoming magistrate of Jintang. He encountered an extraordinary person from whom he received the alchemical formula, and went on to annotate the *Classic of the Hidden Correspondence*, the *Triple Concordance*, the *Golden Key*, and the *True Unity Formula*. He inscribed talismans to heal the sick, which became known as the "Iron Fan Talismans." He could let out a long whistle that sounded like the cry of a phoenix, and when birds in flight heard it, they would all come to him. King Meng Shou of Shu repeatedly summoned him to inquire about longevity and enduring vision. Peng Xiao replied: "To govern the state with benevolence and righteousness, to make one’s name like that of Yao and Shun—this is the Way of eternal life, never to die." He was repeatedly promoted to Vice Director of the Bureau of Sacrifices, judicial officer of Shuzhou, and acting military governor. He died in the twelfth month of the seventeenth year of Guangzheng, but even after ten days, his complexion remained as if alive. Later, someone saw him on Qingcheng Mountain, standing atop a pine tree and flying away. *(From the* Shu Tao Wu.)*

Tan Zixiao, the Feathered Guest of the Golden Gate, surnamed Tan and named Zixiao (also called Zilei), was originally from Beihai. His great-grandfather was a Daoist adept in the Tang dynasty. Zixiao was born in Jinling. His physique was imposing, his spirit keen and elegant; he walked with the gait of a tortoise and the stride of a crane, with round eyes and a square beak. His forehead bore the character for "auspicious," and his palms showed the pattern of a well—all marked him as extraordinary. He was well-versed in the Six Classics, the hundred schools, and the secret and numinous scriptures. He traveled south to Yunsun Mountain to become a Daoist, and later encountered an extraordinary person who taught him the arts of observing the Dipper, flying talismans, and the "Lantern-Watching" method of defense—all of which proved efficacious. From then on, his name resounded across the rivers and lakes, and people flocked to him like water.

He then entered Min, where Wang Shenzhi, the ruler of Min, treated him with great reverence. He was first appointed Master of the Mysterious Cavern (some texts say "Master of the Mysterious Chapter"), then Master of Ceremonies of the Left Daoist Registry, with an imperial edict stating: "Your compassion nurtures all things, your insight penetrates the divine. Though you have not yet returned to the Ten Caves and Three Heavens, for now, assist us in our dawn audiences and hasty meals." When Min fell, he returned to Jinling. Emperor Liezu of Southern Tang heard of him and sent envoys to greet and inquire after him. Messengers crisscrossed the roads to summon him, and when he arrived, his responses were sharp and eloquent. The emperor was pleased and convinced, appointing him Master of Ceremonies of the Left Daoist Registry and bestowing upon him the robes of office, further honoring him as Master of True Radiance (some texts say "Master of Observation"). The edict read: "You cultivate virtue in the forest of the Dao, your spirit abides beyond form. You have cast off the world’s net, severed ties to profit and the fertile Way." During the Baoda era, he was again granted the title Feathered Guest of the Golden Gate.

Zixiao had long admired the scenic beauty of Mount Lu. There, he chose to dwell in the Hidden Abode Grotto on White Cloud Peak—the former study of Prince Zhaoming of Liang, now the Hidden Abode Abbey. He also built a separate lodge by the Starry Islet at the south gate of the city for his comings and goings, which is now the Longevity Sage Abbey. The Later Lord of Southern Tang long admired his lofty character and again summoned him to Jinling, but before long, he returned to the mountain. In the summer of the sixth year of the Kaibao era of the Song dynasty, on the first day of the fourth month, he bathed, ascended the hall, and passed away in perfect seated posture at the age of one hundred and fifty. At that time, people near the grotto saw a cloud like a dragon rising into the sky. When he was buried, colorful clouds and white cranes circled above. The Later Lord sent envoys to offer lavish posthumous gifts.

Early on, Zixiao had mastered the most refined arts. He could perform rituals to the stars, serve the Dark Marshal, pace the Yu Step, and make hand seals to bind and curse ghosts and demons. For others, he burned memorials and performed rites to avert misfortune and summon blessings, and he had a keen sense of life and death. When summoned, he would bathe at dusk and, by nightfall, ascend a chamber alone to light the incense burner, lock the door, and perform the ritual. Only then would he light the lamp as proof. At dawn, he could accurately recount the length of a person’s life, and none of his predictions failed. He Jingshu, military governor of Wuchang, once became enraged with his favorite maid and threw her into a well, where she died—no one knew of it. In the early Jianlong era, He fell ill and summoned Zixiao. In the middle of the night, Zixiao loosened his hair, lit a lamp in a quiet room, and saw the female ghost recount how she had become a demonic haunting. Zixiao relayed her words, and He said, "It is true." He then wrote a talisman in cinnabar and sent her off, and his illness immediately improved.

Zixiao also possessed extraordinary arts. A neighboring monk was building a pavilion by the stream, but a stubborn boulder obstructed the work, making progress a hundred times more difficult. Zixiao happened to see this and said, "This is easily done." He traced a talisman with his finger, held water in his mouth, and spat it out, then ordered the stone to be struck—it crumbled to dust. Though Zixiao was repeatedly favored by successive courts and received honors comparable to Du Guangting of Shu, he often declined them. All the funds he received from rituals and offerings were used to support worthy scholars, relieve the poor, and entertain guests from the four directions. His room held no coffers or chests.

When Zixiao resided in the grotto, over a hundred Daoist followers, drawn by his reputation, would gather. He often lectured to his disciples on the *Zhuangzi* and *Liezi*, saying: "The teachings of Zhuang and Lie are familiar to our school. Their books fundamentally aim to awaken the true nature, to see that originally there is nothing. Their meaning aligns perfectly with the Buddhist teachings. If one can study the Buddhist scriptures alongside them, the intent of Zhuang and Lie becomes clear and easy to understand. In my youth, I read all the *Vajracchedikā* and *Yuanjue* sutras without exception, and thus I have fully awakened to the original true nature. Today, those who call themselves Daoists merely oppose Buddhism, not realizing that those who truly seek the Dao do not act this way. They merely pick up scraps and fragments, engaging in trivial matters, mistaking these for the Dao. Not only do they fail to awaken to the true nature, but they also stray infinitely far from the original intent of Laozi and Zhuangzi." For this reason, Zixiao’s room contained books from the Daoist, Buddhist, and Confucian traditions.

*(The* Southern Tang Biographies *records: Tan Zixiao was a native of Quanzhou. As a youth, he became a Daoist. There was another Daoist named Chen Shouyuan who, while hoeing the ground, unearthed several dozen wooden tablets stored in a bronze basin. They bore the talismans of Zhang Daoling, their red and black ink as fresh as if newly written. He could not use them and gave them to Zixiao. Zixiao mastered them all and claimed to have received the Celestial Heart Orthodox Method of Zhang Daoling. He was highly effective in subduing ghosts and demons and curing illnesses.)*

King Meng of Min held him in great esteem, bestowing upon him the titles "Feathered Guest of the Golden Gate" and "Master of Orthodox Unity." When Min fell, he lingered in retreat at the Stem-Concealing Grotto on Mount Lu, where over a hundred disciples gathered around him. The Later Lord, having heard of his reputation, summoned him for an audience and offered official positions, all of which he declined. Soon after, he fell ill and died at over a hundred years of age. Those who now speak of the Celestial Heart Orthodox Method all trace their lineage to Zixiao.

Huang Sun of Lianzhou
During the Five Dynasties, there was a Grand Preceptor Huang Sun of Lianzhou. The Grand Preceptor had served the Southern Han until his old age, when he retired and returned home. One day, he suddenly vanished without a trace, and no one knew whether he was alive or dead. His descendants kept his portrait and made offerings to it. After thirty-two years, he returned, sitting upon the steps of the previous day. He called out to his family, but his son happened to be away. His grandson came out to see him and asked for a brush to write on the wall:

*So many years have passed since we parted,*
*Returning, I find all mortal affairs worn away;*
*Only the mirror-pool before the gate remains,*
*Its spring waves unchanged by the wind of old.*

Having written this, he cast aside the brush and departed, impossible to detain. When his son returned and asked about his appearance, the grandson said, "He greatly resembled the old man in the portrait hall." To this day, the people of Lianzhou pass down this tale, and his descendants have since attained high office.

Wang the Elder
Wang the Elder—no one knows from which dynasty he hailed.

During the Tianbao era of Emperor Xuanzong of the Tang, there was a scholar surnamed Cui who served as a magistrate in Ba-Shu. He had just arrived in Chengdu when he died. The regional commander, Zhangqiu Jianqiong, pitying his young widow with nowhere to turn, had a villa built for her in the Qingcheng Mountains. Struck by her beauty, he harbored intentions to take her as his concubine. Finding no opportunity, he said to his wife, "As the wife of a high-ranking lord, why not host a grand banquet and invite all the ladies within five hundred *li*?" His wife was delighted. Jianqiong then ordered his officials to dispatch invitations to all young women within five hundred *li*, setting a date for them to gather in Chengdu. His plan was to detain the widow during the gathering, but unbeknownst to him, she had already been taken in by her uncle Lu.

Lu, having secretly learned of Jianqiong’s intentions, instructed the widow to feign illness and decline the invitation. Enraged, Jianqiong ordered a hundred riders to arrest her. At the time, Lu was dining when the soldiers surrounded his residence. Unperturbed, he continued eating as if nothing were amiss. After finishing his meal, he said to the widow, "Jianqiong’s intentions are clear—you cannot refuse to go. Soon, plain-colored garments will be sent to you; wear them when you depart." With that, he mounted a mule and rode out. The soldiers tried to block his path, but he moved slowly away, and they could not overtake him.

Shortly after, a young servant arrived bearing a box containing an old cyan skirt, a white blouse, a green quilt, and silk gauze—all fabrics unseen in the world. The widow donned them and traveled to Chengdu. The other young women had already arrived, and Jianqiong observed from behind a curtain. When the widow entered, her radiance enveloped her, her beauty dazzling all who beheld her. Those seated were so awestruck that they unconsciously rose to bow. After the gathering, she returned home and died three days later. Greatly alarmed, Jianqiong reported the matter in full to the emperor.

Emperor Xuanzong questioned Zhang Guo about the matter, but Guo merely transcribed it without daring to speak, requesting instead to consult Wang Lao of Qingcheng. The emperor immediately issued an edict to Jianqiong, ordering him to seek out Wang Lao and present him at court. Jianqiong scoured the front and back of Mount Qingcheng but found no such person—only an apothecary in the grass-market who said: "Two men come daily to sell mountain yams, calling themselves Wang Lao." Jianqiong dispatched two attendants, who were followed by his officials. After entering the mountains for several *li*, they arrived at a thatched hut where an old man sat with his feet tucked beneath him. The officials entered to proclaim the edict and convey Jianqiong’s intent. Wang Lao said: "This must be that garrulous little immortal, Zhang Guo." He then agreed with Jianqiong on a date to reach the capital, insisting on first taking medicine to induce perspiration and refusing official transport. Jianqiong complied.

No sooner had the messengers arrived at the Silver Terrace than Wang Lao appeared as well. The emperor summoned him for questioning. At that moment, Zhang Guo stood in attendance beside Xuanzong. Upon seeing Wang Lao, Guo prostrated himself in terror and bowed twice. Wang Lao rebuked him: "Why are you not like this? And why did you send for me from afar?" Guo replied: "This humble immortal dared not act on my own; I awaited only the words of the Immortal Elder." Wang Lao then declared: "Uncle Lu the Second is the storeroom keeper of the Grand Primordial Lady. While traveling below, he noticed that the late commandant’s wife possessed a trace of immortal bone, so he took her as a concubine. Before long, she stole the Grand Primordial Lady’s robes and wore them, for which she was punished in the netherworld. The late commandant’s wife, having donned the Grand Primordial Lady’s garments, has been cast into the Prison of Unanswered Questions." When the memorial was concluded, Wang Lao vehemently refused to remain in service. Guo ordered his release, and afterward, his whereabouts became unknown. The herb-gathering folk...

The herb-gathering folk—during the *Xianqing* era of Emperor Gaozong of Tang, there was an unnamed villager from Qingcheng in Shu Commandery who gathered herbs. Once, at the foot of Mount Qingcheng, he came upon a medicinal plant. He dug into the earth, descending several *zhang* deep, where the root grew as large as a jar. Undeterred, he continued digging until he reached five or six *zhang*, and the ground kept caving in, eventually plunging him over ten *zhang* deep. He fell into the pit with no way out. Looking up, the opening appeared no larger than a star. Certain of his death, he suddenly noticed a side passage. Crawling inside, the space gradually widened, allowing him to proceed on hands and knees for several dozen paces. Ahead, a faint light appeared, and following it for over a *li*, the passage grew taller until he could stand upright. After another two *li* or so, he emerged from a cave mouth to find a river dozens of paces wide. On the opposite bank stood several dozen households, their village shaded by mulberry and catalpa trees, with blossoming flowers, willows, and lush vegetation—all as if it were the second or third month. The men and women wore clothing unlike that of present-day people, and he encountered plowmen and young anglers along the way. One person, startled, asked how he had come there, and he explained what had happened. They ferried him across in a small boat. The villager told them he had not eaten for three days, so they fed him sesame rice and *wuzi* soup. After staying several days, he felt his body growing lighter. He asked his host, "What place is this?"

He also sought the way back to Shu. The villagers laughed together and said, "People of your world know nothing of this realm. That you have come here suggests you possess a share of immortal destiny. You should remain here, and I shall lead you to pay homage to the Jade Emperor." Among them, someone called out, "Tomorrow is the Shangsi Festival—we must go to pay our respects." They then took him along. Some rode upon clouds of *qi*, others mounted dragons or cranes, while he walked on foot amid the mist. In an instant, they arrived at a city adorned with gold and jade, its palaces and towers all wrought of precious metals. The others entered in turn to pay their respects, but he was left alone outside the palace gates. Beside the gate stood a great ox, crimson in color and of most unusual form, its eyes closed as it drooled foam. The villager instructed him to bow to the ox and beseech the immortal Dao, saying that if the ox spat forth any treasure, he should take and consume it. He did as told, bowing and pleading. After a moment, the ox spat out a crimson pearl, a handspan in circumference. Just as he rose to take it, a red-robed youth snatched it away. He begged again and received a blue pearl, only for a blue-robed youth to seize it. Soon after came yellow and white pearls, each taken by their respective youths. Frantic, he reached toward his mouth—just in time to catch a black pearl, which he swallowed at once. The black-robed youth arrived to find nothing, leaving him the sole one remaining. He was then led to pay homage to the Jade Emperor.

The Jade Emperor sat enthroned in the hall, his appearance like that of an earthly king. Seven attendants stood arrayed to his left and right, while hundreds of jade maidens guarded the palace courtyard. Rare and wondrous flowers and fruits filled the air with fragrances unknown in the mortal world. The Jade Emperor questioned him, and he answered truthfully. He then petitioned the Jade Emperor to return home, and the Jade Emperor bestowed upon him a golden ingot. "There is medicine within this gold," he said. "Take and consume it." Suddenly, a flock of swans and cranes appeared soaring in the sky. The others told him, "Do you see them? Simply follow their flight." They lifted him up, and he too rose into the air, arriving without startling the birds, who flew together through the heavens. Looking back, he still saw the villagers on the shore, cupping their hands in farewell. After traveling some hundred *li* or so, he found himself in a bustling city. When he asked where he was, he was told, "This is Linhai County—you are now very far from Shu." It took him a year to return to Shu, by which time it was the end of Emperor Xuanzong’s *Kaiyuan* era. When he reached his home, no one recognized him. Only one man, over ninety years old, said, "My grandfather went gathering herbs years ago and never returned. It has been ninety years since then." This man was his grandson. They embraced and wept, saying, "Your aunts and uncles have all passed away." His own daughter, born before he left, had already married and died, and her son was now over fifty.

He then sought his former dwelling, only to find it reduced to rubble and overgrown thickets—nothing remained but the old mulberry tree. Breaking open his gold to purchase medicine, he swallowed it, but the elixir suddenly vanished. Lifting the mulberry stone, he discovered a jade box containing golden cinnabar, which he consumed at once. His mind grew lucid, and he recalled the path he had taken.

This was how the man attained the Dao in the immortal cavern, though common folk could not fathom the details. When questioned, Master Luo the Celestial Master, then in Shu, heard his account and declared: "This is the Fifth Grotto, the Heaven of Nine Chambers of Precious Immortals. The Jade Emperor is the Heavenly Sovereign. The great ox was a black dragon, and the pearl it spat—red if swallowed grants life coeval with heaven and earth, green bestows fifty thousand years, white ten thousand, and black five thousand. This man received the black pearl, so though he did not cultivate the Dao, he would still live five thousand years in the mortal realm. As for the seven figures who stood before him, they were the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper."

After consuming the elixir, the man returned to the mountains, and his whereabouts were never known again.

**Yang Tongyou**
Yang Tongyou, originally named Shiwu, was a native of Shiyu in Guanghan. In his youth, he encountered a Daoist who taught him the art of summons and petitions, transmitting to him the celestial texts of the Three Sovereigns. He could command ghosts and spirits, and none failed to answer instantly. He expelled venomous plagues, severed baleful influences, averted floods and droughts, and summoned wind and rain—all arts he mastered. Yet he was simple and aloof, unbound by worldly conventions. His techniques were wondrous and strange, renowned far and near.

Emperor Xuanzong of Tang bestowed upon him the name Tongyou and inquired about the Dao he had received. Tongyou replied, "My master was the True Man of Qingcheng, the South Pole Lord Wang. Long ago in the mountains of Houcheng, he taught me the art of summons and commands, saying that by aiding a sovereign of great peace, one might then attain the Dao of ascension. He warned me to guard my qi and speak sparingly, to avert my gaze from all that was improper, to renounce fame and profit, and to distance myself from the clamor of the world—only then could I transcend the Three Realms and ascend to the Great Clarity."

The emperor further asked what one did upon ascending to heaven or descending into the earth. Tongyou answered, "Those who attain the Dao are unscorched by fire, undrenched by water, tread the void as though it were solid, and touch the solid as though it were void. Though the Nine Earths be deep, the vast seas broad, the Eight Poles distant, or the Ten Thousand Heavens vast, all responds to thought and arrives at will—what bounds could constrain them? This is so because form and Dao have merged as one." The emperor praised his response.

After residing for several years, Tongyou ascended Houcheng Mountain and built a quiet chamber at its summit, occasionally returning home. His disciples reported that celestial perfected beings frequently descended to his chamber, and one day he departed with a host of immortals.

**Cui Wei**
The scholar Cui Wei once traveled to Mount Qingcheng. Dismounting his donkey to rest, he let it graze without a servant. The donkey bolted, and though he pursued it for over thirty li, he reached the mouth of a cave as dusk fell. The donkey ran inside, and Cui, weary and afraid, lay down to sleep. At dawn, he awoke to a faint light in the cave and ventured deeper. After another ten li, he emerged from the cave to behold towering trees and sheer cliffs—none of it familiar. Only golden walls and crimson towers stood before him, guarded by hundreds in armor. Seeing Cui, they shouted and questioned him. He replied, "I am but a humble man of the dust, who wishes to pay homage to the immortal elder." The guards hurried to report, and after a long while, he was summoned.

A figure sat in the hall, clad in feathered robes, his stature over a *zhang* tall, his beard and hair snowy white. Attendants filled his sides, each bearing something in hand. He bade Cui ascend the hall and spoke with him, greatly pleased. Cui was kept overnight, and the feast laid before him was of the rarest and richest delicacies. The next day, the immortal elder said, "This is no mortal realm, but the abode of immortals." Cui replied, "I am bound by the ties of flesh and blood. Though I seek no attachment, I beg to return." The immortal elder said, "To linger is forbidden; the punishment is severe." He gave Cui a talisman, saying, "Should you encounter misfortune, it may conceal your form—but beware, do not wander into the imperial palace." At parting, he gave another talisman, saying, "Open this only in dire need."

He then returned Cui’s donkey. Upon reaching the capital, Cui tested the talisman in people’s homes—none could see him. He entered the imperial gardens and inner palace, where, during the birthday celebration of the Consort of Jiannan, he stole the finest silks and brocades. The emperor, investigating the theft all day, could find no trace of the thief. He summoned Luo Gongyuan, who performed a ritual and held up a vermilion inscription to illuminate the hall. Behind the palace doors, Cui was discovered. When questioned, he recounted the whole affair, but the emperor refused to believe him and ordered him beaten to death.

Suddenly recalling the immortal’s parting talisman, Cui hastily opened it. Gongyuan and his captors all collapsed, stiff as corpses. After a long while, they revived and reported to Emperor Xuanzong, "This man now dwells in the upper realms. To kill him is impossible, and even if we could, we would bring calamity upon ourselves—this would not bode well for the realm." The emperor released Cui and summoned him for a private audience, asking, "Are you deceiving me?" He then ordered a hundred armed men to escort Cui back to the mountains and observe what became of him.

Returning to the cave’s mouth, Cui again saw the golden walls and crimson towers. The immortal elder emerged with a solemn retinue and called out, "Master Cui, you did not heed my words and nearly met with disaster." After bowing, Cui stepped forward. The escorting soldiers wished to follow, but the immortal elder drew his staff and traced a ravine, several *zhang* wide. He tossed a kerchief, which transformed into a rainbow bridge of five colors. Bidding Cui cross, the bridge vanished with each step. Once across, Cui turned and said, "You may return from here." In an instant, clouds and mist arose, obscuring all within a *chi* or *cun*. Only the sounds of phoenixes, cranes, and celestial music lingered, fading after half a day. Gazing into the distance, they saw only empty mountains—nothing else remained.

**Wei Gu**
Wei Gu, styled Laoshi, was a native of Shule.

Wei Gu wore a robe of righteousness, with hundreds of gourds hanging from his waist. His head was wrapped in a gauze kerchief, and he carried a flowering staff, always accompanied by a black dog. During the reign of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang, he entered China, dispensing medicines to cure the sick, and none failed to recover. The emperor held him in high esteem, respectfully calling him the "Medicine King." Later, his dog transformed into a black dragon, and he mounted it to ascend into the heavens—this occurred in the twenty-fifth year of the Kaiyuan era.

**The Mad Daoist**
In Shu there was a Daoist known as the Mad One, commonly called the "Ash-Bag Gentleman," a late disciple of Zhai Qianyu. Qianyu often warned his followers, saying, "Do not deceive this man; he surpasses me." Once, during a heavy snowfall, the Daoist, clad in coarse hempen cloth, entered Mount Qingcheng. At dusk, he sought shelter at a monastery, asking the monk for lodging. The monk replied, "This poor monk has but one sleeve to offer. With such cold, I fear I cannot sustain you." The Daoist merely said, "A grove of trees will suffice." By midnight, the snow deepened and the wind howled. Fearing the Daoist had frozen to death, the monk went to check on him and found him several feet away from the wall, his breath steaming like a boiling pot. Sweating profusely, he lay bare-chested in sleep. Only then did the monk realize he was an extraordinary man. Before dawn, the Daoist departed without a word.

He often stayed in villages, and wherever he lodged, the people grew ever more devoted to him. Once, he fell ill with mouth sores and went months without eating, appearing on the verge of death. The villagers, who had long revered him as a divine figure, prepared a Daoist feast in his honor. After the feast, he suddenly rose and addressed the crowd, saying, "Look into my mouth and see what lies within." He opened his mouth wide as a winnowing basket, revealing all five viscera. The onlookers were astonished and bowed in reverence, questioning him. He only replied, "This is quite foul. Quite foul indeed." Thereafter, his fate remained unknown.

**Elder Wei**
During the reign of Emperor Daizong of Tang, the imperial censor Wei was dispatched to Mount Hua to pay respects at the Yellow Emperor’s altar. At the foot of the mountain, he encountered an old man at an inn and inquired about the altar’s location. The elder knew the way and mentioned, "My surname is Wei, and my family has also served in office." He recounted his lineage, revealing himself to be Wei’s distant ancestor. Together, they entered the mountain. The old man, leaning on his staff, walked ahead, while Wei urged his horse forward but could not catch up. They arrived at a stone chamber where an old woman appeared, saying, "She is your grandmother, and these are your ancestral aunts." Both had hair as white as frost and wore garments of woven leaves. Overjoyed, they exclaimed, "After ages of change, we meet our descendants in a single day!" After paying respects at the altar, Wei returned to the chamber, but they had vanished. The locals at the mountain’s base said the elder appeared every two or three years, though none knew his dwelling.

*Comprehensive Mirror of Perfected Immortals Who Embodied the Dao, Volume 43 (concluded)*
*Comprehensive Mirror of Perfected Immortals Who Embodied the Dao, Volume 44*

Lu Sheng was a man of the Baoli era during the reign of Emperor Jingzong of Tang. He often peddled lime and firewood, traveling between Baiqiu and the southern grass market. Occasionally, he subtly revealed his extraordinary nature, yet no one could fathom him. The merchant Zhao Yuanqing, an inquisitive man, sought to befriend him. He frequently purchased Lu’s goods and offered tea and medicine, feigning interest in his profit-sharing methods. Lu, perceiving this, eventually said, "Your intentions seem not to lie in trade—what is it you truly seek?" Zhao replied, "I know you, elder, conceal your brilliance and hide your virtue, penetrating the mysteries of divination. I humbly beg a word of guidance." Lu smiled and said, "This very day, at noon, your host’s household will face an extraordinary calamity. If my words prove true, you may warn them. Near noon, a pastry vendor will arrive, carrying a sack with over two thousand coins, though his intent is not benign. Tell them to bolt the door and caution the women and children against responding lightly. By midday, he will curse vehemently—then the entire household must flee to the water’s edge. If they do, they will only suffer a loss of three thousand one hundred coins."

At the time, Zhao was staying at the home of a commoner named Zhang. He hurried back to relay the warning, and Zhang, who had long revered Lu as a divine figure, promptly barred the door. As noon approached, a man indeed arrived, knocking and demanding to be let in. Enraged by the lack of response, he kicked the door. Zhang reinforced it with baskets to hold it shut, and soon hundreds gathered. Zhang then led his wife and children out the back to evade the commotion. By midday, after retreating several hundred paces, the man suddenly collapsed and died. His wife arrived, and the crowd recounted the events. She accused Zhang of causing her husband’s death through slander, and the local officials could not resolve the dispute. The crowd explained Zhang’s reason for bolting the door, and the onlookers told Zhang, "You are blameless—defend yourself." Zhang gladly accepted the verdict. The wife then demanded compensation for the market stall and funeral expenses, totaling three thousand four hundred coins. As a result, people flocked to Zhang’s home like a marketplace.

Lu Sheng, growing impatient, secretly traveled to Fuzhou and Huaizhou, stopping at the estate of the scholar Lu. Someone told Lu, "The mountain man Lu is no ordinary man." Lu then paid him a visit. At the time, Lu was preparing to journey to the capital to seek patronage from acquaintances. He asked Lu Sheng to resolve his doubts, who replied, "You must not travel this year—calamity will strike at any moment. Behind the hall of your residence lies a cache of coins, covered by a plank, but it is not yours. It has been there for only three years. Do not spend a single coin, or disaster will follow. Can you heed this warning?" Lu gratefully thanked him. After Lu Sheng departed, before the ripples of his words had settled, Lu laughed and said to his wife and children, "If we follow Lu Sheng’s advice, what more could we desire?" He ordered his servants to dig behind the hall. After a few feet, they indeed found a plank. Removing it, they uncovered scattered coins. Overjoyed, Lu’s wife used her skirt to gather them, threading them with grass until they neared ten thousand. Suddenly, their children began wailing in unbearable pain. Lu exclaimed, "Could this be the fulfillment of Lu Sheng’s warning?" He mounted his horse and pursued Lu Sheng, offering thanks and seeking further counsel. Lu, furious, said, "If you use those coins, disaster will befall your flesh and blood. Weigh the value of your kin against profit—decide for yourself." He then poled his boat away without looking back. Lu rushed home, performed a ritual, and his brother’s daughter recovered.

Lu Sheng often strolled leisurely with several companions. On one occasion, they encountered six or seven finely dressed men reeking of alcohol. Lu suddenly rebuked them, "Your conduct is base—your lives will not last long." The men prostrated themselves in the dust, pleading, "We dare not... we will repent." His companions were astonished, but Lu said, "These are all river bandits." Zhao Yuanqing remarked that Lu Sheng’s appearance shifted between youth and age, and he was rarely seen eating or drinking. Lu once told Zhao, "Those who follow the Dao attain the art of concealment. If one refrains from testing it, after twenty years, one’s form may be altered—a stage called 'shedding.' After another twenty years, one’s name is recorded among the earthbound immortals." His deeds were often extraordinary, for he was a divine immortal.

Liu Wuming was a native of Chengdu. A descendant of Liu Bei, the founding emperor of Shu, he lived in Shu from birth. Gifted and perceptive, at eight or nine years old, a Daoist passing his home saw him and sighed, "If this child studies the Dao, he will become a long-lived divine immortal." From then on, he devoted himself to the Dao, exploring its mysteries and disdaining fame and profit. In his youth, he studied the *Dao De Jing* and practiced breath control, prostration, visualization, and inner alchemy. He regularly observed the Gengshen day to guard against the Three Corpses, cultivated spirit through silent meditation, and consumed yellow essence and white wood to prolong life. He once read an ancient formula stating that herbal medicines merely cured illnesses with modest effects, and fire reduced them to ashes, rendering them incapable of preserving life—how could they grant longevity? Thus, he traversed mountains and rivers, seeking masters and the Dao.

After several years, he entered Wuzhong Mountain, where he encountered an extraordinary figure who taught him to ingest and refine realgar. For over thirty years, he entered a cave beneath the northern cliff of Mount Qingcheng. After walking several miles, he suddenly found himself in a vast, level expanse, far from the mortal world. There, he met divine immortals dwelling within, who called themselves the Perfected of Qingcheng. Liu entreated them ceaselessly, begging to be shown the essentials of the Dao to deliver himself from the depths of suffering and transcend the bitterness of life and death. The Perfected pointed to a rock chamber, where he took up residence. After purifying his mind for seven days, the Perfected revealed to him the methods of the yang crucible and yin tripod, the softening of metal and refinement of flowing jade, and the secrets of subduing water to refine lead into mercury marrow. He said, "Hu Gangzi and Yin Changsheng both mastered this Dao—it is also known as the *Scripture of the Nine Transformations of Divine Elixir of Golden Liquor*. The elixir has nine grades: lead serves as the sovereign, mercury as the minister, the eight minerals as envoys, and yellow sprouts as the agent. When sovereign and minister harmonize and the fire’s work is complete, after seven days, it becomes light water; after fourteen days, it transforms into purple powder; after twenty-one days, the five colors manifest, with red within and yellow without, resembling window dust. After refining it with fire for two years—six hundred days passing through the four seasons and the winter solstice twice—it reaches completion."

At first, after ten months of refining, the elixir sheds its embryonic form and achieves the initial grade, capable of congealing mercury into silver. When shaped into pills and ingested, it can dispel illness. After two years, those who consume it will prolong their years and extend their lifespan, with white hair turning black again. After three years, taking but a *daogui* of it allows one to wander carefree through famous mountains and traverse the four seas. Those who attain earthly immortality by consuming half a dose of the initial-grade elixir can transform endlessly, appearing and vanishing at will, riding flying dragons, and ascending to heaven in broad daylight.

Generally, after sixteen stages of refinement, this elixir reaches the middle grade, granting the taker longevity. By the day the elixir is complete, the five metals, eight minerals, yellow sprouts, and the sovereign and ministerial ingredients will have merged inseparably. After a thousand days of work, it becomes the superior-grade *Returning Elixir*. Guard it carefully and do not show it to the unworthy. Should one encounter a person whose form, *qi*, cultivation, and conduct align with the Dao, transmit it to them.

Liu received the elixir formula and returned to Misty Mountain, where he built a chamber to refine it. After three years, he succeeded. He was still in Shu during the third year of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang’s *Kaicheng* era. He left behind an untitled account to instruct later generations, then entered Mount Qingcheng and vanished without a trace.

Li Zhongnan
Li Deyu favored consuming cinnabar. A Daoist who claimed to be Li Zhongnan, residing on Mount Luofu, said to him, "My lord, you may take cinnabar pills, but they will only hasten your lifespan." From his sleeve, he produced a small jade elephant, about the size of a fist, and said, "To refine cinnabar, place *Goulou* crystal beneath the elephant’s trunk. The elephant will ingest the cinnabar and regurgitate it, only then may it be consumed. This is the essence of the Great Yang, condensed for thirty thousand years—I now offer it to you. Remember loyalty and filial piety, lest you incur misfortune." He then produced a golden elephant, saying, "This is the female, paired with the jade one."

Zanhuang (Li Deyu) verified each detail without error. After consuming the elixir, his complexion grew youthful, and his beard and temples turned black as lacquer. He then sought rare ingredients, dispatching hundreds of people. Later, when exiled to the Ghost Gate Pass in the south, he encountered the Daoist, who angrily demanded the two elephants back, saying, "You ignored my warning—this is your due." The minister prostrated himself in apology. As they reached Eel Pond, a storm darkened the sky, and the jade elephant flew from the boat, its radiance illuminating the heavens, while the golden elephant plunged into the water. When Deyu reached Zhuya, he died in regret.

Thus it is known: the elephant is a great beast of the south; *Goulou* is a treasure of Zhuya; Mount Luofu is a coastal mountain; and Li Zhongnan was beyond Deyu’s reach. (Zanhuang was Li Deyu, who in the second year of Emperor Xuanzong’s *Dazhong* era was demoted to *Sima* of Chaozhou. In the ninth month of autumn, he was further reduced to *Sihu* of Yazhou and died there.) As for the Daoist, none ever knew which immortal he was.

Willow-Green
In the late *Dazhong* era of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang, there was an extraordinary man called Willow-Green. One day, he suddenly died, and after burial, a purple aura appeared above his grave. When opened, his coffin contained only a green staff. Upon inspection, it was revealed to be the source of the aura.

Li Hao
Li Hao, styled Taisu, was of unknown origin and dwelled in Peony Plateau of Mount Qingcheng. He once traveled with Master Erzhu, composing a *Pu Sa Man* poem for him and a hundred verses on the Great Elixir, which circulated in the world. Later, his whereabouts became unknown, though some claimed his entire household ascended as immortals. One of his poems reads:

*Before heaven and earth divided, I alone endured,*
*Embracing the Four Symbols, I established the cosmos.*
*Seek the Returning Elixir here,*
*For herein lies the gate of supreme mystery.*

*Boil stone, refine gold, and temper the Great Primal,*
*Immortals do not lightly transmit such arts.*
*Whoever grasps the principle of Nothingness*
*Seizes the power of creation itself.*

*A hundred verses, wild yet profound,*
*Transmitted to fellow Daoists to dispel doubt.*
*The Flowery Pond is true divine water,*
*And that water is originally white gold.*

*Fashion white gold into a crucible,*
*Then conceal it as mercury invades.*
*When mercury consumes the golden vessel for a full year,*
*It yields numinous cinnabar, like the moon’s essence.*

Zhang Ci
In the early *Xiantong* era of Emperor Yizong of Tang, the scholar Zhang Ci failed the imperial examinations and later traveled extensively along the Yangtze and Huai rivers. He possessed Daoist arts and cultivated *qi* while abstaining from grain. One of his poems reads:

*How can I bear the golden crow*
*That flies ceaselessly overhead?*
*The red furnace slowly refines the medicine,*
*Yet how can a jade countenance endure?*
*This year, flowers bloom on the branch;*
*Next year, leaves fall from the tree.*
*Better to drink wine,*
*Morning and night, again and again.*

When invited to drink, if the occasion pleased him, he would cut two or three paper butterflies, blow on them with his breath, and they would fly in formation. Later, he ascended to heaven in Jiangnan, leaving behind a poem:

*Zhang Ci, Zhang Ci, you never understood—*
*All the world’s scriptures were within your belly.*
*Your body roamed the mundane world,*
*While your heart soared beyond the heavens.*

Li Lao
Li Lao’s family practiced medicine for generations, and he was skilled at playing the zither, claiming to have mastered Ji Kang’s art. Once, while drunk, he fell into a dry well. Wandering, he arrived at a cave gate inscribed *Mystic Capital Grotto*, where he saw a Daoist playing the zither, performing *Guangling San*. The Daoist said, "This is your composition. Ji Kang was your former life." He then offered Li a drink of stone marrow and took a plain book from the shelf, revealing a formula for *Thirty-Six Wind White Pills*. The Daoist said, "Take this back, prepare the medicine, and heal the world. When your merit is complete, return here." He instructed Li to close his eyes, and when he opened them, he was outside the north gate of Qingzhou. Upon returning home, he found his family had already ended their mourning. It was the third year of Emperor Xizong of Tang’s *Qianfu* era.

Li then prepared the medicine and treated illnesses, with none failing to recover. Years later, he lost his appetite and ceased eating grain. One day, he went to visit the dry well and never returned, suspected to have found the path and ascended as an immortal.

**Chen Yunsheng**
Chen Yunsheng entered Mount Longhu. During the *Tianyou* era of Emperor Aidi of Tang, he was seen on Mount Magu, having been away from home for seventy years, yet his appearance remained unchanged. The prefect welcomed him and kept him in the prefectural seat. One night, as they sat together, Chen remarked, "The oranges of Fengcheng are fine—I find myself longing for them." In an instant, he plucked several hundred and presented them. The people of the time called him an immortal.

**Xu Que**
Master Xu Que of the Perfected, at the end of the Tang, wandered to Zhaoxian Abbey on Mount Heng. On the wall, he left a song:

The great furnace forges human nature and life,
Tools differ, yet fate is fixed.
Demons and specters scheme with supernatural arts,
But their schemes corrupt, never righteous.

Young boys first learning their way,
Who knows the sun and moon rise east and set west?
Yet by the might of the myriad spirits,
The moon may be moved south, the sun north.

Jade is jade, stone is stone,
The radish cast in deep mud remains unrecognized.
Deng Tong starved to death, Yan Ling stayed poor—
Were emperors truly without men of power?

A true man, unrecognized, should not cling to others,
Climbing dragons or riding phoenixes wastes the spirit.

Several days after inscribing this, he ascended to immortality.

**The Orange Elder**

The Elder was a man of Bana, his surname unknown. His family owned an orange grove, and after the frost, all the oranges were harvested—save for two large ones, each the size of a four-*dou* jar. The people of Ba ordered them plucked, yet their weight was no different from ordinary oranges. When cut open, each contained two elders, their hair, beards, and brows thick and full, their skin and bodies ruddy and luminous. They sat facing each other, playing *xiangqi*. Standing just over a foot tall, they chatted and laughed as if at ease. After finishing their game, one elder said, "You owe me ten taels of the seventh daughter of the Sea Dragon Spirit’s hair, twelve branches of *zhi*□□*huang*, a bolt of purple silk gauze, and two doses of *xiaoshi* from Crimson Terrace Mountain." The other replied, "You owe me nine *hu* of jade dust from Yingzhou, four cups of Mother A’s marrow-congealing wine, eight pairs of *mi* socks from Mother A’s daughter Bear Cub, and □ *zi* of the Void-Sustaining Dragon’s gossamer stockings." Another said, "Master Yu, when you return to your thatched hut on Mount Qingcheng, repay me then." One elder remarked, "Master Wang promised to come but never did. The joy of the orange is no less than that of Shang Mountain, though we cannot root ourselves firmly within it." Another said, "I am famished. I must eat some dragon-root jerky." From his sleeve, he drew a grass root, round and an inch in diameter, its shape twisting like a dragon, its fine hairs distinct in every crevice. He peeled and ate it, and as he did, it replenished itself. After finishing, he rinsed it with water, and it transformed into a dragon. The four mounted it, and as their feet stirred the clouds, a sudden storm darkened the sky. Their whereabouts became unknown.

An Old Man by the Roadside
The old man was the paternal granduncle of Pei Hang, a *sim*a.

From Luoyang to Zhengzhou, midway through the journey, Pei dismounted and heard a sound from the roadside. Pushing through the brush, he searched beneath a thorn thicket and found a wounded crane with drooping wings, its wing joints as if broken, its feathers gone, and its cries strange. Suddenly, an old man in white, leaning on a staff, approached from several dozen paces away and asked, "Young sir, how is it that you pity this crane? If you apply human blood to its wounds, it may yet fly again."

Pei, who had long followed the Dao and was of a lofty and carefree nature, promptly replied, "I would not hesitate to offer the blood from my arm." The old man said, "Your resolve is indeed strong, but only the blood of one who has lived three lifetimes as a human will suffice. You were not human in your past life, but in Luoyang, only Hulu Sheng has lived three lifetimes as a man." He continued, "If your journey is not urgent, might you go to Luoyang and seek out Hulu Sheng?"

Pei gladly set off and, before two nights had passed, arrived in Luoyang. He found Hulu Sheng and recounted the matter. Hulu Sheng replied, "This is no difficulty." He opened a plain wooden box and took out a stone vessel, no larger than two fingers. With a needle, he pricked Pei’s arm and let the blood drip into the vessel until it was full. Handing it to Pei, he said, "Say nothing of this."

When Pei returned to the crane, the old man was already there. Delighted, he exclaimed, "Truly, you are a man of your word." He then had Pei apply all the blood to the crane’s wounds, saying they were now bound by fate, and invited Pei, "My home is not far from here. Will you not stay a while?" Pei, sensing the old man was no ordinary person, addressed him as "Elder." Following him for several *li*, they arrived at a hamlet of bamboo groves and thatched cottages, where hemp stalks lay scattered in the courtyard.

Pei, parched with thirst, asked for tea. The old man pointed to a clay jar and said, "There is a little liquid inside. You may take some." Pei looked into the jar and saw a single apricot pit, large as a bamboo hat, filling its mouth. He scooped out the liquid—pure white—and drank deeply, his hunger and thirst vanishing. The taste was like almond cream.

Pei, now certain the old man was a reclusive immortal, bowed and begged to serve him. The old man replied, "You have a minor official post in the mortal world, and even if you abandon it, you will not fulfill your aspirations. The worthy do indeed attain something, though you have long wandered with me unawares. Now, I have a message I must entrust to you." He handed Pei a plain wooden box, large as a bowl, warning, "Do not open it in secret."

He then led Pei to see the crane’s injuries, where feathers had already begun to grow. Turning to Pei, he said, "The apricot nectar you drank will make you weep for your nine clans of kin. Beware of wine and lust." Later, on his return to Luoyang, Pei grew restless on the road and was about to open the box when from each of its four corners emerged the head of a red serpent. He delivered the message to his uncle, who opened it to find an object like a measure of dried barley rice. Later, his uncle traveled to Wangwu Mountain and was never heard from again. Pei lived to the age of ninety-seven.

The Old Man of Mount Zhongnan
Chen Jiqing, a man of Jiangnan, had passed the imperial examinations but remained in Chang’an for ten years without returning home. One day, at the Green Dragon Temple, he called on a monk but did not find him. Resting by the brazier...

A certain Old Man of Mount Zhongnan was also waiting for the monk, and by chance sat for a long while. On the wall hung a map of the world. Jiqing traced the road to Jiangnan and sighed, "If I could but return by this, I would not regret my lack of success." The Old Man replied, "What difficulty is there?" Breaking off a bamboo leaf from before the steps, he placed it upon the map in the midst of the Wei River and said to Chen, "Fix your gaze here, and you shall arrive." Jiqing stared intently—suddenly, the Wei River surged with towering waves, and a great boat appeared. In a daze, he boarded the vessel, which sped forward with astonishing swiftness.

As they passed the Chan Grotto Temple, he inscribed a poem:
*"When the frosted crane cries, the evening wind howls sharp,
A flock of crows gathers once more in the cold woods.
Here I moor my oar to chant in sorrow,
Alone before the Lotus Peak I stand."*

The next day, they reached Tong Pass, where he added the closing lines of another poem:
*"I have made my shameful plan to return—
Yet better this than never to return at all."*

In little more than ten days, he reached home, where his brothers, wife, and children welcomed him with great joy. After two nights, he told his wife, "The examination date draws near; I cannot stay long." He boarded the boat again and composed a poem to bid her farewell:
*"Wine poured deepens sorrow with each drink,
Poems written blend with tears as I sing."*

Then, in a fleeting gust, he vanished. His family, astonished, could only marvel. In an instant, he found himself once more at the Wei River, hastening straight to Green Dragon Temple, where the Old Man still sat wrapped in his coarse robe, and the monk had yet to return. Jiqing bowed in thanks and asked, "Was this not a dream?" The Old Man replied, "In time, you will know for yourself."

A month later, his family came to visit and recounted the whole affair—all the poems he had inscribed were still there, preserved in the valley’s beauty.

The Valley Scholar sat for the imperial examinations multiple times. Later, he suddenly fell into madness, wandering the streets and chanting:

*"A thatched hut once stood,
Still tended with care,
Yet wild winds howl—
Eaves torn, beams split,
Carved brackets sway and sing,
Soon to collapse.
Walls crumble to scattered dust,
The master never returns."*

He later died of illness, and when his coffin was opened for burial, it was found to be empty.

**The Deer-Man**
In Tangzhou, a hunter shot a deer deep in the mountains, only to find it was a man. The man called out to the hunter, "I have hidden in these mountains since the early Sui. Today, I was fated to die by your hand. Only place me among the rocks." The hunter agreed, but when he turned back briefly, the man had already expired. Returning ten days later, the hunter found the body gone.

**Liu Jian**
Liu Jian, a man of Zizhou, was a Daoist adept. Clad in hempen robes and a black headscarf, he feigned foolishness and ignorance. He was deeply filial to his mother, and their home stood by a pond. One day, he suddenly carried his mother up a mountain. That very night, a great flood rose over ten feet, and people began to suspect and marvel at him.

Later, he moved several *li* from the city, carving out a cave dwelling for himself while building a small chamber nearby for his mother. Morning and evening, he would emerge only to check on her rest and meals before returning to his cave to sit in silence. For over a decade, scholars and officials who sought to meet him would enter his cave, but he would not exchange a single word. If questioned, he would not answer, only repeating, *"Hasten your cultivation, hasten your cultivation."*

After his mother passed, he arranged her burial. One day, he vanished into the sky, leaving no trace.

**The Man in White**
Li, Vice-Commissioner of Jiangling, failed the imperial examinations and traveled to Huayin, where he encountered a man in white who asked, "Would you like to know your future?" The man wrote three sealed letters, instructing, "Open them only in dire need."

After five or six more failed attempts, Li fell into poverty. He said, "The immortal’s letter may now be opened." He burned incense and broke the seal, which read: *"Sit before the monastery in Qingzhou."* Li went there, and after a short while, the abbot appeared, asking, "Do you recognize Magistrate Li of Songzi?" The vice-commissioner replied, "He was my father." The abbot said, "Years ago, your father entrusted two thousand strings of cash to this monastery, a debt that weighed on his heart. I now return it to you." Li loaded the money and returned home.

Years passed without success in the examinations. He said, "This concerns my entire life—time for the second letter." It read: *"On such-and-such a day, ride through the western market and pause."* On that day, he went, and from a tower below, someone called out, "The examining minister, the Vice-Director, requires a thousand strings of cash to secure your success." Li ascended and met the man, who made a firm agreement. The following year, he indeed passed the examinations and later rose to the rank of Vice-Commissioner in the Palace Administration.

One day, he suffered severe heart pain and opened the third letter, which read: *"On such-and-such a day, Vice-Commissioner Li of Jiangling will suffer heart pain—settle your family affairs."* Two days later, he died.

**The Craftsman of Fangzhou**

The Craftsman of Fangzhou

In Fangzhou’s Zhushan County, a recluse’s household had a well dug over a thousand feet deep, yet no water was found. As the craftsman felt along the walls, he entered another realm of heaven and earth, with its own sun and moon, which bore a placard reading *Celestial Cassia Mountain*. Inside the gate stood two youths—fair of tooth and lustrous of hair, their feet delicate and unshod, their caps not yet donned—who asked, "Why have you come here?" The craftsman recounted his story in full. Presently, a messenger in flowing robes arrived and declared, "Send him off with propriety." They led him to a spring where he bathed, then rinsed his mouth with its clear, sweet waters, which tasted as intoxicating as wine.

After half a day’s journey, he reached a kingdom whose palaces and halls were all of gold and jade. The city gates bore an inscription: *Ladder-to-Immortality Land*. The craftsman asked, "What is this place?" They replied, "All who first attain immortality are sent here to cultivate for seven hundred thousand days before ascending to the heavens, where they wander Jade Capital Penglai, Kunlun, and Guye."

He then climbed the mountain in search of a path. A gatekeeper said, "Though you have been here but a moment, a dozen years have passed. The old tunnel can no longer be found. We must petition for the key to the Heavenly Pass to guide you back through the Celestial Gate." In an instant, clouds carried him back to Fangzhou. When he inquired after the recluse’s household, he was told, "Three or four years have already passed." Thereafter, the craftsman ate no grain, and none knew his whereabouts.

The River Elder was skilled in playing the long flute and could produce the cries of dragons. Later, while traveling, he rested beneath a large pagoda tree by the roadside near the Jade Plate Bean Pavilion in Minxiang. That night, he saw a figure towering several *zhang* tall, who said, "I took you for a *niuji* by the pagoda, but you are a *Bi Zhuo* by the jar." Then, pointing to the tree, he added, "The Second Young Master from Jingshan Lodge has come to visit his elder brother." Soon after, someone descended from the tree. At dawn, the elder went to Jingshan Lodge and saw a pagoda tree ten *wei* in girth in the courtyard. Suspecting it harbored a divine being, he said, "I have long sought the Dao but never met a master. If the tree spirit is willing, I beg for your guidance." The spirit replied, "Simply enter Mount Ke and seek Master Bao the Immortal; you will surely attain transcendence." The elder entered the mountain and indeed encountered the immortal master, who instructed him to play the flute. As he blew, a single breath carried pure emptiness, the five notes rang clear and resonant, summoning springs to gush forth, drawing crows to fly low, shaking withered leaves from their branches, and coaxing light clouds from the peaks. The immortal master said, "Your art has reached perfection, but what you play is a bamboo flute. I now gift you a flute of fine jade. After playing it for three years, you will summon dragons from the caves. They will bring you the Water Elixir; swallow it, and you will become a Water Immortal, sparing you the need for my medicine—for you bear the destiny of *Qin Gao*."

Three years later, the elder played the flute atop a tower at Yueyang Temple. Sure enough, a dragon transformed into a man and presented him with the elixir. The elder consumed it, his visage reverted to youth, and he entered water without getting wet, thus becoming a Water Immortal.

Hong Zhi was a Daoist whose surname was Hong and given name Zhi, though his origins were unknown. From youth, he was broadly learned and well-versed in the classics, as well as the mysteries of astrology, cosmology, medicine, and pharmacology, mastering each to its utmost. Yet he remained obscure, and when others urged him to seek favor at the gates of the powerful to advance himself, he replied, "Fine gold and beautiful jade are not things to be hawked for credit." He never went. Later, reflecting on the dreamlike impermanence of the world, he renounced it as insubstantial and became a Daoist, withdrawing to seclusion on Mount Lu. He often rode a blue ox as he came and went, earning the name "Blue Ox Daoist." Living in the mountains, he wore clothing of grass, ate wild plants, and devoted himself to ascetic practice. After some time, he unexpectedly encountered an extraordinary person who taught him divine formulas. From then on, he could command the Six *Jia* spirits, summon gods and ghosts, and perform myriad transformations beyond count.

One day, he returned to his hometown, carrying a small basket. The villagers, unaware of his attainment, invited him to drink. He emptied every dish and platter, then drew from his basket dried meats, roasted delicacies, dates, and chestnuts to share. All who sat with him ate their fill, and those who took from him were sated to surfeit, marveling and questioning him. He only smiled and did not answer. Later, staying at an inn on a cold night, people saw him wearing only thin garments and no bedding or extra clothes. They secretly watched him through the door and saw him take a pillow and quilt from his small basket, covering himself as he lay down. Everything he needed was there, and he carried it all away again when he left. Then the people knew he had attained the Dao, saying, "Master Hong is not like the rest of us." And they all revered him.

Later, after his elixir was perfected and he ascended as an immortal, the place where he had dwelled was named Green Ox Valley, and his altar site remains there to this day.

Sang Jufeng of White Deer Grotto was a recluse surnamed Sang, named Jufeng, though his origins were unknown. He called himself a *jinshi*. Crude in nature and disposition, he kept himself apart from human sentiment. Once, while lodging at the Purple Ultimate Palace in Guizhou, he bought a length of tripe to fill his meal, then washed it in a vinegar pot with water he had drawn. The Daoist priests found this strange and refused to lend him their pots and cauldrons, so he glared at them in anger. On a winter night in the refectory, only one bed was provided, and the wind and frost cut to the bone through the gaps in the windows on all sides. Jufeng removed his cloth robe, hung it on a rack, and slept soundly in the nude, much to the shock of those around him.

Later, he visited various palaces and paid homage to the Prince of Nanping, wearing one straw sandal and one hemp shoe, calling himself a "wild man." When asked what the "ornamental baton" in the *Zuo Tradition* was, he replied, "A tray of dates, tossed and eaten." All his other answers followed in this manner. Later, in Jiangxia, he reverted to his former madness and unruliness. The military commissioner □ Jian ordered his guards to strip him and expel him from the territory. When he reached Star Lake, he leapt into the air and soared away.

A client general from Jingzhou was dispatched on a mission to Wuchang and reported all he had witnessed. Thereafter, Jufeng spent much time in the northern lands, and whenever he paid his respects, he would inscribe his sleeve with: "Sang Jufeng, Provincial Graduate of the White Deer Grotto in Mount Lu." Many mocked him, yet none knew where he ultimately settled.

Daoist Sima Jiao
Daoist Sima Jiao, also named Ningzheng and Shouzhong, was skilled in arts of unknown origin. He often wandered along the Yangtze, wearing a hempen cap and straw sandals, covering a thousand *li* in a day. His garments remained perpetually new, untouched by wear, and none dared approach whatever he struck. He could feign death, his body swelling and rotting with stench, only to revive moments later.

Once, he stayed at the Kaiyuan Abbey in Chizhou. From Xuanzhou, he traveled to Shezhou, where Daoist Shao Xiumo also journeyed. Upon reaching the city, Sima Jiao proposed they travel together, but Xiumo avoided him and set off first. When Xiumo stopped to rest at an inn in a garrison town, Sima Jiao had already arrived. Xiumo concealed himself to observe and saw Jiao enter another shop, summon the innkeeper, and drink with him. Soon after, Jiao insulted the man, who at first politely declined but was eventually forced to strike back. They grappled until Jiao suddenly collapsed, appearing dead—his body cold, his complexion altered. The entire market gathered to gawk. The villagers bound the innkeeper, searched his person, and recorded his testimony, preparing to send him to the prefecture. As evening fell, they decided to wait until dawn. After midnight, a cry arose from the inn: "Sima Jiao is gone!" Only then did the people realize he had feigned death, and they released the innkeeper.

The next day, Xiumo resumed his journey. After traveling over a hundred *li*, he asked someone, "When did Master Sima pass through here?" The reply: "He went by early this morning." The following day, after another hundred *li*, he asked again and was told, "He passed yesterday morning." Upon reaching Shezhou, the answer was the same. Wherever he traveled among the prefectures along the Yangtze, whenever he lodged at an inn, he would announce before departing, "I cannot take my bamboo utensils with me; I shall burn them." The innkeeper would protest, "The wind is strong, and the bamboo hut is low and cramped—you cannot set a fire!" Ignoring their pleas, Jiao would grow angry, light a fire inside, and stand at the door with a great staff, striking anyone who dared approach. Strong as he was, none dared advance. Soon the flames roared through the gaps in the bamboo roof. The crowd panicked, but when the fire subsided, Jiao’s bamboo utensils were reduced to ash, the bed he had lain on was charred, yet the mat beneath remained unscorched.

Zhu Ao, a legal officer in Chizhou, once received a visit from Sima Jiao, who told him, "Your complexion is ill—you will fall sick. I shall leave now. If, in your illness, you call my true name, I may respond." Zhu dismissed his words, but ten days later, he indeed fell gravely ill with fever. Suddenly recalling Jiao’s warning, he revered him as a divine being and bowed in prayer, invoking his aid. Earlier, during his illness, Zhu had seen a figure at his bedside—a minor clerk named Chen, who wielded a *ruyi* scepter and ordered him to attend Zhu. Zhu had rebuked and dismissed him. No one but his family was permitted inside. Now, in a daze, Zhu saw Chen holding a bowl of medicine. After drinking it, he felt his mind clear and his body ease. He called to his family, "The medicine Chen brought was most effective—bring more!" His family gasped, "We barred him from entering; how could Chen have come?" Then Zhu realized it was Sima Jiao’s divine intervention. From that day, his illness gradually improved.

Once, Sima Jiao resided at an abbey in Shezhou, suffering severely from dysentery. The abbey’s superiors planned to report his condition to the authorities, but first sought his opinion. Jiao grew furious: "My illness is nearly cured—why trouble them?" Yet his condition worsened. Unable to refuse, the abbey’s head reported to the county magistrate, who sent someone to inquire. Jiao demanded, "How did you know of my illness?" When the messenger relayed this, Jiao flew into a rage. He rose at once, dressed, and strode into the mountains, moving as swiftly as if on level ground. Over ten days later, he returned with a great staff, seeking the abbey’s head to strike him. The Daoist priests bowed and pleaded for mercy, and he relented.

Later, in the market of Hongzhou, he bought fresh food. A child shouted, "Daoist eating fresh!" Enraged, Jiao hurled an object at the child, striking his forehead and drawing blood. Patrolmen seized Jiao and brought him before the garrison commander, who, upon hearing his name, rejoiced and tried to persuade him. Jiao instead unleashed a torrent of abuse. Infuriated, the commander had him beaten dozens of times. Jiao remarked to others, "If he had struck me fifteen times, I would have lived fifteen days; ten times, ten days." Soon after, he died as foretold.

Thereafter, he dwelled at the Jianji Abbey on Mount Lu, exploring daily. Even the steepest peaks and cliffs, where others dared not tread, he traversed as easily as flat ground. Later, he lay drunk for days without rising. Before his death, he placed a staff in his coffin. When they buried him and later opened the coffin, they found it empty—only the staff remained.

*Comprehensive Mirror of Perfected Immortals Who Embodied the Dao, Scroll Forty-Four* (conclusion)
*Comprehensive Mirror of Perfected Immortals Who Embodied the Dao, Scroll Forty-Five*

Master Lü Cha—Lü Yan, styled Dongbin and known as Master Pure Yang—is traditionally said to have hailed from Dongping. Another account places his birth in Yongle Town, Puji County, Henan Prefecture of the Western Capital, the present-day Hedong Prefecture of Hezhong. His great-grandfather, Lü Yanzhi, served the Tang and rose to Military Commissioner of Zhedong. His grandfather, Lü Wei, passed the imperial examinations and, during the reign of Emperor Dezong in the Zhenyuan era, advanced to Vice Minister of Rites before retiring as Prefect of Tanzhou. He had four sons: Lü Wen, styled Huaguang, who became Prefect of Quzhou; Lü Gong, who served as Judicial Administrator of the Lingnan Prefecture; Lü Jian, who was a Censor; and Lü Rang, who held the post of Right Mentor to the Crown Prince. Some say he later became Prefect of Haizhou. The Master was Lü Rang’s son.

On the fourteenth day of the fourth month in the twelfth year of the Zhenyuan era (796 CE), he was born beneath a forest of trees. From childhood, he was exceptionally bright, reciting ten thousand words a day. In the second year of the Kaicheng era under Emperor Wenzong (837 CE), he passed the imperial examinations. At the time of his success, he was forty-two years old, with the bearing of a dragon and the eyes of a phoenix, his temples sparse and refined—a countenance of metal and water. He wore a Huayang cap and a carefree robe, his appearance resembling that of Zhang Liang and evoking the likeness of the Grand Historian.

Later, while traveling on Mount Lu, he encountered an extraordinary figure who imparted to him the secret of longevity. Another account states that during the Huichang era of Emperor Wuzong, he twice sat for the imperial examinations without success. While journeying toward Mount Hua in Chang’an, he rested at a wineshop. Presently, a man with a long beard and green eyes arrived from the west and also stopped to rest. The two shared a meal, and the bearded stranger prepared the fire himself. The Master sat basking in the sun and, without realizing it, fell asleep. In his dream, he passed the imperial examinations, ascended through the ranks, and held illustrious office. His memorials to the throne met with approval, and he was appointed to the Hanlin Academy, entered the Grand Secretariat, and was promoted to the emperor’s retinue. Soon after, he was named to the highest echelons of government.

Having served at court for over thirty years, he once made an error in his audience with the emperor and was punished. Stripped of his rank, he was exiled south beyond the Yangtze. On the road, he encountered wind and snow, his servants and horses utterly spent. Desolate and alone, he sighed to himself. Suddenly, he awoke from his dream—the bearded stranger’s millet was still not cooked. The man laughed abruptly and said, *"The yellow grain is not yet done, yet in a single dream you’ve reached Huaxu."* The Master exclaimed in surprise, *"How did you know I had a dream?"* The bearded man replied, *"The dream you just had—wealth and honor are no cause for joy, poverty and lowliness no cause for sorrow. In the grand scheme, success and failure, glory and disgrace, long life and early death, gain and loss—from ancient times to the present, all are but a dream. Wealth and honor are a pleasant dream; poverty and lowliness, a nightmare. Long life is a pleasant dream; early death, a nightmare. The dream you just had was indeed a pleasant one—yet one misstep, and it turns into a nightmare. You already know this well. High rank is but an empty name; riches are like a fire of retribution. Gold and jewels are external things; children and grandchildren belong to others. When a single breath departs, the four elements scatter—what then remains truly enduring?"*

He then inscribed a poem on the wall. The Master, deeply enlightened, bowed and said, *"You are truly an extraordinary man. May I ask your name and homeland?"* The bearded man replied, *"I am Zhongli Quan, the world’s idlest wanderer, dwelling on Mount Zhongnan. If you have awakened, you may follow me."* Thereupon, the Master abandoned his Confucian studies and became his disciple, traveling with him until he attained the Dao.

In the first year of Guangming during the reign of Emperor Xizong (880 CE), he met Master Cui, who transmitted to him the *Mirror of Medicinal Elixirs*, enabling him to cultivate life and nature with flawless precision. Thereafter, he often wandered between Xiangtan, Mount Heng, and E, unknown to others. Once, he inscribed a poem on Yueyang Tower:

*At dawn I roam the Northern Peak, by dusk the verdant Wu,*
*My sleeve enfolds a green serpent—bold my qi and true.*
*Thrice to Yueyang I’ve come, yet none know my face,*
*Reciting aloud, I soar past Dongting’s embrace.*

Many of his poems and essays remain in the world, glimpsed in the *Anthology of True Constancy*. He also composed *Alchemical Secrets*, *Expounding the Orthodox Discourse*, and *The Sword Collection*, each imbued with profound principles, bequeathed to later seekers. Later, he journeyed south to Baling, then west to Guanzhong, ascending to immortality at Purple Pole Mountain. Another account holds that he passed through Jiangzhou, ascended Yellow Crane Tower, and on the twentieth day of the fifth month at noon, ascended to heaven, the year unknown.

In his own autobiography, he wrote: *"I am a native of Jingzhao. In the late Tang, I repeatedly sat for the imperial examinations but failed. While traveling on Mount Hua, I met Zhongli Quan, who transmitted the art of extending life. Later, I encountered the Perfected One of Bitter Bamboo, who taught me the method of sun-moon conjunction. Meeting Zhongli again, I fully grasped the wonders of the golden elixir. At fifty, my Dao was perfected. First, I delivered Guo Shang’ao; second, I delivered the immortal maiden Zhao, whose dharma name was He. Both were quick of wit, so I taught them the method of returning to the root and restoring life. I often roamed between the two Zhe provinces, Bianjing, and Qiao Commandery—my height five feet two inches, my face sallow and fair, my nose straight and prominent, with a mole beneath my left eye the size of a chopstick tip. I usually wore a white-lined robe and hempen sandals. My transformations are unfathomable. The world says I sell ink and fly swords to take men’s heads—I hear this and smile. In truth, I possess three swords: one severs affliction, one severs greed and gluttony, and one severs lust for beauty. Such is my swordsmanship. Those who transmit my spirit do not equal those who transmit my method; those who transmit my method do not equal those who transmit my conduct. How can one who acts contrary to these attain the Dao, even if we walk hand in hand? After my ascension, I often descended among men to transform and deliver them. Disciples of immortality come and go, hidden and revealed, beyond measure or recognition. The details of my earlier and later sojourns among men are recorded in various texts."*

On the twenty-eighth day of the seventh month in the first year of Xuanhe during the reign of Emperor Huizong of Song (1119 CE), an imperial edict was issued: *"We, in Our desire to guide the people toward the Great Dao, honor those immortals whose deeds are recorded in the annals. The Bureau of Sacrifices has reviewed the records and bestowed fitting titles. The Perfected Lord Lü, concealing his radiance and dwelling in distant lands, now graces Our court with his presence. We sigh in admiration at this auspicious sign and confer upon him a name and title. May the divine not perish, and may Our favor be witnessed."* Thus, he was specially enfeoffed as *Perfected Lord of Wondrous Communication*. In the sixth year of Zhiyuan during the reign of Emperor Shizu of Yuan (1269 CE), he was further honored as *Perfected Lord of Pure Yang, Expounder of the Orthodox and Admonisher of Transformation*.

Minister Dao Yi remarked: *"Lü Yan abandoned profit and renounced fame, roaming beyond the world. His spirit manifested the Dao’s transformations, cutting off all ties to the mundane. Consider his poem: ‘Thrice to Yueyang I’ve come, yet none know my face, / Reciting aloud, I soar past Dongting’s embrace.’ Those who hear of his deeds are delighted. As the *Dao De Jing* says: ‘Those who know me are few; thus, I am noble.’ This truly describes Lü Yan."*

**Shi Jianwu**
Shi Jianwu, styled Xisheng and sobriquet Huayang, was a native of Fen Shui in Mu Prefecture. His family had long resided by the Seven Li Rapids of Yanling. From youth, he sat for the imperial examinations and studied the *Book of Rites*, gaining renown for his poetry. Drawn to misty peaks and enamored of the immortals’ art of light ascent, he passed the imperial examinations in the fifteenth year of Yuanhe during the reign of Emperor Xianzong of Tang (820 CE). The chief examiner was Li Jian, Minister of Rites. The assigned rhapsody topic was *The Great Soup*, to be composed without harmonizing flavors. His poem *Early Spring’s Lingering Snow* topped the list, alongside Yao Kang and Yuan Hui, who later gained fame for their poetry and prose. Jianwu alone did not enter officialdom. Zhang Ji, Academician of the Imperial Archives, presented him with a poem: *Though you’ve gained an empty name, it clings not to your frame.* Another poem, *Seeing Off the Recluse Returning East*, contained the line: *You’ve bent to win high fame, now idle wherever you roam.* Thus, Xisheng’s poems referred to himself as *a graduate of Yuanhe, a hermit of Changqing*—for the year after his success in the examinations, the era name changed to Changqing, and he withdrew, never to return.

In the reign of Emperor Wenzong of Tang (827–840 CE), he journeyed from Yanling into the Western Mountains to seek the Dao and dwell in quietude. Initially, Xisheng met Master Jingyang, who transmitted to him the five secrets of inner elixir refinement and the divine formulas of outer alchemy. Later, he encountered Lü Dongbin again, who taught him the great Dao of inner refinement and the golden liquid’s return to cinnabar. Thereafter, he permanently secluded himself in the Western Mountains. Today, about a mile west of the mountain lies Banana Spring. Ascending the stone steps, one finds the site of his study hall, with the stone chamber still standing. A few of the old cypresses he planted remain. His surviving poems and essays are numerous, though less than forty percent of his works are preserved in the mountains. Some of his admonitions to Yanling were inscribed on stone, reading: *"Behold the carved words upon this rock."*

Qiongshan’s Bai Yuchan postscript to *The Collected Works of Shi Huayang* states: Li Zhen often transmitted the secrets of the Taiyi knife-point fire talismans to Zhongli Quan, and Zhongli Quan passed them to Lü Dongbin. Lü was Shi’s master. Shi had a foremost disciple, Li Wenying. In the past, Master Shi imparted to Li sixteen characters, rarely known to the world: *"One wondrous spirit abides; the Dharma-realm is perfectly pervaded. Departing from all extremes, truly grasp the center."* I chanced upon these words and thus shared them with Hu Xizhen, that he might fill the lacuna.

Yang Wuwei’s poem inscribed in the stone chamber reads:
*"From the Jade Capital, high above the golden roster, I departed;
Returning in a white deer-drawn carriage to this stone retreat.
Behind the mountain, a hidden path leads to the Heavenly Treasure Grotto;
Before my eyes lies the dwelling of an earthbound immortal.
At times, a dog’s bark pierces the clear night snow;
Looking back, the red dust teems with frogs in the well.
Five hundred years have passed since men last trod this path—
Above Banana Spring, mist and rosy clouds are locked in embrace."*

Xu Jun
Xu Jun styled himself a man of Penglai in the Eastern Sea. His speech was refined, always drawing from the classics and histories, quick-witted yet profound. He often recited to himself:
*"I once saw the First Emperor bridge the stones across the sea,
While sea gods toiled, swelling the tides in alarm.
Though Penglai lies far beyond the waves, hard to reach,
Ascending the Three Clarities is not so distant."*
He always wore a gourd at his waist, poled a small boat, and drifted upon Ezhu, upstream to the Three Xiang, downstream through the Five Lakes. Often, he would trade fish at riverside markets for wine, then recite verses with locals before departing, his hair turned white. Those fond of marvels claimed to have known him for decades, yet his countenance never aged. When playfully detained and asked to name the weight of his catch, he would fish for a moment and pull up a fish matching the requested measure, astonishing all. If he saw someone ill, he would take medicine from his gourd to cure them. The pills were as small as sesame seeds; he forbade ingestion, insisting they be ground in wine and applied to the chest and abdomen, whereupon the illness would vanish—always miraculously effective. When asked if the medicine could be taken orally, he replied, *"It can, but once swallowed, one loses all taste for food."* Dao seekers who took a single pill went ten years without eating, though they still required wine and water to sustain themselves; their complexions remained rosy, their teeth and hair unaged. Many who received his medicine lived to eighty or ninety. Lu Shan’s Qian Lang repeatedly took his pills and attained great longevity. Today, fishermen on the rivers and lakes sometimes glimpse him; when pursued, his boat flees like the wind, impossible to approach—he is a water immortal.

Qian Lang
The recluse Qian Lang, styled Neiguang, was a native of Hongzhou’s Nanchang. In his youth, he dwelled on West Mountain, studying diligently with noble integrity. He passed the Five Classics examination, held successive official posts, and was renowned for his uprightness; upon leaving office, he left behind fond memories, and contemporary opinion praised him. During Emperor Wenzong’s reign in the Tang, he served as Vice Commissioner of Annan in the early Kaicheng era, later becoming Minister of the Court of Imperial Entertainments before retiring to Lu Shan. Indifferent to worldly affairs, he loved the Dao and became a disciple of Mount Song’s Daoist Xu Jun, mastering the arts of replenishing the brain and returning to the origin, as well as the methods of ingesting and refining elixirs for longevity. In Emperor Zhaozong’s time, Qian Tang’s Prince of Pengcheng, Qian Liu, admired Lang’s attainment of the Dao and long life, and invited him to Qian Tang to serve as his master. By then, Lang was already over one hundred fifty years old, yet his complexion remained youthful, his step light. Several of his great-grandsons had entered officialdom through the classics examinations, serving as high ministers, their hair already white. One day, Lang suddenly announced his farewell: *"I have lived in this world for many years, but now I am summoned by the Upper Clarity and must depart."* Soon after, his breath ceased. For days, his countenance remained serene as in life; when lifted into the coffin, his body was as light as an empty robe—he had achieved liberation in the flesh. His great-grandsons told others, *"Our great-grandfather lived to be over one hundred seventy years old."*

Yang Yunwai
Yang Yunwai, styled Muxian, was a native of Xuzhou. His family had long served in the military, but Yunwai, born with exceptional intelligence, alone disdained the life of armor and weapons. Nearing adulthood, he informed his parents of his wish to become a Daoist. His parents could not dissuade him from his resolve.

At the time, a ruined hermitage stood in the barren mountains, and Yunwai went to dwell there. Soon, a stranger appeared and pointed out a place, saying, *"Beneath lies a cache of coins. You lack food—take what you need."* Later, the stranger also imparted Daoist teachings to Yunwai. Thereupon, his spiritual insight suddenly deepened, and he gained the ability to fast, as well as to tame tigers and wolves. When his parents missed him, Yunwai would return home, yet others saw him still residing in the hermitage—all were greatly astonished.

After a long stay, he departed to wander Mount Lu, where he came and went among a pack of tigers. He traveled through many grotto-heavens. In the final years of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang’s *Dazhong* era, he settled in the gorges, reaching Wanzhou’s Stone City Mountain. Tigers abounded there, yet he sat in meditation among them day and night. The mountain was high and waterless, but soon a spring suddenly welled forth. Before long, he arrived at Yunsheng Abbey in Yun’an.

During Emperor Yizong’s *Xiantong* era, he told others, *"My homeland will face disaster."* That year, in the tenth month, Pang Xun’s rebellion erupted in Pengcheng. Later, under Emperor Xizong’s *Qianfu* reign, Huang Chao rose in Cao and Pu, his influence spreading across the land. The gorges, however, were perilous and remote, and the people relied on their seclusion to feel secure. One day, Yunwai lay drunk in the marketplace, sighing in sorrow, *"This place will see much slaughter—what is to be done?"* Later, when war broke out in the gorges, the very lands Yunwai had left became sites of massacre, blood staining the earth crimson.

In the second year of *Guangqi*, Yunwai visited a young man named Yuan in the town and told him, *"I once owed a debt to the Wang family of Baishui, which I have yet to fully repay—I must settle it."* In the second month, the Wangs indeed rose in rebellion, raiding Yunsheng Abbey. Yunwai met his end, struck down by a blade. Yuan retrieved his body, which appeared as it had in life. Later, some claimed to have seen him traveling between Fangling and Yun’an. The nephew of Li Wenbiao, the prefectural inspector of Yun’an, also encountered him in Chengdu. When Yuan opened the coffin to look, only a short hempen robe remained.

A stele stands at Yunsheng Abbey in Yun’an, its inscription composed by Du Guangting.

Wang Changyu
Wang Changyu was a native of Zizhou.

Wang Changyu served as a prison officer in the prefectural yamen. Once, he ate a pig’s trotter for breakfast but did not finish it, so he put it away. Later, his wife and concubine hid it, and by evening, when they were about to retrieve it, the maidservant Honglian reported its disappearance. Changyu suspected theft and subjected her to flogging. Unable to endure the pain, she falsely confessed. His wife then produced the trotter and said, *"I was only testing you. When you interrogate prisoners, do you not act the same way?"* Changyu was deeply moved and enlightened. From then on, he overturned many wrongful convictions, and his conduct gradually aligned with the Dao.

Soon after, an old man selling medicine in the market claimed it could exterminate rats. Yet for days, no one purchased any. Changyu pitied him and, whenever he encountered the old man, would invite him home for meals. This continued for some time until the old man asked in surprise, *"Does your household suffer from many rats?"* Changyu replied, *"I pity you for making no sales, so I invite you to dine—not to poison rats."* The medicine remained untouched. The old man said, *"Simply use it. The rats may not die."* Changyu returned home, placed the medicine in the food, and rats gathered in great numbers. After eating, they all transformed into wagtails and flew away. Changyu was astonished and went to seek the old man, but he had vanished.

Not long after, a Daoist wandered drunk through the market, clad in strange robes. The people called him the "Fallen Immortal." At the time, Bai Zhaosi governed Shuchuan as military commissioner, and Liu Pi, in rebellion, had forbidden night travel—any caught after dark were put to death. Changyu, serving as a garrison officer in charge of the right district, passed through his jurisdiction one night when he saw a man in strange robes. Upon closer inspection, he recognized the Fallen Immortal. Concealing him without reporting, Changyu helped him home.

Once sober, the Fallen Immortal cursed, *"I had two bolts of fine silk, three taels of silver, and two thousand coins—now they’re gone. It must have been you!"* Changyu did not argue but repaid him the exact amount. The Fallen Immortal took the money and left, saying, *"One day, you will see me on the Lu River."*

Years later, the authorities summoned former officials to transport tax silk, and Changyu was assigned to escort a shipment of silk to Luzhou. On the road to Jiang’an, he encountered two Daoists armed with blades, bows, and arrows. Trembling with fear, Changyu dared not advance. The Daoists called out, *"Is that you? Do not be afraid—we are the Fallen Immortal."* They led Changyu to their dwelling, served him wine, and afterward returned the gold and silk he had once given, saying, *"This was prepared for you today."* With these, Changyu repaid the silk shipment, covering the shortfall, and returned with the official documents.

The Daoist then instructed Changyu: *"Do you know that the yang essence forms the spirit, the yin essence forms the soul, and the union of the two gives rise to divine clarity? The spirit acts through the body, and the body lives by the spirit—when the spirit departs, the body perishes."* Changyu replied, *"I do not understand. I would gladly receive your teaching."* The Daoist said, *"The spirit preserves the body through the Dao, and through arts, it extends your destiny."* He then transmitted the secret of the *Red Dragon Great Elixir*, adding, *"The rat poison you once used was the foundation of external alchemy. Cultivated with fire for three years and consumed, it grants immortality."* He bestowed upon Changyu the name *Yi Xuanzi*.

Calling his attendants, the Daoist presented Changyu with a horse. Though bridleless, it galloped like lightning, soaring straight toward the heavens. In an instant, they reached a towering peak—then, as if stumbling, they stood upon level ground. The horse suddenly spoke: *"I am the dragon of this pool. Do you still recall the elixir formula I taught you?"* It then expounded further. When it finished, the horse leapt into the pool and transformed into a dragon, vanishing in a spray of foam.

Soon after, a woodcutter arrived. Changyu asked where he was, and the man replied, *"Shuchuan."* Changyu inquired the way back, returned to the prefecture, and petitioned for exemption from further service. Thereafter, he refined the elixir on Changping Mountain in the northern outskirts and Fenghuang Mountain in the west. When the pill was complete, he ascended lightly into the heavens. This occurred on the ninth day of the ninth month in the thirteenth year of Emperor Xuanzong’s *Dazhong* era.

**Er Zhu Dong**
Er Zhu Dong, styled Tongwei, was of unknown origin.

In his youth, Er Zhu Dong encountered an extraordinary person who transmitted to him the Dao of returning to the primordial and embracing the One, along with the formula for refining the great elixir of immortality. Thus, he styled himself *Guīyuánzǐ* ("Return-to-the-Origin Master"). During the reign of Emperor Yizong of Tang, he arrived at Pengzhou. The prefecture boasted the Greater and Lesser Peng Mountains, where, according to legend, a man in the time of King Mu of Zhou had carved wood into a sheep, mounted it, and ascended as an immortal. Tongwei remarked, *"This place shares its name with the three mountains of the Eastern Sea, and here, too, lies the path of the sheep-riding immortal. Perhaps I shall attain the Dao here."* He climbed vines, scaled sheer cliffs, and discovered a stone chamber, overjoyed. *"This will suffice for my work,"* he declared. After some time, he departed and sold medicines in the region between Shu and Han. His movements were as light as if riding the void. Often, he would consume congealed blood and washed intestines, drink wine, and recite poetry, leaving others baffled. At the inns where he lodged, the hosts would nightly hear strange creaking sounds from his room. Peering in, they saw his body rise from the bed until it struck the roof beam. Later, they waited until he was drunk and stealthily dusted his abdomen with powder. At dawn, they found it clinging to the rafters, gleaming white. Someone once retrieved an object like a sparrow’s egg from a withered corpse and showed it to Tongwei. He said, *"This is likely the residue of one who consumed the divine elixir but failed to refine it properly. The pure yin dissolved entirely, leaving no yang to accompany it, and thus it congealed in the cinnabar field. If a woman swallows it, she will bear an extraordinary child."* Indeed, a woman who ingested the egg gave birth to a boy whose divine radiance dazzled the sun, filling the room with a wondrous fragrance.

During the *Dashun* era of Emperor Zhaozong of Tang, when Wang Jian besieged Chengdu, Tongwei was also there. His host, distressed, said, *"Jian has sworn that on the day the city falls, he will slaughter all without exception. What is to be done?"* Tongwei replied, *"Do not worry."* He spread out a bamboo mat, gathered Jian and his entire army into it, and they appeared no larger than a swarm of ants. Jian and his troops saw a divine being riding a black cloud, who rebuked them, *"If you dare harm a single hair of my people, your doom will follow."* Terrified, Jian and his men prostrated themselves, crying, *"We dare not!"* When Jian entered Chengdu, he indeed restrained his troops. The markets remained unchanged, and the people were spared. Tongwei then traveled to Guozhou.

Once, in a drunken stupor at the Tianfeng Hermitage, he vomited his elixir into the well, saying, *"This will become a fine medicine."* To this day, those suffering from ailments in the scorching summer recover upon drinking from it. Zhu Feng Mountain in Guozhou, to the south of the prefecture, was the site where Zhu Xian and Li Chunfeng had cultivated their arts. One day, Tongwei said to his friend, the local man Zhang Hongzhi, *"I have long neglected my audience with the Primordial, and now I must hasten to the Xie Immortals’ Mountain to pay homage to the Celestial Pole."* It was a clear winter night, the water clock nearing midnight, when a sudden blizzard descended. Hongzhi, fearing Tongwei would freeze, waited until the last watch before venturing out to find him. He saw Tongwei clad in a single layer of clothing, standing on the outer path, holding up a jade tablet and saying, *"I was on my way to pay homage to the Primordial when I fell by this stream. Listen—the sound of my impact on the boulder must have split it. Go and see."* Hongzhi looked, and indeed, the stone was cleft. Nearby lay a man who had died from drink. Tongwei administered a medicine, and the man immediately revived.

Having spoken thus, Tongwei entered the netherworld. The magistrate there commanded him to return at once, saying, *"A decree from the Perfected One grants you an extension of one twelve-year cycle."* Hongzhi, deeply shaken, begged to be initiated into the Dao. Tongwei replied, *"The celestial fish on your thigh is upside-down—this bodes no good. Only in your next life may you succeed."* Hongzhi’s thigh bore a birthmark shaped like a fish, its head naturally pointing upward; now, indeed, it had inverted.

Tongwei prepared a single elixir pill from cinnabar of Danyang, demanding twelve thousand coins in payment. The prefect summoned him to perform the ritual, but Tongwei said, *"The prefect’s gold is abundant—nothing less than one million two hundred thousand coins will suffice."* Enraged, the prefect accused him of deceiving the masses. He had Tongwei sealed in a bamboo casket and sunk into the river.

At the upper reaches of Fuling, two men were fishing from a boat. When they cast their net, they marveled at its weight. Drawing it in, they found Tongwei inside, his appearance unchanged. The fishermen exclaimed, *"Surely this is no ordinary man—has he entered samadhi?"* They struck a bronze bowl to rouse him. After a moment, Tongwei opened his eyes and gazed at the two, asking, *"Who are you? How far is it from here to Tongliang? Is there a place called Sandu?"* They replied, *"We are from the Two Rivers of Baishi, fishermen of these waters. Tongliang lies four hundred li from here. Eastward from this point is Dengdu County, where the sacred mountain of Pingshan and the immortal abode of Xiandu Temple stand."*

Tongwei said, *"My master told me that when I reached Sandu and saw white stones float upon the water, I would ascend as an immortal—this must be the sign."* Earlier, upon reaching the riverbank, Tongwei had cast many white stones into the water, waiting for them to float, though none understood his purpose.

Having stepped ashore, Tongwei addressed the two fishermen calmly: *"You seem like men of the Dao—have you received any transmission?"* They answered, *"Long ago, we learned the essence of the Three Ones from an immortal of Haishan, refining yang to dissolve yin for many years now."* Tongwei then called for wine, and they drank deeply. He divided his elixir and shared it with them. As they reached the lychee orchard below, banners and regalia descended from the heavens, bearing the three of them aloft upon the clouds.

In Fuzhou, amidst the rocky peaks of Songping, Master Erzhu had planted pines. The stones of the mountain bore the patterns of pine trees, and those who gathered them prayed for fine, naturally formed designs. Later, Tongwei reappeared in the world at Xianjing in Chengdu, where a Daoist encountered him.

According to the *Supplement to the Histories of the Five Dynasties*, Master Erzhu’s merit and conduct were so profound that an extraordinary man gave him a single pill, saying, *"When you see a floating stone, swallow it, and the immortal’s Way will be yours."* The master followed the instruction, casting every stone he encountered into the water. Later, while traveling through the gorges and preparing to cross the river, an old man with a boat of ant-like proportions waited for him. When asked his surname, the old man replied, *"Shi."* Asked to which land he belonged, he answered, *"Fuzhou."*

The master suddenly attained enlightenment, swallowed the pill, and immediately ascended in lightness. **Ying Jing**—Ying Jing’s origins remain unknown. During the reign of Emperor Xizong of Tang, he served as magistrate of Dengfeng, where his governance was benevolent. When Huang Chao invaded the eastern capital, his forces dispatched troops to raid the subordinate counties. The officials and people of Dengfeng were seized with terror, at a loss for what to do. The magistrate said, *"Our district has no armory, no weapons, no grain—how can we defend ourselves?"* He then evacuated the entire county to Mount Songgao, making the mountain itself their fortress. When the rebels pursued them, the magistrate fought in person, defending the people to the death. The rebels withdrew, and the people of Dengfeng were preserved. Later, the magistrate resigned his post to study the Dao and ultimately departed as an immortal. He concealed his surname, becoming known only by his given name, hence called *Magistrate Jing*. During the Yuanyou era of Emperor Zhezong of Song, Liu Ji often encountered him on Mount Songgao—his bearing was untrammeled and vast. Magistrate Jing once transmitted the Dao to Huang Pengshi, as recorded in Pengshi’s own account. Peng, whose personal name was Gefei, was a native of Chi. He rose to the rank of *erqianshi*. From youth, he admired purity and loftiness. Before long, he also met Magistrate Jing at Feixian Cliff on Mount Dapeng. Thereafter, he visited frequently. Magistrate Jing was delighted, clapping his hands in laughter as they drank over a *dou* of wine together. Yet whether seated or standing, he would vanish in an instant, traversing a thousand *li* in the blink of an eye—his movements were unfathomable. One day, Magistrate Jing visited Gefei, and Master Lü arrived floating through the air to join them. They sat together in conversation. Gefei hastily rose, bowed twice, and begged for instruction. The True Man said, *"You already have a teacher."* Gefei’s resolve was not steadfast, and in the end, he failed to succeed—all as Magistrate Jing had foretold, dying of illness.

King Immortal Wang

During the Tianfu era of Emperor Zhaozong of the Tang, King Immortal Wang wandered from Shangdang, passing through the Beina Pass of the Hou clan and entering Mount Song. His mind was vast and empty, his spirit serene and boundless. Though he mingled with fellow practitioners, none knew his purpose. He drifted without attachment, finding joy in stillness and silence. Eventually, he roamed freely through the forests and valleys, losing all sense of direction. At the time, people thought nothing of it.

Over a year later, his disciples—the Daoist priests—and his younger brother Quan journeyed from Huguan, Taihang, Nanchi, and the peaks of Song and Sha, visiting every temple and abode he had passed through, searching for him. At last, they found the Immortal King in a secluded cliff on the northwest of Mount Song. He sat upright within a cavernous hollow, composed and motionless. The cliff towered nearly a hundred *ren* high, its sheer walls impossible to scale. His disciples lit incense, gazed upon him in reverence, and wept with longing, unable to bear leaving. Suddenly, the Immortal King spoke: *"The Most High, recognizing my past minor merits, has appointed me as Immortal Elder of Shaoshi. The paths of immortals and mortals diverge—do not grieve."* With these words, he ascended into the sky.

At that time, the Daoist priests of Songyang—Jiao Yinhuang, Sun Xuanming, Fei Jingyan, and Luo Yingzhi—together offered incense and flowers, gazing toward the cliffside chamber in solemn reverence.

Li Sheng

Li Sheng, styled Yunju, claimed to be from Jiangxia. He was born during the reign of Emperor Dezong of the Tang.

In his youth, Li Sheng was keenly perceptive. As he matured, he mastered a wide range of texts, possessed a quick and eloquent literary talent, and could compose verses extemporaneously. By nature, he was lofty and archaic in spirit. He studied under a Daoist priest of Shaoshi Mountain, learning the arts of refining *qi* and nurturing the body. He often wore plain cloth and wandered throughout the realm.

During that time, Yuan Qi served as regional inspector of eastern Zhejiang, and Bai Juyi governed Qiantang. Both, having been old friends of Sheng, admired his literary skill and Daoist arts, and invited him to be their guest. At a gathering, they asked him: *"You live in an age of great peace—why not seek honor and emolument instead of remaining a commoner for so long?"* He replied: *"I am not burdened by worldly entanglements."* Even when summoned to office, he refused.

Then he slowly recited:
*"Born in a Confucian age amid peace,
The black cap weighs heavy, the plain cloth is light.
Who would chase fame and profit on the world’s path?
I serve the Jade Emperor and return to the Upper Clarity."*

Yuan and Bai marveled at him. They kept him for over a year with poetry and wine, but he eventually departed for other travels, and none knew his whereabouts.

In the first year of Guangming during the reign of Emperor Xizong, after Huang Chao’s rebellion had thrown the realm into chaos, only the lands south of the Yangtze remained somewhat stable. Tian Yue, the military governor of Wanling, was fond of Daoist arts. Fifty years earlier, elders in Wanling had known Sheng as a child, and when he arrived, they remarked that his appearance had not changed since then—people found this extraordinary. Yue welcomed him and treated him with even greater reverence as a master. Sheng was lithe and vigorous, appearing no older than forty, with jet-black hair, square pupils, and teeth as sharp as rows of jujube pits. He enjoyed eating stone lotus seeds, biting through a *sheng*’s worth in an instant, snapping each in two—a feat no one could imitate. He could drink two *dou* of wine without becoming drunk, fast to cultivate *qi*, and stand in snow wearing only a single layer of clothing while his complexion grew ever more ruddy. At times, he would extend his middle finger toward a lamp over a *zhang* away, and the flame would flicker as if blown by a draft through a crack. No one knew what elixirs he consumed.

When asked about the arts of Daoism and longevity, he always deflected with vague replies. One day, he suddenly told others: *"I am weary of this endless strife of war—it would be better to depart."* At that time, Emperor Zhaozong had been usurped by Zhu Quanzhong. Upon hearing this, Sheng was indignant. The next day, he suddenly ceased breathing, his complexion unchanged. When they lifted him into the coffin, only his empty clothes remained. He was one hundred and forty-seven years old.

Within a month, Tian Lin’s army met defeat, and disaster struck. Sheng had already sensed this beforehand and departed, having once spoken of it to others. All who recalled his words marveled at him as an extraordinary man. Later, there were repeated sightings of him in Shu, appearing as he had before.

Yi Yongchang
Yi Yongchang’s origins were unknown. In the late Tang, he donned a feathered cloak and roamed the lands south of the Yangtze. Wild and unrestrained in his drinking, the world called him "Madman Yi." His wife, though young, was skilled in music and needlework, mastering all their subtleties. When wealthy young men teased her with words or laughter, her demeanor remained unyielding, as if untouchable. Yongchang loved composing *Wang Jiangnan* lyrics, and the couple would sing them in harmony, heedless of those around them. They often spent nights in abandoned temples or ruined shrines.

Once, he died in Liling, yet in the Tianyou era of Emperor Aidi, he appeared in Nancheng County of Jianchang. One evening, both he and his wife suddenly perished. The garrison commander, surnamed Ding, buried them together by the roadside with a strip of medicinal herbs. A year later, the commander arrived in Zhongling. One day, beneath the market stalls of the northern quarter, he saw Yongchang and his wife singing *Wang Jiangnan*. Yongchang accompanied the commander to a tavern, where they drank heavily. Intoxicated, the couple linked arms and sang loudly as they left the city and crossed the river. Arriving at Youwei Temple, they inscribed the temple wall, signing themselves as the "Divine King of the Crimson Dragon of the Upper Realm." Then they entered the western mountains and were never seen again.

Hu Erlang
Hu Erlang once saw a Daoist lying drunk in the middle of a thoroughfare in Chengdu. Taking pity on him, Erlang would, whenever the Daoist was inebriated, prop his head with a stone. One day, the Daoist awoke to find Erlang beside him. Moved by his kindness, he urged him to cultivate the Dao and sang to admonish him:

*To fathom the principle of cinnabar,*
*Its mysteries lie nowhere to be found.*
*Yet lead and mercury never depart,*
*For gold emerges from water unbound.*

*When gold is refined, water must be near,*
*But water meets earth—its rise is no more.*
*Only with fire’s timing, precise and clear,*
*Can the elixir’s subtle truth restore.*

*In this world, death’s certainty is plain,*
*Yet men cling to crimson and purple vain.*
*How can they know time slips like a fleeting spark,*
*And think life’s glow will never dark?*

*Why not turn your heart to the supreme Way,*
*And cease chasing years that fade away?*
*You drown in wine, lost in drunken delight,*
*Yet the mirror reveals your withering plight.*

*Heed my words, Erlang, take them to heart,*
*For the land of immortals is never apart.*
*All I’ve said is but this—do not delay,*
*Nor cling to luxury, refusing to stray.*

*Your kindness has moved me to speak with care,*
*Turn back now, seek the path to repair.*
*These verses I sing, though brief, bridge past and now,*
*From ancient days to this very brow.*

Erlang said, "May I know your name?"
The Daoist replied, "I am Erzhu."

The Daoist then went to a butcher’s stall, bought pig’s blood to fill intestines, placed them in a vat, and had Erlang eat them. Erlang found the taste sweet and savory, realizing then that the Daoist was no ordinary man. After the Daoist departed, Erlang too transformed. When his family prepared for burial, they marveled at the lightness of his coffin. Opening it, they found only a bamboo staff inside.

Zhang Ao—Zhang Ao, of unknown origin, attained the Dao in the late Tang. After ascending as an immortal, he often visited the chamber of Master Li Chengying of the Jade Bureau’s Huadong Grotto. In the ninth month of the fifth year of Emperor Shenzong’s Xining reign, he also sold medicine in the marketplace, unrecognized by all. When scholar-officials encountered him on the road, they were struck by his composed demeanor, his refusal to bow in greeting, and his majestic bearing—unlike other medicine vendors. The next day, they learned he was the Master, yet he had vanished without a trace.

Chengying, styled Yingzhi, could foretell fortune and misfortune. When Minister Zhao Qingxian was appointed magistrate of Jiangyuan, Chengying once said, "In such-and-such a year, you will enter Shu." Later, it came to pass. When Zhao was later transferred to oversee transport in Zizhong, Chengying again said, "You will be moved to Chengdu." And so it was. Prefect Nie Zhongyou of Hanzhou deeply wished to summon Chengying, but he refused, remarking, "This man’s celestial prison star stirs." In the end, Nie could not secure his presence. None of Chengying’s predictions ever failed to prove true, for he had received teachings from the Master.

Li Mengfu

Li Mengfu, of unknown origin, resided in Nanchang during the early Kaiping era of the Later Liang Taizu. Free-spirited and unrestrained, he often hung a fish from his fishing rod and sang the *Fisherman’s Song*. His lyrics were ever-renewed, and people vied to purchase them, using the money he earned to enter taverns. At times, he would break the ice and plunge into the water; upon emerging, his breath steamed like vapor. When conversing with others, he composed poems extemporaneously.

At the time, Zhong Chuan governed Nanchang, and Li Qiong, the prefect of Guizhou, sent a letter to Zhong, saying: "Mengfu is my younger brother; I would be grateful if you could send him home." Zhong ordered a search for him in the markets and inns, but his whereabouts were already unknown.

Master Yue Zichang

Master Yue, whose given name was Zichang, was a native of Hailing. During the Kaiping era of the Later Liang Taizu, his household brewed fine wine, and he was fond of the Dao. Whenever guests arrived, he would offer them drink. Even if someone disguised themselves in Daoist robes, Master Yue would still pour them wine.

Later, a Daoist arrived and exclaimed in surprise: "You serve each person only three *sheng* of wine—how could that suffice for me?" Master Yue asked: "How much can you drink?" The Daoist replied: "My drinking knows no bounds." Yue then let him drink freely. By evening, the Daoist was so drunk that he fell into a vat and died. Fearing the consequences, Master Yue secretly sealed the vat and buried it along with its stand.

Three days later, a fragrant aroma arose, and the Daoist emerged from the burial site. When they opened the grave, they found the wine vat, its contents now a deep crimson hue, with an extraordinary, intoxicating fragrance. Master Yue rejoiced, saying: "This extraordinary man has made my home a dwelling for immortals!" He and his family drank the wine to the last drop, then all ascended into the clouds and departed. Only his nephew fell to the ground, crying: "Those who eat garlic cannot ascend!" Yet even he lived to be over a hundred years old. Later, a Temple of Heavenly Celebration was built on the site.

Wu Hanxu, the Daoist—styled Heling—possessed an air of refined elegance and never descended the mountain. He passed his days in intoxication, yet kept no cooking utensils, so the common folk called him "Wu the Drunkard." Fond of sleep, he would go for ten-day stretches without eating. He often said: "If one wishes for leisure, one must first be idle; diligence leaves no room for leisure." Though he had never studied literature, he suddenly composed an *Ascension Song*:

*A decree from the Jade Emperor appoints me to immortal office—*
*The dragon spouts clouds, the phoenix lends its strength.*
*Before my eyes, pavilions and terraces appear in an instant,*
*With strange grasses and wondrous flowers beyond recognition.*
*I gaze upon the world from the Great Veil,*
*The world no larger than the palm of my hand.*
*Had I not hastened to ascend,*
*I would have been swept away to Yingzhou in a single moment.*

In the second year of the Later Tang Emperor Li Congke’s Qingtai reign, he ascended.

There was also an eremitic scholar from Ketao, the Iron-Crowned Master Fan, who admired Heling’s Way. He would often ride a white ox to visit him. The Chu king Ma Xifan once took him as his teacher. Later, when Ma Xifan succeeded to the throne, the Master vanished without a trace.

Li Yunqing
Li Yunqing’s origins are unknown.

Li Yunqing was broadly learned in the classics and histories and excelled in poetry, leaving behind *Twenty Scrolls from the Mountain Studio*. Though eminent officials repeatedly summoned him to office, he declined every appointment. He often said: "The loftiest immortals and transcendent beings must strictly observe precepts and conduct, and secretly perform deeds to aid all beings." Thus, he turned his mind to the healing arts to save lives. His spirit was keen and perceptive; whenever he prescribed medicine, he never took life, using only minerals, plants, and trees. He remarked that the formulas transmitted by ancient immortals to later generations sometimes included insects and fish as ingredients, and that those who could not act with such restraint should take heed. He first lived in reclusion on West Mountain, later moving to the northern foothills of Mount Lu. From regions spanning several provinces and a thousand *li*, those seeking his medical aid filled his gate, yet he accepted no gifts of gold or silk. He abstained from desire and forswore meat. His dwelling stood near the Temple of the Nine Heavens’ Messenger, and each dawn and dusk he prayed: "I, so-and-so, use medicine to relieve the suffering of the people, seeking no power or profit. May I never waver in this resolve through all future lives. O luminous and all-knowing spirit, grant me your protection." He lived on the mountain for over sixty years, his complexion golden and radiant, his gaze piercing. Those who knew him all said it was the result of his hidden merits.

One day, while following herb-gatherers deep into the mountains, he suddenly saw a man in a round cap and purple robe. The man bowed and said: "I am the spirit of this mountain. The Perfected King of the Nine Heavens’ Messenger has sent me with a command: in recognition of your merit in aiding beings, I am to bestow upon you the Great Clarity Nine-Flower Divine Elixir and the Jade Script of the Heavenly Emperor of the Grand Tenuity’s *Flying Celestial Net and Earthly Register*. From now on, you must sever all contact with the world of men and devote yourself wholly to cultivation." Li Yunqing bowed again and asked: "May I be permitted to see the Nine Heavens’ Messenger?" The spirit replied: "Though you have abstained from desire and meat, you still engage with the world’s people, and your defiled *qi* has not yet been purified—you may not see him." Then, placing the divine elixir and jade script in his hands, the spirit vanished.

From that time on, Li Yunqing withdrew far from the world. He built a chamber in the emptiness of Shengzhi Peak, and from the reign of Emperor Muzong of the Great Tang to the second year of Tongguang in the Later Tang, on the first day of the eighth month, he ascended to immortality in broad daylight.

Zhang Jianming
Zhang Jianming was a man of Yan.

In his youth, Zhang Jianming traveled through the Hebei region as a scholar of Confucian learning, but later left to become a Daoist. He mastered the teachings of Laozi and Zhuang Zhou. In the ninth month of the fourth year of Tianfu in the reign of Emperor Gaozu of Later Jin (a *jihai* year, on the *xinmao* day), the emperor summoned him for an audience and asked: "Can the Daoist Way govern the state?" He replied: "The Dao is that which is spoken of as wondrously pervading the ten thousand things, and virtue is that which is praised as embracing the Two Modes. One who attains its ultimate may dwell in stillness between mat and couch, yet govern heaven and earth." The emperor marveled at his words and invited him into the inner palace to lecture on the *Daodejing*, appointing him as his teacher.

One day, Jianming suddenly heard the sounding of the time-drum in the palace and said: "Does Your Majesty hear the drum? Its sound is but one, yet among the five notes and twelve pitches, the drum has none. Yet it is the drum that harmonizes them. The One is the root of the ten thousand affairs. One who can preserve the One may govern all under heaven." The emperor approved of this.

On the fifth day of the fifth month of the fifth year, he was granted the title *Master of Penetrating the Mysterious*. Later, his whereabouts became unknown.

Minister Dao Yi remarked: "Zhang Jianming may be called one who delved deeply into the Dao. Observe his answer to the emperor’s question: 'One who attains its ultimate may dwell in stillness between mat and couch, yet govern heaven and earth.' The *Daodejing* states: 'Without stepping outside, one knows all under heaven; without peering through the window, one sees the Dao of heaven. The farther one goes, the less one knows.' Thus the sage knows without traveling, names without seeing—precisely this meaning. Again, he answered: 'One who can preserve the One may govern all under heaven.' All this derives from the *Daodejing*."

He Yuan
He Yuan’s origins are unknown. He served the Later Jin as Vice Director of the Ministry of Works and attained the Dao without dying. When Emperor Zhenzong of Song was en route to perform the Feng sacrifices at Mount Tai, the Vice Director of the Ministry of Works paid his respects by the roadside, bowed deeply, and departed. By evening, when the imperial procession reviewed the list of those who had presented themselves, the emperor was greatly astonished.

The poems left at his farewell read thus:

First:
Sober days grow few, drunken days many,
Chanting the wind, savoring the Dao—lofty and steep.
The deep palace knows not a lone minister’s cares;
Amid the world’s tangled affairs, what can wine do?

Second:
Thrice serving the court, his merits stand alone, towering;
Though aged, his concern for the people’s plight never wanes.
Would that the eight directions share one intoxication!
This heart—how could the world ever know?

An imperial edict ordered officials to seek him out, but he could not be found.

In the early Tian Sheng era of Emperor Renzong’s reign, his disciple Yu Cheng journeyed to the capital to present images of the Buddha and Laozi, valued at hundreds of thousands. There was also a man named Qiao Quan, who in his youth contracted leprosy. Leaving his home, he abandoned himself in the wild mountains. There he met the Vice Director of the Ministry of Works, who taught him to eat pine fat, gradually instructing him in the Dao. At eighty, he ascended and descended mountains as if flying. He often traveled with the Vice Director, once crossing a river in Wei by walking upon its waters.

In the early Yuan You era of Emperor Zhezong’s reign, Quan came to the eastern capital and met Su Shi, styled Zizhan. He said: “My master once traveled in Mizhou and met you on the road to Changshan. He seemed pleased with you.” Zizhan detained him, but he would not stay. He said: “My master has appointed to meet me at Mount Meng on the Lantern Festival.” Zizhan composed a poem to send Quan off, and also wrote five quatrains to send to the Vice Director.

From then on, none in the world ever saw the Vice Director again.

Guo Shuxian
Guo Shuxian was a native of Luoyang and lived during the Five Dynasties. From youth he was skilled in composition, excelled in calligraphy and philology, and mastered the Nine Classics. At seven, he passed the child prodigy examination.

Later, during the Later Han, the Duke of Xiangyin summoned him as an aide. Previously, he had quarreled with his clerk Dong Yi over an affair and left in indignation. The founding ancestor of the Later Zhou later appointed him as a *Zhouyi* Academician. At the beginning of the Song dynasty, he clashed with Supervising Censor Fu Zhaowen in anger at the court hall and was demoted to serve as Registrar of Qianzhou. When his term expired, he resigned and never again took office. Roaming freely between Qi, Yong, Shaan, and Luo, he would address anyone he met—whether noble or base—simply as "Miao." If he came upon mountains and rivers, he would linger for ten days without leaving. At times, he would fast for nearly a hundred days without eating. In the height of summer, he would expose his body to the sun, yet his clothes remained dry of sweat. In the depths of winter, he would break the ice to bathe, and only when the ice began to melt would he emerge. Emperor Taizong, having long heard of his name, summoned him back to the capital and lodged him in the quarters of Palace Attendant Dou Shenxing. Shuxian had a long, fine beard, but one day he shaved it all off. Shenxing, startled, asked the reason, to which Shuxian replied: "Merely to imitate the frown." Shenxing flew into a rage. Taizong, deeming him lacking in restraint, appointed him as a minor official at the Directorate of Education and moved him out to the National University.

He indulged further in wine and spoke freely of current affairs, leading to his demotion to Dengzhou. Upon reaching Qizhou and arriving at Linyi, he said to the escorting officer: "I am departing." Thereupon, he halted by the roadside and dug a pit just large enough to fit his face. Peering into it, he died, and his body was interred by the wayside. Months later, his old acquaintances exhumed and reburied him, finding only his clothes and cap remaining—his body had vanished. This was a case of *shijie* (corpse liberation).

**Chen Tao**
Chen Tao, a native of Shupu, was fond of learning from a young age and skilled in astronomy, as well as in composing odes and hymns. Foreseeing that the Southern Tang ruler Li’s reign was in decline, he abandoned all aspirations for officialdom. Instead, he built a hermitage on West Mountain, finding joy in chanting poetry and devoting himself to self-cultivation. His *Miscellaneous Poems of Leisurely Living* survive to this day. During the *Kaibao* era of the Song Taizu, a man once saw an old man with a topknot and clad in coarse cloth, accompanied by an alchemist, entering the city to refine medicines. With the money they earned, they would purchase fresh food, gather by the furnace, and eat and drink together as if no one else were present. When drunk, they would sing, and people took them for Tao and his wife—or claimed he had already attained immortality. Today, the Xiangcheng Temple on West Mountain still houses his reading hall.

**Sun Cheng**
Sun Cheng’s origins are unknown. He was skilled in poetry and could foresee fortune and misfortune. Upon visiting Mount Lu, he inscribed a poem on the Temple of the Nine Celestial Messengers:
*Alone I enter the dark palace to pay homage to the Perfected,
Burning incense not for my lowly, impoverished self.
On both banks of the Qinhuai, bones pile like sand,
At Ganpu, a thousand households’ blood stains the dust.
Who is master of Mount Lu’s clouds and mist?
To whom do Tiger Creek’s wind and moon belong?
The Prefect of Jiujiang, loyal to his king’s cause,
Would do well to dispatch celestial troops across the strategic ford.*

Within a few years, Jinling fell into chaos, and Jiujiang was heavily besieged. The people suffered terribly, and the events unfolded exactly as his poetic prophecy had foretold. Later, he died in Nanchang. When his body was cast into the river, it floated upstream against the current. All who witnessed this marveled, believing he had attained the Dao and departed as a *shijie* immortal.

**Xu Jian**
Xu Jian, styled Jieshi, was a native of Lujiang.

Some accounts claim Xu Jian was a descendant of Yin Mu, the former Chief Clerk of Jin Japan. Though his appearance was uncouth and strange, standing seven feet tall, he habitually wore a hempen turban and straw sandals, his short robe barely reaching his knees. Possessing no worldly goods, he carried only a cloth sack upon his back. By nature, he loved wine and excelled at composition, particularly delighting in chanting poetry. Once, he presented a memorial to the Southern Tang ruler, and later submitted poems to the Academician Xu Xuan, only to leave in disdain. He lived without regard for seasons, always holding a large fan, styling himself the "Wild Man of Jiangnan." Upon the fan, he inscribed a quatrain:

*Chanting but to express the wonders within my breast,*
*Drinking, I forget both fame and name’s bequest.*
*My heart’s sole wish: eternal leisure with verse and wine,*
*A stream’s wind and moon to share in purity divine.*

He also inscribed a poem at the Abbey of Simplicity and Tranquility:

*Ever grieved the true Dao’s thousand-year concealment,*
*Yet this grotto-heaven grants free roaming content.*
*Ancient pines cast their hues o’er the silent altar’s peace,*
*Phoenix and crane depart, the Milky Way’s heights increase.*
*The Maos’ well runs cold, alchemical elixirs long spent,*
*The Xuanzong stele lies broken, dreams of immortality rent.*
*Clearly, a path to longevity exists—*
*Why sigh o’er graying temples midst the red dust’s bliss?*

During the Qiande era of the Song Taizu, his collected works circulated widely. By nature, he was quiet and reserved, indifferent to fame. His dwelling was never fixed; he often stayed at the Abbey of Simplicity and Tranquility or White Deer Grotto, leaving no trace of his comings and goings. Whenever he felt the need to bathe, he would enter a mountain stream or ravine fully clothed, emerging to dry his garments upon the rocks. To this day, the "Xu Jian Drying Stone" remains in the great ravine of the Abbey of Simplicity. He owned a tripod cauldron with a three-*sheng* capacity; whenever he caught fish, he would cook or roast them whole, scales and entrails intact, without washing or seasoning. Once done, he would eat them at once.

He shared a close friendship with Fan Ruoshui. When Fan crossed northward and, during the Taiping Xingguo era of the Great Song, oversaw transport in Jiangnan, he encountered Xu Jian at the Abbey of Simplicity. Urging him to accept an official salary, Xu Jian frowned and remained silent. Fan then cut three hundred strings of cash from his stipend as wine money and presented the voucher to him. Xu Jian accepted without thanks. For half a year, he never spoke a word. When others pleaded on Fan’s behalf, he would buy wine and fish, drinking merrily until dancing in drunkenness. If someone borrowed the voucher to visit the government office, he would comply. When Fan was about to retire and sought the return of the old voucher, it had vanished without a trace. Such was his carefree and self-assured manner.

Later, he traveled to Mount Mao or Mount Jiuhua, following his whims, leaving others unable to fathom his intentions. He was never seen cooking a meal. Once, in Yangxian, he crossed the Western Ford one day, suddenly striding across the waves as if walking on land. The onlookers were astonished, deeming him a divine being. In the final years of the Jingde era of Emperor Zhenzong, he died in Jinling. Over a year later, the Vice Minister of War, Chen Jing, moored his boat on the Qinhuai River and remarked that two days prior, he had seen Xu Jian visit him at Hongjing Well, his calling card still in hand. Yet when he searched the seat, nothing remained. People believed he had attained *shijie* and departed as an immortal.

Shen Lin

Shen Lin, styled Tingrui, was a native of Junyang and the second son of Shen Bin, a Minister of Personnel in the Tang dynasty. From childhood, his conduct was extraordinary, and he was deeply fond of the principles of stillness and non-being. His filial piety was profound; when his father died, he built a hut by the grave and remained there for three years, during which turtledoves gathered at the tomb. Later, he abandoned his wife to study the Dao on Mount Magu—or, as some say, Mount Yusun. He always wore a single hempen robe, undeterred by wind or snow. When people gave him new clothes, he often passed them on to the poor or discarded them. Fond of wine and skilled in poetry, his contemporaries called him "Shen the Daoist."

He would stride directly into prefectural or county offices, taking a seat unannounced. One day, as the magistrate was hearing a case, Lin arrived drunk. The magistrate teased him, asking, *"Shen the Daoist, when will your Dao be perfected?"* Lin immediately wrote on the magistrate’s desk:

*Why ask when my Dao will be complete?*
*The Purple Court and Clear Capital await their time.*
*No one knows the herbs I dig by hand,*
*Nor sees the immortal bones within this mortal frame.*
*With talismans I send dragons and serpents fleeing,*
*With seals I shift seas and mountains at will.*
*One day, who shall lead the way to the cinnabar clouds?*
*The Azure Lad shall guide the chariot, purple mists trailing behind.*

He could walk hundreds of *li* in a day, traveling between Mount Yusun and Floating Cloud Mountain, resting in forests or sleeping under the open sky. During the *Baoda* era of the Southern Tang, he arrived at the Refined Contemplation Abbey on Mount Yusun, where he donned the cap and robe of a Daoist adept, entered seclusion to cultivate *qi*, and was rarely seen. On the fifteenth day of the first month in the second year of the *Yongxi* era of Emperor Taizong of Song, at midday, he adjusted his cap and robe, closed the door, burned incense, and sat in meditation. Clenching his fists, he departed this world.

His fellow Daoists buried his remains west of the Massed Jade Peaks, east of Iron Pillar Ridge. Twenty days later, a Daoist from the same mountain, Zeng Zhaoying, came to visit Mount Yusun. On the road, he encountered Lin, who, when asked where he was going, replied, *"I am making a brief visit to the Mysterious Capital, then shall soon enter Mount Lu."* He left two volumes of the *Scripture of Salvation* and a poem for Zhaoying:

*North, south, east, west—matters of the world,*
*Do people ever meet again?*
*Once I dwelt on Jade Bamboo Peak,*
*Now I return to the Mysterious Capital.*
*Clouds drift boundless across the sky,*
*The sound of springs falls on lone stones.*
*In the cinnabar clouds, I have an appointment—*
*I go to gather calamus and sweet flag.*

Zhaoying, struck by his extraordinary words, hurried to the abbey to inquire. His disciples said, *"He has ascended as a feathered immortal."* Zhaoying showed them the scripture and poem, and all recognized his handwriting, astonished. Zhaoying and his brother went to the burial site and found a slip of paper by the grave, bearing a poem:

*In vain we toil at burial before Jade Mountain,*
*Who knows the cicada has already shed its husk?*
*It must be that the primordial spirit has returned to the Purple Court,*
*No lingering soul remains in the Yellow Springs.*
*The medicine bag holds only the alchemical formula,*
*The world retains but the writings of enlightenment.*
*How lamentable are the affairs of this fleeting life, past and present—*
*Beneath Northern Yu Mountain, the grass grows lush.*

When they examined the grave, they found an opening about a *chi* wide, opening to the left, containing only an empty coffin. Some said he had attained *shijie*. Many in the south knew of him.

He once sent a poem to his old friend Chen Zhizhou:

*Since we parted, parting makes reunion rare.*
*The golden crucible melts the red sun,*
*The cinnabar field nurtures purple mushrooms.*
*To visit you is hard to arrange,*
*Yet how could I not hold you in my thoughts?*
*Do not envy the bustle of worldly affairs—*
*How long can a hundred years last?*

Zhizhou later passed the imperial examinations during the *Duangong* era and was appointed as a magistrate in Hengyang, where he remained until his death.

The *Annals of the Southern Tang* records: Shen Bin’s second son, Tingrui, possessed Daoist arts. Fond of wine and abstaining from grain, he wore a single hempen robe through cold and heat for decades without change. He could walk hundreds of *li* in a day, resting in forests or sleeping under the stars, often on Mount Yusun or Floating Cloud Mountain. Though he aged, he did not decline, and his end remains unknown.

**Huang Wanhui**

The Daoist Huang Wanhui of Mount Wu often healed people with talismans and medicines. When the Lord of Shu, Wang Jian, summoned him, he spread grass upon the water’s surface and drifted upstream, arriving in Chengdu in a single day.

**Volume 47 of *Comprehensive Mirror of Perfected Immortals Who Embodied the Dao***

**Chen Tuan**

The Master’s surname was Chen, his given name Tuan, his courtesy name Tunan, and his sobriquet Fuyaozi. A native of Zhenyuan in Bozhou, he hailed from the same village as Laozi—though some say he was from Chongrong in Puzhou, likely a later place of retreat. From birth, he could not speak.

When he was four or five, he played by the banks of the Wo River. A woman in blue robes took him into her arms and nursed him, and from that moment, he could speak, his intelligence surpassing others. As he grew, he mastered the classics and histories at a glance—some say he abandoned childish games from the time he first tied up his hair. By fifteen, he had thoroughly studied the *Book of Songs*, the *Book of Rites*, calligraphy, mathematics, and even medical texts on prescriptions.

After his parents’ deaths, the Master said: *"What I have learned thus far suffices only to record names. I shall abandon this path, ascend the peak of Mount Tai, and beneath the towering pines, discuss the Dharma of transcendence with Anqi and Huangshi. Together, we shall compound the elixir of immortality. How could I bear to wallow in worldly flattery, trapped in the cycle of birth and death?"* He then distributed all his family’s wealth to others, keeping only an iron cauldron before departing.

The scholar-officials of the Tang, drawn to his pure spirit, longed to meet him. To them, his presence was like the rare appearance of a comet or iridescent clouds, and they vied to catch a glimpse. Yet the Master refused all their overtures. Thus, he severed ties with worldly affairs, donning a rustic cap and hempen robes. He sang as he walked, sat in joy, and wandered through markets as if entering an empty realm. Sometimes he ascended wine towers, other times he lodged in roadside inns, often roaming between the capital and the provinces.

Later, Emperor Mingzong of Later Tang heard of his reputation and personally penned an edict summoning him. When the Master arrived, he greeted the emperor with a deep bow. Mingzong treated him with even greater reverence, bestowing upon him the title *Qingxu Hermit* and gifting him three palace ladies. The Master submitted a memorial in gratitude, writing:

*"The renowned courtesans of Zhao, the virtuous ladies of the Han court—graceful in bearing, born of good families. Once they entered the deep palace, they enjoyed long years of wealth and honor. Once celestial beings, now fallen among mortals. Your servant dares not keep them in his private residence and has respectfully housed them in a separate lodge. My nature is like that of the deer or the elk—rootless as duckweed, drifting like a cloud before the wind, adrift as a boat without moorings. I return them to the imperial precincts."*

He also composed a poem for the emperor’s perusal:

*"Snow for flesh and jade for bones—
I thank Your Majesty for this gift.
Yet this hermit harbors no dreams of Wu Gorge;
why trouble the clouds and rain to descend from Yang Terrace?"*

Having submitted the memorial and poem via the palace eunuch, he departed at once. Thereafter, he wandered freely among mountains and rivers. He once claimed to have met Sun Junfang and the Recluse in Deerskin, who told him that the Nine-Chambered Cliff of Mount Wudang was an ideal place for seclusion. He went there to dwell, practicing breath cultivation and grain avoidance, living in tranquil silence for over twenty years. He composed the *Eighty-One Chapters on the Mysteries of the Finger and the Elixir*, the *Fifty Poems on Entering the Chamber and Returning with the Cinnabar*, and the *Fishing Pond Collection* of over ten thousand characters—all meticulously expounding the wonders of the Dao and encompassing the ultimate truth.

One night, as he stood in his courtyard, a golden figure holding a sword appeared and called out: *"Your Dao is complete. You shall have a place of return and fulfillment."* The Master replied: *"The golden figure speaks of a place of return—autumn is the season when the myriad things gather and return. Shall I then withdraw to the West?"* By this time, he was already over seventy.

Soon after, he moved to Mount Hua, where he found the ruins of the ancient Cloud Terrace Abbey. Clearing the overgrowth, he made it his home, fulfilling the prophecy of his "place of return." At the time, tigers in the region were preying on people. When the Master arrived, he rebuked the tigers and ordered them to leave, and from then on, they ceased their attacks.

During the Kaiyuan era of the Tang, a man named Li Qi lived as a recluse in Huayang. Though his complexion retained the bloom of youth, he could traverse hundreds of *li* in an instant. He befriended the Master, and they exchanged poems. The Master often shut his door and lay abed for months without rising. During the Xiande era of Emperor Shizong of Zhou, a visitor peered through his window and saw only dust-covered boards, hearing only the cries of beasts and crows.

A woodcutter on the mountain’s slope came upon a body covered in hardened dust. Drawing near, he realized it was the Master. He pressed a hand to the Master’s chest and found it still warm. After a long while, the Master’s breath returned. Rising, he said: *"I was in the midst of a deep sleep—why disturb me?"*

The prefect of the region, Luo Yanwei, reported this to the emperor. Shizong summoned the Master to the palace. After more than a month, he finally rose. The emperor questioned him about the arts of alchemy.

The Master replied: *"Your Majesty rules the Four Seas and ought to devote yourself to governance—why fixate on such trifling arts?"* (The *Comprehensive Mirror in Aid of Governance* records: *"Your Majesty is the Son of Heaven, with the duty of ordering the realm—what need is there for this?"*) Shizong did not take offense. He appointed the Master as Remonstrance Grandee, but the Master firmly declined. The emperor bestowed upon him the title "Master of White Clouds" and sent him back to the mountains, decreeing that local officials regularly inquire after him.

Though the Master possessed the talent to order the world, he lived through the chaos of the Five Dynasties. Each time he heard of a dynastic revolution, he would knit his brows and sigh. He once wrote a poem:

*Ten years my tracks have trod the red dust,*
*Yet turning, green hills haunt my dreams.*
*Though purple streets bloom bright with glory,*
*What sleep compares? Though gates be gilded, poverty is richer.*
*I grieve to hear the sword and spear propping up a tottering lord,*
*And chafe to listen to pipes and songs that deafen the drunk.*
*I’ll take my old books back to my old retreat—*
*Where wildflowers bloom and birds cry, spring is the same as ever.*

One day, riding a donkey through Huayin, he heard that Emperor Taizu of Song had ascended the throne. He laughed aloud: *"Now the realm is settled at last!"* Thereupon he withdrew to Mount Hua and did not emerge again. When Taizu summoned him, he did not go. Only at the beginning of the Xingguo era did he finally answer the call.

Emperor Taizong sent him a poem:

*Once you emerged from white clouds in a former age,*
*Then vanished, your traces lost to all.*
*If now you’ll heed the court’s decree,*
*I’ll grant you all Three Peaks as your own.*

As the Master neared the capital, he petitioned for a quiet chamber to rest. The emperor granted him lodging at the Jianlong Abbey. There he shut his door and slept soundly for over a month before rising. By imperial edict, he was received in the Yanying Hall dressed in a Huayang cap, straw sandals, and a trailing sash, accorded the rites due a guest. The emperor seated him and conversed with him at length.

At the time, the emperor was preparing to campaign against Hedong. The Master urged him to desist, but the army had already been mobilized. Displeased by his counsel, the emperor ordered him to sleep in the imperial park. When the troops returned in defeat, after more than a hundred days, the Master begged to return to the mountains.

In the fourth year of the Taiping Xingguo era, he came again, now declaring that Hedong could be taken. When the imperial army launched its second campaign, it indeed captured Liu Jiyuan and annexed Bingzhou. The emperor remarked to his chief minister Song Qi and others: *"Bo has been a recluse on Mount Hua for over forty years. Judging by his age, he must be well over a hundred, yet his discourse is lofty."*

The emperor sent an emissary to escort him, and the chief ministers Qi and others asked in leisurely tones: *"Master, having attained the Way of profound silence, can you teach it to others?"* The Master replied: *"I know nothing of the principles of breathing and nourishing life, nor of the arts of immortality and alchemy. I have no esoteric techniques to transmit. Even if one were to ascend to heaven in broad daylight, what benefit would it bring to the world’s teachings? Our sagely emperor is learned in past and present, deeply versed in the causes of order and chaos. He is truly a sovereign of the Dao, benevolent and enlightened—this is an age when ruler and ministers, sharing virtue, bring governance to fruition. Diligence in cultivation cannot surpass this."*

Qi and the others praised his words and reported them to the emperor, who esteemed him all the more. He issued a decree:

*"The recluse Chen Chuan of Mount Hua has dwelt in seclusion among hills and caves, his heart set beyond the world, savoring the rich flavor of the Dao. In the former Zhou dynasty, he was sought out in his hidden retreat and once answered the summons of the imperial tablet, yet his heart ever followed the wild geese into the distant sky. Since then, many years have passed."*

This time, he once again spoke of lofty and remote matters, yet came to grace the imperial court with his presence. Without a fitting title, how could his pure example be made manifest? Thus, he was granted the honorific *Master of Rare Serenity*.

The emperor repeatedly exchanged poems with him. The emperor asked: *"Can the governance of the realm today compare to that of Yao and Shun in ancient times?"*
The Master replied: *"Their earthen steps stood but three feet high, their thatched roofs untrimmed—such simplicity seems beyond reach. Yet if one governs with pure stillness, then even now may be an age of Yao and Shun."*
The emperor approved of his answer. He then sent his sons to meet the Master, who secretly revealed to them that the Mandate of Heaven truly rested with the Sagely Emperor.

The emperor wished to appoint him *Grand Master for Admonition*, but the Master firmly declined and begged to return to his mountain. He presented a poem:

*"From the wild marshes, our August Emperor’s decree—
A soaring rooster of the Chen clan, I chart my southern flight.
For ten years, a guest among the Three Peaks,
A single man of leisure beneath the Four Seas.
Worldly ways have ever been shallow,
Yet in poetry, my spirit finds its truth.
I beg to keep my nature, wild as deer,
For where is there I would not serve as subject?"*

Knowing he could not be detained, the emperor hosted a farewell banquet in the side hall and ordered the two chief ministers to attend, composing poems to honor his departure. He also bestowed upon him tortoise-and-crane emblems, saddled horses, and bolts of silk, and instructed Governor Wang Zuo of Huayang to visit him regularly to inquire after his needs.

Those who sought his counsel, treating him as a teacher with reverence, were too numerous to count. Later, the emperor again dispatched an imperial messenger to the mountain to summon the Master. The Master said: *"I am deeply grateful for Your Majesty’s grace, but I humbly request to remain on Mount Hua."*
His resolve was unshakable. The messenger returned and reported his words, whereupon the emperor sent another envoy bearing a handwritten edict, tea, and medicinal herbs, instructing the local prefect and magistrate to present him with gifts and repeatedly invite him with an honor guard of soft-littered carriages.

The Master then submitted a memorial in gratitude:

*"Your earnest and gracious decree fills a single sheet with meticulous script;
Your boundless imperial favor bestows medicines worth ten thousand in gold.
I lift my gaze in awe of Your Majesty’s benevolence,
And bow in deepening gratitude.
I am but a man of leisure in this flourishing age,
A scholar of the Tang court.
When the Way of Yao prospered, Xu You was indulged in his reclusion;
When the Han dynasty thrived, the Four Greybeards were cherished—
Virtuous recluses have never been absent in any era.
Yet I, with a body like withered wood and a heart like dead ashes,
Understand neither the depths of benevolence nor the subtleties of propriety.
I wear robes of tattered lotus leaves, a cap of cast-off clogs,
My limbs sprouting blue-green fur, my feet bare of straw sandals.
Were I to stand before Your Majesty’s throne,
I would only bring ridicule upon your sagely wisdom.
I pray Your Majesty turn your celestial ear elsewhere,
That I may remain hidden in these mountains.
In this age that honors the worthy, you surpass even the ancients.
Yet these crimson edicts, borne by phoenixes,
Disturb this idle heart, now detained by white clouds.
I drink from the old stream’s waters,
Feast on the wind beneath the pines,
Savor the purity of sun and moon,
And laugh carefree beyond the clouds.
Following my nature’s joy, what more need I say?
My spirit soars beyond the world,
My flesh and bones float amidst the mist.
Though I have delved into the root and sprout of the supreme Dao,
And fully steeped myself in the soil and waters of the sagely realm,
I dare not hope for Your Majesty’s continued favor,
But only beg you to heed this foolish wish."*

The Master’s knowledge of classics and history was vast, and he was especially profound in the study of the *Yi*. He could discern character and judge affairs, distinguishing the sagely from the common. When the future Emperor Taizu and Emperor Taizong of the Song were still in obscurity, they once accompanied Minister Zhao Zhongxian through the markets of Chang’an. The Master entered a wineshop with them. The minister took the seat of honor, but the Master said: *"You are but a minor star in the Purple Forbidden Enclosure—how dare you occupy the highest place?"*

When Emperor Shizong of Zhou and the future Emperor Taizu walked together, the Master remarked: *"Beyond the city walls, there are omens of three emperors."*

When Chong Fang first became his disciple, the Master said: *"If you encounter an enlightened ruler, your name will resound in the celestial court. Yet a name is a vessel of beauty across the ages, and the Creator is ever jealous of it—yours will one day be marred by some calamity."* His words proved true.

When Lord Zhang Yong of Zhongding was still a commoner, the Master met him and marveled at his extraordinary qualities.

Lord Zhang said: *"Would you grant me half of Mount Hua to dwell upon?"*
The Master replied: *"For you, it would be fitting. But as we parted, he presented him with a brush and paper."*
Lord Zhang understood his meaning and said: *"This is to entangle me in worldly affairs."*
The Master’s parting poem read:
*"My journey to Shu was but a common thing,
Yet like quenching flames with song and dance, I rushed in vain.
If granted the fair lands of the southeast,
I should still thank the gray at my temples."*

Later, Lord Zhang indeed passed the imperial examinations, his name resounding across the realm. As he prepared to depart for Jiannan, he sent a poem to the Master:
*"Foolish, I would not dwell in forests and springs,
But must purify the currents to serve my lord.
Today I hasten southward like a shooting star—
Turning back, I shame the clouds of Mount Hua."*

Upon his return, he wrote another:
*"Men hold office and glory in high esteem;
Seeing me return in haste, they lined the roads to greet me.
Yet the hermit of Mount Hua must laugh—
My innocence lost for an empty name."*

In his later years, Lord Zhang developed a carbuncle on his head. As he was appointed governor of Shengzhou, every poem the Master had gifted him proved prophetic.

Minister Chen Yaozhi of Kangsu, having passed the imperial examinations, paid a visit to the Master. Among those present was a Daoist with a topknot, his manner haughty. Fixing his gaze on Minister Chen, he repeated: *"Nan’an."*
Then he departed without another word.
Minister Chen was deeply perplexed and asked: *"Who was that?"*
The Master replied: *"Zhongli Zi."*
Minister Chen, still bewildered, wished to pursue him, but the Master smiled and said: *"He is already thousands of *li* away."*
Minister Chen asked: *"What did ‘Nan’an’ mean?"*
The Master replied: *"You will understand in time."*

Later, when Minister Chen was overseeing grain transport in Min, he passed through a village during his inspection. There, he heard a peasant woman call to her son: *"Go to Nan’an and hurry your father home."*
Minister Chen was astonished and asked where Nan’an was. Upon investigation, he found it was a ruined monastery. A stele read: *"On such-and-such a year and month, the master of Nan’an entered nirvana; his true body is enshrined here."* The date coincided with Minister Chen’s own birth.

Wang Shize of Qingyuan, along with Han Jiansu and Remonstrance Official Zhao, visited the Master together. Shize, acting as a servant, bowed at the foot of the steps.
The Master said: *"He who humiliates others humiliates himself."*
He then invited Shize to sit at the right hand of the other gentlemen, saying: *"In the future, you alone will surpass them all—just as in this gathering."*
The following year, Shize indeed ranked first, while the others trailed behind.

The Master could also foresee men’s thoughts. In his study hung a large gourd on the wall. The Daoist Jia Xiufu coveted it but said nothing.
The Master said to Xiufu: *"You came for no other reason than to seek my gourd."*
He called a servant to fetch it and gave it to him.

There was a man named Guo Hang who, in his youth, lived at the foot of Mount Hua. One night, he lodged at the abbey. At midnight, the Master called to him, urging him to return home at once. Guo hesitated, daunted by the distance, so the Master accompanied him. After one or two *li*, they encountered a man wailing to report Guo’s mother’s death. Only then did Guo grasp the Master’s warning. The Master gave him medicine, instructing him to hasten home—it might still save her. Upon arrival, he found her already dead, but after administering the medicine, she revived.

When Remonstrance Official Xu Zhongxuan was dismissed from office, the governor of Chengdu sent a letter and gifts to inquire about his fortune. The Master summoned his disciple Jia Desheng and said: *"Write my reply: ‘After this departure, the Gentleman will not emerge again.’"*
Soon after, Xu indeed passed away.

Later, the Master seldom received visitors, though he would occasionally wander to Huayin. When Magistrate Wang Mu of Huayin heard of his arrival, he rushed to the gate in disarray to welcome him. After they sat, the Master said: *"I have not drunk for a long time and now crave a little wine."*
Magistrate Wang replied: *"I have fine wine, as if I knew you were coming. I ordered the vessels washed and the feast prepared."*
After drinking, Magistrate Wang asked: *"Master, when you dwell among the cliffs and streams, where do you rest, and who guards your abode when you are away?"*
The Master smiled faintly and took up his brush to write a poem:
*"My palace is the heights of Mount Hua,
Where I stride the dawn winds, soaring through the void.
No golden locks secure my terraces—
When I return, the white clouds seal them anew."*

Magistrate Wang received the poem and, ashamed, expressed his gratitude.
The Master said: *"In another year, you will face great disaster. I came this time with the intent to save you. If you govern as you have, though misfortune may strike, the divine principle will protect you."*
Magistrate Wang had indeed been upright, honest, and cautious in office, treating the people as his children and sparing them the rod. His nature was also keen and perceptive.
The Master then produced a pill and said: *"This may shield you from next year’s calamity."*
Magistrate Wang rose, bowed twice, and accepted the medicine, swallowing it. They drank until midnight, when the Master excused himself to the privy. After a long while, he did not return, and when they searched, he had vanished.

Later, when Magistrate Wang was transferred back to the capital, his horse suddenly bolted, throwing him into the Bian River. Skilled swimmers rescued him, and he narrowly escaped death.

The Master would sometimes visit the homes of commoners at the foot of the mountain. Even now, there are those who claim to have seen him. Today, the Abbey of the Master still stands in Xihua.

Once, the Master often associated with Cui Gu of the mountain’s foothills. A scholar named Jin Li, who often roamed the mountains and rivers, visited Cui Gu and said: *"I wish to meet Master Xiyi through you."*
Cui Gu replied: *"Wait a while. The Master is sleeping now; you may see him when he awakens."*
Jin Li asked: *"When will that be?"*

Cui Gu said: *"Sometimes half a year, sometimes three or four months—lately, not even a full month passes. You have somewhere to go, so depart for now. Come again another day."*
Jin Li thus left. Over a year later, he roamed Hua Mountain once more and met Cui Gu, who happened to be with the Master, who had just arrived. Jin Li prostrated himself in reverence and then addressed the Master: *"When I last traveled to Hua Mountain, I wished to meet you, but you were asleep and had not yet awakened. Does sleep, too, follow the Dao? I beg you to instruct me and reveal what I have yet to comprehend."*

The Master let out a sound, shrugged his shoulders, drew in his feet, raised his face, and said with a sigh: *"I did not expect you to be so frail and petty. If you cannot even recognize the nature of rising, resting, sleeping, and dwelling, how can you hope to escape the cycle of birth and death, to leap free from the wheel of rebirth? Now, you eat your fill in ease, fretting only that your clothing and food are not abundant enough. When hungry, you eat; when weary, you sleep. Your snores resound far and wide, and you wake several times a night—fame, profit, sensual pleasures, and sounds muddle your spirit, while rich wines and fatty meats dull your heart and will. This is the sleep of the vulgar world.*

*But the sleep of the perfected one is different: he seals his golden breath and drinks the jade elixir. The Gate of Metal stands firm and cannot be opened; the Earthen Door is shut and cannot be unlatched. The Azure Dragon guards the Green Palace; the White Tiger crouches in the Western Chamber. True qi circulates within the Cinnabar Pool; divine water flows through the five viscera. He summons Jia and Ding to mark the hours and calls upon the hundred spirits to guard his chamber. Only then does his spirit emerge from the Nine Palaces, roaming freely through the azure and emerald realms, treading the void as if it were solid ground, ascending as if descending. Gently, he soars with auspicious winds; lightly, he drifts among idle clouds, appearing and vanishing. He sits in the Purple Court of Kunlun, traverses blessed lands and grotto-heavens, savors the essence of sun and moon, and delights in the sublime vistas of mist and rosy clouds. He visits immortals to discuss the principles beyond the mundane and makes distant journeys with transcendent beings. He watches the seas shrink to dust and points at yin and yang, letting out a long whistle. When he wishes to return, his feet tread upon the pure wind, and his body floats upon the fading light.*

*Thus, in his sleep, he is unaware of the passage of years and months, nor does he fear the shifting of mountains and valleys. Since you have asked, I shall compose a poem for you:*

*Ordinary men hold nothing dear,*
*Yet sleep they prize above all.*
*The world deems it mere repose,*
*But soul departs while form lies still.*
*Awake, they know not what transpired—*
*Greed stirs the heart anew.*
*How laughable, those in the dust,*
*Who know not life itself is dream.*

*Another poem says:*
*The perfected one dreams no dreams,*
*Yet his dreams are journeys divine.*
*The true man sleeps not at all,*
*Or sleeps amid floating clouds.*
*Within the crucible, elixir endures;*
*Within the gourd, another heaven.*
*To know the sleep within the dream—*
*This is the foremost mystery of men.*

*Great dreams bring great awakening; small dreams, small awakening. My sleep is true sleep; my dream, true dream—not the dreams of the world."*

The Master said: *"I shall not sleep for long. Do not go anywhere. Visit me another day, and I will let you witness true sleep."*
The Master then departed, leaving Jin Li stunned, as if awakening from drunkenness. He left without realizing it and returned home.

Another day, he visited the Master again. The Master discoursed on the secrets of nurturing life, expounding the subtlest gates and illuminating the mysteries of the Great Profundity. He said: *"On such-and-such a day, I shall sleep. Come then."*
Jin Li arrived as appointed, only to find the Master already asleep. He saw the Master lying on his back, breath flowing without pause, his complexion radiant and rosy. Jin Li bowed at the bedside and departed.

On yet another day, a visitor came to see the Master, who happened to be sleeping. Beside him stood an immortal, carefully listening to his breathing. With an ink brush, the immortal traced marks on paper—several times over, until the page was covered in indiscernible black strokes. The visitor, puzzled, asked about it. The immortal replied: *"That is the Master’s ‘Primal Chaos Score,’ composed in the tune of Huaxu."*

In his leisure, the Master enjoyed roaming. When moved by inspiration, he would chant verses, and upon encountering a scene, he would compose lines.

Once, he inscribed a poem on West Peak that read:
*"For love of West Peak’s beauty, my chanting head stays raised all day.
Rock flowers bloom in crimson ranks, while stream waters flow in jade array.
For nights on end, they bar the crescent moon; half the vale knows no sunset’s ray.
I bid the reclusive wanderer take heed—this place is the land of immortals indeed."*

Another couplet of his:
*"At midnight, celestial fragrance drifts into the ravine;
The west wind scatters lotuses from the ridge’s height.
Vainly do I cherish the palm’s imprint nearing the azure sky—
None remain to sigh for the mighty spirit’s might."*

At times, the Master would encounter the Hairy Maiden and present her with poems, such as:
*"The herb sprouts fail to fill the bamboo basket’s space,
Yet still you climb the perilous peak’s sheer face.
Pointing back toward the path of return,
Together we enter the emerald haze’s turn."*

And another:
*"Once you broke pine boughs to fashion a jeweled comb,
Then wove the indolent leaves into a gauze gown’s hem.
At times, when asked of Qin palace affairs,
You laugh, plucking immortal blooms to gaze at the vast expanse’s stem."*

The reclusive Lu Dongbin of Guanzhong possessed Daoist arts, traversing hundreds of miles in an instant—so the world deemed him a divine immortal. He often visited the Master’s study, exchanging verses as friends do.

Once, during a spring month, the Master strolled along the stony banks of Hua Mountain’s waters when he saw Master Gourd, Red Pine, and Lu Dongbin arrive in succession. The four immortals had barely begun their discourse when an earth spirit presented a tray of fruit and a vessel of wine. After drinking to half-intoxication, each composed a poem.

The Master said:
*"Spring’s warmth has half-opened the clustered blooms;
I wander idly upon the stone’s smooth looms.
Once I reined jade bridles at the golden gates,
Now I tread green sands and mossy mats.
How many years have passed in cave-bound sleep?
Alone, I drink a thousand cups of rosy sweep.
Meet others—speak not of mortal affairs,
But laugh and point to the drifting clouds’ layers."*

Master Gourd said:
*"Within my gourd, pavilions rise,
Where flowers bloom through all four skies.
At leisure, I sip nectar fine;
When drunk, I rest on mossy vine.
Carefree, I chase no fame or gain,
Unsullied by the world’s dark stain.
Meet others—speak not of mortal affairs,
But laugh and point to the drifting clouds’ layers."*

Red Pine said:
*"Just left my bamboo hut on Southern Peak,
Passing by my old retreat on Celestial Peak.
The cave’s fine wine has just matured,
While roadside flowers bloom half-cured.
My bones are not of mortal make,
Nor is your talent of earthly stake.
Meet others—speak not of mortal affairs,
But laugh and point to the drifting clouds’ layers."*

Lu Dongbin said:
*"Fallen so low, I’ve come to this place,
Through how many blossoms’ bloom and grace?
When bored, I pawn my coins for wine,
Then drink a thousand cups—or ten thousand fine.
I’ve wandered eighty-one days free,
Drunk, I’ve climbed Mao’s altar high.
Meet others—speak not of mortal affairs,
But laugh and point to the drifting clouds’ layers."*

One day, the Master said to Jia Desheng: *"A distinguished guest will arrive today—go quickly and announce me."* Soon after, a man in a short hemp robe and blue headscarf knocked at the gate. Before Jia could report, the visitor vanished in an instant. The Master hastily ordered pursuit, and after chasing for over a *li*, they encountered an old man clad in deerskin. The Master asked: *"Has the one who passed earlier gone far?"* The old man replied: *"That was the immortal Li Babai, who moves eight hundred *li* in a single stride."* As his words ended, the old man also disappeared.

The Master then realized the deerskin-clad elder was Li Ruan, the White Deer Master of Great Clarity who had attained the Dao.

The Master said: *"I cannot remain named in this world any longer."*

In the first year of the *Duangong* era, he spoke to his disciples one day:

"Next year after the Zhongyuan Festival, I shall journey to Mount Emei. The following year, I shall send my disciples to carve a stone chamber in Zhangchao Valley. Once completed, I went to inspect it and said: 'Though the stone rivals Mount Taihua, this valley remains a finer place. Shall I return here in the end?' I then drafted my final memorial, which read in part: *'This servant’s allotted time has come; though loath to leave the sagely court, I shall shed my form on the twenty-second day of the tenth month this year beneath Lotus Peak in Zhangchao Valley.'*

I also composed a memorial petition, the words of which none saw, and sent Jia Desheng with a tortoise-and-crane saddle and horse to present it at court. The Emperor alone perused it at length, then returned the tortoise-and-crane saddle and horse to Desheng, bestowing upon him a purple robe and the honorific title *Wu Zhen* ('Awakened to Reality'). He further granted five million coins to construct the North Star Hall, that my vow might be fulfilled.

When I first resolved to depart, I had lamps and candles lit all night within the stone chamber. At the appointed time, I passed away resting my cheek upon my left hand. After seven days, my complexion remained unchanged, and my limbs still warm. A five-colored cloud veiled the valley’s mouth, lingering for a full month without dissipating. I lived to the age of one hundred and eighteen.

I entrusted Desheng to succeed me in overseeing the abbey. My elucidation of the *Book of Changes* was transmitted in several characters to Mu Bochang, who passed it to Li Tingzhi, who in turn taught Kangjie (Shao Yaofu). Shao taught the study of images to Zhong Fang, who transmitted it to Xu Jian of Lujiang, who then taught Fan—thus this lineage spread throughout the south.

Later, an imperial emissary arrived at Mount Emei, where a visitor in imposing robes and cap sought an audience, calling himself Dongming Zhuanxiang. He spoke at length of matters concerning Mount Hua. After several days, the emissary realized: *'This is Master Chen of Mount Hua!'* He hastily ordered the man summoned, but he had already vanished without a trace.

During the Xiangfu era, Emperor Zhenzong, returning from the Feng and Sui sacrifices, visited Yuntai Palace a second time. Gazing upon my portrait, he decreed the abbey’s fields exempt from taxes. He summoned the Daoist Jia Desheng and bestowed purple robes upon Wu Zihua and others, commanding them to build halls for the Sacred Ancestor, Emperor Zhenzong’s natal star, and the Three Celestial Palaces. My likeness was also painted upon the northern wall.

Earlier, during the Yongxi era, I had told Jia Desheng: *'When I depart, behind the Hall of the Elder Lord you will see a divine being clad in black robes and cap. He is the North Star, the Purple Tenuity Emperor of Open Unity. You must use the gifts previously bestowed to erect a North Star Hall.'* I further said: *'In former times, Princess Jinxian of the Tang used this place as a sanctuary for prayer. Now that I have again encountered the North Star, this abbey shall flourish—only you shall inherit it.'* When Emperor Zhenzong later visited, it was indeed thirty years hence, and Desheng fulfilled this destiny.

Such foreknowledge of things to come was but one of many such instances."

Chen Daoyi remarked: Master Chen Tuan embodied the Dao and its virtue, using sleep to navigate the world. When woodcutters touched his chest, they found him in deep slumber, saying, *"Why disturb me?"* Summoned to the palace by Empress Dowager Song, he slept soundly against the door for over a month. His sobriquet "Hermit of Profound Obscurity" aptly captured his essence. Yet his reliance on sleep must have held deeper meaning. As the *Dao De Jing* states: *"The multitude are bright and clear; I alone am dim and dull. The multitude are sharp and keen; I alone am muddled and confused."* Was this not the very principle behind Chen Tuan’s sleep?

Su Chengyin, a Daoist of Longxing Abbey in Zhenyang, was well-versed in the teachings of Laozi and Zhuangzi and skilled in nurturing life. In the intercalary fifth month of the second year of the Kaibao era, Emperor Taizu sojourned in Zhenyang and summoned him to ascend the palace hall. The emperor said: *"Master, though over eighty, you appear youthful. You must know the art of nurturing life—teach it to me."* Chengyin replied: *"My method of nurturing life is nothing more than focused contemplation and refining qi. But the way of nurturing life for emperors differs from this. As Laozi said: ‘If I practice non-action, the people will transform themselves; if I am without desire, the people will be upright of their own accord.’ Non-action and desirelessness, concentrating the spirit in the Great Harmony—this is the Dao by which the Yellow Emperor and Emperor Yao ruled long and prosperously."* The emperor praised his words and bestowed upon him generous gifts.

*From the Comprehensive Mirror of the August Dynasty.*

In the winter of the tenth month, on the day *guimao*, of the fifth year of the *Kaibao* era, Emperor Taizu issued an edict commanding the Commissioner of Merit and Virtue, together with Liu Ruozhuo, the Daoist Registrar of the Left Street, to assemble the Daoists of the capital and examine their learning. Those who failed to arrive or were unprepared were all dismissed.

Ruozhuo, a native of Shu, styled himself Master Huagai. Skilled in the practice of *qi*-absorption, he remained vigorous past ninety, his steps light and swift. Whenever drought or flood struck, he was invariably summoned to the palace, where he would erect an altar and perform rites of supplication—his methods precise and meticulous.

Zhang Bai, styled Xubai, called himself Master Baiyun, a man of Qinghe. Quiet and composed, he was broadly learned and capable in literary composition. Having twice failed the imperial examinations, he encountered the death of a parent and wept, saying to himself: *"Office is for nurturing one’s kin—now that my kin are gone, why seek office?"* Thereupon he abandoned grain and ceased eating, devoting himself to cultivating *qi* and preserving spirit. He studied all the texts of the Daoist tradition without exception.

During the *Kaibao* era of Emperor Taizu, he traveled south to Jingzhou. At the time, his fellow townsman Han Keci served as Prefectural Governor, and warmly welcomed him. As the court was then engaged in punitive expeditions against Jiang and Wu, with military and state affairs in turmoil, Zhang doffed his scholar’s robes and became a Daoist. He proceeded to Wuling and took lodging at the Longxing Abbey. The prefectural governor, Vice-Director Liu Chi, and the military supervisor Zhang Yanfu treated him with profound respect. Once, he presented Yanfu with a mirror of his own crafting, saying: *"Keep this—it can ward off evil."*

Zhang concealed his true attainment, spending his days in drunken dissipation, unrestrained and unconcerned. When drunk in the marketplace, he would point at strangers and strangers alike, hurling insults—yet his words invariably struck at the hidden faults of others, so that those of discernment often marveled at him. Whenever he encountered wind or snow, if he felt cold, he would break the ice and plunge into deep water, sitting calmly for the entire day before emerging. His clothes would be soaked, his body steaming like a boiling cauldron, yet in the time it took to glance about, all was dry.

At times, he would playfully challenge others: standing upright, he would have several ruffians push and pull him with all their might, yet he would not budge in the slightest. Or he would stretch out one leg, ordering three or four men to lift it—though they strained with all their strength, the leg remained unmoved.

He often frequented the Cui family’s tavern, drinking without limit. One day, the tavern keeper complained to Master Cui: *"Whenever this venerable master comes, the patrons drink twice as much as usual, yet our profits are less."* Upon hearing this, Master Cui refused to accept a single coin from him.

One day, Zhang wrote on the tavern wall:
*"By the Cui family’s tavern by Wuling Stream—*
*On earth there is none, but in heaven it’s found.*
*A southern Daoist drinks several *dou*—*
*Beyond drunkenness, white clouds at the cavern’s mouth."*

From then on, the number of patrons doubled.

The Southern Marchmount Daoists Tang Yunsheng and Wei Yingshi, also men of the Dao in that era, admired him and often kept his company. Zhang was quick-witted and rich in talent, his thoughts flowing like a spring. Within a few days, he composed three hundred poems on the theme of *"Spring Scenery in Wuling,"* each beginning with the line *"Within the spring scenery of Wuling..."* One read:
*"Within the spring scenery of Wuling,*
*Twelve taverns rise in tiers.*
*Only when thoroughly drunk do I turn my head—*
*Meeting others, I lazily nod.*
*Right and wrong, I care not at all;*
*Fame and profit, suddenly cast aside.*
*Wearing a star-crowned hat,*
*I drift and sink with the world’s flow."*

Zhang’s extemporaneous verses were always coherent and reasonable, unlike the words of an ordinary drunken madman.

Later, he suddenly fell ill and urgently told the abbey’s superintendent: *"I will not recover. Do not cremate me—I fear my kin and acquaintances in the village will come searching. Bury me outside the western gate according to common custom."* With these words, he departed this life. For several nights afterward, his limbs remained supple as in life, and a rare fragrance filled the room.

The city’s gentry and common folk gathered for days to witness the spectacle. The Cui family purchased a coffin, and the military overseer Zhang Yanfu donated his own salary to inter him as he had requested. Barely a month later, a hole appeared in the burial mound. Soon after, Yanfu was again dispatched on a mission to Jianghuai, where an old servant encountered Bai on the Kai Ming Bridge in Weiyang. Bai asked whether Fang Jian was still present, then added, "This mirror, too, will not remain long." The servant returned and recounted the meeting, prompting Yanfu to doubt: "He has been dead for some time—what did you truly see?" He then searched for the mirror and, upon close inspection, found it crumbled at his touch.

Another official, Yu An of Dingzhou, was sent to Yangzhou on public business and also met Bai, who carried a large gourd selling medicine. Bai urgently summoned Yu to drink at a tavern, reminiscing about their past travels in Wuling. When Yu prepared to depart days later, Bai said, "Deliver a letter for me to thank the Cui family." Upon Yu’s return, he delivered the letter, and the Cui family, astonished, immediately opened the coffin—only to find it empty.

Bai annotated *The Scripture of the Daoist Ascension, Disaster Dispelling, and Lifespan Protection*, interspersing it with hymns. The first hymn read:
*"The Supreme’s original truth,*
*Within emptiness, the spirit resides.*
*If the heart can comprehend,*
*Above the head, none abide."*

The final hymn read:
*"The heart doubts, following myriad realms,*
*In realms, it clings to the heart’s threads.*
*The Dao is not ‘being’ nor ‘non-being,’*
*Only then is the edge of seeds transcended."*

He also composed *The Pointers to the Mystery* and a collection of heptasyllabic verse, titled *The Alchemical Terrace Collection*, all of which circulated in the world.

**The Daoist of Primal Chaos**
During the days when the Song emperors Taizu and Taizong still concealed their brilliance, they once befriended a Daoist who had no fixed name, calling himself Primal Chaos or sometimes True Nothingness. After Taizu ascended the throne, the Daoist was no longer seen. On the Shangsi Festival, while the emperor was performing the purification rites by the western pond, the Daoist bowed to Taizu and said, "I rejoice in your well-being since we last parted." The emperor hastily received him, and their meeting was as it had always been—they clasped hands and drank heartily. The emperor asked, "How much longer is my lifespan?" The Daoist replied, "If the night of the twentieth day of the tenth month this year is clear, you may extend it by a twelve-year cycle. If not, make swift preparations." The emperor kept him in the rear gardens, where he was sometimes seen lodging in a magpie’s nest in the trees, vanishing for days at a time.

On the appointed day, the emperor ascended the Great Clarity Pavilion to observe the celestial omens. That evening, the sky was indeed clear, stars gleaming brilliantly. The emperor’s heart rejoiced, but suddenly dark clouds gathered, the heavens and earth transformed, and hail and snow fell violently. He descended the pavilion with his staff, urgently ordered the palace gates unlocked, and summoned the Prince of Kaifeng—Taizong. He led him into the grand chamber, where they drank wine together. All palace attendants were dismissed, and from afar, the flickering candlelight revealed Taizong repeatedly rising from his seat in an unbearable manner. When the drinking concluded, the palace clepsydra struck the third watch, and snow had already accumulated several inches deep. The emperor, holding his pillar-axe, struck the snow and turned to Taizong, saying, "Well done, well done." He then loosened his belt and retired to bed, his snores resounding like thunder. As the fifth watch approached, all was silent—he had already passed. Taizong received the posthumous edict and ascended the throne.

**Ding Shaowei**
In the third year of Taiping Xingguo during the reign of Emperor Taizong of the Song, on the *yimao* day of the fourth month, the Daoist Ding Shaowei of True Source from Mount Hua was summoned to the capital. Shaowei was skilled in *qi*-absorption and longevity techniques, ranking alongside Chen Tuan. However, Shaowei’s aspirations were pure and refined, while Tuan indulged in wine and unrestrained freedom. Though their residences were close, they never visited one another. Shaowei presented the emperor with golden elixir, giant *astragalus*, southern *lingzhi*, and black *lingzhi*, staying for several months before being sent back.

**Chen Huazi**

**Chen Huazi**

Chen Huazi attained the Dao on Mount Qingcheng. He would often cut paper flowers to sell in the market, using the proceeds only to buy wine. He befriended Chen Tuan, and the two frequently visited Mount Qingcheng, where people often saw them.

*Volume 48*

**Zhang Qizhen**

Zhang Qizhen, styled Qiyi, was a native of Qiantang. Orphaned in youth, he followed Master Hu of the Upper Clarity Abbey, wandering through Jiang and Zhe, ascending Mount Kuaiji, exploring the Grotto of Yu, and traversing Jinyun. He journeyed to Red City to seek the Dao, carrying a basket as he accompanied him. At the time, Celestial Master Zhu resided on Mount Tiantai. Observing Qizhen’s pure bones and square pupils, he esteemed him and ordained him as a Daoist. After a long while, Qizhen returned to Qiantang and dwelled at the True Sage Abbey on Mount Wu.

In the fifth year of Xiande during the reign of Emperor Shizong of the Zhou, he received the *Zhengyi Mengwei Lingbao* register from Master Fan of Great Primordiality. Thereafter, he perused all the scriptures of the Purple Rosette and Jade Hairpin without exception, and his name resounded throughout Jiang and Zhe. King Zhongyi, devoted to the Dao and its methods, would hold the Three Registers Fast and entrusted Qizhen with overseeing the rites. Nobles and high officials also revered and admired him.

During the Taiping Xingguo era of the Song, Emperor Taizong ordered the authorities to establish the Taiyi Abbey in the empire’s southeast. He summoned the realm’s pure and disciplined scholars to reside there, and Qizhen was selected. Shortly after, a grand purification rite was held in the palace, and he was summoned for an audience. His responses pleased the emperor, who bestowed upon him a purple robe. The emperor, noting that Daoist scriptures contained errors, ordered the Daoist registrars of the Two Streets to select accomplished scholars for their correction, and Qizhen was again chosen. Upon completion, he was granted the title *Master of Primordial Stillness*.

On the eleventh day of the first month in the third year of Jingde during the reign of Emperor Zhenzong, as he prepared for sleep, a red-robed official bearing a tally arrived at his bedside and said, “By command, Zhang, you must swiftly purify yourself and proceed to your duties there.” At dawn, he summoned his disciple Xu Sijian and said, “I am about to depart. Remember this.” Twenty-five days later, he bathed and, in perfect tranquility, returned to the True. He was seventy-one years old. The following day, his spirit was conveyed to the city’s east. His limbs were soft and supple, and sweat glistened upon his face. When cremated, he yielded over a *sheng* of pearls, dark and lustrous.

Prime Minister Qian Weiyan said to his disciples, “This is what the Buddhists call *śarīra*. In the immortal scriptures, it is said to be the congealed essence of *jing* and *qi*. The *Scripture of Pacing the Void* states: *Śarīra radiates golden splendor, as the dragon carriage arrives in reverence.*”

The master was by nature reticent, his heart untouched by fame or profit. He was only fond of literature, tireless even in old age. He hand-copied over five hundred volumes of classics, histories, masters, and collections. Skilled in cursive and clerical scripts, as well as chess, he concealed his brilliance and restrained himself. Once, as he sat alone in his pavilion, birds alighted upon his lap—so profound was his harmony with things, his mind free of scheming.

**Zhang Yuanhua**

The Daoist Zhang Yuanhua, origin unknown, styled himself *Master of the Canopy of Hua*. While traveling in Ruzhou, the people of Ru invited him to preside over the North Pole Abbey. Outwardly, he cultivated compassion and kindness, and the people of Ru were all pleased with him. Yet none knew what esoteric practices he pursued; he blended with the world and harmonized his light, never setting himself apart.

When someone offered oil lamps for the North Pole Hall, Yuanhua filled a large basin with water, floated eight lamps upon it, and arranged them in the pattern of the stars. The Dipper’s handle turned with the dawn and dusk. When the people of the prefecture requested purification rites, young and old alike prepared with the same intent, yet before they could invite him, the master would arrive at dawn. If someone intended to make a request but their husband and wife suddenly quarreled, or if their children were disobedient, even if they came to invite him, he would perceive their discord, refuse to go, and merely admonish them before sending them away.

Beside the abbey lay an orchard and vegetable garden. Villagers would wait for him to leave before stealing from it, yet upon reaching the garden, they would find the master already there. Such instances of his foresight were many.

Marshal Zhou of the prefecture was on the best terms with the master, yet he never learned what arts he had been taught. Once, on New Year’s Day, the master carried a reed torch, circling the streets and alleys. Though it took several moments to complete the circuit, the torch’s embers remained as if freshly lit. When people marveled and inquired, he replied, “There are plague demons here. I am driving them away.” The people thought him mad and did not believe him. But in summer, a violent epidemic broke out beyond the city, while within, rich and poor alike remained unharmed. He saved people with talismans and medicines, using whatever he received for the abbey’s rites.

One day, a guest invited him to a tavern. Yuanhua declined, saying he did not drink. Later, when the guest offered meat, he again refused, citing his ordination register. The guest grew angry, but Yuanhua gazed intently at him and knew he was no human. He said, “Return briefly to the abbey. I beg you to wait a moment, and I will meet you again.” Taking his sword, he lured the guest beyond the city, ordered him to sit, and slew him—it was a demon. Its hair was vermilion, its face indigo, and its back as thin as that of a five- or seven-year-old child. He held up its head for the people to see, saying, “This demon repeatedly caused harm. I slew it to rid the people of a scourge.” He then piled firewood in the thoroughfare and burned it, the stench lingering for days.

One night, the people of the prefecture all dreamed that Yuanhua came to bid them farewell, saying, “I am traveling afar for a time. Take care.” That very night, he vanished in his sleep. At dawn, those who came to visit found that all, young and old, had witnessed the same. In the early years of Taiping Xingguo during the reign of Emperor Taizong of the Song, the scholar An Hongjian lodged in the prefecture. Arrogant and self-important, he claimed no one could match his talents. Yet upon meeting Yuanhua, he bowed in reverence and joined the ranks of his disciples.

After the burial, when the coffin was lifted, it was exceedingly heavy, as if iron or stone rolled within. Hongjian ordered wine and offered prayers, and gradually it grew lighter. When they opened the coffin at the gravesite, they found a hole in the crown of the head, large enough to admit an arm.

Those with discernment remarked, "This is the molting of a cicada." Shortly after, a traveler arrived from Heyin, selling pomegranates at Rufen. On the road, he encountered a Daoist who said, "I am the abbot Zhang of Rufen. I entrust you with a letter." He also purchased several dozen pomegranates, offering them at the North Pole Hall. The traveler agreed. Upon arrival, the disciples said, "This letter is indeed our master’s true hand." They led the traveler to the portrait hall, where he exclaimed, "The one I saw earlier differs not at all from this image." To this day, the people of Ru depict his likeness and honor him. He once composed *The Secret of Returning Elixir* and two short lyrics, which, along with his deeds in cultivating the Dao, have been passed down through the ages.

Zhang Qiwu and Li Zhen were natives of Yan. Gentle and restrained, Qiwu never offended others. He traveled through Ke and Xiang. During the Chunhua reign of Emperor Taizong of the Song, he arrived in Jiangling. Stricken by illness, he lodged outside the Gong’an Gate. Though impoverished, he never turned away guests. One day, a Daoist visited, introducing himself as Zhang Qiwu of Longxi, seeking shelter from Zhen. Zhen agreed, though ashamed of his poverty and inability to provide. The Daoist said, "This poor Daoist eats nothing. A few measures of wine each day would be a generous gift." Zhen consented. The Daoist drank in the marketplace, unbothered even by butchers and wine-sellers. He returned only after nightfall, drunkenly cursing Zhen, who paid no mind and treated him even more kindly. Another day, the Daoist returned utterly drunk, stumbling into Zhen’s bedchamber. He awoke only at dusk, vomiting filth that soiled everything. The servants grew angry and sought to restrain him, but Zhen stopped them, saying, "Why reproach a drunken man?" At dawn, the Daoist prepared to leave and said to Zhen, "I am deeply grateful for your kindness. Might you now see me off for a few *li*?" Zhen accompanied him for nearly ten *li*. The Daoist said, "I am no ordinary man, though I bear a slight debt. I have wandered the world for fifty years and never met one as benevolent and generous as you. I wish to offer you a minor art." Zhen asked what it was, and he replied, "The art of transmuting base metals into gold." Zhen said, "My fate is meager; I dare not accept. I pray you understand." The Daoist smiled vaguely and said, "Your Way is beyond my reach." Then he drew a hairpin, wielding it as a sword, and declared, "Let us part here." He slashed the earth, which split at his touch. He stepped into the fissure, and the ground closed behind him. Zhen marveled, and from that day forth, the Daoist vanished, never to be seen again.

Zhang Wumeng, styled Lingyin and known as Master Hongmeng, was a native of Aoya in Fengxiang. Tall of stature and refined in bearing, he favored tranquility and lived simply into old age. His father was a scholar who withdrew from official life. He had two sons, Wumeng being the elder, renowned for his filial piety in his hometown. Upon coming of age, he entrusted his inheritance to his younger brother and entered Mount Hua, forming bonds with Zhong Fang and Liu Haichan as fellow seekers beyond the mundane. He studied under Master Chen Xiyi, from whom Wumeng gleaned subtle teachings. After some time, he traveled to Tiantai, ascended Chicheng, and dwelled at Qiongtai Abbey. There, he practiced the methods of the Red Pine Immortal’s guiding and stretching, and Anqi’s returning elixir. Over a decade or so, his inner cultivation found expression in song and verse, culminating in a hundred poems titled *The Return to the Origin*. Xia Yingong, while serving as prefect of Taizhou, entered the mountains and met him. He obtained this collection and brought it back to the capital. At the time, Minister Wang Jifu was seeking recluses, and Yingong presented *The Return to the Origin* to him. Before long, it was brought to the emperor’s attention. Emperor Zhenzong of the Song summoned Wumeng for an audience and inquired about the path to longevity.

Wumeng replied, "Your servant is but a rustic. In the mountains, I merely recite the *Laozi* and the *Book of Changes*—I know nothing beyond these." The emperor commanded him to expound the *Changes*, and he discoursed on the hexagram *Modesty*. The emperor asked, "Why do you speak only of *Modesty*?" Wumeng answered, "When the realm is in a time of great abundance, it is fitting to preserve it with modesty." The emperor was pleased with his explanation and appointed him Left Gentleman for Writing. Wumeng firmly declined, saying, "Your Majesty’s virtue rivals that of Yao and Shun—surely the mountains and forests can accommodate one Chaofu or Xu You?" Thereupon, he took up residence at Xusheng Abbey in Jianlong.

Later, the emperor summoned him to lecture on *The Return to the Origin*. Wumeng said, "The state is like the body. When the mind is without contrivance, the qi harmonizes; when the qi harmonizes, the myriad treasures coalesce. When the mind is contrived, the qi becomes disordered; when the qi is disordered, the essence and splendor scatter. This is the great purport of *The Return to the Origin*." He briefly expounded on a dozen or so poems before withdrawing. Envoys were sent to bestow gold and silk, but he declined them all, begging to return to the mountains. The emperor then conferred upon him the title *Master of Unfettered Drinking*, but he refused this as well. The emperor composed a song to send him on his way, its lyrics reading:

*"The Primal Origin’s teaching holds pure essence,
Seen not, heard not, yet ever present.
Only the enlightened attain this truth,
Roaming beyond the world in profound obscurity.
Floating clouds shift without fixed form,
Flowing waters take no constant shape.
On a whim, he left the valleys,
To discourse on the real before the royal court.
With the wind, he grasped the宗旨,
Returning to rock-pillowed ease, his nature fulfilled.
Jade and silk, caps and tassels—he holds none dear,
A long song alone honors his homeward path."*

Minister Wang Jifu invited him to his private residence, intending to detain him with hospitality. Wumeng said, "Even the Son of Heaven I have declined—you, sir, are but a minister; why trouble yourself to keep me?" The next day, he departed. An edict was issued commanding Taizhou to provide him with the stipend of a Left Gentleman for Writing to support his old age, but upon reaching the mountains, he did not claim it. From beginning to end, he maintained such integrity.

He possessed the arts of alchemy but kept them secret. After residing at Qiongtai for another decade, he withdrew to Crane Pond on Mount Zhongnan. Some time later, he wandered to Mount Song, drifted along the Xiang and Han rivers, and arrived at Baoning and Shouning Monasteries in Jinling, where he shut his door and did not emerge. When scholars sought him out for instruction, he feigned deafness, and thereafter, worldly affairs scarcely concerned him. Yet he was broadly learned in antiquity and the present, mastering the hundred schools of thought, as well as maps, classics, and minor histories, recalling them with perfect clarity. Two students attended his desk for many years before he eventually ordained them as Daoist priests.

Wumeng lived to ninety-nine and passed away in Jinling. Three days after his death, a white qi surged from the crown of his head, rising over three feet high before gradually dissipating. When placed in the coffin, his limbs remained supple, his fingernails did not darken, and his chest retained warmth. Magistrate Shi Junyu Qi sent an official to inter him before the stupa of Chan Master Wukong. A collection of his *Qiongtai Poems* circulated in the world.

Master Bixu Chen Jingyuan once ranked among his disciples and attained the profound purport of the Lao-Zhuang teachings.

**Master Cheng the Immortal**
Master Cheng the Immortal’s origins are unknown. In Zizhou, he ascended to heaven in broad daylight. Xing Qi, the prefect, reported the event in full to Emperor Zhenzong. His descendants remain alive to this day.

Tu Dingci

Tu Dingci was a native of Longmou Village in Liangshan, Pengzhou. His Tu clan ancestors had resided there for generations since Meng Zhixiang’s occupation of Shu. He tilled the land himself and amassed a fortune of a hundred gold pieces. During the Xianping era of Emperor Zhenzong of the Song, Dingci served in corvée labor for the prefecture. Once, while transporting silk and cloth through the pass, he lodged for the night at an inn in Huayin. There, he encountered a scholar who introduced himself as Shu Zhuan. They exchanged bows and sat together, their conversation flowing so harmoniously that they drank together for an entire day. As Dingci prepared to depart, the scholar said, “I am Chen Tuan. I chanced upon you here because you possess extraordinary bones.” Overcome with joy and awe, Dingci could scarcely contain himself. He earnestly sought esoteric arts, but the scholar replied, “The Way does not prize the extraordinary. Simply conserve your spirit and avoid internal harm from likes and dislikes—that is sufficient.” Then, drawing a *daogui* of medicine from his sleeve, he said, “Take this, and you shall live a hundred years.” The next day, Dingci sought him again, but the scholar had vanished.

Upon returning west, Dingci abandoned worldly pursuits and carved a stone chamber into the southern mountain where he lived. The cliff was perilously steep, towering dozens of *ren* high, and onlookers’ hair stood on end at the sight. Yet Dingci scaled the wooden ladders and traversed the rocky paths as effortlessly as level ground. Initially, the stone chamber was dry, and he suffered from a lack of water. Whenever he chanted an incantation, a sweet spring would flow forth as promised. He often kept a flock of crows, and with a single call into the wind, thousands would gather, circling and alighting tamely around him.

In summer, he would carry his spinning wheel to bask on the rocks, calling it “welcoming the cold.” In winter’s bitter freeze, he wore only a single layer of silk. Once, while traveling in Chengdu, he visited the monk Xi Bai. When the meal was served, he consumed an entire vessel of salt—several *jin* in weight—astonishing all present. The alchemist Wang He shared drinks with him, and Dingci alone downed several *dou* without losing composure. He also pulverized several *sheng* of ginger and scallions, mixing them into his food. Whenever guests arrived and casually mentioned a craving for some delicacy, he would invariably procure it in abundance for them to share. Though his guests were sated, he would not cease.

Once, when his family estate became the subject of a lawsuit, the case was transferred to Yanqu for trial. Nearly a year passed in prison, yet he never once prepared provisions, nor did his accusers dare confront him. The warden, too, refused to yield, unable to extract the truth, and so released Dingci from confinement.

Dingci immediately went to the riverbank north of the city, to the Luohan Monastery. Atop a sheer cliff stood an ancient tree, and he climbed it, refusing to descend for seven days. When people called to him, he replied: "I will not come down. You may shoot me with arrows if you wish—if not, stones will do." Yet no one dared press him. On the eighth day, without being summoned, he descended of his own accord and returned to the place of trial, where an imperial pardon arrived.

Later, he requested to become a Daoist. Each mid-spring, when people took purgative medicines, he would go to the river, stand naked on a small shoal, and let the water enter his body through the seven orifices, calling it "flushing the intestines."

Once, two young merchants were at Tuobai Stream when one suddenly collapsed from heatstroke and died. Dingci took an iron needle and struck it into the man’s forehead with a single hammer blow, driving it in over an inch. In an instant, the man revived. The next year, the merchant brought goods as thanks, but Dingci refused to accept them. He stored away five hundred thousand coins, his shoulder load secured tightly.

The family was forbidden from taking or using his money without permission, though his descendants never understood his reasoning. A month before his death, he returned home from his chamber. He told his family: "Throughout my life, whenever I purchased goods worth a hundred coins, I always gave more than the asking price. If the seller questioned the excess, I would reward their integrity with the extra money. Yet in all my years, not a single person did so—such is the greed of the world today."

One day, he summoned his family before him and said: "I am ninety-three years old. What am I waiting for if not death?" He asked for croton seeds and ate them—two hundred at first. When nothing happened, he ate another hundred after a short while. A slight purging followed, and then he sat upright and passed away. The family gathered around, weeping, but he revived and said: "Stop. I fear you will struggle with the funeral arrangements." After explaining everything, he departed once more. For several nights, his youthful complexion remained unchanged, as if still alive. When the time came for burial, his coffin was remarkably light. Those who knew the signs believed it to be a *shijie*—a liberation from the corpse.

In the stone chamber where he had lived, the sounds of flutes and drums were sometimes heard. His son became a Left Attendant-in-Ordinary, and several of his grandsons passed the imperial examinations.

**Guo Shangaong**

Guo Shangaong, whose origins are unknown, once worked as a hired laborer in the Song dynasty during the *Tianxi* era of Emperor Zhenzong, washing dishes in a teahouse by the Bianzhou Bridge. One day, a man in a blue headscarf and plain robe sat drinking tea. His bearing was imposing, his presence awe-inspiring, and he kept glancing at Guo. Suspecting the man was extraordinary, Guo discreetly observed the sword hidden in his sleeve. Guo thought to himself: *This must be Master Lü.* When the man left, Guo rushed forward and knelt before him, saying: "I have encountered you at last, Master. I wish to serve you as your attendant."

Master Lü ignored him and walked away. Guo followed at a distance until they reached a wooden plank. Lü turned and asked: "Do you truly wish to serve me?" Guo nodded eagerly. Lü said: "Then receive my sword." Guo stretched out his neck in readiness. As Lü raised the blade to strike, Guo cried out—and Lü vanished. Guo found himself patrolling the *Baiwan* Granary, where he was arrested by guards, beaten with a staff, and driven away.

From then on, he wandered every secluded corner within and beyond the capital. Whenever he saw someone, he would stare intently for a long while before leaving.

When questioned, he would reply: "I am searching for Master Lü." For over a decade thereafter, his whereabouts remained unknown.

In the final years of Emperor Renzong’s Tiansheng era, an official named Zhao resided in a private estate in Yicheng Town, Cizhou. One day, a beggar in tattered robes arrived. Bowing twice before Zhao, he said: "I am Guo Shang’ao." Zhao recognized him and asked: "Have you seen Master Lü?" Guo replied: "I have traveled the realm without finding him. Now my allotted time nears its end, so I have come to beg a small coffin to shelter my remains." Zhao thought him delusional and asked: "When will it end?" Guo said: "Tomorrow at noon." Zhao replied: "If so, I shall buy you a coffin." Guo added: "And I beg you to bore a hole in the coffin’s head, through which a bamboo pole may be inserted to allow the passage of qi." Though Zhao assented, he remained unconvinced.

The next day at noon, Guo bathed himself with drawn water, lay beneath a locust tree, and expired. Astonished, Zhao had a coffin made. As bamboo was scarce in Heshuo, he took an old umbrella handle, hollowed it out, and inserted it into the coffin’s head before placing it on the riverbank. Fearing disturbance by foxes or dogs, he reinforced it with brambles and piled stones.

That autumn, heavy rains swelled the river, which receded only after several days. Fearing the coffin might have been swept away, Zhao hastened to inspect it with his staff—only to find the coffin open and the body gone.

Master Bao Yi, whose given name was Bao Yi, hailed from Liangdang in Fengzhou. His father had relocated to Puchi in Liangquan, where the family lived by farming and sericulture. At twelve, while herding cattle, the Master encountered an old man who asked: "Are you hungry?" The Master did not answer but merely nodded. The old man reached into his bag, took out food resembling a radish but sweet in taste, and gave it to him. He also gave him a staff and a gourd ladle containing medicine—peas, in fact—which he instructed the Master to administer to others. Those suffering from new or chronic illnesses who took it recovered without exception.

After eating the radish himself, the Master no longer craved cooked food. Some time later, he wandered to the western gate of the capital’s Balou Monastery. A monk there asked: "Do you wish to leave the household life?" The Master replied: "Yes." The monk said: "Go see the head monk and ask him to recommend you." Arriving at a thatched pavilion behind the monastery’s rear gate, he fell into a deep sleep for several days. Another monk passed by, saw him, and asked where he had come from. The monk then led him inside.

As they passed the Nirvana Hall, they heard groans. The Master asked: "Who is that?" The monk replied: "A novice has been ill for days; the epidemic is severe." The Master poured medicine from his gourd—peas—and had the novice swallow them with freshly drawn water. Immediately, the novice broke into a sweat as if freshly bathed, and by evening, he had recovered. The monks marveled, and word spread throughout the city. Soon, those seeking medicine thronged like a marketplace, yet the gourd’s supply never ran dry.

The Master accepted nothing in return, giving all offerings to the abbot for distribution to night patrols and inspecting officials. Though they knew he was no charlatan, the growing crowds could not be restrained. The matter was reported to the court.

At the time, Emperor Zhenzong’s imperial procession was away on an eastern ritual journey, and Chancellor Xiang remained in the capital as acting regent. He secretly sent men to verify the Master’s abilities and dispatched a swift memorial to the emperor’s temporary court. Soon, an edict arrived, ordering the Master to be housed in a secluded Daoist abode. He was thus installed in the fasting quarters of the Taiyi Palace.

Once settled, officials strictly guarded the premises, striking watchman’s clappers to ensure his safety. Daoists Hu Taiyi and others were assigned to attend him with food and drink. Yet each day, the Master ate only three or four dates and chestnuts. After more than a month, the imperial procession returned.

The emperor summoned him for an audience. Zhenzong patted his back and said, "You share Our surname." Thereupon, he had the Master tonsured and ordained as a Daoist, bestowing upon him the name Baoyi. Before long, the Master sought to return home. The emperor presented him with a gold-plated, silver-inlaid dragon-headed staff, a bronze vermilion-sealed parrot cup, medicinal herbs, and the like. He also dispatched the eunuch Zhang Maoxian and the Daoist Hu Dayi to escort him to Mount Shimen, where a True Seclusion Abbey was specially built as his place of transcendence. Each year, he was granted ordination robes and purple vestments.

During the Qingli era of Emperor Renzong, he suddenly ceased his repose. By the Xuanhe era, the Master returned to the capital and lodged in his former retreat at the Taiyi Palace. He submitted a memorial recounting his past, petitioning to restore the imperial favors bestowed by the late emperor. Renzong, who had long known the Master’s reputation, approved his request in full upon reading the memorial. However, the censors and remonstrators vehemently opposed it, and the Master, though twice summoned to the capital, spent his days drinking wine without ever becoming intoxicated, consuming only a few vegetables and fruits.

In the Jiayou era, he eagerly sought to return home, repeatedly expressing fear of water obstructions. After his departure, by mid-autumn, a great flood indeed occurred. One day, he sent his disciple Pu Weifu into the prefectural city to purchase medicine, but the disciple overstayed his return. The Master gathered his disciples and said, "I wish to journey to the capital to pay respects to Minister Zhang Pu, but Weifu has not yet returned." Suddenly feeling weary, he lay down and passed away, aged seventy-eight. For a hundred days, his limbs remained warm, and for a long time, his abode emitted a yellow radiance. This continued for three years before his disciples finally interred him. The staff he had used was the very one Zhenzong had exchanged for the dragon-headed one, and all the other gifts he had received remained intact.

Those who recognized him said the old man he had encountered was none other than Master Zhang Guo. For there is a cave to the west of the prefecture where, according to legend, Zhang Guo had once secluded himself.

Wu Baoyi was a native of Jiankang.

Wu Baoyi began his service as an attendant to the Daoists of Mount Mao. At the monastery stood a bell, which was struck at appointed times to summon the assembled Daoists. During the Jianlong era of Emperor Taizu of the Song, he suddenly encountered a perfected being and attained the Dao. His comings and goings became unfathomable, and people called him the "Immortal Youth."

The Huayang Daoist Zhu Ziying was well-versed in the alchemical classics. Emperor Zhenzong bestowed upon him the title "Master of Observing the Mysterious" and honored him with lavish gifts to invite him to court. Upon hearing of Ziying’s impending journey, the Immortal Youth sent him a letter:

*Baoyi addresses you: Truly, to laugh and wander in an age of peace, lightly scorning wealth and nobility—how can the luxuriant cinnamon of the cinnabar grove conceal the radiance of the bright moon? How can the sheer cliffs of the green mountains detain the nearness of the white clouds? Words are insufficient; the Dao resides within. Form and spirit [missing character] part, hidden among the Three Mountains, while name and surname are already renowned across the Four Seas. What constancy do years and months hold? What is there to seek in lead and mercury? If one lingers in hesitation, one will only end in decline. The pearl is round and perfect in its beauty; the crimson snow congeals and is naturally so. In the marketplace, who is not thus? In the mountains, who is thus? Water accumulates to become the sea; qi accumulates to become spirit. It is not that I know you well—say little, speak no more. Baoyi sells medicines, but what do profit and fame matter? Harmonizing with the light while dwelling among the common—how could the Dao and the worldly be distinct? Lightly ascend and travel; cultivate longevity. The Dao lies in much that is so. Roam carefree among the clouds and waters, never exposing the celestial mechanism. The knowing find speech difficult; the practicing see for themselves. I write these earnest words in place of idle conversation. A single day feels like two autumns; a foot’s distance spans ten thousand miles. The yang qi is like smoke; the desolate outskirts resemble water. Guard your harmony and equilibrium. Let this suffice—no further inquiries. Now, by means of this letter, I convey a fragment of my heart. When it arrives before the mountain, may it fulfill the crane’s longing. Respectfully submitted.*

He also appended a poem:
*The sagely sovereign seeks those beyond the world,*
*Summoning them to the golden palace to meet the numinous perfected.*
*I alone wish not to make my name known—*
*Green waters and blue mountains are the Dao I cherish.*

Before Ziying had finished reading, the messenger holding the letter vanished, leaving him astonished.

**Master Zhu Ziying**
Master Zhu Ziying, styled Yinzhi, was a native of Zhuyang Village in Juyong. At the age of eight or nine, he herded cattle in Guogan Village and could summon cranes, which some deemed inauspicious. His parents abandoned him, and he entered the Dao, becoming a disciple of the Daoist Zhu Wenji of Yuchen Abbey. At eleven, he was ordained as a Daoist and lived with Instructor Zhang Shaoying on Mount Jijin, abstaining from grains. His sandals often filled the doorway. The Master remarked, "That they come from near and far to tread upon our assembly—is this not too much ado?" Thereafter, he alternated between morning rituals on the altar and evening crossings of the river, intending to pay homage to the Primordial One at Bo She and the Celestial Master on Mount Qingcheng.

He encountered an old man who instructed him to close his eyes, saying, "Hold fast to my staff." He felt only the treetops brushing his feet. When he opened his eyes, he found himself seated at the foot of Mount Qingcheng, where he was taught the arts of the Golden Crucible, the Ninefold Transmutation, and the Flying Essence Sword. The old man said, "The world knows me as Chen Tie Jiao—I am he." With these words, the old man vanished.

The Master, considering the Daoist canon of the Three Maos incomplete and corrupted, traveled to Lai Xiang to collate and carve the ancient edition of the *Supreme Clarity*. After more than a year, a Daoist surnamed Wu inquired of him, "Are you willing to go?" The Master replied, "How dare I not obey?" In the blink of an eye, a clamor filled his ears, and suddenly he beheld a bustling scene. The Daoist turned to him and said, "This is Hezhong Prefecture." Soon they reached the Yellow River, where the waters parted to allow safe passage. The Master followed, treading as if on level ground. Upon reaching the opposite shore, the Daoist joyfully declared, "A trustworthy man is teachable—I am the Water Star Youth. This journey has already reached its destination, crossing into the Great Yin. Though secluded and remote, it is not weary of profound depths. We shall meet again in another time." He then turned and departed.

The Master returned to his former mountain, where he obtained the seal of the Nine Elders of the Immortal Capital and tirelessly aided others. Before long, during the selection of Daoists for the Jade Clarity Luminous Response Abbey, Xue Ying, a gentleman of meritorious conduct and Vice Minister of the Ministry of Works, recommended the Master’s name to the court. The imperial court dispatched an envoy to summon him, but he submitted a memorial declining the invitation.

At the time, the emperor had not yet established an heir. An emissary, Ren Wenqing, was sent with precious incense to conduct a ritual, and the Master was commanded to submit a memorial praying for an heir. Empress Zhangsheng Mingsu then dreamed of dozens of feathered immortals descending with a celestial official, who said, "This is the fourth emperor of the Song." (See *Records of Sagely Governance*; a stele on Mount Mao attests to this.) When Emperor Renzong succeeded to the throne, envoys were sent twice to the prefecture and county, pressing him urgently. Unable to refuse further, he accepted the appointment and resided in the Zhaoying Abbey, where he was treated with great favor.

Wang Qinruo, the abbey’s superintendent, delighted in the Master’s brief audience at the jade palace and exchanged poems with him. After repeatedly submitting memorials, the Master was permitted to decline the position. Ding Wei, the Military Commissioner and Governor of Shengzhou, also composed a poem to see him off as he returned to the mountains. Thereafter, he lived in seclusion, claiming illness and refusing to rise.

During the reign of Empress Mingsu, envoys were frequently sent to present incense and conduct rituals for the protection of the emperor’s person. She also sent a personal letter with a pair of gold-inlaid bowls, saying they were used by the emperor in his childhood. For the Daoist community, she established a manor, where the imperial ink and gifts remain preserved.

Upon receiving the scriptures and methods of the Supreme Clarity, the emperor honored the Master from afar as his preceptor in ordination and bestowed upon him the title "Master of Observing the Mysterious." The Immortal Youth again sent a letter and a poem, urging him to further conceal his brilliance.

Today, the altar of the memorial, the cinnabar cauldron, and the bestowed bell still stand beside the Qian Yuan Abbey in the secluded corner of Mount Mao. This was his former retreat, where the stele *Luminous Radiance of the Reclusive Immortal* records his immortal traces in detail.

**Immortal Li**
Le Shi served the Song dynasty as an Imperial Censor of the Western Capital. Once, he dreamed of being summoned by the Celestial Emperor. Soon, he beheld magnificent palaces, and the Emperor said, "The ruler seeks an heir; I shall choose one for him." After a moment, someone arrived, and the Emperor declared, "The Central Plains seek an heir—go, and do not refuse." The man kowtowed repeatedly, begging to be excused, but the Emperor said, "Go!" He then departed in compliance.

Those standing in attendance beside him said, "This is the Barefoot Immortal Li of the Southern Marchmount." He was often deep in wine. The following year, Emperor Renzong was indeed born.

Another time, the Sacred Palace stood in the east of Luoyang, where the ancestral spirit-tablets of the imperial clan were enshrined. On the twenty-ninth day of the third month in the eighth year of Renzong’s Jiayou era, as the day’s water-clock ran dry, people saw an array of feathered guards lining the road. Last of all came a man clad in a russet robe, holding a yellow canopy, riding a horse to the palace gates—then he vanished. The next day, the palace gates stood wide open, and the locks on all the halls’ doors had unbolted themselves. Soon after, Emperor Renzong ascended as an immortal.

Liu Congshan
Liu Congshan, styled Shuntian and styled himself the Master of Vastness, was a native of Western Luoyang. His family had never served in office; his father had registered his household in Xiangfu of Bian. From childhood, Congshan was bright and quick-witted, with a refined love for Daoist learning. During the Xiangfu era of Emperor Zhenzong of the Song, he studied under the Daoist Wang Taihe at the Jianlong Abbey. In the fifth year, he passed the examination and became a Daoist priest. Poor in worldly goods, he sought only alms to support his parents. Through bitter cold and scorching heat, he never rested, earning universal praise for his filial piety.

In the first year of Renzong’s Tiansheng era, on the Qian Yuan Festival, he was bestowed a purple robe. In the second year, sixth month, he was appointed by imperial decree to serve as abbot of the Jingling Palace. In the third year, eighth month, the emperor and the empress dowager wished to confer the Dharma lineage. They summoned the Master of Observing the Wondrous, Zhu Ziying—a Master of the Great Cavern of the Three Maos—at the Golden Register Altar of the Jade Purity Radiant Response Palace. Another edict was issued, selecting over fifty scholars of the scriptures, diligent and devout in their practice, to receive transmission together at the altar. Congshan was among the first. He was further bestowed the robes, crown, shoes, sword, and sash of the Orthodox Unity lineage. Thereafter, the emperor strictly observed filial sacrifices, honoring his ancestors in due season. He specially dispatched envoys to instruct Congshan to recite incantations over food offerings before the spirit-tablets on the late emperor’s death anniversary, and to compile the *Three Caverns’ Scriptures, Chants, and Hymns* to present to the immortal carriage. Soon after, he submitted the *Incantation for Offering Food*. The emperor commended him and granted him the title *Master of Complete Simplicity*. The text was then distributed to all abbeys and temples. The ritual of incanting over food offerings began with Congshan.

When the Yanning Palace was completed, the emperor ordered the composition of inscriptions for the Five Treasuries of the Sacred Images. Many responded to the imperial call, but only Congshan’s submission met with approval. His text was engraved on tablets of gold and jade. During the Jingyou era, he requested to return to his original abbey. Shortly after, as the spirit-carriages of Empress Dowager Zhangxian and Empress Dowager Zhanghui departed the capital, he served as a Dharma master, delivering lectures and praises along the route.

In the second year of the Zhihe era, the first month of the yiwei year, Emperor Renzong fell ill. Congshan was summoned to the Great Celebration Hall to perform the jiao offering and submit memorials. The emperor ordered his ministers to bow in his stead. That night, as Congshan prostrated himself to present the memorial, the emperor suddenly worsened. His eyes closed for several moments, and the court was thrown into panic. After a long while, Congshan finally rose and said, "The memorial has reached the Supreme. There is a decree from the Celestial Emperor to recall the imperial carriage." Soon after, the emperor revived. He immediately issued a proclamation asking, "Who is General Ge?" Congshan replied, "Beneath the Three Heavenly Gates, there is a deity called General Ge." Another proclamation followed: "Quickly set up an altar and make offerings." The next day, the emperor’s health was restored. He told his attendants, "Last night, I dreamed I arrived at the Heavenly Gate. A certain General Ge said, 'The Emperor is not yet fated to come.' He urgently lent me a horse to send me back, and I awoke."

Later, an edict ordered the eunuch Mai Chengxin to build the Ge General Abbey southwest of the Suburban Altar. It was adorned with gold and jade, and Congshan was bestowed imperial robes, mats, gold, and silk. The emperor wished to grant him a title, but he firmly declined. In the early Jiayou era, the Daoist Registrars of the Left and Right Streets recommended him for a Daoist office. The emperor approved the memorial and appointed him Acting Supervisor of the Right Street, though he declined. Unable to refuse, he accepted the command.

In the summer of the fifth year, the people suffered from a great flood. He again submitted a memorial at the Funing Hall, and the emperor exempted them from taxes to relieve their suffering.

Congshan rose from Acting Supervisor of the Right Street to Vice Registrar. In his daily life, he recited the *Jade Purity*, *Root of Origins*, *Western Ascension*, and *Yellow Court* scriptures. As for absorbing qi and refining form, he practiced these diligently as well.

When Emperor Yingzong ascended the throne, the prime minister Han Qi again requested that a title be bestowed upon him, but he declined once more. On the twenty-eighth day of the seventh month in the third year of Emperor Shenzong’s Xining era, after bathing, he gathered his disciples before him and said, "I await the great wind. When it comes, I shall depart." Soon after, he passed away as he had foretold, at the age of eighty-one.

Later, a traveler saw Congshan riding a white horse like a soaring bird, who said, "Tell my disciples I have appeared to you." Thus, it was known that he had achieved liberation in the flesh.

He compiled *Rituals for Offerings* and *Formulae for Memorials*, which circulated in the world.

Master Lan Fang
Master Lan Fang, styled Yuandao, was a native of Bozhou. Elders of the prefecture said that from their childhood, they had seen the master, whose appearance remained unchanged to the present day. His hair cascaded to the ground, black and lustrous. His skin was like congealed fat, his brows and eyes widely spaced, his lips as if layered with cinnabar, his teeth like rows of jade. His demeanor was gentle and kind; in all his interactions, great or small, he won hearts with harmony.

When drunk, he would wander into taverns. If he encountered the destitute begging by the roadside, he would reach into his robe and scatter a handful of coins to them. He was fond of dispensing medicine, relieving the suffering of the sick.

Emperor Renzong of the Song, having heard of the master’s reputation, specially summoned him to the palace hall, granted him a seat, and bestowed tea and medicine. He was lodged in the Fragrant Grove Garden. Soon after, he requested to leave and was granted the title *Master of Nurturing Simplicity of the Southern Marchmount*. He resided at the Zhaoxian Abbey on the Southern Marchmount.

At that time, the scholar Jia Changchao presented the master with a poem:

*Imperial favor deeply graces the hermit’s frame,*
*His Daoist robe should be girded with kudzu as a kerchief.*
*Beneath the Peak of Fire, drunk beneath the bright moon,*
*At the source of the Xiang’s waters, angling for purple scales.*
*Once he saw the sea peach bear three fruits,*
*Yet knows not how many springs the red bean has seen.*
*When one day my work is done and I depart,*
*I shall be the spirit-bridge’s one who kneels to your sandals.*

The master replied:

*Recently, I begged the enlightened lord to free this body,*
*No harm in wearing a black kerchief beneath the pines.*
*Wild wine brims in the cup, floating jade foam,*
*Freshly angled stream fish, brocaded in scales.*
*After the night the crow fled the dark palace,*
*The dragon’s child in the cavern nurtures eternal spring.*

If my palace might find one of like mind,
Two more would join the paradise within our gourd.

The master had a disciple named Chen Tongsou, who asked why, without merit and practice, one could not reach the realm of immortals. The master replied: "In ancient times, those who cultivated merit and practice feared others would know; today, those who cultivate merit and practice fear others will not know. This is why their merit and practice remain shallow, and they ultimately achieve nothing."

When Li Guan, later a Gentleman of the Ministry of Rites, was still a presented scholar, he traveled to Mount Nanyue. Passing through Changsha, he drank at a tavern beneath the banner-pole when suddenly a man carrying a bamboo case and bearing tools for nails and hinges approached him and said: "You are going to Mount Nanyue. When you see Master Yangsu, ask him on my behalf: *How does one emerge from ten months of spiritual gestation?*" Li Guan arrived at Mount Nanyue and relayed this to the master, who exclaimed in great surprise: "Did the man have a white mole between his brows?" Li Guan replied: "Yes." The master sighed: "That was Master Hai Chan. I have nurtured the sacred embryo to completion, yet I fear I lack the means to bring it forth. None but he can fulfill my Dao."

One night, the master lodged alone in the upper chamber. As he spoke with someone, an attendant peeped through a hole in the window and saw the room filled with crimson light. The next day, a guest inquired about it, and the master said: "My teacher, Perfected Lord Liu, passed by on his rain-making journey and lingered to speak with me for a moment."

One day, after bathing, the master summoned his attendants and said: "I am now one hundred and seventy-two years old. How could I still cling to titles and honors? Yet I do not wish to refuse the sagely emperor’s intent. Now, I shall depart." With that, he passed away in an instant.

The master often traveled to western Shu but would also come to Hunan and Hubei from time to time. Even now, people occasionally see him. Another account says: Li Guan of Yuxi, while traveling to Mount Nanyue to visit Lan Yangsu, encountered a man on the road carrying tools for nails and hinges. The man asked: "Are you not Li Guan, going to Mount Nanyue to see Lan Yangsu?" Li Guan replied: "Yes." The man continued: "Then I beg you to deliver a message to Master Lan: *Liu, the Recluse, inquires of you—how does one emerge from ten months of spiritual gestation?*" After Li Guan met Lan and recounted the man’s words, Lan asked: "Did he have a white mole between his brows?" Li Guan said: "He did." Lan replied: "That was Liu Haichan. I have nurtured the sacred embryo to completion, yet none but he can help me attain fruition." Li Guan then said: "Master Liu inquired of you—how does one emerge from ten months of spiritual gestation?" Lan clapped his hands and laughed heartily. Suddenly, a rumbling like distant thunder was heard from above, and a figure radiant as snow and moonlight, indistinguishable from Lan, ascended straight into the clouds. Lan had already departed. Li Guan burned incense, sighed in awe, and withdrew. This was the same Master of Long Whistles of Mount Nanyue, whose flesh-body statue remains preserved there.

Master Hou

Master Hou—his origins unknown—peddled medicines in the capital during the Qingli era of Emperor Renzong’s reign. He appeared to be over forty, with neither beard nor brows, as though afflicted by some wind-borne malady. His body bore tumors and growths that bulged across his flesh. He wandered the streets and markets, selling his remedies, though few purchased them. Often seen half-drunk, he spent his nights among beggars.

There was a man named Ma Yuan, devoted to self-cultivation, who regarded Master Hou with deep suspicion. One day, he followed him. It was midsummer when Master Hou left, bribing the gatekeeper with several pieces of gold to enter a walled garden. From a distance, Ma Yuan watched as Master Hou reached the northwest bank of a pond, stripped off his clothes, and entered the water, diving and surfacing with evident delight. Ma Yuan drew closer and saw a toad as large as a mat, its eyes glowing like fire. Startled, he retreated. Soon after, Master Hou emerged, dressed himself, and departed. Ma Yuan bowed to him, and Master Hou laughed, saying, “Did you see me just now?” Ma Yuan replied, “Yes.” Master Hou then summoned him to a tavern and said, “I am one who ingests qi, yet I am fond of the imperial capital’s fine wine and have lingered here too long.” From his gourd, he produced a single pill and said, “Take this, and it will grant you a lifespan of a hundred years.” They drank until nightfall, then parted ways, and Master Hou was never seen again. Later, someone arrived from Shu and reported seeing Master Hou selling medicines in the market.

Zhang Jiuge

Zhang Jiuge’s origins were likewise unknown. During the Qingli era of Emperor Renzong’s reign, he was seen in the capital, wandering the streets by day and begging for alms. If he received more than he needed, he would give the excess to others. At night, he often slept in abandoned buildings or among refuse heaps. Even in the depths of winter, he wore only a single layer of cloth, his face streaked with dirt, yet many claimed he possessed the Dao.

One day, the Prince of Yan ascended a tower and saw a group of children following Zhang Jiuge along the road. The prince summoned him and asked, “Do you possess the Dao?” Zhang replied, “No.” The prince then asked, “What arts do you practice?”

He replied, “I have only learned the art of carefree living.” The prince laughed and offered him a cup of wine. Another day, they met again, and the prince gave him a jug of wine.

Over a year later, Zhang Jiuge came to the palace gate and said to the gatekeeper, “Simply tell the prince that Zhang Jiuge has come to bid him farewell.” The gatekeeper refused to announce him, so Zhang Jiuge hurried inside. The prince, hearing the commotion, summoned the gatekeeper, who explained that it was Zhang Jiuge. The prince immediately called for him, and Zhang Jiuge said, “I once received your gift of wine and am now about to travel far, so I have come to take my leave.” The prince ordered his attendants to pour wine for him. Zhang Jiuge then said, “I have a small trick I would like to perform to amuse you. May I?” The prince asked, “What trick?” Zhang Jiuge replied, “I need a bolt of silk and a pair of golden scissors.” The prince ordered that a bolt of yellow gauze and a pair of scissors be brought. Zhang Jiuge took the gauze, folded it repeatedly, and cut it into the shapes of bees and butterflies. As he cut, each took flight. In moments, the gauze was entirely gone, and the bees and butterflies numbered beyond count—some alighted on the prince’s sleeves, others clustered on the hairpins of the palace ladies, while the rest scattered and fluttered about the courtyard. The prince, astonished and delighted, watched in wonder. After a while, Zhang Jiuge said, “Lest I lose your silk, I shall call them back.” He summoned them one by one, and they returned, re-forming into the bolt of gauze. Only one corner of the silk bore a small tear, like the trace of a butterfly—one had been caught by a palace lady. The prince asked, “Can this butterfly be returned?” Zhang Jiuge replied, “No. If it had come when called, it could have, but now it is too late. Let it remain as a token of this marvel.” The prince then asked, “How long will I live?” Zhang Jiuge answered, “Your Highness’s lifespan will match the steadfastness of the pagoda at Kaibao Temple.” They drank more wine, and then he departed. Later, when the pagoda was destroyed by fire, the prince also passed away, fulfilling Zhang Jiuge’s prophecy. Afterward, he was seen in the regions of Hunan and Hubei, his bearing unchanged.

An Changqi

An Changqi was a native of Gongcheng in Zhaozhou. In his youth, he sat for the imperial examinations. During the Huangyou era of Emperor Renzong’s reign, after the court pacified Nong Zhigao and extended rewards to the two Guang regions, all those who had previously taken the examinations at the Ministry of Rites were granted a special court examination. Through this, Changqi obtained an official post as the sheriff of Yongding in Hengzhou. Later, he resigned due to some matter and never again sought office. Instead, he roamed the lands of Guangdong alone with a young servant, wandering freely among the mountains and rivers.

A fellow candidate from the same examination, Hu Jun, a native of Qujiang, served as the magistrate of Haifeng in Huizhou during the Jiayou era. Changqi visited him and stayed for quite some time. During their drinking sessions, he often performed playful tricks to amuse the company. Once, he tied several knots in a piece of paper, covered it, and recited an incantation. After a long while, the vessel began to move, and when he slowly lifted the cover, the knots had transformed into mice, gnawing and moving about as if real. When he covered them again, they reverted to their original form as knotted paper.

At times, he would chew mountain herbs and spit them out for others to see, and they would appear like sticky malt sugar. Sometimes, he would stay awake all night. On one occasion, he pointed to his servant and said to others, “Do not underestimate this boy. One day, he will accompany me in reclusion.”

In the second year of Emperor Yingzong’s Zhiping reign, Changqi again brought his servant to travel to Xia Shan Temple in Qingyuan County, Guangzhou. He said to the monks, “I have long heard of the Harmonious Light Cave on Xia Shan and have come to visit.” He then set off with his servant and did not return for several days. The monks suspected they had been devoured by tigers and led several monks and servants to search everywhere, but found no trace of them. Before the cave, they saw a poem inscribed on the stone wall:

*I bid farewell to the orchid tent,*
*The apes refrain from mournful cries.*
*With zither and books, I find my joy,*
*Who among friends would vie for ties?*
*Though elixirs for red turtles exist,*
*A ladder to blue clouds lies apart.*
*On Xia Shan I briefly dwell—*
*None may compare to Boyi and Shuqi.*

Below it was written: *Inscribed by An Changqi, former magistrate of Yongding County, Hengzhou.*

**Daoist Chen Jingyuan**
Daoist Chen Jingyuan, styled Taixu, with the teacher’s name Zhenjing, called himself Bixuzi. A native of Nancheng in Jianchang, he studied under Daoist Han Zhizhi of Gaoyou. Later, he left his teacher and traveled to Tiantai Mountain, where he met Master Hongmeng, Zhang Wumeng, who transmitted secret arts to him. From childhood, he read voraciously and never tired of learning even in old age. He personally collated and transcribed all Daoist texts, dedicating years to the task. Initially, he traveled to the capital and resided at Li Quan Abbey, where the community invited him to lecture. Emperor Shenzong of Song, having heard of his reputation, ordered a grand *jiao* ritual to be held there and commanded him to compose *qingci* hymns for presentation. Upon submission, the emperor praised them and summoned him to an audience at Tianzhang Pavilion, bestowing upon him his current teacher’s name. He was also granted a change of ceremonial robes and promoted to Vice Daoist Registrar of the Left and Right Streets.

In the *jimao* year, he petitioned to return to Mount Lu to bury his parents. The emperor granted him silver to assist in the endeavor. His luggage contained nothing else—one hundred bundles were all classics of history and philosophy. In his residence, he separated Daoist, Confucian, and medical texts into distinct halls, and when scholars from all directions came to study under him, he assigned them to halls matching their disciplines, engaging in rigorous discussion. Thus, each person could fully pursue their learning. He employed two servants, named Huangjing and Gouqi, who were docile and untroublesome—truly the attendants of a man of the Dao.

The ministers Wang Anshi and Wang Gui enjoyed his company. When Jingyuan first returned to Mount Lu, he bid farewell to Anshi, who asked the reason for his departure. Jingyuan replied, “I am but a rustic, yet now I bear official duties, with bureaucratic responsibilities and suspicions at every turn. It would be better to return to Mount Lu.” Anshi recorded his words on his desk:

*An official’s duties weigh heavy,*
*Each matter invites suspicion’s gaze.*
*My wild nature cannot endure this—*
*To Mount Lu I return, away.*

He later added: *Zhenjing spoke thus.*

Jingyuan excelled in regular script, modeling his work after Wang Xizhi’s *Yue Yi Lun* and *Huangting Jing*, as well as Ouyang Xun’s *Huadu Temple Stele*. At seventy, he bathed, changed his clothes, uttered a final phrase, let out a long whistle, and passed away seated upright. His words were:

*Once I entrusted to harmony,*
*Now I shed this form.*
*Neither transformed nor born anew,*
*I return to my true abode.*

The world then realized he had undergone *shijie* (corporeal liberation). His extant works include a two-volume commentary on the *Dao De Jing*, a two-volume *Collected Essentials of Laozi’s Treasury*, a ten-volume commentary on *Zhuangzi*, a hundred-volume *Biographies of Eminent Recluses*, a twenty-volume literary collection, *Pronunciation and Meaning of the Great Cavern Scripture*, and *Collected Commentaries on the Scripture of Salvation through the Numinous Treasure*.

**Liu Xuanying**
Liu Xuanying, styled Zongcheng, was called Haichanzi. Originally named Cao, styled Zhaoyuan, he later changed his name upon attaining the Dao. A native of Guangling in Yan territory (some say of the Great Liao), he passed the imperial examinations in classics and served as prime minister to Liu Shouguang, ruler of Yan. Fond of theories on nature and destiny, he revered the teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi. One day, a Daoist arrived for an audience. Haichan invited him to sit in the main hall and treated him with the courtesy due a guest. When asked his name and lineage, the Daoist did not respond, only calling himself Zhengyangzi. Haichan humbly sought his instruction, and the Daoist expounded on the principles of purity and non-action, as well as the essentials of the Golden Elixir of midnight return.

After finishing, the Daoist requested ten goose eggs and ten copper coins. Placing one coin on the table, he stacked the eggs atop it like a pagoda. Haichan marveled and exclaimed, “How precarious!” The Daoist replied, “For one dwelling in the realm of honor and emolument, treading the ground of woe and peril, the danger is far greater than this.” He then took all the coins, split them in two, and tossed them aside before departing. Haichan was profoundly awakened.

That night, he ordered his household to prepare a feast and discarded his gold and jade. The next morning, he resigned his seal, left the court, and donned Daoist robes. He wrote a poem:

*I cast off the burning house of three thousand fingers,*
*Dismissed the ten thousand households of armed guards.*
*—A record of what transpired then.*

One day, he abruptly left Yan territory, drifting far to the Qin River. He refined the Elixir before Mount Taihua and concealed himself near Zhongnan, his light veiled and hidden, so none could fathom his whereabouts. (Some say he was prime minister of Yan and suddenly awakened one day, abandoning his office to study the Dao.) Later, he met Lü Dongbin and received the secret instructions of the Golden Elixir. Thereafter, he traveled between Zhongnan and Taihua. He also befriended Zhang Wumeng and Zhong Fang, visiting Master Chen Tuan as a fellow of the unseen world. He composed poetry, and his collections circulated in the world. His verses on cultivation, such as the *Returning Gold Chapter*, also spread widely.

Later, he secluded himself on Phoenix Mountain in Daizhou. In the ninth year of Emperor Renzong’s Tiansheng era, he journeyed through famous mountains, leaving traces wherever he went. One day, at Shouning Abbey in the prefecture, he inscribed ten old poems, including:

*Drunk, I stride through white clouds,*
*Brandishing a bronze tail upside-down.*
*Leading a green-eyed servant,*
*He shoulders a slender gourd.*
*I speak of affairs from the Qin era,*
*My home by Ge Hong’s well.*
*Not reading the Yellow Court Scripture,*
*How could I tend the Dragon-Tiger Crucible?*
*Standing alone in the city’s midst,*
*Unsought by the vulgar.*
*I wish to take my thunderbolt zither,*
*And ascend Lotus Peak.*

Amidst the azure heavens, he bought ten oxen, tilled half a *qing* of streamside fields. Planting groves to brew cloud-white wine—all was the realm of immortals. Drunk, he lay beneath pine shade, idly crossed White Cloud Ridge. To go was to go at once, straight into the glow of autumn’s rosy mist.

There, he painted his own likeness beside it, gathered his robes to inscribe four characters: *Tortoise and Crane Together Live Long*. He signed: *"Liu, Idle Citizen of Guangling."* When he came to Phoenix Mountain’s Laiyi Abbey, he again painted his portrait, brushing in flying-white script the four characters: *Pure Peace, Fortune, Longevity*. Of the Five Stars he depicted, only the Earth Mansion remained. In his self-portrait, he wore a loose headscarf and yellow robe, a wine gourd slung from his right shoulder, a cloth sack dangling from his left—patched where threadbare, his bearing serene, his words unhurried. Those who saw it knew at once he was a man of the Dao.

Once, at Chengdu’s Green Ram Abbey, he splashed ink to form the four characters: *Longevity Mountain, Fortune Sea*. Though the two sites lay far apart—Shouning to Laiyi barely two stages, while Western Shu to Daizhou spanned thousands of *li*—he inscribed them at the same hour, demonstrating the marvel of divided form and scattered radiance, the boundless transformations of spirit.

When his elixir was complete, his corpse dissolved in liberation: a white mist rose from his crown, transmuting into a crane that soared heavenward. The *Complete Perfection Tradition* records: he descended to the world on the twenty-fourth day of the twelfth month, ascended on the twenty-seventh day of the eleventh month. The year is unrecorded. In the sixth year of the Zhiyuan era of the Great Yuan, he was posthumously enfeoffed as *Illuminated Awakening, Vast Dao Perfected Lord*. Zhang Yongcheng—Zhang Boduan, a man of Tiantai.

In his youth, he studied everything under heaven, wandering like clouds and water along the shores. In later years, though he had received the teachings of the Primordial Dao, they remained incomplete, so he diligently sought instruction, journeying across the four directions. In the second year of the Xining era of Emperor Shenzong of the Song, when Academician Lu Gongtan was stationed in Yidu, Zhang followed him to Shu. There he encountered Liu Haichan, who transmitted to him the oral instructions on the firing times of the Golden Elixir and the Reverted Cinnabar. Thus he changed his name to Yongcheng, styled himself Pingshu, and took the sobriquet Ziyang. After his cultivation bore fruit, he composed the *Awakening to Reality*, which circulated in the world.

Once, there was a monk who practiced the precepts, concentration, and wisdom, believing himself to have attained the supreme essence of Chan. He could enter samādhi and project his spirit, covering hundreds of *li* in an instant. One day, he met Ziyang, and their aspirations harmonized. Ziyang asked, “Can the Chan master accompany me on a journey to a distant place today?” The monk replied, “Certainly.” Ziyang said, “I shall follow your command.” The monk said, “Let us go together to Yangzhou to see the jade flower.” Ziyang agreed.

Thereupon, Ziyang and the monk sat facing each other in a narrow chamber, closing their eyes in cross-legged meditation, both projecting their spirits. No sooner had Ziyang arrived at the place than the monk had already preceded him, circling the flower three times. Ziyang said, “Today, having come here with the Chan master, let each of us pluck a flower as a token.” The monk and Ziyang each plucked a flower and returned. After a short while, Ziyang and the monk stretched and awoke. Ziyang asked, “Chan master, where is your jade flower?” The monk’s sleeves were empty, but Ziyang held the jade flower in his hand, and they laughed as they examined it. Ziyang said, “Nowadays, those who study Chan or cultivate immortality—people like the two of us—are rarely seen. From this day forth, Ziyang and the monk became the closest of friends.

Later, a disciple asked Ziyang, “That Chan master and our teacher both projected your spirits to the same place. Why was there a difference in plucking the flower?” Ziyang replied, “My Great Dao of the Golden Elixir unites both nature and life, so when it gathers, it forms a body, and when it scatters, it becomes *qi*. Wherever it goes, the true spirit manifests in form—this is called the *yang* spirit. His cultivation, however, sought quick results, neglecting the refinement of life and focusing solely on the cultivation of nature. Thus, wherever he went, no form or shadow was seen—this is called the *yin* spirit.”

The disciple said, “Understood.”

Ziyang often said, “The Daoist school establishes its teachings on the foundation of life, so it speaks in detail of life and briefly of nature. The Buddhist school establishes its teachings on the foundation of nature, so it speaks in detail of nature and briefly of life. Yet nature and life are originally inseparable, and Daoism and Buddhism are fundamentally the same. That Śākyamuni was born in the Western lands—he too attained the Dao of the Golden Elixir, uniting nature and life, which is the supreme Dharma. Thus he was called the Golden Immortal, Fu Dashi. A poem says:

*For what reason did he sit on Snow Mountain for six years?*
*Only to harmonize* qi *and spirit.*
*In a hundred moments, one breath—*
*Then you know the Great Dao is the whole body.*

Zhongli Quanyang also said, ‘Bodhidharma faced the wall for nine years before transcending the inner court; the World-Honored One meditated in stillness for six years before emerging from the mundane cage.’ From this, it is clear that Śākyamuni united nature and life, yet his projection of the *yin* spirit in samādhi was merely the practice of the Two Vehicles in seated meditation. Alas, his spirit belonged to *yin*, its dwelling unstable, requiring constant migration. A single misguided thought, and it would penetrate another’s spirit, entering a different womb—how then could Buddhahood be attained? This is precisely what our tradition calls the fifth rank of *gui* immortals.

The *gui* immortal is the lowest of the five immortals. Though it transcends within *yin*, its spirit lacks clarity, its ghostly gate has no name, and the Three Mountains bear no record of it. Though it does not enter the cycle of rebirth, it can scarcely return to Penglai or Yingzhou, ultimately having no place to go but to seize another’s body or enter a new womb. Those who cultivate in this way, failing to awaken to the Great Dao at the outset, seek quick results. Their bodies are like withered wood, their minds like dead ashes, their consciousness turned inward, their will undivided. In samādhi, they project a *yin* spirit—a ghost of pure numinosity, not a true *yang* immortal. Because their will remains undivided, their *yin* spirit does not scatter, hence the name *gui* immortal. Though called an immortal, it is in truth a ghost. Thus, the divine immortals do not recognize it.

Śākyamuni also said, ‘Only by the Buddha Vehicle can one attain extinction; there is no other vehicle.’ And again, ‘In the world, there is no second vehicle by which one attains extinction—only the single Buddha Vehicle can achieve it.’ Śākyamuni’s rejection of the Two Vehicles is the same as our tradition’s rejection of *gui* immortals. Alas, people’s capacities and measures differ, which is why the Buddhist school speaks of the Three Vehicles, and the Daoist school distinguishes five ranks of immortals and three thousand six hundred side doors.

Zhongli the Perfected said:
*Three thousand six hundred wondrous gates,*
*Each disciple clings to one as root.*
*Who knows the little secret of divine immortality*
*Lies beyond those three thousand six hundred doors?*

This is precisely what Śākyamuni meant by ‘Only by the single Buddha Vehicle can one attain extinction.’

Another account states: During the Zhiping era of Emperor Yingzong, Academician Lu Gong was appointed military governor of Guilin. He summoned Ziyang to his headquarters to manage confidential affairs. When Lu was transferred to another post, Ziyang followed him. Finally, when Lu passed away in Chengdu, Ziyang wandered to Qin and Long. After a long time, he served Ma Mo, styled Chuhou, in Hedong.

When Chuhou was summoned to court and about to depart, Ziyang presented him with the *Wuzhen Pian* (*Awakening to Reality*), saying: "All that I have learned in my life is contained herein. I hope you will circulate this book, for there may be those who, through it, will grasp its meaning." Later, when Chuhou was appointed Intendant of the Guangnan Transport Circuit, Ziyang again accompanied him on his travels.

On the fifteenth day of the third month in the fifth year of the Yuanfeng era, he sat cross-legged and passed away, having lived ninety-nine years. A verse on his liberation through the corpse (*shijie*) reads:
*The four great elements dissolve,*
*Floating clouds now void.*
*The wondrous One remains,*
*Permeating the Dharma realm.*

A devoted Chan disciple cremated his body, yielding hundreds and thousands of *śarīra* relics—some as large as *ying* seeds, all shimmering in emerald and gold. When his disciples arrived, he pointed to them and said: "These are what the Daoist texts call *śarīra* gleaming with golden splendor."

Seven years later, Liu Fengzhen encountered Ziyang on Wangwu Mountain, where he left behind a poem before departing.

During the Zhenghe era of Emperor Huizong, Ziyang once announced his name and sought an audience with Minister Huang Mianzhang of Yanping. Huang had long transmitted the Way of Rongcheng and was deeply devoted to alchemy, though he was already advanced in years. Their conversation failed to resonate, and Ziyang left. Later, he sent a letter to Huang, recounting extraordinary matters.

His grandson Quan saw the letter but kept its contents secret, revealing little. In broad strokes, Ziyang claimed that in a former life, both he and Huang had dwelled in the Purple Tenuity Heavenly Palace as the Nine August Perfected Ones. Due to an error in collating the registers of kalpic destinies, they were banished to the human realm. Of those visible in the celestial wall today, only six stars remain—three others lie concealed in radiant obscurity: Yongcheng, Mianzhong, and Master Wei-Yang. Yongcheng was the Perfected Man of Purple Yang, Mianzhong was called Purple Origin, and Master Yu was known as Purple Splendor. All the officials once banished with them have already returned to the Pure Capital, while Yongcheng has further attained the rank of immortal. Only Mianzhong remains mired in the sea of officialdom, destined to be reborn among men for ten lifetimes—nine of which have now passed. Should he persist in delusion and be bound again to the dust in his next life, he will sink into a different realm of existence, with no hope of ascension. Ziyang, moved by their former bond as immortals, strove to deliver him, yet Huang ultimately failed to awaken. Upon his death, he was merely called the Old Man of Purple Origin.

The Nine August Ones are not recorded in the heavenly palaces—they are but faint stars. Ziyang had many disciples, among them the Daoist of White Dragon Grotto, Liu the Perfected, whose name was Fengzhen. He ascended in broad daylight, and was none other than Liu Douzi of Jiankang Prefecture.

As for Ma Ziran, his origins remain unknown.

In his youth, Ma Ziran practiced the methods of cultivating truth and refining qi. At the age of sixty-four, he arrived at a wineshop in Jianchang, where he encountered four Daoist adepts. Though their robes were patched a hundred times, their bearing was majestic. A youth stood beside them, and Ziran inquired after their names. They replied: "Master Zhongli, Master Lü, Liu Haichan, and Chen Qizi." Ziran was greatly astonished and hurried forward to bow before them.

Perfected Zhongli said: "Your bone and qi are unlike those of ordinary men. For decades, I have sought one worthy of instruction, yet none compare to you." Soon after, he departed with Masters Lü and Chen, saying: "You have found your teacher." Only Haichan remained, and he revealed to Ziran the secrets of the Golden Elixir, saying:

"In the profound and obscure, there is essence.
In the vague and indistinct, there is substance.
This substance is no ordinary substance;
This essence is no ordinary essence.
Heaven attains it and becomes clear;
Earth attains it and becomes tranquil;
Man attains it and becomes numinous.
One who can embrace the Origin and guard the One,
Turn the Celestial Gate and revolve the Earth’s Axis,
Will cause yin and yang to unite and Qian and Kun to merge.

Thus, open the gates of Kan and Li,
Let dragon and tiger devour one another,
Enter the transformations of Wu and Ji—
This is the numinous treasure of the highest heavens,
The subtlety within subtlety.

This method is within reach of all,
Yet most are blinded by ignorance and dulled by desire,
Sunk in the mire of love and craving.
Some grasp it yet fail to penetrate its depths:
They sit in breathless solitude, fixating the spirit into delusion;
They swallow saliva to moisten the throat,
Practice daoyin to exhaust the body,
Fast to the point of inner collapse,
Or expel and absorb qi to invite wind and evil.
Externally, they waste themselves refining lead and mercury;
Internally, they debauch themselves with yin elixirs.
Thus, their center remains unrefined, their spirit unpreserved.
From vigor they hasten to old age,
From old age to death—
Swift as six steeds racing through a crack in the wall.
How lamentable!

You must seek essence in the profound and obscure,
Seek substance in the vague and indistinct,
So that form and spirit penetrate one another,
And you merge with the Dao in truth."

Ziran heard his words and took him as his teacher, thereby attaining the Way. Later, he wandered to Mount Lu, where he slept soundly upon a rock for over sixty days. A passerby, seeing him, was startled and woke him. Soon after, he departed, entering Mount Hezao, ascending the Purple Chamber, and visiting the Realm of Pure Emptiness.

At times, he would wander the market streets, clad in a straw raincoat, wearing a bamboo hat and conical hat, carrying a large iron ladle to beg for coins. He bought wine, and when drunk, roamed freely among the mountains and marshes. Later, his whereabouts became unknown.

Shi Tai
Shi Tai was a native of Changzhou. His courtesy name was Dezhi, and his sobriquets were Yaolin and Cuixuanzi. He encountered Zhang Ziyang and obtained the Way of the Golden Elixir. Initially, Ziyang had received the Dao from Liu Haichan, who said: "One day, if someone removes your official seals and shackles for you, you shall transmit this Way to them; I permit no others." Later, Ziyang transmitted it to three unworthy recipients and suffered three calamities. He swore never to recklessly transmit it again and composed the *Awakening to Reality*, circulating it in the world, saying: "If those with innate immortal temperament and Daoist bones read it and awaken on their own, it is as if Heaven itself has bestowed it—this is no reckless transmission by man."

Midway, he incurred the wrath of the Prefect of Fengzhou, who pressed charges against him, leading to his imprisonment. Exiled, he passed through the region of He, where a great snow fell. He drank wine with his escorts in a village tavern.

In the depths of the forest, he came upon a tavern. After exchanging bows, they took their seats, and he was invited to join the others at their table. Gazing around with a smile, he saw that the guests were already merry. One of them had not yet begun to drink, so he said, "Why not come and join us?" Thus they drank together, and as the wine flowed freely, he was asked the reason for his journey. He told them everything in full. Reflecting on this, Yaolin said, "Prefect Deng is an old friend of mine. He delights in virtue and forgets rank, and would not think a thousand *li* too far to come to my aid. Since there is now a reason, this journey may yet be spared." Ziyang earnestly entreated his escorts to permit this, and they agreed. Together they traveled to He. Yaolin went ahead to see the Prefect, and through this meeting, Ziyang was spared. Grateful for this kindness, Ziyang said, "If I do not repay this debt, how can I be called a man? You have studied the Dao all your life but have never heard its true teachings. Now I shall transmit the method of the Elixir to you." Yaolin bowed in thanks and reverently received the transmission, devoting himself to diligent cultivation. When his Dao was accomplished, he composed the *Returning to the Origin* and circulated it in the world. He lived to the age of one hundred and thirty-seven and achieved *shijie* on the fifteenth day of the eighth month in the twenty-eighth year of the Shaoxing reign of Emperor Gaozong of the Song. He left behind a verse:

*Thunder cracks the mud-pellet cave of the skull,*
*The true body rides the fire-dragon.*
*Who knows who struck the blow—*
*Shattering the great void of empty space.*

Two years later, Yi Jie once again saw Yaolin on Mount Luofu.

**Xue Daoguang**
Xue Daoguang, also named Shi, and also named Daoyuan, was a native of Yingzushan in Shanfu. Some say he was from Guizhou and styled Taiyuan. He had once been a monk, with the Dharma name Zixian, and was also called the Venerable Master of Biling. Wandering as a cloud, he stayed at Kai Fu Temple in Chang’an, where he studied under the elder Xiuyan. Yan posed a question to test his Daoist insight: "Before the golden rooster crows, how can there be no sound?" He also studied under the monk Ruhuan, who asked, "What is the talk that transcends Buddhas and Patriarchs?" The answer—"A sesame cake, round and full"—struck him like a bitter plum, and he suddenly awakened. He composed a verse:

*The creaking follows the sound,*
*Yet when it arises, it does not come from another.*
*Suddenly, he knew with clarity:*
*The withered branch sings the song of no-birth,*
*The mud-snake in the well dances with a broken branch.*

The two elders affirmed his realization. From then on, he thoroughly awakened to the supreme, perfectly luminous, and true essential Dharma. His responses were swift and incisive, and he was equally versed in both Chan teachings and doctrinal exegesis. Moreover, he had a refined interest in the Golden Elixir and the cultivation of life. In the winter of the fifth year of the Chongning reign of Emperor Huizong of the Song (the year *bingxu*), he was staying in Qing Town of Na County, listening to a Buddhist lecture at a temple. There he encountered Yaolin of Fufeng County in Fengxiang Prefecture and Shi Tai, styled Dezhi, a posthouse attendant, who was then eighty-five years old. Though advanced in years, his complexion was rosy, and his spirit and bearing were extraordinary. At night, he sewed his own clothes. Zixian found him remarkable and happened to recite a poem by Zhang Pingshu. Shi replied with delight, "Do you know this man? He is my teacher." He recounted in full how Ziyang had transmitted the Dao. Zixian then bowed in reverence and took refuge, requesting to become his disciple. In the end, he studied the Returning Elixir, receiving the oral transmission of its true essentials. Shi cautioned him to go to a bustling metropolis and rely on those of means to accomplish this. Zixian then came to the capital, cast off his monk’s robes, and donned a scholar’s turban and gown. Veiling his light, he blended with the world and single-mindedly pursued this endeavor. He annotated the *Awakening to Reality*, composed the *Restoring Life* and the *Song of the Elixir Marrow*, and circulated them in the world. When Zixian’s Dao was accomplished, he lived to the age of one hundred and fourteen and achieved *shijie* on the ninth day of the ninth month in the second year of the Shaoxi reign of Emperor Guangzong. He left behind a verse:

*The iron horse gallops into the sea,*
*The mud-snake soars into the sky.*
*The path to the three isles of Penglai—*
*Originally, it was not in the west.*

The following year, Sha Daozhao again saw Zixian on Mount Huotong.

**Chen Nan**
Chen Nan, styled Nanmu and known as Cuixu, was a native of Baishuiyan in Boluo County, Huizhou.

Chen Nan made his living by crafting coiled trays and bucket hoops, drifting among the common folk, unknown to others. He composed the *Song of the Coiled Tray* and the *Song of the Bucket Hoop*.

The *Song of the Coiled Tray* reads:
*All day it coils, round and round,*
*At its heart, earth holds the honored place.*
*How much grinding and turning it endures—*
*Yet within, no trace of axe or chisel remains.*

The *Song of the Bucket Hoop* reads:
*The leaky teaches the leakless,*
*Yet how does the water flow through?*
*Once perfectly sealed and whole,*
*Within and without, all is true emptiness.*

Such was the sudden awakening in his words—his spiritual capacity may well be imagined. Later, he received the *Taiyi Daogui Golden Elixir Method* from the Venerable Master of Biling, and the *Jingxiao Great Thunder Jade Book* from the divine being of Limu Mountain. Whenever people sought talismanic water, Cuixu would knead earth and give it to them, and many illnesses were cured, so people called him "Chen Mud-Pill."

During the Zhenghe era of Emperor Huizong of the Song, he was appointed *Tiju* of the Daoist Records Bureau. Later, he returned to Luofu Mountain and propagated his Daoist arts in the world. Wherever he went, he exorcised spirits for people. In Chaoyang, a family’s daughter suffered from fox possession, her madness unchecked. Cuixu used a thunder talisman to slay the black fox demon. At times, he would let his hair down and run, covering four or five hundred *li* in a day. His clothes were tattered and patched, his body caked with dust and grime.

He would eat dog meat and drink to utter drunkenness all day, his whereabouts unfathomable. Yet he aided people and benefited creatures, with effects too numerous to recount. Once in Cangwu, when the prefecture prayed for rain amid drought, people feared death from heatstroke. Cuixu descended into the deep pool wielding an iron whip, driving the dragon forth. In an instant, dark clouds gathered on all sides, thunder and rain clashed, and the land received ample moisture, yielding a bountiful harvest. Passing by Sanda’s Dayi Ford, where the torrential currents raged and no boats dared cross, Cuixu floated across on his bamboo hat. While traveling on the road to Qin and Guan, he encountered a band of robbers who beat and left him for dead. Three days later, the robbers dispersed, and he revived. In Changsha, the military commissioner arrested and sent him to Yongzhou. Within a few nights, he returned to Changsha. At midnight, he would sit and swallow mercury, and by the next morning, he would spit it out as silver. He would give it to his disciples but pay it no further heed.

Cuixu often claimed to have lived forty-three years, yet there were those who had seen him across four generations. People in Huguang would ask him for poems, and verses would flow from his mouth in perfect coherence, though he refused to write them down himself, leaving the reason forever unexplained. His *Miaowu Complete Collection* circulated in the world, as did his *Luofu Cuixu’s Chants*. He transmitted his elixir methods to Qiongshan’s Bai Yuchan, who always attended him in his comings and goings.

In the sixth year of Emperor Ningzong’s Jiading era—some say the fourth year—on the fourteenth day of the fourth month, Cuixu attended the Crane Assembly in Zhangzhou. He told the assembly’s host, “I shall perform a corpse-liberation within this gathering.” The host took it lightly. Cuixu then left four lines, instructing Bai Yuchan to inscribe them:

*Thunder crashes atop my crown,*
*Chaos falls to earth without a trace.*
*Today I find the path and go,*
*Riding a hornless fire-dragon.*

At the time, Bai Yuchan was in attendance at Liangshan in Zhangzhou. Cuixu entered the water with an old man carrying a wooden bucket, leaning on a chair’s corner, and vanished. The old man had left an axe on the ground earlier; when they searched for it again, the axe was gone as well. Bai Yuchan sighed, “This is a water-liberation.” That same day, a magistrate named Ge in Tanzhou’s Ningxiang County saw him. Cuixu had long been close with the magistrate’s father and sent a letter with him to deliver to his father in Chaozhou. Only later did they realize that on that day, he had performed corpse-liberation here while appearing there.

Cuixu transmitted the Dao to three disciples: Ju Jiusi, Sha Dianxu, and Bai Yuchan. Master Bai Yuchan’s surname was Bai. His mother named him Yuchan after a dream, and his courtesy names were Yuezhongfu and Ruhui. His family was originally from Min, but as his grandfather had served in Qiongzhou, he was born in Hainan. Thus, he styled himself Haiqiongzi, or “Master of the Hainan Sea,” or Hainan Ye, “Old Man of Hainan,” or Qiongshan Daoren, “Daoist of Qiong Mountain,” or Pin’an, or Wuyi Sanren, “Wanderer of Mount Wuyi,” or Shenxiao Sanli, “Scattered Clerk of the Divine Empyrean.” From childhood, he excelled in the imperial examinations, but in adulthood, he wandered beyond the world and received the Dao of Cuixu, Master Chen Mud-Pill. At the time, scholar-officials wished to recommend him for special recruitment, but he declined.

After attaining the Dao, he subsisted on vegetables and abstained from grains for nine full years, yet scholars from all directions flocked to him like hairs on an ox. As for the broad outlines of his comings and goings, the general scope of his writings and teachings, and the numinous and wondrous aspects of his conduct—these are all recorded in various texts.

Initially, Master Bai served Master Cuixu for nine years before receiving his Dao. Whenever Master Cuixu wandered beyond the world, he was always accompanied by Master Bai. After Master Cuixu shed his mortal form in Linzhang, Master Bai then traveled alone among the mountains of Luofu, Huotong, Wuyi, Longhu, Tiantai, Jinhua, and Jiuri. Though his hair was unkempt, his feet bare, and his sleeves tattered, his spirit remained clear and his qi vibrant, no different from a youth in his prime. He delighted in wine but was never seen drunk. Well-versed in Confucian texts, he thoroughly grasped Chan principles. His words flowed as finished compositions, his writing unmarred by corrections. Though he carried no paper on his person, his brushstrokes filled the land. His large cursive script appeared as if dragons and serpents danced across the page. Skilled in seal and clerical scripts, he was especially adept at plum and bamboo paintings, though he rarely practiced them. When asked to depict his own likeness, he would complete it in a few strokes—no professional artist could match his skill.

Having received the Shangqing registers, he performed the rituals of the various ranks, with his mastery of the Great Thunder of the Capital Heaven being most renowned. The thunder seal he used was always kept at his elbow. Wherever he went to pray or perform exorcisms, extraordinary responses invariably followed. His timely pronouncements on fortune and misfortune startled even the deaf and vulgar. His name reached the imperial court, and though offered imperial favors for his reclusive cultivation, he merely smiled and declined. Those who wished to follow him in his wanderings were never granted the opportunity.

Once, while in the capital and strolling by West Lake, he fell into the water at dusk. The boatman was greatly alarmed and searched the lake in circles, but Master Bai was nowhere to be found. By dawn, however, he was seen upon the water, still slightly tipsy. On another day, a man wielding a blade pursued and threatened him. Master Bai rebuked him, and the assailant dropped his weapon and fled. Master Bai called out, “Come back, do not be afraid,” and promptly returned the blade to him. The people of the capital spoke of him as one who entered water without getting wet and encountered weapons without harm.

Later, he roamed freely among famous mountains, and none knew his whereabouts. Liu Houcun’s preface to *Wang Yinliu’s Nine Books on Learning* claims that Bai died young, which is incorrect. Some say he achieved liberation by means of the corpse in Haifeng County.

**Peng Si**
Peng Si, styled Jiyi, hailed from a prominent family of Sanshan that had produced generations of high officials. From his youth, he was renowned for his literary talent. After passing the mid-level imperial examinations, he remained indifferent to officialdom.

Having served Master Hai Qiong, Bai Yuchan, he received the transmission of the Supreme Unity’s *daogui* fire talismans, the writings on the Nine Cauldrons’ golden lead and cinnabar mercury, and the *Zixiao* texts on summoning wind and thunder. Returning home, he composed the *Ode to Crane Grove*, and later wrote a poem:

*I bought a leaf-like boat on Luo River—*
*glory and rank melt like wax, ah, let them go.*
*No trailing tail to beg for pity,*
*I early resolved to be ash-hearted, no schemes for office.*
*I’ve learned to plow White Marsh like Zhuangzi,*
*content to wait for the green ox like Lord Guan.*
*What use is the daogui? Who would understand?*
*Only the bright moon and clear wind nod in approval.*

At his residence, Crane Grove Retreat, he daily delighted his mind with the teachings of Confucius and Laozi. Using talismans to treat illnesses, he saved many lives. The local gentry, upon witnessing this, repeatedly urged him to enter officialdom, but his resolve remained unshaken. Yet his learning was vast and profound, his aspirations lofty and pure—surpassing even the filial and incorrupt of ancient times. When those in power sought to recommend him to the court as a reclusive worthy, he demurred and declined. Thenceforth, he shut his door all day, severing all social ties. Matters of livelihood and family scarcely crossed his mind. His wife, Pan Ruizhu, shared his resolve, and from dawn to dusk, they devoted themselves solely to cultivation. When Peng Si felt inspired, he would compose poetry or drink wine, always drinking to profound intoxication before stopping. If ghosts or spirits afflicted someone, he would cure them with cinnabar talismans, and they would recover. His deep immersion in the Daoist arts, his ability to summon wind and thunder with a whistle, earned him widespread admiration. Later, he achieved liberation by means of the corpse in Fuzhou. Today, Phoenix Hill’s Crane Grove Abbey still stands east of the city.

**Zhu Ju**
Zhu Ju, styled Cuiyang, was born into a family from Wangjiang in Anqing, Huai West, though his ancestors had left no mark on their era. At his birth, his mother, Madam Yan, dreamed of swallowing a star as large and bright as a bushel. After fifteen months of pregnancy, she grew anxious. One day, she encountered a Daoist at her doorstep holding an object like an orange. The Daoist said, “Eat this, and your child will be born.” Overjoyed, she accepted it. When she asked his name, the Daoist produced a fan from his sleeve, upon which were written the characters *Ju Junzi* (“Master Orange”). “That is my name,” he said. With that, he vanished. Soon after, Zhu Ju was born, on the twenty-sixth day of the eleventh lunar month in the *renxu* year. His father, struck by the marvel, named him *Juzi* (“Orange Child”). By the age of six, he had lost both parents. Gifted and intelligent from birth, Zhu Ju aspired to Confucian scholarship, excelling especially in the *Book of Changes* and numerology. He believed the mysteries of alchemical transformation were fully contained therein. Twice he passed the provincial examinations but never realized his ambition for the imperial degree.

Delighted by the study of Daoist and Buddhist scriptures, Zhu Ju later gazed at his reflection by the water’s edge and was suddenly struck with enlightenment. From that moment, he scorned fame and profit, yearning instead for cultivation and refinement. Wherever he traveled, he would ascend renowned mountains and scenic sites, ever seeking a master to guide him into the Dao.

In the *wuzi* year, he journeyed to Boluo in Hui Prefecture. One day, amid the dust of the road, he encountered a Daoist who clutched an orange, his manner wild as if mad. Singing and laughing as he walked, the Daoist chanted:
*“Orange, orange, orange—none know its worth.
Only one surnamed Zhu shall grasp its truth.”*
The crowd was astonished, none understanding his meaning. Zhu Ju alone felt a stirring within and followed him to a secluded spot beyond the outskirts. There, he bowed and asked, “Are you not the True Man Ju Junzi?”

The Daoist started in surprise. “Who are you?”
Zhu Ju gave his name, and the Daoist suddenly recalled the events of years past. “What is it you truly desire?” he asked. “Wealth or rank—choose either, and I shall grant it.”
Zhu Ju smiled and replied, “Worldly wealth and rank are like vomit upon the sea or clouds in the sky—gathering and scattering without constancy. But I have heard that the immortals possess the secret of eternal life, the marvel of bone-transformation and the return of yang. Might I be permitted to hear of this?”

The Daoist fell silent, offering no answer. Zhu Ju wept and pleaded again, “By past-life fortune, I have met a transcendent master. Though I am foolish and unworthy, I beg you to bestow your illumination.”
The Daoist then spoke to him, saying, “The breath—it is the self’s heart, the primordial *qi*, the root of emptiness and the master of creation. Its rising and falling, its parting and merging, all arise from the heart. The reason beings lose their original nature, revolving through the six paths and drifting among the four births, is their failure to comprehend this heart. Thus, the ancient immortals and sages sought only to make people understand this heart. To understand the heart is to see one’s own nature; to see one’s own nature is to be not far from sagehood. If this heart remains unenlightened, it is not the wondrous Dao of supreme, perfect awakening.”

At these words, Zhu Ju was as if lost in a daze. The Daoist then pointed to a great boulder before the mountain and instructed him to return at dawn the next day, saying, “I shall then deliver you.” Zhu Ju went repeatedly, but the Daoist was already seated upon the stone. “Why are you late?” he asked. Zhu Ju, ashamed, apologized and withdrew. When he returned at midnight, the Daoist said, “Now is the time for your coming.”

There, beneath heaven and earth, they swore a solemn pact. The Daoist imparted to him the secrets of the nine cauldrons, the elixir knife, the fire talismans, the texts of the Five Thunders and the Jade Script, the methods of the Nine-Eight Flying Spirit Yang Dao, and the oral transmissions of the heart-mind. He charged Zhu Ju to build a hut on Mount Wankong and cultivate according to these teachings. “Later, a child will come to you,” he said. “You must transmit the Dao to him, that he may succeed you. Grant this to no other.” When his work was complete, the Daoist promised to sponsor his ascent to the heavens.

Zhu Ju bowed in gratitude. The Daoist then rose upon the clouds and slowly departed. This Daoist was none other than Ju Junzi, the same who had appeared to Zhu Ju’s mother, and his style was Jiuxia. Jiuxia’s own master was Chen Niuwan of Cuixu.

Zhu Ju reverently followed his instructions, entering Mount Wankong to build a hut and cultivate. Later, those who climbed the mountain saw a child, pure and white as jade, washing his hands by the Wanshui River before the hut. His movements were swift as a shooting star. When they followed him into the hut, he vanished without a trace, leaving only Zhu Ju seated solemnly within. All declared that the child was Zhu Ju’s manifestation in infant form.

Later, troubled by bandits, Zhu Ju entered Min and traveled to Boluo in Hui Prefecture. There, a fellow townsman named Chen Liu stayed with him, and for a time, Zhu Ju lingered, drinking wine and indulging in meat and fish without restraint. Some, astonished, asked, “Master, you once observed such strict abstinence—why now do you indulge so freely?”
Zhu Ju replied, “I mingle with the world, blending my light and harmonizing with the dust, not wishing to set myself apart. Have you not heard of the fish and the tiger? If a fish leaves its school and leaps onto the shore, it dies; if a tiger leaves the mountains and enters the marketplace, it is captured. My heart is one with the Dao, transcending all illusions. The subtlety of the supreme principle lies in having a body beyond the body—thus, it is not for the worldly to comprehend.”

Zhu Ju remained in Hui for three years. One day, as the weather turned bitterly cold, he suddenly said to Chen Liu, “I shall soon depart. Why not prepare for me?”
Chen Liu could not fathom his meaning. The next day, Zhu Ju sat in transformation within the inn. Chen Liu and the innkeeper carried his body outside, where it miraculously turned green and yielded over ten strings of cash, which they used for his burial rites. The following day, Zhu Ju revived.

Several days later, he entered the city and said to Chen Liu, “Today, I shall stand in transformation before the county yamen.” Chen Liu followed his instructions. After the transformation, they molded his form in clay, and over a thousand spectators gathered in awe. Suddenly, a drunken clerk from Boluo pushed forward, shouting, “You faked a seated transformation before—now you fake a standing one!” He seized a stool and struck the clay figure, which crumbled to the ground. Only then did the crowd realize that Zhu Ju had demonstrated a divine transformation and achieved liberation through the corpse.

This occurred on the thirteenth day of the eleventh lunar month in the second year of the *Chunyou* reign of Emperor Lizong of the Song. Zhu Ju had a disciple named Zheng Ruzi, whose style was Cuifang.

Yang Yi

Yang Yi, a native of Rongde, lived in reclusion and never entered official service, earning the name "Recluse." His father, Han Qiong, served as magistrate of Heyang during the *Xiande* reign of Emperor Shizong of the Later Zhou. Upon retirement, an abscess erupted on his thigh, and Yang Yi personally sucked the wound. After more than a year, Han Qiong fully recovered, and Yang Yi’s filial piety became widely known.

The Recluse possessed profound gravity and extraordinary ambition, amassing wealth to the scale of tens of millions. He told his son, Jiansu, “Divide my estate into three parts: one to honor the Old Buddha, one to relieve the destitute, and one to succor our clan. You shall manage my affairs, for I intend to depart.” Thereupon, he left directly to pay homage to Master Xiyi on Mount Hua. The master imparted to him the essentials of the Dao and, at their parting, fed him a pellet of elixir the size of a mustard seed. Yang Yi returned to his village and thereafter abstained from food.

One day, he cast a hundred catties of gold from a high terrace into the river, declaring, “Wealth is not to be coveted. May my descendants be virtuous and kind.” Thereafter, he grew ever more reticent. Whenever heavy rain fell, he would lie beneath the eaves, letting the torrents pour over his head until the storm passed. In winter’s bitter cold, he drew water to bathe, his body steaming as if with inner fire. At the age of eighty-eight, he achieved transformation.

Fifty years later, he suddenly appeared to his nephew Ji, saying, “Your fate is nearing its end.” And so it came to pass.

*By Li Jianfu*

Li Jianfu’s origins are unknown. During the early years of the Taiping Xingguo era under Emperor Taizong of the Song, he traveled to Pengchi and took up residence at Kaiyuan Monastery, yet the monastery’s abbot did not think him extraordinary. One day, when asked to draw his sword, he unsheathed it from between his brows, its blade flashing like lightning. He plucked the blade with his fingers, singing and dancing all the while. Then, he returned it to its place between his brows. The abbot was greatly astonished and thereafter treated him with profound respect. Soon after, he died of drunkenness on the road, and the local authorities arranged his burial. Not long after, he was seen in a neighboring prefecture, and those who had been close to him returned to open his coffin—only to find it empty.

Zhao Lingyun’s origins are likewise unknown. During the Yongxi era of Emperor Taizong of the Song, he served as magistrate of Mo County in Mo Prefecture. When a severe drought struck, his prayers went unanswered. Sighing deeply, he declared, “As magistrate, I have brought such drought upon the land that soon there will be no grain left. How can I go on living?” He piled firewood in the courtyard, donned a Daoist robe, and holding a tablet, burned incense as he prayed to the August Emperor: “If it does not rain within three days, I shall immolate myself.” Three days passed, the sky remained clear without a wisp of cloud, and he hastened to the pyre. Just as he was about to light the fire, clouds gathered, thunder roared, and a great rain fell, extinguishing the flames. A five-colored cloud descended over the pyre, and he, along with a young attendant from the county, ascended upon it. Later, the people built Zhao the Immortal’s Altar on that very spot.

Qutu Wuwei, styled Wubuwei, was of unknown lineage. It is said that during the Five Dynasties period, he obtained Daoist scriptures and took the name Master Harmonious Spirit. He taught that guarding the essence of lead could bring about transformation. When the Honorable Zhang Zhongding was young and traveling in the eastern capital, he lodged at the same inn as Master Harmonious Spirit. At first, he did not recognize him, but the master took a liking to him and met him daily at a tavern. As they prepared to part, they drank deeply and became intoxicated. Zhongding said, “We have shared this brief encounter, yet I do not know who you are. How shall I recognize you in the future?” The master replied, “I am a recluse. Why should I have a name? If you press me, I am called Harmonious Spirit. One day, you will see me in Chengdu.” During the reign of Emperor Huizong of the Song, Zhongding was appointed governor of Chengdu and recalled the master’s words with wonder. Though he entered Shu twice more and searched for him, he could not find him. Later, while overseeing the construction of Tianqing Abbey and the Wangxian Pavilion, he would often pause his work to wander there, sitting in meditation all day in hopes of an encounter, but to no avail. As his term neared its end, he made one last visit, resolved to abandon hope. At dusk, he strolled beyond the hemp fields and found a narrow path leading inward. Following it, he came upon a small abbey. The walls surrounding it were painted with images of ancient figures, though dust and grime obscured them. He swept the walls and examined them, discovering among them a figure in feathered robes who bore a striking resemblance to the man he had seen at the inn. The inscription read: Harmonious Spirit. Zhongding was overcome with dismay. Thereafter, no one ever saw the master again.

In Lizhou’s Miangu County stands Wunu Mountain, named after Li Wunu. Its sheer cliffs rise like knife cuts, and within them is a cave too high to ascend. It is said that during the Five Dynasties, the Perfected Lord Qu ascended to immortality from there.

Shuai Zilian was a farmer from Mount Heng, simple and unrefined to the point that others called him “Shuai the Ox.” Later, he entered Nanyue Abbey and became a Daoist. Seven *li* southwest of the abbey stood Zixu Pavilion, the former altar of Lady Wei of the Wei. Other Daoists shunned its desolation, but he delighted in living there. No one ever saw what he did, though he was fond of wine and often lay drunk in the mountain forests.

A great storm arrived, yet he remained unaware; tigers and wolves passed before him, yet they did him no harm. Later, when the Vice Minister of Rites, Lord Wang You, was sent to govern Changsha, he received an imperial edict to offer prayers at Nanyue and visit the altar of Lady Wei. The master was just then drunk and unable to rise. Gazing fixedly, he said, “This rustic Daoist loves wine and cannot always obtain it, so he drinks to excess whenever he can.” The officials grew angry at him. But Lord Wang, perceiving something extraordinary in him, had him carried into his carriage and taken home. After more than a month, the master remained indifferent and said nothing. Wang then sent him back to the mountain, saying, “The revered master conceals his brilliance within, his depths unfathomable. Now I shall present him with a poem as a gift.” Soon after, as Wang forgot his cares and napped in the daytime, he dreamed the master came to demand the poem. He then composed two quatrains, wrote them on a board, and placed it in the pavilion. The other Daoists were astonished and said, “How did Shuai the Ox come by this?”

On the twenty-seventh day of the sixth month in the fifth year of Taiping Xingguo under Emperor Taizong of Song, he suddenly told those in the abbey, “I am about to depart for another place. The pavilion cannot be left unattended—quickly summon my successor.” The others were even more astonished and said, “The weather is so hot—where could Shuai the Ox be going?” When they hurried to look, he had already died. Only then did they marvel, saying, “Shuai the Ox even knew the hour of his death.” He was buried at the foot of the mountain.

Before long, the monk Shoucheng of Nantai Temple, returning from the Eastern Capital, saw the master outside Nanxun Gate, his spirit serene and his bearing free. Shoucheng asked why he had left the mountain, and he replied, “Merely wandering at leisure.” He then entrusted Shoucheng with a letter to deliver in thanks to Master Li of Hengyue. When Shoucheng returned and learned of the master’s death, he realized it was the very day he had seen him. They opened his tomb to look, and found only his staff and sandals.

**Liu Xiyue**
Liu Xiyue, styled Xiufeng, was a native of Zhangzhou. In his youth, he studied Confucianism and three times sat for the prefectural examinations as a *jinshi* candidate. During the Danggong era of Emperor Taizong of Song, he left the Confucian path to become a Daoist and resided in the Laozi Abbey in the Western Capital.

At sixty-four, he encountered an extraordinary person and attained the Dao, thereafter styling himself the "Master of Radiant Clarity." He once remarked, "After scarcely a decade of diligent practice, others marveled that the years had not aged me." A full twelve-year cycle passed, and he felt as though renewed. He also composed a poem:

*Through the twin passes along the spine to the crown’s gate,*
*This is the root of the path of cultivation.*

One day, he took his leave. His disciples said, "You are old—where will you go?" Xiufeng did not answer. He bathed, changed his clothes, and lay upon a mat in his chamber. In an instant, a sound arose both within and without, and a golden cicada flew forth—then Xiufeng was nowhere to be found. He had left behind over thirty poems, which circulated in the world.

**Mu Ruozhuo**
Mu Ruozhuo’s native place and the circumstances of his entry into officialdom remain unknown. During the Danggong era of Emperor Taizong of Song, he served as magistrate of Fei County in Raozhou. On the night of the full moon in the eighth month, he feasted with guests in the county courtyard. After the banquet, alone in his private quarters, he suddenly heard the strains of pipes and strings descending from the clouds. Soon after, a youth bearing a jade casket arrived on a cloud, saying, "The Supreme Emperor has decreed: Mu Ruozhuo possesses hidden virtue and no flaw in conduct; he is summoned to ascend to the Southern Palace and join the ranks of the immortals." Ruozhuo then burned incense, bowed in reverence, and ascended to receive the decree. Together with the youth, he rose into the heavens and departed. His subordinates rushed to inform his family, but it was already too late. Only the lingering fragrance of celestial incense and the lingering echoes of music in the empty sky remained. The people of the county painted his likeness and revered it with great devotion.

**Lü Dalang**
Lü Dalang was a native of Cheng’an in Daming.

The Lü family had once been wealthy, but by the time Dalang reached adulthood, he had squandered their fortune in dissipation—yet without the slightest trace of regret. During the Jingde era of Emperor Zhenzong of the Song, he suddenly fell into madness. Wandering through the markets of Zhang, he would snatch and devour any cakes he saw; even pear cores discarded by the roadside, he would pick up and eat. Later, a Daoist priest led him into the mountains. Dalang verbally agreed, though his heart could not forget his family. The priest said, "You may return, but take these dozen gourds and place your robes and cap upon the bed. At night, sever the gourds with your sword, then hang the blade upon the door and flee at once—do not look back." Dalang returned home and, as the priest had instructed, cut the gourds. When he glanced back, he saw all his family members beheaded. Weeping, he departed. At dawn, his family found Dalang dead, a noose around his neck, hanging from the door. They buried him. Months later, a villager from Anyang arrived bearing a letter from Dalang; the family was astonished. When they opened his room, they found the very sword he had left behind.

**Wang Ding**
Wang Ding was a native of Xiangyang. Initially, he eked out a living through medicine and divination to support his wife and children. He once wrote a poem:
*There is a mountain wife, there is a brother too,*
*Now casting lots, now healing—such is my trade.*

Later, he met Master Zhongli and attained the Dao. He composed another poem:
*For eighteen years I sifted truth from falsehood’s tide,*
*Today at last I meet the sages of Han’s reign.*
Thereafter, he styled himself Wang Tongzi, and no one ever saw him eat or drink. One day, walking along the riverbank, someone noticed two reflections in the water. Perplexed, they asked him the reason. He replied, "Would you like to see them again?" After a moment, more than ten appeared, lingering before vanishing.

During the Xiangfu era of Emperor Zhenzong of the Song, Wang Ding was summoned to the imperial palace. Clad in hempen robes and straw sandals, he made only a long bow before the throne. Later, he departed, and none knew his whereabouts. His writings on cultivating the Dao circulated in the world.

**Liu Fang**
Liu Fang, styled Zhongming, was a native of Suanzao. Initially, he served as a clerk in the prime minister’s office, and through accumulated merit, was promoted to Left Palace Attendant. Soon after, he sighed and said: *"To be an official is but vain toil. I shall purify my inner self, cast off the dust and grime of the world, and wander in the company of Anqi and Xianmen."* Thereupon, he secluded himself in a humble lane of the Eastern Capital, devoting himself solely to clothing and feeding those who suffered cold and hunger, and providing medicine and stone needles for their ailments—yet he never ventured forth.

Gradually, high officials and influential figures heard of his name and wished to meet Zhongming, but he remained inaccessible. Many came to seek him out, and Zhongming grew increasingly displeased. Later, when the imperial nurse died, Zhongming suddenly felt the urge to withdraw far away, saying: *"Now I am unencumbered."* He then journeyed south to Mount Heng, where he visited Master Yangsu, Lan Yuandao. He proceeded further to Bangzhou.

At the time, his younger cousin Zhi served as an administrator in Qingzhou and invited Zhongming to stay at his home. Zhongming replied: *"I fled from the clamor of ledgers and cudgels—how could I return to dwell with you?"* Instead, he took residence in a monastic lodge on the eastern mountain. The monk Daojue remarked to Zhongming in surprise: *"I have burned oil before the Tathāgata for twenty years—my merit must be boundless."* Zhongming said: *"This differs from what I have heard of cultivation. You use your body as the lampstand, your precepts as the oil, and your mind as the vessel of illumination, shining upon all ignorance. The ancient Buddha of Blazing Lamp was such a one."* Daojue marveled greatly at his words.

After residing there for over a hundred days, Zhongming bid farewell to Zhi and departed, saying: *"I now roam the world at will, making fine mountains my dwelling and white clouds my homeland. I only regret you cannot accompany me."* Later, in a monastery in Nankang, he achieved liberation through the corpse. His disciple Ding remained by the monastery, and when a county magistrate came to pay his respects, a voice from the coffin called out: *"Cease oppression, sever ignorance, reject bribes, and judge no case unjustly."* The magistrate, startled, departed.

Hou Yongxian, upon arriving in Ruizhou, saw Zhongming in the marketplace, clad in kudzu fiber and selling medicine. Jian Youcong, who had once encountered him in the Eastern Capital, asked: *"Master, you achieved liberation through the corpse—why are you here?"* Zhongming replied: *"From non-being into being, from liberation to returning to the true—this is but my ordinary affair. Why be surprised?"* Youcong said: *"When I lived in seclusion with you, your face was like red jade, while I am but rotting bones. Do you not think of me?"* Zhongming said: *"At fifty, though I aspired to the Dao, my foundation was like a dilapidated house—its beams crooked, its roof leaking, barely enduring for a time. As for Vase Master, at seventy, he spent his life fond of lawsuits, aiding others in litigation, depleting his hidden virtue. What more is there to say?"* With that, he strode away. Youcong pursued him, and Zhongming said: *"You may return."*

I am but a solitary cloud, a wild crane—how could you ever reach me? With that, he departed, and none knew where he went.

During the Qingli era of Emperor Renzong of the Song, a recluse traveled to Mount Tai in the east and called upon Registrar Guo Jifu. Once seated, Guo examined his calling card and saw the name Luo Daocheng. Asking of his hometown, the recluse replied: *"A man of Bang."*

Guo detained him for a drink, whereupon the recluse said: *"I have long wished to wander the eastern lands. Arriving at Mount Tai some days prior, I have already traversed its narrow paths. Yet by day’s end, I shall return south."* He then borrowed brush and paper to compose a poem:

*Drawn by the spirit’s allure, I wandered east by chance,*
*The jade-green peaks stand cold, layering autumn’s advance.*
*Ascending to the heights where peace and vastness reign,*
*Roots coil and stretch to bind a dozen states in chain.*

He then wrote a matching verse:

*My tracks drift with the clouds and waters, wandering free,*
*Where summer valleys hold a chill more keen than autumn’s glee.*
*Even apes and crows, by nature bound to old affection,*
*Turn back to the seaside states with one swift retrofection.*

As he took his leave, Guo dispatched a servant to see him off. Upon reaching the inn, the recluse composed another poem and handed it to the clerk, saying:

*A white mule bears me swift as racing clouds,*
*Wherever I alight, my idle verses linger near.*
*If you would know my name and whence I spring,*
*Behold the stone beneath Bangyang’s mountain clear.*

Later, inquiries in Bang revealed: *"There stands a temple to Perfected Lord Luo, who attained the Dao and rode a white mule in his travels. The mule’s likeness remains carved upon the cliffside to this day."*

Zeng Zhijing
Zeng Zhijing was a native of Luling.

In his youth, he drank no wine nor ate meat, steadfast and solemn, speaking little. Upon reaching adulthood, he left to become a Daoist, deepening his silence and withdrawing further from the world. Suddenly, a stranger of extraordinary bearing passed by and transmitted the Dao to him. From then on, he shut his door and practiced grain avoidance for five or six years. The stranger returned to observe him and said, "Not yet." He spoke with him briefly before departing. Several years later, the stranger reappeared and said, "Now it is time." Thereupon, Zeng Zhijing unsealed his gate and opened his windows. When others glimpsed him, his bearing was as though carved of jade.

In the spring of the second year of Zhihe during the reign of Emperor Renzong of Song, he suddenly told his disciples: "In the ninth month, I shall journey to Mount Heng. The appointed hour beyond this world must not be missed." When the time came, he sat upright and transformed. After his burial, at the onset of winter, peach blossoms bloomed vividly beside his grave. Soon after, a letter from Zeng Zhijing arrived from Mount Heng, exhorting his disciples to cultivate the Dao.

Guizhenzi
Tang Zizheng was a native of Guizhou. During the reign of Emperor Yingzong of Song in the Zhiping era, he traveled to the capital to take the imperial examinations. En route to Quanzhou, he hired a porter to carry his heavy luggage. The man moved as swiftly as a bird in flight, always staying a hundred paces ahead even when Tang urged his horse to gallop. Fearing the porter might flee, Tang dismissed him. That very day, the porter covered the two thousand seven hundred *li* from Quanzhou to Tangzhou, arriving by midday. He left a letter with the post station clerk, saying, "When the scholar Tang from Guizhou arrives, deliver this to him." Tang arrived over a month later. The clerk handed him the letter, inscribed: *Presented to Scholar Tang of Guizhou, respectfully sealed by Guizhenzi.* Upon opening it, he found only a poem:

*In Yuanzhou we met, then parted for Quanzhou,*
*Failing to encounter the master, your Dao remains unperfected.*
*Most men seek wealth and rank with all their heart,*
*Yet in the end, none may learn the immortal’s art.*
*Dispense the elixirs in your basket without cease,*
*Guard the cinnabar in your tortoise-shell, do not transmit it amiss.*
*When the horned dragon’s feast is prepared,*
*Come then to the yellow cliffs beyond the forest springs.*

Tang inquired about the man’s appearance—it was none other than the porter he had hired. The day the letter was left was the very day the porter had been dismissed in Quanzhou. Later, Tang accompanied his family to Yongzhou. In the third year of Xining during the reign of Emperor Shenzong (the year *bingchen*), bandits from Jiaozhi raided Yongzhou, and Tang’s entire household perished—this was the "horned dragon" foretold.

Sun Xiling
Sun Xiling’s native place is unknown, nor is the era in which he lived.

During the *Zhiping* reign of Emperor Yingzong of the Song, the Palace Attendant Chen Yun oversaw the wine bureau in Quzhou. By then, he was over seventy, his hair fallen and his teeth lost. Sun Xiling visited him, clad in tattered robes, and Chen looked upon him with disdain. Suddenly, Sun produced a small knife’s measure of powder and bade Chen rub it on his teeth. Chen did not believe it would work. Another day, he used it to clean his upper teeth, and his family, seeing him, laughed: "Why blacken your beard now?" Chen, startled, fetched a mirror and saw his whiskers had indeed turned dark as lacquer. Removing his headwrap, he found his hair had grown several inches, and his lost teeth had begun to sprout anew. After this, Sun vanished without a trace.

Zhou Guan
Zhou Guan claimed to be from Jiaodong and, though eighty years old, styled himself "Wooden Wild Goose." Skilled in composition, he wandered the West Mountains of Hongzhou. Fond of wine and unrestrained, he wore coarse hempen cloth. If someone gave him money, he would go to a tavern to drink his fill, scattering the rest without a care. For over fifty years, the people of the West Mountains saw him come and go, his face unchanged from the first day. When Daoist adepts sought him out, he would curse them, ensuring they could not draw near.

He kept a gourd, filling it with wine, and loved to compose poetry. One day, he visited the Longquan Abbey in Fengxin, where a Daoist played the zither for the entire community. Zhou covered himself with a mat and suddenly pounded on the door, shouting. The Daoist, startled, asked what was wrong, and Zhou laughed: "I’ve just composed a fine couplet—let me tell you." The Daoist, taken aback, asked to hear it, and Zhou traced the words in the air as he recited:
*"Plucking strings wears the nails thin,*
*Lying beneath a mat flattens beard and chin."*

Later, in Yuanzhou, he saw a townsman named Li about to travel afar and wished to drink with him. Li hesitated, so Zhou pointed to a cauldron boiling medicine and sang mockingly:
*"Heaven made you dull, fit only to be a pot,*
*Even with three legs, you cannot walk a lot.*
*Though ears you have, you heed no truth,*
*Only love to linger in the fire’s ruth."*

In the first year of *Xining* during the reign of Emperor Shenzong (the year *jiachen*), Zhou arrived at the Shitou Market in Yuzhang. There, he met an old friend, Zhang, who prepared food and wine and lodged him at an inn. At midnight, the innkeeper heard the clamor of carriages and horses outside, but upon looking, saw nothing—only Zhou’s outer door stood ajar, and he lay within, gasping faintly. Drawing near, they found him already dead. The next day, the matter was reported to Wu Gao, the magistrate of Xinjian County, who came to examine the body. Zhou’s flesh was soft and clean as if alive, and when they lifted him, his abdomen gurgled. The county clerk, Liu Chunchen, ordered him encoffined and buried.

Zhang returned home, where his younger brother greeted him at the gate, saying: "Zhou Xi passed by at dawn, saying he was off to the Twin Peaks." Only then did they realize Zhou had not truly died. Zhou’s *Huayang Collection*, in three volumes, never left his side, day or night, and no one had ever seen it. On the day of his death, Chunchen took possession of it. He praised its prose as perilously bold yet well-ordered.

Chunchen wrote a poem in remembrance:
*"At eighty, a wine immortal of the West Mountains,*
*Wearing straw sandals, his hempen robe threadbare.*
*Once shed, his mortal coil left the dust behind—*
*In the Great Ultimate’s light, time forgot its snare."*

Later, someone encountered Zhou in the eastern capital. He sent a letter to Li, saying: "Next year on the Mid-Autumn night, I shall pay you a visit." On the appointed day, he indeed arrived at Li’s home. Finding Li away on business, Zhou wrote in white earth upon the door and departed:
*"This Mid-Autumn night, I come as promised last year.*
*No sign of the broken-legged pot—*
*With a flick of the finger, all is bare."*

Later, Li fell from his horse and broke a leg.

Liu Yuanzhen
Liu Yuanzhen, styled Zizhi, was a native of Yeyuan. His family had long been farmers. Once, while playing chess with a guest, Zizhi was napping beneath an apricot tree outside the village. Suddenly, he awoke and told his father in alarm: "Just now, a Daoist master taught me chess in a dream and fed me apricots." From that day on, he refused to eat. When he grew older, he left home and roamed among the mountains and waters of Zhongnan. Soon after, he took up residence in an abandoned Buddhist shrine in the Shaling Valley.

In the depths of winter, he went bare-bodied, covering only his front and back with leaves. At times, the sounds of reed pipes, flutes, bells, and chimes would fill the air as a host of immortals descended into his chamber.

Once, while traveling with others along the road, he saw a rider pass by. Zizhi addressed him, saying, "I pray you remember the people." The rider departed, and his companions asked the reason. Zizhi replied, "That was the spirit of Mount Hua. The August Emperor, seeing that the wheat harvest was bountiful yet the people did not cherish it, ordered that a tithe of one in ten be collected. I pleaded on behalf of the people." He then added, "You should hasten forward and rest at the roadside inn ahead." Soon after, the sky erupted in violent rain, thunder, and wind, ruining a tenth of the wheat.

People gradually came to regard him with awe, and the prefect of the region built him a hut. Zizhi then began refining the elixir on the ridge, laboring for nine years. He instructed those living nearby, "When my elixir is nearly complete, you must beat the gongs and drums to aid me." The neighbors rushed to bring gongs and drums, and indeed, a strange beast appeared, fleeing in terror. Zizhi took the elixir and submerged it in a spring. After a year, he retrieved it and distributed it among the neighbors. Those who consumed it all lived to be over a hundred years old.

During the Yuanfeng era of Emperor Shenzong of the Song, Zizhi took leave of his neighbors, saying, "The August Emperor has summoned me; I must bid you farewell." That day, at noon, a cloud like a rainbow descended before his hut. Zizhi mounted it and departed.

There was a man named Liu Yi who became Zizhi’s disciple and mastered the Dao of guarding the One and preserving the Three.

Chen Taichu
Chen Taichu, the son of a townsman from Meishan, studied alongside Su Dongpo. At the age of eight, he became a disciple of the Daoist Zhang Yijian, who praised him highly. While Dongpo passed the imperial examinations and became a presented scholar, Taichu served as a minor official in the prefecture.

Later, when Dongpo was exiled to Huangzhou, a Daoist from Meishan named Lu Weizhong arrived from Shu, reporting that Taichu had already attained liberation. Wu Shidao, a man from Shu, served as prefect of Hanzhou, and Taichu went to stay with him. On New Year’s Day, he sought clothing, food, and money from Shidao, then bade him farewell. Taking all he had received, he distributed it among the poor of the city. He returned and sat beneath the halberd gate, where he passed away.

Shidao sent soldiers to carry him outside the city for cremation. The soldiers cursed, "What kind of Daoist is this, making us carry a corpse on New Year’s Day?" Taichu opened his eyes slightly and smiled, saying, "No need to trouble you further." He then walked from the halberd gate to the Jinyan Bridge, where he sat cross-legged and departed. The entire city witnessed smoke and flames rising, and a Daoist named Chen ascended into the void.

Ma Xuande
Ma Xuande’s origins are unknown. He once served as a Gentleman for Announcement of Virtue.

During the Xining reign of Emperor Shenzong of the Song, Song Ruogu served as Vice Prefect of Qilan Prefecture. One day, as he sat in quiet repose, Xuande sent a gray-haired servant with a calling card, followed shortly by Xuande himself. He wore a triple-mountain cap and a purple crane-feather cloak. Once seated, he said, "I have long since retired from worldly affairs. Hearing of your lifelong admiration for the Dao, I came to see you. I dwell on Mount Baodu. You should visit me there in a month’s time." Ruogu, unable to fathom his meaning, vaguely assented with a murmur: "Very well." After Xuande departed, Ruogu kept the appointed time and, following his official duties to inspect the horse pastures, arrived at Mount Baodu—still unaware of any prior engagement with Xuande. His subordinates warned, "The paths are treacherous and distant; we cannot proceed." Ruogu replied, "This is an imperial command—how can we refuse?" He urged his driver onward, pressing forward until they reached the sheer cliffs. There, a young attendant appeared, relaying Xuande’s invitation. Only then did Ruogu realize with astonishment. Pushing through brambles, he followed the attendant as tigers and wolves prowled the path. Deep in the mountains stood a thatched hut. Xuande received him at the gate and led him inside, where a simple meal of wild herbs was laid out. A furnace in the room glowed brightly. Xuande pointed to it and said, "I have refined the Great Elixir, and its completion is near. Your arrival here is no mere chance." He took two pills and gave them to Ruogu to consume. Ruogu bowed low and departed. When he turned back, the towering cliffs and ancient trees were veiled in mist and clouds.

At the time, Ruogu was sixty-two, his beard and temples already gray. Upon returning to his lodgings and gazing into a mirror, he found his hair had turned black again. Soon after, he left Qilan and traveled to the Eastern Capital. While visiting a monastery in Xiangguo, a Daoist in the crowd called out, "You carry the Great Elixir within you—guard it well." With those words, the Daoist vanished. Ruogu’s family was wealthy, with many concubines, and he could not adhere to the Daoist’s warnings. At over eighty years of age, he suddenly spat forth a crimson light and died.

Hu Yongzong
The Daoist Hu Yongzong, styled Chongzhenzi, renounced the world in his youth and devoted himself to cultivation. He was registered at the Taiping Xingguo Abbey on Mount Lu. During the Xining reign of Emperor Shenzong of the Song, a Daoist in tattered robes and worn shoes, announcing his name, strode uninvited into the abbey’s treasury hall as if no one were present. The other Daoists ignored him and left, but Hu greeted him and offered him a seat on a small bed, engaging him in unhurried conversation. Struck by the visitor’s extraordinary presence, Hu treated him with heightened courtesy. The Daoist then asked for wine and drank deeply before inviting Hu to join him outside at an inn. Hu declined, citing the late hour, and the Daoist parted with a hearty laugh, stroking his beard. The next morning, as Hu entered the city to pay respects to the prefect, he arrived at the gate before it opened. The Daoist emerged from the city, smiling as he passed. When the gatekeepers returned before the third watch, they reported, "A Daoist has been waiting here since earlier—we do not know who he is." Hu found this strange.

Years later, the Daoist arrived at the abbey carrying two gourds slung on a hemp rope, calling himself the "Guest of the Great Song." He and Hu engaged in refined conversation. When Hu asked about the gourds, the Daoist replied, "They hold my traveling provisions." Pouring them out, he revealed gold and silver. "Do you desire these?" he asked. Hu answered, "I seek only the Way of longevity." The Daoist then took some silver to buy wine, which they shared as he orally transmitted the profound Dao. As dusk fell, he carved into the earth, poured wine into the hollow, rinsed his mouth, and mixed the saliva with soil to form an ink. He blew on it, and it hardened with a resonant *clink* as he placed it on the table. "Consuming this can cure illness and grant immortality," he said. After another drink, Hu became drunk and collapsed. When he awoke, a strange fragrance filled the room, and a spring bubbled from the carved earth—no trace of the Daoist remained. Hu ground the ink into wine and drank it. His chronic ailments vanished instantly, and though he lived past seventy, his appearance remained youthful, his capacity for wine undiminished.

From then on, he gradually withdrew from worldly affairs. One day, he left a poem behind and shed his mortal form. Today, the abbey still holds the "Ink Immortal Spring," its waters sweet and inexhaustible in all seasons. Left Minister Wang An, Vice Minister Song Boyou, and other eminent figures have exchanged poems and inscriptions in his honor, recorded in the *Collected Poems of the Abbey’s Illustrious Worthies*. An account titled *The Immortal Encounter of Master Hu* is preserved in old records and stele inscriptions.

Huang Zhiwei
Huang Zhiwei, styled Mingdao, was a Daoist of the Taiping Xingguo Abbey on Mount Lu. His nature was serene and unassuming, his bearing imposing. During the Yuanfeng reign of Emperor Shenzong of the Song, he was appointed Keeper of the Palace, responsible for tending the sacred flames.

One day, Master Cui of Mount Qian, known as the Embodier of the Dao, came to visit. In their discourse on the marvels of the Mud-Pill Palace of Myriad Spirits and the single grain of the elixir knife, Huang was then transmitted the Way of the Nine Grains of Divine Millet and the principles of Golden Liquor and Sunken Radiance. Thereafter, he wandered as if drifting, now steady, now stumbling, his demeanor unbound and without routine. The people called him "Yellow Wind Master." He then composed the *Song of Huang the Mad*, which was recorded in his biography. Fond of wine, he would often sing loudly when drunk, and after singing, fall into wild abandon. He would frequently stand on the Bridge of Morning Audience before the abbey, shouting sharply as if rebuking someone. His robe was patched a hundred times, yet he paid no heed to his bare exposure. In the depths of winter or the height of summer, he remained untroubled by cold or heat. When scholars or officials bestowed gifts upon him, he would scatter them with his own hands. Sometimes he dwelled in the mountains, sometimes he roamed the cities, always carrying two cloth sacks. Whatever he encountered—cakes, pastries, medicines, or the like—he would toss into the sacks without distinction, yet they emitted no foul odor, earning them the name "Brocade Fragrance." Once, as a great snow fell and the forests and valleys turned white, the roof of his dwelling alone remained free of snow. He would often point to the altar by the wall of his chamber and tell others, "This is my path to Shu." Though he had never studied books, his speech was rich with historical tales. Though untrained in letters, his utterances were always lofty and wondrous. He befriended Cai Zigao of Hou Brook, Sima Zhibai, Cui Fengzi, and Gao Chijiao, among others. In the final years of Emperor Huizong’s Chongning reign, he surpassed ninety years of age, yet his appearance remained that of a maiden, his skin like jade. His mad antics persisted as before, and his capacity for wine did not wane. At the end of the Xuanhe era, an imperial summons was issued, but he did not rise.

When the authorities pressed him further, he traveled as far as Jiujiang, where he declared, *"Now there are two Sons of Heaven. What business have I there?"* Soon after, Emperor Qinzong ascended the throne, and an amnesty reached his temple. Before the fire broke out, the Master had planted mugwort and sow thistle in the Caifang Hall, saying, *"Next year, it will be settled."* The following year, when Han Shiqing’s rebel forces indeed burned the palace, it was on the very day the plants had been sown. His predictions of fortune and misfortune invariably proved true.

When the Master ascended as a feathered immortal, he was interred beside the temple. Years later, a traveler returned from Shu and reported, *"Huang Fengzi is now in Shu. I met him in Chengdu yesterday, and he entrusted me with this letter for his family."* The crowd was skeptical, but upon opening the box, they found only a list of Daoist names preserved from the chaos of war. They then opened the coffin to find only his robes and sandals inside.

**Bi Dao’ning**
Bi Dao’ning, a Daoist of Taiping Xingguo Abbey on Mount Lu, styled himself Kangshu. From childhood, he was quick-witted, with a refined and striking appearance. He could recite any classic after a single reading. During Emperor Zhezong’s Shaosheng era, he traveled through Jiang and Zhe.

One day, he arrived at Qianshan, where he encountered a fangshi. The man silently grasped his intent and said: *"To cultivate the Dao, one must refine the spirit and nurture qi; alchemical texts are but the ladder and bridge to enter the Way. If you cast aside worldly distractions and refine your spirit and qi with precision, you will naturally commune with the true and attain spiritual clarity."* Then, pointing by the water, he said: *"When water is still, its form is straight; when the heart is tranquil, the spirit is at peace—you must take this as your mirror."* Thereupon, he bestowed upon Bi a cinnabar elixir, saying: *"One day, we shall meet again beneath Shengzhi Peak."* With a bow, he departed, vanishing as if into thin air.

That very day, Bi returned to the mountain. It so happened that the position of vice-abbot at the abbey was vacant, and the prefectural authorities appointed him to fill it. Soon after, he petitioned for leave to build a hermitage to the right of the abbey, where he excavated a pond to store water, naming it *Qingxin* ("Pure Renewal"). Each day, he shut his door to preserve his spirit and recited one fascicle of the *Scripture of Salvation*.

On the third day of the first month in the seventh year of Emperor Huizong’s Xuanhe reign, a white-robed mountain recluse came to visit. Reminiscing about their past encounter, the recluse imparted to him the *Qin Yuan Chun* lyric:

*A single grain of golden elixir,*
*large as a millet seed,*
*descends in deep meditation to gestate the embryo.*
*Harness the root of yin and yang,*
*bind the eastern dragon and western tiger,*
*congeal the golden water,*
*and plant it deep in chosen earth.*
*After nine years without depletion,*
*the three fields’ work complete,*
*you shall ascend, qi perfected and whole.*

The furnace and cauldron open, the primal transformation is stolen—relying on the ancestral essence of spontaneity, all depends on the true talent of the numinous terrace. Cast aside attachment to the dusty world. The corpse’s spirit awakens the Hall of Light, yet the infant remains unborn. Fortunate was our meeting by the Huai’s banks, where the sacred elixir was bestowed, and the profound intent personally entrusted, urging ascent to the immortal’s ranks. When shall we meet again? A lofty gathering amidst clouds and waters, or further along the mist-laden paths of transcendence? In this world of men, let kings and nobles, however exalted, share the same fate as withered weeds.

Four days after receiving this lyric, he adjusted his robes, sat upright, and passed away. To this day, the right chamber of the *Yangsu* Hall in the abbey bears the plaque *Qingxin* ("Pure Renewal"), and the pond remains.

**Tian Duanyan**
Tian Duanyan was a native of Qi and Lu. In his youth, he passed the imperial examinations. During Emperor Huizong’s *Chongning* era, he served as *Qianshu Pan* in the Southern Military Prefecture. Before long, a death-row prisoner became the subject of dispute between him and Prefect Lü Jiawen; he immediately hung his official robes at the prefectural gate and departed. He entered Mount Yuan’an and dwelled in the *Qingxi* Retreat. Each morning, he would venture into the valleys, returning only at dusk. After over a hundred days, he suddenly failed to return to *Qingxi*. The monks sent someone to search for him and found him lying upon a rock, two tigers guarding his side—none dared approach. Thereafter, his whereabouts became unknown.

Years later, clad in coarse hemp and straw sandals, carrying a pot on his back, he visited his brother-in-law Xing Shu, styled *Heshu*, in Luoyang. By then, he was already over eighty, yet his face retained a youthful glow, his beard and hair lush and dark. The scholar-officials of Luoyang all sought his company. The master conversed and laughed freely with all who met him; when asked how he attained the Dao, he would not answer. In the late *Zhenghe* era, he was encountered in the outskirts of Xiang and Deng, his appearance unchanged.

**Liu Bozi**
Liu Bozi was a native of Qingzhou.

Liu Bozi would lean on a staff and, without fail, journey to Luoyang each year to admire the blossoms. Once, when Prime Minister Zhang summoned him from Jinghu, Bozi was drinking with a guest beneath the Market Bridge. Hearing the grand procession of carriages and cavalry pass by, the guest rose to watch, but Bozi tugged at his sleeve, urging him to keep drinking. He composed a poem:

*An exiled official, summoned from Huxiang to the capital—*
*What honor in the feasting and farewells!*
*Far better to drink with you beneath the Market Bridge,*
*And spare oneself the world’s alarms of favor and disgrace.*

Chen Yingzhong, who had long admired him, presented him with lyrics in long and short lines:

*Withered wood in form, drifting clouds in life,*
*Twice a year you come to the capital.*
*Then, on a whim, you wander back,*
*Idly viewing Luoyang’s flowers.*

*I hear the finest spring returns in crimson shoes,*
*Yet in the end, all fades to mud and sand.*
*Where words fail, flowers bloom and wither—*
*Not like the path I tread.*

*Youth slips away, unheld;*
*Hunger and cold my constant lot.*
*Wherever I roam, there is home.*
*This bright moon, flawless from the start,*
*Follows its portion—winter furs or summer hemp—*
*Never seeking the Red Water’s golden sprouts.*
*Who knows that with my springtime staff and a laugh,*
*I speak of cinnabar?*

During the *Zhenghe* era of Emperor Huizong of Song, he lodged at Xingguo Temple. People estimated his age at around one hundred forty or fifty. For thirty years, he had stayed at the inn of Zhang Dalang near Xinmen in the capital, sitting daily by the Xiangguo Temple’s east gate, yet none among the inn’s patrons recognized him.

**Shuiqiuzi**
Shuiqiuzi was a native of Zhenzhou. He first studied Confucianism but later encountered a perfected one and abandoned his home. Thenceforth, he roamed freely, indulging in wine, unknown to others.

During the *Xuanhe* era of Emperor Huizong of Song, a man named Xu Wenzhong resided in the eastern capital. One of his soldiers, whose feet had been severely burned by a carriage, met a Daoist who gave him medicine, allowing him to walk again. The soldier sought out the Daoist to thank him, but the man had since feigned madness, eating damp paper and winter melon seeds daily. When asked why, he replied, *"Winter melon digests easily; damp paper is hard to dissolve."* When questioned about the Dao, he said, *"Stillness and simplicity—that is all."*

Xu Wenzhong thus gained some understanding of his teachings and grew fond of them in his heart. Before long, he encountered Shuiqiuzi and bowed twice, seeking instruction. Shuiqiuzi said:

*"Man is a temporary convergence of the four great elements, mingled in the realm of impermanence. Transformation gives rise to qi, and qi transforms into form. Form takes the heart as its ruler, for the heart is the abode of spirit. Spirit follows resolve; without resolve, it follows intention. Resolve that attains unity is called essence. Only the utmost essence under heaven can unite the resolve and spirit of all under heaven. When essence and spirit merge as one without separation, transformation lies within one’s grasp. This is the Dao of longevity and enduring vision. Thus, the heart must not be left restless and shallow. As long as emotions do not cling to things, things cannot obstruct you."*

Thereupon, Wenzhong had a great awakening and said: *"Intention resides in the spleen, and the spleen, numbered five, corresponds to earth. Water is stilled by earth, and fire is quelled by earth—is this not how essence, spirit, and intention unite as one?"*

Later, Shuiqiuzi ascended to the Tianqing Cloister and departed as an immortal from atop a tree. Wenzhong rose to the rank of sixth-grade official, but his ultimate fate remains unknown.

*Comprehensive Mirror of Perfected Immortals Through the Ages Who Embodied the Dao, Scroll Fifty—Concluded*
*Comprehensive Mirror of Perfected Immortals Through the Ages Who Embodied the Dao, Scroll Fifty-One*

Zhang Xu bai, styled Zhixiang, was a native of Nanyang in Dengzhou and was registered as a Daoist priest at the Taiyi Palace. Standing six feet tall with a fine beard, he was by nature serene and dignified, well-versed in the arts of Taiyi and the Six Ren divination. He devoted himself to the study of the elixir cauldron and, encountering an extraordinary person, received esoteric instructions. He claimed his former life was that of Master Zhang Bai of Wuling. His disciples compared the date of Wuling’s liberation through the corpse with the time of Xu bai’s birth, finding them to align as precisely as tallying tokens.

Wuling had been fond of wine in life, and there was a poem that read:
*"By Wuling’s stream, Cui’s family wine—*
*On earth, none; in heaven, it’s found.*
*A southern Daoist drinks a dou,*
*Then sleeps drunk by the deep cave’s mouth, wrapped in white clouds."*

Xu bai was also skilled in drinking. Emperor Huizong of the Song, recognizing his exceptional Daoist cultivation, would summon him and invariably drink several cups with him. Even when intoxicated, Xu bai grew only more reverent. The emperor cherished him and appointed him to oversee the Longde Taiyi Palace. Within the palace, he expanded and adorned four halls—Hongdao, Zhenxue, Huibin, and Yinzhen—and established several hermitages, such as Chaoran, Zhidao, and Yunji, along with over ten small pavilions, all inscribed with imperial calligraphy. The plaques were mounted on silk, framed with antique brocade, their secluded elegance and splendor unmatched among all palaces. Despite enjoying the emperor’s favor for a long time, he never once displayed the slightest arrogance. Every day brought new imperial gifts and honors.

One day, six swift messengers delivered three vermilion boxes as imperial gifts. Upon opening them, all were found to contain gold dust. As he bowed to receive them, his expression showed no delight. He said, "These are the possessions of the court, not for those who follow the Dao. I shall merely store them away."

At the end of the Xuanhe era, a great thunderstorm struck in summer, and three dragons leapt from the eaves of the Xuanhe Hall and soared away. The emperor, alarmed, summoned Xu Ba and asked, "Is this not an omen?" Xu Ba replied, "May Your Majesty cultivate virtue to avert it."

In his youth, Xu Ba had studied medicine, and those who sought his treatment often recovered swiftly. After the emperor abdicated, Emperor Qinzong summoned him and treated him with even greater favor. All the scriptures printed at the imperial court, as well as the talismans and medicines stored in the Three Pavilions, were bestowed upon him, their transport filling carts for days on end.

When the Jin forces invaded the capital, they heard of his name and searched for him urgently. Once found, he was carried in a litter to the Nanxun Gate, where the various tribesmen vied to bear him, all treating him as an immortal. After being captured and held for four years, when the Jin returned to Suiyang and their scouts entered the city, the Daoists of Tianqing Abbey all fled. The Jin halted them, saying, "Among you are many extraordinary men—none shall be harmed." They then asked the assembled Daoists, "Do you know Master Zhang Xubai? He arrived in our land, and one day abruptly told the tribal chiefs, 'On such-and-such a day, I shall depart.' Your customs follow the Buddhist cremation rites, but Daoists forbid them. I hope you will bury my coffin deep in the earth.' On the appointed day, he indeed passed away."

Throughout his life, Xu Ba rose in rank to Grand Master of the Supreme Void, Attendant of the Harmonious Hall, and Feathered Guest of the Golden Gate. He entered and left the imperial palace under the sign of a jade tablet. Among the nine Attendants of the Imperial Presence were Lin Lingjiang, Wang Yunchen, Xu Zhichang, Dong Nanyun, Li Derou, Wang Chongdao, Shao Ruoyu, and Wang Wenqing. Only Lin Lingjiang, Wang Yunchen, and Xu Ba were Feathered Guests of the Golden Gate.

He resided in the Longde Taiyi Palace for ten years, never leaving without imperial summons. When visitors sought an audience, he would always receive them, and all guests were formally welcomed in the main hall. He never once called at the gates of the powerful. When attending the emperor, he would discourse on the Dao all day without uttering a word on current affairs. If asked, he would say, "Affairs of state are the domain of the chief ministers—such matters are not for the likes of us to know."

Master Liu Bian'gong, Liu Bian'gong of Binzhou, was devoted to the Dao from his youth...

An elderly man passed by his home and remarked, "Skilled at mending iron." The Master said, "My tripod is broken—can you mend it?" The old man replied, "If a man’s body can be mended, how much more a tripod?" The Master, recognizing him as no ordinary man, promptly bowed twice. The old man then gave him an elixir to consume. From that time on, he abandoned all worldly affairs and dug a cave-chamber to dwell in. Those who wished to see him entered through a small opening, yet none formed a true bond with him.

Emperor Huizong of Song thrice dispatched envoys to summon him, but he resolutely declined. The emperor, holding him in even greater esteem, bestowed upon him the title *Master of Lofty Virtue*. The Master was versed in all books yet had never labored over study. When conversing with others, he invariably spoke of the essentials of the *Doctrine of the Mean* and the great Way, often declaring: "In clarity and quiescence, free from the burdens of external things, the spirit remains whole and the guard unbroken—bees and scorpions cannot poison, cold and heat cannot assail. How then do men of this world harm themselves with desires, harm their descendants with wealth, harm others with governance, and harm the world with learning? Later generations, forgetting the root of their own longevity, never awaken. How much better to flow as one with Heaven and Earth above and below—would this not bring true joy to the heart?"

At the beginning of Emperor Qinzong’s *Jingkang* era, the Master left his homeland, traveling through Ba and Shu, floating along the rivers and lakes of Jiang and Zhe, and gazing upon Mount Heng and the Xiang—perhaps with the intent to engage with the world. In Shu, he gained two disciples, Deng and Chai, whom he thereafter kept by his side. Upon reaching Wu, he encountered Li Jici of Tonglu and transmitted to him a book of methods. Jici practiced them with utmost devotion, and the Way was fulfilled in him. The Master once petitioned Master Zhongli to seek aid in advancing Jici’s attainment, saying, "His nose aligns with the Three Swords, his brain refines the Nine Elixirs." Jici’s wife had long been blind; when the Master passed by, Jici spat on his hand and wiped her eyes, and her sight was restored.

The Master once made an appointment with Jici to attend the Crane Assembly at Mount Mao the following spring. Jici arrived as promised, where hundreds of cranes gathered on the mountain. Searching for the Master, he saw only the two disciples, Deng and Chai. When he asked them, they pointed among the crowd to a man of towering spirit and bearing, saying, "That is the Master." Jici said, "How different he is from before!"

The alchemist said, "The Master has already undergone the bone-transformation." He produced a piece of the Master’s former bone and showed it to Jici, who has kept it to this day. On the mountain was the Hua Yang Cave, where rocks stood like screens, winding in several layers, with unfathomable pools below. The Master entered with Jici and said, "From here, I shall follow the Yellow Perfected One to wander Mount Luofu." He never emerged again. Some say he now resides on Mount Qingcheng in Shu, though none may see him.

Liu Yuandao
Liu Yuandao, styled Jingchu, was a native of Kaifeng Prefecture. His family had long served as military officers, but Yuandao alone admired the teachings of Zhuangzi and Laozi. In his youth, he became a disciple of the Daoist Li Juyan, donning the yellow cap. His nature was simple, pure, and magnanimous; though offended, he never retaliated. Fond of reading, beyond the Daoist Canon, he recited the Nine Classics, philosophers, and histories with perfect fluency. In the company of guests and friends, he seemed incapable of speech, yet when questioned on matters, his responses were as swift as an echo.

When Emperor Huizong of the Song first promoted Daoism, he issued an edict to collect lost Daoist texts from across the realm, ordering Daoists to collate and authenticate them at the Bureau of Calligraphy and Painting. Yuandao was the first selected for this task. Thereafter, he gradually rose through the ranks, serving as Recorder of the Daoist Registry, then as Registrar of the Left and Right Streets, and eventually as Grand Master of the Supreme Void and Custodian of the Jade Pearl Hall’s Registers. Beyond his official duties, he never altered a single matter to curry favor, earning the admiration of scholar-officials. Whenever he attended the inner Daoist rituals or was summoned to the private palace to discourse on the Way, he received lavish rewards. Yet whatever Yuandao received, he immediately distributed. One day, when several Daoist officials, including Lin Lingjiang, attended the emperor’s side, His Majesty presented treasures and allowed each to take what they desired. Yuandao alone chose only a bronze incense burner.

When the Jurchen invaded the capital, they coveted gold and silk. Daoist clergy were thoroughly searched, and those found with contraband faced imprisonment. Only Yuandao, known to possess nothing, was left unquestioned. By nature, he disdained Buddhism. After the Jurchen violated the realm, some turned to Buddhism in desperation. When asked, "His Majesty so revered the Dao—why has this befallen us?" Yuandao replied, "Emperor Wu of Liang offered himself as a slave to the monks and melted weapons into Daoist implements, yet he could not escape the siege of Hou Jing. Was that also the result of serving the Buddha?" The questioner bowed in assent and withdrew.

Later, Yuandao withdrew from public life. Occasionally, he was seen among the people.

Dong Nanyun, Daoist Record
Dong Nanyun, styled Xuanming, was of lofty and pure Daoist practice, revered by his disciples. A year before the Jurchen breached the capital, he suddenly declared, “I dreamed of immortal youths presenting a yellow writ to summon me as Master of Yanfeng.” The following day, he ascended without illness, having lived over seventy years, yet his countenance remained as that of a man in his forties or fifties.

Daoist Wang Bingwen
Wang Bingwen, styled Yanheng, was registered at Mount Lu’s Taiping Xingguo Abbey. After attaining the Dao, he traveled to the capital. At the time, the court was constructing the Shenxiao Wanshou Abbey, where he was granted purple robes and appointed Master of Ceremonies. Suddenly, a fangshi arrived and, seeing a *Zhouyi* on his desk, cast milfoil stalks and declared, “This place shall face military calamity. You are not fated to remain—best avoid it.” He then imparted the essentials of “preserving the Three and guarding the One,” along with the secrets of the Yellow Emperor and Bian Que. Wang resigned his post and returned to the mountains. In the fourth year of Emperor Gaozong’s Jianyan reign, the abbey was destroyed by rebel forces. The following year, after the bandits retreated, those who admired his sense of duty urged him to take charge. Wang thus assumed a deputy role amid the ashes. After several years of effort, the abbey’s halls and images gleamed anew in gold and azure.

He then resigned from his duties at the abbey and secluded himself at home for over thirty years, naming his residence the Hall of Three-in-One and thus styling himself Master of the Three-in-One. Daily he studied the Daoist Canon, mastered esoteric formulas, and devoted himself to medicine, with no other pursuits. On the night of the Lantern Festival in the second year of Emperor Xiaozong’s Qiandao reign, he dreamed of a divine being who declared: “The Celestial Emperor has commanded you to preside over the Great Flushing Grotto of Mount Hua. He bestows upon you a grain of Returning-Soul Elixir to restore your spirit and replenish your primordial qi. The officials of the Divine Radiance and White Horse Bureaus shall escort you into the grotto.” With these words, he awoke.

The next morning, he told his disciples: “The mortal world is no longer a place to dwell—I shall depart.” He then took the fourteen fascicles of *Collected Manifestations of Sagely Cures*, the *Divine Resolutions of the Perfected Lord of the Western Marchmount*, the *Complete Pulse Classic*, and the *Secret Formulas of the Purple Court for Audience with the Dipper*, and entrusted them to his grand-disciple Qin Zhixiang and others. On the first day of the second month, he bathed, changed his robes, and passed away in perfect serenity. The prefect of the prefecture, Kang Fuwen, composed a eulogy in his honor, recording the events of Taiping Xingguo Abbey.

Liu Lie
Daoist Liu Lie, styled Master of the Hollow Valley, was born after his mother dreamed an extraordinary dream. As he grew, his talents surpassed the ordinary. He studied at Taiping Xingguo Abbey on Mount Lu, keeping his associations pure. Nobles and high officials marveled at his countenance, which bore the unspoiled air of high antiquity, and declared him destined for the Dao.

In the sixth year of the Shaoxing reign of Emperor Gaozong of the Song, he built a thatched hermitage and named it "True Unity." Each day, he sat upright, poring over the Daoist Canon, classics, and histories, committing all to memory at a glance. Scholars and officials sought his acquaintance. Master Zhu Xi of the Huian School discussed the *Book of Changes* with him and expounded on the principles of returning elixir, later leaving this poem:

*I have read the hundred chapters on returning elixir,*
*The master’s brush, too, speaks at length.*
*The primal mechanism lies hidden in the classics,*
*Yet the highest truth resides in the blink of an eye.*
*If the two horses truly serve as my charioteers,*
*The five sprouts will naturally grow in my garden.*
*Tomorrow, riding a crane, I shall ascend the mountain—*
*With whom then shall I discuss these matters?*

Zhang Xiaoxiang, upon their first meeting, presented him with a poem:

*Within the blessed land lies a small grotto-heaven,*
*Where immortals refine their spirits in seclusion.*
*Only the Hollow Valley knows its joy,*
*For the fire-timing of the* Cantong qi *is wondrously natural.*

Ministers of state such as Luo Dian, Wang Yan of the Ministry of Personnel, the two eminent officials Feng Xi and Feng Yi, and Vice Minister Yue of the Ministry of Rites all visited to discuss the *Book of Changes*, exchanging verses and poetic replies.

In the first year of the Longxing reign of Emperor Xiaozong, he annotated the *Correct Classic of the Zhou Changes* and compiled the *Comprehensive Essentials of the Six Ren*. Journeying to the capital to present these works, he was granted an imperial audience, questioned on the Dao, and honored with a banquet. Later, he dwelt in the mountains for a decade. In the ninth year of the Qiandao reign, in the sixth month, he abstained from food for over forty days, drinking only fragrant water. On the fourteenth day of the seventh month, he personally delivered twenty-five fascicles of *Secret Instructions for Ascending to Perfection* and nine fascicles of *Upper Scriptures* to the abbey’s archivist. The following day, on the Zhongyuan Festival, he left a poem in his own hand, which read in part:

*The Hollow Valley Master now seeks to shed his form and leave the world,*
*To sweep aside worldly dust and hasten to the boundless realm of mist and clouds,*
*Where he shall merge with the Dao in profound unity.*

On the sixteenth night, he walked under the moon to the summit of Green Ox Grotto on Mount Lu, sat upright, and passed away. His works include *A Hundred Chapters on Returning Elixir*, miscellaneous poems and essays, *Exegesis on the Book of Changes*, and *Essential Diagrams of Successive Dynasties’ Rulers and Ministers*, all of which circulated in the world.

Lan Qiao
Lan Qiao, styled Zisheng, was a native of Longchuan in Xunzhou. His mother, née Chen, had no sons until she prayed at Mount Luofu and conceived. When her time came, she dreamed of immortals’ cranes alighting at her home, and that very night gave birth to Qiao amid a radiant glow in the room. At twelve, he could already compose poetry. A physiognomist told Chen, “Your son has extraordinary bones. If he pursues an official career, he will rise to the rank of general or minister; if he cultivates the Dao, he will become an immortal.” Qiao replied, “General or minister is not worth aspiring to—what I desire is to ascend lightly.”

From then on, he sought out Daoist texts to read, but lamented the lack of companions in study. Taking leave of his mother, he traveled to the Jiang-Huai region and reached the capital. After seven years, he returned and said to his mother, “Your son is by nature a wanderer of rivers and lakes. If I have returned, it is only out of concern for you.” From his gourd, he produced a single elixir and offered it to her, saying, “Take this, and you will live long without illness.” After staying for over a year, he set out again, leaving several catties of gold for his mother with the words, “This was refined through the breath of true qi. Treasure and use it, for I shall not return.”

Wu Ziye of Chaozhou encountered him in the capital. On a sweltering day, they climbed the Bian Bridge to buy melons. Qiao said, “The dust defiles my melon—let us gaze at it from the water.” With that, he leapt into the river. Wu leaned over the moonlit water to watch, and from time to time melon rinds floated to the surface, intact. By nightfall, Qiao had not emerged. Wu went to his lodging to check, only to find him sound asleep, snoring like thunder. Slowly opening his eyes, Qiao said, “I waited for you in the waves to eat melon. Why did you take so long?” Wu then realized Qiao had attained the Dao. Bowing in shame and gratitude, he became his disciple and attended to his needs.

Later, Qiao wandered to Luoyang, clad in a patched robe. Whenever he entered a tavern, he would drink several *dou* of wine. He could place a hundred sheets of paper beneath his feet and have people pull them out one by one without tearing a single one—so light was his body. He told others, “I am an immortal from Mount Luofu. From here, I shall ascend to heaven.”

One day, while selling medicine outside the city, he again placed paper beneath his feet and bade onlookers take it. When the last sheet was drawn, his feet rose into the air. Amid swirling winds and gathering clouds, he ascended. Cranes in formation flew from the south, and as he rose, they vanished from sight. The sound of pipes and flutes lingered in the air, and he was heard reciting a poem by Li Taibai:

*Gazing down, I see the Master is beyond reach,*
*Craning my neck, I yearn for him in vain, my heart broken.*

His mother lived to ninety-seven before passing away. On the day of her burial, woodcutters and herders heard weeping at her grave. Those who understood knew of his comings and goings.

Prefect Zheng of Yingzhou wrote his biography.

Shen Donglao

In Wuxing’s Donglin, there lived a man named Shen Donglao, famed for brewing the Eight Immortals’ White Wine. One day, a guest calling himself the Returning Daoist arrived at his gate with a deep bow, saying: “I have heard your white wine has just matured, and have come from afar to visit. I beg for a taste to quench my thirst.” It was the nineteenth day of the eighth month in the first year of Emperor Shenzong of Song’s Xining reign.

Donglao, seeing the guest’s refined bearing and noble spirit, rose at once to greet him. Observing his jade-green eyes, which gleamed with light, he conversed with him and found his voice clear and resonant. The Returning Daoist spoke with mastery of the rise and fall of dynasties, the principles of Laozi and Zhuangzi, and the teachings of Buddhism, leaving no doubt he was no ordinary mortal. Donglao brought out over ten wine vessels and, at the feast, said: “I have heard you are a skilled drinker. I wish to offer the first toast with the tripod vessel—what say you?” The Daoist replied: “Among drinking vessels, the bell and tripod are largest, followed by the gourd cup and conch shell, while the pear-blossom and banana-leaf cups are smallest. Bid your attendants pour in order, from smallest to largest, and I shall drink accordingly.” He laughed and added: “Like Gu Kaizhi eating sugarcane, I shall enter ever finer realms.” He further agreed that once the cycle was complete, they would begin anew, ever changing vessels, keeping his cup perpetually full. “Thus,” he smiled, “the wine in my cup shall never be empty.” He drained each cup as soon as it was set before him, and they took turns toasting one another.

The Daoist then asked Donglao to play the zither, and he sang in harmony with the melody. They also played weiqi for amusement, but after only a few moves, the Daoist swept the pieces away, laughing: “I fear the game would end only when the axe handle rots.” From noon until dusk, the Daoist drank several *dou* of wine without showing any signs of intoxication.

That evening, the moon was faint, the autumn heat lingered, and mosquitoes still swarmed. As attendants held candles to drive them away, one flame was accidentally extinguished. The Daoist then took a bamboo branch, dipped it in the leftover wine, and planted it in a distant wall. In an instant, all the mosquitoes flocked to the spot, leaving the drinking area entirely free of them. Donglao, eager to learn, asked to be taught the method of driving away mosquitoes. The Daoist replied: “Drink first. Such minor arts are hardly worth mentioning.” He then said: “I have heard you possess the arts of alchemy but have never misused them. You are also deeply filial and righteous, and have performed many hidden good deeds. This is why I have sought you out today—to awaken you to greater things.”

Donglao then inquired about the methods of attaining longevity and lightness of body. The Daoist replied: “This body, composed of the four great elements, cannot suddenly depart from its form. The greatest matters are life and death, departure and abiding. If you know where death abides, your spirit will be born there.” Donglao adjusted his robes and rose to thank him for his instruction. The Daoist said: “This is what the ancients called the highest and most ultimate state.” He added: “Five years from now, we shall meet again. On that day, you will depart this world. However, your deepest attachment is to your son, Shen Jie, whom you will not see at the moment of your passing. When that time comes, you will know it in advance. Be careful not to let your thoughts waver, lest you lose your true nature.” Donglao nodded in understanding.

They drank until dawn, by which time the wine in the jars had turned to mere dregs, with not a drop left to drink. The Daoist said: “I have not lingered in Zhejiang for a long time. Today, I came for your sake and shall leave a poem as a parting gift.” He tore the skin of a pomegranate from the table, wrote on the hut’s wall with it, and the characters, pale yellow at first, gradually darkened. The poem read:

*The western neighbor, though rich, is never satisfied;*
*Donglao, though poor, finds joy in abundance.*
*He brews white wine to welcome good guests,*
*And scatters gold to collect books.*

Then, bidding Donglao farewell, he opened the gate to see him off. As dawn broke, they walked hand in hand, laughing and making plans to meet again in the future. At the stone bridge west of the house—now called the Returning Immortal Bridge—the Daoist crossed first, riding the wind away, vanishing without a trace.

Four years later, on the evening of the Mid-Autumn Festival, Donglao fell slightly ill. He gathered his clansmen and told them: “The Returning Daoist once said to me on this day four years ago: ‘Five years from now, we shall meet again, and on that day, you will depart.’ I thought he meant next year, but this is the fifth year of Xining. Shen Jie is also away in the capital seeking an official post. The Daoist’s words must refer to today.” When the appointed day arrived, he passed away. All that the Daoist had foretold came to pass. Today, in Huzhou, there stands the Returning Immortal Temple, where his traces remain.

In the fourth year of the reign, Cai Yuanchang, having just passed the imperial examinations, served as a patrol officer in Qiantang. One evening, as he rested at an inn in Tang Village, a Daoist of imposing stature sought an audience. Cai, who had always enjoyed meeting masters of the esoteric arts, hastily welcomed him and conversed over wine before the Daoist departed. The next night, Cai lodged elsewhere and saw the Daoist again. The following evening, as he moored at Xin Village, the Daoist reappeared. They drank several *dou* of wine, and the Daoist earnestly requested: “I cannot return tonight. May I stay here?” Cai initially refused, but after repeated pleas, he reluctantly agreed. They shared a bed, with Cai on the outer side and the Daoist within. The Daoist warned: “If anyone comes searching for me in the middle of the night, do not tell them I am here.”

Cai suspected the Daoist was a fugitive criminal, and that officers might come to arrest him. As a patrol officer, it would be improper to harbor him, yet he had no choice. He tossed and turned until the third watch, unable to sleep. Then, he heard voices outside the inn. Soon, the crowd grew louder, and they forced the door open.

They demanded: “Chariot Four is here—how did he get in?” One exclaimed in fury, “I’ll seize him from the bed!” Another cautioned: “If we harm the man outside as well, the Emperor will surely be enraged. We may incur punishment.” Cai, seized with terror, sat up and called to his attendants, but not one answered. The Daoist slept soundly, unmoved even when shaken. Outside, someone muttered: “He’s slipped past us again for sixty years—how strange, how strange!” After much murmuring, a sound arose from within the room like the rustling of tens of thousands of bamboo papers being peeled. Then, all fell silent.

Only then did Cai’s attendants respond. When asked what they had seen, none knew anything. The Daoist rose calmly and bowed in thanks: “I am Chariot Four. Thanks to you, I have escaped this great peril and may live another sixty years—this was my third deliverance. From now on, I have nothing to fear. You are destined for the highest ranks of mortal office, and that is how I evaded capture. Had it been otherwise, we would both have perished.” He added, “I have no way to repay you. I possess an elixir that can transmute copper, iron, bronze, and silver. Would you like it?” Cai refused, but the Daoist pressed a lump of dried mercury into his hand, saying: “Use this in times of dire need.” As dawn approached, he took his leave and was never seen again.

Cai later recounted the tale to his second son, Xiu. After Cai’s death, Xiu fled with his family to Guangxi, where the elixir sustained them. Cai’s guest, Chen Bing, who once served as prefect of Xiang Commandery, also knew the full story.

Zhang Jing
Zhang Yu, styled Yinzhi, was a native of Chengdu. From childhood, he stood apart from others, his genius surpassing all. In the intervals of his scholarly pursuits, he delved deeply into the subtleties of the *Yi*.

While annotating the *Canon of Supreme Mystery* up to its ninth scroll, Zhang Yu suddenly dozed off in broad daylight and dreamed of Yang Xiong, who said: “The *Supreme Mystery* is like a floating pagoda—thirteen scrolls in all. You have annotated but nine; how can the celestial mechanism be so easily divulged?” Yu awoke, deeply unsettled by the strangeness of it.

Later, he briefly completed the tenth scroll and presented it to Emperor Shenzong of Song, who, delighted, offered him a noble title. Yu declined, and was instead enfeoffed as the Recluse of Serene Retreat. He was on close terms with Shao Yong, styled Kangjie.

Once, while traveling to Jinyan Bridge in Guanghan, he encountered a boy of twelve reciting poetry. Delighted, Yu took him home, renamed him Jing Tong, and often studied the *Scripture of the Yellow Court*. Each time he finished reading, the boy would secretly peer at the text.

One day, a youth in blue robes arrived bearing a letter. Yu accepted it, but the messenger vanished. On the envelope was written: “From Zhenyi Zi, a commoner of the Southern Marchmount, to the Recluse of Serene Retreat in the Western Prefecture.” Inside was but a single poem:

*Unfulfilled, the mountain’s chant,
Yet worldly echoes reach my ear.
Laughter and speech lose their true sense,
Dust and filth defile the spirit’s robe.
Return to plant southern land’s mushrooms,
Transmute northern Qi’s gold bright.
A thousand days of diligent toil—
Jade groves arise of their own right.*

Later, while wandering by West Stream, Yu happened to lift his foot, and an extraordinary man, Li Shining, came to visit. Yu hastily said: “My foot was washed in West Stream’s flowing waters.” Li instantly replied: “My hand holds the poem sent from the Southern Marchmount.” Yu, startled, laughed and asked: “How did you know?” Li answered: “I have known for some time.” Before leaving, Li said: “I go ahead to the Southern Marchmount; you should come soon.” Thereafter, Li was never seen again.

One day, Jing Tong announced his departure. Yu asked: “Where do you go?” The boy replied: “I go ahead to the Southern Marchmount to await you, Master.” Yu asked: “How do you know?” The boy answered: “I have known for some time.” A month after the boy sat down and vanished, Yu bid farewell to his acquaintances and achieved liberation through the corpse.

Yu had once refined an elixir, and after ingesting it, his form dissolved like a cicada’s molting shell. To this day, he is occasionally seen on the Southern Marchmount.

Duan Guyan composed an elegy, of which a fragment reads:

*Liberation through the corpse—hard to trace,
A golden crucible left in empty space.
The great hermit of the West is gone,
The Lesser Star of the Northern Dipper dims its place.*

Zhang Xianliang also wrote a poem:

*From the Western Sea, a name of might,
Or so they say—discarded age, a cicada’s flight.
On Green City, immortals’ bonds were tied,
Yet suddenly the hermit’s star sank from the sky.
The golden crucible forged true mercury’s art,
The Jade Hall passed on the* Canon of Supreme Mystery’s *part.
A kindred spirit in life, my debt runs deep—
Ashamed, my talent fails to carve his stele.*

In the fourth year of the Xining reign of Emperor Shenzong of the Song, the xin-hai year, a military officer named Li □, serving as the Hengzhou Pacification Commissioner, ventured deep into Mount Jiuyi. The path became impassable, so he dismounted and took lodging in a villager’s home. Gazing ahead, he saw a column of azure mist rising straight into the sky from a distant ridge. Pointing, he asked the villagers what it was, but none could say.

Li marked the spot and later told Li Yanyang, a scholar who had long struggled in the imperial examinations and harbored a fondness for the strange. Yanyang, drawn to the arts of immortality through the teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, was delighted by the news. He packed provisions and set out with Li. Scaling the verdant slopes, they suddenly came upon a level stretch where several thatched cottages stood. Entering, they found an old man seated in quiet repose. Startled, he asked, “How did you come here? This place is beyond mortal reach.”

“We came seeking the Dao,” Yanyang replied.

The old man smiled, gestured for them to sit, and inquired after their names. “I am a man of the late Tang,” he said, “who fled the world to dwell here. My surname is Xing, but I no longer wish my given name to be known.” Yanyang suspected he might be Xing Hepu, but the old man shook his head. He then asked about the current dynasty, unaware that it was now the Song, and even the emperor’s name. Yanyang recounted the lineage of the Xining reign, and the old man nodded in acknowledgment.

When Yanyang pressed him about the place, the old man remained silent. Returning with more supplies, Yanyang visited again. The old man welcomed him warmly and kept him for five days, teaching him only the arts of breath regulation and qi refinement. When weary of speech, he would take up his zither and play, filling the hall with the roar of thunder and crashing waves, the echoes lingering without end.

From then on, Yanyang returned repeatedly, and the old man received him as an old friend, no longer questioning his visits. Yanyang began to inquire about deeper matters, but the old man replied, “These secrets are not easily spoken. I am reviewing celestial records, and there is a set time for this work. Your visits disrupt my tasks—do not come again. I, too, will soon depart this place.”

Glancing at the books, Yanyang asked, “Even immortals use such things?” The old man replied, “Is there an immortal who does not know writing? These are all transcribed from the Jade Chambers, assigned by those who strike the registers of destiny. Once used, they are returned and reissued.”

At last, they parted, and the old man presented Yanyang with twelve poems. Two are recorded here:

*Silent, leaning on the armrest, shoulders relaxed as pines,
A mind of ten thousand ages, solitary and divine.
At times, three scrolls of seal script spread like contracts,
A single hairpin star stirs when the cap is donned anew.
The Azure Lad departs to urge the trees of Southern Mountain,
The rustic guest seeks the scriptures of the Northern Emperor.
The Dao of Heaven needs no peering through the window—
The mountains at the gate stand green, a sight to behold.*

*Worldly achievements and fame are not worth debate,
Best to enter the Gate of Truth while still young.
Like Zhuangzi’s butterfly, all is but a dream,
Yet you are a descendant of the Historian of a thousand years.
Distinguish inner and outer in the* Yellow Court*,
Do not entrust the secrets of* Zhouyi *to the* Qian *and* Kun *trigrams.
When in future years the hills and valleys shift,
I shall still dwell in Penglai—my home remains.*

The seal script was ancient, and Yanyang could not decipher it. He never returned again. It took him eighteen years to fully unravel the characters.

Yanyang attained some mastery of the Dao and now wanders between Xiang and Heng, unknown to others. Wang Xingzhi wrote *A Record of Immortal Xing*.

The Daoist Jia Shanxiang, styled Hongju, was a native of Pengzhou. Skilled in conversation and fond of the zither and wine, he blended seamlessly with the world while silently pursuing cultivation. Su Dongpo once visited him and presented a verse:

*Body like the plantain,
Heart like the lotus,
A hundred joints unobstructed,
Ten thousand apertures luminous.
Coming as one,
Departing as eighty-four thousand.*

The closing lines read: “Hongju’s reply.”

Jia Shanxiang replied: “This old Daoist has no such elaborate reckonings.”

During the reign of Emperor Zhezong of the Song, Shanxiang composed *Records of the Dragon’s Leisure* and *Biographies of Eminent Daoists*, which circulated in the world. One day, at the Supreme Clarity Palace in Bozhou, a gathering requested him to lecture on the *Supreme Cavernous Numinous Treasure Scripture for the Salvation of Humanity*. After expounding the scripture twice, the blind regained their sight. Among the assembly was an old woman, over seventy years of age, who had lost her vision for thirty years—upon hearing the scripture’s meaning, her sight was suddenly restored. Later, on the eve of the ritual offering, she dreamed of a host of divine officials transmitting the Supreme Lord’s decree, bestowing upon her immortal robes and appointing Shanxiang as the master of the Supreme Clarity Palace. Several days afterward, she ascended in transcendence. Zhang Shangying composed *A Record of True Wanderings*, compiling these events.

**Zhou Shiqing**
Zhou Shiqing was a native of Pucheng in Jianzhou. In the early Yuanyou era of Emperor Zhezong of the Song, he journeyed to the capital to sit for the provincial examinations. En route, he encountered a Daoist who spoke at length, whereupon he took his disciple into Youguo Mountain to refine the elixir. His reputation spread far and wide, and scholar-officials passing beneath the mountain never failed to visit him. When Lü Jifu was transferred from Jian’an to Xuanzhou, he suffered from a foot ailment that rendered him unable to walk and came to pay his respects to Zhou.

Zhou invited Lü to extend his leg forward, then directed his qi upon it while having others fan the area. After a short while, Lü’s foot ailment flared with searing heat that rose to his heart, but before long the pain subsided. Zhou remained on the mountain for twenty years, and his elixir neared completion. One evening, a violent storm erupted with thunderous lightning. At dawn, when he inspected the alchemical furnace, the elixir was gone. Unprepared for this, Zhou projected his spirit in search of it, telling his wife: “I must depart briefly. I shall return in seven days—do not presume I am dead and burn my body.” His wife followed his instructions.

Zhou had long been close with a monk who had built a hut on another mountain. Hearing of Zhou’s death, the monk came to offer condolences and strongly urged his wife, saying: “Those who cultivate the Dao regard the body as no more than dung and dirt. Since he is gone, why cling to it?” The wife, believing the monk’s words, wept as she burned the body. The next day, Zhou returned—only to find no form left to reanimate. From the void, he rebuked his wife sharply before departing.

Some time later, the monk returned. When the wife recounted what had happened, he said: “I had just received news of his passing and came for that reason. I was not here the other day.” Then they realized it had been a demon in disguise. Later, Zhou’s family placed his portrait in the monk’s abbey, where a daily attendant tended the incense and invariably found four coins on the ground. Zhou also left behind a vat of vinegar that never spoiled, even after a long time.

**Liu Datou**

Secretary Mi, passing through Xu Yi’s vegetarian feast, was a man of Qin. During the Shaosheng era of Emperor Zhe of the Song, he traveled to the capital for an official posting. Passing through Luozhong, it was bitterly cold, and a beggar stood by the roadside. Moved by compassion, Mi searched his basket and found three hundred coins, which he gave to the beggar in full. The beggar did not thank him at first, but after walking some dozen paces, he turned back and called out from behind Mi’s horse: “I am grateful to you, sir, for your kindness in saving my life. When you reach the capital one day, I hope you will visit the home of Liu Datou in Bamboo Register Lane.” Mi agreed.

Upon arriving in the capital, he had forgotten the earlier words. One day, while visiting a relative, he passed through a narrow alley. Asking those nearby, he was told, “This is Bamboo Register Lane.” Then Mi recalled the beggar’s words. He knocked on the door and called for Liu Datou three times. Datou came out to greet him, saying, “You are a man of honor, sir, to visit this humble old man.” He bowed and seated Mi in a small pavilion, then called his wife to come out and greet him. She bowed and said, “Had I not met you, sir, the other day, I would have become a starving brick.” He promptly ordered wine to be prepared, though the tray held only a few large peaches. After three rounds of drinking, Mi took his leave.

The beggar said, “I am poor and lowly and have nothing to offer, but I wish to present you with these peaches.” Mi tucked them into his sleeve and departed. Upon returning to his lodging, he felt them grow increasingly heavy, until he could no longer bear the weight.

He examined them and found they were all pure gold. When he returned to the place, the dwelling was empty.

**Scroll Fifty-Two of the Comprehensive Mirror of True Immortals Who Embodied the Dao Through the Ages**

**Liu Hun Kang**

Liu Hun Kang, styled Zhitong, was a native of Jinling. None of his ancestors had ever served as officials. His mother, née Zhu, dreamed on the evening of the second day of the twelfth month of the second year of Jingyou of the reign of Emperor Renzong of the Song—a night when Lord Mao descended—that a feathered immortal entered her chamber. Upon waking, she gave birth to Hun Kang.

At the age of thirteen, he apprenticed under Taoist priest Tang Hanxiang of the Taihe Abbey in his home prefecture. In the fifth year of Jiayou, he passed the scriptural examination and became a Daoist priest. Shedding worldly concerns, he delved into Daoist texts day and night, attaining a profound understanding of the esoteric principles of the *Dongjing* scriptures.

Distressed by the lack of enlightened masters in the world, he let his hair loose and ascended the altar, taking Heaven as his ultimate guide. Later, he heard that Taoist Mao Fengrou of the Three Mao Mountains had partially mastered the Dao of the Wondrous Lord Zhu, so he went to study under him. Mao, struck by his exceptional qualities at first sight, transmitted to him the entire corpus of the *Great Cavern Scriptures*.

He then built a hut on Jijin Peak to reside in. One day, a feathered immortal visited his dwelling and, pointing to the eastern corner of the hut, said to him, “Dwell here, embrace the spirit and guard the center, and let your virtue and kindness extend to others. Then you shall be without shame before those who came before you.” Turning to Hun Kang’s forehead, he asked, “This is a place of non-action, the very essence of the Dao, and must not bear any blemish.” He pressed his hand upon it, and by the next day, the scar had vanished.

From then on, Hun Kang diligently practiced deeds that benefited others, and his reputation was revered far and wide. During the reign of Emperor Zhezong, he was summoned to the capital and granted the name Yuanfu Abbey for his residence. When Emperor Huizong ascended the throne, he was called to court. *The Comprehensive Mirror of Events in the Imperial Court* records: “Hun Kang was a man of integrity, deeply respected by Emperor Shenzong, and thus the emperor held him in high regard.”

In the second year of the *Mingdao* era, he requested to return to the mountains. In the seventh month, an edict was issued in response to a memorial by Master Zhu Ziying of the Wondrous Observation, granting him the title of Jade-Carved Immortal of the Nine Elders of the Celestial Capital and bestowing upon him the honorific *Baozhen Guanmiao Xiansheng* (Master of Preserved Perfection and Wondrous Observation). In the seventh month of the fifth year, his title was elevated to *Baozhen Guanmiao Chonghe Xiansheng* (Master of Preserved Perfection, Wondrous Observation, and Harmonious Emptiness).

In the second year of *Daguan*, he, along with Taoist priest Xu Shenxi of Taizhou and Celestial Master Zhang Xujing, convened at the Shangqing Chuxiang Palace, where each was granted a Daoist abbey to reside in. Soon after, he shed his mortal form. In the fifth month, he was posthumously conferred the title of *Grand Master of the Palace with Gold Seal and Purple Ribbon*.

The beginnings and endings of his extraordinary life are fully recorded on his grand stele.

Wang Quan, styled Zizhen, was a native of Yangping in Fengxiang. His father had passed the imperial examinations, and all his brothers became *jinshi*; only Quan delighted in seclusion and the Dao. One day, while walking in the countryside, he rested in a melon patch. A peasant woman approached to beg for melons, her breasts swelling to her belly. Quan knew she was no ordinary person and asked her surname. She replied, “I am Xiao Sanniang.” Quan took melons, placed them in her basket, and gave them to her. As she ate, she offered him the remainder, asking, “May you taste them?” Quan accepted and ate without hesitation. The woman said, “You are teachable. The Divine Immortal Haichanzi now resides here and will initiate worthy disciples. Tomorrow, I shall take you to meet him.”

Upon meeting Haichan, the master said, “You have encountered me by virtue of your past karmic affinity.” He commanded Quan to kneel for a long while, transmitted the supreme Dao, bestowed the elixir formula, and admonished him to accumulate merit and virtuous deeds. Quan then returned home to inform his mother and sent his wife away. He wandered through famous mountains. At one time, high ministers recommended his worthiness, and he was granted the title *Chongxu Recluse*.

In the third year of *Yuanfu* during the reign of Emperor Zhezong of Song, he traveled again to Mount Mao. Earlier, a stone cavern on Central Peak had suddenly opened—the so-called Convenient Gate of Huayang Grotto-Heaven mentioned in the *Zhen’gao*—which had remained sealed for a thousand years. Moreover, sweet dew had repeatedly descended. The Daoist priest Liu Hunkang said, “An extraordinary person must be coming.” Soon after, Quan arrived and received the *Shangqing Register*. That night, celestial music was heard floating in the air. He stayed for over a year. One day, he dreamed of two heavenly beings and hundreds of yellow-robed messengers riding white tigers to welcome him. Mounting a tiger, he traversed perilous heights and entered the stone cavern through the Convenient Gate that had opened earlier. Looking around, he saw golden courts and jade halls. Two azure-clad youths entered to announce his arrival to Lord Mao. He bowed twice in audience. The Lord asked, “You have been greatly labored.” Quan replied, “The Emperor has already appointed you as Vice-Director of the Huayang Grotto-Heaven’s Office of Destiny.” Thereupon, he was urged to return with a golden exhortation.

Upon awakening, he bid farewell to Hunkang, saying, “My allotted years are nearly spent, and I have received what I was meant to. From here, I depart.” He then addressed the Daoist monk Ge Chong, saying, “I dare to burden you with my passing.” He foretold that on the seventeenth day of the eighth month, he would shed his mortal form. When the day arrived, he donned his robes and cap, sat upright, and passed away. This occurred in the *Jianzhong Jingguo* era of Emperor Huizong’s reign, at the age of sixty-one.

Xu Shouxin, the Divine Elder, was a native of Hailing.

He served as a laborer at the Temple of Heavenly Celebration, clad in tattered robes and dragging hempen sandals, sometimes walking barefoot. Throughout the day, he did nothing but hold vigil, sprinkle water, and sweep, all while reciting the *Scripture of Salvation for the Multitudes* without cease.

A Daoist named Xu Yuanji arrived from elsewhere, afflicted with a severe and repulsive case of leprosy. The others loathed him and banished him to a thatched hut behind the temple. The Divine Elder alone attended to him. When Xu Yuanji later died, the Divine Elder begged for coins to prepare his funeral. Afterward, he returned to the thatched hut and wept for three days. Emerging, he feigned madness, and gradually, strange occurrences began to manifest. The people revered him as divine, calling him the Divine Elder, and only then did they realize he had attained the Dao from the leprous Daoist.

When the temple ran out of food, the Divine Elder said, “I shall seek provisions for you.” He entered the main hall, lay down for a long while, then emerged and told the assembled Daoists, “It is coming.” Soon after, those bearing rice on their shoulders arrived in such numbers that they jostled one another.

When someone offered silver as an offering, the Divine Elder placed it on his bed. A thief, learning of its absence, broke in through the unlocked door, only to see the Divine Elder sitting upright on the bed with a stern countenance. The thief fled in terror. From then on, people from all directions came to inquire about disasters and omens.

Lü Huici, styled Jifu, was traveling to the capital after observing mourning rites when he took a detour to visit the Divine Elder. The Divine Elder fled in alarm, but Jifu pursued him. The Divine Elder turned and said, “Guard well, guard well.” Jifu bowed and departed. Upon returning to court, he was soon demoted to Prefect of Shanzhou due to some affair.

Jiang Zhiqi, styled Yingshu, was overseeing the transport of grain in Jianghuai when he proposed digging a canal for shipping. Fearing the presence of impassable stone, he hesitated, uncertain of what to do, and sought the Divine Elder’s counsel. The Divine Elder, seeing him approach, called out, “Dig if you must—what sort of man are you?” Yingshu marveled and said, “A remarkable man indeed.” The canal was subsequently dug as planned.

When Emperor Zhezong fell ill, he dispatched Zhefu to offer incense. The Divine Elder inscribed a talisman, which Jifu presented to the court. Shortly afterward, Emperor Huizong ascended the throne.

In the early *Chongning* era, the court summoned him, but he refused to go. They forcibly carried him to the Eastern Capital, yet he could not be detained. Thus, they reverently sent him back, and in Hailing, they built the Xianyuan Wanshou Palace for him to reside in. At the end of the *Daguan* era, he departed through *shijie*.

**Zhang Runzi**
Zhang Runzi’s origins are unknown.

Zhang Runzi often wandered among the peaks of Mount Song, where he worked for various Daoist abbeys yet refused to accept even a single coin in payment. He wore straw sandals and patched robes, unchanged through winter’s cold and summer’s heat. When he spoke to others, he would say, “The human body must be nourished and moistened.” People failed to grasp his meaning and simply called him “Runzi.” If pressed to explain, he would respond with nonsense, his words beyond comprehension. A poem attributed to him circulates in the world:

At Qi’s ford, I delved to find the great Dao’s root,
Emaciated in form yet steadfast in will, silent and dim.
Gentle rain drifts along Kunlun’s path,
Mighty winds roar at the gates of the vast sea.
Sun and moon’s qi mingles, warming the golden crucible,
Heaven and earth’s trigrams stir, the jade furnace stays warm.
This principle must be refined in life,
Lest you, like the common folk, debate it only after death.

After some time, he left to work for the Li family of Xinzheng in Zhengzhou. In the third year of the *Chongning* era of Emperor Huizong of Song, he took leave of the Li family, leaving behind a verse:

Diligent in study from the start,
Achievement comes with ease.
The body remains ever moist,
A hundred seas never run dry.
The Dao hides in primordial darkness,
Living on coarse fare, dwelling in humble huts.
When essence and merit are complete,
I return to my pure capital.

That day, he told his disciples, “The Jade Emperor has issued a decree—I ascend to heaven.” Soon after, above a great locust tree to the southeast of his dwelling, five-colored clouds gathered, and celestial music resounded. Runzi rode the clouds away.

**Wang Ji**
Wang Ji was an old soldier from Shanzhou.

In the scorching heat of midsummer, he would often sit exposed to the blazing sun, and in the depths of winter, he would submerge himself in stream waters, only his head visible—so the people of the region often praised him as one possessing the Dao. In the early years of the *Chongning* era of Emperor Huizong of Song, when Wanqi Xu’s father served as prefect of Shanzhou, Ji happened to visit Xu. Xu invited him into the library and offered him wine. When the wine was finished, Ji took up a brush from the desk and wrote out an efficacious prescription, requiring only one or two ingredients, yet capable of curing even the most intractable illnesses.

Xu was still young at the time and did not hold him in high regard, casually discarding the prescription. One day, Ji came to Xu and said, “Your lordship has repeatedly harmed your spleen and stomach with rich food and wine, and thus fallen ill. I shall teach you a massage technique, but take care not to reveal my words.” Soon after, he suddenly told Xu, “I shall be leaving.” The next day, he passed away, and some prepared his body for burial.

Several months later, he was seen in a neighboring prefecture. When his grave was opened upon his return, only the shoes he had worn remained. From that year onward, Xu lived to nearly seventy, his cheeks like peach blossoms, his appetite ever increasing. Even when he drank heavily until midnight, the method Ji had taught him proved effective. Only then did Xu regret that in his youth he had failed to recognize this extraordinary man and seek to learn from him the secrets of longevity and enduring vision. What Xu had received, not even his elder brother—who later became a *Canzhizhengshi*—was permitted to know.

**Zhu Dabo**

Zhu Dabo—his origins unknown—once served as a laborer in the household of Gui Anshi of Guixi in Xinzhou. Outwardly, he appeared dull-witted, yet he performed his duties with utmost care. One day, he returned from outside with unusual bearing and declared, “Just now, a Daoist gave me medicine, and now I no longer need to eat.” Anshi tested him, and it proved true. From then on, whether beneath the scorching summer sun or lying upon winter ice, he continued his labor as before. The Gui family began to hold him in higher regard and wished to treat him as a guest, but Dabo declined, saying, “I shall remain a laborer here; when the year is complete, I will depart.”

Years later, in the third year of the *Daguan* era of Emperor Huizong of Song, he suddenly told Anshi, “At White Flower Crag, some ten *li* from here, someone has summoned me. Would the master accompany me?” Anshi followed him at once. Before they arrived, the sound of flutes and strings filled the air, and crimson clouds densely shrouded the mountain. Anshi was still gazing in astonishment when Dabo took his leave. Before his words were finished, he had vanished.

Liu Yi

Liu Yi was a native of Lantian in Jingzhao. For sixty years, he dwelt in reclusion at Zizhi Hermitage, his skin like jade and his countenance robust. He could drink several *dou* of wine without losing composure, ascending steep peaks and descending perilous slopes as though treading level ground. In the early years of the *Xuanhe* era of the Song, word of him reached the capital, and Emperor Huizong dispatched envoys to summon him. It was a time of torrential autumn rains, the mud so deep it swallowed the ankles; yet Yi walked on foot while the mounted envoys could not keep pace. Upon arriving at the Eastern Capital, Huizong received him with great courtesy, though Yi found no pleasure in it and earnestly sought to return to the mountains. He often stayed at the monastic retreat of Huayan Creek. At the end of the *Xuanhe* era, he said to his disciples, “Why do the mountains, rivers, grasses, and trees reek so foully? I loathe it.” Then he departed through *shijie*. When they prepared to bury him, his body was like a cast-off cicada shell. Later, when war erupted, his disciples finally marveled at his words.

Wei Erweng and Wei Erxi were hereditary farmers of Leize in Puzhou. The village elders had known them since childhood, yet their appearance remained as that of men over seventy. Clad in a single hempen robe, a palm-leaf fan in hand, they walked with the aid of a staff.

They had never studied writing, yet their pupils gleamed like stars, and they could inscribe characters as fine as fly heads. From time to time, they spoke to others of fortune and misfortune, and the villagers came to hold them in some reverence. One midwinter, someone presented the two elders with unrefined cloth. A thief, having learned of this, came to their dwelling at nightfall. The two elders called out his name in greeting: “Do you seek our instruction?” Then they tossed him the cloth. The thief, astonished, bowed twice in apology and departed.

Earlier, in Youcheng, there had been an old man named Wang Laozhi. Huizong once dreamed of him and summoned him to the Eastern Capital that very day. Soon after, the emperor heard of the two elders and dispatched envoys to bring them to court. The envoys found their hut but heard only the thunderous snoring of the two elders—no trace of their forms could be seen. Fearing they could not fulfill their mission, the envoys pleaded urgently. The two elders were indeed in their hut, yet when pressed to depart, they vanished without a trace. The envoys could not bring them to court and returned with only a single ode. Its words read:

Now I enter the mountains,
to escape this clamor and vexation.
Guarded by petty clerks,
courted by high officials—
how could they exchange for my joy,
the pure leisure beyond the world?
Nurturing the true, preserving *qi*,
seven reversals, nine returns.
The golden elixir complete,
I ascend the immortal’s altar.
Vermilion towers of Penglai,
jade gates and golden barriers.
Whoever would learn from me—
the cloud-path is no hardship.

At the beginning of the *Xuanhe* era, they suddenly departed through *shijie*. The villagers gathered to bury them, but when they lifted the coffin, it felt empty. Opening it, they found only a poem hidden at the head, which read:

Beware the fire-field’s heart-master,
lest caution slip once the path is complete.
To guard Kan and Li is the subtlest art;
pursuing fame and profit brings only torment.
If you grasp the method of Crimson Clouds,
the road leads to the Purple Palace’s immortals.

Master Wang Laozhi bore the surname Wang and the given name Laozhi, a native of Linquan in Pu Prefecture. He once encountered the Perfected Master Zhongli, who transmitted to him the essential oral instructions of internal alchemy, and thus became renowned for his mastery of the Daoist arts.

In Yizhou, an official sought to serve at his side and sent a trusted acquaintance to convey his intent. The Master responded with a poem:

*A man long retired, old and worn,*
*has planted mulberry and hemp by the hundred.*
*All were twisted into being by the tip of a brush—*
*on every branch, a wronged soul clings.*

He resolutely refused to receive the man.

In Pu, a scholar of glib tongue sought to confound him with words and went to visit. The Master’s dwelling was encircled by high embankments, with only a dog’s door for entry and exit. The scholar crawled through and began to speak at length. Suddenly, he noticed a whirlpool forming on the ground, which swiftly grew to several feet across, revealing scales within as large as a bushel. The Master said to the scholar, “Go home at once—any delay will bring you extraordinary misfortune.” The scholar hastily departed, but before he had traveled five *li*, thunder, lightning, and hail erupted violently. His horse crouched motionless, so he took shelter in an earthen chamber. Gazing toward the Master’s thatched hut, he prostrated himself a hundred times and begged for his life, narrowly escaping harm.

In the ninth month of the third year of the *Zhenghe* era of Emperor Huizong of Song, an imperial edict commanded the prefectures and counties to urgently dispatch him to the capital. There, he was bestowed the title *Master of Penetrating Mystery*. In the first month of the fourth year, his title was expanded to *Perfected Master of Observing the Subtle, Illuminating the True, and Penetrating Mystery*.

Though the Master spurned official emoluments, he would at times deliver forthright admonitions to the Son of Heaven. One day, Emperor Huizong summoned him into the inner palace, where Empress Xiansu was also present. The Master abruptly produced a sheet of paper and declared, “In days to come, Your Majesty and the Empress will both face calamity. I shall depart in death and will not live to see it. I possess the *Mirror of Heaven and Earth* method, which may be used to avert misfortune through supplication. Yet you must also cultivate virtue—only then can Heaven’s will be turned.”

The Master instructed, “Cast the *Mirror of Heaven and Earth* according to my method, and suspend each with five-colored tassels above your bedchambers. After my death, whenever you sit beneath the mirror, recall my words. Day by day, reflect on how to dissolve misfortune before it takes shape.” The Emperor assented to his proposal.

A decree was issued to halt all artisans’ work, and once the mirrors were completed, they were presented to the throne. The Master then returned to Puyang, where he passed away. The *Comprehensive Mirror of the August Dynasty: Record of Events* states: “In the tenth month of the fourth year of Xuanhe, on the day *xinsi*, *Perfected Master of Observing the Subtle, Illuminating the True, and Penetrating Mystery* Wang Laozhi died. The court bestowed gold for his burial and posthumously honored him as *Grand Master for Proper Consultation*.” The *Record of Xuanhe* adds: “Wherever the Master dwelled, flowers would bloom upon the earth, called ‘earth brocade.’ During the Jingkang disaster wrought by the northern tribes, the two palaces treasured and clung to the mirrors, sighing over his foresight and how he had guided the sovereign onto the right path.”

**Li Sigong**
Li Sigong, styled Jingyuan, was a native of Jishui in Luling. In his youth, he entered the Kai Ming Abbey to study, later passing the scriptural examinations and donning the cap and robe of a Daoist adept. His aspirations and conduct were extraordinary. Often, he would wander freely among mountains and rivers, exchanging any money he earned for wine, sometimes drinking alone in the marketplace. Though he lived past seventy, his appearance showed no signs of aging. He rarely spoke to others, and none knew what practices he had cultivated.

In the fourth year of Zhenghe under Emperor Huizong, he roamed to Luochuan, often lodging at a wineshop by Xixi Bridge. An elderly woman there found him most unusual and would offer him wine to drink, never asking whether he had paid or not. This continued for years without fail. One day, he suddenly told her, “I must soon depart. I thank you for your generous care and shall leave a letter in return.” He drank again, becoming drunk, and spent the night at the inn. The next morning, when others arose and looked upon him, he had already departed in transformation. His body remained warm as if alive, and a fragrant scent filled the room. Word spread, and his kin were hastily summoned to enshroud and bury him in the garden behind the inn.

A month later, a traveler arrived from Mount Heng, saying that on the road he had chanced upon Jingyuan. Even the woodcutters recognized him, for he wore the same robes and cap as before. He entrusted the traveler with a letter to thank the wine-seller and his family. Later, when his kin gathered to open the tomb and coffin, they found no corpse within—only a bamboo staff tied with a silk cord.

**Rongyang**
Rongyang, a native of Dongping, often ground ink in the marketplace, where people called him “Second Master.” Later, he traveled to Shu and arrived at Meixian County. There, he accompanied a prefectural official to ascend the King Yue Tower. That night, a roof tile fell, and Second Master said, “A defeated ghost did this.” The official asked the guards, who replied, “When the tower was repaired some time ago, a carpenter fell to his death.” The official was greatly astonished.

Soon after, Second Master addressed Prefect Zhao, saying, “You should leave at once, or disaster will befall you.” The following year, the southern barbarians breached the frontier defenses and invaded Shu. All below the prefect were punished.

In the early years of Xuanhe under Emperor Huizong, a decree was issued to seek extraordinary individuals. The regional inspector reported Rongyang’s name, and the court ordered him to travel by post carriage to the Eastern Capital. Second Master said, “The times are as they are. What more can I do?”

The regional inspector pressed him, and unable to refuse, he set out on the journey. Upon arrival, Emperor Huizong inquired about his learning, but he gave no answer. The emperor then bestowed upon him one hundred thousand coins and sent him home. Second Master returned to Shu, living in seclusion without eating, drinking only wine from time to time. Once, while drinking with Ma Qian, a student from Chengdu, at a tavern, he raised his sleeve as if summoning something. Moments later, coins emerged from his sleeve, filling the table, before vanishing. Counting them, the sum matched exactly the cost of the wine. When he encountered the sick, he would take a wooden branch about a foot long, breathe upon it, and place it on the afflicted area. Soon after, he would retrieve it, cast it to the ground, and trample it—or sometimes discard it entirely—and the patient would invariably recover. Some, however, suffered from eye pain and cried out. Second Master would say, “I have shared my vision with you.” He would then open his eyes wide and instruct the sufferer to gaze into them. As Second Master’s gaze fixed upon them, they could scarcely see, and their pain would subside.

One day, he brought Zheng Zicheng’s ink to the home of Liu Changyuan’s father. When Liu’s father ground it, it turned into gleaming gold. Liu later said, “I have known Second Master for forty years, and he has always had the vigor of youth, never aging. He often spoke of affairs from the Sui, Tang, and Five Dynasties eras.” Some said, “Second Master was skilled in the arts of *moving essence and transforming qi*.”

During the Shaoxing reign of Emperor Gaozong, Rong Yi entered Shu as *Commissioner of Tea and Horses* and remarked, “Second Master was the elder brother of my great-grandfather.” Thus, he was five generations his senior. It was also said, “When the transport commissioner of Yidu was slandered, Second Master followed him. At that time, he was already over a hundred and twenty years old, residing in Small Hemp Creek on Mount Qingcheng.” He passed away during the Shaoxing era. His lifespan spanned many decades.

Wang Shujian, styled Zhidao, was a native of She in Huizhou. In the eighteenth year of the Shaoxing reign of Emperor Gaozong of the Song, he served as Vice Minister of the Court of Agriculture and was appointed Commissioner of Finance for Hubei. Once, he attended a banquet hosted by the general Tian Shizhong. Arriving last, he found the transport commissioner and the prefect of E already seated, playing chess with a Daoist known as Master Ri Mu, who was also present. Upon seeing Wang, the Daoist bowed and said, “It has been long since we last met—are you in good health?” Wang, startled, replied, “We have never met before—why do you speak of a long separation?” The Daoist said, “You have now become a man of high rank and have forgotten. Do you not recall the inn on the road to Xuanzhou, where we spoke of Niu Qizhang’s affairs?” Wang suddenly rose and bowed in acknowledgment. The Daoist then departed. Wang turned to the other guests and said, “In the fifth year of Chongning during the reign of Emperor Huizong, I passed the imperial examinations and was appointed as an instructor in Xuanzhou. In the winter, I traveled alone to assume my post and lodged at a small village inn, where there was only one room, already occupied by a scholar. As night had fallen and I could not proceed further, I had no choice but to push open the door and enter. I said, ‘I have arrived at dusk and must share this room with you—would that be acceptable?’”

The scholar was squatting by the fire when he turned and said, “Very well.” After a long while, he suddenly asked, “Have you ever read the *Old Book of Tang*?” I replied with irritation, “Though my learning is meager, how could I be so ignorant?” He then smiled and said, “Do you recall the biography of Niu Sengru?” Finding his words incoherent, I grew angry and refused to answer. The scholar said, “My words are not idle—you are the reincarnation of Sengru. In your past life, you were the Military Commissioner of Wuchang, and as your allotted span was not yet exhausted, you are destined to return in this life. In the future, your official rank and emoluments will largely be in those lands.”

I found this extraordinary and suspected he was a physiognomist. When I asked his name, he replied slowly, “Do you know of one called Yong Xiaowen?” I am he. Since being rejected at the palace examination in the early years of Chongning, I have wandered among mountains and forests, having encountered something by chance. When I pressed him on his arts, he refused to speak, and we spent the night facing each other, discussing only the Great Dao. At dawn, he departed, and I never saw him again. People in Shu all said he had died, but upon seeing the Daoist’s appearance today, I realize it was Master Yong. His bearing was no different from forty years ago—truly a man who had attained the Dao.” All the guests at the table were astonished.

Later, Wang served as Transport Commissioner of Hubei, then as Prefect of Ezhou, and as Intendant, spending many years in Wuchang. Mu Sheng, styled Guangmo, often traveled between the He and Mian rivers, speaking to others only of literature and calligraphy, never of other matters, so none knew him as an extraordinary man. Shen Jun, styled Daoyuan, also knew him and said, “During the Zhenghe era, when a Daoist preached before the emperor, the emperor remarked that he had attained half the mastery of Lin Lingsu, hence his surname Mu.”

Huangfu Huan, styled Zhiyuan, was a native of Kaifeng. By nature, he was serene and indifferent, possessing keen insight and remarkable vision. In his leisure from examination studies, he was especially skilled in the Three Mysteries. Knowing his fate, he did not seek office and instead became a Daoist adept. He studied at the Taiyi Palace in the eastern capital, his conduct upright yet enigmatic.

In the first year of the Zhenghe era of Emperor Huizong, when the court promoted Daoist learning, the master turned toward the Dao. The following year, he took the examination at the Imperial Academy and placed first. The emperor read his essay and appointed him Golden Altar Gentleman, but he declined and requested the title of “Free and Unfettered Gentleman.” Donning rustic attire, he traveled to Xiluo, where he met the perfected one, Feng Yeren, and obtained the essentials of the Dao. Later, he journeyed to Mount Heng and resided at the Lingxu Terrace of the Huizhen Abbey. Before long, he was summoned to court and lived in the Hermits’ Lodge of the Taiyi Palace. Later, he requested to return to the mountains and passed away in meditation by the Ru River.

The Fennel Daoist
In the final years of the Zhenghe era, Lin Lingsu lectured at the Baolu Palace, drawing thousands of Daoist and lay followers, all cupping their cheeks in reverence. Only one Daoist stood before him with glaring eyes. Lin, surprised by his lack of bowing, rebuked him, “What abilities do you possess?” The Daoist replied, “None.” Lin said, “If you have no abilities, why are you here?”

The Daoist replied, “If you possess all abilities, why then are you here?”

At that time, Emperor Huizong was listening from behind the curtain. Intrigued, he summoned the Daoist and asked what abilities he truly possessed. The Daoist answered, “Your servant can nurture and grow all things.” The emperor immediately ordered his attendants to fetch seeds from the Daoist abbey, and they returned with a handful of fennel seeds, which were handed to the Daoist. Two imperial guards were assigned to oversee him as he planted them at the foot of Genyue, and he was kept under watch in the abbey overnight. By the third watch, he had vanished without a trace. The next morning, the fennel was found to have flourished into a lush thicket.

Zou Baoguang
Zou Baoguang, in his youth, was registered as a Daoist at the Chongxu Abbey on Mount Luofu. During the Xuanhe era of Emperor Huizong’s reign, his fame reached the imperial court, and he was summoned to the Ningshen Hall to demonstrate his arts. Seven Daoists accompanied him, then suddenly disappeared. When the emperor asked who they were, Baoguang replied, “Your servant dwells in the mountains practicing swordsmanship—these seven were ancient pines.” The emperor, astonished, appointed him Gentleman of Jintan.

Gong Yuanzheng
Gong Yuanzheng, styled Duanben, was a native of Wuling. Though poor, he loved learning, studying classics even while tilling the fields. Later, he became a Daoist, his nature simple and sincere, his devotion to the Dao wholehearted. He oversaw the construction of a grand abbey hall, with towering pavilions, expansive halls, and layered corridors, their gold and azure hues gleaming. With his own hands, he planted tens of thousands of pines and cedars.

When the abbey was completed, the emperor bestowed upon it the plaque "Wanshou" and granted Gong the title "Master Chongyi." He presided over the abbey for forty years, never once taking a meal apart from the community. One day, he summoned his disciples and said, “Within five days, I shall depart.” On the fourth day, he sat upright and recited the *Daodejing* of Laozi. As dawn broke, he passed away with solemn composure, during the Xuanhe era of Emperor Huizong of the Song.

Shen Ruoji
Shen Ruoji, a native of Lin’an, built a thatched hut on Maoshan, dedicating himself to dispensing medicine. During the Xuanhe era of Emperor Huizong of the Song, he was summoned to court and granted the title "Master Dongyuan." Once, he pointed to a vacant plot east of Huayang Cave and said, “When I die, bury me here.” His disciples protested, citing the low and damp terrain, but he paid no heed. When he passed away in the fifteenth year of the Shaoxing era of Emperor Gaozong, his disciples followed his instructions and dug six feet into the ground, uncovering a stone slab inscribed with six characters: “Shen Gong’s seat and sword lie here.” Those who witnessed it marveled.

Zhang Dan
Xu Fengyuan of Quzhou resided on Xiashan in the prefecture. In his youth, he enjoyed the company of those beyond the mundane world. A Daoist named Zhang Dan passed by and was invited to stay at his gate. Zhang’s attire was simple—only a dark green cloth jacket—with nothing beneath his Daoist robe, even in the depths of winter. On moonlit nights, he would take his iron flute into the mountains and play until dawn. Xu Fengyuan studied the *Yijing* and once shut himself away to calculate the *Dayan* numbers but could not grasp the method. Zhang called to him from the next room, “Young scholar, this is not something you can comprehend. Tomorrow, I will explain it to you.” The next day, Zhang taught him the steps of the *guituo* and other methods, through which the life and death, timing, and the rise and fall of all things—from utensils and plants to birds and beasts—could be determined. Xu tested these methods, and they proved unfailingly accurate.

Zhang was fond of wine and often spent entire days drinking in the marketplace, returning only when thoroughly drunk, though his purse was always empty. People said he could transmute *gen* to sustain himself. Xu wished to gauge his capacity and summoned four skilled drinkers to take turns drinking with him. From dawn to dusk, all were drunk, yet Zhang remained unaffected. That night, he entered his room, and from outside, Xu saw him lying beneath the wall, his feet propped against it, his unbound hair hanging into a tile basin, with wine dripping from his temples. Xu’s grandfather, Xu Dequan, was over seventy. Zhang said, “Elder, next May you will face a great calamity. Hurry and use my method to avert it, and you may extend your life by ten years.” The Xu family did not believe him, thinking the Daoist merely sought to frighten them with his words, and so they ignored him. The moment the words left their lips, Zhang knew and immediately departed, entering Luohan Temple in the city.

The following May, Dequan fell ill, and only then did Xu seek Zhang’s aid, but he refused to come. Soon after, Dequan died.

Zhang had a disciple, a mendicant monk, to whom he secretly entrusted a painted scroll of an ox. Whenever he amused himself with guests, he would say, “Hang this picture on the wall, and soon grass will sprout beside it. After a long while, the ox may eat it all, or leave half uneaten, scattering dung upon the ground—ready to be swept away.”

Later, he gave the ox scroll to the mendicant and instructed him to purchase forty-nine *jin* of hemp, twisting it into a thick rope. He charged him, saying, “When I die, do not encoffin me. Wrap me from shoulder to foot with this rope, dig a pit in the empty ground behind the temple, and bury me in a flaming pyre. After seven days, open it once to check.” The mendicant faithfully followed his command. On the seventh day, when they opened the pit, Zhang’s face glowed like fresh cinnabar. By the forty-ninth day, they had opened it seven times, finding only the hemp rope and a pair of worn shoes—his body had vanished.

Xu once presented him with a poem:
*“The iron flute loves fire, wind, and moonlit nights,
A single robe defies the snow and frost.
If you ask how many years I’ve wandered,
I’ll laugh and point to pines and bamboos—not yet steadfast.”*
Zhang inscribed it in large characters on a bolt of silk, his brushwork bold and striking. He also wrote out the method for refining mercury on another bolt of silk and gave it to Xu. After Xu’s death, many in the village sought his written methods, but his son, Menggen, unwilling to disclose them, gathered and burned them all.

**Zhang Gong**
Zhang Gong of Bian was an unsuccessful imperial examination candidate. His family was very poor, but his mother’s clan, the Gongs, had long practiced medicine, so he too was skilled in prescriptions. He set up an apothecary shop behind the Yichun Gate, though his remedies sold poorly.

One morning, as he dressed, combed his hair, and washed his face, he saw a Daoist approaching with the rising sun, his gaze piercing and unblinking. The Daoist strode directly into the shop, glanced around, and without a bow, shook out his robes and sat upon the dais.

Zhang grew quite indignant at the Daoist’s arrogance and, his face darkening, demanded his origin. The Daoist replied, “Ask not whence I come—my purpose is simply to see you.” Zhang thought him a madman, of which the capital had no shortage. He tossed a coin at him and waved him away. The Daoist laughed and said, “I seek nothing from others. I came to instruct you because you possess the makings of a Dao adept. Why reject me so harshly?”

Zhang, suddenly enlightened, hurriedly donned his cap and sash and stepped out to speak with him. When the conversation turned to matters of the immortals, the Daoist expounded with such profound subtlety that Zhang heard what he had never heard before. Filled with shame and remorse, he said, “I am a vulgar man, my eyes clouded and my heart deluded. Since you, Immortal Sir, have deigned to visit me, I beg you to teach me to the end.”

The Daoist asked, “What do you seek?”
Zhang replied, “My family is poor, and we often go without congee. If I could be sated without eating, that would be my worldly wish.”

Just then, a vendor arrived with steamed jujubes. The Daoist took the coin Zhang had earlier thrown, bought seven of them, and said, “The immortals do not approve of avoiding grain altogether, but abstaining from grains eliminates dross and turbidity. Without dross and turbidity, there is no leakage, and from this, one may enter the Dao. Zhang Zifang and others relied on elixirs to stave off hunger—how misguided they were! If you desire this Way, can you henceforth refrain from lust? One who does not indulge in lust finds worldly desires naturally stilled. When worldly desires are stilled, one possesses the talent of an immortal.”

He then took the seven jujubes, gazed at them intently, and breathed upon them, saying, “Eat these, and you may go without food for life. If others compel you to eat, there is no prohibition. Should you later wish to abstain again, do as before. However, you have an aged mother, a wife, and children—you cannot yet follow me. Yet since you have eaten these seven jujubes, you shall have seven dreams, as I foretell. When you have fulfilled your filial duties and seen your children married, and if you can still abstain from food, what more will you seek? Then you should leave the world behind and seek a famous mountain. Find a stone cavern deep and wide enough to contain you, and seal its entrance with piled stones. Let no thoughts arise; sit, walk, or stand within it, and you will discover wondrous delights. In half a dozen years, your body will shed its shell like a cicada, and you will roam freely beyond the Six Directions. Beyond that, I cannot speak to you today.”

With these words, he gathered his robes and rose. Zhang pressed him to stay, but the Daoist refused. He stepped out the door, and when Zhang looked again, he was nowhere to be seen. Zhang then realized he was no ordinary man and remained disconsolate for months. He found the smell of food nauseating and soon ceased eating altogether. After two years, he passed neither stool nor urine, yet his spirit was clear and bright, his steps light and swift. He often tested his strength, walking from dawn to dusk around the outskirts of the capital five times—covering several hundred *li*. The seven dreams he experienced unfolded exactly as the Daoist had foretold.

His mother had suffered from hemorrhoids for twenty years, and no medicine had cured her. Zhang gave her the remaining pits of the seven jujubes, and she recovered in a single night. Having renounced intimacy, he regarded his wife as a stranger. His wife, née Guo, was of a stern disposition; her resentment and distress led to her death. His family grew increasingly anxious and suspicious, urging him to eat, but the food he took would only turn and come back up. Sometimes he ate, sometimes he did not. Friends who doubted his sincerity locked him in a room to test him, yet he felt no hardship. When summoned by physicians, he would bring medicine and go, but upon arrival, he would sit beside the patient’s bed, remaining for ten days or even a month without so much as a sip of water or a grain of rice. He delighted in drinking and composing poetry, and though he reached sixty, his complexion remained that of a young man.

After his mother’s death, his whereabouts became unknown. Li Fangshu wrote this account. Li Jian annotated.

In Jinan there lived a man named Li Yuan, styled Dingguo, who resided in the barracks of Lin’an Prefecture. He supported himself by gathering students for instruction, and in his leisure, he roamed freely among the lakes and mountains. Once, he visited the present-day Temple of Mercy. Passing over the Long Bridge, he lost his way along a bamboo-lined path and came upon a Daoist in blue robes playing a carved zither beneath the trees. Yuan bowed to him, and the Daoist asked where he was going. "I am on my way to the Temple of Contending Mercy to pay homage to the Five Hundred Arhats," he replied. The Daoist said, "There is no need to go just yet. Come, share a meal with me." He then roasted some pine nuts and ate them; they were most delicious. Suddenly, wind and rain darkened the sky, and the Daoist vanished without a trace. Yuan, alarmed and fearful, crouched among the trees. After a short while, the rain ceased, and he found his way out. Upon reaching the temple gate, he felt his body light and his spirit unburdened, his steps as swift as if he were flying. Returning home, he no longer consumed food or drink.

His elder cousin, named Mo and styled Dayou, served as a tutor in the palace of a prince. When Dayou was about to depart for his post, he sent a servant to deliver a letter. The servant saw that Yuan’s complexion was like peach blossoms and that he had attained the ability to fast. He relayed this to Dayou. By the time Dayou arrived, however, Yuan had already left, wandering to Mount Mao. Later, it was heard that he had entered Shu and concealed himself on Mount Qingcheng. Dayou, then serving as Transport Commissioner of the Zizhou Circuit, dispatched someone to Mei Prefecture to inquire after him. The prefect of Mei replied in a letter that several years earlier, Yuan had ascended lightly upon the clouds and departed, leaving behind only a painted likeness.

Jiang Fengzi was originally a resident of Shaoyang. By nature, he was simple and forthright, speaking without restraint. He paid no heed to worldly affairs, and if he noticed even a minor flaw in someone, regardless of their status, he would confront them directly.

Wandering to Mount Heng, he saw the precipitous Central Ridge and, on impulse, began to cultivate it, though none knew where he took lodging or sustenance. One day, a woodcutter suddenly appeared—his head wrapped in a blue kerchief, firewood upon his back—who offered him alms, saying, "After a thousand hardships, one still cannot secure enough to eat. Take this single pill; swallow it, and your strength will suffice." From then on, he drank only water. He cast off all clothing, heedless of cold or heat, and the people called him "Fengzi." Roaming the lakes and rivers of Hunan, he often lay sprawled across the roads, and though men of power and rank could not bend him, nor poison harm him, nor tigers and wolves injure him, he would mutter to himself, leaving others unable to fathom his meaning.

**Mo the Daoist**
Mo the Daoist was a native of Rongzhou who dwelled in Stone Grotto. He entered the mountains, and none knew how many years he had spent there; when asked, he himself would not speak of his age. Elders in the foothills, some eighty or ninety years old, recalled seeing him in his prime when they were young, yet his appearance—his face, beard, and temples—remained unchanged. His vigor was robust, and he scaled mountains as swiftly as if flying. He drank when drink was offered, ate when food was given, yet at times fasted for days, undeterred by cold or heat. Alone in his thatched hut, with no attendant by his side, he would often sit through the night upon the rocky ledge of Flying Cloud Peak. Tigers would linger nearby, and he did not drive them away; they would depart only at dawn. When high officials and nobles traveled to the mountains seeking him, they rarely found him. Many left poems for him, and he was still alive as late as the final years of Emperor Lizong of Song.

*Concluding Record of Perfected Immortals Through the Ages Who Embodied the Dao, Volume 52*
*Perfected Immortals Through the Ages Who Embodied the Dao, Volume 53*

Master Lin Lingjiang, surnamed Lin, originally named Lingjiang, styled Tongsou, was a native of Yongjia in Wenzhou. His family was poor and of humble station. One night, his mother, returning home, felt a red cloud envelop her body and thus conceived. After twenty-four months of pregnancy, one evening she dreamed of sunlight entering the chamber. A divine being clad in a green robe and jade belt, with eyes radiating sunlight, held a brush and announced: "Tomorrow, I shall borrow this dwelling." The following day, dark clouds gathered on all sides, and three claps of thunder resounded—Master Lin was born. Golden light filled the room, and his appearance was extraordinary. At the age of five, he remained silent. On the fifth day of the fifth month, a great storm arose, and a Daoist wearing a green jade crown and a cloud-patterned robe entered unannounced. Seeing the Master, he rejoiced and said: "Long have I not beheld you; I have come especially to pay my respects." They gazed at each other, clapped their hands, and laughed heartily as the Daoist departed. The Master pursued him in vain, but from that moment, he could speak. His words were well-founded, free of childish prattle. At seven, he studied books, composed poetry with some skill, and memorized ten thousand characters a day. When Su Dongpo Shì came to visit and presented him with an almanac to read, the Master perused it once without error. Dongpo marveled and said: "Your intelligence surpasses mine; wealth and rank await you." The Master smiled and replied: "My aspirations differ from yours." Dongpo asked: "What are your aims?" The Master said: "To be enfeoffed as a marquis in life and have a temple erected after death is not true nobility. A marquis’s title is but an empty name, and temple offerings do not elevate one beyond the realm of lesser spirits. My wish is to become a divine immortal—that is my ambition."

By the time he neared thirty, the Master had mastered the Confucian and Daoist classics. His aspirations turned to purity and emptiness, and his discourse was lofty, far removed from worldly concerns. Early on, while traveling in the western capital, he encountered a Daoist surnamed Zhao, with whom he associated for several years. One day, the Daoist suddenly said: "My allotted time draws near. I must take leave of you for now, but I entrust my later affairs to your care." Seven days later, he indeed died in a guesthouse, and the Master personally bathed and buried him. The Daoist left behind twenty-five strings of bronze coins, which the Master used in full, neither exceeding nor falling short. In the Daoist’s satchel were three volumes of books, their fine script like pearls, inscribed with celestial seal characters that no one could decipher. Divided into nineteen sections and wrapped in crimson silk, they bore the inscription: "Bestowed upon Lin." The title on the volumes read *Jade Writ of the Divine Empyrean Altar*. They contained methods of divine immortals’ transformations, incantations for summoning clouds and rain, talismans for driving away lesser spirits, and techniques for commanding the myriad spirits. At the end of the volumes was an account of twenty-five strings of coins, each item matching precisely. After receiving the *Jade Writ*, the Master’s spirit suddenly awakened. He perceived ghosts and gods, recited incantations and talismans, commanded thunder and lightning, and captured malevolent demons. He cured illnesses for others, and his efficacy was immediate. Whether dispelling plagues or subduing temple spirits, nothing he undertook failed.

The following year, the Master arrived at a wineshop in Yueyang and again saw the Daoist Zhao, who said: "I am Zhao Sheng, disciple of the Han Celestial Master. The *Five-Thunder Jade Writ* I once bestowed upon you must be practiced with care and not lightly disclosed. Today, the Lord of the Eastern Florescence, the Divine Empyrean Sovereign and Grand Thunder Judge, faces peril, and I must go to his aid." On the night of the Mid-Autumn Festival in the fifth year of Chongning, Emperor Huizong of Song dreamed of journeying to the Divine Empyrean Palace and attending the Jade Emperor’s court. He was summoned into a carriage with an escort of attendants, ascending through the void. As he neared the Gate of the Golden Palace, he saw immortal officials, jade lads, and armored warriors standing guard. Then, a figure in a star crown and ritual robe, holding a jade tablet, led the Emperor through the gate. Above it hung a vermilion plaque with golden characters: "Gate of the Divine Empyrean Jade Palace." To the west stood another gate, above which a plaque read: "Hall of Azure Radiance." The hall was bathed in golden light so dazzling it could not be gazed upon directly. Passing through a small courtyard with vermilion doors and golden studs, they came to the Jade Pivot Institute. Offices and bureaus were arrayed in order, and officials conducted themselves with solemnity. A crimson-robed clerk welcomed the Emperor and led him inside, bowing as he said: "This was once the Emperor’s former residence. Please be seated in the eastern seat and await a moment." Soon, a jade lad ushered the Emperor to an audience with the Jade Emperor. The Emperor prostrated himself twice in reverence, and from amidst the golden light, a decree was transmitted: "Rectify the state’s affairs, remove treacherous ministers, employ the loyal and worthy, and safeguard the ancestral altars." The Emperor bowed twice more, then withdrew to meet the crimson-robed clerk, who escorted him out of the Gate of the Golden Palace. Once more, a seven-jeweled chariot and attendants were provided, and the Emperor descended from the Heavenly Gate for over a hundred paces. There, he saw a Daoist in blue robes and a blue headscarf, riding a blue ox upward. His followers all had ghostly faces; two rock-bell ghosts with four eyes, wielding whips, led the way, while others bore swords and halberds, their procession solemn. Arriving before the imperial carriage, they cracked their whips and cried "Long live the Emperor!" The Emperor halted his carriage and inquired of the Daoist, who replied: "Today, I have had the fortune of beholding Your Majesty’s celestial countenance." With that, he rode his blue ox up through the Heavenly Gate. The Emperor awoke and recorded the dream.

In the second year of Daguan, the fourth month, an imperial edict sought Daoist masters throughout the realm. Master Liu Hun Kang of Mount Mao submitted a memorial, saying: "Your servant, in his foolishness, has nothing to offer that might satisfy Your Majesty’s wishes. Yet there is a divine immortal living in the world, Lin Lingjiang of Yongjia—why has the edict come so late?" The Emperor immediately dispatched envoys to seek him, but the Master declined to rise. By the sixth month of the sixth year of Zhenghe, the Emperor visited the Eastern Palace of the Great Unity. He instructed the Daoist Registrar Xu Zhichang to memorialize: "The Daoist Lin Lingjiang of Wenzhou is currently residing in a Daoist abbey. His appearance and speech are extraordinary, and he has repeatedly spoken of matters concerning the Divine Empyrean, though none can comprehend them. He once composed a *Song of the Divine Empyrean*, which he inscribed on the wall. I have transcribed it and now present it for Your Majesty’s perusal." Upon reading the text, filled with the wondrous words of immortals, the Emperor was greatly pleased and ordered Xu Zhichang to bring Lin Lingfu into his presence. The Emperor asked: "What arts and techniques do you possess?" The Master replied: "Your servant understands the affairs of Heaven above, the world of men in between, and the earthly realm below."

The Emperor gazed upon the Master, whose bearing and appearance seemed as if he had known him before. The Emperor asked: "Have you served in office before? Have we met in the past?" The Master replied: "On the Mid-Autumn Festival in years past, when I attended court before the Jade Emperor, I beheld Your Majesty’s celestial countenance and paid homage to your sagely presence." The Emperor said: "Now I recall—it was you who rode the blue-green ox. Where is the ox now?" The Master answered: "The blue-green ox is pastured in a foreign land, but it shall return before long." The Emperor marveled greatly and personally inscribed a new name for him, Ling Su, bestowing the title Master of Penetrating Reality and Attaining the Numinous. He was summoned to the palace at all hours to revise and compile Daoist histories, scriptural catalogs, and registers for the numinous altars.

The Emperor treated him as his teacher, specially constructing the Abbey of Penetrating Reality as his residence. He established the Abbey of Flourishing Treasures, built the Pavilion of Benevolent Relief, and distributed talismans and medicines. Next, he opened the Register Altar of the Divine Empyrean. When the Divine Empyrean Palace was completed, the Emperor led his ministers, including Cai Jing, to celebrate its inauguration. After the morning audience concluded, the Emperor led the hundred officials on a tour, declaring: "From the Five Gates of Proclaiming Virtue come the myriad states." Cai Jing and the others pondered deeply but could find no response. The Emperor turned to Lin and asked: "Can you complete the couplet?" The Master answered without hesitation: "The single prefecture of the Divine Empyrean governs all heavens." The Emperor was overjoyed.

The Master was commissioned to revise the *Yellow Register* and *Blue Offering* rituals, arrange the sacred ranks of the Three Realms, and collate the alchemical classics and philosophical texts. On the seventh day of each month, he ascended the teaching seat, while the Prince of Liang, imperial nobles, and civil and military officials gathered to hear him expound the *Three Caverns’ Daoist Scriptures*. At times, the Emperor himself would attend, seated below the dais.

From this time onward, the people of the Eastern Capital came to know the reverence of the Dao. As *The Comprehensive Mirror of the August Dynasty* records: In the seventh year of the Zhenghe era, the Daoist Lin Lingsu arrived in the capital. In the second month, the Emperor ascended the *Upper Clarity Treasure Lots Abbey* and commanded Master Lin Lingsu of Penetrating Reality to lecture on the *Daoist Scriptures* and the *Record of the Birth of the Jade Clarity Divine Empyrean King*. Thousands of cranes soared and cried out for a long while.

The Master compiled the *Nine Heavens’ Secret Writings*, inscribed in dragon scripts and phoenix seals, along with the *Nine Grades of Thunder Rites*, presenting them as the *Jade Chapters* to the throne. Formerly, the Celestial Master of Han possessed the *Divine Empyrean Thunder Writings* in twenty scrolls, along with six *Thunder Seals of the Celestial Department* bearing eight-angled thunder patterns. By the eighth-generation Celestial Master, only ten scrolls remained, along with the seal scripts of the six seals and the fire-traced seal script of the Jin era. At the founding of the dynasty, Zhang Shouzhen encountered the *Lan Saintly Perfected Lord*, who transmitted five scrolls to him.

The Emperor desired to obtain the complete *Thunder Writings* and *Golden Scriptures* to include in the *Daoist Canon*, but they could not be found. The Master, in a state of meditative flight, petitioned the *Jade Flower Heavenly Worthy* to report to the August Emperor, beseeching to view the thunder scripts and the seals of the *Thunder Bureau*. The Emperor dispatched the *Six Ding Jade Maidens* to bestow the seals upon him: one *Heavenly Altar Jade Seal*, one *Divine Empyrean Successor of the Teaching and Master Seal*, one *Director-General of Thunder Lords Seal*, and one *Celestial Department Thunder Bureau Seal*—all as hard as iron and stone, neither gold nor jade—along with five scrolls of the *Thunder Writings* for Lingsu to examine.

The Master bowed in gratitude, clasped the seals to his breast, and returned. He then submitted the *Thunder Writings* to the throne for presentation, thereby obtaining the complete collection.

In the seventh month of the seventh year of the Zhenghe era, the kingdom of Goryeo indeed presented a green ox to the capital, filling the Emperor with boundless joy. The hundred officials offered their congratulations, and the Emperor immediately bestowed upon the Master the honor of riding the beast into court. The Master thereupon composed a *Song of the Green Ox*, its opening lines reading: *"In the autumn of Zhenghe ding-you, with the west wind blowing, / The Son of Heaven bestowed upon me a ride on the green ox."* He presented the completed poem to the throne, and the Emperor was greatly pleased.

In the eighth month, the Master again compiled and submitted the *Record of the Bright Points of the Canonical Framework*, for which the Emperor rewarded him with funds for printing. In the first year of the Chonghe era, as the foundation for the *Hall of the Three Pure Ones* was being laid at Mount Hua, a massive stone casket was unearthed, containing a single volume of *Thunder Writings and Dharma Scripts*—inscribed on golden silkworm paper. When brought before the Emperor, it matched the *Thunder Writings* the Master had presented the previous year, not a single character differing. The Emperor exclaimed in delight, *"How divinely wise and sagely perceptive is Lingsu, to have memorized it so!"*

The Emperor then personally composed a *blue-green memorial* within the palace precincts, sealing it in secret for submission. The following day, he summoned the Master and inquired, *"You have claimed to know the affairs of Heaven—did my memorial of last night reach its destination?"* The Master replied, *"The memorial did not reach, for a single character was mistakenly written in green, and the *Divine Officials* intercepted it."* He recited the details of the submission, and the Emperor, patting the Master’s back, declared, *"Truly, you are a perceptive immortal!"* He then bestowed upon him the title *Master of the Jade Truth, Duke of the Divine Empyrean Palace, Lord Lin*.

Later, the Emperor sighed and said, *"I often wonder where the soul of the late Empress has gone. I have heard that in the time of Emperor Ming of Tang, Master Ye was able to summon the spirit of Yang the Supreme Perfection—could you do the same?"* The Master replied, *"I humbly accept Your Majesty’s decree."* That night, he performed the rites, sending forth talismans to summon her. His memorial reported: *"The Empress now resides in the *Jade Flower Palace*, feasting with the Queen Mother of the West. Upon hearing Your Majesty’s summons, she instantly mounted a green phoenix and arrived."*

After a time, an otherworldly fragrance filled the air, celestial blossoms rained down, and ethereal music resounded through the heavens—then the Empress appeared. The Emperor gazed upon her closely; she was no different from when she lived, save that her immortal robes and jade slippers differed from mortal attire. The Empress addressed the Emperor, saying, *"I was once a celestial official in charge of affairs, but at a gathering in the Divine Empyrean, I became enamored with the mortal realm and was punished, banished to the world of men. Now my karmic debt is repaid, and I have returned to my former post. Grateful for Your Majesty’s gracious summons, I hastened here upon receiving your command. I urge you to heed this warning: the coming bing-wu rebellion may yet be averted if you uphold the Great Dao, cast aside extravagance, employ the loyal and good, eradicate treacherous factions, cultivate virtue, and execute Tong and Cai. Otherwise, great disaster will befall you. I fear for Your Majesty’s future—if you persist in negligence, you will sink into ruin. Should you mend your ways, we may yet meet again in the Jade Palace."*

With that, she departed.

The Emperor asked, *"What was your position when you served among the immortals?"*
She replied, *"Your servant was the Yin Spirit of the Purple Void Primordial Sovereign, and Your Majesty is the Eastern Radiance Emperor-Lord."*

The Emperor said, *"None in the palace—neither my ministers nor my attendants—dared speak a word."*
She answered, *"Lady Mingjie is the Purple Void Mystic Numinous Lady; Empress Wang is the Flower-Offering Bodhisattva; the Crown Prince is the Venerable Arhat of Tortoise Mountain; Cai Jing is the Great Demon Chief of the Second Cavern of the Six Northern Hells; Tong Guan is the Flying Heaven Great Demon Mother; Master Lin is the Sovereign of the Divine Empyrean and concurrently the Grand Thunderclap Judge; and Xu Zhichang is the Giant Toad Spirit of the Eastern Sea."*

The Emperor then asked about the fate of his dynasty, but she remained silent for a long while before saying, *"Heaven’s decree is fixed. I dare not linger."* With that, she gradually faded from sight.

The Master had once accompanied the Emperor in spirit-flight to the Azure Flower Palace, ascending to the Moon Palace and traversing blessed grotto-heavens, visiting all without exception. Whenever he performed rituals or supplications, auspicious clouds and celestial cranes would gather. In times of drought, he would summon wind and thunder, calling forth clouds and rain. In the fifth month, he was bestowed the title *Master of Penetrating Truth and Attaining the Numinous, Wondrous Primordial One* and appointed Grand Master of the Palace with the rank of Attendant Minister. In the ninth month, he was specially granted the rank of True Official and exempted from routine inspections. In the tenth month, three days before the Heavenly Tranquility Festival, he conducted a grand longevity ritual and memorialized the throne to invite the Emperor’s presence. At the third watch, they beheld the Terrace of Luxuriant Mist, where the Celestial Worthy of the Dao and all the immortals descended in person to extend the Emperor’s lifespan. The Emperor, having purified himself with fasting and ablutions, observed the wondrous event alongside the Three Palaces, the Nine Ministers, and the imperial princes.

That night, the sky was cloudless, the moon bright, and the wind clear. First, celestial fragrance filled the air, and cranes soared above as five-colored clouds gathered and ascended. The sound of immortal music and the chime of jade pendants resounded. More than five *zhang* above the ground, within a radiant void, pavilions and palaces materialized, surrounded by celestial soldiers, jade maidens, and golden lads bearing banners and incense. At the center hung a jade plaque inscribed in golden script: *Terrace of Luxuriant Mist*. None present could see it save the Emperor and Zhang Xujing.

The Emperor offered incense and bowed twice, then summoned the Crown Prince to behold it. After a long while, the Crown Prince said, *"It is the Pagoda of the Great Sage of Sizhou."* The Emperor grew furious and ordered the eunuchs to drive him out, decreeing that the Crown Prince was no longer permitted to attend the Divine Empyrean rituals.

The Emperor said to the Master, *"The Crown Prince was once the Venerable Arhat of Tortoise Mountain—a sage. Why is he so ignorant of the Dao?"*
The Master replied, *"In his past life as an arhat, he upheld the precepts, endured humiliation, and cultivated patience. Though reborn as a nobleman, he retains filial piety but does not grasp the profound mysteries. I beg Your Majesty not to reproach the Crown Prince."*

In the eleventh month, the Master was appointed Attendant of the Harmonious Void Hall. In the twelfth month, he oversaw the construction of the Hall of the Protective Sage. The Emperor said, *"I wish to behold the true image of the Dark Warrior."*
The Master replied, *"Allow me to petition with Heavenly Master Xujing."*

They fasted in the hall overnight. At noon the next day, black clouds blotted out the sun, and a great thunderclap resounded as a flash of light revealed a colossal black tortoise and serpent filling the courtyard. The Emperor offered incense and bowed twice, praying, *"I humbly beseech the Perfected Lord of the Primordial to deign to descend and grant me the blessing of a glimpse of your true form."* With another thunderclap, the tortoise and serpent vanished, leaving only a single vast foot filling the courtyard. The Emperor again offered incense and bowed, saying, *"By the compassion of the Sagely Ancestor of the Mysterious Origin, who has deigned to descend, I would be overjoyed to behold even a fraction of your true form."*

In an instant, the deity manifested—a figure over a *zhang* tall, majestic and serene, with unbound hair, a black robe trailing to the ground, golden armor, voluminous sleeves, a jade belt, and a sword at his wrist. His feet were bare, a halo crowned his head, and ribbons fluttered about him. He stood for a long while, during which the Emperor was able to sketch his likeness. The court painters were then summoned to complete the portrait, but before they finished, the deity vanished. The next day, a ritual of thanksgiving was held.

Cai Jing memorialized, *"I fear the Perfected Lord does not easily descend among mortals. In the past, Emperor Taizong commanded Zhang Shouzhen to summon him, and a portrait was made, sealed in a casket and stored in the palace archives, unseen by any minister. I beg that it be retrieved for comparison to verify its authenticity."* The imperial decree was issued, and the Taizong-era seal remained intact. When opened, the portrait matched the current manifestation in every detail. The Emperor was overjoyed.

He then invited the Seven Perfected of the Northern Dipper and their two envoys, who descended upon a golden bridge. (Their appearance was not recorded in paintings.) The Emperor gazed upon and bowed to the Seven Perfected, who spoke from the Dipper, saying, *"Hasten to withdraw to safety. Do not indulge in extravagance. Exercise sagely judgment and do not let treacherous villains lead you to ruin."* With that, they ascended into the heavens.

That night, the Emperor was delighted and invited Xujing and the Master to a banquet. Afterward, they strolled beneath a pavilion in the palace, where they saw a stele inscribed *Stele of the Treacherous Faction of the Yuanyou Era*. The Master and Xujing read it, bowed their heads in reverence, and requested paper and brush to inscribe a poem:

*"Su and Huang no longer write as men of letters,
While Tong and Cai are hailed as pillars of the state.
For thirty years, no verdict has been settled—
Who, then, are the true traitors?"*

The next day, the Emperor showed the poem to Grand Preceptor Cai Jing. Cai was terrified, prostrating himself and begging to be dismissed, but the Emperor refused.

The Master had a chamber with windows on two sides, a door at the front, and a wall at the back—his place of retreat. Inside stood two chairs, and the room was always locked, forbidden to all. Even when the Emperor visited, he was not permitted entry. Cai Jing grew suspicious and sent the Eight Guards to spy on it. They reported seeing a yellow silk canopy, a dragon bed embroidered with gold, and crimson chairs and tables.

Cai memorialized, *"Master Lin harbors usurping ambitions. I beg Your Majesty to inspect the chamber personally; I will accompany you and point out the evidence. If my words prove false, I will accept death a myriad times over."*

The Emperor then visited the Master’s quarters. The Master received him with due ceremony, and the Emperor entered the chamber with Cai Jing. They unsealed the lock and opened the door, finding only whitewashed walls, bright windows, and two chairs—nothing else.

Cai Jing, trembling with fear, kowtowed and begged for forgiveness. The Master asked the reason, and the Emperor said, "Cai Jing deserves execution." The Master memorialized, pleading for clemency. Then, pointing to the wall in the chamber, he invited the Emperor to examine it closely. The Emperor scrutinized it and found a small talisman—a talisman of the Golden Tower and Jade Hall. Beneath it was depicted a yellow silk canopy, no larger than a coin, with fine characters inscribed above: *"Seat of the Heavenly Honored One."* The Master said, "This humble servant often invites the Jade Flower Heavenly Honored One to descend and sit here; how could I dare to usurp such a place?" The Emperor laughed and said, "You play your games well."

The Emperor then said, "I have heard that Emperor Wu of Han once summoned the Queen Mother of the West to descend and instruct him in the Dao. I wish to see the Queen Mother of the West—can you bring her here?" The Master replied, "I humbly accept Your Majesty’s command." He then burned a small talisman in the incense burner. After a moment, the Queen Mother descended with her jade maidens, riding upon clouds, appearing just as mortal women do. She sat facing the Emperor and, turning to the Master, asked, "What is the occasion today that merits such a special summons?" The Master replied, "The Son of Heaven reveres the Dao and wishes to meet the Primordial Lady."

The Emperor rose, took incense, and bowed twice. The Queen Mother said, "The Lord of Eastern Florescence excuses you from bowing." The Emperor said, "To behold your immortal countenance today is an honor spanning ten thousand kalpas and a thousand lifetimes. If you have any guidance to offer, I would humbly receive your sagely compassion." The Queen Mother replied, "For such matters, you may consult the Attendant of the Celestial Palace, Master Lin, and the Heavenly Master Zhang Xujing; they can help you escape great calamity."

The Emperor said, "Since the Primordial Lady has descended, would you not bestow some teaching?" The Queen Mother then presented the Emperor with a divine elixir for his protection and well-being, saying, "Watch for treacherous ministers, relocate the capital to Chang’an, and follow the precedents of the Grand Progenitors Taizu and Taizong. Though minor disasters may occur, they will not become great catastrophes. If you do not heed this, you will regret it when it is too late." With these words, she departed.

One day, the Crown Prince ascended the hall and memorialized, "Lin Lingsu practices sorcery; I implore Your Majesty to execute him. Your subject daily reflects that his arts are vast and inconceivable. If Your Majesty does not believe this, I beg you summon the Dharma Masters now in the capital to contend with Lin Lingsu in magic, that we may distinguish the heterodox from the orthodox."

At that time, fourteen men gathered in the Hall of Concentrated Spirit. The Emperor summoned the Crown Prince, the various princes, and the assembled ministers to observe. Master Lin spat forth a mouthful of water, which transformed into a five-colored cloud. Within it, a hundred cranes took flight, circling before the hall, while golden dragons and lions mingled among the clouds. The others memorialized, "This is nothing extraordinary—mere paper dragons and cranes. Permit us to recite the Great Divine Gaze, and these dragons and cranes shall fall to the ground, revealed as paper."

The Crown Prince, hearing this, rejoiced and said, "If this proves true, then Lin Lingsu’s arts are false, and he deserves execution." Yet even as they spoke in admiration, of the fourteen, only two could still recite the incantation; the rest were struck dumb, their faces ashen as death. The Crown Prince rebuked Master Lin, saying, "If any of these men die, you shall restore their lives." Having uttered the spell, he inhaled, and at once the cranes and dragons multiplied by the hundreds, obscuring the sun and veiling the clouds.

The Emperor said, "This display is ineffective. What other arts do you possess?" The twelve men prostrated themselves in terror, while the remaining two memorialized, "Your subjects can inhale boiling water." Water was brought and measured; indeed, they did so. The Crown Prince lifted a basin of water before the Emperor and called Master Lin to witness. Master Lin drew in a breath and blew into the water, which instantly turned clear and froze into ice.

The Emperor reproached them, saying, "Our court has treated you with great generosity; how dare you utter such reckless words?" Master Lin memorialized, "I beg that a thousand catties of charcoal be burned into a fiery cavern, its embers glowing red throughout. I request to enter it with these two men to test our arts." After some time, the fiery cavern was prepared. Master Lin said, "I beg to enter first, and that the two men follow." He stepped into the flames, yet his robes remained untouched.

The others prostrated themselves, wailing and pleading with the Crown Prince, "We beg for our lives! We willingly don the cap and hold the tablet, to serve and obey." The Crown Prince descended the hall and bowed, beseeching that the Crown Prince’s memorial be accepted to atone for their offenses. By imperial decree, their crimes were pardoned, but as Dao Jian and the other two were Chinese subjects who had deceived their sovereign, they were sent to the Kaifeng Prefecture to be branded on the face and banished to the frontier, where they were made examples before the people.

On the eighth day of the first month of the first year of the Xuanhe era, an edict was issued renaming all Buddhist monks as "Virtuous Scholars." Master Lin submitted a memorial, saying, "Your subject is but a rustic of the mountains and forests, mistakenly favored by Your Majesty’s grace. If the name of the Sangha is altered, it will surely incur widespread resentment. I beg to return to my homeland as a commoner." The imperial decree did not permit this, nor would it entertain further petitions.

In the fifth month, a great flood assailed the capital. The Emperor commanded Master Lin to address it. Master Lin memorialized, "This flood is difficult to control; it is Heaven’s will to admonish Your Majesty. Moreover, this flood arises from the Crown Prince. I dare not reveal Heaven’s design, but if you test this by having the Crown Prince pay homage, you may believe it." The Crown Prince was then ordered to ascend the city walls, where he burned imperial incense and bowed four times. The waters receded by a *zhang*. By nightfall, the flood had entirely subsided. The people of the capital all declared it the virtue of the Crown Prince.

Master Lin then memorialized, "When I first received Heaven’s mandate to come, it was to dispel the yin demons for Your Majesty, sever the strange and uncanny, exalt the Divine Empyrean, establish the *Baolu*, revere the Great Dao, and assist the loyal and worthy. Yet now, Cai Jing, the chief of ghosts, is entrusted with great authority, while Tong Guan, the nation’s traitor, is given command of the imperial guard."

The state’s affairs are left unattended, and extravagance has grown excessive. The comet’s passage goes unheeded—Your Majesty has not accumulated virtuous deeds to avert its omen; the Great Unity has departed from its palace, yet Your Majesty has not relocated the capital to evade its portent. The hearts of the people are the dwelling of Heaven. Though the August Heaven is high, the hearts of men are easily moved, and thus cultivating human affairs may align with Heaven’s will. The Dipper and the Seal are as one. The great reckoning cannot be escaped—how could one know there is a calendar beyond its appointed term?

I now bid farewell to Your Imperial Countenance, never again to gaze upon the celestial visage. Beware the years *bingwu* and *dingwei*, when weapons shall surge forth, blood shall stain a myriad *li*, and Heaven’s favor shall not suffice to protect the Two Palaces. Does Your Majesty not recall the verse from Yuan Tiangang’s *Tui Bei Tu*?

*"Two dynasties’ emperors laugh with glee,
Leading their ministers across Meng Ford.
Hands clasped, they find no path to advance or retreat—
To leave or not to leave, sorrow consumes them."*

This humble servant, Ling Su, suffers from illness and begs to return his bones to his homeland. Another edict was issued, refusing his plea.

That winter, the entire Censorate memorialized that Lin Lingsu had recklessly proposed relocating the capital, deluding the imperial ear with omens, abolishing Buddhist teachings, and slandering high ministers. Upon hearing this, the Master laughed heartily and summoned his disciples along with the supervising palace officials, declaring, "The gifts bestowed by successive imperial decrees—some three hundred cartloads—have been sealed since last year under the *Thousand-Character Classic* numbering system, with meticulous records kept. Not a single item has been used; all may be returned to the palace." He then called for a single boy to carry his robes and bedding, and strode out through the nation’s gates, ignoring all summons to return.

The *Eastern Capital Records* of Emperor Huizong’s reign in Wenzhou states: "In the eleventh month of the first year of the *Xuanhe* era, on the day *yimao*, sacrifices were offered to the August Heavenly Emperor at the State Altar. A general amnesty was proclaimed throughout the realm, and Lin Lingsu was permitted to return to his mountain."

During his time in the capital, the Master, though approached by chief ministers and imperial princes, neither engaged in conversation nor received guests. Only when the Celestial Master of Emptiness and Stillness arrived would he open his door and speak with him through day and night. Beyond this, there was only Zhang Ruhui, the Eastern and Western Palace Attendant, who had once served at Tongzhen Abbey. They walked together when traveling and shared the same seat when resting. Of all the masters of the Daoist teachings, only Zhang had grasped their subtleties. After returning home, they resided together in Yongjia.

In the eighth month of the first year of the *Xuanhe* era, the Master suddenly presented a memorial to the prefect, requesting its submission. He then took leave of the provincial officials, his kinsmen, and his neighbors, saying, "The dusty world is not a place for long attachment—moreover, great calamity is soon to strike. I must now depart."

On the fifteenth day of the month, the full moon having risen, the Master summoned Zhang Ruhui and said: "I now entrust my lineage of the Dao to you. You alone still possess the Six Seals and Nine Talismans, along with the wondrous divine mechanisms of the Six Ding. All these I now transmit to you—pass them down through the generations to but one person, and let them never be lightly disclosed." He also handed over a strand of seven-jeweled plain beads, saying: "If the Emperor should send for these, deliver them without delay. In the future, you shall render great loyalty to the court and preserve your integrity. For now, we part—but we shall meet again in the Divine Empyrean." With these words, he called for paper and brush and wrote a verse:

*Forty-five years of toil in this fleeting life,*
*Worldly fame soared high, yet all was but vanity.*
*I recall but the old path to the Divine Empyrean—*
*On the mid-autumn moon, at the third watch of night.*

Having written this, he lit a censer of incense. It was precisely the third watch; the moon shone bright, and the wind was still. Suddenly, a clap of thunder resounded, and the Master sat in transformation and departed. He had previously designated his burial site outside the city walls and instructed Master Zhang and his disciples: "Dig five feet deeper beneath the original grave. When you see the tortoise and serpent, lower the coffin. If five-colored qi emerges, do not wait to cover the earth—flee a hundred paces at once." His disciples followed his words. Indeed, the mountain split and rocks burst asunder, and his whereabouts became unknown.

When the Emperor heard of this, he gasped in astonishment and grief, composing a eulogy:

Alas! The living are but temporary forms; the dead return to truth. Those who embody the Dao are enlightened beings—how could one who dies in an instant be counted among the awakened? Swiftly he came, and in an instant he departed. Neither coming nor going did he allow his form to burden him; neither life nor death did he deem worldly glory worthy of cherishing. Such is the way of transcending life and death, of comprehending the principle of illusion and transformation—only a divine minister could achieve this.

Alas! The divine minister’s life was no true life. Heaven had lent him to aid in its transformative work, to assist the state and succor the people. His death was no true death—he returned to Heaven, where the Great Dao is fulfilled, and the deluded masses are awakened. His spirit congealed in the purity of celestial truth; his body dissolved, leaving only a trace in the world’s reckoning. Riding the clouds and mist, mounted upon the sun and moon, he roams the peaks of Penglai and Yingzhou, strides the jade steps of the Purple Void—beyond all mortal measure.

Now, I command the local officials to observe the rites of the human realm and offer this sacrifice before his coffin. If his spirit remains undimmed, may he partake of this honor and favor.

Decree: Upon the ascension of Attendant Lin of the Divine Empyrean, the local officials shall conduct the funeral rites as prescribed. The attending officials shall select a site for his resting place. The gold vessels from his belongings shall be sold to fund a grand Yellow Register Daoist ritual lasting a month. Any shortfall shall be covered by the provincial treasury. A memorial shall be submitted, and no negligence or delay shall be tolerated. Another official shall be dispatched to oversee the matter, ensuring it aligns with Our will and Our enduring regard for him.

He was posthumously bestowed a sacred title of ninety-five characters: *Highest Divine Empyrean Jade Clarity Palace, Right Ultimate Western Terrace Divine Minister; Thunder and Lightning Jade Pivot, Primordial Radiance, Universal Transformation Heavenly Master; Penetrating Clarity, Literary Elegance, Contracting the Primordial, Responding to the True Transmission, Dao-Supporter and Teaching-Patriarch; Golden Gate Feathered Adept; Harmonious Attendant of the Divine Empyrean Hall; Special Advance Grand Preceptor, Equal to the Three Dukes, Participant in the Deliberations of the Secretariat-Chancellery; Pillar of the State; Duke of the Lu Commandery; with a fief of eight thousand one hundred households and a real fief of three thousand households; granted the Purple Jade Square Talisman, Master of Penetrating Truth, Reaching the Numinous, Primordial Wonder, and Protecting the State—Lin Lingsu.*

In the first year of the *Jingkang* era, Emperor Yuansheng ascended the throne. As foretold, he first sent for the seven-jeweled plain beads. Then, he dispatched envoys to oversee the prefect, commandant, and local officials in excavating the tomb. For three days, they searched in vain—only scattered boulders, a howling black wind, torrential rain, lightning, and thunderclaps were seen. Faces could not be discerned amid the chaos; monstrous beasts and giant serpents emerged. The guards recorded the events in detail and submitted a memorial. Emperor Yuansheng, greatly alarmed, sent envoys bearing imperial incense to Wenzhou, instructing the local officials to conduct a grand Daoist ritual and offer apologies. He further decreed the posthumous title *Master of Penetrating Truth and Reaching the Numinous* and ordered his portrait painted and enshrined in the Tianqing Abbey, where it remains to this day.

The original account was embellished by Academician Geng Yanchi with ornate prose, replete with allusions and profound intent—understandable only to the most learned scholars. Here, I have rendered the facts in plain language, that both Daoist priests and common folk may know of the Master’s divine nature.

I once held office in the western capital when the Master presented me with a sealed manuscript. Upon seeing it, he said: "Later, you shall be involved in a restoration. If you encounter the rebels of the *Spring-Head Wood Gathering*, retire from office, open this manuscript, and follow its instructions—you may escape great calamity and attain long life. Otherwise, we shall meet again in Chaoyang, at the old post station. By then, regret will be too late." At the time, I did not take his words seriously, nor did I remember the teachings in the manuscript. Later, while investigating official matters, I indeed encountered the rebels of the *Spring-Head Wood Gathering* and was exiled to a distant island. Passing through Chaoyang Station, as I approached the post pavilion, I saw a youth in fine robes with a radiant complexion enter the station. Gazing closely, I recognized him—it was the Master. Smiling, he asked: "Were my words untrue?" Only then did I realize the Master was a true immortal.

Thus, I have revised this biography to present it to later generations. Respectfully recorded by Zhao Ding, former Left Vice Director of the Department of State Affairs.

Master Wang Wenqing, whose surname was Wang and given name Wenqing, styled Shudao, was originally from Nanfeng in Jianchang, Jiangyou. He was born on the seventeenth day of the second month in the eighth year of Yuanyou during the reign of Emperor Zhezong of Song, at the hour of *hai*.

From birth, he was divinely extraordinary; as he grew, he became keenly intelligent. He once composed a poem containing the lines: *"Red dust’s wealth and rank I do not crave, / The Purple Mansion’s true immortals I aspire to join."* One day, he suddenly told his father: "Last night, I dreamed I arrived at a place where towers and pavilions stood in lush array. A great serpent coiled upon the ground, and I stepped upon its head. The serpent reared up, nearly ascending to the heavens." His father said: "You shall continue our immortal lineage."

Thereafter, Master Wang’s nature inclined toward purity and emptiness; his will was set on nurturing simplicity. He neither coveted fame nor profit, keeping far from worldly toil. He delighted in wandering through sacred realms and scenic lands, roaming the earth with a simple headscarf and staff. In the early years of Emperor Huizong’s *Xuanhe* reign, as he was about to cross the Yangzi River, he encountered an extraordinary man who taught him the method of *flying memorials* to petition the emperor and the scripture for commanding wind and thunder. At every auspicious hour, he would send up *flying memorials* and silently pay homage to the Supreme Emperor. When he summoned thunder to pray for rain or rebuked the winds and clouds, his commands were obeyed. If long rains required clearing, the skies would promptly brighten; if deep winter demanded snow, six-petaled flakes would drift from the heavens. When households were plagued by malevolent spirits, he would dispatch divine generals to expel them, bringing peace to the afflicted. Yet he often concealed his fame and avoided praise, drifting through life with poetry and wine, unknown to the vulgar masses.

Previously, Attendant of the Imperial Chamber Lin Lingsu memorialized Emperor Huizong, stating that the Master was none other than the Celestial Scribe of the Three Heavens, overseer of civil officials, who had descended into the mortal realm to assist in the transformation of purity and tranquility. Eighteen imperial edicts were issued, and the realm was scoured for his whereabouts, yet none knew his location. The emperor’s uncle, the Surveillance Commissioner, fell ill during his inspection tour in Gaoyou Prefecture, and physicians proved ineffective. He encountered the Master and sought his talismanic water, by which he recovered. At first, the Master concealed his name, and only upon earnest entreaty was he revealed to be Wang Wenqing. Upon returning to court, the uncle first memorialized the marvels of the transcendent.

In the seventh month of the fourth year of the Xuanhe era, the emperor personally brushed an imperial rescript and dispatched it to the Master’s residence, extolling his virtue and power, honoring his non-action, and sending Attendant of the Imperial Chamber Dong Zhongyun as an Envoy of Inquiry, along with local surveillance officials and prefectural governors, to formally invite him with due ceremony and escort him to the capital. Upon the Master’s arrival, he presented the profound transformation of the Dao of non-action, greatly delighting the imperial countenance. The emperor lodged him in the Nine Yangs Assembly of Perfected Palace and dispatched envoys in an unbroken stream. He bestowed upon him a golden saddle and imperial steed, dragon tea and jade wine, rare treasures and exotic fruits, gold, coin, and silks—all of which the Master declined and returned.

The Master was commanded to enter the Pure Palace, where he advised on the sprinkling of water and sweeping. The emperor presented him with a sword and alms bowl and led him into the inner palace for libations. The palace women hung gold coins in countless numbers, but upon exiting the palace gate, he scattered them all upon the ground, declaring, “A true transcendent.” The emperor further inquired whether malevolent spirits plagued the palace. The Master memorialized, “There is a spirit in the southeast corner of the palace.” The emperor asked, “How may it be expelled?” The Master replied, “Your servant will inscribe a talisman.” After completing the talisman, he instructed a messenger to swiftly carry it to the Rear Slaughterhouse Gate and cast it into the flowing waters, awaiting its effects. The emperor acted as advised.

Later, a report came: “The talisman entered the water as if seized by someone.” The Master further memorialized, “After a while, thunder will resound—this is certain.” The emperor was deeply astonished.

Indeed, thunder split open a great juniper tree in the palace’s southeast corner, killing a giant python several *zhang* in length, severed in two. The emperor was overjoyed.

Earlier, at Jingkou, there stood the Temple of the Fox King, established by the founding emperor of the Stone Ancestry and venerated for many years. One day, fire erupted within the temple, reducing it entirely to ashes and turning it into a grassy field. Chancellor Zhang Tianjue, who governed with virtue, had over a thousand Fox King temples demolished. After Tianjue’s dismissal, fox spirits banded together, infiltrating the palace to steal vessels and treasures, bewitching the palace women. Some scaled mountains, others roamed the halls, perpetrating all manner of mischief, leading to the deaths of not a few favored concubines.

Thus, on the day the Master arrived at court, the emperor first addressed him, to which the Master memorialized: “May Your Majesty remain serene and silent, allowing your servant to expel and subdue them. I request that within the northeast gate of the capital, a three-tiered Thunder Altar be constructed, with an iron cauldron installed within.” When night fell under a bright moon, the Master, wielding his sword, ascended the altar, casting talismans and roaring incantations. Wind and thunder raged, and the heavens darkened. By midnight, Daoist officials witnessed marshals binding several ghosts—clad in striped robes—and driving them into the altar’s center. The Master covered the cauldron’s mouth with talismanic paper, performed his rites, and buried it in the earth, causing all to tremble. At dawn, he entered to memorialize that the fox spirits had been restrained, and from then on, no harm would come. “However, in the Jade Pool, there lurks a black fish from the Liang dynasty, which has transformed into a monstrous being. The fox spirits ride this fish, assuming dragon-like forms to enter the palace, startling and harming the imperial consorts. Now that it has been slain, I request that eunuchs be dispatched to inter it at the Ghost Gate, ensuring its permanent eradication.”

The emperor personally visited the Jade Pool and found a dead fish over a *zhang* long. He marveled for a long while, then ordered the construction of a hall and Daoist abbey encircling the Fox-Restraining Altar, bestowing upon it the name *Office of the Controller of Destiny*. The Master was appointed to oversee its affairs, visiting every five days to burn incense and conduct rituals upon the altar. The Master further presented twelve talismans, which were inscribed upon copper, iron, and stone and concealed within the twelve directional positions of the imperial palace to expel and slay the spirits of flowers, stones, grasses, and trees.

Later, when Yangzhou suffered a prolonged drought, the emperor summoned the Master to pray for rain. The Master memorialized, requesting the Sword and Water Vessel. Upon receiving the imperial bestowal of the vessel and sword, the Master spat a mouthful of water and intoned: “By the command of the Great Song Emperor, your servant prays for rain—rain to shroud the land in mist, wind to uproot trees. Let a thousand *li* of Yangzhou be thoroughly drenched. Borrow three *chi* from the Yellow River. Hasten, as the law commands!” Several days later, the governor of Yangzhou memorialized that rain had indeed fallen, though it was yellow and turbid. The emperor asked why the sweet rain had turned yellow. The Master replied: “The Jiang, Huai, and Ji Rivers are all forbidden by the Celestial Emperor, but the Yellow River is not. Thus it is so.” The emperor exclaimed in delight: “Divine indeed!”

In the seventh month of the seventh year of the Xuanhe era, an edict was issued appointing Master Wang Wenqing of the Subtle Dao of Emptiness as Grand Master of the Supreme Simplicity, Registrar of the Hall of Concentrated Spirit, and Gentleman for Court Discussion of the Right, with the additional titles of Compiler of Texts and Participant in the Imperial Procession. Shortly after, he was further appointed Attendant of the Hall of Concentrated Spirit, later assuming concurrent oversight of the Nine Yang Palace of Total Perfection and the Office of the Controller of Destiny.

His father, Wang Zhao, was posthumously honored as Gentleman for Rendering Service; his mother, née Jiang, as Lady of Great Propriety. The Master submitted a memorial requesting leave to return to the mountains, to wander in seclusion, to merge with the Dao of the Imperial Unity, and to recite the *True Scripture of the Great Cavern* to prolong the emperor’s lifespan. The emperor did not consent. He further instructed the Master to wear a golden square talisman every five days, entering the various palace halls to consecrate water, purify filth, expel evil, cure illness, and expound upon the Dao and virtue. The emperor dispatched the eunuch Huang Yao to command the Master to perform the Great Rites of the Southern Altar of Refinement at the Guangde Palace, delivering the souls of the deceased. That night, the Master cast talismans to summon the palace women harmed by the fox spirits, each appearing in turn. He also produced the *Celestial Treasure Record* to deliver the living, which the emperor greatly revered.

In the eleventh month, when the Bright Hall rites were to be held, excessive rain fell. The emperor summoned the Master and said: “Whenever the Bright Hall rites are conducted, rain and snow freeze, damaging the ceremonial objects and guards. This time, I specially commission the Immortal Minister to pray for clear skies at the Nine Yang Palace of Total Perfection.” The Master agreed. From the day of rehearsal until the conclusion of the Bright Hall rites, the skies remained perfectly clear. The following day, the emperor sat in the Hall of Azure Splendor and summoned the Master. Addressing his ministers, he declared: “The clear skies during this Bright Hall rite were truly the work of Wang Wenqing.” He then issued an edict appointing him, as before, Grand Master of the Supreme Simplicity and Attendant of the Hall of Concentrated Spirit, with the additional titles of Master of the Subtle Dao of Emptiness, Gentleman of the Great Center, Grand Master for Court Discussion, and Participant in the Secretariat, overseeing the affairs of the Daoist clergy.

His father was again posthumously honored as Gentleman for Consultation; his mother as Lady of Great Propriety; his wife, née Ping, as Lady of Propriety; his uncle, Wang Shen, as Gentleman for Rendering Trust; and his younger brother, Ciqing, as Gentleman of Meritorious Achievement, with the same qualifications as those granted for service at the Southern Suburban Sacrifice.

The Master submitted another memorial, stating: “I beg that a wise and sagacious commander be appointed to guard against the malevolent *qi* in the northwest. I also request leave to return to the mountains in my old age.” The imperial rescript read: “How could a celestial minister of the Jade Palace speak of retirement? Your request is denied.” The Jurchen rebels grew rampant, the imperial armies suffered defeat—just as the Master had forewarned.

The emperor then bestowed twenty sticks of incense, instructing the Master to descend with them to both the capital and the provinces to pacify the realm and safeguard the imperial altars. The Master received the incense and returned to his abbey. The emperor dispatched the eunuch Huang Yao with a sealed vermilion document containing imperial incense, to be burned at the Jade Emperor’s Hall of the Nine Yang Palace of Total Perfection. Shortly after, the emperor specially summoned the Master to report on the response. Within an hour, successive messengers arrived, summoning the Master into the palace. The emperor inquired about the response to the vermilion document. The Master, shedding tears, memorialized: “In the memorial, Your Majesty expressed the wish that a virtuous ruler would emerge to govern the realm beyond the Huai River, offering my own life in gratitude for the response.” The imperial reply stated: “If there is to be change, let there be no regret.”

The emperor further inquired, “Master, what is the principle behind this?” The Master secretly memorialized, and the emperor deeply assented.

On the twenty-third day of the twelfth month, the emperor abdicated in favor of the Eastern Palace. The Master entered the court to offer congratulations. Several days later, he burned incense and departed the capital.

In the fourth month of the first year of Jingkang under Emperor Qinzong, the Master hastened to court to request leave to return home and attend to his mother, his words earnest and sincere. The emperor granted his petition.

In the thirteenth year of Shaoxing under Emperor Gaozong, an imperial edict summoned the Master, but he did not go. One day, Magistrate Shao Tai of Shaowu, while passing through the county under Prefect Xu Dexiu’s governance, visited the Master. The Master said, “Shaowu has suffered a great drought.” He then silently prayed at the emperor’s abode, where he saw the so-called *Huiying* deity kneeling before the jade steps, pleading forcefully for the people. The emperor explained that such matters followed a fixed number. The *Huiying* deity insisted, “That prefecture is poor and barren; the people cannot go a single day without grain.” His entreaties were so urgent that he ultimately secured the request, and the year yielded a harvest. When Prefect Xu returned to his office and recounted the matter, the local gentry and commoners unanimously renovated the temple, expanding its halls and deepening their reverence. The *Huiying Record* provides a full account of these events.

In the twenty-second year of Shaoxing, the Master one day said to his disciple Zhu Zhiqing, “I shall soon withdraw into seclusion.” He then took his ritual texts and seal impressions into the stone grotto of Junfeng Mountain and concealed them, exhorting the local earth deity to guard them until a practitioner of the Dao encountered them.

On the twenty-first day of the eighth month in the twenty-third year of Shaoxing (the *guiyou* year), the Master took leave of the county magistrate and bid farewell to his acquaintances. On the twenty-third day, he rose early and composed a verse on his coffin, saying:
*“This body is but a loan,
The pine planks no more real.
To fool the eyes of the vulgar,
I leap beyond the red dust.”*
Having recited this, he concealed himself and departed in the Hall of Alchemical Practice of Xu Jingyang at the Qingdu Abbey of the county. At that moment, a clap of thunder resounded, and the Master thus transcended. His disciples—Xiong the Mountain Man, Ping Jingzong, Yuan Tingzhi, and others—entombed him at Tortoise Hill.

The following year, in the third month, a Daoist named Guo from Longhu Mountain arrived in the county and reported that on the night of the Lantern Festival, he had attended a ritual offering in the imperial palace, where the Master had lingered for three days before departing. Later, a traveler returning from Chengdu Prefecture encountered the Master on the road to Shu. He also inquired whether anyone had received the Master’s transmission of the Daoist arts.
