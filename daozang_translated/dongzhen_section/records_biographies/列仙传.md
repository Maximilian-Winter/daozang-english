**Traditions of the Immortals, Fascicle One**
By Liu Xiang, Han Court Gentleman for Splendid Happiness

**Chisongzi**
Chisongzi was the Rain Master in the time of Shennong. He ingested *shuiyu* (water jade) and taught its use to Shennong. He could enter fire and burn himself unharmed. Often he ascended Kunlun Mountain, dwelling in the stone chamber of the Queen Mother of the West, riding the winds and rains as they rose and fell. The youngest daughter of the Flame Emperor pursued him and, attaining immortality, departed with him. By the time of Gao Xin, he again served as Rain Master. The Rain Masters of today trace their origin to him.

*O so distant, Chisongzi!*
*O so ethereal, the maiden!*
Hand in hand they soared in flight,
suddenly aloft as one.
They cast themselves upon the long winds,
in an instant winging to the Dark Garden.
Profoundly attuned to *xun* and *kan* (wind and water),
they set the model for the office of Rain Master.

**Ning Fengzi**
Ning Fengzi lived in the time of the Yellow Emperor. The age transmitted that he served as the Yellow Emperor’s Pottery Master. A man once passed by and, tending his kiln fires, could emit smoke of five colors. Over time, he taught this art to Fengzi. Fengzi amassed fire and burned himself, ascending and descending with the smoke and qi. When his ashes were examined, his bones remained intact. The people of that time buried him together on Mount Ning in the north, and so he was called Ning Fengzi.

*Wondrous indeed, Fengzi,*
*marvelously endowed by nature!*
His essence refined in the great furnace,
his qi flowing freely in five-hued smoke.
His bones left among the ashes,
entombed on tranquil Mount Ning.
Men beheld his traces,
but who could fathom his mysteries?

**Ma Shihuang**

**Ma Shihuang**

Ma Shihuang was a horse physician in the time of the Yellow Emperor. He understood the living and dying signs in a horse’s form, and whenever he treated them, they invariably recovered. Later, a dragon descended before him, ears drooping and mouth agape. Shihuang said, “This dragon is ill and knows I can heal it.” He then stitched its lower lip to its mouth and administered a decoction of licorice, whereupon it recovered. Thereafter, dragons with ailments would often emerge from the waves to seek his treatment. One day, a dragon bore Shihuang away upon its back.

*Master Shihuang tended horses,*
*never a flawed steed remained.*
*His skill moved even dragons,*
*his art spanned all creatures.*
*In gratitude for his virtue,*
*they bore him aloft with bridle in jaws.*
*Soaring through the celestial river,*
*he left behind only his legacy.*

**Chi Jiang Ziyu**

Chi Jiang Ziyu was a man of the Yellow Emperor’s time. He ate no grains but subsisted on the flowers of a hundred herbs. By the reign of Emperor Yao, he worked as a carpenter, able to ascend and descend with the wind and rain. Often in the marketplace, he sold fishing lines, and so was also called *Father of the Line*.

*The common folk live on grain,*
*who enjoys such distant blessing?*
*Ziyu transcended the world,*
*feasting on blossoms, drinking dew.*
*He entrusted himself to wind and rain,*
*his steps light and free.*
*He could wander the clouds,*
*and cross the bounds of life.*

**The Yellow Emperor**

The Yellow Emperor was styled Xuanyuan. He could summon the hundred spirits and command them at court. Though young, he could speak; though sagely, he foresaw all things, knowing the principles of creation. He called himself *Master of the Clouds* and bore the form of a dragon. He chose his own day of departure and took leave of his ministers. When he died, he was buried at Mount Qiao. The mountain collapsed, and his coffin was found empty, save for his sword and cap.

The *Book of Transcendents* states: The Yellow Emperor mined copper from Mount Shou and cast a tripod beneath Mount Jing. When the tripod was completed, a dragon descended with its whiskers trailing to welcome the Emperor, who then ascended to heaven. His ministers and officials all grasped the dragon’s whiskers and followed, clambering upward. The Emperor’s bow and the dragon’s whiskers snapped, and the bow fell. The ministers could not follow and, gazing up, wailed in sorrow. Thus, the place was later called *Tripod Lake*, and the bow was named *Crow’s Wail*.

*Profound and divine,*
*how vast the Emperor’s majesty!*
*He governed the ten thousand things,*
*and his name crowned a hundred kings.*

The Way transformed the Six Directions, its reckoning boundless and without limit. Though buried in semblance at Mount Qiao, he transcended to ascend the azure heavens.

**Juequan**
Juequan was a gatherer of herbs on Mount Huai. He favored eating pine seeds. His body grew hair several inches long, and his eyes became square. He could fly, outrunning galloping horses. He once gifted pine seeds to Emperor Yao, who had no time to consume them. These pines were the *jian* pine. Those of his time who partook of them all lived to two or three hundred years. Juequan, nourished by pine, moved with ease, his gaze sharp and square. His feet trod upon simurghs and phoenixes, his steps swift as soaring wine. He bestowed this divine recipe at Yao’s gate, a gift of this wondrous method. Those of perfect nature may decline it, but those of middling wisdom would do well to receive it.

**Master Rongcheng**
Master Rongcheng claimed to be the teacher of the Yellow Emperor and was seen by King Mu of Zhou. He excelled in the arts of supplementation and guiding, drawing essence from the Mysterious Female. His essential teaching was that the Valley Spirit does not die—those who guard life and nurture qi. His white hair turned black again, and fallen teeth regrew, matters in which he was akin to Laozi. Some also say he was Laozi’s teacher. Diligent was Master Rongcheng, refining qi to achieve suppleness. Having attained the One in ancient times, he wandered alone, his light concealed. The Dao pierced the Yellow Court, and Bo Yang looked up to him as a peer. The gate of the Mysterious Female—this may well be sought.

**Fanghui**
Fanghui was a recluse of Yao’s time. Yao summoned him to serve as a gatekeeper. He refined and consumed mica, also sharing it with the common folk who were ill. He concealed himself in the Five Oak Mountains. In the late reign of Xia Qi, he became a palace attendant. Once seized by bandits and shut in a chamber, he was pressed to impart the Dao. Fanghui transformed and escaped, then sealed the door with his own hand. The people of the time said: "With a single pellet of Fanghui’s mud, one could seal a door forever unopened." Fanghui, his life preserved, hid himself among the Five Oaks. Chewing mica blossoms, his heart dwelled in emptiness. Though shut in a secluded chamber, he unbarred its heavy gates himself. The seal he pressed remained unbroken, never to fall.

**Laozi**
Laozi’s surname was Li, his given name Er, and his courtesy name Boyang. He was a native of Chen. Born in the Yin dynasty, he served as the Archivist beneath the Zhou pillars. He cherished the nurturing of essence and qi, valuing reception over bestowal.

He was later appointed Keeper of the Archives, holding the post for over eighty years—*Records of the Grand Historian* states over two hundred. At the time, he was known as a reclusive gentleman, posthumously titled "the Wise." When Confucius journeyed to Zhou, he met Laozi and, recognizing him as a sage, took him as his teacher.

Later, as the virtue of Zhou declined, Laozi departed in a carriage drawn by a green ox. Entering the land of Da Qin, he passed through the Western Pass, where the magistrate Yin Xi awaited and welcomed him. Knowing him to be a perfected one, Yin Xi pressed him to write a book, and so Laozi composed the *Dao De Jing* in two scrolls, upper and lower.

Laozi embodied non-action, yet nothing lay beyond his action. The Dao unifies life and death, its traces entering the numinous and wondrous. Stopping the senses and turning the inner mirror, he merged with the obscure, transcending all bounds. His virtue harmonized with the primordial qi, his lifespan matching the Two Modes.

**Magistrate Yin Xi**
Magistrate Yin Xi of the Pass was a grandee of Zhou. Skilled in esoteric learning, he constantly refined his essence and consumed the flower of vitality, cultivating hidden virtue and practicing self-cultivation, unknown to his contemporaries. When Laozi journeyed west, Yin Xi first saw his aura of darkness and knew a perfected one would pass through. He sought him out and intercepted him, and indeed, it was Laozi. Laozi, recognizing his extraordinary nature, wrote a book and transmitted it to him. Later, they traveled together beyond the Flowing Sands, transforming the Hu barbarians—some say with *jujube seeds*—and none knew where they ultimately vanished.

Yin Xi also wrote nine chapters himself, titled *The Master of the Pass*. Yin Xi guarded the pass, embracing virtue as his duty. He rinsed his mouth with the sun’s radiance, gazing upward to contemplate the profound measure. Awaiting the qi of the perfected one, he alone awakened. Together they crossed the Flowing Sands, attaining the same wondrous end.

**Master Juan**
Master Juan was a native of Qi. He favored consuming wood, absorbing its essence. After three hundred years, he appeared in Qi and composed the *Canon of Heaven and Man* in forty-eight chapters. Later, while fishing at Lotus Marsh, he caught a carp whose belly bore a talisman. He withdrew to Rock Mountain, where he could summon wind and rain. He received the Nine Immortals’ Method from Boyang.

The Prince of Huainan, Liu An, obtained his writings in his youth but could not fathom their meaning. His three-chapter *Zither Heart* was well-ordered.

Juan the Elder consumed wood, enjoying a distant span of years. Once the Nine Immortals’ Method was transmitted, the Three Powers were set in order. The red carp delivered the talisman, and he commanded wind and clouds. Striking the zither in secluded cliffs, his lofty abode stood afar.

**Lü Shang**
Lü Shang was a native of Jizhou.

Born with inner wisdom, he foresaw survival and ruin. To escape the chaos of King Zhou, he concealed himself in the eastern lands of Liaodong for forty years. Journeying west to Zhou, he hid in the Southern Mountains, fishing at Pan Creek for three years without catching a single fish. Those around him all said, "You should stop." Lü Shang replied, "This is not something you understand." Soon after, he indeed found the *Military Talisman* within a fish’s belly. King Wen dreamed of a sage and, hearing of Lü Shang, carried him back in his chariot. When King Wu later campaigned against Zhou, Lü Shang composed over a hundred chapters of *Secret Strategies*. He consumed灵芝 and earth marrow, living fully two hundred years before passing away. When trouble arose, he was not buried; later, his son Lü Ji interred him, but no body was found—only six chapters of the *Jade Talisman* remained in the coffin.

Lü Shang concealed himself in fishing, auspiciously obtaining the scaled talisman. Through a dream, he met the Lord of the West, riding together into service. His profound strategies aided the age, his body refined by sacred herbs. Praised through distant generations, how splendid the Heavenly Man!

**Xiaofu**
Xiaofu was a native of Jizhou. In his youth, he mended shoes in the western Zhou marketplace for decades, unknown to others. Later, people marveled at his agelessness, and the curious sought his arts, but none succeeded. Only Liang Mu obtained his method for making fire. As he ascended the Three Bright Peaks to bid Liang Mu farewell, he arrayed dozens of fires and rose into the heavens. The people of the western towns widely worshipped him.

Xiaofu preserved his form, his years neither waning nor advancing. Liang Mu encountered him, their meeting transcending the void. Crimson flames spread their radiance, purple mist formed a canopy. Gazing upward, he ascended into the clouds, leaving worldly splendor behind.

**Shimen**
Shimen was a disciple of Xiaofu. He, too, could command fire and consumed peach and plum blossoms. He served as the dragon master for Xia Kongjia. When Kongjia failed to heed his will, he killed and buried him in the wild. The next day, wind and rain came to greet him, and when it ceased, the mountain’s trees were all scorched. Kongjia offered sacrifices and prayed, but upon returning, he died on the road.

Shimen wielded fire, its might blazing and fierce. He reared dragons in secret, concealing his numinous wisdom. The Xia king oppressed him, his spirit enduring though his form perished. After wind and rain descended, he departed in solemn ascent.

**Wu Guang**
Wu Guang was a man of the Xia era. His ears measured seven inches long. He loved the zither and consumed cattail and leek roots. When Tang of Yin was about to campaign against Zhou, he consulted Wu Guang. Guang said, "This is not my affair." Tang asked, "Who is suitable?" He replied, "I do not know." Tang said, "What of Yi Yin?" Guang answered, "He is strong and endures disgrace—I know nothing beyond that." After Tang conquered Jie, he offered the realm to Guang, saying, "The wise plan it, the martial achieve it, the benevolent dwell in it—this is the ancient Way. Why do you not accept it?" He begged to serve as Guang’s minister.

Wu Guang declined, saying: "To depose a ruler is not righteous; to kill men is not benevolent; to let others face peril while I enjoy the gains is not upright. I have heard that one who is not righteous does not accept its emoluments, and in an age without the Way, one does not tread its ranks—would I die for exalting myself? I cannot bear to remain in sight for long." Thereupon he carried a stone and drowned himself in the Liao River, then concealed himself. Over four hundred years later, he reappeared in the time of Wu Ding. Wu Ding wished to appoint him as minister, but he refused. Wu Ding sent a carriage to press him, yet without proper ritual, so Guang fled to Mount Fuliang. Later he wandered to Mount Shangfu. Wu Guang cultivated benevolence, consumed herbs to nurture his true nature, roamed obscurely beyond the world, and walked alone in constant equilibrium. Though Wu Ding was noble, Guang debated rank and would not serve. Carrying a stone to sink himself, he made his body as nothing.

**Qiu Sheng**
Qiu Sheng was a man of unknown origin. In the time of Tang of Yin, he served as Minister of Wood. For over thirty years, he grew ever more vigorous, and all knew him as an extraordinary man, revering and following him as their teacher. He often ate pine resin and, on the northern mountain of Shixiang, built his own stone chamber. By the time of King Wu of Zhou, the king visited his chamber and made offerings to him. How wondrous was Qiu Sheng—his course could not be fathomed.

To cultivate the self and serve the lord, he grew stronger with age. His countenance shone bright, his virtue and magnanimity ever serene. King Wu made offerings to him upon the northern mountain.

**Peng Zu**
Peng Zu was a grandee of Yin. His surname was Qian, given name Keng, grandson of Emperor Zhuanxu and middle son of Lu Zhong. From the Xia to the end of Yin, he lived over eight hundred years. He often consumed cassia and lingzhi, skilled in guiding and pulling to circulate qi. In Liyang stood Peng Zu’s immortal chamber, where prayers for wind and rain in former times were never left unanswered. Two tigers were always by the shrine’s side; when the rites concluded, tiger tracks would appear upon the ground. Later, he ascended as an immortal and departed.

How vast the great immortal—none but Peng Zu in his time. His Dao ever renewed with transformation, enduring through the ages. Hidden in the mysterious chamber, his spirit manifested in wind and rain. When the two tigers roared, none dared mock or slight him.

**Qiong Shu**
Qiong Shu was a scribe of Zhou. He could circulate qi to refine his form, boiling stone marrow to consume it, calling it "stone stalactite." Living for several hundred years, he came and went within Mount Tai Shi, where an outer stone stood like a pillow. The eight delicacies shorten life, the five minerals prolong it. Qiong Shu attained this, refining marrow and ingesting essence. While others lived a hundred years, he walked with light steps. Resting in the central prison, strolling through immortal courts.

**Jie Zitui**
Jie Zitui, surnamed Wang, given name Guang, was a man of Jin. He lived in reclusion, unknown. Delighting in Zhao Chengzi, he traveled with him.

A yellow sparrow once alighted upon his gate, and Duke Wen of Jin, Chong'er, found it strange. Jie Zitui accompanied him into exile abroad for over a decade, enduring hardship without complaint. When they returned to Mount Jie, Bo Zichang came at dawn to call Zitui, saying, "You may depart now." Zitui declined, taking his mother into the mountains, where he roamed with Bo Zichang. Later, Duke Wen sent thousands bearing jade and silk to honor him, yet he did not emerge. Thirty years after, he appeared on the shores of the Eastern Sea, selling fans to the king’s subjects. Decades later still, none knew his whereabouts.

Wang Guang lived in silence, his years long and distant. He aided the rise of a hegemon, dwelling among profound friends. Zitui’s toil was in service and yielding—what did he seek, what did he take? He followed his shadow to Mount Jie, wandering the eastern shores.

**Ma Dan**
Ma Dan was a man of Jin from Geng. During the reign of Marquis Wen, he served as a grandee. By the time of Duke Xian, he again held the post of chief of the military secretariat. When Duke Xian of Jin destroyed Geng and killed the reverent crown prince, Dan departed. By the era of Zhao Xuanzi, he rode a comfortable carriage into the Jin capital, paying respects to the grandees. Lord Ling wished to employ him, pressing him without propriety. A fierce wind tore the roofs from houses, and Dan entered the whirlwind and vanished. The people of the north revered and sacrificed to him.

Ma Dan served Jin through its rises and falls. He attended Marquis Wen and left Duke Xian, his fame enduring beyond his time. When the net of fate was cast, he followed propriety into the swift wind. Alone he ascended, vanishing into the dark palace, his traces gone.

**Ping Changsheng**
Ping Changsheng of Gucheng Village was of unknown origin. He died and revived many times, which people found unbelievable. Later, a great flood arose, claiming countless lives, yet Ping stood atop the broken gate of the mountain, shouting, "Ping Changsheng is here!" He declared that the rain and flood would cease in five days—and so it did. When the waters receded, those who climbed the mountain to offer sacrifices found only Ping’s clothes, belt, and sandals. Decades later, he reappeared as a gatekeeper in Huayin. The marvel of Gucheng, enigmatic and free, passed between life and death, his essence unchanged. His transformations transcended form; what did he care for rank or station? Briefly descending to the dust, he ultimately soared into the clouded chambers.

**Lu Tong**
Lu Tong was the famed "Madman of Chu," Jie Yu. He cultivated life, eating the fruit of the *qilumu* tree and the seeds of turnips. He wandered famous mountains, dwelling on the peaks of Mount Emei in Shu, where he was seen for generations. After hundreds of years, he departed.

Jie Yu delighted in the Dao, nurturing his nature in hidden radiance. He satirized Confucius, discoursing on the decline of the phoenix.

Inhaling qi to harmonize, preserving the heart in subtlety,
He strode the sacred peaks, his long whistle echoing on Mount Emei.

**Ge You**
Ge You was a Qiang tribesman. During the reign of King Cheng of Zhou, he carved wooden sheep to sell. One day, he mounted a sheep and entered western Shu. The kings, marquises, and nobles of Shu pursued him, ascending Mount Sui. Mount Sui lies southwest of Mount Emei, its height boundless. Those who followed him never returned, all attaining the Dao of immortality. Thus, a local saying goes: *"Obtain one peach from Mount Sui, and though you may not become immortal, you shall yet be proud."* Dozens of shrines stand at the mountain’s base, inscribed:
*Wood may become sheep,
Sheep too may gain spirit.
The spirit rests in Ge You,
Unfettered by any path.*
Soaring high on Mount Sui,
He spread his wings and raised his voice.
Those who knew defense became immortals,
Those who gained the peach found glory.

**The Two Jiang Fei**
The two Jiang Fei were of unknown origin. They appeared along the banks of the Jiang and Han rivers, where they encountered Zheng Jiaofu. Enamored at first sight, he did not know they were divine beings. He told his servant, *"I wish to descend and ask for their pendants."* The servant replied, *"The people here are skilled in speech. If you fail, you may regret it."* Jiaofu ignored him and went down, saying to the women, *"You two must be weary."* They replied, *"You, traveler, are the weary one—what weariness do we have?"* Jiaofu said, *"The orange is a pomelo; I fill my basket with bamboo shoots, set it adrift on the Han River, and let it float downstream. I follow along its banks, plucking the sacred mushrooms to eat, knowing my own presumption. I humbly ask for your pendants."* The two women said, *"The orange is a pomelo; we fill our basket with reeds, set it adrift on the Han River, and let it float downstream. We follow along its banks, plucking the sacred mushrooms as well."* Then they untied their pendants and gave them to Jiaofu. Delighted, he received them and pressed them to his chest. After hurrying away for several dozen paces, he looked at the pendants—his bosom was empty. Turning back, the two women had vanished.

The divine consorts, radiant and free,
Appeared at times along the river’s edge.
In graceful robes, they moved with measured step,
Their glancing eyes bestowing charm.
Jiaofu met them, spoke his heart’s desire—
The jade pendants cast aside, their fleeting forms untraced.

**Fan Li**
Fan Li, styled Shaobo, was a native of Xu. He served the Zhou court under the tutelage of Grand Duke Wang. Fond of cassia-scented garments and drinking only water, he became a minister of Yue and aided Goujian in defeating Wu. Later, he boarded a light boat and entered the sea, changing his name and surname. He went to Qi, where he was known as Yazi. Over a hundred years later, he appeared in Tao, becoming the Lord of Tao Zhu. His wealth accumulated to hundreds of millions, and he was called Lord Tao Zhu. Later, he abandoned it all, sold medicine in Lanling, and was recognized by later generations for centuries.

Fan Li, steering cassia-scented oars,
His heart empty, his aspirations distant.
Taught by Master Wang, he harbored both concealment and sorrow.
The dragon appeared in Yue’s land—
His work done, he turned away.
Shedding his sandals of a thousand gold,
He flowed with the Dao’s ebb and swell.

**Qin Gao**
Qin Gao was a native of Zhao. He served as a retainer to King Kang of Song, playing the zither. Practicing the arts of Juan and Peng, he wandered between Jizhou and Zhuo (or Ma) Commandery. Over two hundred years later, he announced his intention to enter the Zhuo River to retrieve a dragon’s offspring. He instructed his disciples, *"All must purify yourselves and wait by the water, setting up a shrine."* Sure enough, he rode a red carp and emerged, sitting within the shrine. Tens of thousands came to witness him. After staying for over a month, he reentered the water and departed.

Qin Gao, serene and poised, presided over music in Song’s palace.
Leaving the world’s clamor, he drifted solitary,
now afloat, now submerged in Zhuo’s waters.
Emerging, he leapt with lowered scales;
diving, he wove through clear, rushing currents.
Entrusted to the water’s release,
his joy knew no bounds.

**Kou Xian**
Kou Xian was a native of Song. He made his living by fishing, dwelling by the Sui River for over a hundred years. The fish he caught he sometimes released, sometimes sold, and sometimes ate. He always wore a cap and sash. Fond of planting lychee trees, he consumed their blossoms and fruit. When Duke Jing of Song inquired about his Way, he refused to reveal it, and the duke had him executed. Decades later, he appeared squatting at Song’s city gate, playing the zither for several days before departing. The people of Song honored him in every household.

Kou Xian cherished the Way—
his arts were not passed in vain.
Though Duke Jing put him to death,
his corpse dissolved, his spirit ascended.
Fifty years passed,
and he returned, plucking the zither.
Straddling Song’s gate, he lingered,
his heart at ease with the five strings.

**Prince Wangzi Qiao**
Prince Wangzi Qiao was the eldest son of King Ling of Zhou. He delighted in playing the sheng, mimicking the phoenix’s cry. He wandered between the Yi and Luo Rivers. The Daoist master Fuqiu Gong carried him up Mount Songgao. Over thirty years later, when sought on the mountain, he appeared to Xiang Liang, saying: *"Tell my family to await me on the seventh day of the seventh month at the summit of Mount Hou."* When the day arrived, he indeed rode a white crane to alight on the mountain’s peak, visible but unreachable. He raised his hand in farewell to the people of his time and departed after several days. Shrines were also established at the foot of Mount Hou and the summit of Mount Songgao.

Wondrous was Prince Wangzi,
his spirit roaming, his qi unclouded.
His sheng sang by the Yi and Luo,
echoing the phoenix’s call.
Moved by Fuqiu’s resonance,
hand in hand they ascended.
Wielding his staff on the green cliffs,
he borrowed wings to journey alone.

**Youbozi**
Youbozi was a guest of the Su clan in Zhou. In winter, he always wore a single robe; in the height of summer, layered garments. His appearance changed with the years. Decades later, he grew more robust, yet none of his contemporaries recognized him.

Generations came to admonish and protect the Su clan, and their descendants received his blessings of power.

A guest of Zhou, he concealed his countenance,
erasing his traces in the dust of the world.
In summer, he donned layered garments;
in winter, he shook off light flakes of snow.
His deeds never betrayed his roots,
his righteousness never sought solitary ease.
Thus he turned his gaze to the Zhou clan,
aiding them through hardship and peril.

**Master Anqi**
Master Anqi was a native of Fu Village in Langye. He sold medicines by the Eastern Sea, and the people of his time all called him the "Millennial Elder." When the First Emperor of Qin journeyed east, he requested an audience and spoke with him for three days and three nights. The emperor bestowed gold and jade discs worth tens of millions, which were left at the pavilion of Fu Village. Master Anqi departed, leaving behind a letter that read: "I offer a pair of red jade ravens in return. Seek me on Mount Penglai in several years." The First Emperor then dispatched envoys—Xu Fu, Lu Sheng, and hundreds of others—into the sea. Before reaching Mount Penglai, they invariably encountered winds and waves and returned. Shrines were established in over ten places by the sea near the pavilion of Fu Village.

Ah, vast and empty was Anqi,
his form ethereal, his essence lofty and pure.

Riding the light to align with nature, preserving qi to prolong life.
In fleeting enlightenment of the First Emperor of Qin, he left treasures at the pavilion of Fu Village.
Bound for Mount Penglai, his trace vanished in the limpid void.

**Master Gui**
Master Gui was a man of Xianglin. His complexion was dark, yet at times white, at times yellow, at times red. The people of Nanhai saw him and revered him. He regularly consumed cassia and sunflower seeds, blending them with tortoise brain into a thousand pills weighing ten *jin*. For generations, cassia trees have borne witness to him. To this day, in the south of Jingzhou, cassia pills remain.

Ah, magnificent Master Gui,
upright and steadfast in distant lands.
The numinous sunflower nourished within, the cinnabar cassia soothed without.
His countenance ever gentle, his radiance shone through the ages.
The Dao spread across the southeast, unbroken through generations.

**Xiaqiu Zhong**
Xiaqiu Zhong was a man of Ning. He sold medicines in Ning for over a hundred years, and people considered him long-lived. When an earthquake struck and houses collapsed, Zhong and several dozen households in his village, their homes bordering the water, were all ruined. Zhong died, and the villagers cast his body into the water, taking his medicines to sell. Zhong, clad in furs, followed them, demanding his medicines back. Those who had discarded him grew fearful and kowtowed, begging for mercy. Zhong said: "I regret that you have made others know of me. I shall depart." Later, he served as a courier for the king of the Fuyu Hu, returning once more to Ning. In the north, he was called the "Banished Immortal."

Ah, Xiaqiu, master of the mysterious,
banished yet shedding his traces.
Men die, and he too "dies," yet how lightly he speaks of regret.
Wandering to observe the transformations of the world, why trouble the Hu couriers?
If one does not perceive the root, who would know he was banished?

**The Wine Merchant**
The Wine Merchant was a man of the wine shop in the Liang market. His wine was always excellent and sold well, earning him ten thousand coins daily. When he was driven away for some offense, the shop’s wine turned sour and spoiled, leaving the owner impoverished. Many merchants in the Liang market offered their daughters in marriage to welcome him back. He came and went as he pleased.

A century later, he returned to Liang as a magistrate, urging the people to plant more taro and greens. "In three years," he said, "there will be a great famine." And so it came to pass, yet the people of Liang did not perish. Five years later, he untied his official sash and departed, and none knew his end.

The Wine Merchant, Xiao Cui, lodged at a Liang tavern.
What marked him as extraordinary?
His wine bore a singular, pure savor.
Bending to serve the times, he ensured the people never lacked.
At dawn, he loosed his seals and left—
none knew where he alighted.

**Ren Guang**
Ren Guang was a man of Shangcai. Skilled in refining cinnabar, he sold it in the markets and streets. After eighty-nine years, it became known that he was the same Ren Guang of old, his face still as youthful as one in his thirties. Later, an elder recognized him as the one once summoned by Zhao Jianzi, who took him back to his domain. He often dwelled on Wu and Ti Mountains, and for three generations, none knew his whereabouts. The people of Jin regularly consumed his elixir.

Ren Guang of Shangcai,
adept in refining divine cinnabar.
Though his years spanned a century,
his countenance glowed with youthful hue.
Briefly he attended Zhao Jianzi,
then followed his own ease.
Ascending the laddered peaks,
he soared to the clouds’ edge.

**Xiao Shi**
Xiao Shi was a man of the time of Duke Mu of Qin. Skilled in playing the flute, he could summon peacocks and white cranes to his courtyard. The duke had a daughter named Nongyu, who admired him, and so the duke gave her to him in marriage. Daily, he taught Nongyu to mimic the phoenix’s cry. After several years, her playing resembled the phoenix’s voice, and phoenixes came to perch upon their roof. The duke built the Phoenix Terrace for them. The couple dwelled there for years without descending. One day, they both followed the phoenixes and flew away. Thus, the people of Qin built the Phoenix Maiden’s Shrine in Yong, where the sound of flutes could sometimes be heard.

Xiao Shi, master of the flute,
drew phoenixes and cranes to dance in his court.
The House of Ying favored their union,
and she learned the phoenix’s song.
Then they grasped the phoenix’s wings,
soaring into the lofty heavens.
The shrine preserves their memory,
its lingering notes ever clear.

**The Cock-Breeding Elder**
The Cock-Breeding Elder was a man of Luo. He lived at the foot of the northern mountain in Shixiang, raising chickens for over a hundred years. His flock numbered over a thousand, each given a name. At dusk, they roosted in the trees; by day, he released them. When he called their names, they came at his summons. Selling chickens and their chicks, he earned over a million coins, which he would leave behind. He then went to Wu, where he built a pond to raise fish. Later, he ascended Wu Mountain, where hundreds of white cranes and peacocks often gathered beside him.

Though man and bird differ,
the Dao binds them as one.
The elder’s breath harmonized with all,
herding chickens, tending fish.
Perched in treetops, scales in water—
such transformations endure,
bestowed yet unchanging.

**Zhu Zhong**
Zhu Zhong was a man of Kuaiji who often traded pearls in the Kuaiji market. During the reign of Empress Lü of Han, an edict was issued seeking three-inch pearls. Upon reading the proclamation, Zhu Zhong laughed and said, "Now you shall have your worth." He presented a three-inch pearl at court and was rewarded with five hundred gold pieces. Princess Lu Yuan privately offered seven hundred gold for more pearls. Zhu Zhong then presented a four-inch pearl, placed it at the palace gate, and departed. An edict was issued to summon him from Kuaiji, but none knew his whereabouts. During Emperor Jing’s reign, he reappeared, offering dozens of three-inch pearls, then vanished again—none knew where he went.

Zhu Zhong, free of desire,
dallied as a merchant.
Bending low to peer into the Black Dragon’s lair,
he plucked this midnight radiance.
His path began in Kuaiji,
dazzling the capital of Xianyang.
Giving without claiming virtue,
his fame grew through the ages.

**Master Xiuyang**
Master Xiuyang was a man of Wei. He dwelled in a stone chamber on Huayin Mountain, where a suspended stone couch bore the marks of his long repose, worn deep into the rock. He ate little, occasionally consuming Solomon’s seal. Later, he sought an audience with Emperor Jing through the Dao. The emperor received him with courtesy and had him stay in the royal residence. After several years, the Dao remained unattained.

A decree was issued to inquire when Master Xiuyang might depart. Before the words were fully spoken, he transformed upon his couch into a white sheep, its cheek inscribed: *"Master Xiuyang bids farewell to the Son of Heaven."* Later, a stone sheep was placed upon the Spirit Terrace, but the sheep too vanished, its whereabouts unknown.

Profound was Master Xiuyang,
veiling his marvels, harboring spirit.
He pillowed on the stones of Mount Taihua,
feasting on yellow essence.
Though Han’s rites were grand,
the Dao was not his path.
Adapting to change, he took form,
then vanished in an instant.

**Lord Jiqiu**
Lord Jiqiu was a Daoist of Mount Tai’s foothills. In Emperor Wu’s reign, he received rewards for his arts. His white hair turned black again, and fallen teeth regrew. Later, he departed.

When the emperor toured the east and ascended Mount Tai, Lord Jiqiu donned a *zhangfu* cap and yellow robes, cradling a zither as he came to greet and bow before the emperor. Pointing, he warned: *"Your Majesty must not ascend—you will injure your toes."* After several *li*, the emperor’s right toe indeed broke. The emperor concealed the injury, offering sacrifices before returning. A shrine was built for Lord Jiqiu, and attendants were appointed to serve him.

Serene Jiqiu, penetrating the depths,
cultivated the Dao on the sacred mountain.
Refining form, cleansing essence,
he reversed age and restored youth.
When Han Wu journeyed forth,
he came bearing his zither to welcome him.
Warning against ascent,
he foresaw what was yet to be.

**Cui Wenzi**
Cui Wenzi was a man of Mount Tai. His family had long revered the teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi. Dwelling at the foot of Mount Qian, he later crafted the *Yellow Powder* and *Red Pellets*, establishing a shrine for Father Stone. He sold medicines in the city markets, claiming to be three hundred years old.

When a plague struck and tens of thousands perished, the local magistrate sought his aid. Cui Wenzi, wielding a vermilion banner and carrying the *Yellow Powder*, paraded through the city gates. Those who drank the powder recovered instantly, and countless lives were saved. Later, he departed and sold the *Yellow Powder* in Shu. Thus, the world treasured Cui Wenzi’s *Red Pellets* and *Yellow Powder*, deeming them near-divine.

Master Cui attained the Dao,
guardian of hidden mysteries.
As pestilence brought ruin,
his compassion grieved.
With crimson banner flashing,
divine medicine swiftly arrived.
In that moment, lives were preserved,
a legacy for all ages.

# *Records of the Immortals, Volume Two*

**Red-Beard Master**
Red-Beard Master was a native of Feng. The people of Feng transmitted accounts of him across generations, claiming he had been the fish warden under Duke Mu of Qin. He repeatedly foretold disasters, floods, and droughts along the borders of Feng, missing not one in ten. The court officials revered and followed him, welcoming him as their master. They studied under him, inquiring into his extraordinary abilities. He favored eating pine nuts, asparagus root, and mineral pitch; when his teeth fell out, new ones grew, and when his hair shed, it returned. After consuming the morning mist to the point of satiation, he departed and dwelled beneath Mount Hao for over a decade, after which none knew his whereabouts.

Red-Beard left Feng,
resting at the foot of Mount Hao.
Three medicines he mastered,
his withered form renewed.
In vain they sought his teaching,
for none could prolong their years.
How could petty wisdom grasp
the span of vast longevity?

**Dongfang Shuo**
Dongfang Shuo was a native of Yanci in Pingyuan. He dwelled for long in the capital, serving as a scribe for several decades. During the reign of Emperor Wu, he submitted a memorial on state affairs and was appointed Gentleman of the Palace. By the time of Emperor Zhao, some called him a sage, others an ordinary man. He engaged in conduct both profound and shallow, now speaking with loyalty, now uttering enigmatic words—none could fathom his intent. At the beginning of Emperor Xuan’s reign, he resigned his post as Gentleman to escape the turmoil of the age, leaving his official lodgings as the wind bore him away. Later, he was seen in Kuaiji, selling medicines by the Five Lakes. The wise suspected him to be the essence of Jupiter.

Dongfang, strange and far-reaching,
blended with the customs of his time.
Now a dragon, now a serpent—
what cared he for honor or disgrace?
His lofty spirit soared beyond the clouds,
unfettered, unbound.
He vanished into the Five Lakes,
his shadow leaping to the Valley of the Sun.

**Lady Hook-Wing**
Lady Hook-Wing was a native of Qi, surnamed Zhao. In her youth, she favored purity and solitude.

For six years she lay bedridden, her right hand clenched in a fist, taking little food or drink. A diviner observing the qi declared: "In the northeast there is the qi of a noble person." They sought her out and found her—her bearing and beauty were extraordinary. Emperor Wu pried open her hand and discovered a jade hook; immediately, her fingers unfurled. He took her into his favor, and she bore him Emperor Zhao. Later, Emperor Wu had her killed. When her body was laid in state, it remained uncorrupted and fragrant for a month. After Emperor Zhao ascended the throne, he reburied her. Inside her coffin, only a pair of silk slippers was found, so her palace was named *Hook-Wing*. Later, to avoid taboo, it was renamed *Yi Temple*. Within its chambers stands a shrine to her spirit.

Gentle and yielding, a frail beauty,
her temple received the hook’s mandate.
She gave birth to an illustrious heir,
the imperial line flourished.
Wu’s folly, turning virtue to enmity—
she surrendered her life to execution,
her corpse vanished, her fragrance lingered.

**Calf Child**
Calf Child was a native of Ye. In his youth, he lived on Black Mountain, gathering pine nuts and *fuling* mushrooms to consume as food. He lived for several hundred years, now appearing youthful, now aged, now handsome, now plain. People came to recognize him as an immortal. He often visited the home of Yang Du, who sold wine in the marketplace. Yang Du’s daughter had eyebrows that met and ears long and delicate. The people marveled at her, calling her a celestial being. One day, Calf Child arrived leading a yellow calf. The girl took a liking to him and stayed to serve him. She followed him to gather peaches and plums, returning after a single night—all the fruit was sweet and luscious. The townsfolk trailed them, but when they rushed out the gate, they could only seize the calf’s ears as it fled; no one could catch them. Later, she reappeared in the market for decades before departing. They were seen at the foot of Pan Mountain, selling peaches and plums in winter.

Calf Child dwelled in the mountains,
gathering pine nuts, consuming *fuling*.
His inner qi refined, his form transformed,
white hair turned dark.
Yang’s daughter bore a rare countenance,
their fates mysteriously aligned.
Mounting the numinous calf,
they vanished swift as lightning.

**Dragon-Rider Ming**
Dragon-Rider Ming was a native of Huntin. At twenty, he found dragon hatchlings in a pond—over ten of them, resembling little officials on guard. He raised and fed them, building a thatched hut to watch over them. As the dragons grew, they gradually departed. Fifty years later, a flood destroyed his hut and swept it away. One day, he rode a dragon to Huntin and declared: "I am the grandson of Feng Bochang. All within five hundred *li* of this place will surely perish." Those who believed him fled; those who did not called him a demon. In the eighth month, the waters indeed rose, drowning tens of thousands. Ming had tended the dragons, building his hut by the empty pond. He waited single-mindedly for their transformation, then rode the clouds away. Returning to his hometown, he urged them to flee swiftly. His warnings revealed disaster and fortune, yet his heart never left his kin.

**Pillar Master**
Pillar Master’s origins are unknown.

Pillar Master ascended Rock Mountain with a Daoist, declaring that cinnabar lay there in quantities of tens of thousands of *jin*. The magistrate of Rong Mountain learned of this and sealed the mountain. The cinnabar then flowed forth like flying fire, and they permitted Pillar Master to take it. Magistrate Zhang Junming of the district consumed the cinnabar for three years, obtaining divine cinnabar that drifted like snow. After five years of ingestion, he gained the ability to fly and thus departed together with Pillar Master.

Pillar Master and his companion peered into the depths,
The Daoist’s essence pure and penetrating.
Mysterious resonance stirred the mountain,
Cinnabar emerged from the cavern.
Glowing streams of crimson,
Floating flurries of snow.
The magistrate awakened to truth,
And in the end, they shared the same joy.

**Garden Guest**
Garden Guest was a man of Jiyin. His appearance was handsome and his nature kind; many in the district sought to wed their daughters to him, yet he never took a wife. He often cultivated five-colored fragrant herbs, accumulating them for decades and consuming their fruit. One day, a five-colored moth alighted upon the tip of his fragrant tree. The Guest gathered and spread them upon cloth, whereupon silkworms were born. When the time for silkworms came, a beautiful woman arrived at night, calling herself the Guest’s wife and explaining the state of the silkworms. The Guest tended them with her, yielding one hundred and twenty cocoons, each as large as a jar. Unwinding a single cocoon took sixty days to complete. When the task was done, they departed together, and none knew their whereabouts. Thus, the people of Jiyang established a shrine to the silkworm, erecting a temple in its honor. Some say he was of the Jiyang family of Chenliu.

How splendid was the Garden Guest,
His countenance radiant as morning blossoms.
He drew in the essence of the Dao above,
And below, held the five petals.
Fragrant blooms in profusion,
Resplendent patterned moths.
A virtuous maiden descended at night,
Matched in virtue, they ascended afar.

**Deerskin Elder**
Deerskin Elder was a man of Zichuan. In his youth, he served as a minor carpenter in the prefectural office, able to craft implements with a mere gesture. Atop Mount Cen lay a divine spring, inaccessible to ordinary men.

The minor clerk reported to the prefect, requesting thirty carpenters with axes to construct a revolving wheel and suspended pavilion, their ingenuity flowing without end. In several dozen days, ladders and pathways took shape on all four sides. Ascending to the summit, they built a shrine hall, where Deerskin Elder took up residence, severing two of the pathways to secure his solitude. He ate lingzhi mushrooms and drank from the divine spring, dwelling thus for nearly seventy years. When the Zi River rose, he called three times to summon his clansmen and household—over sixty in number—and bade them ascend halfway up the mountain. The floodwaters surged, drowning an entire commandery, with tens of thousands lost. The minor clerk then took leave of his kin, sending them down the mountain. Clad in deerskin robes, he departed, returning once more to the pavilion. Over a hundred years later, he descended to sell medicine in the marketplace.

Deerskin Elder’s inspired thoughts,
His wondrous craft enduring.
The soaring pavilion, suspended in delight,
Embraced above by the divine spring.
Solemn and pure the sacred hall,
Two pathways sealed with care.
Here one may dwell in tranquility,
Here one may attain long years.

**Chang Rong**
Chang Rong was a Daoist of Changshan. She claimed to be a descendant of the Yin kings. Feeding on the roots of bindweed, she wandered up and down the mountains. Those who saw her over two hundred years found her complexion still like that of a woman of twenty. She gathered purple grass, selling it to dyers to earn money, which she gave to orphans and widows. She lived thus through the ages, with tens of thousands honoring her shrine.

The Yin maiden forgot glory,
No lingering attachments remained.
She nurtured her gentle countenance,
Transforming her radiant bearing.
Her heart moved with the changes,
Her days tempered by qi.
Sitting beyond rare treasures,
She bestowed kindness upon the orphaned and lowly.

**Valley Elder**
Valley Elder was a man of Yong in Nanjun. Dwelling in the mountains, an immortal often stayed at his home. Once, when he went to buy melons, the immortal taught him to refine melon seeds, storing them with cassia, aconite, and angelica seeds, dividing them equally. After eating them for over twenty years, he gained the ability to run swiftly and ascend mountains or enter water as if walking on land. More than a hundred years later, he lived atop a remote mountain peak. He called to the elders below in the valley, recounting events from his earlier days. He said:

Valley Elder sought but one thing—
to dwell in the secluded valley.
Below, he gazed upon clear streams;
above, dense vines and creeping moss enshrouded him.
An immortal guest lodged with him,
guiding him with secret texts.
His form transcended dust and mist,
yet his heart remained in the old customs.

**Mountain Chart**
Mountain Chart was a man of Longxi. In his youth, he loved riding horses, but one threw him and broke his leg. A mountain Daoist taught him to take a powder of rehmannia, angelica, notopterygium, tu-huo, and sophora, and after a year of taking it, he lost his appetite for food, his ailment healed, and his body grew light. He pursued the Daoist and questioned him, who said he was a messenger of the Five Peaks sent to gather herbs from famous mountains. "Follow me," he said, "and I will make you immortal." Mountain Chart followed him for over sixty years. One day, he returned home to observe mourning for his mother. After the mourning period, he departed again, and none knew where he went.

Mountain Chart bore suffering,
through ruin attaining wholeness.
Receiving qi to animate his body,
medicine lightened his fate, extending his years.
He inscribed his grief on the wutong tree,
yet Heaven’s love still bound him.
After several cycles, he ascended on high,
forever severed from the world’s green.

**Valley Spring**
Valley Spring was a man of Liyang. During Emperor Cheng’s reign, he served as a Gentleman of the Palace, but fell ill and died—though his body did not grow cold. His family held the funeral and donned mourning robes, yet dared not seal the coffin. Three years later, he donned his cap and sash again and sat at the county gate. The townspeople were greatly alarmed. His family came to fetch him, but he refused to return home.

The coffin was opened, revealing garments but no corpse. He remained at the gate for three nights, then departed for Chang’an, where he stayed at the Heng Gate. People recognized him and pursued him to bring him back. He then left again for Mount Taibai, where a shrine was established upon the mountain. At times, he would come and stay overnight in his own shrine.

After Valley Spring’s death, his body remained warm. The coffin lay sealed for five years before he appeared at the gate in full court attire. Gazing upon the empty casket, his form had vanished—only his robes remained. He left his traces on Mount Taibai, drawing in the primal root of qi.

**Yin Sheng**
Yin Sheng was a beggar beneath the Wei Bridge in Chang’an. He often begged in the marketplace, but the people grew weary and tormented him, dousing him with filth. Yet when he returned to the alleys, his clothes remained as clean as before. The magistrates, learning of this, seized and beat him, binding him in stocks, but he soon reappeared in the marketplace begging. They shackled him again, intending to kill him, and only then did he depart. The household of those who had defiled him collapsed of its own accord, killing over ten people. Thus arose a saying in Chang’an: *"See a beggar, give fine wine, to spare your house from ruin."*

Yin Sheng, the beggar—people loathed his persistence. Few recognized his true nature, and he endured repeated imprisonment and humiliation. Even the men of Huaiyin forgot their stinginess—how much more should we, of the immortal lineage? Spurning evil brought calamity upon their own homes.

**Mao Nü**
Mao Nü, styled Yujian, dwelled in the mountains of Huayin. Hunters of successive generations had seen her—a figure covered in body hair. She claimed to have been a palace woman of the First Emperor of Qin. When the Qin fell, she fled into the mountains to escape disaster. There she encountered the Daoist Valley Spring, who taught her to eat pine needles. Thereafter, she knew neither hunger nor cold, and her body became as light as if she could fly. For over one hundred seventy years, the sound of her zither playing could be heard from the caves where she stayed. She said:

Mao Nü, graceful as jade, adapted and vanished with the times.
A Perfected One bestowed the method—she feasted on pine blossoms and seeds.
From ruin came fulfillment; her life stretched long and blessed.
Delighting in cliffs and peaks, she found joy in zither and lute.

**Zi Ying**
Zi Ying was a man of Shuxiang. Skilled at diving to catch fish, he once netted a red carp. Enamored of its fine color, he carried it home and placed it in his pond, feeding it grains of rice for a year. The carp grew over a *zhang* long, sprouted horns, and grew wings. Zi Ying, astonished, bowed in reverence. The fish spoke: *"I have come to fetch you. Mount my back, and I will bear you to heaven."* At once, a great rain fell. Zi Ying climbed onto the fish’s back, and together they soared away. Year after year, he returned to his old home to eat and drink, visiting his wife and children. The fish would come again to welcome him, and this continued for seventy years. Thus, in Wu, every household carved images of the sacred fish, and a shrine was built to Zi Ying.

Zi Ying loved the water, making his living by roaming and fishing.
A numinous scale came to him, splendid in hue.
He nurtured it, and it grew—horns sprouted, wings unfurled.
Then it bore him on clouded glass, striding beyond the Great Ultimate.

**Fu Lü**
Fu Lü’s origins are unknown.

Fu Lü often stayed in Ju, frequenting the shrines along the seacoast. Once, three immortals were casting melon-seeds in a shrine when they turned and called to him, ordering him to carry several dozen yellow and white melons. They bade him close his eyes, and when he awoke, he found himself on Mount Fangzhang, south of Mount Penglai. Thereafter, he would return to Ju to gather pearls and jade from Mount Fangzhang’s treasures and sell them, which he did for many years. One day, his head was shorn, and he wore a reddish-brown robe, his appearance grown old. When asked, he said it was because he had taken something from the temple. Yet after several years, his countenance became strong and fair again, his temples as dark as before.

Fu Lü inquired of the shrine’s spirits, and the three immortals were their envoys. In a moment’s slumber, he had traversed a thousand *li*. To take treasures and mar one’s form—this was no great shame. Mounting the dragon or riding the phoenix, he roamed free from beginning to end.

**Wen Bin**
Wen Bin was a man of Taiqiu village. He made his living selling straw sandals. He would take a wife, only to abandon her after several decades. Once, an old woman he had once wed lived to over ninety, yet when she saw Bin again, he appeared even more robust than before. The woman bowed to him, weeping, but Bin declined, saying, “This is not fitting. On the morning of the first day of the new year, could you meet me at the western altar of the village shrine?” The old woman, though frail, traveled over ten *li* that night with her children and grandchildren and waited for him at the altar. After a moment, Bin arrived and exclaimed in surprise, “Do you cultivate the Dao?” Had he known, he would not have left her before. He taught her to consume chrysanthemum flowers, *difu*, mistletoe from mulberry trees, and pine nuts to replenish her *qi*. The woman, too, grew strong again, and they lived together for over a hundred more years.

Wen Bin nurtured life, drawing in the mysterious void.
Pine and chrysanthemum served as his sustenance, refining his form to radiant skin.
His former wife, drawn to the Dao, bowed and wept, tottering forward.
He revealed his error and imparted the art, extending her years by a hundred more.

**Shangqiu Zixu**
Shangqiu Zixu was a man of Gaoyi. He enjoyed herding pigs and playing the *yu*. Though seventy years old, he had never married and showed no signs of aging. The villagers marveled at him and sought the Dao from him, asking for its essentials. He replied, “Simply eat the roots of *mujiang* and calamus, drink water, and you will neither hunger nor age.” Thus he passed through the generations, seen for over three hundred years. Nobles and wealthy families heard of this and took the herbs themselves, but none could persist for even a year, soon abandoning them in laziness, saying he must have some hidden protection.

Shangqiu dwelled in seclusion, repaying the casket with wondrous arts.
Thirsty, he drank from cold springs; hungry, he ate calamus roots.
Playing the *yu* while herding pigs, he stood out as extraordinary.
Content in the Dao, he sought nothing, delighting in endless days.

**Zizhu**
Zizhu spoke in the Chu dialect with a delicate voice, and none knew his origins.

He journeyed to the King of Jiangdu, declaring, “Master Ning once looked upon me, and I have been a guest for three hundred years, yet never been granted an audience.” The king took him for a madman. When asked where the master resided, he said, “On the summit of Longmei Mountain.” The king dispatched an officer to ascend the peak, where they found Master Ning—his body covered in hair, his ears broad, his hair unbound as he plucked the zither. Zizhu prostrated before him, and the officer delivered the king’s command. The master said, “This man is the ninth-generation descendant of my former neighbor. Moreover, I foresee three women in your household who will die violently—do not interfere in my affairs.” As his words ended, a great wind arose, and the officer fled down the mountain. By the time he returned, three women in the palace had indeed killed one another. The king sent offerings of the three sacrificial animals to establish a shrine there.

Zizhu retained his youth, his principles grounded in something profound.
The Ning Master’s shrine flourished, his zither echoing on Dragonbrow Peak.
In Dao they found accord, resolving subtle disputes.
With utmost effort in service, he inquired to illuminate his teacher’s wisdom.

**Tao Angong**
Tao Angong was a master smelter of Liu’an. After repeatedly working the furnace, one day the fire scattered, rising in a purple column that pierced the heavens. Angong prostrated beneath the furnace, pleading for mercy. In an instant, a vermilion phoenix alighted upon the cold forge and said, “Angong, Angong, the cold forge communes with heaven. On the seventh day of the seventh month, you shall be fetched by a crimson dragon.” When the appointed day arrived, the red dragon descended amid a great rain. Angong mounted it and soared toward the southeast. The entire city—tens of thousands of people—gathered to see him off, bidding him farewell as one. He said:

Angong stoked the flames, and violet fires blazed with radiant brilliance. A graceful vermilion phoenix arrived, bearing tidings of the appointed hour; resplendent in crimson, it coiled sinuously toward the destined day. The entire city gazed upward, turning back to bid him farewell.

**Chi Fu**
Chi Fu was a man of Barong. He served as registrar of the Green Rooster Shrine. Skilled in refining cinnabar through water tempering, he consumed saltpeter with it for thirty years, reverting to the appearance of a youth—his hair and beard both turned red. Decades later, he ascended Mount Hua to gather *yu yuliang* as provisions, selling them between Cangwu and the Xiang River. For generations, people reported sightings of him. In his palm rested a red axe.

Chi Fu cultivated truth, his hair lustrous in Barong. Dwelling in the divine shrine, he refined cinnabar with devotion. Though his beard gleamed crimson, his face bloomed like a vermilion flower. Gathering herbs on the sacred mountain, he observed transformations in the distant south.

**Hu Zixian**
Hu Zixian was a diviner at the pass of Hanzhong. Over a hundred years old, as he neared his departure, he called to an old tavern woman: “Prepare quickly! I shall accompany you to answer the call of the Prince of Zhongling.” That night, an immortal arrived bearing two straw dogs. Hu Zixian took one and gave the other to the tavern woman; mounting them, they became dragons. They ascended Mount Huayin, where he would often cry out from the summit: “Zixian and the tavern woman are here!”

The Three Spirits moved in hidden resonance, their response as precise as tallying tokens. Side by side, they rode the straw dogs, then sinuously vanished as dragons. Together they scaled the great Hua, proclaiming their worldly manifestation. Those who serve their lords with impropriety shall meet with retribution; those who act with virtue shall receive favor.

**The Master of the Mirror-Carrying Case**
The Master of the Mirror-Carrying Case was of unknown origin. His speech resembled that of the people between Yan and Dai. He often carried a mirror-grinding case through the markets of Wu, polishing mirrors for a single coin. As he ground them, he would ask the owner if they suffered any ailments, then produce a purple pill to give them. All who received it were cured. Thus he lived for decades.

When a great plague later struck, he went from house to house distributing medicine, saving tens of thousands of lives without accepting a single coin. The people of Wu then recognized him as a true transcendent. Later, he took up residence at the edge of a sheer cliff on Mount Wu, lowering medicine down to the people below. As he prepared to depart, he told those below: "I return to Mount Penglai, where I shall send down divine water for you all." One morning, water appeared on the cliff—white in color, flowing down from between the rocks. Many who drank it were cured of their illnesses. Shrines were established in over ten locations in his honor.

The Mirror-Carrying Transcendent, dignified and refined,
Clad in coarse cloth yet radiant with inner grace.
His arts rivaled those of Bian Que,
His heart embraced the cosmos entire.
He drew forth the springs of Penglai,
Pouring them upon these lofty peaks.
Soon to return to Penglai’s isles,
There to attain the lifespan of heaven.

**Zhu Huang**
Zhu Huang was a native of Guangling. In his youth, he suffered from a virulent wasting disease. He sought out Ruan Qiu, a Daoist on Mount Sui. Taking pity on him, Ruan Qiu said: "If you expel the Three Worms from your abdomen, you may cultivate the work of a true transcendent—this can be taught." Zhu Huang replied: "If my illness is cured, I shall serve you as a disciple for thirty years, never daring to return home." Ruan Qiu gave him a seven-ingredient medicine, instructing him to take nine pills daily. After a hundred days, his illness passed in the form of several *dou* of liver- and spleen-like matter. After nursing himself for several dozen days, he grew robust and healthy, his mind and spirit growing ever clearer. Ruan Qiu then gave him the *Scripture of the Yellow Court*, instructing him to read it three times daily until he had mastered it and could contemplate its meaning. Thereafter, Ruan Qiu took Zhu Huang with him into the Jade Maiden Shrine on Mount Fuyang. After eighty years, they returned to their former abode—Zhu Huang’s white hair had turned black, and his temples now bore tresses over three *chi* long. He visited his family to eat, staying for several years before departing again. He remained thus until the end of Emperor Wu’s reign.

Zhu Huang’s infirmity faded,
Fortune and blessing drew near.
The true transcendent administered his medicine,
And the Three Worms were all transformed.
With a heart emptied and spirit luminous,
He soared to praise in the unseen realms.
His hair, once hoary, turned black,
Transcending to attain long life.

**Huang Ruan Qiu**
Huang Ruan Qiu was a Daoist on Mount Sui. Clad in furs with unbound hair, his ears measured seven *cun* in length, and his mouth was toothless. He could walk four hundred *li* in a day.

On the mountain, he cultivated scallions and lotuses for over a hundred years, unknown to others. Occasionally descending to sell medicine, Zhu Huang revealed his presence, and only then did people recognize him as a divine transcendent. When earthquakes or landslides severed the paths, he would forewarn those below, and the world revered him with sacrifices.

Amidst the misty peaks of scallion-clad cliffs,
He made his dwelling in truth.
Clad in furs with unbound hair,
His light steps surpassed all bounds.
Embracing the Dao to nurture life,
His wondrous insight pierced the unseen.
Zhu Huang bore witness to his power,
And warned the people below.

**Nü Wan**
Nü Wan was a woman who sold wine in the market of Chen. Her brew was always exquisite. Once, an immortal passed her home to drink, leaving behind five scrolls of the *Plain Book* as collateral. Wan opened and read them, discovering methods for nurturing vitality and harmonizing union. Secretly transcribing their essentials, she arranged chambers to welcome young men, offering fine wine and lodging, practicing the techniques from the text. Thus, for thirty years, her complexion remained as youthful as a woman of twenty.

Years later, the immortal returned and, laughing, said to Wan: *"Stealing the Dao without a master, you have wings yet do not fly."* Thereupon, she abandoned her home to follow the immortal, and none knew where they went.

The essentials of the *Mysterious and Plain* lie near, drawn from the body itself.
Peng Pin grasped them, and five scrolls were set forth.
Nü Wan harbored their wonders; an immortal guest arrived.
Pouring out the texts, she spread their teachings—together they soared beyond the dust.

**Lingyang Ziming**
Lingyang Ziming was a man of Quan Village. Fond of fishing, he once hooked a white dragon in the whirling stream of Xuan Brook. Terrified, Ziming loosened the hook, bowed, and released it. Later, he caught a white fish whose belly contained a book, teaching him the methods of ingesting and consuming elixirs. Ziming then ascended Mount Huang, where he gathered the five mineral fats and boiled them in water to ingest. After three years, a dragon came to welcome him away, and he dwelled on Mount Lingyang for over a hundred years. The mountain rose over a thousand *zhang* above the earth; he would call down to those below, bidding them ascend halfway up the slope. He told them that a man named Zi’an from the stream would come, and asked whether Ziming’s fishing cart still remained. Over twenty years later, Zi’an died, and people buried him beneath Stone Mountain. A yellow crane came to perch in the tree beside his tomb, crying out Zi’an’s name.

Lingyang cast his line, the white dragon took the hook.
At last he gained the auspicious fish, and the numinous script guided his cultivation.
Five minerals steeped in water, he ascended the mountain riding the rainbow.
When Zi’an indeed perished, what did the crying crane seek?

**Hanzi**
Hanzi claimed to be a man of Shu.

Hanzi delighted in setting his hound free. Once, the dog ran into a mountain cavern, and Hanzi followed it in, spending over ten nights within, traversing several hundred *li*. Emerging atop the mountain, he found terraces, halls, and palaces, with verdant pines standing dense and tall, and immortal officials standing guard in strict array. There, he saw his former wife, who was washing fish, and she gave Hanzi a sealed talisman and medicine, bidding him return and deliver them to Magistrate Qiao of Chengdu. When Magistrate Qiao opened the seal, he found fish roe within. He placed them in a pond, and after a year, they all took the form of dragons. The talisman was then sent back to the mountain. The hound’s coat turned crimson, and it grew long wings, ever accompanying Hanzi in his comings and goings. After over a hundred years, Hanzi remained on the mountain, descending only at times to protect his clan. The people of Shu built a shrine at the cavern’s mouth, where the sounds of drums and pipes and voices calling out were often heard. For thousands of *li* to the southwest, all revered this shrine.

Hanzi, in pursuit of his hound,
entered the immortal cavern’s ground.
Towering halls stood grand and bright,
rows of pines in verdant height.
Talisman and medicine he received,
to and fro his ties he weaved.
At last he dwelled on peaks divine,
where echoes rang in tones sublime.

Muyu

Muyu was a man of Nanheping Township in Julu. His mother, poor and lowly, worked as a midwife. Once, while attending a birth, she reached for the newborn, who at once opened its eyes, gazed at her, and laughed aloud. Terrified, she dreamed that night of a man in a tall hat and red robes standing guard over the child, saying: “This is the Lord of Life. He shall repay your kindness, and your son Muyu shall attain immortality.” His mother secretly believed and remembered this. Later, when she bore a son, she named him Muyu. The child she had delivered turned fifteen, when one night a carriage and horses arrived to take him away. Passing by his mother’s home, they called out: “Muyu, Muyu, come and be our driver!” Then they all departed together. Over twenty years later, a stork delivered a two-*chi* fish to his mother’s door at dawn. She hid it and told no one, selling the fish instead. After thirty years, he vanished entirely. His mother lived to be a hundred before she passed away.

The Lord of Life manifested his numinous power, and the mother was struck with terror. Thus was her kindness repaid, though the covenant remained unfulfilled. When the Dao had ripened through the three and five phases, a light-drawn chariot came to fetch him by night. In the end, virtue was requited, and she attained a distant, enduring lifespan.

Xuan Su
Xuan Su claimed to be a man of Hejian. He ingested croton beans and sold medicine in the marketplace—seven pills for a single coin, curing all ailments. The Prince of Hejian suffered from emaciation; after purchasing and taking the medicine, he passed more than ten serpents. When asked the principle behind the remedy, Su explained: “The prince’s affliction was the lingering calamity of six generations of accumulated misfortune, not something he himself had incurred.” The prince had once released a nursing doe—his own mother in a former life—his benevolence moving Heaven, and thus he was destined to encounter Su.

An elder retainer of the prince’s household said his father had seen Su in past generations, and that Su cast no shadow. The prince summoned Su at midday to observe him, and indeed, no shadow appeared. The prince wished to betroth his daughter to him, but Su fled by night. Later, he was seen beneath Mount Chang. His substance was void, his shadow vanished—such was Xuan Su in his time.

He spread virtue through divine pills, redeeming his debt through the doe. His Dao flourished in Hejian, where royal favor was deep and intimate. Unrestrained by soaring dragons, he transcended all bounds.

**Eulogy:**
The *Book of Changes* speaks of the Great Ultimate, from which the Two Modes arise. Once the Two Modes are born, then come the people. With the people, life and death follow. The meaning of life and death is thus made manifest.

All things unfold in boundless profusion, merging into oneness, nothing left unprovided. How wondrous, how subtle, how refined, how minute—such matters cannot be exhaustively discussed one by one. The sage, looking up, observes the patterns of Heaven; looking down, he examines the models of Earth. The sun and moon move in their courses; the four seasons govern in turn. The five planets are regulated by the Supreme Subtlety, overseeing the wayward states, foretelling fortune and misfortune to warn the lords of the land. Movement and stillness, speech and response—correspondences flow in harmony, as they have since ancient times.

Though Heaven does not speak, its transformations and deeds cannot be called nonexistent. The *Preface to the Book of Zhou* records that Sangjiao asked Master Juan: “There is death, yet there are also those who speak of divine transcendents—are these two things both true?” Master Juan replied: “They can indeed both be true.”

The *Canon of Filial Piety in Aid of the Numinous* states: “Beyond Heaven and Earth, the numinous pervades the void, just as the Five Peaks are established and the Three Terraces are set. The yang essence governs the outer, the yin essence governs the inner; qi ascends and descends, weaving through all beings. The Dao’s governance is not singular.”

As for plants and trees, they surely sprout in spring and wither in autumn—yet among trees there are pines, parasols, cedars, sandalwoods, and over a hundred and eighty other kinds; among grasses there are lingzhi, floating fruit, spirit ponds, Solomon’s seal, white talismans, bamboo shoots, and fire-warding herbs—tens of thousands that live long and never die. In the depths of winter, enduring frost and snow, they flourish without fading. If such things exist in this class, why marvel at the existence of transcendents?

I once obtained the *Chart of Transcendents* compiled by Ruan Cang, a grandee of Qin, which records over seven hundred individuals from the Six Dynasties to the present. The First Emperor was fond of seeking transcendence, and though he nearly succeeded, the magicians gathered like mist, their prayers and sacrifices spreading far and wide. Most likely, they relied on the near to fabricate the distant, turning emptiness into substance—such things cannot be trusted.

Yet the *Yellow Register* of the Duke of Zhou records that the planet Venus descended to become a duke, and that the planet Jupiter transformed into the Duke of Ningshou, among other such accounts, not confined to a single source. The sages did not expound on such matters because they are without constancy. Nevertheless, though they sometimes manifest, the Dao cannot be abandoned. To reject and seal them away is still to uphold correctness.

As the *Analects* says of “the strange, the forceful, the chaotic, and the numinous,” its subtle purport may be discerned.

*Accounts of Transcendents, Scroll the Lower, concludes.*
