---

The Perfected One of Purple Yang, by original surname Zhou, bore the personal name Yishan and the style Jitong, and was a native of Ruyin. He was the seventh-generation descendant of Zhou Bo, Chancellor of the Han. As a distinguished clan of renown, his family had long held noble office. His grandfather, Xuan, served as Inspector of Qingzhou in the first year of the Yuanfeng era. His father, Mi, was Magistrate of Fanyang, and it was at this time that the Perfected One was born. Later, his father accumulated ranks and promotions, rising to the position of Prefectural Scribe of Chenliu. At the age of sixteen, the Perfected One followed his father to the prefecture, where he began studying the *Classic of Filial Piety*, the *Analects*, and the *Book of Changes*.

In temperament, he was grave and reserved, sparing of speech and laughter, his joy and anger never showing on his face. He favored sitting alone in quietude, forming no attachments to fame or favor. Yet his thoughts were subtle and precise, and whatever he contemplated invariably came to pass. Each day, after the first light of dawn and at the first rising of the sun, he would stand facing due east, rinse his mouth, swallow his saliva, and perform breathing exercises a hundred times, then bow twice toward the sun. He did this every morning without fail for years on end.

His father, finding this strange, asked him: "What is this practice you engage in?" The Perfected One knelt in reply: "Yishan delights in the radiance of this long and enduring sunlight, and so I bow to it." On the first day of each lunar month, he would wander through the markets and the narrow lanes of the common folk, and whenever he saw the poor and starving, he would remove his own clothes and give them away. Often, he would ascend famous mountains, sighing in sorrow, or enter stone chambers, laughing alone in delight.

At that time, many eminent scholars in Chenliu, hearing of the Perfected One’s profound virtue and his deep, refined nature, all sought to visit him. Yet he would always claim illness and refuse to receive guests. Cai Cheng, a Han Attendant Gentleman and a lofty scholar of Chenliu who had some understanding of the Dao, heard of the Perfected One’s conduct and repeatedly sought to visit him. Each time, the Perfected One declined on grounds of illness, unwilling to meet him. His father, greatly perplexed, grew angry and pressed him sternly to go out. Only under duress did he finally consent to receive Cai Cheng.

When the assembled scholars posed their questions and discussed the Way of divine transcendents and the affairs of transformation, the Perfected One remained silent, his spirit inwardly withdrawn, his mind empty and still. He merely nodded in response, never uttering a word. That year, a great drought struck Chenliu, causing severe famine; a *dou* of grain cost a thousand coins, and starving refugees filled the roads. The Perfected One then exhausted his family’s wealth to relieve their suffering. He acted in secret, and none knew that it was his compassionate aid they received. Toward all beings, he was as tender as if they were newborn infants—such was the hidden accumulation of his virtuous and benevolent deeds.

There was also a man named Huang Tai, who resided in Chenliu. He had no wife or children, lived alone, and had no relatives; no one knew whence he came. He always wore tattered leather trousers and a patched leather jacket, and sold straw sandals in the Chenliu market. The Perfected One often passed through the market in secret and saw that Huang Tai’s clothing was exceptionally threadbare. He had once heard from esoteric texts on transcendence that the pupils of a transcendent’s eyes are perfectly square. Though Huang Tai’s outward appearance was unkempt, his eyes were square and radiant. The Perfected One secretly admired this and rejoiced inwardly.

Upon returning home, he repeatedly sent servants to buy straw sandals, concealing gold, silver, coins, and silk within them before giving them to Huang Tai. He did this many times. Eventually, Huang Tai came to visit the Perfected One, who welcomed him with a bow and led him into a quiet chamber. There, Huang Tai revealed himself to be a transcendent of Mount Song. He said: "I have heard that you are devoted to the Dao, that your hidden virtues flow far and wide, and that your thoughts are subtle and wondrous, moving even me. Thus, I have come to see you. I am Su Lin, styled Zixuan, a transcendent of Mount Song. I was originally from Wei and was born in the final years of Duke Ling. From youth, I loved the Dao and the virtue, and studied under Master Cen."

Master Cen taught me the near arts of refining the body and dispelling calamities. Later, I was again transmitted to Master Qiu, who instructed me in the methods of ingesting qi and the practices of returning the spirit and guarding the hun-soul. I practiced these with great efficacy and reaped immense benefit. Master Qiu then told me: "This is the extent of my knowledge. It cannot enable you to ascend to heaven in broad daylight and become a true official above. I shall introduce you to Master Juan."

Master Juan was a transcendent of the middle rank. After I served him for over a year, he taught me the method of guarding the Three Ones, saying: "The Three Ones are the Mysterious True of the Grand Tenuity, the Primordial Chart of the Highest Clarity. The first is the *Dongzhen* (Cavern of Perfection), the second the *Miaojing* (Wondrous Scripture), and the third the *Suling* (Pure Numinosity). The Lord of the Eastern Sea’s Lesser Lad conceals them within the City of Numinous Radiance and the Chamber of Jade Clarity. They are not transmitted except to those listed in the registers of transcendents. These texts are profound and recondite; they must not be revealed to the unworthy. Yet you possess utmost sincerity, and so I entrust them to you. If you store them within at the eight solar nodes, one effect will be the elimination of all harm, and another the preservation of your corporeal form. If you can guard them, you will summon cloud chariots and feathered canopies, sit and command wind and rain, and stir lightning and thunder. These are the finest arts of earthbound transcendents and the true methods of attaining long life."

Having received these teachings, I was able to roam the famous mountains, come and go from the Hall of Square Cauldrons, rest upon the Crimson Mound, gaze across the eight wilds, and dwell where I pleased. For hundreds of years, I found contentment in such freedom, yet even contentment must yield to change. To remain thus without progression would be to defy the transformations of heaven and the ebb and flow of time. Thus, I cast myself into the foul and turbid world to observe its clamor and chaos. Selling sandals and plying humble crafts, I dwelt among the lowly, considering myself no more than ordinary, unable to discern the vermilion and azure hidden within the common dust. Yet you alone possessed the discernment to recognize the true, and repeatedly bestowed gifts upon me—something I had not anticipated. Delighted by your aspirations, I have come to visit you."

The Perfected One bowed repeatedly, knocking his head to the ground dozens of times, his joy and sorrow mingling as he crawled forward on his knees. He declared: "From youth, I have loved long life and yearned to ascend as a transcendent and cross beyond this world. Day and night, I have meditated in stillness, wishing to encounter a true person, bathe in the pure stream, and receive wondrous instructions. Now, by divine revelation and numinous descent, I have been granted the sight of your sacred countenance. The aspirations of a thousand autumns are fulfilled—no greater joy could exist!" He again kowtowed, entreating the transcendent for essential secrets.

The transcendent said: "Sit, and I shall tell you. From your youth, you have known how to return to yang, preserving your essence and marrow without leakage. You also know the arts of guiding and pulling and ingesting qi, swallowing radiance and sipping nectar, so you no longer require the benefits of inner alchemy or the replenishment of the fetal breath. However, the Three Worms remain unharmed, and the Three Corpses are not yet dead; thus, your practice of guiding and pulling and ingesting qi has not attained its principle. You must first take the refined pills to subdue the grain worms. These worms have three names: the first is Green Ancient, the second White Maiden, and the third Blood Corpse—they are called the Three Worms. Dwelling within, they cause the heart to be vexed and full, the will to be obstructed, thoughts to be unstable, and hunger to arise upon missing a meal. Grief and sorrow disturb you, your essence and will falter, and this is due to immoderate eating and drinking. Even if you abstain from grains, the body grows heavy and sluggish, listless and dull. Your dreams are unreal, confused and disordered, and worldly defilements persist—all because the worms within agitate the five viscera.

The method to kill them is as follows: use five *liang* of aconite, seven *sheng* of hemp seeds, six *liang* of rehmannia, a seven-inch segment of the largest evodia root, seven *liang* of atractylodes, four *liang* of cinnamon, and five *liang* of cloud fungus—seven ingredients in total. First, take calamus root, boil it to make a sweet wine, ensuring it is clear, rich, and mellow, to a volume of one and a half *dou*. Place the seven ingredients, roughly chopped (or left whole), into a vessel and steep them in the wine. After three nights, remove and dry them in the sun. Then steep them again in the same wine for another three nights, remove, and dry once more. Repeat until the wine is exhausted. Dry the ingredients thoroughly, then grind them in an iron mortar, sift into a fine powder, and mix with white honey to form pills.

At dawn, face east and begin by taking two pills the size of small beans. Gradually increase by one pill, up to ten or more. This will cure abdominal ailments, fullness and rising qi, blockages in the chest, and benefit the flesh, making the body light and imparting a radiant glow. After finishing one course, the grain worms will die, and with their death, the Three Corpses will wither and naturally fall away. You may prepare this remedy multiple times without limit to one course.

Next, prepare the Four-Filling Pills, adding one *liang* each of azurite and polygonatum. This will enable you to abstain from grains. Once completed, you may practice guiding and pulling and ingesting qi. If you still do not grasp its principle, you may first consume various herbs: sesame, poria, atractylodes, cinnamon, asparagus, coptis, rehmannia, rhubarb, peach kernels, and their skins—choose as you see fit. Though these medicines may grant you strength, without the Way of the Nine-Turned Divine Elixir and Golden Liquid, you cannot become a flying transcendent. They can only extend your years and prolong your life, not avert death.

Proceed step by step. After consuming atractylodes for five years, your body will emanate a radiant glow, and you will see clearly within, perceiving the five viscera. Then seek the essential instructions for flying transcendence from a transcendent.

The transcendent continued: "There are several kinds of medicines and several ranks of transcendents. Some ride clouds and drive dragons, ascending to heaven in broad daylight, befriending the Perfected of the Great Ultimate, and being appointed as lords of transcendent offices—such as Controller of Perfected, Arbiter of the Primordial, Lord of Great Life, the Grand Master of the Central Yellow, the Nine Qi Venerable, and the Duke of the Transcendent Capital. These are all high transcendents. Some become Transcendent Ministers or Transcendent Grand Masters, ranking just below the high transcendents. They roam the Five Peaks, journey to the Great Clarity, and command ghosts and spirits—these are middle transcendents. Some are enfeoffed with a mountain and govern its ghosts and spirits, or roam the Lesser Existence and gather in the Palace of Pure Emptiness—these rank below the middle transcendents. Those who eat grains yet do not die, casting no shadow at noon, are low transcendents."

Some achieve transcendence through *shijie* at midday, passing through death into the Great Yin before attaining immortality—this ranks below the low transcendents.

I received the secret essentials from Master Juan, mastering the Dao of guarding the Three Ones, commanding ghosts and spirits, and receiving the true seal of the Lord of the Great Ultimate to govern a sacred mountain and attain deathlessness. This is also the foremost of the Golden Watchtower Lord’s true scriptures, the great formula of all wonders. Yet my learning is shallow, and I have only become an earthbound transcendent.

Your name is inscribed in the Golden Book within the Palace of the Square Cauldron, and you are commanded to ascend the Azure Register as a character—what is called "golden gates and jade names" has already been decreed in the celestial bureaus. You will surely ride clouds and drive dragons to ascend to the Purple Yang and Great Clarity, donning the Dragon Robe of Golden Truth and the Tiger Belt of Jade Radiance, and be enfeoffed as a Perfected One. My arts are only fit to teach those who achieve *shijie* as land transcendents, not one such as you, a true Perfected. Moreover, I am but a middle transcendent and unworthy to be your master.

Yet guarding the One and refining the spirit, though not the Dao of the highest Perfected, is still a fine practice for middle Perfected and earthbound transcendents. It allows you to summon the spirits of a thousand mountains, gather the essences of rivers and marshes, exhale the old beneath the Seven Flowers, and inhale the new above the Three Offices. You may pay homage to the Red Child, visit the Perfected, and revere the Divine Infant.

The Three Perfected are the lords dwelling within the body’s abode. They blend the twenty-four *qi*, dividing and entering the Supreme Subtlety, and are further distinguished as the Twenty-Four Perfected. If you master this Dao within the space of three inches, the Perfected Ones of the Three Palaces will become visible. Once seen, cloud chariots and feathered canopies, a thousand carriages and ten thousand riders, will appear, and you may ride them. Your name will be listed in the Nine Charts, and you will soar into the Highest Clarity.

For the Upper Origin, use the advent of spring, returning from the Eastern Dipper. For the Middle Origin, use the advent of summer, returning from the Southern Dipper. For the Lower Origin, use the advent of winter, returning from the Northern Dipper. As the three *qi* ascend, the body is preserved with them. The four solar nodes mark the cycle of their departure and return.

The method is rare, its application vast; its practice is near, its life ever-growing. If you attain this Dao, you may transform in myriad ways, emerge unscathed from water and fire, bind tigers and leopards, and command ghosts and spirits. You, too, should know this Dao to gradually ascend.

Now I transmit to you two hundred matters from *The Method of Guarding the Three Ones* and *The Wondrous Lesser Existence Scriptures*. Take the stone fungus, cinnabar stalks, and sundry mushrooms—I have imparted all my Dao.

I do not test you. I shall soon be summoned to the Dark Continent for thirty days. When I return, I will visit you to enlighten what you have not yet grasped. Go now and seek a distant master.

If you truly wish to master the profound wonders of the Dao and plumb its subtlest mysteries, you must endure hardship and peril, roaming the Five Peaks. Even if you encounter a Perfected One, they will not immediately teach you the true Dao. Before a hundred years pass, you will not obtain cloud chariots, feathered canopies, or robes of dragons and tigers.

You bowed twice to receive the teaching, then retired to fast, bathing in five fragrances for seven days and nights without sleep. You sat upright, hands clasped, meditating on the supreme Dao. At dawn, you burned incense, faced north, bowed twice, and consumed the divine mushrooms. Within five years, you could see a thousand *li* away. Your body grew light, able to leap ten *zhang* and walk five hundred *li* in a day. You could conceal or reveal yourself, sit or stand at will. You could traverse sacred mountains in search of transcendents.

Hearing of Master Luan, who had attained the Dao on Mount Meng and could recite the *Dragon-Striding Scripture*, you sought him out. Entering the Yellow Court Grotto of Mount Meng’s great cavern, you encountered Master Yanmen riding a white deer, holding a feathered canopy and a staff of green-furred jade, attended by over ten jade maidens. You bowed twice, kowtowing, and begged for the essentials of longevity.

Master Yanmen said: "Your name is recorded in the Cinnabar Terrace—why fear you will not become a transcendent? The Pure Void Grotto Palace of Mount Wangwu teems with transcendents. You are but a novice—you should ascend this mountain. Why seek elsewhere?"

You replied: "I heard that Master Luan attained the Dao on this mountain and can recite the *Dragon-Striding Scripture*. I came to meet him and receive it."

Master Yanmen said: "Master Luan is but a low transcendent. You are a Perfected One. To ask a transcendent about the true Dao—is this not needless? When you meet a Perfected One, they will be your master. Those below middle transcendents are not fit for your study." He then presented you with the *Dragon-Striding Scripture* and the *Inner Writings of the Three Sovereigns* to summon spirits and subdue ghosts.

You retired to Mount Shaoshi for three months, then journeyed to Mount Wangwu, opening its grotto gate and entering the cinnabar chamber, where you encountered many transcendents, all clad in white, reading scriptures. They rose upon seeing you. Master Zhao Tazi bestowed upon you the *Mushroom Charts* in sixteen scrolls and the *Secret Talismans of the Five Phases* before you retired to fast.

Returning to Mount Wangwu, you met Master Huang, who transmitted the *Yellow Plain Divine Prescriptions*, the *Five Emperors and Six Jias*, and the *Left and Right Numinous Flights* in forty-four formulas. You then ascended Mount Fanchong, where you met Lord Wei, who transmitted the *Great Plain Tradition of the Left Yi’s Chaotic Eastern Meng Register* and the *Right Geng’s Plain Writings of Subduing and Slaying*.

After fasting for three months, you ascended Mount Songgao and entered its grotto gate. There, you encountered the Central Yellow Venerable Lord touring the cinnabar city, traversing the grotto court, and convening with transcendents within the Great Chamber Grotto of Mount Songgao. They were sheltered by a canopy of purple clouds, resting on beds of supple jade, clad in phoenix robes and divine crowns, bearing true seals and staffs. On their left hung bells of flowing gold, on their right, the Eight Radiant Writs. Divine tigers flanked the grotto gate, and numinous hounds guarded the Great Chamber. To their left stood the Pure and True Lads, to their right the Great Harmony Jade Maidens, each over a hundred in number, bearing cups of divine nectar. They chanted the *Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Great Grotto True Scripture*, recited the *Twenty-Four Chapters of the Great Possession Wondrous Scripture*, and performed the *Twenty-One Melodies of the Supreme Plain and Numinous*.

Within its central courtyard stood Jade Maidens of the Azure Waist, bearing the Dark Jade Lamp of the Southern Thunder, scattering blossoms and burning incense to attend the Yellow and Old Lord. The Yellow and Old Lord wore the Three-Flowered Nine-Solar Turban, his hands plucking the flowing notes of the Cloud-Pearl Lute of Plain Silk. Clad in robes of golden radiance, his celestial bearing was stern, his eyes flashing with lightning essence, his mouth holding jade balm.

The Lord prostrated himself and bowed twice, entreating long life and deliverance from the world, wishing to ascend and assist the transcendents. The Yellow and Old Lord asked: "Have you dwelt within the Grotto Chamber and seen the White Prime Lord?"

The Lord replied: "I have indeed dwelt within the Grotto Chamber and once beheld the White Prime Lord."

The Yellow and Old Lord said: "Your Dao is not yet sufficient. First wander and receive all essential instructions, and then I shall bestow upon you the scriptures of the Supreme Perfected Dao. You have seen the White Prime Lord but not the Peerless Lord—go forth again."

The Lord bowed twice to receive the teaching, then prostrated himself once more, begging to attend and escort the Dragon Chariot as a courier of the wanderings. The Yellow and Old Lord said: "Within the Grotto Chamber, at the heart of the utmost essence, there is a great spirit beyond naming. At peace, it emerges from the Purple Chamber, sporting within the Cinnabar Field, ascending to connect with the Supreme Microcosm, then descending to penetrate the Mysterious Darkness. The Lesser Existence is the White Prime Lord; the Greater Existence is the Peerless Lord. To see the White Prime Lord is the affair of lesser transcendents—you may live three thousand years. But to see the Peerless Lord is to be truly perfected—you may live ten thousand years. Refine yourself further and dwell upon this; I shall not test you now."

The Lord bowed twice, received the teaching, and withdrew. He wandered through the famous mountains and great marshes of the world. Westward he ascended White Void Mountain, where he encountered Master Bo of the Sandy Wilderness and received the *Supreme Clarity Upper Scripture*. Retreating, he ascended Mount Emei, entered the Golden Treasury of the Central Void Grotto, and met Master Ning, from whom he received the *Eight Principles and Ten Instructions of the Concealed Book of the Great Cinnabar*. Retreating again, he ascended Mount Min and met Master Yin, receiving the *Nine Vermilion Talismans*. Then he ascended Mount Qi, where he met Zang Yanfu and received the *Plain Instructions on Sorrow and Joy*. Next he ascended Mount Liang, where he met the Perfected Lord of Huainan and received the *Three Charts of the Celestial Pass*. Retreating once more, he ascended Oxhead Mountain, where he met Zhang Zifang and received the *True Scripture of the Supreme Clarity*. Then he ascended Mount Jiuyi, where he met Li Boyang and received the *Li Clan’s Esoteric Scripture*. Wandering onward, he ascended Mount Zhong, where he met Master Gaoqiu and received the *Twenty-Seven Prescriptions of the Golden Elixir*. Then he ascended Mount Heming, where he met Lord Yang’an and received the *Scripture of the Golden Liquid Elixir* and the *Chart of the Nine Cauldrons’ Divine Elixir*. Next he ascended Mount Meng, where he met Master Azure Essence and received the *Yellow Plain Transmission*. Then he ascended Mount Luhun, stealthily entered the grotto chamber of the Yi River, and met Li Zi’er, from whom he received the *Eight Arts of the Hidden Earth*. Ascending Mount Rong, he met Zhao Boxuan and received the *Three-Nine Plain Sayings*. Then he ascended Mount Yangluo, where he met Lord Young Yang and received the *Azure Essentials and Purple Writ* and the *Three-Five Sequential Practices*. Next he ascended Mount Huo, where he met the Lord of Destiny and received the *Green Chart of Life* and the *Records of the Supreme August Ancestor*. Ascending Mount Bird-and-Mouse, he met Master Mo Di and received the *Central Scripture of the Inner Vision Chart of the Purple Flaming Radiance*. Then he ascended Radiant Name Mountain, where he met the Divine Lad Who Awaits the Night for the Supreme Thearch and received the *Scripture of the Golden Root*. Ascending Mount Weiyu, he met Sima Jizhu and received the *Stone Essence and Golden Radiance of the Concealed Light’s Transformative Form*. Then he ascended Great Courtyard Mountain, where he met Liu Zixian and received the *Sevenfold Divine Arts of Transformation*. Ascending the Towering Tree at Duguang, he met Master Gu Xi and received the arts of the Yellow Qi, the techniques of the Great Void, and the essentials of the Three Paths of Solar Essence. Ascending Mount Tongbo, he met Wang Qiao and received the *Plain Memorial Talismans of Cinnabar*. Then he ascended Mount Taihua, where he met Master Red Pine of the Southern Marchmount and received the *True Book of the Upper Prime*. Ascending Mount Great Obscurity, he met the Nine Elder Transcendent Lords of the Divine Metropolis and received the *Four Perfected Arts of the Yellow Water and Moonlight*. Arriving at Mount Heli, he met the August Personage and received the *Scripture of the Eight Plain Perfected* and the *Concealed Writ of the Supreme*. Ascending Mount Jing, he met Master Wanbi of the Yellow Terrace and received the *Central Scripture of the Nine Perfected*. Arriving at the Wilderness of the Dark Dragon’s Plumage, he met ten Jade Lads and the Nine Qi Venerable, obtaining the *Method of the White Plumage and Purple Canopy for Robing in the Yellow Water and Moonlight*. Reaching the Mulberry Grove, he ascended Mount Fuguang, where he met the Azure Perfected Lad and received the *Secret Characters of the Golden Writ*. Retreating southward to Vermilion Fire, he ascended Mount Danling, where he met Gong Zhongyang and received the *True Records of the Transcendent Taboos*. Westward he journeyed, ascending Void Mountain, and beheld the Peerless Lord within the western chamber of the Grotto Chamber.

There, the Peerless Lord stood to the left, the White Prime Lord to the right, and the Yellow and Old Lord in the center. The Peerless Lord was clad in brocade of golden essence, a robe of vermilion and azure jade silk, his radiance like the dawn glow, his flowing light illuminating the heavens. At his waist hung the insignia of the Supreme Numinous Qi, at his side the Nine-Chaptered Tally for Dispelling Evil. Upon his head he wore the Purple Dragon Crown of Emerald, for he was the ancestral father of the Supreme Prime and the Red Child of the Great Mystery. To his left he circulated the qi of the Azure Palace, his qi irrigating the myriad spirits—before heaven and earth existed, he had already arisen from the Void.

The White Prime Lord was clad in brocade of cinnabar jade and layered robes of cloud gauze, his white radiance inwardly vermilion, his flowing light piercing the heavens, his descending brilliance illuminating the spirits, his dark and yellow hues penetrating the Void. At his waist hung the insignia of the Supreme Numinous Essence, at his side the Tally of the Mysterious Origin for Subduing Demons. Upon his head he wore the Dragon-Summoning Cap, for he was the father of the Red Child of the Jade Chamber and Cloud Court. To his right he embraced the Chamber of Luminous Purity, where he daily circulated the qi of generation.

The Yellow and Old Lord at the center was the venerable teacher of the Four Perfected Kings of the Supreme Ultimate. Above, he grasped the Nine Heavens; in the middle, he wandered Kunlun. The Yellow Gate lay without, the Purple Portal within. Below, he entered the Grotto Chamber with the two Lords, its circumference a mere three inches, yet all majesty was therein complete.

When profound meditation reveals the divine, one becomes a Perfected Person. Should one behold White Prime, one becomes a Lesser Perfected, with a lifespan of three thousand years. Should one behold Non-Dual, one becomes a Median Perfected, with a lifespan of ten thousand years. Should one behold the Yellow and Old Lord, one becomes coeval with Heaven, ascending as a Perfected Person to inscribe one’s name upon the Golden Terrace.

Having beheld them, the master prostrated himself twice, kowtowing to beg the essential secrets of the Supreme Perfected. The Yellow and Old Lord said: "Now turn your gaze inward to your Grotto Chamber." Closing his eyes to look within, after a long while he indeed saw within the Grotto Chamber two great spirits—Non-Dual and White Prime—arrayed as though upon an empty mountain. The Yellow and Old Lord laughed and said: "How subtle and profound! This is the fruit of the precision of your intent and thought, the Dao of ascending to Heaven in broad daylight. Now ascend Mount Chang and I shall transmit to you the Dao of the Supreme Perfected."

Thereupon, the master returned to the stone chamber on Mount Chang, where he fasted, meditated upon the Dao, and accumulated over ninety years. Then Non-Dual and the Yellow and Old Lord transmitted to him the thirty-nine scrolls of the *Great Grotto Perfected Scripture*. Twenty-one Jade Lads and twenty-one Jade Maidens attended him, burning incense. Day and night he practiced, accumulating eleven years, until at last he rode the clouds and drove the dragons, ascending to Heaven in broad daylight. He ascended to the Palace of Grand Tenuity, where he received the scriptures and was named the Purple Yang Perfected Person. He bore the Yellow Yak-Tail Banner and the Tally of Eight Potencies, wore a belt of chiming golden bells, donned robes of spontaneous origin, consumed the sustenance of jade nectar, and drank the golden liquid. He governed the Bronze City of the Golden Court on Mount Geyan—this was the Purple Yang Palace. Within the Purple Yang were eight Perfected Persons, and he dwelt at their right. Once every month he ascended Kunlun, and once every morning he paid court to the Lord Emperor of Grand Tenuity.

Mount Panzhong was established as the Purple Yang’s detached palace, known as the Hidden Palace of the Grotto Court. Within Mount Panzhong was a cavern, secretly connecting to the Pure Void of Minor Heaven within Wangwu, and also secretly linking to the Gate of the Wind. The Perfected Person said: "That which is empty in Heaven is called the Void; that which is empty in mountains is called the Grotto; that which is empty in humans is called the Chamber. The hollow within a mountain’s belly is the Grotto Court; the hollow within a human’s head is the Grotto Chamber. Thus the Perfected Person dwells in Heaven, in mountains, in humans—entering without interval. With a grain of millet, one may contain Mount Penglai, embracing the Six Directions, for even Heaven and Earth cannot contain it. Only through refined thought, preserving the true, guarding the Three Palaces, and morning audience with the One Spirit, diligently and arduously meditating, will one surely behold Non-Dual, White Prime, and the Yellow and Old Lord within the Grotto Chamber. When the cloud chariot and feathered canopy arrive, one becomes a Perfected Person. First guard the Three Ones, then one may wander the famous mountains and seek the Grotto Chamber of the Western Eye. These are the essential words."

The Perfected Person Zhou Jun said: "All who are destined to attain the Dao of immortality must first undergo a hundred minor trials; only those who pass them all, vouched for by immortals, may petition the Three Officials to expunge their names from the registers of sin, remove their death records from Mount Tai, and have their names entered into the Immortal Registers. The Immortal Registers then administer twelve great trials, overseen by the Perfected Persons of the Supreme Ultimate. Those who pass the highest trials become High Immortals; those who pass the median trials become Earthbound Immortals; those who pass the lowest trials ascend in broad daylight through *shijie*. Those who fail all trials may still attain *shijie*, but *shijie* is merely governed by the underworld and does not merit the title of immortal."

Later, Su Zigao was also summoned by the Dark Continent to become a True Mandate High Minister. One day in Chenliu, he rode a cloud chariot, drawn by striped dragons and tigers, with feathered canopies attending him as he ascended to Heaven. Many witnessed it simultaneously—he rose slowly to the northwest, and after a long while, clouds enveloped him, and he vanished. He taught Zhou Jun the method of guarding the Three Ones, two hundred subtle and wondrous sayings.

Master Juan was the teacher of Zigao. Master Juan appeared as a man of fasting, from youth fond of consuming wood essence, absorbing its *qi*. Through refined thought, he moved Heaven. Later, while fishing by the rivers and marshes, he saw a youth from the Eastern Sea who said to him: "If you catch a carp, cut it open." Later, he indeed caught one and split its belly, obtaining the *Method of Guarding the Three Ones of the Three Primes* from the Lord Emperor of the Golden Gate. Thereupon, he concealed himself on Mount Du, where he could summon wind and rain. He studied the Dao in the world for two thousand seven hundred years. One day, he told people: "I have been summoned by Grand Tenuity to fill the post of Immortal Duke," and then departed, never to be seen again.

He said to Zigao: "The Three Ones within the Dipper should be worshipped on the proper days. After twenty years, the Three Ones will appear, and upon their appearance, one attains long life and becomes an immortal. A household possessing the Three Ones will enjoy long life without extinction. Those who can preserve the Three Ones will have their names inscribed on the Jade Tablet. Those who can preserve the Grotto Chamber will stand peer to Heaven. Those who can preserve the Three Primes will ascend as True Immortals. The reason the Lord Emperor of the Golden Gate of Supreme Purity in the Highest Heaven rides cloud-drawn swift dragons to traverse the Nine Heavens is precisely the affair of the Three Primes and the True One of the Grotto Chamber."

"I consumed wood essence for three hundred years, practiced *qi*-absorption for five hundred years, refined my thought for six hundred years, guarded the Three Ones for three hundred years, guarded the Grotto Chamber for six hundred years, guarded the Mysterious Elixir for five hundred years, wandered famous mountains, gazed upon the Eight Seas, roamed the Five Peaks, rested in grotto chambers, delighted in the drooping branches of forests and grasses, listened to the calls of birds and beasts, where rivers and streams exhaled essence and hills and mounds flourished. I beheld the flourishing of the hundred things, the seasons of cold and heat, fished and hunted along long currents, wandered the dark shallows, stilled my heart in mountain valleys, nurtured my *qi* and meditated upon the true. I summoned the Six Dings and the Jade Maidens appeared to guard me, traversing the Six Directions without hindrance. I guarded my form and meditated upon immortality for over two thousand seven hundred years, truly delighting in the midst of immortals, without concern for the mundane world. Now, suddenly summoned, I take my leave from this point onward."

These were Master Juan’s parting words to Zigao as he prepared to depart. The Mysterious Elixir refers to the *niwan*, its meaning derived from the *Scripture of the Plain and Numinous of the Supreme*. Guarding the Three Ones enables one to become an Earthbound Immortal; guarding the Grotto Chamber enables one to become a Perfected Person; guarding the Mysterious Elixir enables one to ascend to the Palace of Grand Tenuity. Diligently practice these, and you will naturally obtain this scripture. These words are true. They are not to be recklessly divulged to the unworthy.

The Perfected One’s words: "Those who cannot witness the Great Peace yet harbor aspirations for the Dao and dwell in seclusion—only to them may this book be shown. You must guard it well; better it remain unproclaimed."

The master copy of the *Summoning Rites* was completed in the third year of the Long’an reign of the Jin, the year *jihai* of the sexagenary cycle, on the seventh day of the first month, the day *jiazi*. An additional note states: Lord Zhou was born in the first year of the Yuanfeng reign of the Later Han, the year *xinchou* of the cycle, on the fifth day of the seventh month, the day *jimao*. In the first year of the Yuankang reign, the year *bingchen*, he received from Master Su the *Three Ones and the Pure White Regulations*, which were said to contain three thousand four hundred and eighty-eight characters. The present count yields three thousand four hundred and eighty-nine characters, yet it is unclear which character is extraneous—no reckless emendation is permissible.

Two Perfected Ones composed poems, saying:

We harness our chariots in the midst of the Mysterious Void,
Sheltering the plain and propping the withered groves.
Subtle and wondrous, we meet in primordial chaos,
Ever soaring o’er the crimson mist-clad peaks.
The Eight Effulgences halt the jade wheels,
While the clear carriage surveys the luminous Perfected.
To the left, we seize and roam in flight;
To the right, we gaze and ascend the Eight Heavens.
The grotto unfolds, discerning the harmonious dawn;
Looking up, we move the August Personage to inspiration.
Utmost joy arises as principle naturally converges,
Yet how could the numinous and wondrous body be prized?
In the Western Mystery, roots of seclusion run deep,
High radiance brushes the gleaming light.
Faint and distant, the far-reaching clarity flows,
Nurturing brilliance to uplift the pristine and bright.
Within the chamber of plainness and the double *li*,
The wondrous and tranquil lodge in orchid’s bloom.
We command our chariots to fly the Eight Effulgences,
Swiftly gathering as the southern inclination turns.
Soaring o’er the Yang Feathered Wilds,
We bind our whistles to the city of the Eight Poles.
Who says the myriad leagues are distant?
I transcend without lingering in the numinous.
Induced to meet in plain delight,
We rightly harness and discourse on what is refined.
The Supreme Dao now shines forth in clarity;
Knowing what comes, we warm the new year.
At dawn, we respond to the sun’s effulgence,
Climbing the radiance where virtue is concentrated.
We linger on the summit of the Double Mystery,
Then descend in flight with the soaring dragon.
Beyond the eight strings, we ascend and soar,
Wheeling through the gates of the celestial precincts.
Clustered winds arise in the cinnabar chamber,
Clouds converge in the depths of the remote void.
Alternating realms with Master Gu Xi,
We encounter the plain and conceal ourselves in the Great Void.
Within the long brocade, there are scenes;
Eternal mist veils the mountain’s visage.
The vast and empty Moon Palace is cut off,
The chaotic Dao merges with primordial simplicity.
Accumulated stillness unfolds the Eight Clarities,
The plain and lofty mists stretch far and connect.
I drift upon the Yang’s remote effulgences,
Empty mists stir the pure wind.
The clamor resounds in the observation of the Grand Tenuity,
The towering heights mark the abode of the Nine Mysteries.

Within it dwells a guest who grasps stillness,
In the cavern’s whistling, the cold and quiet place.
To the west are the Six Ridge Masters,
Seeking radiance to converse at dawn.
They come not as guests of the imperial court,
Nor depart as a company of flying immortals.
I soar beyond with my feathered canopy,
Lingering by the limpid and cool islet.
The vast void opens above the Eight Poles,
Pure mists ascend in soaring flight.
I command my chariot forth from the Three Mysteries,
Jade bells stream as celestial guests take flight.
Resplendent is the Court of Grand Harmony,
Where the lush splendor of the Clear Void is observed.
Jewels entwine beyond the bounds of mist,
Seeking radiance where the Seven Spirits gleam.
In plain wanderings, I plumb the purple heavens,
Roaming freely through the Hall of the Nameless.
The dragon banner wheels the jasper wheels,
The Four Quarters respond as effulgences scatter.
For now, I await the time of communion,
When the dawn of the Perfect Dao shall warm.

The Perfected Zhou and Pei, styled Zhenshu—
Hua Qiao of Jiangcheng, magistrate of Jinling, had long served the common gods. One night, he dreamed of a host of ghosts and spirits who feasted and roamed with him. The ghosts shared wine with Qiao, and he drank until drunk, only to vomit all he had consumed upon returning home. For years, the ghosts imposed quotas upon Qiao to recommend men of talent; unable to refuse, he nominated over ten, all of whom met untimely deaths. The ghosts, deeming Qiao’s selections astute, increased his quotas. Even slight delays invited their reproach and punishment. Fearing he would be utterly harassed by the ghosts, Qiao abandoned the common ways and entered the Dao, journeying to the Libationer Xu Zhi of Danyang to receive the rites of the Dao. The ghosts then dispersed and ceased their visits. After several years of devotion, he dreamed of two men, aged around fifty, whose bearing and attire were extraordinary. Thereafter, the two appeared to him—sometimes daily, even thirty times in a month—visiting the quiet chamber of his home. Only Qiao could see them.

One was surnamed Zhou, the other Pei. Pei was refined and valued talent and reason, though not in the manner Qiao had petitioned. Zhou seemed somewhat inferior to him. These two men successively instructed Qiao in scriptures, texts that aligned with the *Five Thousand Character Writ* yet often expounded on Daoist admonitions, conduct, and the nurturing of one’s nature, also containing apocryphal prophecies. The scriptures Qiao received from the two were all kept hidden and never disclosed. Zhou composed his own hagiography, while Pei’s work remained unfinished. Pei’s *Preface to the Music* and Zhou’s hagiography exist separately.

The *Inner Hagiography of the Perfected Purple Yang* concludes.
