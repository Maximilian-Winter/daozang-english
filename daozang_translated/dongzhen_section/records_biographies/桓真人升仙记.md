**The Record of Perfected Huan’s Ascension to Immortality**

*Scripture Title:* *The Record of Perfected Huan’s Ascension to Immortality*. One scroll. Base text from *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongzhen* section, *Records and Biographies* category.

The Perfected Immortal Lord Li Huan of Huagai Mountain in Western Shu transmitted the Dao to Perfected Huan Kai. The Immortal Lord bestowed his name upon his disciple as a surname, hence he was called Huan, though this was not his original family name.

One day, the Immortal Lord said to his disciple Huan Kai: "You have already obtained the great elixir of golden cinnabar, and you comprehend all the secrets of flying steps and concealment. Yet you have not yet heard of the Great Dao."

Kai replied: "Your disciple has followed you for thirty years, Master. I have long known that you possess three wondrous treasures: the *True Talismans of the Three Luminaries*, the *Essentials of the Five Spirits*, the *Net of the Eight Poles*, and the *Silent Audience with the Supreme Emperor*. None of your disciples have dared to inquire about these. I humbly beseech you, Immortal Lord, to instruct me in the supreme Dao, that I may cultivate and realize non-action and swiftly attain the profound principle."

The Immortal Lord said: "The *True Talismans of the Three Luminaries* are techniques for ingesting and wearing to prolong life. The *Essentials of the Five Spirits* and the *Net of the Eight Poles* are sacred texts of the heavens. The *Silent Audience with the Supreme Emperor* is the wondrous gate of ascension and the true essence of cloud-riding—these are not yet for you to hear."

Kai purified his heart and strengthened his resolve, his incense and devotion growing ever more focused. For five years, he toiled diligently without daring to ask again.

One day, the Immortal Lord sighed deeply and said: "When heaven and earth harmonize, the sun and moon bring auspicious responses, and the wondrous principle is complete. When mountains and rivers flourish, bright pearls are born, and gold and jade glisten. When grasses and trees thrive in lush abundance, fragrant herbs vie in beauty, and sacred mushrooms emerge. When phoenixes and simurghs gather in flocks, and auspicious clouds stretch across the sky, sages and worthies reside therein. When the stars align in order, the sun has its double wheels, and propitious stars appear, blessings respond to the nation’s destiny. Heaven and earth, grasses and trees, mountains and rivers, birds and beasts—all receive the pure, harmonious qi of the primordial void and manifest auspicious signs. Yet humans, born between heaven and earth, merely await death and nothing more.

The transformations of the Supreme Mysterious Perfected and the primordial purity of the Celestial Venerable—true immortals leave behind the arts of deathlessness in the world. Yet among the millions over countless years, some study these arts, exhausting their spirits and toiling their minds, clinging to suffering and vexation, deludedly pursuing karmic deeds, willingly enduring hardship. They do not know that beyond the mist and clouds lies a realm of transcendence, a land of undying light; that within the dark sea grows the medicine of returning souls, the elixir of immortality. How could they know of riding the six dragons to ascend the eight poles, or driving the nine phoenixes to roam Kunlun? The jade trees remain ever-spring for a thousand years; the golden peaches bear fruit but once in ten thousand moments. In the Palace of Vast Cold, the heat of summer brings no guests fanning themselves; in the courtyards of the Purple Palace, the depths of winter see few who burn firewood. As for jade towers and orchid pavilions, jeweled halls and layered towers, phoenix gates and silver bridges, resplendent cities and radiant gardens—where pearl light dazzles and joy knows no bounds, where emerald canopies and musk incense fill the air, and bliss reigns in a land without sorrow—common men, base in conduct, know of these yet do not cultivate them, ensnared by the six senses and lost in the passions, never to return."

After the Immortal Lord finished his lament, Kai stepped forward, bowed deeply, and said: "I have heard that in the Jasper Pool and Crimson Towers, the Penglai and Fangzhang Isles, the Purple Palace and Jade Palace, and the immortal grottoes of Kunlun and Square Zhang, there are lands of eternal youth where the sun and moon never set, where jeweled canopies and layered terraces shine with everlasting spring, where golden flasks hold the wine of immortality and crystal vials store the elixir of longevity. The peach trees bloom fragrantly, shedding their blossoms but once in a thousand years; the cloud herbs form precious clusters, ripening only after ten thousand years. I have also heard that snow-white cranes dance upon the steps, immortal maidens sing and play, simurghs soar with kingfisher plumes, and celestial maidens blow upon flutes. The Jasper Pool wells with sweet dew, and jade trees bear heavenly fragrant grains. In the delicate pavilions and radiant halls, light shimmers brilliantly; in the carefree chambers and mist-woven towers, rosy clouds embroider the sky. In these places of feasting and revelry, heavenly music resounds—phoenix flutes and dragon pipes, immortal melodies and celestial rhythms. The golden crow and jade hare wander upon crystal plates; jasper steeds and azure oxen leap forth from the gardens of sacred mushrooms. Is this the unchanging land of the Land of Eternal Joy? I humbly beseech you, Immortal Lord, to guide me: by what method may I cultivate to attain this fruit?"

The Immortal Lord said: "The Jade Spring flows from the Kunlun Mountains. To the east, upon the Eastern Sea, stand the Three Mountain Cities, where seventeen thousand celestial immortals drink from the Elixir Pool, having ascended by consuming the Jade Spring. Yet the Weak Waters block the way—only flying immortals may reach it; mortals cannot."

Kai asked: "In which land does the Jade Spring arise? From which mountain does the Elixir Pool emerge? By what method may one gather and consume them?"

The Immortal Lord replied: "The Jade Spring flows from the Kunlun Mountains, and the Elixir Pool lies in the Land of the Sun and Moon. The mountain there is no taller than a foot, no wider than a liter, and within dwell the Three Divine Sons of the Emperor and the Nine Elder Immortal Sages. Heavenly incense crowns its peak, where lush grasses grow; celestial music resounds of itself. Within blooms the Seven-Treasured Red Lotus, drawing the waters of the Elixir Pool—the Fountain of Deathlessness, which stirs the sounds of the Dharma. Its tones are harmonious and refined, bright day and night, its light illuminating the Three Heavens. All phenomena, vast and myriad, are fully revealed. Cloud chariots and wind dragons, dancing phoenixes and flying simurghs—all karmic deeds, good and evil, are complete in every thing. If one can fathom this realm and awaken to this gate, one may gather a thousand or ten thousand each day. By paying homage to the true immortals ten thousand times, when merit is fulfilled and conduct perfected, one may fly to the Purple Palace."

Kai asked: "How far is this place? Can one reach it?"

The Immortal Lord said: "It is not far—it lies between the square inch of your two brows, at the gate of the spirit’s light, between the Jade Gate and Golden Pillar, though they do not connect. Only by obtaining the secret and wondrous numinous scripture may one arrive."

Kai bowed deeply again, his heart leaping with longing, and begged to hear the essential teaching.

The Immortal Lord said: "Eight thousand *li* to the southeast lies the ancient site of Mao Peak, where the two immortals Yang and Xu once dwelled. In the mountains resides an extraordinary man surnamed Tao, styled Hermit, known in the Liang dynasty as Master Tao Hongjing of Zhenbai."

He had over seventeen hundred disciples, with three hundred admitted to his inner chamber, yet only seven attained his Dao. "Count them—Xie, Qian, and Ru—you are also among this gentleman’s disciples. I shall now transmit to you the most wondrous teaching. You must let your hair loose, bare your feet, take up the hoe as a farmer, and seek to become a gardener for twelve full years. Cultivate hidden merits, never reveal the Dao, guard the secret formulas, and appear no different from the common folk, so none suspect. In time, I shall recommend you, and the Celestial Emperor will surely summon you to ascend the cloudy heavens."

At this, Kai bowed again, vowed his oath, and mounted the altar. With hair unbound and feet bared, he received the Dao.

The Immortal Lord said: "Tao Hongjing was surpassingly intelligent, refining his literary skills and exhausting his spirit in the study of texts. He probed the essential meaning of the scriptures, delighted in recording strange matters, and passionately loved mountains and rivers. He planted pines and bamboos, his heart set on lofty heights, yearning to ascend the cloudy heavens. Though the Celestial Emperor took note, his true merit was slight, and his hidden efforts, though laborious, fell short of the seven disciples who truly learned the Dao.

"Moreover, Tao sought the truth in many ways, dividing his spirit between two paths. He took pleasure in Chan meditation and Buddhist teachings, speaking of bodhi conduct, compiling records of the Western Heaven, and composing texts on rebirth. Practicing both Daoist and Buddhist ways, he has yet to gain the Celestial Emperor’s favor.

"He has three virtues and four faults, for which Heaven holds him accountable. First, he devoted himself to the Great Dao and presided over the Mysterious Gate. Yet when the Liang dynasty faced collapse, he turned to Buddhism, praying for the emperor’s longevity, displaying a filial heart. Second, he broadly aided the orphaned and poor, performed many filial deeds, and carried forward the true teachings of the Three Mao and Yang and Xu, not betraying the legacy of the Most High. Third, he toiled tirelessly, forgetting food, maintaining purity in his cultivation, refining medicines, and exhaustively studying the classics, never forgetting the grace of the Supreme Perfected.

"For these three virtues, he may yet be appointed to an office. But his four faults are too grave. First, he compiled medical formulas requiring the killing of birds, fish, insects, and beasts to cure suffering. Though his intent was to save lives, he incurred the sin of slaughter. Second, he was fond of astrological calculations, probing heavenly secrets, secretly controlling spirits, and divining fortunes. Third, he planted flowers and trees, dug pits in the mountains, loved divining obscure omens, felled trees to build houses, flaunted his reputation, and drew close to the court. Fourth, his aspirations were too lofty, fixated on ascending as an immortal. He built pavilions awaiting transcendence and halls for descending perfected beings. Though his disciples were many, he has yet to earn the right to ascend the heavens.

"Now that you have received my secret teachings, you must serve Master Tao faithfully, and you shall surely ascend to the Great Ultimate. His followers are all cultivators of the truth, yet if their worldly merits fall short, they may not compare to those who establish merit in the realm of Daoist practice, where blessings come swiftly."

That evening, the Immortal Lord transmitted secret instructions to Huan Kai, concluding the ritual of oath and alliance. Then he said: "The scriptures and secret formulas, the charts and books, are boundless and vast, but the essential teachings that return to the root amount to only one or two matters. I once spoke of the realm of Jade Capital, the mountains of the sun and moon, and the domain of Kunlun—do you yet understand their meaning?"

Kai replied: "I do not understand."

The Immortal Lord said: "Within the human body dwell thirty-six thousand spirits of radiant essence and twelve thousand spirits of the hun and po. In the Mud Pill Palace resides the Great Lord of Undying Life. The Two Modes and Four Images, the Eight Trigrams and Nine Palaces, Kunlun and Fanghu, and all the heavenly palaces are perfectly complete, neither more nor less, merging with Heaven and Earth. Even wind and clouds, thunder and rain, frost and fog, snow and hail, mist and rosy clouds, grasses and trees, mountains and rivers, numinous steles, longevity stems, fish and dragons, humans and beasts, transformations and rebirths, heavenly realms and dark underworlds—all are fully contained within.

"Yet the common folk, stirred by the six emotions and entangled by the three poisons, suffer deep harm to their bones, lacking knowledge and awareness. Their spirits are dull, their consciousness dim, their hun and po lost in confusion. Seduced by sounds, forms, and desires, bound by deep love and attachment, they cannot break free, becoming other kinds of beings. Unable to transcend, their confusion deepens, suffering the four hundred and four illnesses, the eight evils and four births, the three disasters and nine calamities, the punishments of kings and the judgments of Heaven. Thus, the Most High expounded the Three Caverns and opened the Four Auxiliaries, guiding all living beings to return together to the sacred realm—how could this not be arduous?

"Now you have received the Most High’s true and mysterious secret teachings. Do not reveal them to the common folk, nor let frivolous thoughts arise, lest you incur sin and punishment."

Kai knelt in awe, bowed deeply, and received the Immortal Lord’s secret instructions.

The Immortal Lord said: "The sun and moon are the wondrous extremes within Heaven and Earth, the radiant essence within Qian and Kun, the solitary brilliance within yin and yang. In the heavens, they are the eyes; in the sea, they are the luminous essence; in all things, they are the vital essence; in the human body, they are the hun and po.

"Now, the secret treasures within your body: the head is called Kunlun, the crown is called the Mud Pill, and the center is called the Brain Gate. The Brain Gate is where the spirit roams, where the Celestial Emperor resides. Below the sun and moon and Kunlun, radiant light flows into the Golden Pool, connecting with the liver and lungs. The lungs are the cauldron within metal, externally corresponding to the nose. The liver is the flower within wood, externally corresponding to the eyes. The eyes follow the five colors in desire, the nose follows the five fragrances in congestion. Metal and wood are separated, the radiant light at the gate scatters, the spirit pearl is lost, and thus one reaches the realm of death.

"Now I transmit to you the Way of Undying and the Celestial Emperor’s method for ascending the clouds—this is no trivial matter. Long ago, on the Azure Flower Mountain of the Eastern Marchmount, the Purple Mystery Immortal Earl taught me this method, and seven hundred years have passed since then. You must first cultivate the union of water and fire, the Kan and Li gates, to attain longevity. If the heart does not connect with the numinous, if the spirit does not transform, ascending the cloudy heavens will be difficult. Long ago, the Perfected Lord Xu received this supreme teaching from the Elder of the Western Mountain and ascended to the Azure Vault that very day—how joyous was that!

"When the bones of the crown are closed and sealed, leaking evil qi, ghostly winds blow and gather. The spirit of Kunlun attaches to the heart, scorching it night and day. The liver and kidneys discharge essence and expend yang, damaging the Golden Cauldron. The spirit cannot restrain them, true immortals do not dwell there, and the Celestial Emperor does not descend. Thus, one willingly accepts the realm of death."

Now you return the radiance of the sun and moon, illuminating the Kunlun of the Great Ultimate. The left eye and right eye are the sun and moon within heaven, shining as one through the twelve hours.

The Immortal Lord then sang:
*"The Golden Cauldron’s Celestial Gate opens,
Reverting to youth, restoring the infant’s grace.
Sun and moon illuminate Kunlun,
The Perfected Lord arrives naturally.
Three years knit the yellow clouds,
A thousand days form the sacred embryo.
Nine years ascend the Golden Portal,
Twelve years rise to the Three Terraces.
Dragon and tiger naturally unite,
The Celestial Emperor secures the Golden Terrace.
All spirits gaze heavenward in reverence,
Listening in awe, their hearts adrift.
Now you receive the numinous scripture,
Focus your mind like dead ashes.
Accumulate merit for twelve years,
And when complete, ascend the cloud ladder.
White light arises in perfect form,
Purple qi surges through the clouds.
Align with emptiness, contemplate the Great One,
Through vast kalpas, heaven and earth stand as one."*

At this, Huan Kai felt as though his heart and eyes had been lost. He sighed deeply and said: *"For countless kalpas, I wandered in life and death, unaware of the numinous root. I merely pointed to the heart’s sovereign, believing it to be the true Dao. How I regret not recognizing the beyond of the great void—the realm of ‘what is and is not’—or the inquiry of Kunlun, where the scene of longevity abides. Beneath the sun and moon, countless souls die in vain. Now I understand: the primordial essence is neither born nor destroyed; it is the root of water and fire. The heart and kidneys are its foundation, the gate of the Dao’s mystery—truly atop Kunlun."*

Kai bowed deeply and asked again: *"How does the radiance of the sun and moon illuminate the Celestial Gate and open the crown of Kunlun?"*

The Immortal Lord replied: *"Focus the heart on the eyes and visualize the cinnabar field for a moment, then reverse the light upward to reflect directly upon the Celestial Gate—the Celestial Gate is the gate of the brain. At any time, whether early or late, engage in affairs while containing the light in silence, never departing from the crown. This is called the ‘Method of Silent Audience with the Celestial Emperor.’ Guard this well, guard this well.

Ordinary people’s hearts and eyes wander outward, never turning their minds inward to themselves."*

He sang again:
*"Inward illumination returns the numinous light,
The Great One embraces true fragrance.
Aroma scatters like blossoming countenance,
Lush and flourishing, purple chambers arise.
The Celestial Gate opens to the azure heavens,
Silently paying homage to the Jade Emperor."*

The Immortal Lord spoke again: "When a person enters the womb, the eyes form first, like water bubbles, while the other four limbs and appearance are yet absent. Next, the two kidneys emerge, corresponding internally to the essence-conduits. The birth of Heaven and Earth follows the same pattern. Before Heaven and Earth divided, before the sun and moon shone, there lay the root of primordial chaos, the inception of the Great Yang. The Confucians and Buddhists do not speak of this principle; they merely say the heart is the lord of all things, prior even to the Supreme Emperor—yet this offers no place to begin. They can only perform diligent rituals, burn incense, eat bland food, and abstain from meat. Some swallow talismans, ingest medicines, worship the moon and gaze at the stars, exhale the old and inhale the new—all measures taken out of necessity. As for corpse-liberation, escaping form, spirit-exit, embryonic breathing, cutting off love and forgetting emotion, attaining carefree ease, sitting in liberation or standing in transformation, borrowing wombs or entering them, seizing destiny or evading fate, concealing the body or hiding the form, swallowing the essence of the sun and moon, riding the stars or controlling fire, refining essence and swallowing saliva, consuming lingzhi and herbs, practicing the Buddhist cicada-shedding of empty radiance, relinquishing form to cultivate the body, giving alms and enduring humiliation—these myriad beneficial practices, each pursued according to one’s capacity, have yet to grasp the profound principle. There are hundreds of thousands of methods. Only in the supreme vehicle of cultivation, the great Dao, must one illuminate the spirit-light within, making the inner realm luminously clear. Nowadays, paintings often depict a white light emanating from the crown, revealing a dignified countenance seated majestically upon a lotus—this imagery approaches the truth. Yet the ancients concealed their subtlety within it, for there exists wondrous true emptiness, free from thought and desire. The dharmakāya is fundamentally beyond birth and death, but lacking the power of great samādhi, one becomes subject to transmigration, mistakenly entering other wombs, dying in vain and living futilely, bound for kalpas without end. Even when encountering a perfected being, they are unwilling to immediately transmit the supreme, wondrous meaning or the great wisdom of perfect interpenetration. Instead, they may be born into blissful families, reaping the rewards of merit, becoming kings, great ministers, or men of profound intelligence. Though their minds are sagely and wise, illuminating the scriptures, they may unwittingly turn wisdom into poison. Through wisdom, thoughts arise; through thoughts, sentient beings flow and turn, entangled by love and emotion, generating perverse views and slander, falling into demonic realms, ensnared by demonic attachments. Thus, for hundreds of thousands of kalpas, they fail to awaken to the true principle. Therefore, the Most High, moved by compassion, saves and delivers living beings, expounding scriptures and treatises to reveal the true meaning, liberating all sentient beings and guiding them to the gate of purity.

"Only by inwardly generating silent illumination, cultivating both samādhi and wisdom in tandem, and perfecting the true body with radiant clarity can one escape birth and death."

The Immortal Lord continued: "Now you shall go to the ancient site of Huayang Cave Heaven on Mount Sanmao, where you will serve the Tao family, guarding the true and silently preserving the flawless mystery. Accumulate merit and practice the ‘Method of Silent Audience with the Celestial Emperor.’ After twelve years of cultivation, you must ascend to the heavens."

Kai asked: "The path is distant, waters divide us, and without boats or oars across rivers and lakes, how can I reach it?"

The Immortal Lord replied: "I possess the talisman of the Earth’s Veins and the Spirit Spring. Tonight, bathe and purify your body, stand in the Hall of Flourishing Primordiality, and enter silent contemplation—then you may arrive."

From here to Huayang, the distance spans eight thousand *li*. There lies the Water Palace of the Great River, the Yangzi River, the Valley of Numinous Streams, the Caves of Purple Gold and White Jade, with a retinue of three thousand six hundred, commanding an army of ten thousand divine soldiers, five divine dragons, the Duke of Thunder and Earl of Wind, five hundred thunder spirit messengers, and the Lower Prime Water Palace’s Commander-in-Chief, Wu Yue of Ou Min’s Immortal Source. It stores ninety million *hu* of water, with thirty-six *qing* of tides, eighty thousand fierce warriors, nine hundred thunder drums, and a lifespan of one hundred thousand years—equal in rank to the Penglai Water Palace’s Commander. The Lower Prime, Middle, and Upper Water Palaces all govern the tides, the world’s floods and droughts, and human affairs.

Kai asked: "What are the duties of the Three Lords of Sanmao at Huayang?"

The Immortal Lord replied: "They oversee the registers of immortals, administer the blessings and misfortunes of Wu Yue, and manage the imperial domains and the affairs of the Nine Provinces. The Three Immortal Lords command reporting spirit-warriors and ten thousand immortals, together governing the Nine Provinces and overseeing the merits, transgressions, and cultivation of those who seek immortality."

He added: "The Eighth Cave Heaven of Huayang connects with the Ten Great Cave Heavens, the Thirty-Six Lesser Cave Heavens, the Four Seas, the Yangzi and its tributaries, Penglai, the Ten Isles, the peaks of Kunlun, and even the Dark Capital and the Nether Peaks—all are accessible. Yet ordinary people, stained by defilement, desire, and delusion, remain obstructed. If perverse views do not arise, the paths of sages and mortals become open, and one may wander freely within the six directions of Heaven and Earth, both inner and outer."

Thereupon, the Immortal Lord employed the art of the Spirit Mirror and the Vein-Spring, a method Kai could not comprehend. Kai closed his eyes and, without moving, arrived; without haste, he departed. In an instant, as if hearing voices questioning him, he had already crossed the rivers and lakes. At times, he caught the scent of palaces and rare fragrances; at others, he heard singing or celestial music. Suddenly, he heard the Immortal Lord say: "Open your eyes." As if in a dream, he stepped ashore. Green mountains rose solitary, the azure sea lapped at the shore, and boats came and went—none of it familiar. Asking a passerby, he was told: "This is Danyang." He then inquired about the distance to Mao Peak. The traveler replied: "Two hundred *li* remain." Kai asked if there were any temples. The traveler said: "There is a grand shrine built by Master Tao the Recluse of Great Liang, who gathers worthies and welcomes scholars."

Kai hurried along the path. That night, Tao dreamed of his chamber filled with divine light and clouds of radiant hues ascending to the heavens. A golden-armored spirit pointed at Tao and said: "Tomorrow, an extraordinary person will arrive."

Tao asked: "Morning or evening?"

The spirit replied: "At noon."

The Master awoke and said to his disciples: "You shall sweep the gate with me. At noon, an esteemed guest will arrive—take care not to bar his way, and hasten to inform me." As the sun reached its zenith, Kai washed his feet and chanted:

*"A guest indeed has come—
Unbound hair, golden blossoms, purple clouds arise;
The sun and moon wheel through the heavens,
Vast and boundless, the Great Void,
Not as the grasses of the multitude.
The twelve peaks of Kunlun,
Where the Emperor makes his ten thousand circuits.
When a single day’s merit is complete,
One ascends to the heavens to pay homage to the Primordial Sovereign."*

The disciples, not understanding his words, hurried to report to Master Tao. Delighted, Tao invited Kai in, only to see him with unbound hair, bare feet, and an appearance most wild and strange.

Tao asked: "What brings you here?"

Kai replied: "I have heard of your lofty Dao and come to cultivate vegetables with you."

Tao said: "Your song just now was most unusual—what did it mean?"

Kai answered: "I heard others speak, learned their song—how could I understand it?"

Tao let the matter rest. He asked again: "What is your surname?"

Kai said: "My surname is Huan, given name Kai, a man of Shu."

Tao asked: "How many days have you been away from home?"

Kai replied: "I left last night."

Tao laughed: "A madman, a madman indeed!"

Then he said to Kai: "Those who tend gardens—are they not all of lowly station?"

Kai said: "I wish only to hear the Dao."

Tao said: "I have three ranks of disciples."

Kai asked: "What of the highest rank?"

Tao replied: "They wear silks and brocades, consume lingzhi and pine, compile texts and annotate scriptures, manage records, concoct elixirs, attend the immortals and accompany the noble. They enter my chambers."

Kai asked: "And the middle rank?"

Tao said: "They manage correspondence, compose questions and answers, prepare decoctions, wear silk and hemp, eat millet and pine-needle wine, dwell to the left and right of my courtyard. I teach them arts and techniques, and they accompany those of the Dao."

Kai asked: "And the lowest rank?"

Tao said: "They wear silk and hemp, eat the five grains, dispense medicines, dwell in my lodgings, sweep rooms and burn incense, pay homage to the stars and moon. I teach them to refine qi, and they may associate with learned men, receive guests, and cultivate vegetables and herbs."

Tao continued: "Each rank numbers in the hundreds."

Kai said: "I do not belong among these three ranks. May I tend the garden, draw water, chop firewood, burn incense, clean privies, and dredge wells?"

Tao said: "I only fear you will not consent to such tasks."

Kai bowed twice and vowed to be the one who burns incense and draws water. Tao kept him.

During his stay with Tao, Kai paid no heed to cold or heat, rank or humility, hunger or satiety, toil or hardship. The disciples mocked him, but he remained unmoved; he was never lazy in his duties. He rose before others awoke and retired only after they slept. He did not burn incense, bow in worship, recite scriptures, or abstain from meat. Without hatred or resentment, neither vain nor ostentatious, he spoke little, showed neither joy nor anger. In leisure, he swept the ground; in busyness, he chopped firewood. In motion, he tended the fire; in stillness, he washed clothes. Thus he remained in Tao’s household for twelve years, yet Tao did not recognize his worth. Though ever before his eyes, Tao paid him no mind, nor did Kai disturb him.

Tao’s residence had a three-story tower, the highest floor brushing the tips of the pines. There he listened to the wind in the pines, while his disciples dwelled on the lower floors. He annotated over a thousand volumes of texts. When Emperor Wu of Liang sought divination, he often dispatched envoys to inquire, and the Master would sometimes draw an ox in reply. When asked about the fate of the dynasty, he interpreted the signs and knew the Liang’s reign would not last long. By the years *gengzi* and *xinchou*, he marked the time in red. Emperor Wu did not understand.

The court officials called Tao the "Prime Minister of the Mountains." His Dao was lofty, his virtue transcendent, and from all four seas, over a thousand disciples came to follow him, with three hundred entering his inner chambers. He built the Vermilion Sun Lodge, constructed the Awaiting Immortals Tower and the Gazing at Edicts Pavilion, and meticulously maintained the incense and offerings. Often, he would shield his face with a fan, fearing that dark qi might shroud his divine radiance. He once said: "If the Emperor were to summon me, I would turn this mountain into a palace of jade and towers of crystal."

At eighty-four, the Master’s strength remained abundant, his energy unflagging. He never ceased annotating scriptures, and he loved planting bamboo and cultivating herbs. He refined elixirs atop the peaks of Mount Taoshan in Yongjia’s Great Weakness Grotto and Wooden Drip Isle.

From birth, the Master was extraordinary—his countenance radiant, his beard long, his features handsome. He stood seven feet tall, with fine eyes and slender brows, his qi pure and his bearing serene. Well-versed in ancient and modern learning, he was accomplished in the arts, astronomy, calendrics, divination, medicine, and pharmacology. Every discipline he mastered with profound clarity.

On the fifteenth day of the eighth month in the first year of *Tianjian* of the Great Liang, atop Great Maoshan, several streaks of white light suddenly appeared. In an instant, clouds gathered thickly, the forests and springs grew clear, and celestial music rang out. The crowd saw red and multicolored clouds, a single crane, and a youth in blue holding an edict in the sky. Within the five-colored radiance appeared rainbow banners and feathered regalia, with over a hundred immortal youths and spirit officials attending an empty chariot, its form like a dragon’s carriage.

The youth and the crane descended to the courtyard. Tao believed the Emperor of Heaven was summoning him, but the immortal youth said: "Do not trouble yourself. Quickly have Huan Kai change his robes, drink the elixir, and receive the edict."

The youth continued: "The Emperor and the Early Perfected await in the Luminous Golden Gate Palace’s Liao Yang Hall—Huan Kai is to arrive."

Thereupon, Kai bathed, donned the elixir, and received the edict:

*"For your silent merit, ceaseless hidden virtue,
And the wondrous teachings of your enlightened master,
Swiftly you shall attain the immortal’s home,
Embody the wondrous void, roam the Golden Gate.
Debts of enmity from many lives melt like spring ice,
Past transgressions vanish like wind snuffing a candle.
By golden elixir and crane’s edict,
We dispatch you to Maoshan’s peak.
The immortals of the Purple Palace,
For kalpas have awaited your arrival at the immortal’s abode.
Your toil and hardship, never shirked,
Your will steadfast as the pine—
Now ascend to the immortal’s rank!"*

Upon the edict’s arrival, he ascended to the cloudy heavens.

*Right: Dispatched to Mao Peak, the Controller of Destiny and his attendants shall ensure its execution.*

The proclamation complete, he mounted a crane and rose upon the clouds, phoenix bells chiming as the staff stirred, drifting away on the wind.

When he first changed his robes, Tao admonished Kai: "When we search the celestial archives for your immortal register, how much longer must your merit accumulate? What deeds remain unfinished? How many transgressions yet require redress?" Kai received his master’s instruction and took leave. Tao bore a lingering reluctance, as if intoxicated through the night.

As Huan Kai ascended to heaven, he left behind this hymn:

*"Preserve the spirit, nurture the qi’s essence,
In clarity and stillness, the heart’s light shines.
Vain thoughts do not arise in emptiness,
Seeking truth, the Dao naturally forms.
Sun and moon illumine Kunlun,
Day and night pierce the mud-pill palace.
The numinous perfected descend of themselves—
When merit is complete, ascend the Heavenly Gate."*

*The Record of Perfected Huan’s Ascension as an Immortal concludes.*
