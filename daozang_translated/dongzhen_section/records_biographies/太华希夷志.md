### **Preface to *The Record of Master Xiyi of Mount Taihua***

While serving as a minor official in Jinning, Hezhong Prefecture, I lived in close proximity to Mount Hua and often heard tales of Master Xiyi’s legacy. In my spare time from official duties, I gathered accounts from ancient texts and folk sayings. His lofty conduct and unyielding integrity truly marked him as a singular figure of the former Song dynasty. Thus, I compiled *The Record of Master Xiyi of Mount Taihua* to preserve his memory.

The Master was well-versed in the *Book of Changes* and delved deeply into its profound mysteries. He perceived the fortunes and misfortunes of men and the auspices of things as clearly as if reading the cracks of a tortoise shell.

During the Five Dynasties, he harbored ambitions to restore order and save the world, mastering the Dao of emperors and kings. When he learned of the ascension of Emperor Taizu of Song, knowing the realm was settled, he entered Mount Hua as a Daoist and declined all summons.

Upon Emperor Taizong’s enthronement, the Master was thrice invited to court and received with the courtesy due a guest. Seated beside the emperor, he discoursed on matters of fortune and misfortune, all of which proved accurate. Though offered an official post, he firmly declined.

Soon after, he was permitted to return to his mountain retreat. Though a recluse beyond the mundane world, his conduct aligned with the *Doctrine of the Mean*. He cast off worldly dust, disdaining rank and wealth, and regarded princes and nobles with the ease of peers. His serene withdrawal and lofty seclusion, free from the pursuit of power and profit, served to curb the ambitions of the avaricious. His integrity may be compared to that of the ancient hermits Chao Fu and Xu You, or the recluse Yan Guang. In upholding moral teachings and enriching customs, he rendered no small service to the age.

In contrast, those who grovel like leeches, flatter like slaves, knock on doors at dusk, or lord over others in broad daylight are but fermented dregs in a jar—what worth have they to speak of?

I, Xia, reside far from the capital in Baojun, having accepted the post of magistrate in Puchuan due to family poverty, journeying two thousand *li* to assume office. Earlier, I served twice as a teaching official and held successive county positions. Though I associated with renowned scholars of the imperial academy and was repeatedly recommended for literary honors, my path was obstructed by those in power, and I was never appointed. Ashamed of self-promotion, I have languished in minor local posts, substituting for the plow while my scholarly aspirations remain unfulfilled, leaving me perpetually discontent.

Upon reading ancient biographies, I was moved by Master Xiyi’s noble character and compiled this record to inspire young scholars. Should errors or vulgar distortions appear—due to the limitations of my sources—I have done my best to correct and supplement them, striving to capture the Master’s lofty spirit. May this work find some merit.

### **The Record of Master Xiyi of Mount Taihua, Fascicle One**

**Compiled and supplemented by:** Zhang Xia of Nezhai, *Dengshilang*, Magistrate of Hezhong Prefecture

The Master’s name was Bo, styled Tunan, a native of Zhenyuan in Bozhou. In his childhood, while playing by the water—some say the Wo River—a green-clad woman cradled him in her arms and nursed him, saying, “Henceforth, you shall be free from desires and surpass others in wisdom.” This green-clad woman was likely the essence of the celestial star Chenxing.

As he grew, he studied for the imperial examinations. During the *Changxing* era of the Later Tang, he sat for the *jinshi* exams but did not pass. He retreated to the Nine-Chambered Cliff of Mount Wudang, where he practiced *bigu* (abstention from grains) and refined his *qi* for over twenty years.

Some say that on quiet nights, he would burn incense and recite the *Book of Changes*. Five elders would appear—white-browed, hoary-haired, and of strange countenance—listening to his recitations. After many days, Bo questioned them, and the elders replied, “We are the dragons of the Sun and Moon Pond of this mountain. This is the domain of the Dark Warrior. Mount Hua is your destined place of seclusion.”

One day, as Xiyi sat in silent meditation, the five dragons suddenly arrived. They instructed him to close his eyes, and he was borne aloft by the wind, arriving at Mount Hua by dawn. When he opened his eyes, he found himself seated upon a boulder, with no sign of the elders’ departure. Some say his sleeping method was taught by the dragons, for dragons are skilled in slumber.

He often remained secluded, sitting motionless for over a hundred days. Emperor Shizong of Zhou summoned him to court and had him confined in the palace, testing his endurance by sealing the door. After more than a month, the door was opened, and he was found in deep slumber as before. The emperor marveled at this and inquired about the arts of alchemy. Bo replied, “Your Majesty rules the realm; you should concern yourself with the people’s welfare. How can you fixate on such trifles?” The emperor was displeased and sent him back to the mountains, bestowing upon him the title “Master of White Clouds” and instructing the local prefect to inquire after him annually.

The Master possessed the talent to govern the world. During the Five Dynasties, whenever a dynasty fell, he would frown for days. If questioned, he would stare in silence. Gazing into a mirror, he declared, “If not an immortal, then an emperor.” Such was his self-assurance.

When Emperor Taizu of Song traveled to Chang’an with Zhao Pu, Xiyi encountered them. Laughing, he dismounted his donkey and said, “A true man is indeed in the world!” Taking Taizu’s hand, he asked, “Shall we drink?” Taizu agreed, and they went with Zhao the scholar. Xiyi glanced at Pu and said, “He’ll do, he’ll do.” Entering a tavern, Pu sat to the left, but Bo grew angry, seizing his hand and saying, “A mere star of the Purple Tenuity—how dare you take the higher seat?” He rebuked Pu and made him sit to the right. Thus, he discerned the imperial destiny.

Later, the Master led hundreds of ruffians into Bianzhou. Upon hearing of Taizu’s enthronement, he burst into joyous laughter. When asked the reason, he laughed again and said, “Now the realm is settled!” He composed a poem:

*Forty years of sound sleep—*
*Unnoticing, the eastern sky has dawned.*

Thereafter, he entered Mount Hua, living as a Daoist. Emperor Taizu repeatedly summoned him, but he refused to come. After Taizu’s death, Emperor Taizong ascended the throne. On the tenth day of the fourth month of the first year of the *Zhidao* era (995), the emperor sat in the *Chuigong* Hall. The season was mild, the harvest abundant, and governance harmonious. The emperor had long heard of the Master’s renown.

Disdaining the world’s splendor, he favored the teachings of purity and seclusion. The emperor dispatched Palace Attendant Chen Zongyan of the Eastern Hall, bearing an imperial edict and a poem, to the Cloud Terrace Abbey in Huayin County, Huazhou, to summon Master Chen Tunan.

On the fourteenth day of the fourth month, they arrived in Huayin County. The magistrate, Editorial Director Ding Shouming, welcomed them into the county seat. As dusk fell, they lodged there for the night. At dawn the next day, the fourteenth of the month, they proceeded with the imperial envoy to Cloud Terrace Abbey. There, they met the Daoist Zhong Xihui, who led them to the Master. Announcing the emperor’s summons, they said, “His Majesty calls for the Master.”

After washing his hands and burning incense, the Master bowed before the imperial seat. He then listened as the edict was read: “Since ascending the throne, We have subdued the eight directions and overawed the myriad states. Far and near have submitted to Our transforming influence; Chinese and barbarian alike have attained great peace. We have learned that you, Master, embrace the Dao amid the mountains, purify your heart beyond the realm of things, nurture the primal qi of great simplicity, and correspond to the Lesser Weaving Star of the upper heavens. Your integrity rivals that of Chao Fu and Xu You; your Way follows that of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi. Though you hold the long-term strategies of governance, you do not seek audience with kings and lords; though you possess the extraordinary talents of generals and ministers, you have not paid court to the Son of Heaven. You do not bend before the lord of ten thousand chariots—why then conceal yourself among the Three Peaks? Yet you come with the wind, and the entire court rejoices. Our poem reads:

*Of Hua Peak much have We heard—*
*We know your surname is Chen.*
*You ask the guests of the Three Isles,*
*A lofty man beyond the world.*
*Your crucible is your livelihood,*
*Green mountains your near neighbors.*
*We long to go in person,*
*But the altars of state permit no absence.*

After hearing the edict and poem, the Master addressed the imperial envoy: “This poor Daoist dwells beyond the world of things, cultivating and refining amid the mountains. I seek no fame, but my heart yearns for the Dao. I have no wish to serve in office.” When the envoy’s courtesies were complete, the Master still refused to come to court. Instead, he presented a reply memorial and a poem:

*I recall my rustic birth beneath the vast heavens,*
*Raised south of the Han.*
*In youth, I studied the Confucian classics;*
*In manhood, I roamed the grottoes and abbeys.*
*My nature is like the lowly crow;*
*My heart, like cold ashes.*
*I know not the depths of benevolence and righteousness,*
*Nor the right path of action or retreat.*
*My robe is made of withered lotus;*
*My cap, of cast-off clogs.*
*My body sprouts green fur;*
*My feet lack straw sandals.*
*I aspire to the Way of Fuxi and the Yellow Emperor,*
*But have no heart to recite the works of Guan and Yue.*
*I often read the* Southern Florescence *and the* Dao and Its Virtue*,*
*While thoughts of the vermilion gates and jade halls fade away.*
*Several lines of purple edicts*
*Only trouble the colorful phoenix that bears them.*
*A single piece of my idle heart*
*Has already been detained by the white clouds.*
*If I were to approach the imperial steps,*
*I would only bring ridicule upon Your Sagely Brilliance.*

*The poem reads:*
*Ninefold layers send down the purple-sealed summons,*
*Yet this clumsy hermit delights in quiet seclusion.*
*Mountain hues fill the court like painted screens;*
*Pine voices from ten thousand gorges are my zither strings.*
*I have no heart to enjoy emoluments or ascend the three ducal seats,*
*But seek the immortal realms of the grotto-heavens.*
*Floating honors of cap and carriage banish all thoughts—*
*I beg only to sleep for a thousand years among the Three Peaks.*

Seeing the Master’s firm resolve to decline the summons, the envoy received the reply memorial and poem. On the twenty-fourth day of the fourth month, he returned to the capital and presented them at the Purple Throne Hall. Emperor Taizong read the memorial and poem, and learning that the Master would not come, was deeply displeased. He could not put the matter from his mind.

On the third day of the sixth month of that year, the emperor sat in the *Chuigong* Hall and summoned Palace Attendant Zhang Suzhen of the Eastern Hall. He entrusted him with another edict and sent him again to summon the Master. On the eighth day of the sixth month, the envoy arrived at Cloud Terrace Abbey on Mount Hua. There, he saw a mountain youth standing with a bamboo scroll in hand. The imperial envoy asked, “Is the Master here?”

The youth replied, “The Master is fast asleep in his hut.”

The envoy asked, “How may he be awakened?”

The youth said, “Strike the golden bell beside his head, and he will wake.”

When the bell was struck, the Master awoke. Realizing the imperial envoy had arrived, he hastily rose and adjusted his Daoist robes. He asked the envoy, “Why have you come again?”

The envoy replied, “When Master Chen Zongyan’s summons went unanswered, the emperor was greatly disappointed. He has specially sent me to summon you once more.”

After burning incense and performing the rites, the Master listened as the edict was read: “We reflect that you, Master, are a recluse amid the white clouds, a lofty man of the azure grottoes. You have awakened to the mysterious gate of the Great Dao and penetrated the profound principles of the subtle and tranquil. We lament how swiftly the seasons pass, how fleeting the sun’s shadow. Suddenly, summer yields to the chill of winter; gradually, the face ages and the temples gray. Though We have mastered the strategies of governing the age, We have not yet grasped the mechanism of refining the nature. We neglect sleep and forget meals, thirsting for the worthy as one parched. Temporarily leave your grotto-abbey; mount the simurgh or crane and fly here. Stand in the palace chambers, where the court’s officials in their caps and sashes await you with reverence.”

After reading the edict, the Master replied to the envoy: “This poor Daoist is a rustic man, mingling with deer and swine. I climb high to gaze afar, rinse my mouth by the streams. The pine lord and cassia father are my friends; the cloud peaks and rosy ridges, my haunts. Why should I covet the floating honors of wealth and nobility? I beg the imperial envoy to pause his carriage and rest in this mountain hut while I compose a reply memorial and poem to express my gratitude for this extraordinary favor.”

*The memorial reads:*
*I reflect upon my foolish clumsiness, dwelling deep in the ravines and gullies. By some mistake, I have received Your Heavenly Grace. Your servant lacks the extraordinary talents of Zhuge Liang; Your Majesty surpasses the profound virtue of the Han emperor. Your servant’s nature is that of the mountain elk; his bearing, that of the wild crane. He alone admires the carefree; cap and carriage are far from his fetters. Beyond the Azure Dragon Ridge, his butterfly dreams drift; idly watching the lotuses of the Jade Well, his poetic soul surges. He dines on mist and rosy clouds at the grotto’s mouth, gathers ferns and bracken amid the woods. Staff in hand, sandals on feet, he wanders at ease; body and mind, he is indolent and scattered. Refining the elixir in his crucible, he aspires to ascend as an immortal; shunning the world’s empty fame, he repeatedly guards against calamity. Relying on the fortune of encountering a Yao or Shun, he may roam freely like Chao Fu or Xu You. Happily, he spends his remaining years gazing afar upon this sagely age.*

*Two quatrains read:*
*Sitting in this sagely age, the age of Yao,*
*Even a rustic fool from the marshes is summoned.*
*I laugh at my lazy form—how could it be otherwise?*
*With my meager talents, how dare I gaze toward the celestial court?*

*Harmonizing the four qi by burning the elixir,*
*Refining a thousand methods only to seek peace.*

The lofty halls of the Yellow Gate hold no allure for him; dwelling in leisurely seclusion surpasses holding office. The imperial envoy returned bearing his memorial and poems, yet he lacked the strength to rise and answer the summons. On the sixteenth day of the sixth month, he arrived at the capital and presented his writings to the virtuous Prince. Emperor Taizong, having read the memorial and poems, was deeply displeased that the Master had not come. On the twenty-ninth day of the same month, the Emperor sat in the Hall of Vertical and Horizontal Eaves and summoned the Inner Attendant Shi Bao, asking, "Among the hundred officials, who is most eloquent in speech?" Bao replied, "The Vice Director of the Inner Treasury, Ge Shouzhong, is skilled in persuasion." Taizong summoned him and commanded Shouzhong to serve as envoy, bearing the imperial edict and poems to Cloud Terrace Abbey to summon Master Xiyi once more.

On the seventh day of the seventh month, the envoy arrived at the abbey but did not find the Master. The abbey’s caretaker, Daoist Yang Zixun, said, "The Master, fearing the Emperor’s repeated summons, has fled to Jade Spring Abbey to sit in silent retreat." The envoy instructed Zixun to lead the way. Passing through the winding stone path, they reached the abbey. Announcing the imperial decree, they were received with incense and ritual. The edict read:

*"I, having received the Mandate of Heaven above and soothed the hearts of the people below, have stilled the blades of war so that the Four Seas are at peace, and spread transformation so that the Eight Directions know no slander. Ascending the throne to govern the multitudes, all rejoice with full mouths and drumming bellies, singing in unison of the Dao’s non-action. They dig wells and till fields to secure their livelihoods, knowing that great worthies are born into the world. With seas calm and rivers clear, I look to the noble man to save the age; though the wind sweeps the grass flat, he has not yet left the cliffs and valleys. His name fills the realm, yet his heart ever wanders the Penglai Isles, his spirit roams the vast and boundless. I have long known of the Yellow Emperor’s virtue in broadly bestowing blessings, and I regret not having mastered the methods of cultivation of Guangchengzi. Though the land be remote, the royal grace reaches even there. Yi Yin answered the call and went to Bo; Mencius followed the summons and came to Liang. Fate has its alignments, and rites allow for no excessive refusal."*

The imperial poem read:
*Thrice I have summoned you, yet you do not come to court,*
*Though a thousand li of rivers and passes should not deter your toil.*
*Jade hewn from mountains must ultimately be obtained;*
*Iron turned to gold has yet to be forged in the flame.*
*Your purple robe, ample and flowing, should drape your form;*
*The golden seal, its cord purple, may hang at your waist.*
*With you, Master, to aid and counsel me,*
*Why should I fear the myriad folk ceasing their songs?*

Having read the edict and poem, the Master was reluctant to answer the summons and sought to decline once more. The imperial envoy Shouzhong said, "Three times the decree has come—you cannot persist in refusal. Have you not heard the words of the *Analects of Lu*: 'When the lord’s command summons, one does not wait for the carriage to be yoked before setting out'? How can an imperial edict be defied? And the *Book of Zou* says: 'To the shores of the land, none are not the king’s subjects.' You cannot refuse." Though unworthy, I have composed a poem for you:

*A guest of the Three Peaks of Mount Hua,*
*Dwelling in seclusion, you count not the years.*
*Mist and rosy clouds sustain your livelihood;*
*Clouds and waters compose your verdant home.*
*You cultivate herbs by the thatched pavilion,*
*Plant pines by the ravine’s edge.*
*Though you but briefly leave your immortal cave,*
*You may yet answer the Emperor’s call.*

The Master, having read the poem, was pleased and responded with a verse of his own:
*In crane-feather cloak, fluttering like a carefree immortal,*
*How could rush mats bear the pull of profit and fame?*
*Lingering at Mount Hua, my heart aches at parting;*
*Gazing back at Cloud Terrace, my eyes strain with longing.*
*The world’s winds and waves are truly perilous;*
*Forgetting schemes, gulls and crows are at ease.*
*Just as I would lie down in my robes on the Three Peaks,*
*Another celestial missive descends from the sun’s edge.*

Having composed his poem, the Master set out with the envoy. He left a farewell poem for his hemp-clad Daoist friends in the mountains:
*Before the peaks of Mount Hua, two paths diverge,*
*Several thatched huts, a single stream of clouds.*
*You said my ears were dull—I knew this long ago;*
*Of people changing, people being wrong, I have heard nothing.*

The hemp-clad Daoist replied with a poem:
*Sitting alone in my thatched hut, far removed from the dust,*
*I carry neither alms bowl nor master, day by day.*
*Meeting others, I speak not of worldly affairs—*
*Thus am I one who, when asked, has no business to attend.*

The Master, receiving the poem, silently grasped its meaning. Taking his leave, he soon arrived at the capital with the imperial envoy and lodged at Establishing Prosperity Abbey. That night, as he lay abed, he heard the palace bell toll and sighed, composing two quatrains:

*A thousand gates, ten thousand doors, locked behind layered barriers,*
*Stars arrayed in the void, all hushed and still.*
*As the world’s right and wrong begin to quiet,*
*The night watch’s drum echoes through the six streets, the first watch announced.*

*The Silver River slants as night wanes,*
*Pillowed, the heart’s reckonings remain unceasing.*
*How pitiable are those entangled in the marketplace’s fame and profit—*
*How many are ensnared, their dream-souls bound in toil?*

The Master slept until the fifth watch, when the dawn bell rang. He sighed again and composed another poem:
*The jade clepsydra nears its end, the moon’s light sinks,*
*A single clear chime pierces the cold note.*
*It stirs the wanderer’s longing for home,*
*Stealthily deepens the parting traveler’s sorrow.*
*At the window, it startles open the eyes of fame and profit;*
*By the pillow, it awakens the heart of right and wrong.*
*Kings and emperors have all passed through this,*
*Dynasties rising and falling, even unto this day.*

Having composed his poem, he washed and dressed. As dawn broke, he instructed the envoy to enter the palace first and announce, "The Master has come to see the Emperor." The Emperor hastily commanded that he be brought before the palace gates and received in the Hall of Extended Glory. The Master wore a feathered robe, a Huayang cap, straw sandals, and a hanging sash. Received with the rites due a guest, he was granted a seat. The Emperor composed a poem and asked:

*"I know you have attained the Dao for many years,*
*Daily swallowing several grains of elixir.*
*Yet your temples show no white—how strange!*
*And your face retains its youthful glow—how doubtful!*
*Where do you lodge each night?*
*Upon what altar do you fast at dawn?*
*Would you deign to transmit your wondrous methods to this humble one?*
*I would fain be as carefree as you."*

The Master replied with a poem:
*I have attained the Dao for many years now,*
*Daily swallowing the elixir of the two qi.*
*When I drink the immortal’s brew, my temples darken;*
*After eating the peach of Penglai, my youth is restored.*
*At night, I lodge only at Cloud Terrace Abbey;*
*At dawn, I fast upon the Altar of Dharma Records.*
*If Your Majesty asks of my methods of cultivation,*
*In the depths of Mount Hua, true leisure may be found.*

Taizong, reading the Master’s response, was greatly pleased. At that time, the Emperor was preparing to campaign against Hebei. The Master admonished him to desist, but the army had already been mobilized. The Emperor commanded the Master to rest in the imperial gardens. When the troops returned, the campaign indeed proved fruitless.

After sleeping for over a hundred days, the Master finally arose. The Emperor, astonished, bestowed upon him even greater honors and favor. Taizong then spoke to Master Xiyi in a leisurely manner: *"My elder brother, the late Emperor Taizu, achieved great merit and profound virtue, yet you did not come to him. I, with humble merit and shallow virtue, have troubled you to descend to my vermilion steps."*

The Master replied: *"The late Emperor had no need for this poor Daoist, but Your Majesty could not avoid summoning me once."*

Taizong then asked: *"In the days when Yao and Shun ruled the world, could such a time be restored?"*
The Master answered: *"Yao and Shun had earthen steps three feet high and thatched roofs untrimmed—such traces seem unattainable. Yet if one governs with purity and stillness, then even today may become an age of Yao and Shun."* The Emperor approved of his words.

Taizong often invited the Master into the palace to converse, and later said to his chief minister Song Qi: *"Chen Tuan cultivates himself in solitude, untouched by power or profit—truly a man beyond the world."* He sent an imperial messenger to escort the Master to the Ministry of State, where Qi and others asked: *"Master, you have attained the Dao of profound silence and self-cultivation—can you teach it to others?"*
The Master replied: *"I have withdrawn to the mountains and wilderness, useless to the world. I know nothing of alchemical practices and have nothing to transmit. Even if I were to ascend to immortality in broad daylight, what benefit would it bring to governance? Your Majesty’s dragon countenance is noble and extraordinary, bearing the marks of both heaven and man. He comprehends the principles of order and chaos through the ages—truly a sagely and virtuous ruler. This is a time when ruler and minister unite in virtue to govern the realm. What cultivation could surpass this?"* Qi and the others recorded his words and presented them to the Emperor, who read them with great delight.

The Master, summoned by imperial crane-edict to the capital, arrived at court in rustic attire. Taizong, admiring his transcendent demeanor, received him with the rites due a guest rather than a subject, lodging him in the finest quarters. There, in the secluded Western Pavilion, the Emperor engaged him in discourse on the mysteries of the Eight Simplicities and Nine Perfections, the essentials of the Four Awakenings and Seven Verdancies. Yet the profound insights shared in their private conversations remained unheard by others.

Taizong commanded the Master to observe the future Emperor Zhenzong, then the Prince of Shou. Of the Emperor’s eight sons, Zhenzong was the third. The Master was led to the eastern palace, but the prince had not yet risen, so he turned back. When the Emperor inquired, the Master said: *"At the prince’s gate, even the servants are future ministers and generals. What more need one know?"* Those he had seen were the future Prime Minister Zhang Qi, Minister Yang Chongxun, and Marshal Guo Chengyou.

When the Master was summoned to the palace, he heard that scholar-officials sought him out, wishing only to hear virtuous words for self-improvement. He said: *"Do not return to places where fortune favors you. Do not linger in realms of ease, nor revisit lands of success."* Those who heard this regarded it as profound wisdom. As Master Kangjie’s poem says: *"Cherish the good words left by the perfected—what seems advantageous is truly a disadvantage."*

One day at leisure, Taizong ascended the Eastern Corner Tower with the Master to idly observe the market below. Seeing a wealthy man in a tower who rose late to wash and dress, the Emperor asked his attendants: *"Whose household is this?"*
Someone replied: *"One of the great merchants of the Eastern Capital."*
Taizong then recited a poem:
*"Before others rise, I am already awake,
At dawn, a thousand affairs weigh on my mind.
How enviable is this rich man of the Eastern Capital—
Sleeping till the sun is high, still not yet risen."*

The Master responded with a poem:
*"Last night at the third watch, I dreamed in alarm,
A single bell’s toll set ten thousand in motion.
Most likely another court assembly at the golden palace—
I, an officialless man, slept till dawn."*

The Emperor, delighted by the Master’s reply, intended the next day to appoint him as Remonstrance Grand Master. The Master firmly declined and instead composed *"The Song of Retiring from Office"* and a quatrain:

*The Song:*
*The Dao can be clear, the Dao can be still,
In clarity and stillness, seek true constancy.
Neither covet nor cling—let life drift as it will,
Nor learn the folly of the deluded, full of fear and trembling.
People laugh that I seek no office,
But office is the world’s greatest affliction.
Low rank means being controlled by others,
High rank means others groveling for favor.
Now through Qin, now through Zheng,
East and west like a worm on a string.
Until a hundred years pass without rest,
How does it compare to my pure stillness?
The moon as my lamp, water as my mirror,
A long-handled gourd holds my life’s breath.
Though none attend me when I come or go,
To my left, a golden tortoise; to my right, a crane guides me.
Drunk at sunrise, never to sober,
Yet again summoned by imperial decree.
People see me and laugh,
But my heart holds a different scene.*

*The Poem:*
*Feeding on primal qi, clad in woven grass,
I descend the mountain rarely, with nothing to do.
I do not encroach on the weaver’s or farmer’s gain,
Yet still others whisper of right and wrong.*

Seeing the Master’s firm resolve to refuse office and salary, Taizong asked if he had any strategies to aid the world and pacify the people, hoping to retain him. Master Xiyi replied: *"From childhood, I admired the Dao; in my prime, I wandered the mountains. My heart abides in tranquility, silently attuned to the subtle winds of the mysterious. As for strategies to aid the world, I have not yet given them thought. I am rather fond of sleep—if Your Majesty would permit, I would return to the mountains."*

He then composed *"The Lament of Resigning Office and the World"*:
*The Southern Dipper and Northern Dipper shift nightly,
The sun rises in Fusang, then sets in the west.
This world is as fleeting as wild horses,
The realm of fame as tumultuous as fermenting wine.
Pines and bamboo flourish, verdant even in winter,
Peach and plum blossoms scatter, spring’s allure fading.
Seeing through the dream of this dusty world,
In the depths of white clouds, one may dwell in seclusion.*

Taizong said: *"I summoned you hoping you would harmonize yin and yang, rectify the court’s governance, secure the state, and aid the people. Yet you speak only of the joys of the mountains and your love of sleep—is there truth in this?"*
The Master replied: *"Indeed."* He then presented *"The Sleep Song"*:
*I love sleep, I love sleep,
No felt mat, no quilted cover.
A slab of stone for my pillow,
A straw cloak spread upon the earth.
Sleeping north or south, east or west—
Wherever I please.
Thunder crashes, lightning splits, Mount Tai collapses,
The boundless sea pours into the void.
The Black Dragon roars, startling gods and ghosts—
Yet when I am weary, I snore in slumber.*

Idle thoughts drift to Zhang Liang, restless musings to Fan Li—what need to speak of Cao Cao, or mention Liu Bei?
A handful of gentlemen, quarreling over mere trifles of pride.
How could they compare to this servant,
On the crest of the Pure Wind Ridge, amid drifts of white clouds,
Brows unfurled, belly unknotted,
Taking a single long sleep?
What care if the crimson sun sinks in the west?

He later composed another verse:
*Ask what in this world is best—*
*Nothing surpasses rising late and sleeping early.*
*Before the hermitage, tangled grasses weave my robe;*
*Hunger is sated with pine seeds and mulberries, ever enough.*
*Once tripped by a mountain stone’s edge,*
*I could not rise, sleeping till dawn.*
*All call me foolish, lost in slumber—*
*Yet I pity their folly, burdened with cares.*

In the early years of Zhou Xiande, when visitors sought his dwelling, they found his door ajar, silence within—only the tracks of beasts and the cries of crows. A woodcutter on the mountainside once came upon his form, dust-shrouded, and drew near to see: it was the Master. Pressing a hand to his chest, he found it faintly warm; after a long while, breath returned, and the Master rose, saying: *"My sleep was deep and sweet—why disturb me?"* The prefect Luo Yanwei reported this to the court.

Taizong, knowing the Master would not be swayed from his refusal to serve, sought to send him back to the mountains. The emperor ordered artisans to gather goods before the Jade Gate, their songs and clamor boasting of the realm’s prosperity, then invited the Master to ascend the terrace. *"The capital’s abundance is thus—how can you bear to abandon me and return to the mountains, refusing to aid in governing the age?"* The Master replied: *"Birds and beasts nest in forests and foothills; fish and turtles roam rivers and lakes—each delights in its own way."*

Taizong pointed to the throngs of people and carriages below, asking: *"Do you see?"* *"I do,"* said the Master. *"What do you see?"* *"I see the rich clinging to life, the poor scrambling for fate."* Taizong fell silent. Soon after, he descended the Jade Gate and returned to the palace.

The next morning, the Master entered the court and firmly declined to remain, but the emperor earnestly sought his counsel on securing the world and aiding the people. The Master, without hesitation, took up brush and paper and wrote four characters: *"Far and near, light and heavy."* The emperor did not grasp their meaning. The Master explained: *"‘Far’ means to summon worthy scholars from afar; ‘near,’ to cast out sycophants close at hand; ‘light,’ to lighten the taxes of the people; ‘heavy,’ to heavily reward the three armies."* The emperor, hearing this, was greatly pleased.

Knowing the Master could not be detained, Taizong hosted a farewell banquet in the side hall, ordering the two chief ministers to attend and compose poems in his honor. He also commanded Wang Zuo, the prefect of Huazhou, to visit and inquire after the Master’s needs, ensuring nothing was lacking. From then on, whether wise or unworthy, all within the realm heard of his renown and admired him; countless wished to take up staff and mat to study under him.

As he prepared to leave the capital, the Master composed *"Parting from Court"*:
*Ten years of footsteps trod the red dust,*
*Longing for green mountains, I dreamed of them often.*
*Though the purple paths flourish, what compares to sleep?*
*Though vermilion gates be noble, poverty is better.*
*Grieved to hear swords and spears propping up a troubled lord,*
*Weary of listening to pipes and songs clamoring to intoxicate men.*
*I take my old books back to my old retreat—*
*Wildflowers, singing birds, the same spring as ever.*

Taizong, determined to see the Master return to the mountains, could not press him to stay. The emperor bestowed upon him a saddle adorned with tortoise and crane motifs, along with fine horses and other lavish gifts, but the Master firmly declined all but tea and medicine. He ordered an envoy to convey the Master in a comfortable carriage to the Cloud Terrace Abbey on Mount Hua, bestowing upon him the title *"Master of Rare Serenity."*

The imperial edict read:
*"To the Daoist Chen Tuan, a man of lofty virtue in this age, a guest of successive dynasties: drawn by the flourishing culture of our reign, you came to pay homage. Without a fitting title, how could your pure example be made known? Let it be decreed that you be granted the title ‘Master of Rare Serenity.’"*

Before parting, the Master left a quatrain:
*High on Mount Hua is my palace,*
*Stepping out, I ride the dawn wind through empty skies.*
*No need to lock the gates of its halls with golden bolts—*
*When I return, white clouds will seal them for me.*

In the early years of Taiping Xingguo, Taizong dispatched an envoy with a poem to summon him once more, but the Master declined, refusing to rise. Privately, he had foretold that the Mandate of Heaven truly rested with Emperor Zhangsheng. The imperial poem read:
*Once you emerged from white clouds of a former court,*
*Later news of you faded into silence.*
*If now you would heed the summons,*
*I would grant you all Three Peaks.*

The Master ultimately declined and did not go. The emperor then sent two women to attend him, to hold his towel and comb, but the Master refused them, replying with a poem:
*Snow for flesh, jade for cheeks—*
*Deep thanks to the lord for sending them to me.*
*This hermit never dreamed of Wu Gorge,*
*Vainly laboring clouds and rain to descend from Sunny Terrace.*

Another account holds that Emperor Xizong of Tang enfeoffed him as *"Recluse of Pure Emptiness"* and sent three palace women to tend to his needs, prompting him to compose a poem.

Taizong’s *"Ode to Master of Rare Serenity"*:
*The stalwart Daoist Chen Tuan of Mount Hua mingled in the world yet dwelled beyond it,*
*Nurturing the vast, uncarved qi, aligning with the Lesser Weaving Star of the recluse.*
*Unbowed before kings and lords, he kept his resolve in forests and valleys,*
*Delighting in our harmonious rule, rejoicing in this era of sagely succession.*
*Yet he journeyed far across rivers and roads, briefly visiting the capital,*
*Where for ten days he was received with warmth, his presence a great boon.*
*White clouds cannot linger in the imperial city,*
*Fine titles are hard to tempt a man of attainment.*
*Of old, the sagest Tang Yao had his external ministers in Chao and Xu;*
*Though my virtue is meager, I would follow this precedent.*
*Fearing some lack in the mountains, I have ordered Wang Zuo, prefect of Huazhou, to supply all your needs.*
*Now you return to your old peaks as spring begins—*
*Cherishing your lofty integrity, may you find all as it should be.*
*Thus I send this message of care—may you take it to heart.*
*The spring is cold—how have you been of late?*
*This letter cannot say all that is in my heart."*

The *"Edict Granting Tea and Silk"*:
*"Ah! I, enthroned as the Nine-Five, though I have waged war for years, do so with a heart set on benefiting all things. Recently, my phoenix banners marched south, and the lands beyond the Yangtze came to court. Sincerity was repeatedly pledged before the army, and tribute of rare goods was laid at the palace steps. Having shown their allegiance, I ordered the troops to disband."*

Having long since left the dusty world behind, you dwell high above mundane things, naturally attaining the joy of carefree wandering, your heart unshaken by favor or disgrace. In stilling the clamor of the fleeting, you are truly worthy of praise. Thus, I bestow these gifts equally to honor your reclusive life. Now I grant you the following:

The air of Hetong is crisp, the spirit of Lian Peak numinous. Having embraced the Dao and known your proper place, you surely enjoy abundant blessings. As I gaze from the palace terrace, my waking thoughts turn to you. May you take this to heart.

The summer heat—how have you been of late? This letter cannot say all that is in my heart.

I grant you thirty bolts of fine white silk, ten catties of wax-sealed tea, twenty catties of研膏 tea, and twenty catties of Yashan tea. Upon receipt of this edict, you may claim them.

Once, as you stood in the palace courtyard, you saw a golden figure holding a sword who cried out: "Your Dao is complete—you shall have a place of return." For autumn is the season when the myriad things gather and return, and so I shall withdraw to the west. At that time, you were already over seventy. You then journeyed to Mount Hua, where you found the ruined foundations of the ancient Yuntai Temple. Clearing away the brambles, you made your dwelling there to fulfill the prophecy of "return."

You composed *Fifty Stray Words from Three Peaks*. In those days, tigers preyed on people within the region. When you arrived at the place, you rebuked the tigers and ordered them to leave. From then on, they ceased their harm.

During the Yongxi era, as you chanted verses gazing at the Immortal’s Palm Peak and sat facing the cascading stream, you pointed to a patch of ground and said: "This was once the site of the North Star’s ancient abode. I once saw a divine being at night, clad in black robes and a crown, holding in his palm a vermilion script that read: *‘Here the Hall of Kai Tong, Palace of the Purple Tenuity Emperor.’*" You then explained: "Kai Tong arises from heaven and earth, and thus becomes the North Star." You ordered your disciples to construct it.

Hou Can and Zhang Guan, preparing for the imperial examinations, sought your counsel.

You said: "For the two scholars Hou and Zhang, success in the imperial examinations this year will not compare to next year." That spring, their names were struck from the examination roster, but the following year, both passed—just as you had foretold.

*Here ends Volume One of* The Record of the Recluse of Mount Taihua. *(Note: The character following* 竟 *appears as* 口 *in the original; the text is unclear, resembling* 碌*.)*

**Volume Two of** *The Record of the Recluse of Mount Taihua*
*Compiled and supplemented by Zhang Xia of Nezhai, Registrar of Hezhong Prefecture, with the honorary title of Dengshilang*

Earlier, when the loyal and upright Lord Zhang Guaiya visited Chen Tunan on Mount Hua to pay his respects, he expressed a desire to retire together on the mountain. Master Xiyi replied: "For others, this may not be possible—but for one such as yourself, I would gladly yield half my place. Yet you hold an official post, and such matters cannot be discussed. If a household were ablaze, would you not rush to its aid?" Lord Zhang took his leave, and Xiyi presented him with ten sticks of Xuanhao ink, a cake of Baiyuntai ink, and a corner of Shu zhan as parting gifts. To his disciple Bo, the lord remarked: "This meeting has driven my poetic impulses into the bustling world." Xiyi replied: "Take care, take care."

After seeing Lord Zhang off, Bo said to his fellow disciples: "This man is indifferent to worldly things. If he prospers, he will become a high minister; if not, he will lead armies." He then composed a quatrain for him:

*Seeking the heavens in Shu is but commonplace,*
*While feasts of song and dance rush to quell the flames.*
*If granted leisure in Jinling to age in peace,*
*Still must you tend the frost at your temples’ trace.*

At first, Lord Zhang did not grasp his meaning. Later, when he was reassigned to govern western Shu, he passed through Huayin in haste and had no time to visit Xiyi. He sent a poem to the master instead:

*Foolish, I refused to dwell in woods and springs,*
*Yet sought to place you in a stream so clear.*
*Now hurrying southward beneath the stars’ bright wings,*
*I turn my head, ashamed of Hua’s clouds so near.*

Upon his return from western Shu, Lord Zhang wrote another poem:

*Most men revere rank and glory’s sheen,*
*Crowding the roads to greet my eastern return.*
*Yet Hua’s high hermit must surely scorn me,*
*Who’ve lost all truth to chase a fleeting name.*

In his later years, Lord Zhang developed a sore on his temple that resisted treatment. He eventually petitioned to retire to Jinling, where he died of the affliction—just as Xiyi had foretold.

When the scholar Qian Ruoshui, later known as Lord Wenxi, was young, he visited Xiyi and sought to be invited into his mountain retreat. By the stove, he saw an elderly monk wrapped in tattered robes, eyes closed, warming himself by the fire. Qian bowed, but the monk only opened his eyes slightly. After a long while, Xiyi asked: "What do you think?" The monk shook his head and said: "He lacks such bones." Later, when Xiyi saw Qian again, he said: "At first, I saw your spirit and appearance were pure and refined, and thought you might cultivate the Dao of immortality. But this monk says you lack the bones of a transcendent—you are fit only to become a noble minister." Qian asked: "Who was that monk?" Xiyi replied: "The Daoist of the Hemp Robe."

*According to* The Record of Things Seen and Heard, *when Ruoshui was a candidate for the imperial examinations, he visited Xiyi on Mount Hua. Xiyi said: "Come again tomorrow." Ruoshui returned at the appointed time and saw an old monk sitting by the stove with Xiyi. The monk studied Ruoshui intently for a long while without speaking, then drew in the ashes with a fire poker, writing the characters* "cannot achieve" *(做不得). Slowly, he said: "A man swept back in the surging current."* Ruoshui took his leave, and Xiyi did not detain him. Later, Ruoshui passed the examinations, became Vice Minister of the Bureau of Military Affairs, and retired at the age of forty. Initially, Xiyi had seen in Ruoshui the bearing of an immortal, but his fate remained undecided. The monk, observing him, declared he "could not achieve" it—and so Xiyi did not keep him. Yet in being "swept back in the surging current," the path to transcendence was not far off. The monk was the Daoist of the Hemp Robe.

The recluse Li Qi of Huayang claimed: "During the Kaiyuan era of the Tang, few officials were ever seen. The hermit Lü Dongbin of Guanzhong possessed sword arts—able to traverse hundreds of *li* in an instant—and was regarded by the world as a divine immortal. He visited Xiyi’s abode several times, exchanging poems and songs as friends. People marveled at this." These are all accounts from old histories.

When Chen Yaozuo governed Huazhou, he paid a visit to Master Xiyi. After they had settled and begun talking, a Daoist with a striking presence—his eyes like dots of lacquer, truly a man among immortals—entered and took a seat. Xiyi hastily yielded his place of honor. They exchanged a few words, all concerning matters beyond the world. Soon, the Daoist took a jujube from his leopard-skin pouch and offered it to Yaozuo, who declined. Xiyi rose to accept and ate it. Shortly after, the Daoist took his leave, and Xiyi saw him out beyond the temple gates. When they resumed their seats, Yaozuo asked: "Who was that?" Xiyi replied: "Lü Dongbin." Yaozuo was filled with regret and astonishment.

When Wang Shize of Qingyuan and others visited the master, Shize, who had been a servant, bowed at the foot of the steps. Xiyi smiled and descended, saying: "He who humiliates others humiliates himself." He then invited Shize to sit to the right of the other scholars, declaring: "In the future, you will surpass all these gentlemen." The following year, Shize indeed ranked first in the imperial examinations.

One day, Xiyi remarked: "I once met the scholar Sun Junfang and the hermit Kang Pi. They told me: 'The Nine-Chambered Cliff on Mount Wudang is a suitable place for seclusion.' I went and dwelled there." When the remonstrance official Xu Zhongxuan, who had been dismissed from his post as governor of Chengdu, passed by his hut, Xiyi said: "Before long, you will be appointed to an external post again."

Soon after, Xu was promoted to Gentleman for Attendance and appointed Prefect of Henan. Yu, who had entered the capital for his annual audience, again sent a messenger bearing a letter and gifts to inquire about his fortunes. Xiyi said to his disciple Jia Desheng: "Write a reply for me to the Gentleman for Attendance. From this point on, he will never emerge from seclusion again." Before long, Yu indeed passed away.

Guo Hang, who in his youth had lived in Huayin, once lodged beneath the Daoist abbey. In the middle of the night, the master called out to him, urging him to return home at once. Hang, daunted by the distance, was reluctant to leave. The master accompanied him on the journey. After traveling one or two *li*, they heard someone crying out, bearing the news of his mother’s death. Only then did Hang realize that the master had given him medicine, and that if he had left promptly, he might have saved her. Upon arriving, he found that she had indeed died, but after administering the medicine, she revived.

In the oratory hung a large gourd from the wall. A Daoist named Jia Xiufu coveted it but dared not speak of it. Xiyi said to him: "You have come with no other purpose—you merely desire my gourd." He ordered his attendant to take it down and give it to him.

Shen Fang, styled Mingyi, had secluded himself in Baolin Valley on Mount Zhongnan. Hearing of the master’s reputation, he went to meet him. One day, Xiyi instructed him to sweep the courtyard, saying: "An esteemed guest will arrive." Sure enough, Mingyi appeared, dressed as a woodcutter, and bowed at the foot of the steps. Xiyi drew him up, saying: "You are no woodcutter. In the future, you will hold a prominent office, and your name will resound throughout the realm." Mingyi replied: "I have come for the sake of the Dao and virtue; official rank and emolument are not my concern." Xiyi smiled and said: "A person’s nobility or lowliness is determined by fate. Your bones are destined for such things. Though you may hide in the mountains and forests, I fear you will not find peace. In time, you will come to know this yourself."

Later, during the reign of Emperor Zhenzong, Mingyi was summoned to serve as *Sijian* and was led by the emperor’s own hand into the Dragon Diagram Pavilion to discuss matters of state. Upon resigning and returning to the mountains, he was appointed *Jianyidafu*, then later transferred to *Gongbu Shilang*. Xiyi also told Mingyi: "If you do not marry, you may attain a middling lifespan." Mingyi followed his advice. He died at the age of sixty.

Earlier, Xiyi had divined for Mingyi an ancestral burial site at the foot of Baolin Valley, but the grave’s precise location remained undetermined. After the burial, Xiyi remarked: "The land is indeed excellent, but the grave’s placement is slightly too far back. For generations to come, it will produce renowned generals." Though Mingyi never married and had no sons, from his nephew Heng onward, his lineage produced celebrated military commanders to this day.

After Xiyi’s passing, Mingyi erected a stele in praise of his master’s teachings, declaring: "The Way of emperors and kings is as fleeting as clouds. Master Xiyi possessed profound insight. He once admonished me: ‘One day, you will encounter a wise ruler. Without seeking office, your name will resound at the celestial gates and echo across the realm.’ A name is the finest vessel of past and present, yet the Creator guards against its perfection. Between heaven and earth, no name remains unblemished. When your fame rises, something will surely tarnish it—beware of this."

In his later years, Mingyi indulged in excessive adornment, amassing wealth around Feng and Hao. His disciples, relatives, and dependents also exploited their influence to expand their holdings, increasing their annual income. Thus, he lost his reputation for purity. At the time, Wang Sizong, the prefect of Jingzhao, drunkenly insulted him, and a formal impeachment was submitted to the court—only to be halted by a general amnesty.

In the eighth year of the Xiangfu era, one morning, Mingyi rose from his mountain retreat, gathered his disciples for a feast, and burned all his writings and medicinal texts. After several rounds of wine, he passed away—an extraordinary man to the end.

Master Xiyi was fond of studying the *Book of Changes* and transmitted his numerological teachings to Mu Xiu, whose name was Bolong. Mu taught Li Zhicai, whose name was Tingzhi. Tingzhi taught Shao Yaofu of Kangjie, who passed the teachings on to Shen Fang. Fang transmitted them to Xu Jian of Lujiang, who in turn taught Yi Kuachang—a lineage that spread southward. Yet the world only regarded Xiyi as a divine immortal or a master of physiognomy, unaware of his true depth.

One day, Xiyi suddenly told his disciple Jia Desheng: "A distinguished guest will arrive today. Go quickly and announce his coming." Soon after, a man in a short hemp robe and a green headscarf knocked at the door. Before Jia could report, the visitor vanished. Xiyi rushed out and pursued him for over a *li*, where he encountered an old man in deerskin. He asked: "Has the one ahead gone far?" The old man replied: "That was the immortal Li Babai. When he moves, he covers eight hundred *li*." Xiyi then realized the deerskin-clad figure was the Perfected White Deer of Great Clarity, a Daoist adept. Though he could not catch Li, the deer-clad master also disappeared without a trace.

Xiyi said: "I shall not remain in this world much longer." At the beginning of the *Duangong* era, he told his disciples: "Next year, after the Zhongyuan Festival, I will journey to Mount Emei. Have lamps lit day and night in the stone chamber." His disciples reverently received his writings and solemnly accepted his instructions, weeping in sorrow. Xiyi said: "Do not disrupt the natural order with your emotions—it would disturb my transformation."

As his end approached, Xiyi drafted a memorial, the contents of which no one saw. He sent his disciple Jia Desheng to the imperial court bearing the turtle and crane bestowed upon him, along with a dark-green horse. The emperor alone read the memorial for a long time, then returned the gifts to Desheng, further bestowing upon him a purple robe and the title *Wuzhen Xiansheng* (Perfected Awakened Master).

At the start of the *Duangong* era, Xiyi instructed Desheng: "You must carve a stone chamber in Zhangchao Valley." By the second year, on the seventh day of the seventh month, the chamber was completed. Xiyi joyfully rode his horse straight to the valley. Upon reaching the winding path where dawn broke over the bowl-shaped rock, he dismounted and climbed by grasping vines and creepers. By dusk, he arrived at the chamber, laughing heartily several times before telling his disciples: "This cliff rivals Mount Taihua in grandeur, its *qi* pure and its scenery sublime—this is where I shall return." He then wrote a memorial of several hundred words, the gist of which read: "The great cycle has ended; the sagely court is hard to leave. On the twenty-second day of this month, I shall transform my form beneath Lotus Peak, within Zhangchao Valley."

On the appointed day, lamps were lit. At dusk, he ordered them extinguished and instructed his disciples to rest. At dawn, he was found dead, his left hand propping up his cheek. He had lived one hundred and eighteen years. For seven days afterward, his limbs remained warm. A five-colored cloud shrouded the cave’s entrance, lingering for days without dispersing.

Later, an imperial envoy arrived at Mount Emei, where a visitor sought an audience. The man was imposing in dress and bearing, introducing himself as Dongming Zhuanshi. He spoke at length of matters concerning Mount Hua, and only afterward did the envoy realize this was Master Chen of Mount Hua. He hastily ordered the man summoned, but he had vanished without a trace.

He styled himself Fuyaozi. His disciples and fellow scholars who had gathered with him were all recorded afterward to inspire later generations.

Master Huian’s *Comprehensive Register of the Alchemical Furnace* states: During the reign of Emperor Shizong of Zhou, the reclusive Master Chen Tuan of Mount Hua was summoned to court and questioned about the arts of ascending to immortality and transmuting base metals into gold. He replied, “Your Majesty rules as Son of Heaven—should you not devote yourself to governing the realm? What need have you for such things?” The emperor then sent him back to the mountains, decreeing that local officials should regularly inquire after his well-being.

Hu Shi remarked: What Chen Tuan possessed was beyond Emperor Shizong’s comprehension. To ask about ascending to immortality and alchemy was indeed crude. Though Chen Tuan’s response about governing the realm hinted at the truth, Shizong failed to inquire further about the Dao of governance.

The master cleared the brambles and built his chamber atop the peak. During the Taiping Xingguo era, Emperor Taizong repeatedly bestowed edicts, gifts, and imperial poems upon him, summoning Chen Tuan to court. Officials were ordered to expand his hermitage, and funds from the imperial treasury were allocated to construct an altar and halls, the scale of which can still be seen today.

The master composed *Eighty Chapters on Pointing to the Mystery*, *Fifty Poems on Entering the Chamber and Returning to the Elixir*, and *The Angler’s Pool Collection* of over ten thousand characters. All these works meticulously expound the subtleties of the Dao, encapsulating the ultimate truth. His words are concise yet profound, allowing readers to grasp their meaning intuitively.

The master enlightened the emperor’s mind and subtly guided his grand designs. Taizong wished to appoint him as Remonstrance Grand Master, but the master firmly declined, and the decree was never issued. In the year of his transformation, he was one hundred and eighteen years old.

He claimed to perceive the hidden patterns of fate, knowing the future and discerning the past, delving into the profound and exploring the mysterious in ways nearly unfathomable. Yet he never engaged in bizarre or ostentatious practices. Thus, the master’s Dao remained vast and elusive, and those who heard of his renown—regardless of wisdom, foolishness, nobility, or humility—were all delighted by his example.

After the master’s passing, his disciple, the Venerable Zunshi Zeng, at the guidance of Minister Fan Wenzheng, obtained *Fifty Poems on Entering the Chamber and Returning to the Elixir* from Jingzhen Abbey in the capital, *Three Peaks’ Allegories* from the recluse Li Ning of Mount Taihua, *Eighty Chapters on Pointing to the Mystery* from Zhang Wumeng of Chicheng, and *The Angler’s Pool Collection* from the scholar Zhang Zhongyong. In total, over three hundred pieces were compiled into the master’s collected works, along with *Essentials of Nourishing Life* and *Li the Perfected One’s Methods of Ingesting Elixirs*.

An imperial poem bestowed upon him reads:
*Only within the self lies the great return,*
*The womb-spirit’s moon-palace hangs in autumn’s sky.*
*Who can distinguish the three numinous symbols?*
*The corpse’s purity and clarity arise naturally.*

The emperor also granted him a seal-script inscription of *Hall of Light* and a flying-white calligraphy of *Purity* and *Stillness*.

When Emperor Zhenzong offered sacrifices at Fenyin, he halted his procession at Huayin and twice visited the Cloud Terrace. Gazing upon the master’s portrait, he stood in contemplation for a long while. He then exempted the temple’s fields from taxes and summoned the Daoist Wu Zihua and others, bestowing upon them purple robes.

Zhang Fangping, traveling between Qin and Shu, reverently paid homage to the imperial portrait and later venerated the reclusive Master Chen. Reflecting on those who pursued immortality, he said: “The divine is formless, and the Dao is omnipresent. The divine is that which subtly permeates all things. Only through the divine can one achieve speed without haste, arrival without movement, and effortless union—this is the perfected person. Thus, one may transcend life and death, fathom transformations, and return to the primordial origin of *qi*’s cyclical flow, the natural essence and function of the four images. The profound principles of *Pointing to the Mystery* have already taken shape. How could the nine chambers below be merely a gathering place for deer and companionship with trees and stones?”

The master possessed a purple complexion and green veins, with striking features, square pupils, and a pure voice. His learning encompassed the Nine Schools and the Hundred Masters, all of which he saw through with penetrating clarity. His Dao was profound and inexhaustible, elusive and unpredictable. Truly, he would ride the clouds and mount the sun and moon, roaming beyond the four seas—how could he be compared to those who indulge in bizarre tricks and deceptive marvels to deceive the world and seek fame? What need had he for such things?

When the master was summoned as a recluse and granted an audience, he was offered the post of remonstrance official. Emperor Zhenzong treated him with exceptional courtesy, and his name resounded throughout the realm. Later, he requested to return to Mount Zhongnan, where he grew arrogant and insolent due to imperial favor.

When Wang Sizong governed Chang’an, the master arrived, and all officials from the vice-prefect downward bowed to him. The master merely inclined his head slightly and received them with hands lowered. Sizong inwardly resented this. When the master summoned his nephew to bow, Sizong remained seated to receive the obeisance. The master grew angry, but Sizong said, “Earlier, the vice-prefect and others bowed to you, and you supported them. This is but a commoner, yet I, a *zhuangyuan* graduate of high rank, am unworthy of your sitting to receive my bow?” The master replied, “You won your *zhuangyuan* by wrestling—what is there to boast of?” Enraged, Sizong submitted a memorial stating that the master’s talents and knowledge were unremarkable, that he was a fraud who stole empty fame, and that the emperor’s esteem and promotion of him to high office would invite ridicule and foster deceit. He also mentioned that when the emperor had summoned Wei Ye, Ye had shut his door to avoid the summons, whereas the master had secretly curried favor with powerful officials to recommend himself. He further exposed several of the master’s clandestine affairs. Though the emperor did not pursue either side, his regard for the master gradually waned.

When Zhong Fang retired to his estate on Mount Zhongnan, many disciples and scholars gathered around him. He was fond of wine and personally cultivated fields and forests to brew his own. His residence boasted the beauty of forests and springs, secluded and exquisite. Hearing of this, Emperor Zhenzong dispatched an imperial envoy with painters to depict the scene. When the painting was unveiled, the emperor summoned his ministers to view it, sighing in admiration.

Later, when Gantang Wei Ye’s dwelling was found to have a similarly secluded charm, the emperor sent artists to capture it as well. Thus, Wei Ye wrote a poem:
*Mu Xiu, Bozhang of Wenyang,*
*Later resided in Caizhou, learning from Tu Nan.*

Mu Xiu was bold and unrestrained in his youth, his temperament narrow and seldom agreeable, often traveling between the capital and Luoyang. Someone once inscribed his verses on a palace wall, and when Emperor Zhenzong saw them, he sighed in deep admiration, asking his attending ministers, "Whose poetry is this?" One replied, "It is Mu Xiu’s." The emperor said, "With writing like this, why have the ministers not recommended him?" Ding Jinqong, who was present, remarked, "This man’s conduct does not match his words." Thereafter, the emperor no longer inquired about him.

In truth, Bozhang and Jinqong had been friends in their commoner days. When Jinqong was appointed as an official to Kuizhou, Bozhang was still without office. They met at Hanshang, where Jinqong expected Bozhang to offer formal greetings first, but Bozhang left without even a bow. Jinqong bore a grudge, and thus spoke ill of him before the emperor. Later, when Jinqong was demoted to Zhuhai and passed through Daozhou, Bozhang wrote a poem:

*I marvel that under the virtuous Yu, governance failed,*
*Why were the Four Fiends not exiled to distant lands?*

This revealed their mutual enmity.

In the second year of Xiangfu, Bozhang passed the imperial examination under Liang Gu’s sponsorship and was appointed as a legal assistant in Haizhou. For composing a document as vice-prefect, he was stripped of his rank and banished to Chizhou. His collected works include the poem *"Autumn Gathering at Qiupu"* which recounts these events in detail. Later, upon receiving amnesty, he was assigned as a literary aide in Yingzhou, and thus was known in his time as Military Aide Mu.

In his old age, he grew increasingly impoverished. His family possessed Tang editions of the collected works of Han Yu and Liu Zongyuan, so he begged funds from close acquaintances, raised money to hire craftsmen to carve printing blocks, and printed several hundred copies. He carried them to the Xiangguo Temple in the capital, where he set up a stall to sell them. Bozhang sat beside the stall, and when several scholars approached to browse, he would snatch the books away, glaring and saying, "If any of you can recite a single piece without missing a word, I shall gift you an entire set." As a result, the books remained unsold for over a year.

Scholars of the time were preoccupied with tonal patterns and prosody, unaware of ancient-style prose. Bozhang was the first to advocate for it, followed later by Yin Yuan and the Zi brothers, Shi and Ru. He also transmitted his *Spring and Autumn* scholarship to Li Zhicai, styled Tingzhi, a native of Qingzhou, who was unconventional and unconstrained. Tingzhi studied under Bozhang with reverence, his nature stern and impatient—if slightly displeased, he would scold or reprimand. Yet Tingzhi served him with deference, as one would a father or elder brother, never showing weariness.

After passing the imperial examination, Tingzhi was appointed as a judicial officer in Mengzhou. Unrestrained and indifferent to formalities, he often clashed with the prefect, Lord Fan Zhongxian, who grew displeased. Yet Tingzhi remained unperturbed. Later, when Zhongxian was transferred to Yan’an as a military commissioner, many officials saw him off beyond the city limits, but Tingzhi only bid farewell in the outskirts. When others reproached him, he said, "If I were to see off the prefect in such a manner another time, it would be excessive. Sincerity should match propriety. Lord Fan does not truly know me, so to send him off beyond the borders would be insincere. How could I act insincerely toward him?"

Soon after, Zhongxian was demoted to governor of Anlu and passed through Luoyang. None of his former subordinates from the Three Cities visited him—only Tingzhi called on him. Zhongxian then began to praise him, and thus came to value him.

Shao Yaofu’s son once said: Tingzhi had served as magistrate of Gongcheng, under the jurisdiction of Weizhou. At the time, my late father, Kangjie, was observing the mourning period for his grandmother. He built a hut atop Baiyuan on Mount Sumen, living in plain clothes and coarse food for three years, tending the hearth himself to care for his grandfather. Tingzhi, hearing of my father’s diligent study and resolve, visited his cottage and asked, "What are you studying?" My father replied, "The learning for imperial examinations." Tingzhi said, "Beyond the imperial examinations lies the learning of principle and righteousness—do you know of it?" My father said, "I do not. I would gladly receive your instruction." Tingzhi said, "Beyond the learning of principle lies the learning of the patterns of things—do you know of it?" My father said, "I do not. I would gladly receive your instruction." Tingzhi said, "Beyond the learning of the patterns of things lies the learning of nature and destiny—do you know of it?" My father said, "I do not. I would gladly receive your instruction." Thereupon, my father transmitted his learning.

Tingzhi later served as Palace Attendant and Acting Judicial Officer of Zezhou. Liu Yisou of Ze, though late in joining his school, studied calendrical astronomy under him and became renowned as a scholar. As for the study of the *Yijing*, only my father truly mastered it.

In his youth, Kangjie (Shao Yong) was self-assured in talent, ardent and ambitious. As his learning deepened, he aspired to lofty heights, believing the affairs of the former kings could surely be realized. Yet as his years advanced and his virtue matured, he turned his mind to the sublime and luminous. Observing the movements of Heaven and Earth, the waxing and waning of yin and yang, he grasped the transformations of the myriad things. Thereafter, he yielded in compliance, his spirit vast in return. For thirty years in Luoyang, he dwelt in a thatched hut with walls of woven reeds, barely shielding him from wind and rain, tending the stove himself to care for his parents. Yet he lived with ease, lecturing at home, never forcing his teachings upon others. Still, those who sought his counsel grew daily. The villages and towns were transformed by his influence, and his renown spread near and far. Scholars traveling to Luoyang would bypass the official residences to visit his humble abode.

The Master’s virtue and qi were pure and unadulterated. In speech, he always grounded himself in benevolence, righteousness, loyalty, and trust. He delighted in extolling others’ virtues but never spoke of their faults. Thus, the worthy rejoiced in his virtue, while even the unworthy were transformed by his influence. His contributions to enriching customs and cultivating talent were immense.

The Master’s learning came from Li Tingzhi, who received it from Mu Bochang. Tracing its origins, its lineage was long and well-founded. Yet the Master’s learning was pure and untainted, vast and boundless—much of it was his own attainment. Though summoned to office, he declined, responding to his fellow villagers with this poem:

*Through life I’ve done no knitted-brow deeds,*
*The world should harbor no gnashing teeth.*
*Why need rain to send off falling blossoms?*
*Must spring adorn old things anew?*
*Fortunate to live under Yao and Shun as true sovereigns,*
*I leave the recluses to their hermitage beyond court.*
*A sick man of sixty knows his place—*
*Why trouble the overseers with vain pleas?*

Zhang Shizheng’s teeth had grown sparse and loose by age fifty. More than a decade later, Chen Hong recorded in *Dai Li Ruo Dao* that he once obtained a medicinal formula, which his uncle said: "During the *Tian Sheng* era of the Yuan and Heng reigns, I ascended Mount Hua’s summit and reached the old foundation of the Bright Star Shrine, where I found a broken stele. Its inscription bore an ancient text—a song for a remedy to blacken hair and strengthen teeth:

*Soap pods, ginger fresh, and wild guess,*
*Shengma from the West, Shu dihuang from the land of Shu.*
*Mulberry twigs, eclipta, and pagoda-tree fruit,*
*Asarum, lotus stems, and lotus leaf hearts—all in equal measure.*
*Burn with green salt in equal parts, then grind to fine powder,*
*And use it well to firm teeth and darken hair.*
*Who would know the world holds such an immortal’s formula?*

This was the formula of Master Xiyi.

The scholar-recluse Wei Ye, styled Zhongxian, was a native of Shanzhou. He lived in a thatched cottage in the eastern outskirts, where water and bamboo created a scene of refined beauty. Fond of playing the zither and composing poetry, he lived in austere simplicity yet was widely known in his time. The prefects before and after all treated him with respect. When the emperor offered sacrifices at Fenyin and passed his dwelling, he saw Wei Ye from afar beneath the pines, teaching cranes to dance. The True Ancestor said, "I must visit this place." He sent word ahead, but as the imperial carriage drew near, Wei Ye carried his zither and led the cranes over the wall to depart. The emperor arrived at the mountain hermitage but did not find him. He left a note on the door, saying: "I came with Kou Zhun."

Later, an envoy was sent to summon him, but he declined on grounds of illness. Wei Ye wrote a poem in praise of Minister Kou:

*All former ministers came and went in haste,*
*Yet you alone remained in office for fifteen autumns.*
*Having completed rites at Mount Tai and Fenyin,*
*Now you may well accompany Red Pine on his wanderings.*

Kou read it and beamed with delight, responding with gifts of wine, tea, and medicinal herbs.

*The Plain Compilation* states: My late father’s letters contained several copies of this poem in Kou’s own hand. At dawn, upon receiving the poem, he was moved to reflection. Though he repeatedly declined due to illness, he was eventually promoted to Grand Commandant and Supervisor of the Jade Purity Luminous Response Abbey.

*Accounts of the Late Wang Wenzheng* records Wei Ye’s words to Kou Zhun: "Since ancient times, those whose merit and fame shook the world have seldom met a good end." He then presented this poem:

*Go well to heaven and renounce wealth and honor,*
*Then return to the earth to become a divine immortal.*

When Kou was later demoted, he regretted not heeding Wei Ye’s advice.

*Collected Works of Master Wen* notes: Wei Ye’s son, named Xian, also declined office. During the *Huang You* era, he was granted the title "Recluse of Pure Leisure."

Thus concludes *Records of Mount Hua and Master Xiyi*, Volume Two.
