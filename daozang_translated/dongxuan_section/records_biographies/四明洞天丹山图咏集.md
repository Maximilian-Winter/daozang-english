**Preface to the *Yong Collection of the Illustrated Dan Mountain in Siming Grotto-Heaven***
By Canghai Yishi, Zeng Jian of Linchuan

Siming Mountain lies upon the Eastern Sea. The mountain has four apertures that pierce through, their light illuminating the heavens. When the skies clear after rain, they appear like windows or doors. The locals call them "Stone Windows," and thus the mountain takes its name. During the Tang, a prefectural seat was established at present-day Yuyao, and the commandery was named *Ming* after the mountain. In the Song, the old seat of Qingyuan was changed, and a county was established. In the present dynasty, the prefecture was elevated, and the mountain fell under Yuyao, a hundred *li* south of the seat.

The illustrations are carved at the temples and abbeys at the mountain’s foot. The first is the *Illustration of Yuanjian Abbey*; the second, the *Illustration of Tangqian Abbey*—together, they are called Siming Mountain. Mu Xuanxu said: "Among the thirty-six grotto-heavens under heaven, Siming ranks ninth, its title being *Dan Mountain and Crimson Waters*." Upon examination: the mountain connects with Dalan Mountain, its terrain coiling and binding, extending three hundred and eighty *li* in circumference, with two hundred and eighty peaks rising two hundred and ten *zhang*. Perpetual clouds and mist shroud its midst, unbroken for twenty *li*. This stretch is called *Guoyun*; to the south, *Yunnan*; to the north, *Yunbei*. Thirty *li* along the ridges stands a peak called *Santai Mountain*, with *Pingfeng*, *Shiwu*, and *Yungen*. Between *Shiwu* and *Yungen* hangs a waterfall like a suspended river, called *Chanyuan Cave*.

Beside *Santai* lies *Longshu*. In the Later Han, Liu Gang of Xiapi, then magistrate of Shangyu, resigned his post and, with his wife Fan Yunqiao, dwelled in *Chanyuan Cave*. From White Lord, they obtained the arts of immortality. Above it flows *Xiyao Stream*, where they refined their studies. Upon completion, they gathered with friends atop Dalan Mountain, climbed a towering cedar, and with a single wave of his hand, Liu summoned his wife. Together, they ascended as immortals, leaving behind only their forms below, which transformed into recumbent tigers. Later generations named the mountain in their honor. A pavilion, *Fan Pavilion*, was built, where the recluse Kong You of the Liang later resided. Once, he saw several hundred *hu* of coins in the valley; when woodcutters scrambled to take them, they turned to rubble. A deer, struck by an arrow, fled to Kong, who healed and reared it. When cured, it departed. Thus, a *Deer Pavilion* was built beside the shrine.

During the Yongding era of the Chen, a certain Fang Yi built an abbey, repurposing the old shrine, hence called *Keyu Abbey*. In the eleventh year of Tianbao of the Tang, envoys were sent to offer prayers at the shrine, but the path was deemed too perilous. Daoist monks and the scholar Li Jian relocated it outside *Chanyuan Cave*, near the You River post. In the Song, Wu Jun Zhenyang of Longhu Mountain’s Erhua Abbey, styled *Master Undisturbed*, studied under the Celestial Master Zhang Yujing. Traveling here, he took residence. Emperor Huizong summoned him to the *Ningshen Hall* to register his name, but he declined. In the sixth year of Zhenghe, the court expanded the abbey, constructing the *Jade Emperor Hall*, and inscribed its plaque: *Grotto-Heaven of Dan Mountain and Crimson Waters*. Liu Gang was enfeoffed as *Ascended Mystery Illustrious Perfected Lord*; Fan Shi, as *Ascended Perfected Wondrous Transformation Primordial Lady*. *Master Undisturbed* was appointed *Danlin Gentleman*. Logging was forbidden, and taxes were remitted.

Prime Minister Zhang of Gaozong’s court knew his disciple Kong Rong and, on his recommendation, petitioned for *Master Undisturbed* to be named a Perfected. The court permitted the annual ordination of one Daoist, transmitted in order of seniority. In the first year of Jiaxi, Emperor Lizong offered sacrifices at the *Longrui Abbey* in Kuaiji. Upon completion, golden dragons and jade tablets were interred here. Now, Master Mao Yongzhen of the *Sanhua* lineage presides over it.

The mountain’s trees are called *qingling*, their fruit sweet but inedible when split. Its beasts are called *ju* monkeys. During the Xiantong era of the Tang, Xie Yichen retired here. Lu Guimeng and Pi Rixiu often visited, each composing nine poems, which they took as their themes.

Lu You of the Song recorded: "Twice I sailed the sea on official business, departing from Qingyuan’s waters, skirting Yuyao, and ascending four times in all. Gazing west, the distant peaks appeared as faint as wisps of cloud, piercing the very edge of heaven. The helmsman pointed and told me: ‘That is Great Orchid Mountain.’ Upon reaching the capital, I happened to meet Master Xue Yifu, who had just come from the abode of Master Mao the Venerable. He showed me two scrolls, and through them I glimpsed the mountain’s wondrous beauty—longing to wander its heights and depths, to roam with a few carefree scholars, to sit in Deer Pavilion, to drink from the murmuring stream, to call the *ju* monkeys, and thus to wash away the dust of worldly toil and the press of official duties. In the past, as my boat passed by, I could only gaze in longing and sigh. Nowadays, scholars and officials are drowned in the pursuit of profit and advancement. The highest cannot emulate Liu Wang, who cast off his sandals and cap to wander free; the next cannot match Pi and Lu, who forgot all rank in their shared verses. Is it any wonder that those who stand above the world are met with scorn and spit, while men call this place a Grotto-Heaven? I have therefore set down its origins in full, that those who aspire to transcend the mundane may find something to contemplate."

*Eulogies and Illustrations of the Red Mountain of the Four Brightnesses’ Grotto-Heaven*
Collected by Mu Xuanxu of the Tang
Annotated by He Zhizhang of the Tang

The Four Brightnesses’ name is Heaven of Crimson Waters,
Its numinous traces and sacred marks are of heaven’s own making.
Two hundred and eighty peaks stand linked,
And within their caves and halls dwell many immortals.

According to the *Records*, this mountain has seventy peaks on each of its four sides, totaling two hundred and eighty, arrayed like a screen. Its eastern face rises like startled waves, seventy towering peaks lined in misty ranks. A single stream flows into Gouzhang, and two immortals’ virtue shines in this nurturing land. The two immortals are Dong An and Bao Quan. Quan possessed the conduct of a sage, and An the merit of filial devotion. The *Records* state that these earthbound immortals both emerged in the Later Han. When the First Emperor’s divine general, Wang Yin, drove mountains to dam the sea, he drowned in the flood. Buried beneath the waters without filling the gap, he gave his name to Yin River, which remains to this day. The Four Brightnesses’ other name is Gouzhang, and its river is called Yin River, which flows into the great ocean.

Before Great Thunder Mountain lies the Quiet Water Grotto,
Where Xie Tiao once dwelt, reading and chanting sutras.
Thus it was named Great Compassion, and linked to Compassion Creek,
For all its springs and waterways share a single source.

Great Thunder Mountain was once home to many birds and beasts, and hunters often defiled its grottoes. Later, immortals summoned a great thunderstorm to block their way, and the mountain took its name from this event. In the Jin and Han dynasties, many worthies and adepts of the Dao concealed themselves here. Within lies the Golden Hawk Grotto. Several peaks resemble lotus petals, their forms touching the Pear Isle Grotto. A clear spring flows down to a small stream, sustaining several hundred households in their livelihoods. Nearby stands Hibiscus Peak, close to Pear Isle Grotto. In the Jin dynasty, Xing Zisun of the Gong clan entered this mountain and saw ripe pears by the path. He ate two or three and felt full. When he returned to look again, the place had vanished. Thus it was named Pear Isle.

Flanking peaks rise steeply, their forms jagged and towering, with a stone casket at the summit holding immortal honey. Below lies a dragon pool, its depths plunging a hundred fathoms, and a stone chamber hidden deep within, its secrets securely sealed.

This is Honey Rock Peak, where atop the stone casket rests the immortal honey. Once, celestial omens stirred here, and below, the dragon pool became a site for both public and private prayers. Further down lies another pool, named Stone Essence. Within its waters stands a stone chamber, storing the esoteric scriptures of immortals. In the time of Yu the Great, the reclusive scholar Wang Zhen personally opened it and marveled at its wonders.

To the southwest, the mountain resembles a charging ox, its ridges burning in succession like linked hooks. Seventy peaks, great and small, stand in count, while the mountain’s base splits into two branches, connecting to Yuezhou. At its foot lie the counties of Yuyao and Shangyu, part of Zhaozhou, where both land and water routes converge.

Hidden Peak crouches like a parrot in repose, its secluded ridges soaring in a hundred varied forms. Among its peaks—three here, five there—immortals wander daily. To the southwest, the mountains take on strange shapes, with three or five extraordinary peaks emerging and vanishing amid the mist.

In the Han dynasty, Zhang Heng once paused here, cutting timber to fashion his staff. The leftover planks, three or five heaps, gleamed with the hue of purple gold, their resonance and luster truly divine. Four carved lions guard the corners, enduring through eons without decay. Thickets of bamboo grow by the streamside, while medicinal herbs and immortal fruits flourish in abundance.

Here, Zhang Ziping of the Han once felled trees. The remaining planks, three or five piles, shimmered like purple gold, perpetually veiled in clouds and mist. Long ago, Zhang Chong saw these planks, took a five-inch piece, and presented it to the governor of Kuaiji. When carved into a butterfly, the wood soared into the heavens.

Amidst the emerald cliffs, sheer stone walls rise thousands of feet, obstructing clouds. Within grow wondrous fruits that sate hunger, and streams that channel the pulse of the sea. When the Jin immortal Ge Xuan arrived at this mountain, he saw fish in the stream, six or seven feet long. As he struck one with his staff, the mountain spirit appeared, warning: *"Do not harm it—the stream flows to the great ocean, and these fish often come from the sea."*

In the Wei dynasty, a man named Yang Dezhu once encountered mountain immortals by the roadside. Two immortals, holding fire and seeking a golden blade, carved images and inscribed words, giving rise to this tradition.

Yang Dezhu wandered this mountain when suddenly he encountered an old man, who said, *"Go forward and you will see two immortals holding fire and seeking a blade. Observe closely."* Dezhu indeed saw them, and explained: *"The two fires form the character 'flame' (炎), and seeking the golden blade completes 'arrive' (到). Thus, this is called 'Han carving' (刻汉)."*

To the mountain’s south, its peaks stand like driven sheep, seventy ridges arrayed in formation. In the Han dynasty, Liu and Ruan lost their way for seven days—by the time they returned, six generations of their descendants had perished. There were two men, Liu and Ruan, who went together to gather herbs. After seven days at the immortals’ abode, they came back, only to learn three hundred years had passed. Returning home, they beheld their seventh-generation descendants.

Within lies a great pond of several *mu*, where cave-dwelling immortal serpents often exhale *qi*. It transforms into clouds and rain, forming towers and terraces, its waters flowing into several streams like the Dan Creek. As the waters carry forth immortal herbs, the elders have long called it Herb Creek (*Xun Han*).

The White Cliff’s waterfall cascades like flying silk, all merging into the Purple Creek in boundless flow. Amidst stands a mountain shaped like an overturned basin, its tangled woods and riotous blossoms a tangle of chaos. Two peaks, named Great and Lesser Obscurity, shroud the sun in gloom, veiled by light mists. Woodcutters say that Ying Ze once roamed here, where stone beds stretch for *zhang*, graced by auspicious clouds.

In the Song dynasty, Ying Ze entered the mountain and suddenly found himself in a realm of surpassing beauty. When he returned, it had vanished—only darkness remained, and he dared not linger. Thus, the peaks were named Great and Lesser Obscurity. The Purple Creek is the White Water viewed from nearby.

Among its immortal beasts is the rhinoceros. Fan Yan once captured one, and its hide became a robe. When worn, it rendered the wearer invisible, concealing form and leaving no trace. In the Liang dynasty, Fan Yan came to this mountain and saw several rhinoceroses. He slew one, flayed its hide to make a robe, and when he donned it, his form vanished—no one could see him. Thus, it was called the Cloak of Concealment.

The mountain’s northern face winds like a slithering serpent, its perilous ridges layered without end or shore.

The seventy peaks here are numerous and grand, their ridges resembling eight interwoven nets of kidneys. To the north lies the entrance to Spirit Mountain, its form like a ceremonial screen, its layered ridges mirroring the slithering serpent’s motion. Two mountains surge forth like opposing ranks, parting to draw forth a long ravine that divides like a towering wall. Embracing Child Mountain’s summit is a level stone chamber, where springs flow sweet as nectar, concealing immortals within. Zheng Hong once explored the *Classic of Mountains and Seas*, which lists this spring by name. Called the Sacred Water, its taste is smooth and sweet; those who drink it attain longevity.

Two mountains stand face to face, their center cleft by a ravine whose waters diverge in four directions—now commonly called Great and Lesser Brightness. In the Song dynasty, Zheng Hong sought this spring’s course and drank from it; within the stone chamber, he beheld a sacred image. In recent times, no divine immortals have been heard of near its borders.

Within the Four Brightness Mountains lies a crouching tiger, its body formed of verdant stone, its ancestor. Carved with seven apertures, it exhales auspicious clouds, each cavity capable of summoning wind and rain. The heart of Four Brightness Mountain is named Crouching Tiger Mountain, where red stones and catalpa trees stand, each bearing seven apertures, all dwelling places of dragon spirits. As the *Classic of Mountains and Seas* states: "A mountain without apertures cannot be a famous mountain."

A stone vault stores books, a granary holds grain for washing—its taste is rich and sweet. A single twisted tree, two hundred feet long, shines with light that illuminates the mountain’s peak at night. Mei Fu once lodged in this vault and saw its books, countless in number. It is said that during the Qi dynasty, a woodcutter named He Xin encountered a granary of salt. Taking a small portion home to his mother, they found its taste sweet. Within days, her white hair turned black again, her complexion as youthful as a child’s. When he returned to retrieve more, the granary had vanished. He also saw a twisted tree, over twenty *zhang* in length, lying across the mountain’s belly, perpetually emitting a radiant glow visible to all.

Bound to the west by Gouzhang and Yu’s Grotto, to the south it connects with Tiantai, threading through the earth’s bones. To the north, it cradles the emerald expanse, cherishing its source—where earthly saints and heavenly immortals appear and vanish. These mark the four boundaries of Four Brightness Mountain.

Its expanse winds broadly across eight hundred *li*, its ancient numinous wonders too many to record. Mei Fu became an immortal dwelling on this mountain, while Magistrate Liu Gang and his wife, Lady Fan, attained the Dao here. During the reign of King Jing of Zhou, the righteous man Yi Chang wandered this mountain and was the first to ascend as an immortal. Later, Mei Fu also journeyed here and dreamed one night in a chamber that a man told him: "During the Zhou, Yi Chang transformed in this mountain’s chamber; his bones are hidden in the Heavenly Well." The next morning, he indeed found them in the Heavenly Well—though not yet decayed—and buried them.

During the Later Han, Liu Gang, styled Bojing, served as Magistrate of Shangyu. He and his wife, Lady Fan Yunqiao, resided on Four Brightness Mountain and both attained the Way. One day, they ascended Great Orchid Mound’s hill and, climbing a towering tree, soared into the sky.

**Eulogy for Magistrate Liu of Shangyu in Wu**
The Magistrate, styled Bojing, named Gang, was a native of Xia’na. He first dwelled on Four Brightness Mountain, later becoming Magistrate of Shangyu. He studied the Dao under Master Bai, and after years of cultivation, his Way was perfected. He invited his kin and friends to gather, and after the feast, he climbed a great cedar tree, over ten *zhang* above the ground. Raising his hand in farewell, he suddenly flew into the clouds and departed. His wife, Lady Fan, also possessed the Dao’s protection, and together they ascended to heaven. Today, White Water Abbey stands as their legacy. These events are recorded in the *Biographies of Divine Immortals* by Ge Zhichuan and the stele of White Water Abbey.

**Eulogy:**
How many celestial beings dwell in this dust?
Bound by ears and eyes, they mistake falsehood for truth.
Yet Magistrate Liu ascended to heaven as if visiting a neighbor—
Like water poured into water, kindred spirits naturally unite.

**Eulogy for Master Kong of the Song**
The Master’s given name was You, his style lost to history, a great-grandson of Kong Jingkang. His conduct was so virtuous it moved the gods, and he secluded himself on Four Brightness Mountain in Kuaiji. Once, he saw several hundred *hu* of coins in a mountain valley, indistinguishable from tiles and stones. Woodcutters scrambled to take them, but in their hands, the coins turned to sand and pebbles. A deer, struck by an arrow, once fled to him; he nursed its wound until it healed, then released it.

Governor Wang Sengqian sought to appoint him as his chief clerk, but the Master could not be swayed.

Master’s son Daohui was on close terms with Du Jingqi. From youth, he cultivated lofty conduct and carried on his family’s legacy. He secluded himself on South Mountain and never once gazed toward the capital. When the Prince of Yuzhang of the Qi summoned him to serve as West Section Clerk, he did not go.

The village elders revered and admired him. Daohui’s nephew Zong, his elder brother’s son, was likewise of upright character. When he suffered from cold and hunger and could not obtain clothing or food, the county magistrate Qiu Zhongfu recommended him for the post of Gentleman-in-Attendance to the Prince of Jingling, yet he too refused to go.

This is recorded in the *Praise for the "Biographies of Recluses"* in the *History of the Southern Dynasties*:
Greedy men chase profit,
some even die clutching jade.
Yet he remained unmoved,
treating it as mere tile and stone.
The pure breeze nurtured his nature;
his nephew’s keen discernment followed.
A single family’s unsullied integrity—
his ancestor’s virtue passed down.

**Inscription for Four Brightness Mountain**
Composed by Wei Su of Linchuan, Serving Gentleman for Rendering Literary Texts, Gentleman for Court Writings, Concurrently Compiler of the Bureau of National History

Seventy *li* south of Yuyao rise two hundred and eighty peaks, bound to the east by Juzhang, touching Tiantai to the south, and embracing Cuiqie to the north. The central peak is the highest, its summit bearing four caverns like open doors and windows, channeling the light of sun and moon—hence the name Four Brightness Grotto-Heaven. Perpetually veiled in clouds, when the First Emperor of Qin ordered his minister Wang Yin to drive mountains and dam the sea, the myriad spirits, wearied by labor, fled into this land, whence it was also called Ghost-Hiding Mountain.

During the Han, Liu Gang, styled Bojing, a native of Xia’na, served as magistrate of Shangyu. Later, he dwelled in these mountains and, following the White Lord, attained the ranks of the immortals.

One day, bidding farewell to kin and friends, he ascended Great Orchid Mound, grasped a towering tree, and soared into the heavens. His wife, Lady Fan, followed him, leaving her sandals beneath the tree, which transformed into a tiger. Word of this reached the court, and a shrine was erected on the site, where spring and autumn sacrifices were offered.

During the Song, the recluse Kong You saw several hundred *hu* of coins scattered among the valleys, indistinguishable from pebbles and tiles. Woodcutters scrambled to gather them, only for the coins to crumble into sand and gravel. A deer, struck by an arrow, came to Kong You for refuge; he sheltered it, and once its wound healed, it departed.

In the third year of the Tianbao era of the Tang, Emperor Xuanzong, deeming the shrine of Master Liu too perilous and remote, commanded the Daoist priest Cui Jie and the scholar Li Jian to rebuild it twenty *li* downslope at the site where Master Liu had cultivated the Dao. In the late Song, the eminent scholar Xie Yichen retired here. Lu Guimeng and Pi Rixiu both visited, composing nine poems each in mutual exchange.

During the Zhenghe era of the Song, Emperor Huizong inscribed a plaque reading: *Cinnabar Mountain and Vermilion Waters Grotto-Heaven*. He ordered the construction of a Jade Emperor Hall, employing the methods of Daoist adepts, and cast golden dragons and jade tablets, which remain to this day. The supervision of the temple’s rituals has been passed down through successive generations. In the present dynasty, as part of the state’s veneration of sacred mountains, offerings of incense and silk have been bestowed here as well. Yet the halls have fallen into disrepair, and none have taken heed.

Originally affiliated with the Three Flowers Abbey of Mount Longhu, the temple was later established in Guangxin. Mao Yongzhen, who succeeded to its care, expanded its buildings, making them worthy of a dwelling for immortals. His disciple, Wu Guohong of Linchuan, requested an inscription in seal script to be carved into the mountain stone. The inscription reads:

*Amidst the peaks of Yue’s mountains,*
*Stone grottoes gleam like latticework.*
*When heaven wills rain,*
*Floating clouds shroud the heights.*
*The Perfected One ascended, leaving wooden sandals behind;*
*An ancient cavern murmurs with flowing water.*
*White cranes circle and wheel,*
*Or alight beneath canopies.*
*Jade lads pluck green tangerines—*
*Whoever eats them shall never die.*

This inscription was composed by me, Su, to serve as a testament for a thousand years.

*Record of White Water Abbey*

During the Zhizhi era, I was studying at Mount Longhu when I shared lodgings with Master Zhu Zhenyi of my hometown. His disciple, Mao Yongzhen, attended him closely—reticent, refined, and unassuming. When he withdrew, he would visit me, and we spoke at leisure with ease. Later, he retreated into the mountains of Yuyao, and his voice faded into the distance, beyond hearing.

Twenty-eight years later, his disciple Wu Guohong came to the capital to request an inscription for their abode on Four Brightness Mountain. Only then did I inquire after Master Mao’s well-being. I wrote the inscription as requested. Another twelve years passed, and Master Zhu’s disciple, Xue Yishi, brought forth the engraved mountain map, asking me to supplement what had been omitted. Thus, forty years have passed since I last saw Master Mao.

Though I now draw a salary from the imperial ranks and am mired in worldly affairs, I hear that he drifts aloft in seclusion along the solitary shores of the sea, his mind and thoughts serene, seeking nothing beyond the slightest trace from the world. I can only admire him.

The matters I have recorded include: Magistrate Liu Gang of Shangyu and his wife attaining transcendence; the recluse Kong You transforming coins and healing the wounded deer; Emperor Xuanzong of the Tang relocating the shrine; Lu Guimeng and Pi Rixiu exchanging poems; Emperor Huizong of the Song inscribing the *Grotto-Heaven* plaque, constructing the Jade Emperor Hall, and casting golden dragons and jade tablets.

As for the sights at the old shrine, they include Ascension Mountain, Ascension Tree, Southern Cloud, Northern Cloud, and Passing Cloud. The *Gazetteer of Kuaiji* states that Xie Yichen retired at Nanlei; today, there is a Great Thunder Peak, which was not depicted in the earlier map.

The map includes Three Terraces Peak, Cloudroot Stone House, Dragon’s Whiskers, Washing Medicine Stream, and Murmuring Grotto. The *Gazetteer of Four Brightness Prefecture* records: "One hundred and thirty *li* to the northeast, the peaks surge into two hundred and eighty, with thirty-six peaks at the center, each direction having its gate. From Yuyao, this is called Western Four Brightness"—these details I had not previously recorded.

During the Song, Wu Zhenyang, a disciple of the Celestial Master Zhang of Empty Tranquility, studied at the Three Flowers Abbey of Mount Longhu under the name *Master of Simplicity*. Emperor Huizong summoned him as Gentleman of the Vermilion Forest and Registrar of the Hall of Concentrated Spirit, but he declined. Liu Gang was enfeoffed as *Perfected Lord of Ascended Mystery and Illuminated Righteousness*, and his consort, Lady Fan, as *Perfected Lady of Ascended Mystery and Wondrous Transformation*. Chancellor Zhang, Duke of Wei, befriended Wu’s disciple Zhu Kongrong and petitioned for his enfeoffment as a Perfected One. Kongrong’s descendants have since passed down the lineage through successive generations—these details I had also not previously recorded.

Master Mao constructed the Pavilion of Clear Radiance beneath a waterfall and built the Stone Field Mountain Lodge for his repose, which he did after I had composed the inscription. His poetic compositions remain in the mountains. Before Lu Guimeng and Pi Rixiu, there were Meng Dongye and Liu Wenfang of the Tang; in the Song, there were Xie Shihou and others; and in the present dynasty, Huang Wenxian and others. Master Mao intends to carve and transmit these works as well.

According to the *Gazetteer of Kuaiji*, the site is commonly called the White Water Palace, though it is also referred to as the White Water Abbey Stele. Since "palace" (祠宇) and "abbey" (观) are redundant in meaning, it should now be properly termed the White Abbey.

I obtained *Preserving Yue* by the provincial graduate Xu Mianzhi of Panyu, which records the calamities that befell Yue—utter devastation—while the mountains of Siming remained untouched by the winds of war. There, Master Mao wandered freely, savoring his meals and sleeping in peace. Truly, this was the fabled Peach Blossom Spring of old. Thus, I have composed this account to accompany the inscription, and both shall be engraved.

The Master’s courtesy name was Shanqing; Master Xue’s was Maohong. Those who succeeded them in later years were Pan Wenxin, Sheng Yuanpu, and Xu Yonghe.

On the first day of the dingwei month in the third year of the Zhizheng reign (1362), this was recorded by Wei Su, Grand Master for Thorough Counsel, Participant in the Deliberation of Government Affairs, Co-Director of the Imperial Academy, and Commissioner for the Review of Memorials from the Four Quarters, of Linchuan.

**Preface to the Poems of Stone Field Mountain Lodge**

A hundred li south of Yuyao Prefecture lies Siming Mountain, where the Daoist realm of the Cinnabar Mountain and Vermilion Waters Grotto Heaven is said to reside. The Former Han magistrate of Shangyu, Liu Gang, once cultivated and ascended to immortality here. The abbey is called the Abbey of Sacrificial Halls, while the adjacent dwelling is named Stone Field Mountain Lodge—built by Master Mao Yongzhen.

Initially, the thirty-third-generation Celestial Master Zhang Tian Shi of the Vacuous Tranquility lineage transmitted his arts to Wu Zhenren of the Three Flowers Institute at the Supreme Clarity Palace. Ruan inherited this transmission and dwelled upon this mountain. When Emperor Huizong of Song heard of his virtue, he summoned him, but Ruan declined. Instead, the emperor expanded his residence, which became the abbey. Thus, the abbey traces its origins to the Three Flowers Institute, and the Three Flowers Institute, in turn, regarded the abbey as its ancestral hall.

During the reign of our Benevolent Emperor, when the realm was at peace, the two great patriarchs of the Mystical Teachings, Zhang and Wu, served consecutively at court. At the Three Flowers Institute was Master Zhenyi, Zhu Ben, who was renowned among ministers and nobles for his erudition and literary grace. Master Mao became his disciple, and the Master held him in deep affection, while the two patriarchs particularly esteemed him. By imperial decree, he was entrusted with the administration of the Abbey of Sacrificial Halls.

At the time, the abbey had fallen into disrepair. Since Master Mao took charge, all that was ruined has been restored, and all that was dilapidated has been renovated. Nearly forty years have passed, yet his diligence remains unwavering, as if it were but a single day. Such is the order he has brought to this place.

In his leisure hours, he would retreat to his mountain chamber, where he would burn incense and sit in tranquil repose, allowing no external concerns to burden his mind. Surrounding him were towering cliffs and sheer precipices, with cascading springs and waterfalls spraying and intersecting, their force like a suspended river. Below lay jagged rocks, ridges stretching in every direction, fields and furrows of myriad forms—all composed of stone. There grew calamus, *he che* (fleeceflower root), lingzhi mushrooms, and cocklebur, which could be gathered as needed. The crops of rice, millet, and sorghum barely yielded a tenth or a fifth of their potential. Thus, the place was named "Stony Fields."

Xue Jun, styled Yifu, who had also studied under Master Zhenyi, lived in seclusion on White House Mountain. The mountain lay near the Supreme Clarity Abbey, and upon visiting Stony Fields, he delighted in its secluded beauty and was the first to compose a poem about it. Traveling to the capital, he spoke to the literati and officials, saying: "Stony Fields is a place of surpassing beauty, and Master Mao is a man of true worth. I, too, shall grow old there." Thereupon, each composed a poem, and several dozen were collected. They were presented to my uncle, Master Guan, who expounded on the Daoist principle of "knowing the male but keeping to the female." Only those who grasp this transmission can attain emptiness and embrace simplicity, forsaking the splendor of prosperity and luxury to find contentment in solitude and rustic remoteness, thereby preserving their spirit, nurturing their authenticity, and safeguarding their person—thus enriching the Dao. Master Mao is nearly such a man.

In times of peace, people exhaust their energy and wit in pursuit of fertile, expansive lands, erecting grand and magnificent structures—such was the way of the world. Compared to Stony Fields, the difference is as vast as that between heaven and earth. Yet after a decade of war, the once-wealthiest regions of Yangzhou and Henan, which had surpassed all others, were ravaged and stripped bare. Where once lay eastern paths and western lanes now stretched only wild grass and smoke. Where once stood warm halls and heated chambers now lay crumbling walls and shattered foundations. Could one even hope to find a place resembling the mountain chamber of Stony Fields? Herein lies the wisdom of Master Mao. This is how one recognizes those who have truly inherited their master’s teachings.

Respectfully, I have written this preface and, through Master Xue, present it here.

Composed on the first day of the tenth lunar month in the winter of the twenty-first year of the Zhizheng era by Lu Jian of Linchuan.

**Poem by Tang Worthy: "Seeing Off Daoist Master Xiao Returning to Siming Mountain" by Meng Jiao of Dongye**

Leisurely as a solitary crane’s heart,
Vast as the age of a towering pine.
Emerging beyond the myriad things,
He dwells high on Siming’s peak.
A thousand fathoms of sheer, aligned peaks,
A hundred-foot cascade of plunging springs.

**Poems on Siming Mountain**

**"Feeding on Red Snow"**
Red snow serves as my meal,
White clouds as my fields.
In silence, I shun worldly speech,
My numinous traces often tread the heavens.

**"Wandering the Four Windows"**
*By Liu Wenfang (Changqing)*

Siming’s peaks are wondrous rare,
Since ancient times, famed for climbers’ tread.
Azure cliffs stand skyward-pressed,
Overhanging stones like roofs o’erhead.
Latticed windows open wide,
Four vistas clear in light outspread.
The Winnowing Basket spans the southern wilds,
The Dipper hangs above the eaves to north.
Sun and moon dwell east and west,
At dawn and dusk they rise and set.
I come to wander here,
My pride half-wrapped in cloth’s embrace.
White clouds, without fixed intent,
Drift idly with my solitude.
Facing this, I cast off worldly bonds,
Instantly forget both glory and disgrace.
I laugh aloud—the earth is vast,
A fairy breeze stirs jade at my waist.

---

**"Nine Songs"**
*By Lu Luwang (Guimeng)*

**Stone Window**
Where may one see the Stone Window?
A thousand fathoms high, it leans on empty sky.
Gathering mists obscure its jade-green lattice,
Fading glow stirs its patterned tracery.
The mountains seem to array their rounded charms,
The palace nears the square Cauldron’s side.
Only the Three Peaks’ recluses,
From time to time, come here to collate their hidden texts.

**Passing Clouds**
I visit a stretch of cloud,
Where mist runs deep and paths barely part.
The whistling terrace shifts with the sun,
The woodcutter’s axe carries on the wind.
At dawn, my robes are soaked through,
The cold sobers wine’s warmth.
How many times has my longing for home stilled,
Only to glimpse Su Jun in my hair’s reflection.

**Southern Clouds**
South of the clouds lies yet another stream,
Where cinnabar gravel bears no trace of mud.
Herbs are sold by Ba merchants,
Branches teem with Yue crows’ cries.
At night, the moon rises before midnight,
As autumn nears, I ask if the mists deceive.
If I could dwell in these mountain hues,
I’d pluck lingzhi and ferns with my own hands.

**Northern Clouds**
North of the clouds, near Yang Creek,
Dwellings cling to ravines in a chain.
Altars stand beneath the stars,
Pavilions brush the green-tinged heights.
Half the distant peaks are veiled in rain,
Three ancient wells hold lingering smoke.
If a path to Golden Court exists,
It must lead to the Left Spirit’s realm.

**Deer Pavilion**
Beneath the Deer Pavilion’s crags,
I often lead white deer past.
Fine grass invites long slumber,
Fragrant springs beckon deep draughts.
By sound, I find the moonlit dell,
By path, I reach the mist-wreathed vines.
Soon, I’ll drink the golden elixir,
And ride aloft to the Crimson River.

**Fan Pavilion**
When was this ancient pavilion built?
Its master, they say, soared with the sun.
To this day, mountain recluses tell
How he sometimes rides a jade unicorn home.
Milk-like sap drips from tender pines,
Lingzhi platforms rise from subtle stone.
Leaning on the rail, my gaze strains far—
No sign of feathered robes in flight.

**Chanyuan Grotto**
A flying waterfall pours from cloud-roots,
Its murmuring voice eternal.
Like twin flutes blown in harmony,
Or a zither played at sunset’s glow.
It churns dragon-spittle through inverted caves,
Splashes crane’s robes through pines it pierces.
Who will play its moonlit tune?
Surely one who chants the Upper Clarity’s hymns.

**Green Lattice Fruit**
The mountain’s fruit is called Green Lattice,
Growing in ordered ranks around the ridge.
Its outer form rivals green jade’s hardness,
Its inner savor vies with jasper’s bloom.
Woodcutters’ children gather fallen ones,
Tapping the grove to startle roosting crows.
Surely immortal officials guard it,
Offering it now and then to the Celestial City.

**Juhou (Macaque)**
Why is it called Juhou?
First enfeoffed here in Siming’s bounds.
They drink with linked arms,
Never uttering heart-rending cries.
Wild vines trail their slender tassels,
Cold springs grind jade’s purity.
Amid the grove, wandering officials—
Who among them will become a lord?

**"Stone Window’s Skin"**
*By Jiaorizi (Biaomei, courtesy name Xiuru)*

The window opens by the Dao’s own will,
Revealing distant azure cliffs.
Moss weaves patterns like damask,
Clouds drift as if through gauze.
Within the lattice, the moon spills empty light,
At the sill, no rosy glow lingers.
I wonder where it leads—
It must connect to the Jade Maiden’s home.

---

**"Passing Clouds"**
A powdered grotto stretches twenty leagues,
Where recluses tread its heart.
For a moment, deer tracks vanish,
A single step parts human voices.
With my staff, I part the mist’s green,
With my sleeve, I brush the faint glow.
Long have I wandered without circling back—
I fear I’ve entered the Celestial City.

---

**"Southern Clouds"**
South of the clouds, a river flows,
No crows alight before the peaks.
Village gardens bloom with red peonies,
Households draw from white springs.
Children all seem ancient,
Marriages like those of immortals.
Together, they form true official households,
Never taxed on their stone fields.

---

**"Northern Clouds"**
North of the clouds, the day is dim,
I wonder if I’ve turned my back on the Star of Longevity.
Dogs know the scent of herbs,
People trace lingzhi’s form.
Resting in the wild, beneath pine canopies,
Drunk, I write on lotus-leaf stone screens.
If I burn incense and dwell here,
I should gain entry to Golden Court.

---

**"Deer Pavilion"**
Deer grass thrives here,
So I pass through white clouds’ eaves.
I wait long by blossoms for the doe,
Lead dust slowly through bamboo.
For hours, I drink from jade streams,
All day, I savor golden lingzhi.
Living beneath the Stone Window,
I become an immortal unawares.

---

**"Fan Pavilion"**
The master became one of the ranked immortals,
His pavilion alone remains.
Stone grottoes echo with human barks,
Pine winds startle sleeping deer.
The well’s fragrance is the great elixir,
The crane’s call is an empty tale.
I’d buy this place to hide again,
But cloud-capped peaks demand no coin.

---

**"Chanyuan Grotto"**
Water flows from a ten-thousand-fathom source,
All day it cascades in murmuring streams.
It shatters a full moon’s disc,
Melts half the sky’s expanse.
Its sound rouses the valley’s breath,
Its force whirls clouds to drink.
I imagine a late autumn night,
When all the ancient immortals gather by its flow.

---

**"Green Lattice Fruit"**
Mountain winds ripen this wondrous fruit,
Nightly offered to true immortals.
Its taste rivals cloud-fat’s richness,
Its shape like jade brains, round.
Wild cranes gather where it’s plucked,
Half its fall lands in numinous springs.
It must share the Peach Blossom’s lineage,
Blooming without reckoning years.

---

**"Juhou"**
How enviable is Juhou’s realm,
With jade-green cliffs in countless folds.
Mist-wreathed vines serve as seals and sashes,
Honeyed fruits are its domain’s bounty.
The masses send the Monkey Lord to ferry them,
Fruit is commanded to serve the young.
If you, too, do not die,
You should ascend to the Dark Mystery’s school.

---

**"Song of the Waterfall"**
*By Xie Shihou (Jingchu)*

A flying spring leaps green cliffs,
Towering thousands of fathoms high.
It rushes down from the heavens,
Seeming as broad as bolted silk.
A winding ridge parts the verdant woods,
Its roar reaches me first.
Beside it stands a giant stone,
Smooth and hollow, fit for repose.
Vulgar men never come here,
But we have come to savor its sight.
We must wait for autumn’s clarity,
Then climb the vines to draw near.

---

**"Wandering Siming"**
*By Sun Jihe (Yingshi)*

All my life, I’ve cherished distant longings,
Stroking my sword, I wander far.
Now, I cast off the world’s clamor,
My heart conspires with cliffs and ravines.

**Wandering Far and Wide**

I bound my travels to sail the azure sea,
Southward, I marveled at the crimson isles of Danqiu;
Westward, I climbed Min and E, letting forth a long whistle,
Northward, I gazed toward Guan and Long with sorrow.

Kang and Lu pulled at my returning reins,
Wu Gorge coiled my drifting boat.
Sword Pavilion stood most perilous and grand,
Dragon Gate even more wondrous and secluded.
Though my journeys were not yet sated,
I had gathered a glimpse of their finest scenes.

Of late, I lie by Bamboo Lake,
My clear dreams ever lingering in ease.
My homeland is the Four Bright Mountains,
Its name famed across the Nine Provinces.
When I step out, it seems ever before my eyes,
Yet each time I wish to go, my desire goes unfulfilled.
Worldly affairs are truly perverse,
Does the mountain spirit bear me ill will?
The nearer I draw, the more it seems to mock,
In my old age, I reproach myself in vain.
Now, in the height of fragrant spring,
I meet kindred hearts and find good company.
Fortunately, provisions are easily gathered,
And with swift steps, I pursue my longing.

At midnight, the rain’s sound ceases,
By dawn, the clearing skies float bright.
The heavens stretch vast and gleaming,
The wind’s breath gentle and mild.
With a slender staff, I grasp my bamboo sedan,
In rustic garb and light fur.
From afar, I point toward the forest’s edge,
Joyfully listening to the flowing springs.

I test my clogs on Green Mist Ridge,
Rest by White Water’s melancholy shore.
Flying rapids roar with rushing streams,
Strange pines sway with whistling winds.
Alas, ascending Goat’s Brow,
I pant as if feeding a tiger’s head.
I cling to rocks to guard against the year’s end,
Bearing firewood, I sing of the Dao’s circuit.

A hundred turns, yet each glance brings delight,
A thousand leagues stretch before my eyes.
How the peaks and ridges intertwine,
Their veins and sinews entwined.
The Creator’s artistry fuses and shapes,
Divine craftsmanship carves and searches.
A long wind stirs the twilight sea,
Mighty waves toss Yingzhou Isle.
Ministerial turtles emerge, bearing their burdens,
Wandering dragons coil in sinuous paths.
Whales and roc birds frolic and surge,
Fish and insects teem in dense throngs.
A myriad wonders rise and fall,
A thousand sails pass and linger.
Some lie flat as a table,
Others tower like a crown or cap.
Some stand arrayed like swords and halberds,
Others are carved like spears and pikes.
Some dance like phoenixes,
Others gallop like post horses.
Some play like cunning glances,
Others grapple like jade and marble.
Solemnly, they seem to open a grand hall,
Where jade and silk greet the feudal lords.
Majestically, they gather at Qiyang,
A great encirclement in full pursuit.
Fierce battles rage near Changping,
Stalwart defenses hold Honggou’s divide.
The open plains array chariots and cavalry,
The central camp stands firm with drum and song.

The vastness of creation stretches boundless,
Its transformations endure through endless time.
Startled, I gaze but cannot speak,
How could mere form ever compare?
A sacred tree, forty spans in girth,
Its coiled roots aged for thousands of autumns.
Though its old trunk withers, it does not die,
New verdure flourishes in emerald hues.
The wind’s chariot surely comes and goes,
Will the mulberry fields soon prove the tale?
The legends of its traces are well attested,
But how could one lightly ascend to such heights?

Southeastward, I traverse lofty ridges,
On either side, level fields unfold.
Villages scatter dogs and chickens,
Hamlets send forth sheep and cattle.
Officials collect firewood and charcoal,
Spring labors urge hoes to toil.
The soil is rich, with little sand or stone,
The air is cold, and wheat does not sway.
Wild paths flank peach and plum trees,
Dense shade opens to pines and cypress.
Here, one could escape the world—
Why seek further refuge by boat?

Twin cliffs descend in sheer walls,
Separate peaks vie for sunlight.
Who says the two monasteries are not sublime?
How could I turn back midway?
With my staff, I scale perilous heights,
Snowy Abyss still bars the way.
Morning clouds hang thick and still,
Daytime winds whistle and howl.
I cross winding steps over a square bridge,
Vast halls connect to soaring towers.
Pearls and jades interlace with embroidered patterns,
Gold and azure gleam on vermilion eaves.
The bell tolls for a thousand fingers,
The wooden clappers sound with a hundred lamps.
Truly, this is a heavenly abode,
Untouched by mortal cares.

All around, beauty abounds,
I wander and explore to my heart’s content.
Distant peaks echo in resplendent hues,
The brocade mirror’s waves shimmer and flow.
Two streams rush with lively murmurs,
A thousand fathoms cascade in sparkling falls.
Deep cataracts mark their radiant paths,
Hidden pools cradle rainbows.
Looking down, I shudder with vertigo,
Bending to scoop water, its clarity refreshes.
Valley grasses pile high and low,
Rock flowers bloom in wild profusion.
On the cliffs, agile gibbons dart,
Deer call as they feast on lingzhi.
The long day resounds with orioles’ songs,
Misty shadows echo the cuckoo’s cry.
Tall bamboos play the pipes and zither,
Fine streams murmur with jade-like tones.
The magpie’s chatter brings joy,
The turtledove’s call forebodes rain.
Where shall I share my alms bowl?
For now, I offer tea in a simple cup.

The old monk delights in conversation,
A man of renown, he welcomes my visit.
At ease, I lodge in his mountain chamber,
Sleepless, I listen to the night watch’s tally.

I recall when I was ten thousand leagues away,
Now I reach this corner of the heavens.
Ascending, I behold the world’s vastness,
Revering the years’ passage.
Honor and disgrace are but snail horns,
Gatherings and partings like sea gulls.
The dust’s harness binds me,
The arena of fame pits me against rivals.
I heed not the gibbons’ and cranes’ laments,
Yet I shame the springs and stones.
My heart’s desire is at last fulfilled,
While the world’s chariot still outpaces me.
I learn from Zhi and Xu’s refined tastes,
My extraordinary path is not like Ruan’s or Liu’s.
How timely, like the pheasant on the mountain beam,
How joyful, like the minnows in Zhuangzi’s stream.
I briefly follow Xinggong’s rhapsody,
I do not wish to be imprisoned like Liuzi.
Come, my learned friend,
Play for me the *shang* mode’s melody.

---

**Ode to the Ascending Immortal Tree**
*By Liu Fan*

This cicada-shed tree ascends to immortality,
In its prime, it already pierced the heavens.
Its jade-like bones half-withered, yet still lustrous,
Its ancient bark newly grown, ever fresh.
Peaches of immortality ripen every three thousand years,
Bronze guardians polish it for five hundred more.
The crane has not returned, the mountain lies still—
Who lingers to ask of its origins?

---

**Ode to the Green Lingzhi**
*By Shi Xi*

Recalling its recent return from the imperial court,
Unspent joy lingers as the tortoiseshell banquet unfolds.
Drunken, I cast the green spores upon fragrant earth,
Leaving them for the immortals to plant at their leisure.

---

**Visiting Master Hunpu, the Venerable Hao**

In what year did you hide in the Four Bright Mountains,
Cutting all ties with the world?
The sagely lord leaves his seat vacant,
Yet you refuse to enter the city.
Wind and thunder rise from the earth,
Palaces form by heaven’s will.
Gladly, your bamboo sedan rides steady—
Why fear the coming of white hair?

---

**Inscribed While Traveling the Four Bright Mountains: Dan Mountain**
*By Tang Jingshi*

The Four Bright Mountains gleam, chilling the nine skies,
Fairy gardens where immortals daily come and go.
Waterfalls plunge from the Silver River’s distant flow,
Cave gates remain sealed in idle white clouds.
Deep cliffs nurture auspicious trees with golden veins,
Lofty peaks bear sacred fungi with iron-hued spots.
Countless relics lie unrecognized—
Fallen blossoms drift on murmuring streams.

---

**Traveling Dan Mountain**
*By Sun Yuanshi*

The Four Bright Mountains rank ninth among cave heavens,
The mighty spirit cleaved stone to open windows and doors.

Clutching vines and tracing wheel-ruts, undaunted by toil,
I journey with Master Kun, a friend beyond years.
Ancient moss guards the stones where gray tigers repose,
A flying waterfall hangs from cliffs where jade dragons roar.

Suddenly, man and scene alike transcend,
Drunk, we sing and beat jars, heedless of rank.
I know well the heavens within the gourd—
Not all who drink are truly lost in wine.

Wandering beneath the moon, I linger, forgetful of return,
Worldly affairs like floating clouds—what are they after all?

---

**Another Poem**
*By Sun Gengkuan*

With guests, I explore the depths of wonders,
Together we ascend Whitewater Mountain.
Silver waves churn as the moon descends,
Azure cliffs lean against the cold sky.
Gathering herbs, we thread through clouded ravines,
Playing weiqi, we sit upon a stone altar.
Forgetting the late hour of return,
I pluck orchids to fasten at my belt.

---

**Another Poem**
*By Feng Xia Yin*

For ages, the caves of Dan Mountain,
Today, at last, I wander through.
Waterfalls, high and cold, crash like driven snow,
Ancient cliffs, in twilight, seem autumn’s hue.
Tamed tigers follow immortals away,
A lofty hall preserves their lingering forms.
I regret my return too swift—
I’ve yet to seek its hidden depths.

---

**Ode to the Waterfall**
*By Guo Baiyun*

All day I watch, never weary,
My spirit cleansed, my bones feel immortal.
A night’s rain swells its roar,
A hundred cliffs’ springs surge in might.
Turning stones, thunder shakes the ravine,
From sheer cliffs, a sword points to heaven.
Enamored of wonders, I forget my age,
Still longing to climb the perilous peak.

---

**Another Poem**
*By Zhao Danshan*

Jade dragons roar, and mountains part,
Raging torrents surge, churning cliffs.
A whirlwind could become flying rain,
Together we hear ten thousand gorges roar like spring thunder.

---

**Another Poem**
*By Zhao Zhuyi*

The cold spring flies, its first sound like the Zhe River’s tide.
Beneath pines, though rainless, clouds remain moist,
On stone treasures, though clear, snow lingers unmelted.
A white silk banner hangs from sheer cliffs,
A rainbow of a thousand feet spans layered skies.
Dan Mountain is itself an immortal’s abode—
The Weak River’s flow comes not from afar.

---

**Another Poem**
*By Monk Leiyuan Yuanqiu*

My eyes fill with flying bright snow,
On Dan Mountain, a white rainbow appears.
Heaven’s mechanism hangs, never exhausted,
Earth’s axis rolls, boundless.
Rippling, it sinks like cold jade,
Scattered, it drifts on the dawn wind.
If asked where it alights—
It must reach the Dragon Palace.

---

**Inscribed on Dan Mountain, Presented to Recluse Shitian**
*By Huang Jinqing of the Yuan Dynasty*

Beyond Shitian’s history, Dan Mountain dwells,
Such streams and peaks matched with such a man.
Long has lofty verse lacked Pi Rixiu’s touch,
Yet the pure wind returns, as in Xie’s dust-free days.
Before his gate, flying waterfalls ever churn snow,
At his cave’s mouth, delicate flowers briefly hold spring.
Old, I return from the capital to seek seclusion—
When may I hold my zither and daily draw near?

---

**Inscribed on the Waterfall**
*By Liu Dexuan*

The Whitewater Immortal once rode a crane—
In what year did he shed his bones upon this mountain?
Transformed into a jade ribbon, it hangs a thousand feet,
The Silver River overturned, falling from midair.
At dawn, the crane’s dream lingers in the moonlit canopy,
At night, the merfolk tug at the crystal palace.
A visitor from Tiantai finds his poem unfinished,
His thoughts of return bound by jade towers and paired gates.

---

**Another Poem**

From mid-heaven, the waterfall descends upon the jade terrace,
A white silk banner hangs—how strange!
The Weaving Maid casts her loom, unable to gather it,
Chang’e cuts the water, skillfully tailoring its form.
Its light connects twin gates, stirring the starry river,
Its roar carries a thousand mountains’ wind and rain.
Before the shrine and cave, I gaze, unsatisfied—
Again, I follow the bright moon past Tiantai.

---

**Seeing Off Mao Shitian to Reside at Whitewater Palace**
*By Zhang Boyu*

Girding his sword, he dwells on Dan Mountain,
His sleeves like wings, riding the wind.
The empty altar remains desolate,
The flying waterfall cascades in murmurs.
Meager offerings make a poor host,
The mountain’s depths leave no gate closed.
Atop the thousand-fathom peak of Great Orchid,
One day, he shall meet Liu and Fan.

---

**Inscribed on Whitewater Palace**

Two immortals rein in their steeds upon the azure void,
Their ancient fame flows on, their traces yet unclear.
The Whitewater Master transmits the Jia and Yi,
A green lamp keeps me through the Gengshen night.
From cloud-rooted cliffs, the waterfall falls, ever mistaking rain,
At the cave’s mouth, flowers bloom, naturally embracing spring.
Turning back, the human realm is but dust—
Best to bind straw sandals and make Dao my neighbor.

---

**Another Poem**
*By Zhao Junzhang*

Once with woodcutters, I returned from gathering herbs,
From afar, on cinnabar cliffs, white clouds piled.
Through a hundred thousand kalpas, the immortal’s wind endures,
From thirty-six streams, spring waters come.
Jade halls, in their time, permit carefree laughter,
My staff, dampened, ascends towering peaks.
The cave’s gate, deeply sealed, unknown to all—
It must have opened after Liu and Fan’s departure.

---

**Another Poem**
*By Gao Zecheng of the Ming Dynasty*

In the Four Bright Mountains, after spring rain,
Beneath the Three Terraces Peak, I seek an immortal’s abode.
Clouds part, emerald jade floats beside golden palaces,
The wind stills, the Silver River descends from the Jade Void.
At night, the secluded cave glows as cinnabar transforms cranes,
By day, the clear stream rests as otters watch fish.
I entrust you to ask after Liu and Fan’s news—
A blue bird from the west would bear a letter well.

*(Note: The "Liu and Fan" refers to legends of two immortals who once played tricks—Liu spat water to form fish, Fan spat water to form otters.)*

---

**Another Poem**

Dan Mountain’s wonders coil, unmatched under heaven,
Layered streams and towering peaks—few travelers tread.

The millennia-old shrine nears the celestial vault,
A hundred-foot cascading spring sways in the evening glow.
Jade lads play their flutes, their light lingering at the door,
Immortal maidens pay homage to the True—clouds clothe their robes.
I arrive, stay two nights, stirred by clamor and reflection,
When shall this restless world cease its scheming?

---

**Another Poem**
*By Monk Baiyun, self-styled Ziyue*

I hear the Stone Fields delight in wonders,
Beneath the Pavilion of Clear Radiance, I often forget to return.
Are there none with flying pendants who ascend the cinnabar summit?
Yet auspicious clouds at times shield the verdant peaks.
Spring rain graces the peach blossoms with fragrance, soft and lingering,
Autumn winds caress the jade trees, their green leaves swaying gently.
Two years past, I passed the immortal elder’s dwelling,
And saw the white waters flying west of the cliffs.

**To the Historian Mao of the White Water Palace**
*By Song Wuyi of the Yuan Dynasty*

In my lifetime, I’ve never set foot beneath Dan Mountain,
Yet in my hometown, I’ve only heard the name of White Water.
The path into the grotto-heaven spans less than a hundred li,
My journey through the immortal realm fulfills three lifetimes.
Flowers converse with cranes and flutes as spring clouds swirl,
By the water’s edge, pavilions and terraces gleam in the morning sun.
I send word to Historian Mao of the Stone Fields:
Let us meet when the days grow warm to carve yellow essence.

**On the Waterfall**
*By Sun Daoxin, styled Shizhi*

The jade dragon battles, its strength spent and scattered,
Hanging inverted from Dan Mountain, it cannot take flight.
With the fury of thunder and the roar of lightning, it gathers its might,
Bursting forth as silver threads of water across half the sky.
The silver threads stretch far, the waters run dry,
Cold light unmoving, the mountain moon solitary.
The two cliffs part as if the earth’s axis turns,
A ten-thousand-zhang plunge—no fish in the abyss.
In the sixth month, snow flies, untouched by summer’s heat,
It clears my spirit, and I yearn for the immortal’s song.
Liu and Fan ascended together in those bygone years,
Ancient trees pierce the heavens, just as they were then.
Though few are heard of who dwell here now,
There are still those of uncarved simplicity, true men.
The grotto remains open, its cinnabar qi still warm,
Cranes return, speaking of the Peach Blossom Spring.
I entrust you to sing the *Zhaoyin* melody,
At dusk, pillowing on the stream in the mountains.
Come morning, share with me a single ladle’s worth,
To wash away the world’s dust by the myriad *hu*.

---

**Another Poem**
*By Zhu Jingchun, styled Jiong*

My life bears a fondness for mist and rosy clouds,
Leaning on my staff, I gaze at the mountains time and again.
The stone cavern opens, and the cinnabar phoenix departs,
The waterfall flies, transforming into a jade dragon.
Riding the wind, it scatters snow across half the sky,
Without rain, it roars like thunder through ten thousand valleys.
I alone envy Historian Mao of the mountains,
Who in seclusion has truly found a lesser Penglai.

---

**Another Poem**
*By Chen Bangxie, styled Yong*

From whence does the water come?
Flowing forth from the white clouds’ embrace.

**Spraying a thousand feet of snow,**
**Crashing like thunder through ten thousand valleys.**
The Daoist’s bones are pure and clear,
Seated guests grow cold, free of dust.
With a laugh, he descends the mountain,
Hugging his zither, treading home by moonlight.

**Inscribed at the White Water Palace**
The *Hongbao* of the pillow is surely worth transmitting,
Living near the Cinnabar Mountain’s ninth heaven.
Near and far, I often seek beyond clouds and waters,
My name should be carved upon the stone cliffs.
After rain, the waterfall’s roar is heard at night,
The cinnabar furnace stays warm, uncounted by years.
From time to time, a pot of wine, a song,
Let them call me an earth-wandering immortal.

**The Clear Radiance Pavilion**
A frost-edged bowl, thoughts peerless,
The pavilion brims with poetic scenes, free of dust.
Fine mountains face me, unfolding emerald,
Living waters at their source paint white clouds.
An iron flute summons the toad, cold stirs,
A jade sheng calls the crane as night begins.
Inspired, I pace with my long sword,
At times a divine light shoots toward the Dipper’s pattern.

**Inscribed at Cinnabar Mountain**
*By Gao Boyuan, styled Yi*

Cinnabar Mountain, Red Waters—a divine immortal’s abode,
With cloth saddle and green shoes, I make a fine journey.
A hundred-foot flying spring, silver river snow,
A single crane’s cry, autumn in the grotto-heaven.
Green *lingzi* ripen, the cloud altar still,
Jade trees bloom, the stone chamber deep.
Endless streams and peaks hold splendid feasts,
When shall I build my hut among these woods?

**Another Poem**
*By Chen Lǚchang, styled Kelǚ*

Ming’s vastness opens a stone window,
Within stands an immortal’s white jade terrace.
A stream flows far from the heavens,
Three terraces rise high before the grotto.
The old man’s gaunt bones seem a dragon transformed,
Dense bamboo’s cool shade awaits the phoenix’s return.
Each time I seek wonders by Yin River,
Here I find Penglai instead.

**Another Poem**

Clad in iron, riding a steed over green moss,
Suddenly I knock at the immortal’s gate, the stone grotto opens.
The azure sky’s autumn sounds hang as white water,
Purple clouds’ spring hues descend from the cinnabar terrace.
Master Liu long ago rode a simurgh away,
Magistrate Han still comes astride a crane.
Wine cups meet, our pure joy overflows,
New poems sung, we linger again.

**Another Poem**
*By Wang Jingzhong, styled Zhong*

Four windows frame mountains fair enough to grasp,
A stone house clings to cloud roots, towering and bright.
In the woods, a lost crow once turned into a tiger,
In the grotto, a bowing monkey seems almost human.
A rushing torrent plunges thousands of feet,
High steps now span over forty springs.
Divine light nightly illumines the cinnabar chamber,
Surely immortals come and go often here.

**Another Poem**
*By Yuan De, styled Jiyamuding*

Famed mountains of Yue are known to the world,
The four-windowed immortal realm surpasses all.
Half the blue sky falls as the Silver River’s waters,
The white sun lingers past emerald ridges’ clouds.
Beyond dust, phoenix songs call recluses,
In the woods, tigers and crows await the Primordial Lord.
Knowing I never tire of climbing mountains,
You long allow me to seek you, free of worldly taint.

**Another Poem**
*By Lin Xiyuan*

I once heard of Immortal Liu,
Who served as magistrate of Shangyu.
For years he nurtured his spirit’s elixir,
Gathering divine herbs at will.
One day he rode a flying simurgh,
Soaring past towering trees into the blue haze.
Looking down upon the mortal realm,
How many mulberry fields had turned to seas?
Alas, my bones remain unchanged,
How can I embrace such radiance?
His lofty footsteps linger among men,
Deep longings shared across a thousand years.

**Another Poem**
*By Wang Chenliang, styled Wenjing*

Cinnabar Mountain, since ancient times an immortal’s dwelling,
Especially wondrous, set apart from the world.
A hundred-foot hanging spring flies like a serpent,
A thousand-year-old crow transforms into a tiger.
Pavilions still recall the flute’s song,
Lingzhi and trees long sustain grain-avoiding disciples.
I wish to drive a firewood cart to visit true recluses,
But wonder if the mortal dust will allow me.

**Another Poem**
*By Yang Yuanqing, styled Huan*

An immortal soars through the sky on a jade dragon,
Leaving divine traces still in the mountains.
Passing clouds, I pick green *lingzi*,
Seeking the waterfall, I find the White Water Palace.
Warfare not yet stilled on this day,
Suddenly I hear bells and drums, revering the mysterious Dao.
Shedding the world should not be hard,
For I once met a cloud-dwelling herb-gathering elder.

**Another Poem**
*By Ma Yizhi, styled Naixian*

Long dwelling in the city, I recall the grotto-heaven’s name,
On a spring day I ascend, staff and sandals light.
Mountain rain clears, the cliff’s waterfall sings,
Rock flowers fade, the stone window brightens.
A yellow-crowned white-haired man, his heart ancient,
Wild waters and idle clouds, their intent pure.
I would go seek Magistrate Liu,
Wishing to bring my wife and children to learn long life.

**Another Poem**

A distant path leads straight to the White Water Palace,
Peaks stand tall like green lotuses.
A flying stream hangs like a thousand-foot silk,
From the heights, I climb three or four more summits.
Sometimes I hear otters chasing fish,
Only immortals ride cranes in procession.
After ten days wandering these mountains,
I seek *lingzong* north and south of the clouds.

**Another Poem**

The White Water Immortal has gone, never to return,
Purple and green palaces lean against the clouds.
A cliff suspends a waterfall like a silver sash,
Three peaks array like emerald mounds.
Herb-gathering immortal boys follow cranes,
Tame deer with flowers in their mouths come to men.
Now I know this wondrous realm is not of the mortal world,
Let us share pure verses, seated on stone moss.

**Inscribed at Cinnabar Mountain**
*By Yang Bianmei*

The Four Bright Mountains, two hundred eighty green peaks,
Heaven’s four windows, where sun and moon rise and set.
This is the ninth heaven of the thirty-six grotto-heavens,
A separate Cinnabar Mountain, Red Waters, not of men’s world.
I dreamt of Immortal He the Mad Guest,
Who went to visit Cloud-Crest Master,
Climbing the solitary summit’s great orchid.
Below, I saw vast waves like the sun’s chariot wheel,
Rainbow light and mirage shadows swirling, billowing upward.
There was a Peach Blossom Beauty,
Who fed me phoenix marrow and dragon liver,
Making my flesh grow feathers and wings.
On the path, I met Master Mao,
Who laughed, bridging past and present.
A red jade crow fell to earth, turning to stone.
I too have heard of this.
Knives repel tiger tides, the Great Master’s grotto-water,
Gate winds snap ancestral banners,
Bridge stones hold the red jade crow—
Why chase down to the earth’s veins or up to heaven’s ropes?
An iron boat cuts straight through.

The Feather-Weak Water-Fire Sword sought to hew the branches of Fusang,
Yet Master Mao, the Mao Immortal, lived a thousand springs after,
Once drunk on Lushan wine,
Sobered to ride a tiger,
Then entered Zhong Mountain,
Laughing to summon the colored simurgh down,
Beckoning with his hand—stone-field jade the size of a peck measure.

The recluse of Stone Field dwelt on Cinnabar Mountain,
Most able to carry on his ancestor’s steps.
Whenever visitors came, they praised him,
Further confirming his name was no empty fame.

*Kindly bestowed a letter, I reply with verse in place of a note,
At this time, I am eighty-five years of age.*

**Xue Chaoyang, Tingfeng**

Visitors often speak of the grotto-heaven’s wonders,
I too have long cherished the mountains and waters’ clarity.
The Ascension-to-Immortality Tree stands near the ancient stone forest,
The stream for washing herbs runs deep, where wind and rain arise.
The Three-Flower Perfected One once dwelled here,
His distant descendants now hold renown.
If you ask why this old man’s hair remains unwhite,
I can still visit you to inscribe lofty sentiments.

**Poem from the Elderly Uncle, the Great Perfected One, sent to Stone Field in respectful response**

In years past, I saw you off at the extraordinary court,
Parting words unforgotten, even dreams were clear.
I recall the four windows where we long resided,
Borrowing a tiger’s back to inquire of long life.
The cinnabar grove has seen scholars of former dynasties,
White Waters still transmit the names of high antiquity.
If you ascend the Three Terraces’ peak to gaze,
The Old Man Star shines near, revealing your heart.

**Inscribed on Cinnabar Mountain**　　　　　　**Han Yanxin**

Twice has the spring wind reached Penglai,
Washing clean a myriad measures of traveler’s sorrow.
On a rain-soaked couch, I lie listening to the cliff’s waterfall roar,
By the sunlit window, I sit watching white clouds arise.
Grasses by the steps sleep through the years,
Nine-times-refined cinnabar emerges from the fire.
How might I clear the brambles beside Fan’s pavilion,
To ask you for a plot of Stone Field to till?

**Again**　　　　　　　　　**Wang Shuyu, Lin**

Beneath the Three Terraces Peak lies the immortals’ abode,
Fan’s pavilion, where spring winds ever cling to ivy and vine.
Myriad-fold layered peaks join the stone cliffs,
A single curtain of flying rain—a Milky Way of waterfalls.
Heaven’s light above and below, clouds gather and disperse,
Mountain hues misty, rain’s qi abundant.
With guests, I inscribe poems to suffice for pure delight,
Returning, jade pendants chime among the clattering stones.

**Again**　　　　　　　**Liu Tanzhi, Lü**

Towering, the Red Waters Mountain,
Misty, the immortals’ abode.
How lofty were Liu and Fan,
Transcendent, roaming the eight poles.
Once gone, how desolate,
A thousand years leave behind numinous traces.
Within dwells the Cloud-Exterior Man,
Secretly wielding the handle to refine essence and spirit.
In secluded groves, he gathers green lingzhi,
From cold springs, he boils white stones.
Attaining a body of ethereal freshness,
Remote, cut off from the dusty world.
I came and saw it once,
Overwhelmed as if by long-held admiration.
Pine flowers brewed into wine,
He insisted on detaining his guest.

**Again**　　　　　　　　　**Chen Juncong**

By the murmuring cave mouth, I watch the flying waterfall,
Fine rain drizzles, sprinkling the adjoining fence.
The White Waters Perfected One knows well how to host guests,
The Azure Mountain Scholar loves to inscribe poems.
At night, the gibbon howls beneath the Three-Flower Tree,
Wild deer often carry five-colored lingzhi in their mouths.
I ask: after Liu and Fan’s ascent to immortality,
Who has come here to share such intimate moments?

**Again**　　　　　　　　　**Xie Yuangong, Su**

North and south of the clouds, oil-fruit platters,
Immortals’ palaces overlook Zan and Ruan.
Sunlit peaks cast inverted reflections, half the sky emerald,
Snowy waterfalls scatter blossoms, chilling the sixth month.
In vain, the simurgh’s departure leaves an empty abode,
Yet tigers still come to guard the immortal altar.
Before the grotto, peach trees endure through spring,
Awaiting my return to inquire of the Great Elixir.

**Again**　　　　　　　　　**Qi Wen, Angji**

Of old, immortals departed from Great Orchid Mountain,
Leaving behind empty terraces and halls within stone cliffs.
Cliff waterfalls fly white snow through all four seasons,
Stream clouds shield the Dark Pass through long days.
Green lingzhi’s dew is cold, gathered from the creeping vine,
Immortals’ trees stir with wind as tigers return.
Last night, fresh rain passed before the grotto,
The host detained his guest to listen to the murmuring stream.

**Again**　　　　　　　　　**Han Zhijing, Ji**

I long to seek the cinnabar sediment of Red Waters,
For this is the land of jade hairpins and bamboo shoots.
Peaks form emerald screens, dividing the doors’ reflections,
Waters weave silk ribbons, coiling along the stream.
Riding clouds and harnessing qi, I face the scorching equator,
Admiring the moon and chanting to the wind, I envy the late Tang.
If you ask why this old man’s hair remains unblack,
I can still visit to inscribe lofty sentiments.

**Again**　　　　　　　　**Monk Daming, Lengyu**

A man paces the stone altar with Yu’s steps,
Voiding his song to the jade pendants’ chime.

**Again**　　　　　　　　**Zhao Dechun, Yisheng**

Where to gaze on white waters and cinnabar peaks?
Atop the Clear Radiance Pavilion, I lean on the railing.
Midair, layered verdure nears the triple confluence,
A thousand-zhang cascade chills the fifth month.
Immortal maidens play flutes at the grotto’s mouth,
Mountain recluses pluck herbs beyond the clouds.
I, too, am a crane of Difficult Peak—
Coming and going, never to return.

**Again**　　　　　　　　**Chen Zishan, Zurén**

The Four Bright Mountains hold a divine one,
Who dwells apart on a lofty summit.
Soaring flight inverts the sun’s shadow,
His remnant dust bears wondrous traces.
His flowing influence spreads through the Three Flowers,
And scholars revive his lineage.
He slashes thatch to build beneath the peak,
Remote as if riding the wild swan’s path.
Jade-like plants flourish through the seasons,
Spirit springs flow left and right.
At dawn he greets the Royal Father,
At dusk he summons the Azure Lad.
These two acres of fields,
Through bitter toil, sustain the year’s labor.
South and east, endless furrows,
The plow’s traces coil within the bounds.
Since ancient times, immortals and sages have dwelt here,
Their diet and practice unlike the world’s.
White stalks harder than jade,
Boiled and offered at morning rites.
Not for lack of plow or hoe,
Yet his bamboo basket and gourd bowl never fill.
Great thieves cast covetous eyes and depart,
Heaven’s calamities leave no want.
Once, the empty mat was contested,
The dry rice’s fault lay in himself.
How could he know the land of no hunger?
The bundled herbs dispelled ignorance early.

**Master Mao’s Stone-Field Mountain Lodge**　　　**Zhang Zhongju, Inscription**

The plow first breaks a hundred acres of waste,
At the foot of Four Bright Mountain, a mountain lodge is built.
Planted, the jade grains gleam in pairs,
Split from the cloud-root, each piece square.
Within the grotto, immortals drink only marrow,
At the ridge’s end, no guest seeks the lost sheep.
I know the master, his daily recitation of the *Yellow Court* complete,
Embraces the flying spring to rinse his fragrant teeth.

**Again**　　　　　　　　**Liu Ruyuan, Ruochong**

He hews stone to sow fields of jasper,
Opens the mountain to frame a cinnabar chamber.
High dwelling neighbors the wild cranes,
The dusty world is lighter than chaff.
Is there no sesame rice?
There is also a fasting formula.
Looking back at the starving masses,
His heart aches with sorrow.
Shouldering his hoe, he emerges from Four Bright Mountain,
The Red Waters flow in torrents.
Spirit sprouts bloom in triple clusters,
Fine jades stand in twin rows.
A grain of millet holds the vast realm,
A millet-pearl hangs in the azure vault.
Rapt, he dreams a dream of ripeness,
Awakens startled by the yellow millet.
He leaps into the Northern Dipper,
Sips the golden liquid’s nectar.
One draught outlasts ten thousand kalpas,
Treading the rainbow, he roams beside the Emperor.
Returning, he plays with inverted light,
Self and things both forgotten.
Pine winds pass through the empty chamber,
Within, purity cradles pure yang.
Moss-moon hangs on the sheer cliff,
The waterfall scatters silver on the bed.
Within the gourd, visions flicker and fade,
By the river, he soars and circles.
Clouds and rocks churn the spring rapids,
In stillness, a thousand days’ provisions rest.
His youthful face retains crimson radiance,
His hairpin gleams with dark light.
He paces the void in the Petal Pearl Palace,
Leaving echoes like chiming jade.
Silent, he transcends all forms,
Seals his senses, burns pure incense.
Jade plants rise dense and tall,
Magic herbs spread their fragrance.
He moves the Purple River Chariot,
Commands the Golden Flower Ram.
Wishing to gather the elixir of long life,
To present it to the Radiant King.

**Visiting the White Water Palace**　　　　**Hua Boren, Longevity**

The White Water Immortal Palace is rarely met,
In ten years, twice I follow old traces.
Cold currents gleam like a jade woman’s silk,
Clear peaks stand sharp as golden lotuses.
By the stream, no fish—only heaped stones,
The path to gather herbs wreathed in drifting clouds.
Tomorrow I’ll bring my nine-jointed staff,
To climb again those Three Terraces Peaks.

The Daoist dwells in White Water Grotto,
Fields at its mouth yield to hoe and plow.
No toil in plowing—labor grows light,
Jade and stone refine themselves through fire.
Gathering firewood by the stream, guests share the boil,
On Transformed Ram Ridge, immortals all ascend.
Deep in night, moon arrives without shoulders to bear,
Seated, one hears the flute and crane of the nine heavens.

**Chen Zexu: "This and That"**

A hut built at the mountain’s root becomes a dwelling,
No need for barbaric rites to await the year’s exorcism.
Planting jade—is there no uncut jade of He?
Refining cinnabar—there is also Yu’s surplus grain.
He knows his life is borne by clouds and waters,
Who recognizes the long delight of forests and springs?
I too wish to return and seek my old calling,
My dreaming soul ever circles Jin Brook’s side.

**Zhao Xingwu: "Thinking of Lu"**

Carving a half-wall ladder through emerald screens,
A thousand cliffs echo—this is the azure void.
No need to borrow Qin’s labor to halt the bridle,
Nor was this opened by the spirit of the Shu emperor.
The immortal’s bowl gathers grain finer than millet,
Spring’s richness sows jade to prolong life.
Returning, clogs slip on mossy green,
Thatched hut and pine-lichen frame the blue shoulders.

**Xue Yifu**

A few acres nestled by the mountain, one plot of land,
Glad to keep the humble bowl over rich fare.
Lately, fasting with yellow stone in mind,
Yet still tending the hearth to plant white elm.
Jade qi moistens the mountain woods to lushness,
Pine clouds drift away, the crane’s nest stands alone.
Soon I’ll cast off my clogs to follow the master,
Begging for pearls from the green lattice.

**Zhang Xiannan: "Fu" (To Xue, the Crane Studio Immortal, whom I have yet to meet but admire—first sending this poem)**

Two autumns since parting from the emperor’s court,
Well you dwell secure in the cinnabar mounds.
No need for the Azure Flower staff to compile scriptures,
Riding a crane, you ascend the White Jade Tower.
I envy your transmission of Tang’s Lesser Guardian,
I shame to have lost the legacy of Han’s Marquis of Liu.
Before your gate, White Water stretches three thousand feet—
Should it become the Yellow River’s endless flow?

**Wu Juzheng: "Duanxue" (Visiting White Water Palace)**

From youth I wearied of the vulgar world,
Seeking distant wonders with all my heart.
Thus I wandered beyond the dust,
Joining the staff beneath the forest’s shade.
Fish weirs cross the stream,
Bird paths rise through green clouds.
Having glimpsed the immortal’s true abode,
My thoughts of rosy clouds grow deeper still.
How many peaks encircle the mountain?
Flying cascades plunge a thousand feet.
Heavenly spirits dance beside the eaves,
Water music resounds by the steps.
The traces of Pi and Lu are long past,
The affairs of Liu and Fan have faded too.
Without those who inherit the ancient will,
Who could grasp this pure delight?
Former worthies left their verses,
Carved on cliffs, they seem like Buddha’s likeness.
