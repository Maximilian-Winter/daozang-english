**Records of the Veneration of the Dao Through the Ages**

King Mu of Zhou venerated the Queen Mother of the West at Kunlun Mountain, Wangwu Mountain, Mount Song, Mount Hua, Mount Tai, Mount Heng, Mount Heng (in Shanxi), Zhongnan Mountain, Mount Kuaiji, Mount Qingcheng, Mount Tiantai, Mount Luofu, and Mount Kongtong, ordaining over five thousand Daoist priests in total.

Emperor Shi Huang of Qin, having unified the Six Kingdoms, summoned masters of esoteric arts and favored the techniques of longevity. He dispatched envoys to Penglai to seek the elixir of immortality, constructed over one hundred palaces and temples, and ordained more than seventeen hundred Daoist priests.

Emperor Wen of Han and Empress Dowager Dou both favored the teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi. They built seventy-two palaces and temples, decreeing that those who did not master the scriptures of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi could not hold official positions. The emperor personally visited the River Earl to inquire into the essentials of the *Dao* and *virtue*, bringing great order to the realm. In total, over one thousand Daoist priests were ordained.

Emperor Wu of Han venerated the Dao with even greater devotion. Moved by his sincerity, the Queen Mother descended into his palace and bestowed upon him five silver statues, declaring them to be the true forms of the Most High Lord Lao. The emperor had three separate halls constructed to enshrine them. Later, the statues were moved to the Bailiang Terrace, and subsequently to the Gansui Palace, where they were arranged in a single hall, facing south—a practice that began from this time. He also ordained several princesses and approximately five thousand Daoist priests, constructing over three hundred temples. Among these, the Wansui Temple on Mount Song, the Dengfeng Temple on Mount Tai, the Jixian Temple on Mount Hua, the Wangling Temple on Zhongnan Mountain, and the Tongtian Temple on Wangwu Mountain were forbidden to commoners, serving as models of reverence. The Wansui Temple originated when the emperor, during an imperial progress, heard the mountain’s acclamation and converted his temporary palace into a temple.

During the reign of Emperor Xuan of Han, Li Tan, a clerk of Shangdang Commandery, entered Baodu Mountain to gather herbs. In a stone chamber, he discovered over forty volumes of celestial scriptures, along with a jade box and jade staff, which he presented to Zhang Chun, the governor of Hedong Commandery. Zhang promptly dispatched envoys to submit them to the emperor. Upon viewing them, the emperor was so astonished that he wept, ordering their display to all court officials. At the time, Ran Kui, the Chief Clerk of the Palace Secretariat, wept upon seeing them and said, “These are the posthumous instructions Emperor Wu left to be buried with him in his coffin. How have they come to this?” Upon examining the scrolls, the names of officials who had collated them were found, some of whom were still alive. The emperor then sent envoys to inspect Maoling, where all was found intact as before. He subsequently built two temples for Emperor Wu—one within Chang’an and another below Maoling—to honor his predecessor. He also ordained twenty Daoist priests to tend the incense and lamps.

During the Red Eyebrows Rebellion, Maoling was raided by rebels. Within the emperor’s coffin, only a single sword was found. As they attempted to take it, the sword suddenly roared and soared into the sky.

After Emperor Guangwu of the Later Han pacified Wang Mang and stabilized the realm, he performed the Feng and Shan sacrifices to the east. He then established temples to offer sacrifices for the eleven emperors of his dynasty, as well as at Nanyang, Chongling, famous mountains, great rivers, Chang’an, and Luoyang, constructing a total of one hundred and twenty temples and ordaining one thousand eight hundred Daoist priests.

Emperor Ming of Wei built thirteen temples in the five capitals to honor Emperor Wu and his late empress dowager, ordaining one hundred and nine Daoist priests. He also decreed that Daoist scriptures be adorned in the same manner as imperial edicts.

Sun Quan, the ruler of Wu, built the Tongbai Temple on Mount Tiantai and appointed Ge Xuan to reside there. At Fuchun, he constructed the Chongfu Temple to honor his parents. In Jianye, he built the Xingguo Temple, and on Mount Mao, the Jingyang Temple. In total, he built thirty-nine temples and ordained eight hundred Daoist priests.

Emperor Wu of Jin constructed the Tongtian, Dongtian, Lingxian, and Lingbao Temples in Luoyang, along with two hundred temples across various commanderies. Toward the end of the Wei dynasty, in Lin Tao Commandery of Longyou, a divine being over three *zhang* tall, clad in white robes, with flowing silver hair and a golden crown, appeared in Xiangwu County. He addressed the county resident Wang Shi, saying, “Soon, you shall witness the advent of great peace.” When Emperor Wu received the Mandate of Heaven and unified the realm, the prophecy was fulfilled. The emperor then ordered the construction of the Gaoping Temple at the site of the apparition, which was the former residence of the Li clan. He ordained seven Daoist priests, bringing the total number of ordained priests to four hundred and seventy-two.

At the time, the bank of Linping Lake in Wu Commandery collapsed, revealing a stone drum. It was sent to the emperor, who asked the Minister of Works, Zhang Hua, its purpose. Zhang replied, “Carve a whale from paulownia wood and strike it—it will resonate for miles.” During the reign of Emperor Hui, the drum suddenly sounded in the palace at night without cease. Disturbed, the emperor sent it to the Wansui Temple on Mount Song, where it was struck to assemble the masses—a practice that began from this time.

Emperor Daowu of Northern Wei built fifty temples in Yunzhong, Taiyuan, and the regions north of the Yellow River, ordaining over six hundred Daoist priests. Emperor Taiwu decreed the construction of two hundred and seventy-five Taiping Temples across the realm, ordaining eleven thousand three hundred Daoist priests. He received the talismans and changed the era name to Taiping Zhenjun, further commanding that all memorials from within and without the empire address him as “August Emperor Taiping Zhenjun.” Subsequent emperors all received the registers of ordination.

Emperor Wu of Northern Zhou built the Tongxuan Abbey in Chang’an to welcome Daoist adepts.

Emperor Wen of Sui, having relocated the capital to Longshou Plain and named it Daxing City, built thirty-six temples within the capital and its environs, naming them Xuantan, and ordained two thousand Daoist priests.

Emperor Yang of Sui moved the capital to Luoyang and built twenty-four temples within the city and its environs, ordaining one thousand one hundred Daoist priests.

The August Founder of the Imperial Dynasty, the Divine Yao, the Great Sage, the Great Illustrious Filial Emperor, in the thirteenth year of the Daye era of the Sui, was moved by the spirit of Mount Huo, who declared by the command of the Most High Lord Lao: "You, Tang Gong, shall surely come to possess the realm." In the first year of the Wude era, on Sheep’s Horn Mountain in Fushan County of Jinzhou, a figure clad in white robes, wearing a golden crown, and riding a white horse with a red mane appeared. This was Ji Shanxing, who conveyed the message of the Most High to the Divine Yao: "Now that you have attained sagely governance, you must establish an Anhua Abbey in the eastern part of Chang’an to enshrine the Daoist images. Thus shall the altars of state endure, and the realm be greatly pacified." Shanxing asked, "By what token shall I appear before the Son of Heaven?" The Most High replied, "Go forth, and one who presents a stone tortoise shall serve as your sign." Shanxing then informed He Junxiaoyi, the prefect of Jinzhou, who brought him before the Prince of Qin. There, he recounted the divine manifestation in full. The assembled officials bowed in celebration, and the Prince of Qin dispatched Du Ang, commander of the Left Imperial Guards, along with Shanxing to the site of the apparition to perform sacrifices. The Most High appeared again, just as Shanxing had described. Pointing his whip at Ang, he asked, "Who are you?" Ang replied, "I am the Prince of Qin’s emissary." The Most High said, "I neither drink nor eat—why offer sacrifices? All matters shall be made known to men." Ang returned and reported the divine manifestation. The Prince of Qin rejoiced greatly and ordered Ang to escort Shanxing to the capital to memorialize the throne. Upon their arrival in the capital, before the matter was settled, Zhang Da, the administrator of Qizhou, presented a stone tortoise inscribed with the words: "The realm at peace, descendants flourishing, for ten thousand years, for ten thousand generations." The memorial was presented in audience, and the High Ancestor rejoiced greatly. He issued an edict appointing Shanxing as Gentleman for Court Discussion and bestowed upon him one hundred bolts of silk. He then commanded the Gentleman for Communications, Liu Xian, to establish a temple on Sheep’s Horn Mountain, renamed Fushan County as Shenshan County, and Sheep’s Horn Mountain as Dragon’s Horn Mountain. The Most High appeared once more to Shanxing, asking, "Is the Son of Heaven pleased?" Shanxing replied, "Greatly pleased."

The Most High asked again, "What doubts linger in your mind?" Shanxing replied, "Only that I do not know the sage’s name." The Most High said, "I am the Supreme Divine Immortal, surnamed Li, styled Lord Lao—it is I. I am the ancestor of the Emperor. The *Records of the Grand Historian* contains my biography, and at the original temple in Guyang County of Bozhou, a withered juniper revived as proof. I have already commanded the Duke of Zhou, Dan, to lead divine troops in aid of the state to strike down Liu Heichang. By the fourth-month festival, he shall be crushed."

Filial Piety again ordered Shanxing to present this in audience. The High Ancestor then urgently dispatched Shanxing by post-horse to the Luoyang military headquarters to proclaim and announce the divine decree. When the time came, Liu Heichang was indeed pacified, the Four Seas were wholly settled, and the withered juniper flourished anew. The temple was then renamed the Qingtang Abbey. To this day, within the abbey stand the stele inscribed by Emperor Minghuang and the true visages of successive sages.

In the third year of Wude, an edict appointed Wang Yuanzhi, a Daoist of Jinyang, as Gentleman for Court Discussion and bestowed upon him a gold-threaded coronet and a purple silk cloud-patterned robe, in recognition of his prophecy of the High Ancestor’s mandate. Taizong later promoted Yuanzhi to Grand Master for Splendid Happiness with Silver and Blue, again in acknowledgment of his prophetic words. The granting of purple robes to Daoist priests began from this time.

In the second year of Longshuo under Gaozong, an imperial decree ordered Xu Lishi, the Duke of Qiao and Chief Administrator of Luozhou, to build the Upper Clarity Palace on Yushan to suppress the grotto of demonic immortals. Excavations uncovered an ancient stone tablet, the former foundation of the immortal Bo Zhongli. Upon completion of the work, the Emperor commanded a grand jiao offering, and the Most High appeared once more. The hundred officials presented memorials of congratulation, and the Emperor rejoiced greatly.

In the early years of Qianfeng, after the Emperor completed the feng sacrifice, he returned to Bozhou on his imperial progress and personally paid homage to the Most High. He reverently bestowed the august title of *Hunyuan Emperor* upon the Most High and *Primordial Celestial Empress* upon the Sacred Mother. He also renamed Guyang County as Zhenyuan County. Furthermore, he had the *Eastern Brightness Abbey* constructed in the capital for Taizong and Empress Wende. He decreed that Daoist priests should be registered under the Court of the Imperial Clan, their rank placed immediately after that of the imperial princes.

In the first year of Wenming, Empress Wu sought to ennoble the Wu clan. The Most High then manifested at Huangtianyuan in Fangxing Village, Longtai Township, Quexiang County of Haozhou. He dispatched Hao Xuanchong to convey this message to the Empress: "The imperial house shall enjoy eternal prosperity and great peace; it is not fitting to overstep one’s bounds." The Empress thereupon desisted and converted the Quexiang temporary palace into the *Abbey of Venerating the Immortals*. Later, Qing Mountain emerged in the territory of Xinfeng County, rising three hundred feet high. Above it, five-colored clouds of qi gathered, while below lay a divine pool spanning several hundred acres, wherein white cranes, simurghs, and phoenixes dwelled. On all sides appeared qilin and lions. The Empress ordered the establishment of Qingshan County. All these auspicious omens were recorded in the *Veritable Records of Empress Wu*, signifying the resurgence of the earthly virtue of the imperial house.

She also converted the *Abbey of Heaven-Veneration* on Central Peak into the *Abbey of Mount Song’s Radiance* to offer prayers for the late Emperor Gaozong. Eventually, she abdicated the throne in favor of Emperor Zhongzong, the *Reverent and Harmonious Emperor*.

In the first year of Jinglong, an edict commanded that every prefecture and commandery in the empire establish a *Jinglong Abbey*. In the second year, it was renamed the *Abbey of Revival*. In the third year, it was again renamed the *Abbey of Dragon Ascendancy*. The ordination of Daoist priests followed the precedents of former dynasties.

Emperor Ruizong converted his residence in the Eastern Capital into the *Abbey of Auspicious Clouds* and his residence in Taiyuan into the *Abbey of Tang’s Ascendancy* to offer prayers for the late Celestial Emperor and Celestial Empress.

During the Kaiyuan era of Emperor Ming, an edict ordered that every circuit establish a *Kaiyuan Abbey*. He also composed the *Eulogy of the Hunyuan*, which he personally inscribed on stone. Furthermore, he decreed the establishment of *True Lord Temples* on the Five Peaks. He also ordered the construction of the *Supreme Clarity Palace* in the Upper Capital and the *Supreme Subtlety Palace* in the Eastern Capital. The former residence of the Divine Martial Emperor in Taiyuan was converted into the *Purple Tenuity Palace*, and the former residence of the Hidden Dragon in Qizhou was made the *Abbey of Initiating Sagacity*. All were furnished with imperial robes, crimson gauze, curtains, and crossed-dragon halberds, following the regulations of the imperial palaces.

The Emperor also annotated the *Daoist Classic of the Dao and Its Power* and composed a preface and introduction. He decreed that all scholars and commoners throughout the empire keep a copy in their homes. The Daoist communities of the Two Streets then paraded with banners, parasols, and musical performances, escorting the text from the palace to the *Supreme Clarity Palace*. The profusion of incense and flowers was unmatched in recent memory. He further decreed the establishment of the *Daoist Examination*, modeled after the system of the Ministry of Rites. The Emperor personally presided over the examination, and many candidates passed with distinction.

Later, the Prefecture of Puzhou reported that during renovations of the Purple Ultimate Palace, workers unearthed a jade stone shaped like a crescent moon. It bore the likeness of an immortal grinding medicine with a pestle, and when struck, emitted a sound both clear and distant. The Emperor ordered it hung in the courtyard of the Primordial Lord Temple in Taiyuan, naming it the *Recumbent Moon Chime*. The East Capital’s military governor, Zhang Qi, reported that during repairs to the Ancient Immortal Abode in Ruzhou’s Lushan County, a jade chime was discovered, its sound carrying for miles. The Emperor commanded it be hung in the courtyard of the Sacred Ancestor Temple at the Supreme Clarity Palace. In Quzhou, while constructing an abbey, workers digging the earth uncovered a fish’s head, three feet long, resembling iron yet faintly shimmering with purple and azure hues, as if embedded in blue-green stone with a lustrous sheen—its carving seemingly beyond human craft. When struck, it resounded deeply. No one could name the fish. The object was presented to court, where the Emperor displayed it to his officials, yet none could identify it. The Emperor thus called it the *Auspicious Fish* and ordered it hung in the Grand Ultimate Palace, decreeing it be struck only during scripture lectures or vegetarian feasts. Thereafter, Daoist abbeys competed to replicate it in wood or stone to summon assemblies.

The Emperor further instructed that all abbeys be overseen by chief ministers and regional military governors as a permanent regulation. He also composed the *Rainbow Skirt and Feathered Robe Melody* and the *Purple Ultimate Eight Trigrams Dance*, offering them at the Supreme Clarity Palace with greater reverence than at the Nine Temples. During his eastern imperial progress, he obtained three-ribbed thatch from the Jianghuai region and ordered the construction of the *Divine Thatch Abbey* at the site of its discovery. After completing the rites, he returned to pay homage to the Sacred Ancestor at the original abbey in Bozhou, personally inscribing the *Classic of the Dao and Its Power* on stone. He erected a grand banner and an octagonal tower, covering them before the Void Origin Hall. He also visited the Kaiyuan Abbey in Huaizhou and the Offering Immortal Abbey in Quexiang at the request of nobles and commoners, personally inscribing scriptures on towering stone steles, mirroring the design at the Supreme Clarity Palace.

He then decreed the appointment of Hao Xuanchong as prefect of Haozhou. In the summer of the seventeenth year of the Kaiyuan era, on the fifth day of the fourth month, Zhang Jingzhong, Chief Administrator of the Yi Prefecture Grand Protectorate, reported that the Great Sacred Ancestor, the Primordial August Emperor, had manifested in the Xinxin Convent of Xinjin County, Shu Prefecture, where the wooden grain of a pillar in the Buddha Hall naturally formed the image of the Most High Lord Lao. Atop the image was a floral canopy, and beneath it, thirteen instances of cloud leaves and celestial blossoms appeared before and behind his feet. The report was verified by Vice-Administrator Wang Dazhong, Prefect Li Zhongxun, Deputy Governor Lu Fang, County Magistrate Li Shao, and 130 Daoists, monks, and nuns before being submitted. On the twenty-fourth day of the fifth month, the Emperor dispatched the eunuch Lin Zhaoyin to convey the pillar to the capital, where it was enshrined in the Great Harmony Hall. He further ordered all abbeys of the Two Streets to hold seven days of offerings before returning the pillar to the imperial palace, where it remains to this day.

The auspicious omens were too numerous to record in full. On the seventh day of the first month in the twenty-ninth year, Field Marshal Tian Tongxiu of the Prince of Chen’s residence suddenly beheld purple clouds rising from the northwest watchtower outside Vermilion Phoenix Gate. He then saw the Primordial One riding a white horse, attended by two youths. The youths addressed Tongxiu, saying: “When Master Yin Xi and I entered the Flowing Sands long ago, we concealed a casket of sacred talismans in the old residence of Yin Xi at Peach Grove’s former Pass. You must petition the Emperor to retrieve them.” Tongxiu reported the matter in full.

The Emperor dispatched the eunuch Li Zhizhong to supervise Tongxiu’s journey to the ruins of the former Hangu Pass, twelve *li* south of Taolin County in Shanzhou. Suddenly, purple clouds and a white hare appeared beneath a withered mulberry tree. They dug there until they reached the water’s edge, where they uncovered a stone casket containing a golden coffer and jade tablets inscribed in vermilion seal script. The Emperor, upon receiving the report, rejoiced greatly. He ordered the capital’s ten musical ensembles to perform, with singing, dancing, and wind instruments, as the talismanic script was carried in a treasure palanquin through Tonghua Gate. Five-colored light radiated from it, illuminating heaven and earth. The Emperor, clad in dragon robes and holding a golden censer, stood atop Vermilion Phoenix Tower, while the ladies of the six palaces competed to burn incense and scatter flowers, bowing from afar. He further commanded that gold coins be scattered below the tower for the common people to gather in celebration. In an instant, the cheers of the multitude shook the capital.

The Emperor ordered the sacred talisman enshrined in Lingchang Hall. That night, divine lamps appeared upon the towers, pavilions, and trees. On the first day of the first month, the thirty-first year of Kaiyuan was renamed the first year of Tianbao, and Taolin County was renamed Lingbao County. Three years later, the Emperor noticed the characters “Tianbao, a thousand years” on the talisman. As “Tianbao” had already been adopted as the reign title, he changed the year-count to *zai* (载). At the site of the discovery, he established Changle Pavilion as Tianbao Abbey, personally composing and inscribing the *Stele of the Sacred Talisman* at the place of its retrieval. He also erected Lingfu Hall within the palace and appointed Tongxiu to a fifth-rank regular post. The chief ministers requested the addition of the honorific title “Divine Martialty of Kaiyuan and Tianbao,” which the Emperor approved. A general amnesty was declared throughout the realm.

In the intercalary fourth month of that year, the Emperor dreamed that the Primordial One said to him: “I have long resided in the southwest of the city. I shall meet you at Xingqing Palace—make haste to welcome me.” The Emperor told his chief ministers Li Linfu and Niu Xianke: “In my thirty years of ruling the realm, I have never failed to rise before dawn, don my court robes, and pay reverence to the true image, praying for the welfare of all beings. Recently, in a brief slumber, I saw the Primordial One, who spoke of this matter.” He then dispatched eunuchs and the Daoist master of ceremonies Xiao Xuanyu to search the southwest of the city for several days. Suddenly, in a valley of Louguan Mountain, they beheld purple clouds and a white radiance connecting heaven and earth. They dug at the site and indeed recovered a jade statue of Lord Lao, over three *chi* in height, which they presented to the Emperor.

That day, the Emperor personally welcomed the statue at Datong Hall in Xingqing Palace, fulfilling the prophecy of the dream. He enshrined it in the inner palace for veneration and ordered its likeness copied and distributed to all abbeys throughout the realm. A general amnesty was again declared. In the fifth year, the Emperor dreamed that the Primordial One said: “I possess a numinous talisman, which shall soon appear of its own accord.” Soon after, a sacred talisman and jade register were recovered from Mount Taibai. Upon its arrival in the capital, it was enshrined in Lingfu Hall, where the Emperor personally venerated it. He enfeoffed the mountain spirit of Mount Taibai as Duke of Numinous Response, renamed the cave of its discovery Auspicious Grotto, and established Zhenfu County at the mountain’s foot. He further ordered the establishment of Zhenfu Abbeys in all circuits and had the events recorded in the official histories.

In the twelfth month of that year, the Emperor visited Huaqing Palace. On the fourth day of the month, before sunrise, he suddenly saw strange clouds gathering atop Mount Li. In an instant, the clouds dispersed, revealing the Primordial Sage Ancestor upon Chaoyuan Pavilion. The Emperor and his attendants gazed upon him for a long while before he vanished. By edict, Huichang County was renamed Zhaoying County, and Xinfeng County was incorporated into Zhaoying. Mount Huichang was renamed Mount Zhaoying, its spirit enfeoffed as Duke of Mysterious Virtue, and Chaoyuan Pavilion renamed Descending Sage Pavilion. An illustrated account was issued throughout the realm and entrusted to the official historians.

In the eighth year, the Emperor recovered twenty-seven jade statues of immortals in Luochuan County, Ningzhou. He ordered their conveyance to the capital, following the same ceremonial protocols as the initial welcoming of the Lingbao talisman. The Emperor personally composed a eulogy, and Luochuan County was renamed Zhenning County. At the site of the discovery, Tongsheng Abbey was established. The Emperor composed an inscription for the stele, which still stands today.

In the sixth month of that year, a single stalk of jade fungus emerged in the Great Hall of Unity. The Emperor then established the Gold Immortal Abbey and Jade Fungus Abbey, and two princesses were ordained as Daoist priestesses. Furthermore, Li Hun, a recluse of Mount Taibai, reported an apparition of the Primordial One, who revealed that within the Golden Star Grotto lay a jade tablet inscribed with auspicious signs of the Sagely Emperor’s fortune and longevity. The Emperor dispatched Palace Censor Wang Pi to investigate. After traversing over four hundred li through valleys, he obtained the tablet. The extraordinary omen was proclaimed throughout the realm, and the site was consecrated as the Abbey of Numinous Signs.

On the bingyin day of the intercalary sixth month, the Emperor visited the Supreme Clarity Palace, bestowed honorific titles upon the Five Sacred Ones, and had statues of Confucius’s four disciples installed to stand in attendance before the Primordial One. He also decreed that grand prefectures in the ten circuits establish Jade Fungus Abbeys and issued a general amnesty for the empire.

In the ninth year, Wang Xuan-yi, another recluse of Mount Taibai, reported that the Primordial August Emperor had manifested, declaring that within the Grotto of Treasure Immortals lay a wondrous treasure—a true talisman—commanding the Emperor to retrieve it. The Emperor dispatched Minister of Justice Zhang Jun and Minister of Works Wang Chui to fetch it, and they succeeded. The site was then consecrated as the Abbey of True Numinosity.

In the first month of the thirteenth year, the Emperor again visited the Supreme Clarity Palace, where he elevated the honorific title of the Primordial One to *Great Sagely Ancestor, Most High and Supreme Dao, Golden Portal, Primordial Heavenly August Emperor*. Each of the Five Sacred Ones received additional honorifics, while the Emperor’s own title was expanded to *Kaiyuan Heaven-and-Earth Great Treasure Sagely Cultured Divine Martial Verifying-the-Dao Filial Virtue Emperor*. A general amnesty was declared for the realm.

In the fifteenth year, while the Emperor was in Shu, the Primordial One appeared beside the Blackwater River in Sanquan County, Hanzhong Prefecture. The Emperor personally paid homage, and a stone likeness of the true visage was carved at the site of the apparition. Later, in Yichang County, Lizhou, the Emperor witnessed the Primordial One riding a white beast across a mountain ridge—an omen of the suppression of An Lushan. The mountain was enfeoffed as White Beast Ridge, and the site of the manifestation was consecrated as the Abbey of Spontaneous Generation. Additionally, the Abbey of Flourishing Tang was established on Mount Song, and the Abbey of Blessed Tang in Chengdu.

On the eighteenth day of the third month in the second year of the Zhide era of Emperor Suzong, the Primordial One manifested upon Cloud Dragon Crag in Tonghua Prefecture. Earlier, the local populace had held a grand fast to pray for the state’s welfare. On the eighteenth day, a fragrant mist arose, lingering without dissipation. By the hour of *chen*, it gradually cleared, revealing a divine radiance illuminating the sky. The true image of the Primordial One stood before the mountain, stretching from earth to heaven, clad in white robes, the left hand hanging down and the right holding a five-rayed fan. The august countenance shone resplendently, and all present gazed in reverence. Though the mountain was lofty, it barely reached the figure’s elbow. After a long while, the vision vanished.

Thereupon, a memorial was duly submitted to the throne, and an illustrated scroll was presented from the inner palace. The Supreme August Emperor composed a eulogy with a preface, the text of which, being lengthy, is not recorded here. The account was compiled into the historical annals and disseminated throughout the realm.

In the second year of the Qianyuan era, the Emperor dreamed one night that two azure youths led him to a palace, where he was granted an audience with the Primordial One. The Primordial One wore robes of cloud and mist and a crown adorned with nine phoenixes. Seated upon a square mat, beneath a jeweled canopy, he leaned upon a jade table, holding a white whisk. Arrayed about him were attendants, perfected beings, jade maidens, divine immortals, and youths, along with warriors from the five celestial realms—an assembly of boundless multitude. The Emperor, clad in crimson robes and bearing the jade tablet of office, stood in attendance behind the Primordial One. Together they traversed mountains and seas, journeying vast distances, each step vividly etched in the Emperor’s memory. He also beheld the Primordial One’s beard and hair, both black as ink.

At dawn, the Emperor summoned officials from both thoroughfares and inquired after auspicious images at the Hall of the Sacred Ancestor in the Guangtian Abbey of Wuben Ward. There, they indeed discovered an image of the Elder Lord with a black beard. A likeness was painted and presented to the Emperor, who, upon seeing it, rejoiced greatly, for it matched precisely what he had witnessed in his dream. He then had his own true portrait brought forth and ordered it placed in attendance behind the Primordial One. This was proclaimed throughout the empire, with instructions for universal veneration.

Early in his reign, Emperor Daizong obtained eight treasures in Anyi County of Chuzhou, whereupon the county was renamed Baoying. A Baoying Abbey was erected at the site of the discovery, and the era name was changed to the first year of Baoying, with a general amnesty declared across the land.

In the tenth year of the Zhenyuan era of Emperor Dezong, the Primordial One secretly dispatched the Queen Mother of the West to descend repeatedly upon Jinquan Mountain in Guozhou. There, she transmitted the arts of refining black *qi* to the female perfected one Xie Ziran. After completing her cultivation, on the sixteenth day of the tenth month of that year, she ascended to heaven in broad daylight. Three months later, she returned and said to Prefect Li Jian: “In the heavens stands the loftiest Jade Hall, where the Elder Lord resides. The walls are inscribed with the names of divine immortals, with annotations beneath recording their earthly incarnations—some as emperors, others as chief ministers. When immortals pay homage to the Elder Lord, all bow four times.” Having spoken, Xie Ziran once more ascended to heaven.

In the second year of the Baoli era of Emperor Jingzong, on the first month’s *?* day, the Emperor performed rites at the southern suburban altar and presented offerings at the Grand Clarity Palace.

As the imperial carriage approached, Zheng Weng, the chief clerk of Chang’an County, suddenly saw the Elder Lord clad in white robes, his appearance extraordinary. He addressed Wan, saying: “There is a well along this path—seal it swiftly, or calamity shall befall beyond measure.” Wan, alarmed, turned to see the ground already subtly subsiding and thus joined forces to fill it. Thereupon, the Elder Lord vanished from sight. When the imperial carriage arrived, the matter was reported in full, and the hundred officials offered their congratulations. An edict was issued to the Vice Minister of War, Wei Chuhou, to compose an inscription, while the Recorder of Imperial Deeds, Liu Gongquan, was tasked with calligraphy. The stele was erected beside the sealed well and subsequently recorded by the court historians.

On the eighteenth day of the twelfth month of that year, as Liu Gongquan inscribed the stele, a sudden gust of fierce wind arose, swirling without cease. Then appeared the Primordial One, robed in purple, crowned in gold, and shod in golden slippers, standing upon a white lotus. In his right hand he held a Fivefold Radiance Fan, while his left hung down, the air around him luminous as golden light. Gongquan and the stonecutters gazed upon him for a long while, then traced his form upon the ground. As the drawing neared completion, the Primordial One suddenly pointed his fan toward the sky, scattering streams of light in all directions before soaring aloft. The crowd turned to watch, their bodies angled upward as he receded, growing ever smaller until he vanished into the clouds. The event was then reported to the throne.

A decree was issued to incorporate these events into the stele’s inscription. Furthermore, the court ordered the construction of the Yan-Tang Abbey in both capitals.

In the fifth month of the second year of Kaicheng during Emperor Wenzong’s reign, the Drafter of the Imperial Chancellery, Gao Yuanyu, was serving as Prefect of Bazhou. Eight or nine *li* north of the prefectural seat, before a small hill along the Jialing River, he suddenly noticed an unusual radiance upon the cliff face. Drawing nearer, he saw that the stone bore a natural inscription forming the true image of the Venerable Lord: his brows and hair, robes and sash, headscarf and slippers—all were perfectly complete. Beside him stood one figure, clad in flowing robes with wide sleeves, holding an incense burner to offer fragrance. Behind was another, a youth with twin topknots bound high, reverent as though awaiting command. None of these could have been achieved by human craft, whether through painting, casting, or carving. Whenever Yuanyu made prayers, purple-black vapors would rise above the image. A sacred spring also welled forth spontaneously, and when the gentry and common folk sought blessings, none failed to receive immediate efficacy. Thus, the stone was carved, and a hall erected to mark this auspicious sign. Yuanyu then had the image painted and submitted to the throne, petitioning that it be recorded in the histories. The imperial assent was granted.

In the first year of Huichang during Emperor Wuzong’s reign, on the fifteenth day of the second month—the birthday of the Great Sage Ancestor—it was decreed that the day be established as the *Jiang-Sheng* Festival. The court further commanded that in both capitals and all prefectures and commanderies throughout the realm, vegetarian feasts be held, the Dao be practiced, and music performed. Three days of grand intoxication were granted, with no exception even for urgent military campaigns. This was to be observed as a permanent institution.

In the ninth month of the tenth year of Xiantong during Emperor Yizong’s reign, on the tenth day, the rebel Pang Xun of Xuzhou led over three thousand followers to the Taiqing Abbey in Bozhou. That day, more than three hundred commoners north of the abbey witnessed the Venerable Lord ascend into the sky from within the abbey, heading south. In an instant, black mist blanketed the southern plains. The rebel horde lost their way and turned upon one another in slaughter, while Pang Xun drowned in the waters. The band of villains was thus utterly annihilated. Li Wei, the Pacification Commissioner of Bianzhou and Supervisor of the Taiqing Abbey, reported the matter to the throne.

The imperial edict proclaimed: Our imperial house traces its lineage to the Primordial One, upholding the teachings of purity and tranquility. In the ancient village of Ku County lies the sacred homeland of the Sage Lord, where palaces stand in solemn grandeur and temple halls are duly established. Yet recently, remnant rebels charged forth and set fires, seeking to burn and destroy. Suddenly, dark mist enveloped the clear skies, and the frenzied bandits lost their way upon the roads, scattering across the plains only to meet annihilation. In reverence of this mysterious power, we offer our deepest gratitude. An inner decree issued a *qingci* prayer, and Li Wei was entrusted with the solemn duty of reporting and giving thanks. The matter was made known throughout the realm and recorded by the court historians.

In the third month of the thirteenth year, Prefect Yao Que of Taizhou memorialized that while renovating the Hall of the Venerable Lord on Mount Tiantai, a stone casket containing inscribed tablets was unearthed at the site. He requested that these be submitted to the Historiography Institute and proclaimed across the land. The imperial decree approved this.

In the third month of the second year of Guangming, Military Commissioner Wang Chongrong of Hezhong reported that, according to a memorial from Jinzhou, at the Qingtang Abbey on Dragon Horn Mountain, beside the Hall of the Venerable Lord, a withered vine on the twin trees had miraculously revived. Previously, during the Wude era, after the Primordial One’s manifestation, a hall was erected between the two trees. Over a year later, a vine spontaneously grew upon them, stretching over ten *zhang* in length, its luxuriance surpassing the ordinary. Later, when Prince Qi usurped the heirship, the vine withered and died. Yet within days, fresh green shoots regrew from its tips, and soon after, Prince Qi met his downfall. During Emperor Zhongzong’s restoration, the An Lushan rebellion, and Zhu Ci’s treason, the vine withered each time, only to revive again. In the first year of Guangming, when Huang Chao threatened the capital, the vine withered that autumn. By the following spring, its branches and leaves flourished anew. Moreover, a new vine sprouted from a neighboring tree, growing over fifty *chi* in ten days, its paired vines thriving in extraordinary splendor. The memorial was met with imperial praise, and the event was recorded by the court historians. Thereafter, all such auspicious omens were duly reported by decree—a testament to the boundless virtue of the vine, celebrating the wisdom of ancestral counsel, and foretelling the enduring prosperity of the imperial line, as the Dao’s flow continues unbroken through generations without end.

Emperor Xizong, having taken refuge in western Shu, received the report on the ninth day of the eighth month of the second year of Zhonghe. He ordered it proclaimed throughout the court and realm. On the eleventh day of the third month of the third year, Prefect Pan Zhou of Bozhou dispatched the Daoists Ma Hanzhang and Sun Qiwu to memorialize that since the fourth year of Qianning, the Taiqing Abbey in Zhenyuan had repeatedly suffered incursions by rebel forces, numbering from over a thousand to as many as ten thousand. All sought to plunder the abbey, some attacking cities, others raiding county towns. Yet each time, the Venerable Lord secretly manifested his divine power: dense clouds would suddenly arise, or yin winds would drive them back, or hail and thunder would strike, causing the rebels to stumble and scatter, soon meeting their doom. As his numinous efficacy grew ever more manifest, his divine works remained unfathomable. A decree was issued elevating Zhenyuan County to the status of a capital district, and a *qingci* prayer was composed to honor and give thanks. The Emperor bowed in reverence.

On the twelfth day of the eighth month, it was proclaimed: The Taiqing Abbey in Bozhou is the sacred birthplace of the Primordial One’s descent, its name exalted as the ancestral home of the Dao. Its blessings have nurtured the imperial foundation, its nine-palace auspices welling from the heavens, and the immortal traces of the single deer lingering upon the trees. Auspicious signs through successive dynasties are worthy of record, and in recent years, divine responses have been especially evident. How fitting it is to adorn this hallowed sanctuary with splendor, rather than allow its sacred halls to fall into neglect. Prefect Pan Zhou has governed with benevolence, long steeped in upright principles. He has generously donated his salary to restore the abbey, ensuring that its walls, eaves, beams, and rafters are all meticulously renewed, while the painted images and decorations shine with even greater brilliance. Upon reviewing the plans and records, his merits are truly commendable. The abbey’s presiding Daoist, Wu Chongxuan, shall be granted the purple robe and titled Master of Serene Mystery. The Daoists Ma Hanzhang and Sun Qiwu shall also be granted the purple robe. Pan Zhou shall be promoted to Grand Master for Splendid Happiness with Silver and Gold, and concurrently serve as Minister of Works, retaining his other titles.

On the night of the twenty-ninth day of the eighth month of that year, Emperor Zhaozong, along with the imperial clansman Li Teli and the Daoist Li Yuan, conducted a *jiao* ritual at the Xianyang Fair’s Xuanzhong Abbey in Chengdu—the very site of the Primordial One’s descent—praying for the presence of the True One. Suddenly, a rainbow-hued light, no larger than a pellet, appeared, gradually brightening and expanding. It emerged from the bamboo grove southeast of the hall’s foundation, leapt and bounded toward the plum tree in the southwest, then vanished into the earth, sinking three *chi* deep. There, a treasure casket was unearthed, measuring one *chi*, one *cun*, and five *fen* in length, seven *cun* and four *fen* in width. One side was one *cun* and three *fen* thick, adorned with floral patterns; the other side was one *cun* and eight *fen* thick, weighing twelve *jin*. Six ancient seal-script characters, each two *cun* square and three *fen* deep, were inscribed upon it, their carving so lustrous it seemed beyond human craft. The inscription read: *The Supreme One pacifies the calamities of the Middle Harmony.*

On the first day of the ninth month, Military Commissioner Chen Jingxuan of Xichuan, the Grand Preceptor, memorialized: Your Imperial Majesty, in emulating antiquity and aligning with Heaven, has received the mandate and governed the realm, cherishing the supreme Dao and yearning for great harmony. Thus, you have toured the provinces to reflect upon your faults, extending benevolence to the land below, while your perfect virtue ascends to the celestial realms. Prophecies and omens have duly arrived, and auspicious signs have emerged in succession. The Supreme One has bestowed the mandate to uphold and sustain, purging the calamities of banditry and rebellion in this era of Middle Harmony. Now, through these ancient seal-script characters, the divine decree is made manifest, foretelling the swift eradication of evil vapors, the boundless longevity of the sacred reign, and the imminent arrival of the day of recovery and peace.

On the twelfth day, the Emperor ordered the proclamation to be shown to all officials. The Minister of the Secretariat and concurrent Grand Councilor Wei Zhaodu, the Minister of Revenue and concurrent Grand Councilor Xiao Gou, the Minister of the Chancellery and concurrent Grand Councilor Zheng Tian, the Censor-in-Chief Zhang Du, and the Minister of the Imperial Clan, Prince Gui of Cao, presented a memorial of congratulation: We humbly note that when bandits howl and rebels gather, the imperial carriage tours the provinces; when natural disasters strike, they have occurred in every age. Your Majesty has issued a decree of self-reproach like that of Cheng Tang, and dispatched the punitive forces of a true king. The wicked rebels shall soon be annihilated, and the signs of peace and prosperity are already evident. Now, the hidden aid of the divine is revealed through these secret characters.

The vermilion sparrow bearing the scripture—how could this be equated with the Supreme Lord’s manifestations? The black *qi* bearing the hexagrams—how could such blessings be compared to mere disaster’s end? Moreover, on the very day when the imperial clan performed their rites of purification and offering, auspicious radiance leapt and danced as a wondrous sign. Such responsive revelation may well be called most clear and certain.

The Bureau of Military Affairs Commissioner Li Shunrong and the Commander-in-Chief of the Twelve Armies and Twelve Guards Tian Lingzi presented a memorial of congratulation: Now, once again, the imperial kinsmen have come to the immortal’s abode. No sooner had their utmost sincerity arisen than propitious omens appeared. The crimson glow now manifest upon the earth is none other than the purple *qi* that once passed beyond the pass. Upon excavating the accumulated soil, ancient script was indeed uncovered. The untrammeled force of dragons and serpents was confirmed, and the pacification of the rebel realm was thereby known. In the profound and abstruse principles of governance, this is most luminously revealed.

Since the Supreme Lord now bestows blessings equal to the end of calamity, we know that harmony shall endure forever. The manifestation of this imperial destiny arises entirely from the sacred ancestor’s discovery. Moreover, as the imperial scion now bears this numinous trace, the will of Heaven is made clear. The Primordial Supreme Ancestor, whenever great trials arose, always displayed extraordinary portents. These luminous proofs are fully recorded in the standard histories. Formerly, at the Vermilion Phoenix Gate, he revealed to Tian Tongxiu the time of restoration for the Tianbao era; now, at the Green Ram Market, he has shown Li Teli the joy of Your Majesty’s return to the palace. Truly, the realm is most fortunate. We humbly request that this be entrusted to the historiographers.

The Emperor approved all these memorials.

On the fifteenth day, Li Teli was appointed Collator of the Eastern Palace, and Li Yuan was granted the purple robe, each additionally bestowed with three hundred bolts of fine silk.

On the twenty-first day, another edict was issued: The Supreme Lord of the Dao, the Most High and Primordial Emperor, once discoursed on the true scriptures with his disciple, Master Wen Shi, upon the terrace of the Louguan Abbey, and they agreed to meet again at the Green Ram Market before ascending together upon cloud chariots into the Flowing Sands. This account is preserved in oral tradition and marked upon geographical maps. From the time of King Zhao of Zhou until this day, some two thousand years have passed, during which the numinous traces have remained silent and the foundations desolate. Now, through the imperial progress, the divine has become manifestly clear: extraordinary light leapt and danced before the courtyard, and sacred script was elucidated beneath the trees.

Rich with ancient hues, its characters bear auspicious omens. As the calamities of the Zhonghe era neared their end, propitious signs emerged from the depths of the earth. This fully revealed the favor bestowed by the Mysterious Heavens and the blessings conferred by the Sacred Ancestor, who would annihilate the weapons of great bandits and forever illuminate the enterprise of the Middle Revival. These events must be recorded in annals and proclaimed throughout the realm.

They were already entrusted to the court historians for compilation and transcription, with the text to be carved and disseminated to all circuits and military fronts. The abbey was to be renamed the Green Ram Palace, and halls and chambers were to be constructed. The adjacent lands belonging to the abbey, approximately two *qing* in area, had recently been scattered among the common folk, who planted onions and garlic there. Such a pure and empty site could not endure such profane vapors, so two hundred strings of cash were granted to redeem the land, with official deeds issued to ensure its perpetual归属 to the House of Tranquility.

Zongzi Teli had already been appointed to office, and the Daoist Li Yuan had been bestowed the purple robe. Their promotions and rewards were fitting tributes to the numinous blessings. Reverently occupying the highest ranks of the public sphere, their influence spread across commanderies and states. They served with devotion in an era of extended prosperity and cultivated their minds in the homeland of Dao and virtue. Thus, they caused the land to be purged of war and treasures to emerge from the earth—such excellence is doubly worthy of praise and acclaim.

On the seventh day of the tenth month, the high-ranking official Guo Xuntai was appointed to supervise the construction of the Green Ram Palace, with funds drawn from the imperial treasury. From the time the numinous omens first appeared until the *guichou* day of that month, bandits near the Shu commandery were successively captured and executed, and within ten days, the land was pacified. The imperial carriage visited the Green Ram Palace, and gifts were bestowed accordingly. Li Teli was granted a ceremonial cap and appointed Recorder of Longzhou. Another edict was issued:

"The Supreme Lord has conferred blessings, and the Green Ram has manifested in response. It is fitting to honor and adorn this site to reciprocate such extraordinary favor. The Purple Culmen Palaces in all circuits, prefectures, and commanderies shall be entrusted to local officials for proper renovation, and Daoists skilled in ritual shall be selected to perform offerings and sacrifices."

On the *yimao* day of that month, it was reported that the capital had been recovered, demonstrating that the Great Dao bestows favor, the Sacred Ancestor grants protection, the grand design endures forever, and the Tang’s mandate knows no bounds. The Hanlin Academician, Chief Minister, Minister of War, and Drafter of Edicts, Yue Penggui, was ordered to compose and erect a stele. It is humbly requested that this be proclaimed throughout the realm to manifest that the imperial house descends from the lineage of immortals and has been moved by the numinous efficacy of the Supreme Lord—truly an endless blessing for ten thousand generations.

Upon review, since the founding of the dynasty, approximately 1,900 palaces and abbeys have been constructed, with over 15,000 Daoists ordained. The palaces and abbeys donated by imperial kinsmen, noble consorts, high officials, and commoners are not included in this count. Such is the grandeur of the imperial enterprise—from ancient times to our present dynasty, none can be fully recounted.

On the fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the fourth year of Zhonghe, this record was respectfully submitted by Du Guangting, Daoist of the Purple Robe, Grand Master for the Propagation of Teaching, and Drafter of Literary Works at the Supreme Clarity Palace in the Upper Capital.

*Record of the Veneration of the Dao Through the Ages* — Concluded.
