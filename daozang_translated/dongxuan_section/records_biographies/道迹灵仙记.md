The original text does not name its author, but it is suspected to be a remnant of the *Southern Dynasties* text *Dao/Way Traces Scripture* by Gu Xuan (顾欢). Many of the ghostly deities listed in this work appear in Tao Hongjing’s *True Admonitions* (《真诰》). One volume.

**Dao/Way Traces of the Spiritually Transcendent Record**
**First Chapter: The Six Palaces of the Six Realms of Ghostly Deities**

The Luo Ding (罗酆) Mountains lie in the northern *癸地* (Guidi, the 8th of the 28 lunar constellations’ earthly domains). Towering two thousand six hundred *里* (li, ~840 miles), their circumference spans three thousand *里* (li, ~1,260 miles). Beneath the mountain lies a *Dongtian* (洞天, "Cavern of Heaven"), encircling one thousand five hundred *里* (li, ~630 miles). Both above and below this cavern are palaces occupied by ghosts and spirits.

Upon the mountain are six palaces, and within the cavern, there are another six. Each palace measures a thousand *里* (li, ~420 miles) in circumference—these are the six *Tian* (天, "Heavens") of the ghostly deities, with the mountain-top palaces as the outer realms and the cavern palaces as the inner. Their structures are identical.

The first palace is called the **Palace of the Perishing Tyrant’s Dark Dao/Way** (纣绝阴天宫), the second the **Palace of the Great Slaying and Righteous Decrees** (太杀谅事宗天宫), the third the **Palace of the Illuminating Dawn and the Unyielding Offender’s Martial City** (明晨耐犯武城天宫), the fourth the **Palace of the Serene Light and Punitive Qi** (恬照罪气天宫), the fifth the **Palace of the Sovereign Spirit and the Seven Non-Realms** (宗灵七非天宫), and the sixth the **Palace of the Audacious Official and the Endless Winding Realm** (敢司连宛屡天宫). These six palaces constitute the governance of the ghostly deities across the Six Realms.

The six cavern palaces mirror their names and forms exactly, hence they are called the **Inner and Outer Six Heavenly Palaces** (六天内外宫殿).

If mortals know the names of the six gates of the Luo Ding palaces, the hundred ghosts dare not cause harm.

Before sleeping, one should face north and recite the incantation three times, softly. The divine incantation reads:

*"I am a disciple of the Most High. Below, I command the Six Realms. These Six Heavenly Palaces are under my jurisdiction. It is not only my jurisdiction but also the domain of the Most High. I know the names of the Six Heavenly Gates—thus I attain longevity. If any dare to offend, the Most High will behead you.*

*The first palace is named the Palace of the Perishing Tyrant’s Dark Dao/Way. From here, proceed eastward to the second, and in sequence, to the sixth.*

*Then, with the six incisors of the rat, descend and rest—warding off all malevolent ghosts and demons."*

When a person dies, they first go to the **Palace of the Perishing Tyrant’s Dark Dao/Way** to be registered. Some may first visit famous mountains or Mount Tai (泰山), the Yangtze (江), or the Yellow River (河), but they need not immediately proceed to the first heavenly palace. On the day they are due for registration, their fate—whether fortunate or ill-fated, and the consequences of their deeds—will be determined here, in the first heavenly palace.

The **Palace of the Great Slaying** governs the slaying ghosts (杀鬼), the second realm. Those who die violently or suddenly also pass through here.

The **Palace of the Illuminating Dawn** is where virtuous sages and enlightened beings are registered before their passing. The **Palace of the Serene Light** oversees the allocation of retribution, fortune, misfortune, predestined fate, and the punishment of offenses. The **Ghostly Officials of the Northern Dipper** (鬼官北斗君) administer this realm. The *Northern Dipper* (北斗) of the ghostly officials is not the celestial *Northern Dipper*—rather, it is a separate *Northern Dipper Official* who governs life and death.

The *Ghostly Officials’ Supreme Emperor* (太帝) is the **Northern Emperor** (北帝君), who presides over the first heavenly palace and oversees all six. The remaining four heavenly palaces are each governed by the **Four Bright Lords** (四明公).

Each of the six heavenly palaces is staffed by one official, totaling three officials for the six realms—akin to the modern *criminal and judicial offices* (刑名之职). These officials examine and sentence the deceased, reporting to the **True Immortal Officials of Fate** (真仙司命) and overseeing their governance. They also command the **Immortal Precincts** (仙府) and collectively manage the affairs of life and death, with all major judgments made by the immortal officials.

The *Ghostly Officials’ Northern Dipper* (鬼官北斗君) is merely the **examiner of the Daoist Seven Stars** (道家七辰北斗之考官). This ghostly official is also subordinate to the **Nine Star Spirits** (九星之精), reporting to the **Jade Emperor of the Northern Pole** (北辰玉君).

Xiang Liang (项梁) composed *The Luo Ding Ode* (《酆都颂》), which reads:

*"The Tyrant’s Perishing Banner in the Dawn,
The Righteous Decrees Meet their End in the Heavy Fog."*

The flaming glow rises like smoke in the heavens,
Its brilliance bursts forth like the radiant splendor of the sun’s reflection.

The martial city encircles the divine peaks,
Serene and luminous, it swallows the Azure River whole.
The grand gates overlook the Vermilion Well,
While Cloud Gate looms dark and towering.

The Seven Non-Existent [Stars] span their wondrous canopy,
And the Linked Enveloping [Stars] stretch their arcane magic.
Six heavens stretch across the Northern Dao—
This is the realm of ghosts and spirits.

The ode contains twenty thousand words,
Now I briefly excerpt the inscriptions of the Six Heavens alone.
Even at night, it may be read in whispers,
A charm to repel malevolent ghosts.

On Mount Luo Ding, the trees, waters, and marshes are all like those of the mortal world,
Yet the rice grains are as large as pomegranate seeds,
Their taste like that of water chestnuts—
The other four grains are likewise, though they are simply called "rice" and "heavy-thought" [重思].

Du Qiong composed *The Heavy-Thought Ode*:
*"Spring’s verdant abundance descends in misty grace,
Lush and emerald, the heavy-thought grain thrives.
Divine qi envelops all—
The auspicious grain ripens in season.
With the four seasons enjoyed,
The people bless the harvest with offerings.
The sacred grain flourishes in the boundless capital,
Its colossal ears stretch across my dark hall—
Here lies a clear omen,
By which the Sage-King brings prosperity."*

This is called *heavy-thought rice* [重思].
Its grains are like pomegranate seeds,
Large and distinct, with a taste like water chestnuts—
Also presented above to the immortal officials.

**Chapter on the Ghostly Sovereigns**
Flame-Regal Jia [炎庆甲] was the ancient Flame Emperor,
Now the Northern Grand Sovereign [北太帝君],
The master of all ghosts and spirits in the world.

King Wu of Zhou [武王] now serves as the Ghostly Official of the Northern Dipper.
Xuanyu [夏启] is the Eastern Bright Lord [东明公], commanding the Dipper Marshal.
King Wen [文王] is the Western Bright Lord [西明公], commanding the Northern Emperor’s Marshal.
Chao Gong Si [召公奭] is the Southern Bright Lord [南明公].
Wu Ji Za [吴季札] is the Northern Bright Lord [北明公].

The Four Bright Lords each have four attendants.
Yet these Four Lords later shall receive the Dao of transformation,
Ascending to the ranks beneath the immortals.

The Four Bright Lords oversee the ghosts of the four directions,
And sixteen Bright Attendants [四明郎] govern the blood-and-sacrifice ghosts of the world’s ancestral halls.

Zhou Zhen [周颛] was the Ghostly Marshal of Fate,
Now Deng Yue [邓岳] and Cheng Xie [程遐] serve in his place due to his many affairs.

Jia Yi [贾谊], the Western Bright Prohibition Officer,
Once mismanaged the imperial stables and was demoted to guard Mount Tai,
Now the Mount Tai Sovereign has recently petitioned to make him a marshal.

The Southern Gate Warden has been replaced by Zhou Fu [周抚], succeeding Ge Jian [郄鉴].

Each Heavenly Gate has two wardens,
And each warden has four Gate-Keeping Officers—
Thus, one Heavenly Gate has eight Gate-Keeping Officers in total.
These officers serve beneath the Heavenly Gate Wardens—
This is the gate of the Northern Emperor.

The Heavenly Gate Warden under the Northern Dipper is now Zang Hong [臧洪],
Who succeeded Kui Hao [隗嚣], with another position filled by Wang Bo [王波].

Ji Zhan [纪瞻], originally the marshal of the River-Pacifying General,
Now serves as a Northern Heaven Gate-Keeping Officer,
Replacing Tian Yin Zhan [田银瞻] and Yu Tan [虞谭],
Taking turns to guard the Heavenly Gate for one day at a time.

Wei Zhao [魏钊] leads as the Marquis of Lu Mountain.
Gu He [顾和], returning from garrison duty in Liaodong,
Having completed his service, is now to be appointed as the Standard-Bearer Officer.
Fan Ming [范明], the former Standard-Bearer, has been promoted to the Lord of the Seal.

Yin Hao [殷浩] attends the Emperor of Dawn,
Confronting He Yan [何晏] in debate.
Wen Tai Zhen [温太真] is the Overseer of the Eastern Sea,
Recently appointing Du Yu [杜预] as his Chief of Staff,
With a rank equivalent to that of a General’s Chief of Staff.

He Sidao [何次道], originally an internal inspector under the Northern Emperor,
Has since returned to the Zhu Huo Palace to receive transformation,
Due to his prior deeds of great benevolence.

Emperor Wu of Wei [魏武帝] serves as the Northern Grand Tutor [北若太傅].
The rest are too numerous to recount.

This is the affair of ghosts and spirits,
Unworthy of being revealed to the world—
The words of Master Xun [荀公].

**Chapter Three: The Dao of Sleeping**

When a man lies down, his bed must be raised high—
for if it is high, the earthly *qi* will not reach him,
and the ghosts will not blow upon him.
The *qi* of ghosts invading a man
always ascends from the earth below.

The chamber where one sleeps must be kept pure and clean—
if it is pure, one receives the refined *qi* of the spirits;
if it is unclean, one receives the stale *qi* of the past.
The disruptive *qi* of the dead within a chamber
makes all undertakings fail,
all actions collapse.
The same applies to the body—
one must bathe and cleanse oneself often,
or else hope is lost.

Do not speak of the Dao while learning the Dao.
If one speaks of the Dao while learning the Dao,
ghosts will assault the person,
and nothing will succeed—
the body will fall ill,
for the essence has not yet been perfected.

Master Shan Sheng, far away, received the teachings of Master Meng.
In the evening, before sleep, he would recite the *Huangting Neijing* once,
then rest—
thus refining his soul and spirit by himself.
If one practices this for twenty-one years,
one becomes immortal—
this is the way of harmonizing ten thousand recitations.
To recite three or four times in the evening is already excellent.
Madame Jiang of the Northern Peak said:
“Reciting this also prevents illness—
this is the Dao of not dying.”

**Chapter Four: Nighttime Tooth-Chattering**

At night, one must habitually chatter one’s teeth—
for tooth-chattering has no limit.
Killing ghosts and malevolent ghosts fear the sound of tooth-chattering,
and thus dare not approach a man.

If one combines this with spitting and reciting incantations,
the effect is even better.

In the past, there was a man named Bao Zhu,
from Jibei.
He was not one to study the Dao,
nor did he know any techniques.
At over forty years of age,
he suddenly suffered from wind illness—
his face was distorted, his eyes and mouth misaligned,
and the wind *qi* entered his mouth,
causing his upper and lower teeth to constantly strike together,
with a loud sound,
day and night without cease.
He lived to be 127 years old.
Later, he encountered extreme cold and fell into the Changshou River,
where he drowned.

Even the Northern Emperor’s subordinates,
who were sent to kill ghosts and punish those who wander the earth,
did not dare approach Zhu.
The Ghost Official questioned the reason,
and the Heavenly Executioner replied:
“This man uses many techniques to restrain us.
He habitually strikes his teeth and beats the heavenly drum
to alert the spirit within his body,
so that the spirit cannot scatter,
and the ghostly *qi* cannot enter.
Thus, there was no cause for us to kill him.”

From this, it can be reasoned:
If Zhu had not fallen into the water,
he might have lived to a thousand years without dying.
At that time, he encountered extreme cold
and walked on the frozen river,
his mouth unable to chatter his teeth—
thus, the ghosts caused him to drown in the river.

Even those afflicted with wind illness,
whose teeth chatter on their own,
still manage to avoid death and repel ghosts—
how much more so for a genuine Daoist
who deliberately chatter his teeth
and beats the heavenly drum to strengthen his spirit!

The *Xianfang* says:
“Constantly swallowing saliva and chattering the teeth
will make one’s lifespan reverse and shorten.”

**Chapter Five: The Northern Emperor’s Officials**

Eight attendants serve the Emperor of Dawn:
Xu Shu, Pang De, Yuan Yu, Li Guang, Wang Jia, He Yan, Jie Jie, and Yin Hao—
all like the *shizhong* of the mortal world.

The Four Bright Lords and the Northern Dipper Lord
each have five attendants to the Emperor of Dawn.
The eight mentioned earlier are the Northern Emperor’s officials,
and their selection follows the same rules.

There are also four *zhonglang* direct attendants,
like the *shangshu* of the mortal world.
Dai Yuan, Gongsun Du, Liu Feng, and Guo Jia hold these posts today.
Feng was the adopted son of Xuande,
who now serves as the Northern He Marquis,
opposing Han Sui.
He is now under the command of the Celestial Officials.

There are also two *dajinchen* officials,
like the *shangshu* of the mortal world—
today, Han Guangwu and Sun Wentai hold these posts.

There are also *zhongjinchen* officials,
like the *zhongshu* of the mortal world,
with two overseers—
Yan Huai and Yang Biao hold these posts.
Huai’s courtesy name was *Siji*,
and Biao’s was *Wenxian*.

The father of Xu Changshi now serves as the Southern Danfang Marquis.
There are two Danfang Marqises,
each overseeing the south and north.
Xu Changshi’s father is the Southern Danfang Marquis,
Liu Zan serves as his *simaji*,
Bao Xun is the Northern Danfang Marquis,
and Wei Zun is his *simaji*.
They also control the keys to the southern and northern gates.
Xu commands a thousand soldiers of the Southern威,
and Bao Xun commands a thousand soldiers of the Northern威—
their primary duty is to guard the gates,
like the *Yulin* overseers of the mortal world.
The soldiers of the Southern威 and Northern威
follow the Daoist example of the Heavenly Warriors and armored soldiers.

Sun Ce serves as the guest of the Shuming Lord,
Han Gao as the guest of the Naning Lord,
Jin Xuan as the guest of the Ximing Lord,
and Xun Hu as the guest of the Beiming Lord.
Among them, those with past virtues and hidden deeds of benevolence and rescue
are sometimes directly appointed to celestial offices,
or enter the Southern Palace to receive transformation,
regardless of their former rank.

The rewards and punishments one receives in life
are measured by one’s accumulated karma.

Generally, those who practice great benevolence and relieve the suffering of the destitute
are swiftly admitted to the Southern Palace,
becoming the path of immortal transformation.

Yu Yuan Gui serves as the Northern Emperor’s *qianzhongwei* General,
taking Guo Changxiang as his *changshi* and Hua Shao as his *simaji*—
this is what is called a *jun gong*,
commanding thousands of ghostly soldiers.

Kong Rong serves as the *houzhongwei* General,
with Zhang Xu as his *simaji* and Tang Gu as his *changshi*.

Tao Can serves as the Xihe Marquis,
also commanding thousands of soldiers.
He recently sought Teng Han to replace him,
but the request was not yet granted.
Xu Ning serves as his *changshi*,
but due to his failure to capture the rebellious generals at the Northern Gate,
he was dismissed from office.
Cai Mo should replace Ning.

The Four Viceroys each command ten thousand ghostly soldiers,
while central officials command only thousands.
The Four Viceroys consist of:
the Taishan Lord, the Lulong Lord, the Dongyue General, and the Nanba Marquis—
each commanding ten thousand soldiers.

He Zong serves as the Nanba Marquis,
Cao Ren as the Lulong Lord,
Liu Tao as the Dongyue General,
and Xun Lei as the Taishan Lord.

There are hundreds of places where ten thousand soldiers are stationed,
and hundreds where thousands are stationed—
all under mutual command and subordination.

「All hold the title of *changshi* (長史). The *zhuanshi* (司馬) Zhen took Gu Zong as the Taishan General, appointed Cao Hong as the *zhuanshi* (司馬), and Huan Fan as the *changshi* (長史).
Wang Yishao’s affairs in the Imperial Palace have lasted five years; it is said that his affairs have now dispersed.

Jiang Ji became the Nan Mountain Marquis, commanding two thousand soldiers.
Wang Gu became the Departmental Ghost General.

Among those with official ranks, they roughly recognize one another by surname and given name,
but those without rank are countless—impossible to enumerate fully.
Even among the scattered ranks, the number of mortals in China is far greater than those on the frontier.

Xu Zhao now serves as the Right Marshal of Dongming Gong, a post akin to the *zhongshu shi* (中书监) of the mortal world.
Shao Shi serves as Dongming Gong, having been appointed as the Right Protector of the Nine Palaces in the upper realm.

The rulers beneath the earth are divided into three grades,
as are the titles of *guishuai* (鬼帅).
All are granted these positions due to accumulated virtue and deeds in their past lives.

Some seek longevity through Daoist practice,
others through their descendants’ virtuous conduct, which spreads the blessings of their ancestors,
or through reciting the profound and mysterious teachings,
so that their influence flows into the Kun Ancestors.

The paths to attaining these ranks are many,
yet the means of achieving them are varied.

It is essential to accumulate hidden merit in this world
before ascending to these stages of broad life.

The *guishuai* (鬼帅) attain martial mastery,
while the rulers attain literary mastery—
both mark the beginning of transcendence.
They are also called by the degree *Donghua* (东华),
registered in the *Shangdi* (上帝)’s ledgers,
and are not subject to the *Tengguan* (酆官) or the Three Officials’ regulations.

The lowest-grade rulers beneath the earth are scattered in the outer dwellings,
idle and without purpose,
unbound by the Nine Palaces’ teachings or training,
yet still within the *Dongtian* (洞天).
They are the lowest among the rulers.

According to the Four Ming Laws,
one must follow the prescribed terms for 140 years before advancing—
one advancement grants the *buxian* (步仙) stage,
allowing them to serve as messengers of the immortals.
The second-grade rulers beneath the earth
directly attain the *xingxian* (行仙) stage,
serving as immortals for 40 years before being promoted to oversee the *jian* (禁) positions—
the *jian* (禁) ranks are akin to mortal officials scattered in the world.

This is the middle rank among the rulers beneath the earth,
with Li Dong and others currently within it.

The third-grade rulers beneath the earth
are the highest among the rulers,
able to enter and exit the chambers of the immortals,
roam the divine lands of the *Shenzhou* (神州),
and transfer between the *Yizhan* (易迁) and *Tongchu* (童初) bureaus.
They may also attend the feasts on the *Donghua* (东华) Upper Platform,
receive instruction in refining their forms,
and cultivate the *jingqi* (景气) of the *Ying* (易).
At twelve years, their *qi* (氣) controls their spirit and soul,
at fifteen years, their spirit returns to their body, and their soul is preserved.
At thirty years, their bones within the coffin revive,
their spirit and soul reunite,
at forty years, they fully recover and are reborn,
returning to wander among mortals.
At fifty years, they are appointed as immortal officials,
and at sixty years, they may roam the *Guanghan* (广寒) Palace.
At a hundred years, they enter the *Kunyun* (昆瀛) Palace—
this is the highest rank among the rulers beneath the earth,
the ultimate indulgence of the immortals.

Zhang Jiangzi and others initially belonged to the third rank,
but they have only now entered the *Yizhan* (易迁).

The hierarchy of *guishuai* (鬼帅) is similarly structured.

On the night of the twenty-fourth day of the seventh month,
the *Baomingjun* (保命君) informed me.

The immortal Xin Xuanzi composed and presented this poem as the sixth in his sequence.

Xuanzi, styled *Yanqi* (延期), was born in Dinggu of Longxi (陇西定谷).
During the reign of Emperor Ming of the Han,
he served as a *Jianyi dafu* (谏议大夫).
He was the son of Sin Yin, the governor of Shangluo, Yunzhong, and Zhao (上洛、云中、赵国) counties.

In his youth, Xuanzi loved learning and followed the Dao.
He revered and upheld the precepts,
devoted himself to austere practice,
ate vegetables at noon,
refined his form and preserved his essence,
and was unmoved by external affairs.
Though officials from the state and capital court repeatedly invited him,
he never accepted their offers.
Sometimes he wandered in the mountains and forests,
abandoning the world’s dust and turmoil,
and aspired to meet Zi Jin among the Weicheng peaks,
traveling to Junyang to walk in the *Xuan* (玄) Way.
Thus, he changed his name to Xuanzi,
and styled himself *Yanqi*.

He did not expect that his ancestors had committed many transgressions,
bringing calamity upon their descendants.
Yet, through his sincerity and virtue,
he was recorded in the *Shangdi*’s (上帝) ledgers,
and his fate reached the *Hou Kun* (后昆).
Though his lifespan was not long,
he perished at the Changliang ferry.

The Western Queen Mother saw my bitter practice,
and the *Tengdu Shangdi* (酆都上帝) pitied my Daoist resolve.
She moved the *Siling* (司命) to act,
sent orders to the Three Officials,
seized my body,
and restored my soul to its true form.
Thus, I was granted the *Yitai* (颐胎) position as an immortal spirit,
and it has now been over two hundred years.

Recently, I was awarded the degree *Nangong* (南宫),
fixed my strategy at *Zhuling* (朱陵),
and preserved my essence, awaiting the time to ascend as an immortal.

Yet the *Tai Di* (太帝) now sees fit to assign me as the commander of Donghai Hou,
replacing Yu Sheng,
and also to select me as a *Jianzhong langjiang* (禁中郎将),
overseeing the affairs of Wu Yue’s ghostly deities.
My duties are endless and exhausting.

As for those who wear the *mao* (冠) of dawn and the *qing* (青) sash,
their robes fluttering with elegance,
ascending the *xian* (仙) stages with resonant bells,
and riding in jade carriages—
though they may possess true hearts,
they have yet to see the day of their attainment.

I regret that I have not yet been permitted
to join the *Xuanzhen* (玄真) in their ranks,
feast together in the *Kunlun* (昆阆) halls,
listen to the lingering melodies of the *Junjiao* (钧韶),
pluck the jade sprigs from the secluded peaks,
wear the green robes of the Nine Heavens,
and dance with clouded wings across the ten directions.

Now I am tasked with commanding the multitude of ghosts,
settling disputes among them,
dwelling amidst the profane,
and hearing the cacophony of malevolent spirits.
My affairs are distant from the Dao and Virtue,
and my gaze is ever more detached from the truth.
Yet I am familiar with the serene stillness of the *Xuanjing* (玄境),
and the boundless freedom of the *Taichu* (太初).

For those who share the same resonance and gather together,
things also fall into similar categories.
Their distant voices echo faintly,
their lingering *jingqi* (景气) and accumulated essence
are why the *Shangqing* (上清) ledgers are named as such,
and the *Danlu* (丹箓) *Xuanjie* (玄阶) are called by these terms.
The Daoist *qi* (氣) harmonizes with their spiritual virtue,
and they entrust their bodies to the lofty and bright.
Thus, they come to follow me.

Today, I present three poems
to express the depth of my gratitude.

The verses read:

*In days past, I entered the realm of darkness,*
*Following the carriage in response to the spirit’s call.*
*The spirit remains with the chamber unscattered,*
*My essence merges with the auspicious clouds.*
*Though my form is not the clarity of bright jade,*
*The mysterious artisan cannot fail to carve me.*
*Stepping forward, I hear the distant chant,*
*Lifting my hands, I play with the resonant strings.*
*In the forest chambers, there is leisurely joy,*
*Yet I sever all ties beyond the pavilion’s gate.*
*The lingering essence clings to the round brilliance,*
*How rare and faint the praises now resound!*
*The silent and boundless realm conveys my emotions,*
*The mysterious essence seizes the harmonious sounds.*
*The high wheels may vary in their paths,*
*Yet the ten thousand fathoms bring them to seek me.*

The rustling **Researcher of the Dao**, merging spirit with the soul’s embrace,
Submitting to the boundless transformation of the world, his heart marked by the secluded groves.
Together they wander beyond the realm of reason, in quietude ascending the eastern peaks.
Commanding the carriage to the broad **Duān** heights, transcending mortal shores to the land of darkness.
In the void, there are forms—yet within them, no permanence.
Awakening to the boundless speech of existence and nonexistence, they gather at the **Hutao Bridge**.
With eyes, they behold the **Mysterious Sage**—ghosts and spirits forget their own essence.

**Mysterious Sage** remarks: *"In the Wei dynasty, there was a man named Xīnpí, styled Zuòzhì, who was his seventh descendant. During the Han dynasty’s *Jiànwǔ* era (2nd year), he migrated from Lóngxī to settle in Yǐngchuān’s Yángzhài County. Xīnpí served in the Wei court as the General Who Bears the Imperial Edict, Grand Marshal, and Marshal of the Army, holding the title of Marquis of Wèiwèi. His son, named Chǎng, became Governor of Hénèi and Minister of the Imperial Sacrifices.*

**Mysterious Sage** remarks: *"The Regulus, this is Jin’s Regulus the Grand General. The Northern Emperor once appointed him as the Pacifying General of the East, later ennobling him as Marquis of Dōnghǎi. Now he serves as the Morning Attendant of the **Duān** Court, akin to a modern-day Grand Chamberlain. The Right Imperial Censor is the **Right General of the Imperial Guard**, a position of great weight. The Left Imperial Censor is Xiè Yòuyú, appointed as the Marshal of the **Duān** Mountains. The **Prince of Nánchāng**, once the Southern Zhūyáng Gatekeeper and Spirit Gate Marquis under the Northern Emperor, later became the **High Clarity’s Censor**, but was once demoted for a dispute with Liú Qìng’s grandson—now he is to resume his duties. The **High Clarity’s Censor** is akin to the **Chancellor of State** in the mortal world.

Hé Cìdào now resides in the Southern Palace’s **Xínghuá Terrace**, having already received the scriptures, now journeying toward the Southern Peak. This man, in life, performed many benevolent deeds, thus attaining early transcendence.

Zhōu Bó-rén has recently been appointed as the **Central Protector of Xīmíng**, a role akin to the **Grand Tutor** of the mortal world. Due to an unfair selection of Dèng Yòu, he was demoted to **Central Guardian**, equivalent to a **Minor Tutor**. The above are the words of **Mysterious Sage**—the affairs of the netherworld are many, and here I record but a fragment, omitting further details.

**Master Péi** recounts that within a year, the seventh rank of transcendent beings was attained."*

The **Hé Mountain** has practitioners of the Dao, **Dèng Bǔyuán** and **Wáng Xuānfǔ**, who ingested **qīngjīng stone** and followed the method of swallowing **sun-essence elixirs**. Through thirty-four years of concentrated meditation in the **Dòngfáng Chamber**, they attained inner vision of the **Five Viscera**. On the fifth day of the fifth month this year, the **Grand Sovereign** dispatched a **feathered chariot** to welcome them. On that very day, they ascended to the heavens on **clouds and dragons**, now residing at the **Northern Mystic Enclosure Terrace**, where they received scriptures and were granted the rank of **Middle True Person**.

In the **Huáyáng Mountains**, practitioners of the Dao—**Yín Qiánzǐ**, **Zhāng Shígēng**, and **Lǐ Fānghuí**—all from the **Jìn Wǔdì** era, ingested **elixirs** from **Guǎnchéngzi the Immortal** using **steamed wood methods**, extending their years and vitality. Later, they received **Sūmén Zhōu Shòulíng’s** teachings on **elixirs of the Red Clouds**, devoting fifty years to inner contemplation without food, their bodies light and youthful in appearance. On the twelfth day of the second month this year, **Tàiyī** dispatched a welcome, and on that day, they ascended on clouds to the heavens, now at **Mystic State** as **High Immortals**—**Shígēng** as **East Source Marquis**.

In **Héngshān**, **Zhāng Lǐzhèng** and **Lǐ Míngqī** practiced the Dao. **Lǐzhèng**, from the late **Hàn Dynasty**, consumed **huángjīng** in the mountains, maintaining vigor like a man of forty. **Míngqī**, from the late **Wèi Dynasty**, ingested **ze-xié wúshí pills**, then together retreated to a cave. Later, they received **Xīchéngjūn’s** **Rainbow Divine Elixir**, consuming it for forty-three years. Stricken by elixir difficulties, they fled to **Guǎngzhōu** as travelers during **Téng Hán’s** governorship. Their inner and outer vision became clear, their eyes sharp and bodies light—traveling five hundred *lǐ* in a day, also practicing **guarding the One** for thirty years. On the first day of the third month, **Dōnghuá** dispatched a welcome, and on that day, they ascended on clouds to the heavens, now residing in the **Fāngzhū Biāoshì Chamber** as **Supreme Immortals**.

In **Lu Jiāng’s** **Qiánshān**, **Zhèng Jǐngshì** and **Zhāng Zhònghuá** received **Mèng Dérán’s** oral teachings at the start of the **Jìn Dynasty**, practicing **Five Viscera Containment** and **Sun-Essence Cultivation**, along with **húmá** (hemp) and **mystic elixirs**, eventually abandoning food entirely. Their bodies grew light and strong, reversing their aging. On the nineteenth day of the fourth month this year, **Northern Mystic Tàiyī** welcomed them in a **cloud palanquin**, ascending in broad daylight to **Mystic State**.

In **Kuòcāngshān**, **Píng Zhòngjié**, a native of **Héngdōng**, fled to the mountains during the **Great Hu** chaos, studying **Sòng Jūn’s** **Mirror of the Heart** methods, mastering **hundred deities**, and practicing **Dòngfáng Chamber** techniques for forty-five years. His body grew refined, his **true qi** manifest. On the first day of the fifth month this year, **Central Yellow Old Tàiyī** dispatched a welcome, and on that day, he ascended on **clouds and dragons** to the heavens, now at the **Cānglàng Cloud Terrace**.

In **Jiǎn Shàobái Mountain**, **Zhào Guāngxìn**, from **Yángchéng**, entered the mountains at the end of the **Wèi Dynasty**, receiving **Lǐ Fǎchéng’s** **qi-cultivation methods** and **Zuǒjūn’s** **Mystic Middle Dao**. Through eighteen years of inner vision of the **Five Viscera**, he wandered between prefectures, sometimes selling elixirs. Many came to the market to buy **dānshā** (cinnabar) for **Jiǔhuá Elixirs**, each dose complete. On the seventeenth day of the sixth month this year, **Tàiyī Dàojūn** dispatched a welcome, and after three days’ farewell with mountain companions, he ascended on **clouds and dragons** in broad daylight, now in the **Eastern Mystic Sea**.

In **Lángwǔ Mountain**, **Yú Wēngshēng**, from **Kuàijī**, received **Jièjūn’s** **Sun-Essence Diet** in the **Wú era**, hiding in these mountains while practicing **cloud-qi transformation**. Through long meditation, his form shrank like a child’s. On the twenty-third day of the seventh month this year, **Eastern Mystic Tàidì** dispatched a welcome, and on that day, he ascended on clouds to the heavens, now in **Tānggǔ Mountain**.

In **Chìshuǐ Mountain**, **Zhū Rùzǐ**, from the late **Wú era**, consumed **chrysanthemum blossoms** and **wood-based elixirs**, later encountering **Xīguīzǐ**, who granted him **transcendence**. **Xīguīzǐ** taught him **Essential Speech** and **Níwán Chamber** methods. After thirty years, he could summon **clouds and rain** in his chamber. On the fifth day of the eighth month this year, **Xī Wángmǔ** dispatched a welcome, and on that day, he ascended in a **five-colored cloud chariot** to the heavens, now in the **Jīshí Chamber**.

Among the **named mountains and Five Peaks**, hundreds of thousands practice the Dao, with many ascending yearly—names recorded separately. Each month, some depart; their numbers cannot be fully chronicled. Here, I merely record those who attained transcendence this year. Some, unwilling to ascend, remain indefinitely in the **Five Peaks and named mountains**, numbering countless thousands. Others serve as **immortal officials**, sealing and governing these mountains—also in the thousands.

This record was completed on the night of the twentieth day of the ninth month by **Qīnglíng Cù**.

**Dào Jì** of **Dōngqīng**, ranked eighth, later entered the **Wěiyǔ Mountain’s Stone Chamber**, the **Dàyǒu Palace**, where he received **stone-essence, golden-light, hidden-transformation methods** from **Xīlíngzǐ Dōu**. **Xīlíngzǐ Dōu** is a **Tàixuān Immortal Maiden**.

Those who studied with him at the same time and now reside in the **Dàyǒu Chamber** include:
- **Guǎngyù Bào Shùyáng** of **Guǎngyù**,
- **Tàiyuān Wáng Yǎngbó** of **Tàiyuān**,
- **Yǐngchuān Liú Wěihuì** of **Yǐngchuān**,
- **Dài Jùn Duàn Jìzhèng** of **Dài Jùn**,
all having received teachings from **Xīlíngzǐ Dōu**.

As **Jìzhǔ** prepared to depart, his form took the likeness of a **wù-jǐ** figure upon his pillow.

His tomb lies south of **Shēngpán Mountain** in **Chéngdū**, **Shǔ Jùn**. **Zhūgě Wǔhòu** once erected a stele with this inscription before his grave:

*"Mystic void, great stillness—
Yin and yang in harmony.
Heaven and earth in union—
Ten thousand things flourish."*

The Master’s teachings distinguished between yielding and firmness.
Ghosts and spirits observed, and the Six Perfections shone clearly.

**Guǎngyù Bào Shùyáng** was a high official of **Zhào Wáng** Zhāng Ěr and Zhāng Áo during the reign of **Hàn Gāodì**. In his youth, he took delight in cultivating life and consuming cassia bark, yet he died suddenly in laughter. His tomb now lies north of the mountains in **Liáo Jì City**.

**Tàiyuān Wáng Yǎngbó** served as a **Zhōngchángshì** during **Lǚ Hòu**’s regency in the **Hàn**. His younger brother, **Wáng Cǎi**, in his youth consumed *Zéxiè* (Alisma), and together with **Liúhóu** Zhāng Liáng, they gathered herbs in **Zhōngnán Shān**. Yet **Yǎngbó** did not return, and he became a disciple of **Jìzhǔ**. He later studied the **Rìyuè qì** (Solar-Lunar qi) and became an inner-chamber disciple, attaining the Dao. Upon his return to his homeland, he took the form of a staff and sandals, and his body perished beneath a mulberry tree. His tomb is now on the western mountains of **Rǔnán Ānchéng County**.

**Yǐngchuān Liú Wěihuì** was once **Gōngchē Shìmǎ** **Liú Fèng** during the reign of **Hàn Jǐngdì**. Later, he became a disciple of **Jìzhǔ**, and in his later years, he cultivated the **Rìyuè qì**, becoming an inner-chamber disciple who attained the Dao.

**Dài Jùn Duàn Jìzhèng** was originally a recluse, taking no medicines or elixirs. Only in his later years did he study with **Jìzhǔ**, and together they traversed **Qínchuān**, both achieving *shījiě* (embodied transcendence). They were buried by the riverbank, and today, this place is **Nánzhèng Qínchuān**.

**Jìzhǔ** had one son and one daughter, both of whom attained the Dao. His son was named **Fǎyù**, and his daughter, **Jìhuá**. They now reside in **Wěiyǔ Shān**.

**Jìhuá** today is still reciting the *Sānlìshíjiǔzhāng* (Thirty-Nine Chapters), yet she has not yet finished.

**Jìzhǔ** studied the *Yùjīng* (Jade Scripture), consumed the essence of the **Míngdān** (Luminous Elixir), and drew upon the radiance of dawn. Even now, his complexion is as youthful as a twenty-year-old maiden’s, his beard three *chǐ* long, and as black as ink.

Yesterday, **Dōngqīng Jūn** spoke of the Dao, recounting such matters as these—truly wondrous deeds! Yet I do not know their full meaning.

**Jìzhǔ**, taking the form of hidden light, concealed his traces in **Wěiyǔ**, as fully recorded in the *Zǐyáng Zhuàn*. Last night, **Dōngqīng** arrived and casually inquired about **Jìzhǔ**’s origins. **Dōngqīng** answered, and I have recorded his words here. I present them above, hoping you will not find fault. After reading, please consign them to the flames.

This was later memorialized by **Shèng Lǐ Jūn**, largely consistent with the foregoing. Yet **Dōngqīng** further added annotations numbering over ten thousand words—a truly extraordinary work.

Recently, we spoke much of divine transformations, and I mentioned **Jìzhǔ** in passing.

Last month, I was also granted the *Shénhǔ Jīng Jiězhù* (Commentary on the Tiger Spirit Scripture), a text unknown to the world, whose meaning I myself do not fully grasp. If I hear of matters like those of **Jìzhǔ**, I shall surely report them in secret.

The *Língxiān Jì* (Record of Numinous Traces) is now complete.
