**Account of Plum Immortal’s Deeds**

Plum Immortal, a native of Shouchun Prefecture in Henan, bore the name Fu and the style Zizhen. During the reign of Emperor Cheng of the Western Han, he was appointed magistrate of Nanchang County in Hongzhou. In office, he upheld purity and integrity, disdaining ostentation, and ever mindful of relieving the people’s burdens—never once resorting to the lash or cudgel.

At the time, Wang Mang usurped the imperial throne, while Wang Feng’s power grew unchecked. Omens of disaster multiplied, yet none among the court dared speak. Unable to bear the suffering of the realm’s people, Fu roused his loyal and righteous qi and submitted the *Memorial on Disasters and Portents* to expound on order and chaos.

The memorial read:

*"Your servant has heard that when Jizi feigned madness under the Shang, he later presented the* Hongfan *to the Zhou. Shusun Tong fled Qin to serve Han, where he devised rituals and regulations. Yet Shusun was no traitor, nor did Jizi forsake his kin to rebel—they simply could not speak freely. In former days, the High Ancestor heeded good counsel as if fearing delay, accepting remonstrance as readily as turning a millstone. He judged men not by their past but by their merit: Chen Ping, risen from outlawry, became chief strategist; Han Xin, plucked from the ranks, was named supreme general. Thus, the realm’s scholars flocked to Han, vying to offer their rarest insights. The wise exhausted their schemes, the dull their thoughts; the brave gave their all, the timid their lives. By uniting the realm’s wisdom and might, the High Ancestor overthrew Qin as lightly as plucking a feather and seized Chu as easily as gathering a lost item—this was how he became invincible.*

*Emperor Wen arose from the frontier, lacking the ministers of Zhou or the counselors Yi and Lü. Yet by following the High Ancestor’s ways and adding frugality and reverence, he nearly pacified the realm. From this, we see: adherence to the High Ancestor’s path brings order; deviation brings chaos. Why? The Qin, devoid of the Dao, erased Confucius’s traces and obliterated the Duke of Zhou’s institutions. They destroyed the well-field system, abolished the five ranks, and let ritual and music collapse, blocking the royal Way. Thus, none who sought to restore it could succeed.*

*Emperor Wu valued loyal remonstrance, rewarding forthright speech with rank. He did not wait for merit or favor to elevate men, so the realm’s commoners sharpened their resolve and exhausted their talents to serve the court. Petitioners thronged the streets in numbers beyond count. The Han’s flourishing of worthy men reached its peak under him. Had Emperor Wu heeded their counsel, supreme peace might have been achieved. Instead, corpses piled and bones lay exposed, as his heart delighted in distant conquests—spurring the rebellion of the Prince of Huainan. His plans failed and his schemes were leaked because the court’s assembled worthies left his ministers no room to dissent.*

*Now, commoners perceive the state’s vulnerabilities and rise upon hearing rumors—witness the uprising in Shu Commandery, or the bandit Su Ling of Shanyang, who trampled great cities and commanderies, seeking allies without fear of capture. All this stems from their contempt for high ministers and lack of awe for authority. When the state’s power wanes, even a commoner dares challenge the throne.*

*Scholars are the state’s treasures. Gain them, and the state grows weighty; lose them, and it grows light. As the* Book of Songs *says: ‘Abundant are the scholars, by whom King Wen found peace.’ Yet court deliberations are not matters for rustics like your servant to address. I fear my corpse may lie among the weeds and common soldiers, so I have repeatedly submitted memorials seeking an audience, only to be rebuffed each time.*

*I have heard that when a man presented the nine-times-nine multiplication table to Duke Huan of Qi, the duke did not dismiss him, hoping to attract greater talent. What I offer is no mere arithmetic. Your Majesty has rejected me thrice—this is why the realm’s scholars do not come. In former times, King Wu of Qin prized strength, yet Ren Bi’s feat of lifting the gate bar and Duke Mu of Qin’s hegemony through You Yu’s counsel show that to attract the realm’s scholars, one must act: when commoners submit memorials seeking audience, let them be sent to the Ministry of State. Question them on their proposals; if their words are worthy, grant them even a meager stipend or a bundle of silk. Then the realm’s scholars will vent their frustrations, voice loyal words, and offer fine strategies, which will daily reach Your Majesty’s ears. The realm’s systems and the state’s inner and outer workings will become clear as day.*

*With the vastness of the four seas and the multitude of scholars and people, those capable of speech are countless. Yet those who are truly outstanding—who can diagnose the age’s ills, craft words into enduring texts that align with the sages and suit the times—are few indeed. Thus, ranks, emoluments, and silk are the whetstones of the realm, by which the High Ancestor honed the dull and sharpened the blunt.*

*Confucius said: ‘A craftsman who wishes to do good work must first sharpen his tools.’ The Qin did otherwise. They forged a law against slander to ensnare the Han, wielding the sword Tai’e upside down and handing its hilt to Chu. Yet if one does not lose the hilt, even if the realm resists, none can blunt its edge—this was how Emperor Wu expanded the realm and built his legacy as the Han’s martial paragon.*

*Now, instead of following the hegemons’ path, you seek to employ the Three Dynasties’ methods of selecting scholars, as if examining Bo Le’s paintings to find a qilin in the marketplace—clearly impossible. Thus, the High Ancestor overlooked Chen Ping’s past to gain his strategies; Duke Wen of Jin summoned the Son of Heaven; Duke Huan of Qi employed Yi Ya, though it brought no immediate benefit. They disregarded propriety to seize opportunity—this is the hegemons’ Way.*

*When a single hue forms the whole, it is called pure; when black and white mingle, it is called motley. To govern the Qin’s violent legacy with the laws of a peaceful age is like using the village drinking ceremony to manage a military camp. Now, Your Majesty neither heeds the realm’s words nor merely rejects them—you punish them as well."*

When the osprey suffers harm, the benevolent crows scatter in flight; when fools are punished, the wise withdraw in silence. Of late, the ignorant commoners who submit memorials often violate laws of no urgent consequence, and many have been sent to the Minister of Justice to die. Since the Yangshuo era, the realm has treated speech as taboo, and the court most of all. All officials comply with the imperial will, none dare uphold what is right—how can this be demonstrated? Take the memorials the people submit, even those Your Majesty approves of, and submit them to the Minister of Justice. He will surely declare: *"This is improper speech, a grave act of disrespect."* Thus we see the proof.

Therefore, Wang Zhang, the Metropolitan Governor, was by nature loyal and upright, daring to confront the throne in open remonstrance. Emperor Xiaoyuan of Han promoted him to encourage forthright ministers and correct the court’s crooked ways. Yet under Your Majesty’s rule, his punishment extended even to his wife and children. Even if one’s hatred were great, it should have stopped at his person. Wang Zhang committed no crime of rebellion, yet calamity befell his family. This broke the resolve of upright scholars and sealed the tongues of remonstrating ministers. All officials know this is wrong, yet none dare dispute it. When the realm takes speech as a warning, it becomes the state’s greatest peril.

May Your Majesty follow the High Ancestor’s path, block the road to Qin’s ruin, and heed the songs of the tenth month—let them be a lesson. Abolish laws of no urgent consequence and issue an edict removing all taboos, widely seeking counsel. Consult even the lowly and distant, neither concealing nor rejecting those far removed—this is what is meant by *"opening the four gates and illuminating the four directions."* Moreover, laws of no urgent consequence are but the slightest form of slander. What is past cannot be recovered, but what lies ahead may yet be pursued.

Here the imperial mandate is violated and the sovereign’s authority usurped, while the power of the empress’s kin grows daily more exalted. Though Your Majesty may not perceive its form, I pray you discern its shadow. Since the Jianshi era, solar eclipses and earthquakes have tripled in frequency, while the Springs and Autumns record floods rising without number. Yin waxes strong and yang wanes; bronze and iron take flight—what shadow is this?

Since the founding of Han, the altars of state have thrice been imperiled: by the Lü, the Huo, and the Shangguan—all houses of the empress dowager. The Way of kinship holds preservation as its highest principle; one should appoint them worthy tutors and virtuous mentors, instructing them in the Dao of loyalty and filial piety. Yet now they are exalted in rank and entrusted with the reins of power, bred to arrogance and rebellion, until they are exterminated—this is the gravest failure of kinship.

Even the worthy Huo Guang could not secure his descendants; thus, when power passes to a new generation, ministers become perilous. The *Book of Documents* says: *"Do not let fire begin as a mere spark, lest its force overmaster the lord."* When power surpasses the sovereign’s, then to block it comes too late. It also states: *"I have heard that one not in office does not meddle in its governance."* Governance is a charge; for one of low station to speak of lofty matters is a crime. To overstep one’s charge and incur guilt, to utter perilous words though the age’s ills lie hidden and fate’s threads are tangled—this is my wish. To guard one’s charge and remain silent, to live out one’s days in bodily safety, to die and have one’s name perish before the corpse decays—even were I offered Duke Jing’s rank, a thousand chariots in submission, I would not covet it.

Thus I long to ascend the steps of carved stone, tread the vermilion path, sit in judgment at the court’s gate, and pour forth my lifelong folly. Though it may bring no benefit to the times, if it leaves some trace for the world, this is why my sleep is restless and my meals tasteless. I pray Your Majesty examine my words.

I have heard that to preserve others is to establish oneself, while to stifle others is to block one’s own path. The retribution of good and evil follows their deeds. Of old, Qin destroyed the Two Zhous and annihilated the Six States, leaving recluses unrecognized and hermits unraised. It severed the Three Sequences and extinguished the Heavenly Dao, and so its ruler perished, his son was slain, and his grandson left no heir—this was stifling others to block its own path.

Thus when King Wu conquered Yin, before descending from his chariot he preserved the descendants of the Five Emperors, enfeoffed Yin at Song, and continued Xia at Qi, making the Three Sequences manifest to show he did not hold them alone. Thus the Ji clan ruled half the realm, and the ancestral tablets of dethroned houses flowed out through the doors—this was preserving others to establish oneself. Now Cheng Tang is unvenerated, and the Yin people have no descendants; Your Majesty’s line has long been diminished, and this is likely the cause.

The *Spring and Autumn Annals* states: *"Song executed its grandee."* The *Guliang Commentary* notes that his name and lineage were not recorded because he held an ancestral position and was thus honored. This shows that Confucius, though not of the orthodox line, enfeoffed the descendants of Yin as its heirs. The rites should follow this precedent—why? When feudal lords usurp their clans, when the worthy and the base contest the succession, the *Commentary* says: *"The descendants of the worthy should hold land—how much more so the descendants of sages, and moreover those of Yin?"*

Of old, King Cheng buried the Duke of Zhou with the rites of a feudal lord, and august Heaven displayed its might with thunder and wind, revealing its displeasure. Yet now the temple of Confucius does not stand beyond the gates of Queli, and the descendants of the Kong clan, though sages, are not spared the status of commoners, offering sacrifices as mere common folk—this is not the will of august Heaven. If Your Majesty could truly honor Confucius’s enduring merit by enfeoffing his descendants, the state would surely reap its blessings.

Moreover, Your Majesty’s name would be boundless as Heaven—why? To honor a sage’s enduring merit by enfeoffing his descendants is without precedent. Future sages will surely take this as their model; can an undying name not be pursued? The emperor did not respond, and so he harbored thoughts of retreat.

Alas! The saying goes: *"When a minister remonstrates two or three times and is not heeded, he should flee."* Was this empty words? He removed his robes, hung his cap at the capital’s eastern gate, resigned his office, abandoned his wife and children, and departed for Jiujiang. Fearing the empress’s kin would seize him, he changed his name and became a gatekeeper in Wu. Later, he sought teachers and pursued the Dao, wandering mountains and valleys in search of herbs. Once, he joined Zhang Liang’s descendant, Lord Zifang, holding a tablet and chanting the *"Song of No-Birth"* to delight his heart.

He visited the Yaodang Mountains—south of Kuaiji—and traveled to southern Min, entering Zhiti Mountain to cultivate himself for years without success. When a nun disturbed him, he exclaimed in frustration: *"The elixir of nine refinements grows purer with time—why begrudge the lateness of its perfection?"* He then entered Xianxia Mountain, east of Wuyi. Wandering where no man dwelt, roaming beyond the dust of the world, he heard apes cry in ancient trees and tigers roar in secluded crags. There were bamboos called *"Slender Waist"* and herbs named *"Yellow Sprout,"* rare shoots and strange plants too numerous to know. He built a hut by the cliffs, steadfast in resolve, fasting and eating pine nuts, aspiring to the immortals’ arts, accumulating years in this pursuit.

Often gazing toward Min and Yue, he saw a strange purple vapor and returned to Jiancheng to establish an altar and refine his practice. Before long, one day the mountains were veiled in mist, rosy clouds filled the chamber, auspicious vapors floated in the air, and purple mists shrouded the peak. Heavenly music resounded, and a divine voice declared: *"The Cavernous Immortal Lord approaches."* Soon the immortal music drew near, and the Immortal Lord descended. He bowed in welcome, and the Immortal Lord said: *"Moved by your steadfast resolve in seeking the Dao, I have descended to grant you the method of external refinement and internal cultivation, the Great Elixir of Return, and the *Nine Elders’ Writ of the Immortal Capital for Saving the World*. Choose a sacred mountain and cultivate according to this method, and you will attain immortality."* When he finished speaking, Mei bowed in gratitude. The colored clouds dispersed, the heavenly music faded, and the Immortal Lord vanished into the distance.

Mei studied the celestial patterns and numbers, descended the mountain, and practiced the arts of saving the world—all proved efficacious.

At first, he arrived at Parrot Cage Mountain to cultivate, but was plagued by corpse-demons and malevolent spirits. Next, he came to Mao Bamboo Grotto, where in a nighttime dream a divine being said: *"This mountain is not the place for your cultivation."* He then entered Perfected Immortal Mountain to cultivate, only to have his retreat burned by wildfire. Proceeding to Jade Flower Mountain to cultivate, he found that immortals had once dwelt there, but just as he began his practice, bandits arose on all sides due to drought. He next went to Black Stone Mountain to cultivate, where he was disturbed by a woodcutter’s wife.

Mei sighed and said: *"My karmic affinity with the Dao is shallow and vast, while obstacles and demons arise in throngs."* He then resumed his arts of saving the world for several years, until he reached the western ridge of Sword River to cultivate. One day, auspicious clouds and propitious qi gathered over the mountain’s peak. Opening his chamber to look, he saw his Dao-master, the Cavernous Immortal Lord, descending. Mei bowed in welcome and addressed his master: *"Your disciple has reverently followed your instructions, widely practicing the arts of saving the world and traveling through famous mountains to cultivate, yet I have suffered many demonic afflictions and have only now arrived here."*

The Dao-master said: *"Your karmic affinity with the Dao lies at Flying Swan Mountain. I now grant you the Eight Spirit Demon-Repelling Elixir."* He then summoned two Radiant Lads, who led a crimson steed and a white horse before the mountain. *"Hasten to mount the horse and lead the lads to Flying Swan Mountain for dedicated cultivation. On the day of your success, I shall raise you up, that your bones and form may ascend together."*

When he finished speaking, the Dao-master vanished into the clouds. Mei then mounted the horse and led the lads to Flying Swan Mountain, where he established a hermitage to cultivate. After a thousand days, his spirit wandered beyond his body, and the radiance of his elixir illuminated the heavens—his Dao was accomplished. He then opened the furnace and took out the elixir: one pellet he offered to Heaven, and the celestial spirits received it; one pellet he offered to Earth, and the earth spirits guarded it; one pellet he consumed himself. After ingesting it, he bowed in thanks to Heaven and Earth. The earth spirits reported to the Three Officials, who in turn memorialized the Heavenly Palace, announcing that Mei Fu of the Western Han had attained the Dao on Flying Swan Mountain.

Mei then mounted his white horse and led the lads, intending to return to Jiujiang. The two lads clapped their hands before the horse and chanted a poem, then concealed themselves beneath a massive boulder by the mountain stream. In an instant, a red glow shot toward the sun, purple mist suffused the sky, sweet dew and heavenly flowers descended all at once. From the clouds, immortal music resounded, golden lads bearing tablets and jade maidens holding sashes appeared, while mighty immortals drove phoenix chariots and attendants bore the imperial edict. They addressed Mei: *"The Heavenly Palace has issued a decree, commanding you to mount the phoenix and ascend."*

Mei bowed in gratitude for the celestial grace, abandoned his horse to mount the phoenix, and ascended into the heavens. The white horse fell into the waters below. Thereafter, Flying Swan Mountain was called Plum Immortal Mountain. To its west lay the Sinking Horse Shoals; thirty *li* away stood the Whip-Dropping Cao Mountain; below the mountain was the Ascent-to-Immortality Hamlet. To the east of the mountain’s stream were the Runaway Lad Stone and the Glue-Horse Waves. Beside the mountain was the Sweet Dew Spring; behind it, the Heavenly Flower Ridge, where flower traces remained on the stones. The locals thereafter called it Ridge Stone Ridge.

To this day, the elixir’s radiance lingers hidden at the mountain’s root. There stands the Plum Contemplating Dao Abbey, where incense and offerings are reverently maintained. Later, Buddhist monks occupied it as their dwelling, discarded the immortal statues to sculpt Buddha images, and renamed it Guanyin Abbey, moving the statue of Plum Immortal into the Founder’s Hall. The people of the prefecture, however, continued to call it Plum Immortal Abbey, ignoring the new name. Within the abbey, the Five Guardian Saints manifested their numinous power and established a temple beside it, which people simply called the Lord Mei Temple. Lord Mei’s name and the traces of his immortality remain sacred.

From the Han to the present, twenty-two *bingyin* years have passed. From the Yuan Shi era to the present, in the second year of the Zhenyuan reign, the *bingshen* year, one thousand two hundred and fifty-nine years have elapsed without fading. At the time, this account followed the transmission of the Plum Immortal Hall in Jianning Prefecture, where the Plum Mountain Elixir-Refining Site was located—hence its inclusion.

**Stele Inscription: The Stele of Master Mei**

**Composed by Luo Yin, Tang Dynasty Inspector of the Eastern Circuit of Zhejiang, Concurrently Supervisor of the Ministry of Revenue and Palace Censor-in-Chief, Bestowed with the Purple Gold Fish Bag**

During the reign of Emperor Cheng of Han, when the governance of the realm had fallen into decay, Master Mei repeatedly submitted memorials to admonish the Son of Heaven. The fire of governance demanded extinguishing, yet those who inquired after the vigor of swords and boots still numbered in the hundreds—yet they could not muster the strength to sever the heads of treacherous ministers for the state. How much less could the former subordinates of Nanchang, seething in their lowly stations below, achieve? Was it not because Nanchang was a distant land, and its constables mere petty officials? Had they but brushed against the imperial net or provoked the fangs of favored courtiers, they would have succeeded only in hastening the ruin of a madman and the annihilation of a single clan.

As for the high ministers and great officials—those entrusted with the power over life and death, joy and wrath, and burdened with the weight of cliques and transgressions—when they spoke a word or undertook a deed, they first consulted their wives and children. If it displeased their household, even the lowliest concubine or maidservant would obstruct and restrain them, let alone their relatives or kin. Thus, though they might harbor concern for the altars of soil and grain, they sealed their lips and uttered nothing.

Alas! Those who are shamed by favor and emolument, who occupy high office, yet dare not speak of court affairs—this is why, when the realm follows the Dao, upright men hold high positions, and when the realm strays from the Dao, upright men are cast down.

Reading Master Mei’s writings, I have never failed to lament for the Han court. Now, on my southern journey, I pass once more through the Master’s homeland—how abundant is the Dao here! I inscribe this on the reverse of the Stele of Master Mei.

**Inscribed by Ming Fengshan of Dashan in Xiaoshan**

The Daoist Abbey of Plum Immortal Mountain in Fengcheng possesses the Stele of Master Mei, composed by the Tang poet Luo Yin. Recently, upon revisiting the stele, I found it accompanied by an inscription. The Daoist Xiong Yingxiang exerted himself to renovate it, and the stele was re-erected. My friend Luo Yongzhi came and entrusted me with this inscription.

Pondering this, I ask: You, Zhaojian’s distant descendant, have so diligently preserved the calligraphy of former scholars and men of letters—why then do you still dwell upon the affairs of Han, sighing in lament?

Alas! When Heaven willed the downfall of Han’s realm, it first raised up a single boundary of worthy men. Yet Han spurned Heaven’s blessing, and thus spurned the blessing of men—abandoning both, it brought ruin upon itself. Though bronze and iron clashed in flight, what could Heaven do for Han? Though an aged phoenix turned monstrous, what could Han do to resist Xin’s usurpation?

Alas! To lose the worthy is to perish; to gain the worthy is to endure. Survival comes through heeding remonstrance; ruin comes through indulging flattery. How majestic the integrity—piercing heaven and earth! Compared to such men, we are but mud and dust; beside them, we are buried in humble graves.

When he left his seat to depart from Han, he concealed himself at the market gate of Hao; when he set his tracks upon the immortal’s path, he poured out his grievances before the Celestial Threshold. The House of Liu faded into obscurity, leaving no trace in the vast sky; the legacy of Mei endures forever, honored in shrines far and wide. Though the shrine’s stele may crumble to ash, the immortal’s Dao cannot be buried. Now, with fresh carving on green jade, its words may once more be read and traced by hand.

If Zhaojian’s spirit yet lingers, may it awaken like ice-clear soul. If Master Mei yet lives, may sun and moon remain undimmed.

Inscribed in the sixth month of the first day of the *gengwu* year of the Xianchun reign [1270].

**Inscribed on the reverse of the Stele of Master Mei by Xiaoshan Huang Tailai**

Reading the Stele of Zhaojian, one not only grasps the Master’s heart but also feels his *qi* grow stronger. Today, Plum Altars exist wherever his name is revered, and his shrines multiply in honor of the man. As Su Changong once said: “The spirit pervades the world like water in the earth—is there any place it does not reach?”

**Official Document of the Ministry of Rites, Song Dynasty**

The Ministry of State Affairs petitions the Ministry of Rites regarding the document forwarded by the Ministry’s Bureau of Sacrifices: According to a report from the Court of Imperial Sacrifices, and in accordance with the memorial submitted by Zhen’nanjun, an investigation by Fengcheng County confirms that the Plum Immortal’s Altar Daoist Abbey in Nanqi Village, Xuanfeng Township, has been the site of annual state sacrifices for generations. Whenever floods or droughts afflict the people, their prayers here are invariably answered with efficacy. The matter has been verified and recorded by the prefectural authorities.

Previously, Daoist Yang Zhiyuan of the Plum Immortal’s Altar Abbey submitted a report stating that the abbey originally stood upon the former dwelling of Mei Fu of the Han dynasty. The ancient altar, cinnabar well, and hermitage foundations remain extant, and the abbey itself was first established in the Han era. Its name has long been enshrined in canonical sacrifices, and he now petitions that the throne bestow upon it the honorific title of *Zhenjun*.

The prefectural authorities, having reviewed the foregoing submission, note that Mei Fu’s towering integrity and loyal remonstrances are recorded in the historical annals for all to see. In his later years, he fled the usurper Wang Mang, abandoning wife and children to vanish into the marketplace of Wu, where he preserved his nature in obscurity. The world has since transmitted his story as that of an immortal, and his legacy endures in the very site of his retreat. The abbey stands in solemn order, and in times of flood, drought, or pestilence, prayers offered here are met with swift response. It is humbly hoped that a special honorific title may be conferred to accord with the distant people’s gratitude and devotion.

The prefecture has hitherto addressed the site only as “Master Mei the Realized One.” This Court, having deliberated, proposes that the Han dynasty’s Mei Fu the Realized One be granted an additional enfeoffment, pending imperial instruction.

This Bureau now submits the report of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices for the imperial decision.

*Enfeoffment granted in the Yuanfeng reign [1078–1085].*

By imperial decree:

During the Han dynasty, Mei Fu repeatedly voiced solitary yet far-reaching admonitions on the affairs of the realm—how resolute was his spirit! In later years, he retired to his home, devoting himself to study and the cultivation of his nature, ultimately transcending worldly custom in lofty withdrawal. The world has since transmitted his story as that of an immortal. To this day, west of the Great River, his temple image and shrine remain, where prayers are met with swift response, bringing blessings to our people. The local authorities having reported this, We now bestow this illustrious title to honor his enduring spiritual power. We deem it fitting to specially enfeoff him as the Realized One of Shouchun.

This decree is hereby issued for implementation.

*Fifth year of the Yuanfeng reign, seventh month.*

---

The Ministry of Rites has examined the recent submission from the Secretariat-Chancellery, which forwarded the imperial rescript from Zhen’nanjun concerning Fengcheng County’s Mei Immortal Abbey. The rescript commands the enfeoffment of Mei Fu of the Han as the Realized One of Shouchun. The decree is to be entrusted to the abbey for safekeeping, and an official shall be dispatched to conduct a solemn sacrificial rite and install the inscribed plaque. The local authorities have reported compliance and custody of the decree. However, though the rescript was submitted to the Secretariat-Chancellery long ago, no reply has been received. It is now ordered that the authorities of Zhen’nanjun be urgently pressed to expedite the matter in accordance with the rescript’s directives, ensuring prompt execution without delay.

*Fifth year of the Yuanfeng reign, eighth month, tenth day.*

---

On the twenty-third day of the eighth month of the fifth year of the Yuanfeng reign, Hongzhou received a decree from the Court of Imperial Sacrifices, dated the twenty-ninth day of the seventh month, in accordance with a directive from the Ministry of Rites. The directive followed an imperial rescript, dated the eighteenth day of the seventh month, sent down by the Secretariat-Chancellery, which transmitted a memorial from the Bureau of Sacrifices. The memorial, based on a report from the Court of Imperial Sacrifices, cited a petition from Zhen’nanjun, which in turn referenced an investigation by Fengcheng County into the Mei Immortal Altar Abbey at Nanqi Village in Xuanfeng. The abbey has long been the site of annual state sacrifices, and in times of flood or drought, the people’s prayers have invariably been answered. The facts were verified by the local authorities.

Previously, the Daoist Yang Zhiyuan of Shousheng Mei Immortal Abbey petitioned that the abbey, originally the retreat of Mei Fu of the Han, preserves ancient relics—an altar, cinnabar well, and hermitage foundations—with its structures dating to the Han dynasty. Its renown endures in canonical sacrifices. He requested that the throne be memorialized to grant the title of Realized One. The local authorities, having reviewed the petition, noted Mei Fu’s towering integrity and loyal remonstrance, recorded in the historical annals for posterity. In his later years, he fled the usurper Wang Mang, abandoning his wife and children, departing from Jiujiang, and preserving his nature in reclusion. The world has since transmitted his story as that of an immortal. His legacy endures in the very site of his retreat, where the abbey stands in solemn order, and prayers in times of flood, drought, or pestilence are met with swift response. It is humbly hoped that a special honorific title may be conferred to accord with the distant people’s gratitude and devotion. The prefecture has hitherto addressed the site only as “Master Mei the Realized One.” This Court, having deliberated, proposes that Mei Fu the Realized One of the Han be granted an additional enfeoffment, pending imperial instruction.

The Court of Imperial Sacrifices now submits the report for the imperial decision. On the fourteenth day of this month, We issued the following decree: “Let all matters proceed in accordance with precedent.” The decree, as recorded, was transmitted to the Ministry of Rites on the eighteenth day of the seventh month at the hour of *wei*.

In accordance with the imperial decree, the Ministry of Rites is to ensure all relevant offices execute the directive without delay. Upon receipt of this decree, let the details be reviewed and implemented as commanded.

During the Han dynasty, Mei Fu repeatedly voiced solitary yet far-reaching admonitions on the affairs of the realm—how resolute was his spirit! In later years, he retired to his home, devoting himself to study and the cultivation of his nature, ultimately transcending worldly custom in lofty withdrawal. The world has since transmitted his story as that of an immortal. To this day, west of the Great River, his temple image remains, where prayers are met with swift response, bringing blessings to our people. The local authorities having reported this, We now bestow this illustrious title to honor his enduring spiritual power. We deem it fitting to specially enfeoff him as the Realized One of Shouchun.

*Ninth month of the fifth year of the Yuanfeng reign.*

---

In accordance with the Ministry of Rites’ directive and imperial rescript, an official shall be dispatched to Fengcheng County’s Shousheng Mei Immortal Altar Abbey to conduct a solemn sacrificial rite, proclaim the enfeoffment of the Realized One of Shouchun, and install the inscribed plaque. The decree is to be entrusted to the abbey for safekeeping. The local authorities are to report compliance to the Secretariat-Chancellery.

The plaque, inscribed with gilded characters, was commissioned by the prefectural authorities and completed on the nineteenth day of this month. It has been entrusted to the abbey’s Daoist and the dispatched official, along with the sacrificial text.

The magistrate of Fengcheng County, Officer Zhang, is hereby instructed to proceed to the abbey upon receipt of this directive, conduct the solemn sacrificial rite, and install the plaque as commanded. A report of compliance shall be submitted to the prefecture.

*Ninth day of the tenth month of the fifth year of the Yuanfeng reign.*

Decree:

On Our recent southern progress, with Yuzhang as the eastern boundary, We accompanied the Empress Dowager and the palace retinue by boat, braving the perils of wind and wave. At every place We passed, divine protection was manifest. In gratitude for these blessings, We now confer honors to reciprocate the deities’ favor.

The Realized One of Shouchun at the Mei Fu Ascension Altar Abbey on the north bank of the Great River in Fengcheng, Hongzhou—his forthright remonstrance unheeded, his lofty name alone endured. Moved by the Han dynasty’s decline, he departed for Wushi and never returned. His shrine now stands in solemn dignity, and We have already bestowed a title upon him. To further enhance his honor, We now augment his designation with a new grace, deepening Our exceptional regard and honoring his lifelong devotion. Let him be specially enfeoffed as the Recluse-Realized One of Shouchun.

This decree is hereby issued for implementation.

*Eighteenth day of the intercalary fourth month of the second year of the Shaosheng reign.*

*Eulogy.*

**Eulogy for Master Mei**

Master Mei, the Perfected One, once served as a minor official in Nanchang. He sought leave to present a memorial, bearing his early writings in a sack. He admonished the world on governance, steeling his resolve and exhausting his essence. His noble aspirations were thwarted in Qin, yet his censure of the phoenix spread his renown. It was said that when the sun’s light waned, he lost his rightful place—how true this proved. Many scholars are the state’s treasures, and when worthies gather at court, men grow envious and wary. How then to summon them? The Dao lies in mutual refinement.

The magpie met harm, while the benevolent crow soared away. Do not seek a steed by studying its likeness in the marketplace. Thus, I recount the lineage of Confucius, that later generations may emulate Cheng Tang. To honor virtue and exalt the worthy rests with Us. From the phoenix’s reign to Wang Mang’s usurpation, the Han’s guiding ropes unraveled. Prevention came too late—My words bear witness. Resolved to journey afar, he rode the clouds to the Emperor’s realm.

**Inscribed at Mei the Immortal’s Abbey**
*Meng, Water Bureau Attendant of Bin*

The immortal’s path stretches distant, clouds wisp-thin;
The ancient altar’s wind sighs through rustling leaves.
How could later men speak of lingering long?
A single constable ascended—his Dao supreme.

**Former Residence of Master Mei**
*Huang, Grand Scribe Tingjian*

Had he not served as Nanchang’s constable,
His memorials submitted, he would have returned to an empty court and market.
Laughing, he brushed the cliffside blossoms, asking of the dusty world:
“Is your old friend now the state’s preceptor?”

**Sent to Daoist Master Yang of Mei the Immortal’s Abbey**
*Su, Yellow Gate Attendant Zhe*

The Daoist master dwells on Perfected One Peak,
Yet when I seek him, no path remains.
Last year, he promised to enter the city,
But dust darkened the skies, and he never arrived.

Do not come, do not go—you weary my heart.
Instead, you send me Daoist scriptures worth a thousand gold pieces.
Clad in fine robes, sated with meat, my schemes are shallow;
Texts pile before me, yet I see nothing.

Oral teachings and direct instruction come in their time—
Cast off the net, and you shall be known.
Mei the Elder, Han’s constable of Nanchang,
Stroked the dragon’s scales to speak of worldly affairs.

One morning, he brushed his robes and departed, never to return,
Riding a white qilin, veiled by red simurghs.
Though I now wallow in the dust of the world,
Why does the Daoist master not speak to me?

One day, when my glory is complete, I shall retreat to a famous mountain,
And when we meet, we’ll clap hands and break into smiles.

*Yang Cigong Jie*

The hearts of all under heaven cherish utmost loyalty;
Heaven’s heart, too, aligns with the people’s.
Once he grew wings and ascended to the Three Clarities,
Not solely through ninefold-cycled cinnabar.

In the Han, he changed his name and wandered Yue;
The Daoists left his image to Xiao Gong.
The stone altar marks where he ascended—
An old crane’s cry, the wind in the pines and cypresses.

*Hong Guifu Peng*

The fiery spirit of the sovereign waned,
And the Four Seas knew no peace.
Alas, Mei of Nanchang,
Cast off his sandals in the first year of his era.

A minor official, he bared his liver and gall,
Yet palace affairs were shrouded in secrecy.
His memorial vanished into obscurity,
Discarded beyond rivers and lakes.

One morning, weary of the snail’s-horn strife,
He entrusted his fate to the roc’s back.
In times past, on bamboo slips,
His deeds shone unmatched.

Now, in the Jasper Pool’s realm,
Phoenixes and kingfishers soar through wind and dew.
Gazing up at the divine realm’s wanderings,
For a thousand years, I imagine his living qi.

I wish to cling to the dragon’s scales,
Not shed my body like a cicada’s husk.

**Inscribed at Mount Mei**
*Chen Chan*

The master, a recluse-official in Nanchang,
Traveled a thousand li to seek a realm beyond things.
Drawing water, he pitied the spring well’s dry lips;
Hiding elixirs, the night altar still gleamed.

The crane returned to the decorated pillar—where is its master?
The dog barked in deep clouds, the days lengthened.
I intend to return and trace his vestiges,
Staff in hand, to wander awhile.

**Inscribed at Mei the Immortal’s Abbey**
*Zhu Lingcui*

His memorials cast before the northern gate were blindly ignored;
A recluse-official in Nanchang, he lodged this question here.
His body soared through the nine skies to the Purple Palace;
His name endures through the ages, entrusted to green mountains.

Who now gazes upon the starry altar at night?
At dawn, mist and clouds drift to and fro.
The high peaks, seldom trod by men,
Reveal a true realm apart from the mortal world.

---

**Praying for Rain at Mei’s Altar, Yimao Year**
*Yan Lingzhuangling*

The great recluse’s pure name matched the Emperor’s will;
The Perfected One’s new favor was gathered in the royal words.
Though Nanchang’s constable was a minor post,
His Dao, linked to the Northern Culmen, grew more exalted.

His remonstrances could not save the crumbling Han court;
His immortal’s mien briefly graced Wu Gate.
I come to seek the place of morning audience—
The mountain defies the starry altar, the waters reject my staff.

---

**Inscribed at Mei’s Altar**
*Lü Fang, Prefect of Linchuan*

His memorials hung unheeded—then he doffed his cap.
Blue mists and ancient trees seal the empty altar.
Had they known then he was a guest of Penglai,
They would not have seen him as merely Nanchang’s constable.

*(Excerpt from a longer poem)*

I once read Master Zizhen’s biography,
And closed the scroll with repeated sighs.
How could such loyal and upright talent
Have appeared in the Yuan and Cheng eras?

His perilous words addressed the times’ governance,
His proposals thorough, tracing roots to sources.
His unyielding integrity shattered the traitors’ gall,
His indignant spirit shook the Confucian’s cap.

His memorials were repeatedly rejected.
Nine nines aligned with the maple’s leaves.
At that time, the court’s ministers
Universally lacked thick skins.

His brilliant writings gleam in the annals,
Enduring as the stars and sun.
He probed the mechanisms, foreseeing disaster,
Then brushed his robes and left—nine rivers, a thousand li.

He abandoned wife and children in one stroke,
Changed his name, and embraced Wu Pass.
To speak truth while holding high office—
Since ancient times, this has been most difficult.

This man preserved himself—
How arduous his path of withdrawal and engagement!
Fan Zi briefly held a post,
And drove his carriage to the immortal’s altar.

Beside the altar, a thousand-zhang pine,
Its icy branches cleansed by returning winds.
From Shouchun came new melodies,
His lofty steps treading jasper and jade.

The walls bear Luo Yin’s inscriptions,
Their principles profound and worthy of contemplation.
In those years, Lord Kangle
Traveled to renowned mountains.

Why then has this fine site
Not been recorded in metal or stone?
The flying simurgh...

*Ma Neihan Zicai*

The Han’s guiding ropes slackened,
And the state’s fate shifted to powerful ministers.
The divine edge of Grand Marshal’s sword
Was inverted, its hilt in others’ hands.

Courtiers crowded the hall,
Each swallowing their words.
Zhang Yu, the Emperor’s tutor,
Was the root of this chaos.

The Son of Heaven’s attendants
Decided matters with a single word.
Not for the altars’ sake,
But to beg for a child’s favor.

The sword meant to slay horses
Failed even Zhu Yun.
Gu Yong’s forthright counsel
Was met with ominous portents at court.

Dark schemes aided the chief villain,
Blame cast upon Zhao Yang’s consort.
From then on, jackals and wolves roamed free,
Strutting in broad daylight.

At that time, the Master
Knocked upon the imperial gates with memorials.
His loyalty burned bright as maple’s vexing flames,
As radiant as stars and constellations.

The nine-fold gates of heaven were locked,
A single gate garrisoned by ten thousand men.
A minor official with a heart for rivers and lakes—
How could his words reach the Son of Heaven?

The traitor Wang Mang indeed usurped the state,
While the loyal and upright met burning and boiling.
The Master changed his surname,
Became a soldier at Wu Market’s gate.

Floating clouds left no trace,
The world willingly called him immortal.
Where lies Penglai Mountain?
Let such matters rest unspoken.

Yet he loved the lofty, pure wind,
Its chill majesty ever renewed.
I come to bow before his portrait,
His old abode’s foundations still standing.

In the Yuanfeng era, a new dawn arose,
The jade registers sealed Shouchun’s blessings.
The ancient pines grow ever more vigorous,
Their trunks bearing the marks of frost’s yearly toll.

Straight to the summit altar I ascend,
Heaven’s wind whips my robes and headscarf.
Carefully reading the inscriptions on the walls,
I delight in Luo Yin’s writings.

Some regretful, blunt words
Stir my spirit to greater heights.
Looking back at those sated with ease,
They seem as fleeting as dust.

**Inscribed at Mei Altar**
*Jiang Zhiqi, Imperial Censor*

Once I served in Jiangxi,
Visiting every sacred trace in Yuzhang.
How could I bear this lingering regret—
That I alone had not come to Mei Immortal’s Altar?

Mei Immortal’s Altar lies in Fengcheng’s bounds,
Where true wind and refreshing qi dwell beyond the world’s dust.
In those years, he served as deputy magistrate in Nanchang,
His talent renowned, though his rank remained modest.

When the Han’s Cheng Emperor saw the state’s discipline crumble,
The Master submitted his remonstrance again and again.
Earlier, Wang Zhang had been promoted to correct the court’s crooked ways,
But his execution—wife and children, allies and kin—brought vengeful satisfaction.

Guilty ministers dared not protest,
And so the realm took his words as warning.
Alas, such speech was perilous indeed!
How fiercely he rebuked the powerful and strong.

Had he merely grazed a favored courtier’s fangs,
A single setback would not have been ruinous.
Yet high ministers and nobles held their tongues,
Pursuing private schemes—no wonder.

The righteous below sighed in sorrow,
Changing his name, working in Wu Market—who knew?
In the Yuanfeng era, imperial decrees honored him,
His old hermitage and cinnabar well’s foundations preserved.

Shouchun’s Perfected One was granted a noble title,
Celebrating his lofty withdrawal from the vulgar world.
Though the Master met no favor in his time,
Today he is honored and commended.

The magistrate’s records praise his loyalty and integrity,
His hidden virtue and obscured brilliance shining boundlessly.

**Inscribed at Mei Mountain**
*Zhang Jingxian, Heavenly Master*

When he served as deputy in Nanchang,
He sent memorials to the northern palace time and again.
Loyal words failed to awaken the lord,
His unyielding integrity shamed him as a subject.

The Han court teemed with omens and calamities,
Yet Wu Gate longed for reclusion.
He hung up his cap, forgetting favor and disgrace,
Covering his face, he left the world’s dust behind.

The rainbow’s arc bent his heroic qi,
The gull’s drought left him at ease.
Ever mindful of the Three Caverns’ secrets,
He bid farewell to the springs of the Nine Rivers.

Choosing a place, he opened his immortal abode,
Gazing at clouds, he trimmed his longevity scarf.
On the dark terrace, he paced beneath autumn’s moon,
In the empty chamber, night congealed his true nature.

No dreams sprouted fragrant grasses,
He nurtured great vitality to extend his years.
Verdant moss exhaled unbroken fragrance,
The azure steed’s nature remained docile.

The Taiye elixir’s blade and mortar were complete,
The Central Yellow’s path renewed.
Wuyi’s fallen horse was in vain,
The dense trees of Yu finally cradled his spirit.

Though his crimson tally once summoned him to court,
His numinous waves still aided the people.
A single stone tablet transmits his old history,
A thousand years of affairs lie within Yan’s precincts.

Auspicious qi births immortal medicines,
Pure wind is entrusted to feathered ones.
The altar preserves the golden tripod’s image,
The well seals the jade-bright ford.

The land adjoins Hongya’s mansion,
The stream flows to the Sword Water’s shore.
Cranes return, clouds stirring,
Dragons rise, stone scales wrinkling.

He awakened to the body as affliction,
His original hope was virtue’s neighbors.
Green mountains do not forget me—
Today, this is heaven’s kinship.

**Two Poems Inscribed at Mei Mountain**
*Fan Renzhong*

His sleeve chilled, he brandished his anti-treason sword,
Yet how could it not avenge the three memorials?
When the deputy of Nanchang stood alone in loyalty,
The Han’s many kings boiled like a hundred cauldrons.

He sought Red Pine as companion and left,
What need had he for fame in the green histories?
I wonder if, after refining the nine-fold elixir,
His indignant spirit spat its essence to the Jade Emperor.

The matter of immortals is distant and vague,
Yet Shouchun’s sacred site endures through the ages.
By the pines, a white crane has hidden for a thousand years,
Beyond the ridges, red sunsets trail through countless evenings.

The rosy chariot plays with shadows in moonlit cold,
The Dipper Altar’s wind chimes ring with night’s fragrance.
The Master need not be called a Perfected One—
He endures as long as heaven and earth.

**Inscribed at Mei Immortal’s Abbey**
*Chen Cangyi*

He advanced loyal words, concealing his name,
This mountain’s spirit enjoys ten thousand years of incense.
Pity those drunk on fame and fortune—
Their blood stains Xianyang, yet they cannot be roused.

**Inscribed at Mei Altar**
*Zuo Shu, Wang Shiyan*

Mei’s deputy’s solitary loyalty shines,
His fragrant name transmitted through the ages.
Though his rank was low, why hide his intent?
A heart upright is itself an immortal.

Daring to admonish, his concern for the times was urgent,
As a subject, he wished his lord to be worthy.
Lingyang was called a fine magistrate,
Facing the Crimson Spring, they stand in opposition.

**Inscribed at Mei Immortal’s Altar**
*Liu Tingwu of Qingjiang*

For centuries, the pure wind of reclusive officials,
Tall pines and slender bamboo fill the altar’s front.
Had the Han emperor heeded his three memorials,
The Master might not have become an immortal.

**Inscribed at Mei Altar**
*Wang Bofan*

The Fire Virtue waned, decline not yet overthrown,
A single memorial from the court’s phoenix cried out first.
Had the lord listened to such loyal counsel,
That traitor Wang’s schemes would not have succeeded.

The immortal’s name fragrantly fills the cosmos,
How many leave a stench to rot the nobles?
Even now, the wind howls, the pines roar in anger,
As if pleading injustice for the Master.

**Staying Overnight at Mei Immortal’s Altar**
*Zhang Guangyang*

I lodge for the night at Mei Altar’s precinct,
The mountain cold, all sounds stilled.
Lacking talent for reclusive office,
I dream of recalling the immortal’s grace.

Stone teeth hold lingering snow,
Pine beards bristle in the fierce wind.
If the smoke of favor could be licked,
I would mount a crane to ask the primordial chaos.

**Inscribed at Mei Altar**
*Zhong Jiu*

Ten thousand pines guard the ridge, towering to the sky,
Within, the Perfected One once dwelled in reclusion.
The well’s chimes still warm with cinnabar’s mercury,
The altar’s height brings the Dipper’s stars near.

Reflecting on Han affairs stirs melancholy,
How vainly men today compose their praises.
I long to follow, yet no path leads there—
Not like Xu’s immortal crane, soaring together.

**Hu Fa**
A speck of loyal liver burns moon-bright,
Yet worldly matters defy the Dao-eye’s gaze.
Riding cloud-cakes to the Dipper’s palace,
Only cliffs and gorges bow to the immortal’s altar.

**Musing While Visiting Mei Altar**
*Linchuan Wu Jiguang*

I stand briefly at the immortal’s altar, embracing the Dipper,
Climbing high, the sky itself seems low.
The pure wind of Nanchang’s reclusive officials lingers—
It awakens those lost in worldly delusions.

**Matching Rhymes on Mei Mountain’s Wall**
*Gu Xu Deng Mengjie*

Ashamed my name and self have fallen to humble garb,
With no means to reach the immortal’s altar.
Though Zi Zhen hid, his fame could not be hidden—
His lofty virtue chills through the ages.

**Inscribed at Mei Mountain**
*Shu Jia Zhao Chazhuang*

I came to this mountain seeking seclusion at Wu Gate,
Grieving that the Han tripod still faces such trials.
If but a single word could turn the celestial ear,
The immortal’s name need not fill the world’s inquiries.

**Inscribed at Mei Altar**
*Cao Xianjia*

Here in Han times, Master Mei refined his elixir,
The ancient altar mottled with moss and lichen.
The eye strains along the crow’s path to distant azure,
While beneath shifting pine shadows, the white sun idles.
Mist veils towers beyond the realm of forms,
Wind carries bells and chimes into mortal ears.
Since his ascent on the Shao melody,
How many times has his flying simurgh returned to these old peaks?

**Zhang Yi of Xinchang**
Returning from memorials, the sun already west,
In the mountains, I swiftly fashioned a robe of creeping fig.
Not for the secrets of golden elixirs did I plan my retreat—
Leaving court, I knew the fiery mandate had shifted.
Wind and dew fill the grove, cicadas shed their skins,
Pines and firs stretch far, a lone crane takes flight.
Burning incense in humble devotion was never my wish—
My loyalty is known to heaven and earth.

Ancient trees, withered vines—how many years have passed?
Those who come here in robes and caps do not do so in vain.
Waves rising from level ground are hard to turn back,
Yet in the mountain’s wind and rain, one sleeps soundly.
If the Dao has spirit, it will find its use in the world,
This heart, unashamed, can reach the heavens.
Fate’s allotment of fame and rank follows my desire—
I will not be driven to serve as a whip-bearer.

**Sending to Yang Yilao of Mei Altar on the Beginning of Spring**
*Fan Taizhong*

The official path wears on, another spring arrives,
I deeply loathe the dusty red of worldly striving.
Unable to untangle endless affairs,
I long recall the carefree, self-possessed man.
Morning draws water from a clay jar to water herbs,
Night dons feathered robes to greet the Perfected.
Beyond things, in the realm of purity and emptiness,
I breathe the pure primordial qi to nurture spirit.

**Inscribed on Mao Qingfu’s Yunyue Tower at Mei Altar**
*Xiao Tailai*

The tower stands at Mei Peak’s highest point,
Day by day drifting with the primordial qi.
The heart of Dao is as joyful as the heart of clouds—
Flying away, flying back, all is freedom.
Gathering the two hundred li of clouds,
Poems and zither windows all turn toward you.
Why delight alone when shared delight is better?
The balustrade lacks only this old man’s share.

**Inscribed on Mei Mountain’s Yunyue Tower**
*Yueshan Zhu Xingfu*

Clad in robes, I ascend the white cloud’s summit,
The gate, entrusted to clouds, opens not idly.
Let it remain in the mountains for self-amusement—
Do not allow a single wisp to leave the peaks.

**Zitang Chen Jie**
White robes and gray dogs—heartless things,
With a flip of the hand, they mourn or rejoice, altering past and present.
I yield to the Daoist, ever carefree,
Watching their rise and fall without concern.

**Houlin Li Yishan**
Clouds, originally without intent—who delights in them?
Since Hua Yang’s departure, few have known.
Wishing to share half a mat, yet no way to arrive,
A single piece flies here in search of poetry.

**Wang Shiyan of Shu**
A lifetime’s livelihood is a body at leisure,
Daily wandering with the white clouds.
Five hundred years later, who knows this taste?
After Hua Mountain, one comes to Mei Mountain.

**Lin Yin Luo Yongzhi**
Once reading Yang’s poem, I knew the lazy clouds,
Now Yunyue is but the cloud’s descendant.
The dragon, without wrath, always returns to its casket,
The crane, fearful, alone guards the gate.
Spring’s mood delights in the company of chanting guests,
A tranquil heart gladly speaks with rustics.
To know clouds are best when leaving the peaks in clear weather—
Beyond the tower, misty rain blurs the scene.

**Chutang Hu Hongzi**
What delights the world
Lies in the bustle of splendor.
Master Mao’s joy
Is white clouds filling green mountains.
The flying tower overlooks vast emptiness,
Ascending, the face ever brightens.
Edges soaring with the clouds,
The heart at ease with the clouds.
The Eight Poles’ Perfected Mei
Rides clouds to and fro.
I, too lazy to leave the peaks,
At times return to sit at the cloud’s gate.
In pure chanting, embracing solitude,
When shall we together find refuge?

**Cui Cizhou**
Immortals favor dwelling in towers,
In heaven, many are jade towers.
Auspicious mists coil in purple and black,
Ever swirling in boundless flow.
The Daoist, descendant of immortals,
Dwells at Mei Mountain’s summit.
The summit soars a hundred feet,
Daily roaming with the clouds.
In silence, observing inner visions,
Cloud qi swirls and floats.
The pavilion embraces the western breeze,
The cold sky gathers the cloud’s shadows.
Leaning on the railing, emotions flow,
Brush and ink thick with cloud and mist.
Inviting guests to discourse on the mysterious,
Fully inhaling the cloud’s rich essence.
No need to divide or question,
Entwined as they may be.
Joyful, all is at ease,
Serene, what more is sought?
Delighted, movement and stillness follow,
Breathing in and out, going and staying as they please.
I long to ride them, knocking at the Great Void,
Together ascending the celestial heights.
Below, pursuing the immortal’s whip,
Simurghs and phoenixes roam boundlessly.
Looking down upon the eight wilds,
Commanding the nine provinces with a wave.
**Zhong Shuo**
Not I who delight in clouds—clouds delight in me,
Clouds and I, both without intent.
Knowing you love hiding in the clouds,
Unwilling to leave the mountains, nowhere to be found.

**Li Junshi**
Without intent, leaving the peaks, the Daoist at leisure,
Body in the void, drifting in the ethereal.
Pity the cloud’s rainbow, longed for by men,
It rolls up the clouds and rain into Mei Mountain.

**Inscribed at Mei Mountain**
*Xue Xiuzhu*

The altar of creeping fig stands high in autumn’s fullness,
The Han’s phoenix pipes and cranes are heard no more.
At dawn’s awakening from a west wind dream,
Half the mortal world is blown into clouds.
