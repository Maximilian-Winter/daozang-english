### *Records of Manifest Wonders of Master Tixuan*

#### The Tree Spirit’s Affliction
In Baipo Village southeast of Laiyang, the wife of Wang Jin, née Dong, suffered from a sudden onset of *gongfeng* (acute wind disorder). Despite summoning renowned physicians for treatment, no remedy proved effective. Half a year passed before word spread that Master Wang, styled the Perfected Tixuan, had arrived at Baipo Hermitage.

Wang Jin rode forth with his servant to beseech the master, but his request was refused. Upon returning, he conferred with his kin: "If Master Wang does not come to her aid, Dong’s life hangs by a thread." Father and son then walked together to the hermitage, pleading all the more earnestly, until the master relented.

Arriving at their home to examine the afflicted woman, he remarked, "What manner of illness is this?" Pointing to a wooden effigy before a carved Buddha, he declared, "Who would have known this fire-headed sprite was the culprit?" He instructed Jin and the others to burn it. After some time, Dong suddenly laughed in surprise, exclaiming that her ailment had vanished. The household rejoiced and bowed in gratitude.

As the master prepared to depart, the family clung to his robes, urging him to stay for a meal before leaving.

#### The Tile Beast’s Calamity

Sun Fu, a native of Nantazi Village in Fushan County, hailed from a family of modest wealth. Diligent in brewing and managing his livelihood, he was by nature overbearing and coarse, his speech often laced with mockery and disdain for propriety. The villagers called him "Mad Third Son." He often roamed the mountains and forests with his master, treating him as a companion for song and wine.

One day, Fu suddenly fell ill with bloody dysentery. The affliction lingered for over a month, resisting both medicine and food. The pain grew unbearable, and in anguish, he reproached himself: *"Why does the master not come to save me?"* Before the words left his lips, the master called from outside the door: *"Is Mad Sun Third at home?"* His son Qin rushed out to greet him, saying, *"Father’s illness is near its end."* The master replied, *"No matter."* Delighted, Qin led him to the sickbed.

The master called out loudly: *"Mad Third, I’ve come especially to drink with you—why not rise?"* Fu replied, *"I’m on the verge of death, unable to take even water or rice. How can I drink?"* The master said, *"I guarantee you won’t die."* He stepped outside, surveyed the surroundings, and pointed to the beast-head ornament on the east wing’s roof: *"This wretched creature is the cause of your calamity."* He immediately ordered it smashed to pieces.

Returning inside, he asked Fu: *"Can you rise now?"* Fu answered, *"The pain has ceased, but I lack the strength to get up."* The master instructed Fu’s wife, née Liang, to quickly prepare congee. Soon, she announced it was ready. The master approached the pot, stirred it, and then personally fed Fu. Fu consumed several bowls in succession, exclaiming how delicious it was—unlike anything he had tasted before.

The master then told Liang: *"Bring a jar of fine wine at once."* He drank half himself and gave the rest to Fu. The grave illness vanished in an instant. Fu straightened his clothes and shoes, rose, and bowed in gratitude: *"I owe my life to your compassion, Master. My heart is filled with gratitude beyond words. I wish to become your disciple and leave the household life to cultivate the Way."* The master replied: *"Those who renounce the world and devote themselves to the end are guided by their past karma—it is not something one can do on a whim. Judging by your past predispositions, you are not destined for the monastic life. It would be better for you to accumulate merit while remaining in the world."*

Shortly after, the master departed. Fu then gathered all the debt contracts and records of unpaid taxes owed to him by his fellow villagers and burned them. He also distributed cooked food to the poor.

The master once traveled to Dongni Family Village in Laiyang, where a river to the east was called Hushi Cliff. There stood a newly built small hermitage, where his disciples, including Wang Zhijian, resided. It was just after the New Year when Zhijian privately discussed with the others: *"This hermitage has only just been established, and few households yet offer their devotion. Now that the master has graciously descended upon us, we should exhaust all our resources to hold an Upper Prime Offering—would that be fitting?"* The others agreed. After making the necessary preparations, the offering was duly completed.

On the sixteenth day, as the rites concluded, the master addressed the assembly: *"Let none of you—whether monastics or laypeople—depart yet. After tomorrow’s meal, you may disperse."* No one dared refuse. After some time, Zhijian entered and reported: *"The count is complete: over seventy people are present. Judging by the remaining cakes and provisions, there is barely enough to fill a small basket. I fear it will not suffice."* The master personally went to inspect the basket, then transferred its contents into an empty jar and declared: *"It will be enough, it will be enough."*

The next day, as the meal was about to begin, Zhijian again asked: *"How many cakes per person?"* The master replied: *"Four each."* They followed his instruction. After the meal, he said: *"For those who have come from afar, give each two more cakes to cover their travel expenses."* When all had been distributed, not a single morsel remained. Zhijian recounted this to the others, and the assembly burned incense, bowed in reverence, and marveled at the wonder. From then on, dozens of villages turned to the practice of goodness, and alms for meals were frequently provided.

The master once begged for food and came to Shoumugoutou Village. A man named Yu Shen saw him and asked: *"Master, will you take a meal?"* The master replied: *"Yes."* Yu invited him to sit and went inside to tell his wife: *"Make a steamed bun for the master’s meal."* As she was kneading the dough, someone suddenly called from outside: *"Master, Officer Li has sent his friend Hong to invite you for a drink. They have been waiting for you for some time."* Upon hearing this, the master said to Yu: *"Bring me the dough."* Yu replied: *"It is not yet ready."* The master said: *"Just bring it as it is—it will do."* Yu assumed he meant to take it to Officer Li’s residence to finish preparing, so he handed over the raw dough. The master took it and ate it without the slightest difficulty. Astonished, Yu admonished him: *"Master, even if your cauldron holds cinnabar and your furnace holds true fire, how could you endure this?"* The master merely smiled faintly and did not answer. He finished the dough and departed, suffering no harm afterward.

The prayers were answered immediately.

The master journeyed northward to Jizhou, arriving in Zunhua County. At the time, the northern capital was suffering a severe drought. The provincial surveillance commissioner, who had long revered the master’s teachings, honored the Dao, and repeatedly witnessed his prayers being answered, learned of his presence in Zunhua. He promptly dispatched Shang Siguan, a devout Daoist official in the capital, bearing an invitation. The master, unable to decline, accepted and set out, reaching Beijing on the fourteenth day of the seventh month. The commissioner, along with various officials and petitioners for rain, gathered to pay their respects. After the thousands had completed their bows, the commissioner personally attended to the master.

At dawn the following day, the commissioner led the assembly once more. The master stepped forward, lit incense, and prayed: *"This region has endured drought for fifty days; the seedlings are withering. I humbly beseech your compassion to relieve the people’s distress. It would be most fortunate indeed."* The master then asked: *"Would a foot of rain suffice?"* The crowd exchanged glances but remained silent.

On the seventeenth day, rain fell across a thousand *li*, measuring precisely a foot in depth. The officials and populace convened to offer a thanksgiving *jiao* ritual, which was then concluded. As the master prepared to leave the capital, the entire city turned out to see him off. The commissioner said: *"After this parting, we may not meet again for a long time."* The master replied: *"The capital."*

The commissioner returned home and pondered: *"I have not been in office for even two months—how could there be a return to the capital so soon?"* On the Mid-Autumn Festival, the master arrived at Tai Xu Abbey in the capital. Within days, the commissioner was appointed Grand Master of the Heir Apparent and indeed encountered the master there.

As the master prepared to journey south, the Grand Master presented a parting gift, saying: *"There is no way to keep you here long, like lingzhi cakes. The mountains and rivers grow distant—where shall we meet again?"* The master replied: *"Ninghai."* The Grand Master fell silent, musing that perhaps some unforeseen duty would take him to Ninghai. *"But if I were assigned there,"* he thought, *"how could it be a demotion?"* Later, he was indeed posted to Ninghai. All their meetings had been foretold.

The master returned to his hometown. Later, when disturbances arose along the northern frontier, the Grand Master was dispatched there but failed in his mission and was thus demoted to serve as Prefect of Ninghai. No sooner had he taken up his post than he personally visited the Sacred Springs to pay his respects to the master. Burning incense, he earnestly declared: *"The Dao you embody is that of the immortals and perfected ones of old—until I met you, I had only heard of such things. Since becoming your disciple, every prayer I have offered has met with a gracious response. Before each meeting, you have foretold its coming. Ashamed as I am of my worldly dust, I have been blessed beyond measure. I had nearly resolved to cast off the burdens of this fleeting life and wander like the clouds and waters, yet affairs have thwarted my wish, leaving me with nothing but regret."*

**The Master’s Miraculous Drinking**
When the master was summoned to court and passed through Cangzhou, a royal kinsman with the rank of Fourth Official invited him to stay at his own Daoist hermitage. The following day, the wine commissioner, Lord Liu, entreated the master: *"I humbly beg your dharma-body to grace my humble abode—it would be my greatest fortune."* The master consented and went to his modest dwelling. After the meal, Lord Liu spoke again: *"I have long heard that you can drink without ever becoming drunk, yet I have never witnessed it. Now that your virtue and Dao have reached the highest ears, I am honored to receive your presence. I beg you to drink your fill and become truly intoxicated—it would fulfill my deepest wish."* The master replied: *"Your kindness is too generous. Your fine wine is surely beyond the coarse brew of rustic taverns. If I eat and drink my fill, I fear I will be unable to endure it. Allow me a brief rest, and then I shall drink deeply."* Lord Liu assented and withdrew.

Presently, he heard the master’s snores resounding like thunder in the hall. He and his wife, Lady Zhao, then went to the wine cellar to prepare for the master’s drinking. Suddenly, they saw the master in the cellar, holding a jar and ladling wine into his cup, drinking one after another. The couple silently withdrew, only to find the master still fast asleep in the hall. They peered into the cellar again and saw him drinking as before—one jar was already empty, and the next was nearly finished. Astonished and alarmed, they hurried back to the hall and prostrated themselves before him without waiting for incense. The master awoke and said: *"Since you summoned me, I have already drunk two jars. How can I repay you?"* He then instructed his attendant to fetch an old sweat-stained shirt and presented it to Lord Liu, saying: *"Though the item is humble, its value is beyond measure. If anyone is ill, covering them with this will bring a cure."*

Soon after, the master proceeded to the capital. When word spread, the sick from all directions flocked to him like spokes to a hub, and their cures were as swift as an echo in a valley.

The couple suddenly awakened with a start and exclaimed: *"Truly, good deeds bear fruit, and the power of the Dao is to be trusted!"* They then distributed their wealth among the poor, freed their servants to live as commoners, and each took monastic vows, ultimately ending their days in the Way.

**Forgetting Form Over Chess**
Once, the master begged for alms in Shuidu Village, south of Fushan County. A wealthy man named Wang You saw him and asked: *"Master, would you deign to play chess with me?"*
The master replied: *"As you command."*
It was the depths of winter, bitterly cold. You wore a fox-fur hat, a padded robe, leather boots, and felt-lined stirrups, while the master’s single garment left his elbows bare, and his worn shoes exposed his toes. You deliberately humiliated him, leading him to the front hall and seating him facing the wind at the door while you sat beside him. Mockingly, you asked: *"How many games shall we play?"*
The master said: *"Three will suffice."*
You said: *"Too few."*
The master replied: *"Ten, then—will that do?"*
You agreed. As they played move by move, the games had barely begun when You already felt the cold. Struggling through two more rounds, You rubbed his hands and stamped his feet, nearly unable to endure it. Yet when he looked at the master, his countenance was radiant, warm as spring. Unable to last even three games, You abandoned the match and rose, saying: *"Master, you are truly one without thought or care, who forgets both form and body."*
The master smiled faintly and sighed: *"Worldly scorn, worldly sincerity—betrayal of vows and promises."*
With that, he departed.

**Dedicated to Heirs**

At first, Zhuanzhi was a native of Shizhong in Fuzhan. His family had long been prominent, and though he revered the master’s reputation and was nearing sixty, he had no heir. One day, the master sat on the ground before the courtyard and lifted a stone mortar with his feet. When asked why, he replied: *"Zhuanzhi has no son—this mortar is misplaced. I shall now grant him two sons; the mortar must be moved to avert future trouble."* The crowd laughed, dismissing his words as madness. The master, however, paid no heed; lifting the mortar with his feet, he strode away with sleeves swaying. Later, Zhuanzhi indeed fathered two sons. The elder was named Xingzhu, the younger Qide. Only then did the people fully believe.

**Bao Yang’s Safe Recovery**
Gao Rong, a neighbor of the Zhu family in the same village, had practiced medicine for generations, his nature kind and compassionate. His father revered the Dao of the master and named him Bao Yang. One day, Bao Yang suddenly fell ill with dysentery; neither immortal remedies nor divine medicines could cure him. After more than a month, he could no longer take broth or water, his pain unbearable. All said his condition was hopeless, that no method could heal him.

Another day, the master traveled from Shumou to Louzi Village in the southern hamlet. To his disciple Deng Daotong, he said: *"I had thought Gao Bao Yang must have died of his illness, but now I learn he yet lives—let us go together to save him."* Passing north of the Temple of the Sun Lord’s Spirit, he broke off a sprig of thorn and, facing the shrine, cast it forth with a rebuke. After standing motionless for a long while, he proceeded directly to Gao’s home. There, he asked for a small knife, entered the sickroom, and said to the patient: *"I have come to save you."* With the sleeve of his cloth robe, he swept from the man’s head down to his heels. Then, pressing the knife’s tip firmly into the woven mat, he commanded the patient to sit up. At once, the man rose at his word, his pain vanished as if forgotten, and his speech returned as before. The master ordered the household to boil thick congee at once. The family protested: *"Even water is too much for him—how could he take thick congee?"* The master replied: *"No matter."* Soon, the congee arrived. The master himself fed it to the patient. At first, the man hesitated, but after a few mouthfuls, he consumed two bowls in succession. *"How fine it is!"* he exclaimed, then rose from his bed to express his thanks. His recovery was swift, his health more robust than before. Suddenly, rain and dragons arose in the sky.

After the master completed the jiao ritual in Jizhou, officials from Yutian County and various Daoist devotees invited him to stay for the summer at the Yuqing Abbey in their town. As the fifth month brought drought, on the tenth day, officials and commoners entreated the master to pray for rain, and he agreed. The next day, rain fell to a depth of about two inches. Yet before long, the officials and people remained unsatisfied and came to express their thanks. The master said, *"It is wrong to thank me—this was not the rain I prayed for."*

On the thirteenth day, just before dawn, the master burned incense before the sacred image, then pointed to the crowd and asked, *"Do you see?"* Following his gesture southward, they saw a single wisp of black smoke rising from a well. The master said, *"This is the rain dragon drawing water and taking flight. Soon, it will pour."* Indeed, by the hour of *chen*, rain began to fall, continuing until dusk, soaking the land far and near. The officials and people rejoiced, the crops flourished, and the region enjoyed a great harvest.

**The Chicken Restored to Life**
Years earlier, the master had visited Dongmacao Village in Laiyang. A man named Jiang Huang, having heard of the master’s ability to heal illness, withstand cold and heat, longed to meet him. That day, he invited the master to his home and asked, *"I wish to offer you a hearty meal—what dish would you prefer?"* The master replied, *"Do you have a chicken?"* Jiang answered, *"My family raises only sheep; we have never kept chickens. Recently, a relative gave me one, a fine crower, to mark the hours."* The master said, *"Would you let me eat it?"* Jiang agreed and went to catch it.

Just then, Li Shouqing of the same village saw him and admonished, *"Even gentlemen of the world cannot bear to see living things die or eat meat—how much less should a Daoist?"* He continued, *"Your reverence for this master borders on folly."* Jiang replied, *"I have often seen people prepare feasts and wine, yet fail to bring the master to their door. Now that he has graced me with his presence, how can I begrudge this one creature?"* So he killed and cooked the chicken. When it was ready, he served it to the master, who ate it all. Patting his belly with a satisfied belch, he departed in high spirits.

The next morning, Jiang and the others suddenly heard a rooster crow. They wondered, *"What other chicken has come to roost here? The voice sounds like the one we cooked."* When dawn came, they saw it clearly—its form and color were identical to the previous bird. Even the feathers they had plucked the day before were all restored. Jiang was overcome, his mind reeling as if drunk, and he rushed to tell Li Shouqing.

Li, upon hearing this, grew solemn and said, *"Yesterday, I took the master for an ordinary man. Now I see—he must be one who has attained the Dao."* Jiang said, *"Though I had heard he could heal illness and withstand cold and heat, my faith was not yet complete. I did not know if all who attain the Dao can do such things."* Li replied, *"It is a pity you are unlearned. I have read a few immortals’ scriptures and Daoist biographies and know that those who attain the Dao can mold yin and yang, command the nine lands, project their spirits into dreams, pass through metal and stone, transform and soar—nothing is beyond them. How much less this one chicken?"*

Jiang, enlightened, exclaimed, *"The master’s Dao is like heaven itself! I was as blind as a man who stews a chicken and sees no further."* He continued, *"You have lifted the veil for me. Now I know how high and vast heaven is—how could shallow understanding ever fathom its bounds?"*

**Wang Gong Falls from His Horse**
Wang Zhong of Nanshui Village in Fushan once invited the master to his home for a drink. As the feast reached its height, a tenant from the southern hamlet, Li Wang, summoned Wang to settle a land dispute. Wang ordered his horse saddled and prepared to leave. His wife urged him to hurry. The master said to Wang, *"Do not go. If you do, you will die in vain."*

His wife, annoyed, retorted, *"The master clings to his drink and cares nothing for others’ affairs. Why do you invent tales of sudden death to deceive us?"* The master brushed his sleeves and rose, saying, *"If you do not believe me, then go north as you wish."*

After they had traveled about five *li*, they suddenly heard galloping hooves behind them. Turning, they saw Wang’s son-in-law, Liu Chun, rushing toward them in distress. He cried, *"Your father has fallen from his horse and died!"* He begged the master to come and save him, bowing without cease. The master agreed and returned with them. They found Wang lying dead on the road, surrounded by mourners. The master bade them be silent and ordered a bowl of water. He circled the body, sprinkling it three times until the water was gone. Then he said, *"I cannot save him."*

The crowd pleaded again and again. The master had them fetch another bowl of water. He infused it with *qi*, murmured an incantation, and sprinkled it three more times. Then he shouted, *"Wang Zhong, raise your left hand!"* At once, the hand rose. *"Now your right!"* It too obeyed. The master commanded him to open his eyes. Wang looked around and asked, *"What are you all doing here?"* His wife asked, *"Did you not feel anything?"*

Wang slowly replied, *"All I recall is arriving here when suddenly I fell into a stupor. Then I followed several men west for about twenty li, until I suddenly heard Master Wang calling me back. We returned to a ditch—both deep and wide—which I could not cross. Thanks to Master Wang lifting me by the hand, I made it across."*

The crowd pointed and said, *"The master is here!"*

Wang rose and bowed in gratitude, saying, *"I did not believe in the profound words and so brought this calamity upon myself. Had you not rescued me, I would already be listed among the dead."*

His wife, deeply ashamed, grew even more reverent and obedient.

**The Woman Who Ate Dog Meat**

When the master arrived at Linyi County in Jinan Prefecture, ten prominent households, including Jiao Runyu and Li Yufeng, were preparing a grand Yellow Register Jiao offering, dividing the tasks among various stations and making preparations day and night. Each day, devotees from all directions gathered like clouds.

On the eve of the Jiao ceremony, just before dawn, several of the ritual’s leaders came to the master’s quiet chamber to await him. The master awoke, and through his attendant, they relayed, *"A newlywed woman from the Li family in the city has just died in front of the temple hall. We beg your compassion to save her."*

The master said, *"Why did you not speak sooner?"* Without even pinning up his hair, he threw on his robe and slipped on his shoes. Arriving before the hour of the deceased’s *yuanchen*, he drew in a breath of *qi* and blew it onto the crown of her head. Then, with his sleeve, he brushed her, and she immediately revived.

The master returned to his chamber. After the crowd had paid their respects, he said, *"This woman ate dog meat, offending the Jiao altar. Her *yuanchen* punished her, and she was being delivered to Mount Tai. I intervened and brought her back."*

After some time, the woman regained full awareness and told the crowd, *"Because I did not believe in Master Wang, I ate dog meat and came here to see if there would be any consequence. Now I have been punished and sent into darkness, only to be saved by the radiance of this true master. You must all believe!"*

---

**A Chronic Illness Cured**

While the master was at Huayang Abbey in Beijing, there was an Assistant Surveillance Commissioner, a Grand Master for Consultation known for his harsh and cruel administration of justice—so much so that he was nicknamed *"Half-Sword."* Yet he was deeply filial toward his parents. His mother had been afflicted with an illness for several years, and despite countless remedies, none had proven effective.

Upon returning from his duties each day, he would attend to his mother’s needs and inquire after her illness, lamenting that he could find no way to take her suffering upon himself. One of his subordinates reported, *"Here in the capital, whenever someone falls ill, they seek out Master Wang’s leftover food, and upon consuming it, they are instantly cured."* Though the Assistant Surveillance Commissioner had not yet placed full faith in this, his filial devotion compelled him to act. He went to pay homage to the master and begged for some of his leftover food. The master granted his request. Upon returning home, he fed it to his mother, and her long-standing illness vanished at once.

The next day, he invited the master to his official hall, where he dressed in court robes, lit incense, and knelt to address him: *"From my earliest years, I have been devoted to goodness. Yet since passing the imperial examinations and entering office, I feared that such pursuits might interfere with my duties, so I kept them hidden. Over the years, I have held this post in many regions—Guanxi, Shandong, Henan, and Haibei—and wherever I went, I sought out those of the Buddhist path. But among those I met, all were mere pretenders, none worthy of being a teacher. Now, by good fortune, I have encountered a true master. I humbly beg you to impart your teachings, that I may forever honor you as my宗师 and cultivate the causes for transcending this world."* The master’s religious name was Qingzhi, and his Daoist appellation was Kaizhenzi. After bowing in reverence and expressing his gratitude, the official hosted a vegetarian feast with tea and fruit, lingering until dusk before escorting the master back to the abbey.

**A Wronged Soul Seeks Redress**
The following day, Assistant Surveillance Commissioner Wulinda Qingzhi gathered a gathering of virtuous people in the capital to discuss holding a Yellow Register Offering. The crowd readily agreed. They began preparations at Huayang Abbey day and night, and those who had commissioned the rite set up spirit tablets. After two or three days of invocations, suddenly before the spirit tablets, a man collapsed and died, then revived—staggering wildly as if deranged, chasing after a woman with the intent to seize her, as though he had some grievance to voice. The crowd restrained him, urging him to speak through the ritual gate. He replied, *"I am ashamed to say."* The crowd pressed, *"If you do not speak, how can anyone know?"*

Slowly he spoke: *"Last year, when my term of service in the capital ended, I returned home on the ninth day of the ninth month. My wife had concealed poison in the silk floss of our bedding and murdered me, then married the man she had been seeing. Now I have learned that a perfected one from the south, a master of the Dao, is holding this great Offering here. I wanted to seize her and bring my case before the master, begging for deliverance. I have no kin, no one who knows me, no one to rely on—if I fall into the dark realms, when will I ever escape? If the master departs, I will never have this chance again."* With that, he broke into loud sobs. Those watching were moved to sorrow.

Then Zhang Er, a devout follower from Ruizhou’s Yang County who had accompanied the master, gently calmed his weeping and said: *"Since you have made your case so clearly, it has already been recorded in the Offering. When this rite concludes, I will invite the master to perform another Offering in Haiyang, where we will pray for your deliverance."* The man bowed in gratitude and left. He returned to his former state as before.

**A Malevolent Spirit Departs the House**
When the master arrived at Gaozhen Abbey in Changli County, Pingzhou, there lived in the city a former county deputy whose nature was harsh and stubborn, and who had never believed in good deeds. Suddenly he fell gravely ill, his condition worsening with each passing year. At night his dreams were chaotic, his heart constantly gripped by terror. Many among his relatives and servants suffered similarly.

Moreover, malevolent spirits assailed him, disrupting his meals, until he grew emaciated and could no longer rise. Though shamans were summoned and physicians exhausted, no relief came. Hearing the master was at the abbey, he sent a messenger to kneel before him. The master rebuked the spirits and ordered them to release the man, yet they hesitated, unwilling to depart. When he rebuked them again with greater fury, they at last withdrew. The afflicted could then stand unaided. The master bade him draw near, and he was able to walk—his recovery half complete. The master gave him the remnants of his own meal, which he consumed entirely. Soon after, he felt as light and strong as in his days of health.

The master then took a bottle of water, inscribed a talisman, and instructed him in its use. The man bowed in gratitude and returned home. Following the master’s command, he affixed the talisman in the hall. At once, the spirits manifested—hideous in form—visible to all in the household. When he sprinkled them with the consecrated water, they fled in terror into a pit. He sprinkled the pit as well, forcing six spirits—great and small—to emerge, clutching and dragging one another away. He pursued them, scattering water until they fled far from the house, their forms dissolving into nothingness. From that day, the dwelling was at peace, and its inhabitants untroubled.

The next morning, the man brought his family to the master, burned incense, and prostrated himself in thanks, saying: *"All my life, I have been obstinate, harsh, and unkind—how could I have known the Daoist gate held such wonders?"* He then donated generously to rebuild Gaozhen Abbey, and through his influence, over two hundred households in the city came to revere the Dao.

**Phoenixes and Cranes Gather at the Altar**
The Daoist layman Zhang the Second of Haiyang County, Ruizhou, invited the master to conduct a grand Offering of the Yellow Register for the Lower Prime. The preparations were vast and multifaceted, yet all was carried out with meticulous care, and not once did the master falter in his duties.

The master foretold the assembly, saying: *"This Offering is no ordinary rite—auspicious omens shall surely descend."* On the thirteenth day, at the hour of *shen*, as the memorials were being dispatched, four phoenixes and twenty cranes soared overhead, circling for a long while before departing toward the southwest. On the fourteenth day, at mid-morning as the ritual procession commenced, the master declared: *"A response shall come."* By noon, the Celestial Master manifested. As the procession continued until midday, suddenly a pair of phoenixes led a flock of cranes in flight above the altar, their forms suffused with five-colored radiance that dazzled all who beheld them. Some doubted they were true cranes, but several descended in low, circling flight, revealing their crimson crowns—all marveled. Presently, one crane alighted gracefully before the altar; when driven away, it merely grew tame. Fed daily, it would crane its neck and cry to the heavens, yet never took flight. When the master prepared to depart westward on the twentieth day, he burned incense and took leave of the deities. The crane then cried out loudly, beat its wings, and rose into the sky, circling above the three markets before vanishing toward the southwest. Thereupon, the entire city’s faithful—including Magistrate He—had the scene painted and revered it without cease.

**The Most High Appears Amid Clouds**
Upon returning from the north to Chongxing Town in Dezhou, the master was invited by the former Prefect of Cangzhou, now a Court Gentleman of Splendid Happiness, to conduct a four-day-and-night Offering of the Yellow Register. The prefect had purified himself and prepared his heart, adhering strictly to the rites in every detail. As the Offering commenced, the master remarked: *"To hold rank of the third order is the pinnacle of human honor—yet here is one who reveres the Mysterious Code with tireless devotion. Such piety must move the heavens, and extraordinary signs shall appear."* On the fourth night, as the rites unfolded, the assembly suddenly beheld the Most High Lord Lao riding upon five-colored luminous clouds above the altar, receiving the blue memorial. The master prostrated himself. Then, a youth no taller than a foot appeared, his countenance and attire surpassing all earthly beauty. Rising from the master’s incense burner, he approached the Most High as if to report or receive instruction. Once the memorial was burned, both vanished from sight. The Court Gentleman immediately ordered painters to record the event, and the people copied and circulated the images. All who witnessed or heard of it marveled, for such a sight was rare in ancient or modern times.

*The Record of Marvels of the Perfected One Who Embodied the Mysterious ends.*
