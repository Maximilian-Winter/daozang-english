*The Southern Marchmount’s Compendium of Marvels*

**Title:** *The Southern Marchmount’s Compendium of Marvels* (*Nanyue Zongsheng Ji*). Composed by Chen Tianfu of the Song dynasty. One fascicle. Base text from *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, Dongxuan Section, Record-Biography Category.

**Hall of the Perfected Lords**
The Hall of the Perfected Lords (*Zhenjun Guan*) stands fifty paces east of the *Lian De Guan*, serving as the palace of the Nine Heavens’ Southern Supreme Purple Radiance Celebration Florescence Red Thearch’s Grand Void (*Jiutian Nanshang Ziguan Qinghua Chidi Taixu zhi Guan*). Originally the Temple of the Perfected Lord of Life-Registry (*Zhusheng Zhenjun Miao*), it was situated among the gates of the various temples within the Marchmount’s shrine complex.

During the Kaiyuan era of the Tang, Minister Sima Zhen memorialized that each of the Five Marchmounts’ grotto-heavens was governed by a Supreme Perfected One, who ought not share sacrifices with deities receiving blood offerings. By imperial decree, purified halls were established, and from the first day of summer, officials were to observe purification rites before the prefectural magistrate conducted the jiao offering. Thus, the hall was also entrusted with five Daoist priests for cultivation and ritual.

In the fifth year of Kaiyuan, Emperor Minghuang composed *The Scripture of the Five Numinous Ones* (*Wuling Jing*), which states: "Those who assist in governance number nine. Those who serve as attendants are the Three Elders. The remaining officers of the northern guard, along with three hundred ceremonial officials, form the site for the state’s prayers to the Perfected and petitions for blessings."

*The Record of the Supreme Perfected* (*Shangzhen Ji*) states: "The Perfected Lord of the Grand Void (*Taixu Zhenren*) presides over the Southern Supreme Office of Life-Registry, and is none other than the Red Thearch (*Chidi*). Wei Junchong of Mount Qian serves as deputy governor, while Han Junzhong of Mount Huo assists in governance."

The following are the lords who serve as assistants in the governance of life-registry: Xu Junying of Huolin Mountain, Zhou Jun Ziyang of Danhuo Mountain, Huang Jun Chuping of Jinhua Mountain, Zheng Jun Yin of Nanhuo Mountain, Ruan Junhui of Tianzhu Mountain, Lady Wei Huacun the Purple Void Primordial Lady, and Lady Ma Gu the Primordial Lady of Tranquil Quiescence. These lords oversee the regions of Wu, Yue, Chu, and Shu, where they exercise their supervisory duties. In the Chunhua era, their titles were first changed to "Perfected Lords," and their abode was established as the Perfected Lords’ Abbey. During the Xiangfu era, an imperial edict bestowed upon the abbey its inscribed plaque.

In the sixth year of Kaiyuan, the Celestial Thearch descended and bestowed upon the Perfected Lords a jade *bi* for expelling evil, shaped like a sword, three *chi* in length and four *cun* in width, its jade markings resembling clouds and rosy dawn, its tip slightly edged like a blade. Also granted was a jade tablet, over one *chi* in length and six *cun* in width, inscribed with seal script reading: *"Jade Tablet of the Dao Lord."* Two seals accompanied it, their inscriptions reading: *"Seal of the Supreme One of the Three Heavens,"* both in seal script. Some say the original jade tablet was once bound to the Perfected Lord’s arm, and this sandalwood replica was carved to transmit it to later generations. Additionally, there was a jade seal, five *cun* square with eight corners, its inscription reading: *"Jade Seal of the Life-Registry Perfected Lord,"* also in seal script, all of which remain preserved to this day. Some claim these were inscribed by Celestial Master Sima.

During the Song dynasty, a fire bell and crown were bestowed upon the Perfected Lord, adorned with gold. The jade tablets of the Perfected Lords of Mount Qian and Mount Huo are also preserved here. The three sagely emperors—Taizong, Zhenzong, and Renzong—each left imperial edicts written in yellow, which are still kept. In the second year of Daguan, during the third month, an imperial decree ordered the construction of the Yuanchen Hall, which became the Jifu Hall within the abbey. Before it stands the Gate of the Jade Clarity and Golden Towers. Each year, on the six seasonal birthdays and during the spring and summer sacrifices, imperial hymns and tablets are sent from the capital to this site for ritual offerings. On each occasion, six *liang* of imperial incense are burned, prayers are offered for the emperor’s longevity, and a purple robe is bestowed as a gift. Truly, this is the place where the state seeks blessings.

Thus, the Duke of Jiangling left a poem inscribed at the Perfected Lords’ Abbey, which reads:
*"The secret hall soars near the Purple Void,
In the secluded grotto-heaven, the Perfected dwell in ordered rows.
Frost-feathered cranes descend from Vermilion Mound,
Golden tablets still bear the script of Wan Ji’s tome.
Wind stirs the jade altar as feathered hymns rise,
Clouds return to emerald peaks where the phoenix chariot glides.
Amid bamboo mist, beneath the moon’s gaze—what song remains?
A single stream of chill waters rinses the azure channel."*

**Hengyue Abbey**
Hengyue Abbey lies south of Purple Canopy Peak, before the foot of Purple Empyrean Peak.

In the eighth year of Taikang of the Jin dynasty, Xu Lingqi of Wu and Master Deng Yu of Xinye unearthed the ancient foundations of the Queen Mother’s Hall. During the Yuanjia reign of Emperor Huai of Jin, it was bestowed the name *Huasou*; by the Liang dynasty, it was renamed the Nine Perfections Abbey. Zhang Zuoyao’s *Poetic Summary* states:
*"In Jin times it was Huasou,
In Liang, the Nine Perfections named.
Though palace gates bear changing signs,
The grotto’s spring remains the same."*

The abbey’s custodian, Zhou Jingzhen, was the teacher of Emperor Wu. The emperor, aspiring to supreme virtue, personally humbled himself in a yellow carriage to visit this divine capital—akin to the Yellow Emperor’s homage at Kongtong or the Han sovereign’s rites by the river, a convergence of different eras in the same spirit. By imperial decree, three hundred households of farmland were granted as its endowment.

In the eighth year of Daye of the Sui dynasty, Emperor Gaozu of Tang summoned Masters Cai Fashou and Li Fachao to oversee the abbey’s rituals and revive its teachings. The fields, granaries, and possessions of Hengzhou Prefecture were all bestowed for the abbey’s use. In the second year of Zhenguan, Emperor Taizong re-inscribed its plaque and ordered Celestial Master Zhang Huiming to ordain nineteen Daoist priests for its rites. In the second year of Hongdao of Emperor Gaozong, Celestial Master Ye Fashan was decreed to enclose forty *li* of the mountain as abbey grounds. This land of immortality was forbidden to woodcutters and hunters; the rites of casting dragon tablets and offering jade slips became its enduring custom.

During the Kaihuang reign, it was renamed Hengyue Abbey, but later fell to ruin in war and fire. In the early years of Huangyou, Lord Ling of the prefecture had it rebuilt. Under the present dynasty, the Three Sagely Emperors—Taizong, Zhenzong, and Renzong—each inscribed calligraphy and bestowed golden tablets. On every imperial anniversary, incense is burned to pray for the emperor’s longevity, making this another site where the state seeks blessings.

During the reign of Zhenzong, Master Shan Weiyue of Chongjing was dispatched by decree to serve as abbot, oversee the mountain’s abbeys, and manage fire and incense. Later, by imperial order, the system of *jia-yi* ranking began here. Thus, the Grand Councilor Wang Qinruo composed *A Poem Seeing Master Shan Off to the Mountain*:
*"A jade missive borne by phoenix chariot descends to the sacred realm,
Where towering abbeys and cinnabar terraces select the Daoist stream.
How can cliffs and vales contain the nature of gibbons and cranes?
Their chanting hearts ever yearn for the seclusion of waters and clouds.
On the late journey, snow veils the Xiao and Xiang’s crossing,
While herb-gathering skiffs trace the creek in their light dance.
Upon reaching the land of Chu, what thoughts will arise?
A decade’s men and affairs—half sunk, half afloat."*

In the sixth year of Xuanhe, an edict ordered the construction of the Hall of August Heaven, and the abbey was renamed the Abbey of Measured Virtue.

**Purple Canopy Abbey**
Purple Canopy Abbey lies fifteen *li* north of the temple, above Baosheng Monastery. It was where the Tang dynasty hermit Chuan Daixian cultivated the Dao, and Masters Tan and Chen also refined their arts here. The Iron Gourd Immortal, Zhang Bai, once resided within. To the north, entering Peach Blossom Spring, the foundations have long lain in ruin, now inhabited by rustics. Above stands an altar for the Rite of the Dipper. Nearby is the site where Li Sheng of Aobei achieved liberation through the corpse, and below stands the horse-post of a Tang prince.

**Abbey of Sagely Longevity**
The Abbey of Sagely Longevity lies seven *li* north of the temple, ascending the mountain. Built during the Xiantong reign of the Tang, its name derives from an inquiry into its origins. An old *Record* states: When Lu Fan, former military governor of Lingwu, governed Qiannan, he memorialized to convert his former study into an abbey. Six years later, he donated farmlands and dwellings in perpetuity to the abbey’s upkeep. Today, Lord Lu’s true hall and its halls remain as they were.

The Clear Sound Pavilion, Pavilion of Selecting Immortals, Pavilion of Welcoming Immortals, and Pavilion of This Gentleman stand amid sheer cliffs and towering peaks, where verdant bamboo and towering pines thrive. The secluded ravines and crystalline streams create a scene of wondrous beauty—several times more lush than the Abbey of Myriad Longevities. The Longevity Ravine’s path descends before the abbey, merging with the Spirit Ravine before flowing into the open plain.

During the Yihui reign of the Tang, Xuanyuan Miming secluded himself here for many years. Later, he embraced the Yellow Grotto. In the Taiping Xingguo reign, a lame immortal encountered Lü Dongbin on Jun Mountain and afterward also secluded himself here. Practicing the method of the Breathing Tortoise, he achieved success and returned to Mount Lu, styling himself the Master of Xiao and Xiang. He once said:
*"I love the realm of Xiao and Xiang,
Where red dust is barred from the other shore.
Of the seventy-two peaks of the southern mountains,
Only this grotto’s true void brings delight."*

During the Yuanyou reign, white cranes often perched and cried among the cedars and pines, departing after three days. In the first year of Xuanhe, it was renamed the Abbey of Longevity Chess.

**Canopy of Florescence Abbey**
The Canopy of Florescence Abbey was once the cultivation site of the Lord of the Flourishing Canopy.

The name remains unattested, though some say it was the ancient Abbey of Grand Purity. Fifteen *li* northeast of the temple, one reaches it by land from the Abbey of Primordial Yang to the Abbey of Upper Clarity.

In former times, Tan Qiaoyan, styled Jingsheng, dwelt long on Mount Zhongnan and composed the *Book of Transformations*. Passing through the Eastern Wu region, he met Song Qiqiu traveling among Mount Lu’s peaks, then drifted down the Xiao and Xiang, refining elixirs here. Another, Moxi Zi, surname unknown, resided here and composed the *Scripture of Penetrating the Origin*.

During the Kaihuang reign, the Daoist Wu Hanxu, styled Heling, took up residence. Wild in manner, he never descended the mountain, spending his days in drunken stupor without even the implements for kindling fire. The common folk called him “Wu the Rubbed.” Fond of sleep, he would go ten days without eating. He often said: *“To be idle, one must first be lazy—like an onion, for if you peel it, it is no longer idle.”* Though he never studied literature, he suddenly composed the *“Song of Ascension”*:

*A decree from the Jade Emperor appoints me to immortal office,
Dragons spew clouds, winds exert their force.
Before my eyes, pavilions and terraces suddenly appear,
Strange grasses and wondrous flowers beyond recognition.
I gaze upon the world from the Great Veil,
The world no larger than a hand’s span.
Had I not hastened to ascend,
All would have been lifted at once and sold in Yingzhou.*

Later, in the second year of Qingtai, he ascended to immortality.

Additionally, there was the Recluse of Ketaishan, Master Iron-Crown Fan, who admired the Dao of Heling and often rode a white ox to visit him. King Ma Xifan of Chu once took him as his teacher. Later, when Ma Xisheng succeeded to the throne, the Master vanished without a trace.

The Upper Clarity Palace, located seven *li* northeast of the temple, was the place where the Perfected Xu Lingqi of the Wu people cultivated the Dao. In his youth, Xu encountered a divine person who transmitted to him the essentials of the Mysterious Elixir, the method of absorbing the radiance of the sun, and the Way of guarding the Mud-Pill Palace. He subsisted on sesame rice, and thus was able to wander among the seas and mountains, coming and going to the Southern Mountains for many years. He explored the caves and valleys of the mountains and composed the *Record of Mount Heng*, detailing the numinous marvels of its grotto-heavens. He wrote that the Purple Canopy and Cloudy Veil Peaks each rose over five thousand *zhang* in height. On Cloudy Veil Peak stood the stele of Yu the Great’s flood-control efforts, inscribed in tadpole script. Beneath the stele, a stone altar was encircled by flowing water, a scene of surpassing beauty. Purple Canopy Peak was often graced by cranes alighting on its summit, where sacred mushrooms and numinous herbs grew. Below, in a stone chamber, stood an incense burner, pestle and mortar, and a cinnabar cauldron. Atop Zhurong Peak was a jade altar, five *chi* square, and to its east grew a purple pear tree, over three hundred *chi* tall, planted by the Xia Emperor Yu. Its fruit was as large as a *dou*, red as the sun, and whoever ate it would attain longevity and immortality. During the Yixi era, the mountain man Pan Jue reached the peak, where the stone split open and a substance like purple mud emerged, fragrant and soft enough to eat. Unaware that it was stone marrow, Pan did not consume it and discarded it. When he realized his mistake and returned, it was gone. This lord’s records of sacred marvels were extraordinary, and he could command spirits and gods, subdue dragons and tigers. In the ninth month of the ninth day of the first year of Yuanhui of the Song, and again in the first year of Chongzhen of Emperor Huizong’s reign, he was bestowed the title *Perfected of the Luminous Grotto and Subtle Dao*. Today, the foundation of the palace still bears a stone stele. Tradition holds that in the past, an immortal parrot would herald the dawn, but after eating the immortal herb, it became deathless. A woodcutter once saw it but could not capture it. In the seventh year of Dali, Master Xuanhe Zhang Taikong, the teacher of Li Mi, resided there. After attaining the Dao, he underwent liberation by means of the corpse at Yuanyang Palace. In the first year of Dazhong, Han Weiyi, admiring the Perfected’s wind, dwelled there to cultivate the Dao and likewise attained it.

The Stone Chamber of Hidden Perfection lies between Upper Clarity and Yuanyang. Cedar and pine flank the path, and the cliffs and peaks are as blue as indigo. There are two stone chambers, originally the dens of tigers and leopards. In the first year of Dazhong of the Tang, Master Liu Yuanjing resided there. He performed the rites of the Dipper, trod the steps of the stars, and drove away the tigers and leopards, clearing the brambles and thorns to make his abode. Han Ye, the prefect of Hengzhou, donated his salary to build the Hall of Assembly for the Perfected. He opened the stone chambers, channeled springs to flow around them, felled trees, cut thatch, carved a tea cauldron, set up a chessboard, established an altar for offerings, and arranged a mortar for medicine, a basin, a bed, lamps, and ritual vessels—all naturally formed. During the Huichang era, he was summoned to the palace to transmit the dharma and was enfeoffed as Master of Vast Accomplishment. After a long time, he begged to return to the mountains. In the winter of the tenth month of the fifth year of Dazhong, sacred cranes descended repeatedly. Soon after, he departed this world, and celestial music was heard amid the floating clouds. On the day of his ascension, only his staff and sandals remained. His disciple Lü Zhizhen inherited his Dao. The Assistant Minister of War, Xiao Ye, composed his stele inscription; the Assistant Minister of Personnel, Zhao Lu, wrote his biography; the Grand Master for Court Audiences, Lu Fan, composed the *Inscription for the Stone Chamber*; and the Daoist Zhang Jianbai wrote his *Inner Biography*. Today, only the *Inner Biography* and the spirit-way stele remain, housed in the Bureau of Selection and Virtue. The foundations of the site still exist.

The Central Palace, located seven *li* northeast of the temple, was built during the Tianjian era of the Liang. It was the place where the Perfected Wang Lingyu cultivated the Dao. Wang was a native of Jinling. Precocious in his youth, he never married or pursued an official career, devoting himself wholeheartedly to the Dao. He bid farewell to his family and friends and built a hut at the foot of the Five Elders Peak.

Having gained some insight, one evening a divine being suddenly appeared to him, saying: "One who seeks the Dao—if not in the proper place—is like planting the five grains amid the sands; they cannot bear fruit. Though one may possess the bones for ascending in flight, without a blessed site and numinous altar, transformation remains impossible. Though one may accumulate virtue to enrich the land and amass merit to grow wings, if the place is not right, demonic forces will undermine one’s efforts, and the Dao shall never be attained."

Lingyu asked, "Where, then, may I dwell?"

The divine being replied, "Upon the summit of Vermilion Numinance, beside the neighboring peak of Purple Canopy—there you may ascend to heaven."

Thereupon, he left Mount Lu and took up residence in the Central Palace of the Southern Marchmount, where he cultivated the Dao for twelve years. When his practice reached fulfillment, he moved again to the east of Vermilion Numinance. Facing the Dipper, he refined his true nature. On the twelfth day of the seventh month in the thirteenth year of the Tianjian era, he ascended in broad daylight.

In the first year of the Chonghe era, Emperor Huizong bestowed upon him the title *Perfected of Pervasive Emptiness and Gathered Vacuity*.

Earlier, in the early Tianbao era of the Tang, Dong Fengxian had resided there, practicing the Nine-Flower Elixir Method and attaining the Dao. He dwelled long in Hengyang, abiding in the rear grotto of Vermilion Numinance. During the Yuanhe era, Feng Weiliang also cultivated the Dao in this place. Their biographies are recorded in the following scroll.

In the Dali era of the Tang, Master Li Delin cultivated the Dao and attained it here, though the palace had long since fallen into ruin.

**Palace of Primordial Yang**
The Palace of Primordial Yang lies five *li* northeast of the temple, rising up the mountain. Together with the Upper Clarity Central Palace, they stand like the legs of a tripod.

During the Taishi era of the Jin, Perfected Chen, whose given name was Xingming, made this his place of cultivation. In his youth, the Perfected wandered among the famous mountains. While seeking transcendents at the summit of Heavenly Pillar Peak, he encountered a divine being, a youth of eighteen or nineteen, who declared: "I have traversed the four seas, measuring the resolve of those with aspiration. Those who cultivate the Dao in the world may briefly attain single-minded devotion, yet halfway abandon their efforts, never persevering to the end. How then could they lift their forms to the clouded heavens or soar their spirits to the empyrean? Your refined merit is commendable, yet you must not falter. What cause is there to fear your name will not be inscribed in the Golden Portals and Jade Halls?"

The path of hardship before ease—hardship has its limit, while ease knows no bounds. Why is this so? Dwelling in secluded valleys, making one’s home in the wilderness, beasts and fowl as one’s only companions, hunger and thirst inevitable, enduring the toils of cold and heat, severing worldly ties and forsaking glory, parting from kin and abandoning love—this may indeed be called hardship. Yet to live as long as heaven and earth, to know endless transformation, to ride the void and mount the empty air, to grow wings at will—this may truly be called ease. How then could one not strive with diligence in cultivation?

Xingming bowed deeply and said: “I shall forever bear these sacred words in mind, and devote myself wholly to the Dao, never daring to grow lax.”

Thereupon, he was transmitted the Dao of the Luminous Mirror, which he practiced for eighteen years. Two immortals descended and declared to him: “We once bestowed upon you the supreme Dao, and you have indeed cultivated it with diligence. Now you ascend to the Nine Heavens, roam and feast across the Eight Seas—this is the reward of your accumulated merit. The principle of hardship before ease has now reached its fulfillment in you.”

On the first day of the third month in the first year of Taikang of the Jin, mist and rosy clouds enveloped his distant chamber, celestial music drifted through the sky, mountains and rivers stood in solemn clarity. Those who came to observe found only an empty chamber. Even his parrot and dog had ascended with him.

In the first year of Chonghe, Emperor Huizong bestowed upon him the title *Perfected of Emptiness and Quiescence*.

Moreover, in the Tang dynasty, Master Zhang Xuanhe resided here. Emperor Dezong composed an imperial inscription for him, which read:

“The supreme Dao is nameless—yet we provisionally employ names to honor the Dao. The supreme Perfection is formless—yet we must seek form to manifest the Perfection. Only when merit is complete may it be truly called real. Thus, the Daoist of Yuanyang Palace on Southern Peak, Zhang Taixu, who nurtured the primordial essence and delved into the profound mystery beyond mystery, refined his bones in the Three Clarities and preserved his spirit in the Eight Sceneries. Cultivating virtue upon Heng Peak, he neared a century in years. He wandered in darkness, seeking the formless, and embraced the primordial chaos in tranquil practice. Dwelling in seclusion, he preserved his true form with utmost austerity. Recently, at the imperial decree to exalt the wondrous Dao, the carriage of black cranes descended, and he was vested in robes of purple aurora. I have esteemed the words of my assisting ministers, and the lofty footsteps of this immortal remain ever in my thoughts. Though I regret we did not live in the same era, I now express my admiration and bestow this illustrious command: let his name be inscribed to proclaim his virtue, that it may endure without end. He is hereby posthumously honored as *Master of Mystic Harmony*.”

On the thirteenth day of the sixth month in the fourth year of Zhenyuan, he underwent liberation by means of the corpse and departed from Lingyin Peak.

The palace was renovated during the Chunhua, Tiansheng, and Zhenghe reigns of the present dynasty. In the first year of Xuanhe, it was renamed Chongming Abbey. Three *li* behind the abbey lies Crouching Tiger Crag.

**Tianzhen Cloister**
Tianzhen Cloister stands two *li* southeast of Yuanyang Palace, built during the Baoli era of the Tang. Green bamboo and verdant pines enfold the Three Clarities and stone statues on all sides. A hundred paces north of the hall lies a small crag, where Master Tian often rested. Upon the crag grows a pine tree called the Canopy Pine. Its roots and branches twist and coil, its limbs extending leftward. Though the crag’s expanse is broad, a single tree shades it entirely.

During the Kaihuang era, Tian Liangyi, whose given name was Xuying, a native of Qi, moved with his parents from You County and settled on Xiyang Peak of Southern Peak. He tilled the land and sold firewood to support his mother, and at night, he sat alone upon the crag. One day, he set his mind free to wander the Five Peaks and encountered Master He, from whom he sought the Dao. His mother, meanwhile, was drying clothes on the northern slope when she heard her son had gone far away. She hastened after him, but unable to catch up, she turned back—only to find the clothes had turned to stone. To this day, centuries later, the stone garments remain unchanged, as pure and white as they were at first. Below lies a small crag where his mother often rested, sitting there for days on end. She wore black garments and ate only vegetables. After his mother passed away while seated there, his resolve grew even firmer. Later, he met Xue Jichang, who transmitted the teachings to him, and he entered Tiantai, never to emerge again.

Emperor Xianzong summoned him, but he did not rise. Later, he underwent liberation by means of the corpse.

During the Xuanhe era of the present dynasty, a fire ravaged the site, leaving only the Three Pure Ones stone statues intact. In the Shaoxing period, a small hall was rebuilt, where Daoist practitioners have maintained their devotions without interruption to this day.

**North Emperor Abbey**
North Emperor Abbey lies half a mile behind the Quande Temple, surrounded by dense groves of tall bamboo and towering pines. At the close of the Tianjian era of the Liang dynasty, the female Daoist Master Xu practiced cultivation here and attained the Dao. By the end of the Zhenguan era, Zhang Huiming restored the abbey and, after receiving transmission from Lady Shiying of Mount Nanyue, practiced the method of embracing the One and harmonizing the Three and Five, later achieving liberation by means of the corpse. Another adept, Li Simu, also resided here and attained the Dao. During the Taiping Xingguo era of the Song, the abbey was granted an imperial plaque, though it has since fallen into disrepair.

**Lingxu Palace**
Lingxu Palace stands eight *li* east of the temple, descending from the southern slope of Huagai Peak. It was first constructed in the early Tianbao era of the Tang. The Daoist Master Xue, known as Jichang, once dwelled here in a thatched hut. Emperor Minghuang summoned him to reside at the Jiuzhen Jiangsheng Abbey, where he presented a copy of the *Dao De Jing* and composed the *Treatise on the Subtle and Mysterious*. The emperor exchanged written replies with him over a dozen times. Later, Master Xue declined all honors and begged to return to his humble abode. One evening, he told his disciples, "The air tonight is strange; I must depart." He then ascended into the void and vanished. Later, Hua Youqi traveled from western Shu, visiting the twenty-four sacred sites along the Yangtze and Xiang Rivers before paying homage to the Red Lord here. Concealing his name, he cultivated the Dao and annotated the *Scripture of the Numinous Treasure* upon a stone platform beneath the Five Peaks. Fragrant mist, like incense smoke, curled around the platform, dissipating only after he completed his work. Moved by such divine resonance, the site was named Heavenly Fragrance Platform, and he later achieved liberation by means of the corpse. During the Huichang era, Zhou Hunwu arrived from Jiuzhen and took up residence, eventually attaining the Dao and becoming the master of the Great Luo Abbey. Before the palace stands a natural stone altar for rituals, along with a sword-testing stone and a spring for bathing elixirs. In the late Shaoxing period, the palace was relocated downslope, though only five to seven parts of its reconstruction were completed, leaving it unfinished.

**Dongling Palace**
Dongling Palace lies eighteen *li* northeast of the temple, descending from the eastern slope of Zigai Peak. At the close of the Eastern Jin, Deng Yuzhi, styled Yanda, resided here. While reciting scriptures upon the Dongling Terrace, he encountered Lady Wei, who transmitted the teachings to him. Through their practice, he attained the Dao, and the site became one of the twenty-five grotto-heavens of the Dongling blessed land. An ancient poem reads:
*The Dongling source connects to the Dongyang heavens,*
*Where jagged ravines and perilous peaks shroud the earth in crimson mist.*
*Once, treading fallen blossoms, I heard jade flutes,*
*By the Red Pine’s altar, where cranes cry at the spring.*

The palace was first built by the Li family of the Jin, and the Celestial Master resided here to attain the Dao. The two immortals, Peng and Cai, once concealed themselves here. In the late Tang, the adept Nie Shidao encountered them. Today, peach groves flank the site, along with tea gardens and groves of citrus and pomelo. Before the palace once stood an ancient maple, its trunk soaring several *zhang* high, its roots twisting into the shape of a colossal tortoise—head, tail, limbs, and shell all vividly lifelike. Visitors marveled at it, and the palace’s halls and huts stood in awe of its presence. Since the chaos of the Five Dynasties, the site has suffered repeated fires, leaving the mountain desolate and remote. In the late Daguan era of the present dynasty, the eunuch Wang Mensi donated gold and silk to rebuild it. The halls, temples, and thatched huts were restored to their former glory, and the reclusive adepts who dwell here are no fewer than before. To the northeast lie Peach Blossom Spring and Crane Cry Spring, rarely visited by travelers. On the western bank is an inscription of Zhang Yuanhua’s *Rhapsody on the Returned Elixir*. Below lies the Herb-Washing Pool, and to the east stands the Altar for Greeting the Dipper.

**Zhaoxian Abbey**
Zhaoxian Abbey lies eight *li* east of the temple. According to old records, its foundation was divined by Liu Zong during the Xiao Qi dynasty. Another account states it was built during the Xianheng era of the Jin. The Celestial Master Zhang, whose given name was Tanyao, once resided here.

The adept’s profound meditation drew the secret descent of celestial perfected ones, who transmitted the Dao of internal cultivation, harmonizing the primordial and silently paying homage to the Great Emperor. After twelve years of practice, his spirit roamed the vast heavens to attend the August Ultimate. The Great Emperor bestowed upon him the Jade Fruit and the Elixir of Langgan, a fluid blending spirit and radiance. Upon consuming it, his transformations became unfathomable, his spiritual efficacy boundless and equal to the Dao.

On the third day of the seventh month in the first year of the Yanxing era, thunder suddenly roared, the earth trembled, and in an instant, phoenixes and cranes with cinnabar melodies welcomed him as he ascended to heaven. In the first year of the Chonghe era, Emperor Huizong of the Song bestowed upon him the title *Baoguang Ximing Zhenren* (Perfected One Who Preserves Light and Inherits Illumination).

In the second year of the Zhenguan era, the Luoling monk Xiao, whose given name was Linghu, came to reside here. He refined the arts of alchemical transmutation and established external alms halls, restoring the abbey’s structures. In five years, he built the Pavilion for Seeking the True, and in the sixth year, the renchen year, he cast a bronze bell weighing five hundred *jin* in Guizhou. Upon its return to the abbey, it was struck five times in succession, for fear of startling the dark spirits of the netherworld. Thereafter, he refined the elixir north of the mountain, completing it only after three attempts. He consumed it and achieved *shijie* (liberation through apparent death) on the Mid-Autumn Festival of the second year of the Hongdao era.

At the end of the Yuanhe era, a certain Xu Que arrived from Mount Emei and inscribed a record on the beam. Often deeply intoxicated, he would sing long ballads, and in his inscriptions—once mentioning "the reclining moon"—none could fathom what the "reclining moon" might be. He also inscribed verses on the hall’s walls, the final lines reading:
*"Deng Tong starved to death, Yan Guang died in poverty—*
*Are emperors truly powerless men?*
*If a man has not yet risen, do not cling too close;*
*Climbing dragons and clinging to wings wastes the spirit."*

At the end of the Danggong era, just after the fifth watch, a bell toll suddenly resounded, startling all who heard it. At dawn, they found the bell cracked. Within ten days, a Daoist in tattered hempen robes arrived, claiming he could repair it but required several thousand *jin* of fire. Charcoal was burned to forge the bell, and the Daoist molded the molten bronze at the crack with his palm, the flames dimming of their own accord. The onlookers watched in awe. The Daoist then went to the stream to wash his hands and vanished without a trace. To this day, the imprint of his hand remains on the bell—a truly numinous marvel.

During the late Tang, Nie Shidao sought the Three Perfected Ones of Peng and Cai. In the Renzong era of the Song, the Master of Plain Silk was dispatched by imperial decree to reside here, later entering Mount Heng’s abbey before achieving *shijie*. During the Xuanhe era, the reclusive Wu Chengyuan, admiring his legacy, built the Pavilion for Nurturing Simplicity.

The abbey once had the Distant Azure Pavilion, the Vying Beauty Pavilion, and the Altar for Facing Heaven. Two *li* to the north lies the Snow Wave Pavilion, the Grotto of Perfected Washing, where a waterfall cascades from the cave. A massive boulder juts precipitously, and atop the cliff sits a stone pool shaped like a cauldron, over a *zhang* in circumference and unfathomably deep. A single stream plunges down like a silk curtain, known as the third of the Thirty-Six Grotto-Heavens of the Vermilion Mound. There is also a stone well, its depths bottomless, piercing through to four gates.

The ravine’s flow spans barely twenty *li*, yet forms this suspended torrent. From the upper stream to the middle pool, it descends nine *ren*; from the middle pool into the valley, another eighteen *ren*. There lies the Coiling Darkness Cliff, four mats in width, where waves surge like snow and thunderous rains suddenly descend. Even Mount Tiantai and Mount Emei cannot match this grandeur.

Below lies the Pool for Casting Dragons, where the state’s grand jiao rituals conclude with the casting of golden dragons. The stone altar slightly parts, and celestial music is heard. Fang Lanxi inscribed a poem on the Water Curtain Grotto, one couplet reading:
*"In the Kaiyuan era, golden dragons were cast,*
*Beneath the waters, the music of heaven was heard."*

If travelers approach with sincere and purified hearts, gazing intently, they may glimpse faint glimmers of golden thrones and jade mechanisms. During the Zhidao era, a pregnant woman touched it, and the stone cliff gradually sealed shut, revealing nothing. Visitors’ verses and odes fill the walls to overflowing. Only Luoling’s Li Yuanfu composed a poem surpassing all others:
*"A slice of cassia-green cliff,*
*Distinct, untouched by dust.*
*Compressed into pearl-white droplets,*
*It hangs down like a jade rope.*
*Wild gulls struggle to fly in,*
*Mountain winds cannot unfurl it."*

The echoes resound, departing toward the sea,
Unbound by the barriers of peaks and crags.
Its lines are pure, its style robust—
All who read it bow in admiration.

In the first month of the tenth year of Zhenghe, Zhang Huiyan of Jian’an, serving as Transport Commissioner of the region, inspected the circuit from Xiangtan toward the Yue Shrine. When he was three or four *li* away, he noticed to the left of the road a dense grove of pines and trailing vines, within which stood a grand and magnificent gate. A vermilion plaque bore the large characters: *Zhuling*. Inside the palace gate, pavilions and towers loomed, and a figure stood at the threshold, as if awaiting someone. As the sun was already setting, he had no time to explore and resolved to return another day.

On the fifth day of the ninth month of the second year, returning from Hengzhou, he lodged at Shengye Chan Monastery. Speaking with the abbot, monk Jingxiang, he said, “Tomorrow morning, let us visit Zhuling together.” Jingxiang replied, “East of this temple lies Zhaoxian Abbey, and behind it, the Zhuling Grotto.” Zhang recalled, “Last year, I passed the Zhuling Palace and saw its towering gate with its vermilion plaque, each character a foot tall. I regretted not visiting it then. Now that I have returned, I am deeply intent on doing so.”

The next morning, they went together to Zhaoxian Abbey. Passing the place he had seen before, he found nothing—only empty mountains. When they reached the Zhuling Grotto, they turned to face a stone cliff where a waterfall stood still, yet no buildings remained. Inquiring, the Daoist priests said, “There has never been such a palace or gate here.” How strange! This resembles the vastness of Tiantai’s Fangguang Peak or the sacred bamboo grove of Shengzhulin Monastery.

Zhang recorded this in his journal. Later, the abbot, Daoist Wang Yuandong, built Wangxian Pavilion at the site and erected a palace gate. Magistrate Qian Jingheng inscribed the three characters *Zhuling Gong* in vermilion to serve as the plaque. Later, Wangjuan Bridge Abbey was established, housing a bronze statue of the Heavenly Worthy of Life Protection. During the Xianheng era of the Jin, a stone statue of Lord Lao and his attendants was cast, and all were built at the same time. The old abbey stood at the mouth of the grotto, but at the end of the Tang, it was relocated outside, and a separate hall was built for the Jade Emperor of Primordial Beginning to share the same sanctuary. Some say that because the Tang revered Lord Lao as their sacred ancestor, they placed the Jade Emperor’s hall to the right.

In the first year of Xuanhe, the name was changed to its current title.

**Nine Perfections Abbey**

Nine Perfections Abbey lies ten *li* east of the shrine. According to old records, it was built by the Master of Xinye during the Taikang era of the Jin. At the beginning of the Tianyou era, the Perfected Zhang Ruzhen resided there. Zhang was a fellow townsman of the Master. From childhood, he spoke little and remained detached from worldly concerns. In his prime, he dwelled in seclusion, possessing an innate spiritual disposition. One day, a divine being descended into his rocky chamber and transmitted to him the Dao of the Luminous Mirror of the Grotto, instructing him to cultivate it:

*“That which illumines the principles of things is Heaven.*
*That which reflects the forms of things is the Dao.*
*The Dao of Heaven is to be clear; the Dao of the mirror is to be bright and discerning, without distortion.*
*When this is fixed upon one thing, it responds to another.*
*Thus, the shapes of rivers and mountains, the emotions of ghosts and spirits—none can escape or hide.*
*Heaven, in its clarity, embraces the myriad things; water, in its stillness, reflects all forms.*
*If one cultivates the clarity of Heaven and the brightness of the mirror, calming the heart and settling the spirit to achieve inner and outer transparency, then the supreme Dao is attained.*
*But if one is externally enslaved by things and internally wearied by the spirit, the heart and spirit become dull and turbid, unable to attain clarity—then one drifts far from the Dao.*
*This method was once received by me from Lord Changsang, who in turn received it from the Heavenly Emperor of Taiwei.*
*If you master what you have obtained, you will penetrate the mysteries and see clearly to the eight ends of the earth.*
*The method of penetrating reality contains the Dao of the Four Regulations, practiced in accordance with the four seasons—this is of the same essence.”*

The ancients said: *“Empty your chamber, and whiteness will arise of itself; settle your heart, and the Dao will come of itself.”* How true this is!

Ruzhen cultivated this for nine years, achieving a vision so clear that nothing within a thousand *li* could remain hidden. On the eighteenth day of the eleventh month of the thirteenth year of Tianjian of the Liang, he wandered alone into the mountains. After three days, he did not return. His disciples searched for him and found him already clad in immortal robes, ascending in a cloud-borne chariot accompanied by flutes and drums, vanishing into the misty heavens.

In the first year of Chonghe, Emperor Huizong bestowed upon him the title *Perfected of Complete Reality and Penetrating Dao*.

At the beginning of the Kaiyuan era, Sima Chengzhen, styled Ziming, traveled from Haishan by boat to refine his truth on Mount Heng. He built a hut a *li* north of the abbey and named it White Cloud. The Chancellor Zhang Jiuling visited him repeatedly. Emperor Minghuang sent his younger brother, Chengzhang, to summon him, and together they corrected the *Daode Jing*. The emperor treated him with great courtesy, addressing him as “Daoist Brother.” All the offerings in the abbey—gold and silver vessels—were bestowed by imperial decree. Edicts and responses, calligraphy and letters, flowed without cease.

At the beginning of the Tianbao era, Xue Jichang of Shu, who had previously annotated the *Daode Jing* in two fascicles on Mount Emei, later retired to the peak of Huagai on Mount Heng. There, he composed the *Xuanwei Lun* in three fascicles and the *Ode to the Great Dao*. He had his disciple Wang Xianjiao transcribe and present them. The emperor issued an edict for him to reside at Jiangzhen Abbey, providing him with imperial vessels and calligraphy, with edicts and responses unending. Later, at Nine Perfections Abbey, he oversaw the creation of a statue of the Sacred Ancestor, the Heavenly Dao, and Lord Lao the Emperor, along with thirteen attendant figures. The statue, including its base, stood seventeen feet tall, accompanied by 670 fascicles of scriptures.

Xianjiao was originally a Daoist novice at the abbey. By nature, he was indifferent to worldly concerns, and upon reading the *Biographies of the Immortals*, he adopted a manner beyond the mundane. He once remarked, *“Beyond the Five Thousand Words, all is but clay figurines.”* Carrying tea from Mount Heng, he entered the capital to teach and spread virtue. He often served tea within the city gates. One day, he encountered Gao Lishi, who, struck by his appearance, asked where he had come from. Xianjiao replied, *“I am a novice from Nine Perfections Abbey on Mount Heng. The abbey’s halls have fallen into disrepair, so I have brought tea to humbly seek benefactors.”* Pleased by his words, Gao Lishi reported this to Emperor Minghuang, who summoned him. The emperor, delighted by his refined and elegant demeanor, asked, *“Do you have any wishes?”* Xianjiao replied, *“I wish for a flourishing state and a prosperous Dao.”* The emperor was pleased and ordered him to bow to Master Sima as his teacher. He was then invested in the inner palace, generously rewarded, and sent back to the mountain. That night, he dreamed of the Perfected Chen Shaowei, from whom he received the essentials of the Dao. Later, he was commanded to attend Master Sima at Wangwu Mountain. After some time, he memorialized, *“My revered teacher ascended as an immortal in the twenty-third year of Kaiyuan. I request that his former residence on Mount Heng be converted into an abbey.”*

Having received the imperial favor of an inscribed plaque, an edict was issued appointing Xue Jichang as abbot. The Jiangsheng Abbey was bestowed with sacred images and ritual vessels. In the twelfth year of Tianbao, the emperor further commanded Hengzhou to cast a bronze bell, which was granted to the abbey. Its resonant tones carried far, piercing the heavens. Weighing four thousand catties, it bore the reign title of Emperor Minghuang, with an imperial inscription that read:

*"Cast in the prefecture, hung in the abbey,
Enduring as heaven and earth,
Boundless in blessing."*

The bell was overseen in its casting by Generalissimo Gao Lishi. Truly, it was a treasure of the southern peak. Later, in the third year of Qianyuan, amid the chaos of war and fire, the abbey was razed to the ground, its iron and stone melted in the flames—only this bell remained, as if by the power of vows it had endured thus. In the Xiantong era, Wang Gujie, whose Daoist practice and conduct surpassed all others, was revered throughout the region. He restored the abbey anew, and as he expounded the teachings and discoursed on the scriptures, scholars gathered like a marketplace. By imperial decree, he was summoned to the Northern Peak and enfeoffed as Grand Master of the Assembly.

Again, during the Yuanyou period, the bell vanished for several days before being found one day in the pond before the abbey, its surface stained with moss. The dragon atop the bell had lost its right foreclaw, and it was once more installed in the bell tower. Tradition holds that it had battled the dragon of Qingcao Ford. Behind the abbey lies Dragon’s True Ridge, and a mile away stands Martial Grove. Master Xie later restored the White Cloud Hermitage and took up residence there. He and Cao Daochong were companions in poetry and the zither. Daochong wrote:

*"A man of Martial Grove at Peach Spring’s mouth,
Twenty springs he leapt beyond the red dust.
Delighting in the deep joys of white clouds,
Unknowing if the green-eyed one draws near.
Cinnabar now submits to the earthen furnace,
Jade nectar first brews in the Water Cauldron."*

Beyond the single zither of scorched tailwood, three feet of blue altar bow to the southern stars.

To the west lies the Wang family’s medicinal hut. Wang, having long resided there, later moved to Lingyan, where he achieved liberation through the corpse atop Cloud-Dragon Peak.

Fifty paces north of the abbey’s corner stands Longevity Mountain Pavilion. Beneath it flows White Tortoise Spring, the foremost spring of South Mountain. The water gushes from a cliff’s crevice, clear and sweet, its hue shifting with morning and evening. Even among South Mountain’s famed springs, none surpass it. Those who drink it remain free of illness and live long. Within dwells a white tortoise, the size of a coin, white as jade, concealed among the stone treasures—rarely seen by men. Whoever encounters it meets good fortune and prolonged life. Tradition says: when the tortoise emerges, an immortal arrives; when it withdraws, the immortal departs.

Many poems have been inscribed here, but only the recluse Huangfu Huan’s endures:

*"The numinous terrace knows no end to dust,
Yet when dust ceases, it is no longer numinous.
I love this single pool of water,
Where once a spirit-being came to dwell."*

In recent years, I chose this place to build my hermitage. Five *li* north of the spring, while gathering herbs, I often rested at this pavilion, marveling at its wonders. I mused: in the vastness of the cosmos, among all the true immortals who have concealed themselves or transformed through white tortoises, this is the third such site.

I have resolved to spend my autumn years on this mountain, making it my final abode. Thrice I moved my dwelling to the eastern slopes of Zhu Ling, clearing the Wang family’s old medicinal garden to settle. By chance, I became a neighbor to this spring—no mere coincidence. Thus I composed a quatrain, which I inscribe here:

*"Three white tortoises revealed in the world:
Yi Mountain, Shaoshi, and Longevity Immortal Pavilion.
Now I build my hut atop South Mountain’s crest,
Gaining you as neighbor, I pray for the emperor’s long life."*

The abbey holds the Nine Immortals Pavilion. Behind it once stood the Langying Pavilion, renamed in the first year of the *Chonghe* era to its current title, *Shouning*.

**Descending Sage Abbey**
*Jiangsheng Abbey*, one *li* from Nine Perfections Abbey, was formerly called White Cloud Hermitage, where Sima Ziwei cultivated the Dao. At the petition of his disciple Wang Xianjiao, the hermitage was redesignated an abbey in honor of his late master. The new plaque was bestowed, and the calligraphy freshly carved, with Xue Jichang of Nine Perfections Abbey appointed as concurrent abbot.

**Nine Immortals Palace**
*Nine Immortals Palace*, twelve *li* east of the temple, was built during the *Tianjian* era of the Liang dynasty. Once, Wang Lingyu, having completed his alchemical practices in the central palace, moved here after Zhou Chongji’s passing. He gazed at the Dipper, contemplating the subtle. One day, the celestial immortals came to welcome him.

Additionally, there was Deng Yu of Xinye in Nanyang. In his youth, he dreamed of a crow that spat out a seal and gave it to him. Thereafter, whenever he heard of someone afflicted by illness, he would use the seal to heal them, inscribing talismans that brought spontaneous recovery. Later, he formed a bond of transcendental friendship with Xu Lingqi, and together they roamed famous mountains in search of eminent adepts. There, he encountered a perfected being who transmitted to him the art of the Golden Crucible and Great Dragon. In the second year of the *Yuanhui* era of the Song, after Xu ascended, Deng Yu withdrew into the Cavern Gate. After a long sojourn, he wandered beyond the lakes, traversing every grotto-heaven and blessed land. Yet he lacked the means to procure the ingredients for his elixir.

At that time, an official memorial reported that the Lesser Aster had been sighted in the southern regions of Chu. Emperor Wu, seizing the opportunity of the Inspector-General’s tour of inspection, summoned him to the audience hall and inquired into his practice. Deng Yu replied, “This poor Daoist refines the Golden Fluid, but lacks the materials for the elixir.” The emperor bestowed gold and silk upon him and permitted him to select a secluded and propitious site within the Cavern of Perfection and Blessed Land of Mount Nanyue, establishing three palaces—upper, middle, and lower—to cultivate both inner and outer elixirs.

One evening, a divine being addressed him, saying, “The neighbor of the Great Cavern is a realm that summons fortune and a land that extends life. Remember this well.” Later, after his elixir was completed, he moved to the eastern slopes of Purple Canopy Peak. On the thirteenth day of the twelfth month in the final year of the *Tianjian* era of the Liang, eight perfected beings descended into his chamber in feathered canopies and cloud chariots—these were the same eight immortals who had previously attained the Dao. Thereupon, he ascended to heaven from a natural stone altar.

In the first year of the *Chonghe* era, Emperor Huizong bestowed upon him the title *Chaozhen Jimiao Zhenren* (Transcendent Perfected One Who Collects Wondrous Essence). In the ninth year of the *Xiantong* era of the Tang, Zhang Guan, the prefect of Hengzhou, submitted a memorial requesting the establishment of an abbey plaque. In the tenth month of the tenth year, an imperial edict approved the petition.

Furthermore, during the *Kaiyuan* era, Emperor Minghuang bestowed an imperial inscription in his own calligraphy, reading: *Nine Immortals Palace at the Stone Altar of Purple Canopy Peak*. A former worthy once composed a poem on *Nine Immortals Palace*, of which a fragment remains:
*A peak unfolds in scales to open an abbey,*
*A single stone gleams to welcome nine immortals.*
*The treasure plaque still bears the Minghuang’s script,*
*The numinous dream once spread by the censor’s tale.*

During the *Jingyou* era, the former Academician of the Hall of Literary Studies, Sun Mian, was serving as censor when he offended the emperor and was demoted to Yongzhou. In a dream, a Daoist entrusted him with a field. Later, when he was transferred to Tanzhou and offered sacrifices at the mountain, he sought out the figure from his dream and found an image of Master Wang in *Nine Immortals Palace*. He then issued an order to the county to investigate the abbey’s fields, which had indeed been encroached upon and cultivated by a neighboring abbey.

In the first year of the *Xuanhe* era, the abbey was redesignated with its current plaque. Behind it lies the Great Cavern, now called the Front Cavern. The foundations of *Danxia Hermitage* remain.

**Radiant Heaven Abbey**
*Radiant Heaven Abbey*, thirty-five *li* north of the temple along the ascent, is recorded in the *Record of Blessed Lands* as the twenty-second *Radiant Heaven Altar Blessed Land*. The *Anthology of Cavern Abysses* contains a poem:
*The Supreme Ultimate divides its form, shaped like an altar,*
*White clouds seal the path through sheer cliffs.*
*Abiding in timeless spring’s embrace,*
*Its radiance illumines our sovereign’s mountain of longevity.*

**Peaceful Treasure Abbey**
*Peaceful Treasure Abbey*, thirty-five *li* northwest of the temple along the ascent, is the site where a transcendent awaited the immortals by drilling a hole in stone to obtain celestial scriptures. The forests are dense, though the abbey has long since fallen into ruin.

**Seeking the True Abbey**
*Seeking the True Abbey*, ninety *li* from the temple in the north of Hengyang city, commands the great river. A stone drum stands there, and the rear cavern is the western gate of *Zhuling*. It is the place where the Tang Daoist Bai Zhenren and Master Dong the Refiner ascended in flight. The immortal Shi Ke composed a poem for the *Hall of the Ascending Immortal*, while Lei Chenghao, acting on imperial command, wrote a poem on Hengyang in full:
*Hengyang lies three thousand* li *from here,*
*The journey’s path is smooth and plain.*
*Beyond the three lands of Chu, its gates stand deep,*
*Before the Five Peaks, its pure winds gather.*
*To the west, merchants flock from the marketplace,*
*To the east, fishing boats cluster like isles on the shoals.*
*When your duties end, what else remains?*
*To seek the immortals in the rear cavern of Zhuling.*

According to the *Records of the Xiang River*, this stone drum sometimes sounds of its own accord, heralding the outbreak of war. Some say that Lu Long pushed the drum into the deep. The name Lu Long remains obscure, though today, upon inspection, it is also called the *Lu Long Abbey*, though its founding era is unknown. In the eighth month of the first year of the *Longxiang* era, the prefectural official urged the Daoist Guo Xingzhen to perform rites at the mountain, during which the abbey was destroyed and its sacrifices discontinued. Thereafter, the region suffered calamities, and the local people restored its worship.

In the fifth year of the *Zhenguan* era, the former minister of Qi built the *Confluence Pavilion* atop this mountain. The Tang poet Du Xunhe composed a poem titled *Inscribed at Seeking the True Abbey*:
*Silent the gate of white clouds,*
*Seeking the true, I meet no true one.*
*Only the crane perched in the pines—*
*That must be the cavern’s dweller.*
*Strange the fragrance of the medicinal garden,*
*Fresh the deer tracks in the sands by the spring.*
*I leave my name in a poem,*
*That we may meet again here someday.*

During the *Dazhong Xiangfu* era, Shi Zhongyuan, styled Qingzong, a master from the *Xixia Cavern* of Guilin, took up residence as abbot. His Daoist practice was peerless, his poetic talent renowned in Chu. He renovated the abbey entirely, rebuilding the *White Cloud Pavilion*, which overlooks the *Green Grass Ford*. Before it stand the *Hall of White Clouds* and the *Pool of White Clouds*.

In the *Bingyin* year of the *Shaoxing* era, I spent the summer here and composed forty characters for the hall, though they do not suffice to rival the former worthies. They merely record the affairs of *Zhuling*:
*I love the realm of Xiao and Xiang,*
*The abbey faces the gate of Xiao and Xiang, the rear cavern of Zhuling.*
*Guests gather in the Hall of White Clouds,*
*Sleep by the head of Green Grass Ford.*
*A small boat tows red carp,*
*A secluded pool cultivates white lotuses.*
*This place is fit for nurturing the true,*
*Where wind and moon remain ever unchanged.*

**Samantabhadra Abbey**
*Samantabhadra Abbey*, situated south of *Xianglou Peak* and to the left of the road to Hengyang, was first opened as a mountain retreat during the *Yongming* era of the Qi by the Daoist Xu Sixian and Zhang Zhitan. Later, Zhou Jingzhen took up residence as abbot. Emperor Wu of the Liang revered him as his teacher, and the tides of disciples and visitors—all extraordinary figures from across the seas—flocked to him. The lecture hall thronged like a marketplace, with no day passing in vain. The emperor bestowed upon it the name *Samantabhadra*.

During the Tang, Master Chen Faming resided there to cultivate the Dao. After presenting a qilin and achieving success in the examinations, he was summoned to the palace. Yet he declined all honors and begged to return to the mountains, whereupon he was enfeoffed as *Master of Awakened Perfection*.

**Jade Purity Abbey**
Jade Purity Abbey stands south of Stone Cold Peak, fifteen *li* from the temple by way of the mountain path. It was first established in the *Yongxing* era of the Qi. The Perfected Chen, whose personal name was Huidu, hailed from Yingchuan. Initially dwelling on Mount Mao, he gathered rare herbs to sell, drinking wine without taking food. After several years, he journeyed south to the twin peaks of Tiaoliang, where all was of gold and stone. Arriving at Mount Heng, he chose a secluded and sublime site, then made a covenant with Heaven. As he refined the elixir through the night, he was harassed by ghosts. Thrice he lifted the crucible, hurling stones to crush them, yet his mind remained coiled in stillness. Upon the rock he recited the *Scripture of the Yellow Court* and wore the *Chart of the Five Sacred Peaks’ True Forms*, his resolve growing ever more steadfast. In secret, the Dao responded: unseen forces aided him in capturing *chimei* demons. The miasmic vapors dispersed, and the ghosts trembled in terror, wailing. The Perfected One then commanded them to solidify the stones, swearing to spare their forms if they fled to distant realms. Later, when the elixir was complete, its radiance filled the mountain, illuminating all near and far. After consuming it, on the thirteenth day of the fifth month in the third year of *Yongming*, he ascended to Heaven. In the first year of *Chonghe*, Emperor Huizong bestowed upon him the title *Perfected of Soaring Emptiness and Primordial Wonder*. Today, atop the abbey’s foundations stand the Elixir Terrace, the Demon-Subduing Stone, the Thunder-Racing Wind Cavern, the Scripture-Recitation Altar, and the Elixir Spring.

In later times, a monk established a temple called Brightness upon the abbey’s foundations, but it soon fell into ruin. During the *Qiandao* era of the Song, two Daoists—Deng Shiyong and the lay practitioner Huang Shouzheng—resolved to reopen the mountain. They felled trees, cleared brambles, and attracted the patronage of worthy and virtuous men to rebuild the halls. Their prayers for rain and exorcisms of calamity were all met with response. Hermits dwelling in mountain huts widely embraced the Daoist transformation.

**Cave Radiance Palace**
Cave Radiance Palace lies northwest of Stone Cold Peak, where the Perfected Shi subdued demons and convened with immortals. When Master Chen Faming returned from answering the imperial summons, he opened a grotto here and built an altar. The mountain spirits aided him in secret, and from this peak he gazed south toward Yunyang, performing dawn and dusk rites to the *Cave Scripture*. Later, after consuming the elixir, he transcended in mystery. Today, remnants of the foundations and a few hermitages remain.

**Grotto Gate Abbey**
Grotto Gate Abbey stands west of Stone Cold Peak and south of Pomegranate Peak, twenty *li* from the temple below. The Perfected Shi, whose personal name was Cun and who styled himself Master Hufu (or "the Gourd Child"), was said to have received the *Inner Writings of the Three Sovereigns* from Master Huang Luzi. He mastered the arts of commanding tigers and leopards and the methods of vanishing and transforming his form. For hundreds of years, he appeared and disappeared at will, drawn to the Grotto Gate of Stone Cold Peak as his place of spiritual ascent. He also built a pavilion in a stone chamber west of the peak, which one day became over ten *zhang* in height. Riding a white leopard, he was welcomed by the immortals of the seas and mountains, who gathered here from time to time. The locals admired him, though few could draw near. On the seventh day of the fourth month in the first year of *Yongkang* of the Jin, he ascended to Heaven riding the leopard. In the first year of *Chonghe*, Emperor Huizong bestowed upon him the title *Perfected of Soaring Harmony and Pristine Simplicity*. Later, Master Li Changli of Shu dwelled here for years before wandering to Heavenly Treasure Grotto. Today, only the remnants of the Leopard-Taming Crag remain.

Zhang Jiuling of the Tang, visiting Grotto Gate, inscribed a poem on Master Chen’s Elixir Terrace:
*West of Cock’s Head Peak, the side gate opens wide,*
*Master Chen’s elixir soars to the Terrace of Kalpas.*
*Did he truly swear to bind the ghosts of old?*
*To this day, they speak of the burden they bore.*

**Great Peace Abbey**
Great Peace Abbey lies twenty-five *li* west of the temple, below Waterfall Mountain. Fu Boyu of the Qi recited the *Scripture of Great Peace* and practiced the Way of Great Peace. During the *Jianwu* era, he established Great Peace Abbey. Now long abandoned, it too once had hermitages.

**Western Terrace Abbey**
Western Terrace Abbey stands northwest of Grotto Peak. Tradition holds it was built by King Mu of Zhou. The Chen later renamed it Primordial Beginning Abbey. Some say it was later converted into a temple, but it too has long been abandoned.

**Purple Emptiness Pavilion**
Purple Emptiness Pavilion lies three *li* west of the temple, below the southern slope of Heavenly Pillar Peak. It was built during the *Tianbao* era of the Tang. The Ma clan, who ruled Hunan and Hubei, later restored it. In the *Tiansheng* era of the present dynasty, an imperial edict ordered its reconstruction, though it was still called Wei Pavilion. During the *Jingyou* era, it was bestowed the six-character plaque *Pavilion of the Purple Emptiness Primordial Sovereign*, along with embroidered robes and funds to purchase land for the sustenance of the Daoist community. In the fifth year of *Zhenghe*, it was renamed Yellow Court Abbey.

Beneath the pavilion stands a stone altar. The *Old Records* state that the Lady once flew here from Fuzhou upon it. The *Records of the Xiang Region* say the altar is over a *zhang* high, where the Primordial Sovereign once rested her wind-borne chariot. Master Du the Celestial Master’s *Supplement* describes it as a massive stone, over a square *zhang* in size, broad and round above but tapering and floating below, perched upon another stone. When one person tests it with a push, it sways; when many exert force, it remains steadfast. Pilgrims who come to purify themselves need only press it lightly with a finger to feel it stir. Today, a cave in the mountains of Fuzhou mirrors this stone’s shape. Some say the Serene Emptiness Primordial Sovereign Ma Gu sent the Lady here upon a cloud, and the carriage’s wheels transformed into stone. Others claim Ma Gu’s stone lies on the western mountain of the abbey.

According to the *Inner Transmission*, the Lady’s surname was Wei, her personal name Huacun, and her courtesy name Xian’an. A native of Rencheng, she was the daughter of Wei Shu, Left Chariot Master to Emperor Wu of the Jin. She was enfeoffed as the Purple Emptiness Primordial Sovereign, Controller of Destiny for the Supreme Perfected. She was further granted the title of Mountain Lord, with authority over the feudal lords, and the Serene Emptiness Primordial Sovereign Ma Gu, the Great Immortal, was appointed as her assistant. Today, a statue of Ma Gu stands beside the Lady in the pavilion.

In the fourth year of *Xianhe* of the Jin, the Primordial Sovereign of the Great Unity arrived in a wind-borne chariot to welcome her ascent to Heaven. Over a hundred scrolls of her sacred and esoteric writings were hidden in the stone grotto of Dragon Perfection Gully, now called the Sacred Writ Grotto. An old man of the Pang clan once came to pay homage, saying, “I wish to guard the sacred altar and hear the Dharma.” The Great Immortal rebuked him: “Foul beast! Are you one of those plague-ridden borderland folk?” She drew her sword to strike him, and he fled into hiding in the western gully, now called Dragon Perfection Gully.

During the *Kaibao* era of the Song, the abbot of the pavilion—a Daoist master—ascended with his son through the liberation of *shijie*. The **Lingxi Abbey** lies two *li* west of the temple. The *Records of Central Xiang* states that this was once the site where the Female Perfected Master Xue achieved transcendence. The abbey was first established in the fifth year of *Tianjian* under the Liang, and later, during the Later Zhou, Princess Wumu—daughter of Duke Wu—was born with extraordinary signs: her chamber glowed with radiance, and from childhood she abstained from meat, longing for solitude. Inspired by the aspirations of the Perfected Lady Xue, the Immortal Maiden of Hou, she took residence in a stone chamber. There, she received the descent of the Sacred Mother of the Western Numinosity, who transmitted scriptures and registers, guiding her in the cultivation of the Three Pristine Dao. The region of Tan and Heng became a place where hundreds of scholars and women venerated her. As the age grew turbulent, she addressed her disciples: “I shall depart for a time, but will return in over a hundred years.” Later, her followers thronged like a marketplace.

In the early *Kaiyuan* era of the Tang, the abbey was bestowed the name **Xiling**. Subsequently, the Daoist nuns Li Taire and Cao Miaoben succeeded one another in residence, attaining the Dao. The abbey remains as it was in the present day, having been donated by Princess Zhou. After falling into ruin for a long time, it was revived by the Ma clan. In the present dynasty, an annual ordination of one Daoist nun is specially granted to ensure the perpetual continuation of its incense and cultivation.

*The Southern Marchmount Compendium of Supreme Wonders* concludes.
