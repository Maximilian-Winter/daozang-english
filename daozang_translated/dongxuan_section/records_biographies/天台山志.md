### **Disputation on the Gazetteer of the Prefecture**

The *Gazetteer of Kuaiji* records the Sima Hui Bridge, located forty *li* southeast of Xinchang County. According to old traditions, when Sima Chengzhen secluded himself on Mount Tiantai, he was summoned to court but regretted his departure upon reaching this spot, hence the name. I humbly suggest that this bridge should be prominently noted as a warning to recluses who lightly abandon their seclusion.

Moreover, the locals later rebuilt this bridge and inscribed its name on wooden boards. They miswrote *hui* (悔, "regret") as *hui* (晦, "obscurity"), rendering the meaning and characters increasingly divergent.

According to the *Seven Lots of the Cloudy Peaks* (*Yun’ao Qiqian*), Mount Sima Hui lies north of Mount Tiantai in Taizhou, designated as the sixteenth blessed land (*fudi*), governed by the immortal Li Ming. The mountain spans the borders of Tiantai and Xinchang, so the bridge derives its name from the mountain. A passing traveler once inscribed a poem:

> *"The Daoist scriptures speak of Sima’s regret,*
> *A blessed land lies on Tiantai.*
> *This mountain, ancient and verdant,*
> *Stands towering for a hundred million years."*

Why then does the *Gazetteer of Yue* record it so differently? Some carelessly claim that Tang Ziwei once crossed this bridge, received an imperial summons, and regretted his hasty departure, wishing to turn back his carriage. To this day, the name remains inscribed on the beams of the bridge, yet the error has greatly misled scholars and commoners alike. By writing *hui* (悔) as *hui* (晦), the large characters on the board have perpetuated the mistake. The *Cloudy Peaks* master’s poem, however, reveals the truth at a glance.

The *Yi Kao Ji* compiles records from across the realm, listing seventy-two blessed lands. The sixtieth, Mount Sima Hui, lies on Mount Tiantai in Taizhou and is governed by the immortal Li Ming.

The *Chicheng Gazetteer* of this prefecture states: Mount Sima Hui is situated thirteen *li* north of Tiantai County, behind Mount Tiantai. Mount Tiantai itself lies three *li* north of the county, beginning at the Divine Trace Stone.

According to the old *Illustrated Classic*, Tao Hongjing’s *True Sites* (*Zhen Zhi*) records: *"Its height reaches eighteen thousand *zhang*, its circumference eight hundred *li*. The mountain has eight tiers, uniform on all sides, aligned with the Dipper and Ox constellations, corresponding to the Terrace asterism above—hence the name Tiantai (Celestial Terrace)."*

The *Ten Circuits Gazetteer* calls it *"the peak facing the Three Luminaries."* The *Hidden Instructions for Ascending to Perfection* (*Dengzhen Yinjue*) states that the Greater and Lesser Terraces lie at the center of five counties: Yuyao, Gouzhang, Linhai, Tiantai, and Kè. It is also called Lingyue. As Sun Chuo’s *Rhapsody* says: *"It shines upon the Ox constellation, establishing its foundation in the sacred land of Yue."*

Today, when people speak of Tiantai, they refer to the mountain’s principal peaks, such as Tonggang, Chicheng, Waterfall, Buddha’s Cradle, Incense Burner, Huading, and Cangshu—all alternative names for its various summits. The *Great Register* (*Dalu*) designates Chicheng as the southern gate and Shicheng as the western gate, as recorded by Shen Yong. Xu Lingfu’s *Minor Records*, however, identifies the Jinting Abbey in Kè County as the northern gate, likely referring to the mountain’s farthest extent.

The *Inner Chapters of the Master Embracing Simplicity* (*Baopuzi Neipian*) states: *"No mountain is suitable for refining the elixir of immortality, for all are inhabited by the spirits of water and stone. Only Mounts Taihua, Shaoshi, Jinyun, Luofu, and the Greater and Lesser Terraces are governed by true spirits who aid humans in attaining fortune and may be used for cultivation."* Thus, the *Rhapsody on Tiantai* says: *"Cross the sea, and you find Fangzhang and Penglai; ascend the land, and you find Siming and Tiantai."* Its profound mysteries set it apart, so it is not ranked among the Five Peaks.

The *Mountain Prophecies* (*Shanchen*) also state: *"The Curved Bean and Female Terrace can avert disaster."* Truly, this land has long been the dwelling of immortals and transcendents.

### **Rhapsody on Mount Tiantai**
**By Sun Chuo of the Jin Dynasty**

Mount Tiantai is the divine beauty among mountains and peaks. Cross the sea, and you find Fangzhang and Penglai; ascend the land, and you find Siming and Tiantai—all places where perfected sages have wandered and transformed, where immortals and transcendents have made their abodes.

Its towering majesty and auspicious splendor surpass all mountains and seas, embodying the grandest beauty of humans and spirits. Yet it is not ranked among the Five Peaks or recorded in ordinary annals. Is this not because its profound seclusion lies in a distant, hidden path—sometimes casting inverted shadows in deep twilight, sometimes concealing its peaks among a thousand ridges? One first traverses the paths of demons and goblins, only to reach a land untrodden by humans. Few in the world can ascend it; even kings cannot perform sacrifices here. Thus, its affairs are absent from common records, and its name is inscribed in the extraordinary. How could the rise of maps and images be mere fancy?

Only those who abandon the world and embrace the Dao, who fast and consume magic mushrooms, can dwell here. Only those who wander in distant searches and firmly believe in communion with spirits would dare to imagine and preserve it in their thoughts.

Thus, I roam in spirit and ponder, chanting by day and rising by night. In the space between gazing and reflection, it is as if I have ascended it once or twice. Now, I untie the cords of the world and forever entrust myself to this mountain. Overwhelmed by the depth of my longing, I loosely weave these words to express my feelings.

The Great Void stretches boundless and unobstructed. From the wonders of nature, rivers flow and mountains coalesce. The peaks of terraces and mountains are marvelous, emerging as the abodes of august spirits. They uphold the Ox constellation, their peaks shining with its light, establishing their foundation in the sacred land of Yue. Their roots intertwine with Huatai and Taishan, their heights rival Jiuyi. They align with heaven in the *Canon of Yao* and match the towering majesty of the *Odes of Zhou*.

Remote and secluded, profound and mysterious, those nearby perceive only what is visible, while those who find the path blocked cannot encircle it. I smile at the summer insects who doubt the existence of ice, and I straighten my light cap, pondering the principles of things. Nothing is hidden that will not be revealed; the two marvels are shown to the world. Chicheng rises in rosy clouds to mark the way; the waterfall flies in cascades to delineate the path. Witnessing these divine signs, I follow the traces of the ancients.

Ah! Soon I shall depart, joining the feathered ones on Red Mound, seeking the blessed courts of immortality.

Should the terraces of the peaks be scalable, why envy the layered cities of immortals? Releasing the common attachments of the world, I give free rein to my lofty aspirations. Clad in a robe of coarse wool, its fibers bristling, I shake my golden staff, its bells chiming. Parting the dense thickets of wild brambles, I tread upon sheer cliffs that rise like sharpened blades. Crossing the trough of the stream, I press forward; descending the five boundaries, I hasten my journey. I stride across the suspended planks of the vaulted ridge, confronting the abyss of ten thousand fathoms. I tread upon slippery stones overgrown with moss, grasp the emerald screens of towering cliffs, gather the trailing vines of ancient trees, and seize the soaring stems of boundless creepers. Though I risk peril at the edge of the precipice, I secure eternal life. Only by aligning my sincerity with the unseen and treading through layered dangers can I transcend them into level ground. Having surmounted the ninefold twists of the path, the way, though once perilous, now stretches long and smooth.

I indulge my eyes and heart in boundless clarity, allowing my leisurely steps to follow their own pace. Resting upon the lush, delicate grasses, I shelter beneath the towering pines. I watch the soaring phoenixes glide in the distance and listen to the singing of the celestial fenghuang. Passing the numinous stream, I bathe once more, clearing the clutter of worldly thoughts from my breast. I wash away the dust of the past in the encircling currents, awakening the fivefold blessings of wandering ignorance. I follow the vanished tracks of Fuxi and the morning sun, tracing the mysterious footsteps of the Two Elders. After two nights’ descent and ascent, I arrive at last at the immortal capital.

Twin gates, sparse with clouds, flank the path; the jade terrace hangs suspended in the midst of heaven. Pearl pavilions gleam amidst the forests, and jasper halls cast their shade upon the lofty corners. Vermilion clouds embellish the day, winging the divine; the radiant sun dazzles through the latticed windows. Eight cassia trees stand tall, defying frost; five sacred mushrooms bloom at dawn. A balmy breeze lingers with fragrance in the sunlit groves; sweet springs gush in the shaded channels. The towering *jianmu* tree eclipses the light for a thousand fathoms; the resplendent *qishu* drips with pearls. Wang Qiao rides his crane to soar into the heavens; the perfected ones fly their staffs through the void. Displaying divine transformations in a flash, they suddenly emerge from being and vanish into non-being.

Thus, my journey complete, my body stilled and my heart at ease, the "harmful horse" of worldly concerns is cast aside, and all mundane affairs are relinquished. The blade finds no resistance; the ox is seen as formless. I concentrate my thoughts upon the secluded crags and chant verses along the long rivers. Then, as the sun reaches its zenith and the wandering mists gather, the lofty monastery’s dharma drum resounds with a clear, ringing tone. Fragrant incense wafts its smoke; the assembly gathers to pay homage to the celestial host. Anointed with the essence of primordial jade, I rinse my mouth with the waters of the Flower Pool. I expound upon teachings beyond form and revel in the scriptures of non-being. I awaken to the endlessness of departing from existence and perceive the questions that arise from entering the void. Dissolving the duality of form and emptiness, I merge their traces; suddenly, in the midst of being, I grasp the profound. Releasing the two names that arise from the same source, I dispel the one nothingness beneath the three banners. I indulge in joyful discourse all day, equating silence with speech. Encompassing all phenomena in a profound contemplation, I sit in serene unity with nature.

The Jade Terrace and Twin Gates are two mountains. From Tongwu Peak, traveling two *li* northwest, one reaches the shrine of the Perfected Immortal Yuan. Taking the path of the immortal’s footprints and passing by Dragon Pool, after five *li* one arrives at the Jade Terrace. From there, turning south to the Twin Gates, one finds sheer cliffs of ten thousand fathoms facing each other. This is what Xing Gong’s rhapsody describes: *"Twin gates, sparse with clouds, flank the path; the jade terrace hangs suspended in the midst of heaven."* Cui Shang’s *Record of Tongwu Peak* states: *"Twin peaks like gates, the heavens cleaved open in their midst."* During the Xiangfu era of the Song dynasty, the mountain recluse Zhang Wumeng once built a hermitage here. Emperor Zhenzong summoned him to inquire about the Dao, and upon his return to the mountains, composed a long song to send him off, which was inscribed at Tongwu Peak—now lost. A poem by Liu Bi of the Tang reads:

*"Cliff walls coil into the sky, the heavenly path winds back;
White clouds drift past, revealing the Jade Terrace.
The cavern’s gate is dim, deep clouds sealed;
The golden gates gleam, the sunlit halls open."*

An inscription by Duke Xia of Ying states:

*"The Jade Terrace delights the throng,
Flanked by gates on either side.
Straight they rise, equal in height,
Vines intertwine, creepers entwine.
They command the clouds’ ingress and egress,
The sun and moon’s passage.
A thousand streams like coins,
Countless peaks like dust.
They soar above the heavens, press upon the sea,
Swallowing the vast, spanning the boundless."*

Mount Tongwu stands twenty-five *li* northwest of the county, rising over a hundred *zhang* in height. It is a branch of Mount Tai, extending northward from Qingxi Stream. The ridge path winds through nine turns, flanked by towering pines that twist upward. Upon reaching the cavern gate, a single glance reveals a realm of sudden beauty, where an immortal palace stands majestically within.

The *Rhapsody on Mount Tiantai* speaks of *"the long pines casting their shade in scattered profusion."* The *Daoist Canon* states: *"Tongwu holds a grotto-heaven and a Golden Court."* According to the old *Scriptures*: *"Prince Jin of King Ling of Zhou governed the Golden Court at Mount Tongwu"*—this is the very mountain. The Immortal Ge Xixi and Sima Ziwei once cultivated the Dao and refined their elixirs here, drawn by the mountain’s numinous splendor, and thus attained transcendence. Thereafter, generations of lofty immortals emerged, for this was a place where the mountains and peaks stored their essence.

Jade Cloud Peak lies thirty *li* north of the county, above the Grotto-Heaven Palace. Its layered cliffs rise in tiers, lush with pines and bamboo, and fragrant grass grows upon it. Before it stand two stones flanking a ravine, standing like a pair of gates over a hundred *ren* high, called the Lesser Tongxiang—a third-tier peak of Mount Tai.

The Jade Capital Grotto lies seven *li* north of the county, on the right flank of Red City Mountain. It is the sixth of the Ten Great Grotto-Heavens. The Perfected Lord Mao, Controller of Destiny, once governed here. Its interior spans three hundred *li* in circumference; some call it the Jade Perfection Clear-Peace Heaven, others the Upper Clarity Jade-Peace Heaven, but in truth, they are one and the same.

The *Secret Essentials of Ascending to Perfection*, the *Inner Biography of Lord Mao*, and the *Record of Famous Mountains and Blessed Lands* all state: Lord Mao’s personal name was Ying, and his courtesy name was Shushen. The *Daoist Canon* records: *"The Heavenly Worthy resided on Jade Capital Mountain in the Primordial Capital, expounding the Dao and commanding the host of immortals to dwell there."* The *Records of Kuaiji* adds: *"Red City Mountain holds five treasures. Xuan Terrace was once inhabited by Xu Mai, who wrote to Wang Yishao: ‘From Mount Tiantai to Linhai, there are many golden halls, jade chambers, and immortal lingzhi herbs.’"* The *Factual Records of Red City* further notes: *"During the Eastern Jin, Qiao Shuo of Kè, while hunting deep in the mountains, saw rare flowers and extraordinary grasses within, their fragrance unlike any other."*

Xu Lingfu’s *Minor Record* states: *"Beneath it lies another grotto-terrace, two hundred *li* square, governed by Lady Wei of the Southern Marchmount. To the south, it stretches to Jinyun; to the north, it meets Siming; to the east, it reaches the dark sea; to the west, it connects to the Ke River. Within it are the three luminaries of sun and moon, jade flowers, and divine herbs. From the Jin and Song through the Liang and Sui dynasties, and up to the Tianbao era of the Tang, the mountain was regularly honored with offerings at the sight of the sun’s zenith and the starry crow. Today, the grotto’s mouth bears the carved characters ‘Jade Capital,’ though no date is inscribed. During the Xianping and Tiansheng eras of the Song, golden dragons and jade tablets were repeatedly cast into the grotto. Later, they were stolen by rogues, and now the entrance is choked with mist."*

Beside it lie three stone caverns called the Daoist’s Grottoes, too perilous to climb. The *Continued Gazetteer* states: *"They are governed by the Immortal Lord of the Dark Continent."*

The Cinnabar Radiance Minor Grotto lies fifteen *li* northwest of the county, northeast of Fusheng Abbey. Legend holds that the Venerable Immortal Ge refined his elixir here, and there is a Rock Where Immortals Clap Their Hands. The Tang prefect Liu Bi once concocted medicines here, and the former site of his residence remains.

**Streams, Wells, and Marshes**
The Sweet Spring Well lies beneath the Assembly of Wonders Terrace at Tongwu Abbey. Its waters are sweet and can cure illness. The Cinnabar Well is beneath the Bell Tower of Tongwu Abbey, said to be the well where the Venerable Immortal Ge refined his elixirs.

**Abbeys and Observatories**
Chongdao Abbey of Tongqiao stands twenty-five *li* north of the county. From behind Fusheng Abbey, one ascends the ridge, winding through nine turns in the path. Upon reaching the cavern gate, the descent begins, and at a single glance, a splendid vista unfolds—level as a whetstone, encircled by nine peaks like the walls of a city. The abbey stands at the heart of these nine peaks.

According to the *Daoist Canon*: *"Tongqiao holds a grotto-heaven and a Golden Court, governed by Prince Jin."* Within it are three bridges—one visible, two hidden. The trees are lush with verdure, and the springs flow with stone marrow and golden nectar. Those who partake of them transcend aging and never grow old.

The *True Records* state: *"Wu has the Golden Mound of Juqu; Yue has the Golden Court of Tongxiang. Neither the Three Calamities nor the great floods reach them. They are truly blessed lands of undying bliss and numinous realms for nurturing perfection."* In the second year of Chiwu of the Wu, the Left Immortal Elder of the Grand Ultimate, Ge Xuan, refined his elixirs here, and thus the Altar for Facing the Dipper still stands before the abbey. To the southwest of the altar lies a stone like a turtle’s back, inscribed with the words: *"Xu, Envoy of the Stone Candle, performed the Jiao rites here."*

Two hundred and sixty years later, in the first year of Yongtai of Emperor Ming of the Qi, the General Who Pacifies the Caitiffs, Governor of Jihe, and Left Director of the Department of State Affairs, Shen Yue (styled Xiuwen), along with over ten others, resigned their posts to become Daoist priests and dwell here. Another two hundred and thirteen years later, in the second year of Jingyun of Emperor Ruizong of the Tang, the abbey was built by the Perfected Lord Sima Chengzhen. A prohibition was set: within forty *li*, no logging was permitted, so that birds, beasts, grasses, and trees might live long.

According to Xu Lingfu’s *Minor Record*: *"Where the Perfected Lord dwelled, yellow clouds perpetually veiled the sky, so his meditation chamber was called Yellow Cloud. Below it, the Altar of True Qi was named Primordial Dawn. Gazing upward, one beheld the clear scene: to the east was the Chamber for Refining Form, to the south the Terrace of the Turning Phoenix, to the west the Pure Chamber for Facing Perfection, and to the north the Pavilion of the Dragon’s Script. The Assembly of Wonders Terrace stood above, and beneath it lay the Sweet Spring Well, whose waters were exceedingly sweet and could cure illness. Later, all fell into ruin."*

During the Dahe and Xiantong eras, the Daoist Xu Lingfu and Ye Cangzhi extensively rebuilt it. In the first year of Kaiping of the Later Liang, the abbey was converted into an official residence. After the Song crossed south, Grand Preceptor Cao Xun oversaw its reconstruction, expanding its halls and gates to even greater grandeur. The work was completed in the dinghai year of the Qiandao era—four hundred and fifty-seven years after the Jingyun era.

The Duke of Yang, Yang Cunzhong, and his son contributed greatly to its restoration. Its halls include the Three Clarities Precious Hall, with two towers for scriptures and bells before it. Behind it stand the Upper Clarity Pavilion, the Imperial Calligraphy Pavilion, and the Assembly of Wonders Terrace.

In the sixth year of the Zhenghe era, an additional Hall of Emperor Huizong’s Primordial Mandate was constructed behind it. A mountain gate was built before it, overlooking the Nüsuo Stream. Atop stood the Meeting Immortals Pavilion, and due south beyond the ridge, a grotto gate was visible. Within, the abbey comprised the Abbot’s Quarters, the Monastic Hall, the Earth Deity Hall, the Three Perfected Hall, the Water Pestle, and the Water Mill—altogether six courtyards: the first, the Sutra Repository; the second, the Three Primordials Courtyard; the third, the Guest Reception Courtyard; the fourth, the Pure Emptiness Courtyard; the fifth, the White Cloud Courtyard; and the sixth, the Bathing Courtyard.

During the Song dynasty, imperial bestowals included fifty-three scrolls of Emperor Taizong’s and Emperor Zhenzong’s compositions and calligraphy. Emperor Gaozong’s traced copies of Han and Jin dynasty calligraphy, historical records of the *Shiji* and *Hanshu*, and ink inscriptions were stored in two woven sutra curtains donated by the Korean monastic overseer. During the Xiangfu era of Emperor Zhenzong, a grand Daoist rite was held, and four imperial robes were bestowed and enshrined in the Imperial Calligraphy Pavilion. The King of Wu-Yue donated ten bronze statues of the Heavenly Worthy, complete with flame-shaped pedestals. Additionally, three sandalwood statues of the Three Clarities—cast in gold, bronze, and steel—comprised a single ensemble of two hundred and sixty figures. Jade flowers and eight pearls were enshrined in the Upper Clarity Pavilion, while the main hall housed forty scrolls of sacred images donated by the Palace of Prince Zhaocheng of the Peaceful Residence.

The Pure Emptiness Courtyard’s soaring towers and pavilions, with their mist-wreathed windows and cloud-kissed eaves, nestled amid verdant forests and emerald mists. Their adornments and sacred images were unparalleled in splendor. Yet in later years, as the dynasty transformed and people fled in turmoil, a fire erupted from within, reducing its grand designs and exquisite craftsmanship to ruins, its golden and azure embellishments to ashes. Only the sandalwood ensemble survived, preserved in the Welcoming Immortals Chamber by the eastern ravine at the request of visiting pilgrims. Today, the sole remnants of the past are this ensemble and the chamber’s pavilion.

From the dingzi year of the Qiandao era, when Grand Preceptor Cao completed the reconstruction, to the dingwei year of this calamity, one hundred and ninety-nine years had passed. Counting from the jiwei year of the Chiwu era, a total of one thousand one hundred and twenty-nine years had elapsed—truly a span of great duration. Flourishing and decline, rise and fall, each follows its appointed time.

**Stele Inscription of Tongqiao Abbey**
*Composed by Cui Shang of Qinghe, Grand Master for Splendid Happiness, Acting Minister of the Ministry of Works, and Pillared Scholar of the State during the Tang Dynasty*

Mount Tiantai and Tongqiao—one is called Tiantai by convention, the other Tongqiao in truth. Though these two names differ, they arise from the same source and align with the mysterious Dao, which is omnipresent. How, then, could one suffice to distinguish the paulownia from the parasol tree? In light of this, all assertions of "is" and "is not" dissolve.

Tracing antiquity, the Tongwu Mountain rises eighteen thousand *zhang* high, spanning eight hundred *li* in circumference. Its eight ridges form a uniform perimeter, and at its heart lies a grotto-heaven named the Golden Court Palace—the abode of Wang Zijin, the Right Assistant. This is the blessed realm of immortality, the numinous sanctuary for nurturing the true. Thus, the abbey was established in its early days and provisionally named after the paulownia.

The ancient abbey had long lain in ruins. Elders passed down tales that Ge Xianweng first dwelled here, followed by Daoist adepts who gathered in succession. Five or six altar sites remain, their traces still visible. In our Tang dynasty, Master Alchemist Sima resided here. During the Jingyun era, the Son of Heaven issued a decree to rebuild Tongwu Abbey, glorifying the great achievements of our Mysterious Origin and securing the eternal blessings of our state.

Perched on one of the eight ridges, the abbey overlooks a thousand-*ren* precipice, facing south with its back to the north, its layout conforming to the terrain. It spans several hundred *bu* east to west and an equal distance north to south. Towering peaks encircle it, their verdant hues stretching across the wilderness. Lush trees flourish year-round, their foliage evergreen. Before the great crags, atop a transverse ridge, twin peaks stand like gates, cleaving the sky. A long ravine cascades southward, where myriad springs converge and roar. A single waterfall plunges a hundred *zhang*, its spray like flying snow, its sound like rising wind. One may lean against the Stone Bridge and Emerald Screen, or climb the jade-like blossoms and pearl-like vines. Immortal flowers and sacred herbs bloom in alternation through spring and autumn. Secluded birds and azure apes call in unison by morning and night—truly a place of delight.

To the south, Shifeng stretches away, its cloudy veils rising between peaks. To the north, Kechuan opens a passage, its misty summits connecting. To the east, the land dips toward the blue sea, not far from Penglai. To the west, boundless ranges extend, their ends unseen. Encompassing these mysteries, the mountain stands peerless in beauty, embodying the primordial *qi* to form a harmonious whole, anchoring the earth in tranquility. If not for a dwelling of gods and immortals, crafted by divine and immortal hands, how could such a place come to be?

When the Hall of the Heavenly Worthy was first built, five-colored clouds drifted above it by day. At the Three Wells, where dragons were offered, strange mists would enter the hall and reemerge three times. These were recorded as auspicious signs. Later, empty chambers were hewn, doors carved, and layered terraces raised. Through cultivation and construction, the abbey stood resplendent, adorned with the radiance of sun and moon, its hues drawn from mist and rosy clouds. Golden blossoms scattered upon the ground, their fragrance reaching the mysterious ultimate. Here, those devoted to the Dao gathered and rested.

Without our Master Alchemist, who could have revived it? The Master’s name was Chengzhen, also known as Ziwei, and he was styled the White Cloud of Tiantai. A native of Wen in Henei, he descended from the younger brother of Sima Yi, the Grand Mentor of the Jin dynasty. His grandfather, Chen, served the Sui as Grand Supervisor of the Imperial Guard.

The Master’s father, Renzui, rose under the Tang to the rank of Gentleman for Court Service and served as Prefectural Governor of Xiangzhou. From a family of illustrious worthies, their virtue had shone pure through successive generations; from a land blessed with numinous power, this immortal talent was born. Those who wear court caps and ride state carriages do so to honor their own persons; those who strike bells and array tripods do so to savor flavors at dawn. Yet the Master cast aside the vocation of dukes and marquises to study the arts of divine transcendents. He mastered the registers of teachings and precepts, exhaustively synthesizing them without omission. In the profound and recondite, the subtle and elusive, he dwelt beyond recognition. Thoughtless and effortless, abstaining from drink and food, he soared ever higher—majestic as a mountain; he delved ever deeper—abyssal as the sea.

His comprehensive talent and refined understanding, his vast learning and wide knowledge, his mastery of brush and ink, his excellence in literary composition—all these he forgot as though he had never possessed them. The Master embodied the virtue of Guangcheng, while Emperor Ruizong inherited the wisdom of the Yellow Emperor. With a mind purified and intent on seeking, the Master was to be entrusted with state governance, yet he remained steadfast, unshaken. Our August Emperor, his filial piety a model, governed the realm through the Dao, emulating the heart of Emperor Yao and honoring the lofty aspirations of Xu You. Thus, the Master was permitted to dwell in seclusion and wander freely. Those who heard his name were stirred to refine their conduct; those who beheld his countenance were cleansed of worldly dust. He treasured compassion as his jewel and saved beings through goodness. His spirit foresaw the future; his wisdom concealed the past. Truly, his name was inscribed in the registers of immortals, yet he remained within the mortal realm—profound beyond measure.

The Dao is born of namelessness and moves through the realm of emotion. Dividing, it forms the Three Powers; dispersing, it generates the myriad things—thus it is the Mother of all under heaven. Those who cultivate it flourish; those who turn from it perish—thus it is the most precious under heaven. To abandon learning is to be free from care; to attain long life is to endure in vision. The Dao’s unfolding must have its steps. The steps of practicing the Dao are found only in mountains. Thus, there is action, there is form; gazing upon this, revering this—if one were to abandon this dwelling, to what would the teachings cling? Reduce and reduce again, until one reaches non-action. The Mysterious Gate now stands exalted, its merit beyond naming.

The Court Gentleman for Ceremonial Dispersion, Commissioner with Extraordinary Powers for Military Affairs of Taizhou, Defender of Taizhou, and Pillar of State, Lord Jia, whose personal name was Changyuan, was a man of the Dao who transformed others and a man of virtue who nurtured all things. He often said to his subordinate officials, Vice Governor Cai Qinzong and others: "The Dao is realized through the abandonment of virtue, and virtue brings forth beauty. If beauty is not extolled, what will later generations behold?" Thereupon, they jointly erected a stele to record and praise this, to manifest the radiance of ultimate reclusion.

Its inscription reads:
Vast is Mount Tiantai, towering and majestic.
Below, it overlooks the blue sea; afar, it gazes toward Penglai.
Boundless as heaven’s vault, gaping as earth’s opening.
Paths of mist and clouds connect; true immortals come in due time.
Behold our Master of Refinement, upon that jade terrace.
Master of Refinement, Master of Refinement—his Dao enters the subtle and profound.
In serene repose, he aspires to soar above the clouds.
The rise and fall of the numinous abode—our Master of Refinement has aided it.
The Dao leaves nothing undone; how splendid and resplendent!
Deep and distant, boundless and obscure, it links heaven and brings down auspiciousness.
May it protect our august Tang, as enduring as the mountains.

Erected on the second day of the third month in the first year of the Tianbao era, the ren-wu year of the sexagenary cycle, by disciples including Daoist Fan Huiqu of Kunling.

*Record of the Reconstruction of the Daoist Canon*
Composed by Song Chengfenglang, Acting Secretary of the Bureau of Texts, Vice Director of the Bureau of Texts, Concurrent Military Administrator of Taizhou, and Acting Agricultural Commissioner, Jie Paijiao.

In the Jingyun era of the Tang, the Son of Heaven established a Daoist abode at Tongwu for Sima Chengzhen, situating it below the Three Wells of Qiong Terrace. Through the Five Dynasties, as the Central Plains contended in turmoil, Qian Chu, the Loyal and Benevolent King of Wuyue, encountered the Daoist Zhu Xiao. Recognizing Zhu’s refinement, he built a chamber northwest of the Upper Clarity Pavilion to house two hundred cases of the *Golden Register* and *Scripture of Written Characters*, diligently attending to the task.

For twenty years under the unified mandate of our dynasty, the realm was pacified, its lands divided into prefectures and counties, its rivers and seas bound as one. There was the Venerable Master of Numinous Stillness, Meng Xuanyue, who first crossed Kuaiji, traversed the fertile isles of Chicheng, and sought out Tongwu. As the monastery’s overseer and the Venerable Master Chongyi, Ji Changyi and others entreated him to take charge of this repository. By the second year of the Yongxi era, an imperial edict commanded the thorough inventory of these scriptures, which were then conveyed to Yuhang. Once copies were made, the Transport Commissioner, Remonstrance Grand Master, and Lord Lei Dexiang ordered them returned by boat at the request of the master. Another decade passed, and the repository neared ruin, threatened by wind and rain. The master rallied the rightful clans of Yue and Tai, pooling their resources with his own to amass two hundred thousand coins. Skilled artisans were employed to replace the rotted and decayed, restoring the vermilion lacquer and dark pigments to their original design.

Thirteen years later, as the dynasty received auspicious omens at the Gate of Heavenly Succession and preparations for the Feng and Shan sacrifices commenced, an edict renamed the abode *Chongdao* ("Venerating the Dao"). The following year, moved by the *Three Chapters*, the Son of Heaven ordered the construction of the Jade Clarity Luminous Response Palace in the capital. An imperial decree commanded all prefectures to seek out renowned Daoist masters of exemplary conduct and extraordinary scriptures, dispatching their names by post to the throne. As the master prepared for his summons, he made a request of me: to record the true history of the repository and inscribe it upon stone.

I reflect that the Great Void, though formless, is called the Dao. It gives birth to the Two Modes yet does not possess them; it nurtures the myriad things yet remains unaware. Only the sagely and the numinous approach its essence. Thus, the *Five Thousand Words* of the Old Master, pure and simple yet unconfined, have been revered and illuminated by later generations. Here, sacred scrolls and secret missives, golden tablets and jade registers—such as the *Supreme Orthodox Unity’s* methods for refining form and pacing the void, or the *Charts and Records of Red and White Cinnabar, Black and Brown Stones*—are collectively called *scriptures*, and their assemblage, a *repository*. The establishment by the House of Qian was indeed momentous, its golden seals and silver scripts chosen for their nobility. Meng’s stewardship was unwavering: for twenty-eight years, the halls have been renewed in splendor, and not a single slip of bamboo has been lost.

To visit this place, to awaken here, to align one’s actions and silence with the mean—is this not the mark of the enlightened? Alas, may those who succeed Meng in its guardianship cherish it as I do, and may visitors discern its true essence.

Recorded in the third year of the Dazhong Xiangfu era, the *geng-yin* year of the sexagenary cycle, in the first month. *Record of the Restoration of the Cypress Repository*.

The *Record of the Restoration of Tongbo* was composed by Cao Xun, Retired Grand Commandant and Military Commissioner of the Zhaoxin Army, Duke of Qiao of the Song.

To the right of Mount Tiantai lies Tongwu, which one reaches only after traversing nearly ten *li* from the mountain’s base to its cavernous gate. Above, layered and secluded realms unfold, each with its own chambers. The four encircling peaks stand like ramparts, untouched by human hands—clouds soar and cliffs rise as if fashioned by heaven and earth. At its heart lies the former abode of Master Ge, where he refined the elixir; later, in the Tang, Sima Ziwei grandly constructed palaces, enshrining the image of the August Jade Emperor to shelter the feathered immortals. Jade Cloud Peak stands to the east, Jasper Terrace to the west, while the Divine Mansion and Square Peng Island anchor the north. A waterfall surges at its center, its cascading spray like ten thousand galloping steeds rushing southward. Year-round, its torrents plunge from the cliffs, vast and billowing as the celestial sash. Residents and travelers gaze upon it endlessly, for as the *True Record* declares, the Tongxiang of Yue is none other than the Golden Court Grotto-Heaven, a blessed realm for nurturing the true, where the highest immortals preside and gather the host of transcendents. It is no ordinary mountain or stream, but a domain fit for dragons and serpents. Thus, it soars to the upper reaches of the Han, hidden deep within the nine heavens, drawing in the forces of heaven and earth, weaving through past and present. Its form and terrain encompass all, untouched by the dust of the world. Were one not a scholar of refined spirit and pure cultivation, one could scarcely linger here for even a moment.

In my recent retirement, I have cast off the yoke of worldly duties and forgotten the trappings of the mundane. Upon visiting, I found the halls and structures, though standing since the Five Dynasties, all in disrepair. The sacred images were weathered and faded, their forms nearly lost. Moved to action, I sought to encourage the restoration. At the time, the Gate Supervisor Shi Qingduan, the Deputy Daoist Overseer Li Yongnian, and Shi Baozhang all clasped their hands in agreement, deeming it an unparalleled blessing for the mountain sanctuary. Baozhang alone vowed to dedicate himself to the labor of construction, sparing no effort. Over six or seven years, I sought those in positions of influence to support the endeavor. Eventually, we secured the patronage of Grand Preceptor Prince He of Yang and his son, the Academician of the Hall for the Diffusion of Literature, along with myself. All contributed their official stipends to expand the foundations of the halls and corridors, each widened by over a *zhang*. Newly constructed, they rose in height and breadth, with spacious walkways added. Ancient stone rubbings were copied, and the *Scripture of Salvation* was painted upon the walls. The Three Clarities’ main hall was rebuilt, and artisans were commissioned to adorn the beams and eaves with vibrant hues, rendering the complex resplendent. Where the images of heaven and humanity had lost their dignity, they were recast with solemn eyes, their former gilding and emerald inlays restored. The Three Officials Hall was established, and the refectory was relocated to a grander hall capable of accommodating a thousand. The eastern and western guest quarters were expanded to receive passing visitors. The outer gates were removed, modeled after the Supreme Clarity precincts of the central capital, and three grand portals were opened. Statues of the Dragon and Tiger Lords were sculpted, their forms majestic and imposing. The Spirit Star Gate was erected to enhance the commanding view, revealing azure cliffs and crimson ravines, verdant pines and bamboo, all suffused with harmonious *qi*. The reclusive Daoist masters, too, were enveloped in this serene atmosphere.

The Daoist Tang Zhizhang, using the gold and silver-scripture texts hand-copied by the House of Qian, contributed his own funds to construct a repository and its adjoining hall. Thus, all the inner and outer chambers were completed. Fine timber and sturdy beams, patterned stone and the five metals—all were employed. From the mountain’s base, logs were hauled upward at great labor. The total cost for the carvings, paintings, and other embellishments amounted to roughly ten million. Towering halls and soaring eaves now stand in alignment, as if emerging from the floating purples and greens of the void, wholly renewed. Truly, this is the dwelling of the immortals and sages of the Nine Clarities, the domain of the myriad spirits and divine powers. Majestic and awe-inspiring, it soars and shines, a transformation wrought in the midst of heaven. Those who come to reside or visit are uplifted in their Daoist aspirations, as if ascending with the immortals in flight. None fail to embrace the resolve for transcendence and stillness. Thus, they may daily join the pure assembly in ascending the hall for incense offerings, praying for the emperor’s longevity and establishing an eternal sanctuary for the ages. Is this not a most felicitous achievement?

As a result, the entire mountain now vies in fellowship, inspired and transformed, their goodness deepened by this sublime place. Even the indolent and gluttonous among them have been tempered and refined, striving to align with the true. They chant and recite the Dao and its virtue, their conduct ultimately disciplined, gaining the blessings of the Three Treasures: compassion, frugality, and humility. When asked of their teachings, they diligently uphold the scriptures, never straying from the proper path. Entering the halls, one finds their precepts and seniority observed in perfect order, with no disruption to their ranks. In conversation, their demeanor is pure and their *qi* refined, gradually attaining the essence of the immortal tradition. In bearing their sacred duties and delighting in the Dao according to the season, they fulfill the vision of the new Purple Yang Palace. Yet the mountain’s splendor defies full description.

In the twilight of my years, I have been fortunate to partake in this noble endeavor. Thus, I have recorded its origins and the thoroughness of its restoration, chronicling the contributions of those who undertook its labor, the challenges of its expansion and renewal, and inscribed it upon enduring stone for posterity.

Baozhang often declared: “I have laid bare my heart and poured out my devotion, never forgetting the days of our shared creation. Yet I have not found a kindred spirit.” But if the highest immortals deign to bestow their favor and bring this work to completion, it is because Tongbo in eastern Zhe stands as the most renowned abbey in the region. It upholds the dawn’s radiance and the clouds’ ascent, where the Nine Dragons’ chariot descends from the watchtowers of the mountains. It opens to the pristine light, where the Three Dukes of Mount Shouyang wield their guardianship. Even the court’s great ministers and eminent figures often serve as its patrons and overseers. Moreover, travelers from Min, Guang, Hu, and Xiang frequently pass through, their carriages and horses following in an unbroken line. Guests and retinues seek lodging here more than elsewhere, and to offer them cramped and shabby quarters would be to betray the abbey’s ethos of emptiness and transcendence.

Furthermore, our teachings extol purity and detachment, warning against attachment to life and death, fortune and misfortune as mere expedients to awaken the world. Only when one encounters the wise and discerning, whose hearts are bright and intentions pure, does one dare to undertake such renovations, hoping to restore and sustain this sacred realm, lest its legacy falter. This is why such endeavors are rare and timely.

Alas! Baozhang did not shirk the censure of the crowd, nor did he idle a single day in his duties. He personally oversaw the construction, renewing this tranquil sanctuary, sparing no effort in its completion. Is he not far wiser than those who sit idly, awaiting its ruin? May those who succeed him in this stewardship not forget the labors of their predecessors, ensuring that the Daoist assembly may morning and night pay homage, find rest, and preserve the joy of the subtle and tranquil. This would be the greatest fortune for those who began this work, and they shall surely not incur reproach in this grotto-heaven of blessed realms.

Here the oversight remains.

I, a sojourner beyond the world’s harness, drift like a wild crane or idle cloud, amidst trailing vines and moonlight, pine winds and mountain mists, letting my spirit roam free, my words a mere rustic offering—yet I urge those who come after. As for the tangled roots and stubborn knots, readers of this text shall find their own insight.

Recorded on the Clear and Bright Day of the fourth year of the Qiandao reign, the year wuchen.

**Li Bai’s Poem on Tongbo Abbey**
Heaven’s Terrace neighbors Four Brightness;
its Flowery Summit towers over the hundred Yue.
The gate is marked by rosy clouds of Red City;
the tower cradles the moon of Green Isle.
Perched high, the gaze stretches far—
straight down, the dark Bohai appears.
Clouds hang like a roc in flight;
waves surge where the giant turtle sinks.
Wind and waves ever rage;
spirits and marvels flicker in an instant.
Trace their signs—no boundary,
yet the heart for the Dao never rests.
Climbing branches to pluck crimson fruit,
ingesting elixirs to refine golden bones.
How might one grow feathers,
to sleep a thousand springs in Penglai’s halls?
Dragon towers and phoenix pavilions cannot detain me—
soaring, I would straight to Heaven’s Terrace go.
Jade-green linked rings of eight-faced mountains,
where within, men’s paths still wind.
A maiden in blue invites me to wander Jade Terrace;
fragrant blossoms of jade trees open ninefold.
Heaven’s wind scatters perfume, untouched by earth—
a thousand petals, ten thousand, beyond all dust.
I arrive just after Double Ninth,
laughing as I shake out rosy clouds in a flourish.
Tomorrow, with a flick of my sleeves, I leave Purple Tenuity—
on the wall, dragons and serpents writhe in vain.

**Luo Yin’s Poem**
Before Flower-Canopy Peak I planned to till the soil,
yet the master, restless, wanders once more.
I might ride the crane’s chariot to the blue sea,
but fear the rhinoceros carriage will pass Red City.
With vermilion tablets, I’d soon attend the Right Assistant;
with purple pennants, I’d meet the Eastern Minister.
I urge you: do not forget the season of return—
where glowworms gleam, lingzhi sprouts at every turn.

**Lü Dongbin’s Poem**
A green snake props up the earth as the moon lingers;
night deepens, clouds part, yet the crane does not return.
I come to visit—by karmic chance, one may exchange bones—
leaving fleeting traces even at Heaven’s Terrace.

**Bai Yuchan’s Inscription**
Last night, an immortal’s flute echoed through the valleys;
he bade me cross South Mountain at dawn.
On a stone altar we sat, speaking of pine winds—
a crane’s cry, and the mountain moon fell.
Pale moonlight veils the ancient pines;
clear streams bathe the tall bamboo.
Deep waters do not drown the toad—
long shall it keep the Daoist company.

**Another Poem Left at Tong Bridge**
I alighted at Heaven’s Terrace, an ancient grotto-heaven,
yet before the rush mat warmed, I drifted away again.
Why is this hut not on Jade Terrace’s ground?
Perhaps I am no immortal of Tongbo.
No more shall I draw water from Three Wells;
never have I deeply bound myself to Nine Peaks.
With my staff I hook the moon and descend the mountain—
only the cold gibbons howl in the morning mist.

**Grotto-Heaven Abbey**

The abbey stands thirty-five *li* northwest of the county seat, where layered cliffs rise in succession and pines and bamboo flourish in wild profusion. The land yields fragrant cogon grass. Due south, at the *xun* quarter, two stones stand like gate leaves—locals call this place Little Tongbo.

During the Xiantong era of the Tang, Daoist Ye Cangzhi once established a Daoist retreat on Yuxiao Peak, naming it the Stone Gate Mountain Dwelling. Later, he petitioned Emperor Yizong to elevate it to Yuxiao Abbey, and the request was granted. The *Xiaolu* of Daoist Xu Lingfu records that Chen Guayan, a recluse of Yuxiao Peak, styled himself Hualin. Among his works is the *Scripture of the Bell-and-Tower*, all transcribed in the eleventh year of Xiantong. A colophon reads: *"Transcribed by disciple of the Three Caverns of Supreme Clarity, Ye Cangzhi, for his late mother, Madam Liu Siniang, to be enshrined eternally within the vaults of Yuxiao."* In the first year of Xiangfu of the Song, the abbey’s plaque was changed. Today, it has been merged into Tongwu and lies abandoned.

**Jade Capital Abbey**
This abbey lies seven *li* northwest of the county seat, to the right of the Jade Capital Grotto-Heaven on Red City Mountain. From the Jin, Song, Qi, and Liang dynasties through the Tang’s Tianbao era, the site was used for observing the sun at noon and the stellar crow to perform seasonal rites. During the Xianping and Tiansheng reigns of the Song, golden dragons and jade tablets were repeatedly cast into the abyss. In the eighth year of Zhenghe, the court bestowed a plaque and established the abbey, but it soon fell into ruin. In the first year of Jiaxi, the throne ordered grand offerings and prayers, and imperial envoys arrived to cast dragon tablets and register the land in ritual. The proceedings, however, were marred by impropriety.

At that time, Grand Master Chong, Gao Weiji, cleared the mountain and surveyed the site, rebuilding the abbey’s halls. Master Miaomiao, Fan Shanqian, and his allies assisted in its completion. Prefect Zhang Houhu petitioned to allocate public fields to support the kitchens. By imperial decree, an incense dipper of agarwood, a true bronze bell-chime, and an imperial calligraphic plaque were bestowed. The plaque of the Hall of the Northern Culmen was installed to guard the abbey. The main hall enshrines the Star Lord of the Emperor’s Life-Destiny, named Qingping. The Hall of Myriad Longevities was overseen by County Magistrate Yao Dehui, though the date of his tenure is unrecorded. Today, it has been merged into Tongxiang and lies abandoned.

**Abbey of the Protector Saints**
This abbey stands a hundred paces east of the county seat, atop Wondrous Mountain. It originally occupied the site of the City God’s Temple. During the Xuanhe era of the Song, it was relocated to the northeast corner of the county. After the Southern Crossing, Duke Cao of the Commandery built the abbey anew. In the Dade era of the Yuan, it was renovated under the supervision of the county overseer, Bu Bo. A stele with an inscription by the overseer remains. Though the abbey now lacks a plaque, the local populace continues to venerate it, and its incense fires have never ceased.

**The Two Palaces of Renjing and Chunsu**
The two palaces flank Tongxiang Abbey. During the early Zhiyuan era of the Yuan, Daoist Wang Zu’an of Tongwu, styled Zhongli, was summoned by Emperor Shizu and bestowed the title *Zhenren* of Renjing and Chunsu. On the right, he rebuilt the former White Cloud Abbey on a rugged slope, naming it the Palace of Chunsu. To the left, on the former site of Duke Cao’s Hermitage of Frugality, he established the Palace of Renjing.
