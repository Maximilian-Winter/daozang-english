*The Record of the Ten Continents*, compiled by Dongfang Shuo

After Emperor Wu of Han heard the Queen Mother of the West speak of the Ten Continents—Zu, Ying, Xuan, Yan, Chang, Yuan, Liu, Sheng, Fenglin, and Juqu—all vast lands amidst the eight great seas, where human traces are rare, he began to suspect that Dongfang Shuo was no ordinary man. Thus, he summoned him to a secluded chamber and personally inquired about the locations and wonders of the Ten Continents, which were then recorded.

Dongfang Shuo replied: "Your servant is merely a student of immortality, not one who has attained the Dao. Yet, moved by the splendor of the empire, which summons renowned scholars and literati to its cultural institutions while suppressing the esoteric arts at its margins, I have concealed my reclusive nature to serve at the imperial court, hiding my pursuit of longevity beneath its vermilion gates. This is also because Your Majesty reveres the Dao and seeks to temper its majesty with humility.

I have followed my masters in their travels, reaching the Crimson Mound, Fusang, the Clam Sea, the Dark Night Hills, the Pure Yang Ridge, the depths of the Azure Beginning, the halls of the Moon Palace, and the inner realms of the chariot-driving immortals. I have wandered the Seven Mounds, circled the Ten Continents, trodden the Red Counties and roamed the Five Peaks, divined streams and rested in marshes, seeking repose upon sacred mountains. From my youth to the present, I have traversed the Six Heavens, beheld the radiance of the vast earth, and seen all there is to see. Yet I am not like the disciples of the Void or the palaces of the Flying Immortals, who ascend and descend the Nine Heavens, gazing upon all directions in a single glance. They roam north to the Pole Star and the Celestial Enclosure beneath the Canopy of Flowers, soar south to the Great Cinnabar and perch upon the Great Continent of Xia, traverse east to the rosy dawn of the Yang Passage, and press west to the frigid wilds of the Cold Caverns—places beyond the reach of sun and moon, untouched by the River of Stars. Above, there is nothing more; below, no further depths. What I have witnessed extends only so far, and I am ashamed that it is not enough to satisfy Your Majesty’s broad inquiries."

The Isle of Zu lies near the heart of the Eastern Sea, spanning five hundred *li* across and situated seventy thousand *li* from the western shore. Upon it grows the Herb of Immortality, its form resembling wild rice, its stalks three or four *chi* in height. Should a man have been dead for three days, covering him with this herb will restore him to life at once. A single dose grants longevity. In the days of the First Emperor of Qin, his grand park teemed with corpses strewn across the roads. A bird resembling a crow would pluck this herb and place it upon the faces of the dead, who would then sit up and revive. Officials reported the marvel, and the First Emperor dispatched envoys bearing the herb to consult Master Guigu of Beiguo. The master declared: "This is the Herb of Immortality from the Isle of Zu in the Eastern Sea, which grows in fields of jade. Some call it the Divine Mushroom of Nourishment; its leaves resemble wild rice, and its stalks grow in clusters, each sufficient to cover a man." The First Emperor, moved to exclamation, asked: "Can it be gathered?" He then sent the envoy Xu Fu, along with five hundred boys and girls, who set sail in towering ships to seek the Isle of Zu—yet they never returned. Fu was a Daoist adept, styled Junfang, who later attained the Dao.

The Isle of Ying lies in the Eastern Sea, spanning four thousand *li*, roughly opposite Kuaiji. It lies seventy thousand *li* from the western shore. Upon it grow divine immortal herbs and jade stones towering a thousand *zhang* high, from which springs a liquor-like liquid, sweet to the taste, called Jade Essence Spring. Drinking several *sheng* induces intoxication and grants longevity. The isle abounds with immortal dwellings, its customs akin to those of Wu, its mountains and rivers resembling those of the Central Kingdom.

The Isle of Xuan lies in the Northern Sea, in the land of Ren and Hai, spanning seven thousand two hundred *li* and situated thirty-six thousand *li* from the southern shore. Upon it resides the True Lord, the Immortal Elder of the Great Mysterious Capital. His domain is rich in hills and mountains, and there stands the Wind Mountain, whose rumblings resemble thunder and lightning. Facing the northwestern gate of heaven, the isle is home to many officials of the Great Mystery, their palaces each unique, abundant in golden mushrooms and jade herbs. It is also where the Three Heavenly Lords descend to govern, a place of utmost solemnity.

The Isle of Yan lies in the Southern Sea, spanning two thousand *li* and situated ninety thousand *li* from the northern shore. Upon it dwells the Wind-Born Beast, resembling a leopard, azure in hue, and as large as a wildcat. When captured in nets and burned with piles of firewood, the flames consume the wood, yet the beast remains unscathed, standing amid the ashes with fur uncharred, impervious to arrows or blades. Struck like a leather sack, its head must be hammered dozens of times before it dies—yet if it opens its mouth to the wind, it revives after a moment. Only by stuffing its nostrils with stone parsley does it perish. Its brain, mixed with chrysanthemum and consumed in ten-*jin* doses, grants five hundred years of life. The isle also boasts Firewood Mountain, where flames glow within. Beasts the size of rats, their fur three or four *cun* long, some red, some white, inhabit the three-hundred-*li* expanse, their radiance visible even on moonless nights. Their fur, woven into cloth, is called Fire-Washed Fabric. When garments soiled with grime are washed in lye, they never grow clean—but if burned in fire and shaken between two meals, the filth falls away, leaving them as white as snow. The isle is also home to many immortals.

The Isle of Chang, also called Green Mound, lies in the southeastern reaches of the Southern Sea, each of its sides spanning five thousand *li*, twenty-five thousand *li* from the shore. It abounds in mountains and rivers, and its great trees measure two thousand *wei* in girth. The entire isle is a forest, hence its name, Green Mound. It teems with immortal herbs, divine medicines, sweet nectars, and jade blossoms—nothing is wanting. There is also a Wind Mountain, whose echoes perpetually resound. The Purple Palace stands there, where heavenly immortals and fairy maidens roam.

The Isle of Yuan lies in the Northern Sea, spanning three thousand *li* and situated ten thousand *li* from the southern shore. Upon it flow the Five Mushrooms and the Dark Gorge, whose waters resemble honeyed syrup. Drinking them grants immortality, aligning one’s years with heaven and earth. Consuming these five mushrooms also bestows eternal life. The isle is home to many immortals.

The Isle of Liu lies in the Western Sea, spanning three thousand *li* and situated nineteen thousand *li* from the eastern shore. It is rich in mountains, rivers, and piled stones, known as Kunwu. Forging its stones into iron yields swords whose brilliance shines like crystal, cutting jade as easily as mud. The isle is also home to many immortals.

The Isle of Sheng lies in the northeastern reaches of the Eastern Sea, seventeen thousand *li* from Penglai, spanning two thousand five hundred *li* and situated twenty-three thousand *li* from the western shore. Tens of thousands of immortals dwell upon it. The climate is mild, divine herbs flourish perpetually, and the land knows neither cold nor heat, nurturing all things. It abounds in mountains, rivers, immortal herbs, and myriad mushrooms. The waters of the isle taste like sweet milk—it is the most excellent of isles.

The Isle of Fenglin lies at the center of the Western Sea, spanning one thousand five hundred *li*. Weak Waters encircle it on all sides, so light that a goose feather cannot float upon them, rendering the isle inaccessible. The isle is home to countless phoenixes and unicorns, each gathering in flocks. It also boasts mountains, rivers, marshes, and a hundred varieties of divine medicines, as well as many immortal dwellings. Boiling the beaks of phoenixes and the horns of unicorns and refining them into glue yields the famed Bowstring Glue, also called Golden Sealant. This glue can mend broken bowstrings and shattered blades, so that when a strongman tugs at the repaired weapon, it breaks elsewhere, never at the mended joint. In the third year of the Tianhan era, Emperor Wu visited the Northern Sea to offer sacrifices to Mount Heng. In the fourth month, an envoy from the Western Kingdoms arrived, presenting four *liang* of this glue and a robe of Jiguang fur. The emperor accepted the gifts and stored them in the outer treasury, unaware of their wondrous properties.

The emperor deemed the tribute from the distant Western Kingdom unremarkable and delayed sending the envoy back. Later, when Emperor Wu visited the Hua Lin Park and shot at a tiger, his crossbow string snapped. The envoy, who was accompanying the imperial procession, presented another *fen* of the glue, moistening it with his mouth to mend the broken string. The emperor marveled, exclaiming, "This is a wondrous thing!" He then ordered several warriors to tug at the repaired string together, but even after a full day’s effort, it did not break, as if it had never been severed. The glue was a deep blue, like jade. The Jiguang fur robe was yellow, likely from a divine steed. When submerged in water for days, the robe did not sink, and when thrown into fire, it did not burn. Only then did the emperor realize its value. He richly rewarded the envoy and sent him off, bestowing upon him cassia bark, dried ginger, and other goods that the Western Kingdom lacked. He also grew to appreciate Dongfang Shuo’s foresight even more.

During the reign of King Mu of Zhou, the Western Hu presented a *Kunwu* jade-cutting knife and a *Night-Glowing Ever-Full Cup*. The knife was a foot long, and the cup held three *sheng*. The knife could slice jade as easily as mud. The cup was made of refined white jade, its radiance illuminating the night. When placed in the courtyard at dusk and left facing the sky, by dawn it would be filled with a sweet, fragrant liquid—truly an instrument of divine beings. During the reign of the First Emperor of Qin, the Western Hu again presented a jade-cutting knife, though without the Ever-Full Cup. Thus, the glue must have come from the Phoenix-Unicorn Isle, while the finest swords must originate from the Flowing Isle—both found in the Western Sea.

The Isle of Gathering Caves lies in the Western Sea at the *shen-wei* direction, spanning three thousand *li* in area. To its north, it borders Kunlun, twenty-six thousand *li* away, and lies twenty-four thousand *li* from the eastern shore. The isle abounds with true immortals and divine officials, their palaces and gates too numerous to count. It is also home to lions, *pixie* beasts, *zaochi* creatures, long-tusked celestial deer, and beasts with copper heads and iron brows. A great mountain on the isle resembles the form of a man and a crow, hence its name: Man-Crow Mountain. The mountain is covered in towering trees akin to maples, their flowers and leaves so fragrant their scent carries for hundreds of *li*—these are called *Returning Soul Trees*. When struck, the trees emit a sound like the bellowing of a herd of oxen, startling the hearts and spirits of all who hear it. If one fells the tree, boils its roots and core in a jade cauldron, and simmers the liquid over a low flame until it thickens into a black paste, it can be shaped into pellets. This substance is called *Startled Essence Incense*, or *Spirit-Shaking Pellets*, *Returning Life Incense*, *Shaking Sandalwood*, *Man-Crow Essence*, or *Death-Defying Incense*—one substance with six names, a true marvel. Its fragrance carries for hundreds of *li*, and if a corpse on the ground catches its scent, the dead revive, no longer lost. When used to fumigate the deceased, its divine efficacy is even more pronounced.

In the third year of the Yanhe era, Emperor Wu visited Anding. The king of the Western Hu of the Yuezhi Kingdom sent an envoy to present four *liang* of the incense, each piece the size of a sparrow’s egg and as black as a mulberry. The emperor, deeming the incense foreign to the Central Kingdom, stored it in the outer treasury. The envoy also presented a fierce beast, resembling a fifty- or sixty-day-old puppy, the size of a civet and yellow in color. The emperor ordered the envoy to bring it forward. Upon seeing it, he noted how the envoy cradled it like a dog—thin, bald, and emaciated—and found it strange that such a small creature was offered as tribute. He asked the envoy, "This tiny thing is but a plaything. Why call it a fierce beast?"

The envoy replied, "Might over the hundred birds does not depend on size. Thus, the divine unicorn rules the giant elephant, and the phoenix commands the roc. The centipede’s venom is mastered by the flying serpent, not by its bulk. Our kingdom lies three hundred thousand *li* from here. By our divinations, when the east wind enters the pitch pipes and persists for a hundred days, and blue clouds veil the *lü* notes for months on end, we know that the Central Kingdom has a sovereign who favors the Dao. Our king thus values the Dao and Confucian scholars above all others, prizing divine objects over gold and jade. We scoured the hidden wonders of our land to present this sacred incense, traversed the celestial forests to seek this fierce beast, rode sledges across weak abysses, and spurred swift steeds through flying sands. The journey has been long and arduous—thirteen years have passed. This divine incense revives those on the brink of death, and the fierce beast wards off malevolent spirits. These two treasures are essential for aiding the masses and fostering harmonious governance. How could Your Majesty fail to recognize their truth? Our divination of the winds must have been mistaken."

Today, gazing upon Heaven’s countenance, we see that even a sovereign is not necessarily one who embodies the Dao. Eyes that see too much grow covetous of beauty; mouths that speak too much transgress shallows; limbs that move too much turn wanton and predatory; hearts that adorn too much become extravagant—never has the world been governed by these four excesses.

Emperor Wu, struck silent, then asked the envoy: "From what realm does this fierce beast subdue the hundred avaricious and repel the lurking malevolent? What does it feed upon? How does its strength compare? And from what land does it hail?"

The envoy replied: "The fierce beast emerges from various domains—some are born on Kunlun, others in the Dark Abyss, still others in the Gathering Caverns or upon the Celestial Path. It does not eat grain but feeds on qi and drinks dew. It understands human speech and possesses benevolence, wisdom, loyalty, and forbearance. When its benevolence stirs, it shelters all living things, sparing even tigers and leopards; when its majesty arises, a single roar silences thousands, and all creatures—oxen, horses, and beasts—are so startled they snap their tethers. Warriors and guardsmen, in an instant, lose their strength; when its divinity manifests, it summons wind and clouds, exhales mist and rain, drives away all malevolence, and sends dragons and serpents fleeing. Dwelling in the stables of the Most High, it is harnessed alongside lions—this is the fierce beast. Truly, its transformations are boundless; it is the sovereign of great birds, the primal king of the celestial hunt, the marshal of all that dispels evil.

Though the divine incense is but a small quantity, it is a miraculous pill of revival. Those stricken by plague, disaster, or death may be restored by it, and even those who merely catch its scent will live. Its fragrance is especially potent, which is why it lingers so long."

Thereupon, the Emperor ordered the envoy to command the beast to roar for him to hear. The envoy pointed at the beast and bade it cry out. The beast parted its lips for a long while, then suddenly let forth a roar like a great thunderclap. Its two eyes flashed like intersecting bolts of lightning, their brilliance piercing the heavens, and only after a long moment did the radiance subside. The Emperor instantly reeled, covering his ears in shock, unable to steady himself. His attendants and the tiger-like guardsmen all dropped their weapons and prostrated themselves. All the cattle, horses, pigs, dogs, and other creatures within and without broke free from their bonds and fled in terror, and it was some time before all was calm again.

The Emperor, displeased, consigned the beast to the Shanglin Park, commanding the tigers to devour it. Yet when the tigers heard of the beast’s approach, they gathered together, crouching as if dead. As the beast entered the park, it strode directly onto a tiger’s head, urinated into its mouth, then turned to regard the tiger from ten paces away—the tiger immediately shut its eyes. Enraged by the envoy’s insolence, the Emperor sought to seize him, but by the next day, both the envoy and the fierce beast had vanished. Search parties were dispatched in all directions, but their whereabouts remained unknown.

In the first year of the Later Yuan era, hundreds within Chang’an fell ill, and over half perished. The Emperor tested the Yue-zhi divine incense by burning it within the city—those dead for fewer than three days revived, and its fragrant essence lingered for three months without fading. Thus, he knew it to be a divine object. He then secretly stored the remaining incense, but one day, it vanished entirely. Though the casket’s seals remained unbroken, no trace of the incense remained. The Emperor grew ever more remorseful, regretting his failure to honor the envoy, and held in greater esteem the words left by Dongfang Shuo. He reproached himself for not seeking Li Jun more earnestly and for briefly encountering Wei Shuqing at the palace steps.

The following year, the Emperor passed away in the Five Blessings Palace. The Yue-zhi incense was surely the *wushan zhentan que-si* fragrance from Raven Mountain. Had he treated the envoy with greater generosity, how could he not have obtained the divine incense at the hour of his death? His fate was sealed.

The Island of the Azure Sea lies in the Northern Sea, spanning three thousand *li* in circumference, twenty-one thousand *li* from shore. The sea encircles the island on all sides, each stretch five thousand *li* wide. Its waters are deep blue, and immortals call it the Azure Sea. The island is entirely mountainous, rich in stone—eight kinds of stone, including *shinao*, *shigui*, *ying*, *liu*, *dan*, *huang*, *zi*, and *shidan*, among over a hundred varieties, all native to the island. Those who consume these stones attain immortality and longevity.

At its center stands the Purple Stone Palace, governed by the Nine Elder Immortals. Tens of thousands of celestial officials reside there.

Fangzhang Isle lies at the heart of the Eastern Sea, equidistant from its western, southern, eastern, and northern shores, each side five thousand *li* in length. The isle is the gathering place of dragons, where palaces of gold, jade, and lapis lazuli stand—the domain of the Three Heavenly Directors of Destiny. Those immortals who do not wish to ascend to heaven come here to receive the *Tai Xuan Sheng Lu*. Tens of thousands of immortals till fields and cultivate *zhi* herbs, measuring their plots as one would rice paddies. There is also a Jade Stone Spring, above which stands the Palace of the Nine Source Elders, who govern the water spirits of the world, as well as dragons, serpents, leviathans, and all creatures of the yin waters.

Fusang stands on the eastern shore of the Eastern Sea. From the shore, one must travel ten thousand *li* inland before reaching another vast sea, equal in breadth to the Eastern Sea. Its waters are neither salty nor bitter but a pure azure, sweet and fragrant. Fusang lies within this sea, spanning ten thousand *li*. Atop it stands the Palace of the Supreme Emperor, governed by the Eastern King Father of the Great Perfected. The land is dense with forests, their leaves resembling those of the mulberry. There are also *dang* trees, some thousands of *zhang* tall, over two thousand *wei* in girth. These trees grow in pairs from the same root, leaning against one another—hence the name Fusang. Immortals who consume their *dang* fruit radiate a golden light and soar through the void. Though the trees are immense, their leaves and fruit resemble those of the mulberry in the Central Lands, save that they are sparse, crimson, and bear fruit once every nine thousand years. Their taste is surpassingly sweet and fragrant. The earth yields purple gold and luminous jade, resembling tiles and stones of the Central Lands. True immortals and spirit officials manifest in myriad forms, their shapes ever-changing. Some can divide their bodies into a hundred forms or grow to ten *zhang* in height.

Mount Penglai is the same as Mount Pengqiu, lying northeast of the Eastern Sea. Its shores span five thousand *li*, encircled by a vast, dark sea known as the Dark Sea. Though windless, its waves rise a hundred *zhang*, making passage impossible. Atop the mountain stands the Palace of the Nine Elder Immortals and the Nine Heavenly Perfected Kings, the abode of the Supreme Perfected. Only flying immortals can reach this place.

Kunlun, also called Kunling, lies in the northwest of the Western Sea and the northeast of the Northern Sea, thirteen thousand *li* from shore. Weak Waters encircle the mountain, connecting to the Stone Garden in the southeast, the Northern Gate Chamber in the northwest, the Great Vitality Well in the northeast, and the Receiving Abyss in the southwest. These four great mountains form the pillars of Kunlun. The southern edge of the Stone Garden is where the Queen Mother of the West told King Mu of Zhou that Xianyang lay 460,000 *li* away. The mountain rises 36,000 *li* above the plain, its summit flat and vast, spanning ten thousand *li*. Shaped like an inverted basin—narrow below and broad above—it is called Kunlun Mountain.

Of its three peaks, one points due north, piercing the radiance of the celestial stems, and is named the Summit of Enclosed Winds. Another points due west, called the Hall of the Dark Garden. The third points due east, named the Kunlun Palace. One peak holds a reservoir of gold, forming a celestial pond—a square city a thousand *li* across. Upon it stand five golden terraces and twelve jade towers. The Northern Gate Mountain and the Receiving Abyss Mountain also bear walled cities, golden terraces, and jade towers, gleaming like palaces of flowing essence, halls of luminous azure, chambers of jasper radiance, and vermilion chambers of purple splendor. Clouds of light illuminate the sun, and crimson auroras glow with ninefold brilliance—this is the domain of the Queen Mother of the West, the sacred seat of true officials and immortals. Above, it connects to the celestial pivot, where primordial *qi* flows and spreads. The Five Constants and the Jade Balance govern the nine heavens, harmonizing yin and yang, nurturing all beings. Rare and wondrous things abound here, beyond enumeration. Heavenly beings gather in countless numbers. This is the root and pivot of heaven and earth, the guiding principle of all existence.

Thus, the Supreme One designates sacred mountains in the five directions to stabilize the earth’s geography, naming the Celestial Pillar in the Dark City as the axis of the cosmic net. The deepest rivers and waters are home to water spirits, their yin realms difficult to reach—thus, their governance has no fixed abode, unlike the hills and mounds that can be described. Such is the order of heaven and earth, the fitting arrangement of all things. The sagely observe the directions and, following the forms, establish their abodes. Thus, they place the Mystic Wind at the western extremity, seat the Queen Mother in the region of Kun, station Kunwu in the Flowing Marsh, and plant Fusang in the Azure Ford.

The Fire essence divides and converges, giving birth to luminous beasts in the fiery wilds; the Kan trigram gathers all yin, and thus the immortal capital resides upon the sea isles. The Gen position commands the famed mountains, where Penglai anchors in the Yin and Chou directions; the Xun trigram embodies the Primordial Maiden, nurturing vast waters on Changzhou Isle, where mighty winds stir at the dragons’ stations and sacred talismans flourish on Xiaqiu’s heights. Such wonders are profoundly subtle and abstruse, their hidden spirits beyond full reckoning. Wherever the perfected ones conceal their dwellings, wherever numinous mounds arise—within the six directions, how could these be merely a few places? This account merely touches upon their outward signs.

Your servant Shuo’s knowledge is not vast, and I cannot fully expound the sacred decrees of the Queen Mother of the West or the Lady of the Upper Prime. I once heard from those who attained the Dao that these Ten Isles and great mounds, these spirit mounds, are all the sacred ruins of true immortals, governed by divine officials. The myriad mountains and rivers beyond these have no observers.

Beyond the Northern Sea lies Mount Zhong, situated in the northern reaches of the Northern Sea’s waters, separated by the Weak Water to the north by nineteen thousand li. It rises thirteen thousand li high, with a summit spanning seven thousand li and a circumference of thirty thousand li. Over forty kinds of jade mushrooms and divine herbs grow there spontaneously. At its peak stand golden terraces and jade towers, also enveloped in primordial qi, where the Lord Emperor of Heaven holds court. To the south of Mount Zhong lies Mount Pingxie, to the north Mount Jiaolong, to the west Mount Jingcao, and to the east Mount Shumu—all four are branches of Mount Zhong. These four mountains tower thirty thousand li above Mount Zhong, each with five palace cities. Ascending any of the four, one gazes down to see Mount Zhong below. These four mountains mark the domain of the Lord Emperor of Heaven.

Immortals and perfected ones, when traveling the scriptures of the Dao, enter through a single path from the southeast of Mount Pingxie into a cavern, emerging at the northern gate of Mount Zhong. The Lord Emperor of Heaven governs the nine celestial pillars, his dignity unmatched. The mountain’s roots encircle the heights of the four cities, yet only at its heart does one behold the vision of Kunlun.

Long ago, when Yu had completed his regulation of the floodwaters, he rode his tracked chariot across the Weak Water to this mountain, offering sacrifice to the Supreme Emperor at the Northern Alley and ascribing great merit to the Nine Heavens. Yu also traversed the Five Marchmounts, commanding artisans to carve stones marking their distances and elevations. The characters were in tadpole script, not the writing of Han people. The measurements of length and distance are all from Yu’s time. Not only were the Five Marchmounts inscribed, but so too were all famous mountains, their carvings placed only at the most solitary heights.

This account records only what your servant Shuo has personally witnessed. The numinous marshes described by the Queen Mother—places Yu never trod—include only the famed mountains of the Central Realm. My late master, Gu Xizi, was a true official of the Supreme One. He once bestowed upon me the True Forms of Kunlun, Mount Zhong, Mount Penglai, and the Divine Continent. When I entered Han, I left these to be entrusted to a trusted acquaintance. This text is even more precious than the diagrams of the marchmounts, and the transmission period for both was identical.

Your Majesty loves the Dao, pondering its subtleties and purifying your heart, turning inward toward the Heavenly Venerable. The sacred and secret transmissions have descended and been bestowed. Your servant Shuo, humble as I am, how could I begrudge offering all that I possess? Yet those who practice the arts guard their affairs in secrecy, and Daoist methods conceal their masters. To reveal them invites doubt, while exposing the master scatters the wondrous principles. I humbly pray that my intent not be made public.

Emperor Wu rejoiced at these profound teachings. The following year, he again received the True Forms of the various immortals, keeping them close at his elbow. At the eight solar nodes, he regularly paid homage to the numinous texts, seeking liberation through their writings. Shuo, known for his wit, had foreseen and observed the Emperor’s inclinations, thus toying with the Son of Heaven and treating nobles with disdain. He could not be taken as teacher or friend, nor could his joy or anger be fathomed. Thus, Emperor Wu could not fully grasp the ultimate principles from this man.

*The Record of the Ten Isles* concludes.
