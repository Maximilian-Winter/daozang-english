**Sima Jiao**

Sima Jiao, also named Ningzheng, and alternatively Shouzhong, wandered through the Jiangnan region. He often wore a hempen cap and coarse cloth, walking in wooden clogs, covering a thousand *li* or more in a day. His garments, though made of coarse cloth, remained perpetually new. His conduct was fierce and abrupt, and none dared approach him. He could feign death, his body turning green and swollen, reeking of decay, only to revive shortly after.

Once, he stayed at the Kaiyuan Abbey in Xuanzhou. From Xuanzhou to Shezhou, the Daoist Shaoxiu Mo was also traveling to Shezhou. At the city gate, he encountered Sima Jiao and walked alongside him. Shaoxiu Mo, seeking to avoid him, arrived first at a garrison town and rested at an inn. Sima Jiao soon followed. Shaoxiu Mo concealed himself and observed secretly. He saw Sima Jiao enter another shop, summon the innkeeper, and drink with him, only to humiliate the man. The innkeeper initially showed respect and apologized, but Sima Jiao persisted, striking him. They grappled, and Sima Jiao suddenly collapsed to the ground, appearing dead—his body cold, his complexion altered. The entire market gathered to watch. The townspeople were summoned, the innkeeper bound, and the corpse examined for evidence. They prepared to send him to the prefecture, but as evening approached, they decided to wait until the next day.

At midnight, clamor arose from the inn: "The Venerable Master Sima has vanished!" Only then did the people realize he had feigned death and released the innkeeper. The next day, Shaoxiu Mo set out at dawn. After traveling about a hundred *li*, he asked someone, "When did the Venerable Master Sima pass through here?" The reply: "He passed early this morning." The following day, after another hundred *li*, he asked again, and was told, "He passed early yesterday." Upon reaching Shezhou, the answer was the same.

Whenever he traveled among the prefectures along the upper Yangtze, he would stay at an inn for an extended period. Before departing, he would tell the innkeeper, "I cannot take my bamboo utensils with me. Fetch fire to burn them." The innkeeper protested, "The wind is strong, and the bamboo hut is low and cramped—fire cannot be lit here." Sima Jiao insisted, and though the crowd knelt and pleaded, he refused to listen. He set fire to the room and stood at the door with a large staff, striking anyone who dared approach. He was strong, and none dared draw near. Soon, the flames raged, shooting through the gaps in the bamboo roof, and the onlookers panicked. When the fire subsided, all of Sima Jiao’s belongings were consumed, the outer bedding scorched, yet the straw mat and bedding beneath remained unburned.

There was a man named Zhu Ao, a legal officer in Chizhou. Sima Jiao visited him and said, "Your complexion is grim—you will fall ill. When I leave, if you think of me during your illness or call my name, I may respond." Zhu Ao did not believe him. More than ten days later, he indeed fell gravely ill with a fever. After several days, his condition worsened. Suddenly recalling Sima Jiao’s words, he revered him as a divine being and bowed in prayer, seeking his aid.

At first, Zhu Ao’s illness was severe, and he saw a figure before him—a minor clerk named Chen, who often attended to his needs. He ordered Chen to enter the room and tend to him, but then angrily dismissed him. His family stood guard outside, allowing no one to enter. Yet, in his delirium, Zhu Ao saw Chen holding a bowl of medicine and offering it to him. He drank it and immediately felt his mind clear and his body ease. He called to his family, "The medicine Chen just brought is most effective—have him bring another dose." His family was astonished: "We did not let anyone enter, how could Chen have come?" Zhu Ao then realized it was Sima Jiao’s divine assistance. From then on, his illness gradually improved.

Sima Jiao once resided at a certain abbey in Shezhou. Stricken with severe dysentery, the abbey’s master wished to report his condition to the authorities and first informed Sima Jiao of his intent. Enraged, Sima Jiao said, "My illness is nearly cured—why trouble yourself so?" As his condition worsened, the abbey master had no choice but to report it to the county magistrate, Yao Yun. Yao Yun sent someone to inquire after him. Sima Jiao asked, "Why does Magistrate Yao know of my illness?" When the messenger relayed this, Sima Jiao grew furious. Suddenly, he rose, dressed himself, and strode directly into a mountain, moving as swiftly as if he were flying.

More than ten days later, Sima Jiao returned wielding a large staff, demanding to see the abbey master and threatening to strike him. The Daoist priests of the abbey all bowed and pleaded for mercy, and only then was he spared.

Once, he went to the market in Hongzhou to buy fresh food. The children in the market called out, "Daoist eating fresh!" Enraged, Sima Jiao hurled something at one of the children, drawing blood. The patrolmen seized him and brought him before the military prefect, who, knowing his reputation, gently tried to persuade him. Sima Jiao, however, railed at him furiously. Unable to contain his anger, the prefect had him caned ten times. Sima Jiao said to others, "If he had struck me fifteen times, I could have lived fifteen more days. Ten strokes mean I shall die in ten days." And so it came to pass.

Later, he entered Mount Lu and resided at the Abbey of Simplicity and Silence. There, after drinking himself into a stupor, he lay unconscious for several days before passing away. Before his death, he instructed that a staff be placed in his coffin. When the coffin was later opened, it was found empty—only the staff remained.

**Qian the Recluse**

Toward the end of the Tianyou era, Qian the Recluse traveled through Jianghuai and once stayed at the home of a certain Yang in Jinling. Earlier, when the Wu dynasty had established Jinling as a prefectural seat, it built a city wall that extended westward into the river and eastward to Chaogou. Qian pointed to a stretch of over a *li* of overgrown and desolate land west of the city and urged Yang to buy it. Yang followed his advice. When the city later became the imperial capital, the land Yang had purchased lay at the heart of the bustling metropolis. There, he constructed a multi-story building and opened a tavern.

Once, while staying at Yang’s home, Qian suddenly rose in the middle of the night and said to those around him, "The clamor of troops and horses beneath the earth is deafening—they say they are here to receive the Lord Commander, and their noise keeps me from sleeping." No one could fathom his meaning. The next day, Yizu arrived in Jinling from Jingkou, though no one had foreseen his coming.

On another occasion, Qian saw a man and said to him, "Heaven’s punishment is about to befall you. You must hasten to repent and take responsibility." The man replied, "I cannot recall any wrongdoing." Qian said, "Reflect deeply." After a long while, the man said, "Yesterday, I was displeased with my meal and, in anger, threw it into the ditch." Qian said, "That is precisely the offense. Retrieve what you discarded at once." The man fetched the food and was about to rinse away the filth with water when suddenly thunder and lightning crashed violently. Qian said, "Quickly, eat the spoiled food." The man did as instructed, and the thunder and lightning ceased.

Someone once painted a portrait of Qian. Upon seeing it, he remarked, "I am not as composed as this—yet I stand before the sages." No one understood his meaning. Later, a monk took the portrait and placed it in the pagoda of Master Zhi. People considered this fitting. Later still, Liezu retrieved the portrait and brought it into the palace, where it was displayed in the inner chambers.

Qian also frequently uttered prophecies, foretelling future events. Regarding the fate of the Li dynasty, he said, "Between the topknot and the beard, one Yang shall double." The Wu dynasty had ruled the lands south of the Yangtze for forty-six years, while the Li dynasty reigned for thirty-nine. Some said that the Yang referred to the Yang family, who had proclaimed themselves sovereign and ruled for twenty years before abdicating—thus, the "topknot" (Li) was indeed doubled by the "beard" (Yang).

**Nie Shidao**

Nie Shidao, a native of Shezhou, developed an affinity for the Dao in his youth. At the end of the Tang dynasty, Yu Tao served as prefect of Shezhou. His elder brother, Fangwai, was a Daoist priest who lived in the mountains south of the prefecture. Shidao went to study under him. Tao often visited Fangwai, and on matters of governance, he consulted him as well. Thus, the mountain was named Mount Inquiry.

During the Wu dynasty, because Shidao had once resided there, he was given the title "Master of Inquiry."

Initially, when Fangwai lived in the mountains, few in the prefecture believed in or supported him. After Shidao arrived, however, the number of devotees increased daily, and the abbey grew prosperous.

Once, Shidao was traveling with a friend when they stopped at an inn. The friend fell ill with a fever, and the village had no medicine. Someone suggested to the sick man, "If you can eat something unclean, it may cure you." As his condition worsened, they urged him again, but the man hesitated. Shidao said to him, "The situation is dire—what is there to hesitate about? I will taste it first for you." He then took some and ate it. Moved by his sincerity, the man ate as well, and his illness was cured.

Later, when Pei Shu, the Vice Director of the Department of State Affairs, was serving as prefect of Shezhou, the Tang dynasty was nearing its end, and imperial decrees no longer reached the region. Tian Jun of Xuanzhou and Tao Ya of Chizhou raised troops and besieged the city for months. The people of Shezhou repeatedly repelled them. When supplies ran out and reinforcements failed to arrive, the city’s leaders discussed surrender. Yet, as the defenders had already killed many of the besiegers, no one dared to venture out as an envoy. Shidao then volunteered to go. Shu said, "You are a Daoist priest—how can you traverse a battlefield?" He urged Shidao to change his clothes. Shidao replied, "I have received the precepts of the Dao—it is not permissible to alter my attire." He then left the city under a banner of truce.

At first, the two commanders were astonished, but after speaking with him, they were overjoyed, saying, "A true Daoist priest!" They swore an oath and sent him back to the city. When the appointed time arrived, Shu had not yet completed his preparations and sought to delay. He sent Shidao out again to negotiate. People feared his vacillation and considered his mission perilous, but Shidao showed no hesitation. When he met the two commanders again, they said, "There is no objection—only await the Vice Director’s command." Thus, the people of the city were spared, thanks to Shidao’s efforts.

When Emperor Taizu of Wu heard of his reputation, he summoned him to Guangling and built the Purple Ultimate Abbey for him to reside in. One night, a thief broke into his quarters and took all his belongings, even his household utensils. Shidao said to him, "You steal to relieve hunger and cold—what use will these things be to you?" He then led the thief into a secluded chamber, gave him all his gold and silk, and said, "Leave through the back—avoid the patrols, and you will come to no harm." The thief followed his instructions and escaped unscathed.

Later, the Wu court sent Shidao to Mount Longhu to perform a grand ritual. On the way, he was ambushed by bandits who intended to kill him. One of them, however, stared at Shidao and said to his companions, "Do not harm this master." He ordered that all the stolen goods be returned. The bandits complied. Then he said to Shidao, "I am the thief who once robbed you at the Purple Ultimate Abbey in Yangzhou."

Moved by the master’s boundless benevolence, he repaid the kindness in this way. Later, Shidao passed away in Guangling.

At the time, an envoy was being dispatched to Hunan and Hubei. On his return journey, he encountered Shidao at a certain place and asked, "How have you come here?" Shidao replied, "The court sent me to perform a ritual at Mount Heng." The envoy accepted this. Only upon entering Wu territory did he learn that Shidao had already died.

Shidao’s grandnephew, Shaoyuan, entered the Dao in his youth. His demeanor was gentle and refined, and he was skilled in composition. He died at just over twenty years of age. Earlier, when Shaoyuan’s illness grew severe, four cranes alighted on the roof of his dwelling. Upon his death, people saw five cranes soar into the sky and vanish.

Yu Da resided in the Western Mountains of Hongzhou. He lived beyond the constraints of the four seasons, always holding flowers and avoiding close contact with others. Once, he visited the Ying Sheng Abbey and placed flowers before the Daoist statue. A Daoist prepared tea and set it on the dining table. Only after others had withdrawn did Yu Da approach to drink. After finishing, he placed the teacup back on the table, bowed deeply, and departed. If someone bowed to him, he would return the gesture—but he never spoke.

A young man fond of the Dao wished to become his disciple but could not succeed. One day, the youth bowed and said, "I wish to serve you, Master." Yu Da fled without looking back. The youth pursued him, seizing his robe, and Yu Da could not shake him off. They climbed mountains and crossed streams without pause. Finally, Yu Da sat by a stream and asked the youth, "Are you thirsty?" The youth replied, "Yes." Yu Da took something like tea powder from his sleeve and said, "Place this in your mouth and scoop water to swallow it." The youth did as instructed. Soon after, he fell asleep, and upon waking, Yu Da was gone.

Li Mengfu often wandered the markets and streets of Hongzhou.

Aged around twenty, he was short and fair, his beauty as refined as jade. Indulging in unbridled freedom, he adorned his hair with flowers in all seasons, wandering through the taverns of the city, singing loudly and drinking to intoxication. Those fond of novelty often invited him to drink, and if asked to compose lyrics, he would improvise on the spot—never giving it a second thought, yet each piece carried its own charm.

When Zhong Chuan governed Hongzhou, he deemed Mengfu’s wild and misleading behavior punishable. From prison, Mengfu presented over ten poems, one of which read: *"Drinking with flowers in my hair—what harm is there? / Woodcutters’ chants and fishermen’s songs—what time do they impair?"* In the end, Zhong did not punish him.

Later, Li Qiong, the prefect of Guizhou, sent an envoy to Hongzhou, claiming Mengfu was his younger brother and requesting his return. Zhong ordered a search among the city’s inns, but the people said, *"Mengfu did not return last night."* From then on, his whereabouts remained unknown.

**Liu Tonggui**

Liu Tonggui lived in Hongzhou and lodged in the house of the Ai family. The household consisted only of an old man and his wife. Each morning, he carried a basket of mushrooms to sell, returning drunk by evening. Over time, neighbors grew suspicious. One night, they bored a hole in the wall to spy on him and saw him take out a jar of soil, sprinkle it with water, and soon mushrooms sprouted. By dawn, he harvested them.

Later, the old man fell ill and told his wife, *"When I die, place a staff in my coffin."* After his death, they followed his instructions. At first, when the coffin was lifted, it felt heavy. But halfway to the burial site, it grew as light as if empty. They opened it to find only the staff inside.

**Master Geng**

Master Geng was the daughter of Geng Qian, a military officer from Jiangbiao. From childhood, she was bright and quick-witted, with a graceful appearance. Fond of books, she occasionally composed poetry, often imbued with fine meaning.

Master Geng was well-versed in the Daoist arts and could restrain ghosts and spirits. Proficient in the alchemy of yellow and white and matters of strange transformations, her marvels and illusions were so wondrous that none knew their origin. During the Baoda era, when Jianghuai flourished in wealth, the emperor, fond of literature and enamored with the extraordinary, summoned her to the palace to further observe her arts. He did not treat her as one of the ranked courtiers but instead lodged her in a separate residence, addressing her as "Master." Clad in green-tinged rosy clouds, she often appeared before the emperor holding a tablet, her spirit radiant and transcendent, her words clear and flowing. Her hands resembled a crow’s talons, rendering them useless for tasks, so she relied on others for eating and drinking. Disliking walking, the palace attendants often carried her. Whenever she composed poetry, she would inscribe it on the walls, signing herself as "Master of the Northern Greatness," though none understood its meaning. Her guard was not constant, yet her presence was outwardly resplendent; when called upon, she responded with a brilliance both subtle and manifest. The emperor thus held her in even higher regard.

When she first entered the palace, the emperor questioned her about alchemical arts, testing her with trials that all proved true. Thereafter, she performed them with even greater ease and simplicity. Once, during a moment of leisure, the emperor remarked to her in advance: "All these rely on fire to achieve their transformation. Without fire, could they still be done?" The Master replied: "Let me attempt it—perhaps it is possible." The emperor then took mercury, wrapping it in layer upon layer of paper, sealing it tightly. The Master placed it in her bosom, and after a long while, a sound like tearing silk suddenly arose. Smiling, she said: "Your Majesty has never believed in my humble arts—today, witnessing it with your own eyes, can you still doubt?" She took it out and presented it to the emperor. He examined it closely; the seal remained unchanged. When opened, it had turned to silver.

Another time, during a heavy snowfall, the emperor teased her: "Can you turn this snow into silver?" The Master replied: "It can be done." She gathered the snow, packing it tightly, and carved it into the shape of a silver ingot. Then, with her own hands, she cast it into glowing coals. Ash and embers billowed up as she slowly covered it with more charcoal. After the time it takes to eat a meal, she declared: "It is ready." She retrieved it, glowing a brilliant red. Placed upon the ground, as it cooled, it gleamed as a solid silver ingot, its edges and markings intact. Beneath it, the residue resembled dripping lard or trickling milk—this was the snow melted by the fire’s heat. From then on, the Master crafted many such "snow silvers." On the emperor’s birthday, she would fashion vessels and utensils from them as tribute for his longevity.

She was also full of ingenious ideas, her creations always surpassing those of others. Once, the Southern Sea presented rare treasures: rosewater and dragon-brain nectar. The rosewater was clear yet intensely fragrant, while the dragon-brain nectar strengthened men’s vitality. The emperor treasured them, often mixing the nectar with wine to drink, its fragrance lingering in his mouth for days. He also bestowed some upon his favored ministers. The Master remarked: "These are not yet the finest."

The emperor asked, "Can you refine these as well?"
She replied, "Let me try—it should succeed."
She took the dragon-brain nectar, placed it in a fine silk pouch, and suspended it within a crystal bottle. The emperor personally sealed it, set wine beside it, and watched. After the time it takes to eat a meal, the Master said, "The dragon-brain has turned to liquid." The emperor rose and pressed his ear close—indeed, he heard the sound of dripping. They drank again, and after a short while, she showed him the bottle: it was now filled with liquid as clear as a ladle of water. The next day, they opened it to find half a bottle full, its fragrance far more potent than before.

Later, the Master conceived. One day, she told the emperor, "Tonight, I shall give birth. The divine grandson, the sagely child, is truly within me. Please prepare all that is needed for the delivery." The emperor arranged everything and ordered palace women to stay with her through the night. At midnight, a violent wind and thunder shook the halls, terrifying all inside. Yet that night, she did not give birth. By dawn, her belly had returned to its usual size. The emperor, astonished, asked what had happened. She said, "Last night, amid the thunder and lightning, I bore a child—only for a divine being to take him away. He is lost to us now."

The Master loved wine, and her desires for men and women differed little from those of ordinary people. Later, she too died of illness. In ancient times, immortals often concealed their traces among the common folk—was she one of them?

When I was once in Jiangnan, I often heard tales of her, though the secrets of the palace were recounted with many variations. After Jiangnan was pacified, I was in the capital and visited Xu Shugeng, who was the grandson of Yi Zu. He knew all the affairs of the palace. I questioned him about these events, and he told me the full account.

---
Pan Yi was the son of Pan Peng, a judicial assessor of the Court of Judicial Review. In his youth, he lived in Hezhou, gathering firewood on Yinglong Mountain to support his parents. Once, he crossed the river to Jinling and moored his boat at the mouth of the Qinhuai.

An old man once asked to share his boat to cross the river, and Yi, respecting his age, agreed. At the time, a heavy snow was falling, so Yi bought wine for them to drink together. By the time they reached the middle of the river, the wine had run out. Yi deeply regretted not having brought enough to get drunk. The old man said, "I too have wine." He then untied his headscarf, took a small gourd from his topknot, and poured from it—no matter how much they drank, the wine never ran dry. Yi was astonished and held him in even greater reverence. Upon reaching the shore, the old man said to Yi, "You are filial in serving your parents and also possess the qi of the Dao—you are teachable." He then imparted Daoist arts to him. From then on, Yi’s actions became uncanny, and the world called him Immortal Pan. He could scoop mercury into his hands, and when he pressed it, it would turn to silver. Once, entering a household, he saw a pond with many fallen leaves and said to the owner, "These can be made into a game." He had someone scoop them up with a utensil and place them on the ground; as the leaves varied in size, they all turned into fish. When thrown back into the water, the leaves returned to their original state.

There was a man named Ji Liang who often visited the home of a relative. One day, several guests were seated together when they saw Yi passing by the door. The host called him in, and he entered. Ji then said to Yi, "Master, please perform a trick to entertain the guests." Yi replied, "Very well." Glancing at an iron anvil before the door, he said to the host, "Lend me this anvil for a game." Once it was brought in, Yi took out a small knife and finely chopped it until it was completely minced. The seated guests were stunned. Then Yi said, "One should not damage borrowed things." He gathered the pieces together, and the anvil was restored as before. He also took out an old square kerchief from his sleeve and said to the others, "Do not underestimate this—unless someone is in dire need, do not borrow it from me. Others simply cannot obtain it." He then raised it to cover his face and took several steps backward, vanishing from sight.

He could recite from memory books he had never seen before. Sometimes a sealed scroll would be placed before him, and upon being given the first character, he would recite the entire volume without error. Even corrections, deletions, or emendations within the text—he knew them all. Many of his feats were of this kind, but they cannot all be recorded here. Later, he too died of illness.

A Recluse of Runzhou
A recluse of Runzhou, whose name is lost, was lofty in conduct and possessed the Dao/Way. The people all respected and trusted him. When An Renyi rebelled, the people of the prefecture were terrified and all wished to flee. Someone said, "The recluse remains here in tranquility—surely there will be no harm." Thereupon, the people gradually settled. The recluse had a close friend who took his family beyond the prefectural borders to avoid the disaster. His friend had a daughter who was already married and could not accompany them, so he entrusted her to the recluse. The recluse agreed.

Later, as the siege grew urgent, the recluse said to the woman, "Bring me one item from your household, and I will enable you to escape danger." She then fetched a knife from her home and brought it to him. The recluse pressed his hand along the edge of the blade, then returned it to her, saying, "Simply hold this, standing upright and composed. When troops emerge from the city, follow them out, and you will come to no harm." She did as instructed, and though she was among a vast crowd, no one saw her. Several dozen *li* beyond the city, at a village inn, she saw her brother, who was also there.

The woman approached her brother, yet he did not see her. She then cast the knife into the water and returned, whereupon her brother saw her. Startled, he asked, "How have you come here?" She recounted all that had occurred. Her brother bade her retrieve the knife and hold it once more, but she could no longer conceal her form.

Later, the city fell, and the recluse’s whereabouts became unknown.

When General Zhong Chuan of Hongzhou was stationed there, he once dispatched a subordinate officer, Yan, on a mission to the Zhe region. Arriving in Hangzhou during the Cold Food Festival, Yan saw the townspeople streaming out of the city, men and women thronging the roads. He too went out to observe and saw an elderly couple drinking together in the wilds. Suddenly, the old man rose upon a cloud, and the crowd erupted in clamor. The old woman looked up and wept bitterly, whereupon the cloud descended some dozen *zhang*. The old man reached down to comfort her, then ascended once more, rising until he vanished from sight. The Ai family of Hongzhou, who had known Yan previously, heard this account directly from him.

Shi Gonggao was the younger brother of Shi Gongzhu, a great general of Jiangnan. Of a serene and unassuming nature, he delighted in the Dao and was never seen to express joy or anger. If others troubled him, he took no offense.

Having attained high rank and prosperity, he wore fine and elegant clothing. Yet whenever he visited others’ homes, he would remove his outer garments and sit without regard for the formalities of host and guest. Upon departing, he might mistakenly don another’s worn and shabby clothes, entirely unaware. If someone pursued him with his proper garment, he would only then realize and exchange them.

Minister of Personnel Zhang Han overs

The scholar Li Sheng once traveled among the Western Mountains of Hongzhou, where he drank with the recluse Lu Qi and five or six companions on a snowy night. During the gathering, one guest remarked, "With snow like this, surely none can venture out." Sheng replied, "Where would you wish to go? I can journey there." The man then said, "I have books in Xingzi—could you fetch them for me?" Sheng answered, "Certainly," and departed. Before the drinking ended, he returned bearing the books on his shoulder. Xingzi lay over three hundred *li* from the Western Mountains.

At the Youwei Abbey, a Daoist priest had once shown Sheng disrespect. Sheng declared, "I cannot kill him, but I shall make him fear me." One day, as the priest slept behind closed doors, Sheng instructed a servant boy to knock and demand Li the Recluse’s dagger. The priest rose to find the dagger plunged into the pillow before him, its blade still quivering. From then on, he changed his ways and treated Sheng with reverence.

In Jiankang, a destitute man lived outside the eastern altar gate of the city’s outer wall, near the wild waters. He built a small hut, just large enough to shelter himself, containing only a few household utensils and nothing more. Each day, he entered the city, claiming to beg for alms, yet he did not wander the streets or markets but only roamed the temples at leisure. The people came to know him, and the patrol officer reported his case to the throne. The sovereign ordered his origins investigated and his desires questioned. When asked, he sought nothing. It was bitterly cold at the time, and officials were distributing winter robes to the poor. Seeing his extreme thinness, they offered him a lined garment, but he declined. Pressed to accept, he took it only to pass it on to another. Puzzled, the officials followed him, compelling him to move his dwelling to observe his destination.

He then demolished the hut and moved to the southwest of Xuanwu Lake, within the orchard of the eunuch Zhang Mouguo. The land was overgrown and desolate, with wild waters as before. Again, he built a hut by the water’s edge and dwelt there. For days, heavy snow fell, and the orchard workers saw no sign of his comings or goings, suspecting he had frozen to death. Upon inspection, they found the hut in ruins and declared, “He must be dead.” They reported this to the authorities. When officials arrived to uncover the hut and investigate, they found him soundly asleep in the snow. Startled, he rose, showing no trace of cold. Then he departed, and none knew where he went.

Chen Yunsheng
Chen Yunsheng was a native of Raozhou. People called him "Chen of a Hundred Years." From youth, he was quiet and reticent, fond of the Dao. Though his family had long been hunters, Yunsheng alone refused to eat their meat and would not speak with others. At the age of ten, he journeyed to Longhu Mountain to enter the Dao, dwelling in seclusion so deep that few ever saw him. Even when his family caught sight of him, he would flee without a glance back. During the Tianyou era, he was seen on Magu Mountain in Fuzhou. By then, seventy years had passed since he left home, yet his countenance remained as it was in youth. In the Shengyuan era, the prefect Wei Quanfeng, who had heard of his extraordinary nature, welcomed him to the prefectural seat and provided him a chamber of his own. Yet at times, he would vanish without a trace.

One night as he sat in meditation, Quanfeng said to him, "The oranges of Fengcheng are most excellent—I find myself longing for them." Yunsheng replied, "There happens to be a boatload of oranges moored at Laocheng Harbor at this moment. I shall fetch them for you." The harbor lay fifteen *li* from the city, yet in but a short while he returned, cradling a cloth sack containing several hundred oranges. They ate them together.

On another occasion, Quanfeng was preparing a wedding gift for a relative and had purchased gold in the prefectural seat, only to find the amount insufficient. He grew angry and berated his subordinates. Yunsheng said, "Do not be vexed. I can provide what is needed." He took thick paper, coated it with an elixir, and cast it into the fire—whereupon it turned to gold. Thus, the need was met.

Later, when Quanfeng went to war against Wu’s forces, Yunsheng departed, warning him, "Take care not to enter the pass." Quanfeng failed to heed the warning and was indeed defeated at Ivory Pool.

Chen Shu

Chen Shu was a Daoist of Shantan Abbey in Xinzhou. People called him "Chen of a Hundred Years," though in truth no one knew his age. He could walk hundreds of *li* in a day. Whenever the gentry of the prefecture held a banquet, they would always leave an empty seat in anticipation of his arrival, and he never failed to appear, no matter the distance.

When Emperor Liezu heard of him and summoned him, the messenger had not yet arrived when Shu suddenly sighed, "I am old—what benefit could I bring to the state, that I should be troubled with this summons?" Several days later, the messenger arrived. Though summoned a second time, he refused to go.

During the Baoda era, he would often burn incense alone in the courtyard at night, gaze heavenward, bow in prayer, then withdraw and weep bitterly. Soon after, warfare erupted along the Huai River, and people believed he had foreseen it. Later, he crossed the Yangtze and took up residence at the abandoned Jingxing Abbey in Yongxing, where he built a hut and lived in solitude. Tigers and leopards often followed him, though few ever saw him. When he died, his body was not encoffined for several days, yet sweat covered him entirely.

Zhang Xun’s Wife

Zhang Xun was an officer under the Wu Taizu. His mouth was unusually large, earning him the nickname "Zhang Big-Mouth." While the Wu Taizu was stationed in Xuanzhou, he once distributed armor to his generals. The set Zhang received was old and shabby, and his dissatisfaction showed in his words and expression. His wife said to him, "This is not worth fretting over. The Minister of Instruction is unaware—had he known, he surely would not have given it to you." The next day, the Wu Lord asked Zhang, "How is the armor you received?" Zhang told him the truth, and the Lord exchanged it for another. Later, when the Wu Lord moved to Guangling, he bestowed horses upon his generals. The one Zhang received was again weak and slow, and he was once more displeased. His wife repeated her earlier advice. The following day, the Wu Lord asked him again, and Zhang spoke as before. The Lord said, "...Do you worship spirits at home?" Zhang replied, "No." The Lord said...

"When I was in Xuanzhou, I once bestowed armor upon my generals. That night, I dreamed of a woman clad in a pearl-embroidered robe, who said to me: 'The armor you gave Zhang Xun is most shabby—you ought to exchange it for him.' When I questioned you the next day, it proved true, and so I replaced it for you. Now, having bestowed horses upon my generals, I dreamed again of that same pearl-robed woman, who told me: 'The horse given to Zhang Xun is no fine steed.' What is the reason for this? Xun himself could not fathom it.

Xun’s wife owned a clothes chest, which she always opened and closed herself, and Xun had never seen inside. One day, when his wife was out, he secretly opened it and found a pearl-embroidered robe within. Upon her return, his wife asked him: 'Did you open my clothes chest?' Initially, she would always wait for her husband before eating. One day, when Xun returned, his wife had already eaten, saying: 'Today the food tasted strange, so I did not wait for you.' Xun entered the kitchen and saw a steamed human head in the rice. His heart turned against her, and he secretly resolved to kill her. His wife said to him: 'Do you mean to betray me? Yet you are soon to be a prefect of several commanderies—I cannot kill you.' Pointing to a maidservant, she added: 'If you wish to kill me, you must kill her first. Otherwise, you will not escape.' Xun then killed both his wife and the maidservant. Later, he indeed became a prefect.

Dong Shaoyan
Dong Shaoyan was a man who could discern others’ potential. Once, he visited Li Jian, the military governor of Ezhou, who presented his sons for Shaoyan to meet. At the time, a young servant named He Jingmei stood by Li Jian’s side. Shaoyan said: 'All your sons will attain high rank, yet none will surpass this servant.' Later, He Jingmei rose through the ranks to become a military governor and a renowned general of his time.

When the Founding Ancestor was stationed in Runzhou, Shaoyan was in his service. He often assessed the officers in the garrison, ranking their qualities. A certain Lan Yansi said to him: 'Your words often prove accurate.' Shaoyan replied: 'Say no more—our young lord will not meet a good end.' Yansi said: 'I am but a military officer; if I die by the sword, it is my duty. What is there to speak of?' Shaoyan said: 'Would you rather die beneath a fine blade?' Later, when a fire broke out in the city, the garrison made preparations, crafting many buckets to store water. The soldiers, however, seized the opportunity to take up buckets and blades and rebel. Yansi perished in the chaos.

A Soldier of Prince Wei
Prince Wei, the Founding Ancestor’s son, was stationed in Xuanzhou. Among his soldiers was a man whose name is lost, whose household consisted only of himself and his wife. One day, the husband returned from outside, asked for water to bathe, changed into fresh clothes, and sat upon a rope bed—then died. His wife, seeing this, was greatly startled and said: 'Have you died?' Without weeping, she bathed, changed her clothes, and sat facing her husband—then passed away. Prince Wei buried them together in a single grave.

Shen Fen
At the end of the Tang, Shen Fen, a censor, retired from office and delighted in the Dao."

A man with two concubines once said to them, "If I should die, would you weep for me?" The concubines were greatly startled and said, "How could you speak such inauspicious words?" He pressed them, and they replied, "If it were so, how could we not weep?" Shen Fen said, "Weep for me now, that I may see." At first, they refused, but he insisted without cease. The concubines fled to avoid him, but he seized and steadied them. Unable to resist, one finally said, "Simply ascend the bed and sit." Shen Fen did as she said. The two concubines stood on either side, clutching his sleeves, and wept. When they finished, they looked—Shen Fen had already passed away.

A Youth of Qianzhou
In Qianzhou, there was an officer named Zhong who sailed a boat to Guangling. Passing Taihe Garrison, he moored and went ashore, where he saw a youth of refined and elegant appearance. The youth also sought passage to Yangzhou. Zhong agreed, and they traveled together. Once, while ashore by the river, they walked through the market, where Zhong saw a pig’s head at a butcher’s stall. He wished to buy it but had no money. The youth said, "This is a small matter." Upon returning to the boat, he produced the pig’s head from his sleeve and said, "I took it earlier for lack of coin, but now I shall repay its value." He returned to the butcher and said, "I will pay you first; I will return shortly for the meat." The butcher took the money but did not retrieve the meat.

When they reached Guangling, Zhong and the youth lodged together at an inn. One day, several roguish young men came to the inn to amuse themselves. The youth pointed to a servant in black and said, "This one will surely be a thief tonight—guard against him." Zhong did not fully believe him. In the middle of the night, he heard the sound of a wall being breached. When the hole was large enough for a head to pass, he thrust his own through with a candle and seized the thief—it was indeed the one the youth had pointed out. He said to the thief, "You have not yet taken anything, so I will not kill you." He let the man go.

Later, the youth suddenly said to Zhong, "We cannot stay here long." He urged him to return home. Zhong did as he said.

When they reached Rishao, Zhu Jin killed someone in Changhua City, causing great alarm and disturbance.

There was a recluse from Minzhong named Zhang Biao, who possessed Daoist arts and could communicate with the netherworld. Sometimes he would lie as if dead for three or five days, yet his body remained warm. Upon reviving, he often spoke of matters in the underworld. Whatever he foretold invariably came to pass, and the people of the prefecture deeply believed in him. A man named Wang Baoyi had served as a general in Min during the late Tang, carrying an imperial edict to the court when the roads became impassable. He took to the sea but drowned. His grandson, Wang Kan, remained in Min and, due to a family member’s illness, asked Zhang Biao to pray to the netherworld on their behalf. Biao complied and said, "I saw your grandfather in the Water Palace, where he holds an office in the underworld." He recounted the details of Wang’s family affairs, all of which were accurate.

In Hongzhou, a scholar named Cheng Youwen served as Recorder. His residence faced a thoroughfare, with a window overlooking the street. One day, as he sat by the window after the rain had cleared, the ground was muddy with only a narrow path. He saw a young boy selling shoes, looking extremely poor. A wicked youth encountered his elder brother, and in their scuffle, a shoe fell into the mud. The boy wept, begging for its price, but the youth scolded him and refused. The boy said, "My family has had nothing to eat since morning. I was waiting to sell these shoes for food, but now they’re all ruined." A passing scholar took pity on him and compensated him for the shoe. The wicked youth grew angry and said, "The boy came to me for money—what business is it of yours?" He then cursed the scholar, who showed signs of anger. Cheng admired the scholar’s righteousness, called him over, and spoke with him, finding him extraordinary. He invited the scholar to stay the night. As they conversed late into the night, Cheng briefly went inside. When he returned, the scholar had vanished. Though all the doors were locked, he could not be found. Moments later, the scholar reappeared and said, "That evil youth came, and I could not tolerate him. I have already cut off his head." He threw it to the ground. Cheng was shocked and said, "This man was indeed a gentleman, but to cut off someone’s head and leave blood on the ground—won’t this implicate you?" The scholar replied, "Do not worry." He took out a small amount of medicine, applied it to the head, and rubbed the hair, which turned to water. He then said to Cheng, "I have nothing to repay you, but I wish to give you this protective art." Cheng said, "I am not a man of the Daoist realm and dare not accept your teaching." The scholar bowed deeply and left. Though all the gates were locked, he disappeared without a trace.

During the time when Emperor Taizu of Wu was the Commander of the Eight Garrisons of Luzhou, he arrived at Santan and rested on the riverbank. A fisherman rowed his boat directly before him and presented several fish, saying, "These are the scales of your descendants, generation after generation." Then, pointing in all four directions, he said, "All these are your mountains and rivers." The Emperor found this strange and tried to give him something, but the fisherman left without a glance.

Qu Tong, styled Wuting, took his style as his name and was a native of Chenxi in Chenzhou. He had arched eyebrows, a broad forehead, a long nose, and bright eyes. He was diligent in his duties but spoke little. In the fourth year of the Dali era, Yang Lin, a defeated general from Xichuan, became the governor of Liyang. He failed to restrain his troops, allowing his subordinate Jia Zihua to lead a thousand men through Wuling to plunder the Five Streams. The people of the Five Streams fled in all directions. At the time, Wuting was fourteen. He accompanied his mother to Wuling and took refuge in the side residence of Daoist Huang Shanbao of Taoyuan Abbey in Chongyi Township. Wuting, through Shanbao, expressed his wish to become a disciple of Huang Dongyuan, a master of the Shangqing Three Caverns. Shanbao introduced him, fully conveying Wuting’s aspirations. Dongyuan declined, saying that Wuting had to care for his mother and needed fine food. Shanbao replied, "Wuting’s mother is in my care, and I am fortunate to have enough to provide for her. If you would accept him despite his poverty, I hope you will take him in." Dongyuan agreed and later occasionally provided Wuting’s mother with clothing and food. After just over two years, in the first month of the sixth year, Wuting’s mother passed away. After the burial, he served Dongyuan diligently and tirelessly. In all tasks, he worked hard without complaint. He would discard poor food, showing care and respect, and then eat. In the seventh month, Dongyuan went to Xiangyang to purchase medicine. Whenever he entered the market, he had Wuting carry his belongings, and Wuting would close his eyes and stand in the crowd. Dongyuan scolded him, saying, "If you sleep in the crowd, someone will steal your load." Wuting replied, "I am not sleeping; I am just bothered by the noise of the crowd." In the ninth month, Dongyuan returned south. When they reached Yicheng, over a hundred *li* from Xiangyang, Dongyuan suddenly said, "I left the incense burner with the innkeeper—what should we do?" Wuting asked to retrieve it and told Dongyuan to rest briefly while he waited. In no time, he returned with the burner. Dongyuan asked in surprise, and Wuting replied, "I feared you would be delayed on the road, so I hurried." Dongyuan believed him. In the second month of the seventh year, Hu Shuqing, the prefect of Langzhou, invited Dongyuan to the prefectural seat. Dongyuan went, leaving Wuting in the mountains to plant herbs and fruits. After twenty days, Dongyuan returned and asked Wuting if he had been anywhere. Wuting replied, "Since you left for the prefecture, I have been searching for a cave in the woods." Dongyuan asked what he had seen, and Wuting said, "I saw a stone chamber with a stone bed and a stone table." Dongyuan asked, "Where is this stone chamber?" Wuting replied, "About one and a half *li* away." Dongyuan was doubtful but did not press further. Another ten days later, Wuting found a chess piece in the garden. He presented it to Dongyuan and said, "This is a Qin man’s chess piece." Dongyuan found it strange and asked, "Who told you this? How do you know?" Wuting insisted, "It is truly a Qin man’s chess piece." Dongyuan examined it closely—it resembled a small turtle, smooth and lustrous like jade—and placed it in his green silk bag. Later, when he opened the bag to check, the seal was still intact, but the chess piece was gone. In the summer of the fourth month, Wuting suddenly told Dongyuan, "I wish to return to the mountain cave." At the time, there had been continuous heavy rain. Though Dongyuan was not entirely convinced, he ultimately did not go.

On the twenty-seventh day of the fifth month in the eighth year, Wuting rose at first light. Dongyuan sent him to the riverside to inspect a boat, a journey of no more than two *li* round-trip, yet he did not return until noon. Dongyuan reproached him: "Why so late?" Wuting replied, "About fifteen paces southwest of here, there stands a small bridge. On it, I met an elder, staff in hand and burden slung over his shoulder, who called me to follow. I dared not, and so returned late."

At dawn on the thirtieth day, Wuting removed his usual cloth sash and bound his waist with a paper cord. Barefoot, he donned straw sandals and ascended to the hall of veneration, where he burned incense and knelt in prostration before Dongyuan’s altar of cultivation. Then, bidding Dongyuan farewell, he bowed once more. Dongyuan, leaning on his desk, asked, "Where do you go when you leave me?" Wuting answered, "I return to the Transmitted Grotto." Dongyuan said, "May I follow you?" Wuting replied, "You may not." Dongyuan pressed, "Why not?" Wuting explained, "The venerable master did not summon you before, and so you may not now." He then advised Dongyuan to relocate his dwelling in due time. Dongyuan replied, "To change one’s abode every ten years was the teaching of the ancients—I have long held this intention. But when you leave, when shall I see you again?" Wuting answered, "After eighteen years."

Dongyuan sought to detain him but could not. He then called out to Zhu Lingfou, a Daoist of the same temple: "Master Zhu, come see the one who transmits the Way." Lingfou glanced at Wuting and remarked, "The boy’s countenance today shines with extraordinary radiance." Dongyuan’s disciples—Hu Qinghao, Zhu Shenjing, the novice Chen Jingxin, and Tan Bodi—all watched from the garden. Wuting, clad in a short hemp robe and black silk headscarf, stepped back hesitantly. After three retreating strides, he vanished suddenly. Dongyuan and the Daoist disciples stared in astonishment. Nearby stood a chestnut tree, and they wondered if he had concealed himself behind it. Searching, they found no trace. Dongyuan then struck the bell to gather the temple’s inhabitants, intending to scour the woods. As the gatekeepers reached the northeastern edge of the forest, a great serpent blocked their path.

In the eleventh year, Wuting’s elder brother, Juanxin, came from Chen Prefecture and heard of his brother’s ascent to the Transmitted Grotto. Journeying to Taoyuan, he became Dongyuan’s disciple and took up the Daoist path. Later, as the cliffs flourished with moss and vines, he traveled to Mount Song but vanished without a trace.

In the fourth month of the first year of the Jianzhong era, Dongyuan relocated to Mount Lu in Jiang Prefecture. In the eleventh month of the fifth year of the Zhenyuan era, he moved again to Maoshan in Run Prefecture. In the spring of the eighteenth year, a postal courier in Run Prefecture spotted a youth walking ahead of him along the border of Yanling County. Though the courier quickened his pace, he could not close the distance. The youth entered Maoshan, thirty *li* from Yanling, and the courier saw him stride unhurriedly through the mountain gate.

That day, the Daoist nun Xiao Lingran was at Crane Terrace when she saw a young man carrying a small lacquered box, its lid holding a plain letter. He had not yet reached the gate when he lifted one foot to step over the threshold. Lingran asked, "Who are you?"

He answered, "Qu Wuting."

Then he asked Lingran, "Where is the Venerable Master Huang?" Lingran pointed out the way, and Wuting noted the path in his topknot. Suddenly, he seemed not to comprehend, but after a long while, he abruptly understood. Straightaway, he gathered his robes and hastened to Dongyuan, asking, "Has Qu Wuting arrived?"

Dongyuan merely assented without giving a clear reply.

In the first decade of the eighth month after the new moon of autumn, Dongyuan addressed his disciples, saying, "I shall tread the azure sea; prepare my provisions." Some entreated him not to depart so soon. A year later, at noon, Dongyuan transformed and manifested in his true form, declaring, "I have been charged to transmit the traces of the boy Qu’s ascent to execution—all strange and bewildering. Since my youth, when I was demoted to serve as Prefect of Wuling, upon my arrival, I made careful inquiries of the elders, and their accounts were even more absurd. On a day of leisure, I wandered to the Yuan River, where it converges with the Canglang. A fisherman told me, 'Wuting had a fellow student named Chen Jingxin, who has lived in five places. Now he is a Daoist at Peach Blossom Spring Abbey, having changed his name to Tongwei and later to Zhengchang. At first, they shared toils equally, but over time, he refined his conduct.' A hundred dubious tales are not worth a single sighting."

Having obtained the opportunity, I forgot even to eat. I immediately ordered him to approach, yet before he arrived, it seemed I could scarcely bear the wait. When the appointed day came, the gate officer led Jingxin into the front courtyard. He wore a crown of green vine, a robe of jade-green, his countenance like ice, his skin like snow, with a snowy beard and hoary brows. His steps were measured, his bearing solemn, and as he spoke, I knew not whether to count myself fortunate or overjoyed.

Once he arrived and settled, I slowly recounted all that had perplexed me, and Jingxin provided a full and clear explanation. Thereupon, I tore open a case and recorded his words directly, to dispel future doubts.

Composed on the third day of the fifth month in the second year of Changqing by Wen Zao, Prefect of Langzhou. *A True Account of Chen Tongwei, Daoist of the Three Caverns of Supreme Clarity.*

This record was originally inscribed on bamboo slips, later effaced by meddlesome enthusiasts and re-engraved. Only a few characters remain on the side of the stele.
