**Lingjianzi’s Midnight-Noon Qi Circulation Record**
By Xu Jingyang

At midnight, the lesser yang qi arises from the yin phase, twisting and stretching with dynamic motion.

The *Scripture of the Primordial Origin* states: "During the hours of *xu*, *hai*, and *zi*, yin qi stirs and one falls asleep." Once asleep, qi stagnates in the hundred joints. Those who cultivate life shrink their limbs without aversion when sleeping and stretch them vigorously upon waking, ensuring the constructive and defensive qi circulate freely.

**Purging Qi Through Abdominal Resonance**
The *Method of Purging Qi*: Close the eyes and face upward. Rest both hands between the breasts, knees bent to the side. Lift the waist and back, then drum the qi in the Sea of Qi, causing it to revolve internally and externally. Exhale with a *he* sound, expelling it so no sound reaches the ears. Repeat nine or eighteen times.

Whenever one intends to ingest qi, one must first purge and exhale it, ensuring only the digestion of old food. Only after the qi is fully expelled may one regulate and ingest it.

When a qi-ingesting practitioner awakens:
If the tongue is dry and rough, indicating heat in the five viscera, open the mouth wide and exhale gently dozens of times. When saliva flows in the throat, the heat has receded, and the five viscera are cooled.

Spring the body upward, sit upright, and clasp the hands behind the neck. Lean back, raise the head, and sway left and right, causing the neck to contend with the hands.

Next, grasp the feet with the hands, slightly hold the breath, and draw in the qi of *Taichong*. The *Taichong* points—two in number—are located two *cun* behind the base joint of the big toe, in the depression between the bones. Pull as if drawing a bow; do the same for the right. As the *Dadong Zhenjing*’s "Massage Chapter" states: clasp the hands and bring them up to cover the back of the neck, tilt the face upward and raise the head, causing the neck to contend with the hands—do this three or four times. This harmonizes the essence, unblocks the blood, prevents wind-qi from entering, and if practiced long, averts illness.

When finished, bend and move the body, stretch the limbs to the four directions, arch backward, and pull to the sides, loosening and shaking all joints—do each three times. As *Huatuo’s Separate Biography* says: "The human body must be kept in motion, but not to excess. When the body is constantly in motion, grain-qi and blood flow freely. The hinge that is used does not rot, nor does flowing water stagnate—so too with the body." The Perfected One’s *daoyin* follows this principle.

The *Yuandao Jing* states: "Primordial qi is difficult to accumulate yet easy to disperse; the joints are easy to block yet hard to unblock. Thus, those who cultivate life take *daoyin* as their first priority. Once the breath is settled, inwardly visualize the spirit palaces: one *cun* between the brows is the *Bright Hall*; three *cun* deep is the *Cavern Chamber*; three *cun* above that is the upper *Cinnabar Field* and *Mud-Pill Palace*; the middle *Cinnabar Field* is the *Crimson Palace*; the lower *Cinnabar Field* is the *Qi Palace*—each has its spirit-person, hence called *spirit palaces*." Knock the teeth and molars: first tap the front teeth, making a faint sound.

"Then tap the molars, making a loud sound." The *Zhen’gao* states: "Tapping the teeth serves to alert the various spirits within the body; when the spirits do not scatter, ghostly *qi* cannot invade."

Press the four corners of the eyes. The *Taishang Sanguan Jing* says: "One should often use the hands to press the two corners of the eyes near the nose. Perform this while holding the breath, and stop when the *qi* flows through. Repeat continuously. Practicing this regularly enables the eyes to see clearly." It also says: "After completing *daoyin*, press the four corners of the eyes thirty-six times to induce vision of light. This is the method for examining the spirit of the eyes; with prolonged practice, one attains spiritual sight."

Rub the hands and warm the eyes. Stand the sides of the palms upright and rub them until they feel like fire, stopping when a sulfur-like *qi* arises. Then open the eyes and warm the pupils several times. This is called *Changju*.

The *Neijing* states: "Often press the small cavities behind the eyebrows thirty-six times. After a year, one can write in the dark." This may also be practiced discreetly at the philtrum without revealing the method. The small cavities behind the eyebrows are the *Upper Origin*, the mansion of the Six Harmonies, governing the transformation of eye halos, harmonizing the essence and radiance, lengthening the pupils, and refining the eyes. This is the supreme method for the Perfected One’s sitting and rising, also named *Changju* of the Perfected One. A true proverb says: "If you wish to write at night, cultivate *Changju*. The reason the Perfected One can observe all directions and illuminate the eight distant realms is truly due to the clarity of *Changju*."

The *Ziwei Furén Yǔ* says: "Look up to harmonize with the celestial truth; look down to press the mountain source." The celestial truth lies at the corners of the two eyebrows, while the mountain source is the philtrum beneath the nose. The corners of the two eyebrows are the bridge for penetrating vision, and the celestial truth is the upper chamber for drawing in spirits.

Irrigate the Central Peak. The *Xiaomo Jing* says: "Press the sides of the nose frequently, without counting. This calms one’s *qi*." This is called "irrigating the Central Peak," also known as "inscribing the emperor’s register."

Press the mountain source. The *Ziwei Furén* says: "Pressing the mountain source refers to the root of the philtrum beneath the nose, located in the small valley beside the nose." During the reign of Duke Zhuang of Chu, the market elder Song Laizi often swept the marketplace while singing: "The celestial court blooms with twin flowers; the mountain source blocks yin evil. At dawn, press the heavenly steed to visit the Great Clarity’s home. The Perfected One has no leisure to hide, thus dispelling the hundred evils." He sang this while begging for food, yet no one in the market understood his song. This beggar was Feng Yanshou, the Perfected One of the Western Peak and a historian during the reign of King Xuan of Zhou.

The hands are the heavenly steed, and the nose is the mountain source. Whenever traversing dangerous paths or passing by temples, if one harbors doubts or fears, first turn the tongue inward, swallow saliva once or twice, then use the second and third fingers of the left hand to press the root of the philtrum beneath the nostrils, at the inner edge of the nasal septum. The edge of the nasal septum is called the mountain source, also known as the ghost well, spirit pool, or soul terrace. Pressing the mountain source closes the ghost well’s gate; touching the spirit pool disperses the roots of evil; and approaching the soul terrace stations the Jade Perfected to guard the pass. Thus, the spirit root is stirred, celestial beasts come to protect, and the thousand spirits tremble and submit, unable to disturb my *qi*—this is the natural principle at work.

The mountain source beneath the nose is the martial ford of the body and the thoroughfare of truth and evil. Those who guard the truth thus suppress the myriad evils through their own movement and control.

Fortify the city walls. The *Xiaomo Jing* says: "Frequently press and rub the ears on both sides, without counting, to sharpen one’s hearing." This is called "fortifying the city walls," also known as "inscribing the imperial register."

Strike and explore the heavenly drum. The heavenly drum refers to the sound within the ears. Press the ear openings tightly with the palms and strike the occiput with the fingers. One should always desire the sound to be strong and continuous. Strike three times a day to benefit the lower *Cinnabar Field*. If the sound scatters, fails to continue, or lacks strength, the primordial *qi* is not gathered—one should adjust accordingly.

Wipe and rub the spirit court. The *Zhenzhu* says: "The face is the court of the spirit; the hair is the blossom of the brain. When the heart grieves, the face withers; when the brain diminishes, the hair turns white." The *Taisu Danjing* states: "On the face, one should often use both hands to wipe and rub until warm, following the contours up and down until thoroughly covered. This gives the face a lustrous glow and prevents wrinkles and blemishes. After five years of practice, one’s complexion becomes like that of a maiden." This is called "the *qi* of mountains and marshes communicating, ever full and never depleted." It also says: "Diligently practicing this, keeping the hands never far from the face, is best."

Pay homage to the Three Origins. The *Zhen’gao* says: "Smooth the hair with the hands as if combing it to prevent it from turning white. Place both hands on the forehead—this is called 'the hands paying homage to the Three Origins,' the method for solidifying the brain and strengthening the hair." Run the hands over the four sides of the head, smoothing the hair and tying it into knots, doing so frequently. The *Huangting Jing* says: "... the gods of the face reside in the *Mud-Pill Palace*; the nine Perfected of the *Mud-Pill Palace* each have their chambers, one *cun* square within."

Rub the Gate of Life. The *Huangting Jing* says: "The two water lords face the Gate of Life." The Gate of Life is the navel. Hold the inner *qi*, inflate the lower abdomen until full, then rub it for one full cycle.

Draw water from the mountain peak. This is a secret oral instruction. The *Qi* Sea connects with the kidneys, belonging to the *ren* and *gui* water, whose nature is to flow downward to the sea. It cannot ascend alone but must be paired with yang. When yang descends, yin responds by ascending.

Thus it transforms into clouds and mist, steaming into sweet rain, moistening and reviving the withered and parched—reaching every bone and orifice without exception. As Master Yanluo said: "Fire presses water into clouds, the Five Phases intermingle in misty harmony to achieve success." Master Qixuan also said: "Without exit, there is no entry; without descent, there is no ascent."

**Seeking Fire at the Sea’s Bottom.**
This is a secret oral instruction. Most people, lacking a master’s transmission, mistake the heart’s fire for true fire. Fire pertains to spirit, yet the inner crucible lies below the heart—if one takes the heart’s fire as fire, the fire remains above the vessel. Countless scriptures and discourses state: "Fire arises from below," never has fire been said to come from above. The *Zhouyi* hexagram *Water and Fire in Mutual Aid* shows water above and fire below—fire kindles beneath the navel, while water is born within the vessel. Thus it is said: "Water is drawn from the mountain’s peak, fire is kindled at the sea’s bottom." Within heavy yang, mercury is gathered; within heavy yin, lead is extracted. There is a path to practice and a time for gathering.

Those who steal this Dao without receiving the oral instructions suffer harm instead. The *Song of Master Tongzhen* says: "To connect the rootless tree, one must lift the lamp from the sea’s bottom." An ancient song also declares:
*"The elixir of return is formless in refinement,
Yet when primordial fire cooks it, it gradually takes shape.
You must trust the immortal’s path lies but a footstep away—
Brightly ascend, stepping into the azure heavens."*

**Nurturing the Tiger by Swallowing Qi.**
This is a secret oral instruction. Master Yin the Perfected said: "If you wish for longevity, ingest the inner qi." The *Suwen* states: "The sage transmits essence, the spirit ingests celestial qi to commune with divine luminosity." Celestial qi is the inner qi. The *Scripture of the Hidden Contract* says: "Heaven gives birth, heaven destroys—consuming the qi of primordial harmony. Neither heaven can destroy nor earth bury such a one; this is called a Perfected Person." Thus, those who cultivate the Dao eat the qi of primordial harmony when hungry and drink the water of the Flowery Pond when thirsty. This is what Laozi meant by "filling the belly."

If one has not yet ceased grain consumption but wishes to ingest qi, one must eat sparingly, ensuring the abdomen remains empty and pure. There is no fixed time—when the belly is empty, then swallow. Yet the necessity of oral instructions lies in this: ingesting qi requires distinguishing inner from outer, discerning purity from turbidity, and differentiating the throat’s pathways. Without distinguishing inner from outer, one inhales perverse qi; without discerning purity from turbidity, there is no measure of balance; without differentiating the throat’s pathways, the qi does not enter the stomach’s cavity.

**Stealing the Dragon by Swallowing Saliva.**
This is a secret oral instruction. The human body’s essence originates beneath the Northern Culmen’s primordial spring. This primordial spring is the True One. From the Cinnabar Field, it ascends to the two orifices beneath the tongue, called *Divine Water* and *Flowery Pond*. Chew until thick—masters of nurturing life call this *refining essence to embrace emptiness*. Swish and churn it into the Great Medicine, completing one full cycle of the heavens. Only when the Red Dragon cannot bear its weight is it deemed the heavy treasure of lead and mercury.

Inwardly visualize the divine palace, gently exhale, and swallow with intention, ensuring the throat emits a sound as it descends into the Cinnabar Field to congeal—pure and white like a pearl. The *Song of the Purple River Carriage* says:
*"Left is the sun, right the moon—
Two halves ascend to merge as one.
Emerging from the Jade Pool, entering the Golden Chamber,
Large as a pellet, golden as a tangerine.
Within lies a sweetness like honey—
If you obtain it, guard it well.
Cultivate it rightly, and the immortal’s path is complete."*

The *Scripture of Inner Radiance* also states: "Beneath the tongue, the Dark Gullet forms a lofty shore." And: "The Jade Pool’s pure water irrigates the numinous root—cultivate it rightly, and life endures." The *Record of Longevity from Red City* says: "The body’s fluids, unless swished and swallowed, cannot irrigate the five viscera to manifest their radiance."

**Li Hexagram employs the Nine; Kan Hexagram employs the Six.**
Master Taibai the Perfected said: "The Five Phases reverse to guard the body—dragons emerge from within fire." When the Five Phases do not proceed in order, tigers are born within water. He also said: "To know the art of reversal, observe how mutual conquest becomes mutual generation." And: "To grasp reversal through Li and Kan, recognize floating and sinking to determine host and guest."

The *Song of the Thatched Hut* says:
*"If you wish to learn longevity,
First calculate the Five Phases.
If the Five Phases are not reversed,
The elixir of return cannot form."*

Only when one comprehends the reversal of the Five Phases does one understand how harm lies within benefit, and how harm itself becomes benefit. Master Luoju said: "I often see good within misfortune—good arises from misfortune first." The *Scripture of the Hidden Contract* speaks of "the five thieves of heaven—those who see them prosper."

Observe heaven, earth, and the myriad things—nothing exists without reversal. Yet one must recognize the true Five Phases to grasp the art of reversal. Master Cao the Perfected said: "The Five Phases exist everywhere—how could a true person hoard them? Joyfully recognize the Five Phases’ truth, and one water returns one stone." Master Zheng the Perfected said: "The Dao is the interplay of one yin and one yang; the elixir is the interplay of one water and one stone." Another song says:
*"To obtain gold within lead,
And water within stone—
For gold emerges from water,
And liquid from stone."*

This is what is meant by "heaven and earth establish positions, and the *Yi* moves within them."

**At noon in the south, the qi of Great Yin rides upon residual yang—practice tranquil sitting.**
Tranquil sitting is what Confucians call "concealing the spirit" and Buddhists call "sitting in meditation." Master Zuoxuan the Perfected said: "Those who wish to cultivate life must set aside external affairs, preventing them from disturbing the heart. Then, sit calmly and inwardly observe the heart—if a single thought arises, extinguish it immediately. The method requires a pure chamber, loose clothing, crossed legs, and a stable, closed-eyed posture. Do not contemplate good or evil, and the primordial qi will naturally return, abiding in stillness."

**Regulating the Breath.**
Master Taibai the Perfected taught Master Chonghe: "The spirit’s hut is the nose." To stabilize the qi of primordial harmony, first purify the chamber and regulate the breath until it is faint and subtle. Too shallow is the gate of life; too deep is the path of death—thus, the pivot of life and death lies here.

Opening it is not permissible, closing it is difficult—only allow it to be faint. Yet if too faint, it must not rush forth from the mouth. Thus the *Daodejing* says: "Subtle and continuous, as if existing; its use is never exhausted." Master Rongcheng exhaled the old and inhaled the new, observing the nose’s egress and ingress. The *Neiguan Jing* states: "Primordial qi enters the nose and irrigates the mud-pill palace." The *Baoshen Jing* says: "To attain longevity, nothing surpasses regulating the marrow gate—the marrow gate is the gate of the mysterious female." With the heart free from external distractions, the *Huangting Jing* states: "One inch below the navel is called the lower cinnabar field." The *Song of Master Liu the Perfected* says: "To achieve immortality and abide in heaven, you must guard the primordial qi within the cinnabar field." Generally, the heart free from external distractions is the method for the true person’s initial cultivation of the Dao. The essential technique of "withdrawing sight and reversing hearing" means that breath does not leave the nose, and thoughts do not depart from the body. The *Daodejing* says: "Though there be splendid sights, remain serene and transcendent." The noble person, though active all day, does not stray from their heavy baggage—this is the meaning.

**Directing Qi with Spirit.**
Master Yin the Perfected said: "If the spirit can direct qi, the nose will not lose its breath." The true person uses spirit as the chariot and qi as the horse, traveling all day without faltering. From above, reaching the mud-pill palace, and below, the life gate—when these two realms communicate, the aged and infirm may be saved. If exhalation lacks the spirit’s governance, a single breath is incomplete. If inhalation lacks the spirit’s governance, a single breath is incomplete. If in every breath spirit and qi unite, mother and child never part, then inner coagulation occurs, and even death cannot be sought. After the work is accomplished, in men the Pass of Origin does not store essence, and in women the region below the navel does not congeal an infant. If spirit and qi each scatter, emotions are led by desire, primordial qi descends, and self-control is lost, leading to the sorrow of dissipation. If in every breath spirit and qi hold fast, mother and child do not part, and though there be union, it is ever savored as flavorless—this is the attainment of the technique. In the Western Regions, Mahākāśyapa preserved his form, and Maming and Nāgārjuna both mastered this, transmitting it secretly to the world. Those who hear of this have accumulated blessings over many lives and share a karmic affinity with the immortal register—only then may they encounter it. An ancient song says:
*"If you wish for long life, learn to subdue the heart;
Do not observe other matters, past or present.
But in quiescence, let spirit and qi unite—
What worry then of not entering the groves of immortality?"*

**Closing the Spirit’s Hut to Stabilize the Fire Times.**
The *Song of Master Caoyi* says: "Refining lead and mercury occurs before noon; when the first yin arises, it breaks the qian trigram." Thus, those who cultivate life ingest qi during yang hours and only practice breath-holding after noon to refine yin. As the *Chicheng Record* states: "Refining qi is breath-holding." Holding the breath for a thousand days severs the five viscera’s exchange, halts the six bowels’ transmission, stills the hundred vessels, and the hundred passes naturally harmonize. Spirit and qi govern themselves, and the myriad transformations stabilize. Heaven and earth cannot steal the body, yin and yang cannot decay the form. From one to ten, from ten to a hundred, from a hundred to a thousand: holding the breath for one hundred twenty counts is the lesser vehicle; for one thousand two hundred, the middle vehicle; for twelve thousand, the greater vehicle. Calculating day and night, there are thirteen thousand five hundred breaths, with five hundred forty movements of exhalation and inhalation comprising one breath—immortality is not far. The technique is profound: empty the mind of thoughts, sit upright with head raised, close the eyes, and hold the breath. Use the second joint of the right hand’s second finger—the so-called "gate of life and death," the dwelling of the spirit—and press it with prayer beads while silently counting. If the breath becomes urgent, gently turn the throat to the right; do not let it grow too urgent, for urgency may cause a slight exhalation of external qi, which should then be reabsorbed. This is the oral instruction.

**Reopening the Gate of Life to Return to Infancy.**
Fetal breathing is the method of embracing the One and guarding the center. The infant in the womb draws qi through the umbilical cord; after ten months, leaving the womb, it draws qi through the spirit’s hut. The true person’s nose has no egress or ingress, their breath deep and profound. The *Daodejing*’s "return to infancy" refers to fetal breathing. The *Song of Fetal Breathing* says:
*"When nose and mouth cease breathing,
Only then is the work of fetal breathing achieved.
Though dwelling within the cosmos,
It is as if still in the womb."*
Ordinary people believe the navel is the gate of life, but when it is sealed, qi cannot escape. After the navel is emptied and breath is sought, breath naturally exits from this place, and the nose has no breath. Cross the legs and sit upright, placing both hands over the navel—this is to store the One after emptying the navel, so that breath naturally emerges from here. When the sacred embryo congeals within, clasp the hands firmly and remain unmoving—half the path of life-preservation is understood. From *zi* to *wu* is refining yang; from *wu* to *you* is refining yin. Yang governs movement, yin governs stillness. Yang must not overflow, yin must not be obscured. When yin is balanced and yang is secure, spirit and essence are well-ordered. Yet knowing this is not difficult; perseverance without interruption is key. Aligning with the Dao, inner and outer progress together, and the matter of the returned elixir may be discussed.

The *Discourse on the Valley Spirit* speaks of containing saliva and refining qi, exhaling the old and inhaling the new, ascending to the mud-pill palace and descending to the cinnabar field—this is inner elixir. The yang dragon and yin tiger, the liquid of wood and the essence of metal—when these two breaths meet and are refined, it is called outer elixir. Those who cultivate the Dao first complete the inner elixir, then refine the outer medicine; when inner and outer correspond, they become perfected immortals. Master Yanluo said: "When the true outer elixir responds, gold naturally arrives." The Hua Mountain adept said: "Refining only true qi without refining the elixir, even if long-lived, transformations will be difficult." Master Dingji also said: "Though you may be a guest of long life, you are not yet an immortal who ascends with your dwelling. You must further refine the great medicine to truly become a flying immortal."

**The Induction Formula**

Combine breath-holding until full, then release gently if strained. Raise and support once to regulate the Triple Burner—both hands push upward with all strength, as if propping up the heavens, three times on each side.

Left for the liver, right for the lungs, like drawing a bow to shoot. First draw left, then right, with full force as before.

East for the liver, single support; west to connect the kidneys. Right hand clenched, pressing the right kidney’s chamber, left hand pushing upward with all strength. Left hand clenched, pressing the left kidney’s chamber, right hand pushing upward with all force, three times on each side.

Turn to relieve the Five Labors and harmonize the Seven Injuries. Right hand grasping left elbow to turn left; left hand grasping right elbow to turn right, each with full force, three repetitions.

The swimming fish sways its tail to open the heart-viscera—extend both arms and sway them, the more repetitions the better.

Grasp both feet to regulate the waist. Sit upright, legs stretched, take the soles of the feet with both hands, pulling with full force three times.

Next, strike the Heavenly Drum thirty-six times: cover both ears with the hands, click the teeth thirty-six times, then tap the bone behind the ears with the second finger.

*The Induction Formula of Master Lingjian, recorded for midnight and noon, is complete.*
