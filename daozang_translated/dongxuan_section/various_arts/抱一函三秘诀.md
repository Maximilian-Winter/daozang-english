### **The Secret Formula of Embracing the One and Encompassing the Three**

**Fu Xi’s Precelestial Diagram of the Primordial Beginning**
The method follows the leftward rotation from *Qian* to *Zhen*, and the rightward turn from *Kun* to *Xun*, resembling the coiled state of the Precelestial Trigram Array.
Heaven and Earth establish their positions; mountains and marshes commune in *qi*. Thunder and wind contend; water and fire do not oppose each other.
*Qian* and *Kun* fix their positions above and below, serving as the Great Crucible.
*Kan* and *Li* reside in the center, serving as the Mechanism of Transformation.

The single yang of *Qian* is called *nature*—termed *yang essence*, also *Heavenly Soul*, likened to silver ore, for it is the threefold root of the One *Qi*.
This is the *Original Spirit*, which, after conception, is stored in the *Kun* Palace—what is meant by "concealed in *Hai*, activated in *Ren*, born in *Zi*, and flourishing in *Gui*."
Thus, the One *Qi* transforms and returns to the Central Palace, becoming the *Elixir Mother*.

**On the Human Body After Conception**
After the union of father and mother, the Precelestial One *Qi* responds and generates—this fleeting, responsive attachment is called *nature*, concealed within the *Kun* Palace between the two kidneys.
At the moment of conception, the seed is implanted here, yet it is not the substance formed by the parents’ essence and blood.
Scholars must deeply understand this: it is without form yet possesses *qi*—this is one’s original countenance.
Before birth, it is called *Yin Metal*, also the *Metal Mother* or *Metal Consort*. Though metal is inherently yang, it remains formless within the primordial chaos, hence termed *Yin Metal*.
This reveals the principle of *yin* and *yang* mutually generating one another.

After birth, it is called *Yang Lead*. By its material nature, lead, before forming in the ore’s womb, first receives the natural numinous essence of Heaven and Earth, giving rise to the *Silver Bell*. This bell, born of numinous *qi*, solidifies into black lead only upon refinement.
Just as before the parents’ union, there exists the *Empty Qi Metal Womb*—this is the *Original True Seed*.
For example, the numinous essence coalesces into lead ore.
When parents unite to shape form, the original true nature is implanted within, thus *nature* is the *True Lead*.
Lead is the mother of the Five Metals; all things under Heaven and Earth are produced through lead *qi*.
As the *Daoist Scripture* states: *"That which is named is the mother of the myriad things."*
Thus, Master Zhenyi said: *"Directly pointing to the numinous root of Heaven and Earth, it becomes the ancestor of the medicine; clearly observing the sagely mother of yin and yang, it serves as the foundation of the elixir."* This is it.
It is the essence of Heaven and Earth’s primordial union, also called *Flowing Essence* or *Earthly Soul*.
In the Five Phases, it belongs to water—this is what is meant by *"Heavenly One generates water."*
Though it belongs to water, it is called *Yang Lead* because its water possesses the yang nature of metal.
Thus, it is called the *Sagely Mother of Yin and Yang*, revealing the principle of lead and silver mutually generating.
This principle and the earlier principle of *Flowing Metal* differ in name but share the same meaning. One should ponder this deeply to perceive the subtleties of creation.
This is the source of the One *Qi*—the *Original Essence Metal Mother* resides in the *Kun* Palace. Through wondrous activation, its *qi* ascends with the yang *qi*.
As the *Scripture of the Dragon and Tiger* states: *"Metal and fire must be directly engaged."*
*Metal* is the *yin* womb; *fire* is the yang *qi*.
When the single yang of *Qian* intersects *Kun*, it becomes *Zhen*; when two yangs intersect *Kun*, it becomes *Kan*; when three yangs intersect *Kun*, it becomes *Gen*.
When the single yin of *Kun* intersects *Qian*, it becomes *Xun*; when two yins intersect *Qian*, it becomes *Li*; when three yins intersect *Qian*, it becomes *Dui*.
Thus, the *Elixir Scriptures* state that the Six Voids generate *Kan*, *Li*, *Kun*, *Zhen*, *Dui*, *Qian*, *Xun*, and *Gen*, with *Kan* and *Li* born within. *Zhen* and *Xun* serve as the gates—this is the meaning of *yin* and *yang*’s rise and fall.

**King Wen’s Postcelestial Diagram of the Eight Trigrams**
This method follows the numbers of the *River Diagram* and the principles of the Nine Palaces, fundamentally based on the fifty-five numbers, excluding ten.
For ten is assigned to five, and thus ten is implicitly included.
Ten is the number of completion; things cannot be exhaustively finite, hence it is left empty.
The vertical and horizontal sum of fifteen represents the image of *Kan* and *Li*.

**Eulogy:**
Nine atop, one below, elbows parting three and seven.
Shoulders bearing two and four, knees supporting six and eight.
Five as the belly’s core—this is the *Central Yellow*.
The infant sits upright, governing the eight directions.
Vertical and horizontal sum fifteen—its wonders are immeasurable.

**On the Beginning of Human Conception**
The *Precelestial Empty Qi Metal Womb* is the formless, natural body, the pure and true essence of the One.
Before the parents’ union, this entity shares the same body as the primordial chaos.
As the *Daoist Scripture* states: *"The nameless is the beginning of Heaven and Earth."*
At the moment of the parents’ union, the numinous *qi* suddenly attaches—provisionally called *spirit*.
This *qi*, while still within the mother’s womb, soars and hides without form. When essence and blood congeal, it moves to the Central Palace, becoming the *Elixir Mother*, gathering lead and mercury to form the sagely substance—this is the pivot of the elixir.
This single matter emerges under different names; it is not two things—one must examine this carefully.

**On the Spirit Chamber**
The *Spirit Chamber* is the origin of the elixir, the locus of cultivation.
As the *Scripture of the Dragon and Tiger* states: *"The Spirit Chamber is the pivot of the elixir."*
Within the human body, the viscera and orifices are sealed without the slightest gap, yet the *Spirit Chamber* is empty, a square inch as spacious as a room, capable of containing a person, just as an empty vessel can hold things.
Thus, the *Daoist Scripture* states: *"Cut doors and windows to make a room; it is the emptiness that gives the room its use. Mold clay to make a vessel; it is the emptiness that gives the vessel its use."*
Therefore, all things under Heaven and Earth possess a *Spirit Chamber*.
Heaven and Earth use emptiness as their *Spirit Chamber*; the myriad things use the womb as their *Spirit Chamber*.
For example, when a person enters the womb, without the *Spirit Chamber* to receive it, how could this be possible?
When a person grows old and dies, it is because the spirit has no place to lodge, and decay follows. Without a dwelling, how can life persist?
Thus, in elixir cultivation, recognizing the *Spirit Chamber* is of utmost importance.

The human body takes the *Sea of Marrow* as Heaven and the *Essence Chamber* as Earth, with the ascent and descent of yin and yang *qi* circulating within. The *Spirit Chamber* lies at the center of this Heaven and Earth, above which is the *Yellow Court* and below which is the *Pass of Origin*. The scriptures say: these are the "upper and lower cauldrons." This central space is called the *Spirit Chamber*. In the refinement of *Golden Liquor Returned Elixir*, one first abides in the *Spirit Chamber*—this is one’s original nature, hence called *Lead*.

To abide in the *Spirit Chamber* is to forget. First abiding, then forgetting—this is called stillness. Abiding in one’s original self within the *Spirit Chamber* is called *root*. When external things arise and intent stirs, yin is born; if one is not still, the root is lost. If one seeks to avoid external distractions but remains wholly moved by them, merely fixating on a single thing—responding to whatever arises—this is the method of guarding the spirit. Yet if all sensory threads suddenly cease and all thoughts are forgotten, though things arise one does not respond, this may be called stillness and concentration, but it belongs to yin—nothing more than the withered sitting of Chan monks. These two approaches—one with, one without—are both secondary teachings.

The *Daoist Scripture* states: *"Abide in constant non-desire to observe its mystery; abide in constant desire to observe its manifestations."* The Buddhist scriptures say: *"People are turned by things; if one can turn things, one is equal to the Tathāgata."* This is the function of the *Spirit Chamber*. Some may ask: *"The Tathāgata belongs to the Chan monks—how can it be the same as the function of the Spirit Chamber?"* The answer is: consider Śākyamuni and Bodhidharma, who universally transformed beings—was this not the *Way of Golden Liquor Returned Elixir*? When Bodhidharma spoke of the *"little servant of Linji"* possessing only a single pair of eyes, was this not Linji’s attainment of the *Nature School*?

As previously stated: first abide, then forget; when things arise, respond, and things return to their source. Without self-grasping, one attains constant responsiveness and stillness, unshaken by external allure, standing resolute and luminously complete—this is the body and function of the Great Elixir. When the *Spirit Chamber* is profoundly settled, one gathers the two *qi* as the medicine of the Great Elixir. The timing must be as precise as the clepsydra’s markings, with no deviation in the solar terms.

The *clepsydra* is calibrated to the body, aligning with Heaven and Earth’s time. When spirit is settled and *qi* harmonized, inner and outer correspond; when spirit is dull and *qi* restless, the timing falters. The day has twelve hours, governed by *Ren* and *Gui* in *Gen*, *Jia* and *Yi* in *Xun*, *Bing* and *Ding* in *Kun*, and *Shen* and *Xin* in *Qian*, comprising the twenty-four *qi*—the seasonal markers of a year. Thus, the work of gathering is no small matter.

A day has one hundred *ke*, divided into twelve hours. Within Heaven and Earth, the myriad beings grow and flourish at the initial junctures of *Jia*, *Geng*, *Ren*, and *Bing*—beyond this, the moment passes. The adept of the Dao, at the hours of *Jia* and *Geng*, seizes the numinous *qi* of Heaven and Earth’s generation—this is called *gathering the medicine*. These two hours correspond to the moon’s first and last quarters, the midpoint of yin and yang, like the spring and autumn equinoxes. One measures this by the breath: at *Zi*, the left passage opens; at *Chou*, the right passage opens; the subsequent ten hours follow likewise. Between *Hai* and *Zi*, *Yin* and *Mao*, *Si* and *Wu*, *Shen* and *You*, yin and yang both flow—this is the essence of *Jia*, *Geng*, *Bing*, and *Ren*.

*Zi* and *Wu* are the gates of advance and retreat; *Mao* and *You* are the doors of exit and entry; *Yin* and *Shen* are the signs of rising and falling. The six celestial stems serve the six elixirs. *Yin* is the sign of yang’s arising. To gather the medicine at *Jia*, first sit in stillness at the end of *Yin*, carefully abiding the spirit within the chamber. What is abided is the origin of the single *qi*—the Five Phases and the myriad beings arise from this, called the *Lead in the crucible*, also *Water*, also *Nature*. When *Nature* and *Life* take form, yang *qi* is stored in *Hai*, emerges at *Ren*, is born at *Zi*, and flourishes at *Gui*. At *Zi*, it ascends from the kidneys through the *Cinnabar Field*, *Sea of Qi*, *Yellow Court*, and *Spirit Chamber*—this is the *prior-heaven qi*, the *qi* of Heaven and Earth’s initial separation.

At *Shen*, when the breath flows through both nostrils, employ the method of *arousing yang fire*, closing the *Heavenly Kitchen’s* breath-passage. Spirit and *qi* envelop each other within the chamber—above, it does not leak; below, it does not escape. True *qi* repeatedly steams, gradually revealing the *Heavenly Sign*. (The explanation of the *Heavenly Sign* follows later.) Stop at *Mao*—beyond this, the *post-heaven qi* is unfit for gathering.

Yin *qi* arises at *Wu* within the *Sea of Marrow*, descending from the *Yang Pass* to the *Double Passes*. *Shen* is the sign of yang’s concealment. To gather the medicine at *Geng*, first sit in stillness at the end of *Shen*, just as at *Yin*, abiding and guarding. When the breath flows through both nostrils, it is *Geng*. The *qi* reaches the *Double Passes*; employ the *warm water method* to close the two lower orifices—the place of urination and defecation. The *qi* ascends directly from the *Magpie Bridge* into the *Spirit Chamber*, embracing the spirit—this is the *Dragon and Tiger’s* initial union.

Stop at *You*—if the *qi* passes the *Double Passes*, it becomes *post-heaven qi* and is unfit for gathering. Below, it does not escape; above, it does not leak. Spirit and *qi* unite, the myriad things interpenetrate, the myriad spirits become one spirit, the myriad *qi* become one *qi*. Thus, the scriptures say: *"Observe the Dao of Heaven, grasp the movement of Heaven—this is perfection."* And: *"The deviance of the nine orifices lies in the three essentials."*

The *nine orifices* are the seven upper orifices and the two lower orifices. The *three essentials* are: above, no leakage; below, no escape; and in the center, no movement. The first two have been discussed here; the third—the essential of non-movement—was addressed earlier as *"responding to things and returning them to their source."*

When this is achieved, the *Heavenly Sign* becomes visible, and spirit’s luminosity naturally arrives. When the *Heavenly Sign* arrives, first the body flows smoothly, then it becomes thoroughly permeated. One knows the *qi* is steaming—suddenly, the true spirit transforms and is born. The empty chamber generates brightness, and spirit’s luminosity becomes visible. If one encounters this state, take care not to be startled or doubtful. Simply abide in the *Spirit Chamber*, and it will naturally return.

Thus is called "pursuing the two *qi* along the Yellow Way, gathering the three natures in the Primordial Palace, assembling the Five Phases, harmonizing the Four Images"—only then are the medicinal substances complete. If the time is misaligned, though one may gather them like a farmer, losing the season, how can the treasure be formed?

The *Book of Documents* states: *"Reverently bestow the seasons upon the people."*
*Mencius* says: *"Do not seize their time."* This is the essential point—how could it be neglected?

**Illuminating the Five Phases to Gather the Medicine**

When father and mother’s essence and blood envelop each other, one’s original nature and life unite to form destiny. Thus, the essence and blood of father and mother shape the body—this is *life*; one’s original nature is *innate nature*. Within nature dwells spirit; the body’s generation is *qi*; the congealing of *qi* is *essence*. Essence, *qi*, and spirit—these three nurture the Three Powers to form substance. If one cultivates them well, spirit abides; when spirit abides, *qi* abides; when *qi* abides, essence abides. When all three abide, the form is whole. Should any one decline, all three are lost.

The poem says:
*"Nurture the spirit-root with essence,
Nurture the spirit with *qi*—
Beyond this true truth, no truth remains.
Immortal sages dare not speak plainly,
For to speak plainly would invite mockery."*

The formula states: First, preserve the precelestial True One’s primordial spirit within the chamber as *wu* earth—this is *yang* earth, namely *nature*. The transformation of true lead follows; next, circulate the wondrous function, the *qi* of arising, entering the chamber as *ji* earth—this is *yin* earth, also called the Yellow Dame, namely *emotion*. The transformation of cinnabar and mercury arises from the mutual generation of *yin* and *yang*, their mutual resonance forming *emotion*.

The primordial *qi* is stored in the *Kun* Palace, whence it arises—then the Metal Womb follows in its wake, also transforming and ascending. The *Kun* Palace is also called the chamber of lead essence. The classic states: *"Metal and fire—metal is the Metal Womb; fire is the arising *yang qi*—this is true lead."* In alchemical arts, nothing is more vital than metal and fire. Thus, this *qi* propels transformation and returns to the Central Palace—this is called *cinnabar*. As wood, the *yang qi* reaches the Sea of Marrow; when it reaches its limit, *yin* is born—this is called *"drawing mercury from cinnabar"* as fire.

The classic says: *"Transformation into cinnabar and mercury."* Cinnabar and mercury are the two functions of metal and water, for cinnabar and mercury are *yin* and *yang*. At the *jia* hour, the three *yang* govern—*qi* ascends as cinnabar, called *"half a catty of metal."* At the *geng* hour, the three *yin* govern—*qi* descends as mercury, called *"half a catty of water."* Combining the two eights, they transform within the chamber to form the Great Elixir. Thus, cinnabar and mercury unite as one body, merging with lead to become silver—this is the completion of the Five Phases. This is called *"the root of the one *qi*,"* also named *"primordial *qi*."* Though metal and water share the same origin, *kan* flows into *wu*; though wood and fire share the same origin, they settle in *ji*.

Master Zhang said:
*"If *li* and *kan* lacked *wu* and *ji*,
Though they contain the Four Images, the elixir would not form.
Only because each holds true earth,
Can the golden elixir return and revert."*

One who grasps this principle is called *"the seed of the medicine."*

**Diagram of the Fifty-Five Numbers of Heaven and Earth**
Heaven one, Earth two; Heaven three, Earth four; Heaven five, Earth six; Heaven seven, Earth eight; Heaven nine, Earth ten. All the numbers of Heaven and Earth total fifty-five.

**Diagram of Generative and Completion Numbers**
This clarifies the natural numbers of Heaven one and Earth two: water, fire, wood, metal, earth—two, five, seven, nine—these are the odd generative numbers. Two, four, six, eight, ten—these are the even completion numbers. With Earth six residing in the north, it accumulates the *kan* *yin*’s upright *qi* as lead; with Heaven seven returning south to dwell in the *li* Palace as mercury; with Earth eight residing in the east at the *zhen* Palace as cinnabar; with Heaven nine returning west to the *dui* direction as metal; with Earth ten completing the Central Palace, it becomes the wondrous work of the myriad things’ generation—and thus the elixir.

**Numbers of Creation and Completion**
Are the ten positions the full count of ten thousand? The Eight Trigrams arise from this. Three, five, seven, nine—Heaven’s numbers total twenty-five. Two, four, six, eight, ten—Earth’s numbers total thirty. Together, they total fifty-five. The number of the Great Expansion is fifty; removing five leaves the root of the Five Phases. Its use is forty-nine; removing one more symbolizes the unmoving Great Ultimate.

**Diagram of Creation and Reduction**
Above, first remove one, two, three, four, five—these are water, fire, wood, metal, earth. Again remove one, two, three, four, five—these are removed as the root of the Five Phases. The remaining five fives, twenty-five, are the root of the Five Phases—true earth appears. These twenty-five symbolize the odd *yang* numbers of one, three, five, seven, nine. Only when *wu* earth is seen, then take the root number five, thirty-five, and again remove one, two, three, four, five—only then is the body and function of the returning elixir revealed.

**Discourse on the Principles of *Qi* and Number in the Nature of Things**
The omen of *qi* is the beginning of number; all things arise from it. The classic states: *"The Dao gives birth to one"*—this is the origin of primordial *qi*. The circle’s potential becomes *qi*; extended, it becomes number. Circle and extension—though their forms differ, their principle is one, fundamentally not two things. This is called *"same origin, different names."*

In all numbers, one is within them; in all things, *qi* is within them. Thus, one and one make two; one and two make three; one and three make four; one and four make five—these five are the generation of number. One and five make six; one and six make seven; one and seven make eight; one and eight make nine; one and nine make ten—these five are the completion of number.

*Qi* divides into *yin* and *yang*; numbers have odd and even. From *yin* and *yang*, odd and even, the myriad things are born. Thus it is said: Heaven one, Earth two; Heaven three, Earth four; Heaven five, Earth six; Heaven seven, Earth eight; Heaven nine, Earth ten. From one to five is the root of the myriad things—this root generates without end.

From six to ten lies the root of the myriad things. This root is the return to restore life’s mandate. Thus, generation and completion interact, root and origin mutually engender. Therefore:

Heaven One multiplied by Earth Six,
Earth Two multiplied by Heaven Seven,
Heaven Three multiplied by Earth Eight,
Earth Four multiplied by Heaven Nine,
Heaven Five multiplied by Earth Ten—

Summing these yields fifty-five. Heaven’s numbers attain twenty-five to generate; Earth’s numbers attain thirty to complete. Extended and unfolded, they are without end—this is the principle of ceaseless generation.

Returning to the Dao of restoring life’s root:
Heaven One is Water,
Earth Two is Fire,
Heaven Three is Wood,
Earth Four is Metal,
Heaven Five is Earth—
these are the Five Phases. From emptiness they transform into spirit and give rise to form, and generation knows no end. Yet as they contend and overcome, the later phase completes while the former transforms.

Earth Six is Lead,
Heaven Seven is Mercury,
Earth Eight is Cinnabar,
Heaven Nine is Gold,
Earth Ten is the Elixir—
these are the Five Substances. From form they return to emptiness and revert to the origin, restoring life’s root. Thus, though form changes and shifts, nature remains unaltered.

Therefore, Lead is the mother of the Five Metals, the ancestral number of *qi*, the origin of all reckoning. Some ask: If Lead is the mother of the Five Metals, the ancestral number of *qi*, and the origin of all reckoning, why is it said that “Heaven One generates Water” rather than “Heaven One is Earth and Lead”? The answer: What generates Heaven One before it? Moreover, humans take form through spirit; once form is established, spirit resides within. As the kernel’s essence exists because of the seed’s core, once the core is established, the essence resides within the fruit. All things are thus—what doubt can there be?

Lead’s *qi* becomes Mercury; Mercury congeals into Cinnabar; Cinnabar transforms into Treasure; Treasure congeals into the Elixir. The Elixir is the myriad things’ return to their original nature, the reversion to the source. Thus it is said: When Metal returns to its original nature, it is first called the Returned Elixir. Moreover, *qi* flows as Mercury; Mercury congeals into Cinnabar; Cinnabar transforms into Treasure; Treasure becomes the Elixir. From things, principles and numbers may be known; between principles and numbers, the spirit may be known.

Heaven One and Earth Six are Lead—Lead is nature. Heaven One following Earth Six to become Mercury is like nature concealed within things becoming emotion. Lead is nature; Mercury is emotion—this is the principle. Seven is the origin of numbers, with Six residing within. Thus Mercury transforms into Lead and is born. This is the number.

Earth Two following Heaven Seven to become Cinnabar clarifies that Cinnabar forms from Mercury—just as emotion arises from nature. Subtracting one from eight leaves seven; is this not Mercury?

Heaven Nine following Earth Eight is called Gold, clarifying that Treasure transforms from Cinnabar. This is the principle of emotion returning to nature. Subtracting one from nine leaves eight—is this not Cinnabar?

Earth Ten is called the Elixir: the return to the origin, the reversion to the root. This is Metal coming to restore its original nature, first called the Returned Elixir. Subtracting one from ten leaves nine—what is this if not Gold? Thus it is said: In all numbers, one is within them; in all things, *qi* is within them.

Since *qi* and numbers are like this in things, their principles may be known. Just as silver exists within Lead, so the true spirit exists within nature. Lead gives rise to silver through the silver’s seed, and the nature within Lead returns the silver. Likewise, the true spirit arises from the numinous *qi* and returns to reside within nature—just as one is within numbers and *qi* is within things. This is what is meant by “the mother conceals the child in her womb; the child is born from the mother’s belly.” From this, the generation of *yin* and *yang* may be seen, as well as the principle and method of Metal and Lead’s return.

Daily, at the proper time, store the spirit in the chamber—this is called True Lead. With wondrous efficacy, the arising *qi* compels and transforms to become the medicinal substance—this is Cinnabar and Mercury, which are emotion.

The scripture says: Refine silver from Lead, and the numinous substance arises spontaneously. Silver is the golden radiance of Lead’s color; the Northern Numinous Water is the pivot of the Dao. This is the beginning of *yin* and *yang*—the root of the Elixir.

Master Zhang the Perfected says:
*"Within black there is white—this is the Elixir’s mother;
The male embraces the female—this is the sacred embryo."*
He also says:
*"The golden crucible desires to retain Mercury within the vermilion;
The jade pool first receives the silver within the water."*
And:
*"Swallowing saliva and absorbing *qi*—this is human practice;
Only with the medicine can transformation and generation occur.
If the furnace lacks the true seed,
It is like fierce fire boiling an empty cauldron."*

Thus it is said:
*"Know the white, guard the black;
Know the male, guard the female."*
This speaks of the Great Elixir’s medicinal substance and its essence.

Mercury within Cinnabar is *yang* within *yin*—called Mercury Fluid, or *yang* Cinnabar and *yin* Mercury. Thus the scripture says:
*"Departing from *kan* below, it arises;
Mercury dwells within the water."*

Now, Cinnabar is Mercury—it is the arising *qi*. From the *zi* hour, it ascends in the *kun* palace. The *Scripture of Dragon and Tiger* says:
*"Exhausting the subtle to the utmost transformation,
When *yang* moves, *yin* dissolves."*
It also says:
*"When the golden radiance transforms once,
The Azure Dragon receives the tally."*

At the *shen* hour, it arrives at the spirit chamber. Pursuing it with the method to enter the chamber, the scripture says:
*"At this time,
Refine the essence in the spirit chamber;
Metal and fire mutually revolve and push."*

*Qi* responds to Lead to become Cinnabar—called the Union of Dragon and Tiger, or Half a Catty of Gold, or Refining Lead so that the *yang* Dragon ascends. Thus the scripture says:
*"When *yin* and *yang* mix and join,
Essence and fluid envelop the original *qi*;
The myriad images rely on emptiness to arise,
And transformations each have their kind."*

The Elixir’s numinous traces and longevity all arise from this. Master Zhang the Perfected says:
*"When sweet dew descends, Heaven and Earth unite;
Where the Five Phases are complete, *kan* and *li* intersect—*
this is it."

At the *si* hour, it arrives at the *qian* palace—the *Scripture of Dragon and Tiger* calls this *"The completion of the yang pattern at *si*."* When *yang* reaches its extreme, *yin* is born—this is called Drawing Mercury from Cinnabar. Mercury is Water, also called the Maiden, or Flowing Pearl. It is the wondrous efficacy of the arising *qi*—when *yang* reaches its extreme at *wu*, *yin* is born.

Thus it is said: Mercury resides within the Sea of Marrow. The *Scripture of Dragon and Tiger* states: *"True yin arises at *li* noon,"* and also: *"Crimson waters flow as mercury."* The Maiden plays her cauldron; as the moon waxes, it must wane—this is the turning at sixteen, when its light begins to diminish. At the *geng* hour, by method it is drawn into the chamber—this is called *"Mercury casting itself into lead,"* symbolizing the union, also named *"Half-catty of Water,"* or *"The Completed Treasure,"* or *"White Gold and Silver."* The crystal is the descending yin tiger, also called *"Yin returning to the yang chamber,"* or *"The two whites converging at the Mysterious Pass."* Thus the scripture says:

*"The Primordial Lord first refines mercury,
The divine chamber holds emptiness profound.
Mysterious white gives birth to Metal Elder,
Majestic, at the founding’s first dawn.
Crowned with the Three and Five in mutual guard,
Flying crystals bring moistening nourishment."*

This is what Master Zhang the Perfected means when he says:
*"If you would have true lead retain mercury,
Kin must not leave the household’s embrace.
Wood and metal, though sundered by fate,
Require the Yellow Dame’s matchmaking grace.
Wood’s nature loves metal’s righteousness,
Metal’s heart yearns for wood’s kindness.
Devouring each other, they wed in bliss—
Only then does the Primordial conceive its child."*

He also says:
*"Whose is the Maiden of sixteen?
Where dwells the Lad of nine and three?
They call themselves Wood’s fluid, Metal’s essence—
Yet meeting Earth, the Three Natures agree."*

And again:
*"The maiden dons azure robes,
The lad wraps himself in white silk.
Seen, they cannot be used;
Used, they cannot be seen.
In the dim and distant, they meet,
In the obscure and profound, they transform.
In a flash, flames take flight—
The Perfected One appears of its own."*

This clarifies the workings of natural principle: the ascent and descent of yin and yang. Some mistakenly take lead and mercury as yin and yang—this is incorrect. They may be called *"yang lead,"* but lead itself cannot be yang. If lead and mercury were yin and yang, this would be mere manipulation of essence and spirit, not the Way of Returning and Reversion. Master Zhang says: *"Lead and mercury are not the two qi; contemplation is not the midnight and noon. How then can lead and mercury be yin and yang?"* For lead is nature, and within nature lies spirit—just as within lead lies silver. To extract silver from lead, fire and smelting are required. If lead and mercury were yin and yang, could they refine themselves? It is clear that the two qi are cinnabar and mercury. Thus the scripture says: *"Cinnabar and mercury dwell apart, emerging from yang and entering yin, their radiance flowing to two directions, their numbers arrayed in three—following the images of water and fire."*

These two substances both transform from a single qi. Mercury, stirred by lead, congeals into cinnabar; from cinnabar, mercury is drawn—mother and child begetting each other, the principle of natural pattern made manifest. Thus there is the Way of Returning and Reversion, the principle of ascent and descent. When yang reaches its extreme, yin is born; when yin reaches its extreme, yang is born. Yin and yang are dragon and tiger; dragon and tiger are sun and moon; sun and moon are hun and po; hun and po are wood and metal; wood and metal are water and fire; water and fire are *kan* and *li*; *kan* and *li* are male and female; male and female are husband and wife—this is the mechanism of transformation. Master Zhang says: *"One must thoroughly understand yin and yang, deeply penetrate the workings of creation—this is what it means."*

The dragon is yang, signifying the moment of yang’s ascent. The tiger is yin, clarifying the token of yin’s descent. The sun symbolizes the ascent and descent of yin and yang—yang contains yin, like true mercury within cinnabar. Yang cannot illuminate its hun without yin, hence it is called *"feminine fire,"* belonging to the southern direction. The moon, the *li* maiden, symbolizes the waxing and waning of human vitality. Yin contains yang, like true silver within lead. Yin cannot polish its po without yang, hence it is called *"masculine metal,"* belonging to the northern direction, the *kan* lad. The Four Images are: the Azure Dragon (wood, cinnabar), the White Tiger (metal, silver), the Vermilion Bird (fire, mercury), and the Dark Warrior (water, lead). The Five Phases are: Metal Mother as *wu* earth, yin and yang mutually engendering, stirred by affection. *Ji* earth, together with the Four Images, forms the Five Phases. Dragon and tiger are the transformative mechanism of wood and metal. Wood, as a thing, desires to ascend but cannot—thus it is entrusted to the dragon. Metal, as a thing, desires to descend but cannot—thus it is entrusted to the tiger. Wood and metal are the mutual dependence of water and fire. Wood, when drilled, yields fire; when soaked, yields water. Metal, when struck, yields fire; when smelted, yields water. Water and fire are the mutual employment of *kan* and *li*. *Kan* contains a yang line, *li* contains a yin line. *Kan* and *li* are the ascent and descent of yin and yang. Yang’s ability to ascend is *kan* flowing to *wu*; yin’s ability to descend is *li* settling into *ji*. In daily use, they are governed by *kan* and *li*. The sun contains a crow, symbolizing yang within yin; the moon contains a hare, symbolizing yin within yang. The essence of yin and yang: the sun’s light governs day, thus *li* and *ji*; the moon’s brightness governs night, thus *kan* and *wu*. All the above are principles of mutual dependence, mutual completion, and the interchange of ascent and descent. Within *kan* and *li*, the two qi are not constant—thus lead, silver, cinnabar, and mercury each beget one another. Hence it is said: *"The inversion of *kan* and *li* is the root of water and fire."* Thus yin and yang have ascent and descent, sun and moon have conjunction, water and fire have mutual dependence, wood and metal have their transformative mechanism.

Master Taiyi the Perfected says: *"The Five Phases’ inverted technique—
The dragon emerges from within fire.
Mercury’s Five Phases do not proceed in order;
The tiger gives birth to lead within water."*

Master Zhang says: *"The male tiger is yang within yin; the female dragon is yin within yang."* As for the *Golden Fluid Returned Elixir’s* alternate names, students all say *"yang lead and yin mercury."* But if lead and mercury are likened to yin and yang, the principle of mother and child begetting each other is not seen. Moreover, lead is yang within yin; mercury is yin within yang. Lead is yang lead formed by the qi of silver. Silver is yin metal—like the radiant spark of emptiness before father and mother were born, without form yet possessing qi. Though it has endured kalpas, countless eons to this day, it has never been severed.

When a person dies, they become entirely yin, and when the hun-soul is exhausted, they are but a yin po-soul. Ghosts manifest through objects; without objects, no ghost takes form. Upon entering the womb and following the father’s essence and mother’s blood, stirred by resonance, essence arises—thus before birth, one is yin metal. The nature after birth is yang lead.

Yin metal is called the Metal Mother, also the Metal Consort, or the Metal Earth, the numinous root. Mercury arises from lead’s production, possessing lead’s yang. Mercury is yin, its nature rooted in the kidneys. When yang essence ascends with qi, yang reaches its extreme and yin is born—mercury is drawn from cinnabar, hence called yin mercury. Thus mercury is yang within yin.

If lead and mercury are taken as yin and yang, this is not the *Golden Fluid Returned Elixir* but mere manipulation of essence and soul. Only cinnabar and mercury are yin and yang—yin and yang as dragon and tiger, dragon and tiger as sun and moon, sun and moon as hun and po, hun and po as wood and metal. Mercury is metal, the return of yang, water and fire, the mechanism of transformation. Wood and metal are male and female, male and female are husband and wife—only then can the principle of mutual generation be discerned.

Lead and silver, though called yang lead and yin silver, exemplify the mutual generation of inner and outer yin and yang. Silver-lead is metal-lead, which is metal-water. Without the discourse on cinnabar-mercury as wood-metal, the completeness of metal-water would not be evident, nor would the distinction between prior and posterior Heaven.

Lead forms through qi; refining lead within yields silver. Metal is born from water; within water, metal is reborn. Nature arises from the qi of emptiness and the void; within nature, the void’s true person is transformed—thus the child gives birth to the mother. Cinnabar and mercury: cinnabar forms through mercury, mercury is drawn from cinnabar. Fire is born from wood; within wood, fire is born. Yin gives birth to yang; yang at its extreme gives birth to yin—like the child giving birth to the mother.

The mutual generation of lead and silver is called the Five Phases. Their inversion is the tiger born from water; Kan water is metal-lead. The mutual generation of cinnabar and mercury is the inverted technique of the Five Phases—the dragon emerging from within fire. Wood generates fire; metal generates water. Water and fire are the transformative mechanism of Kan and Li, now made clear.

The moon symbolizes the waxing and waning of human essence and spirit; the sun symbolizes the ascent and descent of human yin and yang. Together they harmonize constructive and defensive qi, cold and warmth—Kan’s *wu* earth and the moon’s essence, Li’s *ji* earth and the sun’s light. The use of the Returned Elixir lies solely in Kan’s *wu* flowing to Li’s *ji*.

Lead is the Metal Duke, *wu* earth. Mercury is the Alchemical Maiden; the Yellow Dame is emotion, *ji* earth. The Fire Duke is fire; the Infant is the yang spirit.

Master Zhang’s poem says:
*Take the solid from Kan’s position within the heart,*
*Refine the yin within Li’s palace in the abdomen.*
*From this, transform into the strength of Qian’s body—*
*Hidden or soaring, all is governed by the mind.*

**Explanation of the Wuji Diagram**
At the proper time, store the spirit within the chamber—this is called gathering true lead, the prior-Heaven qi. Transformed, it becomes cinnabar; when cinnabar reaches Li’s palace, it becomes mercury. Mercury returns to the chamber and becomes silver—this is called returning to the root and reviving the mandate, embracing yin and holding yang. True yang is concealed within the yin chamber, the foundation of the prior-Heaven void-qi’s metal embryo. Its wondrous function operates daily, ever as before.

Thus the *Dragon-Tiger Classic* says:
*Yang qi issues from Kun; the sun’s shadow reaches the southern pole.*
*The five stars align in a string; sun and moon conjoin as jade disks.*
*Metal and cinnabar follow their allotted parts; breath and response harmonize.*
*The flowery canopy descends above; the Three Terraces support below.*

It also says:
*The two nones unite in the One—its divine radiance is wondrous and hard to glimpse.*
*Refining silver from lead, numinous things arise spontaneously.*
*Silver is metal’s essence, lead’s color; the Northern Numen is water, the pivot of the Dao.*
*Its number is the beginning of yin and yang—thus it can generate silver-lead and transform yellow elixir.*
*Lodged among the five metals as lead, its exterior is black, its nature transformed within to embrace silver’s essence.*
*Clothed in coarse garb yet holding jade, outwardly a madman—*
*Silver is lead’s child; the child hides within lead.*
*Lead is silver’s mother; the child dwells in the mother’s womb.*
*Subtle and distant, seemingly present yet absent—*
*In the ash pool, fire scorches: lead sinks, silver floats.*
*Pure and white, its reality revealed, it can be wrought into a golden shell—*
*Metal’s essence, water returning as yellow fluid.*
*A substance the width of a thumb unites the Three Powers.*

Its principle: silver is born within lead; mercury forms through lead. Mercury is drawn from cinnabar; mercury reverts to silver. When silver becomes lead entirely, it is called the Returned Elixir—the Dao of one qi returning to the origin.

An ancient classic says:
*Use lead yet not use lead—*
*You must work within lead.*
*When it comes to using lead,*
*Using lead is still a mistake.*

Thus the method says: *Drawing and adding* refers to drawing lead and adding mercury. *Drawing lead* means refining away yin qi; *adding mercury* means gathering yin to return to yang. When yin mercury is stripped away and returns to yang, it becomes pure yang.

The essentials of elixir refinement: embody the rise and fall of yin and yang, the principles of things and their transformations. Exert effort without wasting time; settle the spirit in stillness, free from stray thoughts. Guard the feminine and embrace the One; concentrate qi to attain softness. When the medicine is complete, you may enter the chamber—do not be entangled by fame or profit. Days and months pass swiftly; if moved by external things, the mind’s realm wavers and cannot be gathered. If intention stirs in response to things, spirit is lost and qi dissipated—efforts will be in vain. Be deeply cautious; do not hasten to ruin. Heed this warning—how can it be neglected?

**Diagram of Original Qi’s Beginning and End, Yin and Yang’s Ascent and Descent**
**Method for Nurturing the Red Child, Direct Pointers to the Golden Fluid Returned Elixir**

The prior-Heaven One is called the void-qi’s metal embryo—this is spirit. This spirit belongs to yang. In terms of symbolic correspondence, above it is metal; in human terms, it is silver ore. An indestructible thing from kalpas past, it is one’s original face—this is nature.

This nature belongs to yin; in terms of symbolic correspondence, it is called lead. This lead is born within silver ore, returning to enfold the silver—just as nature originally contains spirit, and true spirit in turn is concealed within nature. These two things mutually require each other to generate my form.

As the saying goes: *"All action and stillness arise from this."* Lodged between the two kidneys, it is my root and foundation, named the *Medicinal Ancestor* and *Elixir Base*. The wondrously transforming qi of daily use emerges from here. This qi arises at the *zi* hour, called *yang fire*, and my root and foundation ascend with the qi—like a cart bearing goods, where the cart moves and the goods follow.

If this arising qi is guided by mechanism into the Central Palace, it will daily grow stronger and not decline into exhaustion. If left to its own devices, it will dissipate with daily use, leading to old age and death.

**Verse:**
The numinous terrace, bright and pure as an ice-jade flask,
Only permits the original spirit to dwell within.
Should anything linger here,
A lifetime remains impure and unrefined.

**Method for the Mind’s Conscious Spirit:**
Within it lies a space of an inch’s diameter—void and thus called the *Spirit Chamber*, the still heart of Chan adepts. Three-tenths and one part further is the *Crimson Palace* and *Yellow Court*. Exhale from the root, inhale at the stem; root and stem connected—this is the Way of enduring vision and long life. Yet it is not breath that is the true essential, but the cessation of breath that is the true essential. Seal the *Heavenly Kitchen* with a single exhalation—
Two streams of essence-qi pierce the *Peng Hu* vessel.
Naturally, dragon and tiger frequently unite;
Entrusted to the man of true greatness.

**Essentials of Fire Timing**

The firing process begins at the *jiazi* hour, which corresponds to the month of the Winter Solstice. Thus, the firing sequence follows the cyclical shifts of the twelve hours and twenty-four *qi*, forming a distinct heaven and earth within the crucible. For instance, when the fire is initiated at the *zi* hour of the Winter Solstice, it aligns with the first stirrings of yang—where a single yang line emerges beneath *kun*, forming the *zhen* trigram, symbolizing thunder beneath the earth, and giving rise to the *fu* hexagram. The fire’s origin is thus made clear.

At the *chou* hour, a second yang line appears beneath *kun*, forming the *dui* trigram, the *lin* hexagram of earth over marsh. By the *yin* hour, three yang lines gather beneath *kun*, completing the *tai* hexagram, where yang fire reaches the *kun* chamber, and yang *qi* clusters upon the earth, stirring the myriad things to life. Thus, *yin* marks the omen of yang’s ascent, the *tai* hexagram of earth over heaven, akin to the season of spring.

**Oral Formula:**
Begin the fire at *ren*, lifting it for two hours. The spirit congeals, breath stills, and *qi* neither enters nor exits. From the end of *yin* to *jia*, the metal-fire compels the *qi* toward the *Spirit Chamber*, where the elixir gradually coalesces.

At the *mao* hour, four yang lines form the *dazhuang* hexagram of thunder over heaven.
**Oral Formula:**
At *mao*, do not advance the fire; at *you*, do not circulate the talisman. *Mao* and *you* are the baths, the points of ingress and egress—where the golden sand drifts in leisure. The eldest son inherits the father’s body, and the fire’s function becomes manifest.

At the *chen* hour, five yang lines form the *guai* hexagram of marsh over heaven, where the fire ascends to the heavens. By the *si* hour, six yang lines solidify, completing the pure *qian* trigram. Thus, the *Cantong Qi* states: *"The eldest son inherits the father’s body, by the mother the foundation is laid."* This is *kun* giving rise to *zhen*, *dui*, and *qian*.

**Oral Formula:**
From the start of *chen*, resume advancing the fire until the end of *si*, where the metal-fire drives the *qi* into the *Sea of Marrow*. When the yang fire reaches its peak, the talisman is circulated—this is the moment of *"warm water."* The yang now full, the yin talisman moves the true mercury, gradually taking form as the elixir’s substance.

At the *wu* hour, a single yin line emerges beneath *qian*, forming the *xun* trigram, the *gou* hexagram of heaven over wind. By the *wei* hour, two yin lines form *gen*, the *dun* hexagram of heaven over mountain. At the *shen* hour, three yin lines complete the *pi* hexagram, where yang *qi* gradually recedes, true mercury solidifies, and yin mercury descends. The *Spirit Chamber* fills with the myriad things, like the season of autumn.

**Oral Formula:**
From *bing*, circulate the talisman for three hours. The spirit congeals, breath stills, and *qi* neither enters nor exits. From *wu* through *wei* to the end of *shen*, at *geng*, the metal-water shifts, propelled through the *Double Pass* and *Magpie Bridge* straight into the *Spirit Chamber*, where the *Mysterious Pearl* gradually takes shape. At *you*, do not circulate the talisman—*mao* and *you* are the baths, where the golden sand drifts in leisure.

At the *xu* hour, five yin lines form the *bo* hexagram, where yin *qi* pares away yang *qi*, driving it back to the root—this is the *bo* hexagram of mountain over earth. By the *hai* hour, six yin lines complete the pure *kun* trigram, returning to the root and restoring life, reverting to the origin. Yin embraces yang, and yang is reborn here. **Oral Formula:**
From the start of *xu*, resume circulating the talisman until the end of *hai*, returning to *yuan* at *ren*, where the first yang revives. The cycle repeats without end, and after ten months, the embryo is perfected.

One must meticulously regulate and sincerely apply this process. Should the slightest deviation occur, regret and loss will follow. This is *qian* giving rise to *xun*, *gen*, and *kun*—the six voids generating *kan* and *li*, where the central *qi* forms water and fire. The mechanism of yin talismans and yang fire is thus complete. The firing process, with its rises and falls, advances and retreats, is illustrated in this schema. The subtlety lies in aligning with the breath of heaven and earth.

Yang fire and yin talismans must not be disturbed, lest the *Red Dragon* descend in *qi* and the *White Mercury* take form. The primordial elixir’s foundation is laid, the embryo transformed, and one ascends as an immortal. If the timing is off by even a fraction, or the fire’s measure excessive, the water’s weight unsteady, the cinnabar and mercury will separate, the *Red Dragon* flee, and the *Alchemical Maiden* escape.

Master Zhang said: *"Even if one knows cinnabar and black lead, without the firing sequence, it is like a blind man in a great city—entirely dependent on guidance. A hair’s breadth of error prevents the elixir’s formation. How can one not be cautious?"*

Fire is the spirit congealed, breath stilled—no inhalation, no exhalation. The six pulses return to the root, the three palaces fill with *qi*: above, the *Sea of Marrow*; at the center, the *Spirit Chamber*; below, the *Cinnabar Field*. Thus, the sun and moon pause in their course, the *Xuanji* ceases its turning, day and night become one, pure and unadulterated, forming the realm of true yang. Only then does the returning elixir begin to coalesce. If the sealing is not tight, the golden *qi* scatters, and the elixir’s creation becomes impossible—this is the most secret of teachings.

**Entering the Chamber Diagram:**
Enter the chamber before the Winter Solstice. For fifteen days, gather and secure the *Spiritual Root*; for another fifteen, guard the spirit within the two kidneys. At the *zi* hour of the Winter Solstice night, advance the fire to correspond with the first year. The spirit, stored in the kidneys, moves with the yang fire, following its progression—this is the true metal-fire.

This is called *"metal and fire mutually propelling,"* the root within the kidneys. From root to stem, the *Spirit Chamber* is the stem, where the embryo forms and the fruit ripens. Root and stem must connect, hence: *"Exhale from the root, inhale at the stem."* When the seasonal cycle is complete, the Great Elixir is achieved.

On the Winter Solstice night, advance the yang fire at the transition from *hai* to *zi*, beginning at *ren*. **Oral Formula:**
Lift the fire for three hours, breath utterly still, with no ingress or egress. From *zi* through *chou* to the end of *yin*, at *jia*, the metal-fire compels the *qi* toward the *Spirit Chamber*, where the elixir gradually coalesces. At *mao*, do not advance the fire—*mao* and *you* are the baths, where the golden sand drifts in leisure. At *chen*, resume advancing the fire. **Oral Formula:**
By the end of *si*, the metal-fire drives the *qi* into the *Sea of Marrow*. When the yang fire reaches its peak, circulate the yin talisman—this is *"warm water."* **Oral Formula:**
From *bing*, circulate the talisman for three hours, breath utterly still, with no ingress or egress. From *wu* through *wei* to the end of *shen*, at *geng*, the metal-water shifts, propelled through the *Double Pass* and *Magpie Bridge* straight into the *Spirit Chamber*, where the *Mysterious Pearl* gradually takes shape. At *you*, do not circulate the talisman—*mao* and *you* are the baths, where the golden sand drifts in leisure. At *xu*, resume circulating the talisman. **Oral Formula:**
By the end of *hai*, return to *yuan* at *ren*, where the first yang revives at the root-source, the origin from which the spirit is born.

Thus, consume one grain of millet-sized *Great Unity* each day, and in one year’s effort, the *Returned Cinnabar* is achieved. This begins with a full year—three hundred and sixty days, four thousand three hundred and twenty hours—from which the two hours of *mao* and *you* are deducted, when metal-water bathes and no yang fire is advanced, no yin talisman circulated, and the breath flows in and out. Excluding these two hours, two months—sixty hours—are subtracted, leaving three hundred days, or ten months, to receive the fire-talisman and refine the *xu*-metal into *Liquid Cinnabar*.

Once the *Spirit Embryo* is transformed and the *Sacred Fetus* perfected, further cultivation continues within the chamber. At most a hundred days, at least sixty, and the *Sacred Fetus* may emerge. Without this oral formula, stepping outside prematurely would expose it to the raw wind, hardening the crown bone and making emergence arduous. **Oral Formula:**
Carefully nurture the *Sacred Fetus* within the *Sea of Marrow*, guarding it as on ordinary days. Suddenly, like a thunderclap, the *Celestial Gate* opens, and the *Sacred Fetus* emerges—two identical, indistinguishable forms. Do not indulge in recklessness; gradually regulate and employ it, moving in and out freely, without obstruction. It pierces metal and stone, roams the Three Realms, transforms across the Ten Directions, and its comings and goings rest with me.

**Oral Formula:**
When seated cross-legged, rise slightly, lower the eyelids to seal the senses, concentrate the spirit, and settle the breath. Draw downward and inhale upward, merging the two *qi*, steaming the Four Great. Ascend the Twelve-Story Tower; true fluid fills the mouth. Send it down with *qi*, intent returning to the *Original Palace*. Afterward, draw and inhale, slightly parting the senses, then repeat as before, continuing until effort is required, then cease.

At midday, sit upon a swept couch with windows closed; after nightfall, lower the lids and sleep with eyes open. Gently roll up...

Silently raise the six outer orifices of *Kun*, together with the nine orifices—three outer orifices of *Qian* below. When the passes remain unopened, one must return to the root; the bellows and key deploy their wondrous function, the mechanism’s seal most subtle, not to be lightly disclosed. The immortals say: "Eighty-four thousand barred gates—all opened by a single key." The esoteric formula of embracing the One and enfolding the Three is complete.
