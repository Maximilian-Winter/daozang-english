**Cultivating Life: Secret Records**
*Recorded Sayings of Master Yuxi’s Alchemical Chamber*

When the mind congeals, it becomes spirit; congealing spirit and returning it to qi refines the elixir.
When emotions return to nature, returning nature to the root nurtures life.
The foundation of the returned elixir lies solely in lead and mercury.

Primordial essence is the root of life—cherish primordial essence, and true lead arises of itself.
Primordial spirit is the origin of nature—conserve primordial essence, and true mercury is born of itself.
Thus, one preserves essence to nurture qi, and preserves qi to nurture spirit.

Lead and mercury meet at the appointed time, and with breath held in unbroken continuity, the fire-phase is achieved.
True qi gathers without cease, and with thoughts forgotten over time, the golden elixir is formed.
If true lead flees and true mercury withers, primordial spirit scatters and primordial essence is exhausted—how then can one seek the return? Truly, it is difficult!

This must not be lightly transmitted except to those of steadfast resolve. Guard it well! Keep it secret!

**Oral Instructions**

The interplay of external yin and yang is the outer medicine; the convergence of internal Kan and Li is the inner joy.
Externally, there is effort; internally, it is spontaneous. The use of essence, qi, and spirit is twofold, yet their essence is one.

Regarding the outer medicine:
The essence of union must first be undiminished; the qi of breath must be ever finer, until it reaches the state of no-breath.
The spirit of thought must be prized for its tranquility.

Regarding the inner medicine:
Refining essence refines primordial essence—drawing forth the primordial yang within Kan.
When primordial essence is firm, the essence of union naturally does not leak.
Refining qi refines primordial qi—supplementing the primordial yin within Li.
When primordial qi abides, the qi of breath naturally ceases its egress and ingress.
Refining spirit refines primordial spirit—Kan and Li unite as one body, becoming Qian.
When primordial spirit congeals, the spirit of thought attains profound stability.

Above these, there is yet the refinement of emptiness—this is not easily spoken of lightly. It is prized in silent comprehension and heartfelt realization.

Strive on! Press forward!

The *Xinyue Heart Secrets of Master Yuxu*

Three thousand six hundred methods nurture life for thousands of households—most are but side doors and minor arts, nothing more than winding paths. I, having studied and practiced the *Cantong Qi* for merely thirty years, composed the *Twelve-Character Secret of the Regulating Center Diagram* to transmit to those gentlemen who cultivate the Dao.

Take rectifying the mind and sincerity of intent as the central pillar, abiding in the center to govern the external. Take the eight characters—*harmonious ease, centered harmony, restrained stillness, solemn reverence*—as auxiliaries, regulating and mastering the four seasons, responding to the internal from the external. Above, it accords with the celestial mind; in the middle, it examines human affairs; silently, it aligns with creation, follows the course of yin and yang, externally models the five phases, and internally orders the five viscera. Thus, the sun and moon circulate without end. Without exertion, without contemplation, one rests in great stability, thereby grasping the primordial mechanism.

Simply sever desires, settle the mind and qi, reduce thoughts, moderate diet, regulate the breath, guard against drowsiness, restrain sight and hearing, and nurture celestial harmony within the four dignities and the four faculties—naturally, the wondrous workings arise without complexity or difficulty.

For those who have already established the *yine* and *e* (the inner and outer elixir fields), this serves to harmonize with the fire and nurture the sacred embryo. For those who have not yet established the *yine* and *e*, this strengthens primordial qi, nourishes the spirit, and serves as the gradual foundation for establishing them. As for depletion, loss, or the onslaught of illness, this method dispels sickness, secures the primordial, serves as a tonic to prolong life, and is a technique for nurturing destiny—truly a simple and accessible gateway!

Written on the Lower Prime Festival of the *xinsi* year of the Xianchun reign of the Song, by Li Gongming, Master Yuxi of Yichun.

*The Regulating Center Diagram*

The *Regulating Center* is like dwelling within a compass’s circle, like the singular self within a great round mirror. Simply rectify the mind and sincerely set the will as the central pillar. When all myriad thoughts are extinguished, the True Person appears—like a fish leaping in the deep abyss, swimming in joy yet never leaving the square inch of the heart. When joy, anger, sorrow, and delight have yet to arise, at this moment one may abide within the *Regulating Center*, swimming in its currents, subtly guiding the four seasons, and rectifying the workings of creation. Within the four postures of dignity, one must not lose proper measure!

When things come, respond; once the response passes, return to the center—never allowing the central pillar to be disturbed. Within the center, maintain emptiness, not a speck of dust standing. Over time, neither indulgent nor restrained, one naturally attains the wondrous use of it.

When the six yin energies return to *Kun*, and the ten thousand things take root at their origin, then return to the beginning of *Jian*’s sprouting—when the eldest son severs the father’s body, and the first yang stirs in concealment, before the ten thousand things have arisen—this is where the work begins. At this time, sit cross-legged in great stillness, concentrate the spirit within, and refine the breath to a continuous thread. Silently guard it, and a single *qi* will come from the midst of emptiness and nothingness—dim and obscure, without color or form. It is not born from the depths of *Zi*, *Xuan*, *Ming*, *Kun*, or *Gui*, but arises within the kidneys to nurture primordial essence. Day by day and month by month, it grows stronger: first dispelling illness, then returning to infancy, and ultimately forming the foundation of the inner elixir.

Master Yuan said: *"Primordial qi supplements primordial qi—how could it be mere cinnabar or stone?"* This is the supreme method of supplementation.

*Morning Layering* is the beginning of the noble one’s great undertaking, the first sprouting of the ten thousand things, the bud of benevolence. At the *Fuzi* hour, the first-born *qi* resides in the kidneys—it comes unbidden, so one should preserve and nurture it. Regulate the breath so that the ears do not hear it; simply listen for its gentle, continuous flow, harmonizing with nature. Then it will resonate with the celestial lock and key. Over time, kidney *qi* will merge with heart *qi*, and from their mutual interaction, sweet dew descends, giving birth to the Mysterious Pearl.

*Evening Veiling* is the work of nurturing the upright and sagely achievement, ensuring one does not lose the original heart of the infant—this is the bud of righteousness. At the *Wu* hour, the first-born *qi* resides in the heart—it, too, comes unbidden. Without thought or worry, inwardly illuminate and unite with it. Sit in stillness and observe; over time, the heart will merge with kidney *qi*, accomplishing the work of *Completion*.

Humans dwell as one of the Three Powers, and the workings of creation within the body are equal to those of heaven and earth. Thus, as the sun and moon move in their courses, the *qi* of heaven and earth resonate, and the essence of the True One aligns. The human primordial *qi* spans eight hundred and ten *zhang*, harmonizing with the two *qi*’s lock and key. Therefore, the great movement of primordial *qi* follows heaven, and its minor movement follows the sun.

Yet people, unable to embody the vast workings of heaven and earth, bring about ruin and decay, their spirits confused and disordered, thus straying from them. How could heaven and earth ever stray? Those who know the Dao, if they can follow principle and grasp the mechanism, may align with the workings of creation and engage in inner refinement for the Dao of long life and enduring vision.

Beyond humanity, all things are endowed with the primordial chaos, equally transformed within primordial *qi*—how could they ever master it? As the *Can Tong Qi* states: *"In spring and summer, rely on the inner body, from *Zi* to *Chen* and *Si*. In autumn and winter, apply the outer use, from *Wu* to *Xu* and *Hai*."* It also says: *"Rewards and punishments correspond to spring and autumn; dawn and dusk correspond to cold and heat. Long abstention fosters benevolence and righteousness; responses follow the times with joy and anger."* Thus, in accordance with the four seasons, the five phases attain their proper order.

The *Inner Teachings of the Central Yellow*:
Master Yuzhen said: *"The Great Dao of the Central Yellow within the Limitless is originally transmitted mouth-to-heart, without reliance on written words. Now, out of compassion for those newly entering the path—who may hear it once yet fail to remember—I have devised this skillful expedient, allowing it to enter the ear, settle in the heart, and be grasped by the eye and spirit. Once transmission is complete, burn it immediately—do not let it spread carelessly."*

The *Inner Teachings* state: *"Heaven has nine palaces, earth has nine provinces, and humans have nine orifices. Heaven’s Central Yellow is the Great Yang, earth’s Central Yellow is the Great Yin, and the human Central Yellow is the ordinary shoulder—all are called the Central Yellow of the Eight Extremities. ‘Central’ denotes its position; ‘yellow’ denotes its color—hence, the Central Yellow. The Eight Extremities are the convergence of the eight directions, yet it is merely the Central Palace: the Yellow Court, the Mysterious Female, the primordial *qi* of pre-heaven, the Mysterious Pass, the place of utmost goodness, the Dao of the Yellow Pole, the mean held by *Dui*. In the five phases, it is earth; in the five viscera, it is the spleen; in the five constants, it is trust. Medicines, the three *qi*, the five spirits, fire times, and breathing—all reside here! In movement and stillness, sitting and lying down, one must always focus the mind, never parting from it for even a moment. Do not neglect worldly affairs, but always rectify the mind when engaging with things, constantly responding yet constantly still."*

Our ancestral master said: *"Much speech and frequent action lead to exhaustion—better to guard the center."* He also said: *"Thirty spokes share one hub. The spokes are the ribs; the hub is the central shoulder."* And again: *"Between heaven and earth, is it not like a bellows?"*—this refers to breathing. On exhalation, kidney *qi* rises and stops when it meets earth; on inhalation, heart fluid descends and rests when it encounters earth. This is called water and fire, refined to form the Great Elixir. If one can preserve and guard it, no method will fail to be efficacious.

I often say: *"If you wish for the Dao’s methods to be efficacious, you must guard the central shoulder."* The *center* is the principle of aligning the four directions above and below, neither leaning nor tilting. Heaven and earth are separated by eighty-four thousand *li*; the heart and kidneys within the human body are the heaven and earth of the self, separated by eight *cun* and four *fen*—measured by the joints of the middle finger, from the navel to the tip of the *Jiuwei* bone, there are only eight *cun* and four *fen*."*

Now, the navel is spoken of as corresponding to the kidneys. Thus, three *cun* and six *fen* below the heart lies the navel, and three *cun* and six *fen* above the kidneys lies the navel—only the one *cun* and two *fen* between them is the Yellow Court, which governs the life and destiny of the self. This is called the Way of the Utmost Sage. Guard it! Guard it well!

The Three Mao Perfected Lords say: *"Refine essence into *qi*, gather *qi* into spirit; when essence and spirit are not scattered, this is called cultivating the True."* Child does not leave mother, mother does not leave child; when child and mother hold fast to one another, there is longevity without death.

Master of Cavernous Truth says: *"Guard carefully, guard carefully—speak not, speak not. Let it be natural, let it be natural—mysterious and again mysterious."* Those who hear the Dao are blessed across a thousand lifetimes, for they bear the karmic affinity for immortality. Yet if, in casual conversation, one carelessly reveals it to others, unforeseen calamities and spreading disasters may follow. After receiving this transmission, practice it diligently.

The Perfected One of Jade Creek says: *"The Confucian lineage of Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Kings Wen and Wu, the Duke of Zhou, and Confucius, along with Yan, Zeng, Zisi, and Mencius—this Dao has been transmitted through their succession."* In my youth, I, Sheng, admired purity and emptiness and devoted myself to the Supreme Way. Of the ten thousand methods and thousand gates, none did I fail to seek out from masters.

While traveling to Mount Heng, I encountered a perfected one who secretly transmitted to me the *Purple Yang Immortal’s* oral instructions on the Elixir. Following the nine palaces and eight trigrams, I exchanged years for months, months for days, and days for hours. Drawing the upright *qi* of heaven and earth, I seized the marvelous workings of creation, gathering them into the Central Palace to interact and form the Elixir. This not only extends years but allows one to abide in the world—so it is said: *"My life rests with me, not with heaven."*

Since attaining this, my body has not declined, my hair and temples have not whitened, I walk a hundred *li* in a day, and my movements are light and effortless. The numinous proofs and confirmations are too many to recount. Within this method, the regulation of water and fire is also called the *Kan-Li* (Water-Fire) Intercourse. With prolonged practice, one can refine the Elixir.

People today are dominated by fiery dryness rising upward and watery dampness sinking downward, naturally attracting yin and evil *qi* to take advantage of the gaps, bringing illness and premature death. If one encounters this oral instruction, the Five Phases are inverted in their defense: the dragon emerges from within fire, and the tiger is born from within water. When the Five Phases proceed in order, one remains ordinary; when they move in reverse, one becomes a sage—mysterious and again mysterious.

The oral instructions that follow state: *"With each ascent, lift and gather *qi* to the navel; with each descent, swallow, and water and fire meet."* These sixteen characters are simple and easy to practice. They are not bound by time—whether in office, one may attend to affairs without hindrance; though living in wealth and nobility, one may still apply them. This is what is meant by *"the Supreme Way is not complicated."*

For those with wind illnesses, the effects are swift. Simply take a brief moment at midday, whether sitting cross-legged, feet dangling, or upright—no posture is restricted.

Gauge the breath by the inhalation and exhalation through the nose. Inhalation is called *xi* (drawing in); with it, ascend the *qi*, gently lifting forward with subtle force from the lower region until the *qi* fully returns to the navel—this is what is meant by *"qi gathers to the navel."* The navel is the sea of *qi* within a person, where the primordial *qi* is entirely stored.

Exhalation is called *hu* (releasing); with it, relax the body at ease, swallow once with a gurgling sound—this is what is meant by *"water and fire meet."* Practice thus without counting repetitions; proceed as you will, cease when you must. If one persists long enough, the area below the navel will often feel as if warmed by fire, the abdomen’s *qi* will rumble like thunder, urination will gradually diminish, essence and *qi* will not leak, the waist and spine will grow firm, appetite will double, all illnesses will leave the body, and external pathogens will not invade. After a year of practice, all long-standing ailments will be eradicated. With prolonged practice, the Three Palaces will naturally ascend and descend, the Two *Qi* will circulate endlessly, and the Great Dao will be achieved—longevity and enduring vision.

In past years, Master Guo Haiwang in the capital taught people to follow the breath’s ascent and descent through the nose but did not impart the method of lifting and gathering. Later, Daoist Li of Enzhou taught Yang Heyu only the method of lifting and gathering but not the method of breath’s entry and exit—both used only half the practice. I once traveled to Purple Qi Peak beneath Mount Nanyue, where I received the secret instructions directly from Master Li. The master was from the east of the mountain, aged one hundred and five, with hair and beard untouched by white, his face like a child’s, and his steps swift as flight. Having verified the practice through personal experience, I dare not keep it secret and now transmit it faithfully to those who cherish the Dao.

**Direct Pointers to the Elixir Canon of the Azure Mist Elder**

From youth, I studied the Dao. In my early twenties, I left home and wandered rivers and lakes, seeking masters and questioning friends. Since receiving the teachings of my late master Zhang Wuzhen, I have pored over the alchemical canons, poems, admonitions, and records of past worthies, reading deeply and reflecting on their meanings. I have also visited countless Daoist companions and practitioners, explored famous mountains and grotto-heavens, and prayed to uncover the inscriptions on stone steles and cave walls, thereby obtaining the essentials of the *Great Dao to Dispel Delusion* from the Immortal Haiqiong.

Later, I met the Recluse of Sudden Enlightenment at the Scarlet Mound Grotto-Heaven, who composed poems to bestow upon me, through which I first grasped the wondrous purport of Haiqiong’s teachings. Only then did I realize that my youthful studies, my searches and observations, had been like building a house atop another house, grafting branches onto branches—unaware that the house was already a house, the branch already a branch, and that the Dao lies near yet is sought afar.

One day, I suddenly awakened. Fearing these teachings might sink into oblivion, and considering that later learners may not be as earnest or attentive, I record these few words to bequeath to posterity. Those who receive them may interpret the meaning through the text, awaken sharply, and apply effort—though they seek no master, the master is within.

The four great elements of a man’s body are all yin; only the precelestial *qi*, the true yang, is singular. This *qi* is not the breath of exhalation and inhalation, nor does it have form, shadow, or visible sign. Thus, Master Wuzhen said it is *"visible but unusable, usable but invisible."* Before this *qi* received form, while still in the mother’s womb, one first received this *qi*, then the two kidneys formed, followed by the two eyes. From this arose the heart, liver, spleen, lungs, the nine orifices, and the four limbs, until the human form was complete.

This *qi* resides between the two kidneys, called the Gate of the Mysterious Female. My late master’s *Song of the Mysterious Female* explains this in detail. People of this world fail to comprehend it. When slaughtering livestock, they see only the empty membrane between the two kidneys, where the breath pulses and swells until the flesh cools and stills. While a person is yet alive, *qi* and blood flourish, hun and po are bound together, the five colors are contained within, and the received *qi* is like boiling water. At death, the person becomes like livestock: *qi* and blood scatter, the *qi* weakens, and only this singular *qi* remains—the great medicine of the golden elixir.

Thus, my late master deemed the liver, heart, spleen, lungs, gallbladder, kidneys, intestines, essence, fluids, snivel, tears, *qi*, and blood as not pertaining to the Dao, and even the spirit, essence, hun, po, and intent as seemingly correct yet incorrect. Within a person’s body, the right foot is Greater Yin, the left foot Greater Yang, and the soles are the Bubbling Springs, emitting the two *qi* of water and fire. These enter the coccyx from both feet, ascend to merge with the two kidneys—the left is the Kidney Hall, the right the Essence Palace—one water, one fire, one tortoise, one snake, mutually enclosing and unlocking.

Between the two kidneys, an empty aperture arises—this is the Mysterious Female. The *qi* of the two kidneys penetrates the Mysterious Female, from which the yellow and red pathways emerge, ascending the double passes of the spine, traversing the twenty-four vertebrae, passing through the heart and abdomen, entering beneath the diaphragm, converging at the Wind Mansion, and ascending to the Mud Pill Palace. From the Mud Pill Palace, it descends to the Bright Hall, dispersing to irrigate the Five Palaces, then enters the Jade Lock of the Double Passes, flowing directly into the Crimson Palace before returning to its origin. Day and night, it circulates endlessly, all naturally so—it is not something fabricated by moving hands and feet.

Those who stray into side paths today do not understand the principle of emptiness and naturalness, the subtle workings of silent operation. Instead, they recklessly engage in bending and stretching, exhaling and swallowing, rubbing and guiding, visualizing and gazing, indulging in wild thoughts and actions, thereby inviting illness. Witness the White Lotus Daoists, many of whom suffer from jaundice and swelling, or the *qi*-circulating practitioners, many of whom develop *qi* distension—these are the proofs.

This singular *qi* is the same in everyone, neither more nor less. Only those who cultivate it can succeed; those who do not cannot. Its circulation and movement follow fixed patterns, like the tides of the sea, which respond unfailingly to the waxing and waning of the moon, or the handle of the Dipper, which shifts naturally between midnight and noon. It is like a woman’s menstruation or a person’s malarial fever—arriving punctually, precisely, without deviation.

This *qi* becomes fire when encountering yang and water when encountering yin. Fire is the essence of wood, and water is the essence of metal. The left kidney is *Kan* (☵), the right kidney is *Li* (☲); within *Li* lies *ji*, and within *Kan* lies *wu*. Combining *wu* and *ji*—the two earths—forms the character *gui* (圭), also called "metal within water." Metal is the blade, hence the name *daogui* (刀圭). Moreover, fire is wood, and water is metal, making metal and wood inseparable, water and fire dwelling in the same realm. In truth, metal, wood, water, and fire are but one earth, and this one earth encompasses the Five Phases.

The former masters regarded this as the primordial *qi* of the five viscera, while the six bowels lack essence—this is what they meant. This *qi* circulates naturally at all times, without reliance on human effort. All references to the windlass and three carts, the Yellow River and Cao Creek, are but metaphors for this process, not something forced by human exertion.

This *qi* invariably arrives at the *zi* hour as yang fire, at the *wu* hour as yin water, at the *mao* hour as the essence of wood, and at the *you* hour as the essence of metal. Within *mao* lies *jia*, and within *you* lies *geng*; thus, one must gather *jia* and *geng*. Within *zi* lies *wu*, and within *wu* lies *ji*; thus, one moves the central earth.

Without profound understanding of the ascent and descent of heaven and earth, the waxing and waning of yin and yang, the maturity of medicinal ingredients, and the concealment and flourishing of water and fire, one is unfit to discuss these matters. Yet the former masters expounded upon them in great detail, and the more they spoke, the more confusion arose—why? Because they ultimately dwelled in emptiness and nothingness, unaware of where to begin the work. Thus, embryonic breathing fails, and one lapses into mere vacuity, neglecting the natural while drowning in wild thoughts and forced actions, squandering spirit and mind, and inviting illness instead.

"Emptiness" refers to its invisibility and inaudibility; it is within the void that one must work to unify and solidify it. "Naturalness" means it cannot be forcibly grasped or summoned. Today’s teachings on gathering, firing, and timing—each step clearly articulated, each stage meticulously observed—when followed with care, yield unfailing results.

Before entering the chamber, one must first understand the placement of the cauldron and the gathering of the medicine. Practice seated meditation day and night. Once seated in stillness, the joints open, the meridians flow, and from the bladder to the spine, movement arises like a turning wheel. The primordial *qi* naturally ascends through the Three Passes to the Mud Pill Palace, descends the Double Towers, and enters the Crimson Palace. Yet its arrival has its time, and gathering likewise has its moment. One must await the flourishing of *jia* and *geng*—the metal and wood phases—sitting in silent composure, without need for rubbing or stirring.

After a while, one feels heat at the crown and sweet dew dripping from the throat. Then, with the eyes turned inward, direct the intention to guide it downward, receiving it into the Crimson Palace and the Mysterious Gate, where it rests.

Within a single day, *jia* corresponds to the waxing moon and *geng* to the waning moon. From *zi* to *mao* is the waxing phase, yielding half a catty of mercury; from *wu* to *you* is the waning phase, yielding half a catty of lead. Gathering *jia*-mercury and *geng*-lead, each half a catty, fulfills the natural measure. The saying "when lead sees *gui* arise, gather swiftly" refers to gathering wood-mercury and metal-lead at the *jia* and *geng* hours—this is the method of gathering.

At first, one does not count the years or months; only through long accumulation does the cauldron and furnace take form. The body is the furnace, the Crimson Palace is the cauldron—today’s misconceptions, such as taking the Yellow Court in the spleen or the Mud Pill Palace in the crown as the cauldron, are incorrect. Only after years of effort does the furnace and cauldron form, after which one plants the medicine. Once the medicine sprouts, one gathers and refines it simultaneously. Gathering and accumulating yields the medicine; refining and tempering yields the fire. Each day of gathering yields a certain weight, and each day of refining yields a fraction of progress.

When gathering the medicine, one must collect the flourishing *qi* of *jia* and *geng*. When applying the fire, one avoids *jia* and *geng*—this is the difference in bathing. The method of gathering is like that of the cauldron: one does not observe with the eyes. When the natural arrival comes, one welcomes it with intention and guides it with the gaze. Hence the alchemical texts speak of the Yellow Matron and the Blue Maiden: the Yellow Matron is intention, the Blue Maiden is the eye. Welcoming with intention is called "the Yellow Matron’s matchmaking"; guiding with the gaze is called "the Blue Maiden’s message." The *qi* of the body moves with intention—where intention goes, it follows; where intention halts, it stops. Thus, guiding it into the cauldron, it halts with intention and no longer flows downward—this is called planting the medicine.

Once the medicine enters the cauldron, there follows the firing process. The sages taught that the medicine is not transmitted with the fire, for fire and medicine, though sharing the same path, serve different functions. *Zi* is the first yang, and by *si*, the sixth yang is complete. From *zi* to *si*, fire attains the number six, and the six yangs form *Qian* (☰). During this period, one welcomes with intention—this is called "advancing the fire" or "adding." *Wu* is the first yin, and by *hai*, the sixth yin is complete. From *wu* to *hai*, water attains the number six, and the six yins form *Kun* (☷). One guides with intention—this is called "retreating the fire" or "withdrawing." Thus, *zi-si* is fire, and *wu-hai* is water. Though water is not named, advancing is fire, and withdrawing is water. All occurs naturally, without forced effort.

The alchemical classics speak of the numbers of the *River Chart* and *Luo Writing*—they refer to the firing process aligning naturally with these generative numbers, not requiring forced effort to match them. The phrases "morning *tun*, evening *meng*," "day *gou*, night *fu*," also describe alignment with the hexagrams, not something achieved through forced effort.

As for the circulation of *qi*, it flows and irrigates the five viscera and hundred meridians. At *hai-zi*, water flourishes in the kidneys; at *yin-mao*, wood flourishes in the liver; at *si-wu*, fire flourishes in the heart; at *shen-you*, metal flourishes in the lungs; at *chen-xu-chou-wei*, earth flourishes in the spleen. The *qi* naturally circulates, emerging from the flourishing palace—there is no need to imagine its entry and exit at specific times and viscera.

At the outset of gathering ingredients and preparing the crucible, there are no prohibitions or taboos—when the time arrives, act; once done, let it be. However, when ingesting the elixir and applying the firing process, one must select an auspicious day to enter the chamber, ensuring not even the slightest mundane affair intrudes. Let the ears, eyes, nose, and mouth—all four images—be forgotten, the mind as serene as emptiness, where the empty room gives birth to light. If any attachment arises, the sealing is imperfect, the medicine leaks away, and the Dao is lost.

Once within the chamber, maintain a state of neither hunger nor fullness, avoid seeking sleep, and keep the mind ever alert, perpetually awakened. When the medicine appears, gather it; when the fire arises, apply it. Within a year, only the second and eighth months (卯 and 酉) are exempt from the water and fire processes, for in 卯, wood flourishes, and in 酉, metal flourishes—wood’s flourishing stokes fire, metal’s flourishing stokes water. During these two months, applying water and fire would reverse the process and cause harm.

Of the twelve months in a year, excluding 卯 and 酉, only ten remain—thus the embryo forms in ten months. Beyond ten months, further firing is unnecessary, for it would damage the elixir; this is the firing process. After ten months, the embryo is complete and transferred to the *niwan* (mud-pill palace), called "changing the crucible." Once the embryo’s *qi* is sufficient, like a child born, it requires only nourishment—hence the transfer to *niwan* is called "nursing."

At this stage, no further firing or effort is needed, nor are there bathings; one must only constantly warm and nurture it. After three years and nine months, the Heavenly Gate will open of itself, and the infant will naturally emerge—moving freely without obstruction, one ascends to the rank of immortal elder.

This entire process, from beginning to end, unfolds naturally, without reliance on human effort or forced imagination; one merely awaits the moment with intent. It is the accumulation of days and months, the preparation of the crucible and furnace, the ten months of gestation and firing. The ancients spoke of the golden elixir glowing red in a single day—how can it be achieved in an instant? It means that in half a day’s work, one may seize a year and a half’s transformation. When the medicine arises, one need only greet it in that moment—this is the "instant golden elixir," not the result of days and nights spent in labored thought and forced effort.

The terms—medicine furnace and crucible, firing process and bathing, fetal breathing and infant, operation and withdrawal, host and guest, floating and sinking, ascent and descent, lead and mercury, true water and fire, earth, metal essence and wood fluid—are all borrowed names, aliases. In truth, they describe a single interconnected process, which, once thoroughly understood, reveals its meaning.

The teachings of the masters—whether on effort, practice, emptiness, or naturalness—are all contained within the many alchemical classics and oral instructions. The *Cantong Qi* and other texts converge in unity, no more than this. Yet speaking of it is not difficult; practicing it is difficult. Practicing it is not difficult; maintaining it is difficult. Why is maintaining it so difficult?

Generally, minor arts and peripheral methods yield no karmic response, but the Golden Elixir alone brings forth such consequences. For those who gather the medicine in their youth, half a year’s effort is required: maintaining purity, bathing in ritual, abstaining from desire, sitting in forgetfulness, and silently drawing in the essence. When the appointed time arrives, the ears and eyes, hands and feet grow light and strong, all illnesses vanish, and naturally the fire of the two kidneys rises, the spine pulses like a turning wheel, the mud-pill palace boils as if scalded, and sweet dew constantly drips into the mouth. If one can remain sleepless, preserving spirit without interruption, within two months the eyes will radiate divine light, and the heart will become luminous. For those of keen nature, this is the sign. Yet those who attain it must not mistake it for the supreme Dao, lest a single deluded thought arise and madness ensue.

After three months of firing, if the work is unerring at every moment, the nine orifices will shine with light, a golden wheel will crown the head, and inner and outer vision will penetrate all, reaching even spirits and ghosts. At this time, the infant has taken form, yet one must not allow it free movement or egress—vigilant protection and firm containment are essential, lest the fire leak and the elixir fail. When ten months are complete, the infant has received sufficient qi, and like a ripe fruit, naturally detaches from the stem. Only then may it come and go, shifting the body by yards or feet, though one must not venture too far; upon departure, swift return is necessary, for if the spirit is seized and wanders, it may enter rebirth or transformation, never again regarding its former abode.

Truly, only after three to nine years, when the time is fulfilled and the bones and frame have matured—like one who has lived decades, discerning the weight and measure of human affairs—may the infant be allowed to come and go freely. Then one ascends in transformation, attaining the rank of true immortality. Yet even then, demonic obstacles arise! During deep meditation and forgetfulness, clarity and wisdom redouble, and a hundred marvels manifest: all the strange and wondrous events of the world, matters of life and death, rare encounters with immortals, and terrifying apparitions of ghosts and spirits gather before one, as if seen with the divine eye. Or spirits may cling and attach—these are the demonic obstacles. One must not mistake them for the Dao; steadfast resolve and unshakable focus are required, holding fast to the One of the Great Mystery and preserving the true form. Above all, one must not mistake the illusory for the real, nor follow emotion as nature. Only by thus guarding the One can the Dao be achieved.

Many today lack such steadfastness and discernment, and so are possessed by external demons, failing in their cultivation and even falling into ruin, leading them to doubt the very existence of immortals. Alas! Throughout my life, I have studied the classics, sought friends, consulted masters, and practiced diligently, witnessing such proofs firsthand. I now share them with future seekers. Those of aspiration should study these words, seek their meaning, and compare them with the alchemical classics and oral instructions of past masters, as well as the profound and secret teachings of the *Daoist Canon*—all will align.

Yet one must follow this practice: after the ten-month gestation and the transference of the crucible for nurturing, one must then seek the higher step before consulting the *Wuzhen Pian’s* latter section for advanced methods. Naturally, rare and ineffable encounters will arise. Without proceeding in this order, the body will lack a master, the infant will not mature, and reckless engagement in Chan or other practices will be like water without a source or wood without roots—leading only to dull emptiness.

Beneath dull emptiness, one neglects the foundational work of unifying the cinnabar field into a single realm, which is the principle of thorough integration. Any leakage will leave one fruitless even in old age, ultimately returning to the cycle of rebirth and lower destinies. Reflect: daily effort in emptiness, refining the elixir, merging into oneness and authenticity—this alone is true integration. Further refining the cinnabar field into a treasure then allows the body to shed and the spirit to transform—this is the true jewel. With this jewel embodied, the depth of one’s achievement after the elixir’s completion, the firmness of one’s grasp—these determine the karmic response, for this is where effort is applied. Not a moment may be neglected, not a step may be abandoned.

Among the outcomes, flying ascent is supreme, corpse liberation is secondary, possession of a vessel is lesser still, and rebirth is the lowest. As for flying ascent, it is one with long life and eternal vision; corpse liberation is another. Both require the perfection of merit and the fulfillment of conduct, along with the virtue of aiding heaven’s work, benefiting beings, and serving others—only then may one attain them. Without such merit, one may only extend years and prolong life, but cannot become an immortal.

Why say this? Once the spirit departs and does not return, the qi severs and does not revive. Above, one may seize a vessel; below, one may enter rebirth; or worse, become a wandering, unattached soul. I grieve for the deluded and confused—among thousands who speak of the Dao, only one or two achieve it. Thus, I have set this forth as a warning to future seekers. Unworthy as I am, I have dared to compile this book. May later readers ponder and study it as if facing a teacher, as if beholding a sovereign or father. Treasure it, preserve it carefully, and never show or transmit it to the unworthy. Those who violate these words will first bring calamity upon themselves, then upon their nine generations, sinking into the ceaseless hells with no hope of escape.

**Song of the Great Dao**
The Dao is not far—it dwells within the body.
All things are empty, yet nature is not.
If nature is not empty, spirit and qi abide;
When qi returns to the primordial sea, life is endless.
To keep the spirit within the body from departing,
Let not a single thing linger in the numinous terrace.
If things remain, the spirit is not clear,
Draining true essence and harming sinew and bone.
Spirit guides qi, qi sustains form—
No need for miscellaneous arts to attain long life.
Arts are easy, but the Dao is rarely met;
How many, having met it, do not practice single-mindedly?

Thus do thousands and ten thousands study, yet in the end scarcely one or two succeed.
When the spirit departs, draw it back;
When the spirit returns to the body, qi naturally follows.
Morning and evening thus, day after day,
The true embryo of the red child is spontaneously conceived.

The golden lock is the site of the Mysterious Pass,
The jade key is the primordial qi.
In silent sitting, regulate the breath within the nose,
Gaze inward to guard the central gate, attaining the place of samādhi.
Naturally, spirit and breath flow ceaselessly,
Without the slightest stray thought.
Once the breath is harmonized and even,
The nose no longer senses inhalation or exhalation;
Only the central locus remains, the mind steadfastly fixed.
With primordial qi, breathe and draw the breath into the Mysterious Pass.
Suddenly, a sound is heard—the pass opens,
And in that moment, one beholds wondrous sights.
At this stage of practice, the central character is fully illuminated.

The golden crucible seeks to retain mercury within cinnabar;
The golden crucible is the central character, the very center of the furnace,
Where retention is desired.
The mercury within cinnabar is the primordial essence.

The jade pool first receives silver within the water;
The jade pool is the Flowery Pond,
The water is the spirit-water.
Within the golden crucible, one seeks to retain the mercury.

During silent sitting, first guard the central gate.
Once the central gate is firmly held,
Inhalation and exhalation naturally become subtle and still.
After this stillness, the breath settles,
Primordial qi moves freely, concealing the breath within.
When the body feels wholly merged,
As if unaware of things, of oneself, of heaven and earth,
Then the water of the Flowery Pond arises of itself.
When the mouth is full, swallow with a gurgling sound,
Directing it with intention to the central gate.
At the Mysterious Pass, a gurgling sound like a lock opening is heard.
Then close the eyes and turn the gaze inward,
Observing one’s inner realm—marvelous visions,
Scenes beyond full description.

**Questions and Answers on the Golden Elixir**

**Question:** What is the Golden Fluid Returned Elixir?
**Answer:** The Golden Fluid is gold, which is water. Gold is the mother of water, and the mother conceals the child within the womb, hence the name "Returned Elixir." As the ancients said: "The Elixir is the Cinnabar Field; the Fluid is the fluid of the lungs. Returning the lung-fluid to the Cinnabar Field is called the Golden Fluid Returned Elixir."

**Question:** What are lead and mercury?
**Answer:** They are not ordinary black lead and quicksilver. Master True Unity said: "Lead is the father and mother of heaven and earth, the root of yin and yang." The sages gather the root of heaven and earth’s parents to form the foundation of the Great Elixir, and collect the pure essence of yin and yang to constitute its substance—this is no common material alchemy. Mercury’s nature is to fly, but when it meets lead, it congeals, for child and mother yearn for each other.

**Question:** What is fire?
**Answer:** Fire is the true qi of the Great Yang, the yang within *kan*. As the Perfected One of Purple Clarity said: "Raising fire from within *kan*."

**Question:** What is a *hou*?
**Answer:** Five days make one *hou*, completing one cycle of the *jiazi*. A day has twelve hours; five days have sixty hours, completing one *jiazi*. Master Purple Yang said: "A moment’s work contains a year’s seasons." This refers to the instant when fire is kindled, and in that moment, one revolution of heaven is completed.

**Question:** What is this fire-*hou*?
**Answer:** In the sun, use the moon; in the moon, use the sun. In the day, use the hour; in the hour, use the moment.

**Question:** What are movement and stillness?
**Answer:** Yang governs movement; yin governs stillness. As *Emerald Void* said: "Seek stillness within movement; act within stillness. Movement and stillness have their functions—this is transmitted orally."

**Question:** What is the Ninefold Return?
**Answer:** Metal generates four; its completion number is nine. "Return" means descending from above. Nine is the number of old yang. Master Perfected Yin said: "From *zi* to *shen* is the Ninefold Return, proceeding in sequence."

**Question:** What is the Sevenfold Reversion?
**Answer:** Fire generates two; its completion number is seven. "Reversion" means ascending from below. Seven is the number of young yang. Master Perfected Yin said: "From *yin* to *shen* is the Sevenfold Reversion, proceeding in reverse."

**Question:** What is the furnace?
**Answer:** In the superior elixir method, the spirit is the furnace, nature is the medicine, stillness is the water, and wisdom is the fire. In the middle elixir method, the spirit is the furnace, qi is the medicine, the sun is the fire, and the moon is the water. In the inferior elixir method, the body is the furnace, qi is the medicine, the heart is the fire, and the kidneys are the water. There is also the recumbent moon furnace.

**Question:** What is the crucible?
**Answer:** As Master Bao said: "The golden crucible lies near the Mud Pill Palace." This refers to the Yellow Emperor’s casting of the nine crucibles.

**Question:** What are the medicinal substances?
**Answer:** These very substances, when used in sequence, form a person; when used in reverse, they form the Elixir. The Five Phases in inversion become the seven treasures of the great earth; in sequence, they become the fiery pit of the dharma-realm. The common people use them daily yet remain unaware. As Master Purple Clarity said: "Gather the medicinal substances from within the unmoving."

**Question:** What are the Spirit-Water and the Flowery Pond?
**Answer:** Li Quan said: "The essence of the Returned Elixir lies in the Spirit-Water and Flowery Pond." Master Purple Yang said: "When lead enters mercury, it is called Spirit-Water; when mercury enters lead, it is called the Flowery Pond." Master Sea Toad said: "From of old, Spirit-Water flows from the high source." Master Purple Clarity said: "The Flowery Pond lies within the Sea of Qi."

**Question:** What are the Three Passes?
**Answer:** The head is the Celestial Pass, the feet are the Earthly Pass, and the hands are the Human Pass.

**Question:** What are the Three Inner Essentials?
**Answer:** The first essential is the Great Abyss Pool; the second is the Crimson Palace; the third is the Earthly Gate.

**Question:** What are the Outer Three Essentials?
**Answer:** The mouth and the two nostrils—these three apertures are the gates through which spirit and qi come and go. When practicing the lesser work, regulate the breath through the nose, seal the tongue’s qi, and close the *dui*.

**Question:** What is *dui*?
**Answer:** Master True Unity said: "*Dui* is the mouth."

**Question:** Where do the Infant Boy and the Maiden Girl reside?
**Answer:** The Infant Boy is in the kidneys; the Maiden Girl is in the heart.

**Question:** The kidneys belong to water and are yin. The Infant Boy is yang. The heart belongs to fire and is yang; the Maiden Girl is yin. Why do they dwell there?
**Answer:** The kidneys belong to *kan*, where yin contains yang—this is true yang. The heart belongs to *li*, where yang contains yin—this is true yin.

**Question:** Where is the Mud Pill Palace located?
**Answer:** The head has nine palaces; the central one is called the Mud Pill.

**Question:** What is the Metal Lord?
**Answer:** The Metal Lord, clad in gold, is lead. Master Purple Yang said: "One must seek and subdue the Metal Lord."

**Question:** What is the Yellow Dame?
**Answer:** Yellow is the color of earth, whose position is *kun*; hence the name. Master Purple Clarity said: "The Metal Lord is silent. When the Maiden Girl dies, the Yellow Dame, though aged, still carries the embryo."

**Question:** What is breathing like?
**Answer:** Exhalation issues from the heart and lungs; inhalation enters the kidneys and liver. Exhalation connects to the Celestial Root; inhalation connects to the Earthly Root. Exhalation makes the dragon chant and clouds rise; inhalation makes the tiger roar and winds stir. Through the breath’s wind and clouds, golden liquid congeals.

**Question:** What are the Jade Nectar and the Elixir Liquor?
**Answer:** Both are Spirit-Water.

**Question:** What are spirit and qi?
**Answer:** Spirit is fire, and fire belongs to the heart. Qi is the medicine, and medicine belongs to the body—spirit and qi are mother and child. The Heavenly Master of Empty Stillness said: "Qi is the source of life; spirit is its regulator. To sustain fullness, govern spirit; to focus qi, embrace the One. Spirit dwells by relying on qi; when they unite, one may attain longevity." The Three Mao Perfected Lords said: "Qi is the medicine that adds years; the heart is the spirit that directs qi. Know the master of qi’s movement, and you become an immortal."

**Question:** What is the Twelve-Storied Tower?
**Answer:** The human throat has twelve segments—this is it.

**Question:** What are the Curtain and Veil?
**Answer:** They are the eyes. When practicing the lesser work, contain the light. The Cloud Chamber says: "Close the door, lower the curtain, and silently observe."

**Question:** What are *zi* and *wu*?
**Answer:** *Zi* and *wu* are the center of heaven and earth. In heaven, they are the sun and moon; in humans, the heart and kidneys; in time, *zi* and *wu*; in the hexagrams, *kan* and *li*; in direction, north and south.

**Question:** What does it mean that the five positions interact and each has its counterpart?
**Answer:** The numbers of heaven and earth total fifty-five. Thus, *qian* takes one and nine, combining to make ten; *kun* takes four and six, combining to make ten; *xun* and *dui* take two and eight, combining to make ten; *zhen* and *gen* take three and seven, combining to make ten. *Li* takes five; *kan* takes ten. *Kan* and *li* have no pair, so they unite on their own. In terms of numbers, this yields the central number of heaven and earth; in terms of lines, the central lines; in terms of positions, the central places. How great are *kan* and *li*!

**Question:** What are the Five Peaks?
**Answer:** The *Chart of the True Forms of the Five Peaks* says: "They are in the human head." Master Purple Clarity has the line: "A kerchief conceals the Five Peaks crown."

**Question:** What is the Mysterious Female?
**Answer:** Above is called *xuan*; below is called *pin*. The Mysterious Pass is a single aperture—left is *xuan*, right is *pin*.

**Question:** What is the Gate of the Mysterious Female?
**Answer:** The nose connects to celestial qi and is called the Mysterious Gate; the mouth connects to earthly qi and is called the Female Portal. Mouth and nose are the gates of the Mysterious Female.

**Question:** What are the Three Boys and Three Girls?
**Answer:** The *qian* Dao seeks *kun*: the eldest son is *zhen*, the middle son is *kan*, the youngest son is *gen*. The *kun* Dao seeks *qian*: the eldest daughter is *xun*, the middle daughter is *li*, the youngest daughter is *dui*.

**Question:** What are the Fire Dragon and Water Tiger?
**Answer:** The tiger is western metal, which generates water yet conceals its form within water. The dragon is eastern wood, which generates fire yet suffers restraint by fire. The Perfected Lord of Venus said: "The Five Phases do not proceed in order—the tiger is born within water. The art of inverting the Five Phases makes the dragon emerge from fire."

**Question:** What are the *fen* and *zhi*?

**Answer:** The *zi* hour corresponds to the winter solstice, where yin reaches its extreme and yang begins to arise. The *wu* hour corresponds to the summer solstice, where yang reaches its extreme and yin begins to arise. The *mao* hour corresponds to the spring equinox, where yang contains yin within it. The *you* hour corresponds to the autumn equinox, where yin contains yang within it. The human body also has its *fen* and *zhi*. Master Ziyang said: "Divide the body and mind into the upper and lower arcs, and distinguish the winter and summer solstices by spirit and qi."

**Question:** What is *mùyù* (bathing)?
**Answer:** When true qi steams and rises, and spirit-water irrigates, this is called *mùyù*. The Most High said: "Wash with sweet springs, cleanse the filth and grime; it emerges from the Flowery Pond and later returns to the Gate of Kun." Master Yaolin said: "*Mùyù* relies on spirit-water." Such is the case.

**Question:** What is *chōutiān* (withdrawing and adding)?
**Answer:** After withdrawing lead from behind the elbow, one must add mercury to the Central Yellow. *The Transmission of the Dao Collection* states: "When it is time to withdraw, one must not add." Such is the case.

**Question:** What is *bānyùn* (transporting)?
**Answer:** Transport the golden essence to behind the elbow, and move the jade liquid to the Mud Pill Palace. The oral instructions for the initial practice are preserved herein!

**Question:** What are the Three Fields?
**Answer:** The brain is the Upper Field, the heart is the Middle Field, and the Sea of Qi is the Lower Field. If one grasps the turning mechanism of the Dipper’s handle, then the upper and lower circulate endlessly, like the flow of the Celestial River.

**Question:** What are the Three Passes behind the back?
**Answer:** Behind the brain is the Jade Pillow Pass, alongside the spine is the Wheel-and-Axle Pass, and at the junction of water and fire is the Tail Gate Pass.

**Question:** What is the Spirit Chamber?
**Answer:** It is the chamber where the original spirit resides. Master Langran said: "Before the heart’s chamber is understood, a thousand disturbances arise; once the heart’s field is realized, ten thousand affairs become still."

**Question:** What is the *Three Flowers Gathering at the Crown*?
**Answer:** It is when spirit, qi, and essence merge as one. The Mysterious Pass is the aperture where spirit, qi, and essence gather.

**Question:** What is the *Five Qi Ascending to the Origin*?
**Answer:** It is when the true qi of the five viscera ascends to the Celestial Origin.

**Question:** What is the *Harmonizing and Uniting of the Four Images*?
**Answer:** The eyes do not see, yet the *hun* resides in the liver; the ears do not hear, yet the essence resides in the kidneys; the tongue does not move, yet the spirit resides in the heart; the nose does not smell, yet the *po* resides in the lungs. When spirit, essence, *hun*, and *po* gather in the Earth of Intent, this is the case.

**Question:** What are the *Horse-Teeth True Master* and the *Divine Talisman White Snow*?
**Answer:** Both are general names for lead and mercury.

**Question:** What is the *River Chariot*?
**Answer:** It is the true qi of the north, called the River Chariot. The left is the *Sun Hub*, the right the *Moon Wheel*; it transports the true qi and conveys it to the primordial yang. Following the seasonal nodes in its movement—whether advancing or retreating—all relies on the power of this chariot.

**Question:** What do *old* and *tender* mean?
**Answer:** They refer to discerning the state of the medicine when gathering it.
Peng Helin said: *"When tender, gather; when old, it withers."*
Master Ziyang said: *"When lead sees the rise of gui, gather at once; when gold meets the full moon’s distance, it is no longer fit to taste."*
Such is the case.

**Question:** What do *floating* and *sinking* mean?
**Answer:** Lead floats while silver sinks.

**Question:** What do *clear* and *turbid* mean?
**Answer:** Yin is turbid while yang is clear. The clear floats above, the turbid sinks below; in refining the elixir, one retains the clear and discards the turbid. These belong to yin.

**Question:** What is the mutual overcoming of the Five Phases?
**Answer:** The *Scripture of Gold and Azure* states: *"Metal and wood contend, water and fire overcome each other. When earth flourishes in the domain of metal, the three substances perish together. The four seas converge, bringing about great peace—all through the power of the central palace’s earth virtue."*

**Question:** What does *coming and going* mean?
**Answer:** From *zi* it goes, to *wu* it comes—yin tally and yang fire. From *zi*, the tally advances to *chen* and *si*; from *wu*, the tally retreats to *xu* and *hai*. Beginning with *fu* and ending with *kun*, all are governed by the trigrams’ images. One wanes, one waxes; one goes, one comes, thus completing its transformations.
The *Book of Changes* says: *"Closing the door is called kun; opening the door is called qian. One closing and one opening is called change; ceaseless coming and going is called penetration."*

**Question:** What do *female* and *male* mean?
**Answer:** The female is yin, the male is yang. *"One yin and one yang is called the Dao; solitary yin or solitary yang cannot generate on their own."*
The *Token for the Agreement of the Three* says: *"Female and male intermingle, seeking their kind."*
The commentary states: *"The male is metal and cinnabar; the female is fire and mercury. They mutually require and unite, gathering by kind to generate and form the divine medicine."*

**Question:** What is *guarding against danger*?
**Answer:** It means preventing errors in fire timing and avoiding confusion in dreams and sleep.
Master Cuixu said: *"Essence arises at its time; when the time comes, the spirit knows. Within the hundred moments, one must never fall into confusion."*

**Question:** What is *union*?
**Answer:** Like a lodestone drawing iron, though separated by barriers, they connect in secret.

**Question:** What do *presence* and *absence* mean?
**Answer:** The *Scripture of Gold and Azure* states: *"Presence and absence mutually restrain; above dwells the Azure Dragon. The two absences stem from one presence—its numinous transformations are wondrous and hard to fathom."*

**Question:** What are *punishment* and *virtue*?
**Answer:** Yang is virtue, and virtue brings forth the birth of the myriad things; yin is punishment, and punishment brings forth the death of the myriad things. Thus, in the second month, yang contains yin, and the elm’s pods fall—symbolizing how metal and cinnabar follow yin’s movement, settling into the womb. This is called *returning to the root*. In the eighth month, yin contains yang, and shepherd’s purse and wheat sprout—symbolizing how metal and water follow yang’s nurturing fluids within the crucible. Thus, *mao* and *you* are where punishment and virtue contend, yin and yang balance, and so the tally and fire rest.

**Question:** What do *black* and *white* mean?
**Answer:** The *Token for the Agreement of the Three* says: *"Know the white, guard the black, and the numinous brightness will come of itself."*
The white is metal; the black is water. Taking the root of metal and water as the foundation of the medicine!

**Question:** What do *cold* and *heat* mean?
**Answer:** Master Zhenyi said: *"Do not wait for wind and rain to be unseasonable, or drought and flood to contend. Whether yang fire is timely or yin tally misses its moment—freezing winter turning to scorching heat, blazing summer reversing to thick frost—if the fire timing errs, the numinous mercury will flee. Those who tend the fire must be vigilant!"*

**Question:** What do *new moon* and *dark moon* mean?
**Answer:** The *Token for the Agreement of the Three* says: *"Between the dark and new moon, the tally aligns with the central path."* This is the moment when metal and water tally unite.

**Question:** What is *sealing and securing*?
**Answer:** The Supreme Perfected said: *"Seal and secure the womb so it does not leak; transformation occurs in an instant."* This means that when water and fire achieve harmony, the spirit chamber must be closed and guarded to prevent any leakage.

**Question:** What is the *Sacred Embryo*?
**Answer:** From formlessness, form arises—thus the Sacred Embryo is knit. Diligently nurture and protect it for ten months, like a young woman’s first conception, or a young dragon tending its pearl. For the spirit and qi have only just congealed, and carelessness can easily lead to loss.

**Question:** What are the *Four Directions*?

**Answer:** Zi, Wu, Mao, and You are the Four Directions; the Mysterious Pass, a single aperture, is the palace of the Four Directions.

**Question:** Where is the Yellow Court located?
**Answer:** Above the bladder, below the spleen, before the kidneys, to the left of the liver, and to the right of the lungs.

**Question:** What are the Golden Crow and Jade Hare?
**Answer:** The crow in the sun corresponds to the fluid in the heart; the hare in the moon corresponds to the qi in the kidneys.

**Question:** What is *refining the form*?
**Answer:** Refining the form transforms it into qi; refining qi transforms it into spirit; refining the spirit unites it with the Dao/Way. The Master of the Golden Grotto said: *"Refine the form with essence—this is no ordinary cinnabar or stone."*

**Question:** Why did Zhang Ziyang say the heart and kidneys are not Kan and Li?
**Answer:** The heart and kidneys are merely the substance of Kan and Li; they possess both substance and function.

**Question:** What are their functions?
**Answer:** The Heavenly Heart is the function of the heart, belonging to Li; the form is the function of the kidneys, belonging to Kan. At the moment of union, these functions are employed.

**Question:** What is the *practice*?
**Answer:** Know the time to unite, advance the fire while guarding against danger, engage in "wild battle" when yang arises, apply the balance of punishment and virtue in "bathing," and thus nurture the elixir to completion.

**Question:** What is *wild battle*?
**Answer:** The *Classic of Dragon and Tiger* states: *"Civil means embrace and pacify; martial means suppress rebellion."* Ziyang said: *"Defend the city, wage wild battle—know fortune and misfortune; once refined, the numinous cinnabar fills the crucible with crimson."*

**Question:** What is *warm nurturing*?
**Answer:** Xinglin said: *"Warm nurturing resembles the cycle of stars."* Piling said: *"The golden crucible must always retain warm broth; the jade furnace must never be allowed to grow cold."*

**Question:** What is *smelting and refining*?
**Answer:** Smelt the golden crucible, refine the jade furnace. The oral transmission lies herein!

**Question:** What are *reward and punishment*?
**Answer:** The spring qi’s arising is called *reward*—this is the phase of yang fire before *si*. The autumn qi’s reaping is called *punishment*—this is the phase of yin tally after *wu*.

**Question:** What is *defending the city*?
**Answer:** Embrace the origin and guard the One, thereby congealing the spirit and gathering qi.

**Question:** What is *embankment and defense*?
**Answer:** Drive out stray thoughts and focus the mind single-pointedly.

**Question:** What is the *spirit hut*?
**Answer:** The nose. It is the gate through which spirit and qi enter and exit. The *Yellow Court Classic* states: *"Within the spirit hut, cultivation must be tended; breath enters the hut and flows into the Cinnabar Field."*

**Question:** What is *Taiyi containing the True*?
**Answer:** Guard the True One in the Heavenly Valley; qi enters the Mysterious Origin, thereby attaining one’s original Heavenly True. The superior answer states: *"The true Dao nurtures the spirit. If one can guard the self, even at the gate of death’s qi, the withered bones of seven ancestors will all reside in the qi of life. That which gives me life is the Dao; that which animates me is the spirit. Direct the spirit to guard the Dao, and with the Dao nurture the spirit."*

**Question:** What are the *Three Corpses*?
**Answer:** The *Central Yellow Classic* states: *"The first is the upper worm, dwelling in the brain; the second is the middle worm, dwelling in the Hall of Light; the third is the lower worm, dwelling in the abdomen and stomach—named Peng Shan, Peng Zhi, and Peng Jiao."* They delight in a person’s regression and rejoice in their abandonment of the Dao. The Upper Field is the palace where the original spirit resides, yet people cannot open this pass, allowing the corpse worms to occupy it. Thus, they are trapped in the cycle of birth and death without end. If one can grasp the original spirit and settle it in its true palace, the corpse worms will naturally perish, and the true breath will spontaneously stabilize. This is what is meant by: *"When one aperture opens, a hundred apertures all open; when the great pass is unobstructed, the hundred bodies all flow freely."* Then the Heavenly True descends with numinosity, and the spirit that is not spirit becomes spirit.

**Question:** What is *embryonic breathing*?
**Answer:** If one can guard the True One, the breath will not come and go, as if within the mother’s womb—this is called *great stabilization*.

**Question:** What is the *Jade Pool*?
**Answer:** The mouth. The *Yellow Court Classic* states: *"The Jade Pool’s clear water irrigates the numinous root."*

**Question:** What is the *bellows and key*?
**Answer:** The bellows is a bottomless sack; the key is a three-holed flute—also the device blacksmiths use to fan their fires. Laozi said: *"Between Heaven and Earth, is it not like a bellows?"* The *Treatise on Ascending and Descending* states: *"If one can emulate the bellows’ function between Heaven and Earth—opening to let qi out, closing to let qi in—then exhalation resembles Earth’s qi ascending, and inhalation resembles Heaven’s qi descending. With each ascent and descent, one may attain longevity equal to Heaven and Earth!"*

**Question:** What are the *Five Sprouts*?
**Answer:** They are the true qi of the five viscera. The *Central Yellow Classic* states: *"If you can guard them, the Three Worms will flee, and you will behold the Five Sprouts and the Nine True Qi."*

**Question:** What are *Tun and Meng*?
**Answer:** The *Pivot of the Dao* states: *"Kan is water. Its first transformation is the Water Marsh’s node; its second is the Water Thunder’s *Tun*, with its line residing in *yin*. Li is fire. Its first transformation is the Fire Mountain’s *Travel*; its second is the Fire Wind’s *Ding*; its third is the Mountain Water’s *Meng*, with its line residing in *xu*. The extraction and addition of water and fire depend on *yin* and *xu*; the twelve hexagrams’ qi are employed in the operation of *Tun* and *Meng*."*

**Question:** What is *gathering the sun’s essence and moon’s radiance*?
**Answer:** It is not the external sun and moon. It is gathering the true fluid in the heart and the true qi in the kidneys.

**Question:** What are the *inner and outer eight trigrams*?
**Answer:** The head is *Qian*; the feet are *Kun*; the bladder is *Gen*; the gallbladder is *Xun*; the kidneys are *Kan*; the heart is *Li*; the liver is *Zhen*; the lungs are *Dui*.

**Question:** When should one begin *cultivation and refinement*?
**Answer:** There is the work of the hour within the season, and the work of the moment within the hour. Piling said: *"To refine the elixir, one need not seek the winter solstice—within the heart, a yang is already born."* Ma Ziran said: *"Do not choose the hour to distinguish zi and wu; within the trigrams without lines, separate Qian and Kun."* These are all the work of the moment.

**Question:** What is the *form and appearance of the Golden Elixir*?
**Answer:** Its shape is like a pellet, its color like a red tangerine. The *Baopuzi* states: *"Large as a pellet, yellow as a tangerine, within it lies a fine flavor sweet as honey. If a śramaṇa obtains it, they attain dhyāna; if a Daoist obtains it, they transcend the mundane. Examine it, practice it—Heaven and Earth are complete."*

The *Yuanshu Song* states:
*"Have you not seen how resplendent is a single pellet of the Golden Elixir?
Large as a pellet, yellow as a tangerine,
Each person’s share is originally perfect and complete,
Night after night its numinous radiance fills the chamber."*
For each person is fully endowed, each is originally complete—
know then that it is not a thing of form.

Master Lü said: *"The Reverted Elixir is one’s original essence."*

**Question:** Where precisely is the *Mysterious Pass*?
**Answer:** It lies within the human head.
The work is easy to perceive, but the point of entry is hard to find.
Without a true master’s transmission—anointing the crown and bestowing the record—
all efforts are in vain!

**Question:** What is *True Emptiness*?
**Answer:** To return to the root and revert to the origin is True Emptiness.
Xinglin said: *"Without knowing the wondrous elixir formula,
one spends the whole day toying with True Emptiness."*

**Question:** What is the *method of application*?
**Answer:** Like the wasp’s incantation over the grub—
transmitting essence, conveying spirit.

**Question:** What is *spirit emergence*?
**Answer:** By guarding the True One, the true qi naturally congeals,
and the yang spirit gathers of itself.
For with the one heart one moves the various qi;
when qi abides, spirit abides.
Through long accumulation of power and fulfillment of merit,
one then regulates the spirit and exits the husk.

**Question:** What is *transcendence*?
**Answer:** *"Trans"* means to exit; *"scend"* means to shed the mortal frame.
All emerge through the Gate of Heaven—
the ancient sages left proofs of shedding the husk:
The Sixth Patriarch emerged from a seven-tiered pagoda,
Zhong and Lü emerged from a seven-story crimson tower,
Lord Haichan soared out the Gate of Heaven on a crane.
A poem says:
*"When merit is complete, one must exit the capital of spirit;
the inner court’s splendor must not burden the body.
Master the Five Immortals’ method of transcendence—
refine the immortal substance and leave the mortal dust."*

**Question:** What is *liberation through the corpse*?
**Answer:** There are five kinds of liberation through the corpse—
gold, wood, water, fire, and earth.
There are also those who, through accumulating merit and piling up deeds,
ascend in broad daylight.
At the end of Emperor Huizong’s *Venerating the Dao* it is said:
*"From antiquity to the present, those who ascended in flight number over a thousand;
those who raised their entire households number over eighty."*
From the *Zhenzhuo Pavilion*.

**Question:** Is the Dao of the Golden Elixir not also difficult?
**Answer:** It is not difficult. Those who awaken find it only simple and easy; those who remain deluded make it ever more intricate and arduous.

Master Apricot Grove says:
*"Words of simplicity need not exceed half a phrase;
the proof of their efficacy lies in but a moment."*

Master Emerald Void says:
*"The medicine is not distant, nor is its gathering hard."*

Master Biling says:
*"The imperial Dao is not complex—people merely obscure it themselves."*

Master Purple Clarity says:
*"A single word threads through ten thousand volumes of immortal scriptures;
but a moment’s effort yields boundless ease and joy."*

The Master says:
*"The initial effort is easy; what is difficult is to steadfastly guard the Dao."*
