**Annotations on the *Mysterious Pearl Heart Mirror***
Transmitted by Changsun Zijuze of Wangwu Mountain, annotated in chapters by Xizhenzi (Wang Sunzhi)

The young daughter of Cui Gong, Prefect of Fenzhou, styled Shaoxuan, served Lu Chui of Fanyang. Chui, then an administrative aide in Fujian, had built a chamber for her after more than a year of marriage. One day, she addressed her husband:

*"Though I was born and raised in the mortal world, my essence is that of an ordinary woman. In truth, I was once a celestial scribe in the Golden Gates of the Jade Emperor’s court. Each autumn equinox, I was tasked with recording the names of those in the Immortal Bureaus whose cinnabar sincerity had lapsed—most fell due to contamination. With three fellow handmaidens of the same palace, I lamented in silence the filth and desire of the mortal realm.*

*The Realm of Form and the Realm of Desire still allow gods and humans to engage in union when their destinies align. Yet as a celestial scribe of the Jade Emperor, I belonged to the Formless Realm, a body born of pure yang and refined darkness, utterly free from defilement or desire. I knew nothing of mortal bonds like marriage.*

*While recording lapses in the Immortal Bureau, my three companions and I sighed in shared indignation at those who fell through contamination. In our silent discussion, we resolved to be demoted and reborn as mortal women to experience the world firsthand. Our lament had barely ended when the Immortal Bureau rebuked us for harboring impure thoughts. Each was sentenced to twenty-three mortal lifetimes as the wife of a Lu clansman. Now, my term nears its end, and I must sever ties with you to still all longing.*

*I shall dwell alone, never setting foot in your domain. I have revealed my origins to reclaim my former name."*

At times, Chui heard voices in her chamber at midnight. Stealing a glance, he saw several women in ancient robes of faded silk, seated together, pointing at him and sighing. Their speech was in the celestial tongue, unintelligible to him, though their skin, hair, and garments glowed with radiance—save for his wife, whose light remained dim.

At dawn, he asked her, *"The true immortals of the heavens speak in the divine language."*
Pressed further, she replied, *"If you recklessly reveal this, we shall both face punishment."*

Later, she told Lu, *"Soon, the Most High will summon me. I shall return my spirit to the formless, resume my service to the Jade Emperor, and ascend to the Jade Clarity. Do not speak of this, lest you burden my parents with longing."*

Lu kept her secret, though he grew increasingly melancholy. One day, he said, *"The time draws near. To withhold this from my parents would be unfilial."* Opening a crimson chest, she took out the *Scripture of the Inner Radiance of the Yellow Court* and presented it to Gong:

*"Your daughter’s fate ends on the seventeenth day of the third month. Without the *Inner Radiance Scripture*, she cannot be protected. Yet even with it, her allotted years can only be extended by one cycle."*

Gong exclaimed in shock, *"How do you know my destined hour? A master of strange arts once told me of this term, but I dared not speak of it, though it weighed on my heart. What can be done?"*

She arranged three mechanisms, spread layered mats, and prepared a memorial of ten thousand repetitions. Invoking the Celestial Official of the Southern Dipper who governs fate, she bade Gong purify himself and plead for his life anew. Three crimson-robed figures appeared at his topknot as he sat, partook of the offered wine, and departed with the memorial.

From then on, her parents regarded her with awe, though she warned, *"Now that heavenly matters are revealed, I cannot remain long."* A month later, she passed away. When her coffin was lifted for burial, it was as light as air—only her cast-off garments remained.

Chui, astonished by these events, entreated his wife to teach him the Dao. She left him a poem titled *"Guarding the One"*:

*"The world has gates for cultivating blessings,
But no scholars who know the Way.
When the cyclical year Bing-Shen arrives,
Your destiny will align with the divine.
You shall meet the Master of Langye,
Who will unlock the meaning of this verse.
For now, you are not yet bound to the Dao—
The teachings of non-action cannot yet be spoken."*

A friend of Changsun Juze recounted: *"Xizhenzi (Wang Jun) was traveling through the outskirts of Shan when he encountered Chui. Chui recounted his wife’s story and consulted Wang about the *Guarding the One* poem. Wang read it and exclaimed in amazement, 'This is a secret principle of the celestial perfected—it cannot be lightly expounded!' He then composed an annotated version, titling it *The Mysterious Pearl Heart Mirror*, and presented it to Chui in the Ding-You year of the Yuanhe reign (807 CE). Juze, having heard this from Wang, recorded the full account in his transmission. Its profound and abstruse purport is fully set forth in the annotations."*

**Guarding the One (Poem)**
*"Attaining the origin of the One..."*

"One" is the potent designation of the Dao of Heaven. "One" is the primordial boundary of generation and transformation. It is the beginning of the flourishing of Heaven and Earth, also called Great Emptiness, Great Non-Being, Great Void, Great Commencement, Great Beginning, or simply the Natural.

Laozi, since the flourishing of the One is formless and cannot be described or named, forcibly designated it as "One" and termed it "Dao." The primordial darkness is the inception of Great Non-Being, from which the mysterious origin is generated and transformed. It is also called the Natural. The Natural is the mother of the Dao of Heaven.

Laozi’s *Scripture of Western Ascension* states: "Supreme filial piety may be called nurturing the mother. Constantly nurturing the mother, the body thus endures long." It further says: "Emptiness and Non-Being give birth to the Natural; the Natural gives birth to the Dao; the Dao gives birth to the myriad things; the myriad things embrace the One and thus take form. Being has Non-Being as its mother; Non-Being has Emptiness as its mother; Emptiness has the Dao as its mother; the Dao has the Natural as its mother." The Natural is the root of divine transcendents and the mysterious origin of the transformation and generation of the myriad things.

The *Dao De Jing* speaks of "attaining the origin of the One." Those who constantly nurture the mother abide in its wondrous function. Knowing the white, guarding the black, ever guarding without deviation, they return to the boundless. The white is the pure yang essence flourishing. The black within the human body is the darkness of the five viscera and the Triple Burner, called the divine elixir of the Nine Revolutions and Eight Essences. The radiance of the elixir resides in the muddy pellet of the Chamber of Essences.

When one nurtures it, it is also called the Eightfold Simplicity of true qi. Learned gentlemen of the Dao, having known the white, must guard the black. Yin darkness is black. At the outset of guarding the black, the darkness within the body resembles lacquer. Guarding it unceasingly, the blackness of the black gradually dissipates. When the yin darkness is entirely consumed, pure yang’s white brilliance shines within. At the moment of clarity, closing the eyes and withdrawing the gaze, one sees the five viscera and their palaces, and the thirty-six thousand blood vessels. Each blood vessel possesses a spirit, all distinctly visible as if illuminated.

The primordial spirit, clear and empty, communicates with the Dao. At the time of spiritual communion, expansion and contraction are free; sitting and standing, presence and absence, dividing the body into a thousand myriad forms—all are possible. This is the clarity of attaining the origin of the One, the supreme filiality of nurturing the mother, knowing the white and guarding the black, guarding the black without confusion, and returning to the boundless. Knowing the origin of the One does not betray humanity.

Thus, the *Scripture of the Cavernous Numinous Perfected* states: "Attaining the origin of the One, Heaven cannot be trusted, Earth cannot be trusted, humanity cannot be trusted—only the origin of the One can be trusted." The reason the Dao can be trusted is this: those who guard the One need only empty the body, void the heart, refrain from seeing or hearing, speaking or eating, and constantly guard emptiness and non-action, inwardly concentrating spirit and thought. This may be called skillfully guarding the origin of the One.

If so, the primordial darkness of the Dao of Heaven naturally flows into the body of the one who guards it, presiding over nature and life. At this time, one spontaneously senses spiritual communion with the Dao, transformation without hindrance. Having attained it within, words cannot exhaust its expression.

Thus, the *Scripture of Western Ascension* says: "If one can be empty and non-active, not desiring the Dao, the Dao will naturally return to them." Truly, these are the words!

Lord Lao spoke to Master Wen Shi, saying: "I contemplate this Dao, which originally emerges from the profound darkness. This profound darkness is the guarding of the black. The foolish do not distinguish or know, yet claim to recognize life. This speaks of the ignorant in the world, who do not understand that the Dao of Heaven requires guarding its black, preserving its profound darkness—profound darkness that is empty and void, non-active and quiescent, which even the strictest precepts and calendars cannot fathom.

Only then, within the emptiness and utter stillness, does the utmost resonance congeal to form the image of divine immortals. Yet the foolish of the world, believing they may eat their fill all day, idle their minds, avoid arduous cultivation, and concentrate their thoughts within emptiness and stillness, instead stretch out their legs to sleep, indulging their nature and desires, passing their days in dull oblivion. They claim that by not creating evil karma, they are cultivating the Dao, still hoping for rebirth in a better family, blessings upon their bodies, and relying on fate to attain the Dao—ten thousand out of ten thousand are like this. Such deluded fools deceive one another, yet only deceive and mislead themselves, willingly entering the cycle of birth and death. These are the talents of carefree, lowly ghosts, those who cultivate blessings and feign goodness. Generation after generation, their forms wither, their blackness dries up, their color fades, and they return to emptiness in death. Bound by their forms, for countless kalpas there is no end. Even at the moment of death, in the throes of illness and suffering, they blame the Dao for its lack of compassion—such is the portion of the foolish.

Those who are deaf and blind in the world—are they deaf and blind only in body? Such people, whose understanding does not extend far, mislead themselves and others—how truly lamentable! Do they not know that the wondrous workings of the Dao lie within the empty suffering and profound darkness, in the midst of bland non-action? Let the black of the *ying* and *wei* flow ceaselessly, as if existing yet not existing. Let the empty and void body be as if broken yet restored, as if dead yet reborn, as if containing the Five Agents—yin and yang intertwined, revolving and transforming, giving rise to the essence of beings. This essence of beings is the true image of the Dao, the Golden Flower of the Upper Immortals.

This is the time when, beyond the profound darkness, one transcends the world, making the heart profoundly still and settled, not attaching to anything while concentrating the thoughts—only then is it called attaining the origin of the One. As the *Dao De Jing* says: 'The breath of guarding the One flows ceaselessly, as if existing.' The only regret is that the application of guarding the origin of the One is not diligent enough!

Generally, those who guard the One must first transcend the world, entrusting their bodies to the pillow, their profound physical forms concentrating their empty hearts. Their bodies become like withered wood, their breath flowing ceaselessly, utterly still and unmoving. After long days of quiescent concentration, skillfully guarding the black, only when the black is exhausted within the body does one perceive the inner illumination of Heaven’s light. At this time, body and heart are profoundly still, in the utmost state of tranquil stability. Thus, the *True Scripture of Southern Florescence* says: 'From the great stability of the universe, the light of Heaven emerges.' Such is the sight of this person!

If so, the Dao of guarding the origin of the One is about to be accomplished. The 'universe' refers to the body that will shed its husk through the one who guards the One. This origin of the One, in profound stillness and quiescent concentration, after long days of stillness, the light of Heaven illumines within. Emerging from the shell of the body, withdrawing the gaze to inwardly observe the image, one seems to sense the primordial spirit congealing its form within the shed husk, truly like one’s lifelong countenance—only perceiving dignity and a return to youth! At this time, outwardly, radiant flames envelop the body; inwardly, one’s form divides into thousands upon thousands.

At this moment, the Most High exerts the mighty power of the Great One to summon, inscribing the name in the Golden Tower. Shedding the husk, one ascends as a guest to Heaven, proceeding to the Golden Tower to receive the scripture and be enfeoffed as a True Person of the Great Ultimate. If so, it is clear that the poem *Guarding the One* by Lady Cui is not in vain.

The teaching of guarding the origin of the One and non-action is fundamentally established for those of superior wisdom, those who thoroughly understand the Dao of Heaven—it is not something the deaf and blind can attain. Those of superior wisdom and great illumination, upon hearing the Dao, are able to sit upright in cloudy forests, emptying their bodies and voiding their hearts, concentrating their thoughts within the profound darkness to unite with the gate of all wonders. The true teaching of the Dao of Heaven is diametrically opposed to those who pursue worldly glory and competition. Thus, it must not be allowed to glimpse the path to Heaven.

The *Dao De Jing* says: 'Those who guard the One have forms that are empty and suffering, their spirit and soul in a state of vagueness.' Vague, yet within it there is something; indistinct, yet within it there is an image. Profound, yet within it there is essence—its essence is most true, and within it there is sincerity. This sincerity is the heart-seal of the Most High Great Dao, the Lord of the Jade Dawn. 'Sincerity' is the hidden name of the heart-seal. The 'seal' is the origin of the One, the primordial spirit, the Infant and Youth, the image of the Dao.

If people know the Dao of Heaven, model their hearts on Heaven, and use the origin of the One to nurture the Mother of the Dao, diligently and without laziness, returning to the state of the Ultimate Non-Being and No-Thing, the image of the Dao is born, the form of the Infant and Youth congeals the spirit—this is called the Supreme Image of the Dao, the Golden Flower Immortal. The *Scripture of the Inner Radiance of the Most High* speaks of the origin of the One as the heart-seal of the Most High. It says of the heart-seal: 'The True Person wears a golden kerchief.' These five characters are the heart-seal of the Most High Lord of the Jade Dawn. The seal is made of red jade as the tablet, with characters threaded in yellow gold. It is bestowed upon the disciples who enter the chamber. Lord Lao transmitted this heart-seal to Master Wen Shi, Yin Xi, who secretly passed it down to the various immortals and sages, not daring to openly reveal the heavenly mechanism by inscribing it on bamboo and silk.

Guarding this heart-seal is guarding the origin of the One—it is the gate to entering the Dao of Heaven. All the highest sages and lofty perfected ones have entered through this gate. This gate is the root of the Dao of Heaven, the origin of the Dao of Heaven, most high and without superior.

As the *Declarations of the Perfected* says: 'In the Former Han, there was a man from Mount Zhong named Zhou Qiye. He wore tattered old clothes, concealed his name, and acted like the wind, like a madman. He often sang wildly in the crossroads, saying: "The True Person wears a golden kerchief, beats the drum of Heaven, and enters the Gate of Heaven." The ministers and nobles of the Han heard his song and found it quite extraordinary, yet none could understand its meaning.'"

Only the Marquis of Liu recognized him as an immortal, and so he sought an audience in humble attire. Invited into a secluded chamber, he received secret teachings and was promised a later meeting at the Small Grotto Heaven of Mount Song. After assisting Emperor Gaozu of Han to success, the Marquis of Liu fled fame, abandoned his family, and entered the Small Grotto Heaven of Mount Song. There, by mastering the Way of Guarding the One, he attained the rank of Perfected Purple Yang.

According to the *Inner Biography of the Immortal Minister Su*: After achieving the Dao, Minister Su journeyed to the Golden Gates, where, upon receiving the scriptures, he rode a cloud-borne chariot across the vastness of the Azure Sea. Ascending Mount Yan to the west, he entered the Purple Yang Palace and paid homage to the Perfected Zhang Zifang. Zifang commanded his attendant maidens to open the Cloud Repository and retrieve the ten-scroll *Dragon-Treading Scripture*, which he bestowed upon Minister Su.

In essence, guarding the origin of the One is guarding the primordial spirit within the emptiness and stillness. As the *Scripture of Inner Radiance* says: "The primordial spirit is the heart-seal, the origin of the One." It also states: "The Way of immortals is not natural—it arises from utmost sincerity and unwavering focus. Turn inward to the hidden paths of the true within the true; the Perfected dwells within you, seek not your neighbor. Cultivate essence to nurture the embryo and transform it into spirit; retain the embryo and halt the essence to attain longevity."

Guarding the origin of the One does not mean forcing the body into hollow emptiness through years of bitter toil, but rather deep and distant contemplation, profound and abstruse. Moreover, the origin of the One has sentiment, the origin of the One has faith, the origin of the One is formless, the origin of the One can be attained, and the origin of the One cannot be seen. That the origin of the One has sentiment refers to the wondrous consciousness of spirit, enabling one to know the Dao of Heaven. That the origin of the One has faith refers to the stillness of nature that responds and communicates with the spirit of the Dao of Heaven. That the origin of the One is formless refers to its hidden transformations. That the origin of the One cannot be seen refers to the elusive image. That the origin of the One can be attained refers to obtaining the mysterious pearl.

Thus, guarding the origin of the One is the pure yang essence within the body, which, through resonance and transformation, coalesces into spirit. This spirit is called the "wondrous-wondrous," the true Dharma-body, bearing a halo of radiance around its neck, its light enveloping the entire body like a flaming pearl. As the *Scripture of Western Ascension* says: "The Dao of Heaven cannot be seen, yet it prolongs life and makes it manifest. People know that life cannot be long, so they use the origin of the One to guard it. If one’s life is united with the origin of the One as a single body, one attains immortality, endures with the Dao, and transcends life and death—not by receiving it from Heaven."

This passage speaks of those in the world who are adepts of the highest Dao, whose苦节坚行 and unshakable resolve endure. If they encounter the enlightened Dao of Heaven and receive the heart-seal of the Most High, grasping the origin of the One, then even in the most subtle and wondrous mysteries, nothing remains obscure. They may then reverently seek the teachings of a master, swear oaths, and receive the Dao. After penetrating the Dao of Heaven, they guard the origin of the One, accumulating merit and refining their form. Such a one understands the Dao and applies it daily, their body and mind brimming with vitality. They feel themselves regaining youth, their lifespan surpassing ordinary limits—this is called "knowing the Dao." By cultivating and practicing it, they attain the Dao, not necessarily awaiting the descent of a celestial Perfected as their teacher to guard the origin of the One.

As the *Scripture of Western Ascension* says: "Those in the world who know how to guard the origin of the One can speak of and comprehend the principles of Heaven, knowing all things." Such a one encompasses the vast and penetrates the minute, exhaustively discussing the profound origins of life and transformation, leaving no principle of Heaven unmastered. Those who practice the origin of the One can attain the Dao. How is this known? By guarding the origin of the One, dwelling in emptiness and non-action, concentrating their thoughts in the realm of stillness, and preserving their spirit in the depths of obscurity. Over months and years, the primordial spirit coalesces with the body. When this occurs, the primordial spirit becomes numinous, and this numinosity communicates with the Dao of Heaven. Once connected to the Dao of Heaven, one can sit and vanish at will, divide the body into a thousand or ten thousand, and move freely between existence and non-existence—such a practitioner attains the Dao.

The origin of the One is pure essence, the formless primordial qi of Heaven’s harmony before any sign appears, the root-spirit of life and transformation. Yet guarding the origin of the One is bitter and tasteless, lonely and without expectation. Among later scholars, unless one is endowed with distant blessings, accumulated merit, and hidden affinity, who can single-mindedly guard the One, enduring hardship without wavering? The reason lies in the fact that guarding the origin of the One requires profound contemplation in obscurity, stillness, and tranquility, with the heart unattached to things, neither seeing nor hearing, neither eating nor speaking—only extinguishing the moving mind while preserving the illuminating nature. Thus, knowing how to guard the origin of the One is not difficult; practicing it is arduous, for its tastelessness runs counter to the worldly heart.

The hearts of the world are all drawn to the methods of action, prizing the flavors of doing. Thus, they become entangled in the sweetness of the mundane and enter the cycle of death and rebirth. As the *Dao De Jing* says: "The Dao of Heaven is impartial; it bestows only upon the good." The "good" here are not merely those who practice the Five Constants, but those born into bodies of complete blessing, perfect in every virtue. Such a "perfectly good" person is virtuous in talent, in earthly station, in intelligence, in appearance, in wisdom, and in conduct. They conceal their brilliance, hide their beginnings, inwardly store silent understanding, and outwardly embody benevolence and virtue. These good ones value governing the self and disdain governing the world; they are stalwart and transcendent, true great ones.

When they advance, the world looks up to them, their rank and emoluments reach the highest, their power sways the capital, and they assist the king in governing the realm, bringing about great peace. When they retreat, they wander freely in the forests and clouds, delighting in the Dao of Heaven, and descend celestial Perfected as their teachers and friends. Among those who can be likened to such perfectly good immortals are the Han Chancellor, the Marquis of Liu; the Yue Chancellor, Fan Li; the Wu Crown Prince’s Tutor, Wei Boyang; the Song Crown Prince’s Tutor, Tao Hongjing; the Eastern Jin Left Cavalier Attendant-in-Ordinary, Ge Zhichuan; the Prince’s Household Provost, Xu Yufu; and the Tang Censor-in-Chief, Tang Ruoshui. All of them abandoned the world as if discarding worn shoes, left their families for the forests and clouds, sought masters and traveled afar, never to return, ascending to the ranks of the highest immortals.

From the Zhou, Qin, Han, and Wei dynasties onward, those who attained goodness are too numerous to record; here, we merely cite a few as exemplars. Those below the rank of the truly good cannot, through forced cultivation, master the primordial Dao of guarding the One and thereby immediately ascend as divine immortals. Why is this? Because from the moment of conception, when their primordial qi was received in the womb, their vital qi was incomplete—absorbing more perverse qi and less upright qi. Naturally, their wisdom is shallow, their discernment superficial; deceit and aggression are their nature. Their karmic retribution is uneven, and their hearts, led astray by desire, readily plunge into calamity. Though they may hear of the celestial Dao, they waver between belief and doubt. Even if some believe and strive to cultivate, their efforts are strained, for their yang qi must wage constant battle, and perverse qi does not yield. If they cannot prevail through force, they willingly endure the cycles of death and rebirth, forever sinking in the bitter sea, abandoning the Way of divine immortality—this cannot be.

Those of perfect goodness, whose blessings flow deep and far, whose karmic rewards are profound, do not attain such fortune by chance. From their meager allotment of fate, they struggle to cultivate and transform their lives, accumulating merit through successive incarnations, gradually sowing the seeds of their reward. The gateway to forced cultivation of merit lies in amassing virtue, piling up benevolence, showing compassion toward all things, aiding the Dao in saving lives, assisting kings in governing the realm, and tilling the heart to sow blessings. Through the accumulation of hidden merits and the binding of past affinities, blessings gradually coalesce.

Though one may speak of knowing the primordial One, this is not bestowed by Heaven without cause—it is no accident. Rather, it stems from the cultivation of the Dao, the sowing of merit, and the accumulation of benevolence by past generations, which extends to their descendants. For instance, during the Xingning era of the Eastern Jin, seventy-seven celestial Perfected and highest immortals descended upon Yang Xi. The Perfected, in their tranquil chamber, and Attendant-in-Ordinary Xu—Yang’s disciple—communed with the celestial Perfected through his master. Xu inquired about the gateway for those yet uninitiated into immortality, seeking a path to tread. He asked the Pure Numinous Perfected Pei: *"By what gateway do worldly people enter the study of the Dao?"* Perfected Pei replied: *"In brief, it is a matter of fate and allotment."* Xu asked: *"How does one attain such fate and allotment?"* Pei answered: *"Through hidden virtue and establishing humaneness."*

Xu then asked: *"From what scripture do hidden virtue and humaneness derive?"* Pei replied: *"From the *Supreme Clarity Scripture on Dispelling Demons*, which has not yet descended to the world. It is called ‘Tilling the Heart to Sow Blessings and Ascend as Immortal.’ For every thousand acts of hidden virtue performed, one descendant attains the Dao. For every five hundred, one grandchild attains the Dao. This is what is meant by inheriting the residual blessings of hidden virtue from ancestors, which flow to descendants."*

Yet even when blessings coalesce, those destined to become immortals may find their seven generations of parents burdened by past transgressions, which entangle their descendants. Such descendants, hindered by these seven generations of sins, cannot pass through the Eastern Florescence. They must first inherit their ancestors’ residual blessings, encounter a sage master of luminous virtue, and receive the primordial One. Furthermore, each year at the autumn equinox, beneath the stellar constellations, they must remove their caps, bare their heads, weep and wail, and pray to the Supreme Mystery. They petition the registrars of the immortals to absolve the sins of their seven generations of parents, repeatedly beseeching the celestial bureaus. Thus, blessings flow to descendants, and no sin—great or small—remains unforgiven. The souls of their seven generations of parents all pass through the Eastern Florescence, and their essences and spirits are reborn in the Southern Palace. Only then may the descendants attain immortality. This is called "tilling the heart to sow blessings and together ascend as immortals," with no delay or deficiency.

Know this: for later generations of gentlemen studying immortality who encounter sage masters and receive the primordial One, it is no accident. The Pure Numinous Perfected Pei told Attendant-in-Ordinary Xu: *"Consider your seventh-generation ancestor, Ying, who in his lifetime widely practiced hidden virtue, sacrificing his own interests to aid others. During heavy snowfalls, he scattered grain in the long corridors to save starving birds. He divided his own clothing and food to rescue the freezing and hungry, preserving the lives of hundreds. During a great plague, when the dead filled every house, Ying personally administered medicine, saving 1,700 lives. His benevolent heart moved Heaven, Earth, ghosts, and spirits. Thus, the Supreme Dao and Jade Dawn Dao Lord inscribed your seventh-generation ancestor’s name on the Southern Terrace of the Great Ultimate. For this reason, blessings flowed to his distant descendants, and thirteen of your lineage attained the Dao—nine ascended as highest Perfected, and four became middle immortals. If this is so, why do worldly people falter in their resolve to cultivate hidden virtue? It is not that cultivation goes unrewarded."*

In general, for those pursuing the supreme Dao of immortality, if not for the residual blessings of ancestors flowing far and coalescing in their fate, they would have no means to encounter sage masters who instruct and transmit the primordial One. As for those of middling capacity or below, even if they hear of the Dao, they assume it cannot be forcibly cultivated to immediately become a lofty Perfected. This is because, at the moment their primordial qi was received, their vital qi was insufficient, their understanding unclear, and the battle between yin and yang left their perverse qi unconquered. Though they may steadfastly guard the primordial One, their allotment makes it difficult to attain the Dao.

Yet those who come to know this Dao do not do so by chance. If they recognize the Dao, comprehend its principles, remain unwavering in faith, and never falter in aspiration, even if their bodies do not attain the Dao in this life, their souls will temporarily pass through the Great Yin after death. There, they receive a karmic body suited to their rewards, allowing them to be reborn and transform. After three or five lifetimes, they will become divine immortals—no different from those who, in the mortal world, seek official rank and achieve it only after three or five years. Moreover, a single day in the upper realms equals a year in the human world. If one diligently practices hidden virtue, savors the Dao, and keeps the heart upright without wavering, they will be reborn in a family of complete blessings, becoming a perfectly good immortal. They will descend as celestial Perfected, befriend the highest immortals, receive their karmic rewards, and ascend from the human to the immortal realm—this is the extension of life.

The Perfected of the Great Elder and the Immortals of the Primordial Above—these are the True Persons to the left and right of the Great Ultimate, whose positions reach the highest and most primordial. The True Person of the right is titled the Jade Sovereign; the True Person of the left of the Great Ultimate is titled the Golden Flower Supreme Immortal. Should a person, after perfecting the Heavenly Dao of the primordial method of Guarding the One, be granted the rank of Perfected of the Great Elder or Immortal of the Primordial Above. To the left and right of the Great Ultimate stand the Four True Persons, whose positions fulfill the offices of the celestial bureaucracy, their ranks reaching the highest and most primordial. All arise from the material of the perfectly good and beautiful immortals, who guard the transformative primordial of the True One, congeal the primordial qi of the Heavenly Dao, and nurture the spirit to shed the mortal coil—thus becoming the supreme immortals. To draw a worldly analogy, it is like a scholar in the mortal realm ascending through the ranks of officialdom: passing the imperial examination with the highest honors, donning the official robe, and receiving the post of *xiaoshu zhengzi*.

The Jade Sovereign and Golden Flower Immortals, along with the Eight Perfected, are formed through the congealing transformation of the Eightfold Pure qi. The Eightfold Pure pertains to the lungs, which belong to the Metal of the West; Metal’s color is true white, and thus the qi of the white Metal of the lung-palace congeals into the Golden Flower Supreme Immortal. The *Scripture of the Jade Capital Mountain* states: "With embryonic breathing, the hundred joints grow still; when the Three are mastered, the Mud Pill Palace becomes a luminous mirror—thus is the Golden Flower Immortal formed." The world calls Śākyamuni the Great Golden Flower Immortal, for the space between his brows shines clear as a mirror. The master Śākyamuni received the supreme Dao of embryonic breathing from the Great Immortal Aśvaghoṣa, guarding the primordial One, so that the Eightfold Pure qi ascended to pay homage at the Mud Pill, the upper palace becoming utterly transparent, the space between his brows luminous as a mirror. The *Scripture of the Inner Radiance of the Most High* says: "Abiding in the Yellow Gate between the brows—this is no branch or leaf, but the very root." The root is the primordial One. It further states: "Between the brows, where radiant light is born—this clearly shows the primordial One." The *Dao De Jing* says: "When the world possesses the Dao, warhorses are retired to manure the fields; when the world lacks the Dao, warhorses are bred even in the outskirts." The horse is the hidden name for the Eightfold Pure qi. Each day, the Eightfold Pure qi ascends from the Golden Chamber to pay homage at the Mud Pill, within the upper palace of the Mud Pill—only then does it become luminous as a mirror.

As for the vulgar and ignorant, those called "men without the Dao," they daily accumulate thieving qi in the outskirts of the five viscera—this is what is called the "warhorse," namely the qi of rich meats and fine delicacies. Thus, the Old Master names it a thief, an axe or halberd that severs one’s own nature and life. The warhorse can rot the intestines and stomach, corrupt the viscera and bowels; when the viscera are corrupted, death is imminent. Thus, to guard the primordial One is to be called a "man with the Dao," for the Eightfold Pure qi ascends to pay homage at the Mud Pill palace of the brain. After the Dao is perfected, the space between the brows becomes luminous as a mirror—all through the congealing of the spirit in embryonic breathing, forming the Golden Flower Supreme Immortal and becoming the Perfected of the Great Elder. Their true rank is equal to that of the Old Lord. Only at the moment of perfection does one realize that Master Cui’s teaching of guarding the primordial One was no empty word.

"Light contained, shadow concealed"—this phrase describes the primordial One. One must guard the spirit with utmost sincerity, accumulate merit, refine the form, still the mind until it is no-mind, still the body until it is no-body. Within, one no longer distinguishes one’s own body; without, one no longer knows heaven and earth. When guarding the primordial One reaches this depth of quiescence, it is called "the body and mind in perfect tranquility." Over time, one sinks into the subtle and wondrous state of the formless and imperceptible. In stillness, the bones and flesh become pure yang essence, the yin qi within dissolves into the primordial true qi, which nourishes the primordial spirit. At this moment, one first senses the celestial light shining within, illuminating the shed body with a radiant glow. As the celestial light is contained within, the form and shadow vanish without.

The *Nanhua Scripture* says: "When the cosmos is at peace, the celestial light emerges—people see the person." The cosmos is the interior of the person guarding the One. This is knowing the white and guarding the black; when the black qi is entirely exhausted, the pure yang essence shines within. At this juncture of embryonic breathing and profound quiescence, the primordial spirit is concealed within the shed body. Turning the gaze inward, the form appears—clear and distinct, the true Dharma-body, majestic and luminous. This is the embryonic breathing that guards the spirit, the spirit not leaving the body, embracing the hun and restraining the po—thus becoming the supreme divine immortal.

The Old Lord said to Master Wen Shi: "I pondered this Dao, originally fleeing the vulgar and wearying of the world, embracing the primordial and guarding the One to transcend as an immortal." He also said: "I pondered this Dao, which originally emerges from profound quiescence." Profound quiescence is knowing the white and guarding the black. At first, when guarding the black, the body is dark as lacquer; if one persists without cease, the yang light begins to brighten. After guarding the black for three years, merit is accomplished and the form is distinguished—one’s body never perishes, becoming a long-lived divine immortal.

In general, when a person first receives qi and assumes form, the body already contains the two qi of yin and yang. With these two qi in the body, the natural shadow of the form is divided without. Thus, the celestial Perfected have no form, and ghostly beings have no shadow—because their bodies are pure yang or pure yin qi. These are formless forms. Pure yin and pure yang are formless forms, and thus no shadow can be divided from them. The celestial Perfected are formed through the congealing transformation of pure yang primordial qi into the primordial spirit; the Golden Flower Supreme Immortal is a formless form, the wondrous color of the true suchness of the Dao’s image. Ghostly beings are those who, in the course of life, drift toward death, step by step returning to the realm of death, congealing into the pure yin po to form a primordial form—this is called a ghost.

In general, the body of a mortal contains both yin and yang qi, and within the natural lifespan, the officials of yin and yang together record its merits and transgressions. If a person does not know the primordial One, they are fated to be consumed by the pure yin death-qi, depleting the celestial harmony and primordial true qi within the body. When the yin po congeals into form, it is called a ghostly being.

Ghostly beings, having congealed into form, emerge from the dead corpse. The netherworld dispatches ghosts to seize and escort them directly to the Six Heavens of Dengdu, where they undergo service, examination, and punishment. When the time comes for their departure, the yang officials, finding their yang qi entirely depleted, no longer claim jurisdiction; thus, they are handed over to the netherworld, bound for the ghostly path.

As the *Chongxu Zhenjing* states: "In ancient times, the dead were called *guiren* (those who have returned)." The living are but *xingren* (wayfarers), for they step by step walk toward that realm of death. During their time in the world, they exhaust their spirit and toil their minds, refusing even a moment’s rest, until in an instant their bodies turn to mud. The scripture says: "Men take sensual pleasures—form, sound, and flavor—as the highest joy, unaware that these are the very roots of calamity." For form, sound, and flavor silently wither one’s years and corrode the viscera; those who indulge in them race toward death.

Guangchengzi burned away the Five Poisons—namely, the five flavors—so that when the five flavors are exhausted, one may attain longevity, which is the preservation of the primordial One. The pure yang qi incinerates the five yin perverse qi; one must neither drink nor eat, neither see nor hear, abiding in stillness and detachment. If one does so, the five flavors will have no cause to rot the viscera and stomach, and thus one may attain longevity. But if one surrenders to the transformations of the Four Great Elements and the decay of the five flavors, life becomes subject to external forces.

Thus, the *Chongxu Zhenjing* says: "In human life, the great transformations are four. Heaven and earth shift imperceptibly—who perceives it?" Infancy, youth, old age, and death—these are the four great transformations of human life. The great transformations follow the waxing and waning of heaven’s seasons. When beings receive life, they are endowed with the primordial harmony of the Dao’s qi, which congeals into the form of infancy. Infancy corresponds to spring, for the harmonious qi of spring has not yet dispersed. Once the harmonious qi scatters, it transforms into youth; youth corresponds to summer, for the blazing pure yang scorches the blood and heat, depleting the qi and blood to become old age. Old age corresponds to autumn, when the body withers and decays, for autumn’s frost is stern and killing. As the qi gradually wanes, the last remnants of yang are extinguished by the killing qi, transforming into death. Death corresponds to winter, for it is the severe congealing of pure yin death-qi.

In infancy, the harmonious qi has not yet dispersed, and one’s nature remains close to the Dao, warm as spring. But in youth, desire burns fiercely, and one strives to enrich the self, scorching the blood with pure yang qi. Once the blood and qi decline, the body withers and decays; lifelong aspirations and vitality gradually fade, like the withering power of autumn frost that destroys the flourishing of plants. Though a glimmer of life’s vigor may remain, it withers in that moment, and the heart’s vitality is extinguished. As the killing qi suddenly invades, the countenance decays.

When the pure yang death-qi is exhausted and the last remnants of yang qi dissipate, the essence and po naturally congeal into a ghostly being. The yang officials issue a writ to the ghostly realm to take charge, and the netherworld then dispatches ghosts to seize and escort them away.

Most people in the world retain a spark of yang qi within the heart and chest, not yet dead, or a trace of yin qi within the flesh, not yet immortal. If one encounters a sagely teacher and receives the primordial One, guarding the spirit and nurturing the embryo with embryonic breathing and sincerity, enduring hardship to preserve the One, then the great yang refines the form, consuming all yin qi. Naturally, the bones and flesh fuse, the celestial light shines within, and the spirit congeals in the Crimson Palace. This is called the accomplishment of merit and the fulfillment of one’s name. The netherworld dares not claim jurisdiction; instead, the names of those who preserve the primordial One are reported to the Three Officials and inscribed upon the registers of the Master of the Dark Capital on the Mysterious Continent. The Master of the Dao then records their immortal names and announces them to the heavens. The netherworld removes their names from the black ledger of death, and the celestial officials inscribe them as immortals on the golden tablet. Their immortal names are posted at the Southern Pavilion of the Great Ultimate. Then, the Jade Dawn Dao Lord of the Great Dao of the Supreme Clarity dispatches embroidered-robed messengers to summon them to the Jade Capital and Golden Towers, where they receive their rank among the Three Clarities. At that moment, they shed their mortal form, ascend the flying chariot in secret, and proceed to the palaces of the famous mountains, awaiting the arrival of the escorting officials, winged guards, dragon carriages, banners, and the celestial music of the boiling heavens. Only then do they know their destination is the realm where the heavenly beings come to receive them—a transformation of nature itself.

When this single phrase speaks of concealing radiance and hiding one’s light, it refers to the spirit congealing within emptiness and stillness. *The Scripture of Western Ascension* states: "Suddenly assuming form, one knows this is not long life." From nothingness, the spirit suddenly congeals—when the spirit abides within the Crimson Palace, this is the bearing of a celestial immortal. At this moment, one knows oneself to be no ordinary being.

Yet there are foolish and obstinate disciples, those who turn from goodness, who neither comprehend the profound principles of the celestial Dao nor grasp the origin of guarding the One. They dwell in the bitter emptiness of solitude, neither speaking nor eating, neither seeing nor hearing, inwardly gazing and embracing the mysterious. After years and months, they may succeed in congealing the spirit amid the boundless dark, believing this to be sitting in quietude to await longevity, passing their days in fullness, their bodies reeking of filth, trusting to fate and the heavens to attain the Dao. Such mutual deception and delusion—claiming that refraining from evil and yielding to the course of life and death constitutes cultivation—is a grave error.

Those of this sort, how could they comprehend "form arising from the natural"? Instead, they toil ceaselessly in affairs of deliberate action, their minds entangled in a myriad of cares, their bodies wearied and their spirits worn. In ten thousand cases out of ten thousand, they cannot fulfill their natural lifespan, for their attachment to life is too excessive. If this is so, they remain bound to something, and even after countless kalpas, there is no end in sight—immortality can never be hoped for. *The Scripture of Perfect Emptiness* says: "Though these two phrases display brilliant eloquence, their words ring like metal and stone, shining like the sun and moon, they are of no benefit to the cultivation of the body." It also states: "That which is ever-generating has never truly generated; that which is ever-transforming has never truly transformed. It is merely yin and yang, merely the four seasons." Now, "form arising from the natural" is precisely this "ever-transforming yet never transforming."

The perfected of highest antiquity practiced the Dao by observing its return. They were ever without desire, and by being ever without desire, they observed its mystery. This is the origin of guarding the One, enabling the union of "ever-transforming yet never transforming." If worldly people do not know the profound principles of the celestial Dao, they follow emptiness and void, and from void and naturalness, their myriad forms inevitably return to earth. Their essence and spirit return to ghostly things; their essence enters the ghostly gate, while their bones return to the root of earth.

If worldly people know the celestial Dao and preserve the celestial constancy, they emulate the principles of heaven, ever acting to guard the origin of the One. Over time, they can transform and merge with the root of earth, their bodily forms dissolving and returning to the primordial qi of heaven’s harmony. Their refined essence and spirit, once transformed into ghostly things, now become the highest immortals—this is "ever-transforming yet never transforming," the congealing of spirit from emptiness, stillness, and nothingness into the moment of the natural.

"Ever-generating yet never generating" refers to the worldly pursuits of the ordinary mind, which exhausts the spirit and employs cunning, prizing the abundance of life’s desires. They willingly become prey to the myriad things that harm this life, thereby inflicting excessive injury upon themselves. In ten thousand cases out of ten thousand, they do not complete their natural lifespan, hastening their bodies’ return to mud and earth, their essence and spirit transforming into lowly ghosts. All this stems from over-nurturing life, self-exhaustion leading to early death. How could heaven and earth slay them? How could ghosts and spirits harm them? It is their own toil that wearies the spirit, their own fatigue that brings this about.

*The Scripture of Southern Florescence* states: "In nurturing life, one must first rely on things, yet when things are in excess, the body is not nourished by them." This describes those who have lost the Dao, who in ten thousand cases out of ten thousand cling to things outside the body that harm life, thereby injuring their own existence.

In general, ordinary worldly people, unaware that the celestial Dao lies solely in guarding the origin of the One and congealing the spirit within the boundless dark, instead succumb to desires that agitate their nature. The myriad things harm their lives, and step by step, they race toward the land of death, willingly becoming lowly ghosts. In such cases, their ethereal and corporeal souls are silently withered by the four great transformations, and their yang qi is entirely consumed. *The Yellow Center’s Hidden Talisman* states that the distinction between celestial immortals and lowly ghosts is the mutual overcoming of yin and yang—clearly advancing toward their respective forms.

When yin qi overcomes yang, essence and spirit transform into ghostly things; when yang qi overcomes yin, the ethereal soul congeals into an immortal. Clearly, they advance toward the differentiated forms of yin and yang. When yang overcomes yin, one guards the origin of the One in flavorless stillness, in tranquil purity, in effortless naturalness. When yin overcomes yang, one delights in things that harm life, pleasing the eye and gladdening the heart, thereby hastening one’s own death.

True peace is not sought; it is where the spirit lingers long. True peace is the origin of guarding the One, the primordial spirit’s embryonic breathing. Breathing embryonically within the Crimson Palace, one abides in continuous tranquility, resembling a woman with child—this is embryonic breathing. When the primordial spirit is about to congeal in the realm of stillness, it must rely on the stable function of embryonic breathing. This stable function lies in emptying the mind of the body, which is called "externalizing the body while preserving one’s essence," allowing the radiance of the spirit to remain. How could one employ clever mechanisms in this process?

The true embryo’s peace depends solely on congealing thought within, allowing the primordial spirit to linger long. For one who guards the One, thoughts congeal in profound obscurity, embryonic breathing continues unbroken, and once the spirit is firmly congealed without movement, this is called "the body’s bell of supreme stability." Here, the spirit lingers long—if the spirit does not leave the body, it can endure as long as the celestial Dao, enabling the preservation of the spirit for eternity.

Lord Lao told Master Wen Shi: "If one can retain the spirit within the body, neither seeing nor hearing, neither speaking nor eating, inwardly knowing and embracing the mysterious, then over months and years, the spirit will linger long. Only when it lingers long can it congeal into an immortal. If the spirit does not congeal, how can one attain this?" *The Scripture of Western Ascension* states: "One who skillfully guards the spirit conceals it within the body without letting it depart, hides within others without revealing oneself. Only then is the qi of the celestial Dao abundant."

Thus, in guarding the origin of the One, one must constantly regard emptiness as the body and nothingness as the mind. When these two are practiced together—embodying the body of no-body, the mind of no-mind—one can guard the spirit. In guarding the spirit with profound penetration, body and Dao become one.

Thus it is said: "If you can know the One, all things are accomplished." Without mind, one attains it, and ghosts and spirits submit. When refined and beautiful, it becomes true—this phrase speaks of guarding the origin of the One, concentrating the mind within the Crimson Palace, drawing upon the harmony of yin and yang qi, subtly refined and beautiful. At the height of this refinement and beauty, the spirit congeals into truth.

Just as one seeks to congeal it, the qi of harmonious yang illuminates the entire body, like a lamp burning brightly, clearly revealing the primordial substance. Then, the qi of pure yin gradually fades into darkness, and when the light of harmonious yang encounters that darkness, the celestial radiance momentarily vanishes. Within the body, all is dark and obscure, its blackness resembling lacquer.

Lord Lao told Master Wen Shi: "Know the white, perceive the black, and swiftly sit in vigil." He also said: "Know the white, guard the black, and the numinous spirit will congeal of itself." At the time of darkness, one surrenders the body to the pillow, as if temporarily dead. This is when pure yin unites with yang, and yang does not appear alone. Only in this darkness can one be said to inwardly forget the body and outwardly lose awareness of heaven and earth—body and mind both merge obscurely with the Dao of heaven.

At the moment of this obscure union, the celestial bureaus stand stern, and the guardian officials of the inner realm vigilantly protect the body of the one who guards the black. A hundred evils dare not encroach. Thus it is said: "To see neither death nor life, neither severance nor completion, cast the body into the realm of death, and only then attain long life; enter the domain of annihilation, and only then endure forever."

Thus it is said: The immortal’s congealed form relies upon yin qi to coalesce, for pure yang—yang qi—cannot generate things. It is like a man who cannot bear children but must rely upon the womb of a woman to give birth. The Dao of immortals follows the yin and yang qi; when the two qi harmonize and become refined and beautiful to the utmost, the primordial spirit obscures itself in stillness and silence. When stirred, it comes into being; at the moment the spirit congeals, the pure yang and primordial harmony refine away the former body, and the wondrous radiance of the later body—the true Dharma-body—congeals of itself. This is precisely the transformation of obscurity into the origin of the true One.

When refinement and beauty congeal into truth, it is returning to the root and reverting to the origin, regressing to the state before birth. This refinement and congealing into truth is called the Golden Flower Supreme Immortal. Though still within the mortal frame, one may sit and behold a thousand million worlds, freely entering and exiting the realm of being and non-being, expanding and contracting at will, moving unobstructed in all directions. One may divide the Dharma-body into a thousand million bodies, traversing the palaces of immortals and paying homage in the upper realms. If this Dharma-body transforms into a great body, it fills the void, merging with the primordial qi of the celestial Dao as one, encompassing heaven and earth and extending to a thousand million worlds—all as if observing the palm of one’s hand. Even the great and small kalpas of the ninety-six yang cycles pass as swiftly as morning and evening.

If this Dharma-body transforms into a small body, it becomes smaller than a mote of dust, yet within that mote, it can contain infinite worlds. All these are the divine powers attained after mastering the origin of the One—penetrating the Dao, transforming without hindrance, freely expanding and contracting.

For those who guard the One, from the very moment of receiving form and entering the womb, the primordial spirit and physical essence are fundamentally empty. The spirit was originally unobstructed by the Dao, untouched by things. Yet after receiving form in the womb, qi accumulates and blood gathers to create this obstructed fleshly body. Once born into the world, one drifts daily farther from the celestial Dao, step by step approaching the land of death. The Most High Jade Dawn Dao Lord pitied the people of the latter age, who knew nothing of the mysterious principles of the celestial Dao by which they might return to the root and revert to the origin, regressing to the state before birth. He grieved that worldly people willingly enter the cycle of birth and death, so he commanded his disciple Lord Lao to descend into the world and transmit the teaching of non-action and the Dao of spontaneity, like the sun and moon shining upon the human realm, enabling the wise to know of the celestial Dao and walk its path step by step. Thus, the celestial Dao appears vast and clear before the eyes of the world—this is called attaining the origin of the One, the Dao of the empty Dharma-body, the wondrous gate of spiritual penetration.

The *Book of Yingyang* says: "My body is fundamentally empty; my spirit is fundamentally unobstructed. With the mind free of hindrance, all is free of hindrance." Truly, these are the ultimate words!

The celestial Dao is non-action, and the teaching of spontaneity is the method of emptying the body and the gate of emptying the spirit. When the gate is empty and the spirit penetrates, merging with the Dao as one, one can then encompass heaven and earth, enter the tiniest mote of dust, sit or stand at will, appear or vanish without trace, expand and contract freely—there is nothing that can or cannot be done. All this arises from attaining the origin of the One, refining and congealing into truth, the wondrous workings of the celestial Dao.

**Of pliable and unyielding natures.**
This phrase speaks of attaining the origin of the One, refining and congealing into truth, and after the Dao is accomplished, the liberated body is the wondrous Dharma-body of formlessness, the true Dharma-body, capable of both hardness and softness. When soft, it cannot be grasped even in the hand; when hard, it penetrates metal and stone. The *Scripture of Western Ascension* says: "Nothing in the world is softer or weaker than qi; nothing is softer or weaker than the Dao." The reason qi is soft and weak is that it penetrates all things, and nothing does not encompass it—it envelops heaven and earth. Thus it is said: The image of the Dao is formless, emerging from being and entering non-being, spiritually penetrating and transforming, freely expanding and contracting. Therefore, nothing in heaven and earth is softer or weaker than the nature of the Dao’s image.

**The Cinnabar Empyrean and Azure Void—companions of the Supreme Sages.**
The Cinnabar Empyrean and Azure Void are the domains of the Golden Towers and Jade Clarity, where the Celestial Emperors and Dao Lords reside, along with the Three Clarities’ palaces. Only the Supreme Sages and lofty Perfected may dwell and repose there. In the Cinnabar Empyrean above and the Azure Void within, has one ever heard of a long-lived fleshly immortal from the lower realms casually wandering there? Moreover, the palaces of the void do not bear even a goose feather—how could a fleshly immortal from the lower realms enter the formless realm!

Upon mastering the primordial Dao of Holding to the One and achieving perfection, one is ennobled as a Perfected of the Three Clarities. Then, the Most High bestows a celestial title, and with the ascension of the white sun, one is received into the Cinnabar Empyrean and Azure Void to consort with the Celestial Gods, Divine Immortals, and Great Dao Lords—not to be ranked among the terrestrial immortals of the lower realms. Those rooted in heaven naturally cleave to the heavenly immortals above, while those rooted in earth cleave to the earthly immortals below. As the *Book of Changes* says: "Things follow their own kind." High and low are of distinct ranks, and the steps of immortality stretch far beyond reach of one another. Their abodes, too, are beyond the reach of earthly immortals. After a hundred years, naught remains but an empty grave mound.

These two lines describe the moment when one who has perfected the Dao of Holding to the One sheds the mortal coil and is received into the heavens. Ascending to the Golden Towers and Jade Clarity, one is invested with scripture and appointed as a Perfected of the Celestial Realms. Now, when a Celestial Perfected or lofty immortal is about to shed the mortal coil and ascend, they do not stir the gaze of the world or leave traces for mortal eyes to witness. Instead, they vanish in silent transformation, concealing their radiance and hiding their form, or else employ an elixir or staff to substitute for their body as a sign of their departure. The body about to be shed is then borne away in a flying chariot to a famed mountain or immortal abode, where it is received with celestial protocol and an escort of officials. Only then does one receive the jade decree and assume office in the immortal bureaus.

Yet when this occurs, after a hundred years, naught remains but an empty grave mound. If one were to open the tomb and look, one would find only the discarded garments or perhaps the implements of a sword or staff left in place of the body. Many of the world’s foolish, lacking far-reaching insight, hear such accounts and waver between belief and doubt, saying: "I have heard that the gods and immortals of the celestial realms invariably ascend in broad daylight, riding clouds and dragons, with celestial music resounding through the heavens, departing in such resplendent glory as to astonish the world. Only then can one truly believe that the attainment of the Dao is no empty claim. How is it, then, that they are said to vanish in silent transformation, leaving no trace to prove their ascent? This is something my dull mind cannot fathom."

Master Xizhenzi smiled and replied: "Even the fleshly immortals of the lower realms disdain to have their forms mingle with the world of things or their words exchanged with the mundane—how much more so the true forms of the celestial immortals! Moreover, the paths to the Dao are many, and the ranks of immortality, high and low, cannot all be recorded here. Yet this primordial Dao of Holding to the One is the highest and most supreme of all. Upon its perfection, one attains the rank of Celestial Perfected and Great Spirit, rising beyond the formless realm to ascend to the Jade Clarity. There was once, in the Han dynasty, the Great Primordial Perfected Lord Mao, who studied the primordial Dao of Holding to the One under the Western City’s Sovereign Perfected Wang. After achieving the Dao, he was summoned by the Most High. At the moment of his summons, he reproached himself before the Celestial Emperors and the Lords of the Heavens, ashamed to depart in silent transformation. Instead, he expressly wished to stir the gaze of the world and be witnessed by mortals, intending to ascend in broad daylight with celestial music and an escort resounding through the heavens, so as to inspire his younger brothers, the two Lords Mao, to know the grandeur of the immortal Dao and to regard the world’s ministers and nobles as mere ants. This was to strengthen their resolve to turn their hearts toward the immortal Dao.

At that time, the two younger brothers of the Great Primordial Perfected held office as ministers in the Later Han and did not believe that immortality could be attained through cultivation. Thus, Lord Mao used this grand spectacle to awaken them, so that they might realize the dreamlike nature of worldly life and the true splendor of the immortal Dao, which alone endures. Yet Lord Mao’s shame at his own narrow-mindedness was unwarranted! When Lord Mao ascended, the celestial protocol and escort moved heaven and earth and startled gods and spirits. His story is recorded in his own biography and need not be repeated here.

Most people are confined by their ordinary perceptions and shallow understanding—how could they possibly fathom the ways of the immortals? It is as if one who measures only a foot’s length sought to gauge the depths of the vast ocean. Moreover, when the Celestial Perfected and lofty immortals look down upon the world’s striving and competing mortals, they see them as mere ants—how could such beings be worthy of either praise or blame?

Yet there are indeed foolish and base individuals who grossly slander the divine principles, weaving cunning schemes to pursue fame and profit. They do nothing but deceive and exploit, never uttering a word of truth, peddling empty claims to mislead one another. They bear the name of seeking life yet lack any true devotion to the Dao. They falsely annotate charts and records, squandering their wealth on alchemical gold, neglecting the cultivation of virtue and benevolence, and seeking only quick attainment. How could such efforts ever succeed? They truly harm life, incur sin, and forever stray from the Dao. If one were to examine their transgressions against the statutes of the *Laws of the Lady of Blue*, they would number in the tens of thousands.

Having never encountered a true teacher, they cling to partial and flawed methods. Where can one see the accumulation of profound merit? Step by step, they walk toward the realm of death. When their qi is exhausted and their form withered, their polluted bodies, though once in the bloom of youth, must return to dust after their beauty fades. Yet even at the moment of death, they still deceive their contemporaries, falsely claiming to have attained the Dao or to have undergone liberation by means of the corpse, invoking some obscure principle of destiny. In truth, no such principle exists. If one were to open their coffins and examine them, one would find only bones—where are the discarded garments, swords, or staffs?

**Precious Chapter of Holding to the One**
The Jade Clarity is formless, the daughter of the Celestial Emperor. The Precious Chapter of Holding to the One shares the same origin. Thus, it is appended here with the chapter that says:
The Dao is non-action,
Manifesting to clarify the Way of Heaven.

The heavenly principle and the correct Dao consist solely in the primordial—only the primordial is the return. Return is the eternal constant of Heaven. The *Daodejing* states: "The supreme Dao is primordially non-doing." Non-doing means guarding the primordial void, preserving spontaneity, knowing its brightness while guarding its darkness. Darkness is profound obscurity. Profound obscurity is emptiness, stillness, and desolation—attaching to nothing while congealing the empty mind. The *Nanhua Zhenjing* says: "Dismantle the limbs, discard brilliance, depart from form, abandon wisdom, and merge with the great thoroughfare." Only then does one inwardly make no distinction of one’s own body and outwardly make no distinction of Heaven and Earth. Serene and tranquil, one listens yet hears no sound, gazes yet sees no form—this is truly uniting with the primordial void, the primordial non-doing of the natural heavenly principle.

The *Dingguan Jing* of Lord Lao states: "Guard the primordial non-doing, and the natural heavenly Dao will follow." Yet when a single thought arises, it must be extinguished at once. Only the moving mind is to be extinguished, not the illuminating mind; only the empty mind is to be congealed, not the mind of existence. The *Xisheng Jing* says: "To be named the supreme filial is to nourish the mother-body and thereby attain longevity." Now, existence has the primordial as its mother, the primordial has emptiness as its mother, and the empty body is death. Emptiness has the Dao as its mother, and the Dao has spontaneity as its mother. Spontaneity is the root of non-doing and the transformative origin of the immortals. There is nothing it does not do—this is the mysterious principle of the heavenly Dao, uniting with the primordial non-doing. It is neither total inaction nor passive spontaneity that leads to death, but the attainment of immortality.

The *Neijing Jing* states: "The Dao of divine immortality is not spontaneous; it arises from utmost sincerity and single-minded devotion. Turn inward to the hidden paths of the true within the true—within yourself lies the true person, not in your neighbor. Concentrate essence to nurture the embryo and transform it into spirit; retain the embryo and halt essence to attain longevity." This is the "having" of the Dao. What is called the "non-having" of the Dao refers to things outside the body—jewels and treasures, sights and sounds, flavors and the myriad phenomena—all of which harm my life, plunder my vitality, and hasten my decline. Whether poor or noble, rich or base, one remains unaware that form and spirit are harmed by external things. All things that harm life daily lead one astray from the Dao. Why is this so? What have I not done?

The *Xisheng Jing* says: "The world takes sights, sounds, and flavors as the highest joy, unaware that they are the root of great calamity." Thus, the sage, knowing this, desires not and returns to desirelessness. Therefore, the *Yinfu Jing* states: "The myriad things and humans vie to control one another, leading to aging and decline." Lord Lao told Yin Xi: "The reason the world treats life lightly and meets early death is neither Heaven and Earth killing nor ghosts and spirits harming—people bring it upon themselves. They do so by clinging to form, moving excessively, and indulging in excessive vitality." Now, non-living surpasses nurturing life—this is the primordial non-doing.

The *Nanhua Jing* says: "One who understands the essence of life does not strive for what is unnecessary to life; one who understands the essence of destiny does not strive for what is unnecessary to knowledge." For those who cultivate the Dao and nurture life, one must first relinquish things. When things are in excess, life is no longer nourished. In the world, those who understand the Dao are countless—those whose actions fall short of their words, whose words exceed their actions. All can be inwardly realized, not grasped by mere intellect. The heavenly Dao is formless, profoundly obscure—it can be silently realized through the mind, not exhausted by worldly wisdom. If transmitted through words or oral instruction, it is but a fragment of the Dao.

The mind that profoundly comprehends and realizes the Dao is like a musician plucking strings or blowing pipes—subtle and wondrous sounds arise from the fingers. These wondrous sounds cannot be conveyed through words or oral instruction. When teaching disciples, one can only suppress the tone to sorrow—words cannot fully express it. What is knowing? What is realization? These two phrases are rhetorical questions. Knowing dispels intellect...

Having thus clarified the distinction of the heavenly Dao, one perceives its vast and luminous expanse—then limbs and trunk dissolve, keen perception and brilliance are cast aside, form and intellect are abandoned, and the mind merges obscurely with the Dao. This is called "containing radiance and concealing brilliance," "extinguishing progress and concealing inception." Having inwardly attained it, one firmly guards it, rendering the mind dark and without mind, the body dark and without body. Such is the person who daily realizes the Dao.

To realize emptiness is to respond; in guarding the primordial One, the body becomes hollow and empty, and the heavenly Dao enters the body. As the *Scripture of Western Ascension* states: "When a person can be empty and without action, the Dao naturally returns to them—this is called the person who returns to the Dao." Emptiness and the primordial respond like an echo to sound, like a shadow following form. Thus, one relies on emptiness to withdraw the body, on vacuity to empty the heart. The *Scripture of Western Ascension* says: "When the body is empty, the myriad things arrive; when the heart is without desire, harmonious qi returns." At the moment of realization, the heart does not cling to things but concentrates its thought—this is called "inwardly embracing harmony and tranquility," the mind merging with the primordial spirit.

Responding to the primordial follows no source; the heavenly Dao’s response has no origin. Those who realize it know not how it is so, yet it is so—naturally. As for the response of emptiness and the primordial: when the primordial spirit is empty, awareness of emptiness immediately communicates with the qi of the heavenly Dao. When the heart communicates with the Dao, it has attained it. Lord Lao established the teaching of non-action to instruct people in cultivating the Dao—namely, to empty the heart. To empty the heart is to merge the mind with the Dao. In cultivating the Dao, one empties the heart and hollows the body; when the heart is empty, the heavenly Dao descends into it. When the heavenly Dao descends, the primordial spirit becomes numinous, and the numinous primordial spirit communicates with the heavenly Dao. Thus, all obstructions dissolve, and nothing remains impassable. This is inwardly known and cannot be made clear through explanation.

When the heart is unobstructed, it communicates with the One, and all affairs are complete. Lord Lao said to Master Wen Shi: "If you can know the One, all affairs are complete." How much more so when the primordial spirit communicates with the One? When the primordial spirit communicates with the One, it is the primordial of guarding the One—accumulating merit and refining the form until the form unites with the formless, naturally merging with the qi of the Dao as one body. Then all affairs are complete. If the body that communicates with the One pervades the empty void, it can encompass a thousand million worlds, all contained within the great body. Transforming into a small body, fine as a mote of dust, within that small body can again hold a thousand million worlds. When spiritual penetration reaches this point, only then can it be said that all affairs are complete—such a one may be called a Daoist.

The One is the root. The One is the root of Heaven and Earth, the source of divine immortals, the mother of the myriad things. Heaven attains it and becomes clear; Earth attains it and becomes tranquil; the myriad things attain it and are born; humans attain it and become numinous. Numinosity is the primordial spirit communicating with the heavenly Dao. The One is originally the great Dao, the root of divine immortals.

Affairs are the gate. Those who attain the primordial of the One guard the heart-seal of the Most High. The heart-seal of the Most High is affairs. Affairs are the gate of guarding the One. Even if worldly people can understand the root of the One, without entering the gate of guarding the One, there is no gate to enter. Without entering the gate, they also do not understand the *Five Thousand Characters*. The *Scripture of Western Ascension* states: "Heaven and Earth are clear and tranquil—all guard the One." This is also entering through the gate. Thus it is said: "Affairs without affairs, flavors without flavors." If so, affairs return to the One and abide in the body of guarding the One. When affairs return to the One, the One endures.

These two phrases mean that all things are born from the One and return to the One. The One is the root of life and death, the source of generation and transformation. Only the heart-seal of the Most High is uniquely the gate of guarding the One, the primordial of attaining the One. When the One enters the human body, the body endures. Though it endures, one must accumulate merit to become a divine immortal and transcend the world. To endure is not to endure—it is provisionally called "guarding."

In guarding the affairs of the heart-seal of the Most High, it is provisionally called "guarding the spirit," not that one has a heart set on guarding the spirit. In guarding the Most High, one does not desire to have a heart, nor does one desire to be without a heart—one simply remains serene, preserving the upright qi, motionless and silent, responding only when moved. When the primordial spirit responds, it merges obscurely with the heavenly Dao. Thus the *Scripture of Inner Radiance* states: "Emptiness and nothingness, silence and stillness, purity within the void—make the form thus, and let it not be defiled. Soaring in practice and rest, entering the celestial path. Guard emptiness and nothingness, and you will endure long."

This speaks of the heavenly Dao—it lies only in guarding emptiness and nothingness. Though it is provisionally called "guarding emptiness," the Dao of guarding emptiness and nothingness first empties the body, making it like the clear sky. Let it not be defiled by food or qi—this is not speaking, not eating, not gazing, not seeing, which may be called the ultimate in guarding emptiness. One must also empty the heart and guard the heart of the One. It is like the human eye: the root is similar, but if even a speck of dust enters, the eye is unsettled. If a small matter enters the heart, the heart becomes disturbed. In short, to empty the heart is like clarifying a bowl of muddy water—if one stirs it when it is turbid, it cannot become clear. If the heart of guarding the One is disturbed, it is easy for the spirit to become turbid and difficult to purify. Qi is like still water in a basin—if one can always be empty, the body is without action, and the Dao of the heart constantly returns to the body. When the qi of Heaven constantly abides in the human abdomen, one naturally becomes a divine immortal. When divine immortals endure long, they may share the lifespan of Heaven.
