*The Supreme Secret Methods of the Three Retreats and Five Liberations*
The Hidden Earth Eightfold Transformation Path to Immortality of the Chu Minister—
The Method of Playing with Spirit to Exit the Body

These five methods all enable one to transcend the mundane and enter sagehood. If one enters through the first or second gate, one may attain longevity, rendering one immune to cold and heat. If one enters through the third gate, one may return to the origin and restore the primordial, so that even in death, one does not perish—this is called "longevity." If one enters through the fourth or fifth gate, one may shed the Five Phases, becoming neither born nor extinguished. This is called "knowing emptiness as non-emptiness, knowing form as non-form."

For all who attain the Dao within the five gates, it lies within the twelve hours: turning away from the external and observing the mind, so that the limits of destiny become boundless.

To practice *Playing with Spirit to Exit the Body*, first bathe and change clothes on a *jiazi* day. At midnight, during the *zi* hour, enter a quiet chamber, burn incense, and face south. Sit upright, clasp the hands firmly, and knock the teeth twenty-four times. Strike the Celestial Drum twenty-four times. Then, sit with feet flat, and visualize within the lower *dantian* a pearl of *qi*, one *cun* and three *fen* in size. The person within is called the "Infant," who suddenly departs from the *qi* pearl, ascending through the Flowery Canopy, traversing the Twelve-Storied Tower, passing the Two Orifices, exiting the Mud Pill Palace, and emerging from the crown of the head to stand outside. Thereupon, purple clouds and yellow mists swirl and gather to cover him. Then, step gently forward and descend to stand before the face.

Gradually visualize the Infant growing larger, as tall as a one- or two-year-old child, identical in appearance and features to oneself. Do not gaze at him for too long, lest external distractions seize your attention. Then, once more visualize ascending and entering through the Mud Pill Palace at the crown of the head, descending again through the Two Orifices, passing the Twelve-Storied Tower and Flowery Canopy, and returning into the pearl of *qi*. This completes one cycle; proceed as you will in walking, standing, sitting, or lying down.

Always regard *qi* as the mother of spirit and spirit as the child of *qi*; when spirit and *qi* do not scatter, mother and child remain together like a hen brooding her eggs. After a month, visualize the Infant as equal in height and size to yourself, gradually able to come and go, walk about, and speak with others. If you can then practice the Way of Embryonic Breathing and abiding in *qi*, your progress will be swift and your achievement certain. The success of this Way may also grant longevity.

Once this method is mastered, on a *gengshen* day, cast a large mirror five *cun* in diameter. Always use it to reflect your body, visualizing your form in the mirror as identical to yourself in appearance, features, and clothing. At the *zi* and *wu* hours each day, practice and refine this method until your form appears within the mirror. With continued mastery, both form and spirit will become wondrously attuned. You may then project your form outside your body, appearing in the mirror—yourself possessing a body beyond the body, merging with the True Dao.

**Corpse-Liberation with Bamboo Staff Method**
On the fifth day of the fifth month at the *wu* hour, take a three-*cun* segment of wood from a household of the five surnames where a fire has occurred. Face north, offer five portions each of wine and dried meat, and make this invocation: *"On this auspicious day and proper hour, I take the essence within wood and the star within fire, carving a likeness of my form. Clothed in colored robes and a crimson pouch, I offer wine and meat with sincerity. By your power, assume my name, transcend life and death, and together preserve longevity. Swiftly, as commanded by the Three Officials and Five Emperors of the Supreme!"* Recite the incantation seven times, then draw in three mouthfuls of northern *qi* and blow them onto the wooden figure. Hold the figure firmly and shake it, then return it to the crimson pouch.

Regularly visualize your form, speech, and presence transferring into the wooden figure. After three of your *benming* days, perform the ritual as before, and the wooden figure will naturally become spiritually responsive. It will then be able to come and go like a spirit. When the time of your destined death arrives, the wooden figure will substitute for your body and die in your place. This method grants invisibility, allowing you to evade the perceptions of humans and spirits, and renders you immune to harm by fire or water. You may pass through clouds and penetrate stone, merging with the True Dao.

The principles of liberation ensure that none of the Five Phases—Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, or Earth—can cause your death, and you will naturally escape calamity. This method is akin to the bamboo staff technique. To obtain a bamboo staff, on the fifth day of the fifth month at the *wu* hour, cut a section of bamboo from a dense grove, matching your height. Any type of bamboo, whether green or purple, may be used, but avoid polluted or inauspicious places to ensure the method’s success. Practice it as described above.

**Rebirth and Transference of Dwelling**
The great endeavor of cultivating the True must begin with extending life, preserving spirit, and consolidating *qi*; only then can one attain immortality and achieve the Dao. If, however, the body withers, essence and spirit scatter, and the time of death approaches, how can one attain the Way of longevity and enduring vision?

Alas! In the distant past, there were those who transcended life and crossed worlds. Yet in later ages, the shallow and base, driven by lust and desire, squander their lives and forfeit their destinies without awareness. Thus, the sages bequeathed methods for transcending the world, enabling later students to ascend beyond the mundane and enter sagehood, exchanging their shells and transferring their forms. By seizing the right moment, they abide perpetually in the ceaseless transformations of existence, serene and ever-present, responsive and attuned.

To be reborn, choose a woman who is pregnant for no more than three months, before the fetus takes form. Persuade her with gentle words so that she willingly accepts your rebirth. Ensure she is free of illness. Then, at dawn and dusk, visualize yourself entering the warmth of her womb. When the ten months are complete and labor begins, direct your spirit to depart through the Gate of Life at the appointed hour, leaving this place in tranquility and being reborn elsewhere.

This requires prior mastery of the method of projecting the spirit from the body, with spirit and *qi* undispersed and serenely preserved. Only then will you be responsive and attuned, with no risk of failure. Once fully realized, you will abide in clarity and stillness, free of regret. No method of transference surpasses this.

The five methods of liberation—sitting transcendence, standing departure, breaking the cycle, worldly escape, and evading death—are as follows. Within the human body, the Azure Dragon resides on the left, the White Tiger on the right, the Vermilion Bird in front, and the Dark Warrior behind. They remain close by and do not stray far. If you attain the Dao, they will ascend with you.

Then, with your hand, stroke your forehead three times and knock your teeth three times, calling upon the Upper Corpse Peng Zhi. Stroke your chest seven times and knock your teeth seven times, next calling upon the Middle Corpse Peng Ju. Stroke your waist ten times and knock your teeth ten times, then calling upon the Lower Corpse Peng Jiao. You dwell within my dwelling-place and must not wander far. If I attain the Dao, I shall align you with the mysterious, and you will naturally become immortals.

Knock your teeth twenty-one times and intone: Within my body dwell the three hundred and sixty spirits of the bone joints, the eighty-four thousand spirits of the hair pores, the thirteen thousand spirits of radiant essence, the twelve thousand spirits of form, the seventy-two seasonal spirits of water, fire, wind, and earth who guard and protect, the Envoys of the Great One, the Lord of the Great One within the navel, the Lord of the Red Child in the Upper Cinnabar Field, the Lord of the Numinous Perfected in the Middle Cinnabar Field, and the Lord of the Infant Perfected in the Lower Cinnabar Field. May you, my spirit-perfected, ever grant me a flourishing Dao, never allowing me to be foolish or deluded. May I always see clearly as in a mirror, my ears hear no evil sounds, my nose smell no foul qi, my tongue taste no foul flavors, so that I may ascend in broad daylight.

Now that my great limit has arrived, I rely upon you, my spirit-perfected, to each guard your post. When the incantation is complete, knock your teeth forty times. Then, settle the spirit and quiet the mind, visualizing within the Cinnabar Field a red qi issuing from the phoenix’s beak, a fire chariot emerging from the left flank beyond the body, and the left path twisting back upon itself. Next, visualize within the navel a black dragon whose mouth pours forth a water conduit, rushing beyond the body along the right path. Left and right intertwine, encircling the body like a mountain of fire and a sea of water, completely enveloping it.

If you can project the spirit to stand beyond the crown, simply gaze into the void. When the spirit returns to the body, neither exiting nor entering, the breath remains continuous and unbroken. Spirit and qi guard one another within the bodily frame. Should the two ghosts approach, they will see only the fire chariot and water chariot, like the Iron Encompassing Mountain. The ghosts will neither see nor know, and though they charge forth again and again, they will hear only great curses, leaping and dashing about in vain. Unable to advance, they will retreat. This completes the first cycle.

After seven days thus, you may again feel abdominal pain; proceed once more as before. If you can perform talismanic arts, it is best to summon and employ the talismans of the divine marshals and officials for joint protection. Within fourteen days, evade them thrice. This method is called the "Cicada’s Term." Once completed, they will not return for a full twelve-year cycle. Should you cultivate the Dao and practice qi within that span, the yin ghosts will retreat of their own accord. After three such cycles, your name will be stricken from the Registers of Darkness in the Southern Palace, inscribed instead in the Book of Life, and you shall answer to the Northern Dipper, becoming a true official forever free from worldly calamities, your essence merging with the Dao in perfect union.

**Metal Liberation Talisman**
On a *geng-xin* month, *geng-xin* day, and *geng-xin* hour, within a quiet chamber, burn incense, face west, and stand in the *ding* position. With cinnabar, inscribe one talisman. Facing due west, recite the incantation seven times, draw in qi seven times, and blow it onto the talisman. Pass it through the incense smoke, hold your breath to contain the qi, then take seven sips of consecrated water and swallow. The incantation reads:
*"Spirits of *geng-xin*, the White Tiger conceals its name.
Mighty virtue of the West, secluding ghosts in the nether darkness.
My body is fire—unyielding metal severs all spirits.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law and command!"*

Upon completing the incantation, draw in a mouthful of southern qi and blow it onto your sword. Your body will divide unharmed. Recite the incantation seven more times, then depart swiftly with the sword pointed ahead, without looking back. A thousand *li* away, no traces remain; others will see only a self-inflicted death. This is the method of Metal Liberation. You must fast with utmost sincerity for forty-nine days before applying this practice. Never let others witness it, lest the divine generals’ power be leaked.

**Wood Liberation Talisman**
On a *jia-yi* month, *jia-yi* day, and *jia-yi* hour, within a quiet chamber, burn a censer of incense and consecrated water before a lamp. Face east and stand in the *ding* position. Strike your teeth thirty-six times, recite the incantation seven times, and with cinnabar, inscribe one talisman. Close your eyes to contain the qi, swallow the talisman in one breath, then sip and swallow the consecrated water. The incantation reads:
*"East of *jia-yi*, Mars shines with golden fire.
The Azure Dragon bears the name—wood’s essence is full.
My body is the luminous metal of the Golden Watch.
Swiftly, swiftly, as exhorted by law and command!"*

After reciting, draw in a mouthful of western qi and blow it onto a wooden staff. Any wood may be used for this practice. Carry it with you daily—pear wood is especially efficacious.

Do not allow women to handle or receive it. After forty-nine days, stand facing the southeast and visualize the three *hun* spirits—*Youjing*, *Youjing*, and *Shenyou*—as resembling your own face, dressed in clothing like your own. Imagine them as akin to the pear-wood staff. Stand upon *geng-xin* ground, then turn and flee with the Dipper’s ladle, without looking back. Walk a hundred *li*, then call out: *"Youjing, Youjing, conceal my body. At my summons, swiftly descend with your numen."* Repeat this invocation, and the efficacy will manifest immediately.

**Water-Dissolving Talisman**
On a *ren-gui* month, *ren-gui* day, and *ren-gui* hour, within a quiet chamber, burn a censer of incense and follow the previous method. Stand in the *ding* position facing south, strike your teeth thirty-six times, inscribe one talisman, recite the incantation seven times, draw in a mouthful of qi, and blow it onto the talisman. Close your eyes to contain the qi, swallow the talisman in one breath, then sip and swallow seven mouthfuls of pure water. The incantation reads:
*"North of *ren-gui*, named the Dark Warrior.
Spirit of the Water Palace, Yellow Elder born of earth.
Earth’s Elder seated, guarding the water’s source.
Swiftly, swiftly, as exhorted by law and command!"*

To dissolve the method, stand at the water’s position, face the *ding* direction, recite the incantation seven times, draw in a mouthful of central qi, and blow it onto your shoes. Visualize the three *hun* spirits responding upon the shoes. Place them with the front facing north and the back south. Perform the *Yu* step forward and proceed without looking back—your trace will vanish for a thousand *li*. To dissolve on the same day, submerge the right shoe in water and depart. As you walk, call the spirit-souls to follow your body, and they will appear to drown in the water.

**Fire-Dissolving Talisman**
On a *bing-ding* month, *bing-ding* day, and *bing-ding* hour, within a quiet chamber, burn incense, stand in the *ding* position facing due south, strike your teeth thirty-six times, recite the incantation seven times, inscribe one talisman and swallow it, then sip and swallow seven mouthfuls of pure water. The incantation reads:
*"South of the Fire Spirit, named *bing-ding*.
I bear the Four Numinous Ones, where Mars abides.
Wherever my body goes, fire blazes to conceal my form.
Swiftly, swiftly, as exhorted by law and command!"*

Follow this method with utmost sincerity and receive it for forty-nine days. To dissolve, use a pear-wood staff and receive it for forty-nine days. When encountering disasters of blades and warfare, dissolve by holding a sword in your left hand and the pear-wood staff in your right. Stand in the *ding* position at the *kan* direction, facing due south, recite the incantation seven times, draw in a mouthful of qi, and blow it onto the pear-wood staff. Discard the staff into fire, then strike downward with the sword’s tip into the flames. Proceed with forceful dissolution, exhaling qi as you go—fire will be unable to harm you, and others will appear to perish in the flames.

**Earth-Dissolving Talisman**
On a *wu-ji* month, *wu-ji* day, and *wu-ji* hour, within a quiet chamber, burn a censer of incense, stand in the *ding* position at the *xun* direction facing southeast, and inscribe one talisman in cinnabar. Recite the incantation seven times. Follow the previous method, pass the talisman over the incense, close your eyes to contain the qi, and swallow it. The incantation reads:
*"Center of *wu-ji*, where the ten thousand spirits pay homage,
named the Curved Array, gathering and dispersing without hindrance.
I now transform and conceal myself within heaven and earth.
Swiftly, swiftly, as exhorted by law and command!"*

Here follows the translation:

---

For all applications of the above method, proceed as before, maintaining the practice for a full forty-nine days. When needing to employ it temporarily, hold the sword in your left hand, stand in the *ding* position facing due south, knock your teeth twenty-four times, recite the incantation seven times, draw a mouthful of your original *qi* from the stomach, and blow it onto the target. Then cast it forward above your head, and proceed with the sword, visualizing the Three Hun spirits. As before, let the Three Hun spirits shield you—do not look back. Even if summoned from a hundred *li* away, the Three Hun will depart and return, dissolving calamity should you encounter disaster.

The preceding talismans and incantations are all esoteric methods of seed immortals and must not be recklessly transmitted to anyone. If you wish to employ them daily, use cinnabar to inscribe the talisman, swallow one each day following the previous method. In a pure place where incense smoke rises, pray with utmost sincerity, pass the brush over the incense, and inscribe the talisman while reciting the brush-invocation:

*"Divine brush, spirit upon spirit,
I invoke the Supreme Clarity,
Six Jia guard and protect,
Six Ding attend in timely ease.
I now inscribe this talisman,
concealing my form within.
Encounter metal, follow metal;
encounter fire, halt in fire.
Hide within earth by the billions,
commanded by the Heavenly Sovereign.
Swiftly, swiftly, as exhorted by law and command!"*

When inscribing the talisman, first whisper over the brush seven times, pass it over the incense, and only then write the talisman. This is a secret text—do not transmit it to the unworthy, lest the sin extend to your seven ancestors. The Nine Mysteries warn you: beware, beware!

**Heavenly Robe Dao**
The Heavenly Robe is made from the first garment worn by a firstborn son on the fifth day of the fifth month. If unavailable, any garment taken on that day will suffice. Wash it with pure water and hang it in the northern shade. On the seventh day of the seventh month, wrap a bitter gourd within the garment and hang it in the northern shade to dry. On the same day, inscribe a talisman in cinnabar on a piece of crimson silk seven *cun* wide, wrap it together, and place it there. After one hundred days, retrieve it and keep it in your bosom as you move among people—none will recognize you. Guard it carefully, never placing it in yin-yang defiled or filthy places, nor allowing the impure to see it.

**The Two Concealments of the Supreme Radiance Golden Portal of the August Heavenly Emperor**

Long ago, the Perfected Lord of Grand Unity and the Holy Mother of the Nine Heavens descended upon Mount Kongtong and transmitted this to the Primordial Sovereign, commanding Indra to summon the host of ministers to ascend together to the Nine Heavens. They left this text to propagate the teachings in the world.

Those who wish to cultivate the Dao must first sever killing and deceit, cast off jealousy and envy, and abstain from the five pungent foods and three taboo meats. Other matters are not forbidden. Thus, the sages say: *"The supreme Dao is not burdensome; to understand the Dao is simplicity itself."* Whoever encounters this scripture will attain the power to enter life and exit death.

Long ago, the Yellow Emperor received from the Holy Mother of the Nine Heavens the *River Chart* and the *Taiyi Palace Ding-Jia Concealment of Form*. Once the secrets of the yin-yang configurations and the two concealment gates are known, cultivation will lead to the attainment of divine immortality.

**Yang Concealment Method**
*"Osmanthus seed person, ten thousand, ten thousand people—
hidden within the ranks, unseen."*

On the fifth day of the fifth month at noon, take one ox gallbladder and three fingers’ width of official osmanthus bark, two *cun* and four *fen* wide, half a finger thick, removing its protuberances. On that day, before the gallbladder, face the sun, recite the incantation three times, draw three mouthfuls of *qi* from the north, and blow them onto the osmanthus and gallbladder. Insert the osmanthus into the gallbladder and dry it in a quiet chamber, ensuring no one, no livestock, nor any woman sees it. After one hundred days, retrieve it and carve it into a human figure one *cun* and two *fen* tall. Powder the osmanthus person’s face, eyes, mouth, and nose, and after fourteen days, store it in a brocade pouch.

When using it, recite the incantation three times, draw a mouthful of *qi*, blow it onto the figure, and carry it into the ranks—ten thousand people will not see you. The incantation reads:

*"Supreme Yin, profound darkness,
conceal my form.
Clouds and mist shroud my body,
dual evasion of solar essence.
Swiftly, swiftly, as exhorted by law and command!"*

To remain unseen by many, place it on your head to become an old man; in your eyes, an old woman; in your ears, a young girl; in your nose, a burial mound; on your forehead or brow, a young brother; on your chest, a flying bird; on your back, an ox or horse; at your *weilu*, a clear stream; on your *shiyin*, a cave spring. When stepping forth, you may travel a thousand *li* in a day. To return, place it back in the pouch.

What follows is performed in accordance with the response. The *Yin Concealment Method*.

Take white poplar wood on the fifth day of the fifth month at noon, selecting uninfested branches. Gather willow wood from the northwest, shaping both to the same form, each one *cun* in diameter and three *cun* in circumference. Neither women nor mourners may witness this. Place the wood in a quiet chamber until the Summer Solstice, when a carver—having first purified himself—shall secretly craft a figure in a secluded room. The figure should be one *cun* and two *fen* in length, the size of a little finger, dressed and adorned exactly like oneself. Clothe it in brocade, then store it in a brocade pouch, which one shall carry constantly at the left side of the body.

On a *yi-you* day at the *chou* hour, rise, don the robe, face east, and settle the *qi*. Strike the teeth thirty-six times, then take the wooden figure in the left hand and recite the incantation:

*"Heaven is round, Earth is square,
I stand at the center.
The Great Unity commands me,
to conceal me as one.
Follow my actions,
come and go without hindrance.
Conceal my form in the world,
ever attend my side.
Swiftly, swiftly, as exhorted by the law and command of the Perfected of the Great Unity!"*

Recite the incantation seven times, then return the wooden figure to the pouch. Repeat this on subsequent *yi-you* days. After seven such *yi-you* days, the figure shall conceal one’s form.

When wishing to hide from others, recite the incantation:

*"Heaven grants me the mechanism,
you follow alongside.
You conceal, I hide,
lest others know.
Do not let them see me,
only I, only you.
The Most High commands me,
to instantly conceal myself.
Swiftly, swiftly, as exhorted by the law and command of the Perfected of the Great Unity!"*

Recite the incantation three times, and one’s form shall be concealed. Return the wooden figure to the pouch.

When no longer wishing to remain hidden, take the wooden figure in the right hand and recite the concealment incantation:

*"Heaven above is vast,
Earth below is boundless.
I hide within them,
moved by your companionship.
The concealment of form is most wondrous,
restore my trace.
The thought of the Most High,
do not act in haste.
Swiftly, swiftly, as commanded by the law and command of the Perfected of the Great Unity!"*

Silently recite the incantation three times, then return the wooden figure to the pouch. Repeat the method as before.

Here ends the *Secret Methods of the Three Retreats and Five Liberations of the Most High*.
