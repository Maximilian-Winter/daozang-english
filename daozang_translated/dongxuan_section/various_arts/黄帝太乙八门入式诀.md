**Scroll One: The Yellow Emperor’s Taiyi Eight Gates Entry Method**

**The Yang Hexagram Sequence Gate (逆干顺行)**
When the *Ganzi* (甲子) or *Ganchén* (甲辰) begins, the first gate arises.
*Ganyin* (甲寅) and *Guxu* (甲戌) emerge from the three palaces.
*Ganshen* (甲申) marks the sixth palace, *Gawu* (甲午) the eighth—
Obtain them in sequence, and all shall be auspicious.

Wherever you arrive, *Rest* is the head.
*Rest*—the Taiyi divine spirit’s abode.
*Life* nourishes, *Injury* obstructs, *Blockage* stifles, *Death* ends, *Opening* reveals—
This is the wheel’s order; do not neglect it.

Add *Wu* (戊) to the *Rest* stem for inverse movement,
Yet follow the Eight Gates in their proper order.
The enlightened shall not fall into the Three Realms,
For the Dao’s path lies within arm’s reach.

**The Yin Hexagram Inversion Gate (顺干逆行)**
*Ganzi* (甲子) and *Ganchén* (甲辰) depart from the ninth palace,
*Ganyin* (甲寅) and *Guxu* (甲戌) from the seventh.
*Ganshen* (甲申) marks the fourth palace, *Gawu* (甲午) the second—
Seek the Gates in their proper sequence.

From nine descending to one is inversion,
From one ascending returns to nine.
When the Gates align with the Three Celestial Odds (*Sanqi*),
The path becomes auspicious, free of calamity.

Add *Wu* (戊) to the *Rest* stem for forward movement,
Yet reverse the Eight Gates, and disaster follows.
This is the Gate’s true mystery—
The Blue Lagoon’s path is rare and wondrous.

**The Method of the Three Celestial Odds (三奇合门法)**
Heaven has three Odds: Sun, Moon, and Star.
Earth has three Odds: *Yi* (乙), *Bing* (丙), *Ding* (丁).
Man has three Odds: Spirit, Qi, and Essence.
The Gates have three Odds: *Opening*, *Rest*, and *Life*.

When *Yi*, *Bing*, and *Ding* align, fortune comes.
If the Gates coincide with the Three Odds, travel is auspicious.
The Three Odds’ path belongs to the Three Teachings;
The rest descend into the *Jing* (景) realm as lesser beings.

**Recognizing the Gates’ Nature (识认门户法)**
The *Rest* Gate leads to distant contention,
The *Life* Gate directs one to the Immortal’s realm.
The *Opening* Gate governs officialdom, seals, and decrees,
While the *Injury* Gate summons the *Asura* (修罗) demons.

The *Jing* (景) realm below is the path of human destiny,
The *Surprise* and *Opening* Gates invite ghosts to terror.
The *Blockage* Gate brings silence and stammering,
The *Death* Gate plunges one into hell’s boiling cauldron.

**Discerning Future Paths at the Threshold (识认前程临境法)**
When banners and flowers summon you,
You’ll be reborn as a donkey or horse.
When bells, chimes, iron clappers, and drums resound,
You’ll consort with dogs, chickens, sheep, and licentiousness.

If you see *Vajra* (金刚) or *Rakshasa* (罗剎) demons,
You’ll be drawn into earthly strife toward the Western Paradise.
If white clouds, tortoises, and cranes guide you,
You’ll ascend to the Three Pure Ones as a Heavenly Immortal.

If you ride the clouds and harness the qi,
You’ll return to the *Coagulated Egg* (卵胎) as a flying *Yuan* (飞鸢).
If feasts of Eight Delicacies and Five Flavors beckon,
You’ll become a hungry ghost, suffering cold and hunger.

If *Zǐjǔ* (紫举) or *Bái jǔ* (白举) summon you,
You’ll return to the human path.
If you follow beauty into the underworld,
You’ll be reborn with deformities, plunged into boiling medicine.

If wolves, tigers, and leopards appear,
You’ll wander into the mountains as a beast.
If arms, flags, and soldiers march with horses,
You’ll become an *Asura* of cruel and obstinate nature.

Only when all perils vanish before your eyes
Will you, in an instant, ascend to the Great Dao’s realm.
A single misguided thought must be avoided—
Do not cling to greed; observe with equanimity.

**The Method of Piercing the Mysteries (通幽洞微打当法)**
All mortals face the number of impermanence,
Bound by yin’s death and yang’s birth.
Yin is death, yang is life—
Yet birth and death in yin and yang hold no grudge.

If one awakens to the Eight Gates of the Immortals,
Within the Eight Gates lies a single path.
The *Blockage* Gate conceals the wheel of rebirth—
This profound method few may encounter.

When the divine lamp illuminates the moon’s hour,
Arrange the *dàdàng* (打當) with foresight.
Entering *Dayuan* (乾元) with *Li* (利) and *Zhen* (貞),
In meditation, return to the Root—no coming, no going.

Enter the *Blockage* Gate in seven steps,
Yet beyond it, no form is seen, no one encountered.
Without coming or going in stillness,
Thus, *Zàng* (臧) abides in the True and Perfect.

Abiding is coming yet not turning—
From this, the Three Realms’ path is severed.
Awakening to this is the *Outer World’s Person*,
Preserving the body, never buried in the *Blockage*’s seal.

**Pointing to the Root Essence (指陈根元法)**
Exhort the world to diligence and frugality,
To moderate eating, store wealth, and enrich the family.
Yet the enlightened do not follow this path.
They cultivate emptiness and tranquility,
Conserve essence, nurture qi,
Stabilize the spirit to solidify the Dao.

The Classic says:
*"Simply sit or lie still,
Clarify the heart, gaze long, concentrate the spirit—
Draw in and store the breath naturally."*

Again it says:
*"Close the *Dui* (兑) orifice,
Seal the Gates, and never labor in vain.*
*Dui* is metal—
Metal generates water and carves wood,
Internally corresponding to the lungs.
The lungs generate qi, qi generates fluids—
This is the *Jinye* (金液, "Golden Elixir").

The lungs again generate qi—
Breathing in and out, all stems from this.
*Mianmian* (绵绵) means subtle and unbroken.
Metal belongs to the *Dui* hexagram;
The mouth is *Dui*’s portal—
Close the mouth, store the breath,
Draw the pure qi to the *Xuangu* (玄谷) to prolong life.

From storing in the *Taicang* (太倉) to *Ren* (任) breath,
From *Ren* breath to *Ding* (定) breath,
From *Ding* breath to *Wu* (無) breath—
From *Wu* breath, the wheel of birth and death ceases.

Again, the *Damó* (达磨) *Táixī* (胎息) Secret says:
*"Diligently guard the True,
Do not indulge—
Internally, nothing escapes;
Externally, nothing enters.
Return to the Origin—
All affairs are complete.*
If you attain this,
Do not lose the True—
Extend life and preserve forever."

Again, the Immortal Child says:
*"Walking, sitting still, or moving—
Stillness and motion, sitting and lying—
None contradict."*

Again, Master *Guangdé* (廣德) says:
*"Sit quietly in a grass hut,
Calm the heart, replenish the Original Qi.
One hour of stillness
Can escape the wheel of rebirth.*

Those who dwell eternally in the world
Must rely on the Eight Gates to depart.
If one cannot awaken,
The path to longevity and immortality is lost."

**The Laws of Departure and Abode (出入去住法)**
Ah, humanity dwells between Heaven and Earth—
Who knows their birthdays, who knows their death hours?
Only the Sage comprehends this.

The beings of *Nányánfú* (南阎浮提) know birth but not death,
Bound in the wheel of rebirth since beginningless time,
Unable to escape the *Death Gate* until today.

Now encountering the *Taiyi Eight Gates*,
Meeting a superior adept,
With clear instructions and understanding of inversion and sequence,
Mastering yin and yang’s principles,
Recognizing the four seasons and eight nodes,
Deciphering the wheel of *Ganzi* day-stems,
Solving the Eight Gates’ openings and closings—
Then you may depart in freedom,
Move without hindrance,
Roam east and west,
Wander south and north within the *Duōtuó* (兜陀) Palace.

**The Laws of Departure and Abode (出入去住法) – Continued**

「Or you may attain the *Xuǎnyǔ* (玄圃) and *Máitái* (瑷台),
Or you may attain the *Ten Directions of All the Heavens* (十方诸天),
Or you may attain the *Sanqīng* (三清) Realms.

If one’s reason is clear and discerning,
One may naturally perceive the *Six Paths* (六道),
Arriving without hindrance—just as words spoken are heard,
Not in mere idle discourse of countless *kalpas* (劫).

Yángzǐ (扬子) said:
In *Yíngzhōu* (赢州), the path of ten thousand *li* of misty mountains
Is winding and ever-extending,
Yet with but a stretch of the arm, one arrives early,
And when returning, all is within one’s sight—
This is the meaning of such teachings still.

**The Method of the Three-Five-One (三五一点勘天年日时法)**
Take one *liáng* (两) of frankincense,
Divide into four parts.
Light the *Shén Dēng* (神灯) with its shadow.
Prepare thirty *jìnzǎo* (晋枣)—boiled and ripe—
Also divided into four parts.
Use a single large white jar,
Untouched by any hands.
Fill with four *liáng* (两) of pure oil,
A sheet of *xiānglú* (香炉) paper,
Four measures of *zhēngshuǐ* (争水),
A set of brush, inkstone, and ink,
And a new white mat.
One hundred and twenty *zu* (足) of clear, open *qián* (钱).

Arrange the following items as specified:
On the *suìdàn* (岁旦) night,
Sweep and purify a single chamber.
Place the brush, inkstone, ink, censer, dates, and paper
Upon the mat beneath the wall.
Install the lamp on the southern wall,
First inserting three wicks, then five stalks,
All drawn to a single point and lit.
Ascend the mat, sit upright facing the lamp,
Gaze fixed upon the flame as though it were a great lotus,
Silently reciting the *kè* (课) and *shuō* (说) within.

From the one hundred and twenty *qián* (钱),
Draw one aside as a *shì* (式).
If one assumes a lifespan of fifty years,
And counts to the fifty-first *qián* (文),
Then the shadow will vanish before one’s eyes,
Revealing the truth—
Thus counting until all coins are exhausted,
Record the findings on paper,
Burn the first portion of incense,
And pray: *"In devotion to the Dao, disciple [name],*
*Taking refuge in the *Nányánfú* (南阎浮提) world,*
*Knowing my birthday,*
*Yet my death year unseen,*
*Now encountering the Three-Five-One Method,*
*The lamp’s shadow illuminated.*
*Should my lifespan end,*
*And my body vanish without shadow,*
*My spirits—*Sanhún* (三魂) and *Qīpò* (七魄), the *Twenty-Four Gods* (二十四神)—
*Must not be alarmed.*

*Rapidly strike the teeth,*
*And when the spirits settle,*
*Return to counting,*
*Record on paper,*
*Burn the second portion of incense,*
*And pray: *"Disciple [name]’s death year is known,*
*Yet the month remains unseen.*

*Again, with thirteen *qián* (文) prepared as before,*
*Should one reach the moment of no shadow,*
*In dread and fear,*
*Recite the *zhòu* (咒) and strike the teeth,*
*Gather the spirits as before,*
*And when the nature is stilled,*
*Count until all coins are exhausted,*
*Record the findings,*
*Burn the third portion of incense,*
*And pray: *"Disciple [name]’s death month is known,*
*Yet the day remains unseen.*

*Again, with thirty *qián* (文) prepared as before,*
*Should one reach the moment of no shadow,*
*In anxious terror,*
*Strike the teeth once more,*
*Gather the spirits as before,*
*And when the nature is stilled,*
*Count until all coins are exhausted,*
*Record the findings,*
*Burn the fourth portion of incense,*
*And pray: *"Disciple [name]’s death day is known,*
*Yet the hour remains unseen.*

*Again, with twelve *qián* (文) prepared as before,*
*Should one reach the moment of no shadow,*
*Strike the teeth,*
*Gather the spirits,*
*And when the nature is stilled,*
*Count until all coins are exhausted,*
*Seeing the first *qián* (文) as *yīn* (子), the second as *chǒu* (丑), the third as *yín* (寅).*

**For those who practice the Dao:**
Must first observe strict *fasts* (斋戒), bathe in purity,
Avoiding sounds, colors, wine, and meat,
Calming body and mind in stillness—
Only after seven days may the method be imparted,
Not to be taken lightly.

**The Method of Evading Calamity and Avoiding Perils (避难躲闪入杜门法)**
Record the year, month, day, and hour,
And follow the method accordingly.»

**Incantation:**

*"The Most High declares:*
If you wish to cross the Three Calamities and Nine Perils,
Speak thus:

*'I take Heaven as my father,
Earth as my mother,
And dwell within them,
Ever as an innocent child.
The Sun is my Functionary,
The Moon my Clerk.*

*Thunder Lord and Lightning Mother stand before and behind me.
Wind Lord and Rain Master stand at my sides.*

*The Six Celestial Stems and Directing Symbols encircle me completely.
The Azure Dragon supports my left,
The White Tiger my right.
The Vermilion Bird stands before me,
The Dark Warrior follows behind.
The Northern Dipper covers my head,
The Heavenly Ganges points to my feet.*

*The Soaring Serpent is in my hand,
To annihilate misfortune and guilt for me.*

*I dwell within the Cinnabar Chamber,
With Taiyi as my consort.
Three on my left, seven on my right,
Nine above my head, one beneath my feet.
Two and four are my shoulders,
Six and eight my feet.
I occupy the center,
As my fullness within.*

*Now in this age of calamity,
Ten thousand demons and spirits
Must each return to their native lands.*

*Those who confront me shall die,
Those who turn from me shall perish.
Hasten to flee and hide!
Heaven’s Executioners,
Sever the ghosts of ill-omen!*

*Swiftly, as the Most High Laozi commands and restrains.*

*[For] both official and private use."*

Favorable to visit noble officials or conduct trade,
Unfavorable for battles and conflicts.

Great armies shall never be exposed to ruin,
The sovereign may hunt and release game,
Commoners may capture beasts and fowl—
Unfavorable to assault forts or wield great force.
Favorable to avoid large-scale attacks,
For armies to settle in encampments undisturbed,
Though nights bring empty alarms,
Disrupting ranks—all shall still prevail.

**Emerging from the 惊 Gate:** [Favorable for #1]

**Emerging from the 开 Gate:**
Favorable to lead troops in punitive expeditions,
All battles shall be won.
If traveling far, trading, seeking merchandise,
Or contracting marriages—
Or sealing contracts for trade and harmony,
All shall bring good fortune.

The **Nine Palaces** shall reveal auspicious and inauspicious omens,
As well as the **孤虚** and **战阵** methods.

The **Nine Palaces** for solitary journeys, gambling, the **Eight Gates**, and the **三路吉铃**,
Determining fortune in all reversals and sequences.

**Jiazi and Jiachen** begin the First Palace,
**Geng** of the internal meets the Sixth Palace.

In **Spring and Summer**, follow this rule as stated,
In **Autumn and Winter**, Jiazi enters the **Qian** Palace.
**Gengyin** returns to the **枚** above—
A thousand years, ten thousand ages, ancient and modern alike.

The **Supreme One’s Eight Gates Dao** of the **Huangdi**,
The **顺** Gate and **逆** Gate’s decrees.

#1 [Text missing or incomplete.]

The **Huangdi’s Supreme One Eight Gates Entry Formula** (Scroll Upper Section):

The **玉女** is the **太阴**, the **太清**.
The **玉女** is the **Six Ding**, **Eight Li**—Yin deities of the Great Heavenly Emperor,
Manifesting in the **刀利天** with their **符**,
Summoning the **Six Ding** and all gods of **Hai** and **Jia**,
Together reciting the **Three Formulas of Great Power and Virtue**,
And receiving the **天罪天魁禹步神祝** #1,
To send into the mortal realm,
Averting calamities and escaping misfortunes,
Removing disasters and annihilating misfortunes,
To quell rebellious bandits and exterminate malevolent spirits.

In the time of the **Yellow Emperor (轩辕)**,
The **Chi You (蚩尤)** General caused chaos,
Slaughtering countless lives, beyond reckoning.
The **Yellow Emperor**, unable to bear it,
Had fought **Chi You** in many battles but could not conquer him,
Finding no way to destroy him.

The **玉女** spoke: *"Your servant, before descending to the mortal world,
Employed these Three Formulas of sacred script to aid the people,
Exterminating the wicked and vanquishing malevolent spirits.
Yet I dared not take this for myself alone."*

The **Heavenly Emperor** said: *"If you uphold this method,
You may move mountains and overturn seas,
Crush evil demons,
Conceal your form and vanish your shadow,
Summon clouds and bring forth rain—
Unfathomable and beyond thought.
This method may be passed to those who seek the Dao.
If one seeks liberation,
Keep its secrets well-guarded.
For oneself or others,
Transform misfortune into fortune,
Command ghosts and spirits—
Now, if you take strange foreign texts and rare treasures,
It shall be as easy as child’s play.
If you uphold this method with unwavering diligence,
All gold, silver, and seven treasures of the world
Shall come to you without seeking.
You now descend to aid the **Yellow Emperor** in crushing **Chi You’s** rebellion,
Removing the nation’s calamities.
After achieving **Great Peace**,
Entrust this method to virtuous scholars of the Dao,
Who shall uphold it—
None shall fail in their desires.
Past and future,
All matters shall be known,
No question shall remain unanswered.
Its efficacy is most profound and rare.
The Heavenly Emperor declares:
Pure and virtuous scholars of the Dao,
If they uphold this method,
Shall attain longevity and everlasting life,
Enduring vitality without bounds."*

The **Great God’s Incantation** thus:

*"It can make the **Six Ding** emerge from the **幽** and enter the **冥**,
Fearless and unalarmed.
Unshaken for ten thousand years,
Unfallen for a hundred thousand ages.
Today’s **禹步**, ascending to the **Heavenly Court**,
Descending to the **Earthly Principles**,
Dao and Virtue for eternal life.
Swiftly, as the **Law of the Supreme Laozi** commands and restrains.*

*"Uphold it, like the sun and moon illuminating the world.
I now further reveal the **Six Ding’s** divine **印**,
Granting those who practice its rites swift power and divine efficacy."*

The **First Seal**: First, extend the little finger and ring finger straight upward to meet the middle finger at its first joint. This seal enables the practitioner to conceal their shadow and hide their form.

The **Second Seal**: Without altering the previous position, hook the little finger inward. Then, while holding the seal before the heart, recite the incantation a hundred times. This grants the practitioner the power to fly beyond the heavens, to move mountains and uproot seas—subtle and wondrous techniques.

The **Third Seal**: Retain the prior form, but clasp the right fist over the left hand at heart level. This seal allows the practitioner to summon the finest treasures of the world, bestowing them upon those who practice, to bestow mercy and relieve suffering.

The **Fourth Seal**: Keep the previous form, but press both fists together, palms facing inward. This seal makes noble persons appear, granting a radiant and graceful countenance, smooth passage in all affairs, and the power to summon clouds and bring rain.

The **Fifth Seal**: Retain the prior form, but extend the thumb straight upward, aligning its mark with the center. This seal governs metal, wood, water, fire, and earth, enabling the practitioner to refine their body, attain longevity, and preserve their youth.

The **Sixth Seal**: The **Machine Seal** (*jīshǒu*). This grants mastery over the **Taiyin**—the **Jade Maiden** will ever stand at one’s side. Nothing shall be denied, so long as the practitioner remains resolute in will and recites the incantation.

The Heavenly Emperor declares:
*"Guard these seals with care—do not reveal them to the unworthy. Once one attains this method, pass it only to three others. This is the path to escape suffering’s sea and ascend the Dao of immortality. Do not recklessly transmit it to the unworthy; maintain purity in practice and observance. My method is established within the sacred altar, sealed by oath and decree—most sublime and wondrous. If you transmit these seals to others, thereafter do not act hastily. A second transmission will render the method ineffective, risking ruin. Thus, the altar’s oath is binding: henceforth, follow the seals in silence, unspoken. The divine efficacy of Taiyin and the Jade Maiden shall be unrestrained.*

*This method is most fitting for those who seek hidden mysteries, not to be seen or heard by the unworthy—guard it with reverence."*

The **Great Heavenly Emperor of the Three Sovereigns** declares:
*"According to the prescribed rites, there exist the **Taiyin Jade Maiden**, the **Six Ding**, and the **Eight Officials**—six divine talismans governing the paths. They fly ten thousand *li*, reporting to the realm. They can also retrieve the world’s rare treasures and wealth, boundless in use. Those who bear the seals and talismans shall wield unerring power, nothing shall be denied. The **Taiyin Jade Maiden** commands the Nine Heavenly Maidens and knows all messages from a thousand *li* away, as if before her eyes. She transcends heaven and earth—beyond comprehension. When wearing the talisman and entering battle, the enemy shall retreat and submit.*

*The **Six Ding Divine Generals’ Talismans** follow:

1. **Dingmao Divine General**—of the Xu Yi household, surnamed Gongsun Qi. The deity wears Daoist robes with a rabbit-headed crown, wielding a spear in the right hand. He has the power to summon clouds, bring rain, and break enemy formations.

2. **Dingchou Divine General**—of the Xu Ke household, surnamed Chengzi. The deity wears yellow robes with a cow-headed crown, holding a *wǔ* (halberd) in both hands, named Zilin. He retrieves strange treasures from the sea.

3. **Divine General**—of the Sima Guang household, surnamed Shiji. The deity wears black robes with a *dǔtóu* (block-shaped) crown, holding a *chēng* (axe) in the right hand, named Lingcheng. He flies vast distances on land, retrieving the world’s finest treasures.

4. **Dingyou Divine General**—of the Shi Zhong household, surnamed Ganke. The deity wears white robes with a chicken-headed crown, holding a crossbow in the left hand. The Heavenly Maiden commands ghosts and spirits to flee with thunder and lightning, summoning clouds and rain.

5. **Divine General**—of the Gongsun Jie household, surnamed Simasheng. The deity wears yellow Daoist robes with a ram-headed crown, holding a spear in the left hand. He has the power to turn day into night.

6. **Dingyi Divine General**—of the Gongsun Guang household, surnamed Simaqing. The deity wears crimson robes with a snake-headed crown, holding a pickaxe in the left hand. He has the power to move mountains and overturn seas.

*For the aforementioned six **Ding** and **Jade Maiden talismans**, during a lunar eclipse, gather **Du Jing** wood (or *wú*tong, or *bèi* wood), carving a plaque nine *cun* long, two *fēn* thick. Write the deity’s name with *xionghuang* (realgar) on the reverse, then sew it into a pouch. If deploying troops, at the general’s location, inscribe the talisman for the corresponding day of the *ganzhi* cycle. For example, on a *jiazi* day, inscribe the **Dingmao talisman** and hang it toward the enemy on the altar. The troops shall immediately retreat or surrender, daring not to face it.*

*When gathering wood, first have someone observe the lunar eclipse’s timing, then bathe and fast for three days beforehand. Prepare dried meat and burn incense in sacrifice before felling the tree. The incantation reads:*

*'Du Jing wood, spirit of longing,
Descendant [name] of the [surname] clan,
Calms the transformations of the Six *Jia*,
Follows my will with reverence,
Offers wine and dried meat,
Prays for divine descent, drunk and sated.
Swiftly, as the Law commands and restrains.'*

*After the sacrifice, the wood is cut and carved into plaques. The talismans are inscribed, and the altar is erected in the deity’s chamber—this too shall suffice.*

**The Three-Tiered Altar Rite for the General’s Sacrifice** (*Shàngjiāngjūn tán*)

**The Three-Tiered Altar Dimensions and Arrangement**

**For the General’s Altar (Shàngjiāngjūn tán):**
First tier: square and circular, each side measuring 36 *chi*;
Second tier: square and circular, each side measuring 32 *chi*;
Third tier: square and circular, each side measuring 28 *chi*.
Each tier stands 12 *chi* high, with a recessed depth of 1 *chi* 2 *cùn*; thirty-six gates are opened, each with a recessed face of 1 *chi* 2 *cùn*.

**For the Official’s Altar (Shìhuàn tán):**
First tier: square and circular, each side measuring 24 *chi*;
Second tier: square and circular, each side measuring 22 *chi*;
Third tier: square and circular, each side measuring 18 *chi*.
Each tier rises 8 *cùn* in height, with recessed faces of 1 *chi*; twenty-four gates are opened.

**For the Commoner’s Altar (Shùrén tán):**
First tier: square and circular, each side measuring 12 *chi*;
Second tier: square and circular, each side measuring 10 *chi*;
Third tier: square and circular, each side measuring 8 *chi*.
Each tier rises 6 *cùn* in height; twelve gates are opened—this is for common households.

Place the deity’s chamber (*shénshì*) outside the residence, a hundred *bù* away, with twelve directional gates aligned to the *liùshí fēnyě* (six divisions of the celestial stems). Use bamboo rods (*zhuān*), each three *chi* long, arranged according to the square’s orientation.

On the plaques, hang the positions of the Six *Dīng* (Sixth Heavenly Generals), using five-colored silk strips, each three *chi* long, as markers. Arrange them in order.

Divide the offerings—wine, dried meat, flowers, and fruit—into six portions, corresponding to the Six *Dīng*. Invoke each by name and surname day and night.

The Six *Dīng*:
*Dīngmǎo* (玉女文伯 *Yùnǚ Wénbó*), surname *Rén Gāo* (仁高);
*Dīngchǒu* (玉女文公 *Yùnǚ Wéngōng*), surname *Rén Guì* (仁贵);

**Incantation:**
*"May the Six *Dīng* emerge from the shadowed depths,
Enter the dark and unseen."*

«None shall you fear, none shall you dread.
Ten thousand years unshaken, ten thousand years uninclined.
Heaven and Earth rest together, eternal life through countless *kāli* (劫).

Swiftly, swiftly as the *Lǜyù Lìng* (律令) commands.

**The Daoist Scriptures say:**
The Six *Dīng* and *Yùnǚ* (玉女), vast in power yet minute in form,
long in duration yet fleeting in time—call them by name and they shall obey,
all matters bent to your will.
Thousand *lǐ* away, they yet know your tidings.

Furthermore, they can summon all worldly things at your command.
Should there be wine, fish, or meat elsewhere,
a thousand *lǐ* distant, they shall arrive instantly.

They purify your dwelling, warding off the Six *Dú* (毒),
so none may dare approach. Your children shall be wise,
long-lived, and blessed with prosperity,
never wanting till old age.
Wealth shall come of its own accord;
serving your lord shall bring fulfillment.
Ever in reverence, ever joyous,
no fear of trifles or misfortunes.

Their spirits all know—directly descending to this realm,
they perceive the fortune or calamity of your home.
Summon them and they shall answer;
if your plea is sincere, their response shall be swift.
Do not reveal this to others,
lest the power be lost.
Only pass it to a worthy *zhìrén* (至人).

On the *Dīngmǎo* (丁卯) day of the *Míng* (明) month,
when the *Hékuí* (河魁) and *Cóngkuí* (从魁) align,
summon them.

On the *Dīngchǒu* (丁丑) day of the *Xiǎojí* (小吉) month,
when *Shèngguāng* (胜光) prevails,
summon them.

On the *Dīnghài* (丁亥) day of the *Tàiyī* (太一) month,
when *Tàichōng* (太冲) and *Tiāngāng* (天罡) are at their peak,
summon them.

On the *Dīngyǒu* (丁酉) day of the *Gōngcáo* (功曹) month,
when *Dàjī* (大吉) and *Shénhòu* (神后) are auspicious,
summon them.

The Six *Dīng* generals govern the Six *Dào* (道).
**The Daoist Scriptures say:**
For all manner of petitions, invoke the Six *Dīng* and *Yùnǚ*.
Whether seeking favor from great officials,
or appeasing stern teachers,
they shall not dare to anger you lightly.
Ever keep a merciful heart,
ever guard your tongue—
speak no idle words,
no curses,
no defamation of your chamber.

If you sacrifice and command them,
they shall foresee matters yet unseen,
reveal hidden truths,
and confirm their power instantly.

Should you face official disputes,
contentious tongues,
or discord of all kinds,
or should children—male, female, or young—suffer grave illness,
or should your home face ruin and decay,
or should your business pursuits fail to meet your desires,
all these woes shall vanish
when you sacrifice to the Six *Dīng* and *Yùnǚ*,
and your wishes shall be fulfilled as you will.

**Current Ritual Method:**
A single new mat of *xí* (席),
six new cloths for hand towels, each six *chǐ* long,
six censers of incense,
one bowl of purified water,
six portions of dried fish and meat,
six portions of *bǐng* (饼) and *tāng* (汤),
six portions of *lù* (鹿) *pú* (脯),
six portions of fresh fruit,
six portions of wine,
six lamps,
six cups of tea,
and six servings of vegetables—
offer these in veneration.
The remnants shall be consumed by you.

First, sweep and cleanse the sacred chamber.
Spread the new mat of *xí* (席),
and address the young spirits in gentle tones:
*"I am the sacrifice’s master,
traveling the Dao beneath Heaven,
banishing all ill fortune,
and forming a bond with you.
I shall ever offer fish, deer’s flesh, and such,
and speak my words to you:

Six *Dīng* and *Yùnǚ*,
each take your proper place.
Daoists pour the wine,
*Yùnǚ* attend with the cups.
*Fēngbó* (风伯) sweeps the hall,
*Yǔshī* (雨师) bears the ladle.

Today’s rites are auspicious,
the day and hour most favorable.
The ancient masters have decreed—
receive my sacred offerings.

First, the deer’s flesh,
then the date wine,
a hundred days’ clear brew,
and the floating honey of green liquor.

Next, the ripe fruits,
then the pure white grains.

Where I sit and act,
as firm as *Jīngāng* (金刚),
prolonging life and vigor,
eradicating all suffering.

Evil spirits and *wǎngliǎng* (魍魉),
depart to distant lands.
Those who pursue me shall die,
great offenders shall be concealed.

My studies shall flourish,
and I shall meet the *Xiānwáng* (仙王).
Swiftly, swiftly as the *Lǜyù Lìng* (律令) commands."*»

「Yán Jūn Píng said: For those who practice this method, observe three days of pure and solemn fasting and abstinence, then at the time of *rén dìng* (人定, the late-night hour when human activity ceases) and when the rooster crows, perform the rites—no more than six sacrifices, and the deities will manifest themselves.

But if one gazes intently upon the deities, they will converse with humans as sisters, brothers, or kin, revealing auspicious or inauspicious matters.

In the *Huángdì Tài Yī Bā Mén Rù Shì Jué* (黄帝太一八门入式诀) scroll, the section marked with #1—where the character *Zhù* (祝) is unclear, possibly a corruption—

In the lower part of the *Huángdì Tài Yī Bā Mén Rù Shì Jué* scroll, the *Huángdì* (黄帝) states: The Six Ding and Jade Women always follow [one], each possessing their own wisdom. If one wishes to summon them, simply call their names, and their divine efficacy will be verified.

In ancient times, *Guǐgǔ Zǐ* (鬼谷子), *Zhāng Tài Xuān* (张太玄), *Tánggōng Bì* (唐公弼), *Fèi Chángfáng* (费长房), *Lǐ Bā Bó* (李八伯), *Táo Xiānsheng* (陶先生), *Lǔ Āigōng* (鲁哀公), *Luòqiú Zǐ* (珞球子), *Wǔ Zǐxū* (伍子胥), *Zhāng Zǐfáng* (张子房), *Lǔ Pínggōng* (鲁平公), *Zhōu Wénlóng Xiānsheng* (周文隆先生), *Wáng Zǐqiáo* (王子乔), *Níng Xiānsheng* (宁先生), *Sòng Yuán* (宋员), *Zuǒ Gōngfáng* (左公房), *Huáinán Zǐ* (淮南子), *Nǚluó Xiānsheng* (女罗先生), and *Xiè Zìrán* (谢自然) all practiced this method, and all attained the Dao/Way of immortality.

If one cannot maintain purity, abstaining from conjugal relations and avoiding lustful desires, they may only achieve longevity. To retain wealth and noble status for ten thousand years without loss is to attain immortality.

The masters passed down this method, which can cure myriad human ailments, reveal the names and dwellings of ghosts and spirits, and discern the movements of all malevolent and supernatural beings—including the Six Ding and the Jade Women. All matters of life, death, fortune, and misfortune, as well as great and small affairs, will be revealed in dreams.

Only those who are cautious in speech and conduct may encounter this method; then all matters will proceed according to their will.

If a state possesses this text, it will repel all evil, and strange tongues and supernatural beings will never approach its gates. Even a hundred thousand pounds of gold cannot be transmitted to those who do not cherish this method—it is only passed to refined and virtuous individuals. Practicing the method of the Six Ding and Jade Women is indeed a wondrous Dao/Way.

The Six Ding are associated with the following positions:
- *Dīngmǎo* (丁卯) and *Dīngwèi* (丁未) belong to the Four Palaces,
- *Dīngjǐ* (丁巳) and *Dīngyǒu* (丁酉) belong to the Seven Palaces,
- *Dīnghài* (丁亥) stands directly south in the Nine Palaces,
- *Dīngchǒu* (丁丑) is always stationed at the Three Palaces.

The Jade Women say: According to the method, establish the day and palace of the gate, adding *yángjiǎ* (阳甲, the heavenly stem). For example, if it is the first day of the first month (*jīngzǐ* 甲子), the *Fúdé* (福德, Deity of Auspicious Virtue) is stationed in the First Palace, while the *Xiūmén* (休门, Gate of Rest) is stationed at *Dīng* (丁).

The cycle then repeats:
- *Jīng* (甲) in the *Shèn* (震) month is auspicious for the *Shēngmén* (生门, Gate of Life),
- *Bǐng* (丙) in the *Chén* (辰) month is auspicious for the *Shēngmén* (生门, Gate of Life),
- *Dīng* (丁) in the *Kǎn* (坎) month is auspicious for the *Xiūmén* (休门, Gate of Rest),
- *Wù* (戊) in the *Duì* (兑) month is the *Jīngmén* (惊门, Gate of Alarm),
- *Gēng* (庚) in the *Kūn* (坤) month is the *Sǐmén* (死门, Gate of Death),
- *Xīn* (辛) in the *Lǐ* (离) month is the *Yǐngmén* (景门, Gate of Reflection).

The Jade Women say: If the *Xiūmén* (休门, Gate of Rest) or *Shēngmén* (生门, Gate of Life) passes through *Yǐ* (乙), *Bǐng* (丙), or *Dīng* (丁), they are the three auspicious *qímén* (奇门, Strange Gates). When the *Dīng* (丁) character is placed on the feet or face, the gates of the left and right are closed, sealing the earthly entrance.

Incantation follows. The incantation says:」

**Translation:**

*Women in the inner right hand—*
*Speak not, hold the breath, and write.*

*This method is divinely efficacious.*
*Sun, Wu, Han, and Bai recorded this talisman’s method.*
*In the late Han, during the Three Kingdoms,*
*The Prime Minister Zhuge Liang of Western Shu,*
*Employed the Seven Captures and Seven Releases,*
*And subdued the barbarian chieftains and rebel generals—*
*This same method.*
*If they do not depart,*
*They shall be bewildered by fate.*

*Count swiftly from the Dipper’s Mouth—*
*This is the marvel.*

*«In all cases of invoking this method, inscribe the talismans and charms and place them in the location where the lost item was taken.

This thief spirit, surnamed *Quan* (泉), named *Yang* (恙),
Takes the form of a human head, with hair shorn to expose the top of the skull and eyes.
It resembles a human face with donkey ears.
It moves without feet, kneeling on the ground with its knees,
And has a tail, fond of wearing coarse black garments.
By nature, it is malevolent—
With its left hand wielding a spear, its right clutching money and stolen goods,
And it delights in killing people.
If this thief has already harmed or wounded you,
Or injured your own body, how then shall you resolve it?
As with petty thieves who steal,
Use all manner of spells and techniques to capture it.

Write the talismans in vermilion on silk,
And draw the thief’s likeness of both form and spirit.
Then, at the lost item’s location,
Or beneath the Dipper’s Mouth in the western courtyard,
Recite incantations to the Five Directions:
Reverently summon the East’s Green Sovereign (*Qingdi* 青帝) as green,
The South’s Red Sovereign (*Chidi* 赤帝) as red,
The West’s White Sovereign (*Baidi* 白帝) as white,
The North’s Black Sovereign (*Heidi* 黑帝) as black,
And the Center’s Yellow Sovereign (*Huangdi* 黄帝) as yellow.
I, following the Heavenly Strategy Divine General,
Seize your body—
Then let the gods hold and pursue you!

If you do not comply,
I shall transmit your true form
And cast you into the fiery abyss of ten thousand fathoms,
Sending you to the female *Yindu* (女阴) mountain of *Luo* (都罗),
Where you shall never again be reborn,
And suffer endless torment for countless ages. #1

My words are divine, my words are sacred—
Toward the east, I spit to shatter the bound wood;
Toward the south, I spit to extinguish the fire;
Toward the west, I spit to break the adamantine bolt;
Toward the north, I spit to drain the water;
Toward the heavens, I spit to topple the Celestial Pillar;
Toward the earth, I spit to split the ground—
Spit upon one thief, and all thieves perish!

Swiftly, swiftly, as the *Taishang* (太上) Imperial Edict commands!

On the following day, at the Hour of the Tiger (寅时),
The thief shall bind itself and appear at your gate.
If you wish to release it, release it;
If you wish to capture it, capture it.
