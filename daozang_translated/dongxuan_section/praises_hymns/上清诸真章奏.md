### **Hymns of the Supreme Clarity Perfected Ones**

#### **Hymn of the Three Contracts of the Supreme Clarity Pace-Void**
From the beginning, the Cavern-Void is empty,
The Three Blacks ascend to the gate of essence.
Purple wings gleam in the Great Void,
The Four Illuminations plant the root of spirit.
Wondrous transformation blooms in the Eastern Jade,
The Three Conveniences open the Western Kun.
Radiant and bright, the Nine Mysteries’ essence,
Five Florets girded with brocade clouds.
Departing the net, the divine lamp shines,
The Seven Stars illuminate the Northern Origin.
Floating, floating, ascending to the Dharma precincts,
Wing to wing, the Imperial Unity is revered.
Lofty, lofty, the exalted hymn,
How the feathered youths swarm!
Flowing fragrance is without color,
Yet it enters the myriad immortals’ throng.
Leftward, the Three Kalpas revolve,
Rightward, the Ten Thousand Arrows’ pass turns.
Cloud florets tassel the Five Clouds,
Eight Phoenixes dance in the wheel of space.
The Four Seasons never halt their mechanism,
Blue and white are early distinguished.
Nine nines alter the kalpa’s fate,
Three threes traverse one cycle.
Heaven and Earth have their final meeting,
Adversity and stimulus return to the banner.
The Cavern Illumination’s Orthodox Unity Dharma,
Solemnly concludes the Six Heavens’ patterns.
Great Peace reverts to emptiness and nothingness,
Serving and aiding the Later Sage Lord.

The divine wind rises at the Western Gate,
Brocade clouds arise from the Eastern Jade.
The Two Qi gleam upon the Jade Isle,
Flowing fragrance rides the mist, light.
Five Florets unfurl in the wind,
In an instant, the Nine Clarities shine bright.
The Kun Forest glows with the Vermilion Sun,
Yellow Florets follow the moon’s birth.
Within, the herb-gathering youths,
Clothed in feathers, girded with flying azure.
The scenery of ten thousand peaks,
Carefree, feasting in the green chariot.
Mastering the Nine Void Transmissions,
Their motion unfolds without fixed measure.
Left, they command the Three Heavens’ patterns,
Right, they seize the Six Heavens’ hosts.
They inspect qi and the Cavern-Void,
The celestial degrees align with fate’s tilt.
Kalpas have their own meetings,
Who laments defeat or success?
Vast waves engulf the cloud’s net,
The Six Harmonies leave no trace.
White corpses drift on the long flow,
Lonely souls scatter and fade.
Grieving this departure and return,
Only then is the Orthodox Dharma’s clarity known.
Devoted study and refined cultivation,
In the Eastern Flower, a jade name is forged.
Rejoicing in those of the White Tablet,
Together they delight in Great Peace.

The Cavern Gates turn the celestial net,
The Kingly Qi revolves the Three Subtleties.
Purple portals spew jade tablets,
Golden gates receive the divine radiance.
The Eight Assemblies exchange the true wind,
Brilliant and bright, the layered darkness opens.
Beyond the Nine Clarities at heaven’s edge,
Lofty, lofty, the exalted dawn returns.
Three hues revert to emptiness and nothingness,
The Four Seasons respond to the Jade Precincts.
The River waits, brush already poised,
The Five Phases subtly propel one another.
The Six Perfections know no end,
When fate exhausts, they ride qi to return.
Ten thousand demons spread across the heavens,
Hordes of fiends vie to display their might.
The multitudes bear calamity’s thrust,
Piles of corpses move one to sorrow.
Wondrous, the Orthodox Dharma’s patterns,
Treading kalpas, their brightness never fades.
At the destined time, they are welcomed,
Their pact at the Nine Heavens’ gates.
With you, I await Great Peace,
Releasing the body to fly wingless.

---

#### **Hymn of the Supreme Clarity Rotating Walk**
The Great Dao pervades the mysterious subtleties,
The lofty void encompasses the Three Wheels.
Golden Immortals open the numinous gates,
Gleaming as if the Nine Heavens divide.
Great Florets scatter in the purple void,
Eight Perfected reflect the plain clouds.
The Mysterious Mother binds the supreme vow,
The Eight Gates of the walking tablet.
Ten thousand blessings converge in the numinous assembly,
Raising incense, they chant the Lower Origin.
Wondrous recitation moves the Void’s depths,
Achieving union with the exalted immortals’ throng.
Rotating, they walk and bow to the Cavern-Void,
Kowtowing to the Imperial Lord.

---

#### **Pace-Void Lament and Joy Wisdom Verses**
I bind my natural qi,
Congealing and transforming the Purple Phoenix City.
The high terrace soars beyond the Nine Ridges,
Towering and layered, forming flying jade.
Gleaming and falling upon the layered void,
Winding through the Eight Clarities’ caverns.
Purple canopies illuminate the cloud palaces,
Flowing radiance shades the Five Numinous.
Four directions reach boundless wilds,
Eight qi revolve in round clarity.
The whirlwind turns the Great Void,
The Seven Luminaries revolve the celestial scriptures.
Their motion comes as if without form,
Their departure follows transformation’s tilt.
Within the Nine Circles’ crossings,
The Two Images mutually contend.
The Imperial Unity solidifies the Central Origin,
The Four Nets do not decline in spirit.
Southward, they gather the Flying Sovereign’s treasure,
Northward, they array the Broad Cold Court.
Mysterious chambers exchange true meetings,
Void songs arise naturally.
The Five Thearchs command the numinous banners,
Demon flags subdue the myriad essences.
Demons howl from the void’s midst,
The Dao-world’s joy knows no end.
Thus, the pure verses arise,
Celebrating the spirits, delighting in Great Peace.
With whom do we pact, and where?
Ten thousand kalpas as one age.
Revolving ninety thousand kalpas,
Together we roam the Purple Phoenix chariot.

The Void births the Purple Phoenix Terrace,
Jade towers join the Supreme Subtlety.
The numinous wind pervades the Eight Assemblies,
The Northern Window and Heavenly Gates open.
Above, the whistling and singing youths,
Ever chant the turning of decay and decline.
At dawn, they ride the luminaries to wander,
At dusk, they return with the luminaries.
The Two Luminaries unite as one body,
Ever fearing to lose the radiance’s gleam.
The Nine Qi do not abide forever,
Heaven and Earth have their overturning peril.
The great kalpa concludes one cycle,
A hundred and six ride fate’s return.
Vast springs surge from the Nine Ridges,
The Great Crow soars at heaven’s verge.
Ten thousand creatures drift on the long flow,
Gazing at the mountains, they find no refuge.
Wailing without bound,
How can one not grieve in the heart?
The worthy and sagely diligently recite scriptures,
Thus they ride the luminaries to fly.
At the destined time, they are welcomed,
Together they meet at the Nine Heavens’ gates.

When the golden horse’s time is exhausted,
Ten thousand calamities surge and clash.
No immortal learners are seen,
Only those who weep for the corpses in sorrow.
Alas, these foolish beings,
Clinging to life, how piteous their lament!
Dispersing sorrow at the Nine Mysteries’ terrace,
Gathering joy in the Great Void.
Holding pact with the Ten Heavenly Perfected,
Whistling to summon the Eastern Sea youths.
Four directions, the Eight Assemblies’ qi,
The mysterious motion of the Lang Terrace’s wind.
The sun shines on the Western Flower Hall,
The mind harmonizes with the Broad Cold Void.
Dancing beneath the Purple Phoenix,
Desolate, the Nine Ridges’ peaks.
Gazing across boundless wilds,
Looking up to the kalpa’s measure.
Clear songs harmonize with palace and commerce,
Sorrow and joy naturally follow.
The Two Paths harmonize in one pact,
Principle’s back turns, yet returns to unity.
Together, joy knows no end,
Holding the beginning, again holding the end.
Drinking deeply from the Jade Pool’s nectar,
Looking up to drink from the Flying Flower Sovereign.
The numinous melon is fit for feasting,
Its flavor like the sun and moon’s light.

The Seven Luminaries stream their fragrant radiance,
How could this joy ever be forgotten?
The great kalpa has its destined end,
As the cycles meet, the Two Symbols incline.

Dragon Gate severs the Celestial River,
The Three and Five turn against each other in contention.
The Crimson Guardian occupies the Eastern Well,
The Florid Canopy subdues the morning stars.

Dark radiance dims the Eight Wastes,
Foul qi veils the celestial essence.
The Three Officials press upon one another,
The Five Peaks lose their steadfast numen.

Myriad plagues surge and clash,
The Northern Emperor marshals his demonic hosts.
The Eight Principles spread beyond the heavens,
Only the Sage Lord can bring clarity.

This weaves the qi of spontaneity,
Forming the towering Ninefold City.
Gazing from on high, pitying the myriad multitudes,
Sorrow and joy arise therefrom.

Mysterious songs disperse the spirit’s cares,
Yet sudden joy gives way to tears.
Alas for these stubborn folk,
Miserly with wealth, greedy for sensual glory.

Jubilant, they await their fate’s arrival,
Heedless of calamity that coils around them.
The wise and sagacious come from afar,
Diligently reciting scriptures day and night.

They venerate emptiness, contemplate the Mysterious Void,
Thus transcending boundless ages.
If one can seek the source of the Dao,
At the eight seasonal nodes, jade names are offered.

They shall avoid the disasters of the Nine Luminaries,
And behold for you the Great Peace.
The Jade Phoenix discourses on the morning gale,
The Purple Terrace illumines the Jade Grove.

Flowing light brushes the Profound Mystery,
Majestic, it ascends the Nine Yin.
Purple effulgence scatters crimson clouds,
Flying mists pursue one another.

The Seven Treasures shake the jade branches,
Spiritual beasts gallop through cloudy peaks.
Myriad immortals ride the void in song,
Divine winds carry wondrous sounds.

Above, the Lofty Morning Master,
With folded hands, whistles and chants.
The Eight Assemblies’ natural countenance,
Their descent in emptiness all of orchid-gold.

Jade chewing extends the kalpa’s dawn,
Jade nectar disperses through the Centered Heart.
Luminous pearls sing sacred songs,
Dharma’s presence harmonizes with the clear zither.

Jade stanzas reveal the Dao’s ultimate lineage,
Sorrow and joy dissolve the heart’s cares.
The Purple Canopy gleams over the Cloud Palace,
Flowing radiance veils the Five Numinous Ones.

The Four Directions stretch into boundless wilds,
The Eight Qi revolve in perfect clarity.
The whirlwind courses through the Great Void,
The Seven Luminaries turn the celestial scriptures.

When the cycle arrives, it is as if formless,
When the time departs, it follows transformation’s incline.
Within the Nine Circles’ intersecting paths,
The Two Symbols contend with one another.

The Primordial Unity of the Emperor stabilizes the Center,
The Four Principles do not falter in their numen.
To the south, the Flying Sovereign’s treasure is gathered,
To the north, the Broad Cold Court is arrayed.

The Mysterious Chamber hosts the true assembly,
Empty songs arise spontaneously.
The Five Emperors command the spirit banners,
Demon standards subdue the myriad essences.

Demons howl from the void,
Yet the Dao-world’s joy knows no end.
Thus I raise these plain verses,
To celebrate the gods and rejoice in the Great Peace.

With whom shall this covenant be made?
For ten thousand kalpas as one age.
Revolving through ninety thousand kalpas,
Together we roam the Purple Phoenix’s chariot.

Born from the void, the Purple Phoenix Terrace,
Jade towers reach the Supreme Subtlety.
Numinous winds penetrate the Eight Assemblies,
The Northern Window and Heavenly Gates swing open.

Above, whistling and singing youths,
Ever chanting of cycles’ decline and fall.
At dawn, they ride the light on their journey,
At dusk, they return with the light.

The Two Radiances unite as one body,
Ever fearful of losing the light’s splendor.
The Nine Qi do not abide forever,
Heaven and earth face perilous incline.

The great kalpa concludes in one turn,
The Hundred Six ride the revolving cycles.
Vast springs surge through the Nine Ridges,
The Great Crow soars at heaven’s edge.

Myriad creatures drift on endless currents,
Seeking the mountains in vain for refuge.
Wailing without bound,
How can this not grieve the heart?

The worthy and sagely diligently recite scriptures,
Thus they ride the light and take flight.
When the time comes, they are welcomed,
Joining the assembly at the Nine Heavens’ gates.

When the golden horse’s hour is spent,
Myriad plagues surge and clash.
No immortal learners are seen,
Only those who weep for the dead in sorrow.

Alas for these foolish folk,
Clutching their lives, how bitter their lament!
Dispersing cares on the Ninefold Mystery Terrace,
Gathering joy together with the Great Void.

Holding covenant with the Ten Heavenly Perfected,
Whistling to summon the Eastern Sea youths.
Four directions, the Eight Assemblies’ qi,
The mysterious motion of the Lang Terrace’s wind.

The sun shines on the Western Flower Hall,
The mind harmonizes with the Broad Cold Void.
Dancing beneath the Purple Phoenix,
Desolate, the Nine Ridges’ peaks.

Gazing across boundless wilds,
Looking up to the kalpa’s measure.
Clear songs harmonize with palace and commerce,
Sorrow and joy naturally follow.

The Two Paths harmonize in one pact,
Principle’s back turns, yet returns to unity.
Together, joy knows no end,
Holding the beginning, again holding the end.

Drinking deeply from the Jade Pool’s nectar,
Looking up to drink from the Flying Flower Sovereign.
The numinous melon is fit for feasting,
Its flavor like the sun and moon’s light.

The Seven Luminaries stream their fragrant radiance,
How could this joy ever be forgotten?
The great kalpa has its destined end,
As the cycles meet, the Two Symbols incline.

Dragon Gate severs the Celestial River,
The Three and Five turn against each other in contention.
The Crimson Guardian occupies the Eastern Well,
The Florid Canopy subdues the morning stars.

Dark radiance dims the Eight Wastes,
Foul qi veils the celestial essence.
The Three Officials press upon one another,
The Five Peaks lose their steadfast numen.

Myriad plagues surge and clash,
The Northern Emperor marshals his demonic hosts.
The Eight Principles spread beyond the heavens,
Only the Sage Lord can bring clarity.

This weaves the qi of spontaneity,
Forming the towering Ninefold City.
Gazing from on high, pitying the myriad multitudes,
Sorrow and joy arise therefrom.

Mysterious songs disperse the spirit’s cares,
Yet sudden joy gives way to tears.
Alas for these stubborn folk,
Miserly with wealth, greedy for sensual glory.

Jubilant, they await their fate’s arrival,
Heedless of calamity that coils around them.
The wise and sagacious come from afar,
Diligently reciting scriptures day and night.

They venerate emptiness, contemplate the Mysterious Void,
Thus transcending boundless ages.
If one can seek the source of the Dao,
At the eight seasonal nodes, jade names are offered.

They shall avoid the disasters of the Nine Luminaries,
And behold for you the Great Peace.
The Jade Phoenix discourses on the morning gale,
The Purple Terrace illumines the Jade Grove.

Flowing light brushes the Profound Mystery,
Majestic, it ascends the Nine Yin.
Purple effulgence scatters crimson clouds,
Flying mists pursue one another.

The Seven Treasures shake the jade branches,
Spiritual beasts gallop through cloudy peaks.
Myriad immortals ride the void in song,
Divine winds carry wondrous sounds.

Above, the Lofty Morning Master,
With folded hands, whistles and chants.
The Eight Assemblies’ natural countenance,
Their descent in emptiness all of orchid-gold.

Jade chewing extends the kalpa’s dawn,
Jade nectar disperses through the Centered Heart.
Luminous pearls sing sacred songs,
Dharma’s presence harmonizes with the clear zither.

Jade stanzas reveal the Dao’s ultimate lineage,
Sorrow and joy dissolve the heart’s cares.
I release myself from boundless ages,
How deep is this true delight!

The spontaneous melody of the lofty immortals,
How could it be shared in this reverence?
At dawn, I sport in the Eastern Flower Palace,
At dusk, I wander the Western Flower Hall.

Taking joy in the Two Flower Halls,
Yet not encountering true joy.
Only hearing the Mysterious Song’s disciples,
Their mournful voices grieving the Heavenly Youths.

Sorrowful echoes flow through the Cold Court,
Striking the heart with the world’s exhausted cycles.
The Heavenly Horse leaps through the Nine Rivers,
The Raven Mother rides the Flying Dragon.

The Mysterious Ford has no bridge,
The Two Qi stand sundered, unlinked.
I ascend my towering Lingceng Terrace,
Gazing upward through the Nine Perils.

Foul qi fills the Three Luminaries,
Myriad multitudes bear calamity’s surge.
The Eight Domains are left without a soul,
Great and small mountains and peaks collapse.

Pondering this, I know not the learning,
Hearing the scriptures as if deaf and dumb.
Together we drift with fate’s course,
Swiftly and suddenly life meets its end.

Alas, how cruel the appointed time!
Thinking of you, my breast is stricken with grief.
The Purple Phoenix takes flight through the void,
Soaring over the ninefold peaks of the Mysterious Gully.

When qi congeals, the radiant form appears;
When qi scatters, the spirit is no more.
Drifting, drifting beyond all bounds,
The music of heaven delights my joy.

I join the Eight Assemblies’ chant,
Ranking with the lofty immortals’ company.
Hand in hand with the Ten Heavenly Perfected,
I feast my body of the Nine Phoenixes.

Above, I ascend the Jade Capital’s gates,
Below, I sport on the Langfeng Isle.
Feathered steeds swiftly bear jade chariots,
Purple mists waft through empty space.

The utmost dawn awaits the coming day,
Together we rejoice without end or sorrow.
My gaze flows with fate’s shifts,
A hundred million kalpas begin one cycle.

I delight in the natural grasp,
Dispelling the cares of the world’s woes.
Without the Mysterious Numinous Treasure,
Who could share in this journey?

Alas, within the hollow vastness,
Joy arises, then sorrow returns.
At dawn I depart from Dongmeng Ridge,
At dusk I gaze upon Xilong Mound.

I see not the Mother of the Nine Luminaries,
Nor the Northern Perfected wandering the Dao.
Vast the inquiry into the Great Image’s span,
The Two Qi suddenly encompass all.

Nine Dragons turn the Eastern Well,
The Heavenly Horse emerges from the Western Gully.
The Northern Emperor dispatches the heavenly hosts,
The Five Peaks align with the Mysterious.

Ten thousand demons have girded their sashes,
The Five Phases have long conspired.
War’s disasters spread across the heavens,
Myriad multitudes are already bound.

Above and below all receive the summons,
Swept clean without delay.
Alas, within these Five Perils,
Fate arrives without regard for kin or stranger.

I ascend the Eight Assemblies’ Palace,
Joining my company in the unseen.
Surveying those who pursue the ultimate learning,
Their blessed lands lend support.

Abandoning home to seek my Dao,
You may attain deliverance for your body.
Diligently cultivate the supreme scriptures,
When the Dao is perfected, we shall await one another.

Carefree, I observe the Phoenix Terrace,
Is this not a joyous journey?
In the great assembly of the Middle Prime,
The Middle Prime gathers in the Garden of Joy.

Above, the qi of the Eight Assemblies,
The Purple Phoenix dances in birth.
Golden branches cling to jade roots,
Seven treasures form blossoming bells.

Dragons leap beyond the utmost peaks,
Phoenixes’ cries startle ten thousand leagues.
I see not the departed wandering guests,
Only hear the phoenixes’ voices in the clouds.

Gong and shang harmonize of themselves,
Sounds and echoes naturally arise.
The Mysterious Song sings wondrous melodies,
Sorrow and joy weave into music.

I seek myself of my own accord,
Who knows the Perfected Ones’ numen?
Broidered clouds gird the night’s moon,
Purple radiance veils flying jade.

The Three Dawns illumine the great brilliance,
The Seven Primes adorn the Five Stars.
The numinous banners bear majestic light,
Flowing mists shroud the purple clarity.

I deem the Western Flower wondrous,
Yet it does not compare to the Purple Phoenix City.
Above dwell those who loosen their robes,
One glance brings joy for ten thousand ages.

Together we rejoice without end or kalpa,
Thus awakening heaven and earth’s overturning.
The numinous course has its own end,
The reckoning’s close comes from the Mysterious of its own.

Coming and going follow fate’s revolutions,
Why entangle oneself in sorrow?
Dispel cares beyond the Eight Wastes,
The Great Image does not deviate from the true.

Carefree in the Garden of Joy,
Who would claim kinship with sorrow?
The Five Perils are constant meetings,
Those who grieve are ever present.

Though gong and shang may not harmonize,
The great return’s principle is naturally balanced.
Thus I offer the sorrow-joy melodies,
To deliver the bodies of Dao learners.

Through ascetic practice, I study the numinous texts,
Their wondrous meanings naturally shine.
Simply wear the Unadorned Chapters,
And you may enter the Ford of No Sorrow.

Riding the void, I ascend Phoenix Terrace,
Gazing loftily upon the Tang’s reign.
What joy could surpass this joy?
Where lies sorrow amid such joy?

The Highest Jade Dawn’s Sorrow-Joy Melodies,
Born in emptiness upon Phoenix Terrace,
Numinous texts bright in the Five Directions,
Golden tones resound clearly through the Ten Heavens.

The Ninefold-Curved Perfected Ones of Jade Capital
All cast gold into tablets,
Inscribed with purple brush,
Joining voices to chant the Mysterious Song’s sorrow-joy melodies.
Their words are profound and recondite,
Their wondrous purport abysmally deep.
None but the Highest’s company
Could fathom their stanzas.

Only one whose golden name is Eastern Flower,
Whose jade title is Phoenix Gate,
May behold these texts.

Having received the Phoenix Qi’s Mysterious Mound Perfected Writ and the Numinous Banner Commanding Demons,
Reciting the Sorrow-Joy Melodies,
The Five Emperors guard the Perfected,
Heavenly demons show reverence and protection,
Escorting one to ascend as an immortal,
To attend the Sacred Lord in the Upper Clarity Palace,
And wander the halls of Phoenix Terrace.

Those who receive these texts
Should, on their own fate-day, the Grand Year-star, the Eight Nodal Days,
And on the fifth, fifteenth, and twenty-fifth days of each month,
Bathe, purify, and fast before entering the chamber.
First face east and recite the Green Emperor’s Melody, then bow to the Jade Perfected;
Turn south and recite the Red Emperor’s Melody, then bow to the Jade Perfected;
Turn west and recite the White Emperor’s Melody, then bow to the Jade Perfected;
Turn north and recite the Black Emperor’s Melody, then bow to the Jade Perfected;
Face the Grand Year-star and recite the Yellow Emperor’s Melody, then bow to the Jade Perfected.
After completing the Five Directions, return to face north and bow nine times to the Jade Dawn Lord,
Then look up and swallow qi nine times to finish.
Thus array the Five Emperors’ banners in the chamber’s five directions.

From *The Upper Clarity High Sage Jade Dawn Phoenix Terrace Unadorned Song Scripture*.

**Cavern-Real Turning Mystery Chapter**
The Most High unfolds the Mysterious Store,
Resplendent, the scriptures of the Perfected number.
Scattered, scattered, they fill the heavens’ reality,
Revered by the Ten Directions.

Without beginning, without end,
Without brightness, without darkness.
I ascend the Jade Capital’s terrace,
Carefree, I rest upon Kunlun.

Transcending the Yellow Springs’ winding capital,
The Demon Kings long to hear.
Seven ancestors receive transformation and birth,
Releasing my karmic grievances of past lives.

Entering, I rein in the flying Mysterious Radiance,
Exiting, I drive the floating purple clouds.
Double brilliance illumines the Jade Dawn,
Mysterious radiance opens the perfect clarity.

Far, far the Cavern-Real Palace,
Gleaming, gleaming the seven treasures’ essence.
One thought delivers from the Eight Perils,
Ever joining the Most High.

Spiraling, I offer the yellow radiance,
The sun’s flower blooms in the void’s midst.
The world knows the mixed and vulgar Dao,
None hear the Wisdom Sutra.

Great is the rebuke of the Perfected Precepts,
The Mysterious moves the Demon Kings to sincerity.
Ten thousand kalpas are but a single breath,
How could they span a thousand billion ages?

The Most High’s body is fundamentally nonbeing,
Dispersing form to deliver the weak and lost.

Masters of the Dao proclaim its arcane arts,
The Heavenly Worthy joins in praise and exaltation.
Those with karmic affinity manifest its scriptures,
Those without cause conceal them in the sutras.
Should one attain this Way,
A radiant halo crowns the head at once.
The body leaps beyond all ferry-crossings,
Assuming office in the Hall of Leisurely Transcendents.

Nonbeing in nonbeing ever abides in permanence,
Being in being rests securely in the wondrous.
Celestial brushes inscribe the supreme,
The Mysterious Tradition holds its essentials.
Revolving the Wheel of the Three Treasures,
Its brilliance shakes the ten directions.
The Most High gazes upon the Jade Capital,
The Demon Kings laugh in empty space.
The Heavenly Emperor clasps hands and chants,
The host of Perfected ride the void in whistling song.
Scattering blossoms in my very thought,
The Eight Vows transcend themselves.

Divine Transcendents ride the auspicious clouds,
Mounting dragons to tread the Mysterious Waves.
Harmonizing with the Real to display felicitous omens,
Washing their feet where men and gods converge.
Fortune’s response does not await my summons—
Thus the heavenly nets are cast wide.
Virtue crowns the Three Realms,
Even the Earth’s Net has been surpassed.
Inspired encounters gather the cloudlike Perfected,
The Lotus Sutra of Pure Wisdom blooms.
The supreme awakening of the four assemblies
Stretches beyond the Nine Ultimates.
Dark and bright surely have their reasons,
Yet where there is no darkness, there is no obscurity.
Swiftly the Wheel of the Mysterious returns,
Transcendent Realized Ones rejoice in the verdant flourishing.

Wandering in the boundless expanse,
Devas and humans see no boundary.
Subtle wonders rely on proclamation,
Devas and humans find their ford and shore.
Sailing the fathomless abyss,
Ever fearing the winds and waves may shift.
Yet the karmic affinity holds a marvelous method—
Who could calculate its wisdom and power?
Gently yielding to the Mysterious Azure,
Luminously the hidden causes are judged.
The stalwart stalks of the Perfected’s disciples,
Pluck the zither of emptiness in midair.
Reverent thoughts attend the ten directions,
The Mysterious abides—no envy touches me.

The Most High unfolds the Cavern Scriptures,
The worthy and wise return to their root affinity.
Desolate stands the garden of the Three Treasures,
Yet luxuriant flourish the fruits of my karma.
The Annalists and the Essence-Enterers,
With pristine substance give birth to golden bodies.
From kalpa’s end to kalpa’s beginning,
Ever more radiant grows the countenance of the numinous.
Rare deliverance bows to the Supreme,
The Treasure Scriptures descend to the Perfected.
The Dao’s groves embellish the Heavenly Capital,
Their light below illumines the earthly Transcendents.
Unhurried, they scatter their numinous majesty,
Vastly the Great Dharma is proclaimed.
The Most High surveys the ten directions,
Hushed and harmonious, the winds blend.
The halo of perfection mirrors the Three Luminaries,
The Perfected don the celestial robes.
The Demon Kings stand with clasped hands,
The Market Officers beside Fengdu’s capital.
Sun and moon veil their coursing radiance,
The seven treasures gleam without end.
All striving ceases in this hour,
Disasters vanish, hells fall silent.
In the boundless Heaven of No Shadow,
Even the honored cannot fathom.
The Three Treasures flourish through the ten directions,
Vast and clear in the empty midst.
Winding with the principles of transformation,
A single inspiration ascends the Dharma’s stream.

Vague and dim in the twilight,
The Four Great Elements arise with the times.
Emptiness and being—nothing is not possessed,
Towering like mountains and cliffs.
The Most High holds no lingering thought,
Quelling thoughts to return to the Great Vehicle.

For the ten directions, perform the Revolving Mysterious Rites of Praise:
Begin with the North, then Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, Above, and Below.
One hymn, one bow.

The *Revolving Mysterious* chapter emerges of itself, naturally thus.
It stood empty for nine thousand kalpas,
Until its scripture appeared.
The Primordial Heavenly King studied the Dao under the Most High,
And after attaining the Way, the Most High commanded the Primordial Heavenly King to compile and compose it,
To pair with the Great Precepts.
On one’s natal day, recite the Three Hundred Precepts,
And chant this scripture.
Practice at noon or midnight,
First purifying oneself, then performing the Dao.
If the natal day is unknown, use the day of Jiazi.
After ten years, one may perform the Dao on the first day of the first month.

**Twelve Gold Chapters**

Hushed, we admonish the Palace of Great Radiance,
Where golden towers gleam in the Purple Clarity.
The Transcendents’ chambers reflect the Primal Simplicity,
Four windows all of crimson jade.
Tossing the wheel across the Cavern Ford,
Reining the reins to dance the green chariot.
Jade blossoms fly like cloud-canopies,
The Western Consorts unfurl brocade banners.
Beyond the dust and filth,
Swiftly we enter the courtyard of the radiant ones.
Long-awaited karmic responses arrive in due time,
What is attained already dwells in the unseen.
Riding the winds toward the nine skies,
Together we feast on the cinnabar blossoms’ infants.
Turning to bid farewell to the world’s things,
How could we know the numinous in nonbeing?

Northward we ascend the Gate of Mysterious Darkness,
Hand in hand traversing the Lofty Web.
Fragrant smoke scatters the Eight Effulgences,
The Mysterious Wind stirs the crimson waves.
Gazing upward past the Luminous Ford,
Looking down upon the winding mountain vales.
Whistling songs resound above the clouds,
Phoenixes sing through the ninefold radiance.
Riding qi to float in the great void,
Why tread the mountain slopes?
With golden tablets we summon the feathered spirits,
Leading the troops to crush the myriad demons.
Rinsing and imbibing the halo of the Perfect Dawn,
Accumulating kalpas like sprouting buds.
In the clamor of rushing and striving,
Who understands what can be done?

The northern mound gathers cloudlike radiance,
Crimson trees bear purple blossoms.
Azure buds fall in the Phoenix Grove,
Jade stamens adorn the crags’ recesses.
The numinous towers soar into the great void,
Jasper chambers mingle with the Great Radiance.
Clouds rise within the winding chambers,
The Eight Winds scatter the dark sands.
The Ninefold Mist strums the Emperor’s Pond,
Dragons chant in harmonious measure.
Fanning the storm over the Five Peaks,
Wielding the tablets to subdue the myriad demons.
Glancing back in a moment’s span,
Suddenly kalpas have passed.
Alas for those born at dawn—
How could they know the span of ages?

The cornered radiance spreads through the Forest Palace,
The axle turns through the silent and obscure.
The supreme vision illumines the Six Courts,
Great and small all attain carefree ease.
Dragon pipes coil through the canopy clouds,
Tiger roars startle the myriad branches.
The Three Primes unfold the lofty chart,
Cinnabar clouds embellish the morning skies.
Feathered banners cross the Numinous Ford,
Purple chariots soar with blossoming plumes.
Reining the reins beyond the Nine Heavens,
Looking up and down in boundless solitude.
Dust and condemnation weave defilement,
Spirits perish, qi withers away.
Why not seek the distant chariot?
Eight thousand years are but a single morning.

Morning crosses the azure sea’s waves,
The flying wheel departs the green chambers.
Singing high the *Ode to Companions*,
We soar beyond the azure vastness.
Three pacts with the jade-sky guests,
Five covenants with the Eastern Florescence youths.
The feathered storm ascends the Emperor’s Dawn,
Feasting in this Palace of Vast Cold.
The Eight Sounds pluck the void,
Purple phoenixes sing the numinous wind.
Crimson clouds veil the bright radiance,
The Eight Effulgences fly through the great void.
Savoring the jasper springs’ ford,
Vast and elegant, returning to infancy’s simplicity.
Supreme joy unites the Five Spirits,
Ages accumulate like blades of grass.
Shedding the sandals—what difficulty?
Yet toil and sorrow lose the heavens’ midst.

Morning’s chariot rides the dawn’s radiance,
Leisurely reins set forth from the Purple Clarity.
The floating wheel gallops through the Great Radiance,
Raising the canopy over the Vast Cold’s courtyard.

Within the halls of the Highest Perfected, the imperial chambers are forbidden,
Palace walls summon the Four Numinous Ones.
Ten Perfections dance through the hollow void,
Wafting mist coils round brocade screens.
Tiger-fans stir the divine wind’s blessing,
Purple clouds wheel with paired dragons.
Swift as a glance to the eight directions,
A single look topples the camphor-tree of ages.

O reclusive youths of the Mysterious Contest,
Why not seek the Great Life?
The divine gardens bloom with hidden mushrooms,
The Kun Pool irrigates the fields of vision.
Gazing upward to the Jade Clarity’s gates,
Towering above the crimson ford.
Purple auroras illumine the winding seats,
Five clouds radiate the Nine Profounds.
Eight winds rise from the farthest reaches,
Mystic vapors linger ‘twixt emerald pavilions.

The Three Primes lodge in the Western Palace,
In Eastern Florescence dwells a fair one.
The Northern Darkness chants the Seven Whistles,
Bright Consort sings the Southern Perfected.
Striking the zhu-lute in harmony with the Vermilion Pitch,
Jade batons raise the six strings.
Conjoined in pact beyond fate’s course,
Together they resound on the phoenix’s peak.
In unison they summon the myriad demons,
Dwelling here with the black multitudes.
How difficult to transcend and come?
Yet thus they unlock boundless years.

Riding qi through the hollow void,
Mounting the light to rest in the Nine Heavens.
Lush and dense, the vast radiance’s plumes,
The dark canopy arises in the spaceless.
Eight mists swirl round the boundless wheel,
Its track lingering, defying time.
Striking the zhu-lute, the eight voids resound,
My steed too finds no ford.
Grasping the baton, I enter Eastern Florescence,
Evening feasts atop the Mystic Garden’s peak.
Girding my sash, I bear the Five Spirits,
Loosening my collar, I long for my beloved.
Dark resonance follows its own course,
Buoyantly, it too has its karmic ties.
Together we soar on swift pinions,
A single flap stirs billions.

Crimson light floats in the dark dawn,
Purple chariots ride the cloud-borne journey.
Looking up, I transcend the Golden Gates,
Gazing down, I behold the Western Florescence.
Eastern Florescence unfolds its fivefold radiance,
Divine light illumines the Seven Spirits.
Veiled reflections of the Three Floating Candles,
Flowing freely, they equal the dark and the bright.
Winds drum through the hollow void’s halls,
Incense smoke scatters in the jade courtyard.
Hand in hand with the Weaving Maid’s dance,
Twin sashes fall in brocade’s azure.
Primal circling of feathered banners,
Floral canopies follow the clouds’ tilt.
Feasting and resting beyond the ninefold bounds,
Right and wrong no longer concern me.
Embracing emptiness within the Mud-Pill,
My celestial form daily renews its infancy.
How much more the void’s defilements,
Within which bleakness breeds aimless life.

Fusang’s peaks rise in emerald emptiness,
Vermilion clouds bloom in faint light.
The Wave Terrace has its heights of void,
Four vistas mirror the lofty clarity.
Flying light reins the purple wheel,
Three Primes guide the cinnabar carriage.
Reclining in the Supreme Emperor’s halls,
Towering in the Celestial Mother’s courts.
Washing my feet in the azure rapids,
Raising the jade flagon of sweet wine.
At dawn’s curve, riding the wind’s fan,
Lightly, lightly, descending in time.
Briefly alighting amid earth’s mists,
Turning my chariot toward the Good Perfected.
Mystic gatherings convene of themselves,
Wandering freely through the dark and the hidden.
Only now do I know the bitterness of honor and disgrace,
Only now do I awaken to sorrow’s hastening of years.

The secluded chamber may be pure and still,
Nurturing the spirit, awaiting the sun’s fulfillment.
Why pursue the paths of the world,
Where a hundred ailments arise therefrom?
The Heavenly Court births golden blossoms,
Within, they manifest yin’s perversities.
The Jade Valley joins the Mysterious Realm,
Jasper qi mutually sustains its web.
Celestial Perfected stand in distant days,
Flying medicines spew forth numinous sands.
At dawn’s clarity, I harness the heavenly steed,
Turning my chariot toward the Divine Mystery’s home.
Immortal ones come to enter the chamber,
Again to extinguish the hundred perversities.

The Dao takes purification as foremost,
Diligent practice ascends the Golden Gates.
Thus is built the Great Dharma Bridge,
Universally ferrying all beings.
Repaying the kindness of past lives,
The Dao-heart arises transcendent.
Six fasts honor the hollow void,
Ten vigils move the gods to clarity.
The Five Elders inscribe the immortals’ names,
Cloud chariots welcome and receive.
The body soars to ascend the Mystic Capital,
Seven generations all attain liberation.

The hymns of the Highest Clarity’s Perfected Ones conclude.
