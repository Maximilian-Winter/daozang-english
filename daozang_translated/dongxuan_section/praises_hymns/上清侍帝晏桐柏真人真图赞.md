**Hymn of Praise to the Perfected Portrait of the Supreme Clarity Attendant of the Celestial Dawn, the Perfected One of Tung-pai**
*Recorded by:* Sima Chengzhen of White Clouds on Mount Tiantai

Those who attain the Dao and achieve perfection may conceal or reveal themselves. Ascending to spirit and transforming their form, they follow many arts and many paths. The Great Lord Mao left his kin to enter the sacred peaks, and when his immortal work was complete, he returned, riding a chariot of clouds in broad daylight. The Master of High Mound prepared his body to evade the world, and once his elixir was perfected, he did not return, driving dragons and cranes to wander the luminous realms and ascend in secret. Such wondrous and subtle manifestations serve to reward the diligence of Daoist scholars, while those who perish in the mundane world may cease their longing for separation in life. Some are bound by fate to differing destinies of light and shadow, and their course cannot be altered. Others, by nature, delight in distinctions of speech and silence, and reason allows them to follow their own inclination. The comings and goings of ancient immortals encompass both revelation and concealment, yet the records of their time rarely capture their depths. Thus, accounts may repeat or vary, and only by harmonizing their subtle shifts can one grasp their ultimate subtlety.

The Perfected One of Tung-pai, Lord Wang, was the Crown Prince Jin of King Ling of Zhou. According to the *Records of the Grand Historian*, the prince was sagely but died young. Yet the *Biographies of the Immortals* states that he concealed himself and ascended as a transcendent. These two accounts differ, but there is reason for it. The Grand Historian’s official history records his early death, while the Daoist scriptures document his later ascension as an immortal. Though the accounts of true immortals seem contradictory, even in the same era, the divergence between self and other, like tiles and jade, spans generations. Moreover, he was endowed with numinous *qi* from past lives, having long cultivated it before. Borrowing the womb of a mortal, he briefly embodied this world. As a child, he was already sagely—proof of his long-cultivated nature. At birth, he bore a beard—evidence of his former appearance. Refining his spirit to the subtlest realms, he eluded the riddles of immortality and the constraints of fate. He knew that the Emperor’s single act was a sign of his ethereal destiny, and he awaited Master Kuang’s three-year prophecy. He explained to the Emperor the intent behind his ephemeral form—how could he willingly abandon his soul? Yet Master Kuang’s cautious words on short-lived mortals made clear that he was not fated to die. Thus, he swiftly departed the mortal realm to return to the immortal realm, valuing true transcendence over the crown prince’s station. He lingered by the Luo River to compose his thoughts, delighting in the carefree melodies of his flute. Moved by the descent of Fu Qiu, he received the wondrous methods of transcending the world. Thus, he shed his form to feign death and withdrew to the mountains to cultivate the Dao. On the day he spread his wings, he bid farewell to the world and soared into the heavens. That he first died and later ascended as an immortal is no cause for doubt.

For this reason, the tomb at Jingling, though ancient, opened to reveal a flying sword. The shrine of the Ji clan stands to this day, its spirit still present. The means of his transformation and ascension are clearly evident in principle and fact.

Chengzhen, having long dwelled on Mount Song, admired the lofty seclusion of mountains and forests. Whenever he visited the temple halls, he revered the lingering numinous traces. Facing the wind and landscape with an empty heart, he recalled the seven days as if they were yesterday. Gazing at the clouds and sky with profound longing, he looked up to the Three Clarities and their boundless mystery. Later, by decree of the Jade Dawn, he was honored with the rank of Attendant and Right Assistant, assuming the office of the Golden Court to ascend the renowned mountain of Tung-pai. As overseer of the Five Peaks, he was served by all spirits. Where the Eight Caves converge, immortals gather in assembly. Zhou Ziyang received the talisman of plain melody, while Xia Mingchen was entrusted with the Yellow Water method. Those who shared a deep affinity transmitted secret instructions to fellow Daoists, while those who returned in sincerity revealed the hidden paths to the extraordinary courts. The numinous cavern was truly wondrous, and the Cinnabar Waters perfected the realm of the divine. The blessed land was marked by marvels, and yellow clouds shrouded the land of immortality. Forests, dwellings, and rock chambers provided resting places, while stone bridges and towering peaks recorded his ascents and wanderings. Thus, he sought the secluded and towering, making his abode in quietude. Embracing stillness and emptiness, he rarely engaged the senses. Studying the biographies of immortals, he traced the origins of the Yi and Luo. Revisiting the *True Declarations*, he admired the descent of the Hua Yang Perfected. With light brush and ink, he respectfully rendered their portraits. Daring to compose this hymn of praise, he hoped to express his sincere devotion.

Now, he burns incense to open the celestial vaults within the plain scrolls. Inwardly listening to the *qi* and contemplating, he offers his luminous presence to the Crimson Palace.

From his time in the world to his ascension as a perfected one, he created eleven portraits, compiling them into this single volume.

**Hymn of Praise to the Perfected Portrait of the Supreme Clarity Attendant of the Celestial Dawn, Right Assistant and Overseer of the Five Peaks, the Perfected Lord Wang, the Immortal of Tung-pai**

**First Portrait:**
In the twenty-third year of King Ling of Zhou, the Gu and Luo rivers threatened to destroy the royal palace. The king wished to dam them. The Crown Prince admonished him, saying: "This must not be done. I have heard that the ancient rulers of the people did not level mountains, did not fill marshes, did not block rivers, and did not drain wetlands. Furthermore, it is said: 'Those who rise must have the merit of Yu and Lü; those who fall must bear the failure of Gong and Gun.'"

"Now that I hold office, is it not true that I must indeed have some fault? Yet by disturbing the great spirits of the two rivers, I have caused them to vie in their brilliance and harm the royal palace. If the king adorns this, is it not impermissible?

Furthermore, it is said: 'Those who assist in offerings will be tasted; those who assist in breaches will be harmed.' If the king dams the state’s rivers to adorn the palace, this is assisting the state’s ruin. Will this not manifest disaster and bring about harm?

Since the time of our former kings—Li, Xuan, You, and Ping—greed has invited heavenly calamity, and it has not yet ceased. If I now manifest it further, I fear it will extend to our descendants and the royal house, becoming ever more debased."

The king ultimately dammed the rivers. Later, King Jing favored many sycophants, and disorder began from this. When King Jing passed, the royal house fell into great chaos. By the time of King Zhen Ding, it had become truly base.

The painting depicts the palaces and gates of the Zhou court, the Gu and Luo rivers converging, and the gradual ruin of the royal precincts. Palace attendants, bearing earth on their backs, seek to dam the rivers. The Crown Prince, clad in full regalia, stands before King Ling to remonstrate.

**Hymn of Praise:**

Endowed with divine youth and sagely wisdom, he succeeded with radiant brilliance and keen discernment. He admonished against damming the waters, earnestly remonstrated against palace embellishments—yet how was his counsel not heeded? Instead, greater works were undertaken. His forewarnings of calamity and ruin proved true, leading indeed to baseness and destitution.

Second: When Duke Ping of Jin sent Shu Yu to Zhou, he met the Crown Prince and spoke with him. After five praises and three refusals, Shu Yu withdrew in hesitation, his words unfulfilled. Returning, he told the Duke: "The Crown Prince is fifteen years of age, yet I could not converse with him." Then Master Kuang said: "Let your servant go blind and attend him." Arriving, he asked about the conduct of the noble man, the virtue of Yao and Shun, and what makes kings and lords esteemed or debased. He further inquired about warmth, reverence, sincerity, and diligence—how unchanging virtue unfolds things from their beginning, how learning below ascends to the imperial dawn, and who since ancient times has equaled the Son of Heaven. The Crown Prince answered each question with clarity and reasoned eloquence. Master Kuang, struck with awe, stamped his feet and exclaimed: "Excellent! Excellent!" Then, with a start, he rose and said: "Though blind, your servant begs leave to return." The Crown Prince asked: "I hear you discern a person’s lifespan—pray tell me mine." Master Kuang replied: "Your voice is clear yet impure, your complexion red and pale like fire—you will not live long." The Crown Prince said: "In three years, I shall ascend as a guest to the Emperor’s abode. Be cautious in speech, lest misfortune befall you." Master Kuang returned home and died within three years.

The painting depicts the Eastern Palace’s halls, the Crown Prince seated within, and the exchanges with Shu Yu and Master Kuang. Master Kuang is shown stamping his feet in admiration.

**Hymn of Praise:**

**Hymn of Praise:**
His learning vast and penetrating, his discourse on things profound and lucid.
Shu Yu was left speechless, Master Kuang could not refute.
He divined the hidden wonders of the spirit, misjudged the essence of voice and form.
The guest’s ascent to the Emperor’s abode had its appointed time—how could the blind seer fathom it?
The *Liexian Zhuan* states: The Crown Prince loved to play the sheng, mimicking the phoenix’s cry. Roaming between the Yi and Luo rivers, the Daoist Master Fuqiu met him and led him up Mount Songgao. At that time, Fuqiu had just descended to transmit secret arts; once his practice was complete, he planned to feign death and achieve liberation through *shijie*. Thus he foretold to Master Kuang the three-year term.
The painting depicts the Crown Prince playing the sheng, roaming by the Yi and Luo, and Master Fuqiu descending to receive him.

**Hymn of Praise:**
His rank lodged in the heir’s palace, his name inscribed in the halls of immortals.
His aspirations soared to the Milky Way, his heart wearied of city walls.
He tuned his sheng to the phoenix’s song, yearning for truth by the Luo’s banks.
Fuqiu descended to bestow his teachings, entrusting his form to liberation.
When he told Master Kuang, “In three years, I shall ascend as a guest to the Emperor’s abode,” he meant that within three years, he would first achieve *shijie* before ascending as a guest to the Emperor—hence his veiled prophecy.
Thereupon, he secretly shed his form, leaving only a sword and a crow; his true body concealed, he withdrew to Mount Song. To make his kin forget the pain of parting, he feigned death to sever their longing. The Dao is not easily attained—only through accumulated study does one ascend as an immortal.
The painting shows the palace halls, the Crown Prince’s outward death, the ministers’ wailing, and the Crown Prince journeying southeast with Fuqiu toward Mount Songgao.

**Hymn of Praise:**
His sword and staff held arcane arts, his talismans and elixirs myriad in method.

Before his form had fully transformed, he silently examined his molted essence.
Seeking a master to extend the Dao, he bid farewell to kin and love alike.
Secluded in the mountains, he found ease; the tomb’s sorrow was but a fleeting grief.

Fifth Record states: Fuqiu Gong received him on Mount Songgao for over thirty years. Later, when sought in the mountains, he appeared to Huan Liang, saying, “Tell my family: on the seventh day of the seventh month, await me at the summit of Weishi Mountain.”
The Crown Prince concealed himself on Mount Songgao, studying under Fuqiu Gong.
Through concentrated meditation, he refined his spirit; through elixirs, he transformed his substance.
Once his Daoist practice was complete, the time for his immortal ascension drew near.
Thus he emerged to meet Huan Liang, bidding him inform his family.
The painting depicts Mount Songgao, where he pursued his studies—
amidst rocky forests and dwellings, scriptures and alchemical crucibles lay in solemn order, with Fuqiu Gong seated among them.
Before the altar, a platform was raised, where the Prince sat in meditation, burning incense and refining his spirit.
Another scene shows the Prince emerging from the mountain, then meeting Huan Liang in conversation.

**Hymn of Praise:**
Dwelling in the mountains, he concealed his traces, studying the Dao to refine his form.
Years passed, spanning decades, as his practice aligned with the numinous.
He foretold the seventh day, when he would ascend to the Three Clarities.
Huan Liang returned with the message, and the kingdom awaited his arrival.

Sixth Record states: Indeed, he mounted a white crane and alighted upon the mountain’s peak. Gazing from afar, none could approach; he raised his hand in farewell to the people of his time, lingering for days before departing.
A shrine was erected on Weishi Mountain—first, he feigned death and concealed himself; later, he revealed his immortality.
His divine transformations knew no bounds; his spiritual changes followed their own course.
Thus he could descend to bid farewell to the people of Hou, raising his hand to leave a trace of affection.
Ascending to the clouded heavens, he rode the crane into the vanishing light.
The people of his time cherished his lingering traces, preserving them in a shrine.
His sacred image could be passed to later generations, for his spirit and qi remained.
The words of Master Kuang on his untimely end were like the clam and oyster;
the Crown Prince’s prophecy of ascending as a guest to the Emperor was now as clear as the tortoise and crane.

The painting shows the Prince riding a crane, alighting upon the summit of Weishi Mountain, raising his hand in farewell to the people of his time.
It also depicts the imperial procession of the Zhou kingdom, along with the gathered crowds, gazing from afar yet unable to approach—
and the Prince, guiding the crane as he ascends to heaven.

**Hymn of Praise:**
He captivated the kingdom, perching his crane upon the mountain’s peak.
From afar, he raised his hand in farewell, forever severing the bonds of mortal years.
Lingering for days, he left traces of affection, then soared through the Three Heavens.
His solitary carriage roamed boundlessly, while the multitude was left in sorrowful longing.

The Seventh Heaven of Supreme Clarity, the Highest Sage, the Supreme Jade Dawn, the Mysterious August Lord of the Great Dao—
He is the sovereign of the myriad Dao, revered by all perfected beings, the foundation upon which the world’s teachings rest.
Those who attain the Dao and ascend as immortals must journey to the Golden Portals to pay homage and receive their celestial duties.
There, offices are divided and ranks assigned according to the depth of virtue and merit; vestments and ritual forms follow the hierarchy of grades and bestowals.
Thus, crowns differ in design, staffs in color; chariots and canopies vary in form, dragons and cranes serve as distinct mounts—
all ordered by degree to facilitate ascent and descent.
Herein, the Prince reverently received the sacred decree.
The painting depicts the celestial palaces of the Supreme Clarity Heaven, portraying the Lord of the Dao in form.
Perfected beings stand in attendance, two youths at his side, together bearing a tray upon which rests a jade tablet.
Another perfected one stands aside, proclaiming the decree to the Prince.

**Hymn of Praise:**
Form and sound enter the wondrous, the Dao perfected to ascend as true.
Paying homage at the Golden Portals, receiving the jade decree from the Jade Dawn.
Virtue and merit thus established, office and rank duly observed.
Rituals aligned in reverence, spirit congealed through ten thousand kalpas.

The Eighth: At the Golden Portals, the Prince knelt to receive his investiture, bestowed with the title:
*Attendant to the Emperor of the Dawn, Overseer of the Five Peaks, Right Assistant to the Perfected of Paulownia-Cypress.*
Having received the sacred decree, he prepared to depart for the Grotto Palace.
Feathered staffs led the way, rainbow banners followed behind; the dragon chariot descended in splendor, the crane’s reins circled in flight.
Divine immortals stood in attendance, reed pipes and flutes played in harmony.
Descending through the Great Clarity upon clouds, he steered toward the Grotto Heavens, his carriage steady.
Truly, the numinous power of the Dao and the grandeur of the celestial procession were a magnificent sight.
The painting shows the Prince riding a cloud chariot with a feathered canopy, divine immortals in escort, banners and staffs leading the procession.
Dragons and cranes soar in flight as they descend from heaven, bound for the Grotto Palace of Paulownia-Cypress Mountain.

**Hymn of Praise:**
The bestowed decree received, feathered regalia complete.
Helmets and armor gleam upon the floating carriage, dragons and cranes race with reins.
Banners and staffs lead the procession, immortal gatherings assemble in splendor.
Descending from heaven by celestial steps, gazing toward the mountain to assume his post.

The Ninth: Mount Tiantai, also called Paulownia-Cypress Mountain.
Within the mountain lies a grotto palace named the Golden Court, where radiant essence lingers at dawn, its light illuminating the grotto realm.
Jasper terraces and jade chambers gleam with clarity, their halls resplendent.
Its springs flow with stone marrow and golden essence; its trees bear jade buds and lush verdure.
Truly, it is a blessed realm for nurturing the true, a numinous dwelling for attaining the divine.
Here the Prince dwells, governing the hidden and manifest, serving as assistant to the Emperor of the Dawn.
At times, he attends court and oversees the affairs of the Five Peaks.
All spirits receive their duties in this place.
The painting depicts Paulownia-Cypress Mountain and the Golden Court Grotto Palace.
The Prince sits within the palace, surrounded by immortal attendants.
The Lords of the Five Peaks, each leading their subordinate spirits, come to pay homage.

**Hymn of Praise:**
The mountain holds a jade grotto, the palace named Golden Court.
The Nine Heavens align in resonance, the Three Dawns conceal their essence.
Serving the Emperor in this duty, assisting the Perfected in steadfastness.
Overseeing the Five Peaks, commanding the hundred spirits.

The Tenth: The Perfected of Purple Yang, Zhou Jishan, once entered Paulownia-Cypress Mountain.
There, he encountered the Perfected Prince Wang, who bestowed upon him a plain memorial inscribed with cinnabar talismans.
Later, the Attendant of the Luminous Dawn, Xia Fu, entered Paulownia-Cypress Mountain and met the Perfected Prince Wang, who taught him the method of the Yellow Water and Cloud Elixir.
The painting shows the Perfected Zhou Jishan, clad in the robes of a Daoist, on Paulownia-Cypress Mountain.
He meets the Perfected Prince Wang, who holds in his left hand a plain memorial with cinnabar talismans, about to bestow it upon Zhou.
Zhou kneels in reverence to receive it.
Another scene depicts Xia Fu in ancient attire, encountering the Prince.
The Prince holds a scroll, about to present it to Xia, who kneels with both hands raised to accept it.
Both Zhou and Xia are dressed as mountain recluses, each with a staff placed beside them, kneeling upon the stone before the Prince.
The Prince wears the robes of a perfected being, accompanied by three to five immortal attendants at his side.

**Hymn of Praise:**
Zhou sought the Dao, receiving the cinnabar talismans.
Xia pursued immortality, mastering the Yellow Water’s mysteries.
Refining form through wondrous arts, none achieve without a teacher.
Hidden resonance thus connects, the appointed hour may be awaited.

The Eleventh: In the third year of the Xingning era of the Jin dynasty, a Daoist practitioner named Yang resided on Mount Mao, where his earnest devotion summoned many perfected beings to descend and bestow teachings.
On the twenty-sixth day of the sixth month of that year, the Perfected Prince Wang of Paulownia-Cypress, accompanied by other perfected beings, descended to Yang’s dwelling—but did not speak to him.
Yang recorded the event, noting: *There was one whose youthful appearance was extraordinary.
He wore a lotus crown, a crimson robe adorned with white pearls, and a sword at his waist.
Later, he spoke much of the affairs of Golden Court Mountain.*
The perfected beings then proclaimed:
*"The Eight Vastnesses and Four Extremes are distant and boundless, their numinous shores remote.
Wondrous words sprout like buds, jade tones resound with brilliance.
At dawn, they soar through the clouds; pure and mysterious qi gathers.
Bestowed with office in the Jade Void, the heart sheds its burdens.
Mired beyond the subtle net, harmony congeals beyond the still waves.
Those who attain this shall surely ascend the vast heavens, traversing the true courts.
The Three Primes may be seen, and immortal names may be established.
But if the heart is reckless and wandering, the eyes fixed upon sensual forms—
if in motion one shares the fate of nets and snares, in stillness contends with strife—
then the path to immortality remains distant, and the span of life grows ever more constrained.
Take heed, and be vigilant."*
They further proclaimed:
*"Those who possess the Dao must delve deeply into its numinous mysteries, dwelling in the heart beyond worldly affairs.
If one merely savors diligence in trivial matters, clinging to the dregs of the world, it is but a fleeting indulgence."*
They also descended with songs and verses, which are not recorded here in full.
The painting depicts Yang on Mount Mao, at the altar where he practiced the Dao.
The Perfected Prince Wang descends to meet him, wearing a lotus crown, a crimson robe adorned with white pearls, and a sword at his waist.
Yang holds paper and brush before him, recording the event.
His robes follow the style of a true immortal, and his sword is depicted according to the patterns described in the scriptures.

**Hymn of Praise:**
The true immortals are not distant; resonance is but a thread of subtlety.
Answering the hidden resolve, they descend in numinous form.

"True teachings are set forth in words,
both in hymns and in narratives.
The vision does not linger long—
the pure and true return to the One.
Here ends the *Hymn of Praise to the Perfected Portrait of the Upper Clarity’s Attendant to the Celestial Emperor, the True Person of Tongbai.*"
