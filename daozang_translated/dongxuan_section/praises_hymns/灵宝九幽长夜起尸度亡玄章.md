# 灵宝九幽长夜起尸度亡玄章

**The Mysterious Chapter of the Numinous Treasure for Deliverance from the Nine Dark Realms of the Long Night’s Reanimated Corpse**

Vast and boundless, the Three Heavens above,
The Dao’s radiance illumines the empty glow.
Immortal beings emerge through parting clouds,
Jade maidens descend from the numinous gate.
How distant the Brahmanic chants resound,
In profusion the five-colored banners wave.
Gazing from the moon’s edge upon the Three Realms,
The Middle Prime is far from tranquil.
No hymns of praise are heard—
Only the mournful wails of lamentation.
Swiftly departed, with no chance to remain,
To whom may one complain of life’s fleeting haste?
In former lives, no merit was cultivated,
And when blessings are exhausted, calamity follows.
The three *hun* and seven *po* scatter—
Far and distant, where may they find refuge?

Recite the scriptures, uphold the Three Treasures,
And naturally meet one’s predestined return.
Establish the fast, bestow great alms,
And the Five Aggregates shall surely reanimate the corpse.
Karmic retribution knows no near nor far—
With sincere devotion, the time of reunion shall come.
With death, swiftly deliver them,
That they may ascend to the towering heights of Heaven.

The disciple bows three times to the east,
Eradicating the sins of thirty thousand kalpas of life and death.

Deep and distant, the Supreme Terrace,
Vast and boundless, the hall within the clouds.
Gazing upward at the Great Luo Palace,
One sees only the chambers of the immortals.
In Jambudvīpa, many are the wicked—
The wicked shall surely perish first.
Heaven’s judgment makes no distinction,
For good and evil may dwell in the same land.
All stems from the failure to accumulate goodness,
As the *hun* drifts, wandering the Eight Wastes.
Facing death, suddenly they are gone—
Even the mighty cannot resist.
Karmic conditions depart of their own accord,
Neither father nor mother can bear the burden.
Pondering the suffering of the dead,
Grief pierces the five emotions.

Above lies seven feet of earth,
The burial mounds stretch endlessly.
Thirty-six generations diverge,
Seven ancestors scatter apart.
May they escape the Five Paths,
And follow the sages through the Ten Directions.

The disciple bows six times to the north,
Eradicating the sins of thirty kalpas of life and death.

In the Middle Prime, many are the wicked—
The wicked shall surely perish first.
Life passes like a flickering candle,
The *hun* and *po* return to the boundless void.
Karmic conditions follow past deeds,
How can suffering and joy be constant?
Fools do no good,
And after death, their hearts are crushed with sorrow.
Alas! The parting of life and death,
Wailing and weeping break the human heart.
Vast and distant, Heaven and Earth divide—
Who can bear this suffering?
The Great Sage pities all,
Commanding the Kings of the Five Paths.
Each bears the ledger of life and death,
Arriving at the Hall of the Long Night.
Summoning the Overseer of Execution,
The Ox-Head guards of Mount Tai,
And restraining the officials of the Three Realms,
The Dragon Courier proclaims to the Ten Directions.
The dead have suffered enough—
Swiftly deliver them to the Southern Palace.
Clothed and fed from Heaven’s kitchen,
Lifetimes after lifetime, they shall dwell in realms of bliss.

The disciple bows three times to the west,
Eradicating the sins of twelve kalpas of life and death.

Lofty and remote, the Three Heavens above,
Towering and majestic, how sublime!
Of the great sins under Heaven,
None surpasses the betrayal of loyalty and filial piety.
For ten thousand kalpas, they enter the Long Night,
Forever barred from reanimation.
If such transgressions existed in past lives,
Calamity shall pursue them in this one.
Thus, their years are cut short in their prime,
As *hun* and *po* scatter together.
Parents, spouse, and children part,
And the spirit finds no refuge.
Life ends like a mountain’s collapse,
Like waters flowing ever eastward.
Thus, ponder the suffering of the dead—
Bitterly, it moves one to sorrow.
Beneath the pines and cypresses,
When shall they return from the long sleep?

The disciple bows three times to the southeast,
Eradicating the sins of eighteen kalpas of life and death.

The joys of Heaven’s halls are boundless,
Yet in Jambudvīpa, the Five Desires abound.
What misfortune did they commit in past lives,
That their lives ended so swiftly?
Where do the *hun* and *po* flee,
And to which hell do the spirits drift?
Parents, spouse, and children part,
Separation like a collapsing house.
Amidst the Three Realms’ vast expanse,
To whom do the spirits belong?
Fools see nothing,
And their words chill the heart and eyes.
Only by being born in the Southern Palace,
Lifetime after lifetime, may they feast on Heaven’s bounty.

The disciple bows three times to the north,
Eradicating the sins of a thousand kalpas of life and death.

From what origin did their past lives arise,
That in this life, they met the pure Dao?
Through the guidance of an enlightened teacher,
They received the wondrous and mysterious treasure.
Yet how deep were their karmic roots,
That they were suddenly cut down before old age?
Swiftly, their flourishing years were severed,
And their lives ended so prematurely.
The *hun* and *po* enter the Long Night,
The spirit wanders the Five Paths.
The Four Great Elements scatter here,
The Six Realms traverse suffering and torment.
Lifetime after lifetime, they wail in sorrow,
Their past selves grieving in their hearts.
Why not deliver the deceased?
Wealth and possessions are but grass.
Establish the fast, bestow great alms,
And lifetime after lifetime, they shall meet their teacher’s protection.

The disciple bows nine times to the north,
Eradicating the sins of thirty kalpas of life and death.

All seek the Dao,
Yet their hearts are not sincere in seeking.
Envy, hatred, and the Three Poisons arise,
Casting them into the City of Doubt.
Seated, they utter empty words,
And the Nine Dark Realms tremble in alarm.
The dead enter evil paths—
When shall they gaze upon the Great Clarity?
Alas! The suffering of the dead,
How dark the groves and mounds!
Today, deliver the deceased,
Only wishing for their next rebirth.

The disciple bows twelve times to the north,
Eradicating the sins of forty-nine kalpas of life and death.

In past lives, no merit was cultivated,
And in this life, they endure constant suffering.
How grievous the pain of the dead,
As they revolve through the mechanism of the Five Paths!
Like water pouring into the sea,
Once gone, when shall they return?
Spouse and children part thus,
Parents—who shall know them?
In the dark Long Night,
How vast the burial mounds!
The living weep day and night,
Wishing for their reanimation.
Alas! The suffering of the dead—
Swiftly, it moves one to sorrow.

The disciple bows three times to the south,
Eradicating the sins of thirty kalpas of life and death.

Why do the living find joy,
While the dead endure such suffering?
Beneath the dark and distant groves,
Above lies the fleeting earth.
In the depths of the Yellow Springs,
Where do the spirits turn?
Spouse, children, and parents part,
Ultimately falling among the seven ancestors.
Breath follows the wind and dust,
And the *hun* and *po*—to whom do they belong?
The dead shall not live again,
Gazing at Heaven—Heaven has no pillars.
The clay rooster shall not crow,
The wooden man shall not speak.
Alas! It wounds the human heart,
Bitterly, it severs the liver and spine.
Establish the fast to deliver the deceased—
Where may one leave their lingering attachments?

May the deceased attain a corporeal form once more,
Ascend as an immortal, and deliver the seven ancestors.
The disciple bows twelve times to the south,
Eradicating the sins of seventy-two kalpas of life and death.

The foolish in this turbid world,
Inverted in perception, how can they know the truth?
They know not father and mother,
Nor lord and minister.
They comprehend not the matters of past and future,
Nor distinguish the old from the new.
Clinging to ignorance, their lives are cut short,
And their *hun* and *po* sink into perdition.
The Five Paths divide their course,
Shouldering the long night’s endless burden.
Only the wailing for the dead is heard,
No joyful souls are seen.
Unmet by a master of past lives,
In an instant, their spirit perishes.
Today, for the deliverance of the deceased,
May their risen corpse and soul be seen.
Conceived in this very hour,
They soar in but a moment’s flight.
Ever to attend the Most High,
Dispelling sorrow at the Northern Gate.
Yet, bearing the talisman, they turned from their master,
And for generations, the seven ancestors remain benighted.

The disciple bows twelve times to the northwest,
Eradicating the sins of thirty kalpas of life and death.
In former lives, they delighted in killing,
Their lives cut short, resenting the gods.
The reckless speak of betraying their master,
For ten thousand kalpas, tormented by the soldiers of the Nine Darknesses.
Their souls become vicious beasts,
For countless ages, unable to assume a virtuous form.
In this life, they die young,
Enduring all five sufferings without exception.
Their *hun* and *po* return to Heaven and Earth,
But where does their spirit find rebirth?
The Great Sage pities them in sorrow,
Alas! It wounds the human heart.
Loose tongues slander others,
Their clamorous voices harm the living.
Today, for the deliverance of the deceased,
May they regain a human form.
The seven ancestors return to the Southern Palace,
Welcomed by the Three Heavens and Nine Dragons.

The disciple bows nine times to the west,
Eradicating the sins of thirty kalpas of life and death.
Far, far above, the Terrace of the Nine Heavens,
Towering, the Purple Phoenix City.
Alas! The suffering of the Three Realms,
Sorrow and calamity converge.
I mourn and ask the foolish of this world,
Why do they not seek long life?
Disbelieving the Great Sage’s teachings,
They suddenly depart, the Four Elements scattered.
All day, they commit evil deeds,
Unmindful of their lives’ impending ruin.
Boiling cauldrons and sword-lined trees,
Even their pleas for mercy go unheeded.
Today, for their deliverance,
May they regain a human form.

The disciple bows nine times to the east,
Eradicating the sins of three kalpas of life and death.
Destiny’s course, inner and outer,
The majestic Great Luo Heaven.
Therein dwell the deathless ones,
Seated upright for countless ages.
Yet, bearing the master’s teachings, they betrayed them,
And for generations, linger in the long night.
Amidst the Five Paths and Three Ways,
Drawn and bound by the Nine Darknesses.
Such sinners as these,
How can they attain immortality in the kalpas of water?
Today’s untimely death,
Stems from the causes of former lives.
Envious of the talented and wise,
They cut short their own lives.
When the great assembly’s time arrives,
The demon-slayers will show no mercy.
Having failed to accumulate good deeds,
Even in haste, no grace is granted.
Establish the fast to deliver the deceased,
Bestow alms to open the Dao’s gate.

The disciple bows three times to the west,
And the departed shall attain liberation.
Heaven and Earth endure forever,
The Three Luminaries shine resplendently.
The Five Phases align with the four seasons,
The mysterious workings never decay.
What sin has the deceased committed,
To suddenly fall into the cold courtyard?
They know not wife and children,
Nor recognize father and elder brother.
The Four Elements swiftly depart,
The body disperses, yet the name remains.
On what do their *hun* and *po* rely?
Where does their spirit find rebirth?
Today, for their deliverance,
May they regain a human form.

The disciple bows nine times to the west,
Eradicating the sins of ten thousand kalpas of life and death.
The Four Noble Truths guide the Brahmanic practices,
The Six Perfections transcend worldly traces.
The Three Poisons remain unchecked,
What use is bearing the Three Caverns’ teachings?
Serving the master with a self-centered heart,
They cannot ride the Nine Dragons.
Thus, their lives cut short in death,
They rush headlong through the Five Paths’ crossroads.
With a doubting heart,
How can they cross the flood of disaster?
Today, for the deliverance of the deceased,
May they behold the Immortal Lords.

The disciple bows nine times to the west,
Eradicating the sins of thirty thousand kalpas of life and death.
All seek life,
Yet the foolish gain no benefit.
Bearing the registers, they envy their master,
For generations, estranged from the sages.
Though they aspire to soar,
They cannot ascend the Jade Calendar.
Thus, their lives cut short in death,
Their names inscribed in the Nine Darknesses’ ledgers.
Their *hun*, *po*, and spirit scatter,
When shall the long night release them?
In life, what did they plan?
Ever greedy and miserly with wealth.
Once gone, for all time,
How can they know wood from stone?
Today, for their deliverance,
May their misfortunes and transgressions be absolved.

The disciple bows twelve times to the west,
Eradicating the sins of three thousand kalpas of life and death.
Heavenly beings descend to transform,
Yet the foolish do not study.
Each seeks to profit the world and nourish themselves,
Grasping at fleeting gains.
They vie in jealousy for fame and rank,
Each boasting, striving to outdo the other.
Disrespecting masters and slighting friends,
For ten thousand kalpas, they cannot attain immortality.
In death, they enter the Nine Darknesses,
For generations, sinking into the abyss of the long night.
Their *hun* and *po* rush through the Five Paths,
Through boiling cauldrons and knife-lined mountains.
Today, for the deliverance of the deceased,
May the departed ascend to Heaven.
May all sins be absolved,
And they wander freely before the Most High.

The disciple bows three times to the east,
Eradicating the sins of ninety kalpas of life and death.
The Four Talismans are the foundation of practice,
The Six Perfections all radiate mysterious light.
Receiving the Dao with an uncompassionate heart,
They shorten their own lives.
With doubt lingering in their hearts,
How can they avoid an early death?
Serving the master as an ordinary person,
Their errors bring forth calamity.
Stingy and greedy, they fail to make offerings,
For generations, they encounter famine and desolation.
Loose tongues reveal secret teachings,
In the next life, they fall into boiling cauldrons.
Today, for the deliverance of the deceased,
May they soon be reborn in Heaven.
As daughters, they become noblewomen,
As sons, they become lords and kings.

The disciple bows three times to the south,
Eradicating the sins of ten kalpas of life and death.
When the deceased first entered the palace of death,
The living performed meritorious deeds for them.
Monthly, they are delivered,
Freed from the crossroads of the Five Paths.
On the six fast days and ten auspicious days,
And the three sevens, calamities are averted.
On *gengshen* and *jiazi* days,
No Perfected One fails to attend.
Today, for the deliverance of the deceased,
May they ride the Nine Dragons.
Meeting the Most High in life and death,
For generations, may they behold the Immortal Lords.

The disciple bows nine times to the north,
Eradicating the sins of a thousand kalpas of life and death.
The wise accumulate myriad good deeds,
And through good deeds, attain immortality.
If the dead are not delivered,
How can their *hun* and *po* ascend?
In former lives, they did no good,
And now they wander at Hell’s gate.
I ask, what sin have they committed?
It lies in their careless words.

Eternally bound in the Nine Dark Realms,
When shall they ascend as immortals again?
Adrift within the Three Wretched Paths,
Dragged by the Six Bandits’ chains.
Today, we deliver them,
Practicing the Dao to return to Nature’s embrace.
The rites of three, five, seven, and nine,
Establishing fasts to cultivate fields of blessing.

The disciple bows nine times to the south,
Eradicating the sins of forty kalpas of life and death.
The human body is like the five grains,
Turning in their destined cycles.
Sown with depth or shallowness,
Good and evil each take form.
Fool and sage stand worlds apart,
As do the strong and the frail.
Iron may be soft or hard,
As water may be muddy or clear.
Among men, some are greedy and reckless,
While others are virtuous, steadfast, and true.
Only the living know joy,
Never do the dead see glory.
In the endless night of darkness,
When will the kalpas’ wheel cease turning?
The Most High pities all,
Alas, how sorrowful the human condition!

The disciple bows three times to the east,
Eradicating the sins of six kalpas of life and death.
Jambudvīpa is no land of blessing,
Where sinners torment one another.
Unknowing of life’s brevity,
They vie only for fame and gain.
With selfish hearts, they envy the good,
Seeking fleeting glory for themselves.
Demanding others’ offerings,
Unmindful of their great fate’s collapse.
Rushing to advance themselves,
They incur the gods’ reproach.
Suddenly, they enter the eternal dark,
Where the Yellow Springs stretch boundless.
Pity the foolish of this world,
For this body cannot long endure.
Those who practice good and attain immortality,
Stand firm for ten thousand generations.

The disciple bows three times to the west,
Eradicating the sins of three kalpas of life and death.
The Nine Dark Realms teem with the wicked,
While the good do not dwell there.
Dragons shun barren hills,
And sacred fish avoid stagnant wells.
In former lives, they lacked merit,
Denied the celestial kitchens’ fare.
With careless words, they slandered their masters,
And death came in an instant.
Their *hun* and *po* wander the Five Paths,
Their spirit returns to emptiness.
Adrift in the Nine Dark Realms,
For ten thousand kalpas, they traverse the Three Wretched Paths.
Today, we deliver the deceased,
May they follow the dragon and wild duck.

The disciple bows seven times to the north,
Eradicating the sins of ten thousand kalpas of life and death.
Endlessly, they guard the coffin,
Dimly glimpsing the Purple Court.
Those who follow the Dao and seek the highest immortals,
First find an enlightened master.
Bearing the *Yuji* Covenant at their waist,
They hold all the sacred scriptures.
Skilled in a hundred arts,
They too may master the Dao.
Yet how the dead suffer,
Losing all merit and name in an instant.
Today, we deliver the deceased,
May they all ascend to the Phoenix City.

The disciple bows three times to the north,
Eradicating the sins of ten thousand kalpas of life and death.
Immortals live for ten thousand kalpas,
Yet fools remain unaware.
Clutching the covenant without compassion,
They court their own destruction.
With their tongues, they slander others,
Bringing swift death—who is to blame?
A fierce tiger cannot be tethered,
Nor a divine dragon restrained.
This awaits the worthy and sage,
Not for fools to ride.
Pity the suffering of the dead,
As their spirits race through the Five Paths.
Today, we seek to deliver them,
To ascend as immortals, ever free.

The disciple bows seven times to the west,
Eradicating the sins of thirty thousand kalpas of life and death.
All men must die,
For all things are impermanent.
Even sages undergo *shijie*,
Transforming to ascend to heaven.
The heavy in sin meet early death,
While the good enjoy prolonged life.
Wealth and poverty, high and low,
All depend on the strength of one’s fortune.
The wicked and stubborn reject the Dao,
How then can they meet the Immortal Kings?
Great compassion pities all,
Breaking hearts with sorrow.
The deliverance rites now complete,
Each bows in reverence to the Jade Emperor.

The disciple bows nine times to the northwest,
Eradicating the sins of a thousand kalpas of life and death.
The *Lingbao* Mysterious Chapter for the Deliverance of the Dead from the Nine Dark Realms and the Rising of the Corpse is now complete.
