# 洞玄灵宝升玄步虚章序疏

**Preface and Commentary on the *Dongxuan Lingbao Shengxuan Buwu Zhang***

The *Shengxuan* is the universal designation of wondrous enlightenment, while *Buwu* is the ultimate attainment of divine creation. *Sheng* (ascending) signifies verification without error; *Xuan* (mysterious) denotes profound union with the supreme virtue. *Bu* (stepping) is the term for traversing, and *Wu* (void) is the appellation for transcending all bounds.

It is also said that *Zhang* (verses) illumine and reveal, extolling the boundless flow of the Dharma-body. When the first notes of the mystical melody arise, the eight directions harmonize as one; when the divine resonance unfolds anew, the ten blossoms vie in gathering. Spiraling through the Mystic Capital to cast forth numinous power, treading the cloud-lattices to bear the契, this is truly the ritual ground for gladdening the spirit and purifying the will, the wondrous realm for dissolving form and shattering the mind—hence the title *Shengxuan Buwu Zhang*.

It is further said that the *Tai Shang* expounded the *Scripture of the Jade Capital Mountain of the Mystic Capital*. *Tai Shang* is the provisional title of the Sage, who proclaims the perfected Dharma. The *Jade Capital* is a metaphor for the Dharma-body. Though the Dharma is originally wordless and without form or appearance, here it provisionally employs the name and marks of the *Xuan Du* to expound the teaching. Thus, there are scriptures such as the *Jade Capital Mountain* and *City Terrace*, which constitute the eighth fascicle of the third section of the *Dongxuan Lingbao*. The reason it follows the *Kongdong* (Void Cavern) is that the *Kongdong* is the universal praise of all heavens, the Dharma-body’s all-embracing perfection, comprehending past and present as one principle and encompassing the coarse and subtle in shared practice—hence its sequence.

This text is the *Tai Shang*’s comprehensive summation, entitled the *Praise of the Great Pure Dharma-Gate*. It reveals the great essence of the conditioned teaching and illumines the shared path of wondrous enlightenment. Thus, every Dharma is the *Jade Capital*, and every being inscribes the Dao and virtue.

It is also said that the *Jade Capital* is the Dharma-body’s profound identity. *Du* (capital) is a designation. The name *Jade Capital Mountain* unites the three thousand great thousand-worlds into one, for this realm is the abode of the *Tai Shang*. It is also the dwelling of the human mind’s spirit—hence its proclamation as a teaching to instruct the mind’s spirit. When the mind’s spirit awakens, it is called awakening; when deluded, it is called delusion; when wise, it is called wisdom. Through reverent practice, it is termed the Dharma of humanity—thus it is called a *scripture*. *Scripture* (經) derives from *ford* (津), signifying passage. Principle arises from explanation, and explanation arises from principle. When the scholar’s spirit awakens, the text is thus named a *scripture*. *Yu* (jade) means purity; *Jing* (capital) means greatness. Expounding the *Xuan Du* as the principle of great purity, it is the Dharma-body. The *Tai Shang* is the person; the *Xuan Du Jade Capital* is the Dharma, and also the realm and wisdom. Speaking of the realm and its abode, both are called *treasures*; speaking of wisdom and its abode, both are called *Lingbao* (Numinous Treasure). Hence it is called the *Scripture of the Jade Capital Mountain of the Mystic Capital*.

This fascicle is divided into four parts:
1. Presenting the *Xuan Du* as the realm of the Dao to establish the Dharma-body, elucidating the teaching’s methods through marks, and summarizing the activation of function from principle.
2. Demonstrating the methods of cultivation.
3. Listing ten hymns to praise the Dharma-body, summarizing the intent of entering principle from the external.
4. Scattering and broadly reciting, ensuring every Dharma is correct, to illustrate the circulation of gain and loss.

The *Tai Shang* states: The *Jade Capital Mountain of the Mystic Capital* is the expounded discourse. It crowns the eight directions, for the mountain has four faces, four corners, and four slopes—hence the eight directions. This is the realm of heaven and earth, the abode where worlds are arrayed. Analogous to earthly topography, there are three *Xuan Du* (upper, middle, and lower), and the mountain is also called the *Three Great Ring Mountains*. The *Great Ring* is the crown, encompassing the eight directions, with all heavens contained within. The lowest *Small Xuan Du* corresponds to the eight directions’ eight worlds, forming one world encircled by one ring mountain. Layering upward to a thousand, it becomes a *small thousand-world*, arranged in the four directions. Encircling it again forms a *middle world*; layering upward to a thousand becomes a *middle thousand-world*, again arranged in the four directions. Encircling it once more forms a *great thousand-world*. Layering upward to a thousand, it becomes a *crown-encircling mountain*. Viewed collectively, these are the *three thousand great thousand-worlds*. This crowns the eight methods and encompasses the heavens.

Composed of the seven treasures, it is also called a *treasure assembly*—hence the name *Jade Capital*. This metaphorical image clarifies the lofty subtlety of its meaning, designating the *Lingbao* Dharma-body’s all-pervading emptiness. Thus, the mountain naturally bears seven-jeweled trees. The mountain is named, not the trees—though the trees are its body, they are also called *Dao-trees*. A single trunk’s branches and leaves spread and cover all, hence it is called the *Dharma-Encompassing Heaven*. This is the place where the *Great Dao Lord* governs, transforms, sits, and walks—the realm of the Dharma, the site of the Dao-ground, the abode of the spirit, the place of Dharma-expounding. It is not established apart from the Real; every place is the Real. Throughout the world, there is no place that is empty or idle—whether the three poisons or the four arrivals, the numinous essence or the Dharma-ocean, the six senses or the five aggregates.

The *Jade Capital Mountain* is the *Xuan Du* of the lofty immortals, where all sages gather—it is also the sacred realm of the *Great Dao Lord*. Who else but the Sage could take all things as their own body? Hence it is called the *Great Dharma Sage*. Heavenly Worthies, Emperors, lofty immortals, and perfected transcendents all uphold the fast and revere the Dharma, venerating the *Tai Shang* here. *Zhai* (fasting) means washing the mind—*Zhai* is the sun, the time. It is also the mind’s purity and luminous reflection as the sun and time. When I am pure, nothing is impure. The title *Tai Shang Xuan Du* embodies this meaning.

Burning the naturally arisen *Qiandao* incense and the reverse-born numinous fragrance—this is the divine incense. The realm is purity. Flying immortals scatter flowers—all Dharmas are flowers. Spiraling and circling, they chant the *Kongdong* numinous verses. All heavens perform a chaotic assembly of a hundred thousand sounds. This is the wondrous exposition, all matters of the numinous awakening within the Dharma-body—one must rely on the text to comprehend it.

The mountain bears ten titles, each reflecting the Dharma-body. Though it has ten names, they share a single meaning.

First, it is called *Gaitian Shoushan* (Heaven-Covering Summit Mountain). This mountain embodies the true emptiness of Dharma-nature, spanning past and present as the primal head of all things—hence *Heaven’s Summit*.

Second, it is called *Mixuan Shangshan* (Boundless Mystery Supreme Mountain). Its expanse knows no edges to trace, no ascent or descent to reach—hence *Boundless Mystery*.

Third, it is called *Luoxuan Dongxu Shan* (Mystic Net Cavern-Void Mountain). It is present everywhere, yet wherever it is, there is nothing—hence *Mystic Net*.

Fourth, it is called *Gaoshang Zhenyuan Shan* (Lofty Supreme True Origin Mountain). It is the ancestral seat of all sages—hence *Lofty Supreme*.

Fifth, it is called *Zhongbao Youjie Ren Shan* (Multitude-of-Treasures Hidden-Kalpa Blade Mountain). Every Dharma therein is treasure, revealed in both depth and surface—hence *Multitude-of-Treasures*.

Sixth, it is called *Wuse Dajue Shan* (Formless Great Awakening Mountain). Its wondrous awakening is without form—hence *Formless*.

Seventh, it is called *Zhouguan Dongxuan Shan* (All-Encompassing Cavern-Mystery Mountain). Its luminous clarity is boundless—hence *All-Encompassing*.

Eighth, it is called *Jinghua Taizhen Shan* (Radiant-Flower Supreme Perfection Mountain). Its body is one, its flower-light flowing like nectar—hence *Radiant-Flower*.

Ninth, it is called *Busiyi Shan* (Inconceivable Mountain). Its true emptiness transcends thought and deliberation—hence *Inconceivable*.

Tenth, it is called *Taixuan Du Yujing Taishang Shan* (Great Mystery Capital Jade Capital Supreme Mountain). Here, person and Dharma are non-dual, purity its essence—hence *Great Mystery*.

The mountain is the body—it is also the body of the *Tai Shang*. Knowing the purport beneath these names, one aligns with the Dharma; name and essence unite, and thus one enters the register of immortals.

The realm of the mountain’s seven-jeweled trees—branches, stems, and leaves—along with its soil, stones, and terraced pavilions, are all composed of the seven treasures. Its flowers and leaves are the scriptures of the *Upper Clarity* and *Three Caverns*: the *Virtue/Power* and other sutras, their texts and commentaries comprising the thirty-six divisions. Those who consume them become golden-flowered immortals.

Encouraged to sip the numinous nectar of the *Lingbao* pure libation, the realm brightens with the heart’s clarity, and the earth itself becomes the seven-jeweled mystery scriptures. The mountains, forests, grasses, and stones all possess wisdom, capable of expounding the treasure Dharma—where is there a place that is not the *Jade Capital*?

The *Dongxuan Bu Xu Yong* (Cavern-Mystery Pacing the Void Chant) that follows this passage is the method of savoring the seven-jeweled flowers and leaves. When the heart connects with the mysterious Dao, the spirit chants while pacing the void, traversing the scriptures. The adept’s spiritual awakening is called *scripture*; observation follows sound in wandering—hence *chanting*.

As for *bowing with reverence*, there are three kinds, as commonly understood. Here, given the purport of savoring and chanting, it is fitting to interpret from the heart’s resonance.

*The Supreme Cavern-Mystery Pacing the Void Sutra Chant: First*

Bowing with reverence to the Supreme,
incense burned to return to the Void Origin.
Luminous radiance follows my return,
the Dharma-wheel likewise turns thrice.
The Mysterious Origin flourishes in the Four Greats,
spiritual blessings extend to kings and lords.
Seven generations of ancestors ascend to Heaven’s halls,
resplendent, their glory unfurled.
Whistling and singing, I contemplate the Great Vastness,
heavenly music delights my joy.
Equal in fragrance, the unsurpassed virtue,
lesser immortals cannot compare.
Wondrous forms illumine the Mysterious Awakening,
in throngs they roam the void in carefree wandering.

*Bowing with reverence*: to *open* (稽) the *heart* (首) and *embody* (礼) it, allowing the wisdom-fire of the Supreme to burn away all bodily forms until pure. *Burning incense to return to the Void*: to *dissolve* (烧) all phenomena, where purity naturally returns to the Void—yet the Void does not return to the Supreme; the Supreme returns to itself, hence the phrase. *Luminous radiance follows my return*: "I" here is the realized Supreme; the Dharma-wheel turns thrice, completing its revolution in union with the Supreme. *The Mysterious Origin flourishes in the Four Greats*: "Mysterious Origin" means "to follow"; my Four Greats thrive in harmony with the Mysterious Dao. *Spiritual blessings extend to kings and lords*: spiritual wisdom and blessings converge, nurturing kin, serving rulers, and benefiting all beings—hence extending to kings and lords. Thus, *seven generations of ancestors ascend to Heaven’s halls*, their glory resplendent. *Whistling and singing, I contemplate the Great Vastness*: singing the tones of spiritual wisdom, a single sound pervades all, contemplating the Dao of the Great Vastness. In harmony with the Dao, joy naturally aligns with heavenly music, *heavenly music delights my joy*. *Equal in fragrance, the unsurpassed virtue*: "fragrance" means "to receive"; ancestors and rulers alike receive the unsurpassed virtue with me, for they are not the companions of lesser immortals. *Wondrous thoughts merge with all wonders*, hence the Mysterious Awakening. *In throngs* (诜诜), in splendid array, the multitude roams the void in carefree wandering.

**Second**

Circling in flight, treading the net of clouds,
riding the void, pacing the Mysterious Record.
Chanting the hymn to the Imperial Unity,
a hundred joints naturally harmonize.
Bending to command the lads of the Eight Seas,
looking up to carry the lofty immortals.
All heavens scatter fragrant flowers,
a serene numinous wind arises.
Long-held vows root the destiny,
thus attaining the lofty aspiration.
Reverent joy before the Supreme—
ten thousand kalpas are but a beginning.

*Circling in flight, treading the net of clouds*: circling the void in motion, *motion* (行) as in *forgetting*. Feet tread the guiding principles of the Dharma-cloud, *riding the void, pacing the Mysterious Record*. *Chanting*: the nature’s communion. When the nature communes, the Imperial Unity naturally unites with my body, and the hundred joints return to wholeness. *Hundred joints*: the hundred bones of the body, naturally harmonizing with the supreme principle. *Bending to command the lads of the Eight Seas*: embracing all things as one’s own body, thus the eight directions’ seas of nature are but a single infant lad. *Lad*: without mind. *Looking up to carry the lofty immortals*: what heaven and earth rely upon. *All heavens scatter fragrant flowers*: scattering the true Dharma-flower above and below. *The realm follows the heart’s clarity*, and jade scriptures arise in response to the realm. *A serene numinous wind arises*: the wind of spiritual awakening, rising in serene whispers. *Long-held vows root the destiny*: the vows accumulated over countless kalpas, boundless spiritual wisdom, pledged to enlightenment—thus the root of destiny is long established, now to be received. *Thus attaining the lofty aspiration*: the lofty aspiration is now fulfilled. With the Supreme present in my heart, the Dao-fruit is boundless, and vows are fulfilled—hence reverent joy abides in constancy. *Ten thousand kalpas are but a beginning*: the unraveling of eternity.

The third: Towering and majestic, the Dark Capital Mountain—
the ten directions revere the One Sovereign.
Lofty, the Terrace of Heavenly Treasure,
its radiance flames like the streaming sun.
Resplendent, the Jade-Flower Grove,
crimson fruits gleam in dazzling splendor.
Ever mindful to nourish the primordial essence,
refining the fluid to solidify form and substance.
Golden light scatters through the Purple Tenuity,
graceful and secluded, the Dark Capital’s leisure.
Towering and majestic, the Dark Capital Mountain.

It speaks of the realm’s purity, the Dharma-body’s majesty—
the Dark Capital is the mountain where the mysterious Dao convenes.
The ten directions revere the One Sovereign:
the One Sovereign is the honored heart of wisdom’s purity.
In awakening, one recognizes that the Dark Capital encompasses the ten directions,
all converging in reverence to the One Sovereign’s honor.
Lofty, the Terrace of Heavenly Treasure:
it unites the myriad things as one’s own body.
When realm and wisdom illumine as one,
radiance flames like the streaming sun.
The light of sun and moon becomes dim and useless—
this is the sun’s light transcended.
Below, it is explained: resplendent, the Jade-Flower Grove,
crimson fruits gleam in dazzling splendor.

Ever mindful to nourish the primordial essence:
this recounts the practice of contemplation.
Primordial essence is numinous wisdom.
Daily contemplation refines clarity and transforms the qi of mortality,
thus the root of form and substance becomes a body of golden light.
Scattering brilliance through my being,
it gives rise to the Purple Tenuity’s abode,
graceful and secluded, wandering freely in the Dark Capital’s dwelling.
Those who later altered this to "Mahayana" reached the height of folly.
"Vehicle" denotes the direction of conveyance—
the Dark Capital is the supreme chamber of the ultimate Dao.
To approach it through faith and devotion
is like a traveler whose weariness and ease reach their extremes.

The fourth: In reverence, I hold the Supreme in mind,
the Flowery Radiance beautifies the cinnabar field.
Gazing left, I lift the Somber Luminant;
glancing right, I carry the Linked Brilliance.
The Six Perfections crown the brahmic conduct,
virtue and power renew with each passing day.
Accumulated blessings from past lives bring felicity—
hearing the sutras is like meeting one’s closest kin.
Heaven-endowed with transcendent talent,
joyfully reciting the subtle and wondrous scriptures.
The qi of profound emptiness and great harmony,
exhaling and inhaling the flowing rosy mist.
Fetal breathing stills the hundred passages,
in solitude, mastering the three expedients.
The Mud-Pill Palace shines with luminous radiance,
thus becoming an Immortal of Golden Flower.
The Demon King pays homage and receives his charge,
enabling him to ascend and attend the heavens.
All begins with fasting and precepts,
accumulating merit to weave past connections.
Soaring through the vast void,
uplifting the lofty ones.

In reverence, I hold the Supreme in mind:
each of these chapters establishes a distinct contemplative gate,
a practice of nurturing and savoring through chanting.
The gates differ—
the ode declares that radiant awakening returns to the One Source.
Each chapter stands alone, without overlap.
Now, "in reverence, I hold the Supreme in mind":
"Hold" is the heart.
The body’s movements have reverence and deference;
the heart’s movements have contemplation and visualization.
When conduct and heart attain the numinous and wondrous,
wondrous thoughts naturally gather,
and the body follows the spirit.
The heart holds the spirit, moving in accord with the Supreme;
the Supreme follows the spirit to act.
Thus the reverent body equals the Supreme,
and the Supreme, following the spirit, returns to me—
hence the Flowery Radiance beautifies the cinnabar field.
Gazing left below, lifting the Somber Luminant and Linked Brilliance,
all are carried by awakened wisdom.
The Six Perfections serve as its crown,
crowning the brahmic conduct—
thus virtue and power renew with each passing day.

Accumulated blessings from past lives:
this describes one who practices as above,
whose past cultivation spans eons,
now honored and advancing without regression.
Hearing the sutras is like meeting one’s closest kin:
the response to accumulated blessings.
Like parents, the closest kin—
the feeling of suddenly encountering them after long separation.
The sutras are the Dharma-mother,
the Dao the Dharma-father.
Meeting them brings joy and reverence,
and one’s conduct reflects past connections.
Heaven-endowed with transcendent talent,
thus delighting in reciting the subtle and wondrous two scriptures.
"Subtle" denotes the soundless,
"wondrous" the formless.
Without past cultivation sustaining karmic force,
one would not believe in the sutras,
hearing yet not knowing they are heard.
Even if practiced, one would soon regress,
lacking the power of restraint.

The qi of profound emptiness and great harmony:
this describes the practice of right contemplation.
"Profound" is the heart.
The heart attains the wondrous qi of profound emptiness and great harmony,
exhaling and inhaling the flowing radiance,
the rosy mist irrigating my being.
This is also called fetal breathing.
Like a fetus at rest,
breathing without conscious effort,
empty and at ease, nurturing—
stilling the hundred passages.
Stillness makes the heart solitary and serene,
brightly illumined,
mastering the expedient gates of the three realms.
The Mud-Pill is non-action;
non-action illumines within,
light and radiance shine without—
the Dao of true constancy, flourishing and luminous.
Thus one becomes an Immortal of Golden Flower.
Naturally, the Demon King respects and receives his charge,
enabling him to ascend and attend the heavens.
All begins with fasting and precepts:
this recounts how, from the outset,
past cultivation accumulated myriad virtues across vast kalpas,
sweeping away the dust left by the Primordial Beginning.
Thus the body equals the Dharma-realm,
soaring and traversing the vast void.
Gathering and uniting the wondrous,
uplifting the lofty ones.

The fifth: Guiding the reins to the ten directions,
circling to rest in the Dark Radiance’s expanse.
Gazing up at the Terrace of Kalpas,
looking down upon the Purple Cloud Net.
Carefree in the Supreme Capital,
together seated upon lotus flowers.
Accumulated learning makes one a Perfected Person,
tranquil, the constructive and protective forces harmonize.
Forever enjoying boundless life,
how could ten thousand kinds compare?

Guiding the reins to the ten directions:
guiding the body, reining the heart—
the body follows the heart to purity,
the heart reins the body to act.
Riding this, one reaches the ten directions, pervading all—
thus circling to rest and pause,
seated in the Dark Dao’s radiance,
within the Aligned Chambers.
Gazing up, body and heart sit upon the Terrace of Kalpas;
looking down, turning to brightness,
enveloped by the Purple Cloud.
The Purple Cloud’s canopy—
the color of the Dharma-cloud, the apex of numinous wisdom.
Seated thus, carefree,
dwelling in the Supreme’s Jade Capital.
Holy companions gather,
together seated upon lotus flowers.

Accumulated learning makes one a Perfected Person:
this dispels delusion—
past cultivation spans eons, hence its attainment now.
Tranquil, the constructive and protective forces harmonize:
the method of constructive and protective forces—
true wisdom harmonizes tranquility,
the stomach’s inner harmony and clarity.
Forever enjoying boundless, endless life—
how could ten thousand kinds compare? Hence, how could they be many?

The sixth: The Great Dao’s master is mysterious and quiescent,
ascending immortals befriend the Peerless Hero.
The Noble Scion bestows the numinous talisman,
the Great One bears the Cavern Scripture.
Sarira radiate a golden form,
the dragon-drawn chariot suddenly arrives to welcome.

The Heavenly Worthy gazes upon the cloud-chariot,
floating, floating—riding the void in flight.
Fragrant blossoms like swirling snow,
mist and haze flourish upon the dark beams.

Bowing in reverence toward the Golden Portal,
hand in hand they roam the Jade Capital.
The Great Dao’s master is mysterious and quiescent.
Those who seek the Great Dao
should take the realm of mysterious quiescence as their master.
Mastering quiescence externally,
they attain the primordial internally.
Quiescence is non-action;
non-action is quiescence—
thus is the Great Dao attained,
thus is quiescence made one’s master.

Hence, they ascend as companions to the Peerless Hero.
Having befriended the Peerless Hero,
the numinous talisman naturally turns within me.
The Peerless Hero is the title of a celestial perfected.
The Supreme One of the Great Unity offers me the Cavern Scripture.
The Cavern Scripture is the celestial sound.
Sarira are the bones.
The Cavern Scripture washes my bone-form,
and my bone-form assumes a golden countenance.

The dragon-drawn chariot suddenly arrives in the void to welcome,
reining freely as we roam.
The Heavenly Worthy gazes upon me,
the cloud-chariot floating, floating—
together we ride the void in flight.
Fragrant blossoms span the celestial realm,
like swirling snow in boundless haze,
lush and splendid, the lofty beams of the dark Dao.
Bowing in reverence within the Golden Portal,
the Heavenly Worthy takes my hand,
and we roam, seated in the Jade Capital.

---

The seventh:
The towering trees of the Dark Radiance Garden,
resplendent with the Seven Treasures’ grove.
Three hundred celestial beasts in name,
lions vast as ten thousand *xun*.
Flying dragons pace and roar,
divine phoenixes chant in harmony.
A numinous breeze fans rare blossoms,
their pure fragrance scattering upon one’s lapels.
Without the talent of a lofty immortal,
how could one indulge such a heart?

The towering trees of the Dark Radiance Garden.
Radiance follows a pure heart,
hence the radiance forms Seven Treasures’ towering trees.
Now, speaking of radiance’s wonder
is also speaking of the heart’s wonder—
thus, setting forth the heart’s wisdom to describe radiance,
it is called the Dark Radiance Garden.
The wondrous heart illumines the perfectly pure radiance,
and the treasure forms the Seven Treasures’ towering trees,
the garden of the Dharma-realm—
hence, resplendent with the Seven Treasures’ grove.

Three hundred celestial beasts in name.
Spontaneous Dharma-beasts manifest in form,
as the Dharma-king lion abides in freedom,
hence the name "lion."
Three hundred names and vast as ten thousand *xun*—
these are but approximate counts.
In truth, their names and forms are numberless,
their bodies vast and boundless.
Below, flying dragons and divine phoenixes
are alternate names for celestial beasts.
Beneath the divine phoenix’s fan,
the wondrous wisdom is expounded.
With luminous purity of numinous wisdom,
its majestic wind and marvelous power
fans the myriad scenes into the Dharma of radiant purity,
fragrant blossoms scattering upon one’s lapels in the realm.

The following verse reveals:
without the talent and wisdom of a lofty immortal and great sage,
how could one possess a heart to delight in such things?

---

The eighth:
Adorning my nine-dragon chariot,
I ride the void in carefree roaming.
The eight heavens are like the palm of one’s hand,
how could the six directions be distant?
The assembled immortals chant the Cavern Scripture,
the Supreme One sings a pure melody.
Fragrant blossoms scatter with the wind,
jade tones ascend into the Purple Empyrean.
The Five Sufferings all burst forth at once,
the Eight Difficulties follow the scripture’s emptiness.
Wondrous indeed is the Numinous Treasure’s garden,
giving rise to this great Dharma-bridge.

Adorning my nine-dragon chariot.
"Adorning me" means that the Numinous Treasure’s true wisdom
adorns and purifies my five faculties and four hearts,
forming the six penetrations and three clarities,
paving the level path of the multitude—
hence, the nine-dragon chariot.
Thus, it is said: riding the void in carefree roaming.

The eight heavens are like the palm of one’s hand,
how could the six directions be distant?
Riding in accord, the myriad things become one body.
The Supreme One, the honored teacher, and good companions
gather without prior arrangement,
all chanting and singing the empty cavern’s melodies to establish the teaching.
Thus, fragrant blossoms scatter with the wind,
jade tones ascend into the Purple Empyrean.
The Purple Empyrean’s realm and forms all become scripture,
hence the Five Sufferings, in an instant,
scatter with the scripture—
they too become scripture.
The Eight Difficulties are likewise.
Thus, it is said: wondrous indeed is the Numinous Treasure’s garden,
giving rise to this great Dharma-bridge.

---

The ninth:
The Palace of the Heavenly Perfected and Imperial Unity,
its misty radiance crowning the numinous.
Flowing and resplendent, the Dharma-wheel’s net,
spinning through the void to enter formlessness.
The August Void strums the cloud-zither,
the assembled perfected chant the Cavern Scripture.
Lofty immortals cup their hands in praise,
through endless kalpas preserving integrity and purity.

The Palace of the Heavenly Perfected and Imperial Unity.
"Palace" is the body.
Embodying the spontaneous Dao,
it is the dwelling of the Heavenly Perfected,
the abode of the true Imperial Unity.
"Abode" is the dwelling of the Imperial Unity.
Its misty form crowns the numinous radiance.
The Dharma-body of the self
flows with luminous splendor,
becoming the net of the Dharma-bridge’s principles.
The wheel turns to merge with the void,
the Great Dao spinning through the void to enter formlessness.
The August Void and the assembled perfected
suddenly arrive as great teachers and companions,
strumming the cloud-zither and singing,
together chanting the Cavern Scripture to perfect me.
Lofty immortals cup their hands in praise and celebration.
Through endless kalpas preserving integrity and purity—
this is the constant.

The Utmost Perfected awaits nothing,
at times reining in flying dragons.
With long fasts they gather in the Mystic Capital,
striking jade to sound the jasper bells.
The Ten Flowers host the assembled immortals,
purple mists congeal to form their palace.
Jeweled canopies array the Most High,
Perfected Ones grasp lotus blossoms.
Scattering flowers, they present my vows,
grasping the tally to subdue the Demon King.
The Dharma-drum summons the host of immortals,
their numinous chants harmonize without discord.
No can, no cannot—
thought merges with the subtle and imperceptible.
The Utmost Perfected awaits nothing,
at times reining in flying dragons.

Embodied in the Utmost Perfection,
they ride all things without obstruction,
bear all forms without support—
thus they await nothing.
At times reining in flying dragons.
With prolonged fasting and purified hearts,
they naturally converge in the Mystic Capital.
Striking jade to sound the jasper bells—
the Dharma-drum summons, and they respond.
Beneath the Ten Flowers, the host of sages gathers.
Purple mists exhale to form their natural abode.
The jeweled canopy is the Dharma-crown,
arrayed for the Most High.
Countless Perfected Ones hold lotus Dharma-banners,
offering to the emptiness-born.
All scatter the flowers of Dharma-wisdom,
arraying them to fulfill my past vows.
Past vows become boundless wisdom and resolve—
now their fulfillment is attained.
Grasping the tally to subdue the Demon King,
they accomplish the vow to sever delusion.
The Dharma-drum is the drum of Dharma-wisdom,
assembling the host of spirits.
Their numinous chants harmonize without discord.
Thus there is no can, no cannot—
thought merges with the subtle and imperceptible.
Inner illumination manifests outer function,
so inner thought naturally communes with the subtle.
