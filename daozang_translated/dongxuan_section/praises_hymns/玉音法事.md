*Three Refuges*

*Devotedly take refuge in the scriptural treasures of the ten directions—may all beings, the departed spirits, awaken to understanding, receive, uphold, and recite them.*

*Hymn for Spreading the Seat*

*After hearing the scripture, may all beings, the departed spirits, forever sever delusion and constantly return to the true Dao.*

*Hymn for Rising from the Seat*

*For all future rebirths, may good karmic conditions be made—if enlightenment is granted, we reverently bear the profound grace.*

*Whenever the fast concludes, the Dao is intoned—*
*Chanting the Hymn of the Dao*

*As recorded in the* Jiaoyi Scroll *of the* Canon*: whenever the Dao is chanted, the handbell is struck. At the final phrase, the Daoists silently invoke the Heavenly Worthy three times, or five, or seven, or nine—during yang rites, "Heavenly Worthy of Longevity and Life-Preservation" or "Heavenly Worthy of Boundless Blessings"; during yin rites, "Heavenly Worthy of Great Unity and Salvation from Suffering."*

*The* Huaxia Hymn *is also called* Four-Voice Huaxia*. According to the* Jade Chapters*, the annotation for* hua *reads* Huaxia*, spanning three thousand five hundred li, signifying its vast and distant meaning. Today, the* Huaxia *begins with the raising of the* Sizhen Hall*, slowly chanted as one passes through the corridor and hall, ascending the altar platform to completion—seemingly evoking its distant resonance.*

*Rotating-Voice Huaxia Hymn*
*Invite the Five Masters to raise it again.*

**Cloud Chariot Hymn**
To send off the Five Masters as they raise it again.
The purification rite now complete, we lift our hearts in reverence,
bowing our heads in devotion to escort the Mystic Master,
the Heavenly Master, and the Master of Scriptures and Ordination.

*Cloud Chariot Hymn*
The cloud chariot does not stay,
the crane-drawn carriage cannot be detained.
When next we hold a purification rite,
we shall once more extend our invitation.

**Invoking the Talisman Envoys**
The direct envoys of the Three Realms,
the Four Duty Officers of the Merit Registers,
the divine officials who ascend with petitions,
the spirit generals, functionaries, and soldiers,
the local earth deities.

With devotion, first,
second,
third,
the incense ascends to the Primordial,
the Cavern-Heaven,
the Abyssal Spring Palace,
pervading the Three Realms of the Primordial,
the Cavern-Heaven Immortal Courts,
the Abyssal Spring Water Palaces—
forming a radiant canopy of fragrant clouds.

The Venerables of the Three Realms of the Primordial,
the Lords of the Cavern-Heaven Immortal Courts,
the Lords of the Abyssal Spring Water Palaces.

*End of the Central Scroll of the Jade Sound Ritual*

**Opening the Scripture**
The Daoist assembly sits in even rows,
raising the hymn of reverence.
Next, the Three Refuges,
then the Seated Hymn of Exposition.
Recitation proceeds according to ritual,
the petitioner announces the opening of the scripture.

*Cloud Script of the Great Void,*
at the dawn of kalpas,
now distant, now near,
now submerged, now afloat,
wandering the Five Directions,
over a zhang and more.

The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign took up his brush and inscribed,
expounding the Cavern Chapters,
then writing the numinous talismans.
The Primordial descended,
the true writ unfolded,
luminous in its presence,
obscure in its absence.
Sinking illness may heal itself,
worldly toil and drowning may be uplifted.
The hidden and the manifest, the living and the dead—
thus may one ascend to the Immortal Capital.

Those who utter this supreme vow:
today, as we ascend the scripture dais,
we reverently dedicate this to [Name],
to augment and extend their years,
to bring peace and vigor to their person.
Through all the hours to come,
may good fortune and harmony prevail.

We pray that the Eastern Flower bestow longevity,
that the Southern Culmen extend life.
May blessings be as deep as the sea,
may lifespan be as enduring as the mountains.
For this cause, we invoke:
the Heavenly Worthy of Boundless Blessings,
the Heavenly Worthy of Extended Longevity,
the Heavenly Worthy of Longevity and Life-Preservation—
immeasurable, inconceivable merit and virtue.

*Opening the Ritual for the Scripture*
*Upon completing the recitation of the precious scripture...*

Next, we raise the hastened chant of "Stepping Through the Void,"
the intonation of scripture-praise.

Consider well: the Three Caverns’ precious scriptures are the sacred models of the myriad heavens.
They weave the wondrous *qi* into soaring flight,
and form the dragon-script of the Great Brahmā.
Their meaning spans the floating lives of mortals,
their text endures through eternal kalpas.
Thus, heaven and earth, receiving them, divide and take their places;
sun and moon, by them, revolve and move.
Ghosts and spirits, revering them, transform and adapt;
humans, upholding them, attain flourishing peace.

Therefore, those who chant them ascend in form to the crimson empyrean;
those who hear them rise in body to the azure firmament.
None fail to look up to them in awe—human and celestial alike—
or to rely upon them for life and transformation.
They are the bridge and beam for all beings,
the door and window for the host of perfected ones.
What cannot be spoken of in words—
is this not the treasury of the Great Vehicle’s scriptures?

Hitherto, we have offered this for the patron of today’s fast, [Name],
reciting the scriptures of the Most High.
In this recitation, none fail to open the case and expound the profound,
their resonance piercing the Three Heavens;
to grasp the scroll and chant aloud,
their voices heard in the Nine Realms below.

We pray that the golden lads attending incense
weave fragrant characters in the midst of heaven;
that the jade youths in charge of scriptures
present the sacred texts upon the tablets.
Thus may past transgressions from former kalpas be dissolved,
and blessings descend upon this day.
May the living and the dead alike receive the grace of flourishing peace,
and all creatures, moving and still, feel the power of life and growth.
Riding this wave of good fortune,
may all be adorned with splendor.
May the Three Paths cease their torments of bitterness,
and the Nine Nights end their pangs of sorrow.
Even unto the most distant and humble,
and all the teeming multitudes of beings—
may all board the vessel of the Six Perfections,
and together ascend the shore of the Three Clarities.

The assembly, in reverent devotion,
hears the scriptures and joins in praise.

*Next, upon hearing the scriptures, gather them by hand and conclude the sitting in praise.*
*Next, recapitulate the preceding.*

The merits of the scripture recitation just completed,
offered up to the perfected sages,
pray for protection and peace,
shared in the power of good deeds,
to realize the supreme Dao—
all bow in faith and reverence.

*Next, the turning toward.*

Heaven’s clouds swirl in the Milky Way,
weaving true *qi* into scripture;
earth’s jade cases open,
revealing numinous texts to the world.
Their merit matches the workings of creation,
their benefits extend to humans and celestials alike.
The recitation of the Most High’s true scriptures,
the invocation of the Heavenly Worthies’ sacred names,
the vocal praise of the ritual’s merits—
boundless are the excellent causes thus planted.
We dedicate this for [Name]’s intention,
humbly praying as follows:

*The Yellow Register’s Opening Scripture Text*
The Daoist assembly sits in peace.
*Raise the Hymn of Reverence*
*Next, the Three Refuges*
*Next, the Seated Praise*
*Recite and intone as prescribed*
*The Intendant announces the opening of the scriptures.*

Towers of kalpas’ height,
fragrant clouds and plain canopies.
Wondrous is the Primordial Beginning,
whose all-penetrating vision knows no bounds.
All the great sages of the heavens
gather as one.
The Numinous Treasure unfolds its chart,
the Fengdu courts adjourn their trials.
The golden register and white tablets,
the Nine Perfected’s wondrous precepts—
these are the bridge and beam
to transcend the Three Realms.

Today, ascending the scripture dais,
we turn and recite the immortal scriptures.
We now make this vow:
for the patron of this Yellow Register fast, [Name],
we pray for the deliverance of the departed soul of [Name],
to ascend to the immortal realms.
Humbly we pray:
may the Vermilion Mound redeem their life,
may the Golden Gates transform their form.
Roaming freely in bliss, unbound,
following their wishes to be reborn in ease.

We invite the assembly, with one voice and heart,
for this cause to invoke:
the Heavenly Worthy of Great Unity Who Saves from Suffering,
the Heavenly Worthy Who Delivers from the Nine Hells,
the Heavenly Worthy of the Great Bridge of Deliverance,
the Heavenly Worthy Who Transcends the Three Realms,
the Heavenly Worthy of Free and Joyous Roaming—
immeasurable, inconceivable merit and virtue.

*Opening the Ritual for the Scripture*
*The August Void Emperor’s name is intoned; the precious scriptures are recited in turn, awaiting their completion.*

With hastened steps and celestial hymns, we raise the *Biaobai* of the *Bu Xu* and intone the *Lingbao Sutra* in praise.

We reverently recall: since the Primordial Beginning of the ancestral kalpas, the myriad heavens were brought forth, unfolding the empty songs of the Azure Vault and illuminating the lush radiance of the Purple Void. The Three Luminaries were revealed to universally nurture the divine spirits; the Five Chapters were spread to safeguard and govern the kalpic destinies. Some sit upon lion thrones, others enter the heart of jeweled pearls—ten thousand sages descend in state, hosts of perfected ones attend in assembly. These are the hidden melodies of the heavens, not the common words of the mortal world. Naturally sacred verses, thus called profound and mysterious: recited once, they resonate in unison; praised tenfold, they revive the withered bones. Their blessings are boundless, delivering countless souls.

Today, the departed [Name], whose fate aligns with the time of extinction, has traversed the Palace of Grand Yin. Though their immortal rank remains unfulfilled, who would say their spirit is but momentarily extinguished? They face the retribution of the Five Sufferings and Eight Difficulties, yet lack the thousand harmonies and myriad unions to attain perfection. We now rely on the burning of incense and the recitation of scriptures, still hoping to restore their form and raise them from death.

We humbly pray: may the Mandate of the Primordial Beginning and the hymns of the Demon Kings ascend to the heavens, universally proclaimed across the Three Realms. Let them soar through the Five Portals, merging with the hundred spirits. May evil roots be eradicated, sin records swiftly expunged. Rescue those on the brink of death, snatching them from annihilation to be reborn; may their souls ascend in due time, their spirits purified and rectified. Grasping the talismans and holding the registers, may they preserve their lives and regenerate their roots. Through tenfold revolutions of the Wheel of Return, may the deceased souls undergo refinement, all attaining deliverance to become immortals, transformed into perfected beings. May this extend to the countless kalpas of kindred, and below, to the suffering souls of the netherworld—all ascending to immortal ranks, forever freed from servitude to the ghostly officials.

May the Three Paths, Five Sufferings, and Eight Difficulties be eternally transcended, rising above the Three Realms to roam freely in the Highest Clarity.

Next, we pray for the sponsor of this fast, [Name], and their household: may they encounter the Dharma, become noble persons, their bodies radiant with light, untouched by demonic interference. May the myriad spirits pay homage, their names inscribed in the Upper Clarity. May the assembly, with utmost devotion, hear the scriptures and join in praise.

**Recitation of the *Scripture of Salvation* and Dedication of Merit**
The sacred writ of the Primordial Beginning, the hidden melodies of the heavens—
with one voice we chant and recite:
a single word dissolves the transgressions of ten thousand kalpas;
with diverse voices in unison, ten recitations deliver the Nine Hells from suffering.

The recitation of the *Wondrous Scripture of the Limitless Salvation, Upper Chapter* now concluded, we invoke the sacred names of the Heavenly Worthies and extol the merit of this ritual. Boundless auspicious causes are dedicated to the sponsor of this Yellow Register Fast, [Name].

We humbly pray: may their six senses be purified, attaining rebirth in the Land of Ripened Grain. Through hearing the scriptures, may their single nature become perfectly luminous, entering the Jeweled Pearl to realize fruition.

**Recitation and Contemplation of the *Scripture of Salvation* with Dedication of Merit**
The middle chapters of the sacred writ can rescue those from the Three Paths of suffering;
the upper chapters of this scripture can elevate the souls of the Nine Nights.

The recitation of the *Wondrous Scripture of the Limitless Salvation, Upper Chapter* now concluded, we invoke the sacred names of the Heavenly Worthies and extol the merit of this ritual. Boundless auspicious causes are dedicated to the sponsor of this fast, [Name].

We humbly pray: may they ascend to the Vermilion Palace, relying on the hidden melodies of the hundred demons; may they be nobly reborn in the immortal Dao, rising together with their seven ancestors.

We humbly pray: bearing the true talismans of the Primordial Beginning, may the deceased souls undergo refinement; hearing the hidden words of the Great Brahma, may they be transformed into immortals.

We humbly pray: may the hosts of perfected ones witness this deliverance, may the ranks of sages bestow compassion—may the deceased souls be refined to be reborn, may alien bones become kin and attain transcendence.

We humbly pray: may those already delivered be refined and transformed into immortals; may those yet unborn be reborn, escaping the evil destinies.

We, the ritual assembly, wholeheartedly devote our bodies, spirits, and lives to the Boundless Dao of the Ten Directions and the Utmost Venerable Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy.
We have heard that the Primordial One established the teachings, ever-pure and tranquil as their foundation;
The vast heavens receive sincerity, for without purification and covenant, they do not respond.
To move the sagely ones above, we first purge even the slightest blemish.
Following the sacred rites, we are permitted to repent.

At this moment, as incense is offered and the perfected are revered, we bow to the sages and repent.
Today, the host of this rite, [Name], together with all family members, young and old, from past lives to this present existence—
whether through the three karmas of body, speech, and mind, or the six senses—
have committed manifold transgressions, boundless and immeasurable.
We beseech their dissolution and humbly pray for universal pardon.

May the sagely ones of the Ten Directions bestow their illuminating grace;
May the immortals of the Three Caverns grant the blessing of long life.
Let misfortunes sink into the Nine Earths, and blessings arise from the Ten Directions.

*Bell sounded, bows completed, all reverently devote themselves and repent.*

We, the ritual assembly, wholeheartedly devote our bodies, spirits, and lives to the Eleven Luminaries, the August Star Lords of the Empyrean.
They grasp the pivot of the Dao, wielding the authority of flourishing transformation.
They govern the changes of yin and yang, and turn the power of nurturing creation.
Responsive to all entreaties, no hidden matter escapes their illumination.

At this moment, as incense is offered and the perfected are revered, we bow to the sages and repent.
Today, the host of this rite, [Name], together with all family members, young and old, from past lives to this present existence—
fearing the accumulation of transgressions and the entanglement of calamities—
whether through the three karmas of body, speech, and mind, or the six senses—
have committed manifold transgressions, boundless and immeasurable.
We beseech their dissolution and humbly pray for universal pardon.

May the Solar Emperor bestow grace, the Lunar Sovereign confer blessings;
May the Wood Virtue and Metal Brilliance grant protection, the radiant Fire and luminous Water flow with auspiciousness;
May the Earth Virtue shield and secure, Rāhu and Ketu dispel misfortune and bring fortune.
May the Celestial Unity Purple Qi augment our years, and the Moon Comet Star Lord not descend upon our destinies.
Let misfortunes sink into the Nine Earths, and blessings arise from the Ten Directions.

Next, with the sounding of the chime, bow and touch the ground, each with utmost sincerity, reverently repenting and submitting:
We, the assembled disciples, wholeheartedly offer our bodies, spirits, and lives in devotion.
To the Three Purities and Three Realms, the Venerable Ones of golden countenance and jade visage;
To the Ten Poles and Ten Floral Splendors, the Sages of bud-palace and gemmed-pavilion sanctuaries.

We have heard that when the turning of the kalpa began and the imperial order arose, the ritual emerged from the Great Ultimate.
Before Heaven and before Earth, it nurtured the human order;
Without form and without appearance, it is forcibly named the Great Dao.
We humbly beseech Your boundless compassion to deeply bestow Your grace upon us and universally descend Your vast benevolence.

Tonight, at midnight, we burn incense to pay homage to the Perfected, bow to the Sages, and repent.
On this occasion, the master of the rite, so-and-so, together with all family members, young and old,
from past lives to the present existence, fearing the accumulation of transgressions and the entanglement of karmic retribution,
whether through the three karmas of body, speech, and mind, or the six senses, have committed manifold errors and offenses, boundless and immeasurable.
We beseech that all be dissolved and forgiven.

We pray that the Three Pure Highest Sages bestow flourishing auspiciousness;
That the Ten Poles’ exalted Perfected Ones grant abundant blessings of great felicity.
May calamities sink into the Nine Earths, and blessings arise from the Ten Directions.
With devoted hearts, we bow our heads and prostrate, giving thanks to the Supreme Right and True Three Treasures.

Fourfold Vows:
May the Great Dao flourish and spread, the scriptures and teachings flow abundantly—with devoted hearts, we bow to the Right and True Three Treasures.
May the world enjoy great peace, yin and yang harmonize in order—with devoted hearts, we bow to the Right and True Three Treasures.
May the present emperor’s sagely longevity be boundless, his wisdom equal to the twin luminaries—with devoted hearts, we bow to the Right and True Three Treasures.

The time has passed, the night qi is serene.
Incense fills the void, the great bell’s sound fades.
The Dao returns to the Golden Gates, the scriptures repose in the Jade Casket.

**Daoist Hymns Composed by the Sage Emperor of Song**

*Jade Clarity Melody (Ten Poems)*
Earth dwells below, heaven above—all space is filled,
Myriad forms and shadows spread through the eight directions.
Who governs their function, unknown to all?
Crimson clouds and cinnabar mists veil the Pure Capital.

The azure vault resounds with songs of millet-like pearls,
The ten directions surge into boundless emptiness.
The joy of hearing the scriptures defies description—
Nine-hued dragons soar, bearing the eight-litters of light.

Feathered youths breathe forth mist not of this world,
Verdant vapors linger before the emerald chamber.
Creation is not gained from without—
From one’s own root and origin arise the Three Heavens.

Imperial radiance ascends to the Jade Continent,
Luminous truth gleams in layered towers amid floating purple clouds.
The triple-eight golden locks are undone—
The Boundless Void Sovereign reigns above.

White jade talismans descend from the Purple Court,
Three flourishes of the flowered banners summon the host of spirits.
Plucking and chewing the azure stamens of emptiness,
Their five bodies radiate golden light like sun and stars.

Beneath the Lianchang Terrace, the sea stirs its waves—
Only the lofty immortals who have attained the Dao may pass.
Lesser immortals strive in vain to follow,
Hearing from afar the harmonious songs of eight simurghs.

Five-colored clouds gather in dense array,
The triple-three grotto gates open wide their jade doors.
Which Daoist master submits the vermilion memorial?
Jade maidens fly with the missive to the Supreme One.

The Three Primes of the Upper Realm, wondrous essences of subtle hue,
In the Crimson Palace, their immortal names have long been inscribed.
Further abiding in the Great Chaos, preserving the Feminine One,
Their cloud chariots, ethereal and feathered, bear them aloft.

Within the Palace of True Yang, qi lingers and drifts,
Ascending and descending the Three Palaces in secret passage.
Unconcerned with the affairs of the floating world,
They ascend with the Five Venerable Ones to the Golden Terrace.

The Three Flowers and Great Simplicity arise of themselves,
Amidst emptiness, the lotus blossoms glow resplendent.
The Crimson Chamber and Golden House hold vacant thrones,
The Lads of the Grand Tenuity descend to welcome them.

*Upper Clarity Melody (Ten Poems)*
In the Purple Clarity Heaven, the Flowery Grove is nurtured,
Crimson fruits on vermilion branches, leaves of deepest green.
Chewing the abundant blossoms, their bodies never age,
Gazing below, they watch the crow and hare exchange their light.

The Primordial Lord of the Eight Qi is named Azure Spirit,
Adorned in brocade robes and crimson skirts, dwelling in the Jade City.
Holding the imperial talismans, he oversees the registers of the Dao,
Dispelling worldly burdens to deliver all beings.

The August Person of the Highest Realm feasts in the Purple Empyrean,
Plucking fragrant blooms, ever leading the eight soaring boughs.
Within and without, their bodies are as translucent as lapis,
Illuminating the Three Paths, dissolving ten thousand sorrows.

In the Nine-Day Palace, the Four Venerable True Ones,
On the Broad Radiance Mountain, they banquet with immortal guests.
Striking bells and plucking zithers, they partake of divine wine—
The azure vault, suffused with warmth, holds a spring apart.

Floating beyond the mountains, linked to the White Jade Capital,
The Golden Flower Tower gleams with the brilliance of the sun.
The Five Perfected gather the qi of the perfect pearl—
Their bones like jade, their forms like infants.

Beneath the Peak of Resplendent Flowers lies the Fivefold Numinous Capital,
The Primordial Radiance Divine Lord wields the pivot of transformation.
True fire, through its efficacy, creates and transforms,
Dissolving the five poisons, guiding them from the dark paths.

Resplendent and luminous, the nine wheels of the sun,
In the Six Abysses Palace, the Purple Primordial Lord.
Adorned in rosy crowns and brocade robes, she sits in tranquil ease,
Draped in auspicious mists, clad in scriptures of red.

Auspicious qi, verdant and lush, veils the purple void,
Azure essence feathered chariots bear the Primordial Lads.
Against the wind, vast and mighty, for three thousand leagues,
The sevenfold returning incense wafts everywhere.

In the flowing and gurgling pool blooms the Great Treasure Lotus,
Its ten-zhang blossoms reflecting in the spring.
Drinking its fragrance and sipping its waters, free from hunger and thirst,
Graceful and radiant, they are the immortals upon golden petals.

The towering rosy mountain stands in the Jade Void,
The Four Officiants, with crowns and swords, guard the Numinous Capital.
The host of perfected ones bow in homage, bearing celestial music,
At their waists, the jade tablets of the Immortal Emperor and the registers of ease.

*Grand Clarity Melody (Ten Poems)*
The Great One Primordial Lord presides over the ranks of immortals,
Crimson splendor and vermilion hues shine upon the magic fields.
When merits are complete and encounters fulfilled, names are inscribed in the registers—
How could it be only Hong Ya who laughs and claps his shoulders?

Five-jointed pure incense burns at midnight,
Heavenly beings and jade maidens hear it from afar.
Its savor blends with qi, resonating from afar,
Crimson standards and rainbow banners descend upon five-colored clouds.

The Great Ultimate Primordial Lord rides a chariot of kingfisher plumes,
Ten thousand demons hasten to obey her divine talismans.
Nine dragons pace forth, all raising their heads,
At times, fire pearls are seen spitting in the void.

Within the Jeweled Blossom Palace, the seven-word verses are composed,
Each of the Twelve True Lords bears a name.
Clouds escort the azure dragons back to the Fire Mansion,
Wind follows the white tigers forth from the azure sea.

The Golden Portal Bright Radiance Posterior Sage Lord,
Flowing essence shines, forming cinnabar clouds.
Had the Supreme One not transmitted it,
How could the mortal world possess the jade scriptures?

Peaks of Primordial Radiance soar into the vast sky,
Lofty and transcendent, the immortal chambers rest amid the clouds.
Ninefold clouds transform, swiftly parting and merging,
Feathered chariots drift and glide, boundless and unfathomable.

The Eastern Well cradles the essence of the luminous moon,
A host of dragons stir, wielding golden jars.
When did the immortals bathe and cleanse?
Only the crystal clarity shining through their bones is seen.

Vast and distant, the Three Fordings stretch to the Imperial River,
River linked to crimson mist, mist merging with the heavens.
The Jade Spirit Immortal Mother roams and rests,
Her attendants arrayed like the sun and moon’s chariots.

The Ninefold Numinous Jade Palace adjoins Kunlun,
Mountains divide the flowing nets, making kinship impossible.
She entrusts the purple orchids to convey her message—
Why exhaust your spirit in the red dust?

Left and right, the numinous consorts wield the cyclical signs,
In the Eight Scenic Palaces of the Jade Grove, they refine the essence of flowers.
When the feast in the Perpetual Sun is concluded, where do they return?
Casting fire and flowing gold, their tasks are accomplished.

*Ten Poems on the White Crane*
Spiritual birds born of transformation cry in the nine heavens,
Snow-white plumage and cinnabar crowns, both resplendent.
Let no one mistake them for those returning to the flowery pillars—
They come as auspicious omens of peace for a hundred million years.

Upon the Jasper Terrace, winds hush as night begins its parting,
Craning upward, their startled cries pierce the dew-drenched qi anew.
By Taiye’s pool they linger, unable to return—
In ages past, they were the qilin’s kin.

Graceful, the numinous cranes descend to the Great Purity,
Jade towers and golden halls where dawn’s breeze lightly stirs.
Proud, they spurn the parrot’s company,
Now and again uttering transcendent cries that soar beyond the world.

To the Three Mountains and azure seas, the path is not far—
They come as auspicious omens from the Purple Empyrean to the Celestial Capital.
Frost and snow adorn their plumage, their nature like ice and jade,
In the depths of the Jasper Pool, they peck at numinous sprouts.

Pure essence of gold and fire manifests in their bearing,
Ever following the Queen Mother to feast at the Jasper Pool.
By night, at the jade altar’s rites, immortals descend—
They fly past Mount Gou, unseen by mortal eyes.

Through palaces of five-hued clouds, the *bu xu* chant lingers long,
As the Dipper turns in the jade firmament, night yet unending.
White cranes arrive bearing tidings of fortune,
Their clear cries in unison trailing the fragrance of returning winds.

A single clarion call echoes through the Nine Marshes,
Their bones refined, their spirits lightened through the depths of years.
Across the Liao Sea, common folk fail to recognize them—
Yet in the Great Brahma Heaven, they find kindred souls.

White plumage gleams, immaculate against the frost’s splendor,
Cinnabar crowns distinct, outshining crimson cinnabar.
For sixteen hundred years, their divine qi has flourished,
Ever soaring and crying beside the jade immortals’ abode.

When the Penglai assembly disperses and the immortals depart,
Feathered chariots drift away as white cranes take flight.
In the Ming era, their auspicious presence became a familiar sight—
Why then invoke the *Yuefu* to sing of golden robes?

Jade palaces, profound, part the auspicious mists,
Fragrant winds yet unceasing, the cranes linger in flight.
Their wondrous forms stand apart from the Qingtian breed—
Surely these are immortals arriving in succession.

*Ten Poems on Scattering Flowers*
Scarlet staffs sway, guiding the way,
Heavenly blossoms scatter and drift.
Lofty perfected ones remain unstained—
Petal by petal, they cling not to robes.

Eightfold stairs spiral with jasper steps,
A thousand flowers unfurl brocade’s glory.
Verdant *ting* and purple *nai* bloom,
Resplendent, their names unknown.

Delicate golden calyces,
Even white jade petals.
Heavenly winds follow the feathered chariots,
Blowing through the ninefold city.

Graceful, they coil through empty space,
Profuse, they alight in the hall’s corners.
Eternal is their radiant splendor—
Where to seek the immortals’ realm?

Pure companions chant celestial hymns,
Each praising the good.
Myriad flowers arise in offering,
Dancing as they descend from heaven.

Jeweled leaves open in the *qipu* gardens,
Precious branches thrive in the Purple Tenuity.
No butterflies are permitted to pluck them—
Ever they soar with the colored *luan*.

For three thousand years in the sacred realm,
The immortal blossoms but once unfurl.
How then at the Golden Register’s convocation
Do they all attend alongside the perfected?

Seats extend for the wind-borne chariots,
Fragrant lamps illuminate the precious altar.
With hearts of cinnabar, what can we offer?
Shattered brocade scattered amid the clouds.

Emerald and green in layered gradation,
Crimson and yellow in shifting depths.
The Craftsman of Transformations must surely be lost—
Carved and wrought, yet without intent.

From the grotto’s censer, incense smoke rises,
The fragrance of the Dao and virtue, effortless.
Of the same root, without differing qi,
Its scent wafts more sweetly still.

*Ten Chants of the Bu Xu*
The Great Ultimate divides high and profound,
The light and pure ascend to heaven’s domain.
Should one cultivate the utmost Dao,
The body becomes a true immortal.

Their ranks number three thousand,
Their time spans forty thousand years.
Upon the cinnabar terrace, the precious canon unfolds,
From golden mouths, its transmission flows.

The Great Brahma, lord of the Three Heavens,
The Five Venerable Ones of the Void Emperor—
Even they scarcely glimpse its subtleties,
How then could it be captured in mere words?

Upon jeweled thrones within the golden hall,
Radiant coronets illuminate the jade portals.
Myriad perfected ones pay homage to the Emperor’s abode,
Flying birds tread the roots of heaven.

Misty as fine haze,
Gently trailing robes of gossamer,
They ascend with the auspicious smoke,
Lightly following the colored *fenghuang*.

Having attended the feast in the jasper chamber,
Suddenly they point toward the grotto-heaven’s return.
Standing by the Fusang’s shore,
They hasten toward the Sun God’s radiance.

Pacing the cloud-nets above,
Heavenly winds suddenly blow.
Drifting hems brush the Dipper’s handle,
Holding fly-whisks, they bow to the banner of Shen.

Lions bear cinnabar tassels,
Qilin lead jade-green chariots.
In flight, they traverse the eight poles—
How often have they witnessed spring’s awakening?

Green locks beneath scarlet headbands,
Azure auroras entwine their feathered robes.
At dawn, they hasten to the Yang Virtue’s hall,
By night, they arrive at the Moon’s Splendor gate.

They toy with the fires of the celestial sphere,
Concealing and emerging like Lu Ji.
The jade chambers cannot detain them—
They soar once more toward the ninefold heavens.

Long ago in the Hall of Extended Grace,
At midnight, the Nine August Ones descended.
Six perfected ones divided left and right,
Yellow mists coiled around the eaves and corridors.

Within the vast palace, the divine lords were revered,
Immortal soldiers guarded the Daoist sanctuary.
Now the filial grandson inherits their resolve,
Inches away, he faces the numinous radiance.

Following the precious canon’s true model,
With cinnabar sincerity, he petitions the heavens above.
Before the ice-like abyss, he stands among the multitudes,
By day and night, he brings forth peace and prosperity.

All things dispel their afflictions,
For three mornings, auspicious signs appear.
The *bu xu* chant now resounds,
As they intone the *Dongxuan* chapters.

Upon the sacred land of the winding isles,
The majestic altar of myriad wonders stands.
Crane-robed feathered guests arrive,
Duck-slippered immortals descend.

Jade ( ) pours the primordial liquor,
Jade cases unveil the great elixir.
With utmost sincerity, how shall we pray?
May the four seas forever remain serene.

Water is sprinkled to subdue demonic palaces,
Lamps illuminate the night’s treasury.
The winds of the nine heavens fall silent,
The qi of the four poles clears.

Whistling, they chant the *Zhuling* melodies,
Soaring through the White Jade Capital.
With utmost sincerity, how shall we pray?
May the nation’s fortune endure in eternal peace.

Across the Central Land, hymns resound afar,
Human voices naturally rise and fall.
Embracing emptiness, they return to the Dao and virtue,
Their cadences harmonizing with the palace’s tones.

Incense smoke lingers in the halls,
Moonlit dew chills the towers.
With utmost sincerity, how shall we pray?
May the harvests forever flourish and banish misfortune.

*Xuanhe Continuation*
Long chanting the jade tones of the *Jinque Bu Xu*,
At the dawn of blue-black primeval chaos,
Golden incense weaves crimson smoke.
At dawn’s flight, all raise their reins,
Bowing before the Jade Emperor.

The Emperor’s heart, vast and at ease,
Bestows upon us the *Tai Ling* canon.
This is the indestructible Dao,
By which the myriad heavens uphold our authority.

We traverse the empty and cavernous,
While lesser immortals grope in its depths.

*Two Chants of the Bu Xu*
The latter composed upon expounding the *Imperially Annotated Daode Jing*, as immortal cranes gathered in flight.

From the primordial of the one qi,
Vast, it preceded the Two Modes.
Precious chariots race like golden steeds,
True incense sprays from jade lotuses.

Through the void, they rein in dragon steeds,
Brahma tones guide the *zhipeng* chariots.
Eternally spanning the long spring kalpa,
They soar through the formless heavens.

To the initial perfected, it is hard to explain—
Thus we admonish the immortals of the middle ranks.

Lofty perfected ones elucidate the Dao and virtue,
Bequeathing to the world five thousand words.
In explanation, we humbly acknowledge our shallowness,
Yet with utmost sincerity, we fathom the wondrous origin.

**Ten "Pacing the Void" Hymns of Jade Capital**

Numinous banners array the sacred canons,
Feathered hymns pierce the cloud-borne chariots.
Auspicious cranes soar through the firmament,
Propitious winds dispel summer’s vexing heat.
The vaulted heavens resound in echo,
May the jeweled throne endure for myriad years.

The Mud-Pill Palace gleams with luminous scenes,
Thus we become Golden Flower Immortals.
Demon kings respectfully receive our charge,
Enabling us to ascend all heavens.
All begins with fasting and precepts,
Layered merits bind past-life verdure.
Soaring through the Great Void,
We uplift the exalted ones.
Guiding the reins to the ten directions,
We circle and rest on the Mysterious Radiance’s slope.
Gazing up at the Kalpa Terrace,
Looking down upon the Purple Cloud Net.
Carefree in the Most High’s capital,
Together we sit upon lotus blossoms.

Through accumulated study, we become Perfected,
Tranquil, our *ying* and *wei* harmonize.
Eternally enjoying boundless longevity,
What are ten thousand kalpas but a trifle?

The Heavenly Worthy gazes upon the cloud-borne carriage,

Without transcendent immortal talent,
How could one indulge such aspirations?

We array our nine-dragon carriage,
Riding the void in carefree ease.
The Eight Heavens lie within our grasp,
The Six Directions—how could they be distant?
All Perfected chant the Cavernous Mystery,
The Most High sings a pure melody.
Fragrant blossoms scatter with the wind,
Jade tones form the Purple Empyrean.
The Five Sufferings burst forth at once,
The Eight Difficulties follow the scriptures’ emptiness.
Wondrous indeed, the Numinous Treasure’s preserve,
Raising this great Dharma-bridge.

The Celestial Emperor Unity’s palace,
Lush and radiant, crowns numinous glory.
Flowing brilliance follows the Dharma-wheel’s net,
Turning through the void into formlessness.
The Void Sovereign plucks the cloud-lute,
All Perfected recite the Cavernous Scripture.
Lofty immortals, solemn in hand-clasped praise,
Through endless kalpas, they preserve integrity.

At times they rein in flying dragons.

Grasping the tally, we subdue demon kings.
Dharma-drums assemble the host of immortals,
Numinous chants—none differ.
Neither this nor that—no fixed form,
Our thoughts commune with the subtle and wondrous.

**Right: Ten "Pacing the Void" Hymns of Jade Capital**

According to the *Scripture of Pacing the Void on Jade Capital Mountain of the Most High*: The Left Immortal Elder Ge Xuan of the Great Ultimate transmitted it to his disciple Zheng Siyuan on Mount Tiantai. Siyuan, in turn, passed it to the Elder’s grandnephew Ge Hong, known as the Master Who Embraces Simplicity. Master Zheng recounted that when the Immortal Elder passed away, he told Siyuan: "The *Supreme Clarity Great Cavern Dao Scripture* you have received shall be entrusted to our family’s disciples, to be transcribed and transmitted through generations. Perfected Ones do not conceal the Heavenly Dao. Truly, the precious jade-casket secret canon’s value lies in its circulation." Moreover, the scripture’s preface records that all the great sagely Heavenly Worthies, emperors, lofty immortals, and Perfected Ones each observed fasts, upheld the Dharma, revered the title of the Void Sovereign Most High, burned incense, scattered flowers, and circumambulated the Seven Treasures’ Mysterious Terrace three times. Reciting and chanting the great hymn chapters of the Empty Cavern, when the Most High praised them, they sang and paced the void—its meritorious virtues profound and wondrous beyond exhaustive description.

Respectfully following the fasting methods in the canon: for three days and nine dawns, within each dawn, ten hymns are sung to complete the cycle. During each dawn’s circumambulation, before the altar assembly proceeds, they first perform the bow of reverence to the Most High, chanting to the final line, then together intone the sound of praise, each bowing once. Next, they begin the circumambulation, treading the cloud-bound net, chanting in harmony. Then the altar assembly, stepping the *ding*-pattern, proceeds slowly. Upon reaching the final line, they together intone the sound of praise, each bowing once. After each hymn, they again intone the sound of praise, each bowing once. Alternatively, for a single day’s three dawns, the ten hymns may be completed within them. The first circumambulation begins with the bow of reverence to the Most High, chanting to the final line, then together intoning the sound of praise, each bowing once. The second circumambulation begins with treading the cloud-bound net, continuing through "Towering, the Mysterious Capital’s mountain" as one hymn, chanting to the final line, then together intoning the sound of praise, each bowing once.

These two hymns, both in oblique tones, are thus chanted together as one. The third circumambulation begins with bowing low and reverently contemplating the Most High, chanting to the final line, then together intoning the sound of praise, each bowing once—this completes the dawn audience. The remaining six hymns are distributed within the noon and evening audiences, one hymn chanted per circumambulation. Thus, the ten hymns are fully completed within the three audiences, conforming to the proper rite for the full recitation of the *Yujing Shan* during the court audience.

When chanting the *Step-Void Hymns*, should even one hymn be omitted, at the moment of ascending the altar to present the court audience and offer prayers, the sincerity of the heart may falter, making it difficult to be witnessed by the august and lofty perfected ones. In all ritual feasts, when ascending the altar to perform the Dao, it is only during the circumambulation and court audience of *Yujing Shan* that one must visualize the golden towers and jade palaces, beholding the sacred countenance of the deities. Only then may one pray for blessings and grace, dispel death and deliver life.

What we now observe in the transmission of the immortal elders is the very voice of Master Zheng. It is meant to be passed down to later generations, that they may follow the prescribed form. Having beheld what is recorded in the scriptures, how could one keep it sealed away? With reverence, it is carved into printing blocks to be shared with all. One must cultivate utmost devotion, casting aside all doubt, that one may receive the protection of the sages and together partake in blessings and fortune.

**Radiant and Luminous**
Radiant and luminous, soaring high,
The ancestral breeze traverses the mysterious.
The Primal Beginning unfolds the circle,
Dispersing the five chapters.
The vermilion script of the sacred register,
Enwrapped by yellow clouds on four sides.
The eight mights stand guard,
Spirit beasts attend the perfected.
Resplendent light adorns the hair,
Reflected incense brushes away dust.
The embroidered confluence stretches long,
Circumambulating past the ten heavens.
Chanting aloud the *Kongdong*,
Treading the *zheng*-step into the profound.
Withered souls ascend to yang,
Ashen bones return to humanity.
The spirit sovereign delivers destiny,
Riding the void, mounting the mist.
In reverent recitation of the *Dong* chapters,
One’s years equal the kalpas.

Above: *Radiant and Luminous* and *Ancestral Office*—the *Dao Sutra of the Heavenly Thearch* from the *Kongdong* sacred hymns. Each of the thirty-two heavens has its own hymn, some in four-character lines, others in five. See the *Kongdong* sacred hymns in the *Dongyuan* section of the *Lingbao* canon.

**Hymn of Upholding the Precepts**
The Dao is the heartless origin,
All things become fields of merit.
Establishing merit has no fixed lord,
Each vow arises from the person.
Emptying the self to respond to sentient beings,
An open heart leaves none unequal.
The great sages exalt the supreme teaching,
Just as rain falls from the heavens.
Lofty peaks embrace all without exception,
Yet the humble become profound.
The sea is king of a hundred rivers,
For it can forsake dragons and scales.
Through ten thousand kalpas, wisdom is preserved—
How could it be limited to one’s own years?

**Hymn of Upholding the Precepts (continued)**
To uphold the precepts without momentary lapse,
Life after life, good affinities are formed.
With focused thought, one contemplates the Great Vehicle—
In time, the truth of the Dao shall be embodied.

**Three Invocations, Three Praises**
Delight in the Dharma as one’s spouse,
Cherish the scriptures as pearls and jade.
Uphold the precepts to restrain the six senses,
Contemplate the Dao to dispel desires.
In tranquility, the upright qi abides;
In serenity, the spirit is still and silent.
Heavenly demons all revere and protect,
Life after life, great blessings are received.
Flourishing are the household and kingdom,
Prospering are the scriptures and the Dao.
Heavenly beings share this vow,
In subtle realms, one enters the Great Vehicle.
From the heart, fields of merit are established,
As the Dharma wheel ascends in boundless ascent.
Seven generations ascend to the heavens,
While this body soars in broad daylight.
The great Dao abides in the profound void—
With thought, none fails to align.
Refining the form to join the immortals,
One attains the adamantine body.
Transcending the three realms’ trials,
The five sufferings of hell are dissolved.
All return to the Supreme Scriptures,
In silent contemplation, bowing in reverence.

**Invocation for the Hall**
To cultivate the Dao, one must be steadfast and resolute,
Gathering faith to refine sincerity.
Burning incense, one turns to the Supreme,
True qi mingles with fragrant smoke.
May the great abundance be revealed,
That seven generations depart the dark underworld.

**Hymn of the Ritual Fast**
The Dao takes fasting as its foremost practice,
Through diligent observance, one ascends the golden portals.

Thus is the great Dharma Bridge established,
To universally ferry all beings and creatures.
Repaying the kindness and virtue of past lives,

To learn immortality, sever all ornate thoughts,
Each念 intertwines and accumulates.

In desolate emptiness, enter profound silence.
Seek the scriptures as if parched with thirst,
Hold resolve firm as metal and stone.
Preserve the child to traverse the Mystic Path,
The Five Spirits bestow the registers of passage.

How could the roots of suffering be eradicated?
Circumambulating, recite the Cavern Chapters,

Aligning and controlling, one opens the Mystic Ultimate,
Riding the current to enter the Central Heaven.
Unveiling the void, one offers the treasure of the heart,
Subtly cultivating the field of the body.

**Hymn of Wisdom**
Wisdom arises from the primordial beginning,
Bright and luminous, it transcends the ten directions.
Weaving the void, it stands in the Mystic Empyrean,
All heavens draw from its flowing fragrance.
Its wonders are beyond comprehension,
Through emptiness, true and real communicate.
Being is ultimately non-being,
Non-being is not without non-being.
Wisdom constantly observes the body,
It is the foremost in learning the Dao.
In subtle subtlety, it roams the Mystic Expanse,
Naturally recording my spirit.

All stars shine brilliantly, the moon’s radiance gleams.
The Primordial Beginning transmitted words, all receive the registers,
The Dao Lord opened the teachings, all return to refuge.
In the Lesser Existence Grotto, the thousand-year herbs,
On the Jade Capital Mountain, the ten-thousand-year peaches.
At the Nine Dragons’ Gate, the perfected saints gather,
By the Eight Immortals’ Terrace, the void-traversing hymns resound.
Three Perfected Jade Maidens hold the flower scepters,
A pair of lads bear the golden censers.
Moon mantles with pearls strung through nine-colored cords,
Cloud robes fragrant, permeating the six-pound hems.

**Five-Character Verse for Scattering Flowers**

Light reins ascend the Purple Clarity,
Primal steed outpaces racing lightning.
From the three heavens of Langfeng,
Gazing down—still visible below.

Jade gates gleam in boundless radiance,
Jasper groves flourish in lush verdure.
Without tempered bones of gold,
How could one fulfill long-cherished vows?

True brightness, how vast and deep,
Merged with light, we roam and feast.
This rare gathering forgets time’s passage,
A thousand years but a single glance.

The Three Palaces emit bright effulgence,
Shining as one with the luminous canopy.
Swiftly the whirlwind carries us,
Upward to pluck the void’s pure blossoms.

Granting me a golden-hued cavern,
Beyond heaven, my jade form gleams.
My heart aligns with the Great Void’s stillness,
In boundless emptiness—what thoughts remain?

Within the mysterious lies supreme joy,
In tranquil non-action, perfect ease.
Only with the truly orthodox as friends,
We drift and soar in carefree play.

Receiving transformation, we condense pure qi,
Refining form to become true immortals.
With wholehearted devotion, we align with the Primal Source,
Returning to the root, harmonizing with nature.

The Supreme Unity gathers in the Final Palace,
Streaming light from the Cinnabar Mystery.
Yuan Ying and Peach Lord,
Recite the Ode of Eternal Life.

A hundred passages wreathed in purple mist,
The whirlwind chariot traverses the vast expanse.
Gently the Eight Radiant Realms unfold,
Unnoticed, the cloud-path stretches far—
In an instant, we wander the Four Heavens.

Fusang births the first light,
Feathered canopies greet the dawn’s glow.
In a flash, we arrive in the Western Realm,
Frolicking in the Golden Mother’s abode.

Azure streams brim with boundless source,
Glowing, they unfold the lotus blooms.
Resplendent the Azure Jasper Palace,
Dazzling, the arrayed jade blossoms.

True qi overflows the Crimson Palace,
Naturally, thoughts remain free of wrong.
Looking down in pity upon mortals,
How turbid the world—truly lamentable!

The Jasper Terrace stands a kalpa’s height,
Solitary, it gleams beyond the Great Veil.
Ever present, the Three Pure Clouds,
Their congealed light soars freely.

Feathered youths drift on bright mist,
Ascending and descending—how ethereal!
Phoenixes and simurghs sound refined melodies,
Perching and soaring in the crimson forest’s peaks.

The Jade Void knows no day or night,
How radiant the numinous light!
One thread leads to the Supreme Capital,
Only then do all heavens seem small.

Glowing, the Azure Flower Grove,
Divine winds stir the jasper branches.
The Three Luminaries know no winter or spring,
One qi—verdant and harmonious.

Turning back, the near ones form a radiant cluster,
Gazing afar, we draw close to the shining web.
Vast and unbounded, we govern the Six Heavens,
Streaming bells subdue the hundred demons.

Endless, the blessings flow unceasing,
Who says the cedar’s age is long?
Lofty sentiments shun excess,
Encountering all things, they birth radiant splendor.

Supreme joy needs no flute or song,
Gold and jade resound in melodious tones.
Now ascending the Terrace of Bright Perfection,
We feast in the Hall of Feathered Splendor.

Misty vapors weave jade clouds,
Subtle fragrance scatters, divine incense wafts.
Heavenly beings, truly distant and vast,
Their joy and peace beyond measure.

From the Supreme Tenuity above,
We hasten to behold the Venerable Sovereign of the Void.
Lifting my Eight Radiant Chariot,
Majestically we enter the Heavenly Gate.

Having ascended the Jade Dawn Court,
Reverently we gaze upon the Purple Portal.
Dare I ask of the Dragon Han’s end,
How was the cosmos opened?

Joyfully setting aside cloud-borne pride,
He reveals to me the words of Yu Yi:
“Fortunate to hear the essence of the utmost truth,
Only now do I see the source of creation.

The Two Qi propagate the ten thousand beings,
The mechanism of transformation knows no rest.
Yet I grasp its beginning,
Thus able to transcend the potter’s wheel.

In the vast desert of emptiness,
All I encounter are the pure and true.
Limpid and lustrous, containing primordial harmony,
Qi naturally draws together in kinship.

Crimson trees bear cinnabar fruit,
Purple mists flow through azure streams.
With this, we preserve the Divine Infant,
Forever transcending form and spirit.”

**Ten Scattering Flowers Verses Composed by Emperor Zhenzong of Song for the Jade Clarity Radiant Response Palace**

Where does one scatter flowers most abundantly?
In heaven above, the Highest Heaven of Great Veil.
Flowers here grow from a different root,
Bathed in auspicious dew and harmonious clouds.

Atop the Kunlun’s peak stands the Tortoise Terrace,
Where wondrous flowers bloom through all four seasons.
Were it not for the assembled immortals paying homage to the Jade Emperor,
How could they reach the mortal world?

Heavenly flowers bloom day and night,
Unlike the world below, awaiting spring’s return.
Each time heavenly beings pluck them,
How often are they offered to the Tiered City?

The Jasper Terrace glows in night’s dewy splendor,
As moon-mantled immortals pay homage at dawn.
At times, celestial flowers descend from the void,
Blown into jade halls, presenting golden forms.

Five-colored blossoms descend upon the Grotto-Heaven,
Gazing upward, their flight through the void is graceful.
Say not that immortal mirrors are ever-present,
For in the mortal realm, they appear but once in myriad ages.

Plucked from the immortal palace,
Scattered upon the jeweled terrace in dawn’s light.
The Jade Tower knows eternal spring,
The Celestial Chart receives boundless fortune.

Feathered adepts ride simurghs in mid-heaven,
Looking down upon the true abodes with earnest hearts.
From Penglai, countless flowers are gathered,
Scattered before the embroidered thrones of the sacred precincts.

The flowers of the Supreme Grove bloom before spring,
The orioles of secluded valleys remain unaware.
Not permitting ordinary folk to pluck them,
All are offered to the blessed lands to honor the true rites.

Within the grotto, thirty-six heavens know spring,
Immortal realms differ from the world of men.
Where do the gathered blossoms go?
Brought to the palaces to honor the exalted perfected.

Immortal officials and true singers come and go frequently,
Gazing upon Penglai and Lang Garden’s spring.
Each time they pluck fragrant flowers to offer the Emperor,
May the blessed lands’ fortune extend to all living beings.

**Eight Hymns of Praise for the Three Paths and Five Sufferings by the Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate and Great Void**

The Three Powers and the ten thousand things,
Interdependent, each has its span.
Beginning and end await the kalpa’s reckoning,
When fortune is exhausted, heaven and earth collapse.

Traversing the Five Paths,
How bitter—repeated death and rebirth!
Turning through the Three Realms,
Coming and going with calamity.

The great wise heed this warning,
Enduring nature, contemplating the severance of desire.
Foolish men do not believe the Dharma,
Their sins and pains ever cling to them.

I grieve that the world’s suffering knows no end,
Thus I earnestly proclaim this truth anew:
If you wish to escape this calamity,
Take refuge in the Supreme Scriptures.

Sin and fortune arise not from elsewhere,
They surely spring from your own being.
The great wise thus seal their lips,
Seeking to extinguish all evil roots.

Extinguishing thoughts, uniting will,
Interdependence awaits ultimate dissolution.
Expounding the Dao to pacify the world,
In the end, one shall perceive its truth.

Envy and jealousy are the root of calamity,
The greatest peril to one’s existence.
Knowing and nurturing such types,
I fear they will surely meet early ruin.

Recognizing evil yet not reforming,
How can this bring peace to the Dao?
Harboring poison while feigning uprightness,
It makes me sigh deeply.

The certainty of past lives is undeniable,
Yet the weak and lost call it nonexistent.
All desire to see it before their eyes,
But once past, they dismiss it as distant.

The great wise illuminate the Dao’s teachings,
Grieving with sorrow for the stubborn and foolish.
Tenderly they ponder the suffering of such beings,
Diligently they cause me deep concern.

Human life wears away to nothing,
Like a flame consuming lamp oil.
The Four Elements briefly converge,
The Five Aggregates provisionally lend form.

In the prime of youth, one ought to study diligently,
Striving to preserve one’s self and soul.
When fortune is exhausted, body and spirit scatter,
Plunging into the dark depths of hell.

The supreme sages, fearing this fate,
Seek the Dao to escape such calamity.
The pursuit of immortality is urgent,
Observing precepts to master the heart’s passions.

Where emptiness and equanimity dwell,
The primal qi abides in rectitude,
And immortals and sages naturally gather.

If you do not trust these sacred words,
Why not retreat to the mountains and forests?
The great wise delight in scriptures and precepts,
Receiving them as treasures for the body.

To embark on study is ever deemed too late,
To cultivate the self is ever rued as too tardy.
By the time one unravels profound mysteries,
In a fleeting instant, the years have aged them.
Clutching the scroll, they sigh in utmost despair,
Soon to face the agony of death’s torment.

Thus, in my youthful years,
I abandoned the world to study the Dao.

Soaring through the nine heavens in song.
