**Hymns of the Immortals: Sacred Eulogies**

**Hymn of the Azure Radiance for Salvation from Suffering**

*Morning Audience*
The Heavenly Worthy vows with boundless compassion,
Delivering all realms and transforming good causes.
The Five Peaks and Four Offices all receive his decree,
While Fengdu’s Northern Bureau halts its punishments.
True talismans descend, granting universal pardon;
Divine youths proclaim deliverance for the condemned.
The Primordial Beginning manifests in wondrous form,
Liberating countless souls—only then is the Dao fulfilled.

*Midday Audience*
The Heavenly Worthy pledges to ferry all beings,
Expounding the Dharma in majesty beneath the jeweled grove.
Nine-headed lions display their auspicious signs,
While wisdom’s light illumines the deepest shadows.
Blade-mountains and sword-trees shatter and fall,
Fires, miasmas, winds, and thunder all cease.
Boundless compassion descends to rescue and deliver—
Even Fengdu’s hells behold his glory.

*Evening Audience*
The Heavenly Worthy’s wisdom uplifts all souls,
Shattering iron citadels at the cry of suffering.
Vast salvation extends to the farthest bounds,
His radiance universally piercing the darkest depths.
Where the breeze of wisdom fans, flames vanish;
Where the Dharma-rain falls, decay blooms anew.
Boundless mercy saves all—
The departed spirits all behold the Merciful One.

**Lady of Supreme Perfection’s Farewell to Ma Mingsheng**

For a time, I leave the walled city,
Commanding my chariot to Mount Tai’s slopes.
Gazing up at the Great Clarity’s gates,
Cloud-palaces rise in towering splendor.
Within the void dwells the Perfected One,
Coming and going in wondrous array.
Refining form to preserve the natural,
Rising and bowing to embrace Great Harmony.
Each dawn, the Nine Heavenly Kings,
Each dusk, I lodge in Western Florescence.
Essence flows, enabling flight,
Inhaling and exhaling to nurture the verdant sprouts.
The supreme elixir is not gold or stone,
Yet the wind sings of its own accord.
Above and below, I soar through luminous skies,
My feathered robes swaying in dance.
The Five Peaks are not my chambers,
The Dark Capital is my true home.
Below, I see the striving mortals,
As foolish as frogs and toads.
Glancing at the dust-laden world,
Their woes entangle them endlessly.
If they have not awakened to the wondrous truth,
Why trouble themselves with carving and polishing?
Disaster gathers when the Dao is leaked,
But secrecy and caution bring abundant blessings.
Once born in the Palace of Kunling,
We discoursed on prolonging heaven’s years.
Though golden nectar grants long life,
It cannot compare to the immortals of Great Harmony.
I ascend the ethereal immortal terrace,
In empty reverie chanting to the divine beings.
Suddenly, I meet the King of Fusang,
The Nine Elders, Perfected of the Immortal Capital.
His purple dragon-chariot arrives,
His sacred countenance so resplendent.
He urges me to seek the long journey,
Inviting me to the ford of spontaneity.
He reveals the art of soaring flight,
Bestows upon me the *Jade Embryo Canon*.
Jadelike essence congeals primordial *qi*,
The White Maiden expounds it for me.
Bending, I draw the fat of the numinous phoenix;
Rising, I ascend the Three Heavens.
Cloud-nets mark your steps—
The Five Peaks may be briefly circled.
How distant is the Dark Capital?
Penglai lies beneath your feet.
Transmission and reception foster love,
Bonding as immortals and celestial beings.
Guard it well, and you wander free of judgment;
Disaster spares neither fool nor sage.
Keep it secret, and you enjoy eternal stability;
Reveal it, and your body and life collapse.

**Ode of the Right Radiant Lady of Cloud Forest**
**Ode of Yang the Perfected to Director Xu**

**Ode of the Right Radiant Lady of Cloud Forest**
**Ode of Yang the Perfected to Director Xu**

Swiftly I chariot through the Eight Voids,
Turning to feast in the Eastern Flowery Chamber.
The Celestial Mother invites me to her terrace,
Clear-voiced, I tread the numinous wind.
I came with purpose awaiting,
Thus I crossed the Azure Waves.
Soaring, I mount the cloud-lit axle;
Floating, I gaze upon the rosy void above.
The cloud-carriage dances free,
The purple canopy cradles the sacred realm.
Crimson mists coil the banners,
Feathered robes fan fragrant winds.
Thunder roars, fierce beasts howl,
Lightning hums, the dark dragon stirs.
Jade flutes resound in the courtyard,
Golden chimes sing to the divine bell.
I pluck magic mushrooms by the Azure Waves,
Gather blossoms on the Eightfold Pure Peaks.
My crimson countenance renews daily,
Though eons pass, I remain a child.
Nurturing form in the eastern stillness,
The Seven Spirits commune as one.
Yet worldly dust bears sorrow,
Felling my white-haired elder.
Long have I sighed in distant gloom,
Regretting not fleeing sooner.
I halt my chariot as the Moon’s Charioteer moves,
Turn my wheels back to the Azure Waves.
Never have I glimpsed such a one’s wanderings,
Yet fleetingly I wonder—how might I find peace?
Awaiting the verdant spring,
I shall unburden my heart’s forgetting.

I rein in the light, floating through purple mist,
Beholding the Eight Sceneries upon the Fen’s flow.
Feathered youths bear jade nectar,
Jade blossoms feast on numinous fat.
We pledge by the White Water’s edge,
Raising my withered pearl.
The Azure Chamber gleams with eastern dawn,
The Purple Creation drifts in crimson morn.
Twin virtues uphold the Dao’s essence,
Fortifying the Perfected Lord’s domain.
The Eight Terraces lie before my gaze,
Northward, I see naught but soaring void.
In cloud-borne clarity, I watch,
Dimly treading the shifting light.
Exhaling the Dongling’s splendor,
Hiding my radiance in the eastern hills.
Long have I dwelled among mortal affairs,
Yet never a moment idle.
How unlike the ease of transforming my form,
Returning to this childlike face.

At dawn, the Great Rosy Palace rises,
Jade chambers ascend in celestial purity.
I chant the Three Wondrous Visions,
Floating light soars through the utmost void.
Cinnabar blossoms bloom in the heavens,
Golden reflections nurture vital essence.
The Eight Winds stir brocade robes,
Verdant trees illumine the Four Numinous Ones.
The floral canopy shades orchid radiance,
Purple reins urge the green carriage.
Pledging faith, I commune with spirits,
Touching all with celestial sincerity.
Why seek outward signs?
Soon you shall behold jade and jasper.
The Three Sceneries flourish in dark mystery,
Dawn’s glow brightens the Eight Directions.
Crimson clouds float above the high palace,
Carefree, I ride the numinous wind.
Flapping wings, I mount the white whirlwind,
Rising to gaze within the jade terrace.
The green canopy enters the harmonious dawn,
The azure carriage hurls through empty space.
To the right, I bow to the Eastern Grove’s Emperor,
Ascending to court the Great Void’s Sovereign.
Jade guests carve phoenix brain,
Roaring, we drink the flying elixir.
Cloud hooks coil in the winding chamber,
A thousand notes ring clear and resonant.
Brocade banners summon fierce beasts,
Floral pennants sway and dip.
Fragrant mothers bend in song,
Purple mists part the rafters.
I gather reins at the lofty pure gate,
Loose my chariot in the fair one’s chamber.

Of old, fate’s signs lay hidden,
Spiritual transformation followed *qi*’s flight.
My heart, distant, sensed the dark shore,
Years passed like towering cedars.
My form, sullied, craved foul scents,
Movement and stillness lost the Azure Waves.
Yet my friend is not thus—
Yesterday’s glory and shame are forgotten.
Crimson light floats in the dark dawn,
The purple chariot rides the misty journey.
Above, I transcend the Green Gate’s depths,
Below, I gaze upon the Vermilion Fire City.
Eastern dawn unfurls vast radiance,
Divine light illumines the Seven Numinous Ones.
Veiled brilliance drifts like three torches,
Flowing freely, I equal the void.
Winds coil through the hollow universe,
Fragrant notes arise with each measure.
Hand in hand, I dance with the Weaving Maiden,
Shoulder to shoulder in the Gourd Court.
To the left, I circle the Azure Feather Banner,
The floral canopy follows the clouds’ tilt.
Feasting beyond the Nine Degrees,
Right and wrong no longer concern me.
Drawing the true, I nest in the Great Stillness,
My golden form grows ever more childlike.
How unlike the defiled world,
Where life is bleak and joyless.

Four banners gleam in the bright void,
Vermilion chariots fly to the numinous mound.
The jade canopy answers the Seven Sceneries,
Flapping wings float above the clouds.
Nine notes resound in the purple void,
Jade chimes echo through the Great Nothingness.
Feasting and chanting in the Three Dawn Palaces,
Singing and calling to my kindred.
Unnoticed, the cedar’s age has come,
How could I know the Two Lights’ flow?
Though the fair one has forgotten all,
A hundred sorrows remain uncast.
The long forest is truly still,
The cliffs hold many delights.
Northward, I ascend the Gate of Dark Perfection,
Hand in hand, we weave the lofty net.
Fragrant smoke scatters the Eight Sceneries,
The dark wind stirs the crimson waves.
Above, I transcend the Jasper Garden Ford,
Below, I gaze upon the Cloudy Mound’s slopes.
Jade flutes play above the clouds,
Phoenix cries shake the Nine Distances.
Riding *qi*, I float through the Great Void—
Why tread the mountain slopes?
With golden tally, I command the feathered spirits,
Leading troops to vanquish ten thousand demons.
Together, we draw the twin dawn’s radiance,
A thousand springs remain childlike.
Losing the true, I plunged into the competitive world,
Helpless, I could not fathom how.
Gazing upward at the Great Rosy Palace,
The golden pavilion gleams in purple purity.
The Flowery Chamber reflects the Great Simplicity,
Four chariots all of vermilion jasper.
Hurling wheels through the hollow ford,
Gathering reins to dance the green carriage.
Jade blossoms fly like cloud canopies,
The Western Consort wields brocade banners.
Suddenly, I turn from the dust’s filth,
Swiftly entering the fair one’s court.
Long-held feelings summon the Perfected’s descent,
The one I sought already dwells in darkness.
Riding the wind, I play the dawn’s music,
Together we drink deep from the cinnabar grove’s urns.
Lords and nobles are but fleeting shadows—
How could they know the Perfected’s numinosity?

At dawn, I draw the crimson dawn,
Gathering *qi* to wander above the clouds.
Circling the carriage through winding waves,
I witness the world’s sorrows.
Words and intent arise like lush growth,
Not scattering the Three Magic Mushrooms.
How much better to roam the Dark Realm,
Striking the chimes for your delight.
Your heart knows no bounds—
My wish holds nothing within.
Reining in the light, I ascend the dawn,
Roaming and feasting in the Azure Waves’ palace.
Colored clouds entwine the cinnabar dawn,
Divine mists scatter into the void.
The Highest Perfected chant in the jade chamber,
Lofty immortals sing in the numinous hall.
Nine phoenixes sing the vermilion pipes,
Hollow notes mingle with feathered chimes.
We nest together in the Golden Court,
Bonding as friends in the dark.
Together, we draw from the jade nectar’s spring—
In a flash, we are children again.
Why crouch in the path’s way,
Letting illness grow with each day?
At dawn, I wander the Great Simplicity’s palace,
Reining my carriage to gaze upon the Jade River.
At dusk, I feast in the secluded chamber,
At dawn, I pluck the round light’s blossoms.
Striking the chimes on the Northern Cold Terrace,
The Seven Numinous Ones gleam with purple dawn.
Solemnly, the lofty immortals rise,
While dust-bound mortals weave their nets.
I linger amidst the clamor and mist—
My transgressions should not be many.
Charioting *qi*, I speed through the cloud carriage,
At dawn, I ascend the Great Tranquil Mound.
The Crimson Ford connects the trembling peaks,
Clear waves surge in the deep flow.
Stepping through the void, I observe the Nine Wefts—
The Eight Nets have all been traversed.

Briefly I feast on the Three Gold’s bloom,
Then come to observe the steadfast company.
Diligence and sloth cannot conceal each other—
Thus a hundred sorrows accumulate.
Treading waves, I cross the Azure Billows,
Suddenly arriving at Golden Mountain.
Gazing all around, I wander the day long,
Yet few are the cloud-borne ones like me.

Purple towers rise into the void,
Dark halls pierce the howling gales.
Jewels and jades adorn the numinous gardens,
Blossoms of splendor weave into jasper and jade.
I rein my carriage at the Azure Ford,
The Eight Winds stir the Cloud Shao.
Fanning the northern shade with feathered fans,
I grasp the staff and sound the golden flute.
Phoenix pipes harmonize with a thousand bells,
While the Western Lads sing at dawn.
My heart opens beyond the void,
My spirit’s robe—how vast and bright!

I whirl in dance on the Great Void Ridge,
The Six Qi turn through layered depths.
How could my path be traced,
To let you remain unwaning?
Dark waves churn the azure tides,
Vast fords surge with myriad streams.
I chariot the light, gazing through the Six Voids,
Longing to wander with the fair one.
Her exquisite song does not answer me—
To whom may I offer my clear tones?
She wheels her jade carriage through the clouds—
Why should she hasten in the dust?

Pines □ grow on the Dark Ridge,
Thriving as frost-forest lords.
Lush blossoms flourish on stern ice,
Unfearing of white snow.
In troubled times, deep within layered peaks,
My wandering life keeps the Dao ever pure.
I fly these unbridled wheels,
Tracing the tracks of distant ones.
Lords and marquises may come and go—
Why can they not sever ties?
I aspire to contend in the eastern hills,
To shade my light and nest in the numinous cave.

Hushed and still, the tranquil courtyard,
Shaded by verdant, dense woods.
The round radiance gleams through the southern window,
The Crimson Wind fans the secluded chamber.
Within the quiet room, I clasp my robe,
Together we vow to unlock the wondrous art.
Vast and bright, my thoughts reach the profound,
Desolate and free, my spirit’s heart takes flight.
I give free rein to my heart through the empty ford,
Tempering my reins, urging the crimson carriage.
Why does the fair one come so late?
When will the foremost virtue be achieved?

Parables must be heeded—
To ignore them is heartless.
How may I chariot fleeting traces
To seek this cloud-borne spirit?
Subtle tones bear true meaning—
Guard them well, do not take them lightly.
Affairs align with the divine mechanism—
Preserve yourself to witness great peace.

I rein the light down to the Azure Billows,
Leaping across the Green Sea’s ford.
Crimson mists swirl through the Great Yang,
Feathered canopies tilt the Nine Heavens.
The cloud carriage floats through the void,
In an instant, between the azure waves.
I come to seek friends in the realm of truth,
To join hands and attend the Emperor at dawn.

The Jade Youths harmonize with luminous virtue,
Together they summon the jade sages.
Below, they gaze upon the Eight River Palace,
Above, they repose on the peaks of the Rare Grove.
Sipping this purple jade’s richness,
Only then do they know the toil of the filthy path.
Where now is the fair one?
Only through diligence may one draw near.

Crimson towers part the vast skies,
I push through the vermilion gates to ascend the light-chamber.
Purple banners flutter in the clouds,
The Feathered Dawn dances the Eight Winds.
I halt my canopy by the emerald stream,
Gathering blossoms on the Moon-Sustaining Peak.
I chew the Three Numinous Blossoms,
Inhaling and exhaling the Nine Spirit Rays.
The count of spring trees knows no end,
Harmonizing with the sun, nurturing the young and ignorant.

Hand in hand, we enter the Hall of Luminous Truth,
Looking up to await the Supreme Emperor.
The Northern Hook sings with the Feathered Ones,
Jade and mystery dazzle the assembly of worthies.
The music ends.

Why, in this world of waves and billows,
Do gain and loss toll for me?
I crane my neck within the clamorous court,
Opening my heart to the filth’s onslaught.
Habituated to the realm of glory and disgrace,
Rarely do I tread the Rare Grove’s palace.
Is a moment’s stillness truly so bitter?
Try departing to gaze upon the Azure Billows.

Worldly treasures mingle in fragrant exchange,
The Dao’s lineage convenes in the dark skies.
I shake my robes to seek the true domain,
Turning my carriage at the edge of wind and dust.
Virtue shines with dark radiance,
Sharpness gathers in flourishing splendor.
Secret words bring abundant blessings,
Serene stillness esteems true nobility.
Ever should the two images be followed,
Hand in hand, sharing the same sash.
Why, amidst human affairs,
Do troubles arise daily?

With heart I promise the axe-bearer,
Saying, “I shall gather the five mushrooms.”
“If you do not find the mushroom grass,
You too cannot come.”
“If you come, you may find it—
The mushroom grass shall be yours to eat.”

*In Praise of the Supreme Lord’s Scripture of Wisdom and the True One*

To learn immortality, sever worldly thoughts,
Each thought building upon the last.
Coming and going disturb my spirit,
Restless, it traverses all.
Extinguish thoughts, dwell in empty stillness,
Whispering into the void’s silence.
Seek the scripture as if parched with thirst,
Hold fast to your resolve like metal and stone.
Preserve your childlike spirit on the dark flight,
The Five Spirits pass through talismanic registers.
Cross me over the Six Perfections,
Thus may I untie the Three Nets.

Purify with fasting, worship the Great Simplicity,
Exhale and inhale to nurture the cloud-teeth.
Roaming within the Golden Towers,
Jade Capital is my home.
Naturally, the Seven Treasures arise,
Each person seated upon a lotus.
Above, I chew the dark metropolis’s fruit,
Below, I hold the empty ford’s wild rice.
My countenance shines like ten suns,
Why reckon the eons’ multitude?

The Dharma drum summons the heavenly immortals,
The ringing bell subdues the great demons.
The numinous wind fans fragrant blossoms,
Resplendent, unfolding the lush robes.
The Supreme Truth strokes the cloud zither,
The assembled immortals pluck the spirit harp.
Elegant songs resound in the Three Heavens,
Dispersing wisdom in the Jade Flower Grove.
Seven ancestors ascend the Hall of Blessings,
Thus they tread the dark tones.

If past lives’ virtue was insufficient,
This scripture remains distant and hard to find.
If faith in the Dao is not wholehearted,
Aspiring to flight only leads to sinking.
The Supreme Lord’s effortless Dao
Expands within the hearts of all beings.
To learn the Dao, trust sincerely,
Revere your teacher as your closest kin.
Bow to the light, pair with the pure void,
Diligently renewing with each passing day.

Until all people are delivered,
I shall not deliver myself.
Great vows demand profound repayment,
Dark virtue is wholly trustworthy.
Hidden evils and deep sins
Confront one like a turning wheel.
To learn the Dao is also bitter,
Morning and night, cultivate the field of blessings.
Planting virtue is like planting trees—
Deep roots yield abundant fruit.
If you can delight in the profound,
You shall soar to the clear heavens.

Cultivate this effortless Dao,
And you shall form bonds with the good.
The Supreme Lord expounds the ultimate Dao,
The scriptures and books of wisdom.
To lift suffering requires great talent,
To transcend the mundane is to attain truth.
Your spirit’s bearing is rare in this world,
Glowing like a lotus in the deep.
Each person’s conduct has its roots,
All stemming from past lives’ merit.
To establish virtue, act in due time,
Make vows—none shall go unanswered.
Good and evil both await their recompense,
The principle of rise and fall is unfathomable.

Worthy ones uphold the Dharma’s words,
Virtue and power lie in forgetting both.
To comprehend this is great wisdom,
To ascend as the Supreme Pole Lord.
Jewel canopies link to jade carriages,
Commanding the chariot, driving the nine dragons.
Golden blossoms hold the Cavern Scripture,
Fragrant incense is borne by all the immortal lads.
Whistling and singing, they reach the Dark Metropolis,
Striking jade, knocking upon jade bells.

*In Praise of Wu Zi’s Portrait*

Unworthy Wu Zi,
Knowing fate, he follows truth,
His aspiration lies in the profound and plain,
His heart delights in pure poverty.
He traverses the myriad mountains,
A minnow-like solitary self.
His learning has not yet illuminated the Dao,
His form merely preserves the spirit.
Mountains and waters are his home,
His shadow and form his neighbors.
Clad in cloth robes and grass belts,
Deer-hide caps and gauze kerchiefs,
He feeds on pine seeds and drinks from springs,
Crossing Shu, passing Qin.
The Great Dao is dim and distant—
Who is my teacher?
Gazing upon the world below,
He longs for those celestial guests.
His yearning knows no end,
Vague and formless, yet ever near.

All day in his thatched hall at ease,
The clear wind comes and goes.
His ears untroubled by worldly affairs,
His heart at play with drifting clouds.
Facing wine, he thinks only of the moon,
Feasting on pine, he never tires of mountains.
Often chanting *Neijing*,
Naturally preserving a youthful face.

This life, these things—his livelihood,
White stones and green pines his home.
Lying beneath the moon, nestled in clouds like a wild deer,
Often buying wine to intoxicate with mist and rosy clouds.
Secluded in solitary wandering,
A minnow-like lone figure,
He drinks the fallen dew of magnolia,
Clothes himself in the shed feathers of black cranes.
Seeking no profit in the human world,
Renouncing fame beneath the heavens—
Such is the Daoist who dwells in mountains.
Having inscribed this, he shakes his robes, gathers his staff, and departs,
None know where he has gone.

*The Immortal Bestows the Ode of Everlasting Years*
In clear autumn, with nothing to do,
He rides the mist to distant skies.
Relying on a woodcutter’s words,
He pledges to meet in everlasting years.

*Li Gongzuo’s Poem for the Immortal’s Servant*
I possess a pearl within my robe,
Unbothered by the dust upon it.
I hold the principle of long life,
Unwearied by this embodied form.
In the divine grottoes of Jiangnan,
I shall merge with their truth.
Unashamed of marketplace bonds,
I come to save the world’s people.
Su Zi’s traces are gone,
Yet the simple and ignorant may still draw near.
Say not the Eastern Sea has changed—
Heaven and earth endure in eternal spring.

*Ju Haoran’s "Ode to Drifting the Empty Boat"*
When traveling, clouds are my companions,
When seated, wine is my friend.
My belly is filled with the unchanging,
My robes patched with clouds and rosy dawn.
Jie’s tyranny and Yao’s benevolence—
Alas, both have turned to dust.
Oars and paddles need no aid,
Freely drifting like duckweed.
At dawn, floating in the radiance of the rising sun,
At dusk, shaded by the clear moon’s glow.
Those who toil for merit and fame—
Their bones crumble into mud and sand.
Having drunk Ju’s wine,
I board Ju’s boat once more.
Thus is the spirit purified,
Transcendent and carefree, without sorrow.

*The Ode of the Mysterious Echo*
This echo is no valley’s sound,
My heart knows it is from divine immortals.
Never leaving my ears,
High and low like autumn cicadas.
At night, its voice grows urgent,
By day, it softens.
The divine repels all evil,
Granting me the might of the wind.
This wondrous sound knows no pause,
Day and night, it endlessly revolves.
Not by chance—
A messenger from the celestial realms descends.
How to discern its divine response?
One must find a ladder and mediator.
Since the mysterious echo arrived,
It is as if a true immortal has come.
The thought lingers in my heart,
Turning and turning without cease.
How lovely the crisp, refreshing night—
Listening in stillness to the autumn cicadas’ song.

*The Immortals’ "Ode of Treading the Void"*
Floating, floating, they ascend the clouded path,
Dimly vanishing into the endless dawn.
The starry palaces grow ever distant,
The kalpas of time stretch far.
Gazing up, the golden countenance of virtue is hidden,
Longing turns to await the divine whirlwind.
Would that I could ride the rosy dawn’s wings,
Burn incense and bow in reverent audience.

The mystic wind turns the flying canopy,
Purple qi suffuses the immortal’s chariot.
Floating in the void without need of steeds,
Suddenly they ascend into nothingness.
Lingering, they lament the world below,
Glancing back to pity the multitudes.
The true transformation of the Three Origins complete,
A minnow-like figure enters the Great Void.
Myriad qi float upward,
A thousand lights merge with the Supreme Subtlety.
Gazing from the heavens at the canopies of flowers,
In the emptiness, they behold the rosy-hued robes.
True forms enter the clouded path,
Orbs of radiance follow the wind in flight.
Would that I might attend the Three Origins’ assembly,
To return borne by the golden countenance’s motion.

Auspicious light soars with purple qi,
The celestial path glides through cinnabar skies.
Banners wave, turning the fragrant wind,
Canopies stir, surpassing floating mist.
Within the Dao, there is still the Dao,
Within the profound, there is yet the profound.
The true light knows no bounds,
The Great Dao ultimately has no form.
The Dharma Wheel turns of itself,
The subtle sound cannot be heard.
In emptiness, awaiting the Three Treasures,
In the void, hearing the *Cavern Scripture*.
Seven transformations, the wandering soul returns,
Myriad qi arrest the decline of years.
Fragrant winds waft the feathered canopy,
Floating qi turn the whirlwind chariot,
Cold and clear, they ascend the clouded path,
Faint and distant, they enter the endless void.
Gazing back, they pity the dust-bound mortals,
In due time, they expound the sacred scriptures.
The wondrous fruit harmonizes with this day,
The profound accord naturally aligns.

*The Great Lord of the Azure Youth Often Chants*
To plant the roots of extinction,
One must uproot the seeds of life and death.
Sighing, one sinks into the Nine Springs—
All for clinging to this bodily form.

*The Lady of Southern Marchmount’s Composition for Prefect Xu*
The numinous valley’s elegant ripples coil,
Hiding her form, she dwells in the mountain’s capital.
Clad in coarse cloth, equal to dragon-robes,
Girded in plain silk, matching jade pendants.
Her form roams the distant and secluded,
Her spirit soars in the rosy dawn’s court.
Above the heavens, there are steps of worthies,
In the void, there are true voices.
Gazing up, I ride the winding morning flight,
Following this green-hued carriage.
Looking down upon the Eight Degrees,
I sigh at the world’s dust and coils.
Liberated from the waves’ entanglement,
I ascend this distant, distant self.
Anxieties end as the Three Fordings dry,
The rush of time severs your fleeting years.

*The Lady of Southern Marchmount’s Composition*
Beyond wondrous images, the profound resonance calls itself.
Cloud-script swirls in the purple dawn,
Orchid winds fan the green-hued carriage.
The Supreme Ones feast in the jade terrace,
Far removed as the standard of earthly immortals.
What they await is noble and far-reaching,
Thus they excel in outstanding brilliance.
Delighting in those Eight Pure Writings,
The Dao is perfected in the Six Distant Realms.
How can worldly affairs be foreseen?
They cause your form and qi to dissipate.
