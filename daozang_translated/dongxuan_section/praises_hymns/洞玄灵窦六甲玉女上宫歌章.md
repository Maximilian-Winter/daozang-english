**Hymn of the Jade Maiden of the Left Numinous Flight of the Great Mystery Palace of Jiazi (甲子太玄宫左灵飞玉女歌章):**

The Great Mystery abides in pure emptiness,
Jade *qi* illumines the lofty numen.
Round splendor veils the Nine Images,
Green Brahma-light gleams with soaring azure.
Beneficent radiance descends at the cloud’s edge,
Flowing fragrance burns upon cinnabar jade.
The Azure Phoenix spurs the crimson reins,
Guiding the chariot to feast in the cloud camp.
Within my formless realm, I rejoice—
Heaven and Earth give me life.
The Wheel turns, the Three Primes shine bright,
Thus I deliver all from endless age.
Through kalpas in accord with transformation,
*Qi* merges with the Four Constants.
Within the hollow emptiness dwells the Real—
Who fathoms the name of the Great Mystery?
Void-reflection holds the child of intent;
Return to the Real, descend in your form.
Attain union through silent contemplation,
Cast off burdens, guard against outward striving.
Accumulated resonance enters the Great Void,
The Great Void sends down the green chariot.
Roaming and feasting in the Palace of Eternal Yang,
I ascend in flight to the Jade Clarity.
Wandering at the edge of the Nine Precipices,
I advance in homage to the Jade Emperor’s court.
To the left, I inhale the crimson moon’s splendor;
To the right, I draw the Vast and Falling Star.
The Three Luminaries unite in radiant glory—
How could Heaven and Earth ever incline?

**Hymn of the Jade Maiden of the Left Numinous Flight of the Yellow Prime Palace of Jiaxu (甲戌黄素宫左灵飞玉女歌章):**

The Yellow Prime dwells in profound emptiness,
Divine light blazes across the Great Void.
The Soaring Unfettered is the Great Primal One,
Its power harmonizes with the Ten Perfected Pair.
Numinous movement arises from the hidden record,
The mysterious tally holds its own illumination.
Jade Emptiness gleams in the jasper chamber,
Golden radiance reveals the cinnabar countenance.
The Crimson Phoenix spurs the divine reins,
Wandering in ascent to the Palace of Supreme Clarity.
Within the formless, the Mystery reflects—
Loosening my robe, I feast in Eternal Yang.
The Five Thearchs open the numinous path,
The wondrous formula returns to the Yellow Chamber.
The spirit soars, moved by the silent court;
Silent thought pierces the Nine Heavens.
The numinous hymn governs the hidden movement,
A hundred harmonies weave into a single composition.
Profound subtlety communicates the wondrous essence,
Revealing the inexhaustible method.
Those who attain the Supreme Dao
Bear upon their necks the radiant jewel-light.
Darkly, darkly, they return to the wondrous gate,
Entering the One, the myriad Perfected commune.
Embodying the Dao of spontaneity,
I ride the void, needing no dragon.
The Three Primes descend in the flying chariot,
Flowing clouds revolve in purple and yellow.
Ascending in luminous flight through the empty firmament,
I rein in my steed to pay homage to the Jade Emperor.

**Hymn of the Jade Maiden of the Left Numinous Flight of the Great Prime Palace of Jiashen (甲申太素宫左灵飞玉女歌章):**

The Great Prime clarifies the Han River’s expanse,
The vast numen divides the Nine Pendants.
The Dao gives birth to the Great Primal One,
Transforming into the Pearl of Heaven and Earth.
Void-reflection repays the Highest Above,
Glancing below, clouds suddenly vanish.
The Five Peaks may be forsaken,
But not the thoroughfare of the Nine Heavens.
At times, I feast in the Palace of Eternal Yang,
Spurring clouds, driving the phoenix chariot.
The flying wheel veils the hollow emptiness,
Purple mist and Mystery support one another.
Carefree, I soar above the layered void,
Turning my gaze to survey the Eight Directions.
An aeon passes in an instant—
How could I sense the passage of ten thousand kalpas?
Music of the steps follows the turning of fate,
Preserving the Real without end.
Each may pursue their own aspiration for the Dao,
In stillness and silence, we seek one another.
Accumulating subtleties, I resonate with spontaneity,
Thus attaining the talisman of cinnabar.
My body enters the Ford of No Harm,
My form rejoices, my heart delights.
Riding the void, I swiftly fly through clouds,
Gazing upward, I join the company of lofty immortals.

**Hymn of the Jade Maiden of the Right Numinous Flight of the Crimson Palace of Jiawu (甲午绛宫右灵飞玉女歌章):**

The Crimson Palace holds the Supreme Dao,
The Cavern Yang blazes with the Great Perfected.
Cinnabar numen illumines the jasper chamber,
Intertwining winds revolve the purple mist.
The Eight *Qi* veil the layered void,
Flowing fragrance brushes the flying dust.
Dragon and phoenix flex their cloud-wings,
The spirit races between being and non-being.
Roaming and gazing across the Ten Directions,
I ride the void, delighting in the Nine Mysteries.
Numinous movement is not of myself—
The Dao arises from the Highest Above.
Hidden transformation has its own reckoning,
My true self follows the law of spontaneity.
The wondrous melody issues from the hollow emptiness,
Notes and tones weave into immortality.
The numinous flight unfolds the Dao’s source,
Awakening the bodies of later learners.
Void-reflection attains utmost purity and stillness,
Silent thought naturally enters the spirit.
My descent has its own cause—
For now, I halt the flowering years.
The Dao fills, the movement flies with me,
My body ascends to the Nine Heavens.

**Hymn of the Jade Maiden of the Right Numinous Flight of the Palace of Homage to Essence of Jiachen (甲辰拜精宫右灵飞玉女歌章):**

Homage to Essence conceals the layered void,
Numinous purity descends in clear yang.
The right division aligns with the true luminaries,
Brocade mantle and flying silk robe.
Fading clouds reflect the resplendent sash,
Crimson hues suffuse the jade countenance.
Spurring the phoenix, I rein the Mystery,
Darkly real, I dwell in the Palace of Eternal Yang.
Wandering above the auspicious clouds,
I gaze across the Six Directions’ chambers.
Bending low, I instruct those who cultivate me,
Awakening the numinous in the unenlightened.
Movement attains resonance with spontaneity,
The Dao’s fruition is not my own achievement.
Refining thought, I reflect the Real in emptiness,
Thus attaining audience with the Jade Emperor.

**Hymn of the Jade Maiden of the Right Numinous Flight of the Azure Waist Palace of Jiayin (甲寅青腰宫右灵飞玉女歌章):**

The Azure Waist gives birth to the Dao’s root,
Yang begins, styled the Essence of Wisdom.
It oversees the *qi* of the Supreme Mystery,
The right division governs the Three Numinous.
Parting and uniting, the Eight Luminaries move,
Roaming and transforming without hindrance.
Subtly, subtly, it reaches the Cavern Origin,
Veil upon veil, the Nine Voids are pure.
Within dwells the wondrous numinous maiden,
Above in brocade, below in flying azure.
Riding the void, she spurs the Crimson Phoenix,
Swiftly driving the chariot toward the Five Stars.
Revolving winds carry fragrant blossoms,
Purple clouds bear aloft the flying jade.
She joins in covenant with the transcendent guests,
Loosening her robe in the City of Nine Phoenixes.
The wondrous melody sings in the void,
Jade tones harmonize of themselves.
Notes and tones blend in mysterious accord,
Mysterious transformation arises without bound.
Those who master this hymn,
With a single recitation, rejoice for ten thousand ages.
The Western Palace binds the Primal Record,
The Eastern Florescence records the immortals’ names.
Leading my companions of Eternal Yang,
Bending the Real, I descend in your form.
Through accumulated cultivation, I resonate with the Mystery,
The Three Primes send down the green chariot.
Ascending in luminous flight above the rosy clouds,
I advance in homage to the Supreme Thearch’s court.

**Here end the Hymns of the Jade Maidens of the Six Jia of the Cavern Mystery Numinous Treasure in the Upper Palace.**
