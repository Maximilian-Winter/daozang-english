*The Biography of Immortal Master Shen of Yunfu Mountain*

*Scripture Title:* *The Supplemented Biography of Immortal Master Shen of Yunfu Mountain*. Author unknown. One fascicle. Base text from the *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Section of Cave Mysteries*, *Category of Genealogies and Records*.

Immortal Master Shen bore the surname Shen and the given name Taizhi, with the courtesy name Guangxiang.

His ancestral home was Luoyang, and his lineage descended from Shen Bo of the Zhou dynasty. Thus, the *Book of Poetry* states: *"The great mountains sent down spirits, giving birth to Fu and Shen."* Shen Bo’s virtue was gentle, kind, and upright; he spread prosperity across the four seas and possessed great merit. King Xuan of the Zhou court bestowed upon him a grand chariot and four horses, granting him the southern lands as his domain, where his descendants continued without interruption.

By the Han dynasty, the illustrious Ancestor Shen emerged, living to over eighty years of age. Emperor Wu, having heard of him, dispatched a comfortable carriage drawn by four horses to welcome him and appointed him Grand Master of the Palace. His later descendants settled in Changsha, many attaining the honor of serving as ministers or chancellors. Those who dispersed and settled in other regions are too numerous to record.

The ancestral lineage of our forebears flowed and flourished in Shaoling County of Shaozhou—now Liutang Village of Renfeng Township in Shaoyang County of Baoqing Prefecture. They chose their dwelling with care, erecting grand gates and lofty doors. His parents embodied reverence, love, compassion, forbearance, filial piety, and constant kindness.

One evening, his mother, Lady Yang, dreamed of a divine being descending from the heavens, holding a stalk of purple *zhi* fungus. The spirit crumbled it into pellets, mixed them with water, and had Lady Yang swallow them. She awoke filled with joy and awe. At dawn, she recounted the dream to her clan. Someone remarked, *"Purple zhi is no ordinary thing—this must be an auspicious omen."* Soon after, she conceived.

In the third year of *Chuigong* during the reign of Empress Wu Zetian of the Tang, in the *dinghai* year of the sexagenary cycle, on the fifth day of the eighth month at the hour of *chen*, he was born. At that moment, divine radiance blazed brilliantly, and auspicious *qi* filled the air. Near and far, people rejoiced, marveling at such joy.

As the immortal elder grew, his bearing and wisdom were extraordinary. Keen and studious, he mastered the Six Classics, excelled in composition, and strictly guarded against sensual desires, abstaining from meat and fish. Though his family was not wealthy, whenever he saw others in need, he gave generously according to his means. He bore no grudges against those who wronged him.

Upon encountering the scriptures and canons of the Daoist teachings, he grasped their essence at a single glance.

Upon his father’s passing, a divine being guided him to a site, where he buried him at Red Official Mountain to establish the grave, fulfilling his filial duty without the slightest lapse. Before long, he turned his heart away from worldly affairs, preferring seclusion, and grew distant from relatives and friends, yearning instead for the ways of divine transcendents.

One day, with mind serene and thoughts purified, he journeyed to the Southern Marchmount’s Vermilion Mound Grotto-Heaven. As he trod the jagged cliffs, beneath the shade of trees atop the Peak of Blazing Brightness, he sat upon a rock and sighed: “This place is most refined—why should I not dwell here in verdant solitude?” Suddenly, an old man in a yellow cap and rustic robes, his beard and temples snowy white, strolled leisurely toward his resting spot. The immortal elder rose and bowed in greeting. The old man asked: “Who are you, sighing here?” The immortal elder replied: “I am from Shaoling. Passing through these wondrous peaks, I have grown fond of this tranquil retreat. Yet my destiny is meager, and I cannot stay long—hence my sighs.” The old man said: “Sacred mountains and numinous traces abound everywhere. Why seek afar what lies near? In the land where you dwell, north of Cloud Mountain, atop the summit of Yu Lake, where lotus blooms take root, there is a small yet surpassingly transcendent place—ideal for refining conduct and cultivating the body. The only hindrance is your own lack of resolve.” The immortal elder said: “I humbly seek your instruction.” The old man replied: “I am a Perfected One of the Nine Heavens. Today, I shall transmit to you the essential method.” He reached into his bag and drew forth a scroll, saying: “This is the *Great Achievement of the Golden Elixir and Fire Dragon*—the mechanism for transcending the mortal and entering the sagely. Practice it in secrecy, and you shall attain the Dao. When your way is complete, I shall meet you again in the realm of Great Purity—it will not be too late.” He urged: “Devote yourself to cultivation; do not treat it lightly or grow lax.” Thereupon, the immortal elder prostrated himself in reverent acceptance, filled with awe. In an instant, wind rose and clouds swirled—the old man had already ascended into the mid-heaven. The immortal elder bowed twice more, then departed along the southern mountain path to return home. From that moment, his speech, demeanor, and every movement and stillness differed from before.

Half a year later, he informed his kinsfolk: “I no longer wish to dwell amid the dust of the world. I intend to seek a secluded place to cultivate body and mind. I bid you all a temporary farewell.” They assented. He then built a thatched hut on Lotus Mountain, erected an alchemical furnace, gathered herbs, and practiced cultivation according to the method. To this day, the alchemical furnace and elixir pool remain on Lotus Mountain. After the elixir was completed, he told the assembly: “Though my elixir is formed, my virtuous deeds are not yet sufficient. I dare not consume it lightly. I shall wear it as I act, using it to aid the state, perform meritorious works, and relieve the people’s burdens. Then, when I enter the Three Realms to serve, I shall do so without shame.” From that time, the immortal elder felt his spirit grow ever clearer and his mind more luminous, penetrating the mysteries of the unseen. He could summon the sun when the sun was called, and bring rain when rain was needed. Concealing or revealing himself at will, he observed worldly affairs as if they lay in his palm. Who did not look up to him in admiration?

In the twenty-sixth year of the *kaiyuan* era of Emperor Ming of the Tang, the year *wuyin* of the sexagenary cycle, on the sixteenth day of the eighth month, after the morning court, the emperor addressed his ministers: “Last night, I dreamed a divine being told me that north of Cloud Mountain in Hunan, in the land of Shaoling, there is a Daoist of the Shen clan, styled the White Cloud Recluse, who has attained the Dao through alchemical refinement. If we honor him, he may serve as the state preceptor, performing rituals of renewal for the nation to secure blessings and longevity.” The ministers rejoiced and congratulated the emperor, saying: “This is no different from Emperor Gaozong’s dream of Fu Shuo!” Immediately, the Hanlin Academy drafted an edict, and envoys were dispatched to Shaoling to seek him out and deliver the imperial summons. Upon arrival, the prefectural governor appointed officials to accompany the envoys to the cultivation site at Yu Lake on Lotus Mountain, where they indeed found a Daoist of the Shen clan, known as the White Cloud Recluse. By then, his virtue and Dao had reached great heights. He joyfully accepted the summons, not resisting the imperial command, and accompanied the envoys to the capital at Chang’an.

Upon arrival, he was received in audience at the palace. As he discoursed with the emperor, his understanding was profound, grasping ten from one. The emperor called him “Immortal Elder” and bestowed upon him the title *Grand State Preceptor*, decreeing that he reside at the Yuanzhen Abbey to oversee its affairs. He was gifted a thousand-catty golden bell and a hundred-times-refined treasure sword, to perform rituals and prayers for the state. He was granted free access to the imperial court and placed in charge of the Daoist teachings.

On the night of the Mid-Autumn Festival the following year, the emperor asked the immortal elder: “Can one reach the moon?” The immortal elder replied: “Yes.” Thereupon, together with Master Ye of Serene Heaven and the emperor, they rode the clouds, ascending to the Moon Palace. They saw a plaque inscribed *Mansion of Vast Cold and Pristine Emptiness*. Passing through a great gate, they beheld palaces floating in jade radiance. A chill pervaded the air, dampening their robes and sleeves. The gates were heavily guarded, and they halted at the entrance. After a moment, the immortal elder led them inside, where Emperor Ming beheld a gathering of transcendents and over ten moon maidens in white garments, riding white simurghs, laughing and dancing beneath a great cassia tree. The music was resplendent. Emperor Ming, well-versed in musical theory, listened intently, committing the melodies to memory. In haste, he transcribed the notation, which is the present-day tune:

*Gong liu gong chi / Gong chi si shang / Shang chi shang chi gong / Liu wu liu gong / Liu wu liu chi liu / Gong chi shang chi shang / Si he si shang chi / Shang si shang.*

In an instant, the immortal elder, Master Ye of Serene Heaven, and the emperor rode the clouds as before, following a whirlwind back to the palace, as if waking from a dream. The next evening, Emperor Ming longed to return, but the immortal elder only smiled and refused. The emperor did not press the matter.

In the third year of the *tianbao* era, Lady Yang of the imperial harem also entreated the immortal elder to transmit secret scriptures. The following year, on the second day of the second month, the emperor established a precious fast. A paper mat was laid as a mock seat to test him. The immortal elder sat upright, and the mat did not tilt.

The emperor sighed and said, "How extraordinary! Truly a person of the divine immortals." At that time, the immortal elder left behind a *zhai* offering on the table. The emperor asked, "What of this *zhai*?" The elder replied, "I shall return it to my mother." The emperor said, "The journey is far—when will it arrive?" The elder answered, "It will reach her this very evening." The emperor did not believe him. Thereupon, he entrusted the *zhai* to the prefect of Shaoling Commandery. Upon arrival, the *zhai* was still warm and fragrant. The prefect immediately memorialized the emperor, and upon examining the date and time, it matched precisely the day the *zhai* had been bestowed. Thus, the emperor and his ministers all revered and believed.

Yet the emperor’s affection for Lady Yang was profound. The immortal elder repeatedly entered the inner palace to expound the Dao to him, admonishing, "You must abstain from sensual desires. Beware the calamity of treacherous ministers who deceive their sovereign, usurp great power, and elevate petty men—while the noble are cast aside." However, the emperor neither heeded nor took great care.

One evening, the golden bell of Yuanzhen Abbey in the capital tolled of its own accord. The officials reported this to the emperor, who summoned the immortal elder and said, "The divine beings of Mount Hua have foretold that the realm will not know peace, and disaster is imminent. Though this is fated, we may still perform rites of exorcism." The following year,果然, the southern barbarians stirred poisonous strife in the south. The immortal elder already knew that the rebellion of An Lushan would gradually take root. He then submitted a memorial to the emperor, begging leave to return to his hometown to perform rituals of exorcism for the state. Yet his longing to return was urgent. The emperor granted his request and presented him with a set of ritual robes made by the imperial consort Chen, who oversaw the preparation of tea and broths and had served the immortal elder for a long time without complaint. The elder said to her, "You have labored diligently for so long. I have nothing to repay you but this elixir, called *Crimson Snow Pellet*. Take it, and on the day your life ends, consume it. At that time, inform the emperor. After your breath ceases, let your body be placed in the coffin with the lid half-closed, the tomb entrance unsealed. Raise the grave mound high, so your soul may come and go freely, spared the trials of rebirth. After a hundred years, your body will remain uncorrupted. Should a living person’s shadow fall upon you, you will revive, return to the human realm, and become an earthbound immortal."

Chen received the elixir and thanked the immortal elder, saying, "If, in the future, I am spared the suffering of rebirth, how could I forget its source?" Later, when Chen fell gravely ill, she recounted these instructions to the emperor, who followed them all. Her coffin was interred three *li* beyond the palace walls, and her tomb was named *Orchid Prosperity Abbey*. In the seventh year of the *tianbao* era, on the second day of the second month, the emperor ordered the Chancellery and Secretariat to dispatch two eunuchs, Que Ti and Li Zhonggui, to escort the immortal elder’s boat back to Shaoling. At that time, Lady Yang also presented him with a purple robe adorned with gold and pearls. The emperor personally inscribed a plaque for *Yi Tang Abbey* and bestowed it upon the elder, who returned to the mountain to preside over the incense and prayers, bringing fortune to the state and benefit to the people.

Upon returning to the commandery, the elder paid his respects to the prefect and conveyed the emperor’s intentions. He then returned to his hometown at Willow Pond, the site of the present-day Ancestral Foundation Abbey. To the eunuchs, he said, "The mountain temple is desolate, and I have little to offer you. Here are two elixir pellets. Upon returning to the capital, present them to your kin to alleviate the hardships of worldly toil." The envoys received the elixirs, bowed in gratitude, and took their leave. They met with the prefect to obtain travel documents, then set out from the port of Shao River Pond, boarding a boat to cross Dongting Lake and make their winding way back to the capital.

At the start of their journey, as they passed before the Temple of Great Yu, the two envoys conferred: "The elixir the immortal elder bestowed must possess divine efficacy. Why wait until we return home to consume it?" They took water and swallowed the pellets. After a long while, they felt their bodies grow light and their hearts burn with heat. They removed their robes and bathed in the shallow stream beneath the temple. Naturally, their bodies became as light as feathers, capable of soaring into the sky. They said to their attendants, "Take all our former baggage and return to the capital swiftly. Report these events to our families so all may know." The two envoys then vanished into the mountain forests of that place. Occasionally, people saw them coming and going, though none knew their whereabouts. The locals built a temple to honor them, and today, they are known as the Fisher King Wang of Shao River. Some say that after consuming the elixirs and bathing in the water, the fish in that river could no longer be caught by fishermen, and so they were called the *Great King Fishermen*. They befriended Yu the Great and were later collectively revered as the *Three Divine Officials of the Fisher Kings*. They appeared beneath the Yu Hu Mountains in a place called *Cloudy Mist*, where an abbey was built using the emperor’s bestowed plaque.

Thus, the teachings were propagated, and blessings were invoked for the state’s longevity and prosperity.

The imperial court allocated funds and provisions from the local treasury to supply the sacred meals for the multitude of perfected ones. At that time, the immortal elder built an altar upon the surface of the Jizi Pool in the Shao River, performing rites and submitting memorials to sever the incursions of the southern barbarians. To this day, the patterns of the memorial-submitting mat remain visible upon the pool’s surface, unchanged whether the waters rise or fall. Later, when Emperor Minghuang fled to Shu and the crown prince ascended the throne at Lingwu to revive the Great Tang, this was surely the verification of the rites and exorcisms performed through the submitted memorials.

Thereafter, the immortal elder inscribed talismans upon water, administered medicinal remedies, and healed the sick. He would occasionally present memorials at the imperial court in Chang’an or attend vegetarian feasts in Luoyang, traveling at dawn and returning by dusk, riding the void and steering the floating clouds. By the eastern riverbank of Shaoling City stood a small stone chamber where the immortal would come and go in seclusion, and in an instant, he would reappear in Luoyang. The local customs, aware of these numinous wonders, still call the place *Luoyang Bay*, a name clearly attested. In the fourteenth year of the Tianbao era, the year *yiwei* (755 CE), on the thirteenth day of the eighth month, the Yang and Er clans gathered for a communal assembly beside the Yitang Abbey. The immortal elder, having accepted their invitation, was met en route by a divine person who presented him with three to five peaches. He carried the peaches to show the assembly, and all marveled in astonishment. When offered the fruit, the elder declined, instead cutting and eating them. In an instant, the faint sounds of celestial hymns resonated through the void, and suddenly, auspicious clouds descended from the summit of Yuhu Peak, accompanied by resplendent immortal music, soaring simurghs and cranes, and fluttering banners. Two crimson-robed figures, adorned with pearls and jade and attended by a retinue, descended obscurely to the abbey. The immortal elder then took leave of the assembly and welcomed the celestial plowmen.

Among them stood a long millstone over a *zhang* in height, upon which were inscribed vermilion characters in jade script: *"The Daoist of Shaozhou, Shen Taizhi, having completed the ninefold refinement of the elixir and fulfilled three thousand meritorious deeds, shall now ascend in broad daylight."* Gazing upward, one saw multicolored clouds spreading in all directions, with vermilion regalia filling the space before him. The immortal addressed the Daoist assembly, saying: *"Today, I shed the dust of the mortal world and ascend to the Pure Capital, to endure as long as heaven and earth. Henceforth, should the common folk make entreaties, I shall respond with compassion and grant their prayers. Hereafter, when calamities of fire and tribulation arise, aid one another in secret. Take care to preserve yourselves. The Yitang Abbey shall forever be dedicated to praying for the emperor’s longevity. On the Three Primes, Eight Festivals, Five La Days, and Ten Straight Days, do not neglect the offerings and rites, that the state and its people may receive blessings."*

Having spoken, he ascended into the void. At that time, the immortal visitor was sixty-nine years old. Today, on Yuhu Mountain stands a stone pillar with a flat slab of rock atop it, traditionally known as the *Immortal Elder’s Mounting Platform*. The Daoists of the time drafted a report to the prefecture, and the prefect submitted a memorial to the imperial court. That year, on the thirteenth day of the eighth month, as Emperor Minghuang ascended the throne, he beheld in the distant void an immortal procession riding cranes, their forms arrayed with banners and regalia, flanked by attendants. The emperor and his ministers and officials all gazed in awe. Later that day, the memorial from the prefect of Shaozhou arrived. The chancellors Chen Xilie and Li Linfu presented it to the emperor. Upon reading the memorial, the emperor found that the events described matched precisely what he had witnessed upon the throne—divine immortals manifesting in the heavens. He immediately ordered the prefect of Shaozhou to conduct seasonal sacrifices and rites without negligence.

As the abbey lay over a hundred *li* from the prefectural seat, making it inconvenient for the prefect and magistrates to pay their respects, another memorial was submitted. The emperor then decreed that an *Kaiyuan Abbey* be established near the city, and on the northern bank of the Shao River, an image of the immortal was to be painted and sculpted for veneration, facilitating worship. A subsequent imperial edict exempted the Shen clan and their relatives within the five degrees of mourning from taxes and corvée. On the day of the immortal elder’s ascension, the gentry and commoners of Qiyang County in Yongzhou saw an immortal riding a white crane through the sky, who descended and left behind a robe at the abbey. They enshrined it and renamed the abbey *White Crane Abbey*, later memorializing the event to the throne.

Upon review, it was found that no other immortals had performed such divine deeds—only Shen Taizhi of Shaozhou had mounted a crane and ascended to heaven in broad daylight. During every ritual assembly at the abbey, the assembled Daoists would reverently carry the robe to the altar and perform the Daoist rites, a tradition preserved through the ages. The immortal elder’s elixir is not to be coveted by those without an immortal’s destiny. As for the mist-veiled mountains and winding paths, they remain the immortal elder’s former retreat, where grottoes and deep caverns, sheer cliffs and towering crags, render entry impossible. Yet the immortal’s traces endure upon the summit’s loftiest peak, accessible only by climbing the verdant slopes. Amidst the mountains, sacred cedars flourish in lush abundance, their years many. The numinous rocks and sacred springs respond unfailingly to prayers.

Now at the mountain gate, the incense and offerings of officials, commoners, scholars, and the masses rise in ceaseless devotion. They pray for the protection of seedlings from blight and for relief from drought, that the land may be nourished and the people prosper—each plea met with swift and unfailing response. White clouds ever veil the cliffs, while boundless fortune steadfastly upholds the nation’s destiny. All under heaven rejoice, and even distant lands erupt in celebration. Thus, this account is recorded to spread its renown, though its benefit be but small.

**Verified Facts of Manifestation**

During the Yuanhe era of Emperor Xianzong of the Tang, Xue Zhao served as a constable in the imperial city. While adjudicating a civil dispute, he perverted the law for bribes and was impeached. The Tang legal code was strict, and even a constable’s transgression warranted flogging. Fearing disgrace, Zhao fled beyond the imperial precincts. As dusk fell, he lost his way, wandering in distress, when suddenly an old man appeared. Zhao bowed deeply, pleading with all earnestness for guidance. The elder asked, “What is your name, and why are you here?”

Zhao replied, “I am Xue Zhao. Having served corruptly in office, I was impeached and, dreading punishment, fled in haste—only to lose my way.”

Zhao then inquired after the elder’s name. “I am the Old Man of Mount Tian,” he answered, “long dwelling in these mountains and versed in the fortunes of men. Since you seek direction, I shall tell you truly how to escape your peril. Not far from here lies a grove of dense woods and towering bamboo. Stay there for now. Should you come upon the Lanchang Palace, conceal yourself within—thus may you evade disaster.”

Zhao bowed in gratitude. “If I escape punishment, I shall not forget your kindness and will surely repay this great virtue.”

The elder replied, “One who defiles his office—what virtue is there to repay?” With that, Zhao took his leave and soon beheld a bamboo grove, within which stood a small pavilion named Lanchang Palace. As the sun dipped low, Zhao’s heart swelled with mingled joy and dread, and he took shelter there.

Near the second watch, the moonlight gleamed bright and clear when suddenly a woman of striking beauty approached. Zhao started in alarm, suspecting her a ghost.

“Are you a ghost or a mortal?” he asked. “How have you come here?”

The woman answered, “I am no ghost, but Chen, a palace maid who once prepared tea for Emperor Minghuang. At that time, the Daoist adept Shen from Shaoling in Hunan was summoned to court, where the emperor honored him as an immortal elder. He discoursed on the wondrous Dao within the palace, and I, in my service of tea, attended him with utmost sincerity. The immortal elder said to me, ‘Long have you labored in service. As thanks, I offer you this elixir called Crimson Snow Pellet. Swallow it only at the hour of your death. A hundred years hence, should you encounter a living person, you shall return to the mortal realm and attain the rank of earthbound immortal.’”

The woman then asked, “And who are you? Why have you come here?”

Xiao replied, “I am Xue Zhao, a constable of the palace guard. Fearing execution for bending the law, I fled here in exile. Just now, I met an old man who called himself the Old Man of Mount Tian. He directed me here, saying I might escape disaster.”

Chen clapped her hands and laughed aloud, “The Old Man of Mount Tian is none other than Immortal Adept Shen! He knew I had dwelt here for a hundred years. Today, the promise of old has truly come to pass—how could this be mere chance?” Zhao suddenly recalled that in his days as a scholar, he had read of such things in Tang chronicles; this encounter was no accident. The two sighed for a long while. Then Chen spoke to Zhao of cloud-like passions and rain-like embraces, and Zhao could not help but yield to the trials of desire’s scroll.

Chen said, “Follow me. A short distance from here, a tomb stands wide open. Within, a spacious chamber holds a cinnabar coffin, its lid askew. Inside lies my body.” Chen bade Zhao lift the coffin lid. There he saw a woman with a radiant face, warm to the touch, rising as if from sleep. Her garments were tattered, but her golden hairpins and jade ornaments remained. As dawn broke, Chen instructed Zhao to take the gold and jade to the market, exchanging them for clothing and adornments. Soon after, the two entered Mount Baling and concealed themselves, attaining the rank of earth-traversing immortals.

By day they ascended in flight, their divine essence long nurtured by magic mushrooms; crimson banners guided them, their immortal destiny fulfilled by frost-peach. Strange indeed! A dream stirred Emperor Minghuang, who sought them out with a cinnabar decree. Glorious! Their fame reached the Most High, who summoned them with jade tones. Once they rode phoenix and dragon; now they harness cranes and mount simurghs. Suddenly leaving the mortal realm, they reverently entered the Dark Capital. Grasping the pivot of creation, they command the thunder’s decree. Prayers for rain are instantly answered; the people’s hardships are always relieved. Their traces appear on the Three Mountains, revealing the Dao as no ordinary way. The elixir refined through nine cycles confirms that their names are no ordinary names.

This comes only when three thousand deeds are complete, enabling the roc to soar ninety thousand miles. Zhao shines like the sun and moon, stern as frost and ice. His repose brings boundless peace to the world, his blessings vast upon the people. His kindness is broad and selfless; his virtue profound and unchanging. Still and unmoving, his spirit is unknown yet unrecognized, cultivated yet governable and harmonious. The deeper one probes, the more steadfast it seems; the higher one gazes, the loftier it appears. His numinous hemp is unfathomable—glimpsed ahead, then suddenly behind. The transformations of the Dao are measureless; his merit surpasses that of heaven and earth, his virtue resplendent across past and present.

Vast above, his spirit shines resplendent. In the former Song dynasty, he received threefold imperial titles of praise; under the Great Yuan, sacred grace repeatedly enhanced his glory. The Dao’s mystery endures—how could it be merely as high as mountains or as distant as rivers? The immortal breeze forever fans, truly as enduring as heaven and earth.

Carefully observing the details of these events, the great cannot be fully recorded, the small cannot be broken down. Examining the transcendent’s wonders, the dead can be revived, the mortal can become immortal. Alas, words fail to fully extol the ineffable!

Emperor Gaozong of the Song dynasty bestowed an imperial title, proclaiming: *"Exhortation to the Cloud Mound Mountain’s Temple of Benevolence and Kindness in Hengyang County, Hengzhou—Great Immortal of White Clouds."*

In former times, the people of Chu worshipped the Lord of the Clouds, enshrining him in the Longevity Palace, where his dragon-drawn chariot and imperial robes were celebrated in song. Now, upon the mound of Hengyang, there is one who summons auspicious clouds to bring timely rains and dispel drought and pestilence, as recorded in the sacred canons. Recognized among the ranks of immortals, the people revere him and offer devout worship at his temple.

Alas! Could this not be the very radiant spirit of antiquity, soaring afar on the wind? To commend his extraordinary merit, we confer upon him a title of profound virtue, that his benevolent responses may grow ever more manifest, bestowing blessings upon the people.

Let him be specially enfeoffed as *"Perfected One of Wondrous Stillness."*

The decree is to be reverently obeyed upon receipt. Executed on the twenty-sixth day of the first month, in the twenty-seventh year of the Shaoxing reign.

*Transmission of the Immortal Elder of Cloud Mound Mountain concludes.*
