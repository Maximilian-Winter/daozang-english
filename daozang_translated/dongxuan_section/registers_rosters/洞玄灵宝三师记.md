**Record of the Three Masters of the Cavern Mystery and Numinous Treasure, with Preface**
Composed by Master Guangcheng, Liu Chujing

The essence of the Dao is utmost quiescence and non-action.
Its function is to permeate life and respond to stimuli.
It begins before the beginning, precedes what has no precedence.
It arises from wondrous non-being and gives birth to wondrous being.
The teaching of the Perfect Truth was established therefrom.

Our Primordial Celestial Worthy of Original Commencement initiated the Double Mystery, traversed the Five Primes, grasped the primordial transformation, wielded the true essence, and synthesized the wondrous gate into a dharma-seal, which he bestowed upon the Great Lord of the Dao.
The Lord of the Dao refined and expanded it, unfolding and proclaiming it.
In all, twelve seals encompassed the hidden traces, exhausting and penetrating the mysterious and wondrous, which he then transmitted to Lord Lao.
Lord Lao received and practiced it, reaching upward to the Three Clarities, extending laterally without bound, spanning countless eons, enlightening the unenlightened. Each emperor became a master, and in every region, teachings were established. From the obscure to the manifest, from the vast to the minute, none did not revere it.

Thus, from generation to generation, masters transmitted the teachings, passing down the precepts from the Primordial Commencement to the present age.
Those who receive the Dao and honor its precepts—are they not the Masters of Transmission?
The master of the Master of Transmission is the Master of Registers.
"Registers" means succession. To inherit the true vehicle is to depart from the mundane and contract the Dao.
The master of the Master of Registers is the Master of Scriptures.
"Scriptures" means "by way of." By the master’s awakening, one abandons the mundane and ascends as an immortal.
The weight of the Three Masters is comparable to that of ancestors and progenitors.
Ancestors and progenitors can transmit the teachings but cannot enable the multitudes to attain the Dao. Parents can give life but cannot enable the multitudes to ascend as immortals.
The way of honoring the master is without peer.
The Confucian principle of "all things in threes" cannot compare to it.

Reverently considering the Three Lords, their luminous virtue shines forth. In tracing and honoring their teachings, admiration knows no bounds.
Yet, since their ascent to the heavens, their records have not been systematically compiled. Though their steadfast principles and flourishing models are inscribed upon sacred mountains, later disciples and followers find it difficult to delve into their profound mysteries.
Thus, I dare to arrange these factual records to illuminate future generations.
I humbly present this brief preface and compose a eulogy.

The disciple of the Dao, Lu Shenyi of Haoxing, and the Perfected of the Dao-Origin, Xiu Lie, merely appended short praises to commemorate their virtuous influence.
May the kalpas come to an end, yet their pure regulations never fade.

Composed on the Zhongyuan Festival of the Gengchen year of the Tang, the Jiachen day.

**The Three Masters**

**Master of Scriptures:** Lord Tian of the Great Cavern of Supreme Clarity on Mount Nanyue, whose personal name was Xu Ying, style Liangyi, a native of the Qi state.
During the Kaihuang era of the Sui, he served his parents and resided in You County to the west. Though the land spanned several *li* and connected with human relations, it was not a place for resting or advancing in the Dao. Even though the forests and foothills were serene and secluded, he abandoned it and departed, relocating to the midst of the mountain.

Lord Tian was endowed with pure spiritual essence, having nurtured celestial harmony from birth. He inherited the numinous source of the Maoshui and carried forward the filial virtue of the Great Shun. Thereafter, he settled at the southeastern layered cliffs beneath Zigai Peak, where he tilled the soil and cultivated crops to provide for his parents for over fifty years, never faltering in his morning and evening duties. Though he longed to part the brambles in search of the Dao and conceal his radiance to seek truth, his reverent devotion and filial piety left no room for self-indulgence until his parents’ passing.

After their transformation, he wandered the Five Peaks, letting his aspirations roam freely. In the Longsuo era of the Tang, he encountered the reclusive immortal He Jun, from whom he received the Dao in silent transmission. From then on, wherever vines, creepers, springs, or rocks drew him, he would stay, and thus his mountain abode had no fixed place. The prefectural governor, Lord Tian Xia, revered his virtue and Dao, and at the eastern hall of the Yueguan Temple, constructed the Jiangzhen Hall. Tian Qiancheng and the scholar-officials Zhuge and Huang inscribed praises on its walls to honor his profound virtue. The Master often rested there, propagating the Dao and transmitting its teachings.

The Shangqing Great Cavern scriptures he transmitted had been passed down from Master Zhenyi to Celestial Master Xue Jun, and from Xue Jun to the Master. The Master delved deeply into its mysteries, attaining the profoundest realms of the Dao. He traversed the rivers and clouds for over two hundred years. Though seasons changed and time shifted, his lifespan knew no bounds, and to this day, brush-wielding travelers and wanderers often claim to have seen him. This confirms that within jade palaces and grotto-heavens, he must have his abodes, and among the ranks of immortals and the stages of perfected beings, he must have his place. Yet the barrier of the mundane world obscures the details, which cannot be fully known.

The Master had four accomplished disciples: Feng Jun Weiliang of Bingyao, Chen Jun Guayan of Xianglin, Xu Jun Lingfu of Fangying, and during the Yuanhe era, they entered Tiantai Mountain, spreading teachings as circumstances allowed. Emperor Xianzong summoned them, but they did not respond. Master Liu of Guangcheng remained at the foot of the mountain; Emperor Wuzong summoned him to serve as Celestial Master and enter the capital to transmit the Dao. Today, the Three Caverns teachings of Jiangzhe trace their lineage to Master Tian as their founding patriarch.

**Eulogy:**
The august and boundless Dao,
The uncarved simplicity without name.

Subtle and profound, neither pure nor turbid.
Radiant our ancestor, transcendent in prior enlightenment.
Silently he attained it—learning without learning.
Mama River inaugurated his line; Qi State bore its splendor.
Delighting in the Dao with a bamboo bowl of food,
he unrolled the classics beneath crimson gauze.
Though chaff might cling to his ceremonial sash,
his guests and kin were clouds of rosy mist.
He tilled the soil to provide for his parents,
fulfilling filial piety at home.
Deep in the crags’ embrace, he pursued the Perfected amid forest peaks,
where Peng Xian led the way and Pine and Jo lived on.
While the world’s sundials turned in vain,
his own being grew ever more still.
He revered the chariot of recitation, soaring through the Eight Sceneries.

Recorded in the register: Master Feng of the Great Cavern of Supreme Clarity at Tongwu Abbey on Mount Tiantai, the thrice-summoned Perfected Gentleman, styled Weiliang, a native of Changle. He cultivated the Dao at the Central Palace of Mount Heng, where he befriended Xu of Fangying and Chen of Xianglin as kin of the mist-bound vines. Each built a quiet chamber beside the Central Palace, two or three *li* apart. Later, at the Hall of Descending Perfection, he approached Master Tian, receiving the true instructions. The three caverns’ hidden mysteries were all imparted to him.

During the Yuanhe era, he entered Mount Tiantai to propagate the Great Teaching. The Inspector of Kuaiji, Yuan Ji of Henan, heard of his reputation and rejoiced, sending earnest letters with reverence as if gazing at clouds, and paying him the respect due a disciple. At that time, Tongwu Abbey, since its restoration by Master Zhenyi, had endured through the years, its splendid halls and tiered towers overgrown with brambles and shrouded in green. The three gentlemen, recalling the merit of the former commander, undertook its reconstruction anew, building the Upper Clarity Pavilion, the Hall of Descending Perfection, the White Cloud Pavilion, and the Leisurely Retreat, thus reviving the legacy of Master Zhenyi. As Master Zhenyi Tian’s transmission of the Three Caverns’ Dao spread through Jiangnan, Emperors Xianzong and Jingzong repeatedly issued summons, dispatching carriages of rushes and missives of cranes, yet he remained unyielding. Instead, he established his dwelling in Hualing Valley, where he concealed himself in reclusion. There, he trod the paths in search of seclusion, exploring every marvel, from the numinous ruins of Lingxu to the Flower Peak, from the jade chambers of Stone Bridge to the Peach Blossom Springs of Tianmu, the golden courts of Jinting, and the yellow-clouded wilds. Alone he wandered, returning but once in months. From then on, he vanished into deep seclusion, his whereabouts unknown.

His disciples—Ying Yijie of the Three Caverns, Ye Cangzhi of Jade霄 (styled Hanxiang), Liu Chujing of Xiandu, and Shen Guanwu of Jinting—each a luminous branch of the immortal lineage, succeeded him in flourishing the Dao across the land.

In praise it is said:
At the inception, the Supreme Polarity,
Gave rise to the Two Modes.
Once the chaos was pierced,
Floating strife surged forth.
Tracing the source, returning to simplicity,
The Dao stood as foundation.
The Heavenly Lad’s precious register,
Passed from master to disciple.
Elixir of jade, golden nectar,
Refining the primordial embryo, tempering the soul.
Ascending the altar to report to the Emperor,
Discarding the mundane to tread the mysterious path.
Beneath the purple canopy, riding the clouds,
Jinting became his abode.
Clearing the brambles and overgrowth,
Tongqiao was revived.
Amid ten thousand valleys’ hush,
Three found their kindred.
West of the Milky Way,
Our Way thus flourished.
The sagely sovereigns admired his virtue,
The commanders revered his teachings.
His heart, like clouds, clung to nothing,
The crane’s summons could not compel him.
With steps like stars, driving the wind,
He soared aloft.

The Master of Transmission, the Venerable Master of the Great Cavern of Supreme Clarity at Daoyuan Abbey on Mount Tiantai, the Purple-robed Responding Lord, whose personal name was Yijie and courtesy name Shizhong, traced his ancestry to Runan. His forebears settled in Mount Jinhua of the Po Valley during the Eastern Jin, and thus he became a native of Dongyang Prefecture. He was the great-grandson of the Recluse Master Shu Ning, a lofty scholar of the Kaiyuan era, who had mastered the classics through generations and cultivated his conduct, yet sought no official advancement.

The Master’s Dao shone with primordial harmony, his qi stored in profound emptiness. He nurtured a nature of pure numinosity and tempered his talents in the Purple Court. His essence was utterly refined, unstained by worldly dust, and he harmonized with the spirit of the valley without flaw. His mother, Lady He, dreamed of a shooting star entering her window; awakening in alarm, she beheld a divine radiance lingering there, and soon conceived. In the fifth year of the Yuanhe reign, the gengyin year, he was born—already distinct from the common, refusing meat and impure foods even as an infant.

At seven, he left his parents to pursue the Dao, entering Lingrui Abbey in Lanxi County of his home prefecture to study under Master Wu Xuansu. There he received the *Nanhua Chongxu Tongling Zhenjing* (*True Scripture of the Penetrating Spirit of the Southern Florescence and Primal Vacuity*), the *Book of Changes*, the *Classic of Filial Piety*, and the *Analects*. He chanted and recited with diligent devotion, mastering all five classics at once. At thirteen, he donned the hempen robe, the triple garment, and the Five Precepts, reverently upholding his practice. Masters and peers alike gazed upon him with awe.

At fifteen, he entered Mount Tiantai to study the Orthodox Unity teachings. At seventeen, he was invested with the Purple Void of the High Mystery. At eighteen, he journeyed to Mount Longhu to receive the Three Ranks of the Great Capital Merit from Shaoren, the eighteenth-generation descendant of the Celestial Master. At twenty-four, he delved into the True Writs of Numinous Treasure, the Cavern Spirit, and the Cavern Mystery. At twenty-nine, he ascended to the Mystery of Ascent. At thirty-two, he received the Great Cavern of Supreme Clarity, the Way of the Returning Chariot, the Purple Writs and Plain Sashes, and the talismans for treading earth and soaring heaven. He explored the histories and philosophers, distilled the profound commentaries, concealed his brilliance, and assiduously cultivated the wondrous path.

The transmission of the Great Law of Supreme Clarity had passed from the Perfected Lord Tao of Juqu to the Perfected Lord Wang of Ascent, from Wang to the Perfected Lord Pan of Embodied Mystery, from Pan to the Perfected Lord Sima of Integrity, from Sima to the Celestial Master Xue Jichang of Nanyue, from Xue to Master Tian Liangyi of Mount Heng, from Tian to the Recluse Master Feng Weiliang of Qiyao on Mount Tiantai, and from Feng to the Master. Through successive generations, the numinous descended, virtue linked like cicadas in a chain, the essence of the azure grove was entrusted, and the immortal ranks were ascended step by step.

Fellow disciples included Ye Hanxiang of the Jade Empyrean and Liu Chujing of Mount Xiandu. In the third year of the Huichang reign, the Master dwelled on the verdant screen of rock southwest of Tongwu Abbey, where he established a purification altar and immersed himself in the secret mysteries. Clearing brambles and fording streams, he sought a fitting abode. Li Baoyuan, the Military Commissioner of Yuezhou, admired his steadfast integrity and, following the wind of his reputation, petitioned for the establishment of an abbey, urging that it be named Daoyuan. Thereafter, the Master withdrew into the forest’s edge for over fifty years, upholding the great teaching without respite. People of Wu and Yue gazed upon his incense and bowed in reverence; those who wished to serve as his attendants either cast off their worldly sandals or brought renown to their states—his virtues cannot be fully recounted.

From youth to maturity, the Master remained unsullied by worldly dust. He cast off the dregs of the mundane, sharply distinct from the common and indolent. His demeanor was warm and serene, his true qi undispersed. His virtue was solemn and profound, his words luminous and pure. Whenever he entered stillness to perform rites, ascended the altar to inspect the registers, or brought blessings to the times, he delivered beings and guided souls. His offerings of honey and wax communicated with the numinous, yielding auspicious omens. He chanted the hidden verses of the *Yellow Court* and intoned the jade stanzas of the *Great Cavern*. At the Eight Daoist Festivals, he gazed toward the clouds; at the Three Primordial Assemblies, he received his duties. He wandered the wind and concealed himself in the earth, grasped hands and hid in the heavens. Diligent in his refinement, he continued day and night without cease. Thus did the numinous descend to bestow liberation, and the mysterious transmit the true lineage.

When his empty chamber awaited the concealed arrival of the imperial carriage, and his gaze longed for the secret halting of the wind-driven chariot, the Master attained it. Nobles and marquises heard of him and turned their eyes toward the screens of the realm; they reverently welcomed him with soaring memorials. The imperial court, upon learning of his virtue, bestowed a noble title and honored him with a rescript of purple-clad favor. Though the world’s acclaim swelled, his original intent remained unshaken.

The Master often said to his disciples: “I have devoted myself to propagating and protecting the fundamental teaching, and thus cannot retreat from the world to silence my voice. The Dao does not shun humanity; through diligent seeking, it may be attained. The Jade Capital and Golden Portals, the Yellow Springs and Deng Metropolis—how far apart are they? Only the heart’s intent determines the outcome. Let those who come after strive to uphold this.”

On the assembly day of the seventh month in the jia-yin year of the Qianning reign, after completing his audience at court, he bathed, entered stillness, and composed his spirit as if awaiting something. At the hour of chou on the eighth day, he peacefully shed his mortal form at the age of eighty-five. His limbs remained supple, his countenance unchanged—what the *True Scripture* calls the “upper liberation.” That evening, the abbey filled with pure fragrance, and purple qi floated in the sky. Birds and beasts cried out for a full day, and the mountains and rivers lost their color.

Seven days later, his spirit was conveyed to a stone chamber in the northeast corner of the abbey, where his remains were refined—a practice in accordance with the ritual codes. On the fourth day of that month, two divine beings in feathered robes, holding tablets, entered from outside, their bearing extraordinary. When the abbey’s disciples hastened to greet them, they heard only the sound of chanted praises before the figures vanished. This was a mysterious announcement from the numinous officials.

Five years earlier, in the first month of winter, the Daoist Zhang Jingxuan of the Tiantai Abbey had chanced to gaze upon the peaks and seen clouds of red and purple swirling strangely. Within them appeared three jeweled boats: one bore Ye Hanxiang of the Jade Empyrean, another bore Liu Xiuran of Fangying, and the third carried the Master. The first two boats soared away, while the Master’s followed behind. Indeed, Liu and Ye had already ascended and transformed, while the Master later departed. This further confirmed the signs of his attainment and the imperial manifestation of his cultivation.

Zhang Ying composed the abbey’s record, and Luo Yin of Hengyang wrote the *Eulogy of the Perfected*, their magnificent brushstrokes and resplendent phrases inscribing stone with enduring elegance—both were towering talents of the age, their legacy imperishable. Yet at the threshold of his immortal transformation, his radiance shone ever brighter.

The brush of a worthy scholar, though humble and slight, dares to record these grand principles. May luminous talents of later times bestow further refinement. The disciple of later learning, Lu Shenyi of Wu Commandery, bows in reverence to the rosy clouds and sets down the events in plain words—composed by Master Guangcheng of the disciples’ gate.

**Eulogy:**
The Dao is profound, the Mystery doubly abstruse;
Its traces divide into the Three Caverns.
Jade script and golden writ,
The Purple Phoenix embodies their mystery.
The Three Radiances are this treasure,
The bound blossoms they chant.
Their principle illumines the darkened crossroads,
To awaken the great dream.
Our Master’s august virtue
Shook off the dust and clamor.
Like Shang’s hymns scorning Han,
Or Ying’s melodies confounding Yao,
The Eight Dao were purified,
The Three Primes silently attended.
His cultivation reached its apex,
His merit sought to mount the phoenix.
The cinnabar towers of Huotai,
The immortal halls of Red City.
Expounding the Dharma, transmitting the teachings,
His numinous rule and wondrous measure.
*Record of the Three Masters of the Cavernous Mystery and Numinous Treasure* concludes.
