**The Transmission of the Filial Dao Perfected Lords Wu and Xu**

The Perfected Lord Xu was named Xun, styled Jingzhi. A transcendent of the Jin dynasty, he mastered the arcane and wondrous arts of immortals, fathomed the subtleties of filial piety, and communed with spirits. He came and went without restraint, manifesting marvels, and none among the worthy and enlightened of his age could fathom his origins.

His ancestry hailed from Gaoyang. When the Jin crossed the Yangtze during the Sui-Jin transition, heroes had yet to be distinguished. The sagely emperor revered him; Wang Dun took him as his teacher; Guo Pu esteemed him. The entire court, from ministers to nobles, vied to honor him with humble words and sincere affection.

He divined an auspicious site in Yuzhang and settled there, his name resounding through the halls of power. At that time, he befriended twelve Perfected Lords, among whom he served Wu as his master. Lord Wu was named Meng, styled Shiyun. They built their abodes in proximity, encouraging one another to cultivate the wondrous methods of ascension and deliver the people from calamity.

In Jianchang County, along the upper reaches of the Liao River, there dwelt a great serpent, its body stretching several *li*, blocking the waterway for over forty *li*. Its venom split mountains and stones, its breath stirred winds and clouds, terrifying the people and devouring travelers. Those conveying taxes and tributes wearied on the roads; merchants and boats were obstructed, unable to pass. The local officials were at a loss. Thus, they established a granary forty *li* northwest of the serpent’s lair, naming it Red Granary, to receive taxes and tributes. Goods were transported overland, crossing mountains and ridges, exhausting human effort.

At that time, Lords Wu and Xu clasped hands and said to one another: "We have accumulated virtue and merit in hopes of benefiting the people. If we cannot rid them of harm, how can our virtue and power be made manifest?" Thereupon, Lord Wu led three hundred disciples to slay the serpent, but fearing their resolve might waver and hinder the great task, he doubted their sincerity. At the Pavilion for Transforming the People, he gathered firewood, kindled flames, and took embers to transform humans. In an instant, he turned the three hundred into beautiful women, mingling among the crowd. The next morning, he summoned them to test their purity: two hundred and ninety-nine were stained with charcoal, save for Lord Xu alone. Penetrating the mysteries of the Dao, his mind was serene, his thoughts still, embracing the Six Directions. Above, he corresponded with the Nine Perfected, reflecting the bright moon in water—how could he be tainted by mere soot?

Lord Wu gazed up in awe and exclaimed: "None but you can rid the people of this scourge!" Thus, he invited Lord Xu to accompany him. Ten *li* from the serpent, Lord Wu strode forward alone. The serpent unleashed its venomous breath, exhaling mists that dazzled the eyes and eclipsed the sun. Its head towered to the heavens, striking terror into all who saw it. None but those of divine transcendence and steadfast Dao could muster the strength to exterminate it.

At that moment, Lord Wu hesitated, but Lord Xu, whose name was recorded in the immortal registers and whose Dao aligned with the Primordial Mystery, bore the thirty-six thousand divine talismans and wielded the wondrous methods of the Limitless Perfected. His power was sovereign, his responses timely—how could such a venomous creature dare to rampage? Drawing his sword, he roared and slew it. From the serpent’s belly burst forth countless venomous creatures, scattering in flight. The earth split, and the river surged, hence the path was named Serpent’s Trail, and the place, Serpent Bone Isle. To this day, the serpent’s bones lie piled like hills, its blood flowing like a river, its traces still visible.

At that time, the Prefect of Changsha, Magistrate Jia, was dispatched from the imperial court to govern the region. His administration was exceptional, his governance benevolent, and his inquiries into local customs earnest. He had but one daughter, of refined beauty and gentle disposition, for whom he had long sought a worthy match without satisfaction. Her parents pitied her, fearing their family’s prestige would wane.

Suddenly, a scholar arrived from afar, drawn by her reputation. His appearance was unmatched, his eloquence peerless. He cautiously revealed his surname, Shèn, and spoke of his family’s illustrious heritage and his own vast spirit, making him a paragon among men. The magistrate’s household rejoiced, honoring and welcoming him as their son-in-law. After the wedding, years passed.

Thereafter, the scholar would often depart for ten days or a month before returning, empty-handed on his way out but laden with gold, silver, and silks upon his return. The magistrate, unaware of the circumstances, found the entire household both reverent and apprehensive. His home overflowed with treasures and wealth beyond measure—what greater fortune could there be than such a son-in-law? The household composed a song:

*"Heaven-born Shèn, scion of a noble house,*
*Bestows upon us pearls and jade—*
*Who could rival such a son-in-law?"*

Later, learning that Lord Xu had rid the land of harm for the sake of the people, slaying beasts and serpents, the scholar feared retribution. He sought an audience with Lord Xu at the official residence, but Lord Xu, seeing through his illusions, dismissed the gathering of worthies at the post pavilion. When the scholar returned home to rest, he drank excessively, and his dragon aura flickered externally. Lord Xu discerned the truth and exposed his transformations.

Lord Xu pursued him to Dragon Sands, where the scholar transformed into an ox to conceal himself. Lord Xu, recognizing him, said to his disciple Shi Daoqi: "This flood dragon has harmed countless people, shifting forms without end. Today, you and I shall eradicate this scourge. I am but forty years old, while this dragon has lived for a thousand years. Though I, too, shall become an ox, fear not—you may not recognize me. I shall tie a handkerchief on my left shoulder as a white-humped ox to confront it. You must assist by striking with your sword."

As he spoke, the dragon-ox appeared before them. Lord Xu transformed and engaged it. In the midst of their struggle, Shi struck with his sword, wounding one of the dragon’s legs. Exhausted, the dragon fled, entering the earth through a spring and returning to Magistrate Jia’s residence in Changsha. The spring was later named Crosswise Spring Well, and its traces remain visible to this day.

The dragon reverted to human form and told his wife and children, reporting to Magistrate Jia: "Yesterday in Yuzhang, I encountered bandits who robbed and wounded me in the leg. The pain is unbearable—I nearly lost my life."

When Magistrate Jia heard this, he was seized by unrelenting terror and immediately dispatched messengers to seek physicians, their figures stretching endlessly along the roads. Lord Xu, tracing the dragon’s tracks, soon arrived in Changsha. In the marketplace, he learned of the situation and said to the envoys sent to find a doctor, “I am skilled in medicine.” The messengers invited him to the magistrate’s residence, where Magistrate Jia personally welcomed Lord Xu. After Lord Xu recounted the details, the magistrate realized his son-in-law had been bewitched by a thousand-year-old jiao. Lord Xu then requested permission to eliminate the menace, but the magistrate, doubting his words, hesitated: “My son-in-law, the Shen family, holds kinship with the entire court, and his acquaintances are many. I fear your actions may be mistaken—human life is too precious to risk.”

Lord Xu replied, “If you do not believe me, go and report this yourself: a physician named Xu has arrived from Yuzhang. If Master Shen shows no alarm, then you will know the truth.” The magistrate followed his advice. When Master Shen heard the news, he was struck with terror and urged the magistrate to bar Lord Xu from entering. Yet Lord Xu had already reached the hall. He raised his voice in a fierce shout, and the dragon tore through the wall and fled. The entire household was gripped by fear. The magistrate then entreated Lord Xu again, who declared, “Beneath your residence, five feet down, the jiao has hollowed out a deep pool.” They immediately ordered laborers to dig five feet down, revealing a bottomless expanse of water.

The dragon had already sired two offspring. Lord Xu commanded that they be summoned and, with a spray of water, transformed them into dragons the size of small boats. He further revealed that the dragon’s wife was half-human, half-dragon. When sprayed with water, she too reverted to her true form. Initially intending to kill her, the magistrate pleaded for his daughter’s life, and Lord Xu restored her to her human appearance. The dragon’s children and the great dragon itself were swiftly slain. The magistrate, overwhelmed by shock and sorrow, lamented for a long while. Lord Xu merely advised him to relocate his household. In an instant, the old residence sank beneath the earth, the water plunging a hundred fathoms deep. Thus, the place was named Potam State.

The dragon’s blood seeped into the earth and surged forth as an iron pillar, which still stands today in the Southern Pond of Hongzhou, two hundred and forty paces from the city. An inscription on it reads:
*If the iron pillar leans, the dragon shall rise again, and I shall reemerge.*
*If the iron pillar stands straight, the dragon shall be forever vanquished.*

Truly, the immortals perceive all things, no matter how hidden, and their myriad transformations unfold before their eyes. Their purpose is to rid the people of calamity—how could illusions and deceptions endure for long? Just as towering ice melts beneath the sun, so too do ancient demons vanish in the presence of the utmost sage.

Moreover, through refining one’s conduct and mastering the profound, one may ascend with their household, their fame resounding through the ages. Passing down teachings to later generations, if one upholds the Dao, preserves authenticity, purifies the mind, and nurtures fleeting life, then the jade terrace of the Nine Perfected is but a single step away.

The roots of filial piety trace back to a man of virtue from Gaoping Township in Gangfu County, Yanzhou. His surname was Lan, though he concealed his given name and style, and was simply known as Master Lan. Living in harmony with a hundred fellow villagers, their hearts united in virtue and their conduct marked by filial devotion, their sincerity moved the heavens. A Perfected One from the Dipper, known as the Filial and Fraternal King—elder brother to the Luminous King and younger brother to the Primordial King—descended to instruct Master Lan in the foundations of filial piety. The *Classic of Filial Piety* states: “Of old, the Luminous King governed the world through filial piety.” This was indeed the case.

Master Lan’s devotion resonated with the divine, and the Filial and Fraternal King revealed to him that the Primordial King ruled as the King of the Sun, while the Luminous King ruled as the King of the Moon. He further explained: “The Primordial King’s profound blackness embodies the Great Dao; the Luminous King’s nascent blackness embodies the Utmost Dao; and the Filial and Fraternal King’s dispersed blackness embodies the Dao of Filial Piety. These three arise from the primordial and original blackness.”

The Filial and Fraternal King bestowed upon Master Lan bronze talismans and iron charters, which bore the names Xu and Yang as those to be summoned. During the Jin dynasty, Yang was appointed magistrate of Shiyang County, under the jurisdiction of Shu Commandery, to serve as a teacher of filial piety, passing down its traditions and guiding later generations. By dispelling evil, rectifying the heart, and refining one’s conduct, the path to immortality is not far removed.

The Filial and Fraternal King once traveled with Master Lan through Shu Commandery. By the roadside, they came upon three tombs beside a well. The king said to Master Lan, “These are the tombs of immortals. Instruct the authorities to proclaim that immortals lie within. To honor filial piety, they must post notices and reroute the road to avoid obstructing the immortals’ passage.” With these words, he vanished without a trace.

Master Lan relayed the message to the authorities, who seized him, accusing him of spreading heresy and deception. He steadfastly insisted, “Magistrate Jia himself can attest: if I am promoting filial piety, then let my words be true. If they are false, my entire clan shall be executed.” They imprisoned Master Lan, who pondered the Filial and Fraternal King’s words. If even a single matter of filial transformation were amiss, how could he bear the weight of his error in the unseen realm? His sorrow knew no bounds.

That night, he dreamed of a figure who told him, “Do not worry. Calm your mind and ease your thoughts.” The next day, the prefect of Shu Commandery led Master Lan to open the tombs. Master Lan declared, “The first tomb holds the bones of a perfected immortal who has already ascended, leaving behind a yellow immortal’s robe.” The second tomb contained a man of twenty, fair and beautiful, as if merely asleep. The third tomb held a skeleton with skin and flesh yet to form—though it too would become an immortal.

Thus assured, Master Lan awoke from his dream filled with joy and spoke confidently. The prefect bound him and proceeded to open the tombs, asking what lay within the first. Master Lan replied, “The bones of a true immortal who has attained transcendence, along with a yellow immortal’s robe.” When they opened it, his words proved true. They then asked about the second tomb. Master Lan answered, “A man of twenty, fair and beautiful, as if asleep.” Upon opening it, they found it just as he had described. The immortal spoke, “Today is my birthday,” and they beheld another yellow robe. When asked about the third tomb, Master Lan replied, “A skeleton with skin and flesh yet to form.”

The sight was indeed as he had described. The prefect then took the yellow robe and attempted to dress Master Lan in it, but it was far too large. Master Lan discerned that it was meant for the immortal within the tomb. As the immortal donned the robe, he ascended lightly into the empty sky, soaring aloft. The prefect, seized with terror, prostrated himself and begged forgiveness. Master Lan then urged him to establish filial piety.

The immortal would depart for ten days before returning once, and when the prefect saw him, he would unconsciously bow in reverence to welcome him. Later, the immortal might return once every ten or twenty days, and the prefect’s respect and closeness to him could not be restrained. His aspiration for the Dao and communion with the numinous were beyond the measure of ordinary men. That the practice of goodness brings fortune has been transmitted through all ages, and from this, one knows that among the ten thousand things, only humans are noble. The Way of the filial child is inherently to discard the short and follow the long. Observing the enlightened kings of old who governed the world through filial piety, how could later gentlemen not govern themselves through virtue and the Dao?

Master Lan received the decree of the Filial and Fraternal King and ordered that bronze talismans and iron charters be delivered to Huangtang Abbey, which was the residence of Lady Chen. Lady Chen, a chaste mother of the Wu region, did not reveal her surname or given name, for she devoted herself to virtue and the Dao. In the Wu market, she once saw a boy of four or five who bowed to her and begged to be her adopted son. Lady Chen said to him, “When you turn fifteen, you must serve your birth mother. How can you abandon your roots to become my son? If I were to accept you, it would greatly violate the rites and laws.” The boy knelt, apologized, and left. Months later, he transformed his original body into that of a three-year-old child, returning to Lady Chen’s side in tears, with no one to recognize or claim him. Seeing the infant exposed and alone, Lady Chen’s heart filled with compassion. She carried him home, cherishing and raising him no differently than if he were her own flesh and blood—indeed, even more tenderly than a mother and child. As he gradually grew, his wisdom naturally connected with the divine, and his numinous efficacy was felt wherever he walked, dispelling disasters and averting misfortunes.

When he came of age, he served Lady Chen with delicacies, never failing in his morning and evening duties. Moved by his devotion, Lady Chen sought a wife for him. The boy bowed and stepped into the courtyard, addressing Lady Chen: “I am the elder brother of the Second Enlightened King, the younger brother of the Former King. I am the Filial and Fraternal King, entrusted to you, Mother, for nurturing. Through the passing years, I have delayed promoting filial piety until now. Heaven is my father, Earth is my mother, the sun is my elder brother, and the moon is my younger brother. Above heaven and below earth, I alone am revered. A five-colored auspicious cloud envelops my body—what need have I for a wife?” He then bowed to his adoptive mother and requested that her residence be opened as the Gate of Filial Piety. Lady Chen, out of compassion, did not oppose his wish, and thus established her dwelling as Huangtang Abbey. The boy then presented her with bronze talismans and iron charters, bowed in farewell, and departed.

At that time, Lord Wu Meng and Lord Xu Xun heard of this and went to Huangtang Abbey to pay their respects to Lady Chen, seeking the method of filial piety. Lady Chen then bestowed upon them the bronze talismans and iron charters. The charter verified that the Xu family of Yangyi was a single lineage, but Wu Meng’s name was not among them, so he withdrew and bowed to Lord Xu as his teacher. Lord Xu transmitted his wondrous methods to him and conferred them upon the Twelve Perfected Lords—Zhou, Peng, Chen, Shi, Xu, Gan, Zeng, Zhong, Shi, Huang, Wu, Liu, and Shen—all of whom venerated filial piety and constantly spread beneficence among the people.

Heaven has no favorites but aids those with virtue; the people have no fixed loyalties but are drawn to kindness and benevolence. Cultivating the subtle and mysterious within aligns one with the Infinite, and entire households ascend to immortality in broad daylight. Only Lord Xu’s virtue matched that of the Nine Perfected, and his name was recorded in the immortal registers, as determined by the Supreme Emperor. Later scholars who toiled diligently to attain perfection transmitted the methods to these lords, who refined their practice and achieved effortless ascension.

Two hundred and fifty paces east of the abbey’s curtained hall lies the Smoke of Dragon Offering. Beneath the smoke is a deep pool, its waters limpid and bottomless. A dragon has long lain hidden within, its age unknown. The local people dammed the pool’s water to irrigate their fields, hoping for a bountiful autumn harvest. Yet they despaired when the sky remained parched and rainless for too long. The farmers gathered to pray with utmost sincerity, and soon sweet rains descended as dark clouds rose. The people rejoiced, and the region anticipated a rich harvest. Were it not for the numinous efficacy of this land and the excellence of this immortal abode, how could such blessings be bestowed upon the people far and near?

From the second year of the *Yuan Kang* era of the Jin, when the Perfected Lord ascended with his entire household, to the fourteenth year of the *Yuan He* era of the Tang—approximately 562 years—successive generations of local people gathered at the abbey to hold grand *Huanglu* rites. They invited Daoist priests to ascend the altar for three days and nights, presenting memorials to the Supreme Mystery, offering incense, and praying with utmost sincerity. The living and the dead alike received blessings, and the rites concluded only after the charters and dragon offerings were cast into the cavernous pool.

In the first year of the *Xian Ning* era of the Jin, Emperor Wu appointed the Perfected Lord as magistrate of Shiyang in Shu Commandery. Upon assuming office, he inherited a time of disorder, where the priority was upholding public duty. Yet the people’s grievances went unaddressed, documents piled high on his desk, and prisoners overflowed the prisons. Upon his arrival, Lord Xu eliminated all these ills as if a precious mirror revealed all forms or a sharp sword cleaved through rhinoceros and elephant. The wronged were redressed, the oppressed were vindicated, and the entire district sang of his impartial brush. The people’s dire straits were relieved. As for the clerks and officials who had extorted silk, cloth, and money, he knew all their misdeeds in advance. He often admonished them, saying, “If you act with sincerity and follow the lord’s commands, what task cannot be accomplished? You took such-and-such amount of money when handling documents and settling cases, and you did such-and-such in such-and-such a place.” The clerks, hearing this, confessed the truth and dared not deny it. Yet he did not punish them. From then on, he said, “You are the lord’s officials and clerks—you must exert yourselves in serving him. To extort others for profit is not the conduct of a filial child.”

Thus did the clerks and officials exhort one another.

The Perfected Lord, along with Lord Hao and Guo Pu, went to see Wang Dun. Wang Dun said, “I intend to plot great affairs. I ask the three masters to divine for me. Whether the outcome be auspicious or inauspicious, you must not speak recklessly. If you say it is auspicious, that is acceptable, but you must not speak of inauspiciousness.”

The three answered in unison, “Inauspicious.”

Wang Dun asked, “Why?”

The three replied, “To break ranks and defeat generals, to abandon compliance and embrace rebellion, to leave the army bewildered and the people estranged—these are omens of great inauspiciousness.”

Enraged, Wang Dun sought to kill the three, saying, “Last night I dreamed of a tree splitting the sky. You claim this is not a favorable sign—how absurd!”

Lord Hao said, “A tree splitting the sky forms the character *wei* (未, ‘not yet’). You should not act rashly.”

Wang Dun’s expression shifted, and he ordered Guo Pu to divine again. Guo Pu said, “It will not succeed.”

Displeased, Wang Dun asked, “How long is my lifespan?”

Guo Pu replied, “If you proceed with this affair, disaster will come swiftly. If you return to Wuchang, your lifespan may yet be immeasurable.”

Wang Dun asked, “And how long is *your* lifespan?”

Guo Pu answered, “My lifespan ends at midday today.”

Wang Dun ordered his warriors to seize and behead Guo Pu. As Lord Xu raised his cup and cast it upward, it transformed into a white wagtail, circling the beams. When Wang Dun looked up again, the two lords had vanished.

Wang Dun was later utterly defeated.

The waters of the vast sea cannot be measured by a hand’s breadth, nor can the divine immortals be fathomed by petty wisdom. Our Lords Hao and Xu, their divine guards piercing heaven and earth, their transformations penetrating the essence of the numinous—when the Dao is present, they appear; when it is absent, they withdraw. How could their wisdom be trivial, their judgments of fortune and misfortune ever in error?

With these words, they vanished, and none knew their whereabouts.

The next day at noon, Wang Dun sent the Five-Tone Boy to seize Guo Pu by the riverbank, intending to kill him. But the waters surged violently, preventing the execution. When they finally dragged him beneath a soapberry tree, the Five-Tone Boy drew his sword and said, “Long ago, Master Guo gave me a brocade robe to relieve my hunger and cold, yet I have not repaid his kindness. How could I now meet him only to kill him? My life is in chaos, and now this fate befalls me.” He turned his sword toward Wang Dun and declared, “A lawless man who recklessly raises arms and murders the innocent—heaven will surely punish him.”

Wang Dun was later indeed slain by the Five-Tone Boy.

Lord Xu and Lord Hao boarded a boat from Jinling to return to Yuzhang. They said to the boatman, “You must close the cabin and sit calmly. We will steer for you.” As they sailed, they did not once glance at the compass. “If you disobey my words,” they warned, “misfortune will befall you.”

With these words, they caused two dragons to bear the boat aloft. The boatman only heard the vessel moving with extraordinary speed. When it reached the summit of Mount Lu, the scraping of stone against the hull rang sharply. Fearing the boat had run aground and would be damaged by sand and rocks, the boatman stealthily opened the cabin door to look. Seeing two dragons carrying the boat, he startled them, and they scattered. Lord Xu rode a dragon away, while Lord Hao walked upon the water to return.

At Luoxing Bay, they saw a beast in the water with eyes like cartwheels. Lord Hao said, “This creature dwells in the lands south of the Yangtze, impoverishing the people and obstructing merchants and travelers. If I do not remove it, how can I relieve the people’s suffering?” He cast his sword, striking the beast’s eye and killing it.

“To establish oneself, one must establish others; to achieve success, one must help others succeed. If one does not care for the common folk and remove tyranny and evil, how can one become a perfected immortal of the Nine Realms and accomplish deeds for all eternity?”

In the second year of the *Yuan Kang* era of the Jin dynasty, on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, the Perfected Lord, along with his entire household—over forty souls, high and low, along with his dwellings and even his parrot and dog—ascended as immortals. The villagers witnessed this and prostrated themselves in reverence for a long while.

That year, upon hearing the report, the provincial authorities dispatched envoys to build a residence and an abbey at the site. When the people of Shu Commandery learned of this, they traveled thousands of *li* to pay their respects. They constructed an immortal’s altar to repay his kindness and established a separate shrine hall, naming it the Hall of the Perfected Sage. To this day, it remains ornately adorned. Every year on the day of his ascension, offerings and fasting are observed without fail.

Before ascending to heaven, the Perfected Lord sat within a brocade canopy, intending to donate it to the Huangtang Abbey. As his entire household ascended, the canopy descended from the sky and returned to its original place. It floated in the empty air, circling for three days before ascending once more. The site where the canopy drifted was later granted a plaque, and an abbey was built, named the Abbey of the Drifting Canopy.

After his ascension, within a jade casket, he left behind two volumes of poems and teachings, a calf-drawn carriage, a stone mortar, two bronze swords, and a fan case. When Xu Deng was governor of Yuzhang, he sent men to retrieve the calf-drawn carriage to the city. Before bathing, he wished to inspect it but decided to wait until the next day, fearing the immortals would take offense at his haste. The carriage soon vanished into clouds of five colors, flying back to the Abbey of the Drifting Canopy. The governor never saw it again.

Though ages have passed, the objects remain intact. Only the two swords were later taken by Celestial Master Wan into the inner palace, where they were used in ritual offerings. The carriage and other items remain in the abbey. Every year, on the fifteenth days of the first, fifth, and eighth months, rites are held with fasting, chanting, and processions to pray for the elimination of disasters and the bestowal of blessings upon the king, ministers, and people. This tradition has continued unbroken to this day.

In the second year of the *Xian He* era of the Jin dynasty, the Perfected Lord was summoned to serve as magistrate of Shiyang County. After his term ended, he returned home. Despite repeated summons and even imperial edicts, he refused to serve again. Instead, he devoted himself to mutual encouragement with the Twelve Perfected Lords, cultivating the unchanging Dao and the arts of immortality. After eight years, on the fifteenth day of the eighth month in the second year of the *Yuan Kang* era, his entire household ascended to heaven, his parrot and dog with them. The altar and well at his former residence remain intact to this day.

The nephew Jian Chengzong of the second generation succeeded as a Daoist priest, upholding the rituals of cultivation and offering, broadly embracing the Way of filial piety.

In the third year of the *Yong He* era of the Jin dynasty, he was again summoned to serve as abbot of Xuan Temple. By the first year of the *Zhen Guan* era, the state no longer revered the Dao, and people grew distant from it; the temple halls stood desolate, as if in stillness.

In the third year of the *Yong Chun* era, he was again summoned to revive the Way of filial piety, succeeding in the transmission of the incense lineage. The succession passed thus: nephew Jian, Jian’s son Qingchang, Chang’s son Faqiang, Qiang’s son Lingyao, Yao’s nephew Xiaotong, Tong’s son Shusisi, Sisi’s son Fayun, Yun’s nephew Fagong, Gong’s nephew Jingyang, Yang’s son Xianlong, Long’s son Chengguan, Guan’s son Daochao, Chao’s son Yuanshu, Shu’s son Xuanji, Ji’s son Shao gui, Gui’s son Wenchu, Chu’s sons Wangxian and nephew Fazhen, Zhen’s nephew Haoran.

The transmission of the filial Way from the Two Perfected Lords of Wu and Xu concludes here.
