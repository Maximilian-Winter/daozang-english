**The Lineage Record of the Supreme Clarity Posterior Sage Dao Lord**
*Transmitted by Wang Yuanyou, disciple of the Eastern Palace Azure Lad of Fangzhu*

The Supreme Clarity Golden Portal Posterior Sage Thearch Lord Li, styled Zhongyuan,¹ also tabooed as Xuan Shui, with the courtesy name Ziguang and alternate name Shanyuan, was a scion of the Earthly Thearch’s lineage and a person of the Primordial Thearch’s era. In the seventh year of the Shanghe reign, the year *bingzi*, on the third month’s *zhihe* day, he was born in the Li family beneath Heaven’s Stiff Mountain in the Northern Lands. His mother first dreamed of dark clouds and sun and moon entwining her form, whereupon she conceived by inspiration. When she bathed, a host of dragons spat water into her washing basin.

At five years of age, he already delighted in the Dao and rejoiced in the Perfected. His words and hymns formed spontaneously. He would gaze at the sun with joyful laughter and sigh before the moon, observing the radiance of yang qi and the waning decline of the yin path. Thereupon, he gathered his hun-soul and refined his po-soul, guarded the treasured spirits of the womb, recorded his essence and stabilized his blood, solidified his fluids and consolidated his sinews. He then learned to swallow light and drink auroral mist, to chew and ingest flying roots.

By twenty years of age, he possessed a countenance of gold and jade. He then abandoned his home and departed from his kin, transcending the dust of the near and far. He secluded himself in chambers for prolonged fasting and roamed among renowned mountains. Alone, he held the talisman of the numinous terrace, embodying the transformation of mysterious illumination and yielding compliance. He awakened to the three qi and embraced their transformations, obscurely aligning with the pivot of spirit to equalize the Perfected. His aspiration soared emptily upward, his sincerity grasped the utmost subtlety. His spirit was secluded and luminous, his profound intent vast and serene. His transcendent principles were extraordinary and unbound, his depth majestic and profoundly tranquil.

He settled his heart beyond the celestial radiance, restrained his hun-soul to return within the Crimson Court, and disciplined his po-soul to guard the Azure Mystery in unison. He nurtured his qi within the chambers of cinnabar and plain silk. Thus, his spirit did not suffer loss, his numen did not scatter like a gale. His inner virtue was perfectly full, his external entanglements far severed. He cast aside the nets of immortals upon the earth and sought the Highest Perfected in the Purple Palace.

Thereupon, his essence moved the Great Void, his heart communed with the divine dawn. The Heavenly Thearch descended with teachings, streaming light converging upon him. He was bestowed the *Great Cavern Scripture of the Grand Yin and Grand Yang*, granted the *Twisting Morn’s Flying Canopy*, and given to drink the *Jade Essence of Revolving Waters*. He was presented with *Plain Feathers and Dark Wings* to ascend the eight directions.

Upon receiving this mandate, he retreated to fast and practice. He recited the scriptures in twenty-four matters, diligently yearning for the Upper Assemblies, his thoughts tireless. Whenever he became absorbed in the subtle and obscure, he would become still and forget to return. He probed the mechanisms to grasp the essence, then entrusted himself to solitary mastery. He studied the scriptures and chanted the mysterious, illuminating external things. He settled his spirit in the nine distant realms, attaining the contemplation of quiescent forgetting.

When the Lord’s lofty resonance initiated its time, minor entanglements were discarded. He harmonized with the multitude of companions, dispelled the obstructions at the edges of spirit, severed stagnation and dissolved doubts. His mysterious principles were vast and boundless. His fellowship daily drew from his pure waves, yet could not fathom the origin of the celestial abyss.

His penetration of the empty center was unimpeded, his numinous origin inwardly reflected. Then, the Purple Tenuity Highest Perfected Heavenly Thearch of Jade Clarity dispatched the *Eight Radiant Jade Lads* to welcome the Sage Lord, ascending with him to the Supreme Clarity Palace. He was bestowed the *Floriate Steel Cinnabar*, the *Jade Phoenix Seal*, the *Golden Perfected Jade Radiance*, the talisman of the *Divine Tiger*, and the *Feather of Flight*. He was given a *Crimson Brocade Dragon Skirt*, a *Blue Robe with Tiger Belt*, a *Sun Child of Radiant Rosy Clouds* at his waist, and a *Circular Countenance Spirit Crown* upon his head. He received the scriptures and was appointed *Supreme Clarity Golden Portal Posterior Sage Thearch Lord*.

He ascended to Supreme Clarity, roamed the Grand Ultimate Palace, and governed the Ten Heavens below. He was enfeoffed to oversee the myriad people, as well as the gods and immortals of the celestial rivers, seas, and earthly origins. He secretly inspected the roots within the *Yujue* and *Dongtai* caverns, ordered the mysterious and distributed qi, spread clouds and cleansed ford-crossings. He soared and gazed upon the Lesser Existence, unharnessed his carriage at Tortoise Mountain, and penetrated the hidden and illuminated the concealed, even the minutest details concerned him.

When the Sage Lord’s travels were to be witnessed, jade wheels and jasper carriages, azure ranks and dark dragons, three plain auroras and moon essence exhaling fragrance, flying sounds encircling the sun, flowing lightning brandishing blades, racing serpents striking swords, long fangs clashing bells—brilliant lights intermingled and blazed, three torches merged in brightness. Ahead, his whistling summoned nine phoenixes to sing in unison; behind, his blowing caused eight luan-birds to harmonize. Divine tigers raised their roars, flying dragons lowered their cries. Heavenly chimes played beneath his banners and canopies, a hundred sounds arose in the empty court. Numinous consorts chanted praises, immortal guests cleared the path. Divine maidens waved purple mists to disperse qi, jade lads wielded solar radiance to repel dusk. They sang long songs in cloud formations, without day or night.

At that time, celestial light stretched boundlessly, streaming brilliance to the eight directions. Truly, it was the grand spectacle of the Grand Ultimate, the exalted thearch of Supreme Clarity.

The reason he is exaltedly titled in Supreme Clarity is that his spirit is lofty and his numen empty. The reason he roams the Grand Ultimate is to assemble the host of Perfected and summon flying immortals. The reason he governs the Ten Heavens below is to be enfeoffed and oversee the myriad people. His secret inspections of the cavern-heavens are because there is nothing below that does not concern him.

Now, the separation and union of the two qi govern the timing of things; the waxing and waning of the three paths determine the conditions of emergence and withdrawal. When the appointed time arrives, one adapts accordingly; when the destiny comes, one follows and governs it.

During the Tang dynasty’s succession, spanning forty-six years between *dinghai* cycles, before and after the middle period, in the era of birds and beasts, the dynastic mandate opened and closed. East and west contended for hegemony to support the weak lord, who bore the names of the Nine Unities and the One. When the reign approached its end and prosperity waned, in the year *jiashen* and the years before and after, he planted good people and eradicated cruel folk. Epidemics and floods raged above, war and fire burned below. The wicked were all destroyed, the malevolent all perished. Those who loved the Dao hid in the wilds, good people ascended the mountains. The turbid currents surged and scattered, driven into the whale’s abyss—all was distinctly separated.

By the *renchen* year, on the sixth day of the third month, the Sagely Lord descended, his radiance illuminating the myriad people.

At that time, the Sagely Lord emerged from the western mountains of Qingcheng, passing through the northern clouds of Longnan. Beyond the Dragon’s Candle, he turned west to the Pass of the Nine Streams, then east to the morning falls of Fulin, gazing south toward the clouds of Zhushan. Riding the Three Pure Flying Chariot, followed by a procession of ten thousand dragons and tiger-borne palanquins, his celestial light shone universally, his divine gaze surveying the Three Luminaries. Thereupon, the wicked were extinguished, and the compassionate preserved amid water and fire. Those who initiated the people in learning became Immortal Envoys; those who attained the Dao became Immortal Officials.

If one can refine the Cavern Chamber in the Upper Prime, cultivate the Nine Perfected with unceasing diligence, traverse the Hidden Scriptures of the Seven Numinous, and exhaust the Eight Simplicities with sincerity, one may traverse the Three Calamities unharmed. One must then witness the renewal in Great Peace and be granted the scriptures of Immortal Officials, attaining long life as a divine transcendent.

Yet these arcane texts and numinous arts are concealed within the Golden Portals of the Upper Clarity Palace, rarely seen even in catalogs. The divine transcendent’s teachings descend but thrice within seven hundred years. Transmission is not bound by worthiness or folly; those who cultivate with a devoted heart may all ascend as flying immortals. However, only those endowed with the immortal register’s bone, the jade name, and the *fangzhu* may obtain them. Without such signs, one shall never encounter these texts. Even if, by chance, one among millions stumbles upon them, it is by the decree of fate’s relay, for transmission has its appointed recipients. Those who cross paths are destined to be Numinous Envoys, allowing the text to pass to them. To possess it yet fail to practice is to defy the hidden teachings. Seekers of immortality should traverse the famous mountains, kneel in prayer to the celestial spirits, and seek these esoteric instructions, that they may obtain the treasured secrets and ascend to the offices of divine transcendents.

Thereafter, the Sagely Lord shall assess their coarse and refined qualities, promoting them to official ranks. Some may be appointed as Immortal Lords, others as feudal lords, aiding in the sagely governance of the people, ordering *qi*, and spreading virtue. Some may be entrusted with a single district or the governance of a state. Those who invoke the sun with the *Yuyi*, ensnare the moon with the *Jielin*, chant the *Upper Scripture of the Great Cavern* and the *Seven Transformations of the Revolving Script*, follow the true scriptures of the Golden Portals, and bear the great talisman of the Divine Tiger; those who deploy the Eight Paths to bind spirits, open the Purple Texts to startle the ephemeral, recite the *Golden Root* to endure, set forth the Nine Reds to seal mounds, command the *Qusu* to summon ghosts, employ the *Zidu* to illuminate the primordial, drink the Five Phases to call souls, and draw from the *Langjie* without cease; those who pass perilous trials without doubt and tread through war and fire without fear—all such shall be appointed as Left and Right Immortal Dukes or Left and Right Grand Masters, or as ministers and chancellors overseeing the immortal lords of the supreme states.

The Sagely Lord’s procession of tiger-borne palanquins and ten thousand dragons serves to review the assembled immortals, bestowing ranks according to their talents. Though the Sagely Lord governs the myriad people and gazes upon all living things, he roams freely through the Golden Portals, dwells in the palaces of Upper Clarity, rests his form in the Great Void, and wanders the Five Cities, surveying the Ten Heavens and the hundred regions to ensure Great Peace.

Those who witness Great Peace may be compassionate and benevolent, merely upholding goodness; or they may be Dao-seeking, immortal-believing scholars fit for instruction; or they may be transcendent beings granted scriptures, guarding their refined essence and precious embryo; or they may be those who have attained the Dao and immortality through sincerity; or those whose names are recorded in the mysterious registers, whose seven generations have accumulated virtue, and whose descendants are destined for transcendence; or those born with azure bones, communing with spirits and connecting with the true; or those of extraordinary talent and serene disposition, naturally refined and surpassing. The ranks of immortals number in the hundreds, varying in eminence. The Sagely Lord appoints them according to their abilities, establishing greater and lesser lords, each with their proper rank, to govern the seed people.

Each year, the lords ascend to Upper Clarity to present themselves before the Sagely Lord and receive their duties. Every five years, the Sagely Lord descends to tour the lords, inspect the seed people, and hear the principles of immortality.

For the Sagely Lord’s own path to the Dao was fraught with hardship: enduring the trials of his master, treading the paths of hunger and cold, braving water and fire’s adversities, setting aside personal attachments to his five relations, and undergoing the Celestial Emperor’s great trials. His heart remained steadfast and upright, his resolve unwavering in life and death. Ten thousand evils could not assail his spirit, a thousand demons could not delude his truth. Thus, his sincerity and mystery flowed unimpeded, and the numinous spirits responded in kind. The Supreme Sovereign imparted his instructions, and the Heavenly Worthy bestowed the Dao.

His illumination is vast and resonant, the gates of mystery flung wide, his model lofty and peerless, his insight profound and independent. The hidden paths branch in myriad directions, the heavenly principles unfold boundlessly. No mere bamboo slips or brushstrokes could fully record them. This text sketches but a thousandth part, outlining the essentials to transmit to those whose bones align with transcendence.

Those who obtain this text shall have their names inscribed in the mysterious register and presented to Upper Clarity, where they may be appointed as Immortal Ministers. Those who practice the true affairs of the Golden Portals may be elevated to Grand Masters, attended by ten jade lads for the scriptures and ten jade maidens for the Purple Texts of the Golden Portals. Whenever they read, chant, or enact these teachings, they must bow reverently and burn incense abundantly beside the texts. To treat the numinous records with disdain is to become a lowly ghost, and three generations of one’s ancestors shall be punished. The jade lads and maidens shall report their transgressions and record even the slightest lapse in sincerity or goodness.

The *Fangzhu* and the Azure Lad of the Eastern Palace, under the instruction of the Later Sagely Dao Lord, compiled this chronicle and presented it to the Sagely Lord. It was transmitted to the Azure Lad’s disciple, Wang Yuanyou, to be disseminated to those whose bones align with transcendence. It may be transmitted once every hundred years, thrice within seven hundred years, to those who seek the Dao and are destined to attain immortality.

The Sagely Lord declared: Those who obtain my chronicle are those whose names are recorded in the mysterious register, whose talents are destined for transcendence, or whose names are inscribed in the golden and jade records of the immortals. If, having obtained this chronicle, one treasures and upholds it without further cultivation, they shall still be granted the white-day liberation of the corpse. If, after obtaining it, one abandons virtue, copies the true form for worldly ends, or allows their nature to regress and their resolve to falter, such a one is but a frivolous talent of lower rank, unworthy of the fragrant bones. Yet, by virtue of obtaining my chronicle, they shall still be appointed as rulers of the underworld, to purge their turbid substance and cleanse their defiled souls.

From this point onward, let the progression be gradual, with ranks and stages, that you may awaken from the great dream of delusion.

All you disciples, be diligent and cautious. Do not reveal this to the corpses of the faithless. When you bear my chronicle and enter the midst of plague, flood, fire, or warfare, amidst mountain spirits and forest specters, or amidst a thousand evils and ten thousand calamities, none shall withstand you. Those who see you shall be filled with joy, for jade lads attend this text, shielding your body.

Should wicked men with wicked hearts falsely assail you, I shall command the spirits of mountains and rivers to strike down their lives. Do not think the Dao distant—its numinous gaze is ever-present. From the Great Void above and the Mysterious Emptiness within, I observe you as clearly as the eye beholds the nose.

If you still doubt, you may test this once, but dare you violate my covenant? See then whether I can discern the unspoken thoughts of your heart and the hidden fortunes or misfortunes within.

All who receive this text must swear an oath of secrecy. I now send down teachings to those of destined bone and those who, with sincere hearts, seek the Dao and guard their integrity. I dispatch Ma Ming, Zhang Ling, Yin Sheng, Wang Bao, Mo Di, Sima Jizhu, and the Seven Perfected of the Terrace of Pure Emptiness, along with the Eight Venerable Masters—twenty-four in all. Some conceal their names, others reveal them; some alter their surnames and given names, making them difficult to distinguish.

You need only cultivate a heart of utmost sincerity, unwavering day and night, and you shall surely meet these beings. Once you have met them, they will reveal their true names to you.

Later, the Sagely Lord commanded Lord Wang to oversee the twenty-four Perfected, determining the merit of their teachings. The twenty-four Perfected receive their duties from the Azure Lad of Fangzhu and their disciples from Lord Wang. Lord Wang first informs the twenty-four Perfected of those who may succeed, and only then do the Perfected accept their tasks and instruct them.

*The Sagely Lord’s Chronicle* is entrusted solely to Lord Wang, who selects those worthy of receiving it. It is not transmitted indiscriminately by all the Perfected.

To know the names of the twenty-four Perfected, consult the end of my *Scripture of the Azure Essentials and Multitudinous Writings*, where the texts, talismans, and divine incantations they teach are listed in order.

The scriptures thus transmitted—*The Conjoined Radiance of Yu and Yi*, *The Great Cavern Mystery Scripture*, *The Purple Texts of the Numinous Writ of the Golden Watchtower of Shangqing*, *The Eight Simplicities True Scripture*, *The Nine Perfected Central Scripture of the Hidden Writ of the Most High*, *The Secret Sayings of the Eight Dao of the Yellow and the Old*, *The Ten Secrets of the Great Elixir*, and *The Jade Characters of the Cavern Chamber*—bestow the ranks of Left and Right Immortal Dukes, Great Masters, and the highest ministers of the Left and Right.

The remaining scriptures—*The Nine Elixirs and Transformations*, *The Supreme Scripture of Great Clarity*, *The Yellow Simplicity and Daoist Essence*, and *The Azure Record of the Celestial Pass*—bestow the ranks of Perfected, overseers of Perfected Palaces, and lords and marquises of immortal realms. Each has its proper order and gradation, fully recorded in the Azure Records and White Slips of the Fangzhu Palace.

Later, the Sagely Lord Peng, whose taboo name is Guangyuan, also called Xuanxu, with the style Dazhuang and another style Zhengyang, surnamed Peng but also Li, or known as Lord Pengxian or Lord Lijun, began his Daoist practice. Born in the era of the Human Sovereign, he holds the rank of Left Perfected Guardian of the Grand Tenuity and is destined to receive the mandate to instruct the multitudes. As Grand Preceptor to Lord Li, he governs the Luminous Upper Terrace of the Northern Pond Palace of the Grand Tenuity.

Every two thousand five hundred years, Lord Peng alters his name and style, traversing the Great Void, roaming the Eight Obscurities, ascending to the Utmost Above and descending to the Utmost Below. Few among the Perfected have beheld his radiant countenance. Yet the true names and styles he has borne in his Daoist journey are definitively recorded in the Azure Records and White Slips of the Fangzhu Palace.

Later Sagely Lord Li, Supreme Minister of the Fangzhu Palace, Azure Lad
Later Sagely Lord Li, Supreme Guardian of the Great Elixir Palace, Southern Culmen Primordial Lord
Later Sagely Lord Li, Supreme Preceptor of the White Mountain Palace, Grand Simplicity Perfected Lord
Later Sagely Lord Li, Supreme Chancellor of the Western City Palace, Lord Wang of the Assembly of Perfected

The four grand ministers above serve as auxiliary pillars, while the remaining three hundred sixty officials—including ministers, celestial lords, and grand masters—are all enumerated in the Azure Records and White Slips, though their names and styles shall not be recounted one by one here.

The Azure Lad states: Those inscribed in the bone registers are predisposed to love the Dao; such lovers of the Dao all possess the resolve for transcendence. Yet among those with transcendent resolve, some falter while others persevere—those who falter do so because their ancestral merits are insufficient, while those who persevere have their names predestined in the mysterious registers. Some love the Dao but lack devotion, for their世virtue remains incomplete.

When the celestial registers manifest in the Mysterious Palace, the signs of qi and destiny are diagnosed in the body’s form. When the register’s characters are revealed in the Great Ultimate, the heart and spirit align within the cinnabar chamber. Those born with names of gold and jade in the registers bear eyes like sunlight, green teeth and white blood. Such persons are benevolent and joyful in the Dao, luminous in wisdom and noble in bearing.

Those inscribed with golden script and jade registers in the Upper Clarity possess the "River Chariot" mark on their backs and the "Recumbent Bone" upon their chests. Such persons are reverent, humble, and extend their virtue even to insects. Those with cinnabar slips and azure texts in the Great Ultimate Palace bear palm lines resembling "stacked men" or "inverted greatness." Such persons are discreet and devoted to truth, pure in emptiness and tolerant of faults.

Those with dark and plain purple names in the Fangzhu Palace have eyes with four concentric rings suffused with violet light, illuminating their forms. Such persons cultivate profound and wondrous practices, maintaining purity and shunning defilement. Those with jade registers and crimson names in the Great Clarity possess voices like jade tones and golden resonance, square mouths and round eyes. Such persons are vast in generosity and boundless in compassion, regarding others as though wounded.

Those with jade slips and golden names in the Great Simplicity bear white marks upon their abdomens and emit purple qi from their mouths. Such persons are merciful and spiritually attuned, humbly extending kindness to all. Those with cinnabar texts and purple registers in the Southern Culmen have heads that emanate five qi, ascending to meet the layered clouds of the celestial towers. Such persons are gentle, benevolent, and devoted to aiding the destitute, rescuing the distressed and relieving hardship.

Those with dark jade and green registers in the Dipper possess nine apertures in their hearts, brocade patterns upon their lungs, jade pellets beneath their jaws, green veins in their eyes, and a thousand orderly lines upon their brows—like the walls of a city—with receding hairlines and exposed temples. Their bright halls are smooth and pale, the thousand lines serving as conduits for true passage, their broad foreheads as dwellings for the numinous. Such persons are compassionate toward the poor and humble, extending kindness even to birds and beasts.

Those with azure-gold and vermilion script in the Upper Prime of the Mysterious Palace have cinnabar hearts with purple apertures, yellow blossoms encircling their stomachs, fragrant breath, and teeth brimming with jade nectar. Such persons, from youth, delight in gazing upon the flowing clouds of sun and moon, and the luminous forms of stars and constellations. Their natures are pure, their bones firm, and their sincerity probes the mysteries.

Those with white jade and golden characters in the Cinnabar Terrace of the Mysterious Capital possess azure livers with purple vessels, kidneys adorned with damask patterns, dark chests brimming with essence, and forms abundant yet spirits immaculate. Their bodies are fragrant and supple, their blood clear and qi lustrous. Such persons are absorbed in the distant and mysterious, savoring the numinous essence of landscapes. They are generous, humble, and devoted to rescuing those in distress.

Those with jade tablets and azure script in the Three Primes Palace possess purple brains and brocade tongues, dark marks at their temples, green intestines and vermilion marrow, square heavens and round foreheads, hidden bones beneath, soft hair with violet sheen, triple apertures in their ears, movements somewhat sluggish, eyes emitting flowing light, azure essence congealing into nectar, palm lines radiating in four directions, and teeth with triple edges. Such persons possess numinous hearts and empty benevolence, their compassion evoking spirits. They delight in subtlety, reverence, and faith, cherishing forests in spring and clear flowing waters. They hold mountains and rivers in their hearts, yearning to inscribe their names upon the sacred peaks, preserving their souls and nurturing their spirits. Their aspirations soar to the Azure Terrace, far removed from the tastes of celestial transcendents.

All who bear such marks are destined to ascend as transcendents. Some may attain this through study, others without it—but the essential requirement is a love for the Dao. Those who love the Dao and delve into its subtleties will swiftly achieve transformation and ascent.

Next, the mark of the Dark Mountain: a black mark upon the bridge of the nose. This must be paired with the Dark Mound upon the abdomen, for the two must correspond. The Dark Mound is likewise a black mark. If either is absent, the signs of transcendence are incomplete. Those with foul breath and tolerance for filth corrupt the signs of the Dark Mountain and Dark Mound.

Next, the Azure Bones: such persons delight in the fragrance of the five incenses and are drawn to the affairs of spirits and numina. Next, the gait of the crane and the stride of the dragon, jade pillows upon the nape, hidden stars behind the ears, dark marks beneath the ribs, networked patterns upon the body, true hearts and tranquil gallbladders, firm ears and expansive qi—these are all secondary signs of transcendence.

The Dark Continent also bears registers of names inscribed in yellow gold. Those who attain liberation through the corpse without study become masters of corpse-transcendence; with study, they achieve the transcendence of ascending in broad daylight. Next, the Three Offices of Mount Tai record the lands of the living, delivering them from the realms of death. Such persons’ souls are not bound to mortal ends but roam without limit. Thus, those who study the Dao may attain the transcendence of traversing the earthly realm. They must relocate every thirty years, changing their names and abodes, yet face no end to their lives. This is because the Three Offices’ mysterious registers and white ledgers do not record them in places of death—it is not that the Three Offices arbitrarily assign them to mortal fates.

The Great Yin records life and death in black registers and white ledgers, crimson cinnabar slips and bound bamboo tablets. Births and deaths follow in sequence, their numbers aligned. For every six thousand slips, one person is recorded in a place without death. Such persons often live long, resisting death, and may exceed a hundred years. When they die, it is sudden, without pain or illness. If they further pursue the study of the Dao, they are likely to succeed and may be taught.

Yet such persons are often timid and gentle, drawn to subtle and wondrous affairs—all signs of transcendence. Next, those with unwavering resolve for the supreme Dao, steadfast and upright in intent, or those who broadly practice hidden virtue—relieving the poor, aiding the distressed, bestowing kindness upon the destitute, burying the exposed bones of the dead—whose virtue surpasses the ancients, who are upright, fair, gentle, and humble, neither licentious nor harmful, or whose ancestors bestowed kindness, establishing merit across generations, whose virtue is recorded in the Three Offices, and who have accomplished three hundred good deeds—such persons, through the study of the Dao, may all attain transcendence.

Those whose hearts are upright—even heaven and earth cannot oppose them;
those whose spirits are steadfast—even ghosts and gods cannot resist them;
those whose hun-souls are luminous—no multitude of evils can assail them;
those whose po-souls are pure—no myriad demons can disturb them;
those whose essence is clear—no corrupt corpses can seize them;
those whose fluids are abundant—the Three Worms cannot disorder them;
those whose blood is congealed—no turbid qi can disperse it.

Thus, those who study the Dao must fortify their true hearts and steel their spirits, temper their po-souls and embrace their hun-souls, confine a thousand evils within the prison of the eight wilds, and seal ten thousand demons at the farthest reaches of the nine distances. With utter sincerity, they preserve the True Unity in the Great Beginning, diligently and ever desiring to spread their wings and ascend as flying transcendents. The Vermilion Spirit rests in the Crimson Abode, the Five Treasures guard the Pure Mystery; they tread the path of trial and remain unshaken, dwell amidst honor and disgrace yet do not waver. They forsake the throne of the south without a glance, cast aside ten thousand gold pieces without regret, find sweetness in hardship and adversity, and delight in quiet retreat upon the hills and mountains. Guarding their sincere hearts without weariness, they may endure as long as heaven and earth. Only such as these may be spoken to of the study of the Dao.

If one possesses none of these signs, nor conducts oneself thus—though one be a hero of surpassing excellence, with ambitions to swallow the four seas, overflowing with bold qi and lofty aspirations that touch the clouds, profound and resplendent in wisdom, soaring in eloquence and discerning speech, refined yet boldly unconventional, unraveling the obscure and synthesizing the stagnant, mouthing emptiness while eyes rove in all directions—such a one is fundamentally unsuited to transcendence. This is what is meant by "toiling in vain all one’s years, without hope of attainment."

The *Upper Clarity Records of the Perfected Dao Lord* concludes here. #1 "All Vast Origins" — likely a scribal error for "Taboo Name: Hongyuan."
