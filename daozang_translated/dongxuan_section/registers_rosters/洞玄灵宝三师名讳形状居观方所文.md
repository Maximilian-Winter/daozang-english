**The Text on the Three Masters’ Names, Styles, Appearances, Abodes, and Locations of the Dongxuan Lingbao Tradition**

Wanfu states: The scriptures say, *"Without a master, one cannot be delivered."* They also say, *"First visualize the Three Masters, then practice the Dao."* In all matters—whether reciting scriptures, lecturing, chanting, performing rituals, burning incense, entering chambers, or ascending altars—one must first pay homage to the master and visualize them, then make vows to deliver both one’s nine generations of ancestors and oneself. Without adhering to this method, the true numinous beings will not descend. To pay homage to the master, one must know their location; to visualize them, one must clearly recognize their appearance. At the time of receiving the Dao, the master should instruct accordingly. Thus, from the *Zhengyi* tradition upward to the *Dongzhen*, the names, styles, appearances, abodes, and locations of the Three Masters for each ordination are recorded as follows.

The above is written in black ink on yellow silk. The master burns incense and bestows it [upon the disciple].

The disciple, upon receiving each master’s name, bows three times in succession. If the master possesses a genealogy, it shall also be copied and transmitted separately as prescribed in the scriptures. Once the disciple has memorized and refined [the teachings], they shall seal them together with the dharma.

The Six Illuminations, Five Safeguards, and Three Witnesses, though not within the bounds of constant contemplation, are the causes of my accomplishment—thus they should also be borne in mind as steps toward entering perfection. Hence they are recorded here.

Here ends the text on the names, styles, appearances, and abodes of the Three Masters of the Dongxuan Lingbao tradition.
