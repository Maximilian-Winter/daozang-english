**The Supreme Perfected One’s Essential Precepts on the Ritual Dignity of the Numinous Treasure Purification and Precepts**

The Supreme Perfected One states: Those who study the Dao of the Perfected Immortals and ascend in broad daylight all take purification and precepts as the foundation for establishing virtue. The *Numinous Treasure Scriptures* contain great methods: the first, third, fifth, seventh, ninth, and eleventh months are the six purification months of the year. The first, eighth, fourteenth, fifteenth, eighteenth, twenty-third, twenty-fourth, twenty-eighth, twenty-ninth, and thirtieth days are the ten purification days of the month. Long purifications and prolonged contemplation are practiced in order to attain the Dao of soaring through the void. Thus, the Supreme Purification of the Numinous Treasure, revered by the August Elder Heavenly Worthy and the Great Sage, is constantly observed without weariness—how much more should Daoists and immortals yearn for it with reverence?

Since ancient times, those who ascend the Dao of immortality must invoke the Most High and teach the essential precepts of purification, precepts, ritual dignity, and regulation. This scripture is profound and wondrous; you must listen with a tranquil mind.

The Supreme Perfected One states: Upon entering the purification hall, face east. Addressing the incense burner, pray:

*"August Numinous Treasure Lord Lao, summon the Perfected Officials, the Merit Officers, the Messengers, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Direct Attendants, and the Incense-Bearing Messengers to report to the Supreme Three Heavens of the Mysterious Origin of the Great Dao. We now enter stillness, burn incense, and pay homage to the Perfected. May the upright qi of the Ten Directions of the Most High enter our bodies, so that our prayers may be heard at once and ascend before the Jade Emperor’s throne of the True Unity."*

Next, kneel lengthily and strike the Heavenly Drum twenty-four times. Respectfully summon from within our bodies the Perfected Officials and Merit Officers of the Five Agents, the Enforcing and Transforming Yin-Yang Merit Officers of the Supreme Three Heavens, the Officers of the Way who Deliver from Disaster and Dispel Calamities, the Lords who Resolve Adversities—twelve each. Summon from our bodies the Governing Lords, the Great Generals who Establish Standards and Oversee Merit, the Front Merit-Reporting and Rear Execution-Commissioning Commanders of the Post Station, the Post Station Assistants, and the Inspecting Envoys of the Four Quarters.

From within our bodies, summon two each of the following: the Transcendent Spirits, Direct Messengers, Orthodox Unity Merit Officers, Healing Merit Officers, Left and Right Official Messengers, Yin-Yang Divine Decision Officers, Chariot-Commanding Scarlet Talisman Officers, Gale-Riding Courier Officers, Post-Horse Memorial Officers, and Flying Dragon Riders. Let those summoned don their solemn attire, caps, and pendent tassels, and compose their ritual dignity. The Direct Merit Officers wear the Heaven-Piercing Cap and plain black silk robes. The Orthodox Unity Merit Officers wear the Vermilion Yang Headband and crimson ceremonial robes. The Messengers wear the Nine Virtues Cap, multicolored longevity robes, tiger talisman belts, and hold jade tablets.

The Direct Merit Officers stand at the four directions, the Orthodox Unity Merit Officers stand at the center, and the Healing Merit Officers guard our bodies. The Left Official Messengers hold standards at the front, the Right Official Messengers bear banners at the rear, the Yang Divine Decision Officers stand to the left, the Yin Divine Decision Officers to the right. The Upper Merit Officers gaze toward the heavens, the Middle Merit Officers survey the eight directions, and the Qi-Urging Merit Officers hasten the Ten Directions’ Official Messengers to encircle our bodies.

The Gentleman-Officers, Tiger Warriors, Deceit-Detecting Hook Riders, the Directors of the Assembly of Officials, the Heavenly Couriers, Armored Soldiers, Heavenly Ding Warriors, Qi-Gathering and Qi-Consuming Officers, Spirit-Gathering and Spirit-Consuming Officers, Ghost-Gathering and Ghost-Consuming Officers, Evil-Gathering and Evil-Consuming Officers, Essence-Gathering and Essence-Consuming Officers, Poison-Gathering and Poison-Consuming Officers, Talisman-Executing and Shrine-Destroying Officers, Chariot-Commanding Scarlet Talisman Officers, Gale-Riding Courier Officers, Post-Horse Memorial Officers, and Flying Dragon Riders—station themselves around us, front and back, left and right.

Once the Merit Officers and Messengers have arrayed themselves in solemn attire, they arrange the ceremonial regalia and report to the Numinous Treasure Officials, leading the Perfected Ones who oversee the purification, along with the generals and officers. From the Heavenly Master’s twenty-four established dioceses, the thirty-six sacred retreats, the seventy-two blessed lands, the three hundred sixty-five renowned mountains including Kunlun, the thirty-six thousand spirits of the Upper Palaces, the sun, moon, and constellations, the Jade Armillary Sphere, the Five Emperors of Heaven and Earth, the officials, generals, and officers of the Three Realms, the Two Mysteries, Three Origins, Four Beginnings, and the four cardinal directions’ winds and qi, the Officers of the Celestial Stems and Earthly Branches, the Lords of Summoning and Investigation, the Elder Lords of the Eastern Nine Yi and Hu, the Southern Eight Man and Yue, the Western Six Rong and Di, the Northern Five Di and Qiang, the Central Three Qin and Cang, the Lords of the Five Peaks, Four Waterways, Mounds, and Marshes, the deities of all temples, the spirits of mountains, rivers, streams, valleys, forests, and the Twelve Stream Maidens of Mengchang, the original and fundamental local earth gods, and the officers of the altars of soil and grain—let all don solemn attire at once and, together with the Merit Officers, Messengers, and Flying Dragon Riders from within our bodies, report to the Supreme Boundless Great Dao, the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao, the Supreme Lord Lao, the Supreme Elder, the Boundless Mysterious Elder, the Ten Directions’ Boundless Great Dao, the Heavenly Worthies of the Multitude of Sages of the Dao and Virtue, the Perfected August Emperors, the Heavenly Emperors, the Heavenly Master Lords, the Numinous Treasure Overseers of the Great Dharma of Purification, and all the lords and officials.

We, born and raised in the world of demons and customs, have sunk into the final age, indulging in pleasure and glory. By karmic conditions of past lives, we have suddenly been awakened and delivered, able to serve the Great Dao. Yet, due to our foolish fondness for the true Dao of ascending as immortals, our accumulated sins are deep, and our bonds remain unbroken. Today, we gather to perform the Supreme Purification of the Numinous Treasure, burning incense and reciting scriptures to seek the fulfillment of our wishes. Let the Merit Officers, Messengers, and Flying Dragon Riders separately report and transmit our prayers upward in due time.

Once the report is complete, let all return into our bodies and resume their positions in the palaces.

When the summons is again issued, proceed as before. After sounding the celestial drum three times in succession, the Immortal Duke declares: This is called the Rite of Initiating the Fast’s Petition.

At each of the six daily periods, burn incense and direct your prayers solely toward the incense burner, then perform the prostration. Address the incense burner with these sacred words:

Incense Officials and Messengers, Lords of the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger, Bearers of the Fragrant Offering—may this place of fasting and this hall of purification spontaneously generate golden liquid, cinnabar, azure mushrooms, and numinous herbs. May the hundred spirits assemble here before this incense burner, that we may attain the Dao, achieve transcendence as immortals, bring blessing to our households, and bestow grace upon the world.

May the jade maidens and immortal youths of the ten directions attend the rising incense smoke and transmit our words directly to the golden gates and jade throne of the Most High Jade Emperor.

Next, at each period, those observing the fast kneel in reverence. The fast’s sponsor declares his name: I, So-and-so, Master of Sacrifices and Preceptor, along with my fellow devotees, now burn incense. Taking the incense, he ignites it and offers his prayer. Three incense sticks are burned, and three prayers are uttered.

The first prayer:
We burn this incense, dedicating our bodies, spirits, and lives to the Great Dao. Prostrating ourselves, we dedicate our lives to the Three Venerables of the Most High. May this merit flow to our seven generations of parents, delivering them from the ten sufferings and eight difficulties, ascending to the celestial halls where clothing and sustenance arise naturally, and abiding forever in non-action. Today, we burn incense and take refuge in the virtue of our Preceptors, the Great Sages, and the Perfected. After attaining the Dao, may we ascend into formlessness and unite with the True.

The Three Venerables are: the Venerable Dao, the Venerable Scriptures, and the Venerable Perfected. The Three Ones are venerated within the human body.

The second prayer:
We burn this incense, dedicating our bodies, spirits, and lives to the Great Dao. Prostrating ourselves, we dedicate our lives to the Three Venerables of the Most High. May this merit flow to the Emperor, the Lords of the Realm, and their ministers. May we, our Dharma-teachers, parents, fellow students, and all worthy Daoists be delivered from the ten sufferings and eight difficulties, preserving their blessed destinies and ultimately entering non-action. Today, we burn incense and take refuge in the virtue of our Preceptors, the Great Sages, and the Perfected. After attaining the Dao, may we ascend into formlessness and unite with the True.

The third prayer:
We burn this incense, dedicating our bodies, spirits, and lives to the Great Dao. Prostrating ourselves, we dedicate our lives to the Three Venerables of the Most High. May this merit flow to our own bodies, granting us immortal deliverance, ascent into non-action, and union with the virtue of the Four Great Ones. May all people under heaven—creeping, flying, and wriggling beings, all sentient life—be delivered from the ten sufferings and eight difficulties, the five poisons, water and fire, bandits, plagues, demonic harms, and all calamities. May each preserve their blessings and emoluments, dwelling in peace and non-action. Today, we burn incense and take refuge in the virtue of our Preceptors, the Great Sages, and the Perfected. After attaining the Dao, may we ascend into formlessness and unite with the True.

During each incense-burning period, participants take turns offering incense. One of high virtue is chosen as the fast’s sponsor, known as the Dharma-teacher. It is not necessary for each person to recite the prayers.

When the incense-burning and prayers are complete, announce that the offering is finished. All participants turn to the east and bow, declaring:
We now dedicate our lives to the Boundless Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the East, beseeching that our wishes be granted and our desires fulfilled.

Next, turn to the south, then the west, then the north, then the east again, followed by the southeast, southwest, northwest, above, and below. This is called the Ten Directions’ Aspiration. For each direction, perform three prostrations—or one, as previously instructed.

Afterward, face due west and bow twice, declaring:
We now dedicate our lives to the Great Sages, the Perfected, and the Venerable Lords of the West who have attained the Dao, beseeching that our wishes be granted.

Next, face north, then east, then south. Turn toward the scriptures and recite the prayers three times as before.

All these actions are directed toward the incense burner, ensuring proper orientation. This is the Rite of the Ten Directions in the Numinous Treasure Fast, wondrous and profound in the Great Law of the Most High.

All should proceed with calm and graceful steps, maintaining proper order. Men and women must not intermingle, so that the dignity of the rites accords with celestial statutes. Thus shall they be beheld by gods and spirits, admired by flying immortals, and serve as a model for the Three Realms.

Even immortals practice this fast without ceasing—how much more should ordinary worthies do so.

When the prostrations are complete, the participants move in sequence to the left, circumambulating the incense burner three times. At this time, they should chant the *Step Through the Void* and *Tread the Empty Firmament* verses.

The purpose of circumambulating the incense burner is to emulate the Primordial Root of the Supreme Jade Grotto Heaven, the Seven-Treasure Spontaneous Terrace where the Most High Great Dao Lord resides in the Great Canopy Heaven. There, the supreme Perfected Ones observe the fast, recite scriptures, and circumambulate the Most High’s Seven-Treasure Terrace—this rite follows their example.

Moreover, all disciples of the Three Caverns who practice fasting should burn incense and chant hymns, emulating the Perfected Ones and Great Sages as they circumambulate the terrace of the Most High Dao Lord.

Those who seek the Supreme Orthodox and True Great Dao may also circumambulate the high seat of the *Highest Clarity Numinous Treasure Scriptures*.

The reason for circumambulating the incense burner is that worldly scholars are often superficial and unable to receive the supreme scriptures. Thus, the fast’s method is demonstrated through the sincerity of the incense smoke. Where the heart’s devotion reaches, the incense smoke follows, ascending to the Most High. The Dao-eye of the Most High ever perceives the good and evil of all under heaven, leaving nothing unobserved. How can one not tremble with reverence?

The Immortal Duke says: Always visualize the Most High Perfected Ones upon the high seat, turning the scriptures and expounding the Dharma.

**Method for Turning the Scriptures**
Set up a small platform facing east for the recitation and transmission of scriptures. According to the Numinous Treasure method, the platform should be five feet high, five feet wide, and five feet long.

Alternatively: the platform should be four feet five inches high, five feet wide, and five feet long.

A quiet chamber may suffice for a temporary retreat, serving as a provisional space for the observance of the fast on the appointed day. Yet if one seeks to maintain a perpetual fast and aspire to the immortal Dao over time, a separate hall for fasting should be established—immaculate, serene, and solemn—where scripture tables, incense burners, and a high seat are arranged within. Then, facing the high seat, bow three times in full prostration and declare:

*"We now take refuge in the Most High, the Boundless and Supreme Dao, the Perfected Ones; in the thirty-six divisions of the sacred scriptures and talismanic seals; and in the Three Supreme Ones of the Most High. As we burn incense and turn the scriptures, we reverently beseech the grace of the Most High to deliver us. We pray for the liberation of our seven generations of ancestors, for emperors and common folk, for all sentient beings, and for ourselves and our households—great and small—hoping to be absolved of the grave sins and transgressions of past and present lives. These may include: regicide or patricide; disobedience to parents; betrayal of teachers or deceit toward friends; forsaking truth for falsehood; banditry or the invasion of kingdoms; the slaughter of other nations; the killing of beings for pleasure; adultery or illicit relations within clans; the severing of mother and child or the seizure of another’s beloved; the murder of sages or Daoist priests; tyranny as a ruler or disloyalty as a minister; oppressing subordinates and cruelly abusing the people while seeking personal glory; the mutual destruction of kin; the desecration of sacred halls or altars; the theft or burning of scriptures; the defilement of sacred texts; the mockery of the Dao and virtue as mere delusion; the ridicule of others’ good deeds while claiming superiority; envy of the worthy and resentment of those more capable; the failure to honor the virtuous, respect the elderly, or care for the six afflictions; cursing the wind and rain, or reviling heaven and earth, the sun and moon, stars and constellations, emperors and lords, teachers and Daoist priests; contempt for the Four Great Elements; blasphemy against spirits and gods, dismissing them as ignorant; or hypocrisy—speaking one thing while thinking another, deceiving even one’s own shadow. Such sins, too numerous to recall, accumulate across lifetimes, binding us inextricably, perpetuating karmic grievances without end. We now burn incense and perform the Dao, seeking self-deliverance. Henceforth, we repent and submit to the precepts, vowing never to transgress again. Whatever sins we confess, we prostrate ourselves fully, hearts filled with joy. Thus, the sages will surely release us from the eight sufferings and all hardships, guiding us to the realm of non-action and the Dao."*

The Perfected One of the Great Ultimate says: *"In the Numinous Treasure fast, ten lamps are lit to correspond to the ten directions. Ten is the supreme number, for humans are born after ten months. Light lamps beside the door. For the seven generations of ancestors, light seven lamps before the hall; in the quiet chamber, keep one lamp always lit; and place two lamps beside the door. Where talismans are affixed to the door and gate, spirits and demons strike at people—how could they not enter through the door? The Six Divisions of Heavenly Envoys constantly descend to patrol the world, observing the good and evil of humanity. When spirits and demons see the talismans and lamps, they say, ‘This is the gate of a virtuous person—we cannot act wantonly here.’ Thus, distinctions are made, and the living and dead receive their due blessings."*

For the sun, moon, stars, constellations, the patient’s year of fate, and their natal destiny, each is honored with a lamp. During the fast, incense is burned and repentance offered at dawn, noon, and dusk—three times daily—with wholehearted devotion to receiving the profound mysteries of the scriptures and the Dharma. The turning of scriptures and expounding of the Dharma mirror the teachings of the ancient Perfected Ones. The sages transmitted these scriptures to instruct later generations, that the unheard might hear and the unknowing might know. Through this Dharma-bridge, all beings are universally delivered.

During the performance of the Dao, no idle chatter or discussion of worldly affairs is permitted. One may only inquire of the Dharma-master regarding the meaning of the scriptures and precepts, and the master shall elucidate the true essentials. If one maintains inner and outer composure and reverently receives even a single sentence of the scriptures, the Registrar of Destiny adds ten years to their lifespan. But if one is restless within and without and disparages even a single sentence, the Registrar deducts ten years. Thus, the Perfected Ones do not speak idly; their words always strike the mark. Their words establish the Dharma, for it is people who uphold the Dao, not the Dao that upholds people. This is the meaning.

The Immortal Duke says: *"The Great Fast, when combined with the Cavern Realms, enables the seven generations of ancestors to escape hell and ascend to heaven. If a participant in the fast engages in frivolous speech or vulgar discourse, they shall be penalized with one *jin* of incense, five *sheng* of oil, and three *liang* of cinnabar. These are to be offered to the host of the fast and distributed to the people, then used for public purposes. The fast is the foundation of seeking the Dao—none achieve it without this practice. Its merit is towering, beyond compare. Above, it leads to immortality and the attainment of the Dao; in the middle, it brings peace to the nation, prolongs life, and secures blessings and prosperity, attaining the Dao of non-action; below, it eradicates past sins, absolves present transgressions, rescues those in peril, dispels disasters, cures illnesses, liberates the dead from suffering, and delivers all beings—nothing is beyond its efficacy. After a thousand days of practicing the Dao with a heart devoted to the mysterious, one will surely summon Perfected Ones, behold the sacred, and attain the Dao."*

Day and night, bow six times in the six periods; in three of these, expound the scriptures, and in the other three, meditate on the gods within the body.

The Perfected One of the Great Ultimate says: *"When a worthy person suffers misfortune or illness, Daoist priests should establish a Numinous Treasure fast, turn the scriptures, burn incense, repent of sins, and pray for longevity, with the duration determined by their intent. The host must devote themselves wholeheartedly, both inwardly and outwardly, in faith and reverence, offering the master a modest amount of incense, oil, cinnabar, and paper as tokens of utmost sincerity, demonstrating their unwavering commitment. If the person is frivolous and superficial, this great Dharma must not be recklessly performed. The great Dharma is subtle and profound—it is not the domain of the shallow. Only those with a deep love for the refined, an affinity for the mysterious, and a reverence for the profound can truly uphold it."*

The Perfected One of the Great Ultimate says: *"During the Numinous Treasure fast, the Most High Perfected Ones, the Great Sages of the Ten Directions, the Heavenly Emperors and Kings, and the flying immortals—numbering in the thousands of millions, beyond count—arrive with a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders. Their jeweled canopies gleam resplendently; flying flowers scatter like snow; incense smoke drifts like clouds; the ten sacred banners flutter in the wind; their harmonious songs and whistles fill the air; phoenixes sing in unison; ten thousand dragons draw their chariots, soaring through the sky in grand procession. They come to witness and listen to the performance of the Dao."*

The heavens and humans rejoice, ghosts and spirits praise its goodness, demon kings clasp their hands in reverence, delighting in the great Dharma. The myriad sages of the Three Realms and the Great Thousand Worlds together sigh in admiration. The spirits guarding every place stand watch at the gates, all protecting the practitioner—none dare act with malice or defiance.

When reciting the scriptural verses, all must wholeheartedly exclaim, *"Excellent! Excellent!"* The demon kings shall issue proclamations, saying: *"These virtuous and worthy Daoists of non-action possess towering merit, revered by the Great Sages. We must each protect them, erasing their names from the registers of death under the Three Officials of Mount Tai. Thus shall they ascend to heaven in broad daylight, their seven generations of ancestors receive blessings, return to the celestial halls as reborn spirits, and their own bodies forever preserve the steadfast blessings of kalpas."*

The Perfected One of the Great Ultimate says: *"Kings and nobles enjoy their wealth and nobility due to the accumulated blessings of past lives, their talents and wisdom refined, their merit and virtue fulfilled. Only then do they come to favor the Dao—this is because their past transgressions have been exhausted. When past transgressions are exhausted, such a person will naturally devote themselves to fasting and abstinence, studying the great scriptures and great Dharma, and thus draw near to immortality. If they cultivate the precepts without negligence, they shall attain the rank of Upper Immortal. Daoists who delight in fasting are all those whose past transgressions have been exhausted. If past transgressions remain unexhausted, they will ultimately have no affinity for it. Such a one remains far from the sages and immortals. Those who study the Dao of immortality seek long life and enduring vision, to enjoy boundless kalpas, secure their ancestral temples, prosper their clans, deliver their seven generations of parents from suffering and peril, ascend to the celestial halls, and in later generations produce wise and enlightened descendants—let them receive the true texts of the Numinous Treasure. By practicing this fast, they shall attain this great blessing. The greatest blessing is to deliver others first; thus, one puts others before oneself, forgets both dependence and opposition, and forgets even what is to be forgotten, aligning one’s will with the mysterious. The superior person, upon hearing the Dao, diligently practices it; the middling person wavers between belief and doubt; the inferior person laughs at the Dao."*

The Perfected One of the Great Ultimate says: *"To move heaven and earth, summon the host of spirits, penetrate the Dao of immortality, fathom the utmost truth, dissolve the sins of past lives, dispel misfortune, repel vengeful foes, cultivate abundant virtue, cure illnesses, and aid all beings—nothing is closer than the practice of fasting in stillness and reciting the scriptures. We have heard of such words in ancient times, yet rarely see such people today."*

The Perfected One of the Great Ultimate says: *"Those worthy ones who wish to cultivate the great Dharma of non-action may recite this scripture, as well as the transmitted texts of the various Perfected Ones—all are excellent. Yet the *Five Thousand Character Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue* is the supreme, unsurpassed, and perfectly true great scripture. It encompasses the vast without omission and penetrates the minute without exception—it is the great foundation of the Dao and its virtue. Surveying all those Perfected Ones who have attained the Dao, none have not studied the *Five Thousand Character Scripture*. Yin Xi, Song Xian, and their like are examples. This is what is called the scripture of the Great Vehicle. Furthermore, the *Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Great Cavern True Scripture* must not be recited among ordinary people. The reason is that it is the scripture of the subtle ascent of the true Dao. When it is chanted, the Heavenly Emperors and Kings descend to welcome the practitioner, scattering incense and flowers; the officials and attendants of the Six Heavenly Demon Kings rejoice and come to bow in submission, ready to serve. The spirits of mountains and seas will all be at one’s command. Even a single verse chanted invokes the heavens to perform rites—how much more so for ghosts and spirits! Thus, it must not be recklessly practiced among ordinary people."*

The Numinous Treasure scriptures are the supreme scriptures of the Daoist tradition, the mysterious foundation of the Great Vehicle, possessing ranks of reverence both high and low. The Perfected Ones of the Ten Directions who have attained the Dao constantly perform rites before them, burning incense and scattering flowers—this is the root and truth of all Daoist practices. When Daoists revere the Numinous Treasure, prostrating in fasting and abstinence, and cultivate it according to the methods, all shall attain the Dao—how could it be otherwise? If this scripture cannot lead one toward long life, ascension as an immortal, and deliverance from the world, then there are no immortals under heaven and earth. The key lies in extinguishing external distractions and inwardly focusing on the mysterious truth—only then can one soar beyond the Milky Way and preserve long life.

The *Five Thousand Character Scripture* gathers and harmonizes the myriad wonders, its great return being equal to all others—yet it surpasses all worldly practices. All fasting methods ultimately trace their origin to the fundamental fast of the Numinous Treasure.

The Immortal Duke says: *"This great fast is the path of the Upper Immortals, by which the seven generations of ancestors are released from the nets of karma, ascend to the Great Mystery Palace, and the practitioner’s body first obtains the Five Mushrooms resembling hibiscus. The Five Mushrooms also grow naturally."*

The Perfected One of the Great Ultimate says: *"The *Five Thousand Character Scripture* follows the transmission protocols of the immortals, originally sharing the same requirements as the Numinous Treasure. For those of exceptional talent and aspiration who seek the Dao of spontaneous flight as an immortal, they must prepare the ritual offerings: five thousand feet of silk and written pledges, presented simultaneously with the Numinous Treasure scriptures. They shall receive them atop a named mountain peak. The master stands facing south, the disciple facing north, bowing three times. Each breaks a gold ring in half, wearing one piece while receiving the scriptures. Afterward, the disciple bows once more, beginning from the north and circumambulating the ten directions. When reciting the scriptures, one must first bow to the ten directions—this is the method. It is an ancient protocol of the Great Mystery Capital. You must now clearly understand it and transmit it to worthy descendants in later generations according to the method. The oral instructions of the Most High should be kept secret. You should constantly contemplate the Void-and-None Perfected One, the Supreme Great Dharma King, the Worthy One of the Great Thousand Vehicles, known in the world as Laozi. Laozi is the great Dharma master within the mysterious. With the eye of the Dao, he observes the good and evil of all heavenly beings. You must propagate this Dao, and you shall surely become a flying immortal. On the day you attain the wondrous, you will know that this scripture is not false. Resplendent are the writings of the Cavernous Silence—here lies the essence of the Great Dao."*

The Immortal Duke says: *"In the world, those of lofty virtue who wish to recite the scriptures in pursuit of ascension as immortals should receive the Numinous Treasure and the *Five Thousand Character Scripture* simultaneously. The ritual offerings are the pledges of devotion to the scriptures. Thus it is said: 'Without leaving one’s door or window, one may know the Dao of heaven'—this is what it means. Such people will be rare in the world. Those who wish to discourse on emptiness and transcendence, holding themselves above their age, need not follow this method of transmission. The Perfected Ones teach only to those who seek immortality. Daoists who study these texts to attain immortality yet do not receive them from a master will find the Dao unfulfilled."*

The Perfected of the Great Ultimate says: *"The Perfected embody the Dao in emptiness and nothingness, fearing nothing. The defilements of the mundane world concern only the sages, who grieve for the souls and spirits of the people. When one encounters filth and impurity without bathing in fragrant waters, illness and harm befall them—this is to teach the people the distinction between purity and pollution. The way of ghosts and spirits is doubly prone to defilement; when defiled, their power ceases. Even gold cannot withstand corruption and decay—how much less the supreme Dao? The great methods and true Dao are inherently free from defilement."*

The Perfected of the Great Ultimate says: *"When people encounter defilement, regardless of its magnitude, they should immediately perform the rite of release. Afterward, they must burn incense and perform the Dao-circuits, with no fixed time limit."*

The Perfected of the Great Ultimate says: *"The meals offered to the worthy and the blessings of the feast have their allotted numbers. Visiting guests should also partake first. When the Perfected of Orthodox Unity, the Three Heavens’ Dharma Master, was about to ascend to heaven, he saw the people impoverished and suffering, so he reduced the number of offerings, sometimes preparing meals for ten. If more than ten guests arrived unexpectedly, there would be nothing to offer them. If the feast were not fully shared, even one person left unserved would mean the blessing was not universal. Thus, the ritual was established so that once all matters were complete, the remaining food would be distributed to all people and beings, thereby praying for the host’s fortune. Later generations, unaware of this, are now instructed in it. Wine should not be entirely forbidden but regulated in quantity, adjusted according to the number of people, without enforcing strict limits. As the worldly teaching says: ‘Only with wine is there no measure—yet it must not lead to disorder.’ Excessive wine muddles the upright qi and drives the Three Perfected from their palaces; thus, one must not overindulge, and officials should examine this—prudence is essential."*

The Perfected of the Great Ultimate says: *"There are those who do not study the Dao. When they hear Daoists discourse on the profound and abstruse meanings of the supreme scriptures—vast and far-reaching principles—they do not believe or apply them. Instead, they slander the sacred texts as false and absurd, dismissing the scriptural teachings as mere fabrication, unworthy of study. Having no faith themselves, they envy others who study the scriptures and the methods of nurturing life, claiming all of it to be untrue. Such people, in their past lives, formed no karmic ties with the immortals and sages, nor did they cultivate connections with the worthy. In this life, they lack great wisdom and thus cannot partake in the profound resonance of the sages. They reject the teachings of the supreme Dao and scriptures, preferring to study the arts of shamans and miscellaneous, inauthentic texts. When they gather, they prioritize wine and meat, their words contradicting their hearts. They deceive and attack one another, indulging in lust and desire, following their whims without restraint, insatiable in their cravings. Some even take on the role of teachers, yet harbor no intention of teaching goodness. They bully the weak, constantly seeking to indulge their cruel impulses. Their minds are filled with greed, jealousy, slander, harm, lewdness, theft, deceit, and treachery—violent, perverse, and rebellious. Such people embody the ten evils in their conduct. How can one know that such individuals, despite their actions, do not fall into the net of retribution and live in apparent peace? There are others who have never transgressed the law, always following the scriptural teachings, yet suffer hardship and distress. When a person dies, their body decays, but their soul and spirit endure, facing consequences based on the good and evil of their past deeds. Thus, when people commit evil, act perversely, or even murder their rulers or fathers—heinous and unparalleled crimes—yet do not immediately face judgment, it is because they are still drawing on the blessings of past lives. When those blessings are exhausted, their sins will arrive. In life, they may be punished by the authorities; in death, they enter hell, enduring unspeakable torments. If good people do not see their rewards in this life, it is because their past sins are not yet exhausted. Once they are, blessings will come: they may achieve high status in this life, be reborn into the families of kings or nobles, ascend to heaven, or become spirits. Evil follows evil, and good follows good—this is the root of destiny. Those who study the Dao should understand this. If one studies the Dao until death yet fails to attain it, it is because their merit and virtue are incomplete, and their past karmic ties are weak. There is no one in later generations who does not rely on this merit to achieve immortality and transcendence. If one studies the Dao for several years and then expects to ascend as an immortal, yet falters midway, grows lazy, or succumbs to worldly desires, they will revert to the common flow. Their body will perish, their name will fade, and they will be trapped in the cycle of death, enduring endless suffering. They may lose their human form, departing from the human realm without hope of return. Some are born with innate intelligence yet do not teach or transform others, leaving later generations ignorant and foolish. Even slaves and servants have no fixed nature—they are repaying debts from past lives when they deceived and took from others, now serving as labor to compensate. The six livestock are repaid with their flesh. When people do not believe in the Daoist scriptures, doubting the true teachings, they will suffer these cruel fates—how tragic! If a Daoist encounters evil while practicing goodness, yet endures with patience and steadfastness, upholding these precepts and laws, they will preserve their present merit. To remain steadfast in adversity without transgressing the Dao—this is the mark of a Daoist. In life and death, they will dwell in the households of kings and nobles. If you attain the Dao in this way, you will naturally perceive the roots of your past lives. It is because you practiced great generosity and studied the Dao tirelessly in former lives that you now achieve immortality."*

The Perfected Lord of the Left says: *"Strive diligently, for there has never been one who attained immortality without study. The key to studying immortality lies in exhausting the heart-mind. If the heart-mind is not exhausted, that is why one studies yet fails to attain. The sages do not deceive."*

The Perfected of the Great Ultimate says: *"Those who serve as Libationers must uphold the One Hundred and Eighty Great Precepts of Lord Lao. Only then can they be called Libationers. Thus, it is said: ‘Without receiving the great precepts, one may not accept the bows of the people or disciples.’ Those who receive these precepts must hold them in their hearts and practice them—only then do they become Libationers. Libationers must sever distracting thoughts, abandon all evils, and diligently practice the precepts. Such is the way. The wondrous Dao of the Yellow and the Old is the method for examining the seeds of humanity. Among ten thousand, perhaps one or two are genuine."*

The Perfected of the Great Ultimate says: *"If a scholar can cast aside worldly burdens and aspire to wander among mountains and rivers, upholding the Dharma-wheel of the Supreme Ultimate, they may be called a Master. They should sit upon a high seat to recite the scriptures, teaching and transforming the foolish and the wise, guiding and delivering all who seek to learn."*

Should one’s natal sign be yín or mǎo, belonging to the two celestial stems of the East, they shall be called Master of the Eastern Marchmount. The other three directions follow this precedent. Those born under chén-xū or chǒu-wèi shall be called Master of the Central Marchmount. If one further possesses pure perfection and utmost virtue, and can penetrate the mysteries of the profound, their disciples and fellow students may address them as Such-and-Such Master. If one delves deeply and reaches far, their talent and learning profound and penetrating, their aspiration fixed upon the Great Vehicle, they shall be called Master of the Profound, or Master of Wandering the Profound, or Master of Far Wandering, or Master of Propagating the Dao, or Master of Expounding the Profound. Such titles are but brief examples and cannot be exhaustively listed. When the world produces such a person, scholars shall address them accordingly. The general principle is thus.

To speak of the name "Upper Clarity" requires seven days of pure fasting. The rank of Master is weighty and must not be claimed lightly; ghosts and spirits will not acknowledge one who does so, for Heaven examines all people. The Master is a Daoist. One who studies the Dao of immortality and achieves it is called a Perfected. One who embodies the great Dharma of the Dao is called a Perfected.

The Perfected of the Great Ultimate says: *"Those who observe the world as Daoists are rare—those who desire to fast, recite scriptures, seek enlightened teachers to receive and study them, inquire into the principles, and faithfully practice them. Most are frivolous and shallow, their hearts attached to sensual pleasures, their aspirations lacking in true refinement, fond of studying the lesser vehicles. Even if one person desires to fast and study the Dao, there is often no enlightened teacher to encourage and guide them. Though their aspiration lies in the Dao of immortality, seeking to deliver all people, people instead ridicule them, saying: ‘Such useless pursuits! I have never seen many study this way. The scriptures are full of empty and deceptive words. It is not as good as our methods, which can dispel calamities and disperse misfortunes.’ The deaf do not hear the music of Sháo and Wǔ; the blind do not see black and white. How can they claim their own affliction is not a malady? Thus the great Dao is not practiced, the true Dharma does not flourish, the authentic scriptures lie dormant, and perverse and heretical teachings daily increase. Each claims to be a Lady of the Three Palaces, and chaos of demonic delusion arises. The people abandon the true and pursue the false. All this stems from teachers who do not diligently study and thus fail to encourage their disciples to learn the orthodox scriptures and the orthodox Dharma. If the true and orthodox reside in one’s heart, demonic influences will be far removed. Without knowing the great meaning of the supreme scriptures, there is no way to restrain one’s heart. Demonic and ghostly qi enter the heart and stir it to action, leading the mind to every kind of excess. It is like embracing a stone to cross a great river—how could it not be so?"*

The Perfected of the Great Ultimate says: *"Zhuāng Zhōu was the Celestial Immortal Nán Huá of the Supreme. In a former life, when he studied the Dao, he vowed: ‘When I attain the Dao and achieve immortality, my talent and wisdom shall be penetrating and far-reaching. I shall appear in the world among people to expound the* Dàodéjīng *of five thousand characters and propagate the meaning of the Dao.’ Huìzǐ was his disciple, who at that time also said: ‘If the Master attains the Dao and gains freedom in action and stillness, this disciple wishes to attend and follow, to chant and praise the subtle words, to penetrate the profound essence, to gaze deeply into the source of the Dao, and to unravel the snares of the world. I shall examine the competitive and ostentatious hearts of worldly people and guide them with the gateway of naturalness.’ Thus, ‘profound and yet again profound’ is the gateway to all wonders. Later, both achieved their vows, and their writings all conveyed the meaning of the Dao. Yet people today do not know they were Perfected Immortals. They take Zhuāngzǐ’s works as mere allegories. The Great Peng, the Great Tree, and the Dark Spirit are all records of actual things, not empty fabrications. Where things are vast, such great beings arise. In the present day, in the gardens of Làng, on Kūnlún, in Pénglái, and in the Northern Sea, such divine creatures all exist. Where things are small, small beings arise. If one insists that only what the eye sees is real and what it does not see is nonexistent, then much of what exists in the world would be denied. In the parables of Daoist scriptures, when speaking of the vastness of kalpas, there is a stone as large as Mount Kūnlún and a mustard seed within a forty-*lǐ* expanse. Heavenly beings in gauze robes brush this stone once every hundred years, and when the stone is worn away, it is like the end of a kalpa. Who could believe in such vast durations?*

*The* Língbǎo Sūtras *are the root of all scriptures, difficult to express in words. The five thousand characters of the* Dàodéjīng *are subtle and wondrous, and the great meaning of all scriptures ultimately returns to one. The thirty-nine chapters of the* Dòngzhēn *are spoken by thirty-nine Perfected. They are the scriptures of non-birth. These Perfected transmitted them forth. Their virtue, power, and true qi blend and transform naturally into Perfected, peers of Lǎozǐ. They have traversed endless kalpas, not as those who merely study the Dao. Unless one has accumulated profound merit and virtue from past lives, one who obtains the* Dòngzhēn *scriptures cannot comprehend their meaning. What they describe are the natural palaces of the Three Supreme Heavens and the myriad things of mountains and rivers. Though the names of these mountains, rivers, and things may coincide with those of the world, they are not the mountains, rivers, and things of this world. They are all natural entities, audible but difficult to distinguish. The* Dòngzhēn Yùqīng Sūtra *briefly explains their meaning, but cannot exhaust the details—how could they be grasped by mere thought? Those who uphold them gain great fortune, attain longevity, and ensure the peace of their ancestral temples. Those who recite them become kings among Perfected, for their Dao is supreme. In the past, those who attained the Dao of the highest immortality and utmost Perfection all upheld the* Língbǎo Sūtras. *The Three Heavens call them immortals; the Brahmā Heaven calls them Daoists. Heaven and Earth have their ends and beginnings, thus there are great and small kalpas, and all scriptures perish with them. Later sages will produce new Dharmas, but only the five thousand characters of the* Dàodéjīng*, the* Dòngzhēn *scriptures, and the* Língbǎo *are imperishable and endless, transmitted without end. Thus they are called the scriptures of non-birth, the kings of all scriptures. Therefore, those who teach and transform in each generation to achieve the Dao of immortality do not know their source in past lives. Vast and majestic, they are not seen by ghosts and spirits. Only the great demon kings of the Six Heavens come to honor the scripture masters, while the celestial officials of the Three Supreme Heavens oversee and inspect them. This is not something lesser immortals can hear of; only the Perfected can study it. Yet people today do not know that Daoists are immortals, and say that immortals are not Daoists—all because their karmic conditions from past lives are not yet exhausted."*

When one’s karmic conditions are exhausted, one naturally attains profound understanding and great wisdom, clearly perceiving all—this is knowing, and knowing is attaining the Dao. The *Five Thousand Characters* is most difficult to comprehend, yet those who know it know it fully. Thus it is said: one must grasp the supreme great wisdom.

The Perfected of the Great Ultimate says: In establishing the *Língbǎo* fast, those of lofty virtue and profound understanding of the scriptures’ meaning are appointed as Dharma Masters. Next are those of keen intelligence and penetrating insight, able to fathom the subtle principles and comprehend the precepts—they serve as Chief Reciters. Then come the Fast Overseers, who correct and penalize improper conduct. Following them are the Scripture Attendants, Incense Attendants, and Lamp Attendants, each with their designated seating. Those who first receive this scripture hold the highest rank; those who receive it later hold a lower one. If one person in a household receives the scripture, others in the family who wish to observe the fast may do so. If at any time a Yellow-Red Grand Unity Libationer, fond of witnessing the fast’s rites, wishes to attend, they may observe the great Dharma transformation—but may not sit on the same platform. Even those of the utmost virtue, renowned in the world, must take their place behind, following the order of their register’s rank. The same applies to the burning of incense. The reason for this is that such individuals have subtle karmic affinities from past lives, and thus are now permitted to participate.

The Perfected of the Great Ultimate says: During the fast, one’s heart must be fixed on the mysterious and true, with no extraneous thoughts. Direct your thoughts to the Dharma Master, first envisioning the Three Ones residing in their palaces, settled in clarity, with the three *hún* and seven *pò* fully present, and the Grand Unity stationed in the *níwán* within the head, as in the *Huífēng Dìyī* method. Then, together with the initiate, observe the fast and listen to the scripture, receiving it with the mouth while contemplating it with the heart. Thus the Three Corpses flee, perverse *qi* is extinguished, and one receives the true both internally and externally—such is nearness to immortality. Additionally, practice exhalation and inhalation, guide and harmonize the fluids, and cultivate all the sublime Daoist arts. Then the celestial perfected will surely descend upon you. The superior adept attains the Dao within the chamber. Even if dwelling in mountain caves, if the slightest extraneous thought persists, one’s efforts are in vain, labor and strength wasted. In learning the Dao, only the heart’s exhaustion matters—when the heart is exhausted, the immortals will immediately observe and test you. You would do well to examine this carefully.

The Perfected of the Great Ultimate says: If a Daoist retreats far from human traces, dwelling in seclusion on a famous mountain, observing a perpetual fast and residing alone in a secluded valley, there is no need to select a Dharma Master—only the heart and mouth converse. For those observing the fast in the world, Daoists who consume the five grains may simply abstain from other foods; if taking medicinal substances, they should do so precisely at noon. After noon, they may drink clear liquids but abstain from solid food. At dawn, they may take congee, and at midday, vegetable fare. When the fast’s term concludes, the breaking of the fast should resemble the preparation of a grand feast, with utmost purity. Seasonal fruits should be offered first, accompanied by incense and prayers, wishing the fast’s sponsor to ascend as an immortal and transcend the world.

The Perfected of the Great Ultimate says: The way of the fast entails constantly cultivating ten virtuous thoughts:
First, for the Dao, contemplate the four great elements, so that the seven generations of one’s parents may be freed from suffering, ascend to the celestial halls, and enjoy natural sustenance.
Second, contemplate the flourishing of the Dao’s transformation under the emperor and rulers, with schools thriving, imperial teachings vast, and majestic rites resplendent, admired by all under heaven. May the people praise great peace, the six barbarians submit, evil daily diminish, and sages daily increase.
Third, contemplate the Dharma Master’s great merit, that their teachings may be luminous and all attain flying immortality.
Fourth, contemplate fellow learners of the Dao, that they may swiftly attain immortality and mutually guide one another.
Fifth, contemplate harmonious kinship, esteeming benevolence and righteousness, valuing the Dao and despising wealth, serving as models for all.
Sixth, contemplate selflessly bestowing alms upon Daoists and the hungry and cold, so that all people under heaven may find their rightful place.
Seventh, contemplate all crawling and creeping beings, that all sentient life may attain fulfillment.
Eighth, contemplate repenting and making amends for the transgressions of past and present lives, establishing merit to compensate for faults.
Ninth, contemplate the prosperity of the family line, with ancestral temples maintained and worthy descendants born in every generation.
Tenth, contemplate reverently receiving the master’s scripture without negligence, maintaining equanimity and single-mindedness to broadly deliver all beings. May my own body ascend as an immortal, ascend to heaven in broad daylight, pay homage to the Most High, eternally become a Perfected, partake of the five-colored numinous fluid, and merge with the Dao.

Master Zhèng says: When ascending the mountain to receive the scripture, there is no need to present a memorial—simply make an oral petition. The ode states:
The Dao takes the fast as foremost,
Diligently practiced, one ascends the golden towers.
Thus is the great Dharma bridge established,
Universally delivering all beings.
Repaying the kindness of past lives,
The heart of the Dao arises transcendent.
The body soars to the Mysterious Capital,
And the seven ancestors are all liberated.
Upon completion of the transmission, this text must be recited.

Master Zhèng of Nányuè says: My former master, the Immortal Lord, always kept this book secret, transmitting it only to the utmost Perfected—its value surpasses ten thousand gold. Immortals passed it down orally, and now it is recorded here. The Immortal Lord said: Copy one version to seal and return to a famous mountain, transmit one to a disciple, and entrust one to descendants in the family line, to be recorded and transmitted through generations by those who know the Dao. It should be transmitted together with the original *Língbǎo* scripture—this is the essential subtlety of the Daoist tradition.

Bàopǔzǐ says: My humble opinion is that for grand fasts lasting many days, whether for nobles or Daoists, those with inherently frail constitutions may find it difficult to perform the six daily periods of bowing. I suggest that during the day, at the three periods, one may burn incense and bow, while at night, it may be omitted—engaging instead in the recitation of Dharma teachings. Those capable of burning incense during all six periods should naturally uphold the full rite. But for those who have not yet attained the Dao and whose strength is weak, even observing the fast for a single day and night—practicing the Dao during the six periods—is sufficient. Learners would do well to consider and apply this carefully. When establishing the fast, one may eat dried jujubes and dried venison—these are raw and fresh foods, and no other offerings may be made. For those who are not mountain-dwelling Daoists but study the scriptures at home, how can they maintain a perpetual fast and prolonged contemplation? They should observe the fast as appropriate, for at least ten, nine, seven, three, or one day, practicing the Dao. Such merit is vast and universal, the supreme method of learning the Dao. The seven ancestors are freed from suffering, ascend to the halls of blessing—this may be called the way of utmost filial piety.

The utmost of filial piety and fraternal duty reaches the divine spirits, extending far to the seven mysteries—how could it be limited to one’s ancestors alone? Thus, the perfected immortals keep this secret. The Supreme Ultimate Perfected One expounded the essential precepts of the *Numinous Treasure* fasts, precepts, and ritual decorum across the various scriptures—here concludes the text.
