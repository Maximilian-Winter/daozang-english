Your humble servant, in profound submission, acknowledges:
That the **Dao encompassing Heaven and Earth (Fànwéi Tiāndì Dàodé)**
Is achieved through the **Three Qi (Sānqì)**, by which the **Primordial Essence (Húnníng)** is perfected.

The **Illuminating Chapter of the Clouded Han** unfolds from the Five Classics.
The **Supreme Yang** blazes forth, its **Boundless Virtue** profound and mysterious.

Its **Mysteries** transcend speech and thought,
Its **Manifest Power** partakes in the **Cosmic Transformation** of night.

Beholding the **origin of the Ritual of Abstinence and Offerings (Zhāojiào)**,
We first establish the **Great Offering (Jiào)**—
May our **sincere invocation** turn the **Heavenly Response (Huìtiān)**,

We **don the luminous robes**, gazing upward at the **two celestial lights (Liǎngyào)**,
