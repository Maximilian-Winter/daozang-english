**Source:** *Zhengtong Daozang* (Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era), *Tongxuan* (Cavernous Mystery) section, **Threats and Rituals** category.

**Ritual Proceedings:**
When the first offering is made, the Way is illuminated—its blessings unfold like the auspicious opening of the Rainbow Pool.
When the second and third offerings are presented, the radiance of the sun and moon extends to the Dragon Steps, where joyous celebration resounds.

**The Officials of the Court, [Name] and others, humbly unite with the Ritual Officers of the age, in sincere joy and reverence.**
We bow our heads and kneel, offering repeated obeisance, and present our petition to:
The **Celestial Sovereign of the Northern Pole, the Purple Micro Emperor of the Central Heaven’s Star Host**,
The **clustered celestial luminaries of sun, moon, and stars**,
The **Emperor’s Personal Star, the Commanding Star of His Native Hour**,
The **Southern Pole Elder, the Star Lord of Longevity and Virtue**,
The **Highest Clarity Star Lord of Auspicious Virtue**,
The **Highest Clarity Star Lord of Auspicious Power**,
The **Imperial Throne’s Illuminating Star Officials and the Supreme Celestial Worthies Who Bow Over the Hosts of the Circumambient Heavens**.

**With reverent devotion, we gaze upon the boundless benevolence,**
**piercing the depths of the Way’s profound mirror.**

We have heard that:
The **Primordial Beginning** first revealed the cosmic diagram,
**Dispersing the True Wind** across all existence;
The **Emptiness Sovereign** governed the celestial course,
**Flowing the Way’s Dew** over the ten directions.

Thus, all within the world take form beneath the heavens,
And the myriad realms obey the **Primordial Command**.

We, the subjects, in awe, observe that the **Emperor’s Majesty**,
**Reverently occupies the Supreme Pole**,
**Holds sway over the scales of all nations**;
**Nurtures the common folk**,
**Expands the domain of longevity** to the eight extremes.

The **harmonious *qi*** ascends and fills the celestial gate,
While **joyous voices** resonate throughout the earth.

Now, upon this sacred birthday,
We perform the **Primordial Beginning’s rites**,
**Consecrating the Golden Talisman**,
**Manifesting the Jade Platform’s realm**.

We bow our heads to the azure vault,
**Humbly emulating the Three Blessings of Hua Peak**,
**Returning our hearts to the Dao**,
And pray for the **Emperor’s endless years**.

We earnestly beseech the **Most High Sage** to bestow grace,
That the **Primordial Lord** may bestow felicitous blessings.

The **Black Dragon** rides the sun’s chariot,
**Accompanying the Jade and Pearl** in their celestial retinue;
The **Vermilion Phoenix** guards the imperial banner,
**Descending in green palanquins and crimson carriages**.

No supplication is neglected,
And all reverence is fulfilled.

We, the officials, **sincerely rejoice and offer homage**.
We bow our heads and kneel, offering repeated obeisance,
**Present incense and libations** for the first offering.
**The ritual proceedings commence with music.**

We have heard that great virtue originates from life,
And the **Most High’s** sovereign authority extends without limit.
Of the Five Blessings, the first is longevity—
The people’s deepest hopes are ever profound.

Thus, with sincere reverence, we humbly petition the **Heavenly Listener**,
That longevity may be granted through celestial favor.

We pray that Heaven’s discernment may be bestowed,
And that our devout supplications may be fulfilled.

Reflecting upon our humble selves,
We, though unworthy, inherit the **Orthodox Dao’s** lineage,
Yet fail to grasp the **Three Mysteries’** profundity.
In purity and stillness, we are ashamed of our many transgressions;
Our aspirations are faint and feeble—
Our words and thoughts fall far short.

Fortunate to witness this auspicious era,
We rejoice in drawing near to the **Pure Radiance**.
With reverence, we meet this pivotal moment,
And solemnly observe the **Primordial Lord’s** rites.

We humbly pray for the **Emperor’s** Majesty,
That one may bring blessings to all,
And ten thousand realms may know peace.
The blessings of fortune, rank, and longevity—
Like countless stars—
Shine resplendent upon the **Celestial Throne**;
The **Three Dynasties of Xia, Shang, and Zhou**
Harmonize in radiant splendor within the **Heavenly Court**.

May **Eternal Joy and Great Clarity** prevail,
And the realm of longevity be ever expanded.

We, the officials, **sincerely rejoice and offer homage**,
Bow our heads and kneel, offering repeated obeisance,
Present incense and libations for the **second offering**.
**The ritual proceedings continue with music.**

We have heard that the gaze and hearing descend from Heaven,
And the **Emperor’s** heart alone discerns the **Dao’s** simplicity.
The joyous acclamations stir the Earth,
As we pray for the **Sage’s** longevity to flow boundless.

At the convergence of **Yin-Yang’s** responsive moment,
And the union of **Heaven-Earth’s** harmonizing virtue,
We, your servants, with earnest devotion,
And utmost sincerity, fulfill our command.

The **Mysterious Rites** proceed in ordered succession,
As we pray for boundless blessings to descend upon the **Celestial Realm**.
May the **Way** endure without end,
And **virtue/power** extend to near and far.

The **Eight Nodes** and **Four Seasons** bring perpetual **qi** to the **Celestial Throne**,
While the **Three Celestial Stems** and **Six Heavenly Branches** align auspicious stars in cosmic balance.

May we extol the **State** with eternal years,
And spread the flourishing harmony of the **Four Quarters**.
The **Heavenly Sovereign’s** benevolence is vast and bright,
And the **Sage’s** radiance shines ever clear.

With loyal ministers in perfect accord,
Good governance spreads throughout the lands;
The people rejoice and dance,
Their praises echoing to the eldest and youngest alike.

The **Golden Branches** bear blessings,
And auspicious signs weave through the **Jade Calendar**.
We, your servants, **sincerely rejoice and offer homage**,
Bow our heads and kneel, offering repeated obeisance,
Present incense and libations for the **final offering**.

**The ritual proceedings continue with music.**
Recite the **Sutra of Pure Stillness**.
Submit the memorial.
Burn the incense offerings.

May we, with utmost reverence, now turn our hearts to the past and present,
And with profound sincerity, humbly present our words before the **Dao/Way**.

With earnest devotion, we lay out our offerings,
And with sincerity, we present the **Law** and its rites,
Ensuring all is complete and proper,
And offering the mundane ceremonial forms.

We pray that Your **Sagely Truth** may look upon us with favor,
And that Your **Divine Insight** may descend to discern our devotion.

May the **Celestial Pole** store auspicious omens,
And the **Purple Court** [of Heaven] increase its celestial calculations.

The **Grand Enterprise** stands mighty and enduring,
Through the **Divine and Mysterious** cooperation of **Yin** and **Yang**’s protective power.

The **Vast Benevolence** flows unbound,
So that the people may fully enjoy the **Harmony and Prosperity**.

May the winds and rains be in perfect accord,
And the land and heavens endure eternally.

Once more, we rely upon the **Dao/Way’s** power,
With devoted hearts, we invoke and chant:
**"The **Eternal Life Sovereign** of the **Mysterious Capital**."

**Inconceivable merits and virtues** be bestowed.

All kneel and extol with threefold acclamation.

The rites conclude.
The **Golden Talisman** is presented for the **Threefold Longevity Offerings**.
The ceremonial proceedings are complete.
