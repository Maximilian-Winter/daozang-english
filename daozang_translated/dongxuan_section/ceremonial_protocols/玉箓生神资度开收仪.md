**Jade Register Ritual for Generating Spirits, Bestowing Salvation, Opening, and Gathering**

**Morning Audience**

**Attending the Scripture – Invocation**

We humbly invoke the Primordial Origin of the Mysterious qi, which governs the Three Treasures and inscribes the Dragon Script; the True Ancestor of the Dao and virtue, which illumines the Nine Heavens and forms the Phoenix Seal. The wondrous meanings of the *Dongzhen*, *Dongxuan*, and *Dongshen* [scriptures]; the numinous texts of the *Tai Xuan*, *Tai Ping*, and *Tai Qing*. In all, eighteen thousand chapters, concealed within thirty-six divisions. Some refined into gold to form characters, some kneaded from jade to compose script. Mysterious beyond mystery, quiescent beyond quiescence.

As the Eight Venerables of hoary heads could not discern the separation of heaven and earth in their time, nor could the Nine Elders of white brows fathom the division of the cosmos thereafter. Boundless and infinite, now sinking, now floating, now square, now round, now hidden, now manifest. Void and still, yet not existing; fleeting and indistinct, as if nonbeing.

Thus, when the *Celestial Treasure* is recited, it opens the radiance of heaven and earth; when the *Numinous Treasure* is recited, it delivers the souls of the Nine Dark Realms from eternal night. When the *Spirit Treasure* is recited, it subdues spirits; when the *Taiyi* is recited, it shapes forms; when the *Nine Heavens* is recited, it generates gods and ghosts. Spirits hear it and ascend; mortals hear it and endure; suffering souls hear it and attain deliverance; withered ashes hear it and emit smoke; infants hear it and speak; the dead hear it and return to life.

As for the divine mysteries of the Three Treasures and the myriad roots of the profound, they are concealed within jade tablets and not transmitted until gold and treasures are offered. Praise cannot exhaust them; their merit and virtue are boundless.

Now, in reverent compliance with the imperial decree, we solemnly perform the *Great Fast of the Jade Register*, elevating and recommending the spirit of [Name], ascending to purity and stillness. We further contemplate the multitude of solitary, suffering souls in the dharma-realm, unable to honor their qi, esteem their forms, cherish their spirits, or preserve their lives. They brought ruin upon themselves, severed from their original truth. Once departed, they wander in darkness, their souls drifting without return. Gathered in flight through the void, their former clarity is mostly lost. Ignorant of the way of life and transformation, they inevitably fall into the depths of suffering.

Today, we solemnly array the ritual assembly and reverently initiate the immortal rites. Precious incense perfumes the Nine Heavens; the torch of wisdom illumines the Ten Lands. Through this supreme goodness, we mourn the departed spirits.

We humbly beseech the Golden Palace to extend its grace, the Jade Clarity to bestow its benevolent command. Refine the souls in the Palace of Lesser Yin, restore the spirits to the Courtyard of Flowing Fire. Relying upon the scripture of the Nine Crossings, ascend directly to the realm of the Three Heavens.

The assembly, with sincere devotion, prostrates in reverence.

**Three Refuges**
**Hymn of Past Lives**
**Attending the Scripture – Opening the Scripture**

*Invocation*

As the scripture turns through its first recitation, its voice pierces the Nine Heavens; as the decree traverses the Three Paths, the soul is no longer bound to the Ten Lands. Today, upon ascending the altar for the first crossing, we intone the *Jade Chapters of the Nine Heavens for Generating the Divine*. We dedicate this merit to the Emperor of the Infinite Heaven of Yudu, praying for the grace to elevate the spirit of [Name], that they may ascend to the immortal realm, and extending this blessing to all forsaken and lost beings throughout the Dharma realms.

May they awaken to the illusory and false nature of their former existence, attaining perfect clarity in the One Truth; may they untangle the karmic bonds of past lives, with all transgressions dissolved and eradicated. The long night yields to purity, and the spirit-soul undergoes refinement. May they never enter the prison of wind and thunder, spared the torment of flying spears and drifting halberds; may they be reborn in the primordial womb of life, attaining the fruit of refining qi and achieving immortality. Freed from all obstructions, they shall roam in boundless ease.

We bow our heads to the August Void, cultivating the scripture’s Dharma.

**Hymn of the Dharma Seat**
*Silent contemplation in accordance with the rites*
In profound stillness, reaching the ultimate source—
For kalpas unending, they shall dwell as immortals.

**The Master Inscribes the Scripture**
**The Assembly Completes the Recitation**
**Hymn of Rising from the Seat**

**Attending the Scripture – Dedication of Merit**
We look up in reverence to the Three Sublime Realms and the Nine Heavens’ exalted sages. Turning our compassionate intent below, we beseech that they bestow their witness and alliance. We, your servants, have now completed one recitation of the precious scripture. Relying upon its Dharma, we elevate the spirit of [Name], guiding them to ascend to the realm of purity, and extending this merit to all forsaken and lost beings throughout the Dharma realms, that they may transcend the depths of darkness and ascend to the Dao’s domain. May all beings universally partake in this goodness and blessing.

We bow our heads in devotion and proceed with hymns of praise.

**Celestial Procession**
*Circumambulation with incense*

**Master’s Proclamation of the Text – Declaration of Petitions or Talismans**

The attendant scripture now proclaimed, the second recitation begins:
*One chant, and the myriad Perfected respond in harmony—*
First, we extend our sincerest devotion in recitation and praise.
*Twice recited, and Heaven and Earth commune—*
Again, we perform the rites of exaltation and hymnody.

On this day, ascending the altar for the second recitation, we turn to intone the *Jade Chapters of the Nine Heavens’ Life-Generating Spirit*. In dedication, we direct this merit to the Most Sublime Meditative Virtue, the Boundless-Longevity Heavenly Emperor, beseeching grace to elevate and recommend [Name]’s spirit, guiding them to ascend to the immortal realms, and extending this to all forsaken and lost beings throughout the Dharma realms. May all who hear this scripture awaken to the Dao, their transgressions absolved and karmic entanglements dissolved.

From the Eastern Palace, may the grace of deliverance from suffering be bestowed;
From the Northern Bureau, may the characters of rebirth be inscribed.
Spared from the Brazen-Pillar Hell, they shall not clasp their hands in despair but ascend with ease.
Reborn in the primordial essence of life, may their spirit be whole and their qi gathered.
Transcending to the Dao’s domain, may they be transformed and dwell among humans and devas.

We bow our heads in reverence to the August Void, cultivating the scripture’s Dharma.

**Rising from the Seat – Hymn**

**Attending the Scripture – Dedication of Merit**
We look up in reverence to the Three Sublime Realms and the Nine Heavens’ exalted sages. Turning our compassionate intent below, we beseech that they bestow their witness and alliance. We, your servants, have now completed two recitations of the precious scripture. Relying upon its Dharma, we elevate the spirit of [Name], guiding them to ascend to the immortal realms, and extending this merit to all forsaken and lost beings throughout the Dharma realms, that they may emerge from the depths of darkness and transcend to the Dao’s domain. May all beings universally partake in this excellence and blessing.

The Dharma assembly proceeds according to ritual, circumambulating in hymns of praise.

**Celestial Procession**
*Circumambulation with incense*

**Master’s Proclamation of the Text**
Proclamation of the memorial or talisman, announcement of the petition, burning and offering—now that the scripture’s recitation has been opened, the third recitation of the precious canon is complete. The divine soul has received deliverance, at once plucked from the Nine Dark Realms.

On this third ascent to the altar, we turn and chant the *Nine Heavens’ Jade Scripture of Life-Generating Spirit*. We dedicate this merit to the Heavenly Emperor of the Vast Extension, praying for the elevation and advancement of [Name]’s soul to the immortal realms, extending this grace below to all forsaken and lost beings throughout the Dharma realms.

May the sea of desire settle its waves, may the river of attachment still its currents. The sins of accumulated lifetimes’ cultivation shall from this moment dissolve; the errors of many births’ past misdeeds shall henceforth be released. Let them not enter the fire-obscuring hells, where heat and torment are transformed into cool clarity. Let the soul’s original mandate be reborn, attaining carefree ease without hindrance. Merging with the empty and cavernous *qi*, may they rejoice before the Most High.

We bow our heads in reverence to the Void Sovereign, practicing the scripture’s Dharma.

*Seating the Altar – Hymn of Praise*
*Invitation to Turn the Dharma Wheel*
*Master Intoning the Scripture*

We look up in reverence to the Three Sublime Realms and the Nine Heavens’ exalted sages. Turning our compassionate intent below, we beseech that they bestow their witness and alliance. We have now completed three recitations of the precious scripture. Relying upon its Dharma, we elevate the spirit of [Name], guiding them to ascend to the immortal realms, and extending this merit to all forsaken and lost beings throughout the Dharma realms, that they may emerge from the depths of darkness and be raised to the Dao’s domain. May all beings universally partake in this excellence and blessing.

*Master’s Proclamation*
*Announcement of Petition or Talismanic Script*
*Invocation of the Celestial Gate*
*Burning and Offering*

Three recitations of the sutra are heard once more. The incense is returned to the censer, and the altar is descended. Gratitude is offered to the master, and the midday audience begins. The Three Refuges are recited, followed by the *Hymn of Past Lives* and the opening of the fourth scripture recitation.

*The Nine Natural Chapters*
*The Hidden Rhymes of the Heavenly Perfected*

After four recitations, the corporeal husk is opened and sundered. Now, ascending the altar for the fourth recitation, we intone the *Jade Chapters of the Nine Heavens’ Life-Generating Spirits*. The merit is dedicated in silence to the Lord of the Tusita Heaven, praying for the elevation of [Name]’s spirit to ascend to the immortal realms, and extending this grace to all forsaken and lost beings throughout the Dharma realms.

May their transgressions dissolve like melting snow, their karmic obstructions thaw like melting ice. May they awaken to the causes of life and death, and suddenly perceive the transformations of emptiness and non-being. May they avoid the butchering hells, sparing them the sorrow of dismemberment; may their ethereal souls and vital essence be reborn, granting them the joy of carefree wandering in Penglai’s isles. May they be reborn in the realm of divine immortals, soaring to the Queen Mother’s abode.

We bow our heads in reverence to the Void Sovereign, practicing the scriptural Dharma.

The numinous voice resounds, completing the fifth turning of the Wheel;
the departed receive and uphold it, their sins of many lives absolved.

On this fifth ascent to the altar,
we chant the *Nine Heavens’ Jade Scripture of Life-Generating Spirits*.
We dedicate this to the Heavenly Emperor of the Joyous Realm of Pāramitā,
praying for the soul of [Name] to ascend to the immortals’ realm,
and for all forsaken and suffering beings of the Dharma-realm.

May they awaken to the illusions of the past,
and seize the auspicious causes of this day.
May wholesome thoughts arise at once,
and all roots of evil be extinguished.
May they avoid the Diamond Hell,
spared the sorrow of bonds and imprisonment;
may their viscera and vital essence be reborn,
attaining the wondrous reversal of water and fire.
Refining the embryo to return to the origin,
they shall realize the Dao and attain perfection.

Spared entry into the Universal Seizure Hell,
they escape the chaos of golden hammers’ relentless torment;
reborn in the Primordial Palace of Spirit,

they rise from their seats in melodic recitation,
and in attendant devotion offer the merit of the sutra’s turning.

Beholding the Three Realms’ lofty Venerables,
the Nine Heavens’ august Sages,
we turn our gaze below to their compassionate creation,
jointly bestowing confirmation of our covenant.
We, your servants, have chanted the precious scripture,
completing its ninefold recitation.
Relying upon the scriptural Dharma,
we ascend and recommend the soul of so-and-so,
advancing them to the immortal realm,
extending to all forsaken and hidden beings,
that they may forever depart the dark netherworld,
ascend to the Dao’s domain,
and universally partake in this sublime blessing.
The Dharma assembly, in devout reverence,
circumambulates in hymns of praise.

*Master’s Declaration of Text*
*Proclamation of Memorial or Talisman*
*Declaration of Petition*
*Proclamation of Pass*
*Fumigation*
*Attending the Scripture, Hymning the Scripture*

We prostrate ourselves, acknowledging:
The Heavenly Worthy enacts the great compassionate transformation,
bestowing grace upon all beings;
the Perfected One expounds the scripture of spontaneity,
its merit perfected in ninefold recitation.
The true wind rises in the vast emptiness,
the Brahma-qi suffuses the cosmos.
Emerging before the Great Void’s dawn,
originating at the Primordial Unity’s inception,
without form or trace,
now present, now absent,
it universally delivers humans and heavens,
liberating wandering souls.

Now, we ascend and recommend the soul of so-and-so to the immortal realm,
extending our concern to the Dharma realm—
all forsaken, suffering souls,
who in their worldly days,
from time immemorial,
remained unaware of their leaky, colored bodies,
indulging in manifold karmic transgressions.
Since their lives ended,
they have wandered the wheel of rebirth,
unable to find liberation,
unable to ascend.
Without deliverance,
they cannot escape sinking and drowning.
Fortunately, the Most High revealed the scripture to deliver humanity,
that spiritual souls might regrow their roots and restore their lives.

Just now, leading the assembly to ascend the altar,
we turned and chanted the *Jade Scripture of the Nine Heavens’ Spontaneous Life*,
completing its ninefold recitation.
Solemnly, we employ it to ascend and recommend the soul of so-and-so,
extending to all forsaken beings.
We humbly pray that the Nine Perfected Ones show compassion,
that the Nine Qi coalesce and congeal.
Above, may it reach the Nine Heavens,
where auspicious clouds cover the Nine Palaces;
below, may it behold the Nine Earths,
where propitious light penetrates the Nine Springs.
May sunken souls and stagnant spirits all ascend,
may past karmic debts and old grievances all dissolve.
Sins like spring snow,
melt entirely in the warm sun;
transgressions like morning clouds,
scatter completely in the clear wind.
Ever pure, ever still,
without hindrance or coagulation.
Heavenly essence flows radiantly,
flying through the Nine Palaces.
The root of womb-bondage is untied,
all sensory leaks exhausted.
Freed from the shadowy netherworld,
they tread steadily upon the immortal’s steps.
In the Eight Poles’ palaces,
they shall forever be carefree companions;
within the Nine Empyreans’ courts,
they shall dwell as chambers of joyous feasting.

The dedication is complete,
the scripture heard in accordance with Dharma.

*Threefold Hearing of the Scripture*
*Master Gathers the Scripture*

The incense brazier is replenished,
White Spirits take leave at the altar’s front,
the Divine Kings descend the platform,
guiding the spirits to rest within the curtained sanctuary.
Gratitude is offered to the master,
merit recited,
the Jade Register’s life-nurturing and salvation rites for opening and closing are complete.
