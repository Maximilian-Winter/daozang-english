**The Supreme Cavernous Abyss Samādhi Divine Incantation Retreat: Rite of Repentance to the Ten Directions**
Edited and revised by Master Guangcheng, Du Guangting.

**The Eastern Direction**
We, your humble servants, reverently perform this *Cavernous Abyss Samādhi Divine Incantation Great Retreat* on behalf of the retreat sponsor, so-and-so, and all participants. Through the practice of the Dao, prostration, and repentance, we seek to avert calamities, cure illnesses, dispel misfortune, and invoke blessings.

May the Supreme One bestow compassion, and may the hosts of heaven show mercy. We pray that the overseers of the ten directions, the Great Brahmā Deva-King, the demon-slaying officers and soldiers, the disaster-dispelling vajra-warriors, all descend upon this ritual seat and assemble in this Daoist sanctuary. On behalf of the retreat sponsor, may they capture and expel demonic spirits, drive away malevolent ghosts, and swiftly sever the manifold disasters wrought by Gou Yingzi and his followers. May they uphold the retreat sponsor, curing all ailments and dissolving a thousand misfortunes. May they extend lifespan, elevate rank and emolument, deliver the nine generations of ancestors to ascension, and liberate the seven lineages to bliss. May the entire household dwell in peace and stability, and may all—noble and base—enjoy health and prosperity. May all wishes be fulfilled, and may we look up in gratitude to the mysterious grace.

**Incantation:**
In the Eastern Direction, the Venerable Lord of Azure,
Whose name is the Numinous Gou Mang.
You roam the vast heavens,
Brushing the Jade Capital with azure hues.
The Great Vehicle encompasses the Three Heavens,
While the host of perfected ones commands demonic legions.
The eight tones resound through the ten lands,
As nine dragons draw your cloud-borne chariot.
Establishing the retreat, you achieve great merit,
Illuminating the long night with radiance.
The drum of the true Dao resounds,
And all demonic forces crumble and fall.
The Demon King bows in submission,
Daring not test you—his form is obliterated.
Benevolent spirits guard the gates,
While vajra-warriors marshal the myriad spirits.
The qi of the Dao flows widely,
And all kin dwell in peace.
Plagues and poisons vanish entirely,
And the myriad people attain long life.
Together we propagate the supreme Dao,
And ascend to the Purple Phoenix City.

**The Southern Direction**

We, your humble servants, reverently establish for the retreat’s sponsor, so-and-so and company, the Great Retreat of the Wondrous Spell of the Cavernous Abyss Samādhi. We perform the Dao-circuits and prostration-repentances to heal afflictions and calamities, to invoke blessings and beseech grace. May the Great Sage extend vast compassion, and may the host of perfected ones bestow their protection. Dispatch the Heavenly Soldiers and Valiant Warriors, the Red-Killing Celestial Troops, to seize and expel demonic plagues, to annihilate the Nine Sons of the Scorched Clan and all who bring forth afflictions and calamities. May all misfortunes be gathered, their poisons and essences captured, each returned to their proper place. Thus shall the retreat’s sponsors find their illnesses healed, their souls and spirits purified and at peace. May their lifespans be extended, their ranks and emoluments advanced. May their departed ancestors and forebears be freed from the dark paths. May the entire household enjoy peace and well-being, high and low alike, steadfast and auspicious. May all wishes be fulfilled, and may we look up to receive the mysterious grace.

**Spell:**
The Southern Flame Emperor,
Across the Eight Directions known as Leisurely Floating.
His flying chariot drawn by cloud-borne steeds,
He roams the Ten Uprights and the Three Heavens.
Jade maidens ride the clouds in song,
Golden light entwines the Cinnabar Mound.
Today the Dharma-wheel turns,
Its Brahmanic resonance shakes the Nine Peaks.
Heavenly demons command their demonic legions,
The winds rise—then naturally cease.
Radiant, the Three Luminaries shine,
All demonic forces shatter the Nine Nether realms.
Dare any test or challenge,
The Valiant Warriors shall sever their heads.
The sons of the Heavenly Emperors,
Slay ghosts—no qi flows.
Thus, the defiant and violent,
Are scalded in boiling broth, their bodies cooked.
Thousands upon thousands, all beheaded,
Ten thousand upon ten thousand, none remain.
The retreat summons and captures demonic essences,
Specters and goblins are gathered one by one.
The majesty of the Great Dao is weighty,
Divine winds sweep away evil and malevolence.
Ghostly plagues are utterly dispelled,
The myriad people know no calamity or sorrow.

**The Western Direction**

We, your humble servants, reverently establish for the retreat’s sponsor, so-and-so and company, the Great Retreat of the Wondrous Spell of the Cavernous Abyss Samādhi. We perform the Dao-circuits and prostration-repentances to heal illnesses, dispel misfortune, and eradicate calamities and malevolence. We humbly beseech the Five Thearchic Divine Honored Ones, the Lesser Yin host of sages, to extend their vast compassion and mercy, to look upon our earnest prayers with favor. May they dispatch the Great Soldiers of the Nine Heavens, the Red-Killing Valiant Warriors, to seize and expel Xinling, the Red Crow specters, the spirits of the living and the dead, the ghosts of tombs and graves, the followers of Wunu Liuzi and their ilk. May they sever all misfortunes, ward off pestilence and miasmas. May they send down numinous fluids to irrigate the Three Fields. May the Four Great Elements be light and strong, and may the years of life be further increased. May ranks and emoluments be perpetually advanced, swiftly ascending to the heights of the Terrace and Balance. May departed ancestors and forebears together transcend to the realm of tranquility. May all wishes be fulfilled, and may we look up to receive the mysterious grace.

**Spell:**
The Western Harvest God,
Known as Gou Ni.
The Three Luminaries in the profound void,
Bright and clear, transcending the Four Directions.
The Eight Tones and Thirty-Two,
All demonic qi crumbles of itself.
Today we establish the field of merit,
The divine spell shatters the demonic throng.
Lamps are lit, their light shining afar,
The long night opens, radiant and clear.
Winds cease, rains too rest,
Slaying demons, binding wickedness and wrong.
Dare any defiant ghost intrude,
Bound and sent to the borders of hell.
Golden blades slash and sever,
Iron staves strike in chaotic blows.
Performing the Dao-circuits to eradicate all evil,
Burning incense to extinguish a thousand calamities.
The Daoist’s heart is single-minded and devoted,
Accumulating goodness to raise the dead.
All demons fear true rectitude,
Evil and deceit dare not transgress.
Revering the master and the Great Dao,
The qi of the Dao naturally returns.
Fools cannot learn,
The wise ever abide by it.
They spare not wealth or body,
Esteeming the teachings that ride the empty void.

**The Northern Direction**

We, your humble servants, reverently conduct for the patrons, so-and-so and others, the Great Purification Rite of the Cavernous Abyss Samādhi Divine Incantations. We recite scriptures and perform Dao-circuits to heal afflictions and illnesses, invoking blessings and expelling demons. We humbly pray that the Five Qi Divine Lords and the True Saints of the Northern Direction will command and dispatch the assembled hosts—Song Wenchang and his multitude, the Wind and Rain Generals, the Four Heavenly Kings—to unite in strength and capture and eradicate the Great Demon Qingzhen of Fudan and his offspring, the spirits haunting gates, doors, wells, and hearths, along with the malevolent deities such as Chengbo, Alun, Dingning, and Zidu. May all be utterly swept away, cleansing both within and without. May the patrons’ illnesses and sufferings be cured, their Four Great Elements light and robust. May their spirits be settled, their blessings and longevity increased. May the lingering souls of their departed ancestors ascend in purity. May all within the household enjoy peace and prosperity, with every fortune auspicious and unobstructed. May their wishes be fulfilled, and may they look up in gratitude to the profound grace.

**Incantation:**
In the Northern Realm of Yudan,
The Divine Sovereign is called Xuanming.
The four seasons unfold in grandeur,
The five qi shine with radiant clarity.
All filth and evil are swept away,
The heavens and earth purified in vast expanse.
The Most High’s majesty is stern and unyielding,
Defiant ghosts perish without life.
Should any dare to resist,
They shall be seized and delivered to the Celestial Soldiers.
Thousands upon thousands shall be beheaded,
Myriads upon myriads shall be dismembered.
Yama severs the wicked and demonic,
The Northern Dipper extinguishes the essence of evil.
Divine winds sweep away all misfortune,
No evil dares linger.
The grace of the Supreme Saints flows forth,
All things universally flourish in glory.

**The Central Direction**
We, your humble servants, reverently conduct for the patrons, so-and-so and others, the Great Purification Rite of the Cavernous Abyss Samādhi Divine Incantations. We perform Dao-circuits and offer repentance to heal afflictions and illnesses, driving out demonic plagues. We pray that the mighty forces of the ten directions and the Thirty-Six Heavenly Warriors will shield the patrons, eradicate malevolent influences, and capture and expel the vengeful ghosts of Li Ziao, who died away from home amidst the clouds. May the spirits taking the forms of livestock and humans, the bewitching entities of the Five Woods, the myriad seductive specters, the barbarian ghosts of the Rong and Qiang tribes, the spirits dwelling in mountains, waters, and fires, and the myriad kinds of Shegong ghosts—may all be utterly annihilated. We humbly pray that the patrons’ thousand sins and myriad transgressions be absolved, their calamities and misfortunes dissolved in silence, their decline and peril averted. May they be blessed with a thousand years of protection, their ranks and emoluments elevated. May their seven generations of ancestors and nine lineages of descendants all ascend to the wondrous fruit. May their wishes be fulfilled, and may they look up in gratitude to the profound grace.

**Incantation:**
The Central Gods of Wu and Ji,
The Yellow Emperor governs all affairs.
The Three Qins oversee the eight directions,
The Celestial Hook shines with heavenly radiance.
The sky’s brilliance blazes forth,
The darkest night is suddenly dispelled.
The Way’s benevolence is universally bestowed,
All beings turn in reverent dependence.
Today we establish the Great Purification Rite,
No evil dares to draw near.
The winds still, the branches unmoved,
Virtue and fortune rise high and majestic.
How dare pestilential ghosts defy,
Billions upon billions are slain without remnant.
When the people suffer illness and hardship,
If they invoke the Divine Incantation Rite,
The afflicted shall be swiftly healed,
The demonic qi shall crumble and collapse.
The myriad heavens subdue the demonic spirits,
The host of Perfected Ones slays evil and wrong.
The Most High’s golden decree is issued,
Who dares resent death if they disobey?
If one submits to the Daoist teachings,
Cease evil and do no wrong.

**The Northeast Direction**
We, your humble servants, reverently conduct for the patrons, so-and-so and others, the Great Rite of Praise for the Cavernous Abyss Samādhi Incantations. We recite scriptures and perform Dao-circuits to avert calamities and heal illnesses, invoking blessings and beseeching grace. We pray that the Five Directional Divine Youths be dispatched to capture and slay the Five Essences, and to eradicate the myriad diseases spread by the brothers Jia Yuan and Huang Nu of the Seven Blows. May all misfortunes and disasters be seized by the ghostly soldiers and driven away, that the patrons’ illnesses be cured, their bodies healthy and strong. May their years be prolonged, their ranks and emoluments elevated. May their households receive blessings, the high and low alike enjoy peace. May their seven generations of ancestors ascend in purity, their nine lineages of descendants attain liberation. May their wishes be fulfilled, and may they look up in gratitude to the profound grace.

**Incantation:**
In the Northeast, child of Gen,
Its spirit governs the yin node.
Upholding the Most High’s teachings,
Good and evil are clearly distinguished.
Deceitful evil does not encroach upon the true,
Those who transgress deserve execution.
The Supreme Saints protect the people,
Those who invade face severe punishment.
The Cavernous Abyss is governed with clarity and solemnity,
The Samādhi Dharma is stern and unyielding.
The divine incantations extinguish demonic evil,
All demonic forces are annihilated.
Eradicate misfortune, and it shall cease,
Slay ghosts, and they shall be extinguished.
Divine soldiers fill the heavens,
Sacred winds sweep the earth.
A hundred blessings arise from every direction,
A thousand disasters sink into the Nine Yin.
Public and private affairs know no hindrance,
The living and the dead receive deliverance.

**The Southeast Direction**

We, your humble servants, reverently conduct for the patron, so-and-so, the Great Fast of the Cavernous Abyss Samādhi Divine Incantations. Through the Dao-procession and rites of repentance, we pray to dispatch the Crimson Conscripts and minor officers, the Supreme Perfected Cavalries, to capture and eliminate the Hundred Dragon Kings and their retinue, along with the calamities and ailments they inflict. We command the lower troops to sever and intercept them entirely, that the patron may purify the Six Palaces, nourish the Hundred Passages, dispel illnesses, and eradicate misfortunes. May their official emoluments be secured, their years prolonged, the hidden souls delivered, and the living protected. May their wishes be fulfilled, and may they look up to receive the profound grace.

**Incantation:**
The gods of the Southeast, Xun’s domain,
Spread their nets at the earthly gates.
The nets are cast across the world,
No hundred ghosts may pass through.
The Five Peaks stand in tranquility,
The Four Seas do not surge—
Ten thousand evils dare not stir,
All demonic forces are bound and restrained.
Should any demon or ghost dare approach in defiance,
They shall be slain and consigned to Lu Luo.
Their heads shattered into thousands of fragments,
Their forms utterly ground to naught.
To shield and rescue the people from suffering,
Disasters and misfortunes shall pass them by.
The Three Officials submit to the mighty decree,
As prescribed in the *Scripture of the Lady of Qing*.
**The Southwest Direction**

We, your humble servants, reverently conduct for the patron, so-and-so, the Great Fast of the Cavernous Abyss Samādhi Divine Incantations. Through expiatory rites and the Dao-procession, we pray to dispatch the Lords of the Nine Heavens, the Forceful Warriors of the Three Primes, to capture and gather all malevolent spirits, demonic obeisances, and the great ghosts of mountains, forests, waters, fire, wind, and earth—along with their followers, such as the Worry-Bound Youth of Wenqing—driving them a thousand leagues away, banished to distant lands. We beseech pardon for the patron’s past transgressions, dispelling all present afflictions, that their soul may be purified and their qi invigorated, their misfortunes dissolved. May the Four Great Elements harmonize, the Six Palaces flow freely, ghostly qi be cleansed, and demonic essences eradicated. May their fortune and longevity increase, their emoluments and rank endure. May their heart’s desire be fulfilled, and may they look up to receive the profound grace.

**Incantation:**
The Southwest, Kun’s mother,
Her divine power restrains evil essences.
She forbids the ghosts of heaven and earth,
Plagues and poisons may not advance.
Should any disobey,
The golden blade shall sever their forms.
Today we establish the Great Fast,
Delivering the dead and restoring the living.
The Three Luminaries shine as one,
The Nine Dark Realms are illuminated.
Brightness pervades the ten directions,
No hundred ghosts may hide their forms.
If illness persists,
They shall be seized and consigned to the Seven Stars.
Divine winds sweep away inauspiciousness,
Evil naturally subsides.
By the clear decree of the Venerable Lord,
Swiftly, swiftly, as the statute commands.
**The Northwest Direction**

We, your humble servants, reverently conduct for the patron, so-and-so, the Great Fast of the Cavernous Abyss Samādhi Divine Incantations. Through the Dao-procession, rites of repentance, and meditation upon the Perfected, we pray for grace and blessings. We beseech the dispatch of valiant soldiers and forceful warriors to expel the calamities led by Wang Feng and Bai Qi. May they be annihilated at once, without mercy. Thus shall the patron’s spirit be at peace, their soul settled, divine medicines irrigate their heart, and their ailments daily healed. May their lifespan increase, their emoluments endure, and their ascent to high office be swift. May their seven ancestors and nine lineages all ascend to wondrous bliss. May their wishes be fulfilled, and may they look up to receive the profound grace.

**Incantation:**
The Northwest, Qian’s father,
His divine power reaches the light of heaven.
The Sage Emperor pities the people,
Harmed by the hundred ghosts.
Thus he weaves the Celestial Net,
Spreading it across the ten directions.
He captures plague and pestilence spirits,
None may hide.
One by one, the ghosts are slain,
Consigned to boiling cauldrons.
All are utterly destroyed,
None may escape.
Today we establish merit,
Fortune flows, misfortune vanishes.
The sick shall recover,
The unharmed shall remain in peace.
Dwellings shall be serene,
Ghostly qi wholly dispelled.
Heavenly gods all protect them,
The household and waters shall prosper.
**The Upper Realm**

We, your humble servants, reverently perform the Great Retreat of the Cavernous Abyss Samādhi Divine Incantation for the patron, so-and-so, and their company, to heal illness and dispel calamity, to cultivate merit and practice the Dao. May we dispatch the Yellow Flower Force Warriors, the Orthodox Unity Envoys, and the Red-Headed Great Demons of the Female Basin, to seize and subdue all perverse spirits, annihilating them in an instant. May the patron’s misfortunes scatter like rain, their karmic obstructions dissolve like clouds. May their six viscera be harmonious, their hundred meridians flow smoothly. May their lifespan increase, their rank and emoluments endure. May their seven ancestors ascend, their nine lineages receive blessings. May their wishes be fulfilled, and may they look up to receive the profound grace.

**Incantation:**
The Emperors of the Upper Realm’s many heavens,
Pass through the Great Brahma Gate.
They shelter and nurture the people of the earth,
Prolonging their years through kalpas.
How dare the lower demons not perish,
Even as their poisons slay the myriad people?
Death and sickness spread in chaos,
Their cries of resentment reach the heavens above.
The heavens dispatch great armies,
Hurling fire to gather the hundred pestilences.
The Three and Five sever the demons’ paths,
The Seven Stars seal the ghosts’ gate.
Bound and cast into the celestial prison,
The myriad people are made whole.

**The Lower Realm**

We, your humble servants, reverently perform the Great Retreat of the Cavernous Abyss Samādhi Divine Incantation for the patron, so-and-so, and their company. We practice the Dao, offer repentance, and take refuge in the multitude of honored ones. May we dispatch the Great Luminous Overseers of Demons and the Envoys of Reversed Slaughter, each wielding iron cavalry, to capture and seize all perverse spirits. May the patron’s illnesses be swiftly removed, their spirits calmed, their souls settled. May their calamities be swept away, their lifespan extended. May their favor and rank endure, their ascent to high office swift. May their wishes be fulfilled, and may they look up to receive the profound grace.

**Incantation:**
The numinous earth deities of the Lower Realm,
Govern the nine domains.
They purify the four seas,
Securely guard the five peaks.
They restrain and subdue demonic ghosts,
Preventing them from spreading their hundred poisons.
The sagely ones protect the people,
Thus they descend with the covenant’s authority.
Should any dare to defy,
They shall be seized and delivered to the celestial peaks.
Iron hooks gouge the ghosts’ eyes,
Golden blades sever their hands and feet.
The divine incantation slays the hundred demons,
The hundred demons’ clans are annihilated.
The myriad people feel the Dao’s grace,
No longer will they weep in sorrow.
They shall pass through inauspicious years,
And witness the world’s peace and joy.

The Ten Directions’ Rite of Repentance for the Cavernous Abyss Samādhi Divine Incantation Retreat is now complete.
