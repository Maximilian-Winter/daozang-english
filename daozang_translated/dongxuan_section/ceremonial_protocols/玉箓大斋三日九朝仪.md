**First Day Early Morning Ritual of the Jade Register Grand Fast**

All pay homage to the master and maintain mindfulness as prescribed:

Golden Perfection and Verdant Radiance illumine the Three Heavens,
Crimson clouds soar through the Cinnabar Empyrean—all heavens guide their chariots.
Morning brilliance unfolds the dawn, dispelling yin’s shadows entirely.
The Nine Subtleties shake the void; the Five Stars revolve.
Myriad heavens respond in resonance, naturally wondrous and profound.
In the distant dark, the body disperses, dividing into a hundred thousand forms.
The Mystic Pearl shines resplendent; auspicious *qi* fills the altar’s firmament.
The hidden and manifest receive grace, refined by the Golden Spring’s flow.
Demon kings tremble in fear; the Three Fields merge in radiant harmony.

**Kindling the Incense Burner**
Strike the ritual drum twenty-four times.

O Most High Three Heavens, Mysterious Primordial Three *Qi*, Supreme Venerable Lord Lao, summon forth from within my body the Three and Five Merit Officers, the Left and Right Attendant Messengers, the Left and Right Incense-Bearing Golden Lads, the Jade Maidens who convey words and scatter flowers, and the Five Thearchs’ Direct Talismans and Daily Incense Officials—thirty-six of each.
Let them emerge, adorned in solemn attire, crowned and sashed with hanging tassels.
Notify the Land Spirit of the Mystic Altar and the local deities and perfected ones.
This morning, I ascend the altar to perform the Dao, offering audience to the Imperial Perfected.
With reverence, I present my sincerest intentions, all recorded in sealed writ.
May the Supreme Perfected’s *Dao-qi*, the Numinous Treasure’s auspicious radiance descend,
flowing into our bodies, that the sincerity of my petition swiftly reach
the presence of the Most High and Boundless Dao’s Three Pure Ones and August Saints,
before the Golden Portal Jade Emperor, Supreme Lord of the Vast Heaven.

**Proclaiming the Dharma Titles**
All present officials and altar assembly, with unified sincerity, reverently address:

The Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Void and Spontaneous,
The Boundless Great Dao’s Supreme Lord of the Dao,
The Supreme Venerable Lord Lao,
The August Jade Emperor,
The Great Sage Perfected Ones of the Ten Directions who have attained the Dao,
The Lords and Masters of the Thirty-Two Heavens,
The Jade Clarity Emperor,
The Great Emperor of the Jade Thearch,
The Eastern Florescence, Southern Culmen, Western Numinous, Northern Perfected,
The Golden Portal of the Mystic Capital, the Seven-Treasure Jeweled Terrace of the Purple Tenuity Upper Palace,
The Numinous Treasure’s Supreme Clarity Radiant August Lord of the Dao,
The Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures,
The Great Dharma Masters of the Mystic Center,
The Supreme Ministers, Supreme Chancellors, Supreme Protectors, Supreme Tutors,
The Twenty-Four Perfected of the Great Peace’s Lesser Teaching,
The Lord King of Total Perfection of the Western City,
The Perfected of the Great One,
The Supreme Minister of the Eastern Marchmount,
The Lord Mao of Life Mandates,
The Two Perfected of Determined Records and Life Preservation,
The Divine Immortals who have attained the Dao in the sacred mountains and grotto-heavens,
The officials of the Three Realms,
and all true numina.

We have heard:
One *qi* subtly congeals, merging at the inception of the empty and profound;
The Three Effulgences flourish luxuriantly, gestating at the dawn of the primordial vastness.

The sublime surpasses all speech, yet within it lies form.
Above, there is no further ancestry—only the Dao is its body.
It enfolds the Two Images to store the spirit,
and gathers the Nine Heavens to govern all transformations.
It first gave rise to the *qi* of the Most High Jade Emperor,
the Great Brahmā of the Vast Net;
From the primordial chaos of the Supreme Void,
the Red Script unfolded the expanse.
It unfolds and magnifies the most wondrous,
parting and merging in spontaneity.

We, your servants, have long encountered the true wind
and fortunately met with flourishing fortune.
Riding the fair dawn to awakening and communion,
we humbly attend the divine scriptures;
Exposing our hearts to the radiant gaze,
we attain to the supreme model.

In all that we initiate,
we dare not fail to make known.
With sincere intent in our blue-green memorial,
we reverently present our petition.
As stated in the words of the memorial,
we do not deviate from our earnest plea.

May the Most High, in mercy, discern and heed our prayer.

We have heard:
The Most Venerable abides in profound stillness,
wielding the unfathomable mechanism of yin and yang;
The wondrous realm floats in emptiness,
structuring the chamber where sun and moon swiftly course.
Cinnabar spirits dance,
white cranes wheel in flight.

We, your servants, rise before dawn to greet the origin,
diligently seeking the mandate.
The Red Youth shines with radiance,
guiding the flowing dawn of the Valley of Bestowal;
The Azure Elder scatters brilliance,
joining the *qi* of life from the Wooden Palace.
Three hues mingle in obscurity within the chamber,
a hundred spirits gather before the incense burner.

With reverence, we transmit the fragrance,
offering the rites of the fast.
On this first day, at the clear dawn of the Dao-procession,
we, the assembly of the Dharma, invoke the first pinch of incense.
May this fragrant smoke ascend to the heavens,
directly offering to the Primal Heavenly Worthy of the Void and Most True, the Natural and Great Dao.

By the merit of this pinch of incense,
we pray for the present emperor,
whose sacred longevity knows no bounds.
May his singular virtue reach heaven,
and his mandate endure for ten thousand years.
May he receive the chart and grasp the tally,
his wise years equaling the brilliance of the Dipper and Weaver;
May he be granted felicity and welcome auspiciousness,
his blessed fortune as steadfast as the hills and mountains.
May his years extend beyond heaven’s reckoning,
far surpassing the vast kalpas.
May the Nine Provinces and Eight Wastes
all attain benevolence and longevity.
For a thousand autumns and ten thousand generations,
may he long uphold prosperity and peace.

Thus, we now burn incense,
and from this moment, take refuge in the Dao, the Venerable, the Great Sage Assembly,
and the virtue of the Most True.
After attaining the Dao,
may we preserve heaven and endure forever.

We have heard:
Purple silk shines with splendor,
as the Great Sage celebrates the assembly in the Forest of Auspiciousness;
Auspicious light bears form,
as the Jade Emperor illumines the orchid chamber’s glory.
Dispelling the dense shadows,
it merges and harmonizes the ten thousand kinds.

On this first day, at the clear dawn of the Dao-procession,
we, the assembly of the Dharma, invoke the second pinch of incense.
May this fragrant smoke ascend to the heavens,
directly offering to the Jade Dawn, the Most Sacred, the Natural and Numinous Treasure of the Great Dao, the Heavenly Worthy.

By the merit of this pinch of incense,
we pray for the ancestral shrines, the divine presences,
and the true wanderings of the altars of soil and grain.
May they refine their essences on the cinnabar terrace,
and delight their spirits in the Purple Ultimate.
At ease and free,
may they gaze upon the ancestral temples to store their essence;
Attaining sageliness and achieving perfection,
may they ascend to the imperial homeland and enter the wondrous.
May blessings overflow the household and state,
and grace extend throughout the realm.

Thus, we now burn incense,
and from this moment, take refuge in the Scriptures, the Venerable, the Great Sage Assembly,
and the virtue of the Most True.
After attaining the Dao,
may we ascend into the formless.

We have heard:
The Mysterious Father and Mysterious Mother
transform the Three Fields of the Palace of Zi and Wu;
The True Radiance and True Essence
receive the *qi* of the Nine Heavens’ east and west movements.
Jade nectar flows and moistens,
the cinnabar chamber abides forever.

On this first day, at the clear dawn of the Dao-procession,
we, the assembly of the Dharma, invoke the third pinch of incense.
May this fragrant smoke ascend to the heavens,
directly offering to the Primal Vast Great Sage, the Natural Lord of Transformation, the Heavenly Worthy of the Dao and Its Virtue.

By the merit of this pinch of incense,
we pray for the divine forms of those being offered.
May their Dao accord with non-action,
and their hearts wander in the Supreme Simplicity.
In the Purple Tenuity’s true realm,
may they attend the supreme sages in the Nine [Heavens];
In the Azure Vault’s jade palace,
may they accompany the lofty immortals in the Three Realms.
May they feast on the terrace’s sounds in the empty [void],
and [absorb] the *qi* of the Mysterious Origin.
May they bestow abundance upon later descendants,
and root friendship for a hundred generations.
May they transmit blessings within the central禁,
and their descendants flourish for a hundred million years.

Thus, we now burn incense,
and from this moment, take refuge in the Masters, the Venerable, the Great Sage Assembly,
and the virtue of the Most True.
After attaining the Dao,
may we ascend into the formless.

Harmonizing with the Dao, we unite with the true.
The rites are complete.

Confession

Thrice we invoke, thrice we bow, and once more we intone the sacred titles. All those in attendance—officiants, altar officials, and the assembled—humbly and with one heart supplicate the Three Purities Most Revered, the Ten Directions’ Lofty Sages, the Heavenly Perfected of the Jade Capital and Golden Towers, the Celestial Emperors and Heavenly Immortals, the Ten Directions’ Masters and Sacred Assemblies, the officials of the Three Realms, and all majestic spirits.

We have heard that when the Azure Vault received the scriptures, all heavens resounded with praise; when the White Chariot opened the path, it traversed the Three Realms, and all listened. We, unworthy though we are of mortal endowment, have presumptuously aided the transformation of the Mysterious. We ought to nest our spirits in the realm of the Dao, to refine our truth by partaking of the empty azure, to sever ties with the dusty world, and to ascend lightly upon thoughts of the Cinnabar Splendor.

At the outset of this covenant, merit-making takes precedence. Thus, we expound the Dharma to deliver beings, vowing to assist Heaven and propagate its teachings. Moreover, in reverent compliance with the celestial mandate, we dutifully perform this rite. In honor of [the departed] since their passing, we recall their toil and boundless devotion, which Heaven itself cannot repay. Yearning for their true visage, we now offer this requiem.

We have specially summoned the feathered and flowing assembly to reverently conduct the Jade Register Retreat, opening the way for the divine presence to ascend to the Heavenly Palace. May their spirit transcend the Azure Vault and their essence be refined in the Cinnabar Court. May they wander the realm of purity, awaken to the boundless emptiness of the Dao, their names inscribed on the Jade Tablets, their rank established in the Jasper Palace.

Next, we pray that the imperial Dao flourish afar, that the royal heir’s foundation endure. May sagely virtue equal that of Yao and Shun, and may the assisting ministers be as steadfast as Gao and Kui. May the sovereign’s longevity extend, and the frontiers remain tranquil. May all under Heaven share in the vast and boundless grace; may the Ten Lands and Nine Netherworlds alike partake in the joy of life and growth. Thus shall the radiance of the Heavenly Worthy’s great compassion be manifest above, and our devotion in taking refuge be fulfilled below.

We humbly present this supplication.

Twelve Vows
First, may the Three Honored Ones deign to witness.
Second, may the Five Elders bestow their radiance.
Third, may the divine light shine resplendently.
Fourth, may the Nine Qi confer auspiciousness.
Fifth, may the Five Phases align with their course.
Sixth, may the sacred talismans take flight.
Seventh, may Kan and Li conjoin their destiny.
Eighth, may the Nine Nights unfold their brilliance.
Ninth, may the Mysterious Altar respond with numinosity.
Tenth, may [the departed’s] name be inscribed in the Upper Firmament.
Eleventh, may the divine presence receive deliverance.
Twelfth, may the nation’s destiny be prolonged.

Replenishing the Censer
Concentrating the spirit, we burn incense.

Incense Official Messengers, Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, and all Attendant Incense Spirits—may this place where we have this morning ascended the altar to perform the Dao now spontaneously generate golden liquid, cinnabar, and azure mushroom blossoms. May the hundred numinous perfected beings gather here before the incense burner. We pray that the jade maidens and immortal youths of the ten directions receive the orchid-scented smoke and swiftly convey the sincerity of our supplications directly to the Most Real and Boundless Dao, the Three Clarities, the August Supreme Sages, and the Jade Emperor of the Golden Gates and Jade Palace in the Lofty Heaven.

The First Day’s Morning Rites of the Jade Register Grand Fast are now concluded.
The First Day’s Noon Rites of the Jade Register Grand Fast

All pay homage to the masters and concentrate the spirit as prescribed.
Chanting the *Empty Cavern* hymns, the Celestial Lord guards the altar.
The Five Emperors review the records, receiving talismans from the Three Officials.
The four gates are secured, binding demons and expelling evil.
Fiery bells are cast, burning away yin impurities.
The body bears the golden script, refining the elixir and rejuvenating the countenance.
Mysterious and pure unite, the heart stirring the Three Passes.
Riding lions and mounting cranes, controlling dragons and mounting simurghs.
A myriad stars guard the abode, a thousand demons dare not intrude.
The Dao’s qi endures forever, all immortals are at peace.

The censer is kindled as before.
The dharma ranks are invoked.

We, the assembled officiants and altar attendants, with one heart humbly present this supplication to the Void and Spontaneous Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Boundless Dao, the Supreme Lord of the Dao, the Most High Lord Lao, the August Jade Emperor, the perfected and sagely hosts of the ten directions who have attained the Dao, the Lords of the Thirty-Two Heavens, the Jade Void Emperor, the Great Emperor of the Jade Capital, the Eastern Flowery, Southern Culmen, Western Numinous, and Northern Perfected Lords of the Mysterious Capital, the Golden Gates, the Seven-Treasure Jeweled Terrace, and the Purple Tenuity Upper Palace, the Radiant Sovereign of the Numinous Treasure, the thirty-six divisions of revered scriptures, the Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Center, the Supreme Ministers, Supreme Stewards, Supreme Protectors, Supreme Transmitters, the Twenty-Four Perfected of the Great Peace’s Lesser Teaching, the King of Total Perfection of the Western City, the Perfected of the Great One, the Supreme Minister of the Eastern Peak, the Lord of Life, Lord Mao, the Two Perfected of Determined Record and Life Preservation, the divine immortals who have attained the Dao in the grotto-heavens and famous mountains, the officials of the Three Realms, and all true numina.

We have heard that the two luminaries contain the void, concealing numinous splendor before any sign appears; the nine heavens gather the Sanskrit, uniting wondrous qi with spontaneity. Before images and emperors, it stood solitary and silent. Above the Great Beginning, it was indistinct and nameless. Blending the three colors into profound communion, it coagulated the one spirit to generate transformation. Dividing the supreme qi of the Jade Void, it thickened into the *Dongzhang* scriptures; originating the primordial crimson chaos of the Great Nothing, it revolved through the Sanskrit practices. No scripture remains untransmitted, yet the ultimate is difficult to surpass. We, relying on fortunate causes, have glimpsed the mysterious and wondrous. Unfolding the secret depths of the ninefold radiance, we have glimpsed the numinous scriptures; proclaiming the luminous regulations of the Three Caverns, we follow the teachings and canons. In all that we present, we dare not fail to report above.

The intentions of the fast and the blue-green memorial are now respectfully proclaimed. As stated in the memorial’s words, we do not deviate from our earnest pleas. We beseech the Great Dao to distinguish and grant our prayers.

We have heard that in the empty azure, the cloud-script of the Mysterious Mound appears; in the flowing radiance of the Great Desert, the Sanskrit reveals the celestial perfected’s intent. A single qi of whirling ascent nurtures the Nine Clarities. We, observing the sun’s shadow and refining our spirits, do not falter past noon. The fragrant radiance of the returning wind shines upon the towering gates; the rushing solar essence of the red sun shines directly upon the cinnabar heaven. Feathered canopies stream essence along the Yellow Path, jade flowers scatter light upon the Mysterious Altar. Reverently relying on incense to convey our message, we perform the fast’s rites.

Today, at the midpoint of the first day’s Dao performance, we, the dharma assembly, now offer the first pinch of incense. May this incense smoke ascend to the heavens, directly offering reverence to the Void, Most Real, and Spontaneous Great Dao, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy. May the merit of this pinch of incense extend upward to bless the present emperor, that his reign endure boundlessly. We humbly pray that his rule may span a thousand ages, his Dao equaling the Two Emperors. May his grand enterprise be as firm as heaven, his foundation enduring for a hundred million myriad generations; may his imperial destiny flourish daily, surpassing the eight-hundred-year oracle. Grasping the true talisman to govern the realm, may he bear the mandate in his person. May his reign be long and his achievements radiant, his merits surpassing those of his ancestors. May all auspicious signs arrive, great blessings come abundantly.

Now, therefore, we burn incense, taking refuge from the Dao, the revered, the sagely hosts, and the perfected powers. After attaining the Dao, may he preserve heaven and endure forever.

We have heard that the purple essence shines brightly, the three huts generating the spirit of emptiness and silence; the jeweled chamber radiates light, the ten unions turning the golden bridge’s sages. The wondrous mechanism inverts shadows, the great chaos flies into the mysterious.

Today, at the midpoint of the first day’s Dao performance, we, the dharma assembly, now offer the second pinch of incense. May this incense smoke ascend to the heavens, directly offering reverence to the Jade Dawn, Most Sagely, Spontaneous, Numinous Treasure Great Dao Heavenly Worthy. May the merit of this pinch of incense extend upward to bless the empress, the imperial mother’s numinous form. We humbly pray that she refine her essence in the Eastern Flowery and mold her soul in the Southern Culmen. May she ascend to the Golden Gates, directly joining the ranks of the Most High; may she wander and feast in the Jade Capital, her position aligned with the throne of the Primordial Perfected. May she bestow auspiciousness upon the imperial destiny, extending the prosperity of the imperial enterprise. May the golden branches and jade leaves flourish ever more, the purple phoenix and green simurgh offering auspicious signs. May the nine provinces be at peace, the four seas tranquil.

Now, therefore, we burn incense, taking refuge from the scriptures, the revered, the sagely hosts, and the perfected powers. After attaining the Dao, may she ascend into the formless.

We have heard that when the primordial chaos was split open, the round and clear were divided from the square and turbid; when the ranks of high and low were established, there arose the distinctions between the human world and the celestial passes.

At Purple Void’s lush radiance, Jade Essence’s flowing light—
today, on the first day at the hour of noon, as we perform the Dao-circuits,
the assembly of dharma-adepts here present kindle these three pinches of incense.
May this fragrant smoke ascend through the heavens,
directly offering reverence to the Primordial Great Sage, the Heavenly Worthy of Natural Dao and Power.

May the merit of this incense-offering ascend to honor the numinous presence of the ancestral shrines and the former sages.
We humbly pray that heaven and earth illumine with splendor, the Great Void resonate in harmony.
May they nurture purity in tranquility, resting in the Yellow Chamber;
may they refine the azure emptiness to true essence, ascending directly to the Purple Ultimate.
Bestow auspiciousness upon the ancestral temples, extend blessings to the heir’s palace.

Now, therefore, we burn incense, taking refuge from the master, the revered, the sagely hosts, and the perfected powers.
After attaining the Dao, may they ascend into the formless.

In repentance, circumambulation, subduing demons, pacing the void,
bowing to the scriptures, thrice invoking, and solemnly reciting the dharma-ranks—
we, the assembled officials and altar-attending hosts, with utmost sincerity,
jointly supplicate the Three Clarities’ August Worthies,
the Ten Directions’ Supreme Saints,
the Heavenly Emperors and Perfected of Jade Capital and Golden Towers,
the Ten Directions’ Master Worthies and Sagely Hosts,
the officials of the Three Realms, and all mighty numina.

We have heard that when the Cavernous Mystery revealed its scriptures,
heaven and earth bowed in reverence;
when the Divine Empyrean bestowed its registers,
the netherworld opened its passes to clear the Way.
We, who have long been counted among the true companions,
have presumptuously received the shade of the Dao.
Thus, we ought to guard the Yellow Court and repose within,
inwardly nurturing spirit and form;
to feast on the pure fluid and immerse in study,
outwardly eliminating desires and cravings.
Reverently bearing the imperial mandate, we scrupulously perform our rites.

We humbly beseech that the Dao’s intent shine forth,
the imperial heart deign to regard us.
Bestow the Jade Clarity’s precious registers, refining the body with golden fluid;
confer the Golden Tower’s jade texts, recording names on the Cinnabar Terrace.
Above, we pray for the Earthly Palace;
below, for the imperial presence.
May she grasp the dragon-script, ascend the phoenix-chariot,
enter directly the realm of pure emptiness,
soar to the Great Desert’s expanse.
May she be ranked among the Perfected Immortals,
her name inscribed in the Purple Registers.
Feasting by the Jasper Pool, drifting in radiance,
dwelling in the Flowery Tower, delighting in spirit—
may she realize the Dao in nonaction,
transcend existence to attain the highest.
Above, may the Heavenly Worthy’s great compassion manifest;
below, may our supplications’ sincerity be fulfilled.

Respectfully submitted for your august attention.

Twelve Vows:
First, may celestial grace descend universally;
second, may the talismanic mandate spread afar;
third, may the numinous altar be solemn and vigilant;
fourth, may the myriad saints attend the throne;
fifth, may the thousand Perfected pay homage;
sixth, may the ten thousand qi unite in transcendence;
seventh, may the dead rise from their corpses;
eighth, may beings be delivered to the Southern Palace;
ninth, may heaven be clear and qi bright;
tenth, may rivers and seas be tranquil;
eleventh, may the turning wheel attain the Dao;
twelfth, may all ascend to the Upper Clarity.

The incense-brazier is sealed as before.
Exiting the hall.

The Rite of Noon Audience on the First Day of the Jade Register Grand Fast is concluded. The Rite of Evening Audience on the First Day of the Jade Register Grand Fast begins. Each pays homage to the masters, contemplating as prescribed. Divine radiance shines brightly; auspicious qi swirls in abundance. The Winnowing Basket and Dipper gleam in splendor; the hall of mushrooms stands serene. Jade eyes hold truth; the sacred altar is pure and undefiled. Night is transformed into day; the hour returns to noon. The Great Flower scatters pearls; the cinnabar phoenix soars in mystery. Demons are stilled and treachery extinguished; one strides high through auspicious mist. Heavenly Perfected gather universally, all arriving before the Emperor.

The incense-brazier is sealed as before.
Invoking the Dharma Titles.

We, the assembled officials and altar-attending multitude, with utmost sincerity jointly address the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Void and Spontaneous, the Limitless Great Dao, the Most High Lord of the Dao, the Most High Lord Lao, the August Jade Emperor, the perfected and sagely hosts of the ten directions who have attained the Dao, the Lords of the Thirty-Two Heavens, the Jade Void Emperor, the Great Emperor of Jade, the Eastern Flower, Southern Culmen, Western Numinous, Northern Perfected, and the Golden Towers of the Seven Treasures in the Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace of the Jade Capital, the Sovereign of the Numinous Treasure and Perfected Radiant August Dao, the thirty-six divisions of revered scriptures, the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center, the High Ministers, High Stewards, High Protectors, High Tutors, the Twenty-Four Perfected of the Great Peace’s Lower Teaching, the Lord King of Total Perfection of the Western City, the Perfected of the Great One, the High Minister of Life of the Eastern Marchmount, the Two Perfected Lords Mao who determine records and protect life, the divine immortals who have attained the Dao in the sacred mountains and grotto-heavens, the officials of the Three Realms, and all true numina.

We have heard that the threefold treasury of radiance establishes the root of heaven in primordial chaos; the one spirit conceals its subtlety, spanning countless kalpas in the vast expanse. The Dao reaches the profound mystery; its principle is subtle in the great desert. Without form or trace, it seems to exist yet not exist. It embraces the myriad images to congeal essence, suffuses the nine suns to inaugurate kalpas. Dispersing the qi of dark tranquility and mystery, it crowns the cinnabar clouds; initiating the sound of flourishing emptiness, it inaugurates the jade calendar. What it naturally transforms is without pattern yet luminous.

We, by karmic affinity of former lives, have presumptuously received the numinous assembly. Secretly revering the divine chapters, we leap with joy, gazing afar to contemplate the Perfected. By the great Brahma’s generation and transformation, we diligently cultivate and expound the teachings. In all that we address, we dare not fail to make known.

The intent of the fast and the blue-green memorial shall now be solemnly proclaimed.

Proclamation:
As the words declare, without transgressing sincerity. We beseech the Great Dao to distinguish and grant our prayers.

We have heard that the Dao opened the five kalpas, floating radiance in the empty vastness; the Dharma emerged from the three vehicles, manifesting deliverance within the dark and hidden. Constantly pure, constantly still, it is called sagely, called divine.

We reverently undertake the pure fast, first entering the tranquil night. The divine wind is hushed; the river’s source irrigates the blossoms of the Eastern Well. The jade firmament revolves in splendor; the stone’s shadow emits the essence of the dark yin. Welcoming the host of immortals to extend their shade, gathering the nine qi to contain mist.

Respectfully transmitting incense, we undertake the fast’s vigil. On this evening as we perform the Dao, we, the Dharma assembly, now offer the first pinch of incense. May this incense smoke ascend to space, directly offering to the Void, Perfected, Spontaneous, and Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Great Dao.

May the merit of this pinch of incense extend above to bless the present emperor, bestowing boundless fortune. We humbly pray that the Dao harmonize the three subtleties, that he personally receive a hundred blessings. May he abundantly and grandly receive the emperor’s grace without end; majestically and augustly, may he bear the celestial favor ever increasing. May he firmly receive the protection of a hundred million years, eternally bearing the title of the Nine-Five fortune. May the four seas be united, the eight directions settled in submission.

Now we burn incense, from revering the Dao, the honored and sagely hosts, the Perfected’s virtue, to attaining the Dao thereafter, preserving heaven’s long endurance.

We have heard that in the distant and formless, the spirit returns to the court of wondrous existence; in the sudden forgetting of form, the Dao abides in the realm of perfect emptiness. Having earnestly contemplated in silence, our sincere hearts are truly aligned.

On this evening as we perform the Dao, we, the Dharma assembly, now offer the second pinch of incense. May this incense smoke ascend to space, directly offering to the Jade Dawn, Perfected, Spontaneous, Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Great Dao.

May the merit of this pinch of incense extend above to aid the invoked divine forms. We humbly pray that they refine their substance in the void, congeal their spirits in primordial simplicity. On the cinnabar terrace, the registers are examined, loftily inscribing the record of accumulated goodness; in the purple palace, merits are declared, ascending to the ranks of the highest immortals. May abundant great fortune flourish, protecting the state and the household. May blessings descend upon the heir’s palace, securing peace throughout the realm. May the hundred officials be pure and bright, enabling the six domains to prosper. May the imperial enterprise be eternally assisted, its favored emoluments ever increasing.

Now, therefore, we burn incense, taking refuge from the scriptural Honored Ones, the Great Sage Assembly, and the virtue of the Perfected, who, having attained the Dao, ascended into formlessness.

We have heard that accumulating merit across vast kalpas arises from broadly delivering humans and devas; advancing through the immortal ranks lies in universally aiding the hidden and the manifest. Thus do we magnify the true teachings and unfold the mysterious power.

At this hour of dusk, as we perform the Dao, we, the Dharma assembly, offer this third pinch of incense. May its fragrant smoke ascend directly to reverently present itself before the Primordial Great Sage, Spontaneous Transforming Lord, Heavenly Worthy of Dao and Virtue.

May the merit of this pinch of incense extend above to aid our ancestral sages and the august spirits of the altars and soil. We humbly pray that they ascend to the Jade Capital, their forms soaring amid emerald radiance. Returning to the origin and restoring the root, may they achieve immortality through the ninefold refinement; uniting with the wondrous and attaining the real, may they join the Dao amid the eight celestial stems, feast upon celestial tones within the numinous palace, and spread the imperial mat upon the mud-pill palace.

May the Great Monad assist their essence, and may the Lord Emperor confer their immortal ranks. Thus do we earnestly wish that they bear the precious registers and ascend into the Golden Gates; that they repose in the jade chariot and ascend directly to the Jasper Terrace. May fortune flow through the state’s destiny, and may grace extend throughout the realm.

Now, therefore, we burn incense, taking refuge in our teacher, the Honored Ones, the Great Sage Assembly, and the virtue of the Perfected, who, having attained the Dao, ascended into formlessness.

We repent. Thrice we invoke.

Thrice we bow. Once more we proclaim the dharma-ranks. All present—those who stand before the altar and the assembled officials—earnestly join in reverence to address the Three Clarities Most Revered, the Ten Directions’ August Sages, the Heavenly Perfected of Jade Capital and Golden Gates, the Celestial Emperors, the Ten Directions’ Honored Teachers and Sacred Assemblies, the officials of the Three Realms, and all numinous powers.

We have heard that in the Ritual Chamber of the Three Realms, one offers pure vows to atone for three transgressions; that with the ninefold yang’s talismanic script, one bridges the dark vastness of the Nine Netherworlds. We, who have long planted the roots of blessedness and early became heirs of the Mysterious, ought to let all dust-born defilements cease, serenely observing the thousand-day fast; to cultivate practice ten thousand times over, enduring the numinous gaze of the Nine Heavens.

Having pledged the oath of cinnabar-drinking, how dare we forget the covenant of the inscribed registers? We rescue beings and ferry souls, accumulating merit and amassing deeds. Now, in accordance with the edict received, we call to mind the divine spirits. We humbly beseech the Celestial Emperor to bestow compassion, the Lofty Perfected to peer with penetrating insight. May grace flow from the Southern Culmen, refining our forms with golden elixir; may commands issue from the Eastern Florescence, allowing us to be reviewed in the jade registers of the Perfected.

May we ascend to the Wandering Park of the Gods, repose in the Flowering Chambers, wander at ease in the realm of purity and stillness, and roam and feast in the boundless expanse of emptiness. Thus shall the great transformation of the Most High Heavenly Worthy be made manifest above, and the sincerity of our refuge and devotion be fulfilled below. We respectfully submit this entreaty for your hearing.

May the first vow bring forth universal radiance of compassionate light,
May the second vow cause the sun of wisdom to cast its beams,
May the third vow extend Heaven’s grace to all beings,
May the fourth vow lead to awakening in the Dao of non-action,
May the fifth vow grant the mandate of the Azure Flower,
May the sixth vow allow feasting upon the Cinnabar Terrace,
May the seventh vow elevate the spirit to the Purple Culmen,
May the eighth vow let the phoenix chariot hover and linger,
May the ninth vow prolong the nation’s fortune and reign,
May the tenth vow enable ascent to the summit of Penglai,
May the eleventh vow summon the myriad Perfected to descend and witness,
May the twelfth vow permit advancement upon the jasper steps.

The furnace rites proceed as before.
Thanksgiving to the Master.
Return to the curtained enclosure.

The first evening rites of the Jade Register Grand Fast conclude.
The second morning audience rites of the Jade Register Grand Fast begin.

All pay homage to the Master, contemplating as prescribed:

The five stars cast their numinous radiance,
illuminating the cinnabar court with resplendent light.
Encompassing all without exception,
they unite the qi of the host of spirits.
Concealing form in profound silence,
they traverse the Five Classics.
Displaying might to outshine the sun,
they command the officers of the celestial stems and branches.
They repel calamities and dispel misfortune,
cleansing filth and dissolving baleful influences.
The myriad demons tremble in terror,
dragons and tigers take flight in haste.
Purple clouds interlace and enfold,
as the ten thousand qi converge as one.

The Dharma Drum is sounded twenty-four times.

O Most High Three Heavens, Mysterious Primordial Three Qi, Supreme Lord Lao:
Summon forth the Three and Five Merit Officers within my body,
the Attendant Messengers of the Left and Right,
the Golden Lads bearing incense on the left and right,
the Jade Maidens scattering flowers to convey words,
the Thirty-Six Fragrance Officers of the Five Thearchs’ Direct Talismans and Direct Days.

Let them emerge—
adorned in solemn attire, resplendent in vestments,
crowns and sashes with pendent cords.

Summon the Land Spirits of the Mysterious Altar,
the Divine Perfected of the directional domains.

This morning, as I ascend the altar to perform the Dao,
to pay audience to the Imperial Perfected,
I humbly present my sincerest intentions,
all duly recorded in sealed documents.

May the numinous radiance of the Supreme Perfected Dao,
the luminous treasure of the Lingbao,
descend and flow into our bodies.
May the sincerity of our entreaty swiftly ascend,
reaching the presence of the Most High,
the Boundless Dao of the Three Clarities,
the August Celestial Worthy,
the Jade Emperor of the Golden Gates of the Heavenly Palace.

Invoking the Dharma ranks:

Together with the assembled officials and altar participants,
we reverently and with one heart address our entreaty to:
the Primordial Celestial Worthy of the Void and Spontaneous,
the Boundless Dao, the Supreme Lord of the Dao,
Lord Lao the Supreme,
the August Jade Emperor,
the host of Great Sages who have attained the Dao in the Ten Directions,
the Perfected Lords and Venerable Masters,
the Lords of the Thirty-Two Heavens,
the Jade Void Emperor,
the Jade Emperor and Great Emperor,
the Eastern Florescence, Southern Culmen, Western Numinosity, Northern Perfection,
the Golden Gates of the Jasper Capital, the Seven-Treasure Jeweled Terrace of the Purple Tenuity Upper Palace,
the Numinous Treasure Supreme Illustrious Sovereign of the Dao,
the Thirty-Six Divisions of the Venerable Scriptures,
the Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Center,
the Supreme Ministers, Supreme Chancellors,
Supreme Protectors, Supreme Preceptors,
the Twenty-Four Perfected of the Great Peace Lower Teaching,
the King of the Total Perfected of the Western Citadel,
the Perfected of the Great One,
the Supreme Minister of the Eastern Marchmount, Controller of Destinies,
the Two Perfected Lords Mao, Regulators of Records and Protectors of Life,
the Divine Immortals who have attained the Dao in the sacred mountains and grotto-heavens,
and all the Perfected Spirits of the Three Realms and their official retinues.

I have heard that the Four Symbols sigh in vastness, concealing the Great Void within the Primordial Grotto; the Nine Suns scatter their radiance, suffusing wondrous qi amidst the blossoms of Brahmā. Azure mists spread in array, while dark essences stretch into the distant. The Three Luminaries interpenetrate, nurturing the myriad beings. At the dawn of the Dragon-Han, the Celestial Charts were unfurled; from the transformations of the Primordial Azure, all things arose. The Heavenly Treasures emerged as scriptures to transmit through the world, their divine chapters forming like blossoms; the Jade Clarity responded to its title, delivering humankind, its sacred scripts shimmering with numinous light. The true mechanism was revealed, and the Orthodox Dao flowed forth.

We, your servants, have fortuitously aligned with the Mysterious Chart and gained participation in the lofty model. Relying on the jadelike countenance to inspire wondrous resonance, we turn to attend the morning audience; contemplating the pearl-like utterance to concentrate the spirit, we reverently proclaim the Dharma rites. Whatever we venture to present, we dare not withhold. The intent of the purification rite and the blue-green memorial shall be respectfully declared.

**Proclamation of the Memorial**
As stated in the memorial, without deviation from its earnest sincerity.

We humbly beseech the Most High to distinguish and heed our supplications.

I have heard that formless and shadowless, the divine wind is still and silent, yet illumines the vast firmament; as if present, as if absent, the Four Qi shine brightly, equalizing all in distant harmony. The host of demons bow their heads, and the myriad sages attend the audience.

We, your servants, discerning the signs and refining our thoughts, face the dawn in reverent audience. As the pure wind arises at daybreak, we gaze upon the numinous radiance just ascending; as the Yellow Path begins to shine, we witness the full subjugation of the yin hosts. Precious qi floats in the void above the dark throne; auspicious mists rise high amidst the Great Veil.

Reverently transmitting the incense, we undertake the purification vigil. On this second day at dawn, as we perform the Dao-circulation, we invite the Dharma assembly to offer the first pinch of incense. May this incense smoke ascend directly to offer homage to the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Dao, the Natural and Most Real, the Great Dao of the Void.

May the merit of this pinch of incense extend upward to bless the present emperor, that his august mandate endure without end. We humbly pray that through ten thousand years, his virtue may illumine the four quarters. May the Red Crow stream through the palace, continuing the flourishing of the Fire Mandate; may the divine horse emerge from the river, truly manifesting the auspiciousness of the Heavenly Scriptures. May he be born in harmony with the numinous and grasp the sacred, eternally receiving the registers and charts. May the imperial destiny prosper and flourish, favored by the August Heaven. May propitious omens converge and auspicious blessings all arrive.

Thus we now burn incense, from our refuge in the Dao-Worthy, the Great Sage Assembly, and the virtue of the Perfected, that after attaining the Dao, we may pray for the eternal endurance of Heaven.

I have heard that the Perfect Dao bestows its precepts, and the phoenix scripts descend upon the realm of Pure Subtlety; the Primordial August One promulgates his teachings, and the dragon charts float in the azure vastness of the Empyrean. Universally aiding the hidden and manifest, all equally receive blessings and protection.

On this second day at dawn, as we perform the Dao-circulation, we invite the Dharma assembly to offer the second pinch of incense. May this incense smoke ascend directly to offer homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the Numinous Treasure, the Most Sagely and Natural, the Great Dao of Jade Clarity.

May the merit of this pinch of incense extend upward to benefit the spirits we commend. We humbly pray that they may feast in the Jade Capital, advancing through the ranks of the sacred canon. Facing the August Void to receive the Dao, may they ascend the jade steps to attain Perfection. May they dwell forever in carefree ease, abiding eternally in supreme bliss. May they draw from the immortal streams of the Silver River and pluck the celestial blossoms of the Jasper Garden. May their influence moisten the nine provinces and their fragrance transmit through ten thousand generations.

Thus we now burn incense, from our refuge in the Scripture-Worthy, the Great Sage Assembly, and the virtue of the Perfected, that after attaining the Dao, they may ascend into the formless.

I have heard that ever-responsive and ever-quiescent, the numinous light pervades all, and the ten thousand practices are all enacted; perfectly quiescent and perfectly penetrating, the nectar of wisdom universally moistens, and the nine springs are equally succored. The Dao’s compassion is vast, and its supreme virtue all-embracing.

On this second day at dawn, as we perform the Dao-circulation, we invite the Dharma assembly to offer the third pinch of incense. May this incense smoke ascend directly to offer homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the Dao and Virtue, the Natural Transformer, the Great Sage of the Primordial Chaos.

May the merit of this pinch of incense extend upward to benefit the spirits we commend. We humbly pray that they may soar high in the Great Veil and mystically commune with the formless. Drifting in ethereal purity, may they refine their true selves in the courtyard of flowing fire; luxuriant as jade blossoms, may they bear fruit in the halls of the Azure Empyrean. Responding to the numinous charts and riding the currents, may they merge with the empty and cavernous to generate the divine. May the Perfected of the Upper Realms turn their light, and the divine lords gather their radiance. May they transcend to realize the true and constant, and equal the years of Heaven and Earth.

Thus we now burn incense, from our refuge in the Preceptor-Worthy, the Great Sage Assembly, and the virtue of the Perfected, that after attaining the Dao, they may ascend into the formless.

**Confession**
Threefold invocation.

**Threefold Prostration**

Repeatedly invoking the sacred ranks, we, the assembled officiants and attending officials, with utmost sincerity jointly address the Three Clarities Most High, the Perfected of the Ten Directions, the Celestial Worthies of the Jade Capital and Golden Gates, the Venerable Masters and Sacred Assemblies of the Ten Directions, the divine ministers of the Three Realms, and all numinous powers.

We have heard that tenfold circumambulation summons the Perfected from the Azure Vault, and the opening of the Nine Dark Realms delivers consciousness to ascend as immortals. We, undeservingly bathed in the mystic stream and privy to this auspicious gathering, ought to cast off form and renounce cunning, awakening to the mutual forgetting of self and principle; abide in stillness to attain emptiness, and refine body and spirit to soar aloft. Early did we receive the central covenant and bear its registers, vowing to propagate the Great Dharma and deliver beings. Though our merits are meager, they slightly aid the mysterious transformation. Moreover, we humbly undertake this rite in reverent observance.

Yet we fear our precepts are lax and virtue shallow, our learning slight and talents feeble. We have presumptuously violated the statutes—we can only hope for leniency. May you, in your compassion, heed our entreaties and grant your scrutiny. Bestow the talismanic mandates of the Azure Palace, open the way for the divine forms of those we commend, and guide them directly into the Grand Clarity to attain perfection and realize the Dao. Thus shall the luminous transformation of the Heavenly Worthy’s great compassion be manifest above, and our devotion in taking refuge be fulfilled below.

We respectfully submit this petition.

First, may numinous radiance descend to illumine;
Second, may the moon of the Dao shine forth in splendor;
Third, may grace extend through the Nine Lands;
Fourth, may sincerity reach the Nine Heavens;
Fifth, may all true spirits convene;
Sixth, may the Dao-qi pervade all;
Seventh, may the heavens open wide;
Eighth, may hells be shattered and overthrown;
Ninth, may mysterious merit spread universally;
Tenth, may they ride the light and soar through emptiness;
Eleventh, may all under heaven embrace virtue;
Twelfth, may the Dao unite with non-action.

Replenishing the censer, we visualize the spirits and burn incense.

Incense Official Messengers, Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, and all Attending Incense Spirits—may this place where we have this morning ascended the altar to perform the Dao now naturally generate golden liquid, cinnabar, azure mushrooms, and divine herbs. May the hundred spirits and host of perfected beings convene here before the incense burner.

We pray that the jade maidens and immortal youths of the ten directions receive this orchid-scented smoke and swiftly transmit the sincerity of our petition directly upward to the Most Perfect and Boundless Dao, the Three Clarities’ August Saints, and the Supreme August Jade Emperor of the Golden Portal before the Celestial Throne.

The second day’s early rite of the Jade Register Grand Retreat now concludes.
The second day’s noon audience rite begins.

All ritual masters, maintain visualization as prescribed:
Within the Yellow Center, summon qi to sever demonic traces and extinguish their trails.
Suppress the sources of evil;
cut off the lineages of demons.
By the Talismanic Mandate of the Most High, summon and command the divine lords.
May all spirits heed this call, averting misfortune and dispelling calamity.
Five qi and three wheels penetrate the true wind;
the Purple Portal unites with jade, and the Six Perfections know no end.
To the left, command the Azure Waist;
to the right, summon the Mushroom Youths.
Wandering freely, riding the radiant light, they govern the Nine Empyreans.
The Mysterious Altar responds to the moment, riding the qi in empty ascension.
May the myriad perfected descend universally, delivering and saving without end.

Ignite the censer as in the morning audience.
Invite the recitation of the dharma ranks.

We, the assembled officiants and altar-attending officials, together with utmost sincerity, reverently address and invoke:
The Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Void and Spontaneous,
The Boundless Dao’s Most High Dao Lord,
The Most High Lord Lao,
The August Jade Emperor on High,
The host of great sage perfected beings of the ten directions who have attained the Dao,
The Lords and Venerables of the Thirty-Two Heavens,
The Jade Void Emperor,
The Great Emperor of the Jade Emperor,
The Eastern Flower, Southern Culmen, Western Numinous, and Northern Perfected,
The Golden Portal and Seven-Jewel Jeweled Terrace of the Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace,
The Numinous Treasure Perfected Illustrious Sovereign of the Dao,
The thirty-six divisions of revered scriptures,
The Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Center,
The Supreme Ministers, Supreme Chancellors, Supreme Protectors, and Supreme Tutors,
The Twenty-Four Perfected of the Great Peace’s Lesser Teaching,
The King of Total Perfection of the Western City,
The Perfected of the Great One,
The Supreme Minister of the Eastern Marchmount and Controller of Destiny,
The Two Perfected Lords Mao, Regulators of Records and Protectors of Life,
The divine immortals who have attained the Dao in the grotto-heavens and named mountains,
The officials and attendants of the Three Realms,
and all true spirits.

We have heard that when the Five Perfections congeal essence, they foreshadow the ancestral radiance of cinnabar;
when the Three Yangs conceal their subtlety, they elude the bounds of kalpas past.
Vast and formless, secluded and imageless,
they coalesce the primordial qi of the numinous Brahman and initiate divine movement in the Crimson Clarity.
Unfolding the Five Chapters, they pervade the ten thousand models.
The Numinous Treasure emerges from the mysteries of the golden script, its phoenix chronicle circulating;
the Cavernous Mystery suspends the brilliance of jade graphs, its dragon script securely established.
Delivering boundless beings, preserving heaven’s enduring existence.

We, unworthy heirs of the immortal lineage, have presumptuously received the Orthodox Unity.
Floating on vermilion blossoms, we inherit blessings, chanting and intoning the jade sounds;
transmitting talismans and registers among the named mountains, we observe and cultivate the precious models.
In all matters we address, how dare we not report them above?

The blue-green memorial of the retreat’s intent shall now be solemnly proclaimed.
Proclaim the memorial.

As stated in the memorial’s words, without deviation from its earnest entreaties.
We beseech the Great Dao to distinguish and heed our piteous prayers.

We have heard that the Golden Writ of the Supreme Ultimate soars as the treasure of the Twofold Mystery’s perfected essence;
the Purple Radiance and Jade Splendor flow as the light of the Nine Empyreans’ divine realm.
Dragons crouch and tigers leap; phoenixes soar and simurghs dance.

We, by day, receive the true spirits; at noon, we approach the altar’s precincts.
The yang essence shines in its correctness, measuring the gnomon’s shadow to align with the center;
the radiant brilliance unfurls its light, gazing upon the cinnabar orb before its decline.

We draw forth the saints of the Dharma Realm’s emptiness and gather the fragrant smoke of the numinous wind’s exuberance.
Respectfully relying on the transmission of incense, we undertake the retreat’s observances.

At this midday performance of the Dao, we, the assembled dharma hosts, now offer the first pinch of incense.
May this incense smoke ascend to the heavens, directly offering reverence to the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Void, the Most Perfect and Spontaneous Great Dao.

May the merit of this pinch of incense ascend to bless the present emperor, that his sagely longevity know no bounds.
We humbly pray that he eternally govern the Nine Palaces, fully receiving the Five Fortunes.
Clothed in dignity, he brings order, long presiding over the southern-facing court;
abiding in correctness, embodying the origin, he steadfastly guards the northern star’s domain.
Treading the supreme position with enduring vision, he preserves the glory of the imperial line without end.
The imperial mandate daily renews; the divine foundation towers in heaven.
Pacifying the Four Seas, he grandly extends the myriad years.

Now, as we burn this incense, from our taking refuge in the Dao’s august sagely host of perfected beings and their virtue, to their attainment of the Dao, we pray for heaven’s enduring existence.

We have heard that the Golden Portal and Jade Chamber store the secret of the precious coffer’s jade tablets;
the Jasper Terrace and Vermilion Gardens reveal the auspiciousness of cloud scripts and rosy seal-characters.
Their light illumines the Nine Heavens; their brilliance hangs from the eight corners.

At this midday performance of the Dao, we, the assembled dharma hosts, now offer the second pinch of incense.
May this incense smoke ascend to the heavens, directly offering reverence to the Most Sagely and Spontaneous Numinous Treasure Great Dao Heavenly Worthy.

May the merit of this pinch of incense ascend to benefit the imperial lineage and ancestral branches.
We humbly pray that the Four Frontiers turn toward the wind, and all vassals admire righteousness.
Climbing mountains and sailing seas, all become tributary ministers;
from the tattooed tribes of Jiaozhi to the distant lands, all fulfill their duties of audience.
Exhausting heaven and earth’s covering and supporting, and the sun and moon’s illumination,
the myriad barbarians in caps and sashes, and the unified standards of cart and script,
all attain peace and tranquility, each realizing their life’s fulfillment.

Now, therefore, we burn incense, taking refuge from the scriptural venerables and the great sagely hosts, whose perfect virtue

Three Bows. Once more proclaiming the sacred ranks, we, the assembled officiants and all present before the altar, with utmost

We, the officiants of this rite and all assembled before the altar, with reverent unity do hereby address and invoke:

The Boundless and Self-So Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Void and the Natural,
The Supreme Dao Lord of the Limitless Great Dao,
The Most High Lord Lao,
The August Jade Emperor,
The perfected and holy sages of the ten directions who have attained the Dao,
The True Lords and Venerable Ones,
The thirty-two Heavenly Emperors,
The Jade Purity Highest Emperor,
The Great Emperor of the Jade Capital,
The Eastern Flower, Southern Culmen, Western Numinous, and Northern True Realms,
The Seven-Treasured Jeweled Terrace of the Purple Tenuity Upper Palace,
The Numinous Treasure Perfected Radiant August Dao Lord of the Jade Metropolis Golden Portal,
The thirty-six sacred scriptures of the supreme canons,
The Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Center,
The High Ministers, High Stewards, High Protectors, and High Tutors,
The twenty-four Perfected of the Great Peace’s lower teachings,
The Sovereign Perfected King of the Western Citadel,
The Perfected of the Great One,
The High Minister of Life of the Eastern Marchmount,
The Two Perfected Lords Mao—Keepers of the Register and Guardians of Destiny,
The divine immortals who have attained the Dao in the sacred mountains and grotto-heavens,
The officials and attendants of the Three Realms,
And all true numina.

We have heard that the Six Harmonies conceal their forms, concealing the primordial qi of the hidden and blended numinous ancestor; the Five Yangs weave the warp of the cosmos, unfolding the luminous heaven of Brahma’s treasures. Radiance illumines the distant and obscure; brilliance soars in dazzling splendor. Far-reaching, it embraces the Nine Poles; in totality, it governs the Three Luminaries. It inaugurated the kalpic destiny of the Highest Antiquity and responded to the numinous chart of the Great Ultimate. It divided the immortal realms of the cavernous divine and inspired the texts of transformation and life; it produced the sacred talismans of the divine treasures, floating in the void and forming their sigils. It propelled the tally of the celestial reckoning and thereby delivered the people of heaven.

We, unworthy as we are to stand upon the ranks of the perfected, have presumptuously wandered within the arcane teachings. We have drifted upon the wondrous scene of the Yellow Flower and concentrated our gaze upon the sacred texts; we have unfurled the purple bamboo slips of the profound and obscure and followed the regulations and precepts. In all that we now present, we dare not withhold it from the hearing of the Most High. The intent of this fast is expressed in the blue-green memorial, which we now humbly proclaim.

Proclamation of the Memorial
As the words of the memorial declare, without deviation from our earnest supplication:

We implore the Great Dao to distinguish and heed our sorrowful entreaty.

We have heard that the Mysterious Portal of the Jade Purity nurtures the essence of the three luminaries’ souls and spirits; the Golden Realm of the Purple Clarity floats the purest qi of the ninefold yin and yang. It communicates with the divine and enters quiescence, summoning the true and drawing forth the numinous.

We, with reverent devotion, have diligently cultivated the wondrous teachings on this propitious night. Concealing the clouds and veiling the obscurities, we have spread the four seasons to illumine the clarity; revolving the Dipper and traversing the Winnowing Basket, we have received the three luminaries in resplendent brilliance. The precious canopy commands the chariots of the host of perfected; the jade censer emits the nine-colored smoke.

With respectful reliance upon the transmission of incense, we undertake the fast and vigil. At this hour of the setting sun and the performance of the Dao, we, the assembled officiants of the Dharma, now offer the first pinch of incense.

May this incense smoke ascend directly into the void to offer reverent devotion to the Boundless and Self-So True and Natural Great Dao, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy.

May the merit of this pinch of incense extend upward to bless the present emperor, that his sagely longevity be without end. We humbly pray that the five phases maintain their order, the six pitch-pipes harmonize their qi. May the sun and rain be timely, aligning the seven regulators’ jade pivots; may there be neither scorching heat nor freezing cold, harmonizing the four seasons’ jade candles. May yin and yang unite in virtue, matching the sun and moon in shared radiance. May the world’s paths be greatly pacified, the years yield abundant harvests. May he share the heavens’ eternity, his mandate flourishing and renewed.

For this purpose, we now burn incense, from our reverent devotion to the Dao, the honored and sagely host, the virtue of the perfected and true, that after attaining the Dao, we may pray for the heavens’ enduring presence.

We have heard that the texts of planting completion in heaven and earth bring protection to the family and peace to the state; the transformation and nurturing of yin and yang establish the models for delivering the dead and saving the living. The record-keepers of the heavens and the myriad sages attend the imperial throne.

At this hour of the setting sun and the performance of the Dao, we, the assembled officiants of the Dharma, now offer the second pinch of incense.

May this incense smoke ascend directly into the void to offer reverent devotion to the Jade Dawn Perfected and Sagely Natural Numinous Treasure Great Dao Heavenly Worthy.

May the merit of this pinch of incense flow to the Three Wretched Paths, the Nine Nights, the Six Destinies, and the Four Modes of Birth. May all evil roots be extinguished, and all beings depart from suffering and distress. May they congeal the embryo and return the qi, together ascending to the Azure Empyrean; may they change their substance and shed their forms, all ascending to the Crimson Mound’s precincts. May the dead souls receive refinement and attain immortal transformation to become human. May retribution cease and enmity be resolved. May they transcend the Three Realms and roam freely in the Nine Clarities.

For this purpose, we now burn incense, from our reverent devotion to the scriptures, the honored and sagely host, the virtue of the perfected and true, that after attaining the Dao, we may ascend into the formless.

We have heard that the Great Dao unfolds in silence, thus revealing its scriptures of compassion; the True Origin emerges from the realm of form, thereby bestowing its methods of salvation and deliverance. Through past and present, humans and gods alike have relied upon and revered it.

At this hour of the setting sun and the performance of the Dao, we, the assembled officiants of the Dharma, now offer the third pinch of incense.

May this incense smoke ascend directly into the void to offer reverent devotion to the Primordial Great Sage, the Natural Transformer and Lord of the Dao and its Virtue, the Heavenly Worthy.

May the merit of this pinch of incense extend upward to aid the spirits for whom this rite is offered. We humbly pray that they may forever depart from the clamor of the dust and eternally leave the realm of form. May they congeal the embryo and sever stagnation, containing the harmonious fusion of the primordial qi; may they blend transformation and engender the divine, nurturing the celestial perfected within the mysterious clarity. May they return to their original essence and refine their essence, awakening to the forgetting of both principle and self. May they drift upon the scene of the cavernous void, dispersing their thoughts in the radiance of the clouds. May they roam freely in their numinous chariots, feasting and wandering in the Upper Capital.

For this purpose, we now burn incense, from our reverent devotion to the masters, the honored and sagely host, the virtue of the perfected and true, that after attaining the Dao, we may ascend into the formless.

Repentance
Threefold Invocation.

**Threefold Prostration**

Reverently invoking the sacred ranks, we, the assembled officiants and all present at this altar, with unified sincerity, now supplicate the Three Clarities Most Exalted, the August Jade Capital and Golden Portals of the Heavenly Emperors and Perfected Ones of the Ten Directions, the Venerable Hosts of Masters from all quarters, the divine officials of the Three Realms, and all majestic numina.

We have heard that the Six Transgressions subdue demons, receiving the mandate to escort and welcome; the Three Primes’ precepts of discipline prescribe the rites of purificatory bathing and bodily refinement. We, undeserving, have bathed in the mystic stream and been graced with the company of the numinous. Thus, we ought to wear the Central Yellow within to nurture and irrigate the Cinnabar Field; to congeal the Primal Simplicity in lofty contemplation and imbibe the Jade Fluid. Early we don the register of ascension to the Perfected, and transmit the scriptures for dispelling defilement. Vowing to deliver the sunken and obscured, we pledge to magnify purity and stillness. Moreover, in reverent compliance with the written command, we now conduct this rite.

Today, we humbly offer this supplication on behalf of the wandering souls and stagnant spirits who, from past lives to this present existence, have erred in thought and deed. Moved by emotion, they transgressed, failing to cultivate sincere kindness and compliance, or to steadfastly uphold gentleness. Unmindful of the Three Precepts’ appointed times, they indulged in quarrels; heedless of a moment’s wrath, they forgot themselves. Yielding to fury, they bullied others; relying on brute strength, they oppressed the weak. Their hearts harbored wrathful natures, their mouths spewed vicious words. Accumulating transgressions and nurturing wrongs, they neglected to cultivate the Real and uphold the precepts. Fearful of karmic retribution, uncertain of their ascent or descent, we now beseech deliverance, relying upon this solemn rite. Without washing away the old to renew, how may they ascend the void and enter the wondrous?

We implore the gracious descent of beneficent radiance, the secret infusion of merciful waves. We command the Generals of the Nine Phoenixes, the Lads of the Five Numinosities, the Officers of Summoning Souls, the Lords of Dispelling Defilement, the Lady of Ablution, the Jade Maidens of Yellow Splendor—pray take the Divine Water of the Great Mystery, refine the corpse’s plain broth, the Golden Fluid of Sweet Dew, the Cloud Fat of Jade Nectar. Blend and harmonize the true qi, that it may flow into the fragrant bath; wash away the toil of dust and wholly dissolve the yin shadows. May their ethereal souls be clarified and rectified, their natures and perceptions perfectly luminous. Bathe the Five Sprouts, align the Eight Effulgences. Adorn them with caps, sashes, hairpins, and pendants; clothe them in the regalia of feathered splendor. Let them tread the Nine Numinosities, escape the Five Turbidities. Extinguish the Three Wretched Paths and cleanse their sins; proclaim the Six Bowels and generate their fluids. Sever the root of earthly attachment, purge the corpse’s defilements. Forever dispel burning afflictions, universally attain cool purity. Renew the old and transform it, wash away flaws and polish grime. Ascend in substance to the realm of lofty brilliance, delight the spirit in the capital of mysterious clarity. Forever depart the dusty world, together ascend the shore of the Dao. Thus shall the transforming grace of the Most High Heavenly Worthy be manifest above, and the sincerity of our devotion be fulfilled below.

Ten Invocations:
First invocation: One Real arrays the scene;
Second invocation: Two Images return and incline;
Third invocation: Three Exalted Ones reflect and illumine;
Fourth invocation: Four qi harmonize and level;
Fifth invocation: Five Scriptures blaze resplendent;
Sixth invocation: Six Graces shine in unison;
Seventh invocation: Seven Luminaries converge in auspiciousness;
Eighth invocation: Eight Trigrams thrive in uprightness;
Ninth invocation: Nine Lights revolve and encircle;
Tenth invocation: Souls and spirits ascend in flight.

**Replenishing the Censer, Together with the Early Audience**

The second evening audience of the *Jade Register Grand Fast* concludes.

---

**Jade Register Grand Fast: Third Day Early Audience Rite**

Each pays homage to the masters, contemplating as prescribed.

The Heavenly Writs remit sins, descending from the Great Tenuity. The Primal Transformation engenders and completes, the numinous smoke coils ninefold. Eight Effulgences and Six Circuits, the sacred course upheld—on the left, the Red Quarter receives guests; on the right, the Imperial Portal opens. The Eastern Flower and Southern Mansion refine and dispel wrong. The Wheel turns with the sun’s radiance, the gaze shifts with the moon’s splendor. Today is a great celebration, myriad paths converge as one. The true qi of the Mystic Altar preserves Heaven’s undiminished majesty. Universally proclaimed to the Three Realms, swift as dragons and winds.

**Strike the Dharma Drum Twenty-Four Times**

O Most High Three Heavens, Primal Origin, Three Qi, Most High Lord Lao: summon forth from within our bodies the Three and Five Merit Officers, the Left and Right Attendants, the Left and Right Golden Lads bearing incense, the Jade Maidens scattering flowers, the Five Thearchs’ Direct Messengers, the Incense Officials of the Day—thirty-six each, let them emerge. Emerging, let them be arrayed in solemn attire, caps and sashes with pendent cords. We now invoke the local deities and territorial Perfected of the Mystic Altar. Today, at this early audience, we ascend the altar to perform the Dao, to pay homage to the Imperial Perfected. Humbly we present our intentions and sincerities, all inscribed in sealed documents. May the numinous radiance of the Most High Perfected, the true qi of the Numinous Treasure, descend and flow into our bodies, that our supplications may swiftly reach the presence of the Most High, Boundless, Great Dao’s Three Clarities and August Saints, the Most Exalted Jade Emperor of the Golden Portals of the August Heaven.

**Invoking the Sacred Ranks**

We, the assembled officiants and all present at this altar, with unified sincerity, now supplicate the Heavenly Worthy of the Void and Spontaneity, the Primordial Origin; the Most High Lord of the Dao, the Boundless Great Dao; the Most High Lord Lao; the August Jade Emperor; the Great Sage Hosts of the Ten Directions who have attained the Dao; the Perfected Lords and Masters; the Thirty-Two Heavenly Emperors; the Jade Tenuity Most High; the Great Emperor of the Jade Capital; the Eastern Flower, Southern Culmen, Western Numinosity, Northern Perfection, and the Golden Portals of the Seven Treasures’ Jeweled Terrace of the Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace; the Numinous Treasure Most High, Illustrious Sovereign of the Dao; the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures; the Great Dharma Masters of the Mystic Center; the Supreme Ministers, Prime Ministers, Supreme Protectors, and Supreme Tutors; the Twenty-Four Perfected of the Great Peace’s Lesser Teaching; the King of Total Perfection of the Western City; the Perfected of the Great Unity; the Supreme Minister of the Eastern Marchmount and Controller of Destinies; the Two Perfected Lords Mao, Regulators of Records and Protectors of Life; the divine immortals who have attained the Dao in the named mountains and grotto-heavens; the divine officials of the Three Realms; and all true numina.

We have heard that the Seven Simplicities revolve, presaging the division of the Seven Yangs; the Five Primes unite, illuminating the Five Wefts to ride the heavens.

The Essence stores the subtle and profound, floating high in the pure void. It gathers the qi of the divine blossoms, initiating the radiance of the luminous light. Accumulated titles extend prosperity, unfolding through countless kalpas. It records the jade calendar of the Primordial Numen, congealing into scripture; it unfolds the treasure chapters of the Yellow and Lao, with talismanic seals of emptiness and effulgence. The Eight Potencies settle in tranquility, and the myriad treasures come into being.

We, who hold humble positions in the Mystic Gate and are listed in the Purple Registers, partake in the natural Dao of the Golden Towers, meditating in stillness upon the Perfected; we receive the texts of the Great Existence from brocade pouches, reverently adhering to their precepts. In all matters of memorials and petitions, how dare we not make them known? With sincere intent in our blue-green memorials, we dutifully proclaim and present them.

**Proclamation of the Memorial:**
As stated in the memorial’s intent, we do not deviate from its earnest supplication. We beseech the Great Dao to discern our humble prayers.

We have heard that the Profoundly Quiescent Primordial Honored One governs the Clear and Subtle without dominion; soothing and pacifying the Nine Domains, treading the mysterious workings with impartiality. It broadly bestows the causes of the wondrous Dao, and the hardships of the Supreme Ultimate’s hidden paths.

We, awaiting the dawn, preserve the spirits; at daybreak, we practice the Dao. Purple auroras illuminate the sun as the Azure Dragon first ascends Fusang; crimson radiance streams across the sky as the Solar Chariot journeys through the Eastern Land. The whirlwind returns the wheel to the true realm, and clouds gather like canopies in the Great Void. Reverently transmitting incense, we undertake the fast with devotion.

On this third day at dawn, as we practice the Dao, we invite the assembly of the Dharma to offer the first pinch of incense. May the smoke of this incense ascend directly to offer reverence to the Primordial Honored One of the Void and Perfected, the Natural Great Dao, the Celestial Worthy of Original Beginning.

May the merit of this pinch of incense extend upward to bless the present Emperor, that his august mandate endure without end. We humbly pray that he receive a hundred auspices and align with the Seven Governors. May auspicious grain and vermilion herbs repeatedly bring harmony to the earth’s treasures; may sweet dew and propitious stars manifest the heavens’ blessings. May dragon-horses come from the Western Limits, and phoenixes gather in the Purple Court. May all blessings be fully bestowed, and the Four Spirits assemble. May precious talismans arrive in abundance, and harmonious qi flow everywhere.

Thus, we now burn incense, from our devotion to the Dao, the Venerable, the Great Sage Assembly, and the Perfected’s virtue. After attaining the Dao, we pray for the heavens’ eternal preservation.

We have heard that the Jade Slips bestow texts, serving as the model for humans and devas; the Golden Perfected expound the teachings, becoming the bridge across birth and death. The merit of the wondrous existence is vast, and the transformations beyond naming are profound.

On this third day at dawn, as we practice the Dao, we invite the assembly of the Dharma to offer the second pinch of incense. May the smoke of this incense ascend directly to offer reverence to the Celestial Worthy of the Jade Dawn, the Perfected and Natural Numinous Treasure, the Great Dao, the Celestial Worthy.

May the merit of this pinch of incense extend upward to aid the spirit of [Name]. We humbly pray that the Nine Mysteries and Seven Ancestors, and the karmic kin of countless kalpas, may together ride the vast auroras and soar through the empty caverns. May they ascend to Perfection and awaken to the Dao, accompanying the Nine Elders in roaming; may they refine the mysterious and temper the true, joining the Ten Flowers in chanting and singing. May they sever the summons of the demon officials and cross over to the Upper Southern Palace; may they endure through kalpas, long preserved, and attain deliverance in body. May blessings flow to descendants and felicity extend to clan and kin.

Now, therefore, we kindle incense and take refuge in the scriptures, the Venerable, the Great Sage Hosts, and the virtue of the Perfected, who, having attained the Dao, ascend into formlessness.

We have heard that the sagely virtue, all-embracing, inscribes the Jade Register of Prolonged Life; the Dao’s compassion, boundless in love, unfolds the Mystic Writ of Fallen Death. It revolves yin and yang, presiding over the workings of creation.

On this third day at dawn’s rite of the Dao, we invite the Dharma assembly to offer this third pinch of incense. May its fragrant smoke ascend through the void to directly present offerings to the Primordial Great Sage, the Natural Sovereign of Transformations, the Celestial Worthy of Dao and Virtue.

May the merit of this pinch of incense extend upward to aid the spirit thus invoked. We humbly pray that the ranks of Perfected Immortals may gather, their qi returning to the Brahmā’s retinue. May they delight in distant contemplation, veiled by the verdant radiance of luxuriant leaves; may they raise their sleeves in lofty ascent, listening to the wondrous strains of the jade chambers. May they rest in the shade of limpid, cool isles, and ride the wheel upon the profound and boundless thoroughfare. May they gird themselves with renewed openness, partaking in the numinous transformations. May their luminous souls follow their original nature, their mysterious union without limit.

Now, therefore, we kindle incense and take refuge in the Preceptor, the Venerable, the Great Sage Hosts, and the virtue of the Perfected, who, having attained the Dao, ascend into formlessness.

Repentance—thrice invoked.

Thrice we bow in reverence. Again invoking the sacred ranks, we, the assembled officiants and all present before the altar, with one heart and sincere devotion, reverently address the Three Purest Venerables, the Ten Directions’ Most Sagely Ones, the Heavenly Emperors and Perfected of the Jade Capital and Golden Towers, the Master Hosts of the Ten Directions, the divine assemblies of the Three Realms, and all numinous powers.

We have heard that when the Seven Gates of transgression are opened, the stellar lodges shine bright and still the shadows; when the Nine Yangs conjoin their qi, form and spirit are refined and ascend at dawn. We, from early days, have admired the path of pure cultivation and gained access to its profound mysteries. Thus should we nurture the embryonic infant in simplicity, sitting in attainment of the natural; merge the qi of all life into the body, personally practicing inner refinement. Yet, not having reached the realm of spirit-transformation, we must apply diligent effort. We vow to guide and receive all beings, pledging to propagate the great teaching. Moreover, in accordance with the sacred command, we reverently perform this ritual.

Now, on behalf of [Name of the Deceased], from past lives to the present incarnation, in thought and deed, by intention or error, we acknowledge faults and transgressions. Unable to maintain unwavering sincerity or steadfastly uphold gentleness and goodness, lacking the sincerity of self-reflection and failing to observe the precepts of Perfected attainment, we fear returning to the human realm, long submerged in worldly toil. Unable to preserve life and cherish the spirit, we reach death’s dissolution without regard. Enmeshed in sound and form, we depart from our original true nature, causing the qi of life to lose its flow and the roots of death to bind and stagnate.

We beseech refinement and deliverance, that all may universally attain ascension. May the Three Purest Venerables look upon living beings with compassion and broadly bestow their mysterious grace. We invoke the Lads of the Nine Lights and entreat the Divine Lords of the Five Ancients. We spread the five-colored essence as nectar and pour forth the qi of the Nine Yangs. Flames of flowing fire bathe us, and we are cleansed in the yellow blossoms. We further invoke the Hundred-Tempered Vajras and the Thousand-Harmonized Jade Liquor. The Primordial Sovereign scatters wondrous essence, and the Great White streams forth radiance. We proclaim the opening of the womb’s source, dissolving knots and obstructions, blending spirit and substance, refining body and mind. May the viscera be cooled and cleansed, the hun and shen settled and pacified. May the bones return from death, the yin transform into yang. We again command the celestial physicians’ messengers to scatter the divine medicines of the Great Purity. Thus may the soul receive refinement and the immortal transformation be renewed. Riding the Nine Qi to form the body, receiving nurture from the Three Origins, the Three Passes and Five Viscera, the Six Palaces and Nine Palaces, the original gods of life and the roots of destiny are restored. United with the numinous and relinquishing breath, all in the womb attain birth and completion; withered bones and dry skeletons exchange their substance and are universally delivered.

May this manifest the great compassion of the Heavenly Worthy above and fulfill our devotion in taking refuge below.

Respectfully we make this entreaty known.

First, may the heavens be clear and the qi bright;
Second, may the sun shine and the moon attend;
Third, may auspicious stars appear;
Fourth, may the Dharma-rain fall abundantly;
Fifth, may karmic grievances cease their opposition;
Sixth, may suffering and lamentation be stilled;
Seventh, may dragon-script dance in flight;
Eighth, may phoenix-seals flow like molten gold;
Ninth, may the Perfected and Numinous descend and gather;
Tenth, may blessings extend to the hidden and the departed;
Eleventh, may all souls be universally delivered;
Twelfth, may all ascend with ease.

The incense is renewed. With focused spirit, we burn the incense.

Fragrant Bureau Envoys, Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, and all Attending Fragrant Spirit-Officials—may this place where we have this morning ascended the altar to perform the Dao now spontaneously generate golden liquid, cinnabar, azure mushrooms, and divine herbs. May the hundred numinous Perfected gather here before the incense burner.

We pray that the jade maidens and immortal youths of the ten directions receive the orchid-scented smoke and swiftly convey the sincerity of our supplications directly to the presence of the Most Real and Boundless Dao’s Three Clarities, the August Celestial Venerables, and the Jade Emperor of the Golden Gates of the Supreme Heavenly Honored One.

The third-day morning audience of the Great Register Purification Rite is now concluded.

All pay homage to the masters and maintain contemplation according to the method.

The Primordial Sovereign of the Void, gathering qi, abides at the center.
The three realms stretch into profound obscurity, giving rise to the vault of heaven.
Seven revolutions and nine numina merge and return with the wind.
Transforming into myriad spirits, heaven and earth open and connect.
On this auspicious day, the rite is performed—ten thousand demons submit in reverence.
Morning radiance shines brightly as the primordial work is silently enacted.
Holding the tally and raising the banner, flowers scatter across the great void.
The ten directions are universally delivered; kalpas endure without end.

The incense is kindled, as in the morning audience.

We now declare the dharma-positions.

We, the assembled officiants and altar-attending assembly, respectfully unite in sincerity above.

We now invoke the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Void and Spontaneous Dao, the Boundless Great Dao and Supreme Lord of the Dao, the Supreme Lord Lao, the August Jade Emperor, the perfected and sagely hosts of the ten directions who have attained the Dao, the perfected lords and venerable masters, the thirty-two Heavenly Lords, the Jade Sovereign of the Void, the Great Jade Emperor, the Eastern Florescence and Southern Culmen, the Western Numinous and Northern Perfected, the Mystic Capital and Golden Portals of the Seven-Jewel Jeweled Terrace, the Purple Tenuity and Upper Palace, the Numinous Treasure and Perfected Radiant Sovereign of the Dao, the thirty-six revered scriptures, the Great Dharma Masters of the Mystic Center, the High Ministers and High Chancellors, the High Protectors and High Tutors, the twenty-four perfected of the Great Peace’s lower teachings, the King of Total Perfection of the Western City, the Perfected of the Great One, the High Minister of the Eastern Peak and Controller of Destiny, the Two Perfected Lords Mao of the Register of Life, the divine immortals who have attained the Dao in the grotto-heavens and sacred mountains, the officials of the three realms, and all true numina.

We have heard that the eight luminous scenes conceal their radiance, merging the Great Obscurity with the colorless; the single yang accumulates qi, congealing the Brahma-chaos in the primordial origin. The first sprouting of the light of the upper scene thus responds to the title of the Kaihuang era. Mystic essence emits its brilliance, forming images and flowing into shapes. When the five kalpas had run their course, the nine heavens and eight transformations saw the Primordial Beginning first enfeoffed in the Purple Canon; the celestial patterns were displayed, and the august person inscribed the statutes in jade tablets. Holding fast to the kalpas’ turning, all demons submit in reverence, and the myriad states enjoy peace.

We, unworthy though we are to stand among the perfected, have long received the shelter of their wondrous grace. Bearing the nine-colored round image, we swallow the fluids and hold the visualization; chanting the numinous chapters of the Three Unions, we follow the regulations and uphold them. In all that we now declare, how dare we not make it known? The green-worded memorial of our fast’s intent shall now be respectfully proclaimed.

Proclamation:
As the words declare, without deviation from our earnest supplication, we humbly beseech the Great Dao to distinguish and heed our prayers.

We have heard that the solitary revelation of the original true nature saves all sentient beings across ten thousand kalpas; the vast proclamation of wondrous transformation delivers the nine dark realms of suffering without bound. Hidden and manifest alike flourish, and humans and heavens alike depend upon it.

We, reverently adhering to the fast’s rites, have not paused even to eat. The yang-crystal turns the candle as we approach the first moment of midday; the brilliance of the day’s light ascends, and all gaze upon the illumination of the zenith. The green chariot tilts its light and returns; purple smoke forms talismanic script and floats in the void. With reverence we borrow the transmission of incense to perform the fast’s duties.

On this third day, at the midpoint of the circuit, we invite the dharma assembly to offer the first pinch of incense. May this incense smoke ascend directly to offer homage to the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Void, the Spontaneous, and the True Great Dao.

By the merit of this pinch of incense, we pray for the long and boundless mandate of the present emperor. May his transformation reach the eight borders and his teachings extend to the six directions. May golden harvests correspond to the signs, and the threefold abundance be recorded as a year of great plenty; may the royal way be rightly illuminated, and a thousand years enjoy the fortune of great peace. May the sun’s image shine with doubled radiance, and the stars manifest their orderly auspices. May the seas be calm and the rivers clear, clouds move and rain fall. May the ten thousand regions rejoice, and the four seas know no peril.

For this purpose we now burn incense, from our refuge in the virtue of the Dao, the venerable sagely hosts, and the perfected, that after attaining the Dao, they may long endure in heaven.

We have heard that the Yuluo Xiaotai is the transformed realm of the Three Clarities; the scriptures of the Mystic Teachings emerged from the five kalpas. Thus the true is eternally preserved, and heaven’s protection knows no limit.

On this third day, at the midpoint of the circuit, we invite the dharma assembly to offer the second pinch of incense. May this incense smoke ascend directly to offer homage to the Jade Dawn, the Most Sagely, the Spontaneous, and the Numinous Treasure Great Dao Heavenly Worthy.

By the merit of this pinch of incense, we pray for the imperial line and the ancestral branches. May names be inscribed on the azure tablets and recorded in the cinnabar registers. May numinous radiance shine forth in the realm of longevity, adding distant years; may the foundation of fortune be as firm as the kalpa-stone, eternally securing favor and emolument. May the union of great harmony endure, and the preservation of true qi long sustain. May descendants flourish and multiply, and affinal kin live in harmony.

For this purpose we now burn incense, from our refuge in the virtue of the scriptures, the venerable sagely hosts, and the perfected, that after attaining the Dao, they may ascend into the formless.

We have heard that the Beginning Azure inaugurated the turning, the Three Perfected all appeared, and the Dao and virtue were perfectly communicated; the Numinous Treasure delivers living beings, and the ten thousand qi long endure, while souls and spirits become clear and upright. The work is subtle and wondrous, and forms respond in an instant.

On this third day, at the midpoint of the circuit, we invite the dharma assembly to offer the third pinch of incense. May this incense smoke ascend directly to offer homage to the Primordial Great Sage, the Spontaneous Transformer, and the Heavenly Worthy of the Dao and its Power.

By the merit of this pinch of incense, we pray for the spirits being offered to. May they rest in clarity and ease, moving with leisure in the empty and wondrous. May the cloud thoroughfares shine with radiance, transcending the four great elements in the divine realm; may the empty void flow with sound, departing the nine mysteries of the dark borders. May their hearts scatter above the layered heavens, and their qi congeal within the flowery palaces. May they unfasten their robes and loosen their sashes, free in coming and going. May they fly and wander at will, responding to stimuli without limit.

For this purpose we now burn incense, from our refuge in the virtue of the masters, the venerable sagely hosts, and the perfected, that after attaining the Dao, they may ascend into the formless.

Repentance:
We now make the Threefold Invocation.

The Threefold Prostration. Again invoking the sacred ranks, we, the assembled officiants and altar attendants, with utmost sincerity jointly address the Three Pure Ones Most High, the Ten Directions’ Sagely Hosts, the Heavenly Perfected of Jade Capital and Golden Towers, the Ten Directions’ Venerable Masters and Holy Assemblies, the officials and spirits of the Three Realms, and all majestic numina.

We have heard that when the dark night parts to reveal light, eight transgressions are purified through earnest recitation; when the dead souls undergo refinement, the Nine Mysteries ascend and transform to be reborn. We have been fortunate to encounter the true canon and early receive the secret registers. Thus we ought to bathe in the mystic waves of the immortal well, cleansing thoughts and clarifying the mind; to shelter beneath the sacred boughs of the numinous tree, returning to the root and restoring life’s mandate. Though still bound by worldly affairs, how dare we slight the heart of the Dao?

Having received the masters’ covenant, we bear the duty of spreading the teachings. Moreover, entrusted with these sacred words, we reverently perform this ritual. Now we turn our thoughts to the wandering souls and lingering spirits, from past lives to the present incarnation. In every intention and emotion, they have erred and transgressed. Unable to cultivate warmth and reverence for the Dao, or humility in self-cultivation, they may have served the true and authentic yet harbored arrogance and neglect; or occupied high positions yet indulged in pride and excess. Some have bullied others with contempt, some boasted and relied on their own strength. Clinging to vicious traits and indulging haughty hearts, they have greatly deviated from the virtue of yielding and modesty, shaming the precepts of attaining the true.

We fear that upon their passing, their ascent or descent remains uncertain. We worry that through countless kalpas of rebirth, they drift from life to life, their souls adrift like waves, unable to return to their original root; their nature and consciousness benighted, still bound to perverse factions. Mired in the realms of suffering, they have not escaped the heavy yin. We beseech the grace of pardon, that they may soon fulfill their wish for rebirth.

May the supreme transformation of great compassion deliver the souls lost in the long night. May evil roots be dissolved, and transient spirits return to their origins. As they receive deliverance, may all ascend as immortals. We entreat the Five Venerable Lords of the Numinous, and command the Nine Heavens’ Emperors. We invoke the Three Luminaries and Nine Venerables, the Most High Elder, the Twelve Hundred Official Lords, the myriad layers of Dao-qi, the Benevolent Lord Han of the Southern Palace of the Vermilion Mound Fire Treasury, the Jade Casket Receiver of Deliverance Envoy Sima Yuanyang, the Life-Prolonging and Fate-Improving Deliverer from Tribulation, the Registrar Perfected, the Life-Monitoring Holy Mother, the Lord of Non-Duality, the White Prime Spirit.

Together with the Life-Extending and Health-Uniting Great Unity Lord of Destiny, we supplicate the divine presence. May the Nine Mysteries and Seven Ancestors respond with harmony and compliance. May they be escorted and welcomed, receive form through returning qi, and have their names inscribed and lifespans determined. May auspicious smoke block the gates of death and propitious clouds open the doors of life. May the roots of the numinous be gathered, and good fruits be perfected. Thus shall the transformation of the Most High Heavenly Worthy’s great compassion be made manifest above, and our devotion in taking refuge be answered below.

We reverently announce:

First, may the dragon-script shine resplendently;
Second, may the phoenix-tallies present auspicious signs;
Third, may the heavens’ registrars record all;
Fourth, may the immortal music resound;
Fifth, may the Three Officials inscribe good deeds;
Sixth, may the Nine Nights be suffused with light;
Seventh, may grievances be harmonized and debts closed;
Eighth, may knots be untied and calamities removed;
Ninth, may demons be subdued and merits secured;
Tenth, may souls be delivered to the immortal realms;
Eleventh, may the grace of enlightenment spread universally;
Twelfth, may the merit and power be immeasurable.

The incense is replenished, and the morning audience concludes.
The third-day noon audience of the Jade Register Grand Retreat is now complete.
