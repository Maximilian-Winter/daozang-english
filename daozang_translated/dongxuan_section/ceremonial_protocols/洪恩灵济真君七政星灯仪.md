**Rite of the Seven Luminaries’ Lamps for the Venerable Lord of Vast Grace and Numinous Salvation**
*Proceedings as Prescribed*

The Great Dao shines resplendent, its silent virtue ever-responsive.
With reverent care, every prayer finds its way.

Devoutly we kindle the true incense, offering with utmost sincerity:
To the Venerable Lord of Vast Grace—
Transcendent Immortal of the Golden Towers of the Nine Heavens, who embodies the Dao and manifests its power, whose numinous salvation pervades the Pure and Subtle, the Cavernous and Mysterious, the Void and Wondrous, whose compassion and kindness shield the realm and shelter the people;
To the Venerable Lord of Vast Grace—
Exalted Immortal of the Jade Towers of the Nine Heavens, who proclaims transformation and upholds the teaching, whose radiant and boundless salvation is vast and luminous, serene and profound, wondrously responsive, benevolent and merciful, aiding the realm and protecting the people;
And to all the divine immortals and spirit-officials of the Palace of Numinous Salvation, we make this common offering.

We humbly recall: when the Dragon Han first unfolded the cosmic pattern, the primordial qi of the Mysterious and Original divided. When the Turtle Peak first took form, the positions of Heaven, Earth, and Humanity were fixed.
Yet for mortals, the Great Dao is rarely encountered, and birth in the Middle Land is hard to attain. Endowed with yang and sustained by yin, with limbs properly aligned, one must esteem this form, preserve this life, and keep the myriad qi ever-abiding.
Yet all fear the sorrows of old age, sickness, and death, and each delights in longevity, growth, and beauty.
Human desires are many, but Heaven shows no partiality.
Why are some granted wealth while others suffer poverty?
Why does Pengzu enjoy longevity while Yanling meets an early end?
If not by the reckoning of fate, then seek the answer within yourself.

At that time, the Venerable Lord of Numinous Salvation, wandering in the sacred precincts of the Jade Clarity, in the radiance of the Emperor’s reign and the brilliance of Heaven’s mandate, established a great karmic connection and expounded for the assembly:
“The Five Celestial Bodies I govern—now waxing, now waning, never constant.
The Two Luminaries I traverse—now heat, now cold, in perfect order.”

To follow the Way brings prosperity and joy; to defy it invites calamity and sorrow. Only jade-like sincerity can move the gods, and thus the accumulation of good deeds must yield abundant blessings. Bathed in the radiance of your illumination, how dare we forget our humble gratitude?

On this day, the humble Daoist devotee [Name], reverently opens the sacred altar and presents modest offerings. In accordance with the Jade Calendar of Primordial Yang, we burn incense and recite scriptures. Following the Golden Precepts of the Numinous Treasure, we observe the fast and uphold the precepts. We illuminate the sacred texts and kindle the divine lamps. Gazing upward at the patterns of the celestial weave, we envision the image of the armillary sphere. The orchid incense burns bright—its flourishing seen, its waning unseen. The iron basin holds the oil—its increase visible, its depletion invisible. Above, it illumines the Thirty-Two Heavens with boundless light; below, it enables hundreds of thousands to behold, revere, and take refuge. From this light, all good arises; within this light, all evil perishes.

We bow once, then bow again, our devotion moving the divine. First we offer incense, then a second, then a third—each time, the jade-like voice rings clear. We look up, trusting in your all-seeing gaze, and humbly beseech your gracious radiance. May the Three Realms assemble, and the myriad gods give their assent. Let baleful stars retreat, so that through the four seasons, no harm nor disaster befalls. Let auspicious constellations descend, bestowing the Five Blessings: wealth and longevity.

We prostrate and take refuge in the Ever-Radiant Heavenly Worthy of the Most Wondrous Dao and Constant Virtue.

We, the ritual assembly, wholeheartedly take refuge and pledge ourselves to:
The Great Immortal of the Nine Heavens’ Golden Portal, Illuminator of the Dao and Attainer of Virtue, Manifest in Spirit, Universally Salvific, Pure and Subtle, Profound and Void, Wondrously Responsive, Compassionate and Benevolent, Protector of the Realm and Shelter of the People, Vastly Merciful Perfected Lord;
The Supreme Immortal of the Nine Heavens’ Jade Portal, Propagator of Transformation and Upholder of the Teachings, Illustrious in Spirit, Vastly Salvific, Lofty and Bright, Vast and Serene, Profound and Tranquil, Wondrously Responsive, Benevolent and Kind, Supporter of the Realm and Guardian of the People, Vastly Merciful Perfected Lord;
And all the divine officials of the Palace of Numinous Salvation.

We reverently kindle the Seven Luminaries’ Lamp of the Armillary Sphere, arraying above the image of the sun’s radiance.

We humbly recall: the Dao dwells in the beginning of the Great Ultimate—unseen in its concealment, yet manifest in its subtlety. The sun is the essence of all yang, fulfilling every aspiration and perceiving all that is hidden. Its mystery is unfathomable, its presence divine. Its majesty blazes forth, inspiring awe like Zhao Dun. Its brilliance shines above, and all people look up to it as they did to the Duke of Zhou. Its virtue radiates, vast and glorious; its purity gleams, bright as jade. The crow-wheel stands in solemn readiness, paying homage in the Palace of Resplendent Splendor. The chariot of Xi is adorned in majesty, feasting in the Hall of Penetrating Yang. It emits a thousand-yard halo, universally illuminating the Three Thousand Worlds. Entering our gate, no dwelling remains in shadowed doubt. Following our Way, the ailments of the dark path vanish.

We reflect upon all beings: lost in the dust, submerged in obscurity, they toil in vain pursuit of shadows; like lightning or dew, their splendor is fleeting, leaving only the lament of a fleeting moment. From this day forth, may they turn inward and abide in the constant brightness of the Dao.

We pray that those who dwell in markets may prosper in trade and commerce; those who labor in the fields may find peace in tilling and well-digging. May the skilled artisans measure shadows with jade; may the diligent craftsmen burn the midnight oil. May scholars compose verses of five-hued brilliance; may officials be honored as Eight-Brick Scholars. In the twilight of their years, may they rival the pine and cypress in endurance. May the glow of fireflies enhance their splendor, and may even the lowliest creatures share in their grace. With the devotion of sunflowers turning to the sun, may they receive the radiant reflection of your divine regard.

We, the ritual assembly, now reverently follow the incantation of the Sun Sovereign as taught by the Most High, prostrating in refuge and chanting with devotion:

Wholeheartedly we take refuge and sincerely worship:
The Great Immortal of the Nine Heavens’ Golden Portal, Illuminator of the Dao and Attainer of Virtue, Manifest in Spirit, Universally Salvific, Pure and Subtle, Profound and Void, Wondrously Responsive, Compassionate and Benevolent, Protector of the Realm and Shelter of the People, Vastly Merciful Perfected Lord.
Wholeheartedly we take refuge and sincerely worship:
The Supreme Immortal of the Nine Heavens’ Jade Portal, Propagator of Transformation and Upholder of the Teachings, Illustrious in Spirit, Vastly Salvific, Lofty and Bright, Vast and Serene, Profound and Tranquil, Wondrously Responsive, Benevolent and Kind, Supporter of the Realm and Guardian of the People, Vastly Merciful Perfected Lord.

We form the noon mudra, inhale the noon qi, and in distant contemplation, envision the Perfected Lord of the Palace of Resplendent Yang as if present.

Gazing east toward the Fusang Palace, we prostrate and pay homage to the Resplendent One:
O radiant sun of the cavernous brightness,
In boundless vastness, what thoughts arise?
Grant me the golden hue to worship,
Awaiting the celestial vision of your majestic form.
The imperial blossoms and jade maidens
Descend to the terrace at this very hour.

*Response:* May the light of this lamp be dedicated to the Perfected Lord.
Scatter flowers to the Heavenly Worthy of the Great Illumination and Ultimate Perfection.

We, the ritual assembly, wholeheartedly take refuge and pledge ourselves to:
The Great Immortal of the Nine Heavens’ Golden Portal, Illuminator of the Dao and Attainer of Virtue, Manifest in Spirit, Universally Salvific, Pure and Subtle, Profound and Void, Wondrously Responsive, Compassionate and Benevolent, Protector of the Realm and Shelter of the People, Vastly Merciful Perfected Lord;
The Supreme Immortal of the Nine Heavens’ Jade Portal, Propagator of Transformation and Upholder of the Teachings, Illustrious in Spirit, Vastly Salvific, Lofty and Bright, Vast and Serene, Profound and Tranquil, Wondrously Responsive, Benevolent and Kind, Supporter of the Realm and Guardian of the People, Vastly Merciful Perfected Lord;
And all the divine officials of the Palace of Numinous Salvation.

We reverently kindle the Seven Luminaries’ Lamp of the Armillary Sphere, arraying above the image of the moon’s radiance.

We humbly recall: the ancestral qi resides in the vastness of the Great Void, formless and without trace. The moon’s essence suffuses the tenfold splendor of the flowers, endowed with nature and sentiment. It traverses the Winnowing Basket and stirs the wind; it departs from the Net and brings forth rain—such is the work of Heaven, divine and luminous. It treads the eight myriad and three thousand gates of the Toad Palace, its pure light ready to be drawn. It gazes upon the Crane Terrace, where after fifteen hundred years, the sacred traces remain. When Liu Yue stone repelled the barbarian siege, his aspiration to ascend the tower was fulfilled. When Cao Mengde achieved hegemony, what hindered him from strumming the zither and singing? At times, its essence congealed to bestow the Han’s tally; at others, its reflection conferred the Wu’s auspice. Its name is pure and bright, its achievements illustrious.

We reflect upon all beings: lurking in shadowed caves, stealing light, cloaked in dust and nurturing obscurity. They conceal their faults and magnify their virtues—how can they avoid the transgressions of blemish and flaw? They embellish their errors and disguise their wrongs—how can they escape the sins of murkiness and delusion? We now humbly offer our gratitude, fortunate to behold this radiance.

We pray that in the marshes where swans gather, there may be no fear of crows taking flight; within the borders where the cock crows, there may be no worry of oxen panting. May those who pound the hare’s elixir attain longevity; may those who gather the oyster’s pearl acquire wealth.

May those who enter officialdom early pass the selection of the Moon Goddess; may those who arrange marriages see their unions fulfilled as the Old Man of the Southern Dipper foretold. When the Jade Light appears, may it bring the conception of fine sons; when the Jade Axe is wielded, may craftsmanship attain exquisite skill. Bowing in wait for the Weaver Maid to mark the sundial, we humbly confess our shame before Venus’s raised cup.

We, the assembled ritualists, now reverently follow the divine incantation of the Supreme Yin Sovereign as taught by the Most High, prostrating in devotion and chanting with sincere praise:

With wholehearted devotion, we take refuge and bow in reverence to the Nine Heavens’ Golden Portal, Radiant Dao and Penetrating Virtue, Great Immortal Manifesting Numinous Grace, Universally Salvific, Pure and Subtle, Cavernously Mysterious, Profoundly Void, Wondrously Responsive, Compassionate and Benevolent, Protector of the State and Shelter of the People, Vastly Merciful Perfected Lord.

With wholehearted devotion, we take refuge and bow in reverence to the Nine Heavens’ Jade Portal, Propagating Transformation and Upholding the Teachings, Supreme Immortal of Illustrious Numinosity, Vastly Salvific, Lofty and Illuminating, Vastly Tranquil, Profoundly Serene, Wondrously Responsive, Benevolent and Kind, Assistant to the State and Guardian of the People, Vastly Merciful Perfected Lord.

Before reciting the incantation, we inhale the unspoken qi and visualize the Perfected Lords of the Cavernous Yin Palace of Radiant Essence as though present.

Gazing upward to survey the eight directions, we see the moon pregnant with yin essence.
Within it dwells the Primordial Sovereign,
Her Ladyship riding a chariot of green.
Her luminous splendor illumines the Two Poles,
Her blended radiance shines through the Three Pure Realms.
Earnestly seeking the Supreme Dao,
The Five Colors descend to welcome her.

*Response:* May this lamp’s light be dedicated to the Perfected Lords.

Scattering flowers—
The Round Mirror illumines the Cavernous Heavenly Worthy.

We, the assembled ritualists, with wholehearted devotion, take refuge and bow in reverence to:
The Nine Heavens’ Golden Portal, Radiant Dao and Penetrating Virtue, Great Immortal Manifesting Numinous Grace, Universally Salvific, Pure and Subtle, Cavernously Mysterious, Profoundly Void, Wondrously Responsive, Compassionate and Benevolent, Protector of the State and Shelter of the People, Vastly Merciful Perfected Lord;
The Nine Heavens’ Jade Portal, Propagating Transformation and Upholding the Teachings, Supreme Immortal of Illustrious Numinosity, Vastly Salvific, Lofty and Illuminating, Vastly Tranquil, Profoundly Serene, Wondrously Responsive, Benevolent and Kind, Assistant to the State and Guardian of the People, Vastly Merciful Perfected Lord;
and all the divine immortals and spirit officials of the Numinous Salvation Palace.

We reverently kindle the Seven Luminaries’ astral lamp, arranging above it the eastern image of the Wood Power and Jupiter.

We have heard that the heart of the Dao is singular, so profound and silent that it defies description. The spirit of Wood embodies benevolence, its wondrous transformations ceaselessly giving rise to life. In time, it is spring, and the spring winds nurture all; in virtue, it is the Primal, and the primal qi forms the embryo. Though all equally receive its sustaining power, they still depend on its pruning and shaping force. Gazing up at the lofty mountain, all under heaven feel the same awe.

Xie Shi obtained it and revealed the numinous power of the Eight Lords; the Duke of Zhou obtained it and dispelled the slander of the golden casket. When the plum was used to soothe Shun, he dreamed of seeking the worthy in the wilds; when the mulberry was gathered, Yi Yin was divinely appointed at Xin. Their achievements stood towering in their time, their names fragrant through ten thousand generations.

We reflect upon all beings: clinging to stumps and content with their lot, overreaching their station in seeking shade. Though their talents be as coarse as the oak or the catalpa, dull and unadorned, yet like the willow or the mulberry, their nature may be fashioned into cups and bowls. When guided by the marking-line, they become straight; without the carpenter’s square, no shape is formed.

We pray that those who hold office may display the elegance of the thorn-elm; that those who hear lawsuits may govern with the kindness of the sweet pear. Observing the way of the catalpa and the pagoda tree, may fathers be kind and sons filial; singing the poem of the flowering calyx, may elder brothers be friendly and younger brothers respectful. May those who bear sons wish them to be sagely youths, sprouting like the five-branched cassia; may those who form friendships seek ageless companions, towering like the thousand-year pine. May the peach blossom with its radiance bring harmony to home and household; may the autumn fruits be offered in reverence to honor ancestors and venerate forebears. Though we present the humble gift of dates and jujubes, it is not meant to rival the grand rite of burning offerings.

Let the Dharma assembly now reverently follow the divine incantation of the Star Lord of Wood Virtue as proclaimed by the Most High, bowing in homage and reciting with devout sincerity.

With wholehearted devotion, we take refuge and pay reverence:
To the Radiant Dao and Attained Virtue Great Immortal of the Nine Heavens’ Golden Palace, whose wondrous efficacy pervades the Pure Subtlety, Cavernous Mystery, and Void Wonder—Compassionate and Benevolent, Protector of the Realm and Shelter of the People, the Vastly Merciful Perfected Lord.

With wholehearted devotion, we take refuge and pay reverence:
To the Propagating Transformation and Upholding Teaching Supreme Immortal of the Nine Heavens’ Jade Palace, whose luminous majesty broadly aids the Lofty and Serene, the Profound and Tranquil—Responsive and Benevolent, Assistant of the Realm and Guardian of the People, the Vastly Merciful Perfected Lord.

Form the mudra of *yin* and *hai*, drawing the *qi* of *yin* and *hai*, and visualize the Perfected Lord of the Azure Flower Azure Heaven Palace as present.

The Year Star rides the virtue of Wood,
Extending its radiance to the eastern quarter.
Its celestial form exudes moisture and grace,
Its true hue illumines the August Emperor.
Seeking blossoms, it sings in boundless joy;
Casting waters, it chants in the chamber of mushrooms.
Through seasons of frequent prayers and rites,
Blessings naturally grow everlasting.

*Response:* May the light of these lamps be dedicated to the Perfected Lord.
*Scattering flowers:*
The Heavenly Worthy of Wondrous Wisdom and Perfect Clarity.

We, the Dharma assembly, with wholehearted devotion, prostrate and entreat:
The Radiant Dao and Attained Virtue Great Immortal of the Nine Heavens’ Golden Palace, whose wondrous efficacy pervades the Pure Subtlety, Cavernous Mystery, and Void Wonder—Compassionate and Benevolent, Protector of the Realm and Shelter of the People, the Vastly Merciful Perfected Lord;
The Propagating Transformation and Upholding Teaching Supreme Immortal of the Nine Heavens’ Jade Palace, whose luminous majesty broadly aids the Lofty and Serene, the Profound and Tranquil—Responsive and Benevolent, Assistant of the Realm and Guardian of the People, the Vastly Merciful Perfected Lord;
And all the divine immortals and spirit officials of the Palace of Numinous Aid.

We now solemnly kindle the stellar lamps of the Seven Governors, arraying above the symbol of the Fire Virtue’s Sparkling Deluder Star of the southern quarter.

We reverently recall that Fire holds the virtue of the southern quarter, where the Flame Emperor wields authority.
The spirit is lord of the Eastern Sea,
The Perfected One bestowed with title.
His essence is forged of jade,
His form tempered by golden elixir.
He studied the texts beyond the world,
His goodness like a shadow in light.
Responding to conditions, he transforms,
Vowing to deliver all beings.
He lifts the people from mire and fire,
Placing them in the comfort of their mats.
He pities the scorched and parched,
Turning their lot to songs of joy.
For laboring to pacify the realm,
The streaming crow presents auspicious omens.
In warding off calamity and disaster,
The Fire God reverses the winds.
His voice resounds in brilliance,
His majesty blazes in awe.

We reflect upon all beings:
Their desires yet unquenched,
Their study of the Dao unclear.
In their pursuit of power,
They cannot but fawn and flatter to seek favor.
In their schemes,
How dare they not resort to treachery and venom?
To quell boiling with more boiling—
How foolish!
To salvage what remains after the embers—
Is it not too late?
Fortunate are those who heed the warning
To bend the chimney and move the firewood,
For prevention is ever wise.
Yet when snow touches the red furnace,
One awakens to the moment of enlightenment.
Anxiety burns like smoke—
Who can grasp heat?
To claim wildfire can be extinguished—
How can one allow jade to burn with it?

We humbly pray:
May our weapons be stilled,
The alarms of wolf-smoke forever silenced.
May the people’s suffering be relieved,
Spared the labor of moxibustion’s cure.
Those who cook and boil
May find sustenance for life.
Those who gather firewood and tend hearths
May each secure their livelihood.
As Heaven observes the one virtue,
So it is said: Sincerity becomes clarity,
Clarity becomes sincerity.
Goodness brings forth a hundred blessings,
That you may flourish and prosper,
Prosper and flourish.
A single stick of heart-incense
May reach the azure vault.
The triple beams of divine light
Shall manifest upon the sacred altar.

Let the Dharma assembly now reverently follow the divine incantation of the Star Lord of Fire Virtue as proclaimed by the Most High, bowing in homage and reciting with devout sincerity.

With wholehearted devotion, we prostrate and entreat:
The Radiant Dao and Attained Virtue Great Immortal of the Nine Heavens’ Golden Palace, whose wondrous efficacy pervades the Pure Subtlety, Cavernous Mystery, and Void Wonder—Compassionate and Benevolent, Protector of the Realm and Shelter of the People, the Vastly Merciful Perfected Lord.

With wholehearted devotion, we prostrate and entreat:
The Propagating Transformation and Upholding Teaching Supreme Immortal of the Nine Heavens’ Jade Palace, whose luminous majesty broadly aids the Lofty and Serene, the Profound and Tranquil—Responsive and Benevolent, Assistant of the Realm and Guardian of the People, the Vastly Merciful Perfected Lord.

Form the mudra of *mao* and *xu*, drawing the *qi* of *mao* and *xu*, and visualize the Perfected Lord of the Vermilion Numinous Fire-Refining Palace as present.

Dragon and phoenix sprout pointed horns,
Their majestic light rebuking the ten directions.
Cinnabar strength gleams through five nights,
Vermilion fire flames along three edges.
Crystal clarity accords with the true *qi*,
Swords and halberds gleam with martial authority.
Swiftly they seize and extinguish traces,
Comets dare not advance.

*Response:* May the light of these lamps be dedicated to the Perfected Lord.
*Scattering flowers:*
The Heavenly Worthy of Radiant Wisdom Torch.

We, the Dharma assembly, with wholehearted devotion, prostrate and entreat:
The Radiant Dao and Attained Virtue Great Immortal of the Nine Heavens’ Golden Palace, whose wondrous efficacy pervades the Pure Subtlety, Cavernous Mystery, and Void Wonder—Compassionate and Benevolent, Protector of the Realm and Shelter of the People, the Vastly Merciful Perfected Lord;
The Propagating Transformation and Upholding Teaching Supreme Immortal of the Nine Heavens’ Jade Palace, whose luminous majesty broadly aids the Lofty and Serene, the Profound and Tranquil—Responsive and Benevolent, Assistant of the Realm and Guardian of the People, the Vastly Merciful Perfected Lord;
And all the divine immortals and spirit officials of the Palace of Numinous Aid.

We now solemnly kindle the stellar lamps of the Seven Governors, arraying above the symbol of the Metal Virtue’s Grand White Star of the western quarter.

We reverently recall that Metal conceives the essence of Grand White,
The western quarter bears its sign.
The spirit ranks among the Upper Clarity,
The Northern Dipper transforms his form.
His literary brilliance long shone on Mount Tiantai,
His origins trace to the Lishui’s flow.
His odes and hymns
Resound with melodious beauty.
His inscriptions on bells and tripods
Display unyielding integrity.
Li Shaojun thereby attained the elixir,
Fu Yue of Shang thereby sharpened his tools.
As a treasure, it is truly precious;
As an instrument, how could it be slighted?
The higher one gazes, the loftier it seems;
The deeper one delves, the firmer it proves.
Distinctly ordered,
Harmoniously reasoned.

We reflect upon all beings:
Aware of the four knowings, they feel shame,
Yet vainly admire Yang Zhen’s virtue.
Thrice invited, they prove incapable,
Idly envying the wealth of Tao Zhu.
From this day forward, let them reform—
Truly relying on the refining crucible.

We humbly pray:
May the fruits of our practice remain unburned,
Gladdened by the teachings of a full basket.
Though culture may seem lost,
Still we hear the ring of jade cast to earth.
Words that can be acted upon,
Names that can be spoken—
The promises of the people of Chu
Are as steadfast as Ji Bu’s.
Sages emulate Heaven,
The worthy emulate sages—
Confucius’ casting was not for Yan Hui alone.

Ashamed we lack the grand treasures to offer,
We present but humble ritual vessels.

Let the Dharma assembly now reverently follow the divine incantation of the Star Lord of Metal Virtue as proclaimed by the Most High, bowing in homage and reciting with devout sincerity.

With devout hearts we bow in homage and faith,
To the Great Immortal of the Nine Heavens’ Golden Portal,
Radiant in Dao, perfected in virtue,
Manifesting numinous power, universally saving,
Pure and subtle, penetrating the mysterious, empty and void,
Wondrously responsive, compassionate and kind,
Protecting the realm and sheltering the people—
True Lord of Vast Grace.

With devout hearts we bow in homage and faith,
To the Supreme Immortal of the Nine Heavens’ Jade Portal,
Proclaiming transformation and upholding the teachings,
Illustrious in spirit, broadly salvific,
Lofty and luminous, vast and tranquil,
Deeply serene, wondrously responsive,
Benevolent and kind,
Assisting the realm and aiding the people—
True Lord of Vast Grace.

Form the mudra of chén-xū,
Draw the qi of chén-xū,
Envision the True Lord of the Palace of Primordial Simplicity in the Golden Heavens as present.

Venerable Venus ascends the limpid Han,
Frost-borne, it gleams with pristine radiance.
Towering, it floats in auspicious splendor,
Resplendent, it exalts the Evening Star.
Its blade, lofty, can repel invaders,
Its hue, lustrous, often stays the armies.
Tracing the depths of celestial cycles,
It unites with the Dao and long life.

*Response:* May the light of these lamps be turned toward the True Lord.

Scatter blossoms—
The Luminous True One nurtures the Vast Heaven.

We, the Dharma assembly, with devout hearts prostrate ourselves in homage:
To the Great Immortal of the Nine Heavens’ Golden Portal,
Radiant in Dao, perfected in virtue,
Manifesting numinous power, universally saving,
Pure and subtle, penetrating the mysterious, empty and void,
Wondrously responsive, compassionate and kind,
Protecting the realm and sheltering the people—
True Lord of Vast Grace;
To the Supreme Immortal of the Nine Heavens’ Jade Portal,
Proclaiming transformation and upholding the teachings,
Illustrious in spirit, broadly salvific,
Lofty and luminous, vast and tranquil,
Deeply serene, wondrously responsive,
Benevolent and kind,
Assisting the realm and aiding the people—
True Lord of Vast Grace;
To the divine immortals and all spirit officials of the Palace of Numinous Salvation.

Reverently kindling the stellar lamps of the Seven Governors,
We array above the image of the Water Virtue’s Chen Star of the Northern Palace.

We humbly recall: the spirit of water is called Dark Mystery.
Its source is deep, its flow far-reaching.
Like water beneath the earth,
Where does it not reach? Where does it not pass?
Vast and boundless—how can I name it?
Abysmal and fathomless—truly beyond measure.
Speak of its benevolence: fish and turtles find their place.
Speak of its majesty: dragons revere its numen.
Flying sands and raging waves once revealed the dream of Three Mountains.
Rising clouds and bringing rain, all gaze upon the shrines of the Four Rivers.
Crossing the frozen Fen and Tuo, the words of kings and hegemons—how divine!
Leveling Huai and Cai with snow, Li Guang’s merit—was it not heaven-sent?
Equal in the grace of moistening and descending,
Dare we make our plea to the east?

We reflect with shame upon all beings:
At the Thieves’ Spring, they halt to slake their thirst—
What gluttony is beyond their ken?
The turbid Wei flows ever on,
Making foul and fetid all it touches.
We must cleanse and purify,
Lest we provoke vexation and excess.

We pray:
May the courts enjoy peace, pearls return to Hepu.
May talents flourish and endure, boats cross mighty rivers.
When mulberries in floating groves ripen, silkworms ascend.
When swords from Yanshi’s pool are sold, oxen may be raised.
May the wish for wealth and profit run deep as an abyss—
With abundance achieved, what more is needed? Let them be enriched.
May descendants thrive and prosper,
For after great virtue, there must be those who rise.
May the waves of grace overflow,
The sea of blessings vast and profound.
We offer but the rites of a humble stream,
Ashamed of our meager puddle’s inadequacy.

Let the Dharma assembly now reverently follow the divine incantation of the Star Lord of Water Virtue as proclaimed by the Most High, bowing in homage and reciting with devout sincerity.

With devout hearts we bow in homage and faith,
To the Great Immortal of the Nine Heavens’ Golden Portal,
Radiant in Dao, perfected in virtue,
Manifesting numinous power, universally saving,
Pure and subtle, penetrating the mysterious, empty and void,
Wondrously responsive, compassionate and kind,
Protecting the realm and sheltering the people—
True Lord of Vast Grace.

With devout hearts we bow in homage and faith,
To the Supreme Immortal of the Nine Heavens’ Jade Portal,
Proclaiming transformation and upholding the teachings,
Illustrious in spirit, broadly salvific,
Lofty and luminous, vast and tranquil,
Deeply serene, wondrously responsive,
Benevolent and kind,
Assisting the realm and aiding the people—
True Lord of Vast Grace.

Form the mudra of sì-shēn,
Draw the qi of sì-shēn,
Envision the True Lord of the Palace of Dark Numen and Great Virtue as present.

Wondrous! The talisman unites the five qi,
Topknots reveal the true gate.
Towering in the chǒu position,
Rén-Guǐ guards the numinous lord.
Its splendor congeals in purity,
Its subtle influences hasten to our thoughts.
With immortal songs and dancing Dao,
After long moments, descend from the golden heavens.

*Response:* May the light of these lamps be turned toward the True Lord.

Scatter blossoms—
The Dragon Virtue universally illuminates the Heavenly Venerable.

We, the Dharma assembly, with devout hearts prostrate ourselves in homage:
To the Great Immortal of the Nine Heavens’ Golden Portal,
Radiant in Dao, perfected in virtue,
Manifesting numinous power, universally saving,
Pure and subtle, penetrating the mysterious, empty and void,
Wondrously responsive, compassionate and kind,
Protecting the realm and sheltering the people—
True Lord of Vast Grace;
To the Supreme Immortal of the Nine Heavens’ Jade Portal,
Proclaiming transformation and upholding the teachings,
Illustrious in spirit, broadly salvific,
Lofty and luminous, vast and tranquil,
Deeply serene, wondrously responsive,
Benevolent and kind,
Assisting the realm and aiding the people—
True Lord of Vast Grace;
To the divine immortals and all spirit officials of the Palace of Numinous Salvation.

Reverently kindling the stellar lamps of the Seven Governors,
We array above the image of the Earth Virtue’s Zhen Star of the Central Palace.

We humbly recall: in she rites, earth is sacrificed to,
Fitting the harmony of Earth.
The spirit’s virtue accords with Heaven’s Dao.
Stone inscriptions herald auspices,
Yin and yang harmonize for the Tang house.
Clods in the wild present omens,
The gods lend aid to the Jin court.
When Qin took Shu, the omens of Baogu Valley were no mere marvel.
When Liu swallowed Huan, the Xianbei dream was no mere coincidence.
The filial son Zong buried his father here, revealing hidden merit.
The Iron-Wheel King made offerings here, fulfilling karmic fruit.
The great ship of governance may draw upon its weight.
Lu Jiang’s virtuous rule flows through ten thousand ages.
The sword of Lei Huan may gain luster.
The sacred traces of Huayin endure for a thousand years.
Mixing sand with wine, it once became a remedy for Lord Gao’s illness.
Forming dust into pills, it became Ge Xuan’s elixir to revive the dead.
With yellow as its virtue, its numen shines resplendent.

We reflect with shame upon all beings:
Ants in their holes cling to life, wall insects guard their dullness.
Evil abounds, good is scarce—
Is there no lack of even a single basket?
Revealing the past, knowing the future—
Can we escape the charge of a hundred generations?
This is but filth and muck—of what use is it?
Or is this mud and mire to be cast aside?

From this day forth, let us follow the true path in conduct,
Dare we not raise walls and offer reverence?

We pray:
May Mount Hua store its essence, so scholars may be born wise.
May gold hold equal value, so merchants may prosper in trade.
Let artisans refine their skills and reap their due.
Let the fat of the earth pulse, so farmers may toil in the fields.
Striking bells and sounding chimes, we offer but the rites of drum and mallet.
Pouring water and presenting flowers, we are ashamed of our lack of splendid tribute.

Let the assembly of dharma followers now reverently follow the divine incantation of the Star Lord of Earthly Virtue as proclaimed by the Most High, bowing in homage and reciting with devotion.

With sincere hearts we take refuge and pay reverence:
To the Radiant Dao and Penetrating Virtue Great Immortal of the Golden Towers of the Nine Heavens, whose wondrous responsiveness and boundless compassion protect the realm and shelter the people, the Vastly Benevolent Perfected Lord of Great Grace.

With sincere hearts we take refuge and pay reverence:
To the Propagating Transformation and Upholding the Dao High Immortal of the Jade Towers of the Nine Heavens, whose luminous efficacy and profound tranquility assist the realm and bless the people, the Vastly Benevolent Perfected Lord of Great Grace.

The incantation gathers the essence of zi and chou,
Drawing the qi of zi and chou,
Envisioning the Perfected Lord of the Yellow Center Palace of Primordial Qi as though present.

On high, the talisman aligns with wu and ji,
Concealed in the earth, it ascends through layered heavens.
The Five Phases honor the hidden luminaries,
The Nine Lands witness radiant illumination.
Gan and Shi discern the subtle and profound,
Tao and Wu calculate the deep and distant.
The High Immortals bestow rain and dew,
Prostrate upon the earth, we offer empty hymns.

In harmony we chant:
May this lamp’s light be dedicated to the Perfected Lord.

Scattering flowers:
The numinous light illumines the Heavenly Worthy.

Reciting the scripture and incantation,
The merit of kindling these lamps is now complete.

We reverently hear that observing celestial patterns reveals human affairs,
Thus enabling foreknowledge.
Cultivating human affairs in accord with celestial patterns,
All undertakings shall be auspicious.
We must rely on the divine lamps for illumination,
And depend on the ritual codes for proclamation.
Dedicating this to the Perfected Lord,
We humbly beseech your abundant blessings.
From this day forth, may your numinous power be greatly manifested.

We pray:
May stars gather in Kui,
That we may again witness a reign of literary brilliance.
May light suffuse the Bi,
That we may restore the purity of ancient times.
Above, embody the will of Heaven;
Below, fulfill the hopes of the people.
Furthermore, after kindling these lamps,
May the Five Planets follow their proper courses,
The Two Luminaries shine with increased splendor,
Cold and heat arrive without fail,
And all people ascend to benevolence and longevity.
May rain and sunshine arrive in due season,
Praying for the abundant harvest of all grains.
May all moving and sentient beings
Be nurtured by transformation and cultivation.

Relying on the dharma assembly,
We offer this supreme good cause.

We chant:
The Heavenly Worthies of the Three Clarities and Three Realms,
The Heavenly Worthies who bestow blessings from the Nine Heavens,
The Heavenly Worthies of the Numinous Treasure in the Ten Directions,
Whose merit is inconceivable.

The Rite of the Seven Luminaries’ Star Lamps for the Vastly Benevolent and Numinously Efficacious Perfected Lord is now complete.
