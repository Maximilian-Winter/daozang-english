**The Wondrous Register of the Natural Tallies of the Numinous Treasure of the Cavernous Mystery**

Upon the conclusion of the purification fast, the Dharma Master faces east, offers incense thrice, and strikes the teeth three times in succession.

**Incense Charm:**
O Supreme Three Heavens, Mysterious Primordial Three *Qi* of the Most High Lord Lao,
Summon forth the Three and Five Merit Officers within my body,
The left and right official messengers,
The left and right incense-bearing courier dragon riders,
Jade lads attending the incense,
Jade maidens transmitting words,
The Direct Talismans of the Five Thearchs—
Each thirty-six in number—emerge.
Notify and awaken the local earth deities and true officials of this realm.
I now properly burn incense to conduct affairs,
May I receive the *qi* of the Most High’s Ten Directions’ Orthodox Perfected,
Entering my body,
So that what I report swiftly reaches
The presence of the Most High, the Peerless Dao, the Supreme Perfected Jade Thearch.

Next, kneel lengthily, strike the teeth twenty-four times in succession, and dispatch the officials.

**Reverently dispatch** the true officials of the five constituents within my body,
The Merit Officers and clerks,
The enforcers of transformation and the *yin-yang* Merit Officers of the Three Heavens above my body,
The officers of the Dao’s deliverance, calamity’s dissolution, misfortune’s dispersal, and distress’s resolution—
Each twelve in number.

Each two in number—emerge.

Caps and sashes with hanging tassels,
Adorning their dignified presence.

The Direct Envoys and Merit Officers wear crowns piercing the heavens,
Clad in black, holding unlined robes.
The Orthodox Unity Merit Officers wear crimson *ze* caps,
Dressed in vermilion ceremonial unlined robes.
The messengers wear nine-virtue crowns,
Five-colored sashes and unlined robes of investiture,
Tiger tallies at their waists,

I was born and raised in the defiled world of demons,
Sunken in the degenerate karma of this age.
Reveling in glory and splendor,
Amidst a thousand ages of felicitous gatherings.

Having been mistakenly selected to partake in the great transformation, I received the Three Treasures’ sacred scriptures through the covenant of my three masters. With reverent offerings and devout rites, I sought to fulfill my vows. Overwhelmed by the weight of such profound grace, joy and awe intertwine within me.

From the day I received the Dharma, I vowed to propagate its teachings, extol the great transformation, transmit it to later disciples, and open the path of deliverance for gods and humans. Now, in such-and-such prefecture, such-and-such county, such-and-such village, there resides a Taiyi Daoist, the male/female Perfected Officer So-and-So, whose nature is kind and benevolent, whose loyalty, integrity, filial piety, and obedience are steadfast. Though dwelling in this defiled world, their aspirations soar high. They purify themselves in conduct, yearning for the immortals with reverence. Having already received the supreme Dharma and the Taiyi talismanic covenant, they now present their sincerity and faith, seeking to receive the *True Scripture of the Most High Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure Jade Text* and its sacred talismans. Their cinnabar sincerity is so fervent that it cannot be refused.

Accordingly, I have, in accordance with the Dharma, completed the rites with So-and-So on the appointed day of the purification fast. Now, having broken the contract and transmitted the scripture, I respectfully present a memorial on yellow silk with red characters, to be borne swiftly by the Merit Officers, messengers, and flying dragon riders, ascending to the Most High. The memorial lies open upon the jade table, awaiting inspection and consideration.

After the reading of the memorial is complete, I knock my teeth three times and declare: I, once more relying on the assembled Perfected Ones and the superior Merit Officers, messengers, and flying dragon riders, submit this report. I hereby transmit to So-and-So the *Five Chapters of the Supreme Perfected and Utmost True Great Scripture*, along with a memorial on red silk. May this be heard in the presence of the Pure and Mysterious, and may no subordinate official obstruct the qi. Let no barrier of public or private affairs hinder its ascent. I hold my breath and ascend, and the memorial reaches the Three Heavens. I prostrate myself, awaiting the response.

Having completed the prostration with the memorial, I then kneel fully and declare: I, So-and-So, a Master of the Dharma Office of Such-and-Such Sacred Peak, humbly address the Most High—the Formless and Nameless, the Void and Self-So, the Utmost True Great Dao, the Supreme Primordial Honored One, the Most High Lord of the Great Dao, the Heavenly Worthies of the Dao and Virtue of the Ten Directions and Boundless Realms, the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center, the Perfected of the Great Ultimate, the Heavenly Master of the Three Perfected Ones of the Mysterious Unity.

I, this stinking corpse of flesh, a fool of lowly conduct, have by karmic affinity of past lives been undeservedly entrusted with the Three Treasures of the Great Dharma and the sacred scriptures. Yet I have failed to retire into secluded forests, transcending worldly traces. Nor have I been able to propagate the imperial teachings, widely establish fields of merit, relieve suffering and distress, or accumulate merit to atone for faults. Instead, I have mingled with ordinary folk, indistinguishable from the demonic and the vulgar. By the grace of the Great Dao, my head and neck remain intact. To this day, I behold the light of the Three Luminaries. The depth of this kindness and the weight of this bestowal are truly boundless.

I, So-and-So, am filled with awe and dread, kowtowing again and again, acknowledging my mortal offenses, my mortal offenses.

It is said that the true scriptures are of such exalted worth that they cannot be practiced by the coarse and vulgar; their wondrous meanings and profound traces cannot be gazed upon by the shallow understanding and fleshly eyes of this humble servant. Yet by a stroke of fortune, I have encountered this turning of the kalpa, when the Three Caverns govern the world and the selection of seed-people is renewed. Thus, this defiled vessel has been unworthily entrusted with the numinous texts.

Having received the scriptures but recently, I am unfit to reveal them. Now, in the *renchen* cycle, the Great Peace draws near. Fortune and misfortune intertwine, and none but those who have attained the Dao can be secure. The kalpas are perilous, and though human hearts are inscrutable, the worthy diligently seek—such teachings should not be withheld.

I hereby report that a certain Daoist, So-and-So, of Such-and-Such Prefecture, County, and Village, has immersed himself in the Mysterious and inscribed the True, forsaking glory and splendor. His resolve is firmly set on ascending to the heights, desiring the Dao of immortality and flight. His sincerity is fervent, his longing ardent, his devotion courageous. He requests to receive the sacred texts.

Now, having established the Mysterious Regulations and divided the tally to transmit the scriptures, I have sworn before the Three Officials to guard against reckless dissemination. I respectfully submit this report, awaiting your decree for its implementation.

When the address is complete, the tally is divided but not yet bestowed. The master turns to the north, while the disciple turns left to face the south, kneeling fully and holding the cinnabar water before his heart. The master, facing north, intones:

I, So-and-So, a Master of the Dharma Office of Such-and-Such Sacred Peak, dare to address the cinnabar water: In Such-and-Such Prefecture, County, and Village, in the year *jiayi* of such-and-such a cycle, I have reverently received the oral instructions of the Yellow and Red Kings, the Great One, and the One Word. What I have been undeservedly granted is already vast.

Now, I present my vows and pledge my life, as this disciple seeks to receive the *Five Chapters of the Utmost True Great Scripture of the Numinous Treasure* and the *Scripture of the Great Perfected Dao*. Earlier, I prostrated myself and presented a memorial on yellow silk and a petition on plain silk, invoking the assembly of the Most High and all the honored ones, beseeching the Lords and Officers of the Oath-Monitoring Assembly, the Lord of the Numinous Treasure, the Venerable One of the Numinous Treasure, the Lords and Officers of the Three Officials—Heaven, Earth, and Water—and the supervising presence of my seven generations of ancestors.

Witness this disciple, who from this day forward seeks life, observes purification, and dedicates his heart to receiving the wondrous scriptures and oral instructions of the Numinous Treasure. In accordance with the great Dharma, I pledge to uphold and follow them, to guard my speech and conduct with care, and to cast aside all worldly entanglements.

Having severed all external distractions, calm the mind and embrace stillness.
Focus the will upon the Dharma, allowing no defilement to arise.
Do not summon one another in ways that disrupt the true qi.
Ever practice great compassion, broadly delivering all beings.
May the realm know peace and the people abundance, the Four Seas unified in tranquility.
May the seven generations of ancestors all ascend and be delivered.
May this body enter radiant light and swiftly be reborn among humankind.
When the great kalpa’s cycle reaches its end, together we shall soar to the Upper Clarity.
For those not yet immortalized, the span of forty years shall be the term.
No part of this may be leaked or recklessly transmitted to the unworthy.
To break the covenant or betray trust, to carelessly disclose the numinous texts—
Such transgressors shall see their parents in life and death bound to the eternal dark,
enduring ten thousand kalpas of wind and blade, with no cause for complaint.
To violate these prohibitions and precepts is to contravene the writ of the Illuminated Perfected.
This disciple, [Name], having received the true command and the master’s oral instructions, dares not betray them.
To recklessly transmit to the unworthy shall bring calamity upon [Name]’s own person.
Vow never to betray the deities of the above and below, the center and the four directions, the eight quarters—all the true and numinous spirits.
Now together we swallow the covenant’s cinnabar water.
In accordance with the Dharma, observe purification and cultivate the wondrous principles.
Pray that disciple and master alike be delivered from heavenly disasters:
the ninety-six solar cycles, the great calamity of the jia-shen year.
From kalpa to kalpa, may there be no loss or decline.
May sun and moon shine as one, the Three Treasures turn in unison.
Humbly receive from the Lord of the Numinous Treasure and the Venerable One of the Numinous Treasure the life-bestowing methods of the Three Caverns’ celestial texts.
The incantation complete, thrice sip the cinnabar water and receive the contract.
The contract bestowed, the master rises to burn incense, scatter flowers, and circumambulate while reciting the hymn of the Five Perfected Ones.
The disciple then bows twice in reverence.
All rites concluded, the disciple kneels at length, holding the Dharma token.

The master strikes his teeth thirty-six times, visualizing the colors of the five viscera forming a canopy of precious clouds, which covers master and disciple. He then recites the incantation:

The celestial writ is never cumbersome,
For the Dao and virtue are complete of themselves.
Cultivate them and you shall surely become an immortal—
What more could you desire?
The radiance of scripture fills the Great Void,
Resplendent and luminous.
Transmission must follow the Dharma—
Revelation or negligence leads to hell.

The incantation complete, the disciple bows thrice to receive the scripture. He then performs a single prostration, circumambulating the ten directions, beginning from the north and turning eastward in a full circuit. He visualizes the true forms of the Most High in the ten directions, each appearing as their directional icon.

The master recites the *Hymn of the Three Paths and Five Sufferings*. When finished, he recites the *Three Wisdom Hymns*, expounds the Dharma, confers the Ten Precepts, and concludes the ordination rites. The merits are declared, and ranks are restored.

The *Cavernous Mystery Rite of the Numinous Treasure’s Spontaneous Contract* is now complete.
