**Ritual for Offering Libations on the Ascension Day of the Venerable Masters**
**Offering Libations on the Jade Emperor’s Sacred Birthday (First Lunar Month, Ninth Day)**

Rainbow hues diffuse auspicious radiance, as we gaze upon the incense altar beneath the Azure Heavens;
Cranes stand in reverent devotion, presenting fragrant vessels upon the blessed realm.
With solemnity, we kindle the true incense of Dao and virtue, and in utmost sincerity, we present our offerings to:
The Most High, Opener of Heaven, Holder of the Talisman, Ruler of the Calendar, Embracer of Truth, and Embodiment of the Dao—
The August Jade Emperor of the Vast Heavens, the Supreme Lord of the Lofty Firmament;
The Sacred Father, Celestial King of Resplendent and Wondrous Joy;
The August Mother, Empress of Precious Moonlight;
The Sacred Assembly of the Golden Towers of Mount Mi;
The Lofty Perfected of the Jade Capital—all relying upon the true incense, universally conjoined in offering.

Again, we kindle the true incense and present our offerings to:
The Three Pristine Ones of the Formless and Spontaneous, the Three Realms of Heavenly Worthies;
The Great Emperor of the Northern Culmen, the Purple Tenuity;
The Heavenly August Emperor of the Southern Culmen;
The Earthly Sovereign, Queen of the Sustaining Earth, Who Responds to Heaven’s Patterns;
The Myriad Spirits of the Three Realms and the True Lords of the Ten Directions.
On this day of homage, we reverently beseech all true numina, humbly invoking their vast compassion to deign to gaze upon us with penetrating insight.

**Proclamation of Intent**
We humbly submit: the Great Dao is formless, yet wondrously initiates and nourishes the myriad things...

The Perfectly Real, though without form, governs the manifold beings and guides the cosmic pattern. Its wondrous workings are beyond fathoming, its numinous mechanism unfathomable. With unadorned reverence, we exhaustively offer our celebration and homage to the sacred.

We reverently recall the August Jade Emperor, the Great Heavenly Worthy, the Mysterious Culmen, the Lofty Lord of Heaven—co-equal in radiance with Heaven and Earth, conjoined in virtue with Sun and Moon. In the True Realm of Floating Black, the records preserve the inception of the Dao’s transmission; in the Supreme Palace of Purple Tenuity, the decree of salvation for humankind is revealed. From celestial scriptures, the Treasure Book emerges; from rosy clouds, the Golden Seal is unfurled. This is the celestial chapter of the Great Brahma, the hidden rhyme of all heavens. Resplendent is the teaching beyond words, transcending the mechanism of the formless. Eight rays cast their brilliance—who can fathom the vast kalpas? The Two Modes respond to the turning of the Dao—none can plumb its true source. We trust in the gracious oversight of your compassion, that it may but slightly fulfill our yearning for refuge.

The assemblies of all heavens and the Three Realms are not distant. Jade trees and immortal blossoms—within a hand’s span of the Jade Void; jasper chariots and azure carriages—resounding with harmonious jade music. With utmost reverence, we perform the first offering.

Moreover, the Terrace of Fragrant Mist manifests the Brahma-form of conditioned existence; the Great Brahma of the Vast Ocean possesses the divine power of the boundless. This is the spiritual pivot of the Mysterious Ancestor, the essential decree of the Lofty Sovereign. It is the lamp of wisdom in the dark crossroads, the boat and oar across the vast sea—above, securing the nation and pacifying the people; below, rescuing the imperiled and delivering the distressed. It uplifts all sentient beings, transcending distinctions of wisdom and folly, high and low; it disseminates the true and mysterious, shattering the barriers of non-being, form, emptiness, and obstruction.

We, of humble and meager virtue, are none but those molded by your grace. We reflect that we, who feast our ears upon the Dharma-sound, universally bathe in your sacred blessings. Hearing the exposition, we marvel at its rarity and deepen our awakening, moved by your vast compassion. As we encounter this auspicious occasion of your descent into the world, we reverently perform the morning audience at the break of day. Like the boundless bright mirror, what need is there for offerings in venerating the honored? Like the great bell’s mighty resonance, though silent, it responds when struck. We dare not presume upon repeated entreaties, yet humbly pray for your gracious acceptance. Bowing twice, we offer incense and perform the second presentation.

Moreover, the True Realm of Wondrous Existence universally manifests the body of the King of Sublime Joy; the Supreme Palace of Miroku is the very throne of the Root Emperor. It embodies the essence of the primordial qi’s gestation and fully realizes the vast truth of the Three Luminaries. Its wondrous virtue is beyond thought, its divine power beyond discourse. Concealed above the Jade Capital, towering high in the Golden Portal. Five thousand secret words fuse the great Dao of the Three Powers; eight thousand and more salvations reach the multitudes of the Six Realms. Spontaneously so, not to be known by knowledge; settled yet responsive, free in coming and going. Unconstrained by union or separation, its transformations are all-pervading and unfathomable. It expounds the decree of purity and liberation, delivering those sunk in delusion, sorrow, and suffering. It roams through the Three Realms, universally manifesting above the Ten Directions.

We humbly pray that you not disdain our childish importunity, but rather incline your imperial heart. Witness our devotion in fasting, ablutions, and vigil; open the covering of your nurturing embrace. May your majestic presence shine forth, bringing joy beyond words. Overwhelmed with reverence, we conclude with the third offering.

**Proclamation of Petition**
**Dedication**

We humbly pray that Heaven’s hearing be ever clear, the imperial heart ever discerning. Enduring yet not domineering, it takes Heaven and Earth as its foundation; gazed upon, it grows ever loftier, transcending form and name to stand alone. Its grace sustains all beings, its blessings extend to state and homeland.

On the fifteenth day of the first lunar month, the birth anniversary of the Celestial Master: in the heavens, the fragrant rose marks the millennial dawn of a perfected immortal; on earth, the plantain and lychee express the timely reverence of a sacred celebration. With reverence, we kindle true incense, offering it to the Ancestral Master, the Three Heavens’ Upholder of the Teaching, the Great Dharma Celestial Master Who Assists the Primordial and Embodies the Dao; the Perfected Lord of True Response, Who Subtly Transforms and Quietly Manifests; the Most High and Vast Emperor of the Six Harmonies, the Heavenly Worthy Who Subdues Demons and Protects the Dao; the Sacred Ancestor, Marquis Wen Cheng of the Han, Preceptor of the Realm; the Sacred Father of the Orthodox Unity, Perfected Lord of Tong-□; the Sacred Mother, Primordial Lady; the Lineal Master, Perfected Lord of the Wondrous Dao Who Expounds the Teaching of the Great Clarity; the Affiliated Master, Perfected Lord of Illuminating Transformation and Vast Virtue of the Great Clarity; the Orthodox Unity’s Female Master, Primordial Lady; the Two Perfected Lords Wang and Zhao, Attendants to the Imperial Presence; the Immortal Maidens Wen Ji, Wen Guang, Yu Lan, and Fang Zhi; the Commandant of the Imperial Chariot, Marquis of Lou Ting; the Governor of Yi Yang, Marquis of Lang Zhong; the Governor of Nan Jun, the Palace Attendant and Imperial Censor; the Perfected Lords, Primordial Ladies, Immortal Maidens, Ancestral Immortals, Flying Ascendants, and Immortal Kin of all generations of Orthodox Unity Celestial Masters; the High Perfected of this temple’s incense fire; the Perfected Lords, Divine Officials, and Generals of the Thunder Rites; the local deities of Jiangdong; all the assembled deities of the Three Realms; and every true numen.

All together, we offer true incense in universal veneration. The proclamation of intent is declared.

Bowing in reverence, we recall how the crane’s cry at Mount Heming first inaugurated the unfolding of boundless numinous transformation, while the fish-scale ranks of the sacred writs were honored with the radiant favor of the Most High. From the Han dynasty onward, the lineage gained renown, succeeding the Marquis of Liu in perpetuating its glory. Mountains and forests gaze in awe, seas and lands turn in devotion.

We now reverently recall the Ancestral Master, the Perfected Lord of Orthodox Unity, the very fount of Orthodox Unity and sovereign of the Mysterious Origin. He saved the world on Heaven’s behalf, transmitting the precious registers to posterity; he cultivated perfection upon the earth, nurturing the golden elixir to fulfill the great Dao. The inheritance of seal and sword stretches far into antiquity, while his meritorious deeds and virtuous conduct shine with vast splendor. Green carriages and cinnabar chariots drew the descent of the Perfected Ones from the Golden Towers; dragon scripts and phoenix seals delved into the treasuries of the Purple Yang’s inner canon. Honored by the sagely court with exalted bestowals, his transformative embrace extended wide as a sheltering canopy. His divine influence spread afar, purple mists enveloped the heavens. Dragons frolicked and unicorns danced, their graceful descent observed in awe; phoenixes sang and simurghs called, their harmonious ranks arrayed in solemn feast.

With utmost reverence, we now present the first offering.

Whereas the heavens manifest as stars and constellations, the earth as rivers and mountains—marking the rise and fall of a hundred generations—so too do robes and crowns, the very source of waters, become the legacy upon which posterity gazes in reverence. The Three Heavens rejoice as one, the Four Seas surge with jubilation, for we perceive that the treasury of the supreme Dao stores the essence of all, and that this essence is indeed the primordial nurturing of the finest spirits. Its fragrant roots run deep, its luxuriant branches and leaves radiate glory; it nourishes the mountains and forests as clothing and covering clothe and cover the grasses and trees.

We, your humble disciples, dwell beneath the shelter of your teaching, abiding in the jade courts. Ever do we hold fast to emulation and devotion, never wavering in our observance. We beseech you to regard our earnest reverence, to bestow the grace of your acceptance, that we may partake of your resplendent brilliance and penetrate the wondrous meaning. May the celestial countenance be pleased, spring suffusing the fungus face with heightened radiance; may auspicious clouds and luminous qi draw near the imperial terrace, suffusing it with felicity. We meet amidst wind and cloud in the heavens above, we behold the sun and moon among humankind below.

With redoubled sincerity, we present the second offering.

Where six giant turtles bear the mountain and twin phoenixes support the imperial carriage, the hour of your blessed birth is most felicitous; where the Five Elders open the way and a host of immortals flank the axle, we now render our praise. Your achievements are profound, your sheltering grace ever-present. Lofty as the Hall of Supreme Harmony, you uphold the transformation of this pure lineage, ever-present, advancing with the times. The scales of fish and dragons stand erect, rejoicing together in the sight of the celestial and human realms; these whiskers and beard gaze straight ahead, as if once more beholding the light of sun and moon. Amid the fragrance of orchids and angelica, our thoughts renew the sincerity of sunflowers and mallows. Though thrice-kindled incense may fade, our reverence redoubles with a hundred bows.

With utmost reverence, we present this memorial to express our words, purify the libation cup, and offer our praises. The grace we receive is boundless, its particulars beyond enumeration. We pray that you deign to regard our humble offering of water-plantains, that your overflowing favor may nourish generations to come. May the luminous presence above forever illumine the true wind; may your majestic spirit ever abide in the radiance of the transforming sun. May your virtuous splendor know no end, and the immortal Dao flourish ever more.

With deepest reverence, we conclude with the third offering.
The memorial is proclaimed and the merit dedicated.

May we humbly pray that, grasping the pivot of the Dao, you move in harmony with Heaven’s revolutions. As the teachings receive their nurturing moisture, the fish-scale robes bask in the grace of rain and dew; where the imperial presence sheds its radiance, the duck-feather sandals tread above the stars. May the jade courts remain serene and solemn, the Daoist assembly secure and harmonious.

On the fifteenth day of the second month, the birth of the Dao’s Ancestor is celebrated with this memorial. Though the Great Dao bears no name, we mark the dawn of its descent; though the Most Divine shines in majesty, how can our reverent praises suffice? With utmost devotion, we kindle the true incense of virtue and power, and in all sincerity present our offerings to the Most High Lord of Dao and Virtue of the Grand Pure Immortal Realm, the August Emperor of Primordial Virtue.

We reverently beseech the compassion of the Dao, that it may turn and illumine our humble offering. Once more we kindle the true incense and present our devotions, offering to the Jade Pure Originator of Heaven, the Supreme Pure Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy, the Golden Watchtower Lords of the Heavens, the Lofty Perfected of the Great Mystery’s Wondrous Existence, the Dharma Lord Mysterious Heavenly Emperor, the Patriarch Orthodox Unity Perfected Lord, the Thousand Perfected and Ten Thousand Sages of the Three Realms and Ten Directions, the Officials and Generals of the Thunder Rites, the Earth God of Jiangdong, and all the divine beings who gather in homage on this day. May the true incense be universally offered to all.

The memorial is proclaimed.

---

We humbly acknowledge that birth has no beginning and follows no end, its profound communion lying in dark stillness; it may bear the name "constant" yet is not the constant Dao, for it is pure and self-so. Receiving the wondrous qi from the Jade Void, it manifests its pure countenance within the numinous chamber.

With reverence, we recall the Primordial August Emperor, the Most High Lord Lao, who presides over the teachings of the Mysterious Origin, dwelling in the Great Crimson Heaven. He establishes the peoples and creatures, moving the cosmos of Heaven and Earth; he governs yin and yang, directing the sun and moon. He shapes and nurtures all kinds, delivering and saving both the manifest and the hidden. Now, in the midst of the green-yang season’s order, on this festival of the Purple Palace’s true origin, the Nine Heavens rejoice in harmony, and the Three Realms open in auspiciousness. Auspicious radiance flows from the Mysterious Pivot, and numinous light shines upon the realm of longevity. Thus, we extend our felicitous devotion and respectfully present our celebratory rites.

The white deer draws his chariot, as if descending to grace the Han court; the azure ox bears his carriage, still condescending to the Zhou dynasty. With earnest sincerity, we perform the first offering.

We humbly observe that nine dragons embrace the auspiciousness, marking the flourishing dawn of the sagely era; eight luan-birds sing in unison, presenting and welcoming the Perfected One on this bright morning. The great transformation is proclaimed, and the numinous sounds are unfolded. Solemn as the sun and deep as the moon’s horns, we look up to the Way of treading the stars and walking the heavens. He upholds the warp of the myriad transformations, governing and ordering the Three Powers.

We, your servants, who guard the jade halls and follow the ritual codes, face the pure radiance in reverent attendance, gazing upon the purple qi ever ascending. We, the feathered ones of Peng Isle, purify the forest-dwelling offerings; we diligently cultivate the Mysterious Canon, hoping for your gracious regard. Rooted in origin, we endure as long as Heaven and Earth; neither void nor form, we transcend images and numbers in solitary eminence. With renewed sincerity, we perform the second offering.

We humbly note that golden tablets and jade scriptures expound the divine Perfected Ones of the Three Caverns; the Father’s words and sagely teachings bequeath virtue and power across a thousand ages. He spreads the wind of purity and clarity, abundantly inaugurating the transformation of the subtle and tranquil. Unfolding the threads of cloud-caps and rosy skirts, he reveals the mysteries of red writings and jade characters. His teachings cover the Central Lands, his grace extends to the lower realms. The Pass Keeper gazes afar to observe the qi, while heaven and humanity await the transmission of scriptures. It cannot be grasped, it cannot be heard—though the great Dao alone transcends speech and silence; that which abides is spirit, that which passes is transformation—only the most abundant virtue can be described.

How then shall we praise and extol? Only through diligent purification and ablution. We humbly pray that the transmission of the precelestial Dao may guide the lost through endless kalpas, ever serving as the bridge for the lower realms and transforming all peoples within the four quarters. Thus, even the inquiries of Kongtong shall find no fault, and the blemishes of Guye shall vanish. May the lineage of the Dao store up auspiciousness, and may the jade halls share in this felicity.

With utmost reverence, we conclude the third offering.

[Recite the] scripture. Proclaim the memorial.

In dedication—
This month being mid-spring, the wind and light have reached the season of blossoms;
Longevity equal to heaven, virtue and power now descend upon the immortal’s birthday.
All heavens rejoice as one, the three realms share in joy.

We humbly pray that the jade throne remain exalted, the cinnabar gates open and clear.
May the nation achieve unity, following the eternal scripture of virtue and power;
May heaven and earth, first and last, transcend form and name to stand alone.
Each in harmony and purity, together attaining great peace.

We humbly pray that the Dao be revered and virtue honored, that forests and springs forever delight in prosperity;
That days grow richer and months more flourishing, and nurturing rains and dew equally moisten all under cultivation.

On the third day of the third month, the birth of the exalted perfected—
The third day of the third month, precisely the time when Orchid Pavilion gathered for purification rites;
With one virtue and one heart, we celebrate the sage of the Golden Portal’s incarnate transformation.

Reverently kindling true incense, with utmost sincerity we make offerings to:
The Lord of Myriad Dharmas, Jade Void Master and Minister, Mysterious Heavenly Thearch;
The Golden Portal’s incarnate transformation, the Demon-Quelling Heavenly Worthy;
His holy father, Heavenly Lord of Pure Joy, Radiant Perfected Great Emperor;
His holy mother, Queen of Excellent Victory, Jade Perfected Supreme Immortal;
His holy preceptor, August Emperor of Abundant Heaven;
Ancestral Heavenly Master, Grand Minister of Supreme Mystery, Perfected Lord of Orthodox Unity;
The Star Lords of the *Xu* and *Wei* constellations;
The Manifested Star Lord of Military Merit;
The Divine Lord of Culture and Destiny, Master of Zi and Tong;
The Five Perfected Lords of Attained Dao on Mount Wudang;
The Heavenly Rectifier of the Northern Culmen’s Protective Sagely Mansion;
The Officials, Lords, Generals, and Clerks of the Yuanhe Migration and Correction Bureau;
The Exalted Perfected of the Temple’s Fragrant Hearth;
The Perfected Officials and Generals of the Thunder Rites Department;
The local deities of Jiangdong;
All the true numina of the three realms who gather in homage on this day;
And the Perfected Controllers of the Mysterious Void’s passing oversight.

May all be upheld by true incense and universally receive these offerings.

Proclaim the intent.

We humbly recall how the sun’s auspicious dream presaged glory, celebrating the Mysterious Heaven’s responsive transformation; parting the clouds, we gaze toward its advent, prostrating upon the generous earth to present our sentiments. All heavens descend in unison, myriad spirits chant in homage.

With reverence we invoke the Teaching Master, the Mysterious Heavenly Thearch, who embodies Heaven’s Dao and wields the Emperor’s mandate. Born of Pure Joy’s numinous conception, his qi converges amid the Five Peaks and the Three Luminaries; aligned with the *Xu* and *Wei* constellations, he harmonizes the primordial harmony of the Nine Empyreans and Eight Radiant Scenes. Rightly enthroned in the lofty Northern Culmen, he ever more brilliantly augments the flourishing of Eastern Wu. Repeatedly bathed in the resplendent robes of the sagely court, he graciously inclines toward the mortal world’s devotion. Pouring fine nectar like flowing rosy clouds, we offer libations upon the wind; modestly preparing mountain herbs and river weeds, we beseech the August Sage’s radiant presence. With sincere heart we perform the first offering.

We bow in awe of the Jade Void’s Preceptor and Minister, gazing toward the Northern Culmen’s majesty; the Golden Portal’s True Honored One, entrusted to posterity’s veneration. His numinous radiance shines resplendently, his sagely virtue towers sublimely—all wishes are fulfilled, no hidden realm remains unillumined. His potent *kuigang* energy directs its force, sweeping away demonic forces from the Six Caverns; separating humans and ghosts, he manifests meritorious deeds within seven days. Both manifest and hidden realms attain peace, observed through ages past and present.

We, your humble servants, have been shaped by your nurturing grace, our gratitude and praise run deep. In action and retreat, in acceptance and rejection, we rely solely upon your sagely teachings; in sheltering protection and steadfast support, we differ not from those touched by your numinous blessings. Now, on this propitious day, we once more invoke the Mysterious Wind. Presuming to present these modest offerings, we seek to repay your boundless favor. Though our words may seem childishly irreverent, we pray you deign to witness our sincerity. Jade pendants and jeweled robes descend from the vast cloud-filled skies; golden coins and treasure horses but faintly express our worldly reverence. Renewing our devotion, we perform the second offering.

We acknowledge that to neglect ritual would be remiss, how dare we forget our private joy in celebration? Moved by our sincerity, you respond in communion, and we look up to your virtue of cherishing life. O Spirit, your presence is as if here; O August One, your numinous power is ever proclaimed. With earnest longing we gaze upon you, solemnly presenting our offerings.

We humbly pray you descend to this earthly realm and graciously regard our modest devotion. With humble herbs and earnest sincerity, we perform the threefold courteous rites; how fortunate are the mountains and forests to behold your radiance, now but a foot’s distance away. Offering our utmost sincerity, we conclude with the third libation.

[Recite the] scripture. Proclaim the memorial.

We now turn our intentions outward:
As spring’s warmth melts the air, peach and plum blossoms open across the imperial gardens;
As the Heavenly Countenance shines in solemn grace, we reverently prepare the southern-stream’s pondweed and white southernwood.
Ten thousandfold joy and glory, one sincere celebration of felicity.

We humbly pray that the Lofty Perfected may peer into our depths, that the Lineage of Sages may bestow their compassion.
May our single thought of utmost sincerity be met with the Nine Categories of the Great Model.
May cap and robe flourish in splendor, may jade halls stand secure in peace.

On the ninth day of the ninth month, the Lofty Perfected and Ancestral Master ascend in offering of this text:
Riding the clouds to pay homage to the Emperor, they return on this double-ninth day;
Pouring water to honor the Perfected, they look up to the Three Heavens now intimately near.

With reverence we kindle true incense, devoutly offering to:
The Ancestral Celestial Master,
The Three Heavens’ Upholding Teaching and Assisting Primordial Dao Great Dharma Celestial Master,
The Orthodox Unity and Primordial Mystery Spiritually Transformed and Serenely Responsive Manifest Protector Perfected Lord,
The Boundless Six Directions Lofty and Illustrious Great Emperor,
The Demon-Quelling and Dao-Protecting Heavenly Worthy and remaining sagely hosts—
all as before.

Again we kindle true incense, offering to:
The Jade Clarity Master and Minister, Mysterious Heavenly Thearch and Lord of Myriad Dharmas;
The Golden Palace’s Manifested Body, Demon-Quelling Heavenly Worthy;
The Sacred Father, Pure Joy Heavenly Lord and Illustrious Perfected Great Emperor;
The Sacred Mother, Excellent Victory Heavenly Consort and Jade Perfected Supreme Immortal;
The realized divine officials and sacred assembly of Mount Wudang;
The high perfected of the incense hall;
The thunder and lightning dharma departments’ officials and divine marshals;
The local earth gods of the Jiangdong region;
And all the perfected and numinous beings of this day’s court and praise—
all rely upon this true incense in universal and equal offering.

We now proclaim our intent:
As autumn winds stir the jade pendants, we recall the Double Yang’s ascension;

As golden stalks glisten with dawn’s dew, we offer libations in accord with this auspicious festival.
The myriad heavens descend in attendance, and the ten thousand spirits join in harmonious praise.

With reverence we recall the Ancestral Celestial Master, the Orthodox Unity Perfected Lord,
who grasps the pivot of Heaven and moves in concert with its revolutions.
At Jade Peak’s sacred precinct, he received the Nine Cauldrons’ scriptures;
with crimson tally and rainbow banner, his radiance illumined the edicts of the Three Heavens.
From the Han dynasty’s dragon-rising era to the time when cranes departed Shu’s capital,
his teachings flourished, their splendor resplendent even now.

We now honor the Dharma Lord, the Mysterious Heavenly Thearch,
who embodies Heaven’s Dao and wields the Emperor’s talisman.
Born of Pure Joy’s wondrous conception, his qi condensed between the Five Peaks and the Three Luminaries;
aligned with the astral mansions of Kui and Lou, he harmonized the primordial harmony of the Nine Empyreans and Eight Sceneries.
Rightly enthroned at the Northern Culmen’s height, he lends greater luster to Eastern Wu’s prosperity.
Both bathe in the sacred dynasty’s resplendent robes, and in human realms, sunflowers turn toward their brilliance.
We humbly gather dogwood sprigs, offering them downwind in libation;
we duly prepare water-plants and pondweed, praying for the august presence of the Most High.
With sincere devotion, we present the first offering.

Behold the purple lingzhi’s brows—how they evoke the Master’s lofty majesty;
the Dark Warrior’s banners and standards, entrusted to posterity’s gaze.
Divine radiance shines resplendent, Heaven’s vision clear and bright,
ever advancing with the times, leaving no hidden realm unobserved.
At Deer Hall and Salt Well, his meritorious deeds are inscribed on towering steles;
at Needle Stream and Areca Plum, the earth below cherishes his boundless grace.
Our endless veneration dares not lag behind in this morning’s rites.

We reflect humbly upon our own undeserved cultivation,
our deepest joy and praise rooted in this sacred influence.
Whether in action or retreat, we rely solely on the sagely teachings;
in sheltering protection and guiding support, we seek only the blessings of numinous favor.
On this propitious day, we once more invoke the Mysterious Wind,
presenting these modest offerings in gratitude for the vast and boundless gifts.
May our childish simplicity not offend, and may our sincerity be witnessed.
Jade pendants and kingfisher robes descend through the vast expanse of cloud and sky;
cold springs and autumn chrysanthemums but faintly reflect our reverent devotion.
With renewed devotion, we present the second offering.

With phoenix-scripted decrees, he bears the Three Heavens’ gracious mandate;
with feathered canopies and rainbow banners, he attends the Ninefold Festival of Ascending Perfection.
The gods, vast and majestic, abide above; the imperial presence, keen and luminous, manifests its power.
Riding white clouds to the Emperor’s realm, his work complete, he departs for the separate palace;
receiving the plain-text scriptures and true instructions, his might subdues all demonic forces.
For thousands of years, the Orthodox Unity’s transmission has endured,
expanding the glory of the Twenty-Eight Treatments’ ancestral teachings.
The merit of transforming nests rivals the awe-inspiring might of Heaven’s guardians.
No empty praise suffices—we solemnly present our offerings in reverence.

We humbly pray for your descent to this earthly realm, graciously witnessing our sincerity.
Dogwood and chrysanthemum diffuse their fragrance, thrice offering our earnest rites;
the mountains and forests are blessed, beholding your radiance at a mere hand’s span.
With all our devotion, we conclude the threefold offering.

Proclamation of the Petition
Dedication of Merit

Swans and cranes drift through the void, descending their majestic presence to within a hand’s span;
crowns and robes array in order, offering reverence and respect thrice over.
The eight directions stand clear in autumn’s purity, as all heavens gather in clouds.
We humbly pray you deign to accept our earnest sincerity, manifesting the great teachings,
transmitting the scriptures at the Jade Bureau, ever illuminating the ancestral Dao and virtue;
presiding over the law in the Dark Heavens, abundantly extending boundless blessings.
May the jade courts remain serene and solemn, the Daoist assembly harmonious and at peace.
May the divine spirits grant their protection, expanding the radiance of Dao and virtue;
may the rites and appearances be revered and solemn, ushering in an era of harmony and prosperity.
May crowns and robes flourish in splendor, jade temples thrive in tranquility.
The ritual of offering to the birth and ascension of all masters is now concluded.
