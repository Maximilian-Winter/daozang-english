**The Precious Repentance for the Ascension of the Compassionate Lord**
*Ritual performed according to proper form.*

The officiant, your humble servant [Name], having lit incense, respectfully petitions:

To the Most Perfect and Supreme *Dao-Treasure*, the Three Venerable Ones of the Highest;
To the Most Perfect and Supreme *Scripture-Treasure*, the Thirty-Six Revered Scriptures;
To the Most Perfect and Supreme *Master-Treasure*, the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center;
To the Great Compassionate One of the Eastern Ultimate Palace, the *Heavenly Worthy of Great Unity Who Saves from Suffering*;
To the *Heavenly Worthy of the Azure Empyrean*;
To the *Heavenly Worthy Who Delivers from the Nine Hells*;
To the *Heavenly Worthies Who Save from Suffering in the Ten Directions*;
To the *Perfected of Great Compassion Who Saves from Suffering*;
To the *Perfected of Great Compassion and Great Kindness*;
To the boundless true lords of the Assembly of Salvation;
To the incense-offering officials and courier messengers;
To the local earth gods of this realm—
All are reverently offered true incense in universal homage.

Your servant now petitions:

I have heard that the Three Clarities’ sagely lords spread the Three Caverns to extend their compassion,
That the Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Poles pervade the Ten Directions to save from suffering.
Their grace blankets the cosmos, their kindness reaches the hidden and dark.
The sentient beings of the Six Realms, parting clouds and mist, gaze upon the sun and moon;
The Nine Hells’ various realms transform sands and dust to ferry gods and humans.
How much more so do the Yellow Register’s precepts descend, the Purple Clarity’s teachings establish,
Universally aiding, universally delivering—boundless and immeasurable!

Today, on behalf of the departed soul of [Name], we rely on the true precepts of the Nine Grades,
And pray to the ranked sages of the Ten Heavens.
We purify the sacred space, sincerely revealing our sorrowful devotion,
Repenting the transgressions of dust and kalpas, dissolving the karmic obstructions of many lives.
Now, the orchid altar is prepared, precious incense coils in smoke.
Reverently facing the Most Venerable, we proclaim the repentance ritual,
Bowing our heads in refuge to the Boundless Great Dao.

**Invocation of Respectful Praise**
**The Three Refuges**
Having taken refuge in the Three Treasures, the Ten Directions clearly witness.
Today, on behalf of the departed soul of [Name], we humbly follow the true precepts,
Relying on the Daoist assembly to dedicate merit to the hidden realm,
Aiding their transcendence and rebirth.
With pure and fragrant flowers, we offer sincere worship.

**The Assembly** proclaims:
Thus, incense—rare wood of the *Qian* groves, divine roots of the *Ju* caves—
Radiates the splendor of the Dao and virtue, solidifies the auspicious *qi* of Heaven and Earth.
As the jeweled casket opens, the golden tripod begins its chant.
May this single wisp of fragrant incense pervade the Ten Flowery Realms.
The assembly, with reverence, takes refuge and makes offerings.

**Heavenly Worthy of Distant Fragrance**
The altar’s hundred harmonies settle like auspicious clouds,
A single heart’s incense expresses utmost sincerity.
May the Heavenly Worthy Who Saves from Suffering deign to descend,
That the departed soul may be delivered and bow to the Three Clarities.

Thus, flowers—roots transmitted from the *Lang* gardens, buds formed in the numinous terrace—
Extend five branches of immortal cassia, bloom ten-yard fragrant lotuses.
Scattered in profusion around the altar’s corners, gracefully swirling in the void,
They adorn the myriad blossoms, dispersing across the Ten Directions.
The assembly takes refuge and makes offerings with reverence.

**Heavenly Worthy of Precious Flowers’ Purity**
Heavenly fragrance and royal beauty ever endure,
Resplendent on the plate, they express utmost sincerity.
May the Heavenly Worthies of the Three Realms deign to witness,
That the departed soul may be delivered and bow to the Compassionate Lord.

Thus, water—its source deep and vast, its benefits inexhaustible—
Drawn from the Eastern Well, poured toward the Ten Directions’ realms.
Though simple in preparation, its value lies in reverent devotion.
The assembly takes refuge and makes offerings with sincerity.

**Heavenly Worthy of Sweet Dew’s Circulation**
The jade sea’s profound waves flow with numinous ripples,
Vast and clear, they bestow abundant moisture.
May the Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Poles deign to witness,
That grace may bathe the departed, guiding them to depart the netherworld.

I have heard that the Heavenly Worthy Who Saves from Suffering fills the Ten Directions’ realms,
Ever employing divine power to rescue and deliver all sentient beings,
Enabling them to depart from delusion’s paths.
Sentient beings, unaware, are like the blind beholding the sun and moon.
I originate from the Great Nothingness, guiding without limit.
Auspicious clouds open the gate of life, propitious smoke seals the door of death.
First issuing from the Mysterious and Primordial, it connects with the mechanism of auspicious response.
Saving all sins, delivering all calamities,
Vastly transcending the immortal source, boundlessly attaining natural purity.
Such is the power of the Dao—immeasurable and boundless!

Today, gazing upon the precious radiance, we bow to the jade countenance.
On behalf of the departed soul of [Name],
We repent the transgressions of their former life, eradicate the faults of their demise.
The assembly, with reverence, sincerely prostrates.

**Sincerely prostrate and bow to:**
The Heavenly Worthy of the Primordial Beginning of the Great Net.
The Heavenly Worthy of the Numinous Treasure of the Jade Clarity.
The Heavenly Worthy of the Chaotic Origin and the Dao and Virtue.
The Heavenly Worthy Who Saves from Suffering, the Great Unity.
The Heavenly Worthy Who Delivers from the Nine Hells.
The Heavenly Worthy of the Jade Treasure, August and Supreme.
The Heavenly Worthy of the Mysterious and True, Myriad Blessings.
The Heavenly Worthy of the Supreme and Most Wondrous.
The Heavenly Worthy of the Jade Clarity, Mysterious and Supreme.
The Heavenly Worthy of the Ascended Immortals and Sagely Ones.
The Heavenly Worthy Who Cherishes Life and Delivers Beings.
The Heavenly Worthy of the Great Numinous and Empty Sovereign.
The Heavenly Worthy of the Boundless Great Flower.
The Heavenly Worthy of the Jade Clarity, Bright and August.
The Heavenly Worthy of the True Sovereign and Grotto Spirits.
The Perfected of Great Compassion Who Saves from Suffering.
The Perfected of Great Compassion and Great Kindness.

**Bows completed.** Each rises and kneels long, prostrating in repentance.

We, the assembly, sincerely take refuge in body, spirit, and life to the sagely lords of the Three Clarities,
To the Heavenly Worthies Who Save from Suffering in the Ten Directions.
Reverently we beseech your great compassion, to universally extend vast grace and condescend to bestow great favor.
Today, as we perform the ritual, facing the origin and burning incense,
We confess transgressions and repent.
For the departed soul of [Name], from birth to demise,
In all actions and movements, they were mired in the dust and filth of the six senses;
In vain pleasures and idle delights, they multiplied myriad transgressions.
Through countless rebirths, their heavy sins in bodily karma—
We pray these may be pardoned and absolved.

We humbly pray the Three Treasures extend their compassion, the Worthies of the Ten Directions bestow salvation.
May they issue golden writs to absolve sins, and by their grace of favor, guide the spirit to ascend.
We, the assembly, prostrate with utmost sincerity, bowing in gratitude to the Supreme Void Sovereign, the Most Perfect Three Treasures.

*Step into the void*

We, the assembly, further fear that for the departed soul of [Name], though bodily karma is severed, mental karma remains unresolved.
Again we beseech the Ten Directions, invoking the assembly of sages.
We repent the sins of their former life, that today’s good causes may be witnessed.
The ritual assembly takes refuge, renewing their reverent homage.

With utmost sincerity, we reverently bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning of the Great Net.
With utmost sincerity, we reverently bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Numinous Treasure of the Jade Clarity.
With utmost sincerity, we reverently bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Dao and Virtue of Chaos Origin.

Each rises and kneels long, prostrating in repentance.
We, the assembly, sincerely take refuge in body, spirit, and life to the sagely lords of the Three Clarities,
To the Heavenly Worthies Who Save from Suffering in the Ten Directions.
Reverently we beseech your great compassion, to universally extend vast grace and condescend to bestow great favor.
Today, as we perform the ritual, facing the origin and burning incense,
We confess transgressions and repent.
For the departed soul of [Name], from birth to demise,
Anger and joy, love and aversion—all arose from the heart;
Greed and delusion, vain and false thoughts—each moment sprang from the mind’s sprouting.
Thus, they committed boundless errors.
We pray all sins of mental karma may be pardoned and absolved.
Humbly we pray that compassionate grace spread through the Ten Directions, that the roots of sin be extinguished;
That the purified soul swiftly depart the Nine Realms, and in blessed realms, wander free.

We, the assembly, prostrate with utmost sincerity, bowing in gratitude to the Supreme and Perfect Three Treasures.

*Step into the void*

We, the assembly, further fear that for [Name], though mental karma is now dissolved and right mindfulness restored,
Verbal karma, unrepented, leaves evil roots unsevered.
Again we beseech the Ten Directions, to eradicate the three karmas,
That the departed soul of [Name] may awaken to the illusory nature of bodily, mental, and verbal karma, and their sins melt like ice;
That through reverence for the Dao, scriptures, and masters, the true vehicle may flourish and good roots grow.
The ritual assembly takes refuge, thrice renewing their reverent homage.

With utmost sincerity, we reverently bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning of the Great Net.
With utmost sincerity, we reverently bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Numinous Treasure of the Jade Clarity.
With utmost sincerity, we reverently bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Dao and Virtue of Chaos Origin.

Each rises and kneels long, prostrating in repentance.
We, the assembly, sincerely take refuge in body, spirit, and life to the sagely lords of the Three Clarities,
To the Heavenly Worthies Who Save from Suffering in the Ten Directions.
Reverently we beseech your great compassion, to universally extend vast grace and condescend to bestow great favor.
Today, as we perform the ritual, facing the origin and burning incense,
We confess transgressions and repent.
For the departed soul of [Name], from birth to demise,
Words belied the heart, wantonly harming living beings;
Flowery speech and ornate language, displaying cunning and flattery through the tongue’s root.
Self-committed or taught to others, their transgressions were boundless.
We pray all grave sins of verbal karma may be pardoned and absolved.
Humbly we pray the three karmas be purged, the six senses purified.
Through the sacred power of the Ten Heavens, may they forever depart the dark paths of the Nine Nights.

We, the assembly, prostrate with utmost sincerity, bowing in gratitude to the Supreme and Perfect Three Treasures.

*Step into the void*   *Thrice invoked*   *Thrice bowed*

We look up to the Heavenly Worthies Who Save from Suffering in the Ten Directions,
Who manifest forms across the ten realms, universally delivering gods and humans.
Gathering qi and amassing merit, they harmoniously rescue sinful souls.
Beyond this realm lies the Eastern Paradise, within the Hall of Eternal Joy,
The Merciful One, the Heavenly Worthy Who Saves from Suffering, vows to universally deliver all beings.
Through countless eons, they have saved immeasurable multitudes.
Should one invoke their sacred name, meditate upon their compassionate visage,
With unwavering devotion and ceaseless recitation,
They shall depart all realms of suffering, attain this sublime cause,
Enjoy great blessings in heaven, and hear no cries of torment in hell.
The fiery haze transforms into clear coolness, the sword trees become towering forests.
Ascending to the Vermilion Mansion, they proceed directly to the Primordial Lord.
Relying further on the companions of the Dao, together we invoke.

*Recite the Precious Name of Azure Florescence*

Having heard the sacred name, we meditate upon the honored countenance.
Vast are the merits, dispelling calamities and erasing sins.
Through the power of the Dao and the scriptures, we aid the dark blessings to ascend;
By the wondrous sounds of the Dharma, we awaken the soul’s deportment to enlightenment.
The true scriptures hold mysteries, the secret canon is solemnly proclaimed.
The ritual assembly takes refuge, reciting with utmost sincerity.

The *Sutra of Salvation from Suffering*—now, as jade tablets inscribe celestial script and sounds reach the ten directions, the precious name of the Jade Tone resounds through all heavens. May the golden youths attending incense trace fragrant sigils in the sky; may the jade lads presenting scriptures advance the sacred texts upon the tablets. Thus shall sins vanish across kalpas, and blessings descend upon this very hour. The living and the dead alike receive the grace of flourishing peace; all beings, moving and still, perceive the virtue of life’s completion. Such wondrous power adorns all things universally.

The three wretched paths cease their tormenting toils; the nine nights end their bitter agonies. Then, all beings—whether noble or humble, whether dimly stirring or fully sentient—together board the vessel of the Six Perfections and ascend to the realm of the Three Purities.

With utmost sincerity, we bow our heads in reverence and gratitude to the Most High, the Void Sovereign, the True and Orthodox Three Treasures.

Herein concludes the *Precious Repentance for the Ascension of the Merciful Honored One*, now offered in dedication.
