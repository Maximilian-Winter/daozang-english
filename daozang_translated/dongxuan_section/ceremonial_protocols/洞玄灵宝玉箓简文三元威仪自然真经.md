The Heavenly Worthy said: Within the Middle Prime Palace of the Wondrous Treasure, there were originally three divisions of dignified observances totaling two thousand four hundred articles. From the era of Dragon Han to the first year of Red Clarity, the Supreme Sages compiled and edited them, extracting the essentials for practical use. Thus, eighty articles were transmitted to the perfected below who were destined for the Dao, and these are now in circulation.

The Heavenly Worthy addressed the Most High Lord of the Great Dao, saying: The *Divine Immortals* section of the *Jade Register Abridged Text of the Middle Prime Palace of the Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure* originally comprised three parts—Upper Prime, Middle Prime, and Lower Prime—each containing eight hundred articles on dignified observances, totaling two thousand four hundred articles across the three parts. All were inscribed in gold and jade characters, and the Left Duke of the Immortals’ Capital compiled them in the Middle Prime Palace. After the Dragon Han era, they sank into chaos, their texts altered and largely incomplete. In the first year of the Vermilion Brightness, the Supreme Sages edited and collated them, extracting essentials into eighty articles per part, totaling two hundred forty articles across the three parts, which were then concealed in the Three Prime Palaces. Two hundred forty Jade Maidens of the Golden Dawn and two hundred forty Golden Lads of the Jade Morn were assigned to burn incense and attend the scriptures, inspecting for omissions and negligence. According to the mysterious statutes, they are transmitted once every forty thousand kalpas. When divine perfected beings descend to teach, the cycle of transmission is accelerated, requiring true persons to descend and instruct the world every four hundred years, with permission granted for three transmissions within forty years. If the allotted time is not fulfilled and the numinous texts are lightly disseminated, one’s seven ancestors will be imprisoned in hell, bearing the wind’s blades for ten thousand kalpas without release.

The Heavenly Worthy said: Natural dignified observances are the bearing of all heavens and the ritual standards of perfected beings. Those who behold them possess the karmic conditions of a hundred million kalpas, their former lives having borne names inscribed on golden tablets and jade registers, destined for transcendence among the ranks of divine immortals. Thus, they encounter these texts to fulfill their authenticity. Those who cultivate them will ride dragon chariots and ascend at dawn; those who uphold them will enable their seven ancestors to depart hell and ascend to heaven, roaming freely in the Jade Immortals’ Palace of the Middle Prime, where gates and households remain serene, untouched by the ten thousand calamities, revered by the three realms, and attended by the ten thousand spirits at their gates.

The Dao is most revered and noble—it ought to be kept sacred and concealed.

The Most High bows in reverence, offering obeisance to receive these essential words.
