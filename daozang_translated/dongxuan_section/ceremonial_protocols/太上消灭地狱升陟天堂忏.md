With solemn dignity and reverent devotion,
We focus our minds in worship, reciting and upholding the secret jade scrolls, the profound and subtle treasures of the mystic vault.

May the grace of Heaven universally deliver,
May the hells all open wide,
May the sun of wisdom shine upon them,
May the light of compassion gather and receive them.

With focused minds we worship, reciting and upholding the sacred texts of the Three Treasures, the holy standards of the Nine Purities.

May great beneficence and salvation extend,
Pervading the dark and hidden realms,
Delivering beings to the Southern Palace,
Transforming and rebirthing them in the Northern Mansion.

With focused minds we worship, reciting and upholding the true teachings of the Ten Caves, the celestial hymns of the myriad heavens.

May divine compassion rescue and uplift,
May the mysterious transformation spread far and wide,
Wherever the paths of darkness lie,
May all receive extraordinary blessings.

Now, as we prepare to perform the jade register rites,
Fulfilling the golden precepts,
The Most Sacred opens the way,
The host of perfected beings ascends in their chariots.

Thus, the Nine Dark Realms converge,
The Five Sufferings all heed,
We turn and offer, praising in accordance with the Dharma.

At that time, the Most High Lord of the Primordial Beginning,
Residing in the wondrous realm of the Nine Purities, within the Three Primordials’ Jeweled Palace,
Seated upon the Kalpa-Blade Terrace amid the Qianmu Grove,
Together with the Most High Lord of the Dao, the Most High Lord Lao,
The host of celestial sages, the honored deities of the Three Realms,
The officials of the Nine Bureaus and Three Offices,
The Four Directors and Five Emperors,
The Inspecting Destiny Youths, the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct,
All arrived at once,
Riding eightfold jade chariots, five-colored jasper carriages,
Unicorns and feathered steeds,
Phoenix canopies and dragon banners,
Chanting the cave scriptures, praising the jeweled throne.

Thereupon, the Most High Lord of the Primordial Beginning,
Moved by great compassion,
Emitted rays of light,
Illuminating the Nine Dark Hells of the Underworld,
Opening all the nether bureaus and the Fengdu courts.

The assembly exclaimed:
“By what cause today,
After eons of longing,
Dwelling in eternal darkness,
Do we now receive this illumination?”

The Most High Lord of the Primordial Beginning commanded:
The Great Emperor of the Northern Capital,
The Judging Officials of the Five Emperors,
The clerks of the Six Palaces,
Ox-Headed Ghost Soldiers,
Tiger-Eyed Divine Kings,
The great demons of the Three Realms,
The multitude of souls in the Nine Dark Realms—
All the Six Palaces,
The Nine Bureaus recording life and death,
The twelve river sources,
The twenty-four prisons,
The Southern Water Assembly Palace,
The Northern Sea’s Eternal Night Court—
All received the great compassion of Heaven,
The sacred path was widely opened,
The wondrous precepts of the Nine Perfected were expounded,
To aid the dark paths of the Five Destinies.

The Fengdu of twenty-six hundred li,
The eighty-four thousand layers of ghostly prisons,
A vast and boundless sea of suffering, churning snow-white waves a thousand fathoms deep;
A distant and endless River of Ashes, surging with smoke and waves in ten thousand forms.
No tree unpierced by frost blades,
No mountain unlined with wind knives.
Forever without the chance for deliverance,
One can only sigh at the path of sinking.
Thus we look up, relying on the precious incense,
Specially expounding the true teachings.
Proclaiming the sacred names, they universally respond in the ten directions;
Raising the sounds of the Dharma, they soar afar through the three realms.
May it be that grace descends from above,
Extending even to the hidden souls.
We now earnestly contemplate the Dao altar,
Repenting and removing the knife mountains and sword trees of hell,
Freeing them from the boiling cauldrons and furnace coals of hell.
The hells of scorching iron beds and copper pillars,
The hells of searing flames,
The hells of wheeling fire chariots and blade wheels,
The hells of thunderous plows and tongue-ripping.

The **Torture Hell**, where bodies are nailed and sawn asunder.
The **Severing Hell**, where iron nets rend limbs from joints.
The **Parting Hell**, where fire pits roast and sear.
The **Fierce Hell**, where blades and claws rend flesh.
The **Grappling Hell**, where tigers, wolves, eagles, and hounds maul.
The **Mutilation Hell**, where iron pellets are swallowed and devoured.
The **Festering Hell**, where dark mountains of rotting flesh rise.
The **Hacking Hell**, where molten bronze is drunk and molten iron imbibed.
The **Dissolving Hell**, where brine and freezing ice corrode.
The **Splitting Hell**, where the **Great Iron Enclosure Mountain Gate Hell** and the **Lesser Iron Enclosure Mountain Gate Hell** stand;
the **Iron Horse Iron Ox Hell**, the **Iron Donkey Iron Bird Hell**,
the **Iron Mountain Iron Chamber Hell**, the **Iron Chariot Iron Armor Hell**,
the **Flying Blades and Lightning Hell**, the **Dismembered Body and Severed Head Hell**,
the **Eight Cold and Eight Extreme Hells**, the **Two-Tongued and Two-Stone Hell**,
the **Burning Hands and Scorching Feet Hell**, the **Flayed Skin and Blood-Drinking Hell**,
the **Excrement and Urine Hell**, the **Minced Flesh Hell**,
the **( ) Cauldron Hell**, the **Collapsing and Burial Hell**,
the **Apapa Hell**, the **Apopo Hell**,
the **Atata Hell**, the **Arara Hell**—
such are the searing flames and fierce fires,
the biting cold and freezing ice.
Without repentance and recitation, sin and karma cannot be purged.

Thus, in accordance with the teachings and rites,
we bow in submission to the Dao’s conditions,
invoking this morning’s incense and flame,
to relieve the suffering of past kalpas and distant origins,
to rescue the benighted from the nine nights,
to extricate the tormented from the eight gates.
Moved by the sorrow of Mount Tai,
we break the stagnation of Fengdu,
hoping for the enlightened power’s grace,
to bathe in the radiance of divine compassion.

Now, with focused intent, we perform the rites.
With sincere devotion, we take refuge in the **Heavenly Worthy who Eradicates Past Karma**.
With sincere devotion, we take refuge in the **Heavenly Worthy who Delivers Sunken Souls**.
With sincere devotion, we take refuge in the **Heavenly Worthy who Severs the Three Evils**.
With sincere devotion, we take refuge in the **Heavenly Worthy who Ascends the Nine Dark Realms**.
With sincere devotion, we take refuge in the **Heavenly Worthy of Penglai’s Transformed Traces**.
With sincere devotion, we take refuge in the **Heavenly Worthy of Kunlun’s Soaring Form**.
With sincere devotion, we take refuge in the **Heavenly Worthy of Ascending Ao Island**.
With sincere devotion, we take refuge in the **Heavenly Worthy of Linzhou’s Karmic Convergence**.
With sincere devotion, we take refuge in the **Heavenly Worthy who Delivers All Without Exception**.
With sincere devotion, we take refuge in the **Heavenly Worthy who Answers Every Prayer**.
With sincere devotion, we take refuge in the **Perfected One of Great Compassion and Great Mercy, Savior from Suffering**.
With sincere devotion, we take refuge in the **Perfected One of Great Compassion and Great Mercy, Deliverer from Tribulation**.
With sincere devotion, we take refuge in the **Perfected One of Great Compassion and Great Mercy, Eradicator of Sin**.
With sincere devotion, we take refuge in the **Perfected One of Great Compassion and Great Mercy, Liberator from Calamity**.

We further repent before all the great hells,
the great ghostly prisons,
the sevenfold iron cities,
the sevenfold iron nets,
where ox-headed jailers stand—
sixty-two eyes and eight heads,
eighteen horns and nine tails,
brandishing iron halberds in their hands,
shooting iron pellets from their eyes.
Sinners are pierced from crown to sole,
pain searing bone and marrow,
agony piercing heart and liver,
begging for life yet denied,
pleading for death yet withheld.
Ground by stone mills through kalpas of rebirth,
pounded by iron pestles without respite,
smoke and fire intertwine,
birds and beasts strike and maul.
All this is the retribution of evil paths,
the summons of past karma.
Deprived of the Three Lights,
unaware of the Three Treasures.

Then the **Primordial Heavenly Worthy** declared:
If one copies this scripture,
cherishes its meaning,
quietly recites and establishes altars with images,
devoutly practices the Dao and scatters flowers,
then the **Vajra Divine Kings**, the **Heavenly Soldiers and Mighties**,
the **Five Emperors of the Three Realms**, and all spirits
will widely bestow compassion,
abundantly bring blessings,
restore bones to life,
refine form into truth.
Merciful light will gaze upon the sentient,
mysterious creation will pervade the unbounded.
Where jade bells chime, gates of salvation open;
when jade chimes resound, paths of proclamation unfold.
Relying on the wondrous model of the Nine Heavens,
entrusted to the true teachings of the Ten Caves,
ice courts transform into jade lands,
fire chambers become treasure realms.
Sword trees shatter, blade mountains break.
Thus, the long-night’s sinking shall all attain this morning’s liberation.

The Scripture concludes:
Those who hear the scripture and attain the Dao shall follow their thoughts to rebirth.
Boundless mysterious merit,
limitless enlightened grace.
May past enmities dissolve,
and future karmic ties converge.
May the three evil paths be purged,
the eight difficulties averted.
Those who hear the scripture and attain the Dao shall follow their thoughts to rebirth.
Immeasurable virtuous causes,
inexhaustible sacred power.
May the cycles of rebirth cease,
entanglements forever severed.
May evil destinies brighten,
lost souls be refined.
Those who hear the scripture and attain the Dao shall follow their thoughts to rebirth.
Infinite good roots,
unfathomable wondrous force.
May the Four Offices flow without obstruction,
the Nine Bureaus silently connect.
May souls ascend the Vermilion Mound,
spirits wander the Purple Palace.

Now that repentance is complete and rites concluded,
each enveloped in clouds of compassion,
we ascend together to the pure realm.
Thus, rainbow banners guide our steps,
feathered chariots arrive in splendor.
We soar into the great void,
carefree in the realm of ultimate bliss.

**Praise of the Scripture:**
Behold the wondrous canon of the highest rank,
the treasure trove of the central heavens,
inscribed with phoenix scripts and dragon seals,
adorned with soaring clouds and dewdrop characters.
Its merit transforms and transcends,
its power elevates and advances.
Thus, the scripture clarifies the Dao,
and the Dao establishes the scripture.
Without diligent recitation,
how can the bonds of entanglement be undone?
Those who bear sins—teeth bared, hair unbound—
those who harbor grievances—feathered and furred—
all endure water, fire, wind, and blades,
revolving through birth and death,
gathering and dispersing in the netherworld,
facing interrogation in the dark courts.
Therefore, we offer these resources,
extending repentance and deliverance.

We humbly invoke the **Golden Maidens of Incense** and the **Jade Lads of Scriptures**,
who open the eight gates above,
connect the five portals below,
proclaiming the immortal ranks of reborn souls,
transmitting the divine decrees of appointed spirits.
They enable those who turn toward them to enter the blessed immortal realms,
those who listen attentively to transcend the evil destinies.
They calm the waves of the River of Love,
provide the ferry across the Sea of Suffering.
They widely lay the Dharma bridge,
guiding all to the Dao’s shore.
Swiftly, we attend the rainbow banners and feathered regalia,
forever accompanying the crane-drawn and phoenix-borne chariots.

Amidst the seven-jeweled sutra platforms they wander and delight,
in the three-pure grotto-palaces they find joy.
The nine-flowered melodies conclude,
the myriad stones’ voices harmonize.
Having received the profound compassion,
they accomplish return to the wondrous Dao.

Now, at this dawn observance,
with the remnants of incense and flame,
we humbly pray for our ancestors of former generations,
who have not yet ascended;
for our recently departed kin,
still dwelling in the nether darkness.
May their sin-records be erased,
their evil traces swept away,
so they may swiftly be delivered by the Han Bureau,
granted passage through the open gates of Fengdu.
Together they ascend to the heavens of utmost bliss,
each gathering in the realms of rebirth.

We reflect upon our own coarse and careless transgressions,
which have entangled us in karmic bonds.
All greed for savor that harms,
all passions that wound living things—
these become knots of enmity in life,
and when life ends, the retribution body bears them.
Without the gate of repentance and redemption,
the path of entanglement remains unsolved.
Bearing grievances and debts,
all long for freedom.
Feathered flocks and furred herds,
all receive transformation.
The power of repentance and purification shines forth,
so body and speech are free from hindrance.

Reverently we invoke the Compassionate Venerables of the Golden Towers,
the Supreme Sages of the Jade Capital,
who widely open their mercy,
and specially accept our earnest prayers.
May the time of returning to simplicity
pass without the eight obstructions;
may the dawn of restoring purity
not traverse the three paths.

Before the Nine-Splendor Terrace, riding the wind and commanding qi;
Within the Five-Luminance Palace, meeting the Dao and uniting with the Real.
On white tablets, ascending to life—
the thirty-two heavens’ red writ confers destiny;
On yellow registers, erasing death—
the hundred-twenty bureaus’ black ledgers strike out names.
Those past receive grace,
those present gain blessings.
Establishing the hundred sacred titles of Purple Emptiness,
they respond to the myriad layers of the cinnabar heavens’ divine wisdom.
When the jeweled scroll unfurls,
it further strengthens the power of cultivation;
Where the numinous scripture is recited,
there arises the heart of dawn reverence.
Precious incense unceasing through the two watches,
wisdom torches ever-burning through midnight.
Boundless wondrous goodness,
measureless supreme causes.
Greatly opening the gate of refuge,
widely extending repentance.
The *Highest’s Repentance for Eliminating Hell and Ascending to Heaven* is now complete.
