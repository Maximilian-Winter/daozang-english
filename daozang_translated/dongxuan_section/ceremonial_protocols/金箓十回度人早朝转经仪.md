**Early Morning Sutra-Circulation Ritual for the Tenfold Golden Sutra to Deliver All Beings**

**Preface to the Ritual Hall**

**Ritual Proceedings**

The High Master kneels and begins the invocation:
*"Your humble disciple, [Name], with utmost reverence, now humbly invokes the Most Authentic Daoist Master of the Golden Sutra, the Supreme Way (Dao) and the Most Mysterious Treasure—True Lord, the Golden Sutra Master, the Master of the Sacred Scripture, the Master of the Register, the Master of Deliverance, the Most Upright Celestial Master, the Female Master’s Lineage Successor, and the Golden Sutra Supervising Master of the Pure Fast—True Lord.*

*With the sacred diagram revealed in crimson light (赤明开图), and the sacred grains of millet bestowed (黍珠授受), a single lineage of venerable teachers.*

*In deep respect, I gaze upon Your divine benevolence and await Your compassionate insight.*

*Your disciple hears that the Original Beginning (元始) taught the Sutra in a single session, completing it in one cycle. But the Tenfold Circulation of the Golden Sutra, overseen by the Most Authentic Daoist Master, delivers all beings in the East and reaches even to the lowest realms—no obstacle remains unvanquished, no calamity unforsaken. It grants life daily, and it transforms beings daily.*

*Now, as I am to proclaim the Sutra’s teachings, I first humbly seek Your solemn authority.*

*Today, I enter the ritual hall, leading the assembled officials, and ascend the platform to recite the *Supreme Most Authentic Cavernous Mysteries, Golden Sutra of Boundless Deliverance for All Beings—First Rank of Marvelous Scripture* (太上洞玄灵宝无量度人上品妙经) from the First to the Fourth Circulation.*

*With reverence, I pray for the extension of Your boundless life and the preservation of Heaven’s eternal existence. May Your divine virtue (德) be the foundation of this ritual assembly.*

*May the sincerity of all participants ascend to the heavens, and may the mysterious blessings shine brightly.*

*May all sentient beings alike share in these merits.*

*I await Your gracious command to perform the Sutra’s rites.*

*Your disciple, though unworthy, dares not violate Your solemn precepts. My devout prayers are beyond expression.*

*With the assembled officials, I ascend the platform and solemnly enact the prescribed rites.*

*[Recitation of the Daoist Invocation to lead the procession to the hall’s entrance]*

**Ritual Proceedings: Invitation of the Spirit King** (降神王)"

**Invocation to the Celestial Assembly**

With deepest reverence, I, [Name], humbly address the Ten Directions’ Boundless Flight-Heaven Spirit Kings—Great Saints of Immortal Life, the Limitless Savior Lords; the Ten Directions’ Flight-Heaven Envoys; the Ten Heavens’ Jade Maidens; and all the Celestial Spirits and Officials of the Ten Directions.

May Your boundless compassion turn Your radiant gaze upon us. With solemnity, I open this sacred text to reveal its mysteries, preparing to recite the Eight Canons of the Sutra while first paying homage to the Ten Directions and assuming the role of instructor.

I pray for Your divine presence to descend upon this Daoist hall. For all beginnings, Your guiding force is essential; for every scripture, Your blessings make recitation fruitful. The assembled devotees, in pious sincerity, offer fasting and supplication—fasting, cloud-chariots, and scattered flowers.

---

I, [Name], humbly report: In the primordial era of Vermilion Brightness, the Original Beginning issued sacred texts; the Spirit Kings received their mandates at the void-song of the Azure Palace. Together, they ascended to the Hall of Precious Millet, receiving the edicts of Jade Voice. Charged with proclaiming the celestial decrees and overseeing the Sutra’s salvific power, they thus unfolded the profound mysteries of hidden teachings, making known the subtle truths that even distant and lofty scholars cannot deceive.

Their great merits were recorded since ancient times, and their boundless blessings should be extended to all who come after. Now, with reverence, I follow Your imperial edicts to solemnly observe the Golden Talisman Great Fast, praying for the extension of Your boundless life and the preservation of Heaven’s eternal existence.

May the Vermilion Phoenix and Azure Dragon return to the celestial expanse, and may the Crimson Chariot and Green Palanquin descend to this Daoist hall. May Your golden and jade decrees forever sustain the tenfold transformations; may Your silk edicts spread Your words to all sentient beings. Above, I uphold the boundless imperial winds; below, I fulfill the humble prayers of the faithful.

With this memorial submitted, I pray for Your gracious inspection. May Your compassion extend to the Ten Directions, aligning with the creation of all beings; may Your blessings transcend the Three Realms, fulfilling the merit of protection and elevation.

Now, leading the assembly, we ascend the platform to perform the Sutra rites. The *Hua Xia* chant is invoked; the assembly ascends, offering incense. With faith, we pay homage to the Teacher, maintaining pure intent as prescribed.

The Nine-Heaven Splendor manifests its radiant glow; the vast cosmos shimmers with the True One’s luminous essence. We direct our offerings to the Central Sovereign, as the hundred spirits descend in response. The roots of suffering are severed; the Eight Hardships are dispelled. The Seven Ancestors ascend together, their blessings towering. Thus, the divine and immortal gather, the Eight Auspicious signs take flight.

The Supreme Daoist Lord of Primordial Mystery summons forth from within me the thirty-five officials of the Three Five [Celestial Bureaus], the left and right Envoys, the Incense-Bearing Golden Boys, the Speech-Conveying Jade Maidens, and the Five Emperors’ Direct-Symbol Direct-Sun Incense Officials—thirty-two in number—each emerging.

In accordance with Your command, I now pray that the Supreme Lord may descend and bestow upon me the Ten Directions’ Pure Essence *qi*, flowing into my body, so that my petition may swiftly reach the presence of the Supreme Emperor of the Thirty-Two Heavens, the Original Beginning’s Most August Deity.

I now proclaim my rank: I, [Name], with utmost sincerity, address—

The Supreme Boundless Daoist Lord of Natural Void and Original Beginning, the Most Mysterious Emperor;
The Supreme Lord of Marvelous Non-Being, the Mysterious Sovereign;
The Supreme Lord of the Highest Dao, the Celestial Jade Dawn’s Most Sacred Treasure;

The Thirty-Two Heavenly Emperors;
The Lords of Eastern Hua, Southern Polar, Western Spirit, and Northern Truth;
The Seven Treasures of the Golden Gate, the Jade Palace, the Seven Precious Towers, and the Purple Micro Upper Palace;
The Supreme Lord of the Celestial Treasure’s Most True Manifest Emperor;
The Supreme Minister, the Supreme Prime, the Supreme Protector, the Supreme Tutor;
The Most High Emperor of the Mysterious Center;
The Thirty-Six Departments of Sacred Scriptures;
The Great Daoist Master of the Mysterious Center;
The Five Emperors and Three Officials, the Four Bureaus and Nine Ministries;
The Sun, Moon, and Five Stars; the Southern Asterism and Northern Dipper; the Twenty-Eight Constellations; the Celestial Compass and Jade Balance; the Arrayed Star Spirits;

The Jade Boys and Jade Maidens, the Sutra-Bearing Jade Lads, the Three Caverns’ Sutra Attendants;
The Celestial Treasure Officials, the Three Realms’ Five Emperors, the Great Merit Magical Kings;
The Officials of the Three Realms;
The Responsive True Spirits.

With deepest reverence, I pray for Your boundless compassion to turn Your penetrating insight upon us.

I have heard: In the profound and obscure, the Dao cannot be transmitted through words alone;

「Pure and refined, the *Sutra* originates from the profound exposition of *Dharma*.

Its subtleties are elusive—mysterious and inscrutable;
Yet its practical application is all-pervading—omnifaceted and accessible.

I, a humble mortal, have observed the Celestial Treasure.
At the dawn of a single hour’s Daoic practice,
I proclaim the *Sutra* of the Four Realms to fulfill its purpose.
The earth and heavens, ghosts and gods,
Surely must perceive my devout and sincere intentions;
The four directions—east, west, south, and north—
May all hear the subtle and wondrous sounds.

With deepest reverence, I take refuge in the Limitless Dao.
With utmost sincerity, I take refuge in the *Sutra* Treasures of the Ten Directions,
And pray that all beings may open their hearts to enlightenment,
To receive, uphold, recite, and study them.

With utmost sincerity, I take refuge in the Ten Directions’ *Dao* Treasures,
And pray that all beings may arise with pure intent,
To pay homage, worship, and offer faith.

With utmost sincerity, I take refuge in the Ten Directions’ *Sutra* Masters,
And pray that all beings may universally ascend the *Dharma* Bridge,
Encountering no obstacles.

**The Host of Past Lives Praises:**
With the *Sutra*-Attending and *Sutra*-Opening sciences,
I prepare the *Enthronement Chant*,
Reflecting quietly as the *Law* dictates,
Knocking my teeth thirty-two times,
Meditating on the five-colored *qi* clouds,
Filling the chamber completely.

The Azure Dragon and White Tiger,
The Vermilion Bird and Dark Tortoise,
The Lion and White Crane,
The Phoenix—all stand guard,
To the left, right, front, and rear.

The Golden Boys and Jade Maidens,
The Five Emperors’ divine soldiers and cavalry—
Each with nine hundred million riders—
Encamp around the fasting hall.

Then I recite the *Sutra*,
The *Sutra*-Opening *Mystic Mantra*—
From the *Cloud-Signs* of the Great Void,
At the onset of the vast calamity.

Now distant, now near,
Sometimes submerged, sometimes floating.
The five directions hover,
A span beyond.

The True Human of Heavenly Perfection,
Presses the brush and begins to write.
To manifest the profound chapters,
Then to inscribe the *Soul-Symbols*.
The Primordial Beginning descends,
The *True Text* spreads forth.
Illuminating what exists,
Concealing what does not.

The afflicted may heal themselves,
The weary and ensnared find support.
The dark and hidden gain reliance,
Thus ascending to the *Immortal Assembly*.

I pray for the turning of the *Dharma* Wheel,
For the Master to inscribe the *Sutra*,
And for the *Dao* to speak:
*"Once, within the Primordial Azure Sky,
I ascended the Pure Highness through the clouds.*

*Gazing upon the Thirty-Two Heavens,
Each filled with colored *qi* clouds,*
*Overlapping in layers.*

*There are palaces and towers,
The Celestial Emperor’s crown and garments,*
*Distinct and clear.*

*This begins with the Self-Settled Spirit,*
*At the Great Yellow Assembly of the True Human.*
*Each Heaven, I knock my teeth once,*
*Bow my heart once,*
*Totaling thirty-two repetitions.*

*Then, closing my eyes and meditating,*
*The Three *Dantian* Fields emit three-colored *qi* clouds,*
*Like threads, gradually departing the body.*

*The *qi* clouds become dense,*
*First enveloping my entire form,*
*Then winding around my seat and table,*
*Leaving nothing untouched.*

*Next, they expand outward,*
*Surrounding the altar,*
*Encircling a region,*
*And after a long while, merging in obscurity with the heavens and earth.*

*Then I meditate:*
*The Azure Dragon emerges from the liver,*
*Standing to the left;*
*The White Tiger from the lungs,*
*Standing to the right;*
*The Vermilion Bird from the heart,*
*Standing before;*
*The Dark Tortoise from the kidneys,*
*Standing behind;*
*The Lion from the lower *Dantian* beneath the spleen,*
*With twelve heads standing to the left and right;*
*The White Crane from the *Nezigong* (泥丸),*
*Nine birds encircling the four directions.*

*Again, I focus on the *Six Harmonies* between the brows:*
*There is the sun and moon emerging from both eyes,*
*Each nine *chi* from the face,*
*Transforming into nine-colored circular forms,*
*Piercing through inner and outer,*
*So clear and distinct.*

*I chant the *Mystic Mantra* in secret,*
*Without letting it be heard by the ears.*
*After the chanting,*
*I draw in the eight pathways of the Eastern Azure *qi*,
*Eight pathways of the Southern Vermilion *qi* into the heart,*
*Eight pathways of the Western White *qi* into the lungs,*
*Eight pathways of the Northern Black *qi* into the kidneys,*
*With utmost sincerity.*

*Next, I recite the second through ninth sections of this chapter,*
*No longer reciting the *Dao* Lord’s Grand Preface,*
*But beginning from this chapter.*

*The tenth section follows the first,*
*Reciting the Preface,*
*Reflecting and meditating.*

*After completing the *Sutra* recitation,*
*I perform the *Dissolution Chant*,
*The *Sutra*-Attending Reflection,*
*And prepare the *Wisdom and Benevolence Praise*.*

*The Master and the fasting officials then proceed to the Eastern direction,*
*Lighting incense and bowing again.*

*I, in reverence, rotate through the Eight Decks,*
*As the *Sutra* session begins;
*Entering the Nine Enclosures,*
*The Emperor’s Seat attends in person."*

With deepest reverence to the **Eastern Limitless Supreme Spirit-Jewel Celestial Venerable Sovereign**,
The **Eastern Limitless Flying-Heaven Divine King, Eternal Saint of Boundless Salvation, Sovereign of All**,
Riding the *Zhen* [thunder] to govern Spring, embodying the Primordial to nurture all things.

Beneath the *Qian* [cypress] grove, You repeatedly imparted the subtle words of the Golden Mouth;
Within the *Shu* [millet]-pearl, I personally received the secret seal of the Jade Capital.

May You condescend to turn Your divine gaze,
Piercing through the sincerity of this fasting ritual.

The Celestial Sovereign records merit,
Entrusting the *Chao* [morning court] audience to bear witness;
The Eastern Hua [Celestial Bureau] oversees calculations,
Lending the *Hua* [transformation]-brush to inscribe this offering.

With the formal petition prepared,
I now solemnly proclaim it.

**Proclamation of the Petition** – *Burning the Offering*
**Sutra-Attending Second Session** – *Opening the Sutra Rites*
**Laying the Seat Chant**
**Requesting the Transmission of the *Dharma* Discourse**
**The Master Inscribes the Sutra**
**The Assembly Recites Complete**
**Laying the Seat Chant**
**Sutra-Attending Reflection**
**Wisdom and Benevolence Praise**,
Then turning toward the **Southern Direction**.

With reverence, I unfold the **Jade Treasury Scriptures**,
Having fulfilled the Sutra’s merit,
And once more stand before the **Jade Stair**—
Only the Heavenly Compassion returns to Heaven,
Listening with threefold grace.

With deepest reverence to the **Southern Limitless Supreme Spirit-Jewel Celestial Venerable Sovereign**,
The **Southern Limitless Flying-Heaven Divine King, Eternal Saint of Boundless Salvation, Sovereign of All**,
Who attains Oneness to purify, turns toward Clarity, and governs with the *Dao*.

Establishing teachings for the ages, You entrust the full heart to propagate the Way;
Overseeing the True to guide sentient beings, You surely will not fail this fasting plea.

May You observe my sincerity,
Recording the Sutra’s merit.

The **Supreme Pole** is secure, blessed by the One;
The **Imperial Design** vast, extending eternally without bound.

With the formal petition prepared,
I now solemnly proclaim it.

**Proclamation of the Petition** – *Burning the Offering*

**Third Session of the Sutra Proclamation – Opening the Sutra Rites**
*(Ritual sequence follows the second session)*

Turning to the **Western Quarter**, offering incense, and bowing twice,
I, with humble reverence, grasp the teachings of the Three Sovereigns,
Coarsely comprehending the **Dao**’s essence.
With unceasing sincerity, I trust my plea will reach the **Heavenly Heart**.

With deepest reverence to the **Western Limitless Supreme Spirit-Jewel Celestial Venerable Sovereign**,
The **Western Limitless Flying-Heaven Divine King, Eternal Saint of Boundless Salvation, Sovereign of All**,
Whose merit is ever-renewing, whose station is in the **Luminous Marsh**.

In days past, the **Floating Lotus Assembly** gathered like fine rain and dense mist;
Now, at the **Spirit-Jewel Ritual Altar**, You surely descend like clouds floating in the void.

May You record merit in the **Mysterious Capital’s** realm,
And inscribe virtue in the **Pure Spirit’s** hall.

Your **sacred virtue** ever-renews, enduring alongside Heaven and Earth;
Your **Imperial Design** vast as the heavens, equal in honor to **Songshan and Huashan**.

With the formal petition prepared,
I now solemnly proclaim it.

**Proclamation of the Petition** – *Burning the Offering*

---

**Fourth Session of the Sutra Proclamation – Opening the Sutra Rites**
*(Ritual sequence follows the second session)*

Turning to the **Northern Quarter**, offering incense, and bowing twice,
I, with humble reverence, grasp the **Jade Script Dragon Text**,
Its profound meanings now fully encompassing the four directions;
The **Jade Tripod and Feathered Canopy** gather in unison at the **Spirit Altar**.

With deepest reverence to the **Northern Limitless Supreme Spirit-Jewel Celestial Venerable Sovereign**,
The **Northern Limitless Flying-Heaven Divine King, Eternal Saint of Boundless Salvation, Sovereign of All**,
Whose kindness is as boundless as Heaven—
*"Laboring in the Abyss"* (曰劳乎坎).

Receiving the **Heart Seal of Millet-Pearls**, the **Dao** permeates the **Three Vehicles**;
Spreading the **Spirit-Jewel Sect’s** teachings, Your grace extends to all sentient beings.

May You inscribe my name upon the **Golden Tablets**,
And record virtue in the **Jade Scripts**.

The **Luminaries** shine in the **Purple Micro**, bestowing longevity and prosperity;
The **Six Dragons** descend upon the **Yellow Path**, broadly bestowing nurturing grace.

With the formal petition prepared,
I now solemnly proclaim it.

**Proclamation of the Petition** – *Burning the Offering*

**Sutra of the Three Hearings – Vow of Renewal**

**The Furnace Restored as Before**

The **Celestial Worthies and Immortal Officials**, the **Golden Boys and Jade Girls**, the **Five Emperors and Five Sacred Peaks’ Immortals and True Persons**, the **Three Qi Orthodox Deities**, the **Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords**, the **Heavenly and Earthly Immortals**, the **Five Spirit Officials of Fragrance**—

Now, by summoning the **Ten Directions’ Orthodox Qi**, the **Golden Elixir** and **Jade Grass** naturally arise, their **spirit-petals** blooming.

The **Hundred Spirits and True Ones** gather here before the **Incense-Fire Furnace**.

I now vow that the **Ten Directions’ Immortal Boys and Jade Girls** shall attend to the **fragrant smoke**, conveying my previous petition directly to the **Supreme Emperor of the Thirty-Two Heavens, the Original Beginning Dao/Way’s Most Exalted Sovereign**.

**Preserve the Four Spirits**, each returning to their **Five Viscera and Ten Directions’ Heavenly True Selves**, ascending upon the clouds and departing.

Next, with **three-colored clouds**, swallow into the **Three Elixir Fields**, strike the teeth **three times**, and swallow the saliva **three passes**.

**Directly descending from the Upper Platform to the Lower Platform**, I go to the **curtain to thank the Teacher**.

**The Teacher offers incense and bows twice**.

With utmost reverence, **Your humble servant [Name]**, in sincere devotion, now humbly presents this petition to:

**The True Lord of the *Lingbao* Mystic Middle Great Dao Master**,
**The *Lingbao* Sutra Master Lord, the Register Master Lord, the Salvation Master Lord**,
**The Orthodox Celestial Master Lord**,
**The Female Lineage, Successor, and System Master Lord**,
**The *Lingbao* Supervising Fasting Great Dao Master True Lord**,
**The *Chiming* Opener of Diagrams, the Millet-Pearl Transmission Lineage’s Patriarch**.

With deepest reverence, I **behold Your Teacherly kindness**, humbly gazing and offering gratitude with sincerity.

**Your humble servant**, in past days, led the **official assembly**, ascending the platform to recite the *Supreme Dao/Way’s Mystic *Lingbao* Sutra of Boundless Salvation for the Upper Grade* from the **First Pervasion to the Fourth Pervasion**, fortunate in its completeness, directly praying for **Ten Thousand Years of Longevity** and **Heaven’s Eternal Preservation**.

By **Your Teacher’s grace**, I am **secretly upheld and silently guided**.

Now, I **extend my thanks in reverence**, still hoping to fulfill the end.

Awaiting the time of **the Lingering Phoenix’s Scrolls** and the day of **the Jade Halter’s Return**, I shall **repay virtue with virtue**, engraving it upon **bone and heart**.

**Above, I propagate the *Lingbao* doctrines** to **broaden the Dao/Way of Compassion**.

Your humble servants **dare to trespass upon Your Teacher’s severity**, our **lowly sentiments know no bounds**—we are **utterly trembling with awe**.

**Past deeds, mindful of virtue.**

**"The Golden Talisman Tenfold Rites of Early Morning Scripture-Recitation for Salvation are now complete."**
