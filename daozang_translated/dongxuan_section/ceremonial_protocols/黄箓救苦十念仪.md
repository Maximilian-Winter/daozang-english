**Yellow Talisman Ten Invocations Rite – Ritual Procedure**

With reverence, we acknowledge that heaven covers and earth bears, secretly operating the vital mechanisms of life and transformation; as days pass and months turn, all are subject to the waxing and waning of light. Yet even as spring blooms and autumn fades, as yang breathes and yin dissipates, none can escape the appointed time of change, nor avoid the cycle of rebirth. How much more so for humanity—bound to the Three Realms, inheriting the Five Constants—whose life is as fleeting as the flash of a spark or the flicker of lightning. Unless one attains the Dao, how may one abide in the eternal?

Now, though this departed one had no grave transgressions, their nature was pure and harmonious, their heart inclined toward the highest virtue. They vainly wished for the longevity of the *chun* and *song* trees, or the endurance of metal and stone. Yet the Three Pengs and Two Jians hasten their decline, and the Four Great Elements and hundred limbs cannot halt their passage. Thus, separation is bitter, and longing brings sorrow. Grieving the depth of posthumous bonds, they weigh heavily upon the weight of prior obligations.

Therefore, we solemnly assemble this sacred gathering, devoutly preparing precious offerings, invoking the lofty immortals of the Three Realms and proclaiming the Ten Radiant Titles. May their spirit and soul remain unobscured, as if alive. Freed from worldly ties, they now reverently listen to the Dao.

**The Assembly Recites the Ten Invocations in Order**

*First Invocation:*
Proclaim to the departed soul: "I take refuge in the supreme Dao Treasure, the Ten-Directional Great Saints, the Three Supreme Sovereigns. Countless kalpas have they liberated beings; before heaven’s establishment, they founded the teaching. Their boundless compassion extends to all life, and their radiant forms manifest in myriad transformations. As shadows follow sound and responses align with intent, their blessings are boundless in this world and the next. Thus, in this life and all future existences, one must always hold them in faith and reverence."

*Second Invocation:*
Proclaim to the departed soul: "I take refuge in the supreme Scripture Treasure, the Ten-Directional Supreme Saints. Their sacred texts are inscribed with jade characters and golden script, dragon-sealed and phoenix-embossed, comprising thirty-six divisions and eighteen thousand sutras. They guide the lost to the shore of enlightenment, and each verse erases sins while every phrase dissolves offenses. Thus, in this life and all future existences, one must always hold them in faith and reverence."

*Third Invocation:*
Proclaim to the departed soul: "I take refuge in the supreme Teacher Treasure, the Mystic Great Saints, the Three Ancient Masters, the Orthodox One True Person, the Three Heavenly Patriarchs, the Ten-Directional World’s Dao-attained Immortals. They transmit the Dao and impart the scriptures, awakening all beings. They are the true parents, the Great Physician Kings. Thus, in this life and all future existences, one must always hold them in faith and reverence."

With reverence, we acknowledge that the Dao offers the path to transcendence, while scriptures provide the stages of transformation. Sacred texts, adorned with jade and silk, praise the virtues; divine melodies guide the soul to ascend. Human life’s fleeting moments cannot be retained—why linger in regret? Yet the immortal realm’s celestial cultivation is effortless—let them ascend at will. Having heard the Three Treasures’ names, we now proclaim the Ten Radiant Titles.

**Homage and Invocation to All Ten-Directional Heavenly Sovereigns for the Departed’s Sincere Repentance**

*First Repentance:*
With sincere repentance, for the departed’s past transgressions in bodily conduct, whose sins are boundless and countless. In every movement and pause, they were stained by worldly defilements. Adorned in luxury, they indulged in idle pleasures, arrogantly scorned others. Now, before the Supreme Compassionate Lord, they humbly confess their faults. May the departed’s bodily sins be utterly erased, never to arise again. May they attain purity in the Immortal Realm and forever escape the sufferings of the Three Paths.

All bow in unison, offering gratitude to the Supreme Orthodox Three Treasures.

*Second Repentance:*
With sincere repentance, for the departed’s past transgressions in verbal conduct, whose sins are boundless and countless.

**Third Repentance:**
With sincere repentance, for the departed’s past transgressions in verbal conduct—
the sins of double-tongued deceit and idle speech,
defaming the true **Dharma** and **sutra** teachings.
They devoured the flesh of living beings,
humiliated those of the world.
Now, before the Supreme Compassionate Lord,
they humbly confess their faults.
May the departed’s verbal sins be utterly erased,
never to arise again.
May they forever abandon slanderous words,
constantly recite the true **Dharma** and **sutra** teachings.

All bow in unison, offering gratitude to the Supreme Orthodox Three Treasures.

**Fourth Repentance:**
With sincere repentance, for the departed’s past transgressions in mental conduct—
the sins of **heart**,
whose **heart**-born offenses are boundless and countless.
Anger and joy, love and hatred of the **Sangha**,
all arise from the mind.
Greed, desire, and delusion,
jealousy and envy of the world.
Now, before the Supreme Compassionate Lord,
they humbly confess their faults.
May the departed’s mental sins be utterly erased,
never to arise again.
May their wisdom and insight be suddenly awakened,
penetrating the profound **Dao/Way** of the **Him** (immortals).

All bow in unison, offering gratitude to the Supreme Orthodox Three Treasures.

**Fifth Repentance:**
With sincere repentance, for the departed’s past transgressions—
the sins of greed, anger, and delusion,
of licentiousness, theft, killing, and life’s transgressions;
of defaming the **Dharma** and **sutra**, abandoning reliance,
of blaming the **Dao/Way** and reproaching the teacher, breaking vows.
Mind and body in ceaseless delusion,
ears and eyes ever greedy, never at rest.
Past, present, and future—
the three lifetimes’ roots of sin are immeasurable.
This day they vow to confess their faults,
and may all past hindrances and vexations be erased.
Their words now humbly laid before the **Dao/Way**,
the **saints** shall surely witness and absolve them.

All bow in unison, offering gratitude to the Supreme Orthodox Three Treasures.

**Sixth Repentance:**
With sincere repentance, for the departed’s past transgressions—
the sins of ears, eyes, nose, tongue, body, and mind,
the six passions, six desires, and six senses.
The clamor of pipes and strings, few true sounds,
lavish purple adornments, colors not pure.
Competing for fragrance in lotus and musk,
horses and carriages prancing in verse and revelry,
sweet and bitter tastes consumed without restraint,
joy and anger shifting, only shortening life.
The six passions ever lead to depths of ruin,
while the Three Treasures open gates of deliverance.
From this day forth, all past offenses revealed,
may all roots of sin be utterly destroyed.

All bow in unison, offering gratitude to the Supreme Orthodox Three Treasures.

**Praise and Invocation:**
From now on, they extol the Tenfold **Dao/Way**’s virtues,
countless merits of good causes,
to uplift the departed’s spirit,
ascending to the **Immortal Realm**.
May the **cloud chariot** and **crane carriage** descend from the heavens,
and the **jewel scepter** and **pearl banner** be sent to guide them.
Beneath the **cypress grove**, may they always listen to the true **sutra**,
by the **jewel moon pond**, may they often hear refined teachings.
All sins committed in life,
shall vanish with each repentant thought;
all transgressions after death,
shall be pardoned by this auspicious hour.

Each bow and each repentance,
shall erase their faults.
May their **virtue/power** be vast and towering,
removing calamities and destroying sins.
The **knife mountains** become a **jewel seat**,
the **sword trees** transform into a **cypress grove**.
The **hell guards** attain immortality,
the **ox-headed demons** ascend the **Dao/Way**.
With **holy water**, may the fires of karma be quenched,
and the **cold springs** cease their torment.
The **Five Paths** and **Three Realms** of suffering,
the **fire chariots**—all shall scatter and dissolve.
All past sins and offenses,
rooted in the **Underworld**,
the six passions unrestrained,
a thousand evils born from fate.

Mind, speech, and action—
the three **karmic deeds**,
ears, eyes, nose, tongue, and body.
May their spirit ascend to **Pilù** (the highest heaven),
and their steps fly to **Huángtíng** (the Yellow Court).
They shall pay homage to the **Jade Emperor** in the **Celestial Palace**,
and gather with the **Immortal Saints** on the **Cloud Path**.
Climbing the **pearl trees**,
playing in the **pearl ponds**.
Ascending the **effortless** halls of the **Five Peaks**,
harmonizing with the **Dao/Way**’s companions of **wuwei** (non-action).
Rising in accordance with nature,
animals and plants awaken to the **Dao/Way**.
All beings shall together reach the **shores of the Dao/Way**.
The **Yellow Talisman**’s Tenfold **Dao/Way**’s rites are now complete.
