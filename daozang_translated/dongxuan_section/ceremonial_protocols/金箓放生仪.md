**Ritual for the Release of Life**
*Pure and Impure Affairs*

In the Nine Celestial Purity,
High virtue shines upon the Most True;
Within the Six Harmonies,
One draws upon the boundless grace.

With reverence, the Daoist hearth offers sacred incense,
Ascending to the void to present petitions—
Honoring the High Worthies of the Three Realms,
The Ten Radiant Saints of the Flowery Peak,
All celestial hosts of sun, moon, stars, and constellations,
The Three Sovereigns of the Three Eons,
The Four Celestial Saints of the Northern Pole,
The Five Lords of the Numinous Treasure,
The True Lord of the Orthodox Celestial Master,
The Nine Heavenly Celestial Tribunals and their sacred assemblies,
The spirits of the Five Sacred Mountains and Five Peaks,
The shadowy saints of the Underworld,
The Great Emperor of the Watery Expanse and the Vermilion Phoenix,
And the True Sovereigns of the Three Realms and Ten Directions.

With reverence, we gaze upon the One that neither is nor is not,
Within which the void discerns the formless within the formless.
Turning radiance and returning the chariot,
We oversee the True Ones in guiding sentient life.

The servant humbly submits:
From the Primordial One, the forms of heaven, earth, and all beings were divided,
And the Dao encompassed all transformations.
All living things display the symbols of movement, stillness, flight, and concealment,
Ranked among the Three Talents.

Though their inherent endowments differ,
The essences of yin and yang remain inherent.
All crave life and abhor death,
Seeking profit and avoiding harm in equal measure;
All thirst and hunger,
Striving for sustenance and security alike.
These roots stem from the Ancestral Qi of the Primordial Origin,
And truly arise from the True Essence of the Supreme Polarity.

Yet the vulgar masses stray from benevolence,
Pursuing worldly bonds and rejecting righteousness.
On land, they set snares and nets to ensnare the multitude;
In water, they cast hooks and traps to seize life.
The hunted, startled, flee in terror—
How have they offended to suffer thus?

Now, with reverent obedience to the Imperial Edict,
We establish this Precious Hall in solemnity.
Proclaiming the Jade Standard,
We celebrate the completion of this sacred affair.
Gratefully bearing the Dao’s profound mercy,
We again uphold the Sovereign’s benevolent intent,
To redeem life itself.

Loose them into forests and wilds,
That they may roam freely and at ease;
Release them into springs and streams,
That they may swim in tranquility and joy.
Thus, all may fulfill the delight of existence,
And the boundless virtue be magnified.

With reverence, we gaze upon the Three Treasures’ Compassionate Sovereigns,
And the Nine Celestial Saints above,
Who condescend to our sincere devotion,
Piercing the depths of our hearts.
Embodying the Sovereign’s vast heaven-earth benevolence,
They extend their enlightened designs;
Thus, all things—even those that transgress the heavens or plunge into the abyss—
May forever secure the Imperial Domain.
Let all under heaven ascend together to benevolent longevity.

With bowed heads, we take refuge in the Boundless Dao.

All forms, high and low, flying and creeping,
Are born from the Ancestral Qi of the Primordial.
Through countless eons, the karmic bonds of past lives were forged—
Now, as disparate beings, we walk this path anew.
Entangled in the nets of vengeance and debt,
We are redeemed by the mercy of forests and springs.
Doing good brings auspicious blessings and eternal life,
While virtue spreads across the land, bringing peace and prosperity.

*Inconceivable merit and virtue.*

Humbly, we reflect:
To transform suffering into enlightenment,
Benevolence is vast and boundless;
With divine power, to transmute the foul into the pure,
Virtue is profound and equal.

Though the retributions of egg, womb, moisture, and transformation differ,
The mechanisms of birth, aging, sickness, and death remain the same.
Fortunate to escape the black net,
We now gather at the Pure Altar.
Having attained the state of non-birth,
We yet gain rebirth.
Having paid homage to the Holy Sovereign’s love for life,
We must ascend from thought to thoughtlessness,
Together surpassing the Dao’s lofty threshold.

Awakening to the folly of past lives’ pursuits,
Recognizing the joy of true nature’s return,
We follow the flow of causes,
Transcending awareness to dwell in ease;
We abandon contrivance to wander freely,
Realizing the Land of Blessings in festive repose.
Forever freed from the sufferings of scales, shells, feathers, and fur,
We attain the realm of tranquil, blissful life.

The virtue bestowed is not given in vain—
We must repay it as the pearls of gratitude;
The power of virtue must be steadily cultivated—
We must uphold it with the resolve of gold and stone.

With bowed heads, we take refuge in the Boundless Dao.

For countless lives, we wandered in the four forms,
Bound by karmic forces, our true nature obscured.
Fortunate to encounter the radiant light of mercy,
We cross to the other shore.
All malevolence is extinguished, debts of vengeance erased,
And we return to the land of benevolent love.
Boundless virtue knows no end—our gratitude is profound—
Secrets of blessings descend, bestowing eternal spring.

*Inconceivable merit and virtue.*

**Rite for the Release of Life**

「We humbly submit that the gathering of the wondrous virtue of tranquil repose and perfect harmony is achieved through the cultivation of lifelong refinement and practice. We pity the sentient beings, whose foolish yet vital emotions arise from the karmic debts of their past lives.

The six senses revolve endlessly, and the myriad kalpas cycle without cease.
There are hells and heavens, each with distinct ranks and paths;
There are no beings without suffering, nor creatures without life—
All, from the swiftest to the most hidden, share equally in the refining crucible of existence.

With the present **Dao/Way**’s **qi** permeating the world and the radiant light of wisdom illuminating below,
The **Supreme Sovereign** (天帝) universally reveals the blessings of the celestial nectar’s outpouring,
And all sentient beings receive the **virtue/power** of rebirth, rising from the dead.

Like clouds soaring high, the mountains deep and forests dense;
Like rivers flowing broad, the seas serene and rivers clear.
Borrowing the **virtue/power** of the **Sage Sovereign** (圣主) whose benevolence matches the heavens,
Whose love for life is profound and whose compassion is boundless,
We sow the blessings of this auspicious moment,
And extend the vast foundation of a billion ages.

We cultivate the **Spring Terrace** (春台) of the Nine Realms,
And open the **Domain of Longevity** (寿域) across the Eight Expanse.

With hearts pure and devotion sincere, we recite the **Scriptures** (灵书) as prescribed.
The **Mid-Section of the Holy Text** (灵书中篇) is now invoked—
For the merit of **release of life** (放生) past and present,
We offer boundless virtuous causes.

Relying on the **Three Jewels** (三宝) to bear witness,
We hope that all true beings may reflect upon this merit.
We humbly pray that **virtue/power** extend to grasses and trees,
And transform harmoniously to insects and fish.

Throughout the universe’s heights and depths,
The winds of benevolence blow without obstruction;
Within the heavens and earth’s round and square,
The radiant days of grace shine forth.

May all creatures, great and small, be blessed by this virtue,
And no being be left without its share.
We repay the **virtue/power** of our birth and existence,
And spread the benevolent **virtue/power** of nurturing and transformation.

All sentient beings shall return to the **True Dao/Way**.
For these causes and conditions above,
We invoke the **Inconceivable merit and virtue** of:
The **Lord of the Ten Thousand Lifespans of the Mysterious Realm** (玄都万寿天尊),
The **Lord of the Great Peace and Protection of the Realm** (太平护国天尊),
The **Lord of Compassionate Life and Saving of Beings** (好生度命天尊),
And the **Lord of Boundless Life-Bringing Merit** (福生无量天尊).

**The Golden Seal Rite for the Release of Life** is now complete.
