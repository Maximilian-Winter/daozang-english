**Ritual for the Noon Audience of the Jade Register’s Salvific Empowerment**

The ritual proceeds according to form.
All pay homage to the master, contemplating as prescribed.

**Invocation of the Divine Mantra:**
Cinnabar spirit, vermilion fire—
flaming auroras stir the winds.
The crimson wheel turns with unyielding force,
heaven’s radiance piercing the eight directions.
Bursting might enfolds all,
transforming myriad realms in mutual flux.
Molten gold scatters in vast expanse,
hosts of demons vanish without trace.
Banishing treachery, shattering evil,
illuminating the primordial merit.
Golden talismans command and restrain,
treading clouds, spurring dragons.
Chants and songs celebrate the assembly,
flower petals drift through the great void.
Divine transformations govern the course,
the four extremities secure in peace.
Prostrate before the August Emperor,
none dare fail in reverence.

**Strike the ritual drum twenty-four times.**

O Most Exalted Three Heavens’ Mysterious Primordial Three *Qi* Supreme Lord of the Dao,
O Most High Lord Lao,
summon forth from within this servant’s body:
the Three and Five Merit Officers,
the Left and Right Attendant Envoys,
the Left and Right Dragon-Riding Couriers bearing incense,
the Golden Lads Attending Incense,
the Jade Maidens Transmitting Words and Scattering Flowers,
the Five Thearchs’ Direct Talismanic Officers and Direct-Day Incense Officials—
thirty-six of each—emerge.

Emerging, they don their solemn regalia,
crowns and sashes with pendent cords.
Report to the deities of the numinous altar’s land,
and the gods and perfected of the directional domains.

This servant now ascends the altar at noon to perform the Dao rites, humbly presenting these sincerest devotions for recording and transmission. May the luminous *qi* of the Supreme Perfected of the Ten Directions and the radiant light of the Numinous Treasure descend, flowing into the bodies of this servant and all present, that the sincerity of this petition swiftly reach the august presence of the Most High Boundless Dao’s Three Clarities and Supreme Saints, the Jade Thearch of the Golden Portal of the Vast Heavens, the Compassionate Thearch of the Eastern Ultimate and Azure Mystery Thearch, the Celestial Thearch of the Purple Tenuity Northern Culmen, the Heavenly Thearch of the Purple Tenuity, the August Earthly Deity of the Imperial Mound, the Great Thearch of Eastern Azure Florescence, the Great Thearch of Southern Longevity, the Supreme Jade Thearch, the Jade Void Thearch, the Perfected Sovereign of the Mysterious Capital’s Seven-Treasure Jeweled Terrace and Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace, the Luminous August Sovereign of the Numinous Treasure, the host of Great Saints and Perfected Lords of the Ten Directions who have attained the Dao, the Venerable Masters of the Myriad Ages, the Greatly Compassionate and Greatly Merciful Savior-from-Suffering Perfected, the Deliverance Perfected, the Greatly Benevolent Perfected, the Life-Registering Perfected, the Universally Saving Perfected, the Dharma-Releasing Perfected of the Fragrant Grove Assembly, the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures, the Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Center, the Great Dharma Masters of the Three Heavens, the True Lords of the Three Masters of the Numinous Treasure Scriptures’ Transmission, the True Lords of the Orthodox Unity’s Lineage and the Three Female Masters, the officials and attendants of the Three Realms, and all numinous spirits.

This servant has heard: the myriad perfected encircle and uphold the sacred sun within wondrous majesty; the Three Ultimates return in homage, fanning the winds of benevolence through eternal bliss.

Wisdom’s radiance illumines the rainbow’s semblance,
might’s rays pierce the bearing of swords and halberds.
The name shines forth in mercy, unlocking earth’s prohibitions to summon earth’s souls;
the title revered in salvation, wielding heaven’s *qi* to restrain heaven’s spirits.
All karmic entanglements melt like ice,
the majestic winds of the ten directions stir.
Vast and profound the mysterious workings,
resplendent and awe-inspiring the sacred gaze.

We, your servants, wear jade charts upon our bodies,
our hearts entwined with sacred tablets.
In solitary chant amidst mist and clouds,
we blend and harmonize the Two *Qi* to ascend like orioles;
sun and moon flow as one,
merging the myriad dusts as ants bear their burdens.
With earnest resolve, we cherish each moment’s devotion,
with tender hearts, we advance by inches in reverence.
We tread past transgressions, tread beyond faults,
hoping to evade the stern decrees of the cinnabar registers;
we receive the talismans and proclaim virtue,
vowing to manifest our true sincerity as enduring as metal and stone.
Where the sovereign’s command descends,
it is fitting to present this memorial.
Reverently receiving the imperial edict,
we honor and cultivate the jade registers.
We dedicate these merits to such-and-such a spirit,
to ascend the celestial ranks,
to rise among the immortals and perfected beings.
In accordance with the prayer’s intent,
we offer our utmost sincerity.

Now we turn in homage to the Azure Florescence,
hoping to inscribe our names in the purple registers.
Jade terraces gather their clouds,
arraying the true steps of the jade registers;
the gates of langgan open in heaven,
encircling the precious throne of the August Void.
The sacred path bristles with the dragon-flower’s banners,
the celestial thoroughfares echo with the phoenix’s imperial progress.
Verdant canopies spread boundless,
performing the celestial music before the mushroom dais;
emerald mists drift ethereal,
flying the sacred scripts within orchid censers.
In paired ranks, solemn and majestic, we form the courtly assembly,
with the devotion of ants, we present our petitions.
May the yang’s funeral silks be unfurled,
to dispel the yin’s dust.
May the myriad beings receive grace,
and the ten splendors share in the celebration.

Today, at the noon audience,
ascending the altar to perform the Dao,
we, the assembled Dharma practitioners,
now offer the first pinch of incense.
May this incense smoke ascend directly into the void,
to make offering to the unsurpassed, most true Dao-Treasure.
We, your servants, surrender body, surrender spirit, surrender life,
prostrating ourselves, heads to the ground,
looking up in reverence to the Most High Three Worthies
and the sacred hosts of the ten directions.
May the merit of this incense
solemnly dedicate to such-and-such a spirit.
We pray that they may attend the jade capital in the presence of the sagely,
and congeal their truth in the jasper towers.
May their *qi* enter the profoundest mystery,
shading the unicorn talismans to extend their celestial cycles;
may their spirit transcend the boundless,
flourishing in the phoenix annals to perpetuate the lineage of Yao.
Now, therefore, we burn incense,
from our reverence to the master, the venerable sagely hosts,
the perfected virtues,
that after attaining the Dao,
they may eternally preserve heaven’s longevity,
harmonizing and uniting with the true Dao.

Today, at the noon audience,
ascending the altar to perform the Dao,
we, the assembled Dharma practitioners,
now offer the second pinch of incense.
May this incense smoke ascend directly into the void,
to make offering to the unsurpassed, most true Scripture-Treasure.
We, your servants, surrender body, surrender spirit, surrender life,
prostrating ourselves, heads to the ground,
looking up in reverence to the Most High Three Worthies
and the sacred hosts of the ten directions.
May the merit of this incense
dedicate to such-and-such a spirit.
We now invoke the Three Assistant Perfected Lords of the Upper Clarity Yellow Registers Institute,
to bestow the register and talismans,
and in accordance with the rites, attest to the Dao.
We pray that the Azure Florescence may confirm their register,
that they may forever wander and feast in the land of blessings;
that they may ascend the vermilion steps to perfection,
and ever roam freely in the realm of the Dao.

Now, therefore, we burn incense,
from our reverence to the master, the venerable sagely hosts,
the perfected virtues,
that after attaining the Dao,
they may ascend into the formless,
harmonizing and uniting with the true Dao.

Today, at the noon audience,
ascending the altar to perform the Dao,
we, the assembled Dharma practitioners,
now offer the third pinch of incense.
May this incense smoke ascend directly into the void,
to make offering to the unsurpassed, most true Master-Treasure.
We, your servants, surrender body, surrender spirit, surrender life,
prostrating ourselves, heads to the ground,
looking up in reverence to the Most High Three Worthies
and the sacred hosts of the ten directions.
May the merit of this incense
invoke the deathless spirits who deliver humanity,
the Lord of Longevity of the Southern Culmen,
the Great Spirit Sima who delivers the world,
the Venerable Lord Han who cherishes life,
the Southern Superintendents of Life and Records,
the revered spirits who extend life, increase destiny, and deliver from calamity,
the Nine Perfected of the Southern Marchmount,
and the Flying Heavenly Spirit-Kings of the ten directions.
Together, may they heed the talismanic command,
to escort such-and-such a spirit
and ascend to the celestial ranks.
We reverently pray that they may receive the true essence of sun and moon,
and unite the Brahman *qi* of yin and yang.
Spirit, *hun*, *po*, and intent,
gather the Five *Qi* to return to the origin;
the mysterious female of heaven and earth,
roots and knots the One Pearl to form the image.
May they attest to truth in the celestial palace,
and wander and feast in the jade capital.
May their blessings extend to humans and heavens,
and their grace overflow to families and nations.

Now, therefore, we burn incense,
from our reverence to the master, the venerable sagely hosts,
the perfected virtues,
that after attaining the Dao,
they may eternally preserve their longevity,
harmonizing and uniting with the true Dao.

*Chanting the directions*
*Confessing the directions*

We command the demon-quelling rites—thrice invoked, thrice bowed—
and once more proclaiming the sacred ranks,
we, your subjects of such-and-such name, together with the officiating altar assembly,
do reverently and earnestly address the Three Pure Ones of the Three Realms,
the Ten Poles and Ten Flowers of the Most Sagely,
the officials and hosts of the Three Realms,
the responsive and perceptive deities of the Mystic Altar,
and all true numina.

We have heard that the azure vault streams forth its essence,
illuminating the realm of green silk with radiance;
the blue empyrean governs its *qi*,
shining brilliantly upon the azure mists’ domain.
Manifesting the Dharma-body, their number is as grains of sand;
extending the sagely lineage, their luminosity matches sun and moon.
All who offer devotion and submission
must be bathed in the grace of their abiding presence.

Today, in reverent compliance with the imperial edict,
we solemnly perform the jade register rites,
solemnly presenting offerings for such-and-such soul.
The jade tablet ascends with the spirit—
surely the merit of the fast knows no bounds;
the golden talisman conveys the destiny—
truly the wondrous fruit is infinite.

We humbly pray that such-and-soul’s ancestral *qi* may be purified,
and the nature of heaven within them made resplendent.
May they tread the heights of the Flowery Grove,
and ascend in wondrous splendor to the azure vault’s court.

Above, may the Three Luminaries shine in lofty brilliance,
and the Five Spirits harmonize in accord.
May winds and clouds withdraw and gather,
and grasses and trees glow with radiant bloom.
May fish leap and kites soar,
fulfilling their creation at Yu’s border;
may phoenixes display their grace and beasts dance,
fostering transformation and nurture at the court of Yu.
May the three peasantry wander and summer in joyous halls,
and the four frontiers ascend spring terraces in delight.
May the manifest and hidden alike attain blessing,
and the ancestral altars and altars of state flourish in peace.

Thus shall the great transformative power of the Most Luminous Heavenly Worthy be revealed above,
and the sincerity of our devotion and submission be fulfilled below.
We reverently present this petition for your hearing.

*Making vows*
*Visualizing the deities and burning incense*

May the Fragrant Office Envoys, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, and all attendant Fragrant Spirits,
cause the very ground where I, your servant, ascended the altar at the noon audience to perform the Dao,
to spontaneously generate the golden liquid and the cinnabar-green essence of elixirs.
May the hundred numinous perfected ones gather here,
before the incense burner.
May the sincerity of our devotion move and reach them,
elevating and delivering the spirit of [Name].
May they swiftly attain the fruit of divine transcendence,
and universally bestow grace upon family and state.
May the jade maidens and immortal youths of the ten directions,
attending amidst the orchid-scented smoke,
convey the sincerity of my petition,
swiftly delivering it to the presence of the Utmost True and Boundless Great Dao of the Three Clarities and Supreme Saints,
the Jade Emperor of the Golden Portal of the Vast Heaven,
and the Eastern Ultimate Compassionate Worthy, the Azure Mystery Supreme Emperor.

*Exiting the Hall Hymn*
The Rite of the Jade Register for Deliverance at the Noon Audience is now complete.
