**Ritual of the Yellow Talisman Fast: Ascension from the Ten Realms and Three Isles**

*Step in voidness,*
*Next, invoke the Three Celestial Worthy Ones.*

**Declaration and Offering:**
With incense raised in supplication,
We make offerings to the Three Pure Ones of Supreme Holiness,
The Ten Ultimate High Immortals,
The Merciful Supreme One of the Eastern Extremity, Savior of Suffering,
The Ten-Directional Savior of Suffering,
The Nine-Yin Expiator of Guilt,
The Heavenly Worthy of the Red Mound who Transmits Fate,
The Yellow Talisman Officials, the Boundless Sacred Immortals,
The Ten Realms and Three Isles—all their mighty and numinous powers.

By this true incense,
We universally make offerings.

*Humbly praying for divine mercy,*
*That Your enlightened gaze may shine upon us.*

*Humbly reflecting:*
As the two *qi* circulate, they wax and wane;
As the Five Constants are bestowed, they cannot escape rise and fall.
Thus, we know the causes of birth and death
Are but the numbers of coming and going.

If one wishes to prolong life and dwell in the world,
It can only be by shedding mortal traces and ascending as an immortal.

Therefore, beyond the dusty world, the Ten Realms are all domains of eternal life;
Within the seas, the Three Isles are lands where none age.
Golden nectar and jade wine fill the vessels without end;
The hem of the mist and the sleeves of the clouds arise with every thought.

「The verdant lotus roots and frost-kissed peaches bear fruit in the third winter;
Strange flowers and fruits flourish in all four seasons.
The winds and lights are ever spring-like, unceasing;
The sun and moon revolve without night’s end.
When the crimson sky clears its hue,
The Palace of Everlasting Joy opens in time;
When the purple mist glows at dawn,
The Hall of the Celestial Sovereign spreads afar.

Some ride the Yellow Dragon’s litter,
Others mount the Vermilion Phoenix’s carriage.
A crane’s cry—one sound—
Crosses the Immortal Peaks in an instant;
A peng’s leap—nine ten-thousands—
Surpasses the boundless seas in a breath.
All rely on the Void to command the sky,
Able to forsake the world and transcend the mundane.
In ease of dwelling and repose,
No worldly cares or schemes intrude.
The Valley of Brocade shines cold,
Its morning light reflecting the *yùyí*’s [1] lush hue;
The Cinnabar Mist vying in splendor,
Its nightly glow purifying the *jiérán*’s [2] brilliance.

The Jade Maidens bear messages,
The Golden Boys present decrees.
They attend the Feast of the Celestial Jade Pool,
Together ascending to the Golden Gate’s ranks.
Music resounds from the *Jūn Tiān*’s [3] heights,
Shaking the crimson osmanthus of the Broad Cold’s [4] realm;
The cup holds sweet dew,
Its fragrance mingling with the Queen Mother’s *pán táo*’s [5] elixir.

All this stems from mortal traces cast aside,
And a heart content with simplicity’s *dàn bó* [6].
To delight the spirit and nurture the nature,
One must grasp the method of inhaling fresh and exhaling stale;
To refine the essence and cultivate the True,
One must awaken to the logic of transcending the mundane and ascending the divine.

Thus severed from the dusty world,
Their names are inscribed in the immortal ledger.
They roam the Three Mountains,
Wander the Ten Extremes.
Feasting on mist and clad in *qi*,
They preserve their immortal lifespan without end;
Distilling elixirs and burning cinnabar,
They guide the worldly toward the Dao’s path.

If they harbor a resolve to return,
May they receive the grace of deliverance.
I now offer as one who has shed past transgressions,
To uphold the *Chōng Kē*’s [7] sacred range,
And to sustain the Immortal’s standard.

Let me unfold the Ten Realms’ sublime landscapes,
And chant the Three Isles’ arcane winds.
By these singular causes,
I present this offering for unseen blessings.
*Humbly praying for divine mercy,*
*That Your enlightened gaze may shine upon us.*

*Humbly reflecting:*
As the two *qi* circulate, they wax and wane;
As the Five Constants are bestowed, they cannot escape rise and fall.
Thus, we know the causes of birth and death
Are but the numbers of coming and going.

If one wishes to prolong life and dwell in the world,
It can only be by shedding mortal traces and ascending as an immortal.

Therefore, beyond the dusty world, the Ten Realms are all domains of eternal life;
Within the seas, the Three Isles are lands where none age.
Golden nectar and jade wine fill the vessels without end;
The hem of the mist and the sleeves of the clouds arise with every thought.

**First Realm: Yíng Zhōu** [8]
Lofty above the boundless sea,
Facing the *Kuài Jī*’s [9] distant shores.
Its True Palace is the dwelling of the Two Immortals;
The divine herbs there bless all things.
Refining the iron of *Kūn Wú* [10],
It shatters like jade in flight;
Drinking the nectar of *yùlí* [11],
One attains everlasting life.

The Green Mound hides its borders,
The Emerald Waters conceal the immortals.
I present this sacred offering,
To ascend this realm in flight.

*Humbly praying:*
May I soar the Cloud Path,
And reach the boundless freedom of my true nature;
Returning thanks to the dusty world,
And awaken from the illusion of mortal life.
May the faithful devotees take refuge,
And extol the virtues.

Yíng Zhōu’s gates connect to all the heavens,
Its springtime light beyond measure forgets the years.
The Five-hued Phoenix crow of dawn,
The Thousand-gold Phoenix inhales the crimson vapors.
The Green Mound’s waters and mountains differ from the world,
The *Kūn Wú* iron and jade stones are firm and true.
I pray to guide the departed spirits beyond this place,
And let them hear the sutras, awakening to the True Meaning.

---
**Second Realm: Xuán Zhōu** [12]
Situated in the *Xùn Gōng*’s [13] domain,
Within the Northern Sea’s embrace.
Facing the Celestial Gate,
It stands as Earth’s threshold.

The Fragrant Wind Mountains rise in splendor,
Their roots echoing with thunderous harmonies;
The Azure Grass spreads its scent,
Strewing jade blossoms along the path.

It is the capital of the Supreme Mystic,
The true seat of the Immortal Lords.
Its earth yields golden treasure,
Its stones encase white jade,
Its lifespan limitless,
Its robes and food naturally provided.

I present this sacred offering,
To ascend this realm in flight.

*Humbly praying:*
May the immortals swiftly guide me,
And in a breath, reveal the blessed lands of hidden heavens;
May divine visions be clear,
And my essence transformed into the Immortal’s Way and spirit-bone.

May the faithful devotees take refuge,
And extol the wondrous range.

The Mystic Capital dominates the Immortal Domain,
Its grand halls and splendid chambers host the ranks of sages.
The Jade Maidens compose decrees riding crane-litters,
The Golden Boys deliver edicts astride whales.

The Jade Fields produce priceless treasures,
The Sacred Dates flourish in embroidered abundance.
I pray to guide the departed spirits beyond this place,
And let them learn from the dusty world the art of purity and detachment.

---
**Third Realm: Cháng Zhōu** [14]
Its cavernous palace lies concealed within,
Pressing down upon the Southern Sea’s depths.
Sweet nectar flows from its springs,
Called the Elixir of Everlasting Life;
The Green Mound bears another name,
True Land of Supreme Bliss.

Its five-thousand-*lǐ* landscape is unparalleled,
Its three-ten-thousand-year lifespan the longest.
The Purple Jade Pavilions and Towers
Are all abodes of the True Women and Daoists;
The Yellow Silk Talismans and Scriptures
Are all the refined methods of the High Saints.

Above stands the True Capital’s ridge,
Beside lies the Broad Benefit’s palace.

I present this sacred offering,
To ascend this realm in flight.

*Humbly praying:*
May the Cinnabar Mist enshroud me,
And I forever wear the treasured sutras;
At the Red Water’s mountain peak,
May I pay homage to the *Yù Qīng*’s [15] carriage.

May the faithful devotees take refuge,
And extol the wondrous range.

Cháng Zhōu’s scenery is spring in all four seasons,
Phoenix litters and Dragon towers locked in emerald clouds.
Two shores of peaches no mortal reaches,
One field of *zhī cǎo* [16] where cranes gather in flocks.
The Jade Towers empty, the celestial winds grow cold,
The Jade Chessboard’s tides return, the sea sun sets low.
I pray to guide the departed spirits beyond this place,
And let them pay reverence to the Purple Void’s palace, honoring the *Yuán Jūn* [17].

---
**Fourth Realm: Liú Zhōu** [18]
A boundary of three-thousand *lǐ*,
A span of ninety-ten-thousand *chéng* [19].
The Western Sea is clear,
No trace of perilous waves is seen;
The Eastern Wind stirs,
And the scent of purple wood is heard at times.

The Immortals’ processions pass without need of boats,
The divine *líng xiāo* [20]’s melody flows without end.
Before the Moonlit Stair,
One watches the Green Swans dance;
On the Flying Mist Mountain,
One rides the White Crane at will.

I present this sacred offering,
To ascend this realm in flight.

*Humbly praying:*
May a single pill of elixir
Be brought from the *Gōu Lòu*’s [21] depths;
May twin breezes of purity
Follow the Jade River back to me.
May the faithful devotees take refuge,
And extol the wondrous range.

On Liú Zhōu’s mountain, the Flying Mist resounds,
Where a hundred thousand immortal guests and poets dwell.
The Auspicious Herbs and *líng zhī* [22] are ten-thousand-year elixirs,
The Green Lilies and *xiān ní* [23] bloom in four seasons’ splendor.
The Cloud-and-Mist curtains leave only the celestial sandals behind,
At the Ox-and-Fight constellation’s riverside, no ferryman is needed.»

「I humbly present sacred offerings to transcend that realm,
Where peach trees grow and sesame meals return me home.

In the fifth *Yuánzhōu* [24] of divine abode,
Beyond the *Cāngmíng* [25] seas to the north,
The immortal gardens lie at its heart.
There stands the lofty Jade Pavilion,
Where feasts are held in the *Zǐxū* [26] halls.

The sweet spring of *Xuànyàn* [27] is like honey,
Drink it and one may dwell in this world for long years.
The wondrous herbs of *Língfēng* [28] are nameless,
Wear them and one’s form shall be reborn, free from earthly bonds.

The cave gates never lock,
And immortal guests have leisure aplenty.
After reading the *Huángtíng* [29] scriptures,
One sees only clouds rising from the foundations.
In awe of the *Qīngmèng* [30] visions,
One knows not how the seas have turned to mulberry fields.

The celestial *Qiànyà* [31] bells and drums resound,
While mortal boats and carriages never reach.
Time and light grow not old,
Life’s measure is boundless—
I present sacred offerings to transcend this realm.
*Humbly praying:*
May my mortal frame be shed like a cicada’s husk,
And leave the empty blossoms of the world behind.
May I master the *Sāndòng* [32] scriptures,
And attain the secrets of the true immortals.
The faithful take refuge,
And extol the wondrous range.

The fifth *Yuánzhōu* [24] is a blessed realm where immortals dwell,
With crimson hues and vermilion radiance piercing the void.
The sweet spring of *Xuànyàn* flows over jade pavements,
While the *Zǐxū* halls are sealed with indigo bolts.
A hundred-year jade crane returns to the Azure Banner,
And a five-colored celestial dragon draws from the Fire Bell.
I pray to transcend with sacred offerings,
And in haste ascend the Five-Clouded towers.

In the sixth *Shēngzhōu* [33] of rebirth,
The land floats upon the Eastern Sea,
And mountains touch *Pénglái* [34].
Immortal guests and poets mingle in the emerald mists,
While peerless landscapes loop in sapphire barriers.
Green swans take flight, crimson phoenixes gather,
True immortals come and go above the heavens.
Tigers roar, dragons chant,
Guarding the sacred traces in the mountains.
Flowers bloom in supreme splendor,
Trees merge with the *Qiān* [35] forests.
Cave doors are long barred,
Yet one often hears the chime of jade bells.
Celestial platforms rise high,
Where the sound of jade gongs is ever-present.
When pure winds stir, the music shakes the cloudy *Léi* [36],
And as the bright moon ascends, the sea mirrors half its disk.
Seasonal wonders abound,
And one may leisurely wander for a thousand years.
I present offerings to the departed,
To transcend this realm.
*Humbly praying:*
May I step forth into the pavilions of the *Xūhuáng* [37],
And burn the finest incense.
May I ascend the halls of *Fǎyuè* [38],
And pay homage to the Three Treasures.
The faithful take refuge,
And extol the virtues.

The sovereign of *Shēngzhōu* is the *Tàiqīng* Lord,
Who holds the mysteries of the Dao and works its transformations.
He plucks and drinks from heaven’s bounty,
And his splendor does not match the mortal world.
With the Three Flowers, he attains the *Cháoyuán* [39] path,
And needs no worldly medicine to cure his ailments.
I pray to ascend with sacred offerings,
And swiftly grasp the *Shùnjīng* [40] steps of the void.

In the seventh *Zǔzhōu* [41] of ancestral land,
A realm of ten thousand *lí* [42] in expanse,
Where clouds enfold a thousand homes.
The *zhī* [43] is called "Nurturing Spirit",
Breathing the jade-like *ruìqì* [44] of the blessed fields.
The medicine is named "Immortal,"—
Reviving the world’s withered bones.
None are sick who do not recover,
And all who have merit shall meet it.
Test the divine herbs,
And surely the years of *Guǐgǔ* [45] shall be matched.
Seek the blessed child,
And none shall surpass the *Jūnfáng* [46] carriage.
The sacred seedlings rise but a few *cùn* [47],
Yet resemble the immortal gourd.
Divine waters, but a sip,
Nourish strange and wondrous growths.
Their fame surpasses the ten mountains,
Their brilliance excels the four seas.
I present sacred offerings to transcend this realm.
*Humbly praying:*
May I dance in feathered robes,
And in a breath fly past the immortal mountains.
May I wander through the *Dòngzhāng* [48] scriptures,
And ten thousand times fulfill the Dao of immortality.
The faithful take refuge,
And extol the virtues.

The ancestral *Zǔzhōu* [41] surpasses mortal scenes,
With green waters and blue mountains encircling all.
Its dwellings rise and float upon the vast sea,
And one returns to gather *zhī* [43] amid the idle clouds.
When hungry, one feasts on *Huángbì* [49] elixirs in golden cauldrons,
When thirsty, one drinks from jade roots through crystal gates.
I pray to transcend with sacred offerings,
And freely roam the *Fānghú* [50] and *Yuánjiǎo* [51] peaks.

In the eighth *Yánzhōu* [52] of flames,
The *qì* [53] divides at the Southern Pole,
And the land is anchored by the *Lígōng* [54] palace.
True fire blazes, stretching ten thousand *zhàng* [55] through the heavens.
Great waves surge, rising a thousand *xún* [56] high.
Refining the *yīnbò* [57] to ascend,
Riding the *yángguāng* [58] to attain liberation.
The *Mòshēng* [59] cloth is named for fire-washing,
Cleansing the dust of life within the fierce flames.
The *Fēngshēng* [60] beasts are so called,
For they regrow their feathers beneath the piled firewood.
Great *Dānyào* [61] flows like fire,
And the palaces of the *Guānyà* [62] are solemn and grand.
The High Saints and True Worthies,
Their majesty and splendor dazzle all.
All are abodes of gods and immortals,
And they communicate with the Central Lands.
I present sacred offerings to transcend this realm.
*Humbly praying:*
May my jade eyes be refined in essence,
And receive the true seal of life’s decree.
May I master the *Jīnyè* [63] alchemy,
And attain the immortal arts of returning the soul.
The faithful take refuge,
And extol the virtues.

The *Yánzhōu* [52] alone connects with mortal realms,
Where a thousand-*lǐ* [64] voyage leads into the Han palaces.
Steam and flames stretch through the heavens, scaring birds to flight,
And surging waves encircle the shores, where giant turtles reign.
The upper realm of *Nánchāng* [65] opens to the flowing fire,
And the *Dōngjǐng* [66] pools meet the *Tàikōng* [67].
I pray to transcend with sacred offerings,
And may my withered bones once more return to the form of a child.

In the ninth *Fènglínzhōu* [68] of phoenix and unicorn,
There lies the *Dānlín* [69] hall of the elixir forests,
And above, the *Qīnghuá* [70] palace connects.
Below, it is separated by the *Míng* [71] waves,
Yet distantly communicates with the celestial realms.
Here, the unicorn is born,
And phoenixes fly in pairs.
From here comes the incense of "Returning Souls, Cleansing Filth,"
And the treasure of "Refining Gold, Extending Threads."
Immortal sages tend the cauldron,
And the medicinal vapors form the elixir.
The *Ruòshuǐ* [72] surrounds the isle,
And no bird’s feathers may float upon it.
Those who arrive here are High Saints and True Immortals,
And those who govern are Celestial Lords and True Worthies.
I present sacred offerings to ascend this realm.
*Humbly praying:*
May I worship the solemn *Yùyí* [73] scenes,
And perceive the penetrating golden light.
May I rush to the *Jiélìng* [74] halls,
And gaze upon the jade-like countenance.
The faithful take refuge,
And extol the wondrous range.

The immortal *Fènglínzhōu* [68] rises high,
Where weak waters cannot bear a feather’s weight.
The incense of transcendence returns the soul for thousands of *lǐ*,
And the *Jiāqiān* [75] unicorn’s horn refines for countless autumns.
When clouds part, the *Cíyǐ* [76] pavilion is dyed with elixir,
And as the sun ascends, the *Qiān* [35] forests flow with emerald brilliance.
I pray to transcend with sacred offerings,
And freely roam the *Fānghú* [50] and *Yuánjiǎo* [51] peaks.

In the tenth *Jùkūzhōu* [77] of gathered caves,
Mountains form the immortal grottoes,
And palaces are named *Dòngxuán* [78].
Sacred roots preserve the seeds of death,
And jade cauldrons refine the golden essence.
To hear of them is to rise from withered bones,
To drink of them is to ascend as an immortal.
The customs here are pure and true,
And the people’s ways are simple and unadorned.
Within the *Húzhōng* [79] are sun and moon,
And this realm knows no seasons—」

「Within the hollowed realm, heaven and earth abide,
Yet here are sovereigns and ministers, fathers and sons.
Without craving or longing, neither departure nor return.
With sacred offerings, I pray to transcend this place.

I humbly wish that with a finger-snap, ten thousand *lǐ* of immortal mountains appear,
Without need of the long reeds—
To lift my head and see the ninefold celestial gates,
What hindrance is there to my flying sandals?

The assembly of the Law takes refuge,
And extols the virtues of the sacred.

The tenth *Jùkūzhōu* of gathered caves,
Where mountains form the immortal grottoes,
And palaces bear the name *Dòngxuán*.
Sacred roots preserve the seeds of death,
And jade cauldrons refine the golden essence.
To hear of them is to rise from withered bones,
To drink of them is to ascend as an immortal.
The customs here are pure and true,
And the people’s ways are simple and unadorned.
Within the *Húzhōu* are sun and moon,
And this realm knows no seasons—
Here, heaven and earth are enclosed,
Yet sovereigns and subjects, fathers and children, exist.
No greed nor desire, neither going nor coming.
With sacred offerings, I pray to transcend this place.

I humbly wish that when flowers bloom and winds stilled,
My body be as light as a single leaf—
And as fragrant clouds part, my feet tread upon the five auspicious clouds.
The assembly of the Law takes refuge,
And extols the virtues of the sacred.

The first *Kūnlún* island,
Circled by weak waters, named *Kūnlún* alone.
Gazing southeast, it meets the *Shípǔ* realm of immortal roaming;
Looking northwest, it stands as the northern gate of *Dòngtiān*.
The well draws from the great *Dàhuó* fountain,
And the path leads into the southern valley of the city.

Here, the true immortals gather,
And the assembled saints come to visit.
The *Jīshí* mountains stretch westward,
Revealing the *Xīmǔ* tortoise platform’s location;
The *Yǎnpén* cliffs rise steeply,
Unlocking the *Mùwáng*’s path to immortality.

The *Huāzūn* grove bears its name,
And its peak is called *Làngfēng*.
The *Tiānyōng* city towers high,
With heaped gold weighing ten thousand *yì* [80];
The *Fànqì* [81] pavilion stands tall,
Reflecting the ninefold *Gāo* jade’s brilliance.

The twelve *liújīng* [82] crystal gates,
Day and night forever sealed;
The eight thousand long-life peaches,
Bloom eternally without fading.

Above, it connects to the *Xuánxī* [83] celestial bureau,
Below, it overlooks the *Shùhài* [84] mortal domain.
Here, the five elements flow harmoniously,
And the six *qì* are balanced in measure.
Truly a blessed hall’s domain,
A land of eternal joy indeed.

With sacred offerings, I pray to transcend this place.
I humbly wish that when flowers bloom and winds stilled,
My body be as light as a single leaf—
And as fragrant clouds part, my feet tread upon the five auspicious clouds.
The assembly of the Law takes refuge,
And extols the virtues of the sacred.

The *Kūnlún*’s piled stones touch the southeast,
The *Huāzūn* grove and *Tiānyōng* city rise in emerald mists.
Though separated from *Xiányáng* by earth,
The palace links to the Queen Mother’s realm, waters embracing all.
To the north, the great *Dàhuó* well flows with elixir,
To the west, the golden city gazes upon the *Ànbì* [85] jade pool.
With sacred offerings, I pray to transcend this place,
And listen to the Dao’s mysteries upon the *Làngfēng* platform.

The second *Fāngzhàng* island,
Its peaks like piled jade, piercing the layered heavens.
Flowers like liquid gold, clustering beside towering ridges.
Here, the palaces gather gold, jade, and *lúlí* [86],
Their light rivaling stars and constellations;
And the halls of *jiāoqíng* [87] and *lóngshèn* [88] dragons,
Their depths swallowed by the boundless sea.

This is the third heaven’s abode of the *Sīmìng* [89] sovereign,
And the true dwelling of the *Jiǔyuán Zhàngrén* [90].
He governs the gods of all earthly waters,
And examines the scrolls of mortals seeking the Dao.

Golden nectar and jade marrow,
Drink them, and hunger is forgotten for ten thousand *jié* [91];
Auspicious grasses and *língzhī* [92] mushrooms,
Wear them, and no dust clings at all.

The stone springs flow with moisture,
Unceasing for a thousand years;
The mulberries and *shānzhēn* [93] berries thrive,
Evergreen for ten thousand autumns.
When the immortal children ascend to the heavens,
They visit the high sages’ platform of scriptures.

The *Fù* [94] is granted to the *Xuányuán* [95],
And the name is known to the *Tàishàng* [96].
Their ranks are honored and exalted,
Their stations pure and lofty.
With sacred offerings, I pray to transcend this place.

I humbly wish that the assembly of the immortals upholds me,
To ascend the golden gate and enter the jade hall—
With a single thought, I soar beyond,
Carrying the *Tàishān* [97] and crossing the *Běihǎi* [98].
The assembly of the Law takes refuge,
And extols the virtues of the sacred.

The *Fāngzhàng* island in the sea gathers the gods,
Its earthly form towering and distinct from the heavens.
Golden phoenixes abound in their brooding nests,
And who guides the jade ointment to nourish the *zhītián* [99]?
The towers and halls shine with the *Sānqīng* [100] path’s light,
And the flowers and trees float in five-colored mist.
With sacred offerings, I pray to transcend this place,
No need to turn back and mourn the dusty ties.

The third *Péngqiū* island,
Circumscribed by five thousand *lǐ* and more,
Ascending to the thirty-two heavens.

To the north, it stands apart from the *Zhōngshān* [101],
And in the center, it connects to the vast seas.
Beyond the *Nèi’ā* [102] gate,
Lies the ninth heaven’s palace of the sovereign lord;
Within the *Míngbó* [103] waves,
Rises the three-island realm of cloudy verdure.

Flying immortals come and go,
Auspicious mists drifting and veiling.
Jingling ornaments and jade pendants,
Arrayed in the celestial court’s order;
Faint *shēngxiāo* [104] and *zhèngxiāo* [105] music,
Playing the songs of the *Diàolè* [106] fishing festival.

Children from the eight seas scatter flowers,
And attendants of the five clouds hold parasols in reverence.
The *Qióngbiē* [107] tortoise and *Yīyī* [108] monster,
Carry stones to form the mountains;
The immortal phoenix lingers and hesitates,
Beak-laden with blossoms for offerings.

The sound of *Bùxū* [109] steps resounds,
And the rainbow clouds gather at the *Yáofēng* [110] peak;
The *Fànjīng* [111] bell’s tones descend,
And the crimson banners return to the *Zǐfǔ* [112] palace.

One year in the mountain,
Is a hundred years in the mortal world.
Feasting on *rú* [113] and *cāngjīng* [114],
No need for the arts of abstaining from food;
Dwelling in spirit and severing desires,
Why cling to the hand-holding of the mundane?

No suffering from cold or heat,
No entanglement in wealth or fame.
Free and unbounded, joy without end.

With sacred offerings, I pray to transcend this place.
I humbly wish that when the *juéhuā* [115] blooms, I awaken,
The winds of the ten islands ever spring;
And when yesterday’s dream fades,
The mists of the three islands linger yet.

The assembly of the Law is devout,
And extols the virtues of the sacred.

*Pénglái* [116] divides the fates and calms the surging waves,
The great emperor’s consort and the assembled saints.
Five-colored snows float upon the jade *liào* [117],
And ninefold *Qīng* [118] stars and moons shine from the golden *áoxiāo* [119].
The *Yáotái* [120] platform’s shadow dips into the cold celestial heart,
And the jade gates’ light ascends above the high sea.

With sacred offerings, I pray to transcend this place,
And personally accompany the Queen Mother in feasting upon the *Pántáo* [121].

For though blessed lands and *Dòngtiān* [122] realms
Lie not beyond the dusty world,
And though the gods and saints attain enlightenment,
They yet reside within the mundane.
Those who cultivate feel the response naturally,
While those who neglect are bound by emotional ties.
Only the high sages’ compassion,
Reveals the purity of the immortal realm.
Thus, mortals abandon toil and return to the Great Dao,
Fortunate to meet this assembly, guided by the sacred rites.

Now, I rely upon the benevolent power,
To be led to the true path.
Forever free from the mortal cage,
I soar beyond the celestial realm.
The assembly of the Law takes refuge,
And extols the virtues of the sacred.

Alas, the mortal world is but a fleeting horse,
And the bonds of wealth and fame confine us like locks and reins.
We fail to grasp that all existence is contingent,
Yet take our labors and sorrows as joy and delight.
What use are honor and riches now?
Affection and kinship—what are they but empty?
