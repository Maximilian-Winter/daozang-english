**Golden Talisman Repentance Rite**
**Collected by Master Guangcheng Du Guangting**

**General Repentance Rite**

Humbly heard, the Primordial Origin unfolded the Diagram, pacifying the Five Directions and establishing their foundations;
The True Scripture manifested transformations, dividing the Ten Extremes to condense the radiance.
Encompassing all phenomena within divine mechanism, returning all merits to the Mysterious Existence.
Guarding the realm’s security, nurturing the august virtue of the Emperor.
Extending the Precious Treasure without end, disseminating boundless blessings within the finite.
Now, with reverence, the Emperor, merging with the Dao’s domain, contemplates the Mysterious Shore.
Aspiring to initiate the Great Sacrifice, bestowing ten thousand meanings below.
With solemn offerings of golden dragons and jade discs, oil lamps, incense, and flowers, silk banners inscribed with sacred symbols—
I beseech the unveiling of the Mysterious Essence, the exposition of the True Scripture,
and pay homage to the Ten Extremes’ Supreme Lord of the Celestial Treasure, the Ten Extremes’ Celestial Sovereigns,
and all celestial, terrestrial, luminous, and mountainous deities, as well as the spirits of all sacred officials.

Humbly hoping that the august spirits of the ancestral altars may be honored,
that the ancestral lineage’s prosperity be illuminated,
that the wandering spirits ascend to the Supreme Pole,
and that the tranquil scene of the Upper Clarity be perpetuated.
To befriend the Eight Sovereigns at the Vermilion Mound,
and to welcome the Five Emperors at the Crimson Palace.
May fragrant blessings spread like ten thousand leaves,
and graces flow like the Nine Enclosures.

The Emperor, inheriting the saintly deeds of his forebears,
with brilliance continuing the glorious lineage of virtue.
May the world endure in eternal peace,
and the cultural path achieve Great Harmony.
In harmony with the jade lamps of the Four Seasons,
and in accordance with the pearl pouches of the Five Stars.
May the common folk thrive in joy,
and the hundred grains flourish abundantly.
May the winds of the Dao prevail eternally,
and the transformations of Non-Action be fully realized.
After attaining the Dao, ascending to the Formless,
and merging with the True Essence.
