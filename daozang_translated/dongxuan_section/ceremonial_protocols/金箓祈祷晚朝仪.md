**Evening Ceremony for Invoking Longevity with the Golden Arrow**
*Ritual Procedures as Prescribed*
To the Master of Rites, observe the prescribed rituals with reverence.

*Invoke the Divine Spell*
The Supreme Dao/Way of the Five *Qi* (元始三炁) lingers in the Uppermost Mysteries (北上太玄).
Fivefold Radiance (宝华) shines in layers, its brilliance effulgent.
Sacred Vision (灵景) flourishes in splendor, its light permeating the Great Constellation (太微).
Gazing upward, I honor my own body—its inner sanctum now revealed.
Peace descends upon my dwelling, all spirits converge in unity.
My form ascends in feathered robes, rising like a celestial flight.
In harmony with the Dao/Way, I attain the True.

*Strike the Ritual Drum Twenty-Four Times*
From the Three Supreme Heavens (三天), the Primordial *Qi* (玄元) of the Highest Venerable Lord Lao (太上老君),
I summon my threefold *Wu* (五) essence and Thirty-Six Officials of the Celestial Bureau (功曹),
Left and Right Attendants, Bearers of Incense, Dragon-Cavalry Messengers (龙骑吏),
Incense-Bearing Golden Boys (金童), Flower-Dispersing Jade Girls (玉女),
and the Twelve Imperial Officials (十二香官) under the Five Emperors’ Direct Mandate (五帝直符直日),
each numbering thirty-six.

*Those who appear* must be adorned in splendid attire, their crowns and sashes trailing gracefully.
Open the Cavernous Mysteries (玄坛) and summon the Land Deities (土地), the Territorial Spirits (方域神真).
I now perform the evening ritual, ascending the platform to walk the Dao/Way,
and pay homage to the Supreme Deities.

With utmost sincerity and reverence, I present my offerings.
May the Supreme Deities’ sacred *Qi* (炁) and luminous blessings descend,
flowing into my body, so that my earnest prayers
may swiftly reach the Supreme Dao/Way of the Boundless True (至真无极大道),
the Three Pure Ones (三清), the Most Exalted Saints (上圣),
and the Highest Venerable Lord Lao (昊天至尊金阙玉皇上帝御前).

*Invoke the Ritual Title*
In full assembly, I, a humble subject of the surname [blank],
along with the officials gathered at the platform,
reverently unite in offering this prayer to the Supreme Dao/Way of Natural Truth (虚无自然至真无极大道),
the Most Venerable Celestial Lord of the Great Primordial (玉清圣境大罗元始天尊),
the Supreme Dao/Way Lord (太上道君), the Supreme Venerable Lord Lao (太上老君),
the Highest Venerable Lord Lao (昊天至尊玉皇上帝),
the Sovereign Emperor of the Purple Micro (紫微上官天皇大帝),
the Central Palace Emperor of the Northern Pole (紫微中宫北极大帝),
the Earthly Sovereign Empress (后土皇地祇),
the Most Venerable Lord of the Mysterious Primordial (玄都万寿天尊),
the Most Venerable Lord of the Great Peace (太平护国天尊),
the Most Venerable Lord of Boundless Blessings (福生无量天尊),
and the Sevenfold Treasure Layered Platform of the Mysterious Primordial (玄都玉京七宝层台),
the Celestial Lords of the Purple Micro’s Supreme Sanctity (紫微上宫灵宝至真诸君丈人),
the myriad sacred spirits of the Golden Arrow (金阙弥罗众圣),
the Highest Grand Minister (上相), the Highest Grand Overseer (上宰),
the Highest Protector (上保), the Highest Counselor (上傅),
the Minor Protector (少保), the Minor Counselor (少傅),
the Four Teachers and Five Emperors (四师五帝),
the Twelve Celestial Consorts (十二仙卿),
the Thirty-Six Divisions of Sacred Scriptures (三十六部尊经),
the Great Master of the Mysterious Dao (玄中大法师),
the Great Master of the Three Heavens (三天大法师),
the officials of the Sun, Moon, Stars, and Constellations (斗府),
the Hosts of the Complete Heaven (周天宿度),
the Star Spirits of the Milky Way (河汉星真),
the Southern Pole Sage (南极老人),
the True Lords of Fortune, Longevity, and Luck (福禄寿星真君),
the Sovereign’s Native Star (皇帝本命星君),
the Illuminating True Sovereign of the Imperial Seat (帝座照临真宰),
and all responsive spirits within the Three Realms (三界内外应感一切真灵).

I have heard that the Nameless, Formless (无名无象)
conceals itself within the singular *Qi* (潜凝一炁);
the Numerated, Manifest (有数有生)
operates silently within the myriad transformations (默运万殊).
The Mysterious Vision reveals itself in the azure void (玄景昭明於空碧),
while the True Wind dances across the celestial expanse (真风流演於寰区).
The Dao’s subtleties are beyond comprehension,
permeating the Three Talents (三才) and nurturing all.
Its efficacy surpasses all measure,
encompassing the Four Cardinal Directions (四极) and giving birth to the cosmos.

My humble nature is coarse and unrefined,
my gifts but those of a mortal.
I bathe in flowing streams and rest upon firm stones,
striving to uphold my simple, steadfast resolve.
I savor the Dao’s profound mysteries,
ever maintaining my sincere devotion in silent contemplation.

On this sacred day, I presume to lead the fasts and rituals.
I kneel at the jade steps, humbly declaring the sacred texts.
The Book of Great Primordial (洪范) proclaims longevity as the foremost of the Five Blessings (五福);
the Ode of Hua Seal (华封) echoes with the sincerity of the Three Invocations (三祝).

*Qi*, essence, and spirit form the foundation of life—
the Great Origin (体元之大本).
Fortune, prosperity, and longevity gather beneath the sacred radiance (福禄寿集景祚於圣躬).
Your station is exalted at the Celestial Pole (帝极之尊),
your virtue/power (德) aligns with the Primordial Heaven (乾元之首).

You transform the sun’s light in the Sea of Law (法海),
and spread benevolent winds in the Celestial Realm (仙都).
With reverent solemnity, I perform the ritual rites,
bowing deeply in utmost sincerity.

Now, in this evening ceremony,
ascending the platform to walk the Dao/Way,
I request the ritual assembly to light the first incense.
May this incense smoke ascend to the heavens,
directly offering reverence to the Supreme Dao/Way’s luminous treasure (至真无上道宝),
the Great Primordial Celestial Lord (大罗元始天尊),
and the Highest Venerable Lord Lao (昊天至尊玉皇上帝),
along with all the Most Exalted Saints (无上大罗至真众圣).

I, along with my kin, body, and spirit,
prostrate myself with head to the ground,
and rely upon the Three Supreme Lords (太上三尊) and the Ten Directions’ Saints (十方众圣).
May the merit of this incense ascend to bless the Emperor.
I humbly pray that his virtue/power surpass all kings (百王),
his achievements rival the ages (千古).
His benevolence extends to the world (寰宇),
and the Eight Directions (八纮) rejoice in the spring’s harmony (阳春).
His longevity equals the vault of heaven (穹苍),
and the Ten Thousand Years of glory endure in China (华夏).
The *chuan* tree’s lifespan flourishes daily,
while the nation’s destiny stretches eternally to the heavens.

Now, as I burn this incense,
I vow to rely upon the Teacher, the Supreme Saints (大圣众),
and the True Virtue/power (至真之德).
After attaining the Dao, I shall preserve eternal existence,
and in harmony with the Dao, I achieve the True.

*Colored mist drifts through the sky,*
*incense clouds congeal in azure.*
*My earnest devotion in the morning,*
*my vigilant sincerity at dusk.*

Now, in this evening ceremony,
ascending the platform to walk the Dao/Way,
I request the ritual assembly to light the second incense.
May this incense smoke ascend to the heavens,
directly offering reverence to the Supreme Dao/Way’s sacred scripture (至真无上经宝),
the Celestial Lord of the Jade Pivot (玉宸灵宝天尊),
the Purple Micro Emperor (紫微天皇大帝),
and the True Saints of the Nine Remnants Heaven (禹余天宫真仙圣众).

I, along with my kin, body, and spirit,
prostrate myself with head to the ground,
and rely upon the Three Supreme Lords (太上三尊) and the Ten Directions’ Saints (十方众圣).
May the merit of this incense ascend to bless the Emperor.
I humbly pray that the sun and moon shine together,
and Heaven and Earth unite in virtue/power (乾坤合德).
His *qi* harmonizes with the celestial music (律吕),
aligning the Seven Celestial Officials (七政) with their revolutions (璇玑).
May he grasp the balance of authority,
and bring peace to the Four Seasons (四时) like the jade candle (玉烛).
The nation thrives in concord,
all beings share in his grace.
Years bring abundant harvests,
and the world embraces peace.
The people rejoice in blessings,
and the Ten Thousand Years of longevity are secure.

Now, as I burn this incense,
I vow to rely upon the Teacher, the Supreme Saints (大圣众),
and the True Virtue/power (至真之德).
After attaining the Dao, I shall preserve eternal existence,
and in harmony with the Dao, I achieve the True.

*The celestial cords display their benevolence,*
*the divine presence is as if nearby.*
*I scatter incense winds upon the platform,*
*and suspend blessings in the starry paths.*

With this evening’s courtly assembly upon the sacred platform,
we invoke the Dharma assembly and offer these three strands of incense aloft.
May this fragrant smoke ascend the void,
directly paying homage to the Supreme Teacher, the Five Spirits of the Primordial Sage—
the **Wuxing Xuanlao Tianzun**,
the **Ziwu Beiji Emperor**,
the **Hou Tu Huangdi Zhi**,
and the **Great Red Heaven Palace’s boundless saints**.

We surrender body, spirit, and fate,
prostrate before the Three Sovereigns and the Ten Directions’ holy assembly.
May this incense’s merit ascend to bless the Emperor’s Majesty,
that his **literary virtue** flourish and his **benevolent winds** spread far.
Like the **Song of Virtue** of Shun’s age,
may his reign establish a foundation eternal for ten thousand generations;
like the **auspicious longevity** of the **Zhuang and Chen**,
may his years tower to eight thousand.
Divine and mortal in harmony, the ancestral temple stands secure.

Now, as we burn this incense,
we again take refuge in the Teacher, the Great Saints, and the **True Virtue/power**.
After attaining the Dao, we shall preserve celestial existence,
and in harmony with the Dao, achieve the **True**.

The rites of **Gefang** are complete,
the **repentance** is offered,
the **step upon the void** is taken—
three salutations, three obeisances.

The **Twelve Vows**—with reverent sincerity, I burn incense to the **True Spirit**:

---
**Reverently proclaiming the sacred rank of the Law,**
the lowly subject of the **Gefang** lineage, [name omitted], with utmost sincerity and devotion, humbly addresses:
The **Three Realms’ Sovereigns of the Three Realms**,
the **Ten Directions’ Supreme Saints of the Ten Directions**,
the **Golden Gate Jade Capital’s Celestial Emperor and Celestial True One**,
the **Sun, Moon, and Stars’ Host of Celestial Worthies**,
the **Ten Directions’ Venerable Teachers and Holy Assemblies**,
and all **officials and true spirits of the Three Realms**.

I have heard:
The **Dao’s** majesty, **virtue’s** nobility—
subtle and profound, merging with the **Wordless**;
vast and transforming, holy and divine—
echoing in response, secretly resonating with the **Sentient**.

The **Nine Heavens** are dense yet near, the **Three Sun-approaches** devoutly supplicate.
**Void within, boundless above**—
I reverently receive the **Celestial Command** and solemnly pray for rectification.
Bowing my head to the **Mysterious Vault**, all things unite under the **Sacred Age**;
pouring my sincerity to the **Purple Extremity**, all stars shine in **Auspicious Constellations**.
The **Gale’s** favor descends to **inspect and observe**,
the **Celestial Procession** stands stern in **protection**.

The **Void Song** resounds, the **Dharma-qi** flows crystalline.
The **Sacred Seal** ascends in smoke, bearing the **banners and flags** above the **Empty Dao**;
the **Silver Lamp** gleams in hues, adorning the **cloud-patterned robes** within.
The **rites** are solemn in **courtly decorum**, the **affairs** strictly follow the **secret codes**.

In deep reflection, we subjects rely upon the **Radiant Throne’s Light**,
sheltered beneath the **Imperial Vault’s Grace**.
Listing our petitions, we dare to **audition the Exalted Listener**;
ascending the **fast** and practicing the **Way**, how could we lack **transgressions**?
We humbly rely upon **forgiveness**, universally bestowed with **mercy**.

May the **perfect fruit of blessings** be fulfilled,
to **celebrate the Great Auspiciousness**.
Thus, above, we honor the **Celestial Sovereign’s Great Compassionate Transformation**,
below, we fulfill our subjects’ **sincere refuge in the Command**.

**With reverence, this is reported.**

---
**The Twelve Vows—Preserve the Spirit and Burn Incense.**

The **Fragrant Officials**, **Dragon and Tiger Lords** of left and right,
and the **Attendant Spirits of Incense**—
let them now command that the place where I formerly ascended the **Evening Court Platform** to practice the **Way**,
spontaneously generate the **golden elixir** and **emerald-green lotus** essence.

When the **Hundred Spirits and True Ones** gather here before the **incense burner**,
may I vow that the **Divine Vision** shines forth in response,
and that my **sincere heart** ascends to move the **Heavenly Judgment**.

Let the **Ten-Directional Celestial Youths** and **Jade Maidens** attend in attendance,
conveying my former petitions through the **orchid-scented mist**,
swiftly reaching the **Most High Supreme Dao of the Non-Extreme Supreme Truth**—
the **Three Pure Ones**, the **Most Exalted Heavenly Sovereign**, the **Golden Gate Jade Emperor**, the **Divine Sovereign of the Supreme Court**.

**Exiting the Hall in Praise**—
**Returning Merit**,
**Golden Talisman for Longevity**,
**Evening Court Rites concluded**.
