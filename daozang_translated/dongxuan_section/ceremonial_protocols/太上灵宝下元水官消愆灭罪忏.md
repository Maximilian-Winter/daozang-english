# 太上灵宝下元水官消愆灭罪忏

At that time, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy expounded the Dharma teachings in the Hall of Golden Numinosity within the Grotto of Yin. There was a Perfected One named Bright Net who stepped forth from the assembly and addressed the Primordial Heavenly Worthy: "By virtue of past karmic blessings, I have been privileged to attend upon Your August Presence. Yet the great and minor calamities of the Nine Sixes remain unenlightened by Your teaching—dare I rely upon Your proclamation?"

The Heavenly Worthy declared: "As the four seasons pass and the Yin-Yang harmonies move, all is entrusted to the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water. All seas and rivers, streams and springs, pools and lakes, marshes and caverns, flowing fountains, aquatic beings such as fish and dragons, soft-shelled turtles and terrapins—all creatures dwelling in moisture—along with the abundance or scarcity of years, the fortune or misfortune of the people, are entirely committed to the scrutiny of the Water Official of the Lower Prime. In the first year of the High Antiquity, together with the Five Elder Thearchs, the Perfected Ones of the Yin and Yang Palaces, the Five Planets and Seven Primes, the Twenty-Eight Constellations, and the Earth Spirits of the Nine Provinces, I apportioned the astrological divisions within the Three Heavens, distinguishing good and evil. The Eight Trigrams and Nine Palaces all possess flowing springs. Now, beholding this world, auspicious omens rarely descend, the people suffer much displacement, astrological regions endure floods and droughts, weapons clash in warfare, and the Five Grains fail to ripen—all due to the accumulated evils of the foolish masses."

Thereupon, the Heavenly Worthy emitted a radiant majesty that universally illuminated the lands of the ten directions. He summoned the divine immortals and sagely hosts of all heavens, the numinous spirits of mountains, rivers, deep pools, and grottoes, the Dragon Kings of the Four Seas. Clouds surged, rain poured, thunder and lightning resounded, and sweet rains descended. Thus, this entire realm was revived, and the destitute people were all delivered from sorrow and suffering. At that time, both Daoists and laymen, men and women, were filled with joy, gratefully bearing the vast grace, offering reverent thanks beyond measure, and praising without end.

The Heavenly Worthy further addressed the Water Official of the Lower Prime and the Perfected Ones of the Water Palaces: "All sentient beings, in the causes and conditions of life and death, know no respite. From the time parents conceive and nurture with milk, gradually raising them to maturity, they become capable of discernment—yet remain mired in love and desire. The roots of transgression run deep, and retribution for sins and blessings follows. Thought after thought gives rise to wrongdoing; dust-like kalpas form habitual patterns. Long lodged within the body, from kalpa to kalpa, they cannot escape. Without encountering sages and worthies, liberation is difficult. Long stained by the Six Passions and the Three Poisons—greed, hatred, and delusion—envy and jealousy of the worthy arise. May all transgressions be dissolved. It is essential to sincerely submit, wholeheartedly return to the Great Dao, and invoke the One Hundred Twenty Heavenly Worthies of the Lower Prime to wash away all karmic offenses within the body. Without a master to expound the scriptures, there is no means to awaken. If today, the Venerable Master reveals this scriptural Dharma to deliver us from transgressions and release us from deep entanglements, it is by the Master’s grace that we enter the true Dao. Universally exhort all beings to swiftly turn toward enlightenment. Let each person reverently and wholeheartedly pay homage:

From this day forth, with utmost sincerity, I return my spirit, return my body, and return my life to the Most High and Boundless Dao, to the One Hundred and Twenty Heavenly Worthies of the Lower Prime Who Respond to Conditions, and to the Boundless Sagely Hosts.

I deeply reflect that from beginningless time until this day, I fear I have accumulated transgressions: killing and harming the worthy and good, committing heinous and vile acts unbefitting a human being, indulging in lust and theft, undermining others’ achievements, separating others from their kin, seizing what others revere, being unfilial as a child, disloyal as a subject, rebelling against my lord, attacking and opposing my teachers and ancestors, showing no reverence above to Heaven and Earth, no reverence below to spirits and deities, slandering the Great Dao, profaning sacred scriptures, speaking falsely with a deceitful heart, boasting of myself and envying the capable, disdaining the Four Great Elements, defiling the Three Luminaries, engaging in malicious speech and double-tongued slander, and maligning good people. These and countless other offenses, boundless and immeasurable, I now face before the Dao and repent with utmost sincerity.

I prostrate and pray that the sagely hosts of the Lower Prime, the Life-Examining Youths, the Merit-Recording Officers of Good and Evil, and the Ten Direct Deities and Immortals will record my transgressions, transform them into merit from this offering, and report them to the Heavenly Courts. May the sins I have repented be dissolved and eradicated with each thought, and may all be completely liberated. May my ninefold ancestors and sevenfold lineage swiftly ascend to higher rebirth; may all sentient beings together reach the shore of the Dao.

With utmost sincerity, I prostrate and bow to the Most High, Void, and Imperial Three Treasures.

Here concludes the *Litany of Repentance for Eliminating Transgressions and Erasing Sins* of the Most High Numinous Treasure’s Lower Prime Water Official.
