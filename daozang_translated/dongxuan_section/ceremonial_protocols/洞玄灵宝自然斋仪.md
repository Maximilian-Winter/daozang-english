**The Rites of the Natural Retreat of the Cavern Mystery and Numinous Treasure**

All bow to the masters, contemplating with proper mindfulness.

Next, strike the ritual drum twenty-four times.

Next, kindle the incense burner.

The Supreme Three Heavens’ Primordial Qi of the Mysterious Origin, the Three Qi of the Most High Lord Lao, are summoned forth. From within our bodies emerge the Three and Five Merit Officials, the Attendant Envoys of the Left and Right, the Left and Right Incense-Bearing Dragon-Riding Couriers, the Golden Lads of Incense, the Jade Maidens of Transmission, the Direct Talismans of the Five Thearchs, and the Incense Officials of the Day—thirty-six of each.

The local earth deities and territorial spirits of this place are invoked.

We now, in this very moment, burn incense and perform the Dao, dedicating it to disciple So-and-So, who petitions for their wishes. May the life-generating qi of the Ten Directions’ true and perfected beings descend and flow into our bodies. May our supplications swiftly ascend, directly reaching the presence of the Most High, Limitless, and Great Dao, the Perfect and Jade August Thearch of the Emperor on High.

Each states their name and rank.

With the full ritual office, we, the mountain-dwelling masters, ministers So-and-So and the like, with unified sincerity, reverently address:

The Vacuous and Spontaneous Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Origin,
The Limitless and Great Dao, the Most High Dao Lord,
The Most High Lord Lao,
The August Jade Emperor on High,
The hosts of great sages who have attained the Dao in the Ten Directions,
The perfected lords and venerable elders,
The thirty-two Heavenly Emperors,
The Jade Clarity August Emperor,
The Jade Emperor and Great Emperor,
The Eastern Florescence, Southern Culmen, Western Numinous, and Northern Perfected,
The Lord of the Dao of the Luminous August Perfected of the Numinous Treasure in the Purple Tenuity Upper Palace of the Seven Jeweled Mysterious Terrace of the Jade Capital of the Dark Metropolis,
The Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center,
The officials and attendants of the Three Realms,
All the revered numina—

We, by karmic conditions of former lives, were born to encounter this great transformation. Through the mysterious and true, we were initiated and uplifted, gaining entry into the Dharma Gate.

Having received the transmission from the Three Masters and sworn the covenant, having revered the sacred scriptures of the Three Treasures, we make offerings and pay homage, seeking the fulfillment of our vows. Overwhelmed by the profound grace, we are filled with both joy and awe. Yet on the day we received the Dharma, we pledged to exhaust all our strength. Though our wisdom is shallow and our abilities meager as a hair, we vow to propagate the Dharma’s resonance, extol its wondrous transformation, and guide all beings without exception into the Dharma Gate—to rescue the living, deliver the dead, and bring peace and bliss to all. Whatever petitions are submitted, by principle they must be presented and elevated. Now, with this memorial text, we reverently proceed to proclaim it.

Proceeding to read the memorial:
As the words therein express, our hearts are earnest and without pretense. We look upward, relying on the supreme Dao, and consider the future with care. We, unworthy as we are, have been graced with boundless compassion, and our duty is but to deliver and save.

We have heard that the August Void spreads the Dharma as the bridge for all beings, and the Great Emperor bestows the scriptures as the path for the thousand perfected. The gates open to receive and guide, and the teachings permit all who seek to approach. With sincerity, response is immediate; with no request, there is no lack of answer. When inner devotion is profound, the zhi orchids manifest as auspicious signs; when numinous blessings descend, the stars align in radiant array.

Now, offering the first pinch of incense, we dedicate body, spirit, and life to the Boundless Dao of the Ten Directions and the Three Supreme Ones. May the merit of this act flow back to the Great Dao. May the disciple [Name]’s nine generations of ancestors and seven lineages of kin, all the departed and the transformed, together escape the Nine Dark Realms and ascend to the Ten Poles. May their names be stricken from the dark registers of the Northern Yin and inscribed in the cinnabar records of the Southern Culmen. May blessings and felicity reach afar, and auspicious signs gather from afar. May enmities cease, and blessings extend to descendants. For this purpose, we now burn incense and take refuge in the virtue of the Masters, the Venerable Saints, and the Perfected Ones. After attaining the Dao, may we ascend into the formless, harmonizing and uniting with the Dao. For the Jade Capital is not distant—gathering thought, it is reached. The True Lord is without limit—following the heart, it responds.

Offering the second pinch of incense, we dedicate body, spirit, and life to the Boundless Dao of the Ten Directions and the Three Supreme Ones. May the merit of this act flow back to the Emperor. Holding the symbol, he transforms the people; grasping the chart, he governs the mandate. The people embrace harmony, and all things attain growth and completion. Extending this to us, the disciples, our Three Masters who transmitted the Dao, our parents who gave us life, the recluses of the cliffs, our fellow students, our ninefold kin and clans, the people of the world, the winged and crawling creatures, and all sentient beings—may each attain peace and security, and all be freed from calamity and misfortune. For this purpose, we now burn incense and take refuge in the virtue of the Masters, the Venerable Saints, and the Perfected Ones. After attaining the Dao, may we ascend into the formless, harmonizing and uniting with the Dao. For the Great Dao is impartial—responding to each according to its capacity. With utmost sincerity and faith, it awaits the call to connect.

Offering the third pinch of incense, we dedicate body, spirit, and life to the Boundless Dao of the Ten Directions and the Three Supreme Ones. May the merit of this act flow back to the host of the retreat. May the Great Dao’s disciple [Name] and their kin and family be granted the dissolution of afflictions and the clarity of body and mind. May they penetrate the profound mysteries of the Golden Chamber and transcend the dark multitudes of Fengdu. May their virtue and goodness naturally manifest, and may the divine and numinous protect and guard them.

May their years stretch ever onward, like withered trees restored to bloom; may their allotted span extend anew, like a dying lamp rekindled with flame. May men and women uphold chastity and obedience, and may livestock flourish and thrive.

Now we burn incense, taking refuge in the virtue of the Venerable Masters, the Great Sages, and the Host of Perfected Ones. After attaining the Dao, may we ascend into the formless, harmonizing and uniting with the Dao.

Next, we pay homage to the Ten Directions and repent;
Next, we repent to the Four Sages.
We, the assembly of ritualists, wholeheartedly take refuge in the Ten Directions’ Boundless Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy, the Divine Immortals of the Ten Quarters, and the Host of Spirit Officials.

Yet this disciple [Name], born amidst the clamor of the dusty world, has long been burdened by transgressions. Qi scattered and spirit lost, falsehood without truth—bound by the snares of affection, lured by the allure of reputation. So deep are these offenses that no safety or peril can be assured. Moreover, we reflect on the sins accumulated from past lives to this very day: hidden faults and manifest errors, transgressions against the Ten Directions. At times, we defy the rhythms of yin and yang, heedless of taboos; we take life and harm beings, indulging desires without restraint. Some sins are committed knowingly, others in ignorance; some arise from our own thoughts, others under coercion—our guilt overflows. The divine ones reproach us, and day and night, we tremble in dread, unable to rest in peace. We lift our gaze to the Exalted Ones, hoping for their sheltering grace.

We purify our hearts and confess our faults, silently praying for mercy. For the sake of performing the wondrous Numinous Treasure Retreat, we seek redemption for the transgressions of both the living and the departed. May all those present—high and low, noble and base—see their misfortunes dissolve like clouds, their destined lifespans endure. May our living kin, both inner and outer clans, enjoy clarity of spirit and partake in the profound blessings of the Dao. May descendants flourish, ever bound to good causes; may fortune arise from all directions, and calamity sink into the ninefold darkness.

We bow our heads in reverence, taking refuge in the Three Jewels.
Next, turning left, we face westward and stand in equilibrium, visualizing the nine-colored circular image and reciting the secret mantra to command the demons.
Next, we pace the void, circling;
Next, we make the Three Petitions;
Next, we perform the Three Bows;
Next, we once more invoke the names and titles.

We, the ritual officers of such-and-such sacred peak, ministers so-and-so, with solemn sincerity jointly reverently address the Supreme, Boundless, Great Dao; the Most Perfect, Numinous Treasure Scriptures in Thirty-Six Sections; the Three Supreme Ones; the host of sages throughout the ten directions; the Great Dharma Masters of the Mystic Realm; the officials of the Three Realms; and all divine spirits.

By the grace that has flowed to us, we have encountered the Great Dharma. Though the Mystic Perfection has initiated and delivered us, and we have been unworthily entrusted with the sacred texts, the stains of the womb and the fetters of vulgarity still bind us, preventing us from rising above them. We have violated the precepts and transgressed the prohibitions, and our cinnabar sincerity remains unexpressed. We ought to resign ourselves to the ashes of the heart and willingly accept the punishments of the unseen. Yet, as the thousand truths have their measure and permit the establishment of even the slightest merit, we rouse ourselves from our limited understanding to reverently proclaim the compassionate transformation, hoping thereby to redeem and succor the multitude of beings.

Now, with utmost devotion, we present the disciple of the Great Dao, so-and-so, whose heartfelt pleas and sincere grievances are truly pitiable and deserving of compassion. Born into the dusty paths of the world, his nature remains obscured and benighted. Bound by karmic conditions and habitual practice, he finds no gate through which to transcend. He relies solely upon the Supreme Mystery, earnestly hoping for its vast beneficence.

We, your ministers, humbly join together, purifying body and mind, burning incense and reciting the scriptures, in the hope of repentance and gratitude. We prostrate ourselves and pray that the Supreme Ones, the Venerable Ones, the Dharma Masters overseeing this fast, the attendant perfected spirits, and the officials of the Three Realms will deign to turn their divine gaze upon us, illuminating and scrutinizing our petition. May they especially open the gate of great forgiveness and graciously grant the humble entreaties of this dust-like being.

We beseech that the disciple, his ninefold ancestors and sevenfold forebears, down to his own person—from kalpas past to this very day—be pardoned. In wanton indulgence and boundless desire, he has amassed vast fields of transgression. Perhaps he has failed to comprehend the true methods or fathomed the wondrous purport; squandered his spirit and depleted his qi; shunned simplicity and favored ostentation; spoken one thing while harboring another; appeared true without while concealing falsehood within. His hidden sins and manifest transgressions are measureless and boundless. Some were committed in ignorance, others with full knowledge. He has violated vows, broken precepts, and through indolence and negligence, fallen into the dark realms. Such offenses, too numerous to recall or recount, we now humbly beseech may be washed away through the burning of incense and the pacing of the Dao.

We pray that the Supreme, Lofty, and Sacred Great Spirits, the host of perfected numina, will bestow the blessings of their great compassion and manifest the efficacy of their divine response. May they turn the fortune of deliverance toward us and descend the boundless grace of their favor. May they summon the flying celestial beings to bear the Nine Dragon Talismanic Mandate of the Azure Palace of the Eastern Flowery Realm, traversing the ten directions to inspect the bureaus and courts. May all the sins and transgressions of the disciple so-and-so’s household, living and deceased, be wholly dissolved. May those undergoing refinement in the Southern Palace have their names stricken from the Northern Bureau. May fortune flow through the mystic generations, and blessings be enjoyed by the living. May the old and young dwell in harmony, and descendants be worthy and noble. May misfortunes scatter like clouds, and auspicious omens arise daily. May servants and retainers enjoy peace and health, and livestock flourish.

We, your ministers, humbly perform this fast on behalf of the patron, presenting our confessions and gratitude. May all our supplications be granted as spoken, and all our petitions be forgiven and absolved. Above, may the vast compassion of the Heavenly Worthy be made manifest; below, may the sincerity of our refuge in the Dao be answered.

We reverently submit this petition for your consideration.

Next, the Twelve Vows.
Next, the Rekindling of the Censer.

O Fragrant Official Envoys, Lords of the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger, and all spirit officials attendant upon the incense: may the fast hall within naturally generate golden liquid, cinnabar, and azure mushroom blossoms. May the hundred numinous perfected ones gather here before the incense burner. May the disciple, after completing this fast, receive blessings for his entire household, both within and without, and may all partake of this grace. May the jade maidens and immortal youths of the ten directions, bearing the fragrant smoke, transmit our petition to the immediate presence of the Supreme, Boundless, Great Dao, the Jade Emperor of the Heavenly Realm.

Next, the Exiting of the Hall.
The Rites of the Natural Fast of the Numinous Treasure of the Cavernous Mystery are thus concluded.
