**Compendium Outline of the Five Numinous Treasure Scriptures**
**Seating the Assembly** | **Ritual Proceedings**

The Most Sagely One, upon hearing the scriptures, awakened to the Dao—
The Heavenly Worthy of Realized Enlightenment.
The Supreme’s subtle words reside in the Five Scriptures,
The Five Scriptures bestow upon the world as if in cinnabar and azure.
With earnest exhortation, they are once more proclaimed and expounded,
To liberate the departed spirits from the darkness of the night-shouldered realm.

We now reverently acknowledge:
That which weaves heaven and warps earth is called the Dao—
The Dao emerges, dividing into Three;
That which establishes teachings to bequeath to the world is called the scriptures—
The scriptures are transmitted in Five Forms.
Proclaiming their wondrous meanings,
Praying for the deliverance of the departed,
We solemnly offer true incense,
And with wholehearted devotion, invoke and supplicate:

The Supreme Non-Ultimate Great Dao, the Void and Spontaneous Primordial Heavenly Worthy of Original Commencement;
The Jade Dawn Dao Lord;
The Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy;
The Heavenly Worthy of Dao and Virtue, the Supreme Venerable Lord Lao;
The August Jade Emperor of the Golden Portal of the Supreme Heavenly Lord of the Vast Sky;
The Eastern Ultimate Azure Mystery Compassionate Father, the Great One Savior from Suffering Heavenly Worthy;
The Great Compassionate Heavenly Worthy of the Ten Directions, Savior from Suffering;
The Nine Heavens Life-Generating Emperor;
The Five Elders of the Five Directions;
The Great Dharma Masters of the Thirty-Six Sections of the Mysterious Worthy Scriptures;
The Three Primordials and Three Officials Emperors;
The True Sovereigns of the Nine Dark Realms for Deliverance;
The Yang and Yin Clerks of the Five Sacred Peaks, Ten Lands, and Earthly Courts;
And all the responsive and perceptive deities within and beyond the Three Realms—
May they all, in their boundless compassion, deign to look down and perceive with penetrating clarity.

To guide one toward the correct Dao and out of the paths of delusion,
One must rely on the torch of wisdom;
To cross the sea of suffering and ascend to the other shore,
One must depend upon the bridge of Dharma.
Thus, the Heavenly Worthy, with a mind of expedient means, established provisional and ultimate teachings for sentient beings,
Revealing the purport of the Five Scriptures,
Serving as the guiding thread for all existence.
Their profound texts are resplendent,
Their grand models towering;
Their admonitions and wondrous instructions
Must be devoted to the Dao,
And grounded in virtue—
Only then can one fathom their depths.
Their arcane meanings and marvelous phrases
Cannot be glimpsed by those who merely speak and hear,
For today, we perform this rite for the deliverance of so-and-so,
Thus, we have reverently assembled the pure assembly before us,
And shall now recite:

*The Scripture of the Nine Heavens’ Life-Generating Chapters from the Cavernous Mystery of the Numinous Treasure*;
*The Supreme Venerable Lord Lao’s Explication of the Wondrous Scripture of Constant Purity and Stillness*;
*The Wondrous Scripture of the Jade Emperor’s Heart Seal from the Highest Heaven*;
*The Supreme’s Cavernous Mystery Scripture of Salvation from Suffering and Deliverance from Sin*;
*The Supreme Scripture of Ascending to Heaven and Attaining the Dao*.

These are specially employed to offer redemption for the departed spirit,
To transcend the mundane and attain liberation.
May the departed so-and-so
Exit the labyrinth of delusion,
Enter the gate of the Inaudible and Invisible,
Generate the Jade Chapters of Life,
Harmonize the Four Symbols and Five Phases,
And through the wondrous scripture of salvation from suffering,
Dissolve the Three Corpses and Six Thieves.
Empty the Five Aggregates to ascend the steps of attaining the Dao,
Purify the Six Sense Faculties to realize the truth of rebirth in heaven.
Forget the heart, forget the form, forget things—
Discern the mechanism of the true and constant, attaining the nature;
Refine the spirit, refine the qi, refine the essence—
Comprehend the Dao of merging and returning to the primordial wind.
May we, together with all sentient beings,
Return to the gateless gate of the formless.
The assembly, with utmost sincerity, joins in praise and chant.

**Recitation of *The Scripture of the Life-Generating Chapters***

We look up to *The Scripture of the Nine Heavens’ Life-Generating Chapters*,
Which is the qi of the Three Caverns’ soaring mystery,
Congealing in emptiness to form Sanskrit,
Spontaneously composing its text—
Thus, it is capable of opening heaven and earth,
And generating all beings.

Generally speaking, the birth of humans
All receives the qi of the Nine Heavens,
Forming the embryo, placenta, hun, and po.
As for the five viscera, six bowels,
Seven orifices, eight luminous scenes,
And the thirty-six thousand spirits—
None are not born through its fusion and congealment.
If there is any obstruction,
The principle of continuous generation is incomplete,
And there are those who, though heavily pregnant, miscarry.

The qi of the Nine Heavens,
When followed and allowed to flow,
Forms an ordinary embryo and becomes human;
When reversed and cultivated,
Forms a sagely embryo and becomes an immortal.
Though the sagely and the ordinary differ,
The Dao they embody is one and the same.

Moreover, heaven holds the yang;
Nine is a yang number.
Those of pure yang are immortals,
Those of pure yin are ghosts.
The perfected person, by using yang to dissolve yin,
Ascends to heaven and becomes an immortal;
The common person, by using yin to dissolve yang,
Descends to earth and becomes a ghost.
Once a ghost,
They undergo torment in Fengdu,
Their hun and spirit scattered and dispersed.
Without relying on the divine chapters to gather their wandering souls,
There is no means to extricate themselves from the eternal night
And return to the realm of luminous yang.

Thus, those who practice refinement and deliverance
Hold this text in the highest regard.
Since the departed so-and-so has heard the numinous sound,
They should now immerse themselves in the cavernous wisdom,
Concentrate their spirit to guard the true dwelling,
Refine the embryo to return to the original beginning.
Naturally, their hun and po will harmonize and soften,
The qi of the Nine Heavens will merge with the Mysterious Female,
And the Dao of the embryonic immortal will be accomplished.
Once the Dao of the embryonic immortal is accomplished,
They shall ride the dragon chariot,
Ascend at dawn in broad daylight—
This is called uniting with the virtue of the Nine Qi.
How can one not exert oneself?
How can one not exert oneself?

To further expound, we chant a verse:

The wondrous qi of the Nine Heavens comes from the void,
Congealing in emptiness to form the sagely embryo.
A body beyond the body, capable of transformation—
Transcending the Three Realms, escaping the wheel of rebirth.

**Assembly responds:** *The Scripture of Life-Generating is rare to encounter.*

**Recitation of *The Scripture of Purity and Stillness***

We look up to *The Supreme Venerable Lord Lao’s Explication of the Wondrous Scripture of Constant Purity and Stillness*,
Which, when the Most High Lord Lao journeyed west to the Windy Terrace,
He expounded to the Queen Mother of the West—
It is the heart-method of the Great Dao.

Let us briefly discuss:
That which all under heaven and earth reveres is the One Dao;
The myriad volumes of scriptures and books elucidate the One Heart.
The Dao has its Great Constancy,
The heart has its true and false.
To cultivate the Dao, one must cultivate the Great Dao;
To discuss the heart, one must first discuss the true heart.

The Great Dao is vast and formless,
Yet capable of transforming all existence;
The true heart is quiescent and unmoving,
Yet capable of establishing the myriad dharmas.
Without the heart, one cannot perceive the entirety of the Dao;
Without the Dao, one cannot perceive the wondrous function of the heart.
Beyond the Dao, there is no heart;
Beyond the heart, there is no Dao.

Thus, the ancients who cultivated the Dao
First cultivated their hearts.
How does one cultivate the heart?

The answer lies in purity and quiescence alone.
How does one attain purity and quiescence?
The answer lies in emptiness alone.
If one can render the square inch of the heart empty,
then not a speck of dust will cling,
not a single thing will linger.
Still and serene, ever pure and ever quiescent,
the solitary spirit moves,
its wondrous responses boundless.
Thus may one transcend the cycle of birth and death—
this is called attaining the Dao.

If the square inch of the heart cannot be made empty,
then a hundred paths and a thousand byways
will labor and toil without,
while the seven emotions and six desires
tumultuously disturb within.
Entangled with external things,
the heart battles daily,
drifting endlessly through the cycle of birth and death,
how then can purity and quiescence be attained,
or the Dao be grasped?

If I, though now lost in the Great Yin,
could awaken to this truth,
settle the mind to seek purity,
dispel desires to seek quiescence,
forget form and things to seek emptiness,
and accumulate these practices over time,
naturally a single spark of numinous light
would penetrate heaven and earth—
what is called "form and spirit both wondrous,
uniting with the Dao in truth."
Roaming the Three Realms,
ascending the Golden Gate,
how could the Left Mysterious Immortal Lord have deceived me?

To expound further, I chant a verse:
The true heart, pure and quiescent, takes the Dao as its宗,
Like the precious moon at mid-heaven.
Sweeping away delusive clouds, leaving no trace of obscurity,
Its light fills the vast emptiness of the Great Void.

*All respond:* Rare and hard to encounter is the *Scripture of Purity and Quiescence.*

Reciting the *Heart Seal Scripture*
We reverently consider the *Jade Emperor’s Heart Seal Wondrous Scripture*,
which the Supreme Thearch uttered from his golden mouth,
and which is the true standard of the Great Elixir Way.
It is said that among the thirty-six thousand kinds of Dao,
only the Great Dao is the orthodox lineage,
and among the three thousand six hundred side doors,
only the Golden Elixir is the true transmission.
The books on the Golden Elixir are as vast as the sea,
but none are as concise and luminous as this scripture.
To name it the *Heart Seal*—is this not fitting?

In general, the three supreme treasures of the human body are:
spirit, qi, and essence.
Those who cultivate and refine take these as the foundation of the elixir,
hence they are called the "upper medicines."
The terms in elixir texts—red lead and black tin,
quicksilver and cinnabar,
gold essence and wood liquid,
*jia-geng*, dragon and tiger,
*kan-li*, crow and hare,
infant and maiden,
yellow woman and earthen crucible—
their names cannot be fully enumerated,
yet all refer to these three.

If one obtains the Dao of returning wind and merging,
gathering, taking, uniting, and binding them,
refining with fire,
and then nurturing with warmth,
the foundation is established in a hundred days,
the embryo is formed in ten months,
and after twelve years, the work is complete.
Shedding the mortal form, the spirit transforms—
once attained, it is eternally attained,
and the Dao of the Golden Elixir is perfected.

These upper medicines are not only present in the human body;
heaven and earth, the myriad things—none lack them.
Only the wise can unite their own spirit with the spirit of heaven, earth, and the myriad things,
their own qi with the qi of heaven, earth, and the myriad things,
their own essence with the essence of heaven, earth, and the myriad things.
Thus they can conceal or reveal themselves naturally,
sharing the lifespan of the Great Void—
this is called attaining the Dao.

Great indeed is this medicine!
Is it not the supreme treasure of the wondrous Dao?

Though I have now sunk into the Great Yin,
and the so-called upper medicines no longer remain,
if one could take the spirit of heaven, earth, and the myriad things as one’s own spirit,
take the qi of heaven, earth, and the myriad things as one’s own qi,
take the essence of heaven, earth, and the myriad things as one’s own essence,
then one would witness the dead revived,
white bones restored to life.
The upper medicines, though scattered, would reunite;
the supreme treasure, though lost, would be regained—
how joyous would this be!

To expound further, I chant a verse:
The upper medicines—spirit, qi, and essence—reside within the body,
Possessed fully by all, neither lacking nor overflowing.
Whoever knows the Dao of merging and returning wind,
In the golden crucible, the yellow sprout grows day by day.

*All respond:* Rare and hard to encounter is the *Heart Seal Scripture.*

Reciting the *Scripture of Salvation*
We look up to the *Supreme Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure Scripture of Salvation and Deliverance from Suffering*,
which originates from the hidden texts of the Azure Empyrean,
and is the secret scripture of refinement and deliverance.
Its essential principles are four, with the crux lying in "presiding over light" alone.

First, *entrusting qi to establish*.
The Primordial Beginning divided the One Qi to separate heaven and earth,
governing the transformation of yin and yang,
the root of the myriad things.
This is what Master Zhou meant when he said:
"The Supreme Ultimate moves and generates yang,
quiesces and generates yin;
yang transforms, yin unites,
and water, fire, wood, metal, and earth are born."

Second, *following qi to generate*.
Once heaven and earth were separated and yin and yang established,
humans received the harmonious qi between them to come into being.
This is what Master Zhou meant when he said:
"The essence of the Two and Five wondrously unite and congeal;
the way of Qian forms the male,
the way of Kun forms the female,
and the myriad things are transformed and generated."

Third, *completing the myriad dharmas*.
Once the human way was established,
sages and worthies emerged among them,
setting forth guiding principles and establishing institutions,
rectifying virtue, benefiting use, and enriching life—
thus the human way would not be exhausted.
This is what Master Zisi meant when he said:
"Cultivating the Dao is called teaching"—
his intent was the same.

Fourth, *presiding over light*.
This light is the substance of nature.
"Presiding" means honoring it as a ruler.
If one can honor this light,
always making it the master of the body,
so that movement and stillness, speech and silence all obey its command,
then naturally the space between the spirit terrace will be
bright, open, and penetrating,
nothing able to obscure it,
and the substance of the Dao will be complete.
This is what the *Doctrine of the Mean* calls "revering the power of nature,"
what the *Great Learning* calls "illuminating the luminous virtue,"
and what *Zhuangzi* calls the "true ruler"—
all refer to this.

This light is possessed by all,
not present because of Yao nor absent because of Jie,
not increased for Yan nor diminished for Zhi.
Grasping it, one is wise;
abandoning it, one is foolish.
Attaining it, one ascends to heaven;
losing it, one sinks into hell.
All the burning, boiling, slaughtering, and cutting in hell,
the myriad forms of bitter suffering—
all arise from losing this light.

Thus, when the Heavenly Worthy delivers sinful souls, He first bestows upon them divine wisdom, enabling them to turn their gaze inward to the source of the heart-mind, that they may recognize their past lives. At the moment of their repentance and awakening, the guilty are instantly pardoned, the imprisoned instantly freed, all sufferings dissolve, and body and mind attain peace—just as a traveler who loses his provisions mid-journey, left to wander hungry and cold along the road, suddenly finds treasure, and all needs are met at once, all sorrows dispelled. Such is the grace of the Heavenly Worthy’s deliverance from suffering.

Should the departed soul, upon encountering this light, know its joy and refine it with diligent cultivation, then in a single morning’s success, a separate body will arise within the emptiness, capable of transcending the three realms’ tribulations and ascending directly to the Heaven of Primordial Beginning—how then could the torments of hell remain?

To expound further, I chant a verse:
Countless delusions are the root of suffering,
When the root of suffering is cut away, the root of goodness remains.
Relying on the might of the sword of wisdom,
One leaps beyond the Five Gates of Suffering in the wheel of rebirth.

*All respond:* Rare and hard to encounter is the *Sutra of Deliverance from Suffering.*

---

Reciting the *Sutra of Ascending to Heaven and Attaining the Dao*

We reverently contemplate the *Most High Sutra of Ascending to Heaven and Attaining the Dao*, which the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning revealed to all heavenly beings as the swiftest path of cultivation. The transmission of the wondrous Dao begins with words and ends in wordlessness; the cultivation of heavenly blessings begins with action and ends in non-action. This sutra opens both the sudden and gradual gates, fully expounding the principles of beginning and end—truly the ladder to the Dao and the steps to ascension.

Tracing the sutra’s intent, the effort of practice comprises six stages:
First, at the outset of entering the Dao, one observes fasting and precepts to strengthen faith.
Second, one widely establishes fields of merit, refining wondrous practices without attachment to myriad conditions.
Third, one constantly maintains right mindfulness, ensuring inner thoughts do not stray outward nor outer thoughts intrude, thereby eliminating afflictions and karmic obstacles.
Fourth, one nurtures true qi, filling the body with supreme harmony, illuminating inner and outer with light.
Fifth, one reduces and regulates diet to nourish the true origin, dispelling the corpse-demons and severing cravings.
Sixth, one purifies the six senses and empties the five aggregates to attain the subtly wondrous.

Those who faithfully practice these six will find the heart congealed and form released, bones and flesh wholly dissolved, enabling them to roam the great void and survey the myriad transformations. Only then will they perceive the complete truth of the Dao’s substance, for the wondrous heart begins in action and ends in non-action—here, silent recognition arises naturally.

Should the departed soul apply themselves to this path, accumulating merit day by day, they will one day join the immortals hand in hand among the Five Cities and Twelve Towers, carefree and at ease, only then regretting their late encounter with this sutra.

To expound further, I chant a verse:
The Dao, with no-mind, delivers sentient beings,
All expedient means reveal the cultivation of truth.
Should one return to the ground of sagely wisdom and perfect penetration,
They become one who ascends to heaven and attains the Dao.

*All respond:* Rare and hard to encounter is the *Sutra of Ascending to Heaven.*

**Concluding the Sutra | Turning the Merit**

We, your servants, reverently contemplate the Three Pure Lords Supreme, the multitude of august ones in the Golden Towers, and the true numina of the three realms invoked in this sutra assembly. May they, in their vast compassion, deign to gaze upon us with all-seeing clarity. May the merit of reciting the Five Sutras of the Most High be wholly dedicated to delivering the soul of the departed, awakening their Dao-nature, and uprooting their suffering.

Upon hearing the *Scripture of the Nine Heavens’ Chapters on the Generation of Spirit*, may they know the source of life’s endowment and cultivate the wondrous practice of returning to the origin.
Upon hearing the *Scripture of Purity and Stillness*, may they suddenly awaken to the nature-school and empty all appearances.
Upon hearing the *Scripture of the Heart Seal*, may they personally refine the study of destiny and forge the inner elixir.
Upon hearing the *Sutra of Deliverance from Suffering*, may they hold fast to this single point of light and not sink into hell.
Upon hearing the *Sutra of Ascending to Heaven and Attaining the Dao*, may they dually cultivate merit and wisdom, directly ascending to heaven, roaming the courts of wondrous being, and reveling in the realms of the primordial chaos—one truth undimmed, enduring through ten thousand kalpas.

Thus, the sutras first guide the lost, and in the end, words are forgotten as meaning is attained—like boarding a boat to cross the sea of suffering, once the far shore is reached, the boat serves no further purpose; like holding a torch to illuminate a lost path, once the right way is found, the torch is no longer needed. This is the ultimate fruition of sutra merit, the great completion of the Dharma assembly.

The assembly, with utmost sincerity, having heard the sutras, now praises and chants.

**Threefold Hearing of the Sutra**
After hearing the sutras, may all beings arouse the mind of dedication, ever upholding faith and reverence.
After hearing the sutras, may all beings awaken to understanding, receive, uphold, and transmit them.
After hearing the sutras, may all beings universally ascend the Dharma-bridge without hindrance.

The *Compendium of the Five Numinous Treasure Sutras* concludes.
