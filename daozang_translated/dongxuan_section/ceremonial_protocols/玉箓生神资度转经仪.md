*"The humble disciple [Name], in full reverence, respectfully invokes:*
*The Sovereign of the Mysterious Teachings, the Jade Clarity Radiant August Dao Lord;*
*The Lords of the Three Heavens, the Orthodox Unity Celestial Masters;*

Today, leading the assembly, I ascend the altar to recite the* Nine Heavens’ Scripture of Generating Divine Spirits from the *Wondrous Mystery Numinous Treasure* *Jade Chapters*—from the first to the third recitation—praying for the elevation of [Name]’s spirit to ascend into purity, and for the wandering souls to be universally aided in attaining rebirth.*

**Ritual Proceedings**

**The Humble Petition of [Rank and Name]**

[Rank and Name] humbly petitions the Ten Directions’ Boundless Flying Heavenly Divine Kings, the Great Sage of Eternal Life and Lord of Limitless Salvation, the Flying Heavenly Envoys, the Flying Heavenly Officers and Soldiers, and all the sacred hosts who guard the scriptures and treasures.

We have heard that when the Primordial Beginning expounded the scriptures, his merit shone through kalpas vast; when the August Sovereign of Emptiness promulgated the teachings, his grace widely extended to all sentient beings. With reverent intent, we diligently follow and recite with sincere devotion. Completing the ninefold recitation of the *Scripture of the Divine Birth*, we deliver all sunken and stagnant souls. Issuing the writs of destiny’s decree, we universally uplift spiritual consciousness; purifying the offerings of water-plants and fern, we express our utmost sincerity. The ritual assembly, in accordance with the rites, performs the fast and extends the invitation.

**Performing the Fast and Extending the Invitation**

The Boundless Flying Heavenly Divine King of the Eastern Direction descends to the altar site.
The Southern, Western, Northern, Northeastern, Southeastern, Southwestern, Northwestern, Upper, and Lower Directions likewise.

Cloud chariots—
Since the invocation was first made, we imagine the feathered standards lingering, the rainbow banners drifting in the distance. A thousand chariots and ten thousand riders surge forth, filling the sky; nine phoenixes and eight simurghs descend from heaven with resonant cries. We, in utmost devotion, offer pure tea in presentation. With this sincere memorial, we respectfully make it known.

**Proclaiming the Memorial**

The memorial is read aloud, its words resounding before the sacred audience. May the merit of the ninefold recitation be universally realized, and may all together witness the wonder of the One Vehicle. May divine souls ascend and be delivered, forever transcending into the realm of purity; may suffering spirits receive grace and fully behold the realm of radiant light. We, in boundless reverence, offer this prayer.

**Respectfully submitted.**

Ascending the altar,
Offering incense,
Bowing in faith and devotion.

Silent reverence to the master, contemplating in accordance with the Dharma.
Invoking the divine incantation:
Seven numinous spirits conceal their presence, the Three Origins merge in form.
Transforming yin and transmuting yang, outwardly pure and inwardly luminous.
Penetrating the Great Harmony, the Nine Palaces gather their essence.
Flying elixirs flourish in brilliance, refining and delivering through the Eight Gates.
Shedding the mortal coil and repelling death, the seven po dissolve and disperse.
The hundred spirits merge as one, and the myriad souls become guests of the Emperor.

Strike the Dharma drum twenty-four times.

We have heard that the original chapters of the Numinous Treasure
encompass the profound mysteries of the hundred demons’ hidden rhymes,
while the wondrous canon of the Cavernous Mystery
unfolds the majestic ritual of the Nine Heavens’ Life-Generating Thearch.

The divine merit equals that of Heaven and Earth,
its vast kindness is true and real—
the living and the dead alike receive its grace,
this is the supreme model,
universally delivering without end.

Now, in reverent compliance with the imperial edict,
we have undertaken the grand jiao of the Jade Register for many days and nights.
Today, ascending the altar to recite in rotation
the *Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure Jade Chapters of the Nine Heavens’ Life-Generating Thearch*,
we offer ascent and recommendation for the spirit of so-and-so,
that they may attain fruition and wander carefree,
while aiding the suffering souls of the departed,
all equally achieving rebirth in the proper realm.

As this ritual is solemnly arrayed,
the jade caskets are about to be opened.
We respectfully present this memorial,
humbly beseeching your august observation.

We pray that the Three Realms’ exalted luminaries,
the Nine Heavens’ supreme sages,
will together bestow their mysterious blessings,
universally granting vast favor.
Condescend to descend upon this ritual arena,
witnessing our vows and accepting our devotion.

Throughout the ten directions of the Dharma Realm,
the six directions of the cosmos,
the beings of the Five Paths,
the prisons of the Nine Dark Realms—
may these merits be universally employed for adornment.

May it be that the scriptural treasures widely propagate,
the gates of darkness cease their trials.
Pure souls receive grace and ascend beyond the Dao’s shore,
suffering spirits undergo refinement and forever depart the Yellow Springs.
Grievances are dissolved,
the roots of sin eradicated.
Swiftly may perfection be achieved in the Dao’s fruit,
and immediate deliverance attained in the Crimson Palace.

We bow our heads and take refuge in the boundless Great Dao.

**Hymn of Rising from the Seat**
Proceeding in void-step, circling to the Palace of Zi,

The master declares:
We humbly acknowledge that your station guards the Palace of Kan,
overseeing the courts of ghosts and spirits;
your majestic power, O Spirit of the Zi, holds authority over sin and fortune.
Radiating through the five qi, you pity the multitudes sunk in suffering.
Today, in reverent obedience to the imperial decree,
we uphold the jade registers in solemn rite,
ascending and recommending the soul of [Name],
to transcend into purity and stillness,
while aiding the suffering spirits,

The virtue of Kun flows at its center,

Delivering beings and benefiting creatures,

**Threefold Recitation of the Sutra**
**Restoring the Deities—Burning Incense**

Immortal spirits and immortal officials, Golden Lads and Jade Maidens, the Five Emperors and Five Marchmounts, divine immortals and perfected beings, the Three *Qi* True Deities, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, celestial and terrestrial immortals, the Five Numinous Incense Officials—we now summon the ten directions’ true *qi*, that the golden liquid elixir, cinnabar mushrooms, and azure herbs may spontaneously arise.

May the hundred spirits and host of perfected ones gather here before the incense burner. May we, your servants, who study the Dao attain the Dao, and those who seek immortality attain immortality.

May the jade maidens and immortal lads of the ten directions attend the incense smoke, swiftly conveying the sincerity of our supplications to the supreme and most true Three Treasures, the August Jade Emperor of the Vast Heaven, the Heavenly Worthy of Salvation from the Eastern Extremity, and the Nine Heavens’ Life-Generating Emperor of the Dao.

**Descending the Altar**
**Thanks to the Master**

Your subordinate, [Name], humbly addresses the Lord of the Mystic Teachings, the Jade Clarity August Sovereign of the Dao, the Three Heavens’ Lord and Master of the Orthodox Unity, the Heavenly Master Perfected Lord; the Lord of the Numinous Treasure Teachings, the Perfected Lord of Scriptures and Ordination; the Great Dharma Master and Overseer of the Retreat; the Perfected Lord of the Left Palace of the Supreme Ultimate; the Perfected Lord of the Grand Historian of the Nine Provinces’ Immortals; the Lord of the Teachings of Heaven and Humankind, the Perfected Lord of Hua Gai and Fu Qiu; and the successive masters of the Orthodox Unity of the Pure Subtlety and Moral Dao.

We reverently beseech your compassion to graciously accept our gratitude. Just now, ascending the altar, we chanted the Jade Chapters of the Life-Generating Deities of the Nine Heavens, praying for the elevation of the soul of [Name] to purity and stillness, and for the deliverance of all orphaned and hidden spirits of the Dharma realm from the depths of darkness, ascending to the immortal realms.

Having completed the third recitation under the guidance of the presiding master, we now offer our thanks, trusting that the rite may be brought to perfect fulfillment. May every blessing be bestowed, all entering the gate of life’s deliverance. As the recitation of the scripture remains unfinished, we briefly delay the immortal retinue’s departure.

At noon, the rites proceed—we shall make further supplications.

Our hearts, in utmost reverence and gratitude, cannot be fully expressed.

Respectfully submitted.

**Thus Concludes**

At the Hour of Noon, the assembly gathers in the Master’s Hall, arrayed in proper order. The ritual proceedings commence—we kneel to make our supplication.

Now, as the Great Sun shines with radiant clarity, its light suffusing the threefold qi’s hidden depths; as the celestial retinue descends to the mortal realm, we envision the hosts of all heavens assembled in perfect harmony.

We, your humble disciples [Names], hereby reverently address the Sovereign of the Mystic Teaching, the Jade Clarity August Dao Lord; the Three Heavens’ Sovereign, the Orthodox Unity Celestial Master; the Sovereign of the Numinous Treasure, the Perfected Lord of Scriptures and Ordinations; the Great Dharma Master and Overseer of the Fast; the Perfected Lord of the Left Palace of the Supreme Ultimate; the Perfected Lord and Grand Scribe of the Nine Provinces; the Sovereign of Human and Heavenly Teachings, the Hua Gai Perfected Lord of Floating Hill; and the successive masters of the Qingwei, Lingbao, and Orthodox Unity traditions.

We humbly beseech your compassion, that you may deign to turn your penetrating gaze upon us.

In reverent compliance with the sacred edict, we now conduct the grand jiao offering, ascending the altar to recite the *Jade Chapters of the Life-Generating Deities of the Nine Heavens* from the fourth to the sixth passage. We pray for the elevation of the soul of [Name] to the realms of blessedness, and for the deliverance of all orphaned spirits of the Dharma realm from the depths of darkness, ascending to the pure domains.

Not presuming upon our own authority, we make this further supplication.

May the seven-jeweled platform of the scriptures ever behold the luxuriant splendor of the Purple Void; may the cavern-palaces of the Three Clarities distantly gaze upon the boundless expanse of the Brahma-qi.

We, your unworthy disciples, dare to trespass upon your august dignity, our hearts overwhelmed with awe and trepidation.

Now, leading the assembly, we ascend the altar to perform the sacred rites in due order.

**Chanting the Dao, we ascend the altar.**

Kindling the incense, we offer reverent obeisance and silent veneration to the Master, contemplating in accordance with the ritual.

We invoke the divine incantation:
At the dawn of the Primordial, the Great Mystery first stirred.
From the Void’s extremity, formless, a single qi flowed into shape.
It transformed into the Two Radiant Ones, the Five Wefts congealed in essence.
Merging with the spontaneous, it dissolved the knots of the womb.
Assembling the perfected, it spread its radiance, resplendent through the Nine Purities.
The Flaming Pool expanded in splendor, the Seven Chronograms aligned with the Well.
We beseech Master Lu Hao, whose essence illumines the Cinnabar Heavens.
Crimson light refines and elevates, scarlet mists disperse their brilliance.
The Three Flowers flourish in luxuriance, their radiance reflecting upon the Imperial Divine Seat.

Striking the ritual drum twenty-four times.

O Most Supreme Three Heavens, Mysterious Primordial Three Qi, Supreme Dao Lord of the Great Dao:
Summon forth from within our bodies the Three and Five Merit Officers, the Attendants of the Left and Right, the Golden Lads of Incense, the Jade Maidens of Flower-Scattering and Message-Bearing, the Five Thearchs’ Direct Envoys and the Daily Fragrance Officials—thirty-six each—commanding them to transmit our words.

We now enter our intention, praying that the Upright Qi of the Ten Directions, the Perfected and True, descend and flow into our bodies, that our supplications may swiftly ascend to the presence of the Most Supreme and Perfect Three Treasures, the August Jade Thearch of the Vast Heaven, the Heavenly Worthy of Salvation from the Eastern Pole, and the Nine Heavens’ Life-Generating Thearch.

Announcing the ritual rank:

We have heard that the Golden Writ of the Three Treasures congeals the wondrous qi of the Empty Mystery, and that the Jade Tablets of the Nine Empyreans conceal the numinous sounds of the Cavernous Void.

Within, the names blend with the hundred spirits, while the roots of life are shaped and perfected among the ten thousand kinds. Guiding the course of governance, chanting reverence and offering, the nine qi coalesce into form; riding the dawn’s rare yang, penetrating the mysterious numinous, the Seven Origins return their radiance.

Vast is the Primal Beginning, congealing the wondrous and void. Moved by the end of the ninefold tread, it pities the responsive convergence of the threefold enclosure. Divine luminance unfolds its mysteries, hidden tones bridge the profound. Above, it opens the light of heaven and earth; below, it measures the transformations of death and life. So subtle it reaches the ultimate of the formless, so elusive it defies surpassing. Gazing upon its towering virtue and power, we exhaust our earnest devotion.

Now, reverently heeding the imperial decree, we have solemnly observed the Jade Register Grand Fast for several days and nights. Today, ascending the altar, we intone the *Nine Heavens’ Life-Giving Divine Chapters of the Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure*, offering ascent and presentation for such-and-such a spirit, that they may attain fruition and carefree wandering, while aiding suffering souls and universally fostering life in all directions.

We humbly pray that compassionate light may illumine the scene, and the darkest depths flow with splendor. May the Jade Terrace release its forbidden script, permitting song and recitation; may the Golden Lattice open its treasured verses, allowing chant and ode. Let the resonant tones ring clear to the nine distances, and the fragrant clarity be heard throughout the Three Realms. Thus may such-and-such a spirit’s nature transcend the gates of death, their qi return to its original root. Riding the jade tones of Great Possession, they shall ascend the jeweled realm of the Wondrous and Non-Being.

We, your servants, bow our heads in homage and take refuge in the Boundless Great Dao.

Now, in reverent obedience to the sacred edict, we solemnly perform the Jade Register rites, ascending and recommending the spirit of [Name], that they may ascend to purity and stillness, while extending aid to suffering souls, that all may together attain rebirth in the living realm.

Let the hundred numinous hosts of Perfected gather here before the incense burner. May we, your servants, who study the Dao attain the Dao, and those who seek immortality attain immortality. May the Jade Maidens and Immortal Lads of the ten directions attend the incense smoke, conveying the sincerity of our supplications to the Most High and Perfect Three Treasures, the August Jade Thearch of the Vast Heaven, the Heavenly Worthy of Salvation of the Eastern Culmen, and the Ninefold Heavenly Thearch of Life before the Dao.

Descending from the altar, we offer thanks to the master. Though we have not observed the three-day retreat, we have been graced with the fortune of this audience. What we now declare pertains to the Two Mysteries, for the ritual protocols truly derive from the master-disciple transmission. We, your humble servant [Name], now address the Lord of the Dao in the Mystic Realm, the Jade Clarity August Sovereign of the Dao, the Lord of the Three Heavens, the Orthodox Unity Heavenly Master Perfected Lord, the Lord of the Numinous Treasure, the Perfected Lord of the Scriptures and Registers, the Great Dharma Master Perfected Lord who Oversees the Retreat, the Perfected Lord of the Left Palace of the Great Ultimate, the Perfected Lord of the Grand Historian of the Nine Provinces, the Lord of the Teaching of Humans and Devas, the Perfected Lord of the Floating Canopy of Mount Fuqiu, and the successive masters of the Orthodox Unity and Pristine Subtlety traditions. We reverently beseech your compassionate regard and humbly express our gratitude.

We have just ascended the altar to intone the Jade Chapters of the Nine Heavens’ Life-Generating Scripture, praying for the elevation of the soul of [Name] to purity and stillness, and for the deliverance of all solitary and obscure beings in the dharma-realm from the depths of darkness, that they may ascend to the immortal realm. Through your august support, we have completed six recitations. We now offer our earnest thanks, relying upon your aid to bring this rite to completion. May no detail remain obscure, and may all Perfected Ones oversee the deliverance. As the recitation of the scripture nears its end, we pray for the flourishing of our Dao. At the close of this day, we shall perform the remaining rituals and present our humble devotion. Our hearts are filled with utmost reverence and gratitude.

Thus we respectfully declare. As before.

At the Evening Audience, the masters assemble in the hall in proper order. The ritual proceedings commence; we kneel and declare:

As the sun pauses in the heavens of all directions, the turning wheel afar listens to the cranes’ songs in the void; as the five-colored clouds interweave, the chariot reverently awaits the phoenix’s cry beneath the feathered canopy. Thrice have we invoked the Venerable Masters, ever adhering to the canonical rites.

We, your disciples, [Names], in all due reverence, address the Supreme Master of the Mysterious Center, the Jade Clarity August Sovereign of the Dao; the Three Heavens’ Supreme Master, the Orthodox Unity Celestial Master Perfected Lord; the Numinous Treasure Supreme Master, the Perfected Lord of Scriptures and Ordination; the Great Dharma Master Perfected Lord who Oversees the Fast; the Perfected Lord of the Left Palace of the Supreme Ultimate; the Perfected Lord of the Nine Provinces’ Immortal Historiographer; the Supreme Master of Human and Heavenly Teachings, the Perfected Lord Fuqiu of the Flowery Canopy; and all successive Venerable Masters of the Pure Tenuity, Numinous Treasure, and Orthodox Unity traditions.

We humbly beseech your compassion, that you may deign to turn your penetrating gaze upon us. Now, in reverent compliance with your august decree, we solemnly perform the Jade Register rites to offer and exalt this grand fast. Today, as the assembly ascends the altar to recite the *Nine Heavens’ Life-Generating Jade Chapters of the Cavernous Mystery and Numinous Treasure* from the seventh to the ninth recitation, we pray for the elevation of the soul of [Name] to purity and stillness, and for all solitary spirits in the dharma-realm to together realize their good causes, ascend to Perfection, and attain deliverance. Daring not act on our own, we once more present this declaration. We humbly implore your divine aid to uphold and guide us from beginning to end.

May we reverently beseech the transmission of the esoteric secrets never imparted to the uninitiated, that the subtle be revealed and the profound be expounded; may the gates of deliverance for the divine souls be flung open, and the radiant light be turned back to guide their return. We await your august command to proclaim and intone the sacred chapters.

Daring to presume beneath the awe of your majesty, we below are overwhelmed with trepidation. Leading the assembly to ascend the altar, we reverently perform the prescribed rites:

**Chanting the Dao, ascending the altar, offering incense, making the pledge, bowing in silence to the masters, and contemplating as prescribed.**

We invoke the proclamation of the divine incantations—**the Most Supreme Perfected, the Great Sage and Lofty Venerables**—who spread transformation and circulate qi through the Thirty-Two Heavens. The Eight Assemblies and Nine Luminances naturally form their script, stabilizing heaven and earth and safeguarding the kalpas. The primordial mandate of the Originator is universally proclaimed to the Three Primes; below, it commands the Nine Earths, above, it seals the myriad heavens, and in the center, it announces to the seas and mountains, the great peaks and rivers. Today, we make this supreme declaration, and all spirits hear it. As we perform the fast and practice the Dao, we deliver the hidden souls. The Three Officials and Nine Bureaus eradicate their evil roots, forever liberating them from the Three Paths and the source of the Five Sufferings. Generation after generation, they receive blessings, their names inscribed in the cinnabar registers. Their spirits ascend to the heavens, refined and transformed by nature. The gates of life and death are opened for their deliverance, granting them eternal years through countless kalpas. The Nine Heavens’ mandate is transmitted by wind and fire couriers.

**Strike the dharma drum twenty-four times.**

**The Most Supreme Three Heavens’ Mysterious Originator, the Three Qi’s Most High Dao Lord**, summon forth from within our bodies the Three and Five Merit Officers, the Left and Right Attendants, the Incense-Bearing Golden Lads, the Message-Transmitting and Flower-Scattering Jade Maidens, the Five Thearchs’ Direct Envoys, and the Day-Officers of the Incense Bureau—thirty-six of each—to emerge. Let those who emerge be arrayed in solemn attire, and let the words we speak be conveyed without delay.

We now set our intention, praying that the life-generating qi of the Ten Directions’ Orthodox Perfected may descend and flow into our bodies, so that our supplications may swiftly reach the presence of the **Most Supreme Perfected Three Treasures, the August Jade Thearch of the Vast Heaven, the Heavenly Worthy of the Eastern Ultimate Who Saves from Suffering, and the Nine Heavens’ Life-Generating Thearch of the Dao**.

**Announce the dharma ranks.**

We have heard that when the Dragon Han first unfolded its chart, the Jade Vault expanded across the Five Primes; when the Crane’s cry governed the kalpa, golden scriptures wove through the Three Numinous Ones.

At the inception of Azure Perfection, wondrous tones revolved tenfold; as the Void’s Azure congealed in truth, jade-like sounds resounded nine times. Unfolding divine works through warp and weft, manifesting purple qi amid the dark and yellow. Phoenix-script illumines in circling radiance, jasper towers stand as flying celestials’ guard; dragon-chapters blaze in splendor, the Purple Palace unfolds its treasury of prohibitions’ store. As the compassionate ferry across the sea of suffering, truly the kindling torch upon the darkened thoroughfare. All who offer sincere prayers must rely on the profound grace.

Now, in reverent compliance with the imperial edict, we have solemnly observed the Jade Register Grand Fast for several days and nights. Today, ascending the altar, we chant and intone the *Dongxuan Lingbao Jiutian Shengshen Yuzhang*, ascending to present the spirit of so-and-so, that they may be reborn in the blessed realm above, and that the lonely and hidden below may equally attain the realm of life. We humbly pray that all ten directions be encompassed, all myriad beings be uplifted. May the soul ascend to the jeweled realm, the hidden and forlorn be cleansed in the cold spring. May they, by the true vehicle’s power, swiftly dissolve deluded karma.

We, your servants, bow our heads in homage, taking refuge in the Boundless Dao.

Now, the recitation of the precious chapters has completed seven cycles. Overflowing with profound grace, we proclaim and transmit below to the nether courts for enactment.

Upon attending the sutra, sighing the sutra, and thrice hearing the sutra,
the master gathers the sutra with praise—
gathering the sutra to attain the Dao, following mindfulness to rebirth.
Boundless mysterious merit, limitless grace and blessings.
We humbly pray to dissolve karmic entanglements of the past,
and meet conditions for the future.
May none fall into the Three Wretched Realms,
and all be freed from the Eight Difficulties.
We bow our heads in reverence, taking refuge in the supreme Dao-Treasure.
Gathering the sutra to attain the Dao, following mindfulness to rebirth.
Measureless vast grace, boundless sagely power.
We humbly pray that the wheel of rebirth be stilled,
and the bonds of karmic entanglement forever severed.
May the dark realms shine with radiance,
and divine souls undergo refinement.
We bow our heads in reverence, taking refuge in the supreme Sutra-Treasure.
Gathering the sutra to attain the Dao, following mindfulness to rebirth.
Infinite good affinity, inexhaustible wondrous power.
We humbly pray that the Four Offices flow without obstruction,
and the Nine Bureaus silently communicate.
May souls ascend the Vermilion Mound,
and spirits wander the Purple Palace.
We bow our heads in reverence, taking refuge in the supreme Master-Treasure.

Returning the spirits and burning incense.
Celestial spirits and officials, golden lads and jade maidens,
the Five Emperors and Five Peaks’ immortals and perfected,
the Three Qi’s true deities, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords,
heavenly immortals and earthly immortals, the Five Numinous Incense Officials—
now summon and gather the ten directions’ true qi,
naturally giving rise to golden liquid, cinnabar, and azure mushrooms.
The hundred numinous perfected hosts converge here,
before the incense burner.
May your servant study the Dao and attain the Dao,
seek immortality and attain immortality.
May the ten directions’ immortal lads and jade maidens
attend the incense smoke,
and swiftly convey the sincerity of your servant’s earlier entreaties
directly to the presence of the Supreme Perfected Three Treasures,
the Jade Emperor of the Vast Heaven,
the Heavenly Worthy of Eastern Relief from Suffering,
and the Nine Heavens’ Life-Generating Emperor of the Dao.

Giving thanks to the divine kings.
Reiterating the dharma-ranks,
your servant, [Name], humbly addresses the ten directions’ boundless flying celestial divine kings and envoys,
the flying celestial officials and soldiers, the sagely hosts.
We reverently gaze upon the auspicious light,
humbly awaiting your penetrating insight.
For the ninefold recitation of the Life-Generating Scripture,
we rely entirely upon the grace of reverent chanting;
through the Three Vehicles’ expounding of wonders,
we fully inherit the merit of opening and pardoning.
Yesterday, in reverent compliance with the imperial decree,
we solemnly performed the Jade Register Great Retreat,
ascending and recommending the spirit of [Name],
to rise to the realm of blessings,
and broadly aiding the forlorn souls to equally attain the realm of life.
Earlier, leading the assembly to ascend the altar,
we turned and chanted the *Nine Heavens’ Life-Generating Jade Chapters of the Numinous Treasure of the Cavernous Mystery*,
completing nine cycles.
Without the sagely creation, how could perfection be achieved?
We exhaust our humble devotion, redoubling our sincerity.
The memorial document was recited with reverence,
and respectfully proclaimed in full.
Proclamation of the Memorial.
Proclamation of the Pass.
The memorial document has been proclaimed;
we trust it reaches your profound wisdom.
We humbly pray that you oversee the deliverance of beings,
and, hearing their cries, hasten to save the suffering;
that you turn your radiant chariot and return,
fulfilling our prayers to deliver the world.
We cannot express our reverence,
nor our longing.
We, [Names], bow again in reverent devotion,
and with one heart, respectfully send you forth.
Retreat concluded.
Cloud chariots depart.

Upon the conclusion of the offering by fire,
we, your humble servants [Names], in our proper ranks,
respectfully address the Sovereign of the Mystic Teaching of the Cavernous Mystery,
the Jade Clarity August Emperor Dao Lord,
the Three Heavens’ Sovereign and Orthodox Unity Celestial Master Perfected Lord,
the Sovereign of the Numinous Treasure and Perfected Lord of the Canonical Preceptor,
the Perfected Lord Great Dharma Master Supervising the Retreat,
the Perfected Lord Immortal Duke of the Left Palace of the Supreme Ultimate,
the Perfected Lord Grand Scribe of the Nine Provinces’ Immortals,
the Sovereign of the Teaching for Humans and Devas and Perfected Lord Fuqiu of the Canopy,
and the successive preceptor lords of the Pure Tenuity, Numinous Treasure, Dao Virtue, and Orthodox Unity traditions.

We reverently beseech your compassionate regard,
that you deign to turn your penetrating insight upon us.
We, having ascended the altar and recited the *Jade Chapters of the Nine Heavens’ Life-Generating Numinous Treasure of the Cavernous Mystery*,
have ascended and recommended the spirit of [Name],
advancing it to the realm of blessedness,
extending aid to the suffering and departed,
and universally guiding all toward the attainment of life’s true domain.
Through your sovereign oversight,
the nine cycles have been completed.
Yet we fear the unsettled state of form and spirit,
and dread the errors that may arise in thought and intention.
We humbly implore your forbearance,
that the good fruit may be brought to fulfillment.

We pray that the imperial presence remain unwavering,
and that Heaven incline its will toward us.
May those receiving rebirth be delivered,
their souls all freed from the dark yin realms;
may responsive encounters with the numinous be fulfilled,
and the work of perfect harmony be wholly achieved.
We presume upon your august severity,
and in our lowly devotion,
are overwhelmed with awe and reverent gratitude.
Thus we respectfully submit.

Retreat concluded.

The Rite of the Cloud Chariot and the Jade Register for the Nurturance of Life through the Recitation of Transformative Scriptures is now concluded.
