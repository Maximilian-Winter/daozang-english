*The Ritual of Dawn Dao-Recitation for the Supreme Cavernous Abyss Samādhi Divine Incantation Retreat*
Edited and revised by Master Guangcheng, Du Guangting.

Before the Mystic Master, ranks are established, and the recitation begins:
"All assembled in the Dao-chamber, each direct your minds and pledge your lives to the Three Treasures."

Next, the *Hua-Xia Hymn* is intoned.
Next, the *Entering the Chamber Incantation*.
Next, the *Five Directions Incense* is offered, beginning with the East.
Next, the *Incense for the Imperial Table* is offered.
Next, each bows to the master, visualizing as prescribed: bowing to the master while envisioning the Azure Cloud Azure Emperor, as in the *Yellow Register Ritual*.
Next, the *Guardian Spirit Incantation*.
Next, the *Dharma Drum* is sounded twenty-four times.
Next, the *Incense Burner Invocation*:

"Supreme Mystic Origin, Five Numinous Venerable Lord,
Summon now the Merit-Recording Attendants,
The Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords,
The Incense-Bearing Messengers,
The Three Qi Orthodox Spirits—
Hasten to report and ascend, opening the gates to the Three Heavens’ Supreme Mystic Origin Dao Lord.
Your servant now burns incense on behalf of the retreat sponsor [Name],
Conducting the great retreat of the *Supreme Cavernous Abyss Samādhi Divine Incantation*,
To succor and protect the realms of humans and heavens,
To dissolve and dispel calamities and misfortunes.
May the life-qi of the Supreme Ten Directions’ Orthodox Perfected descend and flow into our bodies.
May this petition swiftly reach the presence of the Supreme Mystic Elder, the Utmost Real, the Boundless Dao, the Great Unity Jade Emperor."
Each performs three bows.

Next, each declares their ritual rank:
"Disciple of the Three Luminaries of the Supreme Clarity Mystic Capital and Great Cavern,
Unsurpassed Master of the Three Caverns,
Presiding over the ritual affairs of the *Samādhi Divine Incantation Great Retreat*,
[Name], Master of [Sacred Peak] and [Celestial Title],
Lesser Manifestation Perfected."

Your servants [Names], with unified sincerity, reverently address:
The Primordial Heavenly Venerable of the Void and Spontaneous Origin,
The Boundless Dao, the Supreme Great Dao Lord,
The Utmost Mystic Elder, the Supreme Mystic Origin Venerable Lord,
The Great Sage Perfected who have attained the Dao,
The Utmost Real Lords and Venerable Ones,
The Great Dharma Masters of the *Cavernous Abyss Samādhi Divine Incantation*,
The Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures within the Mysteries,
The Supreme Unity of the Upper Prime, the Three Heavens’ Void Cavern,
The Myriad Sage Dao Lords,
The Twenty-Four Exalted Venerables,
The Perfected of the Ten Directions,
The Heavenly Immortals, Earthly Immortals, True Immortals, Flying Immortals,
The Divine Immortals of the Five Peaks,
The Three Treasures’ Majestic Spirits of all heavens and the utmost realms,
The Three Realms’ True Numinous Ones who respond to conditions and perceptions.

We, your servants, have long been favored with profound blessings,
Presuming to bear the Great Dharma.
Revering the sacred scriptures and precious formulas,
We have been permitted to receive and cultivate them."

At this covenanted hour of proclamation, when transformation is to be declared,
We aid and uphold the state, succoring and shielding gods and humans.
Extending universally to the hidden and the manifest, all are enabled to attain liberation.
Moreover, having received these sacred commands, how dare we not make them known above?

Next, the reading of the invocation:
Following the meaning of the words, with utmost sincerity and reverence, we perform the fast,
Directly beseeching blessings and seeking grace.
We, your servants, unworthy of our offices in the Mysteries,
Must duly comply and act accordingly.

With solemnity, we array incense and candles, setting forth the altar precincts.
In accordance with the rites of the Supreme Unity Heavenly Worthy and the Venerable Elder,
We undertake the grand fast of the *Cavernous Abyss Samādhi Divine Incantation*.
Day and night, we exert ourselves with devotion, reciting scriptures and performing the Dao-circumambulation.
We invoke the Five Quarters’ Celestial Emperors and the heavenly officials and soldiers,
The majestic spirits of the Three Caverns, the dragon and tiger mounts.
Expelling rebellious demons, sweeping away pernicious influences,
Dispersing qi and deploying spirits, subduing malevolent forces.
Dispelling calamities and bestowing blessings, aiding the Dao and manifesting its power.
The true numinous ones of heaven and earth respond and descend in timely fashion.

At this pure dawn of the Dao-circumambulation, with the first offering of incense,
We dedicate our bodies, spirits, and lives to the Great Dao.
We, your servants, prostrate ourselves, dedicating our lives to the Three Supreme Worthies.
By this merit, may it flow to the altars of state,
Honoring the ancestral spirits and former sages.
Ascending to the Purple Palaces of the Perfected, soaring to the Clear Capital,
Riding the phoenix chariot in circling flight, securing the dragon’s fortune for eternal endurance.
May the land be broader than the realms of Yao and the traces of Yu,
The imperial destiny more glorious than the eras of Zhou and Han.
May the two images be harmonious and tranquil, the three luminaries radiant and bright.
After attaining the Dao, ascending into the formless,
Harmonizing and uniting with the Dao in truth.

With the second offering of incense,
We dedicate our bodies, spirits, and lives to the Great Dao.
We, your servants, prostrate ourselves, dedicating our lives to the Supreme Scriptures.
By this merit, may it ascend as prayers for the Emperor:
May the two poles stand firm together, the three radiances shine equally bright.
May his benevolence equal that of Yao and Tang, his transformative power surpass that of Fuxi and Gao.
May the Empress, consorts, and imperial ladies,
The Crown Prince and the various princes,
Virtuously assist the Purple Throne, their achievements upholding the imperial ultimate.
May the civil and military ministers, officials within and without,
Bestow impartial grace, bringing harmony and completing transformation.
May weapons be forever sheathed, floods and droughts never arise.
May plagues and poisons not invade, auspicious signs surely gather.
May the eight frontiers and nine wilds attain the winds of purity and tranquility.
From the hidden to the manifest, may all witness the era of ascending peace.
After attaining the Dao, ascending into the formless,
Harmonizing and uniting with the Dao in truth.

With the third offering of incense,
We dedicate our bodies, spirits, and lives to the Great Dao.
We, your servants, prostrate ourselves, dedicating our lives to the Three Great Masters.
By this merit, may it flow to the disciple’s household, the nine ancestral generations and seven lineages,
And all the hidden spirits.
May they be released from the Earth Prison, born in the Heavenly Mansion of Spirits.
May enmities be resolved, transgressions dissolved and pacified.
May the disciple’s family and kin, the six relations together,
Receive blessings and protection from former lives.
May the debts and faults of this life and past be entirely absolved through repentance,
All calamities and misfortunes extinguished.
May true numinous ones protect and guard, virtue and the Dao support and uphold.
May misfortunes be cleared away, evil demons crushed and scattered.
May heavenly soldiers and divine generals bestow blessings and confer auspicious signs.
After attaining the Dao, ascending into the formless,
Harmonizing and uniting with the Dao in truth.

Next, the salutation to the quarters.
Next, the repentance to the quarters.

Next, at the Ghost Gate, visualize the spirits and recite the secret incantation to command the demons.
Next, circumambulate the void in three revolutions.
Next, perform the three prostrations.

With utmost sincerity, bow the head to the ground before the Supreme Boundless Great Dao.
With utmost sincerity, bow the head to the ground before the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures.
With utmost sincerity, bow the head to the ground before the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center.

Next, again declare the dharma ranks:
Fulfilling the dharma offices, upholding the Three Mysteries’ divine incantations and the grand purification ritual, so-and-so of such-and-such mountain.

Your servants, so-and-so and others, respectfully and solemnly address:
The Supreme Boundless Great Dao, the Most High Mysterious Ancient, the Supreme Mysterious Primordial Lord of the Dao;
The Cavern Spirits, Cavern Abyss, Cavern Mystery, and Cavern Truth;
The Treasured Might of the Three Mysteries’ Divine Incantations Sutra;
The Heavenly Immortals, Earthly Immortals, True Immortals, and Flying Immortals;
The Divine Immortals of the Five Peaks;
The Perfected Ones of the Ten Directions;
The Great Sage Assemblies who have attained the Dao;
The Most Perfected Lords and Venerable Masters;
The officials and retinues of the Three Realms;
All revered numinous beings.

We, your servants, have presumptuously received this blessed opportunity to tread the dharma gate.
We bear the precious scriptures and the profound dharma of the Cavern Abyss.
Our duty is to proclaim and propagate the wondrous teachings, to deliver and liberate humans and devas.
To assist the state and establish merit, to uphold and propagate the true transformation.

So-and-so, such-and-such official, has requested the performance of the Supreme Divine Incantation Grand Purification.
We have arrayed the altar, prepared abundant offerings and sincere gifts.
We turn the scriptures and perform the Dao, burn incense and light lamps.
We repent and atone for transgressions, dissolve and dispel calamities and faults.
We notify the Three Realms and summon the myriad spirits.
We invite the twelve hundred officials, heavenly soldiers, and divine generals
To exterminate evil and subdue vengeful demons.
We pour forth our hidden sincerity, hoping for communion and response.

We humbly beseech the lofty sages of the ten directions, the Three Supreme Ones of the Most High,
Whose compassion flows abundantly, whose majestic radiance shines below.
Command the heavenly and earthly bureaus, the Five Emperors and Three Officials,
The Mount Tai and Fengdu administrations, the officials of the peaks and marshes,
To absolve so-and-so, such-and-such official, of the deep-seated stains accumulated
From past lives to the present, through countless kalpas, boundless and immeasurable.
Former transgressions unrepented, new sins added thereafter,
Bound in the courts of heaven and earth, the yin and yang repositories,
Within the peaks and marshes, the water and fire bureaus.
Some are entangled in litigation, others marked by punishments.
Thus inviting calamities, with no means to pray and atone.
Or defiling the Three Luminaries, slighting the Four Great Elements,
Openly violating prohibitions, secretly offending the spirits.
Entangled and enmeshed, beyond recollection.
Through this repentance and atonement, we beg for their complete eradication.
Grant that enmities and debts be harmonized, transgressions and faults cleansed.
May offenses be dissolved, calamities transcended.
May karmic retributions in the dark abyss all receive pardon.
May they roam freely in the celestial realms, be refined and transformed in the blessed courtyards.
Bestow protection and extend auspiciousness, eternally prospering their blessed destiny.

If there are plagues or illnesses, proceed with the following phrases.
If there are no such matters, cease here.

Now, within the nation’s lands and the household’s dwelling,
Epidemic poisons spread.
The children wail piteously, suffering misfortune and violence.
We look up to implore the mysterious protection, to pity and deliver the living beings.

According to the Orthodox Unity’s statutes of the Three Heavens’ Dharma Masters,
We execute the subjugation of demons and control of ghosts, restraining and binding demonic spirits.
Respectfully, on behalf of so-and-so, such-and-such official,
We invoke the Five Supreme High Granary Lords, with one hundred thousand soldiers,
To capture and eliminate the ghosts of the Three Mounds and Five Tombs.
We invoke the Five Heavenly Bureau Qi-Moving Lords, with one hundred thousand soldiers,
To capture and eliminate the ghosts of the one hundred twenty prohibitions, punishments, jealousies, and destructions within so-and-so’s household.
We invoke the Five Lords of the Central Bureau’s Upright Qi, riding white chariots and white horses, with one hundred thousand soldiers,
To capture and eliminate the ghosts of all evil spirits, demons, and calamities within so-and-so’s household.
We invoke the Five Lords of Interrogation and Summoning, with one hundred thousand soldiers,
To capture and eliminate the ghosts of so-and-so’s household’s subordinate officials, old qi, earth spirits, and lunar eclipses.
We invoke the Five Lords of Qi-Moving and Affliction-Dissolving, Guardians of the Household, with one hundred twenty officials, one hundred thousand soldiers,
To capture and eliminate the ghosts of the five poisons, hundred diseases, and adverse qi in so-and-so’s new and old residences.
We invoke the Five Heavenly Lords of Fault and Rebellion, with one hundred twenty officials, one hundred thousand soldiers,
To capture and eliminate the ghosts of depletion, harm, essence-demons, and those that attract external demons and thieves within so-and-so’s household.
We invoke the Five Lords of the Broad Bureau, with one hundred twenty officials, one hundred thousand soldiers,
To capture and eliminate the ghosts of the twelve months’ positions, destructive killings, and depletions within so-and-so’s household.
We invoke the Five Lords of the Northern City’s Edicts, Transformations, Counsel, and Deliberation, with one hundred twenty officials, one hundred thousand soldiers,
To capture and eliminate the ghosts of the northern general’s destruction of the king within so-and-so’s household.
We invoke the One Thousand Two Hundred Heavenly Heart Censors and Attendants, with one hundred thousand soldiers,
To capture and eliminate the ghosts of seasonal epidemics, five poisons, pestilential qi, and diseases within so-and-so’s household.
We invoke the Five Lords of the Level Heaven, with one hundred twenty officials, one hundred thousand soldiers,
To capture and eliminate the ghosts of punishments, curses, and ancestral temple qi within so-and-so’s household.
We invoke the Five Supreme Lords of Great Harmony, with one hundred twenty officials, one hundred thousand soldiers,
To capture and eliminate the ghosts of mountain spirits, wild ways, five divisions of soldiers, and hunting within so-and-so’s household.
We invoke the Five Lords of Spirit-Gathering and Supreme Clarity, with one hundred twenty officials, one hundred thousand soldiers,
To capture and eliminate the ghosts that deplete and disturb human spirits, frighten and agitate souls, causing restless dreams within so-and-so’s household.

The twelve divisions of heavenly officials, soldiers, and troops, all assembled in their ranks, descend in timely response.
They encircle the courtyard and dwelling, arraying the eight directions.
Above, they shake thunder and lightning; on all sides, they deploy their formations.
Within the household’s inner and outer precincts, they search and capture the wicked and evil,
Severing filth and executing the malevolent, burning and sweeping away demonic afflictions.
The old qi of the Six Heavens, the essences of the myriad elders,
The thousand ghosts and ten thousand spirits, the epidemic poisons of the five directions,
The mountain spirits and strange lights, the inner and outer strongholds,
The lingering punishments and flowing calamities, the earth lords’ harmful qi,
The stellar illuminations and continuous misfortunes, the karmic retributions not of the deceased,
The newly dead and long departed, the yin and yang killings,
The qi of punishments and curses, the jealous ghosts and envious spirits—
All are captured, exterminated, and eradicated, forever severed and cut off.
The lords of yin and yang, all the orthodox spirits,
Securely guard the directions, repelling and expelling the false and perverse.

Should any violate prohibitions or disturb the dragon spirits,
Through prayers, repentance, and expiation, transform misfortune into fortune.

The seventy-two ranks of spirits—those of punishment and virtue—assist the Dao and pacify the people, dispelling disaster and bringing forth fortune. Offenses and transgressions are absolved; illness and misfortune cannot intrude. Some say it is complete healing. Nine generations and seven mysteries ascend to heaven and realize the Dao. Attaining auspicious blessings, they forever preserve peace and tranquility. On the day when merits are proclaimed, ranks are elevated and rewards bestowed. For private households, this brings their own abundant blessings. To be continued hereafter.

Supreme prayers:
May heaven and earth shine in harmony, sun and moon remain steadfast in clarity.
May the five planets follow their constant course, all directions enjoy prosperity.
May the imperial enterprise stand firm, the sage’s longevity extend far.
May the altars of soil and grain be revered and numinous, ancestral and former sages be honored.
May the precious reign flourish, its blessings extending throughout the realm.
May ministers serve with loyalty and integrity, millet and grain yield abundant harvests.
May weapons of war sheathe themselves, auspicious signs manifest far and wide.
May the myriad states pay homage to the court, the remotest lands present tribute.

For this household, the flow of qi spreads, the power of goodness permeates.
Auspicious blessings renew daily, kin and relations share in fortune.
The three realms and six destinies, all creatures that fly or sink—
Wherever the sagely grace reaches, all under heaven are wholly saved.

Above, this manifests the great compassion of the Heavenly Worthy;
Below, it answers the sincere repentance of this servant and the assembly.
Respectfully offered.
