**Golden Seal Tenfold Ritual for Deliverance of Beings: Morning Invocation and Reception Ceremony**
*Declaration of Ritual Purity*

With utmost sincerity, I take refuge in the ten directions of sacred scriptures,
May I vow that all beings open their hearts to enlightenment and understanding,
And faithfully uphold, recite, and chant them.

With utmost sincerity, I take refuge in the ten directions of Dao/Way’s treasures,
May I vow that all beings awaken their minds to dedicate merit,
And universally embrace faith and reverence.

With utmost sincerity, I take refuge in the ten directions of the Master’s treasures,
May I vow that all beings ascend the Law’s bridge without obstruction.

**Ode to Past Lives**

Though faith in past lives exists, the weak and lost deny it.
All seek to witness it now—
Yet when they hear, they call it vain and distant.

The great sages teach the Dao with clarity,
Their sorrowful hearts pity the stubborn and deluded.
They grieve for my suffering, boundless in their care,
Their ceaseless efforts bring me endless worry.

---
**First Invocation: Opening the Scripture**

Your humble servant, with reverence, presents:
When the Golden Seal (金蒙) established the primordial axis,
The sacred text was already contained within the boundless expanse;
When the Dragon Han (龙汉) revealed its diagram,
The Primordial Beginning (元始) emerged in the ancient kalpa (祖劫).

As the divine wind stirred,
The Dao/Way’s *qi* began to coalesce.
The Eight Trigrams of the Dragon’s scripture were formed,
The Three Primordial *fans* (凤篆) of the Phoenix were perfected.

From this, the myriad transformations of Heaven and Earth were born;
By this, the four seasons of Yin and Yang were set in motion.

The Dao’s teachings align with the diagrams of the Yellow River and Luo (河洛之图书),
And proceed without contradiction;
Its efficacy surpasses the eight trigrams of Xi and Fu (羲文之卦象),
Yet is still insufficient to describe.

The subject now humbly obeys the august edict,
and devoutly practices the Golden Seal rites,
prolonging the solemn fast for several days and nights.
The subject leads the assembled officials upon the altar platform,
reciting in turn the *Tàishàng Dòngxuán Língbǎo Wúliáng Dùrén Shàngpǐn Miào Jīng*—
the *Mysterious Scripture of the Supreme Dao/Way, Spirit Treasure, and Infinite Salvation*—
in reverent homage to the sacred edicts,
each recited in full.

In reliance upon the boundless Three Treasures (三宝),
the merciful Sovereign of the Ten Directions (十方) and all celestial saints (诸天大圣),
whose compassionate vows and efficacy sustain the sacred scriptures,
the subject humbly prays that the Golden Mouth (金口) may proclaim the profound mysteries,
and the luminous repository (琅函) may unveil its hidden secrets.

To reveal the mysteries of the Primordial Beginning (先天),
and to expound the ancient texts (太古篇章),
so that all beneath Heaven and Earth’s vast expanse
may universally attain enlightenment,
and none be left without grace.

With deepest reverence to the Void Sovereign (虚皇),
the subject practices the sacred scriptures.

**Reciting while seated:**
**Reciting upon completion, dissolving the seat:**
For all future lives,
to cultivate auspicious causes and conditions.

If granted enlightenment,
the subject gratefully receives the profound mercy.

**Dedicatory Merit Transfer:**

The subject humbly presents:
The Great Brightness (大明) was born in the East (东),
where the East holds the position of Minor Yang (少阳).
All things emerge from the *Zhèn* (震) trigram,
which is the domain of the Thunder Gate (雷门).

Thus, when Yang is aroused and strikes,
there is sound;
when the Thunder Gate is roused and activated,
it pierces the senses.

All celestial beings praise its virtue,
leaping in joyous accord with the sacred resonance;
The realm inclines in heart,
and here begins the hearing of the Supreme Dao/Way.

This is the meaning of "healing the deaf to make them hear"—
the efficacy of the scripture’s symbols.

The subject, having just led the officials in reciting
the *Tàishàng Dòngxuán Língbǎo Wúliáng Dùrén Shàngpǐn Miào Jīng*,
turns the merit toward the East:

The Supreme Spirit Treasure of the Boundless Primordial (无极太上灵宝天尊),
The Celestial Descending Blessing of the Jade Purity (玉清降福天尊),
The Nine *Qi* Sovereign of the East, Green Primordial (青元青天九炁天君),
The Eastern Dipper Star of Recorded Destiny (东斗注算星君),
The Green Sovereign Protecting Spirits (青帝护魂君),
The Supreme Sun Emperor of the Day Palace, Great Dan Yu’s Flaming Radiance (日宫太丹郁仪炎光太阳帝君),
The Celestial Enclosure Emperor-Sed (天垣帝座星君),
The Supreme True Sovereign of the Eastern Wood Virtue, Green Emperor of the Primordial Yang (木德始阳青皇上真道君),
The True Sovereign of the Year Star (岁星真君),
The Eastern *Dī* Constellation Star Sovereign (氐宿星君),
The Heavenly Chariot Star of the House Constellation (天驷房宿星君),
The Heavenly King Star of the Heart Constellation (心宿天王星君),
The Stars of the Eastern Market Enclosure (天市垣列宿星君),
The Divine Sovereign of the Heavenly Scorpius Palace (天蝎宫尊神),
The *Mǎo* Palace’s Song Division Stars (卯宫宋分列宿星君),
The Supreme Great God of the East, Boundless Primordial (无极无量品至真大神),
The Flying Celestial King, Longevity Saint of Infinite Salvation (飞天神王长生大圣无量度人君),
The Eastern Hua Sovereign of Command (东华司命真君),
The Auspicious Sovereign of the Year’s Destiny and the Longevity Horse (本命太岁禄马尊神),
and all the responsive spirits (一切真灵) of the ritual platform.

The subject beseeches the efficacy of the scriptures and their vows
to pacify and stabilize the Eastern realm of the Great Fire (甲乙大火),
ensuring the nation’s prosperity is secured,
and the celestial foundation (天根) remains steadfast.

The subject humbly prays that the Jade Script descends its radiance,
And the Pearl Constellation follows the harmonious order.

The Eastern Hua Sovereign, Master of Calculations,
Bestows upon the Woodly Sage years of unaging life;
The Woodly Virtue brings flourishing prosperity,
And the Eastern Dipper inscribes the character of eternal life.

May auspicious omens descend in abundance,
And blessings extend endlessly without bound.

With bowed head, the subject takes refuge and swiftly recites hymns of praise.
The *Zhìhuì* Sutra is chanted,
And then the *Hóngdào* Reveres the scripture of the Supreme Primordial of the Mysterious and Ethereal Dao (太上玄虚宗).

With reverence and humility, one attains immortality,
And traverses countless *kāli* aeons.

The towering, boundless virtue of the Great Truth,
Silent and profound, arising from the Unborn.
The celestial landscape constructs an empty framework,
And the Void naturally nurtures its essence.

The sun and moon shine brilliantly,
Bringing eternal peace and endless joy.

The subject, with utmost respect,
Recites the Five-Jewel Scriptures born from the Great Void,
And the celestial harmonies resounding from the Scarlet Effulgence’s *jìá* cycle.

The profound meaning is obscure yet vast,
The intricate verses difficult to fully expound.
Eight-cornered radiance descends,
Refined through the furnace of the *Dòngyáng*;
Nine luminous glories float forth,
Emitted from the *Liúhuǒ*’s ascending brilliance.

This sacred treasure should be guarded in the highest palace,
Not lightly revealed to the common folk below.

The subject, in awe of the lofty commands,
Faithfully crafts the Golden Talisman,
And conducts the grand *Dàxiān* fast for several days and nights,
Now leading the gathered officials in the second recitation,
Turning the scripture *Dàshàng Dòngxuán Língbǎo Wúliàngdù Rén Shàngpǐn Miàojīng*,
Offering obeisance to the Precious Edict,
And relying upon the Boundless Three Treasures of Infinite Compassion,
The Ten Directions’ Celestial Saints,
Their merciful vows and the efficacy of the scriptures.

The subject humbly prays for this Dao to be illuminated,
And for wisdom to awaken within.

Thus, the *Yúnjǐ* may unfold its teachings,
As if the Celestial Truth itself descended to bestow them.

The Golden Truth resounds in harmony,
Ascending to the Three Pure Heavens;
The Jade Chapter reveals the Mysterious,
And expounds the wonders of the Ten Hua.

All who hear the *fàn* language,
Shall attain extraordinary merit.

With bowed head, the subject venerates the Void Sovereign,
And practices the sacred scriptural laws.

The ritual platform is set, and hymns are intoned—
The scripture recitation is now complete.

**解座吟 回向**

With reverence, the subject now declares the return-offering:

Earth engenders Fire, Fire the essence of supreme Yang;
The two *Liáng* form the *Lí* hexagram—
Lí, the trigram of the South, pure and luminous.
Doubled in clarity, it adorns the Central Axis,
So that all under Heaven may behold its radiant virtue.

Since the Celestial Sage first expounded the Dao and its teachings,
The grand design of the *Huángjí* has unfolded in majesty.
The lofty Dao is vast, its name beyond measure.

The subject, having led the officials in recitation,
Ascended the platform to chant the *Second Pervasion* of the
*Supreme Dao’s Mysterious Treasure Scripture of Boundless Salvation for All Beings*,
Now directs the return-offering to:
The **Southern Void Supreme Treasure Sovereign**,
The **Southern Longevity Extending Fate Sovereign**,
The **Southern Great Elixir Three-Qi Celestial Lord**,
The **Southern Dipper’s Upper-Generating Lord**,
The **Red Sovereign of Nourishing Qi**,
The **Southern Taiwei Enclosure Imperial Seat Star Lord**,
The **Southern Fire Virtue Danhe Red Emperor’s Supreme True Dao Lord**,
The **Mars Star Lord**,
The **Willow Star Heavenly Kitchen Star Lord**,
The **Star Host Heavenly Treasury Star Lord**,
The **Zhang Constellation Heavenly Scales Star Lord**,
The **Noon Palace’s Circulating Star Hosted Deities**,
The **Lion Constellation Deity**,
The **Southern Void Boundless Rank Supreme True God**,
The **Flying Celestial King Long-Life Great Sage of Boundless Salvation**,
The **Southern Pole Record Bureau True Lord**,
The **Native Year’s Grand Duke and Auspicious Horse Deity**,
And all responsive spirits of the ritual hall.

By the merit and power of the scripture,
May the South’s *Bing-Ding* Fire sequence be steadied and pacified.
May the nation’s destiny be secured,
The Celestial Root preserved,
Fortune invited, omens blessed,
Longevity ensured, and life sustained.

The **Mars Star Lord**,
The **Willow Star Heavenly Kitchen Star Lord**,
The **Star Host Heavenly Treasury Star Lord**,
The **Zhang Constellation Heavenly Scales Star Lord**,
The **Noon Palace’s Circulating Star Hosted Deities**,
The **Lion Constellation Deity**,
The **Southern Void Boundless Rank Supreme True God**,
The **Flying Celestial King Long-Life Great Sage of Boundless Salvation**,
The **Southern Pole Record Bureau True Lord**,
The **Native Year’s Grand Duke and Auspicious Horse Deity**,
And all responsive spirits of the ritual hall.

I humbly pray that the **Red Scriptures** may illuminate my fate,
And the **Yellow Dao** proceed in its proper course.
May the **Southern Dipper** ascend and bring blessings of longevity and contentment,
And the **Eastern Hua** bestow fortune, granting peace and tranquility.
May the people flourish in the customs of ritual and music,
And the nation uphold the governance of cultural refinement.

I prostrate myself in reverence and take refuge,
Then recite hymns in rotation.

**Hymn of Wisdom and Benevolence:**
*"Learn to abandon worldly attachments through Daoist cultivation,
Each thought building upon the last, accumulating without end.
Disturbing spirits come and go, agitating my mind;
No disturbance does not pass—my spirit is restless.
To extinguish thoughts and still the void,
I enter the boundless silence of emptiness.
I seek the scripture as one parched and famished,
And hold fast to my resolve like iron and stone.
May the Five Spirits guide me on the path of celestial ascent,
And the sacred talismans ensure my passage across the heavens.*

*In reverence to the South’s **Bing-Ding Fire** sequence,*
I solemnly proclaim the **Sacred Offerings of Devotion**,
And open the scriptures in threefold rotation.
I humbly confess that my **spiritual diagrams** remain unmanifest,
And the **True Scriptures** lie concealed within the **Eternal Auspicious**;
The **Dao** must now be practiced,
And the **Star Lord of the Way** descend to the **Jade Realm**.

Thus, the **Primordial Emperor of the Beginning** grants me the **Wondrous Celestial Scriptures**,
And I am entrusted to dwell in the **Upper Pure Purple Cloud Palace**.
The **Master of Fate** holds the **Divine Treasure of the Perfected Dao**,
And teaches the **Boundless Supreme True Scripture** of the highest rank.
This single volume of the **Divine Treasure of the Perfected Dao**,
Though its profound meaning is subtle and its words mysterious,
Is the **ancestor of all scriptures in the Spirit Tower**.

Majestic and vast is the **Great Dharma**,
Its details intricate and difficult to fathom.
Now I lead the assembled officials,
Ascending the platform for the third rotation to recite the
*Supreme Scripture of the Perfected Dao’s Divine Treasure of Boundless Salvation*,
Offering homage to the **Sacred Edicts**,
And taking refuge in the **Incomparable Triple Jewel** and the **Sages of the Ten Directions**.
By the **mercy and compassionate power** of the scriptures,
I pledge to uphold their efficacy.

I humbly pray that the **Golden True** may accept my summons,
And the **Jade Maiden** open the sacred scrolls.
All shall be verified in the **secret texts**,
And contribute to the **grand expansion of the Ultimate Dao**.
From the finest dust to the grandest sands,
All shall attain enlightenment.
The **sacred sounds** descend to earth,
And harmonize with the **celestial scriptures** above,
Together manifesting the **wondrous transformation**.
I prostrate myself before the **Void Emperor**,
And practice the **scriptural methods**.

**Hymn of the Ritual Seat:**
*"The recitation of the scripture is complete."*

**Hymn of the Ritual Seat Dissolution and Dedication:**

*"Dedication to the West:*
With reverence, I follow the **Celestial Sage’s** teachings,
Unlocking the gates of myriad mysteries.
The **Primordial Origin** hangs the pearl of wisdom,
Drawing forth the **Sages of the Ten Directions**.

This is the **Incomparable Uppermost Scripture**,
Binding the **Root of Wondrous Existence**.
Its meaning pierces the **Deepest Dao**,
Its efficacy extends to **Unending Benefaction**.
By this, the **nation’s destiny** is steadied,
By this, the **heavenly foundations** are secured.

**Supreme Virtue** defies naming,
**True Mysteries** are unfathomable.
I have now led the **official assembly**,
Ascending the platform to recite the ***Supreme Dao of the Perfected Treasure of the Incomparable Scripture for Deliverance of All Beings (Uppermost Chapter of Wondrous Scripture)***,
Directly dedicating its merit to the **West of the Boundless Supreme Perfected Treasure-Sage**,
The **West of the Eight Trigrams Protective Body Treasure-Sage**,
The **West of the Supreme Primordial Seven Qi Heavenly Lords**,
The **Heavenly Lords of the Western Dipper**,
The **White Emperor Attendant-Spirit Lords**,
The **Yellow Flower Primordial Luminous Essence of the Moon Palace (Great Yin Empress of the Dark)***,
The **Celestial Enclosure Emperor-Sage Star Lords**,
The **Golden Virtue Supreme Primordial Minor Yin White Emperor (Uppermost True Dao Lord)***,
The **Great White Star Lords**,
The **Stomach Mansion (Heavenly Granary) Star Lords**,
The **Pleiades (Heavenly Yet) Star Lords**,
The **Hyades (Heavenly Ear) Star Lords**,
The **Capricorn Mansion (Zhao Division) Star Lords**,
The **Revered Gods of the Golden Bull Mansion**,
And the **Boundless Supreme Great God of the West of the Boundless**.

The **Flying Heavenly Kings**, **Long-Life Great Sages** of the Incomparable Deliverance,
The **Western Spirit Officials of the True Sovereign**,
The **Lords of the Primordial Year and Auspicious Horse**—
All divine spirits who respond to this **fasting platform**,
I beseech with the **merit and vow-power** of this scripture,
To stabilize the **West of the Regal Pillar (Geng-Xin)***,
And to gather **auspicious blessings**, extending **longevity and peace**,
Ensuring the **revered security of the ancestral altars**.

May all beings rejoice in this merit,
And return again to pay homage.
With **jade characters and golden inscriptions**,
I record **virtuous names** in the **Western Dipper**;
With **pearl stars and jade moon**,
I display **auspicious hues** in the **Central Heaven**.
May **eternal felicity and great peace** prevail,
All attaining **serene stillness**.

With prostration, I return to refuge,
And swiftly proceed with **praise and hymns**.
**Hymn of Intelligence and Auspicious Grace.**"

「Assist me in the Six Perfections of **Daoic practice**,
Thus may I break free from the Three **Nether Realms***.
With fasting and rites to the **Supreme Uncarved**,
Breathing and nurturing the **Cloud Seed** of **qi**,
I wander within the **Golden Gate** of the **Celestial Palace**,
And the **Jade Capital** becomes my home.

Naturally, I birth the **Seven Treasures**,
And each being rests upon a **lotus***.
With **Heavenly Mysteries** as my upper feast,
And **Void Melon** as my lower delight,
My countenance shines brighter than ten suns,
What need have I of reckoning years or **aeons**?

The **Dharma Drum** gathers all **Celestial Spirits**,
And the **auspicious bell** summons the **Great Demon***.
Now, in the **Fourth Recitation** of the **West**,
I reverently proclaim the **Sacred Edicts** of **Gongwen***,
And the **Fourfold Opening** of the **Scripture Text**,
With **Five Aeons** of merit and vow-power,
Unifying **One Breath** to return to the **Origin**.

The myriad stars bow to the **Polar Star**,
Above, they array the **Heavenly Netherworlds** in ten thousand forms;
The **Six Heavens** span the **Northern Dao**,
Below, they govern all **demons and spirits**.

Only the **Original Chapter of the Numinous Treasure**,
Is the **Essential Dao** of the **Upper Clarity***.
To command the **Celestial Governance**,
Then the sun and moon halt their course,
And the **Celestial Globe** ceases its motion*;
To sternly subdue the **Northern Netherworlds**,
Then the **demonic essences** lose their courage,
And the **ghostly fiends** perish utterly.

Thus, the **Scripture** is revealed to save the world,
And to preserve the **Celestial Longevity**.
Those who practice it attain the **Dao** and ascend as **Immortal**,
Riding the clouds to roam the **Four Seas**;
Those who uphold it remain in mortal form,
Yet rule eternally and govern the **Ten Thousand Years**.

Now, I humbly follow the **Imperial Edict**,
And earnestly cultivate the **Golden Talisman**,
Extending **longevity and peace** through this grand **fasting** of many days and nights.

I lead my **official retinue**,
Ascending the **fasting platform** for the **Fourth Recitation**,
To recite the ****Supreme Uncarved Numinous Treasure Scripture of Infinite Salvation**,
Offering homage to the **Sacred Edicts**,
And in reverence, taking refuge in the **Supreme Triple Jewel**—
The **Merciful Sovereign** of the **Ten Directions**,
The **Great Saints** of all **Heavens**,
And their **compassionate merit and vow-power**—
To uphold the **Scripture’s efficacy**.

May the **Supreme Truth** mark this with divine pen,
And the **Spiritual Consorts** attend at the **Sacred Portal**.
Shine forth **jade characters** in the **Great Void**,
And weave **conch pearl texts** into the **Hidden Canon***.
Resound the **mystic drum** and **sacred clarion**,
With **hidden melodies** clear and resonant;
Swell the **Daoic Ocean’s waves**,
And let **mystic grace** flow boundless.

Move the **flying and submerged**,
Stir the **plants and growths**—
All owe their **birth and flourishing** to this.

With prostration to the **Celestial Sovereign**,
I practice the **Scripture’s method**.
Now I **recite seated**,
And having finished the **Scripture’s chanting**,
I **lay down my seat** and conclude.

「解座吟 回向
臣恭以说经四徧，玄玄之妙义宏深；
称庆诸天，渺渺之空歌流响。

臣适来引领官众，升坛转诵《太上洞玄灵宝无量度人上品妙经》第四徧，

稽首归依，旋行赞咏。

**智惠颂**
灵风扇奇花，灿烂开繁衿；
紫烟郁重秀，众仙弹玉琴。
雅歌三天上，散惠玉华林；
七祖升福堂，由此步玄音。
前世德未足，斯书邈难寻；
信道情不尽，图飞乃反沈。
太上无为**Dao**，弘之在兆心。
高功於北方恭文，宣表关焚化。」

**Threefold Hearing of the Sutra**
After hearing the sutra, may I wish all beings
to have their ten thousand offenses forever extinguished,
and their virtuous seeds to flourish and grow.

After hearing the sutra, may I wish all beings
to enter deeply into the Dharma-gate,
and take refuge in faith and acceptance.

After hearing the sutra, may I wish all beings
to forever sever attachment to delusion,
and always abide in the true and pure teaching.

**Vows**
Reignite the censer,
descend from the altar,
offer thanks to the Master,
and dedicate merit.

With the Golden Talisman, tenfold liberation for beings—
early morning rites of opening and closing,
the ritual now complete.
