**The Veritable Records of the Illustrious and Benevolent True Lords of Vast Grace**

**Imperially Composed Stele Inscription for the Sacred Luminous Aid Palace**

We reflect that since ancient times, the eminent and worthy, while living, have served as illustrious ministers, their merits shading the people; in death, they become luminous spirits, aiding the transformations of Heaven and Earth. Their stirring and flowing presence moves between the two realms, shielding the people with blessings, warding off calamities, and repelling misfortune. They revive the withered and quicken the living, their radiance vast and boundless—ever above, ever beside—beyond the reach of human wit or conjecture.

As the *Book of Songs* says:
*"The advent of the spirits—unfathomable,
how could one dare slight them?"*
This is precisely what it means.

Consider the Great Immortal of the Golden Towers of the Nine Heavens, the Illustrious Dao-Attaining and Virtue-Manifesting, the Vastly Aiding and Universally Beneficent True Person, the Jiang King; and the Supreme Immortal of the Jade Towers of the Nine Heavens, the Proclaiming Transformation and Upholding Teachings, the Luminously Manifest and Broadly Beneficent True Person, the Rao King. Their virtue and power overflow, truly as described. Descendants of the Southern Tang, they rendered meritorious service to the people in life and, in death, were enrolled among the ranks of immortals. As elder and younger brothers, their excellence is matched, their glory intertwined. Entrusted with offices in the heavens, their numinous presence descends to the earth, their breath evoking swift responses—swift as lightning, fleet as the wind. The people shelter beneath them, relying on them as parents. Their compassion and benevolence bring peace to all things.

Recently, when We fell ill and employed every remedy, yet found no relief, the spirits silently mobilized their essence and power, guarding and protecting Us. Never for a moment did they depart; every prayer was met with an answer. Repeatedly, they manifested clear signs, bestowing divine talismans and celestial medicines. Through their aid, what was perilous was restored to safety, what had fallen was raised again. Their power to revive life is vast and boundless in grace.

We, of shallow virtue, know not how We have merited such favor. The debt to their power lingers in Our heart—how could it ever be forgotten? Deep as the sea, towering as the mountains, it knows no end. That one must requite merit is an enduring principle of the state. Thus, We issue this proclamation, conferring upon them exalted titles:

The elder shall be called:
**True Lord of Vast Grace, Protector of the State and Shelter of the People, the Pure and Subtle, Cavernous and Mysterious, Void and Wondrously Responsive, Compassionate and Benevolent;**

The younger shall be called:
**True Lord of Vast Grace, Guardian of the State and Helper of the People, the Lofty and Illustrious, Vast and Tranquil, Void and Profound, Wondrously Responsive, Benevolent and Kind.**

Their former titles remain unchanged.

We have newly expanded their temple halls, making them bright and spacious, worthy of the spirits’ dwelling. We command the relevant officials to maintain reverent purity in their offerings, to perform seasonal sacrifices in spring and autumn, to renew their robes with the changing year, and to appoint five households for sweeping and upkeep. Thus do We express Our sincerity and seek blessings, repaying the spirits’ boundless favor.

Yet though the spirits’ merit is profound, Our recompense is meager. The spirits, of course, do not demand repayment—but in Our heart, the debt cannot be set aside.

The virtue of Heaven and Earth is life; the spirits embody the Dao of Heaven and Earth, assisting and illuminating the workings of transformation. Emerging from darkness into light, their presence expands and contracts in an instant. They roam the Great Purity, overseeing the four directions, aiding and benefiting all living beings. Their merit spans Heaven and Earth—so luminous, yet beyond all naming or description.

Thus do We make their achievements manifest, inscribing them upon enduring stone, erecting it in their temple to be transmitted for endless generations. We append this poem:

Heaven bore these heroic spirits, paragons of the age,
Moving between darkness and light as one.
In life, their meritorious toil secured the land;
In death, as luminous spirits, their glory stands sublime.

Vast the southern seas, beneath their sheltering shade,
Rain and shine, cold and heat, all are tempered and made right.
No winter’s biting frost, no summer’s scorching heat,
The miasmic vapors of the sands are stilled, no gales take flight.

Year after year, the millet ripens high,
Banishing ill omens, driving evil spirits away.
Morning bells and evening drums gladden the aged,
Majestic Ao Peak, steep and towering, holds sway.

Winding and embracing, wrought by Heaven’s hand,
Spring orchids offer fragrance, autumn chrysanthemums their scent.
Cold springs and white stones, pure and clear,
The spirits roam with feathered canopies grand.

Fleeting clouds drift, guiding banners and staffs,
Swift they come, swift they go, their presence light.
Breath and response, swift as verse,
Their aid and benefit boundless, ceaseless day and night.

Four seasons’ offerings, rich and plentiful,
Their merit in guarding Us—who can compare?
We vow to engrave it upon heart and bone,
Inscribing their grace and virtue on steadfast stone.

Let it stand for ten thousand ages, radiant as sun and moon.

In the fifteenth year of the Yongle reign, on the first day of the fifth month, *The Transmission of the Two Perfected Ones’ Ascension to Immortality*:

Xu Zhizheng descended from the lineage of King Yan of Xu. A man of Southern Tang during the Five Dynasties period, he and his younger brother Zhie were both of unparalleled heroism and brilliance. Benevolent and compassionate toward all things, loyal to their lord and filial to their parents, they revered the Three Treasures, shared a devotion to goodness, and diligently cultivated the supreme Dao. They performed purification rites and offered jiao sacrifices, daily reciting the *True Scripture of the Jade Emperor* and chanting the sacred names.

Both brothers served the state of Wu. Later, Zhizheng was enfeoffed as the Prince of Jiang, and Zhie as the Prince of Rao. Stationed in Jinling, they maintained vigilant defenses in war and governance, pacifying refugees and securing the allegiance of over twenty prefectures. The people were relieved of burdens, the army well-provisioned, and the tribes of the forests and caves adhered to the laws. The young and old rejoiced together, singing hand in hand. No grievances arose above, no enmities below. The people of Jiangnan relied entirely upon them for peace.

Later, when ordered to lead troops against Min, fearing the suffering of the innocent, they made a solemn vow: every fifth watch, they faced north to worship the Dipper; their morning meals were always vegetarian. They prayed for the cessation of war, and wherever they went, they labored to comfort the people. The prefectures and counties, seeing their approach, surrendered their cities. Elders offered baskets of food and jars of wine, crowding the roads to welcome them.

Upon reaching Xiajiang, several hundred deserters had taken refuge in the mountains to rebel. They immediately ordered the execution of the ringleaders. The remaining soldiers cast aside their armor, cheering and dancing, and were pacified without battle. The people lived in peace, their fields, gardens, and crops untouched. They conferred among themselves, saying, “These are the parents who have given us new life.” They erected a shrine on Ao Peak to worship them.

Before long, the brothers ascended to immortality in succession. They became the Superintendents of the Central Waters of the Dipper, entering and leaving the celestial palaces. Through accumulated merit and hidden aid to the people, they ensured that all fulfilled their duties of loyalty and filial piety and revered the Three Treasures.

In times of drought, when the people prayed at their shrine, the deep, unfathomable pool before it would suddenly yield a divine serpent, coiling upon the altar table, its color like cinnabar. It would rise from the pool’s surface, remaining all day before withdrawing. The next dawn, rain would fall, and the year would yield a bountiful harvest.

One day, the torrential rains of Yanxi swelled violently, submerging fields and crops. The people, panic-stricken, suddenly beheld thousands of laborers wielding baskets and shovels, dredging the sources and diverting the flows. The waters ceased to harm the people, and the laborers vanished—these were divine soldiers.

The rapids of Cangxia were treacherous, and boats ascending or descending often lost control. When boatmen cried out in prayer, they perceived a faint yellow banner in the clouds, and the peril immediately subsided.

Whenever households were careless with fire or locusts threatened the crops, the people invoked their aid, and the winds would shift to extinguish the flames or drive the locusts away. They also distributed talismans and medicines to the people. Those afflicted with illness who consumed them recovered immediately, and those who sought offspring found their descendants flourishing.

Thus, the people lived in peace, the land prospered, and the countryside remained tranquil.

Liu Yi of Min, serving as governor of Guizhou and Jiaozhi, faced barbarian rebels invading the border and seizing Qin and Lian prefectures. Overwhelmed with fear, he fasted and prayed in silence, and the rebels indeed dispersed.

Later, when Han Shizhong fought at Dayi Garrison and Wu Jie at Heshang Plain, the brothers dispatched divine soldiers to defend the nation, manifesting the numinous power of the grasses and trees of Mount Bagong. From afar, the enemy saw banners and standards fluttering, a million iron-clad cavalry filling the valleys, their formations disciplined, the sound of gongs and drums shaking the plains. Before battle was joined, the enemy had already fled in defeat.

Their divine traces and wondrous deeds are too numerous to recount in full.

One day, during the offering of the Yellow Register Fast, celestial music suddenly resounded in the sky, auspicious clouds encircled the distance, and an entourage of immortals appeared in magnificent array. Moved by their devotion, the Heavenly Emperor dispatched a divine messenger to proclaim the edict:

The Prince of Jiang was enfeoffed as the *Great Immortal of the Nine Heavens’ Golden Gate, Illuminator of the Dao, Attainer of Virtue, Manifestly Numinous and Universally Beneficent Perfected One*, charged with overseeing the Celestial Bureau of Astronomy, empowered to act at his discretion, and to correspond with the Ministry of Literature and the Celestial Office of Mysteries.

His wife, Lady Xu, the Princess of Jing, was enfeoffed as the *Immortal Maiden of Benevolence and Kindness, Assistant to the Dao*, concurrently overseeing the Right Bureau of Longevity of the Great Unity.

The Prince of Rao was enfeoffed as the *Supreme Immortal of the Nine Heavens’ Jade Gate, Propagator of Transformation and Protector of the Teachings, Illustriously Numinous and Vastly Beneficent Perfected One*, charged with overseeing all bureaus of the Lower Realm’s Earthly Prison, empowered to act at his discretion, and to correspond with the Ministry of Longevity of the Southern Culmen and the Celestial Office of Thunder and Mystery.

His wife, Lady Tao, the Princess of Wei, was enfeoffed as the *Immortal Maiden of Compassion and Grace, Assistant to the Dao*, concurrently overseeing the Northern Bureau of Life Registration of the Primordial Emperor.

Their father was enfeoffed as the *Perfected One of Loyal Valor*, and their mother as the *Immortal Consort of Benevolent Longevity*.

Recently, when We fell gravely ill, through the silent operation of their transformative power, they manifested great numinous favor, guarding Us at every moment. They bestowed divine talismans and celestial medicines, and with every invocation, efficacy followed instantly, their responses as swift as an echo. Our debilitated body, once in peril, was restored to health; our chronic ailments were entirely dispelled, returning Us to Our former state. Their power to turn the tide was as if granting Us new life. The grace of the spirits is engraved in Our heart, never to be forgotten.

Thus, by this decree of invocation, We confer upon the elder brother the title of *Perfected Lord of Vast Grace, Protector of the State and Shelterer of the People, of the Pure Subtlety, Cavernous Mystery, Tranquil Emptiness, and Wondrous Response*—the *True Lord of Overflowing Kindness*; upon the Lady of Jing State, the additional title of *Perfected Consort of Steadfast Response*; upon the second brother, the title of *Perfected Lord of Lofty Brilliance, Vast Serenity, Profound Stillness, and Wondrous Response, of Benevolent Kindness, Assistant to the State and Guardian of the People*—the *True Lord of Overflowing Grace*; upon the Lady of Wei State, the additional title of *Perfected Consort of Reverent Stillness*. Their divine father is hereby titled *Perfected Lord of Illustrious Support*, and their divine mother *Perfected Consort of Refined Goodness*. All former designations shall remain as before.

New temples shall be erected in the lands of Min, and a traveling shrine shall be established in the capital to provide a dwelling for the spirits. Let the relevant offices be commanded to reverently conduct the sacrifices.

For those ministers whose merit extends to the altars of state and whose beneficence spreads over the people, they must become heroes in life and luminous spirits in death. Even a hundred generations hence, they shall bless the living and subtly assist the transforming influence of the throne. Consider Zhi Zheng and Zhi E: born of noble lineage, they served their lord in a declining age, yet were able to pacify turmoil in a region and preserve its people. When they marched into Min, they entered the land with banners furled, first eliminating the rebel troops, delivering the people from the horrors of war, and placing them in the safety of their own homes. Thus, the hearts of the people were moved with gratitude, unable to fully repay their debt, and so they erected living shrines to honor them. After their ascension as immortals, they warded off great disasters and defended against grave perils, sparing the people from the fears of famine and pestilence, granting them the joy of rest and renewal. Their merit complete and conduct fulfilled, they moved the heart of Heaven, which bestowed upon them the title of *Perfected One* and ranked them among the celestial immortals.

Recently, through the silent operation of their transformative power, they have manifested great numinous favor, healing Our afflictions. Thus, We now augment their honorific titles, renew their temples, and reverently offer sacrifices to requite their divine grace. All this is the result of their accumulated hidden merits, and so their glory shines eternally, enduring as long as Heaven and Earth. How could this be mere chance?

The odes declare:
*To serve one’s parents with utmost filiality, one’s lord with loyalty—*
*Who can match the fragrant blossoms of this illustrious pair?*
*With diligence, they cultivated the supreme Dao,*
*And were enfeoffed with lands by royal decree.*

And again:
*In those years, they stationed their troops at Jinling,*
*And the vast lands south of the river knew no war.*
*When their army entered the seven Min lands, the people lived in peace,*
*How much blessing and grace did they bestow upon the living!*

And again:
*In drought, the sacred pool brought forth the coiled dragon,*
*And great rains poured forth, ensuring a bountiful year.*
*The waters of Yan Brook receded, sparing the people from harm,*
*While the perilous gorges of Cangxia became passable for ships.*

And again:
*Locusts did not harm the crops, nor fire pass beyond its bounds,*
*The fields and wilds alike were blanketed in their abundant grace.*
*They distributed divine talismans to multiply descendants,*
*And cured grave illnesses, restoring the stricken to health.*

And again:
*In Gui Prefecture, they displayed their power to repel the barbarian raiders,*
*Working wonders as at the Eight Lords’ Mountain.*
*A million divine soldiers filled the valleys,*
*And in an instant, the siege was lifted.*

And again:
*Divine talismans and wondrous medicines issued from the Celestial Physicians,*
*Guarding Our humble person without a moment’s absence.*
*Their power to heal is beyond repayment,*
*Yet the gratitude for this new life is known in Our heart.*

And again:
*Responding to every invocation without delay,*
*Their transformative power aligns with the workings of creation.*
*Riding the qi and mounting the wind, they roam the eight directions,*
*Descending from the celestial palaces to manifest their numinous might.*

And again:
*In life, they were famed generals, achieving great merit,*
*Their conduct fulfilled, they ascended as immortals—such is the reward of virtue.*
*In the capital’s Ao Peak, their temple shall forever receive offerings,*
*As their names, inscribed in cinnabar, attest to their celestial perfection.*

And again:
*Their majestic power, resplendent and boundless,*
*Shines ever brighter in their protection of the state and peace for the people.*
*Not only is their fame as bright as the sun and moon,*
*But it shall endure as long as Heaven and Earth.*

*Memorial for the Conferral of Titles upon the Perfected Lords*

Memorial from Your Servant Wang, Attendant of the Golden Portal, Practitioner of the Ninefold Numinous Flying Steps, and Controller of Thunder and Lightning:

I humbly submit that the Dao resides in the beginningless boundlessness, profound and obscure, beyond recognition or knowledge, unattainable by the reckonings of heart or mind. Only after the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign inscribed the sacred texts with his purple brush did those who study the Dao gain the means to fathom its source and channel its flow, compiling its statutes and numinous writings.

In this age, there exists a divine being who cultivates merit through fasting and precepts, vows to deliver the dead and save the living, and composes texts that align with the sacred statutes. All who are of exceptional talent and refined character recite them with one voice—surely their merit is manifest and their renown resounds.

I have observed the Nine Heavens’ Golden Portal Perfected Xu Zhizheng and the Nine Heavens’ Jade Portal Perfected Xu Zhie, whose names crown the age and whose virtue abides among the people. Examining their conduct within and their deeds without, they are indeed those whose very bones align with immortality, whose hearts accumulate goodness and build merit, and who steadfastly cherish the Three Treasures. If not for those blessed by karmic destiny who exhaust the divine to comprehend transformation, who could achieve such? Their works include the *Ninefold Perfected Wondrous Precepts of Transformative Texts*, the *Nine Marchmounts’ Spirit Lamps Statutes*, and the *Three Realms’ Protective Horse Statutes*—all derived from the Supreme’s mysterious words, delving into subtleties and extracting truth, naturally forming chapters of numinous resonance. These may serve as a bridge across the vast kalpas, for those who "build carts behind closed doors" reckon not the passage of years.

Beyond these, there are the *Numinous Aid Ritual Statutes*, the *Original Vow Ritual Texts*, and the *Seven Governors’ Lamp Statutes*—composed not out of presumption of personal merit, but in response to the people’s entreaties.

My nature is crude and my understanding shallow; my words are of little weight. Yet, having examined their deeds and assessed their abilities, I petition to supplement their duties and elevate their immortal ranks. I now beseech Your Sagely Compassion to approve this memorial and promulgate the statutes compiled by Xu Zhizheng and others across the Three Realms, where all may adhere to and implement them accordingly. This will not only manifest the boundless merit of numinous aid but also strengthen our ranks and fulfill the people’s hopes.

I prostrate myself in await of Your decree.
