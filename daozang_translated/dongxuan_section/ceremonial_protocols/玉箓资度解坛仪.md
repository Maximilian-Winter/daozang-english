**Jade Register Ritual for Deliverance and Dismantling the Altar**
The ritual proceeds according to form.
All bow to the master, contemplating as prescribed.

**Invocation of the Divine Incantation:**
The Five Numinous Ones array their positions, resplendent in guarding the five directions.
The First Sovereign shields the soul; the Cinnabar Elder protects the form.
The Radiant Spirit attends the po; the Dark Emperor sustains life.
The Yellow Emperor of the Center governs the myriad perfected.
The Primordial August One issues the decree, illuminating the dark night with light.
Sins dissolve in the Northern Bureau; names are inscribed in the Southern Prosperity.
The Golden Register fixes the ledger; the Jade Script dispels calamity.
The Scarlet Mound refines the substance; the spirit soars to the Great Granary.
The Three Officials and Nine Bureaus, the boundless divine realm—
All universally receive deliverance, ascending to the celestial halls.
Harmony unites with the Dao, merging with the true.

**Strike the ritual drum twenty-four times.**

O Most High Three Heavens, Mysterious Primordial Three *Qi* of the Supreme Dao Lord,
O Most High Lord Lao, summon forth from within this servant’s body:
The Three and Five Merit Officers,
The Left and Right Attendant Messengers,
The Left and Right Fragrant-Bearing Dragon-Riding Couriers,
The Golden Lads Attending Incense,
The Jade Maidens Scattering Flowers,
The Five Thearchs’ Direct Talismans and Daily Incense Officials—
thirty-six each.
Let them emerge, adorned in solemn vestments, crowned and sashed with hanging tassels.
Summon the local earth deities and territorial spirits of the numinous altar.
This servant now dismantles the altar and declares the merit, burning incense and offering repentance.
Reverently, I submit this petition for the intentions of the present retreat, already recorded and reported.
May the luminous *qi* of the Most High Perfected Dao and the radiant light of the Numinous Treasure descend,
flowing into the bodies of this servant and all present,
so that the sincerity of this servant’s invocation swiftly reaches the presence of the Perfected, Boundless, and Supreme Dao—
the Three Clarities, the August Heavenly Golden Portal Jade Emperor,
and the Eastern Ultimate Compassionate Honored One, the Azure Mystery Emperor—
before the Dao.

**Recite the dharma titles:**
This humble servant, [Name] and company, now burn incense,
devoting body, spirit, and life to the Most High Compassionate Honored One, Savior of the Ten Directions.

This servant has heard:
The Three Registers transmit the statutes; the Five Chapters establish the model.
The majestic Dao’s intent is magnified; the profound wind is grandly propagated.
Modeling heaven and earth, the altar rites were first established;
summoning yin and calling yang, cloud-script is stabilized and pacified.
A thousand perfected descend in chariots; ten thousand sages attend the audience hall.
The retreat’s vows ascend to the layered heavens; the true chariots descend to the dharma seat.
To aid [Name]’s spirit, ascend to the celestial palace, and verify rank upon the immortal steps.
Now, as the vows are fulfilled and the morning rites conclude,
the altar is dismantled, the assembly dispersed.
First, faults are confessed, merits declared,
offerings made in hope of vast grace,
and reverence paid to the ancestral altars.
Golden dragons rise in script; the jiao rites’ blessings reach perfection.
Jade wefts stream with light, bestowing boundless blessings upon the glorious fortune.
May the numinous response of this invocation swiftly ascend to the presence of the Perfected, Boundless, and Supreme Dao.

**At the sound of the chime, rise and offer reverent praise.**

**Chant the Ten Directions’ Titles.**
Bow, touch the ground, and kneel in prolonged reverence, repenting with utmost sincerity.

This assembly of ritualists, with devoted hearts,
devotes body, spirit, and life to the Compassionate Honored One, Savior of the Ten Directions.
Reverently, we gaze upon your vast compassion,
hoping for the outpouring of great blessings and the universal bestowal of boundless grace.
Now, as the altar is dismantled and the assembly dispersed,
we burn incense and offer repentance.

This servant has heard:
The Three Heavens spread their blessings, the numinous light extending the kindness of nurturing transformation;
the Nine Lands receive grace, the ancestral *qi* conveying the power of spiritual transmigration.
Bearing the imperial favor’s radiant reflection,
we are fortunate that the retreat’s dharma has come full circle.
Humbly, we exhaust our sincere hearts, looking up to the vast creation.

Yet again, we reflect:
Our spirits are entangled in the mundane; our bearing gathers dust.
The jade laws revolve in splendor, sternly recording the Three Primes’ judgments;
the golden statutes are intricate, rigorously enforcing the Four Poles’ regulations.
We can only hope for your magnanimous forbearance, your reverent bestowal of nurturing care.
May the numinous light be cultivated across the nine paths, vowing to propagate the profound tradition;
may the dharma rain flow through the three destinies, wishing to exalt the sagely creation.

This assembly, with devoted hearts, bows and prostrates,
offering thanks to the Most High Perfected Three Treasures.

**Three invocations.**
**Three bows.**

Again invoking the dharma-ranks, we, your humble servants—[Name] and the assembled ritualists at the altar—with unified sincerity, reverently address and supplicate:

The Primordial Celestial Worthy of Numinous Treasure of the Void and Spontaneous Origin, the Most High Dao Lord, the Most High Lord Lao, the Jade Emperor of August Heaven, the Great Emperor of the Purple Tenuity, the Great Emperor of the Northern Culmen of the Purple Tenuity, the August Earth Spirit of the Rear Soil, the Elder Lord of the Eastern Culmen of the Azure Mystery, the August Thearch Who Circulates Brightness and Preserves the Origin, the Celestial Worthy of Great Compassion Who Saves from Suffering, the Celestial Worthy Who Delivers from the Nine Hells of Sin, the Manifested and Transformed Celestial Worthies of the Ten Directions Who Save from Suffering, the Most Compassionate and Greatly Merciful Perfected of Salvation, the Perfected of Great Kindness, the Perfected Who Registers Births, the Perfected of the Fragrant Grove Assembly Who Releases from Dharma-Bonds, the Tenfold Radiant Perfected, the Universally Saving Perfected, the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures, the Great Dharma-Masters of the Mysterious Center, the Great Dharma-Masters of the Three Heavens, and all numinous powers responsive to the ritual altar’s descent—

We, mere motes of dust and humble mayflies, bear the blessings bestowed by the Nine Celestial Thrones and stand at the radiant unfolding of the Three Caverns.

Clad in golden talismans, our names inscribed in jade registers.
Clouds and mist gather the radiance—how could we not lift our aspirations to the pure and void?
Sun and moon course as one, yet we dwell amid the dust of the world.
A hundred transgressions remain unwashed, ten thousand karmic bonds still fetter us.
Recalling the cinnabar sincerity of our Dao-reception, we ever renew our primal vow to succor the age.
May we thus aid in transformation and nurturance, not betraying the gift of life and growth.

Having received the sacred writ, how dare we forget to present our petition?
From this day of the present month, we reverently heed the imperial edict, solemnly conducting the Jade Register Salvation Grand Fast for several days and nights.
We transcribe our words to convey our earnest devotion, invoking the descent of perfected ones and summoning numinous powers.
We unfurl the tenfold resplendent banners of transcendence and kindle the nine-cup ritual torches.
We dissolve obstructions and stagnations, dispelling and extinguishing karmic transgressions.
We deliver and uplift all bearing form, raising them to the luminous realms.
Like sunflowers, our sincerity is laid bare in petition; we bask in the radiance of the Three Realms.
Like wind-borne sacred seals, we open the Nine Hells and command the qi.

Our gratitude is boundless, etched into bone beyond measure.
Now, with the rites completed and felicitous affairs concluded, the fast’s merit is fulfilled.
Heaven and humanity rejoice as one; the hidden and manifest realms exult together.
Feathered canopies flutter as the jade chariot’s retinue prepares to depart;
Tiger banners wreathe in mist as the ranks of the guarded paths are withdrawn.
We humbly submit our merits in accord with the ritual protocols, petitioning for the conferral of rewards as pledged.

We implore the Mysterious Vault’s Most Sagely, the August Ultimate’s Primordial Venerable:
Deign to look upon our earnest supplications and graciously bestow your discerning regard.

On the day of establishing the fast, we invoke the officials of the Three Caverns and the perfected numina of the Nine Heavens to oversee the fast, guard the true, attend the scriptures, and protect the Dao. The void-spanning overseers and the local deities of the earth—all arrayed in vigilant service—secure the merit of the fast with solemn toil and achievement. Thus, before the Mysterious Altar, we present our offerings, aspiring to requite boundless grace with commensurate devotion.

Yet we, in our mindfulness, remain imperfect; our reverence, though earnest, is incomplete. We fear the scrutiny of the Five Emperors and Four Bureaus, lest our myriad transgressions and innumerable faults be fully recorded. We can only hope for the vastness of your compassion, that we may universally receive your forbearance and pardon.

With utmost trepidation and awe, we prostrate ourselves, bowing our heads to the ground, and humbly submit this petition for your attention.

We declare the merit manifest,
offer incense to the memorial,
ignite the ritual pyre,
announce the petition’s passage,
dispatch the returning missives,
and send forth the officials as prescribed.

We solemnly dispatch the Five Visceral Perfected Officials within our body, one minor scribe, and twelve recording assistants, along with the urgently commissioned Merit-Envoys and Flying Dragon Couriers. Adorned in formal vestments, their caps and pendants in perfect array, they grind ink, ready their brushes, gird their swords, and order the registers. They shall, on our behalf, bear this memorial in timely fashion to the courts of the Three Heavens, where they will present and respond to each matter as it arises.

Should there be errors in the text, omissions in the words, or disarray in the sequence, we request that the transmitting scribes, the practiced minor officials, wielding dragon-headed writing knives and long, sharp brushes, correct and amend the faults on the spot. Let no supervising officer find cause for reproach, that the memorial may proceed directly to the presence of the Most High before the Boundless Dao of the Three Heavens, without delay or obstruction.

The left scribes shall pass through the gates in order; the right scribes shall present the petitions in sequence. Thus, may all we have requested descend, all we have summoned arrive, all we have aided be delivered, all we have proclaimed be made known, all we have promoted be advanced, all we have wished be fulfilled, and all we have sought be obtained.

If any subordinate official, through obstructive qi, should intercept or block our memorial from reaching the heavens, let them be seized and delivered to the nearest prison, there to be punished according to the celestial statutes, that the authority of heaven be made manifest.

We now withdraw and prostrate ourselves before the desk, awaiting the response.

The officials are received back as prescribed.

With the rites of sincere devotion now concluded, and from the very inception of the fast, all the Merit-Envoys, Perfected Officials, Immortal Lords, and celestial soldiers dispatched from within our body shall return to us, entering through the Gates of Myriad Mysteries. Those who departed from the left shall return to the left; those from the right, to the right. The Day-Officer of Merit shall resume command and oversight, returning to their original station. Let no confusion arise, that when summoned again, they may arrive as before, in accordance with established precedent.

We offer thanks and repay virtue to the Heavenly Worthy.
We circumambulate once in reverence.

The Master stands in the east, facing west; the assembly stands in the west, facing east, all kneeling.
The precepts are expounded, then received in long kneeling, and the return of the precepts is conducted as prescribed.

We, Your servants, have not yet mastered the Daoist arts—our bearing and movements fail to meet the standards, our advances and retreats violate the regulations, and our conduct does not accord with ritual form. We fear being cited by the Four Administrators, seized by the Five Emperors, and burdened with a thousand transgressions and ten thousand faults. We humbly beg Your mercy and forgiveness. Though our origins remain unenlightened, may we not incur punishment.

At the inception of this fast, we reverently invoked the Ten Precepts of Supreme Wisdom, ascending the fast’s prohibitions to discipline body and mind. Now that the ritual is concluded, we take leave and return them to the Heavenly Palace.

We respectfully submit this report for Your hearing, prostrating ourselves in hope of Your gracious pardon.

With utmost reverence and awe, we bow our heads to the ground, kowtowing twice in submission.

The Return-of-Precepts Hymn is recited; all return to their positions and bow once.
The Three Tablets are proclaimed; the tablets are cast.
At the sounding of the qing-bell, the Five Dragons rise to guard the Heavenly Worthy.

Rising to guard,
we make our vows.
We visualize the deities and offer incense.

May the Incense-Official Envoys, the Lords of the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger, and all the spirit-officials attendant upon the incense ensure that where we have dissolved the altar and dispersed the sacred seat, golden liquid, cinnabar, and azure mushrooms naturally arise. May the hundred numinous Perfected and assembled spirits gather here before the incense burner.

May our virtuous merit be universally abundant, and the blessings of this fast fully realized. May the jade maidens and immortal youths of the ten directions attend the orchid-scented smoke, conveying the sincerity of our supplications swiftly to the Most Perfect and Boundless Dao of the Three Clarities, the Supreme Sages, the Jade Emperor of the Golden Portal of the Vast Heaven, and the Merciful Lord of the Eastern Ultimate and the Azure Mystery before the Dao.

The Dissolution-of-Altar Hymn is recited.
Descending from the altar, we take leave of the Three Treasures.

The light of time swiftly passes, the sun’s shadow gradually shifts.
Incense scatters like jade blossoms, the Dao returns to the Golden Portal.
May the imperial realm endure as earth, the sage’s lifespan stretch as heaven.
With harmonious reverence, we bow and take leave of the Treasures of the Dao in the ten directions.
Golden youths present our merits, jade maidens record our deeds.
Names inscribed on golden tablets, sutras stored in jeweled repositories.
Spirits ascend and attain liberation, households and nations receive grace.
The Sage enters emptiness and non-being, merit suffuses the hidden and manifest.
With harmonious reverence, we bow and take leave of the Treasured Scriptures in the ten directions.
Jade bells cease their chime, jasper chimes fall silent.
The master returns to the Great Clarity, his name inscribed in the Purple Court.
The three paths of suffering end their reckoning, the five torments halt their turning.
With harmonious reverence, we bow and take leave of the Treasured Masters in the ten directions.
May all sentient beings refrain from all evil and practice all virtues.
May they not fall into karmic entanglements but ever dwell in prosperous ages.
May all beings with consciousness together realize non-action.
With harmonious reverence, we bow and take leave of the Sages in the ten directions.
The *Jade Register* Rite for Liberation and Dissolution of the Altar is now complete.
