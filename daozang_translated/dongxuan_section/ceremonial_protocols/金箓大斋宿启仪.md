Summoning forth my servants—those of the Central Three-Five (中三五) Officials, the Left and Right Attendants, the Dragon Messenger’s Escorts, the Golden Boys Attending Incense, the Jade Maidens Scattering Flowers, and the Five Emperors’ Direct Talisman Officials—each in groups of thirty-six.
Those who emerge, in solemn attire and resplendent robes, their crowns and sashes adorned with trailing plumes,
Open the Mysterious Hall and the Local Deities, the Domain’s True Spirits.

Your humble servant now, having kept vigil and declared the fast, establishes the altar and reveals the matter.
With utmost sincerity, I compose this heartfelt petition, carefully inscribed and sealed.

May the Most High’s Supreme Dao/Way’s *qi* of Ultimate Truth and the Sacred Treasure’s Auspicious Light descend,
Flowing into our bodies.
Let my sincere invocation swiftly reach the Ultimate Truth of the Boundless Dao, the Three Pure Ones of Supreme Holiness,
Before the Celestial Jade Emperor of the Boundless Heaven, the August Sovereign on High.

I humbly pray in the name of the Dao/Way’s station—
As one who now burns incense, I dedicate these merits and virtues,
To pray for the perpetuation of the Imperial Domain’s stability,
And the longevity of the Sacred Reign.
May benevolent winds be cultivated, and the era of effortless governance under the Auspicious Arch flourish.
May all be fortified as bulwarks for princes and officials, and for the spirits of land and domain.

We, the Three Teachers and Five Friends, disciples of the Dao across generations,
Those who dwell in valleys and mountain caves, the hosts of our sect,
Down to the Three Armies and the common folk, all peoples of the world—
The sentient beings of earth and sky, both mobile and still, boundless in awareness—
All submit our bodies, our spirits, and our allegiance to the Supreme Dao of the Ten Directions,
The Sacred Treasure of Natural Ultimate Truth, the Boundless Dao.

I humbly beseech forgiveness for the threefold karma and six senses,
For all transgressions and offenses without end,
That we may receive the true teaching and share in profound grace.
May we attain the Dao’s true essence,
Singing praises to the era of peace,
Ascending together to the Age of Virtue and Longevity,
Adrift in effortless ease.
Forever united with the Dao,
My mystical invocation shall echo,
Responding directly before the Supreme Boundless Dao of Ultimate Truth.

**Prostration in reverence, chanting to the Ten Directions.**

「With rites fulfilled, each bows in long prostration,
Devoting body, spirit, and allegiance to the Supreme Boundless Dao of the Ten Directions,
The Sacred Treasure of the Ten Directions, the Heavenly Sovereign of Ultimate Truth.

Reverently we gaze upon the Great Compassion,
Piercingly bestowed as boundless grace,
Broadly descending as vast benevolence.

We have heard that the Primordial *Qi* of the Chaos of Origins
Ever remains in purity and stillness as its essence;
The Golden Tablet’s rites and sacred texts
Are not achieved through mere fasting and vows alone.

To first awaken resonance with the Supreme Sage,
We must first cleanse our petty flaws.

Thus, with sincerity exhausted and devotion unyielding,
We offer our reverent worship.

Yet still we fear our wisdom is lost like the boundless void,
Our perception obscured by fleeting illusions—
The true unity of *jing*, *qi*, and *shen*,
The mountain of karma yet unshattered;
The false winds of body, mind, and speech,
The ocean of calmness disturbed by sudden waves.

Our accumulated deeds are sins without end,
Boundless and infinite in number.

We humbly pray for mercy from above,
And beg for pardon from below,
That we may answer without hindrance from *mo* (demons),
And dwell in thought harmonized with the Dao.

To gather the myriad truths at the Imperial Seat,
And extend ten thousand ages in the Celestial Plan.

May the teachings flourish and the Dao’s winds prevail far and near;
May the hidden be revealed and the fortunate rejoice,
Following the radiance of the Holy Days.

May the Jade Branch bring enduring peace,
And the Golden Moats stand forever firm.

We, the lawful multitude, bow with utmost sincerity,
In gratitude to the Triple Jewel of Supreme Correctness and True Essence.
**Threefold invocation, threefold obeisance.**

We solemnly invoke the **Supreme Dao/Way** of **Peaceful Void, Natural, Ultimate Truth, and Boundless Greatness**—
the **Original Beginning Heavenly Venerable of the Great Dao**,
the **Supreme Dao Lord**,
the **Supreme Old Lord**,
the **Jade Sovereign of the High Heavenly Emperor**,
the **Celestial Emperor of the Purple Palace’s Upper Court**,
the **Great Emperor of the Purple Palace’s Central Court and Northern Pole**,
the **Earthly Sovereign of the Imperial Land**,
the **Celestial Grandee of the Eastern Azure and Southern Pole**,
the **Celestial Grandee of the Western Mystic and Northern True**,
the **Celestial Grandee of the Dark Metropolis, Golden Threshold, Seven Treasures, Layered Platform, and the Purple Palace’s Upper Court**—
the **Venerable Lord of the Dao’s Supreme Essence and Radiant Truth**,
the **Venerable Lords and Sages of All Ten Directions**,
the **Supreme Ministers and High Officials**,
the **Lesser Ministers and Lesser Officials**,
the **Four Celestial Bureaus and Five Celestial Emperors**,
the **Twelve Celestial Deities of Rank**,
the **Thirty-Six Volumes of Venerable Scriptures**,
the **Great Dao Master of the Mystic**,
the **Great Dao Master of the Three Heavens**,
the **Star Sovereigns of the Purple Palace’s Enclosure and Imperial Seat**,
the **Star Sovereigns of the Supreme Palace’s Enclosure and Lesser Palace’s Enclosure and Imperial Seat**,
the **Star Sovereigns of the Emperor’s Native Star**,
the **Celestial Star Officials Illuminating the Imperial Seat**,
the **Star Sovereigns of the Prince’s Native Star**,
the **Celestial Star Officials Illuminating the Palace Enclosure**,
and **all the Officials of the Three Realms, with their mighty and spiritual authority**.

By fortune of our past karmic ties,
we are born in an age of the Dao’s favor.
We now compile and verify the grand diagrams,
pledging to disseminate their wisdom through the **Celestial Records**.

「To safeguard the nation and bring peace to the family,
we alone extol and assist the **Dao’s transformations**.

By the **Yao Altar**’s auspicious foundation,
we follow the **Qiong Jie**’s sacred texts with reverent analysis.
The harmonious resonance of jingling jade,
the orderly cadence of drums and bells—
the Emperor’s reign is unerring,
the heavens’ response is not distant.

Now further implore the **Divine and True** to descend,
dispatching celestial officials and generals,
to dispel malevolent **qi** and banish evil influences,
to sever sinister traces and guard the sacred altars,
so that the **Way** may welcome prosperity and blessings.

Thus, we, Your humble servants, in morning devotion,
meditate silently and ponder sincerely,
as all phenomena radiate splendor,
illuminating the **Imperial Seat’s** profound mysteries.

The **Three Vehicles** of truth unfold,
hoping to reveal subtle and wondrous teachings in the **Celestial Records**.

With divine power vast and luminous **qi** resplendent,
we humbly continue to proclaim the **Way**,
and further expound its words.

Respectfully submitted.

The **Tenfold Devotion**—
**Preserving the Spirit, Burning Incense, Offering to the Qi Officials**—
attended by the **Dragon and Tiger Sovereigns** at the left and right,
and the **Incense-Serving Celestial Spirits**.

When Your servants now present our sincere pledges to the **Yao Altar**,
golden nectar and emerald **Dan** bloom naturally,
along with the hundred spirits and true beings gathered here.
Incense smoke ascends before the **Qiong Jie**,
as we earnestly pray that the heavens discern Your benevolent intent,
and honor the **Imperial Seat’s** eternal peace.

The harmonious blend of jade’s vibrations and gold’s tones,
the celestial **Qiong**’s wheels and feathered canopies descending upon the hall.
Blessings gather across the land,
favor extends through all realms.

The **Tenfold Celestial Youths** and **Jade Maidens** attend in reverence.
Sandalwood smoke carries our sincerity to the **True and Boundless Dao**,
directly reaching the **Three Pure Ones, Supreme Saints**,
and the **Jade Emperor of the Celestial Supreme** before the **Heavenly Sovereign’s** throne.

Having completed the **hosted incense-offering ritual** for the **Great Golden Arrow Fast**,
we depart the hall and recite the **precepts.**」
