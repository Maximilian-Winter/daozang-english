May we reverently beseech Your Vast Compassion to condescend and manifest Your radiant presence.

We recall how Gou Long governed the earth and Zhu governed the valleys, thus establishing the altars of the state. The people of Zhou venerated fragrance, the people of Shang venerated sound, thereby communicating the virtue of the divine luminaries. Were not sacrificial animals offered solely for their blood? Yet even humble ferns may be presented to kings and dukes.

To be sagely yet unknowing is called divine; to be divine yet luminous is to enter into sageliness.

We reverently recall the Nine Heavens’ Golden Portal Illuminating Dao and Manifesting Virtue Great Immortal, Manifesting Universal Salvation, Vast and Subtle, Profoundly Empty and Wondrously Responsive, Compassionate and Benevolent Protector of the State and Shelter of the People, Vastly Gracious Perfected Lord; and the Nine Heavens’ Jade Portal Proclaiming Transformation and Upholding the Teachings Supreme Immortal, Radiantly Manifesting Universal Salvation, Lofty and Illustrious, Vastly Serene, Profoundly Tranquil, Wondrously Responsive, Benevolent and Compassionate Supporter of the State and Protector of the People, Vastly Gracious Perfected Lord.

Uprightness is their virtue, and fortune or misfortune moves people. They permeate the earth and the earth responds; they permeate the heavens and the heavens respond—none can fathom the subtlety of their numinous power. When they command the sun, the sun shines; when they command the rain, the rain falls, for they alone hold the authority of creation.

Their fame resounds gloriously, and their presence overflows as if near. Above, they assist the Dipper Perfected at the Northern Culmen; silently, they partake in the mysterious learning of Eastern Florescence. In harmony with the Dao, they abide in the divine. Their names ascend the Golden Portal, honored with the conferral of thirty-two characters. Their Dao accords with the Terrace of Dan, where they delved into the essence of over five thousand words. Responding to karmic conditions, they vowed to deliver beings.

Having already received the grace of their sheltering nurture, how dare we neglect the rites of gratitude and supplication? We reverently welcome the arrival of their dharma-chariot to descend upon this Daoist sanctuary.

Some, clad in the rhythmic sway of immortal pendants, follow the eight phoenixes’ refrain. Others, robed in the dignified array of court attire, lead the hundred riders in welcome. Above and below, the immortals’ retinue arrays in splendor; to left and right, the numinous officials stand in guard.

Though the wine offered is humble and the rites unadorned, may their virtue perceive the sincerity of our water-cress devotion. We, the assembly, can but bow with utmost reverence, awaiting the arrival of the Perfected Ones’ chariot.

We invite the Two Ranks—
We invoke the Sages.

When the crane-drawn chariot arrives at the hall, we invite its ascent to the ritual altar. The officials and assembly offer incense, and the first libation of wine is presented. The chime sounds, and flowers are scattered.

We reverently recall how his renown in benevolence and righteousness spread like the branches of King Yan’s lineage; how his unyielding loyalty and martial valor inherited the noble ranks of the Qi state. His benevolent fame first flourished in Min, his virtuous reputation resounding throughout the land. His name was inscribed on bronze tripods, his deeds recorded in historical annals. When he was stationed south of the Gorge River, the people and soldiers remained secure as before. When he raised his banner atop Aofeng, the remnants of bandits were eradicated. Today, the peace of this blessed land is as gracious as the reign of Yao. How could we forget the debt of gratitude, like the binding grass? His praise is sung in the ode of the sweet pear tree. In death, he is venerated with temple offerings; in life, he was enfeoffed as a king—such honor is supreme. His virtue bestowed upon the people, his toil stabilized the realm—even now, he is extolled.

In times past, the grasses and trees responded to the numinous power of Mount Gong; today, the fields are spared the scourge of floods. Boats striking rocks would hear the cry of the yellow banner’s rescue. Neighboring fires would reverse their winds, sparing homes from the fate of the crooked chimney’s ruin. In Jiading, locusts dared not cross the border; in Baoqing, drought demons brought no disaster. When the red serpent appeared, rain poured from the nine heavens; when the divine dragon rose, thunder roared across ten thousand miles. Though no trace is visible—how could night reveal the lanterns of heaven? Though no sound is heard—how could day echo the strings and flutes?

His deeds endure for a thousand years, carved in stone steles; his royal enfeoffments, inscribed in gold across generations. Thus, the people come from a thousand miles to pay homage, and incense is offered in all four seasons with reverence. It is virtue we assist, not the fragrance of millet and grain. No improper offerings are made; only the purity of sacrificial grains is esteemed. Through meritorious deeds and accumulated goodness, through holding fast to precepts and maintaining purity—had he not profoundly aligned with the celestial will, how could he have ascended to the ranks of immortals?

By imperial decree, he was graced with the names of the Golden and Jade Towers, bestowed the titles of Great Immortal and Supreme Immortal. The Dao is our Dao; virtue is our virtue. Transform what is numinous, teach what is divine. Not merely to glorify a single moment or honor one life, but to illuminate what came before and inspire what follows. He taught harmony among kin, and the Hall of Joyful Feasting stands—above, the majesty of the Sacred Father and Sacred Mother; below, the prosperity of the Sacred Sons and Sacred Grandsons. The Sacred Uncle’s name is recorded in the Purple Court; the Sacred Elder Brother receives temple offerings in Jinling. The Divine Empress and her retinue oversee the Register of Life. The Sacred Consort and her immortal kin surround the ranks of inner attendants. Some govern the offices of fortune and emolument; others hold the posts of ministers and nobles. Their authority surpasses the Five Marshals, their valor leads the Three Armies. Whether martial or civil, whether to the left or right—this temple guards the seven Min lands, its grandeur unmatched. His virtue rivals the numinous power of the Five Peaks; who but the most sagely could compare?

We, sheltered by his divine protection, inherit peace. In every sip and bite, we dare not forget. Thrice bathed in fragrance, thrice anointed—we revere him as if he were present. Humbly welcoming his precious chariot, may he deign to witness the devotion of this humble servant’s rites. Gathering the feathered and robed, we dare to offer the auspicious hymns of the azure void.

We, the assembly, bow a hundred times and reverently pray: May the present emperor reign for a hundred million years, safeguarding the people as a father protects his children, bestowing a thousand blessings and a hundred fortunes. May the sovereign’s rule endure forever, and the imperial domain remain eternal. We, with utmost reverence, dare not cease in our proclamations. All sincere words shall now be recited.

**Recitation:**
As the words dictate, they have been duly proclaimed. Humbly, we pray the immortal grace may condescend to regard them.

We reverently recall how warding off calamities and averting disasters demands the strictest observance of ritual. To repay merit and exalt virtue is the duty of advancing one’s immortal rank. May he be honored with the crimson decrees of the Golden Tower, and grace the incense altar of the Jade Emperor. In the ebb and flow of the Two Qi, may he master the arts of emerging from the azure and entering the mysterious. In the circulation of the Seven Fluids, may he attain the wonders of embracing the purple and holding the yellow. In himself, he embodies the beauty of self-cultivation; for others, he extends the merit of universal salvation. What he senses is surely communicated; no request goes unanswered. To relieve the people’s suffering, what need is there for Bian Que’s remedies? To divine the yin and yang of land, he silently imparts Guo Pu’s learning. For those seeking marriage, may homes and chambers prosper. For those praying for descendants, may sons and grandsons flourish. For those pursuing office, may they be exhorted to establish themselves through loyalty and filial piety. For merchants, may they be instructed that benevolence and righteousness are the true profit. Farmers toil in the fields; artisans perfect their skills. Near and far, all are pleased and drawn near—manifesting benevolence while concealing its application. Those who turn their hearts to the Dao are all enlightened by his grace. Whether tonsured or with hair bound, all rely on his sheltering protection.

Today, we, the assembly, reverently follow the sacred decree, establishing this ritual to repay the true blessings and pray for abundant favor. Humbly, we pray: May his sagely virtue remain pure, his divine merit resplendent. May the Nine Heavens bestow blessings, bringing boundless fortune; may the Two Luminaries shine together, opening the vast realm of longevity. May all living things flourish, and all undertakings prosper.

The assembly bows, offers incense and wine, and presents the second libation. The chime sounds, and flowers are scattered.

We have heard how the stele of Luo Chi endures forever, its heroic spirit indelible. The Donghua Cave of a thousand years—who has carried on its true essence? We revere the local deity, whose deeds span the heavens. His skeletal form merges with the immortals in vast beneficence; his literary brilliance rivals that of Lord Liu. Had he not stored the essence of the stars, he must have been nurtured by the mountains and rivers. His poems, odes, and eulogies are worthy of recitation—indeed, they demand grand inscription, repeated inscription, and yet more inscription.

In matters of fortune and misfortune, there is no error; yet we dare not presume, lest we trespass again and again. Clearly perceiving the principles of the manifest and hidden, he foresees the mechanisms of dependence and reversal. His countenance is grave and awe-inspiring, feared like the frost and scorching sun. His Dao is lofty and distant, revered like the North Star and Mount Tai. His illustrious virtue shines brightly; his imperial numen gleams sharply.

Today, we, the assembly, reverently follow the sacred decree, establishing this precious fast to manifestly repay divine favor and pray for abundant blessings. Humbly, we pray: May the imperial domain stand firm, as enduring as the mountains and peaks.

May the sacred body enjoy abundant peace, as enduring as Heaven and Earth. May the six palaces ever know felicity, and the myriad realms all attain tranquility.

The assembly bows in reverence, offering incense and wine, presenting the final libation. The proclamation is read, and the sacred departure begins.

We hear that the towering peaks of Ao rise in majesty, nearly touching the celestial stars. The dragon’s head rears proudly, bestowing upon the mortal realm its rain and dew. Having long received such grace in ordinary times, how shall we repay it now? Pure offerings are arrayed, yet we humbly lack jade urns and golden nectar. The fare of the immortals—nothing but fire-dates and intertwined pears.

Now the precious talismans’ incense fades, the silver lamps’ flames grow cold. Star-crowned and feather-robed, the steps of emptiness resound afar in the jade palace. Mist-borne chariots and cloud-borne carriages, the celestial procession prepares to return to the golden portals. Though our hearts race with lingering devotion, we pray still for descending blessings and exorcising rites.

The assembly, with utmost reverence, bows twice more in farewell.

**Sending Forth the Deities**

The incense-burning officials, the divine lords left and right, and the attending spirit-officials of the incense—at this place of the present fast, may golden elixirs, cinnabar mushrooms, and azure herbs naturally arise. May the hundred spirits and host of perfected ones gather in celebration before this incense burner.

May the imperial will be conveyed in full, and the true mirror perceive all without omission. May the jade maidens and immortal youths of the ten directions attend the rising incense, transmitting the words we have just uttered, swiftly delivering them to the presence of the **Radiant Dao and Virtuous Great Immortal of the Golden Portals of the Nine Heavens, Manifestly Potent and Universally Beneficent, Pure and Subtle, Profoundly Empty and Wondrously Responsive, Compassionate and Gracious, Protector of the State and Shelter of the People, Vastly Benevolent Perfected Lord**; and to the **Illustrious and Vastly Beneficent Perfected Lord of the Jade Portals of the Nine Heavens, Propagator of Transformation and Upholder of the Dao, Brilliant and Potent, Lofty and Serene, Profoundly Still and Wondrously Responsive, Benevolent and Gracious, Supporter of the State and Protector of the People**.

To the **Vastly Benevolent and Spiritually Efficacious Perfected Lord**, we offer thanks and conclude the rites of this fast.
