**The Supreme Compassionate Nine Dark Realms Salvation and Repentance Sutra, Fascicle One**

At that time, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of Original Beginning roamed through the worlds of the ten directions, traversing without exception the heavens above and the earth below. Arriving in the Land of Great Blessing, he beheld the August Sovereign of the Void Dao, who, out of weariness for the lands of the ten directions and all sentient beings—good men and women—divided his body in responsive transformation. From his mouth issued forth five-colored luminous radiance, illuminating the ten directions without obstruction.

At that time, men and women, along with the four assemblies, were filled with dread day and night, their voices choked with sorrow and lamentation. Gazing upon the honored countenance, they prostrated themselves, knocking their heads to the ground, crawling forward on elbows and knees. All birds and beasts did likewise. Every sentient being in every direction looked up, their forms and shadows utterly stilled, unable to find where to turn.

Then, the August Sovereign of the Void Dao, moved by compassion for all beings, divided his body and descended to the world below. Seated upon the Jeweled Throne of Azure Radiance, he contemplated those beings and, as was his custom, expounded the teachings to transform and instruct them. All embodied spirits, along with the birds and beasts, came before the throne, prostrating themselves in reverence, advancing step by step. Overjoyed at once more encountering the Dao Sovereign, they bowed in humble awe.

At that time, beneath the throne there was a perfected one named Universal Salvation, who emerged from the assembly. Prostrating himself in reverence, he addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying, "We wish to hear the exposition. By what causes and conditions may men and women of the ten directions, while living, obtain blessings, and at death attain rebirth?"

The Heavenly Worthy replied, "Return to your seat and quiet your mind. I shall explain all causes and conditions."

The Heavenly Worthy declared, "In the worlds of the ten directions, there are heavens. If men and women constantly pay homage to the Heavenly Worthies of the ten directions by their proper titles, while living they shall obtain blessings, and at death attain rebirth."

Thereupon, the Perfected One Universal Salvation and the four assemblies knelt as one, listening intently to the exposition.

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy first spoke of the Eastern Azure Spirit, the Primordial Elder, the Nine Qi Heavenly Lord, and the Realm of Flourishing Forests. Therein dwells a perfected one in the Land of Serene Stillness and Boundless Kindness, adorned with majestic tranquility. If, on the day of one’s passing, one wishes to be reborn in that land, one should pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the Eastern Direction by his proper title, kneeling in repentance. Thus shall one be freed from the obstructions of measureless sins, attain boundless goodness, refine one’s essence and purify one’s spirit, ascend to perfection, and awaken to the Dao.

Having paid homage to the Three Treasures, we now proceed to repentance.
With reverent mind, we take refuge in the Three Treasures abiding in the ten directions.
We repent for the sins of errors and transgressions accumulated over kalpas past.
We, the multitude, benighted and dull, fail to reflect upon our former wrongs—having created evil karmic conditions or acted with misguided intent.
Our minds burn like fire, blazing without distinction of beauty or ugliness;
Our wills are sharp as blades, cutting without regard for strength or weakness.
Accumulated over days and months, through years and ages, these sins have never been confessed.
We fear falling into the mire and charcoal, the ice pools and pillars of fire, the trees of swords and cauldrons of boiling oil—
where cold pierces the heart and heat scorches the body, where sinews are severed and bones broken, where bellies rot and bowels dissolve.

For such karmic roots of sin, we beseech your cleansing and absolution.
The Heavenly Worthy declares: If there are good men and good women who have not yet reached life’s end—though they have committed sins—let them also cultivate merit.
Cultivating merit in life, they may attain eight-tenths of its fruit;
Applying merit to offset sin, the measure of redemption will then be known.
If in the past they performed various meritorious deeds, of seven parts, they will retain but one.
Yet by calculating merit to offset transgression, their blessings will remain in surplus.
Such a reckoning is called "attaining the one."
If the merit they accumulate is insufficient to offset their sins, they shall then traverse the Three Wretched Realms, enduring every form of suffering—
dying and being reborn ten thousand times in a single day and night, experiencing all manner of torment.

If there is a deceased person, on the day of their passing, let masters be invited from all directions, along with the living sons and daughters, kin, and fellow devotees, to gather in one place.
Let incense be burned, repentance made, precepts received, and sutras recited.
First, take the clothing of the deceased and present it before the incense fire to repent and receive the precepts.
From the time of death until the twenty-first day, establish a pure and secluded place to set up a ritual altar.
Let lamps be lit to continue the light, hymns sung, and the Dao circumambulated; let bells be struck and prostrations made with utmost sincerity.
The purpose of this is to swiftly cultivate merit.
For the newly deceased, the path is just opening, and they come to understand east from west.
Riding this good karmic condition, they may be reborn in the Land of Ultimate Bliss.
The deceased ancestors are delivered, and the living receive grace.

Having completed the repentance, with reverent mind, bow in homage.
Let each person pay respect with utmost reverence.

With reverent mind, bow in homage to the Perfected One of Great Compassion, Great Mercy, and Ascension to Higher Realms.

Having paid homage to the Three Treasures, we now proceed to repentance.
With reverent mind, we take refuge in the Three Treasures abiding in the ten directions, the Heavenly Worthies.
We repent for the sins of errors and transgressions accumulated over kalpas past.
We, the multitude, sheltered in the wombs of our fathers and mothers, whether rich or poor, noble or base, good or evil, female or male—
none comprehend the wheel of rebirth, nor can we discern its beginning or end.

Though repentance has been made before, we fear it may not have been thorough. May all karmic grievances and transgressions be fully cleansed and absolved.

The Heavenly Worthy declares: If there be good men and good women who wish, on the day of their passing, to be reborn in the wondrous and joyous realms of the ten directions, they must purify body and mind, wash away filth and defilement, array their garments with dignity, relinquish their personal wealth, burn finest incense, invite a master to perform repentance rites, hang banners and canopies, chant hymns of praise, make offerings to the Three Treasures, recite the sacred scriptures, and adorn all with splendor. Following these teachings faithfully, the true wisdom of the Dharma is beyond conception.

Consider these beings: when they contemplate this fleshly form, from emptiness to emptiness, it is but a silent and transient aggregation of earth, water, fire, and wind. Should its assembly dissolve and decay, yet the essence advance upon the Dao, liberation may be attained, and rebirth may occur according to one’s wishes. The fruition of blessings will surely be achieved. With a mind of true sincerity, one escapes the hells, receives joy naturally, and beholds the Great Dao.

At that time, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy addressed the Most High Dao Lord, saying: "You and the Universal Savior Perfected One shall traverse the ten directions. You will see that among your disciples, there are those who wish to be reborn in the blissful lands of the ten directions—boundless and infinite, beyond reckoning."

Then the Heavenly Worthy, the Dao Lord, and the assembly of sagely beings in all the pure and serene realms—also boundless and immeasurable, beyond description—spoke amidst the multitude for the sake of all beings in the four assemblies and the unseen realms. They revealed the wondrous realms within and beyond the Three Realms, including the lands of the flying immortals, the Perfected Ones, and the sagely hosts, briefly disclosing their names and origins.

If one can devote oneself to reverent worship, fulfill the merit of three thousand deeds, practice generosity toward all beings, and cultivate diligently without slack, one shall be reborn in the pure realms, unconfined by dark prisons. May all aspire to take refuge, bow in homage, and withdraw.

*Thus concludes the first scroll of The Most High’s Compassionate Repentance for the Deliverance of the Nine Hells.*
*The second scroll of The Most High’s Compassionate Repentance for the Deliverance of the Nine Hells begins.*

At that time, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy expounded for the Universal Savior Perfected One the Eastern Realm of the Azure Spirit, the Primordial Elder, the Nine Qi Heavenly Lords, and the Boundless Land of Flowery Grove, a realm of serene adornment. Having completed this discourse, he further expounded the Southeastern Realm of the Pristine Qi Heavenly Lord, the Azure Radiance Realm, and the Land of True Peace and Boundlessness, a realm of wondrous tranquility.

If, on the day of one’s passing, one wishes to be reborn in that land, one must purify oneself with fasting and reverence, invite a master to perform the rites, and facing the southeast, invoke the Heavenly Worthy by his proper title. Kneeling in repentance, one may be absolved of the sins as numerous as the sands of the Ganges and attain boundless good causes. Refining the body and clarifying the spirit, one ascends to Perfection and awakens to the Dao. With utmost sincerity, we now pay reverent homage.

Having paid homage to the Three Treasures, proceed now to repentance.

With wholehearted devotion, take refuge in the Three Treasures abiding in the ten directions.
We repent the sins of our bodily deeds. From the moment of birth, our forms have taken shape—heads bearing the round heavens, feet treading the square earth—our flesh foul and ugly, our bones and blood rank and base. We fail to shield the stars, ever offending wind and rain. These yang transgressions accumulate, inevitably incurring yin faults. Relying on this good affinity, may all be cleansed through repentance.

The Heavenly Worthy declares: If good men and good women, on behalf of the deceased—during the first hundred days, the first anniversary, or distant memorials—create sutras and images, hold vegetarian feasts, and make offerings, though their wealth be great, the merit gained is meager. For their minds are careless and indifferent, their intentions coarse and negligent. They offer leftover food in feasts, use surplus wealth for images. Now giving, now withholding, now acting, now resting—though the price be high, the merit is scant. Some defile offerings with meat and杂物, others give in doubt and hesitation, so that the merit gained is but a third of what it might be. It is like clothing: though cut to shape, if left long unsewn, how can one wear it? How can it be fastened? For there is a beginning but no end, and so the merit is not fulfilled.

If one creates sutras and images, prepares vegetarian feasts, or offers goods to dharma masters, yet loses even a portion—whether through concealment or error—the blessing is incomplete. Why trouble to create it? The wealth is wasted, the initial effort in vain. The living incur misfortune, the dead incur guilt. Even if they sink again into hell, enduring dark transgressions, suffering pierces the body, hunger and cold afflict the frame. Hesitation brings no escape; endurance is impossible. Iron rods pierce the heart, fire pellets scorch the mouth—each torment must be endured, each debt repaid. There is no door for flight, no place to flee. Calamity extends to the seven ancestors, disaster reaches the nine generations. No leisure is to be had, no good fruit to be hoped for. Though one may later repent, past wrongs cannot be undone.

All this stems from the accumulation of good and evil: good gathers to good, evil to evil. As form follows shadow, as echo follows sound, crooked and straight cannot escape, purity and turbidity cannot be concealed. You men and women, when making offerings with devotion, holding pure fasts, and performing repentance, do not do so for fame, claiming merit thereby. For fame and merit bear such sins as these.

Good women and faithful men, receive this truthfully, and the souls of the departed shall be liberated, disasters and misfortunes dispelled. Bow in reverence and take refuge; now pay respect with devotion.

With wholehearted devotion, we take refuge in the Three Treasures abiding in the ten directions.

We repent the sins of bodily karma, for though our physical forms share the same origin, they differ in nobility and baseness, high and low, endowed with qi rich or poor, broad or narrow, unequal in measure.
Some, born noble, dwell in deep halls and spacious chambers, trailing purple and girded in crimson, their silver walls and pepper-scented chambers adorned with cinnabar terraces and jade balustrades.
Others, born base, are but barefoot servants, ever following behind or rushing ahead, their voices faint and spirits constrained, their station lowly and demeanor humble.
Some, born rich, don fine furs and ride fat horses, their inner chambers refined and meals exquisite, their words resonant as bells, their hearts vast as the sea.
Others, born poor, suffer cold and hunger unrelieved, their rites and propriety unfulfilled, their words and deeds at odds, their actions without recourse.

Such is the chaos of bodily karma—how can we rightly uphold it?
Transgressions multiply, and who can steadfastly guard against them?
Though we have repented before, we fear our efforts remain incomplete.
In this moment of reverence, may all be cleansed and purified.

The Heavenly Worthy spoke: "Excellent are your words.
In sustaining the world, you act for the sake of all beings, offering expedient means to address their difficulties and resolve their doubts.
Freely ask your questions, each in turn, and I shall answer them all—truly, this is most rare.
I now praise again this inconceivable merit and declare to all beings: listen carefully and cultivate accordingly, for this shall lead to liberation.

If there are good men and good women whose parents have passed away, and they prepare offerings for the afterlife, relinquishing their family wealth to sponsor scriptures and seek repentance, thereby washing away all transgressions, they shall ascend to the heavenly realms.
If any man or woman copies scriptures, commissions images, arranges offerings, or observes fasts, yet takes for themselves any surplus wealth—even a single coin’s worth—failing to repay it tenfold over ten years, they shall suffer grave illness, lose their fine appearance, dwell like birds beneath the open sky, and upon death be cast aside in the human realm, forever without release.
Even if reborn, they shall be deaf, blind, or afflicted with the six infirmities, never whole.

If they misuse banners or floral offerings, failing to repay sevenfold over seven years, they shall be imprisoned, bound in shackles and chains, day and night confined, growing ever more emaciated, their pleas for mercy unending.
If they misappropriate the property of Dharma masters, failing to repay fivefold over five years, they shall become destitute, suffering cold and hunger, or be reborn as oxen or horses to labor in repayment, or as swine or sheep to forfeit their lives in recompense.
Some may be orphaned in youth, with nowhere to turn, dependent on others, their bodies and speech incomplete.

All this arises from lack of filial piety, leading to such karmic retribution.
You, men and women, take heed.
Diligently cultivate merit, uphold the precepts with your bodies, and practice with single-minded devotion.
Bow in reverence and withdraw."

*Thus concludes the second scroll of The Heavenly Worthy’s Compassionate Repentance for Deliverance from the Nine Hells.*
*The third scroll of The Heavenly Worthy’s Compassionate Repentance for Deliverance from the Nine Hells begins.*

Then, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, for the sake of the Perfected One of Universal Salvation, expounded upon the Lord of Brahma-Qi of the Southeast, the Boundless Realm of Azure Radiance, the Land of Wondrous Tranquility and Splendor.
Having finished, he further expounded upon the Lord of Brahma-Treasure, Prosperous Yang, Cinnabar Spirit, and True Elder of the Three Qi of the South—the Brahma-Heaven Realm, where there is a Perfected One named True Elder of the Boundless Realm, the Land of Upright Transformation and Splendor.
If one wishes, on the day of their passing, to be reborn in that land, they should purify themselves and observe a fast, inviting a master to reverently invoke the Heavenly Worthy of the Southern Quarters, kneel in repentance, and thereby dissolve the sands of karmic obstacles, attain boundless good causes, refine their essence and clarify their spirit, ascend to Perfection, and awaken to the Dao.

Having paid homage to the Three Treasures, we proceed to repentance.
With wholehearted devotion, we take refuge in the Three Treasures abiding in the ten directions.
We repent the sins of our mental karma: since the earliest division of north and south, the gradual distinction of east and west, we have loved the fine and despised the coarse, rejoiced in wealth and resented poverty. What our hearts have trusted, we have not measured by length or brevity; we have coveted profit and forgotten gratitude, estranged kin and cherished outsiders. At the sight of adornment, we have been insatiable; at the sound of plain truth, we have been as if facing a chasm or an enemy. Our sins have piled high as mountains, our merits have been no more than dust or dew. We fear that our names will be recorded in the northern registry, our lifespans shortened in the southern palace. Thus we dare to repent before the Dao, beseeching your pardon and forgiveness.

The Heavenly Worthy said: If there are good men and good women who, from birth to death, have defaced sacred images, damaged or destroyed Daoist sanctuaries; who have stripped or harmed ordained persons or those who have left the household life; who have broken precepts, consumed meat and blood, harbored the five grave transgressions, slandered the Three Treasures, or raged against compassionate kin; who have abandoned the lowly, despised the poor, forsaken husbands, or pursued wives; who have enriched themselves at others’ expense, turned from the upright to the perverse, distanced those of shared qi, and valued only worldly associations; who have misused the property of the Three Treasures without shame, borrowed heavily and denied repayment; who have killed living beings, stolen, distrusted public ways, turned from light to darkness, deceived the living and cheated the dead; who have reviled the good, bullied the worthy, indulged in ceaseless lust, or harbored unrelenting malice—all such sins are bound in the prisons of the unseen. Without repentance and expiation, how can they be dissolved?

If there are good men and good women who constantly practice filial devotion, morning and night without negligence; who, for the sake of parents, the nine generations, friends, blood relations, siblings, or themselves, have offered alms, invited masters, performed repentance rites, presented refined offerings, and purified the Daoist sanctuary; who, on the eight seasonal nodes, the three primal days, the five fasts, the ten auspicious days, the seven origins, birthdays, New Year’s Day, or the Gengshen days—on these propitious occasions—have upheld fasting and precepts, they may dispel the eight difficulties, avert a thousand calamities, reconcile all enemies, and wash away enmity. The departed may leave suffering, ascend to heaven after long ages; hells may cease their torment, the gates of darkness may close their waters. Ignorance may be enlightened, the six illnesses healed; traversing the four seasons, they may avoid misfortune and strife.

You, men and women, must each be vigilant in conduct, ever mindful and never weary. Thus you will encounter good fruits and meet with this causal condition. Having completed repentance, with purified heart, bow in reverence.

Having paid homage to the Three Treasures, we proceed to repent.
With wholehearted devotion, we take refuge in the Three Treasures abiding in the ten directions.
We now repent the sins of our minds and deeds. For our wisdom and vision are shallow and narrow, our qi and disposition stubborn and foolish. We act with reckless abandon, clinging to our own views as right. Greed knows no bounds, miserliness no end. We regard goodness as foe and welcome evil as kin. Though we amass wealth by the thousands and tens of thousands, we still claim poverty. Our sins run deep and many, yet we ever call them just. From beginning to end, how could we know or sense them? Day by day, hour by hour, year by year, month by month, we have failed to repent and purify—how then may they be dispelled? Now, before the Dao, we earnestly seek cleansing.

The Heavenly Worthy declares: “Good sons and good daughters, all karmic conditions bear retribution. Listen carefully as I set forth the sequence:
Iron beds rend the body, copper pillars sear the sinews—this is the retribution for the sin of lust.
Frigid ice and snow mountains, hearts pierced and bones broken—this is the retribution for the sin of theft.
Tongues torn out and fire swallowed, molten copper poured into the mouth—this is the retribution for the sin of divisive speech.
Hot ashes bury the body, raging fires burn the flesh—this is the retribution for the sin of killing.
Iron plows furrow the back, fierce birds peck out the eyes, sword trees split the limbs, pestles and mortars grind the face—this is the retribution for the sin of glaring anger.
Becoming hungry ghosts, traversing cauldrons of boiling liquid, swallowing iron pellets, hunger forcing their consumption—this is the retribution for the sin of breaking fasts and violating precepts.
Eyebrows and hair falling out, sores covering the body, the whole frame aflame and rotting—this is the retribution for the sin of destroying sacred images and Daoist sanctuaries.
Fire issuing from the mouth, sores erupting in the eyes, pus flowing from the entire body, no place to hide—this is the retribution for the sin of luring away and abandoning those who have left the household life.
Tongues silenced, throats blocked, eyes blinded, lips split asunder—this is the retribution for the sin of slandering those who have left the household life.
Dullness, deafness, and stunted growth, unable to distinguish life from death, or becoming spouses only to part midway—this is the retribution for the sin of estranging parents.
Becoming oxen, horses, swine, or sheep, birds, beasts, hawks, or hounds—this is the retribution for the sin of defaulting on debts.
Becoming servants, suffering cold and lowly status, orphaned, widowed, frail, sickly, and weak—this is the retribution for the sin of slighting siblings of the same qi.

Such retributions lie before our very eyes. Good women and faithful men, reflect deeply upon this. Receive it with sincere heart, forever severing past transgressions. Having completed this repentance, proceed in observance and depart.”

*End of the Third Scroll of the Most High’s Compassionate Repentance for Deliverance from the Nine Hells*
*Beginning of the Fourth Scroll of the Most High’s Compassionate Repentance for Deliverance from the Nine Hells*

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning expounded for the Perfected of Universal Salvation the Southern Realm of Brahma-Treasure, Flourishing Yang, Cinnabar Numinosity, True Elder, Red Emperor, and Threefold Qi Celestial Lords—the Boundless Land of Brahma-Heaven’s domain, its majestic transformations wondrously arrayed. Having concluded, he further expounded on the Celestial Lords of the Southwestern Brahma-Qi, their realm of Radiant Perfection. There dwells a Perfected One, named the Land of Boundless Jeweled Light, whose majestic transformations bring wondrous salvation. Should one, on the day of death, wish to be reborn in that land, one must purify oneself and maintain a pure fast. Invite a master to reverently worship the Heavenly Worthy of the Southwestern Direction by his proper appellation. Kneeling in repentance, one may dissolve the sands of sins and obstacles, attain boundless good causes, refine the body and clarify the spirit, ascend to Perfection and awaken to the Dao.

The homage to the Three Treasures is complete.

Proceeding to repentance:
With wholehearted devotion, take refuge in the Three Treasures abiding in the ten directions.
We repent the sins of our mouths, boundless in number.
Perhaps we have deceived the worthy and slandered the sagely, destroyed the Dao and resented kin, spoken ill of others’ faults, boasted of our own rightness, cursed the wind and reviled the rain, loathed the heat and despised the cold, turned being into nonbeing, made the coarse seem fine, set the good at odds, and extolled the foolish.
All these arise from the mouth and are the root of sin.
The many transgressions are measureless and boundless.
Today, before the Heavenly Worthies of the ten directions, we wash our hearts and offer sincere prayers, taking refuge and repenting, beseeching that all be cleansed and removed.

The Heavenly Worthy says:
If there are good men and good women who act for the sake of:
First, Heaven and Earth;
Second, the Emperor;
Third, parents;
Fourth, all beings;
Fifth, blood relations;
Sixth, themselves—
From the time of receiving life until this day, whether one, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, or even a hundred, a hundred and twenty years old, should one wish to engage in preparatory cultivation, begin again from one seven-day period, two seven-day periods, three seven-day periods, four seven-day periods, up to seven seven-day periods, a hundred days, a full year, and so on without end.
The meritorious deeds thus performed should follow this order:
First, create images;
Second, copy scriptures;
Next, make banners forty-nine feet long, prepare a feast for forty-nine people, establish a ritual arena, invite the images of the various worthies and the Dharma masters, along with the incense-fire companions.
Light forty-nine lamps to illuminate the heavens, arranging the lamps in three tiers, wider below and narrower above, round and turning like a wheel.
Offer incense and flowers according to one’s means, whether lavish or modest.
For three days and three nights, or seven days and seven nights, pour forth sincere prayers, repenting and supplicating with devotion.
Before the Three Treasures, extol and confess on behalf of the deceased, using words that are simple and unadorned, avoiding florid language.
Strive for utmost sincerity, and blessings and benefits will surely manifest.

Next, broadly ransom lives, whether a hundred or a thousand, as many as possible.
Next, take pity on the poor, the lowly, the destitute, travelers in distress, the sick, the orphaned, the elderly, prisoners, the hungry, those in remote regions, the ignorant who know not east from west, and those who discern not good from evil—all are worthy of salvation, that they may bathe in good fortune.
If one encounters strangers from afar in dire need, extend deliverance, relieve their hardships, rescue them from cold and hunger, and ensure their peace and happiness.
This, too, is a way to guide and offer for the deceased, and its merit is greatest.

Next, for the sake of departed parents and kin from countless kalpas past, copy or commission thirty-six sections of the sacred scriptures, as many as one can—one, ten, a hundred, or even a thousand sections—according to one’s means.
The merit of delivering the souls of the departed is immeasurable, benefiting both the living and the dead, allowing the departed to roam freely.
All you men and women, listen carefully and act accordingly.

Having paid homage to the Three Treasures, we proceed to repentance.
With wholehearted devotion, we take refuge in the ever-abiding Three Treasures of the ten directions.
We once more repent the sins of our verbal karma. From beginningless kalpas until this day, the weight of our verbal karma is such that we, the assembly, can scarcely bear it. We have prized eloquence and cunning speech, mocked superiors and slighted inferiors, fabricated falsehoods as truths, made frivolous promises and indulged our emotions, slandered at will, criticized the sacred teachings, disparaged the true scriptures, adorned wrongs with fine words, and deluded the multitude with flowery phrases. We have indulged in rich flavors and consumed flesh and blood.
All such transgressions and errors are the sins of our verbal karma.
Today, before the Heavenly Worthies of the ten directions, we wash our hearts and repent, beseeching that all be cleansed and eradicated.

Thereupon, the Most High Lord of the Dao addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying, “Are the fine motes of dust, countless as they are, considered many?”
The Heavenly Worthy replied, “Very many, very many.”
The Lord of the Dao said, “If we compare the merits of copying scriptures, making images, banners, and pennants, ransoming lives, and scattering alms, are they many?”
The Heavenly Worthy said, “Very many, very many.”
“Now, let these fine motes of dust be likened to such merits. The merits of copying scriptures, making images, banners, and pennants are like the sands of the Ganges—so numerous they cannot be reckoned, very many, very many, beyond measure.
Such causes and conditions are foremost.
When the making of scriptures, images, banners, and pennants is completed, establish a Daoist sanctuary, observe a seven-day, seven-night retreat, chant hymns of praise, recite scriptures to untie karmic knots, scatter flowers, burn incense, strike bells, and sound chimes. Thus, all enmities shall be dissolved, and kin—near and far, inner and outer—shall come to the sanctuary, rejoicing together, repenting and making offerings. Do not harbor resentful thoughts, and your sins may be eradicated.
The seven generations of your ancestors shall escape hell and ascend to heaven.
Admonish all men and women: observe purification rites, bow in worship, receive the precepts, uphold the mind, practice forbearance and gentleness, make offerings to the Three Treasures and to those who have left the household life, abstain from all meat and impurities, burn incense and light lamps, ransom lives and release beings. Regard all as your own self, without distinction.
Good men and believing women, heed these words before the Dao, follow the Dharma in practice, bow your heads, and withdraw.”

Here ends the fourth scroll of *The Most High’s Compassionate Repentance for Deliverance from the Nine Hells*.

Thereupon, the Heavenly Worthy of Original Beginning expounded to the Perfected One of Universal Salvation the realm of the Celestial Lord of Pristine Qi in the southwest, the Luminous True Realm, the Land of Infinite Goodness and Salvation.
Having done so, he further expounded the Golden Light Realm of the Seven Treasures and the White Emperor of the Seven Qi in the west, the Celestial Lord of Radiant Numinosity. Therein dwells a Perfected One named the Land of Dharma-Treasure and Infinite Benefit, adorned with salvation.
If, on the day of death, one wishes to be reborn in that land, one should purify oneself, observe a pure fast, invite a master, and pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the Western Direction. Kneeling in repentance, one shall be freed from the sins of as many kalpas as the sands of the Ganges and attain boundless good causes.
Refine the body and clarify the spirit, ascend to the true and awaken to the Dao. With utmost sincerity, take refuge and pay homage.

With reverent mind, bow in homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Penetrating Spirit and Mysterious Illumination.

Having paid homage to the Three Treasures, we proceed to repentance.
With reverent mind, we take refuge in the Three Treasures abiding in the ten directions.
We repent for the sins committed in this present life:
Perhaps we have harbored unkind thoughts, acted with foolish intent, indulged in greed, anger, and delusion, engaged in licentiousness and wantonness, maintained outward truth while inwardly false, spoken with forked tongues, envied the worthy and good, or harmed living beings. Through the six senses and three karmic actions, we have erred in both deliberate and unintentional deeds. All these transgressions are measureless and boundless.

Now, before the Heavenly Worthies of the ten directions, we take refuge, repent, and seek their cleansing.
The Heavenly Worthy declares: If there are good men or good women who, in their lifetime, commit various evil deeds—perhaps owing debts of wealth to others, harboring enmity, seizing without restraint, or coveting without cease; or misusing the wealth of the Three Treasures, stealing public property, acting for the sake of men or women, village or community, oneself or friends, whether by one’s own hand or by instructing others—heedless of good causes, they know only to indulge in evil. Such sins are measureless and boundless, too numerous to recount.

For you, the departed souls of men and women, and your present karmic kin, when the deceased has passed, establish a Daoist sanctuary. For one, two, or three weeks—up to seven weeks—prepare twenty-one silk banners in blue, yellow, azure, and green, each seven feet in length. Within the sanctuary, before the honored images, abundantly arrange incense and flowers, hang the banners and canopies, and make offerings to the Heavenly Worthy and the scriptures. With wholehearted devotion, according to your means, commission the copying of sacred scriptures, the painting of honored images, and the almsgiving to the Dharma-body of the ordained. For three days and nights, or seven days and nights, recite the scriptures, circumambulate the altar, chant the hymns of the grotto, encircle the Dharma seat, and lead your kin to the sanctuary. Each should rouse their resolve to deliver the departed from suffering and peril, ascend to the heavens, atone for transgressions, and repent with a single heart, without hindrance, attaining freedom and ease.

If among the assembly there are those who grow lax, though they undertake meritorious deeds, they do not rouse sincere devotion. For such departed souls, their transgressions will be difficult to absolve, and their suffering will only increase without end.

You men and women, listen carefully, devote yourselves with sincerity, and harbor no doubt. The causes and conditions described above are beyond enumeration. By this virtuous fruit, you may ascend directly to the Southern Palace, shed the names of your sins, escape the dark confinement, and turn the wheel of fortune to follow your wishes in rebirth.

All of you, turn your hearts and take refuge in repentance.
Each reverently pays homage.

Having paid homage to the Three Treasures, we proceed to repentance.
With reverent mind, we take refuge in the Three Treasures abiding in the ten directions.
We repent for the sins of this present life, our errors and transgressions.
Some may have committed evil knowingly, yet remained unaware;
Others may have persisted in wrongdoing, still believing themselves right.
This stems from our nature and consciousness, born lowly and common.
Our minds drowned in the river of attachment, our bodies sunk in the sea of desire—
One day, when we depart this life, we shall forever fall into the dark gates,
With no hope of escape, enduring endless suffering.
Without relying on the power of the Dao, how can these lonely souls be delivered?

The Heavenly Worthy said: "Listen carefully. For those newly deceased,
From the day of their passing, if their families relinquish wealth and property,
And perform this scripture and repentance within the first, second, or third seven-day period,
Creating various meritorious deeds, this is the highest method.
For the deceased, having just left the human world and entered the gates of the underworld,
Require good causes to rely upon for deliverance.
Within these three seven-day periods, creating various meritorious deeds is called the next-best method.
The foremost deeds are:
First, creating images;
Second, copying scriptures;
Third, observing fasts and precepts;
Fourth, offering banners and flowers;
Fifth, burning incense and lamps;
Sixth, establishing Daoist altars;
Seventh, ransoming lives;
Eighth, practicing almsgiving;
Ninth, broadly aiding others;
Tenth, eliminating miserliness;
Eleventh, compassionate giving;
Twelfth, cultivating an equanimous mind."

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy expounded the twelve blessings and the causes and conditions of various meritorious deeds.
If there are good men and good women who, in accordance with this, perform posthumous rites and undertake meritorious deeds,
Their filial piety will surely reach the heavenly courts,
And the deceased will decisively escape hell,
Enjoying carefree happiness, dwelling long in halls of fortune,
With clothing and food naturally provided, attaining perfection and awakening to the Dao.
This is because the merit of offering and guidance is foremost.
In the past, there was a man who donated a single coin to a permanent abode,
And his protection and fortune were boundless.
Another child offered earth, which transformed into cinnabar—
The retribution of karmic causes follows like a shadow.
As a clear mirror reflects a person, beauty and ugliness become distinct.
The karma of good and evil operates in the same way.
Thus, the merit of filial devotion is the greatest.
You, men and women, should each carefully reflect:
To repay the toil of your parents, nothing surpasses the power of the sages.
I tell you, worthy ones, you should each practice accordingly.

*Scripture of the Heavenly Worthy’s Compassionate Salvation from the Nine Dark Realms, Scroll Five* concludes.
*Scripture of the Heavenly Worthy’s Compassionate Salvation from the Nine Dark Realms, Scroll Six*

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning expounded to the Perfected One of Universal Salvation
The realm of the Seven Qi Heavenly Lords of the Golden Gate of Seven Treasures in the Western Quarter,
The Land of Limitless Light and Majestic Numinosity.
Having finished, he further expounded on the Heavenly Lord of Brahma-Qi in the Northwest,
The realm of the Wondrous Dao, where the Perfected One is named the Land of Limitless Salvation from Suffering,
Adorned with the majesty of true immortals.
If, on the day of one’s passing, one wishes to be reborn in that land,
One should purify oneself and observe a fast,
Invite a master to venerate and pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the Northwest,
Kneel in repentance, eradicate the sins as numerous as the sands of the Ganges,
And obtain boundless good causes.
Refine the body and clarify the spirit, attaining perfection and awakening to the Dao.

Having paid homage to the Three Treasures, we proceed to repent.
With reverent mind, we take refuge in the Three Treasures abiding in the ten directions.
We repent the sins of the six senses.
Since the birth of this bodily form, we have been stained by the dusts of defilement: the eyes beholding the five colors, the nose inhaling the five fragrances, the ears clinging to the five sounds, the mouth craving the five flavors.
Enveloping the body in darkness, we have committed manifold transgressions, weaving a net of offenses.
These accumulated faults are recorded in the ledgers of karma, causing us to encounter misfortune in life and endure bitterness in death. We must rely on the merit of the many sages to cleanse the sufferings of the nine dark realms.
Today, with purified mind, we take refuge and face the Heavenly Worthy, repenting the karmic conditions of our transgressions, and aspiring to the good fruits of the future.

Thereupon, the Heavenly Worthy addressed the Dao Lord, saying: "After this, you shall compose various scriptures and repentances for all living and deceased beings. All meritorious deeds have their proper sequence.
If there are beings who obtain this scripture, cleanse themselves with fragrant water, bathe body and mind, don fresh and pure garments, burn incense and light lamps, adorn with banners, flowers, and jeweled canopies, circumambulate in reverence, make offerings with joyful exultation, kneel with hands clasped, and maintain pure diligence in receiving, reciting, upholding, and revering it—
for all humans and devas who have not yet heard it, let them hear; for those who have not yet seen it, let them see.
If there are good men and good women who, out of devotion, offer material wealth to invite masters for repentance rites—even if one were to give alms of gold as vast as Mount Kunlun, filling heaven and earth, the merit would still not compare to teaching others a single sentence or verse from this scripture, for its words are an eternal treasure for the body.
Though gold is precious, it cannot protect this body; though this scripture is subtle, it bears the same fruit as life and death.
You, men and women, must not be deluded by ignorance, hoarding gold while begrudging its use, neglecting to cultivate merit, and thus harming yourselves. Such actions yield no benefit and only breed afflictions, perpetually scorching you.
If one wholeheartedly performs these meritorious deeds, all past sins in this life and beyond shall be eradicated. Wherever one dwells, there shall be joy and carefree ease, and in the Pure Lands of the ten directions, one may go according to one’s wishes.
If one leaves the household to make offerings to the Three Treasures, such merit is inconceivable."

All beings, having heard the scripture, prostrated in reverence, gazing upon the honored countenance, crawling on elbows and knees, raising their hands in devotion, and upholding the Supreme Dao with day-and-night diligence and sincerity, repented with utmost sincerity.
They prostrated to the Three Treasures abiding in the ten directions.

Having paid homage to the Three Treasures, we now proceed to repent.
With sincere mind, we take refuge in the Three Treasures abiding in the ten directions.
We now once more repent the sins of the six senses’ indulgence and defilement.
Our indulgence and defilement are most grave, accumulated and not light. Though we have confessed and repented, we still doubt that all has been exhausted.
Some are entangled in the net of karma, some bound by the knots of enmity and grievance.
The eyes crave beautiful forms, the mouth delights in fine flavors, the ears rejoice in the sounds of strings and bamboo.
The mind gives rise to love and aversion, the hands kill living beings, the feet tread the path of theft. Such sins accumulate upon our bodies.
The Five Emperors and Four Controllers impeach without fail; the Dark Bureaus of the long night interrogate without cease.
All arise from the causes we have created—how can we escape the retribution that must be repaid?
Relying on this repentance, may we attain dissolution and merging.
Life after life, may all enmity and opposition be forever removed.

The Heavenly Worthy said: If there are good men or good women who obtain this scripture yet harbor disbelief, failing to keep it pure—
Slandering it severely, treating it with constant contempt, opening it with defiled hands, reciting it with impure mouths;
Or interrupting it with idle chatter, or performing rites without reverence and focus;
Closing the scroll before completion, declaring it already finished;
Revealing its sacred teachings, deceiving and confusing the deluded, giving rise to arrogance and sloth, causing devotion to falter;
Or destroying sacred images, damaging numinous altars, disrespecting banners and flowers, failing to light lamps and candles;
Disdaining fasting meals, mocking and belittling the worthy and exalted, defiling the Daoist sanctuary, bullying the poor and lowly;
Disrespecting teachers and elders, failing to support kind parents, cursing the Three Luminaries, resenting the Four Qi;
Hearing good yet not gathering to it, seeing evil and immediately following it—accumulating such transgressions, they will incur dire retribution in the future.
Some will lose their eyebrows and hair, their bodies covered in sores, lacking sufficient clothing and food, suffering extreme humiliation.
Upon death, they will enter hell with no hope of release, enduring ten thousand births and deaths in a single day, ceaselessly tormented in darkness, never encountering pure realms.
Even if reborn, they will forever lose the human path, becoming one of the six livestock—oxen, horses, pigs, or sheep—hated in life, devoured in death.
Or as flying birds—owls, kites, turtledoves, or crows—though clad in feathers, constantly encountering omens and portents.
Or as scaled creatures, raised in ponds and pools, unable to comprehend change, only fearing drought.
Or as insects and mites, wriggling and tiny, born in heat, perishing in cold.
Due to such karmic retribution, they will forever lose the wheel of rebirth, like dust and specks of earth, cut off from transcendence.
Thus sinking and burying nine generations of ancestors, severing the seven lineages. If one wishes to cultivate the Dao, what use is repentance then?
All men and women here must reflect deeply: having attained this human form, each must revere and uphold it, maintain a heart of filial piety and reverence, and observe purity and fasting.
Day and night, be earnest and solemn; at dawn and dusk, be respectful and dignified. Thus may you secure peace and happiness in this life, ascend to heaven in past lives, avoid evil conditions, and encounter only good fruits.
Riding the tide of this repentance, listen sincerely and accept sincerely. Bow in homage and take refuge in the Three Treasures abiding forever.

The Sixth Scroll of the *Highest Venerable’s Compassionate Repentance for Delivering from the Nine Dark Realms* is now complete.

The Seventh Scroll of the *Highest Venerable’s Compassionate Repentance for Delivering from the Nine Dark Realms*

At that time, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy expounded for the Perfected of Universal Salvation, proclaiming the Heavenly Lord of the Dreamlike Qi of the Northwest, the wondrous Dao realm, the boundless land of beneficent adornment.

If, on the day of one’s passing, one wishes to be reborn in that land, one must purify oneself and observe fasting, invite a master to perform the rites, and invoke the Heavenly Worthy of the Northern Response.

Having paid homage to the Three Treasures, we proceed to repentance.

With wholehearted devotion, we take refuge in the Three Treasures abiding in the ten directions.
We repent for the sins of the five rebellions and unfilial conduct.

From the time we were bound in the cycle of rebirth and entrusted to the womb, our burden was heavy and difficult to bear, our breath ragged and unstable. Our parents trembled in fear, ever anxious over harm. When at last we took form, the ordeal of seeing us was fraught with peril. Such kindness in nurturing us—how can we ever repay it?

Yet we may have failed to revere our parents, even committing the five rebellions: answering with curses, resisting with defiant words, harboring anger to their faces, showing no obedience behind their backs. Our qi and nature were harsh and unyielding, our wisdom and insight coarse and shallow. We kept no close friends, only arrogance and pride. We offered no delicacies, performed no rites or music, squandering their toil and labor, failing to fulfill our filial duty. For all such transgressions, we now beseech absolution.

The Heavenly Worthy declared: If there are good men and good women who, in life, were unfilial but in death seek to repay their debt, reciting this true scripture will surely cleanse and wash away their sins.

Having heard this wondrous text, they must read and recite it with steadfast devotion, protect its purity, burn incense, uphold it with heart and mouth, bathe the body and wash the head, change their diet and attire. With unwavering diligence, their Dao-heart will grow, never slackening, ever filled with joy and gratitude. They will leap to observe long fasts, cultivate the heart and enter stillness, endure insults and receive the precepts, practice generosity and compassion, make offerings to those who have left the household, take refuge in the Three Treasures, release life and ransom lives, deliver and uplift the departed, cherish the elderly and pity the poor, show mercy to orphans and aid widows, extend aid to the destitute, revere and honor their parents. In all acts of kindness, they will be impartial and without distinction.

On the three primal festivals, the eight seasonal nodes, the jiazi and gengshen days, one’s natal hour, or any auspicious birthday, one may array solemn images, set forth fragrant offerings and fine delicacies, redeem transgressions before the assembled sages, and purge defilements from lifetimes past. Thus shall those departed find spontaneous transcendence, and those yet living receive boundless blessings.

Should one slight the celestial perfected and earthly sages, revile the sacred scriptures and precious canons, inflict harm without measure, or indulge greed and attachment to excess—serving as a disloyal minister, an unfilial child, yielding to unbridled desire, or speaking falsely while harboring deceit—one must then kneel before the Dao, openly confess, and repent. Thereby shall the crimson register record merit, and the black ledger erase transgressions. One ought to venerate the Heavenly Worthies of the ten directions, prostrate in long repentance, to dissolve the sands of offenses and attain immeasurable good causes.

With utmost sincerity, all turn in devotion and reverence:

Each with reverent heart, bows to the Heavenly Worthy who fiercely severs delusion.

Having paid homage to the Three Treasures, proceed to repent:

With devoted heart, take refuge in the Three Treasures of the ten directions, eternally abiding.

We repent the sins of the five rebellions and unfilial conduct. Though our bodies grow through skin and hair, they must not be harmed; though rites and conduct have their proper forms, our natures may fail to uphold them. We may lose righteousness and forget our kin, estrange relatives and turn from family, neglect reverence for superiors, or act contrary toward inferiors. We may grow distant from those close, or turn away from kin; harbor resentment and disdain, or nurture deep hatred. For such offenses and transgressions, how may we repent and cleanse them?

Then the Primordial Heavenly Worthy addressed the Lord of the Void and Sovereign of the Dao, saying: If there are good men and good women, from kalpas past to this very day, whose three karmic actions and five rebellious transgressions have amassed offenses boundless as mountains and peaks—without means to repent and cleanse, without encountering favorable conditions, they indulge in reckless speech, deceive their hearts, and betray the Dao. They slight the Three Treasures, slander the sacred texts, make distant vows, invoke spirits, and curse with spells; revile wind and rain, offend the three luminaries, fail to honor parents, and disrespect heaven and earth. Deluded and confused, they remain entangled for kalpas, and even when encountering scriptures and precepts, remain ignorant of repentance and purification. Desiring to transcend the pure realm, they do not enter the gate of deviation.

You good men and good women, if you can relinquish your family’s wealth, invite a master to perform repentance rites, maintain fasts and enter stillness, purify yourselves and cultivate the heart, prostrate in earnest prayer, burn incense and perform the Dao-circumambulation, scatter flowers and make offerings, uphold purity and adorn the altar—whether for distant ancestors or to deliver the deceased, to dispel calamities or pray for blessings, for the seven generations of ancestors or the nine lineages, for parents and siblings, for friends and kin, or for oneself and one’s family—all dark and unseen beings, all sentient life within the three realms—when you recite the above causes and venerate the names of the Heavenly Worthies, the departed shall attain liberation, calamities shall silently vanish, the nine generations of ancestors shall ascend, parents shall transcend, friends and kin shall prosper, family shall harmonize, unseen beings shall be kind and gentle, and all life shall escape suffering. Vast compassion shall universally shade, and gracious blessings shall pervade; steadfast practice shall strengthen, and good causes shall advance. Extending to the eight directions and reaching distant lands, residual karmic obstructions shall all be liberated. Listen carefully and receive without negligence or deviation.

All you men and women, exhort one another, maintaining consistency from beginning to end, so that inner and outer align. Advance with diligence and follow the practices; bow your heads and withdraw.

*Tai Shang’s Compassionate Rite for Deliverance from the Nine Hells and Expiation of Sins, Scroll Seven* concludes.

At that time, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, for the sake of the Perfected One of Universal Salvation, expounded the realm of the Five Qi Heavenly Lords of the Dark North—Dongyin, Shuodan, Yujue—and the Boundless Land of True Stability. Having finished, he further expounded the realm of the Heavenly Lord of Brahma Qi in the Northeast, the Land of Eternal Joy. Therein dwells a Perfected One, named Wondrous Sound, in the Boundless Land, resplendently adorned.

Should one, on the day of death, wish to be reborn in that land, one must purify oneself and observe a fast, invite a master to perform the rites, and venerate the Heavenly Worthy of the Northeast. Kneeling in repentance, one shall eradicate the sins as numerous as the sands of the Ganges and attain boundless good causes. The hun-soul shall be refined in the Vermilion Mound, and the spirit shall wander in the Purple Palace.

All of you, with utmost sincerity, prostrate and pay homage.

Having paid homage to the Three Treasures, proceed to repent.

With utmost sincerity, prostrate and take refuge in the Supreme Heavenly Worthy of the Northeast.

Repent the sins of receiving scriptures and violating precepts.

All of you, from kalpas immeasurable until this day, have cast off lives and taken rebirth, enduring manifold karmic retributions. Perhaps you have received the scriptures and precepts—the Three Precepts, Five Precepts, Nine Precepts, Ten Precepts, Twelve Permissible Precepts, Twenty-Four Precepts, One Hundred Eighty Precepts, or the Three Hundred Great Precepts. Whether received personally or witnessed others receiving them, you failed to revere them, constantly harboring arrogance, committing numerous transgressions, and slandering repeatedly. You treated them as mere play, never upholding them, acting contrary to their words, writing them without reverence, reciting them with errors, or altering the text. Perhaps you have read the *Shangqing Sutra*, *Lingbao Sutra*, *Zhengyi Sutra*, *Daode Jing*, *Xisheng Jing*, *Huangting Jing*, *Neiguan Jing*, *Taiping Jing*, *Xiaozai Jing*, *Bao’en Jing*, *Jiuyou Jing*, *Jiuku Jing*, or other scriptures and precepts. Whether reading them yourself or seeing others read them, you treated them lightly, without reverence, mocking the words of the sages and ridiculing the meaning of the Great Dao. Perhaps your offerings were incomplete, your protection lax, or the paper and ink of your copies inferior, the binding crooked, the scrolls askew. Perhaps you omitted sacred texts or altered their meaning, all due to ignorance, thus deviating from proper conduct. In this fleeting world, you have not yet encountered the opportunity to repent; now, having met the Great Dao, earnestly wish for all transgressions to be eradicated.

The Heavenly Worthy spoke: The transgressions described above are the most severe of all. If one does not repent and cleanse them, they shall forever lose the wheel of rebirth. Should death not yet come within the year, one will encounter malignant illness—frail in form, weakened in bones, breath faint and feeble, speech clumsy and foul, manners awry, movements unrefined. Or, having already reached life’s end, one will find no pure land, their wandering soul cast to the northern Mount Tai. According to the weight of their sins, they shall face retribution—endless suffering, no escape from the wheel. Countless torments, agonies beyond words, wails unheard, groans unanswered. Pain pierces the bone; heat sears the heart. Sword-trees tower a thousand fathoms, climbed in an instant; cauldrons boil a hundredfold, sinking without respite. The body dissolves, day and night unceasing—what refuge remains? No rebirth is possible. Such are the roots of sin, born of past deeds in mind and matter.

All you men and women, examine your hearts, diligently serve the Perfected, and seek future fruition. Offer repentance and rites, that you may enter the field of blessings. For those already departed, may they swiftly ascend to heaven; for those yet living, may they all attain peace and joy. Listen carefully, receive with sincerity, and cultivate according to the Dao. Before the Dao, repent with wholehearted reverence.

Having paid homage to the Three Treasures, we now proceed to repent.

With wholehearted devotion, we take refuge in the Supreme Heavenly Worthy of the Northeast. We repent the sins of breaking fasts and violating the Dao.

From the primordial kalpa to this day, we have cast off bodies and received new forms, enduring all manner of retribution. Perhaps we have undertaken fasts and rites, partaken of vegetarian meals, yet failed to cultivate reverence and faith. Whether the Upper Clarity Fast, the Golden Register Fast, the Yellow Register Fast, the Numinous Treasure Fast, the Three Primes Fast, the Northern Emperor Fast, the Eight Festivals Fast, the Ten Straight Days Fast, the Five La Fasts, the Gengshen Fast, or the Life-Destiny Fast—such fasts we may have personally established or received. Though we spoke their names, we lacked reverence, often violating their precepts. Perhaps we mixed in impure foods, cooked meat and vegetables together, failed to purify ourselves, acted with carelessness, ate after noon, harbored impure intentions, slandered the Perfected, equated them with the heterodox, spoke empty falsehoods, or lacked sincere devotion. Such are the roots of sin, weighed most heavily. In death, one enters hell, with no hope of survival. One may descend into Mount Fengdu’s Twenty-Four Hells, or the Hells of Supervising Heaven, Empty Heaven, Primordial Rectitude, Mystic Sands, Northern Edge, Punitive Rectitude, Statutes and Decrees, Nine Heavens, Azure Darkness, Heavenly Unity, River Earl, Accumulated Kalpas, or Female Azure—such are the Twenty-Four Hells. The Three Treasures, Five Numinous Spirits, Three Officials, Nine Bureaus, One Hundred Twenty Offices, One Thousand Two Hundred Clerks, and Fifty Thousand Divine Soldiers of Punishment shall seize and torment the sinful souls.

Some tread upon mountains of blades, some cling to trees of swords; some embrace bronze pillars, some lie upon iron beds. Their heads bear fire-mountains, their bodies bear iron staves. When hungry, they eat coals; when thirsty, they drink molten bronze. Some enter cauldrons of boiling liquid, some pass through furnaces of embers, crushed by pestles, ground by millstones, hung upside-down or sawn asunder. Some are pressed by boulders, pierced through by needle-points, their feet scorched by embers, their arms bound in fetters and shackles.

The Heavenly Worthy declares: for such categories of sin, retribution is clear and distinct. Should there be good men or good women who awaken to this sutra, their hearts generating faith and reverence, making pure offerings, prostrating in worship, burning incense, and beseeching the extinction of the Three Wretched Paths, the karmic burdens of the Underworld’s courts, the transgressions of countless generations of ancestors, and the departed spirits of the past—extending even to their own selves, their living kin, and the calamities and misfortunes that entangle them—then upon their supplication to resolve these afflictions, flying divine beings shall be dispatched, bearing the talismanic decrees of the Nine Dragons, traversing all hells to thoroughly purge and cleanse them. All shall be dissolved and eradicated, redirected toward the arising of the mind. Cultivating supreme goodness, they bow their heads in reverent submission to the ever-abiding Three Treasures of the ten directions.

*Thus concludes the Eighth Scroll of the Most High’s Compassionate Rite for Deliverance from the Nine Hells and the Expiation of Sins.*
*The Ninth Scroll of the Most High’s Compassionate Rite for Deliverance from the Nine Hells and the Expiation of Sins*

At that time, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Origin expounded to the Perfected of Universal Salvation, first describing the Lord of the Qi of Purity of the Northeast, the Realm of Everlasting Joy, the Boundless Land, resplendent in its adornments. Having completed this, he further expounded upon the Upper Realm: the Purple Tenuity’s Golden Gates of the Jade Capital of the Mystic Metropolis in the Heavenly Precincts of the Seven Treasures, the Three Clarities, the Three Realms, and the Thirty-Two Heavenly Lords; the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct, the Divine Immortals and Jade Maidens, the Boundless Land of Spontaneous Perfection, resplendent in the adornments of the Purple Empyrean.

Should one, on the day of their death, aspire to be reborn in that land, they must purify themselves and observe the fast, inviting a master to perform the rites, venerating the Heavenly Worthy of the Corresponding Appellation of the Upper Realm. Kneeling in repentance, they extinguish the obstructions of measureless kalpas of sins and attain boundless virtuous causes. Refining their substance and clarifying their spirit, they ascend to Perfection and awaken to the Dao.

All present, with sincere minds, prostrate in reverent submission and pay homage:

Having paid homage to the Three Treasures, they proceed to repent:

With sincere minds, they submit themselves to the ever-abiding Three Treasures of the ten directions. Your servants repent the sins of anger, ignorance, and delusion. From kalpas immeasurable until this very day, our parents, siblings, ourselves, and our kin—passing through births and deaths without shame or remorse—have given rise to minds of anger. Some rage against the Great Dao, their words lacking in rectitude and truth, uttering only vain and frivolous speech, perpetually devoid of faith. Some curse the heavens and earth, reviling the cold and heat, accumulating only foolish obstinacy, unashamed before the covering heavens and sustaining earth.

Some rage against the sun and moon, baring their bodies without shame beneath their radiance, ever complaining of their slowness or swiftness. Some rage against the scriptures, dismissing them as empty words, refusing to study or seek their meaning, and instead slandering them with deceit. Some rage against their parents, neglecting their service, devoid of filial devotion, repaying no toil or labor. Some rage against their siblings, lacking the bond of shared branches, treating them as strangers, their affection no deeper than distant friends. Some rage against their kin, failing to cultivate kindness and gentleness, disrespecting their elders, and lacking moderation in nurturing their juniors. Some rage against fasting and precepts, performing rituals without reverence, frequently violating them, their devotion and sincerity lacking. Some rage against their sovereign, failing to support peace and prosperity, harboring rebellious thoughts, and undermining the loyal and good. Some rage against sermons, refusing to listen to wholesome teachings, uttering only harsh words, and confounding truth with falsehood. Some rage against temples and monasteries, showing no reverence, slandering them excessively, and withholding offerings. Some rage against the departed, neglecting to perform memorial rites, failing to do good deeds, and offering no aid on their dark journey. Some rage against the divine order, forsaking prayers and sacrifices, heeding only heretical words, and engaging in licentious worship. Some rage against the aged and infirm, devoid of filial piety, never bestowing kindness, only contempt and disdain. Some rage against the six afflictions, lacking compassion, uttering only harsh words, claiming they suffer karmic retribution. Some rage against prisons, failing to examine the truth of words, perpetually speaking of hardship, and reinforcing their bonds and shackles. Some rage against the poor and lowly, oppressing them unjustly without redress, unmindful of their hunger and cold, perpetually inflicting suffering. Some rage against birds and beasts, heedless of their feathers and fur, indulging only greed and gluttony, seeking only to slaughter and feast.

The Heavenly Worthy declares: Such ignorance and anger give rise to profound sins. Without repentance and confession, one must sink into evil destinies. This causes the departed to be bound in darkness, the living to suffer illness, and all manner of enmity to converge. You, men and women, must each arouse sincere devotion. Today, before the Heavenly Worthies of the ten directions, bow your heads in submission, all seeking repentance and taking refuge in the Three Treasures.

Each person reverently and with sincere mind pays homage:

Having paid homage to the Three Treasures, they proceed to repent once more:
With sincere minds, they submit themselves to the ever-abiding Three Treasures of the ten directions. They repent the sin of killing living beings. From kalpas immeasurable until this very day, our parents, siblings, ourselves, and our kin—passing through births and deaths in countless forms, dwelling in the realm of human relationships—unfreed from desire, unmet by good companions, unguided by enlightened teachers, shaped by habit and tainted by defilement, have committed all manner of evil deeds, wantonly taking life. Some have killed cattle, sheep, dogs, roebuck, deer, foxes, hares, and other livestock, devoid of compassion, seeking only to fill their bellies...

Or else they slaughter wild ducks, geese, chickens, and the like; or with nets and snares, they ensnare all manner of flying birds; or with weighted lines and arrows, they cast to capture creatures of water and land—those with scales, shells, or fur; or they set mountains and fields ablaze, harming all beings with consciousness; or they dam streams and dig ponds, disturbing those in hibernation; or they shatter nests and crush eggs, dig into burrows to seize the young, causing mother and child to be torn apart, leaving no refuge for the fleeing. Some do this to fill their bellies, others kill without cause, day after day, month after month, weaving bonds of enmity. Some act themselves, others instruct others to do so. All such transgressions are beyond enumeration. Thus, calamity extends to kin, misfortune befalls oneself—some suffer shortened lifespans, others are plagued by chronic illness, sinking into endless night, forever beyond redemption. Such beings, through the accumulation of evil, without repentance and deliverance, how can their sins be absolved?

The Heavenly Worthy declares: The Dao cherishes life, and the Dharma broadly bestows deliverance. All who have committed such acts—whether departed from the human realm or surviving descendants—must urgently perform rites of salvation: sweep and purify the courtyard, bathe body and mind, invite Dharma masters, establish this sacred assembly, abundantly prepare incense and candles, array banners and flowers, gaze upon the revered countenance, recite sutras and repentance texts, circumambulate the Dharma seat, chant and intone the *Step of Emptiness*, lay bare the heart and liver, confess transgressions and seek forgiveness, pray with utmost sincerity, day and night without weariness. Then the departed ancestors will surely receive absolution, forever departing from darkness to enter light, their souls at peace, enmities dissolved, their spirits ascending to the Grotto Heavens, their essences refined in the Southern Palace, awakening to the Dao and ascending to perfection, with blessings born and misfortunes extinguished.

You, men and women, should listen carefully, uphold and practice these teachings, cultivate the mind of dedication, and ascend the supreme Dao.

*Thus concludes the Ninth Scroll of the Heavenly Worthy’s Compassionate Repentance for Deliverance from the Nine Hells of Darkness.*
*The Tenth Scroll of the Heavenly Worthy’s Compassionate Repentance for Deliverance from the Nine Hells of Darkness begins.*

At that time, the Original Heavenly Worthy expounded for the Universal Salvation Perfected One, addressing the Lords of the Thirty-Two Heavens, the Perfected Ones of Wondrous Conduct, the Jade Maidens of the Three Clarities and Three Realms, and the Celestial Worthies of the Seven-Treasure Mystic Terrace in the Purple Tenuity Golden Palace of the Jade Capital of the Mystic Metropolis in the Upper Realm. Having concluded, he further expounded for the High Sovereigns of the Four Offices of the Nine Lands below, the Twelve Immortal Ministers, the Perfected Ones of the Nine Palaces, the Jade Maidens of the Divine Immortals, and the Cinnabar Realm of Water and Fire. Among them is a Perfected One named Wondrous Conduct, dwelling in the Land of Ultimate Bliss, a realm of purity and adornment.

If, on the day of one’s passing, one wishes to be reborn in that land, one must purify oneself and observe the fast, invite a master to perform the rites, and pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the Lower Realm. Kneeling in repentance, one may dissolve the sins as countless as the sands of the Ganges and attain boundless good causes. The soul is refined in the Vermilion Mound, the spirit roams the Purple Palace. With sincere minds, all pay homage and bow in reverence.

Having paid homage to the Three Treasures, they proceed to repent.
With sincere mind, they prostrate themselves before the Supreme Heavenly Worthy of the Lower Realm, repenting the sin of theft.
We, from kalpas immeasurable until this day—our fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters, our own selves and our kin—have cast off bodies and assumed forms, undergone countless rebirths, and received manifold retributions. We fear that we have forsaken integrity and uprightness, giving rise to thieving thoughts.
We may have stolen from the Heavenly Worthy the great Dao, offerings of wealth, or even tridacna shell, agate, lapis lazuli, amber, luminous pearls, jade discs, copper, iron, gold, silver, brocade, damask, silk gauze, utensils, alms, vegetarian meals, rice, flour, incense, or oil—be it a single coin, ten coins, a hundred coins, a thousand coins, or even the tiniest grain, all incur grave transgressions.
We may have stolen the king’s property, breached treasuries, scaled walls, broken seals, forced locks, altered official seals, tampered with documents, diverted military supplies, evaded taxes or levies—be it a single coin or inch, whether little or much—neglecting public duty while seeking only personal gain. Such plunder and usurpation all entail guilt and fault.
We may have stolen funds for constructing temples and monasteries, offerings entrusted to Dharma masters, scriptures and their adornments, ritual vestments and their materials, items for altar offerings, fresh goods not yet presented, possessions cherished by loving kin, property of neighbors and villagers, belongings of the orphaned, impoverished, elderly, or infirm, flowers and fruits dedicated to the Three Treasures, offerings arranged by the ten directions, goods acquired through trade, seeds for sowing and planting, or any other property—whether stolen or concealed, regardless of quantity—all incur karmic debt. Never have we awakened to this; now we beseech its absolution.

The Heavenly Worthy declares: If there are good men or good women—past or present—who do not uphold the true Dao but instead give rise to deluded thoughts, making theft their priority, exploiting others for personal gain, accumulating transgressions of many kinds, harming their own lives and bodies, bringing calamity upon the nine generations of ancestors, extending misfortune to the seven generations of forebears, suffering from grave illness in life and descending into the depths of hell in death—when sins are tallied and merits weighed, retribution shall surely follow.
You, men and women, each reflect deeply, wash away past wrongs, perform repentance rites, uphold the scriptures, hold fast to precepts, and with diligent devotion offer repentance. Thus may your transgressions be dissolved.
Before the Dao, repenting to escape all suffering, with reverent mind they bow.

Each pays respect with utmost reverence.

With sincere mind, they bow to the Perfected One of Great Compassion, Great Mercy, and Great Wisdom.

Having paid homage to the Three Treasures, they proceed to repent.
With sincere mind, they prostrate themselves before the Supreme Heavenly Worthy of the Lower Realm, repenting the sins of destruction.
From beginningless kalpas until this day, we and our parents, siblings, selves, and kin—having cast off and assumed bodies in countless rebirths—have failed to emulate the loyal and good, harboring instead much destruction.
Some have defaced the images and forms of the Heavenly Worthies and the Great Dao; some have ruined temples, sacred altars, and numinous precincts; some have destroyed public halls and government buildings; some have damaged the great treasury of scriptures; some have broken the implements of offering; some have ruined altars to the gods of soil and grain and all manner of shrines, structures, and objects.
We have not cultivated devotion but have only accumulated harm.
The merit of construction is manifold, yet the thought of destruction arises with ease.
Layer upon layer of transgressions and faults—may all be repented.

The Heavenly Worthy said: “When the mind stirs and intent forms, there is good and there is wrong. In repaying virtue and requiting faults, there is blessing and there is misfortune. It is like sound and echo—how can the response be otherwise? Harsh words make the qi coarse; harmonious tones bring joy to the mind. You men and women, all must reflect deeply: reverence and faith come first, solemnity and adornment are foremost. If you can repent of wrongdoing, you must yearn for true perfection, diligently arouse the Dao-mind, and widely perform rites of scripture and repentance. Then the living and the dead alike will obtain blessings, the living and the dead alike will receive grace. Earnestly and sincerely, with utmost devotion, repent and reform.”

At that time, the Most High Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning was journeying through the worlds of the ten directions, radiating great light that illuminated all lands. With the Lord of the Dao of the August Void, he divided his body and descended to the world, seated upon a precious throne of azure radiance and divine light. For the Perfected One of Universal Salvation, he expounded the karmic affairs of men and women in the ten directions. When the discourse was complete, he vanished without trace, leaving no sound or shadow.

The Perfected One of Universal Salvation and all the men and women, moved by longing and sorrow, bowed their heads in worship. Reverently following the teaching, they practiced in due order. Thus did faithful men and women, bearing gratitude, wash away their stains. The dead received protection and ascended to the heavenly halls; the living obtained grace and dwelt always in the land of bliss. Thereupon yin and yang were harmonized, the state was at peace, flying insects soared by the power of universal deliverance, and crawling creatures relied on the kindness of life and growth. Thus the beings of the three evil destinies and five sufferings, the hungry ghosts and lonely souls, all attained liberation and were freed from bondage. Humans and gods looked up in gratitude; families and nations relied upon this refuge.

They bow their heads to the Three Treasures abiding in the ten directions.
The Tenth Scroll of *The Most High’s Compassionate Repentance for Deliverance from the Nine Dark Realms* is complete.
