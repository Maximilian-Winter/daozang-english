*The Supreme Lingbao Jade Casket Ritual of Illuminating Perfection: Rite of Declaring Merits*
Compiled by Master Guangcheng, Du Guangting

All officials, in accordance with their positions, lead the procession and ascend the altar. Reciting the "Entering the Chamber Spell," they offer incense to the Five Directions, beginning with the North.
Next, they offer incense upon the *Dong’an* altar, reciting the "Incense-Offering Spell," each bowing to the master and visualizing as prescribed.
Proclaiming the "Guardian Spirit Spell," they strike the ritual drum twenty-four times.

The Most High Three Heavens, the Primordial Three Qi of the Supreme Lord Lao, summon forth from within us the Three and Five Merit Officers, the Left and Right Attendant Envoys, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, the Golden Lads of Incense, the Jade Maidens of Transmission, the Direct Attendants of the Five Emperors, the Daily Attending Incense Officials—thirty-six each—to swiftly emerge and report at the first pass. The local Earth Gods and Domain Spirits of [such-and-such] place are urgently summoned to appear.

We now properly offer this incense, dedicating it to [so-and-so] who has undertaken the *Lingbao Nine Dark Realms Jade Casket Ritual of Illuminating Perfection for the Translocation of Spirits*. With the merit complete and the rites concluded, we ascend the altar to present the memorial, burn the true writ, restore offices to their holders, declare the merits, and hold the jiao offering, thereby reaffirming the power of virtue.

May the life-*qi* of the Supreme Ten Directions’ True Perfected Ones descend and flow into our bodies, that our petition swiftly reach the presence of the Most High Jade Emperor of the Limitless Dao.

Each performs three bows.
Each declares their ritual rank:

Disciples of the Three Luminaries of the Great Cavern of the Mysterious Capital of Supreme Purity, Supreme Three Caverns Dharma-Masters, officiating the *Ritual of Illuminating Perfection*.

We, the Lesser Manifestation of the True Person of [such-and-such] Peak and [such-and-such] Emperor, your humble servants [so-and-so] and others, now offer this incense. By this merit, may it be dedicated above to the Emperor, the Crown Prince, the Empress, and the Imperial Consorts, bringing blessings, prolonging prosperity, and securing the peace of the realm.

May the august spirit of the Emperor of [such-and-such] Temple ascend to roam the Jade Capital, transcending the celestial pole.

We now offer this incense, surrendering body, spirit, and life to the Supreme Lingbao, the Natural and Most True, the Unsurpassed Great Dao.
We humbly beseech the mysterious workings to bestow boundless grace, widely extending blessings.
May the immortals and spirits receive deliverance, attain ranks, and achieve perfection.
May the guardian Dao Lords of the carefree and supreme Golden Towers of the Seven Treasures’ Natural Palace forever unite with the Dao, ever responsive to the mysterious stirrings.
Before the Most High and Limitless True Dao of the Ten Directions.

Bow to the Ten Directions, beginning with the East; each kneels fully and surrenders in repentance.
Next, repent of the Three Karmas.
Three invocations.
Three bows.

Next, the true writ’s inner sound is gathered from the east, south, west, north, and center. The disciple holds the true writ above the incense smoke. The master faces the altar, strikes the teeth twelve times, and recites the incantation:

"Primordial Beginning Great Emperor, Supreme Jade Sovereign,
Universally proclaiming to the Ten Directions,
Unsurpassed and without superior, boundless divine realm.
Thirty-two Heavens, concealed rhymes of the sacred script.
Five texts conjoin qi, eight assemblies radiate light.
Today’s great amnesty spreads myriad virtues.
Names are fixed in the immortal register, inscribed in the Purple Chamber.
Cultivating the fast and practicing the Dao, blessings flourish and spirits ascend.
Dark passes brighten, the night of obscurity opens to illumination.
Transcending the Three Realms, resplendently attending the Celestial Emperor.
The imperial chart extends eternally, life and fortune without end.
Myriad perfected ones witness and protect; the Four Seas attain great peace.
Malevolent stars are swept away; within and without, all is secure and tranquil.
We entreat that this proclamation be fulfilled, as swiftly as the golden horse’s courier route."

The true writ is then placed upon the imperial desk, awaiting incineration with the memorial.

Reverently declaring the dharma rank:
Disciple of the Three Luminaries of the Great Cavern of the Mysterious Capital of Supreme Purity, Unsurpassed Master of the Three Caverns, officiating the *Lingbao* Rite of Bright Perfection, [Name] Peak’s [Name] Emperor, Junior Prognostications Perfected Person, your servant [Name] and others, humbly and earnestly re-present this petition to the Supreme and Boundless Great Dao, the Primordial Celestial Worthy; the Supreme Great Dao Lord; the Supreme Lord Lao; the Natural and Most True Numinous Treasure Celestial Worthy; the Greatly Compassionate Celestial Worthy Who Rescues from Suffering at the Sound of Cries; the Five Elder Sovereigns; the thirty-six divisions of revered scriptures; the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center; and all responsive and perceptive numinous worthies within and beyond the Three Realms.

We, your servants, have presumptuously received the profound commission and fortunately encountered the transformative power of the Dao. The Three Vehicles govern the course, the Five Qi radiate light. The true Dharma flows and spreads, universally delivering the hidden and manifest. Heaven and humanity rely upon it; the living and dead partake in its glory. Yet the great teaching, in its transmission of regulations, takes deliverance as its foundation. Above, it solely supports the state and assists the emperor, enabling the profound virtue to pervade and the divine work to extend throughout heaven and earth. The living and the dead share the same reverence; all sentient beings constantly receive salvation and protection. Moreover, in obedience to the enlightened decree, how dare we not report above?

Next, the memorial is read:
In accordance with the memorial’s sincerity, its meaning deeply delivers and uplifts. Reverently following the mystical model, we unfold and present it in the altar precincts. Burning incense and lighting lamps, we recite scriptures and practice the Dao. We humbly offer spiritual recompense, revealing the true writ. With the precious scripture of the Eight Assemblies, we disclose and illuminate the Three Realms. Timely, we visualize and invoke, proclaiming to the revered numina. Our thoughts soar to the Ten Flowers, our minds gallop to the Eight Poles. We hope to receive the mysterious gaze and universally descend vast blessings. As the ritual’s merit reaches completion, may our aspirations extend universally. May the assembled perfected ones return, their feathered retinues to the Great Void; may the myriad sages turn their chariots, scattering auspicious radiance across the Three Realms. Below, may they illuminate the long night, broadly delivering those beyond the Yin Pass. May the great fan of compassionate wind dispel all suffering and affliction.

We, your servants, in accordance with the ritual codes, prostrate ourselves in earnest supplication. Beginning on the [day] of this month, we have undertaken and revered the fast and offering, practicing the Dao and reciting scriptures, until its completion on the [day]. Now that the fast’s affairs are concluded, we summon and command the celestial immortals, earthly immortals, perfected persons, divine persons, the Five Peaks and Four Waterways, the Nine Palaces and Five Emperors, the Three Rivers and Four Seas, the sun, moon, and stellar lodges, the cavalry and mounted troops, all the celestial attendants overseeing the fast—those who tend the incense, the golden youths, the maidens who scatter flowers, the messengers who transmit and memorialize, the flying dragon couriers—as well as the numinous guests, their officials, the overseers of the fast, the guardians of the perfected, the four-directional inspectors, and the true officials who monitor and protect. Having announced and conveyed the commands, and having overseen the fast’s affairs, those who have labored diligently shall now be separately honored. With yellow silk and vermilion memorials, their merits shall be reported and their ranks promoted.

We, your servants, fear that our conduct may transgress the codes and obscure the profound mysteries. We beseech your pardon and forgiveness, and humbly bear the profound grace.

At the commencement of the fast, we invoked the Wisdom Upper-Grade Ten Precepts; now that the fast’s affairs are concluded, they return to their heavenly palaces. Should further Dharma rites be required, they shall be invoked anew. We respectfully submit this memorial and await your proclamation.

The fast’s affairs now complete, we reaffirm its merits, restore the celestial ranks, and present a memorial of yellow silk and vermilion script upon our altar, requesting its review.

Next, the memorial is read:

Recorded in the registers of office, we perform the rites of the *Lingbao Mingzhen* Great Fast. The humble Perfected of [such-and-such] Peak, [such-and-such] Emperor, and the Lesser Luminaries, your servant [Name], bows twice in reverence.

We humbly address the Supreme, Boundless Dao, the Perfectly Real and Spontaneous, beneath the Golden Gates of the Celestial Palace: born of base substance in the lower realms, we acknowledge our impurity and lowliness. Yet we have presumptuously received the Great Dharma, proclaiming its teachings to deliver humanity, aiding the living and the state alike. We serve the times with devotion, standing witness before both seen and unseen. Yet we have achieved no merit in the Dharma, and our actions often violate its statutes. Day and night, we tremble in fear, daring not rest.

We bow our heads again and again.

On the day we received the Dharma, we pledged before the Three Officials to assist the state and establish merit, to propagate the profound transformation of the Dao. We vowed that within heaven and earth, its teachings would spread, delivering the living and the dead, opening the Way to all. Now, by the sacred decree of the Emperor, we knock upon the gates of the Great Dao, offering prayers for the august spirit of [such-and-such] Temple’s Emperor, that he may attain sagehood, achieve Perfection, and ascend to the Celestial Treasury. Our words are sincere and earnest, laid bare before the sacred and divine. The brightness of our hearts shines forth, moving heaven and earth.

We, who have presumptuously borne the scriptures and presided over the Mysteries, tremble in awe at the imperial command. With reverence, we lead [number] fellow Daoist priests, presenting the ritual offerings from the inner treasury in accordance with the Mysterious Statutes. At [such-and-such] place, we have established the numinous altar, modeling heaven and earth, its four bounds and eight directions resonating with the Three Clarities. We display the Eight Assemblies’ True Writings and inscribe the precious characters within, serving as tokens for the gods of heaven and earth. We have performed the *Taishang Lingbao Jiuyou Yu Kui Mingzhen* Great Fast for [number] days and nights, prostrating ourselves in submission, baring our hearts in sincerest devotion before the Radiant Sun and beneath the Three Luminaries. We have pledged our fast with utmost sincerity, kindling lamps to continue the light, illuminating the boundless Nine Dark Realms and the profound depths of the Nine Earths, dispelling the darkness of the netherworld with radiance.

We offer this repentance for [Name], beseeching forgiveness for the nine generations of ancestors and the spirits of the ancestral temple. For all karmic entanglements and accumulated obstructions from past lives, we fear they may yet hinder enlightenment or lead to wandering in darkness. We rely upon the grace of heaven to release and dissolve them, to sever all attachments and awaken to the True and Constant. Thus may the Nine Lands be at peace, the imperial mausoleums secure. May souls be refined, viscera flourish, bathed in the yang essence to purge the dregs of yin. May the Five Spirits guard and escort them, ascending to the celestial halls. May they enjoy blessings in this life and gradually ascend the ranks of the Dao. May auspiciousness descend upon their descendants and extend to the state. May the imperial reign prosper, the royal enterprise endure. May the sagely court receive blessings, its longevity matching Mount Song and Mount Heng. May the Crown Prince and the various princes attain glorious protection. May the empresses, consorts, and princesses forever preserve their felicity. May the inner and outer ministers renew their fortunes. May the Six Directions be pure, the Two Luminaries radiant. May auspicious signs appear daily, and evil omens be eradicated. Should our prayers be answered, we shall forever cherish the grace of the Dao.

We now reverently burn the True Writings, scatter the ashes, and waft the smoke aloft to the various heavens. The celestial term is fixed, and we dare not delay.

For this fast, we have invoked the celestial immortals’ troops, the divine immortals’ troops, the flying immortals’ troops, the Perfected Ones’ troops, the divine beings’ troops, the sun, moon, and stellar constellations’ troops, the Nine Palaces and Five Emperors’ troops, the Three Rivers and Four Seas’ troops, each comprising nine hundred million cavalry. We have also summoned the thirty-two heavens’ overseers of the fast, the golden lads who tend the incense, the jade maidens who scatter flowers, the Five Emperors’ direct messengers, the couriers who transmit and memorialize, the flying dragon riders, the officials of the *Lingbao*, the mighty spirits of the Three Treasures, the local earth gods and territorial Perfected, and all those who monitor, protect, announce, and convey commands, who have diligently served the fast. All are arrayed in solemn attire, accompanying this memorial to the Mysterious Capital to receive their due rewards, to be promoted in rank among the Perfected, and to have their titles elevated to imperial ranks. According to their grades, they shall be appointed as Perfected, their ranks and stations made manifest, with no omissions, in accordance with the rites of the Supreme Perfected.

We prostrate ourselves and present a memorial of yellow silk and vermilion script, submitting it to the Nine Heavens.

We implore the Supreme, Boundless Dao; the Supreme Lord of the Dao; the Supreme Lord Lao; the Most High Mysterious Elder; the Ten Directions’ Spontaneous *Lingbao* Heavenly Worthies; the perfected and great sagely hosts; and the true lords and venerable masters to deign to review this memorial. May the celestial officials be commanded to examine and distinguish its contents with compassion. May the Most Sagely Ones shine upon our sincerity.

We, who study the Dharma, have yet to master its forms of reverence.

Fearing that our advancement or cessation may transgress the statutes, failing to conform to the proper rites, we dread being obstructed by the Four Controllers, seized by the Five Emperors, and accumulating a thousand faults and ten thousand sins. We humbly beseech pardon and forgiveness, that our former ignorance may be absolved and no punishment meted out. We implore the Supreme Ones to discern and heed our plea.

Your foolish servants, acting through the Direct Envoys of the Perfected Palaces, the Orthodox Unity Merit Registrars, the Left and Right Official Messengers, the Yin-Yang Spirit-Decision Clerks, the Scarlet Talisman Chariot Clerks, the Gale-Wind Post-Rider Memorial-Submitting Clerks, and the Flying Dragon Celestial Immortal Flying Couriers—each twenty-four in number—now take their posts.

Your servants, on behalf of [Name], have completed the grand fast of the *Lingbao* Nine Dark Realms’ Luminous Perfected Spirit-Transference and Salvation. Having raised the altar and transferred the ranks, we restore the celestial positions. To reaffirm the merit and power, we prostrate ourselves and present a memorial of yellow silk and vermilion script, submitting it to the Three Bureaus of the Supreme Ones, awaiting the decree and response.

We, [Name], with utmost reverence and trepidation, bow our heads and prostrate ourselves twice in submission.

To be heard:
Your servants, [Surname and Name], residing at [Temple Name] in [Prefecture and County], address the Formless, Nameless, Void, and Spontaneous Supreme Perfected Great Dao, the Most High Primordial Honored One before the Jeweled Jade Throne of the Golden Towers and Seven Treasures.

In the year of [Celestial Stem-Branch], on the [Day] of the [Month], we strike our teeth thrice and declare:
We reverently address the Supreme, Boundless Dao; the Three Supreme Ones; and the Ten Directions’ Great Sages. We now present this memorial, praying that the Merit Registrars and Attending Clerks be commanded to take charge of its submission, ensuring it ascends to the Celestial Treasury, is acted upon in due time, and, with held breath, is conveyed directly before the Supreme, Boundless Dao.

May all our requests be granted at once, all our summons answered promptly, all our petitions communicated, and all our transfers effected. Should any subordinate officials obstruct or intercept it, preventing the memorial from reaching the Supreme Ones, we entreat that they be recorded and handed over to the nearest authorities for punishment according to the celestial statutes, thereby upholding the heavenly decrees.

We prostrate ourselves, awaiting the response.

Next, the memorial is placed upon the altar. With the spirits invoked as usual, we rise, bow twice, and enclose the memorial in its case.

Next, we announce the Golden Register Life-Extending Tablet:
The Primordial Mandate of the Origin, the Golden Register White Tablet, and the True Talisman of Salvation from Suffering...

We now proclaim to the ten directions of the boundless worlds, to the Three Bureaus and Nine Courts, the One Hundred Ten Offices, the Five Thearchs’ Examiners, the Nine Dark Hells, the Mighty Celestial Enforcers, the Punitive Divine Soldiers, the Recorders of Life and Destiny, the Overseers of Merit and Execution, the Ox-Headed Wardens, and the Great Demons of the Three Realms:

For the salvation rite at this altar, we dedicate and deliver the souls awaiting deliverance, that they may depart the hells, forever leave the endless night, behold the light, have all sins washed away, and all grievances reconciled. By the merit of this Nine Perfected Wondrous Precept, we raise them to the heavens above, all in accordance with this proclamation.

Proclaimed in the year of the Great Year [X], month [X], day [X], at [X] altar.

Upon completing the recitation, the Dharma Master strikes his teeth nine times and intones the incantation:

Supreme Sage of the Primordial Origin, Exalted Spirit of the Jade Thearch,
The Jade Script proclaims the mandate, delivering the dead and saving the living.
The Golden Register’s wondrous precepts shield and succor the dark underworld.
The White Tablet’s precious talisman, the Nine Perfected Mystic Scriptures,
Dissolve transgressions, reconcile karmic debts, and bring peace.
The Perfected Savior from Suffering erases all punishments.
The Life-Recording Youth inscribes their names for ascent.
The guardian spirits of the precepts guide them to the courts of fortune.
Transcending the Five Sufferings, they ride the cloud chariots,
wheel through the cycles, and ascend to the Supreme Clarity.

After the incantation, the tablet is burned along with the true script memorial case. Two cantors raise their voices in praise, bearing the staff and holding the altar tray. They, along with the supervising patron, proceed to the Heavenly Gate to burn the memorial case, true script, and White Tablet. They then return to their original positions.

Next, we proclaim the Mountain Tablet, now reverently following the Emperor’s sacred decree to conduct the *Lingbao Nine Dark Hells Jade Casket Transcendence Spirit Clarity Grand Fast* for [X] days and nights at [X] location. Upon completion of the ritual circumambulations, the tablet is cast into the sacred mountain.

May the divine and transcendent ones soar to the Supreme Clarity and the Five Marchmount Perfected;
May the most divine and numinous ones deign to erase their sin records and inscribe their names in the Nine Heavens.
We beseech their presence at the sacred mountain, conveyed by the Golden Dragon Courier.

Proclaimed in the year of the Great Year [X], month [X], day [X], by the humble official [X] at [X] location.

Upon completion of the recitation, the document is sealed in blue paper and bound with the dragon talisman.

Then the disciples, holding the incense smoke as their guide, strike their teeth twelve times and recite the incantation:

"Darkness above opens to clarity, the Primordial Beginning oversees the true.
The Five Elders of the Supreme Emperor, the vermilion script of the Crimson Writ.
Heaven and Earth’s origin, governing the Three Primes.
Gathering qi to summon the assembly, hastening the ascent of immortals.
The exalted talisman’s decree, universally proclaimed to the ten directions.
Sun, moon, and stellar lodges; the Five Marchmounts and numinous mountains.
Above in the heavens, below on the earth, the great spirits of the hidden and divine.
Overseeing the registers of life, the Southern Three Gates.
Receiving the jade tablets, inscribing names in the cinnabar scrolls.
Erasing the records of transgressions, elevating them as imperial retainers.
Conducting the fast and performing the Dao, petitioning the Nine Heavens.
Reviewing the celestial charts, obliterating the roots of sin.
Liberating souls and spirits, transcending the gates of darkness.
Upon completion of the ritual circumambulations, the tablet is cast into the sacred mountain.
The Three Paths cease their accusations, the eternal night is dispelled.
Grudges dissolve, the earthly prisons find peace.
Fortune extends to great enterprises, blessings endure through heaven and earth.
Today’s supplication is heard by the myriad perfected.
We beseech the dragon tablet to bind the covenant with the true officials.
May our petition be conveyed by the Golden Dragon Courier."

Upon completion of the incantation, the assembled officials bow again.

Then the Water Tablet is read:

"Now, reverently following the Emperor’s sacred decree to conduct the *Lingbao Nine Dark Hells Jade Casket Transcendence Spirit Clarity Grand Fast* for [X] days and nights at [X] location. Upon completion of the ritual circumambulations, the tablet is cast into the watery abyss.

May the divine and transcendent ones, the Three Primes, endure together.
The Nine Water Lords, the Twelve River Sources, the Jiang, He, Huai, and Ji, the great spirits of the vast and frigid depths.
We beseech the erasure of their sin records and the inscription of their names in the Nine Heavens.
We invite their presence at the watery abyss, conveyed by the Dragon Courier.

Proclaimed in the year of the Great Year [X], month [X], day [X], by the humble official [X] at [X] location.

Petition text:

The perfected of the ten directions, the numinous immortals of Mount Taihua.
The Crimson Writ’s decree reaches even the unseen.
Ascending to the Nine Heavens, we petition for the descent of the jade script.
Sun, moon, and five stars; the Northern Dipper’s Seven Primes.
We address the Five Marchmounts, the numinous mountains of the four directions.

Upon completion of the recitation, the assembled officials bow again.

Then the Earth Tablet is read.

By imperial decree of the Sacred Emperor, a *Lingbao* Nine Dark Realms Jade Coffer Transcendence Ritual of Divine Clarity is solemnly conducted at [location] for [number] days and nights. Upon completion of the Dao-procession, the tablet is cast into the numinous altar. May the divine and immortal attain eternal life and transcend the world, soaring to the Upper Clarity, the Yellow Court of the Nine Lands, the Yellow Spirits of Wu and Ji, and the Five Emperors of the Earthly Bureau. We beseech the erasure of sins and punishments, petitioning entry into the Central Palace. The tablet records the names, and we pray our supplication be conveyed as stated. Transmitted by the Golden Dragon Courier.

In the year of [Tai Sui], [month], [day], your subject [name], holding office at [location], presents this petition:

Heaven and Earth unfold, the primordial qi divides and bestows its numen. The Three Origins coexist, the ten directions shine in clarity. The Five Elders hear above, governing death and presiding over life. Crimson script on cinnabar, the *Primordial Origin’s Upper Scripture*. Universally proclaimed to the earth below, the august spirits of the Nine Lands. Today’s supplication is laid before all, the myriad immortals secure their lives. Conducting the fast and performing the Dao, petitioning the Nine Heavens. Reviewing the celestial charts, obliterating the roots of sin. The Nine Lands brighten, souls and spirits are transcended. The Great Yin ceases its torments, the Six Paths attain tranquility. Grudges dissolve, ascending to the various heavens. Upon completion of the ritual circumambulations, the tablet is cast into the numinous altar. Fortune flows for a hundred million generations, the imperial enterprise endures. We beseech the dragon tablet to bind the covenant with the earth officials. May our petition be conveyed as stated, by the Golden Dragon Courier.

Upon completion of the incantation, the assembled officials bow again and cast the tablet upon the altar, into the celestial well, or bury it beneath the lunar mansion.

Next, the *Hymn of Casting the Dragon Tablet* is chanted to pray for transcendence to the Purple Palace.

Then the names and titles are recited, the deities are invited, and the libation is set forth.

Assuming the ritual roles, we reverently perform the *Lingbao* Rite of Illuminating Divine Clarity. Your subjects, the Perfected of [specific sacred peak] and [specific deity], along with the lesser transcendents, bow again in reverence.

We humbly invoke the Three August Ones of the Supreme Heavenly Thearch, the Heavenly Lords and Emperors of the Ten Directions, the Three Lights and Nine Radiances, the sagely hosts of the Three Realms within and without, and all numinous spirits.

May they universally descend with vast compassion, dividing their radiance to illuminate and witness. We, having inherited residual fortune from former lives, were born in this generation. We have presumptuously borne the sacred scriptures and received the teachings of the Mysteries. Our merits are lighter than dust and dew, our transgressions heavier than mountains and hills. Truly, we should restrain ourselves and cultivate rectitude, yet the Dharma permits us to open the path of transcendence, to assist the state and establish merit, to aid the Emperor and propagate the transformative power of the Dao.

Now, by the sacred decree of the Emperor, we reverently offer prayers for the exalted spirit of [Name], presenting gold-embroidered silks, incense, flowers, and ritual offerings. In strict accordance with the liturgical canons, we devoutly establish the sacred altar. We undertake the *Lingbao Jiuyou Mingzhen Yu Kui Qianshen Badu Grand Retreat*—a rite of ninefold darkness and radiant truth, the Jade Casket’s transference of souls—for [number] days and nights, culminating in perfection at [day] [hour].

We burn the true writs, dissolve the altar, and restore the spirits to their offices. The merit thus reilluminated, we perform the thanksgiving rite and proclaim the accomplishment. May this serve to repent and expiate [Name]’s transgressions, dissolve karmic entanglements, and release them from the dark nights of the underworld, ascending into the celestial halls. May their essence be refined in the Vermilion Mound, their spirit tempered in the Elixir of Cinnabar. May they ascend to the Great Ultimate, tread the Ninefold Purity, roam freely among the Ten Thousand Emperors, and feast in the company of the host of perfected beings. May they extend the blessings of imperial rule, bestow prosperity upon their descendants, transmit the phoenix lineage without end, and secure the grand design for myriad ages. May script and axle unite, earth endure, and heaven abide.

May pestilence and poison subside, calamities and misfortunes cease. May weapons fall silent, drought and flood be averted. May all within the four seas—barbarian and Hua alike—enjoy peace, and the dragon deities stand guard. May the imperial mausoleum remain eternally secure, the Central Yellow Upper Palace undisturbed. May timely rains and gentle winds prevail, and all living beings dwell in perpetual tranquility.

We humbly beseech the Three Officials to brush clean their registers and record the merit of this retreat. May the Five Emperors turn their chariots to witness this supreme blessing. We petition the celestial and terrestrial bureaus, the offices of the seen and unseen, to descend with protection and bestow auspiciousness, universally bestowing grace upon the four seas.

We, your servants, can scarcely express the depth of our earnest and reverent prayers. We bow twice in profound reverence.

Next, we burn the memorial and present the paper money and horses.

We again invoke the sacred altar, beseeching the descent of the inner and outer perfected spirits. The merit of the retreat we have performed is now complete, owing truly to the Three Treasures and their divine retinues, the responsive officials of the unseen realms. They have descended with vast blessings, fulfilling our sincere entreaties. We now submit this report for transmission, honoring the labors of the perfected officials.

We fear that our offerings may have been improper, our conduct violating the liturgical canons, our movements and bearing failing to accord with celestial propriety. We humbly submit this further petition, imploring pardon.

May the exalted perfected and sagely beings ascend to the Great Void. May the honored spirits of the Three Realms return each to their respective domains. May the attending officers and local deities who have not yet taken their seats accept our sincere offerings.

May the martial and civil officials of the yin and yang realms, the inner and outer divine hosts, assist the state and deliver the people, establishing merit and benefiting all beings.
