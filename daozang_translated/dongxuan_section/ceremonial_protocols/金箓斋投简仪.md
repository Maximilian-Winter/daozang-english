**The Rite of Presenting Tablets at the Golden Talisman Hall**

The Duke of Qinghe, Grand Officer of State, Guardian of the Right Chancellor of State, Concurrently Serving as Minister of the Imperial Secretariat, Grand Support of the State, and Holder of Two Thousand Nine Hundred *hu* of Fiefs,
**Subject Zhang Shangying**, in obedience to imperial command, revised the rites for presenting tablets:

Two-sided tablets for mountain-water Daoist halls.
In spring and summer, proceed to the **Wangwu Celestial Grotto** in Mengzhou and the **Jidu Water Palace**.
In autumn and winter, proceed to the **Sizhen Celestial Grotto** in Anqing and the **Taiping Caishi Water Palace**.

Upon the arrival of the **Dragon Tablets**, the subordinate Daoist sects shall assemble in proper **Weiyi** (ritual decorum) to welcome and receive them.

Seven Daoist priests shall be dispatched, among whom one—preferably a priest who has received the **Faqie** (ritual talismans)—shall serve as the **High Functionary**.

The **ritual intent** shall be declared either upon the hall’s altar or the ritual platform, where the **Daoist assembly** shall be established, and incense shall be offered.

The altar shall be purified, and **imperial water** shall be sprinkled.
The **ritual masters** shall chant the prescribed liturgy, maintaining **mindful concentration** in accordance with the Dao.

**Twenty-Four Beats of the Law Drum:**
The High Functionary Master ignites the furnace.
The Most High True Primordial Five Spirits Lord of Old—
conjuring the Functionary Messenger, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords,
the Incense-Bearing Attendants, the Three-qi True Gods—
opening the Three Heavens to the Most High Primordial Sovereign Lord of Old.

I now properly burn incense, reverently presenting the current Emperor’s jade altar rites concluded, the golden talisman fast completed.
Specially dispatched, [certain official] proceeds to [certain place] to offer the Dragon Tablets.
Reestablishing the ritual feast, I pray that the Most High’s Eight Directions’ True and Living qi descend into my body,
so that my petition may swiftly reach the Supreme Truth, the Limitless Most High, the Three Sovereigns of the Three Pure Heavens.

Bowing twice, offering incense, tea, and wine.

the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water,
the True Rulers of the Grotto Heavens, the Four Seas, the Mountains and Rivers, the Water Palace Dragon Gods,

I, of humble nature and filth, have by grace attained the Dao’s gate.
Sacred precepts and numinous scriptures—I have heard the lofty models,
propagating the Dao’s transformations, aiding the realm.
For all petitions, how could they not be heard?

Now the Emperor, gathering blessings and averting disasters, concludes the rites.
Specially dispatched, [certain official] proceeds to [certain state’s] grotto, sacred mountain,
to offer the Dragon Tablet and jade inscriptions.
In accordance with the sovereign’s edict, the ritual feast is renewed.
I pray that the multitude of saints descend, perceiving my sincerity and accepting it.
Granting my request, I humbly receive your divine favor.

With [certain official] and myself, in deepest awe, we kneel and bow twice, humbly petitioning.

Next, offering incense again, presenting wine, and bowing.

Next, offering incense, presenting wine again, and bowing.

「Next, I solemnly repeat the invocation of the sacred ranks.
With deepest reverence, I once again earnestly offer incense and petition the High True and Supreme Sage,
the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water,
the Dao-attained Spirits of the Mountain and Water Caverns, the Auspicious Abode of Jìng Lú,
the Dragon Spirits and their officials,
the Celestial Officials of the Four Seas and Eight Oceans, the myriad rivers and valleys, and the Water Palaces of springs and sources,
all the mighty and numinous spirits within this domain,
the Dao-attained Sacred Assembly—
may they descend upon this ritual feast,
and accept my sincere devotion,
their radiance flowing and their light reflected.

I humbly pray that the Emperor’s foundation be steadfast,
and the nation’s longevity match the heavens.
May all creatures, both animate and inanimate, benefit from his grace,
and the civilized and the barbarian alike receive his blessings.
May the sweet dew fall and auspicious winds gather,

May pestilence and calamity be repelled,
and fortune and blessings flourish abundantly.

repeating the offering.

Next, the Twelve Prayers.

Next, I burn the incense as prescribed,
and cast the written petitions into the Cavern of the Netherworld.
Next, I proceed to the Water Palaces.
Next, I recite the *Precept on Casting Petitions*.

I now pray to the True Ones in the Purple Palace,*
and announce my life’s end at the Sacred Hall of the Spirit.*

The Jade Maidens chant with melodious dharma,*
while the Golden Boys play incense on their celestial zithers.*
My written name ascends through the Nine Earths,*

**Translation:**

*"Respectfully, I submit to [the relevant authority] at [location], presenting the high-ranking Daoist official’s name and petition text, sealed as follows:*

**The Ritual Sequence for the Golden Daoist Register (Jinqu) Ceremonies**

*Your servant, Shang Ying, humbly receives Your Majesty’s imperial edict, which states:*

*"Beyond your mastery of literature and governance, you delve deeply into the Dao’s mysteries and exhaustively study the arcane classics. No text—whether the *Ruiji* or the *Langhan*—remains beyond your grasp. Indeed, the *Jinqu* ritual system is but an additional matter for your expertise.*

*Previously, I entrusted a few Daoist priests to examine the ritual framework of the Dao Assembly, cross-referencing it with hidden classics for correction. They have now compiled a draft for review. Upon inspection, numerous discrepancies were found. I have thus submitted it to you, requesting that in your leisure from governance, you carefully examine it, marking what is acceptable or not. Should there be unresolved debates, textual errors, or incomplete matters, you may annotate corrections and refinements accordingly.*

*Your servant, Shang Ying, kneels and prostrates, daring not to disobey."*

*The Emperor’s august and illustrious decree proclaims:*

*"As in ancient times, the sovereigns did not establish their rule without reference to Heaven, nor did they accord reverence to the Dao without foundation. The Yellow Emperor said: ‘To observe the Dao of Heaven and follow its movements is to exhaust its essence.’ Confucius said: ‘Only Heaven is supreme; only Yao followed it.’ Emperor Shun said: ‘The Mandate of Heaven is to be heeded at the critical moment.’ The Classics state: ‘Heaven is wise and clear; the sage follows its Mandate.’ The *Book of Songs* says: ‘King Wen ascended and descended, standing at Heaven’s side.’*

*Thus, in stillness and simplicity, there must be sincerity; in the subtle and elusive, there must be intention. The origins of fasting and ritual purification lie here.*

*Therefore, the *Natural Mystery Classic* expounds upon ritual frameworks, adapting methods to circumstances and dividing them into nine categories. Lu Xiujing codified them in his time; Du Guangting later compiled them. Emperor Shenzong revived the neglected rites, and Yang Jie edited them into a book. Your Majesty, continuing the legacy of your predecessors, has allowed your humble servant to refine and polish them.*

*Moreover, the Duke of Zhou established the ranks without omission, and King Xuan of Zhou performed no rites without divine efficacy. All measures taken to benefit the people and avert calamities were exhaustive. How much more so when Heaven’s vast and luminous symbols pervade all things! The Six *Xu* (voids) circulate and transform, while the people live their daily lives unaware. For those governing the realm, can this be neglected?*

*We honor the Thirteen Empty Celestial Sovereigns and the Three Primordial Lords of the Highest Dao—the true origins of the Dao. The Three Pure Ones are the Dao’s wondrous manifestations. The Jade Emperor of the Celestial Vault, the Thirty-Two Heavenly Sovereigns, and those who govern the cosmos and effect transformations. The Celestial Emperor and the Purple Forbidden Emperor are the Heavenly Sovereigns who manifest in the celestial realm. The Empty Celestial Sovereign and the Earthly Empress are the sources of the Three Primordial Cycles and the Nine *qi*.*

*Their names are numerous, yet they do not constitute the Dao’s essence. By thoroughly researching the scriptures and examining the Three Realms, we verify their truths without obstruction, neither adding nor subtracting by private whim.*

*The old rituals were disordered in sequence and lacked proper balance in complexity and simplicity. Now, I have reconsidered the nine categories, arranging the ranks of the saints, pruning superfluous names, and completing the ritual intent. They are as follows:*

1. *The invocation of a master—if not a true master, then who shall preside over the ritual assembly?*
2. *The assignment of officials—if not properly appointed, then who shall perform the ritual laws?*
3. *The conferral of precepts—if not pure, then how may one enter the ritual platform?*
4. *The proclamation of the altar—if not purified, then how shall the celestial saints descend?*
5. *The ascent through the Heavenly Gate—if not aligned with *Kuan* and *Xun*, then the circumambulation will be incomplete.*
6. *The presentation of petitions and tablets—if not sealed with the ritual seal and符, then how shall they pass through the Heavenly Gate?*
7. *The True Scriptures and Jade Tablets must be verified for correctness and alignment, corresponding to the *qi* of the Five Phases.*
8. *The Assembly of Wondrous Mysteries shall employ the ritual diagram of Sima Ziming from Mount Wangwu.*
9. *The Celestial Treasure Platform shall adopt the design of the Mysterious Platform, relocated within the hall to facilitate ascension and descent, and to welcome the arrival of the winds."*

*Let those who practice the rites study and master these carefully.*

*Your servant, Shang Ying, humbly records this sequence."*

The **Golden Talisman Hall**—the ritual for offering petitions is now complete.
