**The Supreme Cavern-Abyss Samādhi Divine Incantation Ritual for Fasting, Repentance, and Thanksgiving**
Revised and edited by Master Guangcheng, Du Guangting

**Repentance Formula**

We, your disciples, wholeheartedly take refuge and reverently bow to the Eastern Infinite Supreme Perfected Most High Supreme Unity Lord, the Three Caverns’ Heavenly Worthies.

Next, facing east, perform three bows and conclude the repentance.

We, disciples [so-and-so], respectfully perform for the [such-and-such] household the divine incantation ritual, reciting the scripture of the wondrous divine incantation and practicing the Dao.

First, we offer thanks for transgressions and sever demonic pestilence.
We pray for the peace of the state and household, and the protection of the people.
We burn incense and light lamps, contemplating the spirits and invoking the Perfected.
We dedicate our bodies, spirits, and lives to the Eastern Supreme Mysterious Elder, the Supreme Cavern-Abyss Samādhi Divine Incantation Three Caverns’ Heavenly Worthies, and all divine spirits.

We look up in gratitude to the Eastern Nine *Qi* Azure Heaven, the Grand Clarity Mysterious Origin Supreme Three Heavens’ Infinite Great Dao Supreme Lord Lao, the Supreme Elder, Heavenly Thearch Lord, Heavenly Thearch Elder, Great Thearch Lord, Supreme August Elder, the Thirty-Nine Perfected and Seventy-Two Sages of the Lofty Mysterious True Lords, the Nine Elders of the Immortal Metropolis, the Nine *Qi* Elder, the Primordial Azure Perfected of the Eastern Florescence, Jade Treasure High Dawn Grand Minister of War and Prime Minister Azure Youth Lord, the Primordial Elder Master of Immortal Perfected, the countless myriad layers of Dao *qi* and the Twelve Hundred Official Lords, the Azure Thearch of the Nine *Qi* Jade Gate Divine Immortals under the Great Clarity Jade Palace, the Four Bureau Perfected, and all the supremely sagely great deities of the heavens.

We look down in gratitude to the Eastern Realm of the Infinite World beneath the earth, the divine immortals and true perfected of the Five Marchmounts and Four Watercourses.

We beseech forgiveness and absolution for the [such-and-such] household, the patriarchal kin of both the living and the deceased.
For the seven emotions and five desires, the ten evils and six roots,
the accumulated sins and transgressions, boundless and immeasurable,
from this day forth, we repent and offer thanks, hoping all may be cleansed and eradicated.
May the household and kin of [so-and-so] enjoy prolonged fortune and life, and the safety of their dwelling.

We humbly pray that the Supreme One bestow grace, commanding the King of the Samādhi Incantation, the Celestial Warriors of the Nine Heavens, the Divine Soldiers of the Five Thearchs, the Maidens of the Ten Directions, the Red Bow Great Host, to capture and destroy the Red-Headed Ones, slay the Imprisoned Abundant Children, and eradicate all rampant pestilence, warfare, famine, epidemics, plagues, ghosts, and bandits.
May the true *qi* suffuse and refine, the primordial essence nourish and adorn, all beings enjoy peace, and all share in the Great Peace.

We prostrate and take refuge, praying for the gift of life and creation.
Proclaim the divine decree with awe-inspiring majesty, and carry out the divine incantation.

**Next, the prayer is recited:**

This exorcism incantation is recited in the manner of the *Guardian Spirit Incantation*.
Proclaim it with solemn and resounding authority, strictly commanding the ten directions to join in repentance.
Stand and recite this, declaring the divine decree with awe-inspiring majesty, so that spirits and ghosts may obey.
This must not be neglected.

The Dao says: In the Five Defiled Worlds, those who uphold the Three Caverns’ scriptures—
I dispatch celestial soldiers to follow and guard their forms.
Banish the ten-thousand-fathom ghosts of illness, driving them far from the gates and courtyards.
Seize and eliminate the five-colored *qi*, preventing all from spreading.
Official matters shall be resolved, and the sick shall recover with clarity.
Should any dare disobey this command, the Demon King shall capture and behead them.

**Next, the hymn is recited:**

Chant the hymn as in the *Step-in-Void* recitation.
Circumambulate once, uniting the ten directions.

In the eastern realm of *Fuyuti*, Goumang flourishes in azure hue.
Brahmā maidens wander the great void, their eight tones brushing the Jade Capital.
The Great Vehicle transcends the world, the Ten Perfected sport in the Purple Court.
Establishing blessings through the named fast, the long night is wholly illuminated.
The drum of the true Dao resounds, all demons are overthrown and toppled.
The Demon King comes to bow in submission, daring not to test but to be slain.
In the distant Eastern Florescence Heaven, nine dragons in cloud chariots welcome.
Good spirits come to guard the gates, warriors and myriad spirits converge.
Kin may thus abide in peace, no ghost dares to listen.
Together we magnify the supreme traces, journeying to the Purple Phoenix City.

With wholehearted devotion, we take refuge and reverently bow to the Southern Infinite Supreme Perfected Most High Supreme Unity Lord, the Three Caverns’ Heavenly Worthies.

Next, facing south, perform three bows and conclude the repentance.

We, disciples [so-and-so], respectfully perform for the [such-and-such] household the divine incantation ritual, reciting the scripture of the wondrous divine incantation and practicing the Dao.

First, we offer thanks for transgressions and sever demonic pestilence.
We pray for the peace of the state and household, and the protection of the people.
We burn incense and light lamps, contemplating the spirits and invoking the Perfected.
We dedicate our bodies, spirits, and lives to the Southern Supreme Mysterious Elder, the Supreme Cavern-Abyss Samādhi Divine Incantation Three Caverns’ Heavenly Worthies, and all divine spirits.

We look up in gratitude to the Southern Three *Qi* Cinnabar Heaven, the Supreme Clarity Southern Culmen August Supreme Lord Lao, the Cavern Numinous Jade Thearch, the Upper Prime Controller, the Three Primes’ Sages, the Primordial Elder Mysterious Perfected, the Myriad Blessings Elder, the Southern Prosperity Upper Palace Life-Administering Minister of War, the Supreme Ultimate Perfected, the Grand Harmony Elder, the Mysterious Harmony Heavenly Red Thearch, the Cinnabar Numinous Lofty Immortals and Myriad Perfected, and all the supremely sagely great deities of the heavens.

We look down in gratitude to the Southern Realm of the Infinite World beneath the earth, the divine immortals and true perfected of the Five Marchmounts and Four Watercourses.

We beseech forgiveness and absolution for the [such-and-such] household, for the sins of the three karmas and six emotions, and the transgressions of violating scriptures and precepts.
May the myriad categories and thousand conditions all be resolved.
May the living and deceased of the [such-and-such] household enjoy steadfast auspiciousness, and all calamities and epidemics be forever dispelled.

We humbly pray that the Most High may bestow grace, commanding the maidens of the ten directions, the Celestial Ding warriors, the Black-Mystery Heavenly Slayer Great Soldiers, the Red Conscript Lesser Officers, the Masters of the Ten Directions, to seize and expel the demonic plague chieftain Wei Duqiao, the Wutu Lunna Wuhuan ghosts, and all their subordinate minor spirits. Release all afflictions—illnesses, chills and fevers, pestilential malaria, cholera with vomiting and diarrhea, and every kind of malevolent specter, disaster, and epidemic ghost—driving them swiftly into dispersal. Gather the poisons and withdraw the pestilence, returning each to its proper place. May the people’s sufferings and hardships all be cured and dispelled. May the true qi suffuse and nourish, the primordial harmony foster and nurture, and the myriad people rejoice in peace. May all receive the bounty of the Dao’s grace, as we proclaim the divine incantation.

The incantation declares:
The Dao commands all spirits,
Demon sons and demon daughters,
Whoever receives Our scripture,
You must aid and protect them.
Let the Four Spirits not approach,
Make the hundred ghosts swiftly depart.
Meng Da seizes plague and disaster,
Born as if freed from the snares of the world.
Officials dissolve illness and remove it,
We shall promote and exalt you.
If you still dare harm people,
The true qi will naturally shield them.

Next, the hymn intones:
The Lord of the Southern Flame Thearch,
Whose eight frontiers are called Jambudvīpa,
Rides a flying chariot drawn by cloud-borne steeds,
As the Ten Perfected Immortals wander.
The Mysterious Woman sings upon the clouds,
Her golden radiance overflowing her cinnabar form.
Today the Dharma-wheel turns,
Its Brahmanic resonance shaking the nine peaks.
The Heavenly King commands the demon soldiers,
The winds cease and the rains naturally subside.
Resplendent, the Three Luminaries shine,
While all evil spirits deeply conceal themselves.
Should any dare to test this,
The sword-bearing warriors shall sever their heads.
Demon kings and myriad demon princes,
Ghost-slayers shall come to execute them.
As the great fast and mighty spirits arise,
The demons and specters are gathered in turn.
Let none show mercy to another,
As the great Dao’s upright qi flows forth.

With utmost sincerity, we prostrate and take refuge, reverently bowing to the Western Direction’s Infinite Supreme Most High Perfected Supreme Unity Lord, the Three Caverns Heavenly Worthies.

Next, facing the West, we perform three bows and conclude the repentance.

Your servants [so-and-so] and others, on behalf of the [such-and-such] household, respectfully perform the divine incantation ritual, reciting the *Scripture of the Divine Incantation’s Wondrous Turning*. First, we express gratitude for transgressions, severing and cutting off demonic pestilence. We purify and pacify the dwelling, safeguarding the household. Burning incense and kindling bright lamps, we contemplate the spirits and meditate upon the Perfected, surrendering body, spirit, and life to the Western Direction’s Supreme Mysterious Elder, the Most High Cavernous Samādhi Divine Incantation Three Caverns Heavenly Worthies, and all divine spirits.

We look up in gratitude to the Western Direction’s Seven Qi White Heaven Supreme Clarity Western Florescence Lofty August Emperor, the Supreme Numinous Primordial Elder Lord; the Supreme Treasure Queen, Holy Thearch of Supreme Simplicity; the Lords of the Three Origins; the Seven Supreme Harmonies of the Golden Watchtower and Jade Perfected; the Western Numinous Metal Mother; the White Thearch Lofty Immortals; the Perfected of the Four Poles; and all the supremely sagely great deities of the heavens. We look down in gratitude to the divine immortals and true perfected of the Western Realm of the Infinite World beneath the earth, the Five Marchmounts and Four Watercourses.

We beseech forgiveness and absolution for the [such-and-such] household, for the offenses of this present life—those of body, mind, mouth, and intent—whether self-committed or taught to others, and the dust-like karmic burdens. May all be dissolved and removed. May the [such-and-such] household’s pestilential poisons vanish, and may all enjoy tranquility and peace.

We humbly pray that the Most High may bestow grace, commanding the Great Soldiers of the Nine Heavens, the armored conscripts of the ten directions, the Red Slayer Warriors, the Red-Riding Merit Officers, and the Great Expelling General to seize and expel the Xinling Red Crow demons and specters, the ghosts of the living and dead, the spirits of tombs and graves, the chieftain Du Nu Wuliuzi, the Red-Eyed Horned Ghosts, and all such beings, sweeping them away and severing the plague’s roots. May all illnesses and afflictions immediately vanish and be fully cured. May the true qi moisten and adorn.

May the hundred bones rest in peace. Reverently bearing the grace of the Dao, we proclaim the divine incantations.

The incantation says:
The Dao Lord commands all malevolent spirits below the world—
In the year of *renwu*, the cycle of *jiaxu*,
Red sands slaughter cattle and horses, the Wuwan cut short the people’s lives.
Those who receive the scriptures and wear the registers,
The heavenly soldiers shall guard their bodies.
The dead generals shall drive away the visiting ghosts,
The mighty warriors shall admonish their kin.
If you do not obey our teachings,
You shall bear stones and pile them by the night river.

The hymn says:
The spirit of the Western Harvest, named Gou Ni,
The Three Luminaries and the Mysterious Void,
Brightly illuminating the four directions.
The thirty-two tones of the eight sounds,
The demonic and perverse *qi* shall retreat of themselves.
Today we establish the fortune-bestowing fast,
Lighting lamps to illuminate the empty radiance.
The wind ceases, the rain does not fall,
Slaying demons and binding wickedness.
Defeated are the ghosts who dare to test,
Bound and sent to the celestial mechanism.
Practicing the Dao removes the ten thousand evils,
The merit and virtue are most towering.
The Dao and its power are most refined,
The sagely might revives the dead.
The hundred demons return to the one true,
To whom shall blessings be added?
Reverently return and follow the Great Dao,
Accumulating goodness, the spirits shall naturally return.
The foolish cannot learn,
The wise ever depend upon it.
Not begrudging wealth or body,
They aspire to ride the void and fly.
With utmost sincerity, we take refuge and bow,
Reverently paying homage to the Most High and Perfect Supreme Great Unity Lord of the Three Caverns, the Heavenly Worthies of the North.

Next, facing north, we perform the three bows and conclude the repentance.

Your servants, so-and-so and others, respectfully perform the divine incantations and recite the wondrous scripture of the divine incantations for the such-and-such household.
First, we confess our transgressions and sever the demonic pestilence,
Purifying the dwelling and protecting the household.
Burning incense and lighting lamps,
We contemplate the spirits and meditate upon the true.
Returning body, spirit, and life.

We humbly pray that the Most High may bestow grace, absolving the such-and-such household, its seven generations, living kin, and six relations.
For disloyalty and unfiliality, lack of love and compassion,
For killing, theft, deviance, and lust, harsh speech and double tongues,
For frivolous and reckless words, anger, stinginess, and greed,
Sins as high as mountains, too numerous to recount—
Through today’s merit and virtue, may all be absolved and removed.
May the such-and-such household’s epidemics and illnesses vanish, and may all enjoy rest and peace.

We humbly pray that the Most High may bestow grace, commanding Song Jiu, the General of Literary Prosperity, the Wind and Water Generals, the Four Heavenly Kings, the Red and Radiant Celestial Capital Warriors, Huang Ying, and others,

May the pestilential poisons, epidemics, and all ghosts be dispersed,
The dwelling purified, and the ten thousand fortunes secure in peace.
Reverently bearing the grace of the Dao, we proclaim the divine incantations.

The incantation says:
The Most High has true words,
Commanding all demonic and spectral ghosts.
The violent and disorderly, the White-Headed,
The cold and heat, the tails of pestilence—begone!
They usually dwell in trees and stones,
Or cling to mountains and waters.
Those who wear the talismans, enlightened masters,
Men and women who receive the registers,
Recite the scriptures to resolve official entanglements,
Establish fasts to cure illnesses.
How dare the demonic defy?
They shall be cut down and not spared.

The hymn says:

In the northern realm of Yüdanuyue, the four seasons unfold without earthly bounds.
It is named the Mysterious Heaven, riding the void to trace the dark celestial tracks.
Today we establish the great fast, forbidding all evil ghosts.
Should any dare to test this decree, they shall wander and perish where they stand.
By the golden edict of the Most High, by the mandate of the Jade Emperor and the Dao Lord,
A thousand demons naturally submit; ten thousand evils—how could they compare?
Now we conjure the demon kings, and every petty ghost trembles in dread.
Should any refuse to depart, the Heavenly Soldiers shall descend to seize them.
Consigned to the Three Celestial Courts, not a single evil may remain.
Each is commanded thus: the winds shall cease, the rains shall still.
Those who defy this law and decree shall have their heads struck off by the celestial officers.

With utmost sincerity, we turn and submit, reverently bowing to the Boundless Most High Perfect and True Supreme Great Unity Lord, the Three Caverns’ Heavenly Worthies of the northeast.

Next, facing the northeast, we perform the triple bow and conclude the repentance.

The incantation says:
The Elder Lord expounds the supreme teaching to dispel the Middle Kingdom’s calamities.
On wùyín, it is called Aconite; on gēngyín, it is named Great Thunder.
You Lian presides over strife; Hao Jing drains wealth.
At the first utterance of the divine incantation, the bodies of ghostly thieves are shattered ten thousandfold.
Gold and iron advance to execute; fire bells press from the rear.
Hasten a thousand miles away—do not dare to linger even briefly.

The hymn says:

The son of the northeast, Gèn, is named Wénlíng.
His dark radiance illumines all, as he establishes fasts to deliver sentient beings.
The fast’s covenant spans a thousand ages; he builds merit and roams the Phoenix City.
Delivering the dead and rescuing those adrift on winds and waves, he seeks stillness to preserve his form.
He kindles lamps to illuminate the Three Luminaries—let no wind arise.
The Most High commands the demon kings, bidding all wind and rain to cease.

The incantation says:
The Elder Lord issues a luminous decree, commanding all within the Middle Kingdom.
Great ghosts and lesser ghosts, demon kings and evil kings—
after the year jiǎxū, human fortunes wane while ghostly thieves grow strong.
In the ninth month, Tú Lúnnà; the Three Heavens summon Gōupó Qiāng.
Those who recite scriptures and uphold registers—specters and demons manifest their forms.
The Most High bestows the true Dharma to eradicate all calamities and misfortunes.

The hymn says:
The spirit of the southeast, Xùn, roams the rivers under Heaven.
The Nine Rivers shake the Four Seas; the Five Peaks drive away your illnesses.
The Perfected open the Ten Directions, establishing fasts to still the dark waves.
No demon dares arise; all demons are restrained and commanded.
If there are malevolent ghosts, behead them and consign them to Xūtuóluó.
The Three Officials dare not stir, adhering to the statutes of the *Nǚqīng*.

The Perfected of Clarity wield crimson rods, growing like green grass.
Hear the incantation and depart swiftly—linger, and your skulls shall be split.

The hymn says:
The mother of the southwest, Kūn, subdues spirits and reports to the Celestial Court.

The red pestilence dies with the incantation; black *qi* retreats at its sound.
Do not disturb the human realm, nor recklessly assail our righteousness.
Swords shall sever your forms, cutting you to pieces without resistance.

The nine *qi* unite as one; the five poles gather all beings.
Today we establish the fast and chant, lighting lamps to illumine the mysterious stars.
The Three Luminaries shine upon the *Tuóluó*; the long night grows bright and clear.
Mysterious light illumines all—we pray for blessings to deliver all beings.
Accumulating merit to ascend as immortals, we sever the kalpa’s demonic armies.
All winds and dust are cut off; trials bind the forms of ghosts.

Plagues, illnesses, official and private disputes, slander, and harm—
we fear being ensnared and not delivered.
Turning our hearts to the Utmost Dao, we establish the fast and pray for blessings.
First, we confess for the living and the dead: ten thousand sins, a thousand transgressions, defilement of the Three Luminaries.
We humbly pray that the Great Dao descend its numen, that the myriad heavens grant protection.
May these merits flow to the household, to the living and the dead, to the seven generations of kin—
all delivered from the dark night, emerging into light.
Above, may they ascend through transformation as immortals; in the middle, may they roam as spirits in the earthly realm; below, may they be reborn among humans.
At the gates of kings and lords, may they encounter the Three Treasures and forge bonds of goodness.
May blessings and fortune be transmitted, attaining immortality and flowing to the household.
For the honored and the humble, the elder and the young—
all afflictions, chronic illnesses, pestilential winds, cold poisons, epidemics, and seasonal plagues—
may they all be healed.
May medicine prove effective, bringing health within and without.
May the five viscera be harmonized, the six bowels flow freely.
May the nets of entanglement be untied, calamities and misfortunes delivered.
May years be added to our lifespan, longevity extended without limit.
May our paths in the world shine brightly, ranks and emoluments ascend.

Within, may they serve as ministers and chancellors; without, may they govern the provinces.
In reverence toward superiors and compassion toward inferiors, may all conduct be marked by awe.
May they forever preserve primal harmony, their every endeavor meeting with accord.

We humbly pray that the Most High bestow grace,
that the Yellow Efflorescence Valiant Warriors, the Orthodox Unity Functionaries and Messengers,
the Nine Heavens’ Great Hosts, the Heavenly Maidens of Jade,
seize and bind Yingnü, Penzi, the Red-Headed Demons, the Red Ding Fire Ghosts,
the Red Cord White Underlings, the Red Capital Ghosts, and all such beings,
commanding their utter annihilation and eradication.
Thus may the upright qi settle in peace, all people be pure and refreshed,
and households dwell in safety, ever beholden to the sagely favor.

Proclaiming the luminous majesty, we reverently recite the divine incantation.
The incantation declares:

The Heavenly Worthy’s radiant teaching—
ghosts and spirits must heed.
Luoweng and Daye,
Huayuan and Xiaoling,
let Jiaozi henceforth cease,
let Dunu no more arise.
The Cavern Abyss Retreat now established,
the qi of rebellion and perversity must be stilled.
Those who remain defiant and unyielding—
bind them with red cords,
split their heads into ten thousand pieces,
let their fat flow and blood congeal.

Next, the hymn intones:

Above, the boundless heavens of the Highest Realm,
the majestic Three Luminaries unfold their splendor.
Today we cultivate the field of blessings,
lighting lamps to illumine the Mystery.
The distant qi of the Nine Heavens,
the graceful descent of Ma Gu—
riding the void, driving the six dragons,
the Heavenly Maidens attend the Emperor’s Husband.
The Demon Kings halt wind and rain,
the Most High’s decree is no falsehood.
Revering the sublime and wondrous scripture,
naturally we feast from the celestial kitchens.
Great waters flood the kalpas,
yet Daoists wander the celestial thoroughfares.
Naturally distinct from the vulgar,
they glide over water like dragons and fish.
Carefree, they enter the Purple Chamber,
lingering as they return to the Great Nothingness.

With utmost sincerity, we prostrate and take refuge,
paying reverence to the Most High, Utmost Real, Supreme, Supreme Unity Lord,
the Three Caverns’ Heavenly Worthies of the Lower Realm.

Next, facing the earthly portal of the lower realm, we bow thrice and conclude the repentance.

Your servants, so-and-so, respectfully perform for such-and-such household
the recitation of divine incantations and the circumambulation of the wondrous scripture.
First, we confess transgressions and sever demonic pestilence,
purifying the dwelling and safeguarding the household.
Burning incense and kindling lamps, we meditate on the spirits and contemplate the Real.
We dedicate body, spirit, and life to the Seventy-Two Marshes’ Supreme Mysterious Elder,
the Most High Cavern Abyss Samādhi Divine Incantation’s Three Caverns’ Heavenly Worthies,
and all divine numina.

Gazing upward, we give thanks to the Mysterious Yellow Heaven’s
Most High, Boundless, Formless, Measureless, Innumerable Great Dao’s
Nine Hundred Ninety-Nine Thousand Nine Hundred Million Qi-Heaven Elders;
the Nine Heavens’ Mysterious Mother; the Supreme Yellow Primordial Lord;
the Nine Heavens’ True Elder; the Jade Void August Elder Lord;
the Supreme Ultimate Perfected; the Yellow Elder and Yellow Emperor;
the Yellow Elder Heavenly Beings; the Primordial Yellow Central Emperor;
the Five Elders and Upper Immortals; and all the Most Exalted Sage Deities of the Heavens.

Below, we give thanks to the nether regions of the boundless world,
the Five Marchmounts, the Four Streams, and the divine immortals of true perfection.

We beseech forgiveness and absolution for such-and-such household,
all its members, young and old, the seven generations of ancestral spirits,
parents and teachers, the six relations and kin, and all sentient beings.
From kalpas past to the present life,
through the three karmas and six senses,
we have committed manifold transgressions,
defiled mountains and waters, and offended the numinous deities.
We have faced retribution in the dark realms,
bringing upon ourselves calamities and misfortunes.
Through this repentance, we humbly pray for their complete eradication.
May the living and deceased of such-and-such household attain blessings
and forever be free from disasters and misfortunes.
May the honored and the humble, the elder and the young,
find all chronic illnesses universally dispelled,
all limbs harmonized, and years and longevity increased.
May fortune and emolument shine brightly, health prevail within and without.
May dwellings be pure and secure, all directions prosper in harmony.

We humbly pray that the Most High extend grace,
that the true numina descend with protection.
We command the wardens of the ten directions,
the Great Brahmā Heavenly King, the Eight Divisions’ Censor Officers,
the Great Illuminator Overseer Spirits, the Executioner Messengers,
the Heavenly Ding Valiant Warriors,
to seize and capture Wuhuan, Huangnu, Lianzi, Chisuo,
the Great Ghost Headran, the Hundred Offerings’ Xuanzidu,
and all ghosts of toxic illnesses and miscellaneous maladies.
May all calamities and misfortunes be commanded to extermination,
all demonic perversities and pestilential bandits utterly eradicated.
Ever beholden to the boundless grace of vast deliverance,
we proclaim the luminous majesty and enact the divine incantation.

The incantation declares:

The Heavenly Worthy’s true and pure Dharma
governs ghosts and protects all beings.
On Jiazi, the myriad illnesses descend;
on Renchen, the hundred million ghosts roam.
The Yellow Pestilence, Zhong Shiji;
the Red Toxin, Xiahou Ying—
hasten to depart from walls and paths,
dare not linger near gates and courtyards.
I possess ten generals,
their eyes like shooting stars,
unceasingly watching for ghosts day and night,
crushing them to pieces without whole form.

Next, the invocation intones:

Below, the boundless kalpas stretch into darkness;
above, we gaze upon the Three Heavens,
where the Three Luminaries shine brightly.
Today we kindle lamps,
the Ten Perfected restrain the Demon Kings.
Let winds be still, rains cease,
as Daoists wander the Emperor’s realm.
The Jade Maidens awaken the Three Luminaries,
the Six Perfections behold the Supreme August One.
Today the Dharma Masters assemble,
the divine immortals shake the ten directions.

With utmost sincerity, we prostrate and take refuge,
paying reverence to the Most High, Utmost Real, Supreme, Supreme Unity Lord,
the Three Caverns’ Heavenly Worthies of the Central Realm.

Next, facing the southwest human portal, we bow thrice and conclude the repentance.

Your servants, so-and-so, respectfully establish the retreat and perform the Dao for such-and-such household,
to heal illnesses, expel demonic pestilence, and avert calamities.
Through these meritorious deeds, we beseech forgiveness for the living and deceased of such-and-such household,
their thousand transgressions and myriad sins, all to be absolved.
We command the Heavenly Ding of the ten directions and the thirty-six Heavenly Valiant Warriors
to shield and protect the six relations of such-and-such household, young and old, male and female, noble and base.
Wherever they extend their protection,
we forbid all pestilential ghosts from causing disturbance.
Seize and eradicate the cloud-borne Li Ziao of untimely death,
the human-shaped spirits of livestock that perished in flight,
the five woods’ hundred specters, the Man, Yi, Di, Xia, Qiang, Hu, and Cang barbarians,
those dwelling above mountains, below mountains, in water, in fire,
at gates, doorways, wells, hearths, dwellings, and walls.
All manner of ghosts—command their complete eradication,
dispersion, and annihilation.
Plunge them a thousand fathoms into the earth,
consigning them to timely ruin, leaving no remnant.
May all stand in awe, ever beholden to the sagely favor.
Proclaiming the luminous command, we enact the divine incantation.

The incantation declares:

The Most High’s golden mouth commands,
solemnly adjuring all demons.

When the years of Horse and Sheep arrive,
pestilence and plague shall multiply.
Ding diligently takes men and women,
while Shi spares no harm to fowl and geese.
Where the Dharma Master turns the sutras,
no demonic essence may pass through.
Those who uphold the Three Caverns’ Way
shall cross ten-thousand-fathom waves unscathed.
Slay the ghosts—ghosts shall be utterly destroyed;
heal the sick—sickness shall bring no further harm.

The following hymn declares:

At the center, the spirits of Wu and Ji,
the Yellow Emperor governs the four directions.
Today, great harmony is established,
and myriad evils dare not draw near.
The winds cease, branches still,
rains disperse, the Three Luminaries shine.
Thus the Dao and virtue flourish,
the Perfect and True stand in profound accord.
Heavenly maidens seize the demons of fate,
the Ten Severances slay all wrong and falsehood.
Merits accumulate, ascending to the Mystic Capital,
blessings and joy tower high and majestic.
Wealth and treasures are shared among five households,
and those who perform good deeds find the gods returning to them.
All omens, auspicious and baleful, submit and hide—
who shall report good and evil?
The Mystic Radiance scatters in emptiness,
the sounding drum strikes not of itself.
Command all demonic and wayward spirits:
those who test this shall find their own decline.
The Most High’s golden mouth decrees—
if disobeyed, to whom shall death’s grievance belong?

The *Dongyuan Sanmei Divine Incantation Ritual of Offering, Repentance, and Thanksgiving* is now complete.
