The Celestial Sovereign above harmonizes the principles of Heaven’s Primordial Origin,
And below ordains the completion of Earth’s great cycles.
The Holy Spirit establishes the Pole of Eternity,
And spreads the Grand Dao at the outset of Chaos’s beginning;
The common folk dwell in peace,
And bask in the Perfect Transformation after the Age of Great Simplicity.

The Master holds the keys of the Mysterious,
And oversees the scales of authority.
We, the humble servants, raise our aspirations to the Play of the Mystic,
And focus our hearts upon the Dao’s domain.
Though we dwell in the dust of the Yellow Chamber,*
We cannot fathom its sublime mysteries;
Though we ascend the misty forests of the Purple Hall,*
We vainly seek its profound secrets.

We vow to fulfill our duties and proclaim the transformations of the Way,
And hope to receive its teachings to attain Perfect Refinement.
For all petitions, we dare not omit the proper supplication.
Now we humbly accept the Celestial Command,
And solemnly offer this incense.

The lightning encircles the Dipper’s pivot,*
And heralds the Auspicious Celebration of the Yellow Emperor’s descent;
The stars shine upon the radiant shores,*
And mark the Golden Heaven’s Sovereign’s* august blessings.
Wherever there is an opening, it precedes—
All in accord with joyous response.
Bearing the Light of Auspicious Eternity,
We align with the prosperous era.

In awe of the moment of reverent encounter,
We establish this Grand Auspicious Assembly.
Surrounding the Emperor’s glory like the Northern Pole,
And venerating his majesty as the Southern Mountain.
The calendar proclaims the correct beginning of seasons,
To harmonize with the destiny of the land.

We awaken the bright unity of the One Sovereign,
And all regions depend upon it—
The realm forever at peace.
With reverence, we extend our supplication to the Mystic Vault,
And humbly return gratitude to the Celestial Pole.

We present the Golden Talisman,*
And examine the Sacred Registers.
Since the banners of rainbows and flags have appeared,
And the feathered canopy has descended in splendor,
We offer the Threefold Blessing,
And the Ninefold Harmony’s* celestial music.

Now at this morning audience,
Ascending the platform to perform the Dao’s rites,
With the assembly of those who seek the Law,
We present the first pinch of incense.

May this incense smoke ascend to the heavens,
Directly offering homage to the Perfect, Supreme Daoic Treasure—
The Grand Lord of the Great Luo, Primordial Origin Heavenly Venerable,
The Golden Talisman Celestial Venerable, Jade Sovereign Emperor of the Three Heavens,
And the Supreme Grand Luo, Perfect Truth All-Holy Assembly.

We, the humble servants, surrender body, spirit, and fate,
Prostrate our heads to the earth,
And look upward in reliance upon the Three Supreme Lords and the Ten Directions’ All-Holy Assembly.

May the merit of this incense ascend to bless the Emperor.
With humble reverence, we pray that the Way aligns with Xīxuān,*
And that his virtue surpasses Tāng and Wǔ.
A hundred rivers converge into the sea,
Unleashing boundless fortune’s source;
The Six Dragons govern the heavens,
Awakening the vault’s eternal longevity.

All nations look upward in devotion,
And the four seas remain forever serene.
Now we offer incense as we have before,
And again surrender to the Teacher-Lord and All-Holy Assembly.
The Perfect Truth’s virtue—
After attaining the Dao,
It preserves Heaven’s eternal existence,
And harmonizes with the Dao’s True Essence.

The Great Brightness arises in the East,
With a humble heart to serve above.
Its radiance shines upon the landscape,
And its reach extends both far and near,
To ride upon the morning’s light.

Now at this morning audience,
Ascending the platform to perform the Dao’s rites,
With the assembly of those who seek the Law,
We present the second pinch of incense.

May this incense smoke ascend to the heavens,
Directly offering homage to the Perfect, Supreme Scripture-Treasure—
The Jade Sovereign, Celestial Lord of the Mystic Dipper,
The Purple Dipper Heavenly Emperor,
And the Yu’s Remnant Heavenly Palace’s True Immortals and All-Holy Assembly.

We, the humble servants, surrender body, spirit, and fate,
To the Three Supreme Lords and the Ten Directions’ All-Holy Assembly.

May the merit of this incense ascend to bless the Emperor.
With humble reverence, we pray for the four seasons to follow their proper order,
And for all nations to dwell in eternal peace.
We refine the Dao to its utmost,
Refine virtue to its utmost,
Refine benevolence to its utmost—
Doubling the blessings of prosperity;
We blend the Spirit of the Mixed Origin,
Blend the Essence of the Mixed Origin,
Blend the Qi of the Mixed Origin—
Forever preserving eternal life.
In harmony with the heart of boundless compassion,
We rejoice in the symbol of universal peace.

Now we offer incense as we have before,
And again surrender to the Teacher-Lord and All-Holy Assembly.
The Perfect Truth’s virtue—
After attaining the Dao,
Forever preserves eternal life,
And harmonizes with the Dao’s True Essence.

Heaven’s Sovereign has no favorites,
But supports only the virtuous.
Trusting in the Dao’s eternal constancy,
The Supreme Emperor loves life—
Doing good brings blessings,
And revealing the Emperor’s heart of simplicity.

The morning light radiates upon the domain of longevity,
And the dawn’s glow illuminates the court’s assembly.

Now at this morning audience,
Ascending the platform to perform the Dao’s rites,
With the assembly of those who seek the Law,
We present the third pinch of incense.

May this incense smoke ascend to the heavens,
Directly offering homage to the Perfect, Supreme Teacher-Treasure,
The Five Spirits Mystic Elder Heavenly Venerable,
The Purple Dipper Northern Pole Great Emperor,
The Earthly Sovereign of the Imperial Soil,
And the Great Red Heavenly Palace’s Unbounded All-Holy Assembly.

We, the humble servants, surrender body, spirit, and fate,
Prostrate our heads to the earth,
And look upward in reliance upon the Three Supreme Lords and the Ten Directions’ All-Holy Assembly.

May the merit of this incense ascend to bless the Emperor.
With humble reverence, we pray that the morning’s Qi be clear and bright,
And that the Imperial Person’s* vitality be secure and tranquil.

The Heavens and Earth unite in virtue,
And widely propagate the benevolent winds of transformation and nurturing;
The seas and mountains respond with reverence,
And all praise the harmonious and flourishing governance of the Perfect Age.
Auspicious clouds display their splendor,
And sweet dew condenses in blessings.

Now we offer incense as we have before,
And again surrender to the Teacher-Lord and All-Holy Assembly.
The Perfect Truth’s virtue—
After attaining the Dao,
It preserves Heaven’s eternal existence,
And harmonizes with the Dao’s True Essence.

The rites of the Four Directions are fulfilled,
And repentance is complete.

The **Step of the Void**—three salutations, three rites, repeated homage to the Law’s station.

With solemn sincerity, I, **[Your Name]**, a subject of the realm, humbly proffer this petition to the **Three Realms’ Most Exalted**, the **Ten Directions’ Supreme Saints**, the **Jade Capital’s Golden Gate Celestial Emperor**, the **Heavenly True One**, the **Sun, Moon, and Starry Hosts**, the **Ten Directions’ Teacher-Lords and Sacred Assembly**, the **Three Realms’ officials**, and all **True Spirits**.

With reverent gaze upon Your boundless compassion, and Your gracious inspection below.

I have heard:
Eight thousand years mark the Spring and Autumn—all revere the **Everlasting Peach Tree’s** longevity;
The **Nine-Five’s** fortune matches Heaven and Earth—again presenting the **Grand Range’s** noble words.

Gazing upward at the **Imperial Pole’s** majesty, no prayer exhausts the **Flower-Sealed** blessings.

We, Your subjects, have the honor of this sacred dawn, humbly receiving Your edicts.
Your teachings unfold the **Pure Science**—we stand in awe before Your august presence, mere inches away;
Your fortune bestows upon us auspicious destiny—we exhaust our loyalty and sincerity in repeated devotion.

Heaven’s hearing is not distant; Your mysterious virtue is unfathomable.
May Your mercy return to us, granting clear perception.
May the **Precious Era** shine ever brighter, filling the Nine Heavens with spring’s joyous *qi*;
May the **Golden Branches** extend blessings, echoing the ten thousand nations’ joyous cries.

May the year bring abundant harvests, with no blight or sickness among creatures.
May the borders’ wars forever cease, while the capital’s suburbs teem with **Lynx and Phoenix** in flight.
May the seas be calm and the rivers clear, with winds and rains in perfect harmony.

Thus, we honor above the **Heavenly Emperor’s** great compassionate transformation,
And below, fulfill our subjects’ sincere surrender of fate.

**Twelve Wishes**—**Preserving the Spirit and Burning Incense**

To the **Incense Officials and Messengers**, the **Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords**, and the **Attendant Spirit Officials of the Incense**:
May they command that at the place where I formerly ascended the platform for early morning rites,
**Golden Elixir and Azure Grass** naturally arise, along with **Hundred Spirits and True Ones**, gathering here before the incense brazier.

May Your enlightened gaze return with clarity, my sincere heart moved—
May the **Ten Directions’ Celestial Children** and **Jade Maidens** attend in attendance,
Conveying through fragrant mist my previous petitions’ sincerity,
Swiftly reaching the **Supreme Dao’s** **Three Pure Ones**, the **Most High Saints of the Azure Sky**, the **Golden Gate Jade Emperor’s** **Divine Presence**.

**Exiting the Hall in Praise**, **Returning the Merit**
The **Golden Talisman’s** **Prayer for Longevity**—the **Early Morning Rites** now concluded.
