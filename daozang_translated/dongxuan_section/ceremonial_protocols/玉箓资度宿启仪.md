**Jade Register Rite for Seeking Deliverance and Invoking the Night Vigil**
The ritual proceeds according to form. All pay homage to the master and cultivate mindfulness as prescribed.

**Invocation of the Divine Incantations**

**East**
Ninefold *qi* of the Azure Heavens, Radiant Star, Great Spirit.
Shining upon the East, illuminating the Nine Gates.
Turning the candle’s yang light, sweeping away defilement and baleful *qi*.
The Luminous Youth, styled Mysterious Minister,
Guards my chamber, ascending to face the Imperial Lord.
Binding demons and restraining specters, hunting down malevolent hordes.
Upholding the true Dao, the Red Script and Jade Texts.
Nine Heavens’ talismanic command, dispatched by dragon couriers.
All under Heaven is pacified; I attain transcendence and flight.

**South**
Threefold *qi* of the Vermilion Heavens, resplendent with streaming light.
The Glowing Star turns the candle, penetrating the Great Yang.
Above abides the Crimson Essence, in harmony with the Primal Sovereign.
The Luminous Divine Youth, styled Radiant Chamber,
Commands the hosts of fire, guarding the Jade Hall.
Beheading deviance and restraining specters, severing demon kings.
Ordained by the Northern Emperor, none dare withstand wind and flame.
Interlocking bells gleam, protecting the altar precincts.
The true Dao flows forth—who dares act recklessly?
I receive supreme merit, seated in the turning of the *kuigang*.
Through kalpas unending, I safeguard Heaven without bound.

**West**
Sevenfold *qi* of the Pale Heavens, the Great White streaming with essence.
Light illumines the Golden Gate, penetrating the Great Darkness.
Within abides the Pale Sovereign, styled Imperial Spirit,
Preserving the divine and pacifying my form.
Severing the roots of deviance, the kingly Dao shines clearly.
Palaces are ordered, the Three Luminaries aligned.
The Dao accords with spontaneity; I ascend to the Purple Court.
The talismanic command of the Numinous Treasure universally benefits all beings.
The Primal Sovereign’s true *qi* comes to merge with my body.
Merit extends to all; Heaven and Earth are at peace.

**North**
Fivefold *qi* of the Mysterious Heavens, the Primordial Beginning lingers.
The Chronogram Star blazes, its light suffusing the Supreme Subtlety.
The Black Numinous Honored Spirit, styled Layered Might,
Commands the flying immortals of Heaven, clad in feathered skirts and divine robes.
Guarding the Five Gates, inspecting essences and capturing transgressors.
Who dares test me? The *huoluo* blades strike and destroy.
The Jade Talisman’s decree summons the Eight Mightful Divine Beings.
The gates of deviance are sealed; the true Dao shines forth.
Illuminating my body, the Three Luminaries share their radiance.
I spur the void and ride the floating clouds, my form ascending in immortal flight.

**Center**
The single *qi* of the Yellow Heavens regulates Qian and Kun.
Forging and refining yin and yang, governing the Mysterious True.
The Quelling Star emits its splendor, streaming through the Nine Heavens.
The Radiant Youth, styled Celestial Brilliance,
Primal *qi* and yang essence, flames rise as crimson smoke.
Penetrating all under Heaven, and the bodies of us, your servants.
A hundred deviants are cast down; ten thousand ghosts slain.
The Central Mountain’s divine incantation universally prevails.
The Five Spirits are pacified; my body ascends as an immortal.

**Twenty-four strikes of the ritual drum**

O Most High Three Heavens, Mysterious Primordial, Threefold *Qi*, Supreme Lord of the Dao,
Summon forth from within my body the Three and Five Merit Officers,
Left and Right Attendant Envoys,
Left and Right Incense-Bearing Dragon Courier Scribes,
Incense-Holding Golden Youths,
Message-Transmitting, Flower-Scattering Jade Maidens,
and the Five Thearchs’ Direct Talisman and Daily Incense Officers—
thirty-six of each—emerge.
Emerging, they are clad in solemn attire, their robes and sashes adorned with hanging tassels.
Report to the deities of the sacred altar’s land and the spirits of the directional domains.

Now, having fasted and made solemn petition, I establish the altar and complete the rites. With reverence, I present this offering to convey the sincerity of my heart’s intent, which has been recorded and made known. May the supreme, perfected *qi* of the Dao, the radiant luminosity of the *Lingbao*, descend and flow into our bodies, that the devotion of my petition may swiftly ascend and be received before the Most High, Boundless, and Perfect Dao—the Three Clarities, the August Heavenly Golden Gate Jade Emperor, and the Eastern Ultimate Compassionate Lord, the Azure Mystery Emperor.

Invoking the sacred ranks,
I, your humble servant [Name], now kindle this incense, dedicating its merit and virtue. May [Name of the deceased] ascend on phoenix-drawn chariots, soar through the clouds, and ride the luminous carriage of the immortals, attaining joy in the divine realms and realizing the fruit of freedom. Universally, for the Emperor, His Majesty; the Crown Prince, His Highness; the princes and marquises who shield the realm; the officials who govern the land; our Three Masters and Five Companions; past generations of Dao seekers; those who dwell in valleys and mountains; the Libationers of our gates; all soldiers and common folk; every being under heaven—whether moving or still, flying or hidden—may all return body, spirit, and life to the Supreme, Ten Directions, *Lingbao*, Natural, Perfect, and Boundless Dao.

I humbly beseech the absolution of my three karmic actions and six sensory roots, and the forgiveness of boundless transgressions, that I may escape the Three Calamities, Five Sufferings, Eight Difficulties, and Nine Perils. May my body attain the true Dao, and may I sing of great peace. Together, may we ascend to benevolence and longevity, roaming in effortless freedom, forever united with the Dao. May this petition, born of profound resonance, be heard and received before the Perfect and Boundless Dao.

At the sounding of the chime, rise in reverence and praise.
Chant the *Ten Directions*.
Bow to the ground, then kneel in prostration, returning life and spirit in repentance.

We, the assembled ritualists, wholeheartedly return body, spirit, and life to the Ten Directions’ Boundless Dao, the Supreme *Lingbao* Heavenly Worthy. We reverently gaze upon your vast compassion, beseeching your boundless grace and universal mercy.

We have heard that the primordial ancestral *qi* ever abides in purity as its essence; the jade registers of ritual scripture cannot be approached without fasting and covenant. To move the Perfected Ones above, we must first purge even the slightest impurity. Thus, we offer our utmost sincerity to cultivate hidden blessings. Yet we fear that our wisdom has drowned in illusion, our discernment entangled in distractions. The true unity of essence, *qi*, and spirit remains obscured by the unbroken mountain of karma; the delusions of body, mind, and speech churn the still waters of concentration into waves. Our accumulated transgressions are measureless.

We implore your compassion and beseech your forgiveness, that our petitions may be free of demonic obstruction, our meditations aligned with the Dao. May we gather the myriad Perfected at the imperial court and assemble a hundred blessings at the ritual altar. May [Name of the deceased] realize the fruit of immortality, their spirit serene in the realm of fortune. May the nation and household receive your protection, preserving the jade plan of destiny forever.

We, the assembled ritualists, bow our heads in devotion, offering thanks to the Supreme and Perfect Three Treasures.

At the sounding of the chime, chant the *Three Invocations* and perform the *Three Bows*.
Once more, invoke the sacred ranks.

The humble servant of such-and-such rank and surname, with utmost sincerity, jointly invokes and reverently addresses:

The Supreme and Boundless Dao, the Primordial Heavenly Venerable of the Origin;
The Most High Dao Lord;
The Most High Lord Lao;
The Jade Emperor of the August Heaven;
The Great Emperor of the Purple Tenuity at the Northern Culmen;
The Heavenly Emperor of the Purple Tenuity;
The August Thearch of Earth, Lord of the Soil;
The Great Emperor of Azure Radiance at the Eastern Culmen;
The Great Emperor of Longevity at the Southern Culmen;
The Supreme Jade Emperor;
The Jade Sovereign of the Void;
The Venerable Lord of the Dao, Radiant and August, of the Seven-Treasured Jeweled Terrace and Golden Watchtower in the Jade Capital of the Mysterious Metropolis;
The hosts of Great Sages who have attained the Dao in the ten directions;
The Perfected Lords and Venerable Masters;
The True Persons of Great Compassion and Great Mercy, Savior from Suffering;
The True Persons of Salvation and Deliverance;
The True Persons of Great Benevolence;
The True Persons of Life-Inscription;
The True Persons of Universal Salvation;
The True Persons of Dharma Liberation in the Fragrant Grove Assembly;
The thirty-six divisions of revered scriptures;
The Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Center;
The Great Dharma Masters of the Three Heavens;
The True Lords of the Three Masters of the Lingbao Scriptures and Registers;
The True Ladies of the Orthodox Unity lineage, the Three Female Masters;
The officials and attendants of the Three Realms;
and all true numina.

We, your servants, are but scattered rubble and broken tiles, frail as the wellside parasol tree. Though we have personally received the transmission of the Dao’s discipline, we lament the long and distant path of chambered cultivation.

Swiftly beholding the Mysterious Pivot, yet this towering wall looms dense before us.
We have not tended the mist and clouds in the Vale of Fleeting Time, but idly admired the sun and moon at the Cock’s Window.
The teachings emerged from the Azure Prime, yet we grasp only the urgency of proclaiming the talismans;
The rites honor the Great Simplicity, and we dread incurring the severity of its promulgated statutes.
Had we not sworn this ground to establish merit, how could we presume to inherit Heaven’s mandate and redress our faults?

We, your servants, reverently receive the imperial edict, diligently cultivating the Jade Registers,
to aid in the deliverance of such-and-such a spirit and augment the blessings of Heaven.
In accordance with the stated intent, we exert the utmost sincerity,
tempering our cinnabar hearts and refining our plain sincerity.
We follow the secrets of the Golden Casket of Purple Yang,
and adhere to the mysteries of the Jade Registers of the Azure Ultimate.
Gates arrayed with the Ten Flowers, the altar encircled by the Four Quarters.
Modeling Heaven and emulating Earth, the Three Vehicles array the ranks of mandarin ducks and egrets;
Summoning yin and invoking yang, the Nine Suites descend the chariots of dragons and simurghs.
Mist ascends from the orchid tripod, colored clouds surge from the mushroom censer.
Banners and pennants flutter, streamers and blossoms sway.

Beginning on such-and-such a day, we reverently establish the Mysterious Altar in accordance with the ritual canons.
May the Three Treasures and Dao Masters, the Lords of the Nine Dark Realms, deign to bestow their compassionate gaze,
and peruse what we have set forth.
We command the immortals of the Three Caverns, the officials of the Lingbao,
the attendants of the Azure Mystery, the ranks of the Yellow Registers,
the overseers of the fast, the attendants of the scriptures,
the guardians of the altar and protectors of the Dao,
the community spirits and earth deities—
to unite in purpose and strength, sweeping away malevolent vapors within and without;
to convey sincerity and transmit faith, harmonizing the resonance between Heaven and humanity.

May we, your servants, attain clarity in every limb and harmony in the Three Passes.
Concentrating the true and calming the breath, we fuse the wondrous qi within the cinnabar hut;
Gathering the Dao and moving the spirit, we embrace the numinous radiance at the Mysterious Seat.
We spread forth vast blessings to deliver the divine spirit.
May the fast’s blessings be complete and perfect, and the Dharma Wheel turn ever onward.

At dawn tomorrow, we shall proceed with the Dao-circumambulation and continue our supplications.
When the sounding stone is struck, the Wisdom Hymn recited,
the talismans announced, and the incense offered with concentrated spirit.

May the Incense Officials and Envoys, the Lords of the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger, and all the spirit-officials attendant upon the incense ensure that the site where we, your servants, have established the altar overnight naturally brings forth golden liquid, cinnabar, and azure mushroom blossoms. May the hundred numinous perfected beings gather here before the incense burner. We humbly pray that Heaven witness our sincerity, and that the winds purify the earth below. May the jade chimes harmonize with the golden tones in perfect order, and may the jasper wheels and feathered canopies descend to this hall. May our morning devotions be accomplished, and may blessings flow abundantly to the unseen realms.

May the jade maidens and immortal youths of the ten directions attend the orchid-scented smoke, conveying the sincerity of our supplications swiftly to the Most Perfect and Boundless Dao of the Three Clarities and Supreme Saints, to the Jade Emperor of the Golden Portal of the Vast Heaven, and to the Merciful August One of the Eastern Ultimate and the Azure Mystery Emperor before the Dao.
