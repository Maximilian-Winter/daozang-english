### *The Evening Audience Rite for Circulating the Mysterious Numinous Scripture*

The ritual proceeds according to form.
All pay homage to the master and visualize as prescribed.

**Invocation of the Divine Incantation:**
To the north ascends the Supreme Mystery, where the Five Qi meander.
Fivefold treasure blossoms, their flowing light resplendent.
The numinous radiance is lush and elegant, suffusing the Great Tenuity.
Gaze upward as it pours into my body, unfolding the inner palace in fresh brilliance.
Pacify and guard the numinous abode, where the myriad spirits converge.
My form dons feathered raiment, and my risen body soars as an immortal.

**Strike the ritual drum twenty-four times.**

O Most High Three Heavens, Mysterious Primordial Origin, Three Qi, Supreme Venerable Lord Lao:
Summon forth from within my body the Three and Five Merit Officers, the Attendants of the Left and Right, the Courier Dragon Riders bearing incense, the Golden Lads of Incense, the Jade Maidens scattering flowers, and the Five Thearchs’ Direct Attendants and Daily Incense Officers—thirty-six of each.
Let them emerge, adorned in solemn vestments, their crowns and sashes trailing.
Notify the Earth Deities and the numinous perfected of the sacred precinct’s domain.
This evening, I ascend the altar to perform the Dao-circulation rite and pay audience to the Imperial Perfected.
With reverence, I present these cinnabar sincerities, all inscribed and sealed.

We have heard:
The Central Culmen streams its radiance, while the Left Enclosure blazes in splendor.

The Primordial Origin inaugurates its course, manifesting the auspicious omen of cranes crying over the jade divination board; the Orthodox Unity receives the transmission, unfolding the esoteric secrets of the Dragon Han’s jasper-bound scriptures. Through these scriptures and precepts, the arts of geomancy are pervaded in full. Cultivating the true Dao to enter the lineage of immortals, delivering the people of heaven and revealing the wondrous Dharma. Sun and stars shine with radiance, rain and dew bestow without partiality. We, your servants, are fortunate to stand upon the Dharma bridge, receiving the sacred creation. Having been enlightened by the imperial transformation, we now proclaim and propagate the august imperial wind.

Today, in reverent compliance with the imperial edict, we solemnly perform the Golden Register rites. We, your servants, purify the jade halls and erect the jasper altar. With myriad fragrant flowers, we signal our earnest prayers for grace; with towering merit and virtue, we aspire to extend life and inscribe blessings. Humbly we knock our heads upon the great anvil, hoping the August Ultimate will incline its heart.

This evening, ascending the altar to perform the Dao, the Dharma assembly and we now offer the first pinch of incense. May this incense smoke ascend directly to offer reverence to the Most High Perfect and True Precious Dao of the Great Luo, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of Original Commencement; the Heavenly Emperor of the Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace; the Two Emperors of the Jade Dipper; the Nine August Stellar Lords; and the Perfected Immortals and Sacred Hosts of the Heaven of Pure Tenuity.

We, your servants, take refuge in body, take refuge in spirit, take refuge in life, prostrating our heads to the earth, reverently relying upon the Three Venerables of the Most High and the sacred hosts of the ten directions. May the merit and virtue of this incense ascend to offer prayers for His Majesty the Emperor. We humbly pray that the eight extremities gather around the Pole Star, and the Three Powers assist his virtue. May the nine patterns of the tortoise diagram reveal celestial auspices upon the Yellow River’s clarity; may the tiger’s homage span ten thousand years, and the imperial spirit open the divine precincts upon the vast earth.

Now, we burn incense, taking refuge from our honored teachers, the great sacred hosts, and the virtue of the Perfected Ones. After attaining the Dao, may they preserve heaven’s enduring existence, harmonizing with the Dao to achieve true perfection.

This evening, ascending the altar to perform the Dao, the Dharma assembly and we now offer the second pinch of incense. May this incense smoke ascend directly to offer reverence to the Most High Perfect and True Precious Scriptures of the Jade Clarity Dao Lord; the Heavenly Worthy of Numinous Treasure; the Great Emperor of the Purple Tenuity’s Central Palace of the Northern Culmen; the Stellar Lord of One’s Natal Destiny; the Stellar Governor Illuminating the Imperial Throne; and the Perfected Immortals and Sacred Hosts of the Heaven of Yu Yu.

May the merit and virtue of this incense respectfully offer prayers for His Highness the Crown Prince. We humbly pray that his fortune’s tree renews daily, and the sprouts of goodness grow ever in spring. May heaven bestow pure felicity, uniting the true *qi* of the Seven Origins; may the emperor grant nine ages, bathing in the numinous light of the Ten Extremities. May the golden tripod inherit the treasure of emptiness and non-being, and the jade field fuse the pearl of mystery and wonder. May the profound dew fly to the clouds, moistening the moon palace and stellar enclosures in perfect harmony; may the auspicious clouds congeal at dawn, covering the golden branches and jade leaves in enduring peace.

Now, we burn incense, taking refuge from our honored teachers, the great sacred hosts, and the virtue of the Perfected Ones. After attaining the Dao, may they preserve heaven’s enduring existence, harmonizing with the Dao to achieve true perfection.

May the merit and virtue of this incense flow back to the nine provinces and four seas, to all moving and growing beings imbued with spirit. We humbly pray that the true Dao suffuse and nurture, and the mysterious grace spread and bestow. May the ladders and boats return to transformation, admiring the customs of robes and caps, rites and music; may mountains and marshes share benevolence, freeing scales, shells, feathers, and fur from their burdens.

Now, therefore, we kindle this incense, taking refuge from our own selves to the Great Sacred Host of the Most Venerable Masters, that by their true virtue, having attained the Dao, we may forever preserve longevity and harmonize with the Dao to become true.

**The Three Refuges**
With wholehearted devotion, we take refuge in the scriptural treasures of the ten directions; may all beings awaken understanding, receive, uphold, read, and recite.
With wholehearted devotion, we take refuge in the Dao treasures of the ten directions; may all beings turn their minds in reverence, offering faith and homage to all.
With wholehearted devotion, we take refuge in the master treasures of the ten directions; may all beings ascend the Dharma bridge universally, without hindrance.

**Eulogy of Past Lives**
As the scriptures declare, upon encountering the life-bestowing hour of our destiny, the celestial post of the Middle Prime, the Steed of Fate, the Three Calamities, and the Nine Perils, we beseech protection for our present kin, that they may dwell in peace. Through repentance and reverence, may we gradually ascend to wondrous fruition.

In accordance with the sacred edict, we now reverently perform the Golden Register rites to pray for longevity and extended felicity. We, your servants, lead the pure assembly of this altar in reciting once through the *Highest Clarity Wondrous Numinous Northern Dipper Life-Prolonging True Scripture*, offering it up to the Great Sage of the Central Heaven, the Seventh Celestial Emperor’s Palace, the Heavenly Impulse Breaking-General Jade Dawn Lord.

Prostrate, we pray that your profound hearing may silently penetrate, that your sacred mind may clearly perceive. May the Star Bridge gleam in radiant connection, the Jade Balance secretly turn within the Dipper’s pivot; may the Silver River shine in its revolutions, the Heavenly Steeds flank the wheel’s spokes. May the attendants of the Six Jia and Six Ding spirits, the guardian spirits of the Dipper’s soul and essence, stand watch over the altar’s禁坛. May the twenty-four Peril-Officers, arrayed in solemn procession, surround the altar with their regalia; may the hundred thousand myriad layers of Dao qi ride upon banners of resplendent glory. May our humble plea, though but a footstep away, duly fulfill our repeated supplications. May you enjoy the fullness of the Nine-Five hexagram’s abundance, matching the eight thousand years of the Zhuang’s longevity. As Heaven protects you, may all be auspicious without exception.

We bow our heads in reverence, taking refuge in the scripture, and chant its praises.

**Threefold Hearing of the Scripture**

Upon hearing the scripture, may the Sacred Longevity know eternal peace, the imperial domain stand firm.
Upon hearing the scripture, may the golden branches flourish, the precious succession stretch far and wide.

Concentrating spirit, we burn incense. May the Incense Official Envoys, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, and the attendant spirit-officers of incense cause this place where we have this evening performed the recitation and Dao rites to naturally produce golden liquid, cinnabar, and azure mushrooms. May the hundred numinous Perfected gather here before the incense burner. May our cinnabar sincerity move and be received, may vast blessings silently unfold. May the Sacred Longevity know eternal peace, the imperial domain stand forever firm. May the immortal youths of the ten directions and the jade maidens attend, transmitting the fragrant smoke of our sincerity in this offering, swiftly conveying it to the presence of the Utmost True, Boundless Dao, the Three Clarities’ August Perfected, the Purple Tenuity Northern Pole Great Emperor, and the Nine August Star Lords of the Northern Dipper.
