**The Rite of Invoking Blessings and Lodging Petitions to the Most Merciful and Efficacious True Lord**

The ritual proceeds according to form.
All pay homage, the master visualizes and recites as prescribed.
The divine incantations are proclaimed:

**East**
The East, realm of the Nine Qi, where the Primordial Sovereign rules the Azure Heaven.
Amidst verdant mists and towering ramparts dwells the Ancient One,
Who oversees the celestial registers, gathers qi, and uplifts immortals.

**South**
The South, realm of the Cinnabar Heaven, where the Vermilion Emperor presides in the Jade Hall.
There abides the Great Spirit, known as the Radiant Sovereign,
Whose flames ascend in streaming smoke, whose Three Qi blaze with light.
Immortals receive their mandate, answering to the Great Yang.

**West**
The West, realm of the Pale Heaven, where the White Emperor guards the Seven Gates.
Golden numina gleam resplendent, the Great Hua exhales its mist.
White peaks rise in majesty, the Seven Qi swirl in harmony.
Above dwells the First-Born, the August Ancient Great Spirit,
Who governs the qi of the lungs, supervises the Nine Heavens,
Inspects and confirms the celestial registers, and commands the ascent of immortals.

**North**
The North, realm of the Mysterious Heaven, where the Five Qi meander.
There abides the Black Emperor, the Dual Sovereign of the Supreme Tenuity.
He oversees the talismanic mandates, refining immortals in the Eight Potencies.
Clad in azure skirts and feathered capes, adorned with dragon scripts and phoenix robes,
Exalted by the Supreme Emperor, he is summoned to the Jade Stair.

**Center**
The Center, realm of the All-Pervading Spirit, the Yellow Primordial Heaven.
Here the Five Elders first arose, the Central August One most revered.
Gathering qi and overseeing perfected beings, he governs the immortals of the earth.
Keeper of the mysterious registers, custodian of the jade texts,
He hastens the ascent of primordial qi, universally proclaiming to the myriad spirits.

The ritual drum is sounded twenty-four times.

The Most High Mysterious Origin, the Five Numinous Venerable Lords, summon forth from within our bodies:
The Three and Five Merit Officers, the Left and Right Fragrant Official Envoys,
The Golden Lads of Incense, the Jade Maidens of Transmission,
The Daily Fragrant Officials, the Merit Officer Envoys,
The Orthodox Spirits of the Three Qi—
Swiftly ascend to report!
The Five Great Marshals of Guan, Qi, Bian, Wei, and Diao;
The Two Marshals of Yue and Xu;
The Celestial Ding Warriors;
The Left and Right Divine Officials—
On this day, we reverently initiate the fast and establish the altar to expound the rites.

We, your humble servants, respectfully receive the sacred decree.
All intentions and petitions have been recorded and submitted on high.
We pray that the true and vital qi of life descend and flow into our bodies,
That the words we now proclaim swiftly reach the presence of
The Most Merciful True Lord of the Golden Portals of the Nine Heavens,
The Most Merciful True Lord of the Jade Portals of the Nine Heavens.

**Proclaiming the Ritual Rank**
We, your humble servants, now burn incense and dedicate these merits,
Humbly praying that the Most Merciful True Lord of the Golden Portals of the Nine Heavens,
The Most Merciful True Lord of the Jade Portals of the Nine Heavens—
Whose splendor rivals linked blossoms, whose eminence crowns the age—
May secretly pervade Heaven and Earth, uniquely wielding the power of creation;
Whose dual aspects—light and radiance—transcend the unfathomable subtlety of their majestic efficacy.

Abundant as though present, resplendent is Their numinous power.
We pray that They may thoroughly bestow Their gaze of observation,
And graciously deign to accept these solemn offerings of gratitude.

First, we offer prayers for the imperial realm’s enduring stability,
For the sacred longevity of the sovereign,
That the benevolence of nurturing transformation may widely extend,
And the governance of great peace be effortlessly maintained.
Next, for the heir apparent, the protective screens of the realm,
The chief ministers, public officials, and all under their charge;
For our own Three Masters and Five Companions,
Those who cultivate the Dao across distant generations,
Those who dwell in valleys or mountain retreats,
The disciples and libationers of the tradition;
And for all beings within the world—
The people of the land, creatures moving and still,
Flying and hidden, all sentient beings without bound—

We, your servants, turn body, turn spirit, turn life
To the Most Merciful True Lords of the Golden and Jade Portals of the Nine Heavens.
We humbly beseech the dissolution of the three karmic actions and six sensory roots,
The boundless transgressions and faults,
That we may escape the three disasters and five sufferings,
The eight difficulties and nine calamities.
May our bodies attain the true Dao,
Singing praises of great peace,
Together ascending to benevolence and longevity,
Roaming freely in non-action,
Forever in union with the Dao.

May these prayers of profound resonance swiftly ascend,
Reaching the presence of the Most Merciful True Lords
Of the Golden and Jade Portals of the Nine Heavens.

**Chanting the Directions**
With reverence, we bow our heads, kneel in prostration,
And, as repentant servants of the ritual assembly,
Turn body, turn spirit, turn life
To the Most Merciful True Lords of the Golden and Jade Portals of the Nine Heavens,
Humbly awaiting Their great compassion,
That Their vast grace may universally descend.

We have heard that when the jade scriptures unfold their radiance,
Phoenix glyphs illuminate the azure vault;
When the golden canons reveal their wonders,
Dragon charts shine brilliantly in the crimson dawn.

To cultivate it is to ride the luminous clouds and soar through the heavens;
To employ it is to bring peace to people and benefit all things.

Yet we, your servants, deeply reflect:
Our five spirits scatter and drift,
Our six palaces grow dim and confused.
The dust of deeds from body, mouth, and mind
swirls ceaselessly;
The wondrous workings of essence, qi, and spirit
remain tangled and unformed.

We humbly pray for cleansing of the soul’s raiment,
that all obstructions may be stilled and clarified,
the five burdens dissolved,
and the three primal mysteries realized.
May our single thought be centered in the Yellow Center,
facing the exalted with reverence;
May we gaze toward the Nine Heavens from the Dark Summit,
and our responsive resonance know no bounds.

With devoted hearts, we bow our heads in homage,
prostrating in gratitude before the Most Merciful True Lords
of the Golden and Jade Portals of the Nine Heavens.

**Threefold Invocation and Hymn**
**Threefold Prostration and Thanksgiving**
**Reverently Announcing the Dignitaries**

We, your humble servants—[Name], together with the ritual assembly present at this altar and the officiating officials—united in sincerity, reverently address:

The Most Merciful True Lord of the Golden Portal of the Nine Heavens,
The Most Merciful True Lord of the Jade Portal of the Nine Heavens,
The Illustrious True Lord, Divine Father,
The Benevolent and Longevous Virtuous Immortal Consort, Divine Mother,
The Pure and Assisting Benevolent and Faithful Immortal Consort, Sacred Consort of the Jing Kingdom,
The Kindly Assisting Compassionate and Serene Immortal Consort, Defender of the Realm,
The Holy Brothers, Holy Sisters-in-Law, Holy Uncles, Holy Sons-in-Law, Holy Sons, Holy Daughters, Holy Nephews, Holy Grandchildren,
All the Immortal Kin of the Celestial Court,
The Mighty Generals of the Five Great Marshals—Zha, Bian, Wei, Zhao, and Diao—
The Two Marshals, Yue and Xu,
The Spirit of the Current Year’s Tai Sui,
The City God of the Imperial Capital,
The Local Earth God of this Temple,
And all the responding numinous spirits of this sacred altar—
we beseech Your vast compassion to deign to witness and bestow Your boundless grace.

We, mere blades of grass and lowly insects,
of humble and coarse nature,
by fortune’s favor have been granted to serve the Mysterious Tradition,
entrusted with the duties of this sacred precinct.

Though our merits fall short by the measure of a hair’s breadth, our transgressions have amassed like mountains as we wander the dust-laden world of mortals. We humbly implore Your boundless benevolence to grant our supplications. Should any matter require report, we dare not withhold it from Your divine hearing.

By imperial decree, we reverently conduct this Pure Offering Rite, extending our devotion to the True End, purifying ourselves and fasting in sincerity. With unwavering faith and earnest intent, we follow the sacred model, erecting a jade altar adorned with feathered canopies. The resonant chime of jade pendants fills the air, golden radiance scatters its brilliance, and the luminous glow of jade candles ascends. We offer our utmost devotion in repentance and beseech Your grace and mandate.

We look up in awe to the Nine Heavens’ Golden Portal and Jade Portal, the Vast Grace True Lords, who dispatch Their divine officials and the Five Marshal Generals. May They unite in purpose, purify within and without, dispel malevolent impurities, and distance us from pernicious influences, so that our five qi may flourish in harmony and all our faculties remain in perfect balance. Through disciplined cultivation and spiritual attainment, may we merge our inner light with the Cinnabar Origin; through prayer and communion, may we channel divine radiance into the Purple Forbidden precincts.

May the virtuous merit be fully accomplished, the blessings of the fast be complete and perfect. May all sentient beings partake in this supreme goodness. Tomorrow at dawn, as we proceed with the Daoist rites, we shall present further petitions.

We vow in devotion, invoking the presence of the divine:
We reverently summon the Incense Official Envoys, the Left and Right Spirit Lords, and all attending numinous officials. May this hallowed site, prepared for the rite, naturally yield golden elixirs, cinnabar jades, and azure sacred herbs. May the host of spirits and perfected beings gather before this incense burner. May our sincerity ascend on high, bringing peace to our households and the realm. May the jade maidens and immortal youths of the ten directions attend the rising incense, conveying our supplications swiftly to the Nine Heavens’ Golden Portal Vast Grace True Lord, the Nine Heavens’ Jade Portal Vast Grace True Lord, and the Vast Grace Numinous Aid True Lord before Their sacred presence.

The Rite of Gathering Blessings and Invoking the Night Vigil is now concluded.
