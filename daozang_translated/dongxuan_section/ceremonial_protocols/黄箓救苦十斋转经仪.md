**Offering Incense**

This incense, nurtured by the Dao of Heaven and Earth, refined by the radiance of Sun and Moon.
It contains the five-phase essence of life-giving transformation, and its fragrant vapor ascends through the hundred harmonies.
All celestial beings rejoice, and the myriad sages attend.
Burn it in the censer to venerate the supreme Dao treasure, the Revered Emperor of the Mystic Capital, the Ten-Thousand-Longevity Heavenly Sovereign.
With this incense offering’s merit, may the imperial vision be steadfast and the holy lifespan boundless.
May I earnestly pray for the longevity of the Northern Pole to match the Southern Mountains.
May the blessings of the talisman be inscribed upon the Jade Calendar, and the lands of Hua and Yi forever benefit from its pure winds.

This incense, born from the Heavenly Essence’s brilliance, its roots coiled in the Moon’s Cavern.
Its mighty fragrance permeates the Nine Heavens, able to return lost souls and restore wandering spirits;
Its essence flows through the Eight Extremes, granting those who receive it the power to revive the dead.
Burn it in the censer to venerate the supreme Sutra treasure, the Revered Sovereign of the Great Unity Saving from Suffering.

With this incense offering’s merit, may all souls in the Ten Hell Realms, the Six Paths of Existence,
the Ten Courts of Judgment, and the Nine Abysses of Darkness—
those lost in delusion, harm, or wandering between life and death—
all be liberated from eternal night and the torment of the dark realms,
and may they universally receive the grace of the Three Treasures
and rely upon the compassionate Sovereign’s vows.

May they escape defilement and attain purity.
**According to the sincerity of each participant, recite the Three Refuges and spread the seat with praise:**
"Prostrate before the ineffable Dao, vast compassion that universally saves.
The Sovereign’s virtue shines as the Great Compassion,
and His station is the Revered One of the Eastern Extremity.
He pours forth the nectar of warmth to cool afflictions,
and scatters the enlightened light to illuminate both darkness and clarity.
He transforms without leaving traces—His presence is everywhere;
He responds to each being’s nature—His compassion reaches all.

In His fixed response, He manifests boundless compassion;
In His boundless compassion, He transcends the Mystic.
He observes all as One, and His blessings extend uniformly across the cosmos.
He teaches the sutras, manifesting His form in the Ten Directions;
He saves suffering souls, liberating them from the Three Realms.
He stills the pain of the Seven Paths and Six Emotions,
and halts the torment of the Three Hell Realms and Nine Nights.

May the gathered *qi* accumulate merit and enjoy the great blessings of the Heavenly Realm;
May all beings follow their karmic inclinations and escape the sufferings of the Hellish Courts.
May He guide all lost souls, open the mysteries to all,
and lead the multitude into the Great Vehicle.

Now, with this ceremony, I humbly offer [Name of the Host] as the master of the fast,
and present the soul of the departed [Name] to cultivate and exalt the wondrous model.
With reverence, I open the Orchid Field (of the Dao),
and proclaim the grand rituals of the Three Caverns,
while turning the precious treasures of the Ten Heavens.
I hope the Mystic Vault will descend its discernment,
and may the soul of the departed [Name] be swiftly liberated and ascend.

May the departed [Name] now hear the true teachings,
and instantly escape the realm of suffering;
May he personally receive the blessings,
and attain the path of the Immortals.

Further, may all souls bound in the dark prisons,
and those who harbor grudges against the living,
all be saved and freed from the cycle of rebirth.
Now, I request all assembled allies
to each bring their sincerest intentions into the chamber.
With pure resolve and tranquil heart,
and upright body and focused mind,
follow the sutra’s law in sequence.

**When entering the ritual platform, kneel and present to the East:**
All in attendance, with utmost reverence and fear,
prostrate with bows, twice kneel, and pray:
"To the Eastern Jade Treasure Sovereign of the Heavenly Court,
to the Saving from Suffering True Person of the Eastern Quarter,
and to the childlike *Wu’ang* (Unrestricted) True Assembly—
We humbly gaze upon Your holy compassion,
and earnestly pray for Your Mystic Discernment.

Your station is at the *Zhen* (Shock) position,
and all life depends upon Your molding and refining.
When spring stirs the Yang warmth,
nothing fails to benefit from Your creative transformation.
The Golden Elixir begins its alchemy,
and the Wood virtue spreads its luster.

We dare to pray for life at Your sacred command,
and thus You issue talismans to the crooked offices.
Without Your boundless creation,
it would be difficult to attain Your profound grace.

We pray that Your green palanquin and elixir carriage come to inspect the gathering of the Ten Truths,
and that Your precious scrolls and sacred texts
surround and fulfill this one cycle’s merit.

Our humble offerings are insufficient to match Your holy might,
and our sincere prayers are boundless.
The assembly is devout—
we now respectfully present our request.

We pray for Your sacred blessings:
scatter flowers, recite the *Hosted Life* praises,
and ascend to the seat to perform the first cycle of the sutra.

We have heard that within the fragrant groves of incense,
the sutras of Saving from Suffering are always proclaimed;
and in the Eastern Extremity Palace,
the virtues of boundless generosity and wide-reaching compassion are practiced.
The Great Compassionate and Benevolent is called the Saving from Suffering Heavenly Sovereign.
In response to our prayers, He descends His compassion,
and follows our voices to fulfill our desires.

He vows to save all beings,
and has done so in countless kalpas.
Now, as He ascends to the seat,
we speak in unison and recite the wondrous sutras,
praising His enlightened title.
We offer [Name of the Host] as the master of the fast,
and present the soul of the departed [Name].
Relying upon the wondrous power of the good cause,
we dissolve the countless kalpas’ sins and transgressions.
May the departed [Name] be exempt from the Eastern Court’s scrutiny,
and directly proceed to the realm of boundless purity.

The assembly is devout—
we now recite the sutra together in unison.
When the sutra is finished,
we return to the Eastern side once more.

**All in attendance, with utmost reverence and fear:**
We prostrate with bows, twice kneel, and pray:
"To the Eastern Jade Treasure Sovereign of the Heavenly Court,
in response to our prayers, His light shines forth across the Ten Directions,
and His voice of salvation echoes through countless kalpas.
We earnestly pray for His compassionate descent,
and dare not forget to take refuge in His command.

We have heard that within the fragrant groves of incense,
the sutras of Saving from Suffering are always proclaimed;
and in the Eastern Extremity Palace,
the virtues of boundless generosity and wide-reaching compassion are practiced.
The Great Compassionate and Benevolent is called the Saving from Suffering Heavenly Sovereign.
In response to our prayers, He descends His compassion,
and follows our voices to fulfill our desires.

He vows to save all beings,
and has done so in countless kalpas.
Now, as He ascends to the seat,
we speak in unison and recite the wondrous sutras,
praising His enlightened title.
We offer [Name of the Host] as the master of the fast,
and present the soul of the departed [Name] to the realm of the Immortals.

We pray for the power of the sacred talismans to liberate him from suffering and delusion,
and may he depart the dark Eastern realm of confusion
to ascend to the fragrant groves of wisdom and tranquility.
All talismans of the *Taishang* (Supreme Sovereign) are now proclaimed.
**Proclaim the talismans, open the gates, and send the Sovereign.**

**Now present to the South, kneeling and praying:**
All in attendance, with utmost reverence and fear,
prostrate with bows, twice kneel, and pray:
"To the Southern Mystic True Sovereign of the Ten-Thousand Blessings,
to the Saving from Suffering True Person of the Southern Quarter,
and to the childlike *Wu’ang* (Unrestricted) True Assembly—"

**Now present to the East, kneeling and praying:**

With reverence and humility, we gaze upon the Sovereign’s boundless compassion,
and pray for his gracious return to the hallowed Daoist furnace.

For the virtue of his radiant brilliance has departed from his station,
yet his luminous light pierces near and far—
illuminating the Southern Netherworld,
where his divine power shapes the clay of souls amid the boundless depths.

He twice refines the great medicine within the cauldron,
and fully restores the lifeless bones beneath the earth.
Dare we beseech the sacred command from the Spirit’s Office,
that the talismans may now be proclaimed in the Curved Palace?

Not by mere mortal craft nor by grand creation
can we contain the Sovereign’s profound benevolence.

We pray for the jade-litters and crimson chariots to descend,
and examine the assembly of the Ten True Ones.
With the treasured scriptures and sacred texts,
may the merit of two full recitations be attained.

Though unworthy, we presume to invoke the Sovereign’s might,
our humble pleas beyond measure.
The gathered dharma-assembly, with pious sincerity,
now humbly petitions:

*"Invite the Sovereign, scatter the flowers, and raise the seat,*
*to perform the second recitation of the Sutra.*

We have heard that the Primordial Sovereign of the Dao,
once within the Fragrant Grove of the Garden,
proclaimed the Law-Solving True Person,
and praised the Great Benevolent and Compassionate One,
saying that to guide the departed from the Nine Abysses,
one must first ponder deeply, focus the mind, and extol their virtues.

May the merit of that past guidance be vast and enduring,
and may the Sovereign now look upon our present resolve to take refuge.

With the current elevation into the Sutra-seat,
all voices harmonize in prayer.
We chant the wondrous scriptures,
and extol the Sovereign’s noble name.

We offer [Name] as the host of the fast,
to meritously recommend the soul of the departed [Name],
that it may be free from all transgressions.
May he, through the power of the good cause,
be absolved of countless kalpas’ sins and errors,
and escape the Southern Quarter’s tribunal of judgment,
directly ascending to the realm of the True Elder of the Boundless Void.

The dharma-assembly, with pious sincerity,
unites in voice to recite the scriptures.
Upon completion, we return again to the Eastern Quarter."*

The assembled faithful, humbly awestruck, now behold the Saintly One’s descent as the Celestial *qi* returns to the body, sensing the natural separation of forms.

In the dust-mote realm, the transformation is displayed—manifesting the singular cause of change.

The merit and virtue are immeasurable, and the resolve to take refuge is most earnest.

Seeing the Pure Assembly of the past, all voices harmonize in unison.

The Master recites the True Scriptures, extolling the Sovereign’s noble name—already completed twice.

We offer [Name] as the host of the fast, to meritously uplift the departed soul [Name], guiding it to rebirth in the Immortal realm.

Humbly, we pray that it may receive the radiant spirit-light of the Sovereign’s grace,
and be led through the ranks of the Celestial Court.

Without constraint or compulsion,
may it forever transcend the Southern Quarter’s realm of darkness and obscurity;
early attain boundless ease,
directly ascending to the Pure Realm of Supreme Transformation’s splendor.

All the Sovereign’s True Talismans are now solemnly proclaimed.

Proclaim the Talismans, open the gates, and escort the Saint to the West.

**Kneeling and reciting to the Western Quarter:**

The assembled faithful, in utmost reverence and fear,
bow with head to the ground, twice prostrate.

We humbly petition the Western Sovereign of Supreme and Perfect Mystery,
the True Person of the Western Land who rescues suffering souls,
and the True Assembly of the Boundless Dao.

May the Saint’s boundless compassion descend,
and pierce through with perfect insight.

Humbly, we note that the *fu* virtue flows in secret,
and the Golden Heaven rides upon the auspicious course.

**Kneeling and reciting to the Western Quarter:**

We humbly expound upon the myriad teachings,
harmonizing with the life-sustaining mechanism of the cosmos’ embrace;
responding to the four seasons’ rhythms,
awakening the enlightening transformation of all sentient beings.

All beings receive the Saint’s blessings,
as the sutra is proclaimed three times.

Daring to petition our fate at the **Spiritual Office (灵司)**,
we thus decree the Talismans at the **Bending Hall (曲府)**.
Not by mere grand creation,
can we attain the profound grace.

We humbly await the **Emerald Palanquin and Vermilion Chariot (绿辇丹舆)**,
to descend and witness the Assembly of the Ten True Ones (**十真之会**);
the **Lingyan Treasure Box (琅函宝笈)**,
to encompass the merit of the threefold recitation.

**The Assembly in Reverence Begins:**

*"The station humbly reports to the Sage.
With purple clouds veiled in mystery—
This is the divine honor of the Three Treasures.
The *dharma-qi* of Brahmā pervades,
Regulating the nine heavens’ vital essence.
Mysterious virtue unfathomable,
Yet the sincere heart ever obeys.
Before the purified assembly,
Voices unite in chant:
Reciting the wondrous scripture,
Extolling the Venerable Title—
Now completed sixfold cycles.
Offered as the vegetarian master,
To aid and commend the departed souls,
Ascending to the realm of the Immortal.
May form and spirit both attain perfection,
Soul and essence transcend.
Exiting the murky Southeast’s domain,
Ascending to the realm of wondrous stillness and splendor.
All the Supreme True Talismans shall now be proclaimed.
Proclaim the talismans, open the gates,
Conduct the Sage westward-southward.
Kneeling in petition:
The station, trembling in awe, prostrates with head and hands,
Twice bows, and reports to the Most Sacred Void Sovereign of the Southwest,
The Saving-Suffering True Child of the Southwest,
And the boundless True Assembly.
With reverence, we await the Sage’s compassion,
That You may condescend to pierce the mysteries.
For the two celestial symbols divide their essence,
Binding the hidden mechanisms of the cosmic fields;
The dual yin solidifies its station,
Congealing supreme stillness upon the earthly sphere.
Bearing all things as sovereign,
Upholding heaven’s pole.
The scripture now completed seven cycles,
Its blessings vast and all-encompassing.
Dare we petition the divine authorities,
Thus issuing talismans to the curved halls.
Not relying on mere creation’s grandeur,
Yet how can we grasp the profound grace?
We humbly pray that the jade carriage and crimson palanquin
May come to witness the assembly of the Ten True Ones;
The jade cases and treasure scrolls,
To encompass the sevenfold cycles’ merit.
This humble one, presumptuous beneath Your majesty,
With deepest supplication, lays bare the heart’s plea.
The assembly, in pious devotion,
Humbly extends the request.
The Sage is summoned, flowers scattered,
Ascending to the seat—
Now performing the seventh cycle.
It is heard:
In the void, the radiant consort ascends,
Receiving the Dao’s boundless grace;
In the shadowed realm, the murky depths,
Yet touched by compassion’s mercy.
The wheel of suffering universally saved,
All ascend to the immortal realm.
Now ascending to the scripture’s seat,
Voices unite in chant,
Reciting the wondrous scripture,
Extolling the Venerable Title.
Offered as the vegetarian master,
To aid and commend the departed souls,
Ascending to the immortal realm.
Leveraging the power of the Auspicious Cause,
Erasing the sins of countless *kalpas*.
Exempt from the Southwest’s Examiners’ scrutiny,
Directly proceeding to the Realm of Radiant Truth and Boundlessness.
The assembly, in pious devotion,
Voices unite in chant.
When the scripture concludes,
Again to the Southwest we go."*

**The Station Reports to the Sage:**

*"The station humbly reports to the Sage.
For the sacred scriptures’ recitation,
Cleanses the heart’s defilements;
The Venerable Title extolled,
Purifies the ear’s root.
Without a word unsanctioned,
All who feel are transformed.
Before the purified assembly,
Voices unite in chant:
Reciting the wondrous scripture—
Now completed seven cycles.
Offered as the vegetarian master,
To aid and commend the departed souls,
Ascending to the immortal realm.
May the roots of guilt be purged,
Spirit and consciousness cooled.
Exiting the murky Southwest’s domain,
Ascending to the realm of wondrous bliss and splendor.
All the Supreme True Talismans shall now be proclaimed.
Proclaim the talismans, open the gates,
Conduct the Sage westward-northward.
Kneeling in petition:
The station, trembling in awe, prostrates with head and hands,
Twice bows, and reports to the Boundless Taihua Sovereign of the Northwest,
The Saving-Suffering True Child of the Northwest,
And the boundless True Assembly.
With reverence, we await the Sage’s compassion,
That You may condescend to pierce the mysteries.
For the Primordial Void’s clarity,
Expands the cosmic symbols’ radiance;
The *dharma-qi* surges and harmonizes,
Stirring the pure winds to establish the pole.
Balancing cold and heat,
Mastering yin and yang.
Both judging good and evil’s measure,
And weighing heavy and light in retribution.
The scripture now completed eight cycles,
Its blessings vast and all-encompassing.
Dare we petition the divine authorities,
Thus issuing talismans to the curved halls.
Not relying on mere creation’s grandeur,
Yet how can we grasp the profound grace?
We humbly pray that the jade carriage and crimson palanquin
May come to witness the assembly of the Ten True Ones;
The jade cases and treasure scrolls,
To encompass the eightfold cycles’ merit.
This humble one, presumptuous beneath Your majesty,
With deepest supplication, lays bare the heart’s plea.
The assembly, in pious devotion,
Humbly extends the request.
The Sage is summoned, flowers scattered,
Ascending to the seat—
Now performing the eighth cycle.
It is heard:
The Dao’s grace explores the depths,
Proclaiming the true scripture to save suffering;
The shadowed path now fortunate,
Hearing the Sage’s title to ascend.
With steadfast resolve and reverent heart,
We earnestly pray for deliverance.
Now ascending to the scripture’s seat,
Voices unite in chant,
Reciting the wondrous scripture,
Extolling the Venerable Title.
Offered as the vegetarian master,
To aid and commend the departed souls.
Leveraging the power of the Auspicious Cause,
Erasing the sins of countless *kalpas*.
Exempt from the Northwest’s Examiners’ scrutiny,
Directly proceeding to the Realm of Boundless Salvation.
The assembly, in pious devotion,
Voices unite in chant.
When the scripture concludes,
Again to the Northwest we go."*

**The Station Reports to the Sage:**

*"The station humbly reports to the Sage.
For guilt’s reality is pitiable,
Yet by the Dao’s grace we are delivered;
The mind rests not, relying on the scripture’s power to take root.
With sincere surrender, we must bathe in transcendent blessings.
Before the purified assembly,
Voices unite in chant:
Reciting the wondrous scripture—
Now completed eight cycles.
Offered as the vegetarian master,
To aid and commend the departed souls,
Ascending to the immortal realm.
May past karmic debts be absolved,
Soul and spirit clarified.
Exiting the murky Northwest’s domain,
Ascending to the realm of blessed stillness and splendor.
All the Supreme True Talismans shall now be proclaimed.
Proclaim the talismans, open the gates,
Conduct the Sage upward.
Kneeling in petition:
The station, trembling in awe, prostrates with head and hands,
Twice bows, and reports to the Jade Emptiness Bright Sovereign of the Upper Realm,
The Saving-Suffering True Child of the Upper Realm,
And the boundless True Assembly.
With reverence, we await the Sage’s compassion,
That You may condescend to pierce the mysteries.
For the Void’s subtle realm,
Manifests the Great Range’s mysterious virtue;
The Azure Sky’s pure winds,
Fan the natural grand cycle.
True virtue is boundless,
Wisdom’s blessings unfathomable.
Encompassing the vault of heaven,
Regulating the cosmic symbols’ array.
Having now completed nine cycles of the scripture,
All beings shall be universally saved.
Dare we petition the divine authorities,
Thus issuing talismans to the curved halls.
Not relying on mere creation’s grandeur,
Yet how can we grasp the profound grace?
We humbly pray that the jade carriage and crimson palanquin
May come to witness the assembly of the Ten True Ones;
The jade cases and treasure scrolls,
To encompass the ninefold cycles’ merit."*

(Your humble servant) dares to trespass upon the Sacred Majesty, with deepest sincerity beseeching and praying. The devout assembly, in pious reverence, now humbly submits its petition.

We request the Sage to appear, scatter sacred flowers, and ascend the platform to recite the **ninth cycle** of the scripture. As we hear, the True Teachings flow forth, illuminating the dharma-lamp upon the darkened crossroads; the Auspicious Name resounds, guiding the Compassionate Vessel across the Sea of Suffering. All beings, human and celestial, are universally delivered, and all return to the True Dao.

Now, as we ascend to the scripture seat, voices unite in harmony. We chant and recite the wondrous scripture, extolling the Glorious Name. We offer as the host of the **vegetarian ritual** (*zhāizhǔ*), providing sustenance to the departed spirits. Relying upon the wondrous power of auspicious causes, we expunge the sins of countless kalpas.

Thus, we avoid the scrutiny of the **Divine Authorities of the Upper Realm** (*shàngfāng kǎoduì*), and directly proceed to the **Land of Seven Treasures and Azure Celestial Realm** (*qībǎo zǐxiāo guó*). The devout assembly, in pious reverence, chants in unison.

When the scripture is complete, we once more visit the **Divine Authorities of the Upper Realm**, humbly presenting our petition. We pray that the **Formless and Selfless** (*wúmíng wúwǒ*) may guide all living beings; that the **Unwayward and Unwasteful** (*bùmí bùhuāng*) may awaken them to the True Dao. The subtleties are unfathomable even across countless kalpas, yet with sincere devotion, we attain the power of **mysterious communication** (*gǎntōng*).

The previous devout assembly, with voices united in harmony, has chanted the wondrous scripture, extolling the Glorious Name, completing the nine cycles. We offer as the host of the vegetarian ritual, providing sustenance to the departed spirits, and guide them to the **Immortal Realm** (*xiān jiè*). We humbly wish that the **darkness of the soul** (*huǒyì*) may be purified into the **Clear Pavilion** (*qīngshǔ*), and the **sword-trees** (*jiànshù*) transformed into **auspicious carriages** (*yuè*). May the spirits depart from the **Netherworld** (*yōutú*), ascending to the **Azure Celestial Realm** (*bìluò*).

All the **True Talismans of the Highest Sage** (*Tàishàng zhēnfú*), we shall now solemnly proclaim. Proclaiming the talismans, opening the **passages** (*guān*), and escorting the Sage, we kneel and pray to the **Divine Authorities of the Lower Realm** (*xiàfāng zhēnhuáng*).

With deepest sincerity and humility, we kneel, bow, and prostrate ourselves twice. We pray to the **True Sovereign of the Lower Realm** (*xiàfāng zhēnhuáng*), the **Divine Lord of the Cavernous Mysteries** (*Dòngshén tiānzūn*), the **Sage of the Lower Reaches** (*xiàxiāng jiùkǔ*), the **True Personhood Child** (*zhēnrén tóngzi*), and the **Formless Devout Assembly** (*wúyàng zhēnzhòng*). With reverent gaze upon the Sacred Compassion, we humbly beseech Your piercing insight.

We pray that the **vast expanse of the world** (*fāngyuè*) bears all things with boundless faith, and that the **Great Sage’s teachings** (*Dàxiān jiào*) are imparted without prejudice; that the **profound virtue** (*shòudé*) ensures stability and that the **vast foundation** (*hóngjī*) is laid eternally firm. All benefit from the Dao’s power, and all achieve the **wondrous divine functions** (*shén gōng*).

The scripture is proclaimed to deliver all beings in the **Nine Abysses** (*jiǔ quán*), and the teachings are now fully heard in **ten cycles** (*shí biàn*). All receive the merit and attain liberation, ascending to the sacred and transcending the mundane.

We dare to petition the **Divine Authorities** (*língsī*), thus issuing talismans to the **curved halls** (*qūfǔ*). Not relying upon mere creation’s grandeur, yet how can we grasp the profound grace?

We humbly pray that the **jade carriage and crimson palanquin** (*lǜshèng dān yú*) may come to witness the assembly of the **Ten True Ones** (*shí zhēn*); the **jade cases and treasure scrolls** (*lánghán bǎojiè*), to encompass the merit of the ten cycles.

(Your humble servant) dares to trespass upon the Sacred Majesty, with deepest sincerity beseeching and praying. The devout assembly, in pious reverence, now humbly submits its petition.

We request the Sage to appear, scatter sacred flowers, and ascend the platform to recite the **tenth cycle** of the scripture. As we hear, the **Eastern Extremity’s Benevolent Father** (*Dōngjí cífù*), the **Venerable Lord of Azure Mysteries** (*Qīngxuǎn lǎojūn*), pours forth the **dharma-rain** (*fǎyǔ*) to nourish all beings, and spreads the **Compassionate Clouds** (*cíyún*) to cover all realms. The grace extends to the **Nine Earths** (*jiǔdì*), and the blessings reach the **Ten Directions** (*shífāng*).

Now, as we ascend to the scripture seat, voices unite in harmony. We chant and recite the wondrous scripture, extolling the Glorious Name. We offer as the host of the vegetarian ritual, providing sustenance to the departed spirits. Relying upon the wondrous power of auspicious causes, we expunge the sins of countless kalpas.

Thus, we avoid the scrutiny of the **Divine Authorities of the Lower Realm** (*xiàfāng kǎoduì*), and directly proceed to the **Pure Land of Splendid Ornamentation** (*jìngtǔ zhuāngyán guó*). The devout assembly, in pious reverence, chants in unison.

When the scripture is complete, we once more visit the **Divine Authorities of the Lower Realm**, humbly presenting our petition. We pray that the **Supreme True Teachings** (*shàngzhuāng zhēnjiào*) are now fully revealed, and the Dao’s power pervades all.

Wondrous indeed are the **Three Caverns’ Scriptures** (*sāndòng jīng*); supreme is the **might of virtue and spirit** (*wēishén lì*). It reaches the **Clear Pavilion of the Highest Realm** (*qīngdū zǐfǔ*) above and descends to the **Netherworld’s Black Soil and Yellow Springs** (*hēirǎng huáng quán*) below. All are granted transcendence, and all receive the blessings.

The previous devout assembly, with voices united in harmony, has chanted the wondrous scripture, extolling the Glorious Name, completing the ten cycles. We offer as the host of the vegetarian ritual, providing sustenance to the departed spirits, and guide them to the **Immortal Realm**.

We humbly wish to gather the **refined essence** (*wěi qì*), achieve the **mystic power** (*fǎng gōng*), and ascend to the **True Dao** (*zhēndào*). Though transcending the **Three Realms** (*sānjiè*) is difficult, we may directly ascend to the **Heaven of Primordial Origin** (*Yuánshǐ tiān*).

All the **True Talismans of the Highest Sage**, we shall now solemnly proclaim. Proclaiming the talismans, opening the passages, and escorting the Sage, we **chant the scripture in awe**.

The **Scripture** is the direct path, pointing to its way and returning to it.

Practicing the Dao and cultivating the True, saving the living and guiding the dead—unobstructed and boundless in all directions. With this direct path,
when applied to the **refined essence** (*jīng*), one can reverse the flow and enter the brain.
When the brain is full, the body grows strong—this is the method of **root-searching without leakage** and **preserving life for longevity**, the marvel of those who practice as Earth Immortals.

When applied to the **spirit** (*shén*), one attains inner vision and reversed hearing, reaching the utmost emptiness and tranquility, with purity fully established within. Heavenly light shines radiant—this is the marvel of those who practice as Spirit Immortals.

When applied to the **qi**, one can draw the **flying roots** of the Great Compass, inhaling and exhaling the **Primordial Sovereign’s** heavenly breath.
The **qi** emerges from **Kan** and enters **Kun**, forming a **formless body**—known as the **Supreme Heavenly Venerable**—this is the marvel of those who practice as Heavenly Immortals.

Practicing this path:
To abandon **emotions and desires** is to sever the root of birth and death;
To cast off **deceit and falsehood** is to ascend to the gates of myriad wonders;
To transcend all **things** is to surpass the world and emerge from dust.

Practicing this path at the time of **yang vitality** (*yángshēng*), one turns the **Celestial Pivot** (*Xuánxī*), working within the **single breath** to cause **golden essence** to flow upon the crown and **silver waves** to surge open.
With the brain now full, one enters the **accumulation of merit** (*gōngdé*).
Water flows through, the nose opens, the mouth returns to the throat and merges with the **Yellow Court** (*Huángtíng*), refining the **inner elixir** (*zhōng dān*).
When practiced for long,
the marrow fills, the bones harden, and the hundred limbs grow firm and sealed—
**no cold, no heat, no sickness or affliction** touches one.
This is the **manifestation of Earth Immortals**.

Practicing this path,
one maintains inner vision and reversed hearing,
guarding the **True One** (*yīzhēn*) within the **Upper Field of Yellow Chamber** (*Shàngtián Huángfáng*).
Never does it depart, even for a moment.
Though engaging with affairs and using the body,
one’s **mind remains ever warm** (*yīwēn*), warm within the Yellow Court.
In stillness, one guards constantly;
In motion, one remains ever serene.
Serene, one becomes clear;
Clear, one returns to the Upper Field.
After long practice, one attains **Great Tranquility** (*Tàidìng*), then **white light** and **round symbol** radiate, dazzling the chamber.
When someone approaches me,
I know them first—
this is the **manifestation of Spirit Immortals**.

Practicing this path,
one **ingests qi** (*fú qì*) at dawn,
and **closes the breath** (*bìxī*) at night, in stillness.
Ingesting qi means
**consuming the essence of Great Harmony** and the **vitality of the Two Scenes** (*liǎng jǐng*).
When **heavenly qi** enters the body, the hundred spirits become **responsive**.
With **spirit guiding qi**, the qi **lingers long**.
Having obtained its breath,
one accumulates it again and again—
**accumulating water forms seas**,
**accumulating qi forms spirit**.
Spirit condenses and forms the embryo;
a body grows within the body—
this is the **manifestation of Heavenly Immortals**.

Observing my **heart**,
as vast as the **Great Void**.
Observing my **body**,
as boundless as the **Great Emptiness**.
Wandering through all things,
all are **illusion and transformation**,
ultimately returning to **annihilation**.
Not one thing or deed
can shake my **heart**.

My **spirit** is ever serene—
serene, I do not know
the **Great Emptiness** as *me*,
nor *me* as the Great Emptiness—
this is the **marvelous response of the path**.

Thus, practicing this path,
with **idle resolve** and **neglected merit**,
one extinguishes the **Great Dao**—
it will not succeed.

Observing this path,
**common folk** cannot practice it
and thus fail to reveal its marvels.
Common folk without this path
cannot verify its **practitioners’ merits**—
its **effects and applications**.

The **Dao** is the **essence** of the Scripture;
The Scripture is the **application** of the Dao.
When essence and application are both forgotten,
the Dao **becomes luminous**.

Thus, one forgets what is forgotten,
yet does not forget the forgotten itself.

Repeating the **gāthā** again:
*"To become an Immortal or a Buddha—origins differ,*
*Yet all unite in one path, marvelous and complete.*
*Piercing these knots of illusion,*
*No existence, no nonexistence—*
*Yet nonexistence returns to existence.*
**Threefold Hearing of the Scripture**,
**Yellow Arrow Ritual for Saving Suffering**,
**Tenfold Vegetarian Offerings**—
the **Ritual of Turning the Scripture** is now complete."*
