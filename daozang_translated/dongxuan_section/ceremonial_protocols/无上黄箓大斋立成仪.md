**Preface to the Fast (First)**

The wondrous scriptures of the *Ten Divisions of the Numinous Treasure*, thirty-six scrolls in all, arose before the Primordial Beginning, within the Void and Emptiness. Before heaven and earth took root, before sun and moon shone forth, in the profound obscurity—without ancestor, without origin—they abided. When the numinous charts transformed the kalpas and the mysterious signs shifted in succession, the True Writings in jade characters were decreed by the Primordial Beginning. The Perfected Ones held the brush, the Jade Consorts swept the mats. Gold was cast into tablets, jade carved into chapters. They were concealed in the Seven Treasures of the Jade Capital, the Mysterious Terrace of the Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace, where the hosts of Perfected guarded and celebrated the numinous texts.

Above, they are called *Numinous*: they stabilize the Five Peaks, secure the state, and ensure enduring existence. Below, they are called *Treasure*: the mysterious and wondrous Numinous Treasure, supreme over all things. Their measure is unfathomable, vast as the great void. By ancient statutes, they emerge once every forty thousand kalpas, transmitted only to those whose names are inscribed in golden registers in past lives and who are destined to become immortals in this one.

The Great Dao Lord of the Jade Clarity, moved by the suffering of the multitudes in the mortal realm and the torments of hell, earnestly entreated and descended into the world—this is truly the origin of the fast’s method. Harmonizing heaven and pacifying earth, protecting the state and stabilizing the household, delivering the dead and aiding the living, seeking immortality and studying the Dao: all these are propagated through this scripture, beyond words to proclaim.

The Supreme Great Dao Lord addressed the High Mystery Great Dharma Master, saying: "Those who enter my gate of the Dao first aspire to become divine immortals, soaring through the vault of heaven. Next, they wish for the peace of their families and states, transcending ten thousand calamities. To dispel disasters and eradicate misfortunes, to pray for blessings and seek grace—one must first perform the Numinous Treasure Fast. Above, it dissolves the heavy transgressions of past lives and severs evil karmic ties; below, it resolves the sins and errors accumulated since one’s own cultivation began. Diligently practicing the fast’s uprightness, one may sit and attain flight as an immortal—this is the foundation of conduct and the origin of seeking the Dao. Without this method, one’s efforts are in vain. If the roots of past karma remain unresolved, the sagely Dao will fade into obscurity. Though we have heard these words in antiquity, few today have seen such a person."

The Perfected One of the Supreme Ultimate said: "The Supreme Fast of the Numinous Treasure was constantly practiced without weariness by the August Lord of the Dao, the Heavenly Worthy, the Great Sage. How much more should Daoists and immortals yearn for and admire it?"

The Most High Lord Lao said: "Among the priorities of the Daoist family, none is closer than the fast. Though fasts are many, with minor variations, the one of greatest merit is the Numinous Treasure Fast. Few in the world can study it. Those who do are all persons of the Great Vehicle, whose past lives have accumulated blessings, bringing them near to immortality. By purifying the fast and reciting scriptures, the Dao of immortality is naturally achieved—why must one hide in mountains and marshes?"

In former times, the Perfected One of the Orthodox Unity received the mandate to guide the world and bear the Numinous Treasure. Deeming the purport of the fast’s methods profound and its prohibitions strict, he recognized that shallow beginners could not comprehend them. Thus, he exquisitely produced the *Five Invocations* and established the *Orthodox Unity Fast*, designating it as the *Essential Teaching* to bequeath to the Libationers and Register Disciples. The teachings of the Numinous Treasure were secret and not transmitted, passed down orally from immortal to immortal. The Perfected Lord of the Supreme Ultimate first penned its written records, expounding the secrets of the fast’s dignity and ritual. Master Lu of the Heavenly Master further compiled and arranged it, establishing it as a complete ritual. From the invocation of incense to the memorials, the summoning of officials to the petitions, the rites of gratitude and the recitation of vows—all were based on the scriptural texts.

Zhang and Du, the two masters, subsequently emerged to propagate the mysterious wind, further clarifying the forms of ascending the altar and bowing. Though centuries separated them, their paths were as one. Yet lamenting the incompetence of later masters and the ignorance of those who transmitted the teachings, they saw how deviations from the proper lineage led to unrecognized errors. Convenience was mistaken for appropriateness, and ancient methods were deemed too difficult. Since the time of Heavenly Master Zhang Wanfu, this had been a cause for concern.

In the present age, while offering rituals spread throughout the realm, the methods of the fast have nearly vanished without a trace. Even among the few who practice them, none follow the ancient origins. Trusting in later masters, they scorn the former sages, drifting with vulgar customs and contravening the scriptural teachings. The altar rituals are crude, the liturgical forms erroneous. What one creates, another imitates, and thus it becomes established practice. They exert themselves tirelessly in pursuit of trivialities, indulging in deceptive and bizarre illusions, believing that without these, they cannot inspire faith in the vulgar. Yet the grand rituals of the Purple Palace and the secret classics of the Mysterious Terrace—through which heaven and humanity are delivered and the cycles of birth and death stilled—have been nearly lost, fading day by day. How grievous this is!

All the various fasts of the Three Caverns take the divine scriptures as their foundation and repentance as their priority. From ascending the altar to invoking blessings, all follow the ancient texts of the Dragon Han era. To act in accordance with these texts is to perform the fast’s method. Now, I have gathered the wondrous scriptures of the Ten Divisions, the liturgical regulations of the Three Caverns, the mysterious norms of the Numinous Treasure, and the ancient fast’s lineage of rituals transmitted by Liu Chongjing. Comparing these with the received methods and secrets, I have verified, compiled, and edited them into a complete work of thirty-six scrolls. The above follows the footsteps of Masters Zhang and Du, consolidating the fast’s methods into a single gate, summarizing its essentials, and correcting its errors. Each scriptural passage is traced to its source, and each matter is clarified and rectified, so that those who undertake the fast may have a path to follow and may rely on the texts for practical application. Though this is not the same as personally receiving the ritual norms from the Supreme One’s own presence, the scriptures’ luminous clarity suffices as a model. The Dao is propagated by people—what is there that cannot be achieved?

The Heavenly Worthy addressed the Supreme Lord of the Dao, saying: "In the Dragon Han kalpa, I accompanied the Three Treasures. By the time of the Vermilion Clarity, I had manifested in every age, teaching the Dao of the Three Vehicles. All the past perfected ones, the sagely and divine, the myriad heavenly emperors and kings, and the wondrously accomplished Perfected Ones—none failed to follow the ritual dignity, cultivate the great method, and thereby attain the natural."

Now you must test and teach the Three Dynasties, delving into the true scriptures. It is fitting to prepare the celestial rites and open the path of salvation for all beings, that those with aspiration may attain the state of divine transcendence. Within the Three Primordials’ Palace of Numinous Treasure, there are three divisions of ritual dignity, comprising twenty-four articles. The Upper Primordial governs all Perfected Ones, the Middle Primordial governs all spirits, and the Lower Primordial governs all immortals—above corresponding to the twenty-four Perfected Ones, in the middle corresponding to the twenty-four spirits, and below corresponding to the twenty-four qi. The Three Divisions of the Eight Luminaries are the origin of all beginnings. Today I transmit them to you in full. This Dao is most revered and weighty; guard it well and do not transmit it lightly.

In future ages, when the kalpa grows short and human hearts decay, heterodox thoughts will arise, and the scriptures and methods will no longer be trusted. My scriptures shall return to the Three Primordials’ Palace. They will reemerge only when the pure qi of the Three Dynasties converges, when the essence of the Dragon rides the dawn, and when the world attains great peace. For now, the true scriptures and secret canons remain in the lower world and have not yet returned to the Three Heavens. Even if true immortals were to reappear in the world, they would know that these texts are not easily obtained.

The methods of fasting and ritual are manifold, with many expedient means. The forms of invocation, prayer, and revelation may vary according to use. Yet in the standards of ritual dignity—whether bowing or rising—they cannot differ by even an inch. The essential principle does not exceed these bounds. If one can embody purity and emptiness as the foundation, tranquility and simplicity as the function, settle the spirit and stabilize the qi, and maintain a serene mind, contemplating the divine and invoking the Perfected while adhering to the rites, then when one prays to the Perfected, the Perfected will surely descend.

The Ten Divisions of Wondrous Scriptures are the origin of all Numinous Treasure fasts. When establishing a fast, they are placed within the altar’s precincts. The rites of offering and reverence must not be omitted. As the *Scripture of Lingchong’s Pacification* states: "Take the Three Caverns’ true scriptures as the root of the Dao, and the repentances of the Ten Directions as the mark of sincerity." Nine mornings of concentrated thought, three secret petitions—these words summarize it all.

Those who perform the fasts should serve as officers of the Three Caverns and receive the highest methods, that they may encounter no obstacles in the ritual proceedings. If one acts hastily to suit the times, one will only hasten the violation of the mysterious statutes.

Yet the Ten Divisions of Wondrous Scriptures are rare in the world; some spend their entire lives without even glimpsing their titles. Therefore, I respectfully list the scriptures for pacifying and consecrating the fast altar, as follows. If these teachings circulate in the world, the methods of fasting may yet be preserved.

**General Formula for Establishing a Fast (Second Section)**
The scripture states: "To deliver the seven ancestors and rescue those in the three evil destinies." The Yellow Register’s Great Fast is foremost among all. To verify its efficacy in salvation, first examine the person. If their sincerity is earnest and their devotion unwavering, and if they adhere to the ritual codes, then the fast may be properly conducted. Only then may they be permitted to submit the formal petition, along with the fast’s ritual offerings.

The altar should be established in grotto-heavens, blessed lands, oratories on famous mountains, or numinous altars within temples—not in places ravaged by war, execution grounds, slaughterhouses, prisons, birthing chambers, tombs, or defiled sites. Choose auspicious days such as the Three Primordials’ festivals, the Eight Nodes, the Five La Days, the Three Assemblies, or other propitious dates like Gengshen, Jiazi, the Four Beginnings, the Ten Upright Days, Heaven’s Grace, or Heaven’s Amnesty—these are called "auspicious days." If the fast is dedicated solely to delivering ancestors, it should coincide with the deceased’s seven sevens, hundredth day, major and minor anniversaries, or distant taboo days.

Once the fast’s ritual offerings are prepared, the sponsor should bring them to the master’s gate, submit the petition, and receive the formal acceptance. The sponsor is then led before the Dao to take the incense of offering and burn it in supplication. After the petition is received, the master commands fellow disciples and like-minded companions to join in the fast’s merit. "Fellow disciples" refers to those who serve the Dao, attend the altar, and assist the master. "Like-minded companions" refers to those who share the same aspiration to universally benefit the living and the dead. If unsuitable persons are included, harmonious qi will not arise, and the merit will be diminished.

After receiving the petition, the master, the sponsor, and the disciples should focus their minds single-pointedly on the salvation of beings.

The preparation of documents and ritual implements must be thorough, ensuring nothing is lacking when needed. Select an auspicious day to establish the fast altar. At the center of the altar, upon the Three Treasures’ throne, set up a canopy and seat with a jeweled cover. Place the sacred scriptures within, and arrange the inner altar with nineteen incense tables, banners, flowers, lamps, and tassels, all laid out according to ritual protocol.

To the left and right before the altar, six tents are erected as prescribed. In the central tent, the Nine Dark Spirits’ tablet is positioned. Alternatively, at the Heavenly Gate atop the altar or along its outer perimeter, lamps are lit in accordance with the ritual. To the southeast, as depicted, the Revolving Radiance Wheel Lamp is arranged. To the northeast, the Nine Hells Lamps are laid out. On the altar’s left, the Refining and Salvation Hall is set in order, where the sacred altar for refining souls is enshrined. On the altar’s right, the Divine Tiger Hall is arranged, where the sacred altar for summoning souls is enshrined.

To the southeast of the altar, the Reception and Salvation Hall is established, directly aligned with the positions of the sponsor’s nine generations of deceased ancestors. Behind the altar, the ritual arena is arranged with the Emperor’s throne at its center and the feast altars for the sacred beings arrayed on either side. Before the ritual arena, a separate altar is set for the Orthodox Unity Master, where the Celestial Master, Mystic Master, Female Master, Successor Master, and Lineage Master are venerated. Another separate altar is prepared for the Attendant Petitioning Divine Officials, where the divine officials of the Precious Petition Office are enshrined.

Before the fast altar is opened, all petitions and memorials are presented within the ritual arena. Outside the arena, the Earth God’s tablet is placed to oversee the proceedings. Thirty-two days—or twenty-four days—prior, depending on the number of deceased to be delivered, the Merit-Officials, Talisman-Messengers, and Earth Gods are summoned to notify the Three Clarities, Jade Emperor, Heavenly Sovereign, Northern and Eastern Poles, Five Masters, Three Officials, Heavenly Pivot Institute, Earth-Water-Mountain Offices, and the city gods of all major prefectures and counties. Banners are raised to pledge alliance with the Three Realms.

A separate chamber is designated for scripture recitation, where the opening of sutras and proclamation of memorials commence. From this point onward, daily devotions are conducted with utmost focus, reciting scriptures such as the *Uppermost Scripture for Delivering Beings*, *Precious Chapters for Generating the Spirit*, *Golden Register for Delivering Lives*, and *Scriptures for Attaining the Dao and Rescuing the Suffering*. The *Repentance Rites of the Nine Dark Realms Before Heaven* are performed, and the sacred titles of the Jade Emperor, Supreme Unity Heavenly Worthy, and the Ten Directions’ Enlightened Beings are chanted, with merit accruing through repetition. The printing and burning of scriptures, however, have limited efficacy.

From this time, the master, sponsor, and others enter seclusion to fast, abstaining from external affairs. Ten days—or seven days—prior, depending on the circumstances, a formal memorial is presented to the Three Clarities, Jade Emperor, Gouchen, Purple Tenuity, Earth God, Eastern and Southern Poles, True King of the Nine Dark and Vermilion Mound Grotto, Five Elders of the Ten Directions, Nine Heavens’ Emperors, Thirty-Two Heavens, Wood Duke and Metal Mother, Sun and Moon Palaces, Five Planets and Four Luminaries, Five Directions’ Five Bushels, Northern and Southern Bushels, Five Masters and Three Officials, Numinous Treasure Overseers of the Fast, Orthodox Unity Three Masters, Three Ministries and Five Offices, Three Origins and Four Saints, Nine Heavens’ Heavenly Offices, all Perfected and Heavenly Perfected Ones, Flying Heavenly Divine Kings, Thunder and Lightning True Lords, Ten Poles’ Perfected Ones, Precious Mandates and Registers of the Southern Prosperity Upper Palace, Water Bureau’s General Water Overseer, Five Sacred Peaks and Four Waterways, Nine Rivers and Nine Ramparts, Earth Prisons and Grotto-Heavens, Year-Star Venerable Spirits, Dragon and Tiger Lords, and others.

A memorial is also sent to the city gods of all major prefectures and counties, the state-recognized deities, all Daoist prisons, the Nine Provinces’ Earth Lords, the Lord of the Yellow Springs, the Water and Land Passes, the Five Directions’ Boundary Spirits, the Dark Passes and Hidden Paths, the Five Roads’ Great Spirits, the Six Paths’ General Registrars, the Altar-Monitoring Divine Officials, the relevant bureau officers, and the life-recording Earth Gods. A special memorial is dispatched to the Three Realms’ Direct Talisman-Officials and the Divine Tiger Pursuit and Summoning Messengers, bearing official documents to the Earth-Water Offices to trace and summon the deceased souls for deliverance, awaiting their arrival at the altar.

Next, the banners for Transcending the Spirit and Delivering the Deceased are erected. Once the memorials are submitted, the Dharma Master inscribes talismans and opens the deliverance registers. Seven days—or five or four days—prior, within the ritual arena, the *Precious Chapter for Dispelling Filth from the Mystic Vault* is reverently presented. Following this, the *Petition for Pardoning Sins in Fengdu*, the *Original Beginning’s Mandate for Deliverance and True Talisman for Rescuing the Suffering*, the *Jade Clarity’s True Talisman for Delivering Dark Souls*, the *True Talisman for Breaking Hell*, and the *Supreme Lord’s Edict for Pardoning and Register for Ascending to Heaven’s Azure Palace Nine-Dragon Mandate* are successively presented. Then, petitions for *Opening the Path*, *Bathing*, and *Refining and Salvation* are offered.

Two days prior, the Dharma Master gathers the feathered and streamered ritualists to ascend the altar and rehearse the ceremonial protocols. On the day before the fast begins, at noon, the bell is sounded. The altar officers, sponsor, and ritual attendants respectfully invite the Dharma Master into the secluded chamber. Each first determines their role, signs the duty roster, and stands in order. The Dharma Master is invited to take his seat, and the sponsor performs nine bows and three prostrations, kneeling to present the invitation for the master to ascend the altar. Once the master consents, the master of ceremonies escorts him to the high seat, where incense is offered, the seat is consecrated, and the alliance is pledged. The master then descends, and the alliance document is signed.

The duty officer announces the proceedings, and the Dharma Master exits the chamber to stand before the tent. The sponsor accompanies the master to the Mystic Master’s tent, where incense is offered, and the Mystic Master is invited to descend. The memorial is presented, the alliance document read, and both are burned together. At the Five Emperors’ tent, the Five Emperors are invited to descend, the memorial presented, the alliance document read, and both burned as before. Next, at the Celestial Master’s tent, the Celestial Master is invited to descend, the memorial presented, the alliance document read, and the memorial burned while the alliance document is retained in the tent. At the Three Masters’ tent, the Three Masters are invited to descend, following the Mystic Master’s protocol. At the Three Officials’ tent, the Three Officials are invited to descend, following the Five Emperors’ protocol. At the Fast Overseers’ tent, the Fast Overseers are invited to descend, following the Three Masters’ protocol.

Afterward, they proceed to the outer altar’s entrance, where the assembly stands in order below the altar. The Dharma Master leads all in holding water vessels and willow branches, reciting the *Purification Mantra for Heaven and Earth*.

In sequence, they ascend the altar. After the purification is complete, the altar is consecrated according to the ritual. Proceeding to the Hall of the Divine Tiger, the jade tablets are sealed and the celestial writs dispatched at dusk.

The Dharma Master ascends the altar to distribute the lamps, while attendants light them in proper order, ensuring illumination both within and without. The Dharma Master then retires to the Hall of Silent Repose. The Ritual Officer and disciples, maintaining full dignity, reverently invite the Dharma Master to ascend the altar for the overnight invocation.

The Dharma Master and Ritual Officer pay respects at the six tents: first to the Five Emperors, then to the Three Masters, the Fast Overseers, the Three Officials, the Celestial Master, and finally the Mystic Master. The Dharma Master leads the assembly of officials to stand in ordered ranks before the Mystic Master. The Ritual Officer offers incense, presents the document case, and declares the purpose of the fast. The Document Master receives the text, and the Dharma Master, having accepted the document, announces the fast and intones the *Dao Hymn*.

Next, leading the assembly to the outer gate, they stand in order below the altar. The Dharma Master offers incense and makes the invocation. The Scripture Attendant reads the altar memorial, which is then burned outside the altar. The golden bells and jade chimes resound as they ascend the altar according to the ritual. Turning to the Earth Gate, the Dharma Master recites a secret incantation to enter, then leads the assembly in ascending the central altar to the Heavenly Gate.

The Dharma Master alone ascends the inner altar, offers incense, and performs the rites. Following the prescribed overnight invocation, the true writs are displayed, the memorial to the Divine Officials is read, the precepts are recited, offices are conferred, prohibitions are declared, the tents are dismissed, faults are acknowledged and atoned, the lamps are reverenced according to the ritual, the spirits are summoned and bathed, led in audience, and sent back to their stations. Scriptures are chanted, and food is consecrated by incantation.

**First Day:** The main fast is observed. Respects are paid at the six tents, and the *Three Times Circumambulation of the Dao* is performed as prescribed. The scriptures are recited twice, and each morning the spirits are led below the altar to pay homage to the Three Treasures and repent transgressions. After the incense is lit and the officials are dispatched, the spirits are led to the altar for the Great Thanksgiving, then returned to their stations. In the stillness of night, the Dharma Master approaches the Nine Prisons’ Spirit Lamps, invokes the purity of King Qing, and breaks the true talisman of the Earth Prisons. Following the ritual, the lamps are repented before, the *Ninefold Pure Brahman Chant* and the *Prison-Breaking Incantation* are recited, the staff is wielded, and the talisman is activated to break the prisons. If the overnight invocation has not yet been performed, conducting it beforehand is especially efficacious. The Nine Dark Lamps are reverenced, and the *Repentance of the Radiant Wheel Lamp* is performed.

**Second Day:** The main fast and *Circumambulation of the Dao* proceed as on the first day. In the stillness of night, the Nine Springs and Six Paths are universally summoned, the full forms are bathed, the *Bushel Refinement* is performed, the precepts are bestowed, and talismans are transmitted.

**Third Day:** The main fast and *Circumambulation of the Dao* proceed as on the second day. In the evening audience, the *Lingbao Chapters for Ascending the Dead* are presented. In the stillness of night, the *Refinement and Transformation* is performed, the deceased souls are transmuted, the *Ninefold True Wondrous Precepts* are transmitted, the *Talisman of Eternal Life* is announced, the certificates and decrees are issued, the Three Corpses are severed, the Five Passes are transcended, and the souls ascend the Dharma Bridge. The guardians of the Heavenly Gate are petitioned to protect and escort the deceased souls to the Heavenly Palace.

**Fourth Day:** At dawn—or the previous day if preferred—the documents are sealed and the offering is prepared. A memorial is presented to the Three Pure Ones and the Supreme Emperor, and a petition is submitted to the Three Great Officials. On the appointed day, the *Dragon Tablets* are cast. Following the prescribed order, the altar is dispersed, obeisances are made, the merits are recorded in vermilion, the precepts are returned, offices are relinquished, the Three Treasures are bid farewell, and the altar’s notices are removed.

Next, farewells are made to the Five Emperors, the Three Masters, the Fast Overseers, the Three Officials, and the Celestial Master. Proceeding to the Mystic Master, the assembly performs the *Transfer of Merit*, offers thanks, and bows in farewell before the tents are dismantled. The tablets are buried, and the *Dragon Tablets* are cast. The Ritual Officer and disciples offer thanks, and the Dharma Master receives their obeisance.

At night, an offering is made to express gratitude, and the *Chariot, Carriage, Paper Money, and Horses* are presented. The *General Merit Memorial* is addressed to the Three Pure Ones and the Jade Emperor, the *Lingbao Five Masters*, the merits are reported to the Three Officials, the Eastern Marchmount is petitioned, the city gods are dismissed, the shrines are closed, and the *No-Tablet* is issued to the *Functionaries, Earth Gods*, and others, with merits distributed according to rank.

Upon completion, the Dharma Master returns to the hall, and the disciples bow in gratitude, exchanging congratulations on the ritual’s success.

**Third Precept of Faithfulness:**
The scripture states: “In ancient times, people were simple and sincere, embracing the Dao and holding fast to virtue.”

They are neither greedy nor desirous, each content with what they possess.
With but sincerity of intent, one may naturally achieve resonance.
No need for wealth or treasure—mysteriously uniting with Heaven’s truth.
In this degenerate age, people are cunning and deceitful,
coveting only wealth and goods, unaware of karmic conditions.
They scorn life and prize riches, ruining families and destroying states.
Within, they harbor myriad evils; without, they ally with wickedness.
One after another, they perish, never awakening to their folly.
For this reason, they are commanded to disperse.
First, external threats will not arise, and within and without, all will be at peace.
All misfortunes will vanish—thus, sincerity and faithfulness begin with wealth.
If wealth can be relinquished, the heart will follow.
The sagely and wise, clear and responsive, act according to the heart’s intent.
High Heaven and the vast Earth, the mysterious sages and perfected transcendents—
without faith, there is no resonance; without the heart, there is no response.
The utmost in resonance and response lies in faith.

**Thirteen gold dragons**—ten to be placed in the ten directions, three to accompany the *simpl* when cast.
Each gold dragon weighs one *liang* and measures three *cun* and six *fen*.
The state uses the finest gold, nobles and high ministers use secondary gold, while scholars and commoners may use silver, copper, or gilded metal—all are acceptable.

The *Regulations* state: The dragon serves as Heaven’s courier.
For transmitting messages and achieving resonance, the dragon courier takes precedence.
Carrying the *simpl*, it ascends to deliver faith to the Three Officials;
presenting the oath, it reports the covenant to the Ten Poles.
The method of securing faith begins with the dragon.
Those who omit this will be examined by the *Yin Officials’ Bureau*.

**Eleven segments of colored silk**—ten for the ten directions, one for the *mingxin*.
East: nine segments of blue-green silk.
South: three segments of crimson silk.
West: seven segments of white silk.
North: five segments of black silk.
Above: thirty-two segments of azure silk.
Below: thirty-two segments of yellow silk.
The four corners: twelve segments of yellow silk each.
The ten directions total one hundred thirty-six segments.
The Son of Heaven uses bolts, feudal lords use *zhang*, scholars and commoners use *chi*.
The *mingxin* silk’s color: the Son of Heaven and feudal lords use purple; scholars and commoners use the color corresponding to their *natal tone*.
The length—bolt, *zhang*, or *chi*—follows the individual’s fate.
Add one extra to signify the pledge of extended life.

The *Regulations* state: The patterned silk manifests the colors of the Five Phases, symbolizing the *qi* of the ten directions.
It descends from the Ten Heavens, summons the Five Emperors, communicates with the perfected, and presents faith—seeking life and praying for numinous efficacy. This must not be omitted.
Those who omit this will be examined by the *Heavenly Officials’ Mystic Capital Bureau*.

**Ten sets of paper, ink, brush, and inkstone**—one set for each of the ten directions.
Each direction uses twelve sheets of paper.

The *Regulations* state: When establishing a fast and performing the Dao, whether to deliver countless generations of ancestors and departed spirits, or to pray for blessings, beseech grace, dispel calamities, or repent transgressions, the Four Controllers, Five Emperors, and the Three Realms and Ten Directions record good deeds and assess transgressions.
Thus, paper and brush serve as the register for recording merits and virtues, presenting faith to the ten directions. This must not be omitted.
Those who omit this will find the Ten Heavens and Five Emperors will not record their merits, and the Nine Dark Realms and Three Officials will not absolve their transgressions.
Those who omit this will be examined by the *Three Officials’ Bureau*.

**Ten portions of incense and flowers**.
The *Regulations* state: Incense serves to achieve resonance and dispel impurities.
Flowers, with their freshness and purity, symbolize auspiciousness and precious offerings—inviting blessings and praying to the perfected.
Incense and flowers are fundamental: incense should be *chenxiang* or *jiangzhen*, flowers should be fragrant and borne of trees.
If flowers are unavailable, five-colored paper cuttings may be used to secure the ten directions. This must not be omitted.
Those who omit this will be examined by the *Yin Officials’ Bureau*.

**Two *hu* and four *dou* of rice, or one *hu* and two *dou***.
The *Regulations* state: Rice secures faith with the Heavenly Officials and augments official rank and emolument.
Those who omit this will be examined by the *Heavenly Officials’ Bureau*.

**Two *dou* and four *sheng* of oil**.
The *Regulations* state: Oil belongs to the *yin* category.
Within *yin*, *yang* is born—using oil to secure *yin* ensures the continuation of *yang*’s radiance.
Those who omit this will be examined by the *Yin Officials’ Bureau*.

**Twenty-four *jin* of charcoal**.
The *Regulations* state: Charcoal belongs to the *yang* category.
Within *yang*, *yin* is born—using charcoal to secure *yang* provides for *yin* *qi*.
Those who omit this will be examined by the *Yang Officials’ Bureau*.

**Fourteen thousand coins, or two thousand four hundred, or one thousand one hundred**.
The *Regulations* state: Fourteen thousand gold coins substitute for the pledge of finest gold.
They present sincerity to the Three Realms and report the covenant to the Ten Heavens.
Those who omit this will be examined by the *Heavenly Officials’ Mystic Capital Bureau*.

**Three *hibiscus* wood *simpl***.
Each *simpl* measures one *chi* and two *cun* in length, two *cun* and four *fen* in width, and two *fen* in thickness.
The *Regulations* state: The *simpl* serves to record and report.
It records the age’s merits and reports the covenant to the perfected above and the proper directions below.
The Son of Heaven uses jade, for jade possesses nine virtues—signifying the pledge to Heaven and Earth.
Others use *hibiscus* wood, or other suitable wood, inscribed with cinnabar to represent the Five Phases.
The cinnabar inscription includes the state’s name, the year and month, the location of the fast, and the Dharma Master’s name.
It is cast into famous mountains and grottoes, sacred springs and dragon lairs, or within the fast’s altar, reporting to the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water, making the fast’s affairs known and submitting them to the upper realms.
Those who omit this will be examined by the *Earth Officials’ Nine Capitals Bureau*.

**Ten *jade bi* for the ten directions, and three *investiture dragons’ bi***.
Each *bi* for the ten directions measures two *cun* and four *fen* in diameter and two *fen* in thickness, with a hollow center.
The *Regulations* state: Jade possesses the virtue of purity and integrity, enabling covenants and resonance with the perfected—thus serving as the pledge.
When casting the *investiture dragon simpl*, it should be bound with blue-green silk and a gold clasp.
The blue-green silk substitutes for cutting hair, the gold clasp for smearing blood—reporting to the Three Officials.
The *investiture dragons’ bi*: the Heavenly Official’s is a blue-green *bi* of circular form, the Earth Official’s a yellow *bi* of square form, and the Water Official’s a black *bi* of hexagonal form.
Those who omit this will be examined by the *Earth Officials’ Nine Capitals Bureau*.

**Twenty-seven gold clasps for the three *simpl***.
The *Regulations* state: The method for casting the *simpl* requires gold clasps to accompany it.
For three *simpl*, twenty-seven clasps are used, each nine *fen* in diameter, with a circular exterior resembling the character for "punishment."
The state uses gold, while ministers and commoners may use silver, copper, or gilded metal.
The forms of the *dragon simpl*, *bi*, and clasps are detailed in the *Fasting Methods and Practices* section.

**Chapter Four: Dignified Observances**

The statutes state: The Three Supreme Honored Ones reside upon the Jade Capital Mountain of the Mysterious Metropolis, within the Purple Tenuity Upper Palace of the Seven Treasures’ Dark Terrace. The sagely perfected of the ten directions arrive thrice daily, circumambulating in reverent audience. They bear talismans and grasp registers, raise standards and hold banners. They chant the cavernous scriptures, burn incense and scatter blossoms. They present the vast music of the Celestial Lute, where phoenixes sing and simurghs dance. The myriad perfected offer felicitations, and the Three Realms rejoice as one. Today’s fasting rituals—ascending the altar to present memorials, chanting and pacing the void—are but an image of the Jade Capital of the Mysterious Metropolis. The forms of dignified observance are all herein complete.

**Standards, one pair**
Woven of five-colored silk, five tiers above and below, suspended from the pole’s apex, with a golden phoenix clutching the sash.

**Banners, one pair**
Pearl canopies and pearl nets, one octagonal tier, hung from a vermilion pole of wooden core, with a dragon on the left and a tiger on the right, both holding the sash in their jaws.

**Streamers, one pair**
Resembling the standard but lacking dragon, phoenix, or sash; three tiers, woven of five-colored silk and suspended from the pole.

**Pearl pennants, one pair**
Adorned with pearls, brocade, and jade pendants, held aloft by a golden phoenix and suspended from the pole.

**Fivefold Luminous Fans, one pair**
Carved of wood and gilded, depicting constellations above, the Five Peaks at center, and rivers and seas below, affixed to vermilion poles.

**Crane plumes, one pair**
Carved of wood to resemble crane wings, affixed to vermilion poles.

**Incense burners, tables, and mats, twenty sets**
One for the Three Treasures, ten for the ten directions, one each for the High Priest and the Precentor’s memorial table, six for the six curtains, and one incense table outside the altar. These are the requisite quantities for the fasting altar; other locations do not follow this count.

**Scripture cases and memorial tables**
The case is made of hibiscus, catalpa, or paulownia wood, twelve *cun* and eight *fen* in length, two *cun* and eight *fen* in width and depth, with three seal wells carved at the center’s top and bottom. The accompanying table, as recorded in the *Red Pine Master’s Almanac*, is two *chi* and two *cun* in length and eight *cun* in height, with curved legs, and must be made of nanmu, catalpa, or paulownia wood; deviation incurs the forfeiture of merit.

**Dragon-headed writing knife**
For amending the registers of names, cutting away evil and elevating good, removing the dead and raising the living.

Among the instruments of the fasting liturgy, this too is paramount. The blade may be six *cun* in length, its hilt shaped as a dragon. The blade is forged from ancient iron, the hilt from six *qian* of silver—essential for presenting memorials, and may not be omitted.

**Lamps and Candles**
For the circuit of the Dao, rites, and recitations, lamps and candles are indispensable. They are required not only for memorial petitions but also for exorcism and propitiation. The scriptural canons prescribe varying quantities; what matters is provision according to one’s means. One may simply follow the *Golden Register’s Abridged Text*, lighting them to illumine the heavens, sustain brightness, and dispel darkness. Below, they guide the Nine Dark Hells of the underworld; above, they shine upon the boundless halls of blessings. Among all meritorious acts, this is supreme. Some may blend fragrant oils with orchid unguents, each prepared in accordance with ritual form, thereby naturally invoking fortune.

One candle is placed in each of the ten directions, two before the Three Treasures, one before the memorial table, and others at the six curtains and other locations as one’s means allow. Lamps are lit to sustain brightness and illuminate the night; once the sun has risen, the attendant lamp-master must extinguish them according to the proper method. In this age, candles are still lit at midday—this practice must be abolished.

*Concluding the First Scroll of the* Instantiated Rites of the Supreme Yellow Register Great Fast
*Beginning the Second Scroll of the* Instantiated Rites of the Supreme Yellow Register Great Fast

The Venerable Master Chongjing of the Three Caverns, having transmitted the Light to the Celestial Enforcer of the Supreme Dao, Jiang Shuyu, compiled and arranged this section:

**Altar and Curtains (Fifth Scroll)**

The Rites decree: To venerate Heaven and Earth and commune with the perfected spirits, one must establish an altar to express utmost reverence. The ritual forms of the Three Caverns vary, each following its own method. The altar for the Yellow Register Fast of the Numinous Treasure tradition is arranged as follows:

**Inner Altar:**
Ten gates are marked with eighteen long *zhuan* (ritual markers) and ten short *zhuan*, totaling twenty-eight. They are bound with crimson or azure cords in three tiers:
1. The first tier encircles the altar from beneath the floral heads of the long *zhuan*, spanning all gates.
2. The second tier encircles beneath the floral heads of the short *zhuan*.
3. The third tier is placed approximately two *chi* from the second, aligned in height with the first tier. The second and third tiers bind only the empty spaces, not the gates.

At the heads of the long *zhuan*, cords are crossed in a tenfold pattern to suspend small banners, hanging floral branches, and the like. Beyond the ten gates, thirty-two celestial maidens (*tian shen*) are hung in their respective directional positions, thirty-two in total. Between every two *zhuan*, a lamp-*zhuan* is placed, and lamps are lit at night. The inner and outer tiered altars also bear lamp-*zhuan*, each seven *chi* in length, measured from the altar’s surface. The floral heads atop the *zhuan* are not counted in this number.

The altar has three tiers, each one *chi* and five *cun* high (or one *chi* two *cun*, or nine *cun*, as the standard). The central altar has four gates, marked with eight long *zhuan* and twenty short *zhuan*, totaling twenty-eight. The four gates are opened, while the rest are bound with crimson or azure cords. Banners and flowers alternate as in the inner altar. When ascending the altar to perform the fast and circumambulate, one may enter and exit only through the Earth Gate; the other three gates are not to be used. Those officiating at the altar—beyond the six primary roles—including any added auxiliary positions assisting in the rites, must stand in ranks beneath the lamps. In this age:
- The *qing* (ritual chime) handler and master of ceremonies correspond to the ancient role of *dujiang*.
- The announcer corresponds to the ancient *jianzhai*.
- The wine steward corresponds to the ancient *shijing*.
- The incense bearer corresponds to the ancient *shixiang*.
- The lamp attendant corresponds to the ancient *shideng*.

If the altar officers neglect their duties, redundant titles proliferate beyond the six roles.

**Outer Altar:**
Only the Li Palace gate is opened for entry and exit, marked with nine long *zhuan* and sixteen short *zhuan*, totaling twenty-five. All other areas are bound with cords. Banners, flowers, and lamp-*zhuan* alternate as above. Those maintaining ritual decorum are assigned three persons per side of each altar. During the *buxu* (circumambulation), they proceed in order, ensuring each side always has three officiants—never allowing uneven spacing.

**Altar Lamps:**
Sixteen lamps are lit outside the altar, totaling one hundred fifty-nine. The Tai Sui lamp follows the year’s cyclical sign. The Benming (natal destiny), Xingnian (current year), and major/minor ancestral tomb lamps are arranged according to the fast’s sponsor’s birth sign:
- Benming and Xingnian lamps rotate through the twelve earthly branches.
- Major and minor tomb lamps are determined by the five-phase correspondences of the sponsor’s surname.

Lamps for the ten directions, nine palaces, twenty-eight lunar lodges, and five sacred peaks are lit in their respective directions. The seven ancestral and nine underworld lamps, traditionally lit in the central courtyard, may be moved to avoid obstructing the rites: the seven ancestral lamps to the southwest, and the nine underworld lamps at the Ghost Gate.

Master Tian’s altar diagram includes lamps for the six *jia* and ten *zhi*, but these lack canonical basis. The *Golden Register* and *Simplified Writs* also omit their ritual invocations, so they are omitted here. Where altar mats are too narrow for lamps, they may be placed elsewhere.

**Lamp Arrangement (per Master Guangcheng’s intent):**
- **Dao Gate Lamps:** 2
- **Benming Lamps:** 3 (following birth year)
- **Xingnian Lamps:** 7 (men begin at *yin*, women at *shen*)
- **Tai Sui Lamp:** 1 (following the current year)
- **Major Tomb Lamps:** 3 (*gong* and *yu* at *chen*; *shang* at *chou*; *jiao* at *wei*; *zhi* at *xu*)
- **Minor Tomb Lamps:** 5 (*gong* and *yu* at *xu*; *shang* at *wei*; *jiao* at *chou*; *zhi* at *chen*)
- **Seven Ancestral Lamps:** 7 (northeast)
- **Nine Underworld Lamps:** 9 (eight directions, central lamp placed in the southwest; placards read, e.g., "Lamp of the Eastern Wind-Thunder Prison")
- **Gate-Flanking Lamps:** 2 (opposite the Dao Gate, placed at the gate’s left and right)
- **Twenty-Four Qi Lamps:** 24 (southeast)
- **Eight Trigram Lamps:** 8 (one per direction, each with a placard)
- **Nine Palace Lamps:** 9 (eight directions, central palace lamp placed under its deity’s name)
- **Ten Direction Lamps:** 10 (with placards)
- **Twenty-Eight Lunar Lodge Lamps:** 28 (evenly distributed in four directions, beginning with *Jiao* and *Zhen*; each with a placard, e.g., "*Jiao* Lodge Lamp")
- **Thirty-Six Celestial Lamps:** 36 (at the celestial gates)
- **Five Sacred Peak Lamps:** 5 (four directions, central peak placed in the southwest; each with a placard)

Beneath each lamp, a placard is placed bearing its name, such as "Dao Gate Lamp" or "*Jiao* Lodge Lamp."

**Inner Altar Ten Gates (per the *Yellow Register Simplified Writs*, *Numinous Immortals* Chapter):**
Each gate’s placard is three *cun* and three *fen* wide, two *cun* and four *fen* long, colored according to its direction:
- **East:** Azure Flower Primordial Yang Gate (red script on azure placard, *mao* position)
- **South:** Cavern Yang Supreme Radiance Gate (yellow script on red placard, *wu* position)
- **West:** Penetrating Yin Golden Portal Gate (black script on white placard, *you* position)
- **North:** Yin Birth Vast Spirit Gate (azure script on black placard, *zi* position)
- **Northeast:** Numinous Passage Forbidden Upper Gate (white script on yellow placard, *yin* position)
- **Southeast:** Primordial Yang Birth Black Gate (white script on yellow placard, *chen* position)
- **Southwest:** Primordial Yellow Lofty Dawn Gate (white script on yellow placard, *shen* position)
- **Northwest:** Nine Immortals Brahma Conduct Gate (white script on yellow placard, *xu* position)
- **Above:** Great Luo Flying Brahma Gate (azure script on white placard, *hai* position)

**Below:** Nine Numinous August Perfected Gate (yellow script on azure placard, *si* position). The ritual array of the Central Altar’s four gates differs from this.

**Heavenly Gate:** black script on yellow ground; **Earth Portal:** red script on yellow ground; **Sun Gate:** red script on vermilion ground; **Moon Gate:** white script on black ground.

**Heavenly Gate:** azure script on black placard, *hai* position.
**Earth Portal:** yellow script on red placard, *si* position.
**Sun Gate:** yellow script on azure placard, *yin* position.
**Moon Gate:** yellow script on white placard, *shen* position.

The Outer Altar’s Eight Trigrams Array opens with a single gate:
- **Zhen Palace:** Cavern Azure *qi* (azure script on yellow placard, due east *mao* position)
- **Li Palace:** Cavern Yang *qi* (vermilion script on white placard, due south *wu* position)
- **Dui Palace:** Lesser Yin *qi* (white script on azure placard, due west *you* position)
- **Kan Palace:** Cavern Yin *qi* (black script on red placard, due north *zi* position)
- **Xun Palace:** Brahma Conduct *qi* (yellow script on black placard, southeast *xun* position)
- **Kun Palace:** Brahma Yin *qi* (yellow script on black placard, southwest *kun* position)
- **Qian Palace:** Brahma Penetration *qi* (yellow script on black placard, northwest *qian* position)
- **Gen Palace:** Brahma Primordial *qi* (yellow script on black placard, northeast *gen* position)

Beyond the Eight Trigrams Array, lanterns are arranged in accordance with the ritual method, with floral pillars forming a railing. The altar array employs eighty-one *zuan* standards following the liturgical regulations of Celestial Master Wanfu, though only sixty-four are used, as the altar consists of only two tiers and the outer layer displays only the Eight Trigrams Array.

Thirty-five long *zuan* are used, each ten *zhang* in length, with nine *chi* above ground. Forty-six short *zuan* are used, each seven *chi* and six *cun* in length, with six *cun* embedded in the earth. The altar *zuan* are arranged in three tiers, meticulously carved from wood, lacquered, and painted in the form of lotus flowers and flaming pearls.

For the central gate of the upper tier, eighteen long *zuan* and ten short *zuan* are used. For the four gates of the middle tier, eight long *zuan* and sixteen short *zuan* are employed. On the outer tier, a single gate is opened at the *Li* Palace for entry and exit, using nine long *zuan* and twenty short *zuan*.

A crimson rope of five hundred *chi* is used to form a triple-railed gate, with carvings of the sun, moon, and auspicious clouds on either side. Beyond the three tiers, floral pillars are erected, each three to five *chi* in height, bound with azure ropes to demarcate purity and separate the mundane.

A single central gate is opened for entry and exit alone.

As recorded in the *Yellow Register Simplified Writs of the Lower Prime* under the *Divine Immortals* section: for the ritual of deliverance from karmic roots, an altar is to be established in the central courtyard. Ten gates—four cardinal directions, four corners, above, and below—are to be arranged. The central space measures two *zhang* and four *chi* in length and breadth, with *zuan* standards marking the gates on all sides, their placards inscribed with the positions of the gates, meticulously ordered above and below.

It further states: once the central gate is installed, beyond the ten gates, open the Heavenly Gate and Earthly Portal, the Sun Gate and Moon Gate at the four corners, together forming four gates. Their combined length and breadth shall measure three *zhang* and two *chi*, named the Fourfold Boundary Grand Gates. The *Banner of the Eight Trigrams* scripture mentions only two tiers, embodying the principle of "modeling Heaven and emulating Earth." However, following the ritual protocols of Master Guangcheng, the altar is constructed with three tiers. Should the terrain be too narrow to adhere strictly to the regulations, only the upper and middle tiers may be erected. The outer tier may be built on level ground, allowing for flexibility rather than rigid adherence. The outer tier may be as narrow as two *chi*, but the middle tier, where prostrations and kneeling occur, must not be too cramped. If the upper tier measures two *zhang* and four *chi*, the middle tier should be three *zhang* and two *chi*. If the upper tier is one *zhang* and eight *chi*, the middle tier should be two *zhang* and four *chi*.

Master Du Guangcheng observes: common perception deems an open-air altar most fitting. Yet those unaware fail to grasp that where sincerity moves, the Nine Heavens are not distant; where intent is obstructed, even a half-step becomes a barrier. If the cinnabar heart stirs the true sages and devotion aligns with the divine, how can mere roof and walls obscure it? Moreover, after the altar’s consecration, one must not walk counterclockwise within it, nor allow outsiders to trespass, offend the true, or violate prohibitions—penalties for such are severe. Weather is unpredictable, and clear skies seldom endure. Should rain suddenly fall during a memorial or petition, the stately order of ritual would be disrupted, giving way to haste and disorder. With the sequence thus disordered, reverence is wholly lost. The Confucians, too, refrain from sacrifice when robes are damp or dignity compromised, precisely to avoid such lapses. By this reasoning, an altar sheltered beneath a roof ensures that all movements from beginning to end remain dignified, naturally fostering resonance with the divine.

When erecting the altar, the cardinal directions must be precisely aligned, facing south with the back to the north. If the orientation of temple halls or buildings conflicts with this, the altar’s position should be determined by the true north, south, east, and west, regardless of whether it stands directly opposite or at an angle. Adjustments may be made to accommodate the altar’s proper orientation within the structure.

The **Mystic Master’s Tent** is situated to the east of the altar, one position south of it. The Mystic Master of the Numinous Treasure, as the transformer under the Three Heavens, is the preceptor of the revealed teachings. When conducting ritual affairs, one must first submit petitions and secure divine witness to the merits of the fast. A tent is pitched, and sacred images and tables are arranged, with offerings made according to protocol.

The **Five Emperors’ Tent** is situated to the west of the altar, one position south of it. The Five Venerable Lords of the Five Directions oversee the records of merit and transgression in Heaven, bearing witness to the fast’s efficacy. In ancient fasts, their altars were placed upon the five directional tables. According to Master Du’s protocols, a separate tent is pitched north of the Three Masters’ position, with sacred images and tables arranged and offerings made as prescribed.

The **Celestial Master’s Tent** is situated two positions east of the Mystic Master’s Tent, to its south. The Orthodox Unity Celestial Master, as the master of the Three Heavens’ dharma, is the preceptor who transmits the teachings. For all fasts and rites, petitions must be submitted. A tent is pitched, with sacred images and tables arranged and offerings made according to protocol. Master Du’s protocols do not include this tent.

The **Three Masters’ Tent** is situated three positions west of the Five Emperors’ Tent, to its south. The Three Masters of the Scriptures and Ordinances, as the founding preceptors of deliverance and the foremost in sustaining mindfulness, each have tents pitched to the west of the altar, with sacred images and tables arranged and offerings made as prescribed.

The **Three Officials’ Tent** is situated three positions east of the Celestial Master’s Tent, to its south. The Three Officials Great Emperors oversee the records of the Three Primes’ examinations, bearing witness to the fast’s merits. A tent is pitched, with sacred images and tables arranged and offerings made according to protocol.

The **Overseer Dharma Master’s Tent** is situated three positions west of the Three Masters’ Tent, to its south. The Great Dharma Master Overseer of the Fast presides over the Numinous Treasure fasts. A tent is pitched to oversee the ritual, with sacred images and tables arranged and offerings made as prescribed.

These six tents are arranged in sequence around the altar. Their placement should accommodate the available space, with flexible arrangements as needed. The Three Masters’ position is established within the altar, while the Orthodox Unity Three Masters’ tent is added separately. Since the transmission of teachings at Dragon-Tiger Mountain, this practice has been followed. Now, in accordance with Master Du’s protocols, the Three Masters’ tent is placed to the west of the altar. If the space is too narrow to erect all six tents, one tent may be set up on each of the east and west sides. Each tent should have three incense and flower tables, with curtains or screens used to partition the space. During visits and ceremonies, the central path must remain unobstructed.

For the eastern tent, the Mystic Master should be positioned in the center, the Celestial Master to the left, and the Three Officials to the right. For the western tent, the Five Emperors should be in the center, the Three Masters to the left, and the Overseer to the right. When three tents are combined into one, the central position is reserved for the most revered, with the others arranged to the left and right accordingly.

The **Refinement and Deliverance Hall** arranges the positions of the Perfected and Immortals of the Refining and Deliverance Emperors. Here, the souls of the departed are refined and the obscured are elevated. Sacred images and tables are arranged, with offerings made according to protocol. In narrow spaces, it may be set up temporarily on the evening of the refinement ritual.

The **Divine Tiger Hall** arranges the positions of the Divine Tiger Lady and her generals and officers. Tents and offerings are arranged as prescribed. This hall is always kept curtained, with no outsiders permitted to enter or exit.

The **Overseer’s Station** arranges the positions of the City Gods, Earth Gods, Altar-Monitoring Deities, and attending spirits. It is located to the west of the altar. Master Du’s protocols state that for petitions and proclamations, the transmission of resonance to the Upper Mysteries, and the establishment of fast altars, the Earth God is paramount. Their position should be set up opposite the altar’s front, with incense, flowers, and tables arranged, and offerings made as prescribed.

The **Hall of Reception and Deliverance**, according to Master Du Guangcheng’s protocols, is situated to the southeast. Here, the Nine Dark Realms are traversed, and the distant ancestors are cleansed. A position should be set up opposite the altar, arranging the places for the souls of the departed. Offerings of food and drink are made as prescribed.

The **Hall of Silent Repose** features a high seat at its center, with the Great Dharma Master’s seat and the seats of the assembled officials arranged on either side. The positions of the ancestral masters of the fast’s dharma are arrayed in the center. Offerings are made according to protocol.

The **Chamber of Serenity** is where the High Merit Dharma Master performs rituals, writes talismans, and prepares registers.

In the center, arrange the positions of the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign, the True Lords of the Yellow Register Abbey, the Register Spirits of the Central Canon, and the Talismanic Register Divine Officials. Offerings are made as prescribed.

The **Hall of Universal Deliverance** features an outer enclosure shaped like a water chestnut, with a measure of food placed within. The six paths of rebirth are established, and offerings of food and drink are made as prescribed. It is especially auspicious to situate this near water.

The **Hall of Scriptural Recitation** has the positions of the Three Clarities and Three Treasures set at its center. Offerings of incense and flowers are made as prescribed. Once the hall is opened, the Daoist assembly gathers here. After the recitation is complete, memorials are presented and repentance rites performed.

**Section Six: Inviting the Master**
This section states: To deliver heaven and humanity, to rescue and protect all beings—none may be delivered without a master, none may ascend to immortality without a master. Moreover, when establishing a fast to seek blessings and deliver the living and the dead, one must secure the right person to ensure efficacy. Such a master must have received the registers and talismans, be well-versed in the protocols of fasts, understand the rites of reverence and withdrawal, and grasp the standards of advancement and retreat. In contemplating the divine and invoking the Perfected, it should be as if standing before the Golden Gates; in presenting memorials and petitions, it should be as if personally attending the Jade Emperor. Their conduct should be measured and graceful, without flaw. With single-minded devotion and utmost sincerity, their power resonates with the divine—only then may they be called a master.

If a Dharma Master bears the Three Caverns or if the assembled officials are versed in the Cavern Mystery, they may be so attired. Where qualified individuals are lacking, a Cavern Mystery Dharma Master may serve as the master, while a Purple Void Orthodox Unity master may serve as an official. Since the protocols of fasts derive from the Numinous Treasure tradition, which belongs to the Cavern Mystery, this arrangement is fitting in principle.

Those who have only received the Ten Precepts or are mere White-Simplex Daoists may not assume roles or ascend the altar. Those who usurp titles and ranks without authority will incur karmic retribution.

The assembled officials of the fast must be of one mind and purpose in establishing its merit. If even one harbors dissent, harmony is disrupted, and the merit of the fast is undermined. For the August Heaven and Vast Earth, the Dark Bureau and Yellow Springs, the boundless realms of the ten directions, and the immeasurable bounds of the three realms—without a perfected master to compose petitions, present memorials, and follow the prescribed forms, how can heaven and humanity be harmonized, and blessings be bestowed upon the hidden and the manifest?

As for those of shallow learning and inferior attainment—those who drift without deep cultivation of the Dao or familiarity with the protocols of fasts, who pursue only material gain and recklessly conduct rituals—they not only waste their energy and squander resources but also, due to their incomplete mastery of the rites of reverence and withdrawal, risk violating the statutes of the Celestial Perfected in their conduct. Blundering in darkness, they hasten their own divine judgment, and the patron of the fast will not escape the burden of their transgressions.

While those who participate in concluding the fast need not be few, true virtue is rare, and those who are reverent and diligent are scarce. Generally, a group of seven to fourteen is appropriate. Where qualified individuals are lacking—those who bear the true writs of the highest Dharma—one should not indiscriminately extend invitations or fill ranks with unworthy names.

In this age, the Daoist teachings have declined, and practitioners follow one another in superficial habits. Those who receive registers merely visit ancestral altars to request register petitions and Dharma robes as credentials, then grandly style themselves as disciples of such-and-such a register, adorned in fine attire, presenting a semblance of dignity. There is no greater deception of the Dao than this—it is a grievous matter indeed. Even if they are not permitted to ascend the altar, those who serve in palace or temple roles must at least have received the Register of Merit Completion and Alliance威, before they may be so attired.

**Section Seven: The Ranks and Vestments of the Assembled Officials**
This section states: Vestments serve to distinguish ritual propriety. When ascending the altar to attend the Perfected, order must not be disrupted. The scriptures and registers define the ranks, and their proper use clarifies hierarchy according to Dharma protocol. Beginning with Orthodox Unity and culminating with the Preceptor, the distinctions of high and low follow established regulations.

**Orthodox Unity Dharma Master**
Wears a dark cap, crimson-brown robe, yellow skirt, and crimson sash. Twenty-four strands of cinnabar-red jade pendants. A demon-subduing sword, two feet and four inches in length.

**Purple Void Dharma Master**
Wears a dark cap, yellow skirt, yellow-brown robe, and yellow sash. Twenty-eight strands of azure jade pendants. A Purple Void Yang-Light sword, two feet and eight inches in length. Also wields the Five Emperors’ Spirit-Summoning sword and luminous jade pendants.

**Cavern Spirit Dharma Master**
Wears a dark cap, yellow skirt, azure-brown robe, and yellow sash. Thirty-two strands of white jade pendants. A Great One Three Primordials sword, three feet in length. Also wields the Three Sovereigns Great One sword and azure jade pendants.

**Cavern Mystery Dharma Master**
Wears a hibiscus crown, yellow skirt, purple-brown robe, and purple sash. Thirty-two strands of luminous jade pendants. An Eight Effulgences Spirit-Wielding sword, three feet and six inches in length. Also wields the Five Emperors’ Spirit-Subduing Demon-Repelling sword and plain jade pendants.

**Cavern Perfection Dharma Master**
Wears a Primordial Beginning crown, azure skirt, purple-brown robe, and purple sash. A robe lined with thirty-nine strands of azure, with embroidered pearl-and-jade slippers. Seated upon a Thunder-Spirit throne, holding a jade tablet and a Thunder-Spirit sword. Jade pendants and pearl ornaments hang on either side. Before and behind, talismans for summoning the Perfected and spirits. Alternatively, may wear a cloud-and-mist Daoist robe.

**Great Cavern Dharma Master**
Wears a Primordial Beginning crown, yellow skirt, purple-brown robe, and a five-colored cloud-and-mist sash. Sword and pendants as for the Cavern Perfection Dharma Master.

**Three Caverns Preceptor**
Wears a Primordial Beginning crown, yellow skirt, purple-brown robe, and a nine-colored cloud-and-mist sash. No sword or pendants.

The above ranks, from high to low, comprise the vestments for attending the Perfected when ascending the altar to commune with the divine.

As the *Treasure Sea* states: The sword repels evil, restrains wrongdoing, and subdues demons with its numinous power. Pendants regulate movement and stillness, inner and outer, each according to its rank.

The Celestial Perfected and Upper Saints possess Dharma forms and majestic deportment. Their myriad manifestations and thousandfold names are boundless in transformation. As for their towering terraces and palaces—formed of congealed qi and condensed clouds—they flicker between presence and absence, never fixed in place. Some are flying terraces and traveling abodes, shifting within the void. Others are golden gates and jade towers, manifesting from emptiness. Some encompass the cosmos; others enter the finest hair. Their feathered robes and cloud garments, rosy-hued sashes and jade pendants, pearl banners and treasure staffs, flying seals and gem-studded crowns, jade tablets and rainbow banners, phoenix chariots and dragon carriages, sun flags and moon pennants, crane-drawn and simurgh-harnessed vehicles—though born of transformative power, they nonetheless follow hierarchical order.

Thus, the ritual vestments for audience with the Perfected—sword and sash, cap and robe—take their model from the Most High Perfected, extending their dignity to instruct those below. When one fasts in purity and sits in silent reverence, when the mind is concentrated in the still chamber, when qi is harmonized with the Void and the heart roams in tranquil vastness, when one secretly attends the Great Emperor and silently knocks at the Mysterious Gate—there is no need for distinctions in attire, for the essentials of spiritual resonance are naturally met. All ranks and gradations dissolve into oneness. Yet when establishing teaching models or defining ritual forms, each must follow its proper sequence. This may serve as a regular standard for practice, a sublime excellence of the Mysterious Gate. Those who propagate the Dao should take heed.

**Section Eight: Fasting and Offerings**
In preparing the fast, meals should be timely, with cakes, fruits, and vegetables. All must be pure and arranged according to ritual. Let neither children nor animals defile them. Butter, milk, and cheese are not to enter the fasting kitchen. After the fast, only tea and broth may be taken, to harmonize qi.

On the day of the main fast, offerings are made before the Three Treasures, the supervising Dharma Master, and the overseeing altar deities. A modest display suffices to express sincerity, not abundance. Before the Three Treasures, the ten directions, and all altars, seasonal fruits are prepared as offerings, along with fine tea and jujube broth. Offerings to the Three Treasures, the thirty directions, the sixteen altars, and the fourteen supervising deities should be made according to one’s means. After the morning incense lighting, tea is served. At the great thanksgiving, broth is offered. When the altars are visited, tea and broth are presented accordingly.

**Section Nine: Bathing**
When entering the fast and settling into stillness, purity comes first. Within, the Dharma-water washes the heart; without, the fragrant basin cleanses the body. When the mind is still, worldly thoughts naturally cease; when filth is removed, true qi flows freely. Those who study the Dao should always calm the mind, compose the thoughts, bathe, and burn incense. This can open the way to communion with the divine and evoke the descent of the Crimson Perfected.

Before each fast, one should boil water infused with five fragrant herbs for bathing: *qingmu*, *jingjie*, *lingling*, orchid, and true sandalwood. Where these five are unavailable, one may follow the method of the Purple Void Primordial Sovereign for bathing and dispelling impurity: boil ten ounces of bamboo leaves and ten ounces of peach bark in two *dou* of water until it reaches a single boil. Drink one cup at a suitable temperature, then bathe—all impurities will disperse.

Whenever entering the oratory to burn incense, rinse the mouth with water to dispel impurity. Do the same upon leaving, to seal the true qi.

**Section Ten: Auspicious Days**
For grand fasts, choose an opening day at a seasonal juncture. The day before the fast begins and the first day of the main fast are ideal, especially if they fall on a *gen* day. Even on auspicious days, avoid *bingyin*, *dingmao*, *bingshen*, *dingyou*, *wuchen*, *wuxu*, days of receiving death, and the paired Dragon and Tiger days—unless they coincide with the Three Assemblies.

If the fast begins on a favorable day but later sessions fall on days to be avoided, no taboo need be observed. However, submitting memorials is forbidden on the six *wu* days, for the Heavenly Gate is closed.

When dispatching documents, avoid days marked by "blocked roads" or "empty death," and favor times governed by *Daji*, *Xiaoji*, *Chuansong*, or *Gongcao*.

In memorials, it is written: “submitted to this minister.” In petitions, it is written: “submitted to so-and-so.” In official notes, it is written: “filed under this court.” The rest remains the same.

From the native place of [Route], [Prefecture], [County], the petitioner [Official Title and Full Name] respectfully states: For the sake of the deceased parent [Name], born on the [Day] of the [Month] in the [Year] of the [Sexagenary Cycle], who passed away at [Location] on the [Day] of the [Month] in the [Year] due to illness, having lived [Number] years.

Upon its completion, the rites of dispersal shall be conducted, with a thanksgiving purification jiao encompassing the three hundred and sixty divine stations.

Gathering this extraordinary cause, may it ascend to benefit the state and the household, bring harmony and peace to all beings, and bestow blessings upon the living.

From [Residence] in [Prefecture], [Subprefecture], [County], desiring to serve as the convener of the Unsurpassed Yellow Register Grand Fast, [Official Title] [Name], together with fellow participants—be they officials, scholars, commoners, men, or women (if currently serving officials join, they shall be listed as "officials, scholars, or commoners")—hereby submit:

Desiring to express my sincerest grief, I wish to rely upon the power of this solemn offering. Moreover, for the sake of all ancestral kin, whose karmic transgressions from past lives remain unexpiated, I have heard that the Unsurpassed Yellow Register Grand Fast surpasses all other rituals in merit and extends its grace to the ten directions. Together, we pledge our devotion and jointly undertake this offering.

Respectfully presenting the fast’s ritual offerings and the ceremonial requisites for the jiao, I submit them to the Numinous Treasure Grand Ritual Bureau, beseeching that at [Location]’s abbey or temple, an Unsurpassed Yellow Register Grand Fast be established for three days and nights. Upon its completion, the rites of dispersal shall be conducted, with a thanksgiving purification jiao encompassing the three hundred and sixty divine stations.

By the power of this fast, may it ascend to benefit the state and the household, bring harmony and peace to all beings, and bestow blessings upon the living.

Through the power of the Dao, may the light of grace reach them in due time, allowing them to approach the altar’s steps, repent their sins, and receive the merit of this fast.

May the Dao’s compassion deign to issue a sacred decree, promulgating it throughout the Three Realms and Ten Directions, granting Your Servant’s petition. In fear of offending the celestial majesty, Your Servant prostrates in awe and dread, kowtowing repeatedly, acknowledging the gravity of this transgression.

*Submitted to the Heavenly Pivot Bureau*
*By the Bureau of Numinous Treasure Great Dharma*

Now according to the petition submitted by [Name] of [Place], stating the intent to sponsor this fast for the blessing of the living, this Bureau, in reverent adherence to the mysterious statutes, has conducted the ritual fast. A memorial has been dispatched to the Supreme Emperor, and an alliance has been sworn with the true offices of the Three Realms, with documents sent to all relevant jurisdictions. It is now respectfully requested that a sagely decree be issued and proclaimed to the nether prisons and all associated domains, that all may be informed of the establishment of this grand fast.

For the deceased [Name], the souls of all those commemorated in this assembly, the ancestors of the fast’s sponsors across ten thousand generations, and all karmic relations through countless kalpas—along with the suffering souls and lingering spirits of the Nine Nether Realms—may the trials of judgment be temporarily suspended, and the roots of evil be eradicated. On the day of the fast’s establishment, may their transgressions be absolved, their grievances released, and may they personally approach the altar to reverently receive the talismanic mandate, thereby attaining deliverance and rebirth.

Five memorials have now been prepared, sealed in full, and respectfully submitted for the following recipients:

For the deceased [X], the souls commemorated in this assembly, and the ancestors across ten thousand generations of the fast’s sponsors, along with all karmic relations through countless kalpas—together with the suffering souls and sin-laden spirits of the **Ten Directions and Nine Nether Realms**—may the trials of judgment be temporarily suspended, and the roots of evil be eradicated. May they borrow the power of the Dao, and when the time of grace arrives, personally approach the altar’s steps to repent and expiate their transgressions, reverently receiving the fast’s merit.

Desiring that the **Three Realms and Ten Directions** be forewarned of the observance, it is respectfully submitted for Your august perusal.

The undersigned [X] respectfully submits this memorial to the **Holy Master of the Mysterious Teachings of the Upper Clarity, Sacred Preceptor of the Numinous Treasure, Perfected Sovereign of the Three Heavens**; the **Great Dharma Master of the Three Heavens, Orthodox Unity, Tranquil Response, Perfected Sovereign**; the **Perfected Sovereign, Scriptural Master of the Numinous Treasure**; the **Perfected Sovereign, Register Master of the Numinous Treasure**; and the **Perfected Sovereign, Deliverance Master of the Numinous Treasure**, before Your sacred thrones.

**Memorial to the Earth Office**
The **Great City God of All Under Heaven** is hereby addressed.

The **Bureau of Numinous Treasure and Great Dharma** petitions the **Great City God of All Under Heaven**.

This Bureau now submits that, according to the petition from such-and-such village and prefecture, the intent of the fast is for blessings and protection of the living. As the Bureau cannot refuse this plea, it has reverently assembled a ritual altar of Daoist masters, establishing a numinous altar in accordance with the **Yellow Register** of the **Lower Yuan**, and the **Ranks of the Divine Immortals**, forming an alliance and taking oaths.

With reverence, the precious fast is undertaken, first raising the sacred banner. The intent of the fast is proclaimed, and the **True Scriptures of the Most High** are recited by title. An auspicious day is chosen to open the ritual altar.

Following the **Mysterious Regulations**, the secret rituals are proclaimed. Humbly, we beseech Your grace to universally deliver the living and the dead.

Apart from the matters herein, a memorial shall be swiftly submitted to the **Celestial Emperor**, imploring an imperial edict, and to the **Venerable Heavenly Emperors**, requesting their sacred decrees. These shall be transmitted to the **True Offices of the Three Realms** and all relevant jurisdictions.

Each is respectfully entreated to take note and honor the rites of the great fast. For the deceased so-and-so, the souls to be delivered in this assembly, and the family of the fast’s sponsor—countless ancestors across kalpas, all kin through past lives—along with the suffering souls and sinful spirits of the **Ten Directions and Nine Netherworlds**, may the examinations be temporarily suspended, and the roots of evil extinguished.

By the power of the Dao, may the light of grace arrive in time. May they approach the altar and throne, repent and cleanse their sins, and humbly receive the merit of the fast. Desiring that all relevant jurisdictions be forewarned of the rites to be performed, it is necessary to issue this special memorial.

Upon receipt of this memorial, the aforementioned matters are to be carefully considered. Swiftly issue commands, transmitting documents to the **Community Deities of Ji, Yun, Qing, Xu, Yang, Jing, Yu, Liang, and Yong Provinces**, as well as to the **City Gods of all prefectures, subprefectures, counties, and towns**, ensuring mutual notification and universal awareness of the great fast to be performed. Urgently investigate and gather all long-imprisoned souls in the dark yin realms, those without means of deliverance, wandering spirits, and those bound by grievances and enmity under your jurisdiction.

Each is to be examined in advance, assembled, and exhorted to abandon evil affinities and cultivate good thoughts. They shall await the day of the fast’s establishment, at which time a further memorial shall be issued to command their dispatch to the altar. There, they shall refine their forms and spirits, attend the court of the **Most High**, hear the scriptures and receive the Dharma, resolve burdens and dissolve enmity, partake of the fast’s offerings, and humbly receive its merit. May all universally attain deliverance and together achieve transcendence.

Above, this accords with the compassion of the **Great Dao**; below, it manifests the vastness of the fast’s merit. This memorial requests compliance and implementation.

Respectfully submitted.
In the year of [X] under the cyclical sign [X], on the [X] day of the [X] month, this memorial is submitted.

Upon receipt, the aforementioned matters are to be carefully considered. Swiftly issue commands, transmitting documents to the **City Gods of all counties** and the **Community Deities of villages, towns, and hamlets** under your jurisdiction. All relevant places of incense and fire are to be notified of the great fast to be performed.

At the appointed time, release the wandering spirits and stagnant souls to come and partake of the fast’s offerings, humbly receiving its merit. Furthermore, notify all temples and shrines, and their presiding deities.

Each is to assemble their divine soldiers in advance, awaiting the establishment of the fast. They shall arrive in advance to guard the numinous altar, sweep away defilements, and prohibit the consumption of meat and pungent foods. Restrain the wandering spirits and stagnant souls, preventing them from harboring vengeful thoughts or secretly harming lives.

When the altar is opened, invite them to serve as overseers, awaiting the descent of the sacred chariot and the arrival of the true immortals. Upon the completion of the fast, report their merits and recommend promotions.

This memorial requests compliance and implementation.

Respectfully submitted.
The memorial to the **County City God** follows the same format as that to the **Provincial City God**, with the folded-corner seal, front and reverse sides following the same style, and the divine titles adjusted accordingly.

**Section on Memorials to the Throne**

To the August Jade Purity, the Most High Lord of the Primordial Beginning, from your subordinate of the Three Clarities, [Name], of such-and-such native place:

Whereas, in accordance with the petition of the sponsor [Name] of such-and-such village and domicile, whose intent in establishing this fast is to seek blessings and protection for the living, and whereas your subordinate, finding the plea impossible to refuse, did on the [Day] of the [Month] issue a preliminary announcement, first raising the sacred banner to make known the intent of the fast—

Now, in accordance with the ranks of the transcendent spirits as set forth in the *Yellow Register Writs of the Lower Prime*, a numinous altar has been erected and the fast rites solemnly performed. Reverently following the prescribed order, the true scriptures are proclaimed and expounded. The memorials to the Celestial Officials for the deliverance of all souls are presented; the primordial talismanic decrees of the Most High, the *Golden Register* and *White Writs*, the *True Talismans for Salvation from Suffering*, the *Most High’s Edict of Absolution and Register for Ascension to Heaven*, the *Jade Purity’s True Talismans for Deliverance of Shades from Darkness and Breaking Open Hell*, the *Nine-Dragon Decrees of the Azure Palace*, and the *Jade Tablets of the Divine Tiger* are issued.

Thereby, the deceased [Name], the souls of all those assembled for deliverance, and the suffering shades of the Ten Directions and Nine Netherworlds—bound prisoners of the long night—are to receive the merit of this fast. On the [Day] of the [Month], the fast altar shall be opened, and the departed souls summoned to attend and receive deliverance. Beginning at dawn on the [Day], the proper fast and Daoist rites shall proceed for three days and nine audiences. On the night of the [Day], a pure and unimpeded *hushi* feast shall be universally offered, and the night fast and alchemical deliverance performed for the six destinies, the four modes of birth, and the lonely, lingering souls.

On the night of the [Day], the transformation through water and fire shall be enacted for the souls of the sponsored deceased. The *Nine Wondrous Precepts of the Perfected* shall be transmitted, and the primordial talismanic decrees proclaimed. The *Golden Register* and *White Writs*, the *Talismans of Eternal Life*, and the *Registers for Breaking the Bonds* shall be conferred to ensure promotion and transcendence.

Upon completion of the rites, a memorial shall be presented to report the merit accrued, and the altar shall be dismantled. On the night of the [Day], a grand offering shall be made to the lofty perfected of the Three Realms, a pure *jiao* rite for the three hundred and sixty divine ranks, in reverent gratitude for the vast grace received, with the presentation of dragon tablets and writs.

In addition to the foregoing, a full account of the proceedings shall be prepared and submitted to the August Celestial Worthies of the Myriad Heavens, beseeching the issuance of their sagely decree. The Three Realms’ true bureaus shall be notified, and documents dispatched to all relevant offices. The names of the sponsored deceased, along with their dates of birth and death, shall be separately recorded in a register and submitted to the *Upper Clarity Celestial Pivot Institute* under the Three Celestial Gates, there to await the saving decree and its subsequent promulgation.

Your subordinate further humbly considers that all the sponsored souls, bound as they are by the grime of past karmic transgressions and eternally confined to the dark paths, cannot be delivered without the grace of Heaven. Only through the primordial talismanic decrees, the sacred registers, and the true talismans can this lineage be opened and delivered. The secret writs and numinous scripts, along with the supervising officials of the fast altar and the divine attendants of the *Numinous Treasure*, who proclaim and transmit the summons, as well as the various officers and generals of the relevant bureaus—all those who ought to be invoked and descended—shall be duly summoned and dispatched in accordance with the prescribed forms. It is thus necessary to memorialize this matter.

Accordingly, your subordinate respectfully submits this register and memorial to the August Jade Purity, the Most High Lord of the Primordial Beginning. May the Dao’s compassion grant your subordinate’s plea and issue the talismanic decrees for your subordinate to receive and enact. May a special sagely decree be bestowed, universally proclaimed to the myriad heavens, the palaces of the sun, moon, and stars, the jade pivots and celestial balances, the Four Offices and Five Emperors, the Controllers of Destiny and Recorders of Deeds, the Lord of Records at the Southern Palace of Nanchang, all earth and water deities, the sacred mountains of the Five Peaks, the Three Officials and Nine Bureaus, the Twelve River Sources, the courts of the long night, the depths of the Nine Netherworlds, the boundless worlds, and all divine spirits. May each be commanded to respond accordingly, delivering the deceased [Name], the souls of all those assembled for deliverance, and the households of the fast’s disciples—ancestors of a hundred thousand generations, karmic kin across kalpas, the suffering souls and sinful shades of the Ten Directions and Nine Netherworlds. May all deep transgressions, heavy faults, and ancient enmities be renewed and pardoned. May they emerge from the dark night and come before the fast altar, bathing body and spirit, attending the Perfected, and hearing the Dharma. May they repent of their karmic transgressions, undergo alchemical refinement, and be reborn.

Moreover, may the lords of the Northern and Southern Palaces, the rulers of yang essence and yin spirits, the divine kings of the Ten Directions, the numinous officials and jade maidens, the offices of the memorials, the couriers of the *Mysterious Capital*’s dragons, the messengers who inspect decrees, the protective Dharma deities, the dragon and tiger riders, the Three Prime Generals, the guardians of the fast altar, the divine attendants of the *Numinous Treasure*, the alchemical officials of Nanchang, and the generals and officers who pursue and summon souls—may all be commanded to know their duties, respond to your subordinate’s summons, manifest their forms, and descend in their qi to visibly assist in the rites. May demonic obstacles not arise, and may the fast’s merit be accomplished. May the deceased transcend and transform, and may the living enjoy peace and prosperity. May the state and the household receive grace, and may the dark and the bright realms alike be blessed.

On the day the fast is established, may the Three Luminaries shine brightly, and may the Four Qi be harmonious. May grace and light be bestowed from above to witness and affirm the rites. Having presumptuously offended the Celestial Might, your subordinate is filled with awe and trepidation, bowing his head to the ground in reverence. With dread and humility, he submits this memorial for your august consideration.

Respectfully submitted.
In the cyclical year [Year], the [Month] and [Day], your subordinate of the ritual rank [Name] submits this memorial.

**Attached Note:**
Memorial submitted on behalf of [Name], who humbly seeks to establish the *Supreme Yellow Register Grand Fast* to deliver the deceased [Name] and universally deliver the assembled souls and the suffering, sinful shades of the Ten Directions and Nine Netherworlds. Now, talismanic decrees are to be issued, and officials and generals requested to descend. The souls are to be summoned to the altar and delivered in accordance with the scriptures. A saving decree is sought, to be issued throughout the Three Realms and Ten Directions.

**Endorsement:**
Requesting the issuance of decrees to the true bureaus of the Three Realms for implementation. To be sealed and dispatched as per the *Preliminary Announcement Section*. **Upper Clarity.**

The Most High Sovereign of Supreme Clarity, the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy; the Grand Supreme, the Supreme Sovereign of the Great Dao and Its Virtue—these two petitions shall each be presented separately. Together with the petition to the Jade Clarity, their opening and closing formulae shall be identical.

To the August Heaven:
[Name], of such-and-such a ritual rank and surname, first on behalf of such-and-such a native place, in accordance with the three petitions to the Three Clarities, having performed the *Investiture of the Dragon* and *Presentation of the Simplified Memorial*, sets forth the matters in full and memorializes the Supreme Emperor, humbly seeking the issuance of a saving decree. He further memorializes the Heavenly Emperor Worthies, requesting the descent of their sagacious edicts to instruct the true bureaus of the Three Realms and dispatch documents to all relevant jurisdictions. The remainder shall follow the three petitions to the Three Clarities, up to the point of submission.

Your servant respectfully records the memorial and submits it to His Celestial Majesty, the Most High Jade Emperor of August Heaven, Who Upholds the Dao, Wields the Talisman, Governs the Calendar, Embodies the True, and Encompasses the Real—reverently beseeching the Dao’s compassion to grant, in accordance with the three petitions to the Three Clarities, blessings upon the hidden and the manifest, though this risks offending the Celestial Might. Your servant, with awe and trepidation, prostrates and knocks his head to the ground, guilty of death. Respectfully he presents this memorial for Your Majesty’s attention.

Respectfully submitted.

The *Attached Note* and *Endorsement* shall be identical to those of the three petitions to the Three Clarities.

To the Heavenly Sovereign:
[Name], of such-and-such a ritual rank and surname.

Previously, from such-and-such a village and native place, in accordance with the three petitions to the Three Clarities, the matter of casting the dragon tablet and presenting the written prayer was fully set forth and submitted to the Celestial Majesty, beseeching the issuance of an imperial decree. Memorials were also presented to the August Heavenly Thearchs, entreating the bestowal of sagacious edicts to be transmitted to the true bureaus of the Three Realms, and dispatched to their respective jurisdictions. The names, dates of birth and death of the deceased souls thus recommended shall be separately recorded in a register and submitted to the Heavenly Pivot Institute of the Upper Clarity beneath the Three Celestial Gates, there to await the promulgation of the imperial decree.

Your servant remains concerned that the recommended deceased souls, along with the bound and imprisoned transgressors of the Ten Directions and Nine Dark Realms—those long fettered by karmic defilements and eternally confined to the hidden paths—cannot be delivered and uplifted without the grace of luminous compassion. Furthermore, the talismanic decrees for universal deliverance, along with the officials of the Northern and Southern Palaces and their subordinate officers, require issuance and enforcement in accordance with ritual protocol. This matter must be submitted for imperial attention.

Your servant respectfully records this memorial and presents it to His Celestial Majesty, the Great Thearch of the Gouchen Star Palace, reverently beseeching the Heavenly Compassion to grant his petition and issue a sagacious edict to the Three Realms, Ten Directions, Nine Dark Yin Realms, and all bureaus of the netherworld and hidden prisons. May all jurisdictions be commanded to take heed and grant absolution, delivering and uplifting the deceased named so-and-so, the souls recommended in this assembly, and the ancestors of the Dharma-disciples who established this fast—extending to their myriad forebears across kalpas and all karmic relations. May the suffering souls and sin-laden spirits of the Ten Directions and Nine Dark Realms have their transgressions expunged from the registers and their evil roots eradicated, enabling them to approach the fast’s altar, receive universal deliverance, attend the true assembly to hear the Dharma, and undergo refinement for rebirth.

Furthermore, may the edict be issued to the Northern and Southern Palaces, the yang essence and yin spirits, the lords of the Water and Fire Bureaus, the guardian officials of the altar’s numinous treasure, the Lords of the Southern Florescence Refinement Bureau, the divine tiger marshals and summoning officers—all to be duly informed and respond to your servant’s invocation. May they manifest in multifarious forms, descend with their qi, and visibly assist in the ritual’s execution, ensuring that demonic obstacles do not arise and the fast’s merit is perfected. May the deceased ancestors transcend their states, the living attain benefit and peace, the state and household receive grace, and the hidden and manifest realms be blessed. This risks offending the Celestial Might; your servant, with awe and trepidation, follows the format of the three petitions to the Three Clarities and respectfully concludes this memorial.

The *Attached Note* shall be identical to that of the three petitions to the Three Clarities. The ritual of universal deliverance shall proceed in accordance with the established protocols, beseeching the issuance of a sagacious edict to be promulgated throughout the Three Realms and Ten Directions. The *Endorsement* shall be identical to that of the Three Clarities, the Earth Deity, the Thirty-Two Heavens, the Lord of Wood, the Queen Mother of Metal, and all other memorials. The opening and closing of this memorial to the Northern Culmen shall be identical to that of the memorial to the Heavenly Thearch.

To the Great Thearch of the Northern Culmen of the Central Heavenly Purple Tenuity:
To the Earth Deity:
[Name], of such-and-such a ritual rank and surname.

Now, in accordance with the memorial from such-and-such a locale, identical to that of the Heavenly Thearch, awaiting the promulgation of the sagacious edict, with additional matters requiring submission for imperial consideration:

This memorial is respectfully recorded and presented to the August Presence beneath the Earth Deity, the August and Vast Earth Spirit who upholds the Dao, embodies profound virtue, and radiates great luminosity. Humbly beseeching the imperial benevolence to grant this petition, may a sagacious edict be specially issued and disseminated throughout the Three Realms and Ten Directions, the Nine Dark Abysses of the Netherworld, the Underworld Courts, and all subordinate domains, commanding each to take heed and respond accordingly. May the bound souls of the departed be thereby commended, the lost spirits of the hidden paths released, their transgressions absolved, and their grievances redressed. May they behold the light, universally partake in deliverance, attend the assembly to hear the Dao, and receive transformation for rebirth. May it further be wished that the nation’s fortune endure, the realm know tranquility, wind and rain arrive in season, and calamities and pestilence vanish. May all living beings universally attain the fruition of the Dao. In fear and trembling before the imperial majesty, this memorial is concluded with utmost reverence, identical to that of the Heavenly Thearch.

*Attached Note*:
A memorial submitted by so-and-so, petitioning for the solemn establishment of the Supreme Yellow Register Grand Fast to directly commend the departed soul of so-and-so, and universally commend all assembled spirits, as well as the suffering souls and sinful shades of the Ten Directions and Nine Netherworlds. Now desiring to open the ritual altar and proceed in accordance with established protocols, beseeching the issuance of a sagacious edict to be promulgated throughout the Three Realms and Ten Directions.

To the Great Monad:
[Name], of such-and-such a ritual rank and surname.

Now, in accordance with the memorial from such-and-such a locale, identical to that of the August Heaven, awaiting the promulgation of the sagacious edict, this petitioner remains concerned that the distant and obscure netherworlds of Fengdu, the profound depths of the Yellow Springs, cannot be reached without the illumination of wisdom. The departed souls to be commended are boundless in their transgressions, their karmic retributions and consequences causing their spirits to sink and drown. To deliver them from grievances and restore their souls to life, and to effect the transformation and deliverance of all beings in accordance with the ordained mandates, this matter cannot be undertaken without first submitting it for imperial consideration.

This memorial is respectfully recorded and presented before the Most Compassionate and Merciful Great Monad, the Perceiver of Cries and Responder to Suffering, the Heavenly Worthy of Salvation through Suffering in the Eastern Ultimate Palace. Humbly beseeching the Dao’s compassion to grant this petition, may a sagacious edict be specially issued, commanding the Perfected of Salvation and the Nine Radiance Lads to receive the celestial mandates of the Azure Bureau, wielding the divine power of wisdom’s light to illuminate the Three Paths and clarify the Five Realms. From the Northern Capital’s Springs Bureau, may the suffering multitudes emerge; from the Southern Ultimate’s Crimson Bureau, may the celestial hosts descend to refine the souls. May the deceased so-and-so, all commended spirits in assembly, and the suffering souls and sinful shades of the Ten Directions and Nine Netherworlds have their transgressions pardoned, their knots untied, and their stains cleansed. May the waters bear the yin talismans, and the fires convey the yang omens. May the decayed bones flourish anew, and the withered remains be restored to life. May their forms and appearances be made manifest, that the power of the Dao may be displayed. May they ascend to attend the Most High, be ranked in the Southern Palace, forever abide in blessed longevity, and seal away their karmic debts. After nine audiences of submission and five days of covenant proclamation, humbly beseeching verification to succor the deceased. May the profound Five Realms universally partake in the grace of rebirth, and the silent Nine Netherworlds all bathe in the transformation of compassion. Fully adhering to the great creation, may the fast’s merit be accomplished. In fear and trembling before the celestial majesty, this memorial is concluded with utmost reverence, identical to that of the August Heaven.

*Attached Note*:
A memorial submitted by so-and-so, petitioning for the solemn establishment of the Supreme Yellow Register Grand Fast to directly commend the departed soul of so-and-so and universally commend all assembled spirits, as well as the suffering souls and sinful shades of the Ten Directions and Nine Netherworlds. Now desiring to promulgate the celestial mandates and summon them to the altar, proceeding in accordance with established protocols, beseeching the issuance of a sagacious edict to be promulgated throughout the Three Realms and Ten Directions.

To the Nine Netherworlds:
[Name], of such-and-such a ritual rank and surname.

Now, in accordance with the memorial from such-and-such a locale, identical to that of the August Heaven, awaiting the implementation of the sagacious edict, this petitioner remains concerned that the hidden paths of the Northern Prison and the layered earthen mounds of Fengdu’s springs may still detain the sinful souls, preventing their immediate release. This would hinder the deliverance, necessitating this submission for imperial consideration.

This memorial is respectfully recorded and presented before the Heavenly Worthy of Salvation from the Nine Netherworlds. Humbly beseeching the celestial compassion to specially issue a decree of grace, commanding the Three Officials and Nine Bureaus, the Five Peaks and Nine Provinces, the Northern Fengdu, the inner and outer palace caverns, the underworld passes and hidden tribunals, the eternal night’s springs and gates, the Ten Directions and Nine Netherworlds, and all prisons, their attending officers, judges, and clerks to each take heed and respond accordingly. May the deceased so-and-so, all commended spirits in assembly, and all suffering souls and sinful shades of the Nine Netherworlds have their names stricken from the records of karmic trials endured in past lives, and their entries erased from the endless ledgers of grievances suffered after death. May their karmic registers be burned, and their evil roots extinguished. May they depart the hidden passes and partake in the fast’s dharma. Further beseeching the compassionate light to descend and illuminate the depths of the Yellow Springs, that all suffering beings may forever depart the evil destinies, and the boundless lost spirits universally bathe in the blessings of good affinity. May the hidden nights be illuminated, and the trials of Fengdu cease. In fear and trembling before the celestial majesty, this memorial is prostrated and concluded with utmost reverence, identical to that of the August Heaven.

*Attached Note*:
Identical to that of the Great Monad.

To the Southern Ultimate:
[Name], of such-and-such a ritual rank and surname.

Now, in accordance with the locale of [Name] and following the precedent of the *Homage to August Heaven*, awaiting the issuance of the imperial edict, this minister remains concerned that the departed souls thus commended, long sunken in the hidden nights and lost to their original true nature, must borrow the essence of yang to refine their forms and transform their substance. Apart from the already established Flower Pools of Water and Fire, where refinement and deliverance proceed according to ritual protocol, it is desired that the officials and clerks of the Southern Palace descend as scheduled, and that all writs of refinement, transformation, and generation be duly enacted. Yet, not daring to presume upon their issuance, this matter must be respectfully submitted for imperial consideration.

This minister humbly records this memorial and presents it before the August Presence of the Southern Ultimate, Great Emperor of Longevity. Reverently beseeching the celestial compassion to deign to issue a sagacious edict, may it descend through the Three Realms and the Ten Directions, to all places under their jurisdiction, that the departed souls be illuminated and absolved, and the guilty spirits enlightened. Further beseeching that the Dan Tian World, the Water and Fire Bureaus of the Southern Palace, the Vermilion Numinous Fire Mansion, the Upper Palace of the Southern Prosperity, the Halls of Radiant Yang, and the Courts of Flowing Fire—along with all true officials and generals of refinement and deliverance—descend at the appointed time to manifestly assist in the rites. May the souls thus commended in this assembly receive transformation and rebirth, ascending according to their karmic fruits. May the four kinds of birth and the six paths of existence, the bound and destitute spirits, all partake in the merit of transmutation, forever departing the suffering of submersion. May the fast’s merit be accomplished, and both the hidden and manifest realms receive grace.

In fear and trembling before the celestial majesty, this memorial is prostrated and concluded with utmost reverence, identical to that of the August Heaven.

*Attached Note*:
The opening and closing of this memorial to the Vermilion Numinous [Fire Mansion] are identical to those of the Southern Ultimate’s memorial.

To the Vermilion Numinous Deliverer of Lives, Heavenly Worthy:
Two attached notes, both identical to the memorial to the Heavenly August.

To the Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions:

This minister, in accordance with the locale of [Name] and following the precedent of the *Homage to the Heavenly August*, awaiting the issuance of the imperial edict, remains concerned for the boundless guilty spirits thus commended. They bear the karmic obstructions of many lives and the transgressions of accumulated generations, sunk for ten thousand kalpas with no end in sight. Reverently following the ritual protocols bequeathed by the Most Sagely, nine mornings of repentance and supplication are offered, seeking mercy and confessing faults to release burdens and dissolve enmity. It is desired that the gods and immortals of the myriad heavens, the numinous officials and sagely hosts, transcribe and submit these words, that pardon and absolution be graciously granted. This matter must be respectfully submitted for imperial consideration.

This minister humbly records this memorial and presents it before the August Presence of the Eastern Infinite, Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy. Reverently beseeching the celestial compassion to assent to this minister’s plea, deigning to issue a sagacious edict, may it descend through the Ten Directions of the Infinite Worlds, the Earth-Water Underworld Bureaus, and all places under their jurisdiction, that the departed souls be absolved and illuminated, and the guilty spirits enlightened. Further beseeching the majestic divine power and wisdom to scatter reflections and divide forms, pervading the Ten Extremities and penetrating the Nine Nether realms. May the boundless hells all behold the celestial countenance, and the deliverance of the deceased [Name], the souls commended in this assembly, and the households of the fast’s disciples—along with their hundred, thousand, ten-thousand generations of ancestors and karmically linked kin—be achieved. May the suffering souls and guilty spirits of the Ten Directions and Nine Nether realms depart the hidden nights, their evil roots extinguished. May they arrive at the fast’s altar and universally receive deliverance.

On the day the fast is established, further beseeching that the gods and immortals of the Ten Directions, the numinous officials and sagely hosts, be commanded to descend to the altar, submitting the sincerity of the fast. May they deign to bestow their luminous grace, witnessing and pledging the rites. May the disciples who established the fast forever abide in blessed longevity, each securing their rightful destiny. May the sentient in the yang realms and the forsaken in the yin realms all partake in the merit of repentance, together escaping the suffering of samsara. May grace extend to households and nations, benefiting both the living and the dead.

In fear and trembling before the celestial majesty, this minister prostrates and knocks his head to the ground, acknowledging the gravity of this offense. Respectfully submitting this memorial for imperial consideration.

**Memorial to the Cavernous Abyss**

[Your humble servant, the Dharma-ranked official of such-and-such position and surname, respectfully submits:]

Now, in accordance with the petitioner’s native place and purpose for entering the fast—to invoke blessings and protection for the living—I, though unworthy, could not suppress the words of supplication. Having previously announced on such-and-such day of such-and-such month, I first raised the precious banner to proclaim the intent of the fast above.

Today, following the standards of the *Yellow Register* scriptures and the ranks of the numinous immortals of the Lower Prime, I establish the numinous altar and solemnly perform the fast’s rites. Reverently adhering to the prescribed order, I proclaim the true statutes, present obeisance to the Celestial Officials, and perform the deliverance of all chapters. I issue the primordial talismanic decrees of the Celestial Worthy of Original Beginning, the *Golden Register* and *White Tablet*, the true talismans for salvation from suffering, the *Precious Register of the Supreme Lord for Ascension to Heaven*, the true talismans of the Jade Clarity for delivering souls from darkness and shattering the earth-prisons, the *Nine Dragon Talismanic Decrees of the Azure Palace*, the *Divine Tiger Jade Tablets*, and the *Supreme Lord’s Edict of Amnesty*—all to deliver the departed soul of so-and-so, the spirits of those in assembly for universal deliverance, and the suffering souls of the ten directions, nine nether realms, and imprisoned shades, that they may emerge from eternal night and receive the merit of this fast.

I respectfully select such-and-such day of such-and-such month to open the fast’s altar, summoning and gathering the departed souls to attend and receive deliverance. Beginning at dawn on such-and-such day, the main fast and ritual circumambulations commence, spanning three days and nine audiences. On such-and-such night, a universal offering of pure, unimpeded *hushi* is set forth, and the night fast refines and delivers the six paths, four modes of birth, and all lonely, lingering souls. On such-and-such night, the transformations of water and fire refine the souls of those universally delivered. The *Nine Perfected Wondrous Precepts* are transmitted, and the primordial talismanic decrees, *Golden Register* and *White Tablet* for longevity, *Life Talismans*, and *Registers of Liberation* are issued to guarantee their promotion and ascension.

Upon completion, a memorial is presented to report the merit, and the altar is dismantled after the rites conclude. On such-and-such night, a pure offering is respectfully prepared for the Three Realms’ lofty perfected ones, a libation of three hundred and sixty divisions, to repay the vast grace above and present the dragon tablets and memorial tablets.

Apart from the matters already stated, I humbly memorialize the August Thearch, beseeching the descent of edicts, and memorialize the Celestial Thearchs of the various heavens, entreating the issuance of their sagely decrees. These are to be transmitted to the true bureaus of the Three Realms and dispatched to their respective jurisdictions. The birth and death years and months of the delivered souls are separately recorded in a register and submitted to the *Upper Clarity Heavenly Pivot Institute* beneath the Three Heavenly Gates, awaiting the imperial decree for promulgation.

Yet I remain concerned that in the dark prisons of the northern wastes, the earthen ramparts of Fengdu, and the places where sinful souls are bound, they may not be immediately released to attend, thus hindering their deliverance. This matter must be memorialized.

[Your humble servant respectfully records this memorial and presents it before the Cavernous Abyss’s *Three Modes of Samādhi*, the Boundless Supreme Supreme Great Unity Heavenly Lord, and the Celestial Worthies of the Three Caverns. I reverently await the sagely decree, beseeching its descent to the Three Realms and ten directions, the nine ramparts of the Yellow Springs, the realms of wind, Brahmā, steel, and the four poles, the regions of northern desolation and distant seclusion, and all yin bureaus, nether offices, and dark prisons. May the enlightened souls be illuminated, and the departed souls be delivered. May all those sunk in darkness universally receive transcendence. May the merit of the fast be perfected, and both the living and the dead partake in its grace.]

[I, your humble servant, dread offending the celestial majesty. With utmost reverence and trepidation, I kowtow and prostrate myself, acknowledging my mortal transgressions. I respectfully submit this memorial for your consideration.]

**Memorial Presented.**
*In the such-and-such year, month, and day, your humble servant, the Dharma-ranked official of such-and-such position and surname, respectfully submits this memorial.*

**Attached Note:**
A memorial is presented on behalf of so-and-so for the solemn establishment of the *Supreme Yellow Register Grand Fast*, primarily to deliver the departed soul of so-and-so and universally deliver the assembled souls. Now, the altar is to be opened, and the rites performed in accordance with the statutes, with nine audiences of repentance and thanksgiving. Confessing transgressions, I rely upon the numinous officials to transcribe and memorialize the sincerity of the fast, seeking amnesty and deliverance. I beseech the issuance of a sagely decree, to be promulgated throughout the Three Realms and ten directions for implementation.

**Perfected King,**
*Your humble servant, the Dharma-ranked official of such-and-such position and surname.*

Here follows the translation:

---

Now, according to the joint memorial from such-and-such Provincial Administration Commission and the Cavernous Abyss, awaiting the issuance of the sagely decree, your servant further considers that all the delivered souls, burdened by karmic obstructions from past lives, remain bound and afflicted in the dark paths. Desiring their amnesty and deliverance from grievances, liberation from suffering realms, restoration of spirit to its origin, and manifestation of form and dignity, I must rely upon the grace of Your luminous majesty to condescend and bestow salvation. This matter requires memorializing.

To the right, your servant respectfully records this memorial and presents it before the Nine Heavens’ Investigative, Responding, Primordial, Protective, and Southern Culmen Perfected King, the Great Emperor of Vermilion Numen, humbly beseeching Your celestial compassion to grant this petition. May a special sagely decree descend to the Three Realms and ten directions, to all affiliated Perfected Bureaus, and to the nine subterranean yin realms and all places therein. May it illuminate and absolve the departed souls, dispelling their transgressions. Furthermore, I beseech the descent of Your divine emanation to oversee and receive these supplications, accomplishing the merit of the fast, dissolving demonic obstructions, and bestowing the flow of sagely beneficence to deliver the departed souls. May the suffering and forsaken be universally uplifted and aided. May the altar be guarded and protected, and the memorial transmitted to the celestial courts. May all be rewarded for their merit, with ranks and titles conferred. May the grace extend to both state and family, benefiting the living and the dead. Above, may it accord with the Dao’s love of life; below, may it fulfill your servant’s earnest prayers. Presumptuously offending Your celestial majesty.

As in the previous Cavernous Abyss memorial, this concludes with the utmost reverence.

To the Nine Heavens’ Supreme Emperor,
*Your humble servant, the Dharma-ranked official of such-and-such position and surname.*

**Attached Note:**
Now, according to the joint memorial from such-and-such Provincial Administration Commission of such-and-such locality, such-and-such village, and the Cavernous Abyss, awaiting the issuance of the sagely decree, your servant further considers that all the delivered souls, deluded in past lives and this existence, have pursued falsehood and strayed from truth. Bound by karmic retribution, their spirits have sunk into perdition. Desiring the harmonization of yin and yang, the return of their hun and po, the coalescence of their form with the nine qi, and the nurturing of their three primordial essences, I must rely entirely upon the grace of Your luminous majesty to condescend and bestow deliverance. This matter requires memorializing.

To the right, your servant respectfully records this memorial and presents it before the Numinous Treasure’s Spontaneous Nine Heavens’ Life-Generating Divine Emperor, humbly beseeching Your celestial compassion to grant this petition. May a special sagely decree descend to the Three Realms and ten directions, to the Nine Heavens’ Alchemical Transformation and Life-Generating Perfected Bureaus, to the subterranean and aquatic nether courts, and to all places therein. May it illuminate and absolve the departed souls, dispelling their transgressions. Furthermore, I beseech Your condescension to bestow the grace of Your luminous majesty, verifying and aiding the alchemical transformation. May the divine qi of the Nine Heavens descend, and the decayed bones of the nine subterranean realms arise. May the delivered souls and suffering spirits of the dark paths be enabled to restore their bones, revive from death, gather their qi, and coalesce their spirits. May their evil roots be eradicated, and may they ascend to the realms of blessedness. Moreover, I pray for extraordinary blessings to benefit and protect the living, universally extending to the state and its people, that all may partake in this radiant fortune. Presumptuously offending Your celestial majesty.

As in the Cavernous Abyss memorial, this concludes with the utmost reverence.

A Memorial to Petition for the Solemn Establishment of the Supreme Yellow Register Grand Fast to Offer Principal Salvation for So-and-So and Universal Salvation for All Souls

Now, desiring to issue talismanic decrees to summon and gather the departed to the altar, and in accordance with the ritual statutes to perform their deliverance, I humbly beseech Your sagely decree to be bestowed upon the Three Realms, the Ten Directions, and the Nine Heavens’ Offices of Alchemical Transformation and Life-and-Death, for implementation.

To the Thirty-Two Heavenly Sovereigns,
Your subordinate, the Ritual Officer So-and-So, respectfully memorializes:

In accordance with the joint *Dongyuan* memorial submitted by the such-and-such Provincial Administration Commission of such-and-such locale, awaiting Your sagely decree for implementation, I remain concerned that the souls of the departed thus offered for salvation may yet linger in spiritual stagnation, their corporeal essences adrift. They must rely upon the burning of *qi* to complete the coalescence of form and spirit.

Moreover, on the day of the fast’s establishment, it is desired that the Golden Lads and Jade Maidens of the various heavens, along with the Directing Talisman Envoys and Mounted Messengers, descend to the altar site to present the sincerity of the fast above. This matter must be memorialized for Your attention.

Your subordinate has respectfully recorded this memorial and now presents it before the Thirty-Two Heavenly Sovereigns. I reverently beseech Your celestial compassion to grant my petition, specially bestowing Your sagely decree upon the Three Realms, the Ten Directions, and all places, that they may respond with condescending grace, illuminating with the radiance of Your favor and ensuring the free flow of purifying *qi*.

May the departed So-and-So, the souls gathered for salvation, and all suffering spirits and sin-laden essences of the Ten Directions and Nine Netherworlds depart the dark night and assemble at the altar of the fast. May they be bathed in the yang essence, their embryonic lives irrigated. May they gather their spirits and return to their origin, receiving transformation and rebirth.

Furthermore, I beseech that a decree be issued to the heavens, dispatching the following to descend as scheduled and oversee the altar: the Heavenly Inspectors of the Fast, the Incense-Attending Golden Lads, the Flower-Scattering Jade Maidens, the Five Emperors’ Directing Talisman Envoys, the Daily Incense Officials, the Messengers of Transmission and Memorial, and the Flying Dragon Mounted Messengers. May they safeguard the altar, that the fast’s merit may ascend and resonate, delivering both the living and the dead, and bestowing grace upon households and the state.

Presumptuously offending Your celestial majesty. As in the *Dongyuan* memorial, this concludes with the utmost reverence.

A Memorial to Petition for the Solemn Establishment of the Supreme Yellow Register Grand Fast to Offer Principal Salvation for So-and-So and Universal Salvation for All Souls

Now, desiring to issue talismanic decrees and request the descent of officials to summon and gather the departed to the altar, and in accordance with the ritual statutes to perform their deliverance, I humbly beseech Your sagely decree to be bestowed upon the Three Realms and the Ten Directions for implementation.

To the Lord of the East and the Queen Mother of the West,
Your subordinate, the Ritual Officer So-and-So, respectfully memorializes:

In accordance with the joint *Dongyuan* memorial submitted by the such-and-such Provincial Administration Commission of such-and-such locale, awaiting the proclamation of Your sagely decree, I remain concerned that the souls of the departed gathered for salvation may yet be bound by karmic retribution, their spirits submerged in suffering. To achieve the coalescence of *qi* into form, the molding of souls, and the forging of essences, they must rely upon the primordial *qi* to transform and refine their forms and spirits. This matter must be memorialized for Your attention.

Your subordinate has respectfully recorded this memorial and now presents it before the Most Exalted Lord of the Eastern Flowery Realm, the Green Lad of the Upper Prime, and the Perfected Sovereign of the Ninefold Numinous and Most Wondrous White Jade Tortoise Terrace Night-Shining Golden Perfection, the Primordial Mother of the Myriad *Qi*. I reverently beseech Your sagely compassion to condescend with grace and oversee the alchemical transformation.

May the primordial *qi* of the Two Modes descend, and the decayed bones of the Nine Earths arise. May the souls gathered for salvation be specially granted the refinement of their embryonic forms to return to their origin, their *qi* coalescing into form. May they receive transformation and rebirth, ascending according to their karmic fruits.

Moreover, may the grace of wisdom be universally extended to those submerged in darkness. May all partake in the merit of transformation and escape the sufferings of the wheel of rebirth. May the Three Paths of Suffering cease their retribution, and the Five Realms be illuminated.

Presumptuously offending Your sagely majesty. As in the *Dongyuan* memorial, this concludes with the utmost reverence.

The concluding formula for the above memorials is identical to that of the memorials to the Three Clarities.

**Memorial from the Celestial Pivot Institute**
(Attached ledger memorials precede this; for grand universal deliverance rites with numerous names of the departed, each is submitted in separate sealed documents, as below.)

**From the Bureau of the Numinous Treasure Great Ritual:**

Previously, in accordance with the petition submitted by the such-and-such Provincial Administration Commission of such-and-such county and locale, seeking blessings for the living, this Bureau, finding the plea irrepressible, on such-and-such month and day, pre-announced the raising of the sacred banner to proclaim the intent of the fast above.

Now, in accordance with the talismanic writ and numinous efficacy of the Yellow Register of the Lower Prime, a numinous altar is established to solemnly perform the fast’s rituals. Reverently following the prescribed order, the true statutes are proclaimed. The petitions to the Heavenly Officials for deliverance are presented, and the talismanic decrees of the Primordial Beginning, the Golden Register and White Writs, the True Talismans for Salvation from Suffering, the Precious Register for Ascending to Heaven by the Most High’s Amnesty, the Jade Clarity True Talismans for Delivering Netherworld Souls and Breaking Open Hell, the Nine Dragon Talismanic Decrees of the Green Palace, and the Divine Tiger Jade Tablets are issued.

The departed So-and-So, the souls gathered for salvation, and all imprisoned and suffering spirits of the Ten Directions and Nine Netherworlds are delivered from the eternal night to receive the fast’s merit.

Respectfully, on such-and-such month and day, the altar of the fast is opened to summon the departed souls to attend and receive deliverance. Beginning at dawn on such-and-such day, the principal fast and ritual circuits are conducted for three days and nine audiences. On such-and-such night, a universal offering of pure, unimpeded *hushi* is set forth, and the night fast’s alchemical transformation is performed. The six paths and four modes of existence, the orphaned souls and stagnant essences, are all included.

On such-and-such night, the transformation through water and fire is enacted for the souls gathered for salvation. The Nine Perfected Wondrous Precepts are transmitted, and the talismanic decrees of the Primordial Beginning, the Golden Register and White Writs, the Longevity Numinous Talismans, and the Registers for Breaking Bonds are issued to ensure their protection and promotion for ascension.

Upon completion, a memorial is presented to report the merit, and the altar is dismantled. On such-and-such night, a reverent offering is made to the Three Realms’ Lofty Perfected, a pure libation to the three hundred and sixty divine positions. In gratitude for the vast grace, the dragon tablets are cast, and the writs are presented.

All matters are detailed and memorialized to the Supreme Emperor. I beseech the bestowal of a sagely decree and memorialize the Heavenly Worthies to issue sagely decrees, instructing the true offices of the Three Realms and all relevant authorities. The names, lifespans, and dates of death of the souls gathered for salvation are recorded in the ledger.

Twenty-seven sealed memorials are now dispatched. All are doubly sealed and respectfully submitted for timely presentation. I beseech the bestowal of sagely decrees for implementation.

This matter requires an official report to:

**The Three Masters of the Numinous Treasure**

The Dharma-rank holder, [Name], on behalf of [Name] from [Location] under the jurisdiction of the [Prefecture] Administration Commission of [County], having received the petition to establish this fast for the blessing and protection of the living, and finding the plea irrepressible, did on the [day] of the [month] foretell the occasion by first raising the sacred banner to announce the intent of the fast. Now, in accordance with the *Yellow Register* scriptures of the Lower Prime and the ranks of the numinous immortals, a sacred altar is erected to solemnly perform the fast rites. Reverently following the prescribed order, the true canons are proclaimed and expounded. Prostrations are made to the Celestial Officials, and petitions for salvation are presented. The primordial mandates of the Yuan Shi, the *Golden Register* and *White Tablets*, the *True Talismans for Salvation from Suffering*, the *Precious Register for Ascension to Heaven* by the edict of the Most High, the *True Talismans of Jade Clarity for Deliverance of Shades and Shattering of Hell*, the *Nine Dragon Mandates of the Azure Palace*, and the *Jade Tablets of the Divine Tiger* are issued. By these, the deceased [Name], whose soul is here offered salvation along with those of the assembly, and all suffering spirits of the ten directions and nine nether realms—captive souls and tormented shades—are delivered from eternal night to receive the merit of this fast.

Respectfully, on the [day] of the [month], the fast altar shall be opened to summon and gather the departed souls for deliverance. Commencing at dawn on the [day], the proper fast and Daoist rites shall proceed. For three days and nine audiences, the Way shall be practiced.

Upon completion, memorials shall be presented to report the merit, and the altar shall be closed and dispersed.

On the day of the fast and libation, may auspicious radiance be bestowed to witness and bless the altar.

**To the Palace of the Sun**
The Dharma-rank holder, [Name], having received the joint memorial of the Three Masters, and awaiting the proclamation of the imperial edict, yet fearing that the souls of the deceased here offered may have, in their lifetimes, committed transgressions that offended the celestial radiance, thereby incurring karmic entanglements with the *Great Luminous Palace of the Sun* and the *Palace of the Moon*—leading to trials in the Three Paths and eternal damnation—without the grace of merciful radiance, there can be no deliverance. On the night of refinement and deliverance, it is hoped that luminous *qi* may descend to transform and refine the departed souls. This matter must be respectfully reported.

[Name], with due reverence, submits this memorial before the sacred presence of the *Solar Emperor of Blazing Radiance and Flourishing Brilliance*. Humbly beseeching the sagacious compassion of the Emperor, may he deign to issue a sagacious edict, descending to the true offices of the Three Realms, the nine nether realms of earth, and all relevant jurisdictions. In accordance with the *Yellow Register* scriptures of the numinous immortals, the *Primordial Mandates of Yuan Shi*, and the principles of deliverance, may the souls of the deceased here offered, along with all suffering shades of the ten directions’ dark paths—who have, since time immemorial, committed transgressions—be delivered and absolved.

May they depart from the eternal night and behold the light of radiance. Further beseeching the descent of qi and the division of luminous brilliance to illuminate the depths of darkness. May the sweet dew of Dharma-food be poured forth, infusing the Lotus Pools of Water and Fire. May the souls here offered and delivered be refined and bathed in the yang essence, their yin impurities purged by the yin essence of the Lunar Palace, their spirits gathered to return to their origin, receiving transformation and rebirth. May blessings spread throughout the state and family, and grace extend to the living. For all matters of refinement and deliverance in these locales, may the immortal youths and maidens descend as scheduled to manifestly assist in the proclamation and execution.

[This memorial] dares not offend the sacred majesty. As in the previous memorial to the Three Officials, this document is respectfully submitted.

The Five Planets, Four Luminaries, and Five Celestial Dippers—[Name], holding the dharma-rank and surname [X], now, in accordance with the memorial jointly submitted by the Three Masters from [X] village and prefecture, awaits the issuance of the sagacious edict. Moreover, it is feared that all the departed souls here offered, for the sins committed in their lifetimes, have offended the celestial radiance, incurring karmic entanglements in the palaces of the Stellar Mansions and the Three Primes. Bound to the trials of the Three Paths, they have sunk into eternal damnation. Without the grace of luminous compassion, there is no means of deliverance. This matter must be respectfully reported.

[Name], with due reverence, submits this memorial before the *True Lord of Wood Virtue and the Year Star* of the East, the *Star Lord of Destiny in the Eastern Dipper*, and the *Star Lords of the Eastern Seven Mansions*. Humbly beseeching the sagacious compassion of the Lords, may they deign to issue a sagacious edict, descending to the true offices of the Three Realms. In accordance with the records, may the departed soul of [Name], along with all the souls here offered and the suffering shades of the ten directions’ dark paths and nine nether realms—who have, since time immemorial, committed transgressions—be absolved and permitted to behold the light of radiance. Further beseeching the descent of qi and the division of luminous brilliance to illumine the eternal night.

May the sweet dew of Dharma-food be poured forth, infused into the Flower Pool of Water and Fire. Thus may all the departed souls here offered be cleansed of yin defilements, their evil roots extinguished and destroyed. Transformed, may they be reborn; universally may they receive deliverance. May grace equal that bestowed upon the living, and blessings extend to the state and household. Presumptuously daring the sacred majesty, this memorial follows the form of the previous day’s palace petition, concluded with utmost reverence.

Now, in accordance with the joint memorial of the Three Masters from [Name]’s native village, and awaiting the issuance of the imperial decree, we remain mindful that all the departed souls thus commended still languish in the long night of darkness, having lost their original true nature. They must borrow the yang essence to refine their forms and transform their substance. Apart from the already established Water and Fire Flowery Pools, where refinement and deliverance proceed according to the ritual codes, we require the officials and generals of the Southern Ascendant Palace to respond in timely accord, attuning to the invocation and aiding the ritual proceedings. This matter must be respectfully reported.

To this end, [Name], with reverence, presents this memorial before the Six Bureau Star Lords of the Southern Dipper and the Saintly Lord of the Vermilion Numinous Fire Prefecture, humbly beseeching Your Sagely Compassion to specially issue a sacred decree, extending through the Three Realms and the Ten Directions to all places, illuminating and acting in accordance with the *Huanglu Lingxian Ritual Codes* and the *Yuan-shi Fu-ming* principles of deliverance. May the departed souls be pardoned and released, their transgressions dispelled and their obscurities enlightened.

We further implore that decrees be dispatched to the Cinnabar Heavenly Realm, the Vermilion Numinous Fire Prefecture, the Southern Ascendant Palace, and the Water and Fire Bureaus, commanding the dispatch of refining and deliverance officials and functionaries to descend as scheduled, assisting in the proclamation and pacification, refining and delivering the assembled departed souls—boundless transgressors all.

May these pierce the depths of the Nine Springs and illumine the darkness of the hidden realms.

May the departed soul of [Name], the assembled souls under ritual deliverance, and all suffering spirits confined in the Nine Gloomy Realms—bound prisoners all—have their names stricken from the ledgers of transgression and their roots of evil eradicated. May the Hidden Writs of the Dark Mystery, the Jade Tablets of the Primordial Origin, and the Divine Tiger talismanic decrees be issued, dispatching the Jade Maidens of the Reverse-Life Dark Bureau to summon souls and seize spirits, the Dark Elder Officials—male to the left, female to the right—and the messengers of the Three Departments to pursue and retrieve the wandering souls. May they all assemble at the ritual altar, receive the talismanic decrees, and pursue and summon the souls under ritual deliverance, extending to the six paths and four modes of rebirth, the solitary spirits and stagnant souls. May they all partake in this grace and mercy, emerging from the dark passes, beholding the light, and presenting themselves before the altar steps. May their forms be made manifest and their karmic retributions clearly revealed. May they receive refinement and rebirth, ascending in accordance with their fruits. We further pray for the sagely creation to bestow blessings upon the state and the people, that all sentient beings may equally partake in this radiant fortune.

Presuming upon Your Sagely Might. The conclusion is identical to that of the memorial to the Southern Dipper.

We further implore the dispatch of the appropriate merit-earning functionaries, lictors, and refinement-officiating lords to guard the altar, reverently receive the sacred conveyance, proclaim the rites of refinement, and succor the destitute souls. When the deliverance of the Six Paths, Four Modes of Birth, orphaned souls, and lingering spirits is complete, may they be escorted to this office, whereupon their three-lifetime karmic records shall be swiftly examined. May all be ranked in order and reborn according to their stations. Thus may the fast’s affairs be brought to perfect fulfillment, and both the living and the dead receive deliverance.

To the Nine Heavens’ Treasurer of Fortune and Ordainer of Destiny, the Perfected Lord—submitted with utmost reverence by [Name], of such-and-such dharma rank and surname.

Now, in accordance with the joint memorial of this petitioner’s native village and the Three Masters, and following the issuance of the imperial decree, it is necessary to submit this report for Your Sagely hearing.

This petitioner humbly submits this memorial to the Celestial Bureaus’ August Lord of Myriad Fortunes and the Celestial Bureaus’ assembled Perfected Lords, beseeching Your Sagely Compassion to issue a special decree to all celestial bureaus, the Three Realms and Ten Directions, and the Nine Earths’ dark yin underworld offices. May it be in accordance with the *Ordinances of the Numinous and Immortal of the Yellow Register* and the *Principles of Deliverance by the Primordial Mandate of the Celestial Worthy of the Origin*, that the departed soul of so-and-so, the spirits being offered for in this assembly, and all suffering souls and sin-laden spirits of the Ten Directions and Nine Netherworlds—those who, whether in past lives or this present existence, bear deep karmic debts, are bound by restraints, or remain unliberated—be specially pardoned and their karmic offenses expunged, that they may depart the dark paths. May they personally approach the ritual altar, receive deliverance, attend the assembly of the Perfected to hear the Dharma, undergo refinement, and be reborn. Further, may obstacles and calamities be dispelled, auspicious signs gather, the ritual’s merit be fulfilled, and both household and state partake of grace.

[Should this memorial] offend Your Sagely Majesty, this petitioner, together with the Nine Heavens’ memorial, submits this most reverent statement.

**Sealed Document**
To the Celestial Bureaus’ August Lord of Myriad Fortunes—submitted with reverence by [Name], of such-and-such dharma rank and surname.
To the Perfected Officers, Generals, and Clerks of the Three Caverns’ Scriptures, Registers, Talismans, and Mandates—submitted by [Name], of such-and-such dharma rank and surname.

Now, in accordance with the joint memorial of this petitioner’s native place and the Three Masters, awaiting the issuance of the imperial edict, it is further feared that all the departed souls thus recommended, owing to the three karmic actions and accumulated transgressions of habitual wrongdoing, have defiled and disdained the numinous scriptures, violated the sutras and precepts, sinking into the dark night of the netherworld and falling into the abyss of evil. They must rely upon the *True Scriptures of the Most High*, the *Numinous Talismans*, and the *Secret Glyphs*, through which the qi is proclaimed and transmitted to descend and succor the submerged souls. This matter must be reported for Your august hearing.

This petitioner respectfully submits this memorial to the *Treasure Scriptures of the Three Caverns*, the *Nine Grades of Dharma Registers*, the *Exalted Perfected and Attendant Host of Immortals*, the *Primordial Mandates of the Celestial Worthy*, the *Numinous Glyphs and Heavenly Writings*, and all the *Perfected Immortals, Numinous Officers, Generals, and Clerks*.

May Your Sagely Compassion deign to issue a sacred edict. May the *Secret Repositories of the Three Clarities*, the *Orthodox Dharma of the Ten Directions*, and all the *Mystic Bureaus* of the *Guardians and Attendants* unseal the hidden and open the sealed, dividing their radiance and descending their qi. Thus may the profound mysteries of the *Harmonized Perfection* be chanted, and the rules of *talisman-writing and brush-stroke* be followed. Thereby may the recommended departed souls and suffering spirits of the dark paths, riding this power of wisdom, escape the netherworld, resolve karmic grievances, and seal away karmic debts. May they fully comprehend their past lives and attain realization of the *True Constant*. Together may they partake of the merit of the transmitted qi and forever transcend the suffering of rebirth. May grace extend to the living and blessings spread to the state and household.

Should this memorial offend Your Sagely Majesty, this petitioner, together with the Nine Heavens’ memorial, submits this most reverent statement.

**Sealed Document**

Now, in accordance with the joint memorial of the Three Masters from such-and-such village and prefecture, awaiting the issuance of the imperial decree, the *Primordial Mandates of the Celestial Worthy*, the *Cloud-Script Heavenly Writ*, the *Lineage of Liberation*, and the *True Talismans and Precious Registers* shall be transcribed and executed according to form. Yet, this petitioner fears that this mortal frame, coarse and impure, has not yet merged with the *True Constant*. Unable to harmonize qi with the Void, errors may arise in the brushwork. Thus, this matter must be respectfully reported.

To the *Celestial Perfected Sovereign* of the *Three Clarities’ Upper Realm*, this petitioner humbly submits this memorial, prostrating before Your Sagely Presence and beseeching Your merciful grace to bestow the wellspring of wisdom. May a single qi infuse and irrigate the inner viscera and cinnabar origin. May this petitioner, in transcribing the celestial talismans, attain numinous responsiveness, perfectly aligning with the subtleties of their revelation and silently conforming to the standards of brushwork. Thus may the bound souls of the departed, reverently receiving the *Mandate*, be liberated and reborn. May all this rely upon Your benevolent favor to fulfill the good fruit. Should this memorial offend Your Sagely Majesty, this petitioner, together with the memorial of the *Scriptures and Registers*, submits this most reverent statement.

**To the Three Yuan Perfected Lords**
Submitted by [Name], of such-and-such dharma rank and surname.

Now, in accordance with the joint memorial of the Three Masters from such-and-such village and prefecture, awaiting the issuance of the decree, all memorials, petitions, and matters of supplication must traverse the *World of Rigid Wind* before reaching the celestial bureaus along the *Cloud Roads*. Fearing obstruction, this matter must be respectfully reported.

To the *Perfected Lords of the Upper, Middle, and Lower Yuan*, this petitioner humbly submits this memorial, prostrating before Your Sagely Presence and imploring Your merciful grace to issue a sagely decree to all subordinate celestial bureaus of the *Three Realms*, the officials of the *Rigid Wind*, the guardians of the *Heavenly Gates*, and all governing authorities. May they take heed and, upon encountering the memorials, petitions, and supplications now presented, permit their swift passage through the *Rigid Wind*, hastening their return to the *Provincial Court* for immediate imperial review and prompt issuance. Thus may the rites be perfectly accomplished and the living and the dead alike receive liberation. Should this memorial offend Your Sagely Majesty, this petitioner, together with the memorial to the *Celestial Perfected Sovereign*, submits this most reverent statement.

**To the Ten Perfected Lords**
Submitted by [Name], of such-and-such dharma rank and surname.

Now, in accordance with the joint memorial of the Three Masters from such-and-such village and prefecture, awaiting the issuance of the decree, this petitioner fears that the *Dark Capital* lies distant and the *Yellow Springs* run deep. Without the radiance of Your benevolent grace, there can be no deliverance. Thus, this matter must be respectfully reported.

To the *Great Compassionate, Great Merciful Savior Perfected Lord*, the *Great Compassionate, Great Merciful, Great Wise Perfected Lord*, the *Great Compassionate, Great Merciful Liberator from Sin Perfected Lord*, the *Great Compassionate, Great Merciful Deliverer Perfected Lord*, the *Perfected Lord of Wondrous Conduct of the Upper Clarity*, the *Perfected Lord of the Great Ultimate of the Upper Clarity*, the *Perfected Lord of Universal Liberation of the Upper Clarity*, the *Perfected Lord of Universal Salvation of the Upper Clarity*, the *Perfected Lord of the Left Mystery of the Upper Clarity*, and the *Perfected Lord of the Right Mystery of the Upper Clarity*, this petitioner humbly submits this memorial, reverently beseeching Your true compassion to transmit the *Mandate* and deploy the power of Your merciful vows, releasing the radiance of Your majestic and numinous wisdom. May it illuminate the *Three Paths* and brighten the *Five Realms*. May the accumulated sins and karmic debts of all the bound souls in this assembly be absolved and liberated.

May they emerge from the dark paths and attain the honor of approaching the altar’s steps. May they hear the scriptures and listen to the Dharma, receiving deliverance and rebirth. May they fully receive the grace of transformation and nurturance, universally relieving the suffering of those sunk in the depths.

Daring to offend Your true majesty, this petition is jointly submitted with the memorial to the *Three Primordial Perfected Lords*, sealed with utmost reverence.

The *Perfected Administrators of the Five Bureaus*, bearing the Dharma-rank and surname [so-and-so], now, in accordance with the joint memorial of the Three Masters from [such-and-such] village and register, beyond the issued decrees, still fear that the souls thus recommended, along with boundless sinful shades, long sunken in the shadows of the netherworld, have lost their original true nature. They must borrow the yang essence to restore their bodily forms. Though water and fire flower pools have been established, and refinement and deliverance conducted according to the rites, it is necessary to request that the officials and generals of all bureaus jointly assist in the proclamation and execution of these rites.

Daring to offend Your sacred majesty, this petitioner humbly submits this memorial to the *Perfected Lords of the Five Bureaus*—the *Sole Attendant of Revitalization*, the *Mighty Assembly of Merit of Han*, and the *Gatherer of Souls*—reverently beseeching Your sacred compassion to deign to cast the radiance of Your grace downward, allowing the true qi to flow and circulate. May it specially grant to all the bound and recommended souls in this assembly the restoration and reunion of form and spirit, the cleansing of yin defilements. May they refine their embryonic forms and return to their original nature, receiving transformation and rebirth. Further, may Your sacred decree dispatch the ranks of immortal maidens for refinement and deliverance, descending as scheduled to manifestly proclaim and execute these rites.

Daring to offend Your sacred majesty, this petition is jointly submitted with the memorial to the *Ten Perfected Lords*, sealed with utmost reverence.

The *Perfected Administrators of the Refinement Bureau of the Southern Florescence Upper Palace* of Nanchang.

To the High Perfected of the Fire Bureau and the Perfected of Refinement and Deliverance:

This petition, identical in form and intent to that submitted to the Five Bureaus, is hereby sealed with the seal of the Five Thunder Institute.

I, [Name], of such-and-such dharma rank and surname, now submit this in accordance with the joint petition of the Three Masters of such-and-such village and prefecture. Beyond the issued decrees, all memorials, petitions, and documents to be presented at the altar—whether their course be through the celestial thoroughfares—must be reported, lest there be obstruction or delay. Moreover, for the dispatch of flying memorials and the presentation of petitions, the establishment of fasts and the setting of jiao rites, one must account for the unpredictability of wind and rain, which may hinder the proper conduct of these observances.

Daring to offend Your sacred majesty, this petition is jointly submitted.

To the Perfected Lords of the Jade Bureau and the Five Thunder Institute, the Perfected Lords of the Jade Pivot and the Five Thunder Institute, the August Saints of the Five Thunders under the Northern Emperor’s Dipper, the August Saints of the Five Thunders of the Thunder Capital Bureau, and the August Saints of the Five Thunders of the Penglai General Water Bureau:

May Your sacred grace deign to issue a decree, commanding the subordinate Perfected Bureaus and the Two Institutes and Three Offices of the Five Thunders, along with the Departments of Wind, Thunder, and Rain. May they, in all instances when this altar presents memorials, petitions, or dispatches documents, first dispatch flying talismans along the celestial thoroughfares to sever and dispel demonic qi. Should any obstruction or delay arise, may the offenders be seized and brought before the Thunder Courts to be punished according to the law.

Further, may Your decree be transmitted to the Earth God of such-and-such prefecture and the Thunder Bureau, commanding the Dragon Gods responsible for this year’s rains, as well as the local altar grottoes and all places charged with wind and rain, to take heed of the present rites. May they, at the appointed time, temporarily suspend rainfall and specially grant clear skies, that the four qi may harmonize and the three luminaries shine brightly. Thus may the Sacred Perfected descend in manifestation, and the fasts and jiao rites be brought to perfect completion.

Daring to offend Your sacred majesty, this petition is jointly submitted with that to the Five Bureaus, sealed with utmost reverence.

Presented in the square envelope to the Perfected Lords of the Jade Bureau and Jade Pivot Five Thunder Institutes.

Before the Ten Directions’ Divine Kings,
I, [Name], of such-and-such dharma rank and surname.

Now, in accordance with the joint petition of the Three Masters from such-and-such village and register, beyond the issued decrees, all proclamations of ritual protocols, inscribed talismans, and written charms seek to partake of Your radiance. Humbly beseeching Your divine witness and attestation, it is necessary to submit this report.

To the Right: This petition is respectfully presented before the Ten Directions’ Boundless Flying Celestial Divine Kings. Prostrating, I implore Your sagely compassion to specially issue a sacred edict, unlocking the Three Clarities’ secret treasuries and revealing the Three Caverns’ true scriptures. May they descend to succor the departed souls and universally deliver the lingering spirits. May the gates of the five karmic roots be sealed, and the Dharma Wheel’s gate of salvation be opened. May all who chant and proclaim gain awakening and understanding; may all who meditate and cultivate attain resonance and communion. May qi descend and spiritual power be apportioned, reviving the dead and restoring the lifeless. May the luminous carriage turn back, and the Perfected oversee the deliverance of beings. It is hoped that the fasts and rites may be perfectly accomplished, and both the hidden and manifest realms receive deliverance.

Daring to offend Your sacred majesty, this petition is jointly submitted with that to the Thunder Courts, sealed with utmost reverence.

Presented to the Earth Bureau,
I, [Name], of such-and-such dharma rank and surname.

Now, in accordance with the joint petition of the Three Masters from such-and-such village and register, beyond the issued decrees, a detailed account is again respectfully submitted, with its heading appended above. A special missive is dispatched to the Divine Tiger Generals and Officers of the Three Realms’ Direct Talisman, to proceed to the Ten Directions and Three Realms, to the hidden gates of earth and water. They are to escort the souls arriving at the altar and reverently receive the merits. Yet, fearing that the various bureaus have not yet received the sacred edict...

Should the souls not be promptly released to proceed, it shall hinder their deliverance and salvation, necessitating this respectful report.

To the North Yin Mysterious Heaven, before the August Emperor of Fengdu, this petition is humbly submitted by [Name]. May Your sacred mercy deign to issue a divine edict, descending to the Ten Palaces and Five Marchmounts, the Nine Earths’ hidden yin realms, the nether courts and shadowy prisons, and all jurisdictions thereunder.

In accordance with the *Huanglu Lingxian Ke Pin* and the primordial talismanic decree of the Celestial Worthy for the deliverance of beings, may the sealed gates of darkness be pardoned and opened, and the sin-laden souls illuminated. May the roots of the deceased [Name], the souls invoked in this assembly, and the myriad ancestors of the dharma-disciples’ households—spanning kalpas of karmic kinship—be thoroughly searched. Whether bound by past-life or present debts, or detained for confrontation, may all be commanded for release, entrusted to the divine officers of Mount Tai and the Divine Tiger Envoys of the Three Realms’ Direct Talisman. May they be escorted in due time to the hallowed altar, awaiting the summons.

There, they shall bathe and pay homage to the Perfected, repenting their transgressions. May they be granted deliverance from the Six Paths and the hidden rites of the Ten Directions. May the sin-laden souls all be absolved and released, gathering together at the dharma feast. May they all receive the merit of salvation, forever freed from the suffering of samsara, wholly relying on Your sacred creation. May the drowned in suffering be universally saved. We humbly beseech Your gracious assent and swift enactment.

To offend Your sacred majesty, this petition is jointly submitted with that to the Ten Directional Divine Kings, sealed with utmost reverence.

Beseeching the Sacred Might,

With the utmost reverence, this petition is humbly submitted.

To the Venerable True Lords of the Five Peaks, the Deputy Lords of Life and Destiny, and the Treasured Vicegerents before the Sacred Presence:

**[Seal]** From the humble petitioner, [Name], of such-and-such rank and surname, respectfully sealed.
**[Seal]** From the ritual master, [Name], of such-and-such dharma rank and surname.

Now, in accordance with the joint petition of the Three Masters from such-and-such locale, and following the issued decrees, we remain concerned that within the grotto-heavens and hidden realms, the examining offices of the numinous bureaus may yet be unaware of the present rites and principles of devotion. The imprisoned souls and all stagnant spirits may not be released to partake in the merit of this retreat. Thus, we find it necessary to submit this report.

To the right, this humble petition is respectfully presented before the Sacred Presence of the Immortal Officials of the Xiaoyou Qingxu Grotto-Heaven of Wangwu Mountain. We prostrate ourselves and beseech Your Sacred Compassion to issue a special sacred decree to the Nine Great Grotto-Heavens, the Thirty-Six Lesser Grotto-Heavens, the Seventy-Two Blessed Lands, and the Three Hundred Sixty Sacred Mountains and Retreat Sanctuaries in all places. May it be proclaimed:

Wherever there are those who maintain incense fires, dwell in cultivation, yet remain entangled in the Five Phases, accumulating the Three Karmas; who consume impure foods, offend the numinous, steal resources, or neglect their devotions—all such transgressions bind them in confinement. We humbly request that You uphold the principles of the *Huanglu Lingxian* scriptures and the salvific decrees of the Primordial Beginning, releasing them to attend the Dharma and hear the scriptures. May their original nature be illuminated, their forms restored, and their ranks advanced in the Southern Palace. Thus may the stagnant spirits ascend, and the blessed courts be purified.

Beseeching the Sacred Might, with the same reverence as the petition to the Deputy Lords of the Five Peaks, this petition is humbly concluded.

**[Seal]** From the ritual master, [Name], of such-and-such dharma rank and surname.

Now, in accordance with the joint petition of the Three Masters from such-and-such locale, and following the issued decrees, we find it necessary to submit this report.

To the right, this humble petition is respectfully presented before the Sacred Presence of the Earthly Sovereign of the Nine Enclosures of the Underworld. We prostrate ourselves and pray for Your Sacred Compassion to issue a special sacred decree to the regions of the Four Quarters, the desolate and remote realms, the profound depths of the earth, and the hidden prisons of the underworld. May all dutifully obey the imperial command, open the gates of the netherworld, deliver the deceased souls, and elevate the stagnant spirits. May the retreat’s merit be fully accomplished in accordance with Your sacred design.

Beseeching the Sacred Might, with the same reverence as the petition to the Grotto-Heavens, this petition is humbly concluded.

To the Dragon-Tiger Lords:

**[Seal]** From the ritual master, [Name], of such-and-such dharma rank and surname.

Now, in accordance with the joint petition of the Three Masters from such-and-such locale, and following the issued decrees, beginning on such-and-such day of such-and-such month, we shall establish a sacred altar and conduct the retreat rites, seeking grace and repenting sins, proclaiming the revealed petitions. Relying on the incense attendants to transmit our sincerity, we find it necessary to submit this report.

To the right, this humble petition is respectfully presented before the Sacred Presence of the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, the Three and Five Merit Officers, the Left and Right Envoys, the Golden Lads of Incense, the Jade Maidens of Transmission, the Direct Talisman Envoys of the Five Thearchs, and the Incense Officials of the Day. We prostrate ourselves and pray that Your Sacred Compassion deign to witness our sincerity. May all petitions be swiftly conveyed to the sacred altar, the incense signals secretly transmitted, and the retreat’s devotion reach the divine. May the assembled perfected and the myriad sages descend from afar. May the essence of cinnabar and azure flourish, and the transformation of compassion be greatly manifested. May merit extend to all, and blessings shower upon the depths. May the nation and its people universally partake in radiant fortune.

Beseeching the Sacred Might, with the same reverence as the petition to the Nine Enclosures, this petition is humbly concluded.

**[Seal]** From the humble petitioner, [Name], of such-and-such rank, respectfully sealed before the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, the Merit Officers, Envoys, Golden Lads, Jade Maidens, Direct Talisman Envoys, and Incense Officials.

To the Venerable Year-Star Deity:

**[Seal]** From the ritual master, [Name], of such-and-such dharma rank and surname.

Now, in accordance with the joint petition of the Three Masters from such-and-such locale, and following the issuance of the salvific decree, all matters concerning the presentation of memorials, the transmission of documents, and the submission of petitions are under the protection and conveyance of the sixty Jiazi Official Lords, who must bear and escort them upward before they may ascend for reception. It is thus necessary to report and make known the following:

The undersigned, [Name], respectfully submits this petition before the Year-Star Official Lord of such-and-such Jiazi year, humbly beseeching the Sacred Might to specially transmit this petition to the entire assembly of the Year-Star and the fifty-nine Official Lords. May they deign to regard and respond to the present affairs of cultivation and service.

Should this pertain to the Yellow Register Fast Altar, and should there be memorials or official documents requiring dispatch, may the responsible Official Lords receive and convey them upward in due time, without delay. Thus may the fast be perfectly accomplished, and the living and the departed alike attain peace and prosperity.

Presuming upon the divine might, with the same reverence as the petition to the Dragon-Tiger Lords, this petition is humbly concluded.

The above is the format for the petition, to be prepared with the year, month, and day, and the name and rank of the petitioner, as outlined in the section on preliminary announcements.

**Memorandum from the Capital City God’s Court of the Numinous Treasure Great Ritual Bureau**
*To the Lord of the Celestial Capital’s Great City God*

Whereas this Bureau has previously received the petition of [Name] of [Place], seeking blessings for the living and deliverance for the departed, and finding the plea irrepressible, has already, on the [Day] of the [Month], issued a preliminary announcement, raising the sacred banner to proclaim the intent of the fast to the heavens:

Now, in accordance with the *Yellow Register Liturgical Texts of the Lower Prime* and the *Ranks of the Numinous Immortals*, a sacred altar shall be established to conduct the fast with utmost reverence. Following the prescribed order, the true ordinances shall be proclaimed, and petitions presented to the Heavenly Officials for salvation. The *Mandates of the Primordial Beginning*, *Golden Registers*, *White Tallies*, *True Talismans of Salvation from Suffering*, *Supreme Registers for Pardon and Ascension to Heaven*, *True Talismans of the Jade Clarity for Deliverance of Shades and Shattering of Hell*, and *Nine Dragon Mandates of the Azure Palace*, along with *Divine Tiger Jade Tallies*, shall be issued.

Thus shall the departed [Name], the souls assembled for deliverance, and all beings of the Ten Directions and Nine Dark Realms—bound spirits and suffering prisoners—be released from eternal night and partake of the merit of the fast.

On the [Day] of the [Month], the fast altar shall be opened, and the departed souls summoned to attend and receive deliverance. Beginning at dawn on the [Day], the main fast and Daoist rites shall commence, spanning three days and nine audiences. On the night of the [Day], an unobstructed *Pure and Impartial Night Fast* shall be held to refine and deliver the six paths, four births, orphaned souls, and lingering shades. On the night of the [Day], through the alchemy of water and fire, the souls of the departed shall be refined, talismans transmitted, precepts conferred, and the *Mandates of the Primordial Beginning*, *Golden Registers*, *White Tallies*, *Talismans of Eternal Life*, and *Registers for Breaking Bonds* issued to ensure their ascent and rebirth. Upon completion, memorials shall be presented to report the merits, and the altar dissolved.

On the night of the [Day], a grand offering shall be made to the Three Realms’ Lofty Perfected, a pure jiao rite for the three hundred and sixty divine ranks, in gratitude for their boundless grace, with the presentation of dragon tablets and memorial tallies. The details of these proceedings shall be fully reported to the Supreme Emperor, beseeching the issuance of imperial decrees, and memorials shall be presented to the Heavenly Thearchs, entreating their sagely edicts. These shall be transmitted to the true bureaus of the Three Realms and all relevant jurisdictions.

The names of the departed souls, along with their dates of birth and death, shall be separately recorded and submitted to the *Heavenly Pivot Court of the Upper Clarity* under the Three Heavens’ Gate, there to await the imperial decree. Upon its issuance, this shall be duly proclaimed.

Wherefore, a special memorandum is hereby issued.

Upon receipt, the aforementioned matters shall be reviewed in detail. Expeditiously issue directives and transmit memoranda to all prefectural, sub-prefectural, and county city gods; temples of the official pantheon; all sites of incense and offerings; and the *She* Lords of the Nine Provinces of Ji, Yan, Qing, Xu, Yang, Jing, Yu, Liang, and Yong, informing them of the conduct of the great fast.

In strict adherence to the imperial decrees and mandates, open the gates and clear the paths. In accordance with the direct talismans, verify the names provided, and permit the departed [Name], the assembled souls for deliverance, and all beings of the six paths, four births, orphaned souls, and lingering shades to proceed to the fast altar, there to await the summons, attend the Perfected, hear the Dharma, and receive deliverance and rebirth. During the rites for the descent of the Imperial Perfected, invite them to the altar to partake of the jiao offerings. Upon completion, report their merits and bestow rewards, thereby repaying their divine service.

The statutes of the Illuminated Perfected are inviolable, and the prohibitions most severe. These commands must be obeyed; no violation shall be tolerated.

**Memorandum from the [Prefecture] City God’s Court of the Numinous Treasure Great Ritual Bureau**
*To the Lord [Marquis/King] of the [Prefecture] City God*

Whereas this Bureau has previously received the memorandum from the Capital City God, and the rites of the altar are now imminent, with the sacred protocols to be reverently proclaimed:

The divine carriage shall be welcomed, and the fast’s rituals conducted. It is requested that divine cavalry be dispatched to expel malevolent influences, prohibit the consumption of meat and pungent foods, restrain orphaned souls, and sever demonic obstructions.

Wherefore, a special memorandum is hereby issued.

Upon receipt, review the matters outlined in the prior memorandum. Expeditiously transmit directives to all county city gods under this prefecture’s jurisdiction, as well as the officially venerated deities, ensuring mutual notification. Assemble the divine troops and arrange for their convergence, that they may personally attend to sweep away defilements and guard the altar. Await the descent of the Supreme Emperor, and enforce the prohibition of meat and pungent foods. Any malevolent forces seeking to cause harm shall be strictly forbidden from doing so.

All requisite implements and ritual objects for the fast and jiao rites shall be entrusted to divine generals for constant protection, preventing theft by evil persons or damage by insects and beasts. Furthermore, in strict adherence to the imperial decrees and mandates, open the gates and clear the paths. In accordance with the direct talismans, verify the names provided, and permit the departed [Name], the assembled souls for deliverance, and all beings of the six paths, four births, orphaned souls, and lingering shades to come before the altar, clearly reporting their presence and awaiting the summons. Lead them to the Supreme Lord to confess their transgressions, partake of the fast’s merit, and ascend according to their karmic fruits.

No obstruction, concealment, or harboring of grudges leading to clandestine harm shall be tolerated. In cases of urgent summons, immediate compliance is required; no violation shall be permitted. Upon the completion of the fast, report their merits and bestow rewards. During the rites for the descent of the Imperial Perfected, they shall partake of the jiao offerings in repayment of divine service.

**Memorandum.**

**Memorandum from the [County] City God’s Court of the Numinous Treasure Great Ritual Bureau**
*To the Lord of the [County] City God*

Whereas this Bureau has previously received the memorandum from the [Prefecture] City God:

Upon receipt, transmit directives to all officially venerated deities under this county’s jurisdiction, as well as to the temples and sites of incense and offerings in towns, villages, and communities, ensuring mutual notification.

[As per the memorandum from the [Prefecture] City God to the *She* Lords of the Nine Provinces.]

**Memorandum from the Numinous Treasure Great Ritual Bureau**
*To the Lord *She* of Ji Province*

Whereas this Bureau has now received the memorandum from the Metropolitan City God of [Prefecture]:

Upon awaiting the promulgation of the imperial edict, we hereby record the requisite names and dispatch the Divine Tiger Envoys of the Straight Talisman, the Pursuers of Souls, to proceed and summon them. This requires a special memorandum.

Upon receipt, you are to examine the aforementioned matters in full detail and notify all within your jurisdiction—every yin realm under your purview within the province’s astrological division—of the present grand jiao rites to be conducted.

In strict compliance with the imperial edict and talismanic mandate, you shall promptly verify and cross-reference the names provided with the Straight Talisman, ensuring the thorough investigation of the deceased, [Name Redacted], and all souls to be delivered in this assembly. Should any be burdened by grave karmic offenses, detained, or yet unreleased from bondage, you are to liberate them forthwith, that they may arrive at the numinous altar and partake in the merit and virtue.

For all within your province’s astrological division—whether souls with or without kin, orphaned spirits, stagnant shades, or all suffering beings of the yin realms—regardless of how recent or distant their passing, their rank or remoteness, you shall gather and assemble them, dispatching them to await the universal summons. Let them all proceed to the altar precincts, where they shall bathe, don fresh garments, and be led to pay homage before the Most High. There, they shall hear the scriptures, listen to the Dharma, repent their transgressions, and eradicate their faults. May they all behold the radiant light and equally partake of the Dharma feast, unobstructed and without hindrance, universally saved and universally delivered.

Thus shall the great compassion of the Heavenly Worthy be made manifest above, and the broad salvific intent of the jiao’s sponsor be fulfilled below. Furthermore, you are to strictly prohibit all incitement to litigation or disturbance. During the stillness of night, no clamor or commotion shall arise, nor shall any harbor enmity or violate the sanctity of the jiao altar, lest they forfeit their karmic merit. The statutes of the Perfected are luminously clear, and their prohibitions carry the gravest weight. You must comply without fail; let there be no willful disobedience.

**Memorandum.**

As per the memorandum received from the City God of [such-and-such] township and prefecture, and in anticipation of the imperial edict’s proclamation, we hereby transcribe the requisite names and dispatch the Divine Tiger Talisman-Bearers and Soul-Summoning Envoys to pursue and retrieve the designated spirits.

Upon receipt of this memorandum, you are to act in accordance with the aforementioned matters and transmit the decree to all prisons under your jurisdiction. *(Note: For Daoist missives, replace "prisons" with "Daoist communities.")* Make known the purpose of the grand jiao ritual now being conducted.

In strict compliance with the imperial edict and talismanic command, urgently and meticulously verify the names provided. Scrutinize the records to identify the deceased, such as [so-and-so], whose souls are to be delivered and commemorated in this assembly.

Should any bear grave karmic offenses and remain confined in their respective prisons *(Note: For Daoist missives, replace "prisons" with "jurisdictions")* without hope of ascension, you are hereby commanded to release them. Entrust them to the custody of the Talisman-Bearers and the divine officials of Mount Tai, that they may attend the jiao altar, await the summons, pay homage to the Perfected, hear the Dharma, and receive deliverance for rebirth.

When the jiao rites reach completion and merit is duly acknowledged, the statutes of the Perfected and their prohibitions shall be strictly enforced, their weight most grave.

The present Bureau, in accordance with the petition of [Name], a resident of [Place], humbly states: For the **solemn offering on behalf of the deceased kin [Name]**, and the **universal deliverance of all departed souls in assembly**, a request is made to conduct the **Supreme Yellow Register Grand Retreat** at [Location], to aid their transcendence.

As the plea cannot be denied, this Bureau, following the **Yellow Register Scriptures and the Codes of the Divine Immortals of the Lower Prime**, has established the sacred altar and initiated the ritual proceedings. Reverently adhering to the prescribed order, the **true codes shall be proclaimed**, memorials presented, and **talismanic decrees issued**. The **sin-laden souls shall be redeemed**, and the **imprisoned spirits liberated**. The retreat shall commence on the [Day] of this month, summoning the **souls to be delivered** to the altar for their salvation.

Beginning at dawn on [Day], the **main retreat and Daoist rites** shall proceed for **three days and nine audiences**. On the night of [Day], the **unobstructed night retreat** shall be universally offered to the **six destinies and four births**, the **lonely souls and stagnant spirits**.

Relying upon your divine might, we beseech your **oversight of the altar proceedings**, **suppressing demonic obstructions**, and **dispelling defiled qi**. **Abstain from pungent and impure offerings**, that the retreat may be perfectly accomplished. This requires your **solemn dispatch**.

Upon receipt of this document, you are to **review the aforementioned matters**. In accordance with the scheduled dates of the ritual, **assemble your divine soldiers, cavalry, and officials**, and **personally attend** to **guard the sacred altar**, **expel lingering corpse qi**, and **prevent the intrusion of pungent impurities**. Should any seek to **cause demonic harm**, **intercept and obstruct them**. Those who defy this shall face **immediate and manifest retribution**, swiftly subdued. **Permit no encroachment**, and ensure the **protection of all ritual implements and ceremonial objects** required for the retreat and jiao. **Assign divine officials** to **continuously safeguard** them, **preventing theft or damage by evil persons, thieves, chickens, dogs, cats, or rats**.

Furthermore, we beseech you to **uphold the decrees and talismanic commands**, facilitating the **deliverance of the souls to be offered for**, as well as the **boundless stagnant spirits**, enabling them to **attend the altar, receive the retreat’s merits**, and **restrain vengeful spirits and karmic adversaries**, preventing them from **arising in enmity or seeking retribution**. When the **burning of scriptures, banners, and spirit-money** takes place, may the **power of the Three Treasures** be invoked to **transform and universally bestow blessings upon all spirits**. Ensure **comprehensive protection**, **safeguard the flames**, and **usher in auspicious fortune**. Upon the conclusion of the rites, **report the merits accomplished**, in gratitude for your divine favor.

**This document is to be duly executed as requested.**
**Respectfully submitted.**

(Five memorials in total)

**Memorial to the Mysterious Heavens for the Dispelling of Defilements**

The **Tai Shang San Wu** Register Disciple of the **Celestial Master’s** [Nth] Administration of [Nth] Qi, [Name], with myriad memorials humbly submits:

Your servant, prostrate and bowing repeatedly, respectfully declares:

In accordance with the **Mysterious Regulations**, and in response to the intent of this Grand Fast for the blessing of the living, your servant, unable to suppress the urgency of the petition, has already, on the [Nth] day of the [Nth] month, issued a **Pre-Announcement**, first raising the **Precious Banner** to make known the purpose of the Fast.

Now, following the **Register of the Lower Prime’s Yellow Register**, the **Rank of Numinous Immortals**, a **Spiritual Altar** is established to solemnly perform the Fast’s rites. Reverently adhering to the prescribed order, the **True Regulations** are proclaimed. Memorials are presented to the **Celestial Officials** for the deliverance of all beings. The **Primordial Mandate of the Yuan Shi**, the **Golden Register and White Tablets**, the **True Talismans of Salvation from Suffering**, the **Tai Shang’s Edict of Absolution for Ascension to Heaven**, the **Jade Purity Talismans for Deliverance of Shades and Shattering of Hell**, the **Nine Dragon Mandates of the Eastern Palace’s Azure Court**, and the **Divine Tiger Jade Tallies** are issued.

May the souls of the deceased [Name], those in assembly for deliverance, and all beings of the **Ten Directions and Nine Dark Realms**—the imprisoned, the suffering, and the wandering—be released from eternal night and receive the merit of this Fast.

On the [Nth] day of the [Nth] month, the **Fast Altar** shall be opened to summon and gather the departed souls for deliverance. Beginning at dawn on the [Nth] day, the **Orthodox Fast** and **Dao Offerings** shall proceed for **three days and nine audiences**. On the [Nth] night, a **universal offering of pure, unimpeded alms-food** shall be set forth, and the **nightly refinement and deliverance** shall extend to the **Six Paths and Four Kinds of Birth**, the **lonely and stagnant souls**. On the [Nth] night, through the **transformation of Water and Fire**, the souls of the delivered shall be refined. They shall receive the **Nine Wondrous Precepts of the True Ones**, the **Primordial Mandate of the Yuan Shi**, the **Golden Register and White Tablets**, the **Talismans of Eternal Life**, the **Registers of Breaking Bonds**, and be safeguarded for **ascension and transcendence**.

Upon completion, a memorial shall be presented to report the merit, and the altar shall be closed and dispersed. On the [Nth] night, a **Pure Offering** shall be reverently prepared for the **High Perfected of the Three Realms**, the **Three Hundred and Sixty Divine Positions**, to repay the vast grace. **Dragon Tablets** shall be cast, and **memorials** presented. Additionally, **offerings of trust-money, rice, plain silk, incense, oil, firewood, charcoal, salt, fermented beans, brushes, ink, and ritual implements** shall be provided.

Your servant humbly requests to present memorials to the **Celestial Officials** for the **deliverance and redemption** of all souls. May the **power of the Dao** be invoked to deliver the departed, as in the **Universal Assembly of Deliverance**. If there are those among the living who receive deliverance, may the merit extend to both the living and the dead.

Your servant deeply fears that the site of the altar’s construction, since the **Ashen Kalpa**, in all four directions and corners, may be tainted by **all manner of defilements and taboos**. The comings and goings of people, the hidden and manifest impurities, the **foul qi** and turbid vapors, may congeal and obstruct, shrouding the **Six Harmonies** in gloom and veiling the **Eight Extents**. This may prevent the **descent of the swift winds** and the **halt of the True Chariots**, hindering the **opening of deliverance** and the **salvation of the dark and light realms**. Without the **compassion of the Dao**, purity and solemnity cannot be achieved.

Your servant now presents this memorial, first to **ascend to the Celestial Pole**, and to extend near and far. May the sincerity of the plea be spread, and the **wisdom and grace** be guided and welcomed. May the **miasma and defilements** be swept away, and the **evil and demonic** purged.

Your servant, though foolish and unworthy, has not fully mastered the teachings. Yet, having long followed the **True Lineage** and early served the **Registers of Governance**, though his name has been **unduly included among the Libationers**, and his office **dares not neglect its duties**, he has pledged devotion and submission. The principle of refusal is untenable.

Respectfully, a **memorial is prostrated and presented**, to be heard by the **Three Heavens**.

May the **Tai Shang, the Boundless Great Dao**, the **Supreme Masters**, and the **Officials of the Upper Palace** deign to consider it with compassion.

Your servant respectfully invokes the **Five Emperors of the Five Directions** and the **Lords of Dispelling All Taboos**, each with **one hundred and twenty officials and generals**, along with the **Washers of Flesh**, to **dispel all taboos and defilements**. The **Jade Maiden Envoys**, with **one hundred and twenty officials and generals**, bearing the **Water of True Essence** and the **Five Harmonies Incense**, shall purify the **Spiritual Altar**. The **unimpeded alms-vessels**, the **offered Fast-food**, the **lamps, candles, incense, and flowers**, and the **wells, stoves, and all within and without** shall be rendered pure. The **thousands of taboos and myriad defilements** shall instantly dissipate.

Further, the **One Thousand Two Hundred Jade Maidens of Immortal Flowers** are invoked, along with the **Nine Phoenix Talismans for Breaking Defilements**, the **Great Generals of Gathering Defilements**, the **Great Generals of Destroying Defilements**, the **Great Generals of Transporting Defilements**, and the **Great Generals of Removing Defilements**, each with **one hundred and twenty officials and generals**. Together with the **Water-Mastering Dragon Envoys of the Five Directions**, each holding the **Water of True Essence**, they shall wash and purify the **Yellow Register Fast Altar**, the **entire household of the Fast’s sponsor [Name]**, the **young and old within and without**, the **officiants at the altar**, the **bearers of the Dharma’s flow**, and all who come and go. Any **taboos or defilements** shall be entirely dissolved, so that each person’s **spirit and mind** may be inwardly nurtured, their **strength of body** preserved, their **focus outwardly harmonized**, their **sincerity refined and communicated**, and the **merit of the Fast** realized, with all affairs free from demonic obstruction. All depends on the **vast grace** to universally bestow purity.

The **Ten Precepts of the Ling Bao**, the **Nine Wondrous Precepts of Dignity and Virtue**, the **Primordial Mandate of the Yuan Shi**, the **Golden Register and White Tablets**, the **Talismans of Eternal Life**, the **True Talismans of Salvation from Suffering**, the **Tai Shang’s Edict of Absolution for Ascension to Heaven**, the **Jade Purity Talismans for Deliverance of Shades and Shattering of Hell**, the **Nine Dragon Mandates of the Eastern Palace’s Azure Court**, the **Divine Tiger Jade Tallies**, the **Dragon Couriers of the Mysterious Capital**, the **Golden Dragon Couriers**, the **Envoys of the Nine Dragon Mandates**, the **Dragon and Tiger Riders of the Three Primes**, the **Divine Tiger Officers of Pursuit and Summoning**, the **Refinement and Deliverance Bureaus**, the **Divine Hosts of the Ling Bao**, and all their **attendant deities** are respectfully invoked to descend as one. They shall **proclaim and transmit the summons**, **guard the Fast Altar**, and **elevate the delivered**, opening the way for the **stagnant souls**. May the **repentance and petitions** be heard, and the **transmissions** unimpeded. May the **hosts of Perfected** look down in favor, and the **ranks of Sages** return to attend. May the **dark and light realms** receive grace, and all **sentient beings** be blessed. The **Celestial Officials, Riders, and Attendants of the Ling Bao**, and all the **divine hosts** invoked shall, upon the dispersal of the altar, be presented with memorials to report their merit, and each shall be petitioned for **promotion and reward** as a token of efficacy.

May the **Tai Shang**, in mercy, distinguish and heed the plea.

Your servant, in humility, relies upon the **Direct Envoys of the Two Officials**, the **Orthodox One Functionaries**, the **Left and Right Envoys**, the **Yin-Yang Spirit Officers**, the **Chariot Officers of the Regulations**, the **Red Talisman Officers**, the **Riders of the Rigorous Winds**, the **Couriers for Memorials**, the **Flying Dragon Riders**, and other officials, **two each**, to proceed.

Further, relying upon the **Divine Escort of the Jia-Shen Day**, the **Sixteen Attendants of the Textual Guardian**, and the **Two Celestial Light Talisman Officers**.

The **Divine Escort Attendants and Talisman Officers**, who alternate with the days and hours, shall follow this precedent as the standard.

Your servant, in reverence, acts on behalf of the **Grand Yellow Register Retreat’s Chief Patron**, universally offering prayers for transformation. The **Grand Yellow Register Retreat’s General Convener**, so-and-so, together with all assembled officials, clerks, and participants—hereafter referred to collectively—prostrate before the **Celestial Officials**, petitioning the **Mysterious Vault of Heaven**.

A **precious scroll for dissolving defilements and dispelling impurities** is hereby presented, to be delivered upward to the **Court of the Supreme Void and Boundless Venerable One**, the **Northern Culmen Palace**, and the **Administrative Bureau of the Celestial Offices**. The Bureau’s rotation follows the days; this serves as the precedent.

Awaiting the report of the petition’s receipt, your servant, so-and-so, with awe and trepidation, bows his head to the ground, kowtows repeatedly, and submits this memorial for consideration.

*[Three lines left blank]*

*[To be inscribed on a full sheet of paper without omissions.]*

To the Most High and Mysterious Origin, the Supreme Three Heavens’ **[missing characters]** Great Dao, the Jade Sovereign Beneath the Golden Gates of Supreme Clarity’s Heavenly Palace:

This memorial is respectfully presented by your subordinate, **[name]**, holding the ritual rank of Memorial-Presenter.

*[Inner envelope]*
Respectfully sealed and humbly submitted to the Palace of the Supreme Void and Venerable One, to the Bureau of the Northern Celestial Palace.

*[Outer envelope]*
Respectfully sealed and humbly submitted to the Gate of the Three Heavens for transmission.

*[By order of the canonical statutes for memorials:]* A memorial must be written without delay of a single day; the Supreme Clarity’s name must be filled in without delay of an hour. Within the memorial, the sacred titles of the Supreme Clarity, as prescribed by the ritual codes, are to be written in fine script at the time of presentation, either three *cun* and six *fen* or five *cun* in length, and placed after the vermilion address. The ritual codes further stipulate that the officiating master should write within a space of two *cun* and four *fen*, but if this proves too cramped, it is permissible to write in fine script in a single line for clarity. This is also recorded in the ritual codes of Heavenly Master Zhang Wanfu. If the memorial can be written in standard script according to the codes, it would be especially excellent. As for the two characters “Your Majesty,” though they are said to be written in fine script, the phrase “Jade Majesty” is a single semantic unit and should not be separated. Writing only the two characters “Your Majesty” in fine script appears somewhat unbalanced. Moreover, neither the *Fivefold Refinement of the Living Corpse Sutra* nor the memorial formats of Zhang and Du prescribe fine script for these two characters. Reason suggests that writing them in a single line of fine script may be acceptable, preserving the intent of reverent solemnity.

**Memorial for the Pardon of Sins in Fengdu**

This memorial is respectfully presented by your subordinate **[name]**, holding the ritual rank of Memorial-Presenter, with awe and trepidation, prostrating and bowing twice to address:

Your subordinate, in accordance with the Mysterious Codes, now refers to the jointly submitted memorial to the Mysterious Vault of Heaven. Following the rites of casting the dragon talisman and presenting the bamboo slips, memorials have already been offered to the Heavenly Thearchs, and petitions have been filed with the true bureaus of the Three Realms, along with all relevant offices. External offerings and ritual implements have been prepared. Your subordinate humbly requests to present this memorial to the Heavenly Officials, beseeching the redemption and deliverance of all souls through the submitted petitions, that the departed may be released from the eternal night.

Your subordinate, having long served the true lineage and been entrusted with the registers of governance, bears the undeserved title of Libationer, yet dares not neglect the duties of transmission. Herewith, the names of the departed souls to be delivered are respectfully listed and submitted with this memorial, extending to the six paths and four births, the lonely souls and lingering spirits, that they may receive the grace of the decree, escape the dark ways, accept the merit of this retreat, and ascend to the Pure Realms.

Your subordinate further considers that the departed **[name]**, the souls listed for deliverance in this assembly, and the ancestors of the retreat’s sponsoring disciples—spanning ten thousand generations—along with imprisoned and suffering spirits, have accumulated transgressions and karmic debts over countless kalpas, bound in retribution and confined in the nether darkness. Without the intercession of this memorial for pardon, they cannot escape the depths of the shadowy realms. Relying entirely on the power of the Dao, may they be granted new life through your boundless compassion.

Your subordinate humbly requests that one True-Descending and Spirit-Summoning Talisman Officer and one True-Descending and Spirit-Summoning Youth be specially dispatched for the departed **[name]** and the souls listed for deliverance in this assembly. Reverently invoking the True Talisman of the Great Ultimate, your subordinate petitions the Eastern Ultimate Azure Palace, the Heaven of Everlasting Joy, the Great Compassionate One, the Perceiver of Cries and Responder to Prayers, the Most High Heavenly Worthy of Salvation through Suffering, to descend the majestic and divine radiance of wisdom, illuminating the ten directions of the cosmos. May the Northern Yin Fengdu, the Nine Dark Prisons, the Heavenly Jails, the Water Prisons, the Torture Chambers of the Nether Bureaus, and all other hells receive this radiance and be instantly illuminated, their iron cities crumbling, their willow bonds dissolving. May the departed **[name]**, the souls listed for deliverance, and the imprisoned suffering spirits be pardoned, beholding the light and escaping the darkness.

Relying upon the Heavenly Worthies and Supreme Sages, and in accordance with the divine ranks of the Yellow Register’s talismanic texts, your subordinate invokes the Flying Heavenly Divine Kings, the True Persons of Salvation through Suffering, the Salvation Youths, and the Azure Mystery Jade Maidens to descend upon the dark prisons. May they sprinkle the precious nectar of sweet dew and descend the Dharma rain of compassion. Through the resonance of majestic power and the efficacy of wisdom, wherever they reach, flames shall be extinguished, and spring shall arise amidst ice and snow. Blades shall transform into jade trees, swords into flowering forests. Bronze pillars and iron beds shall become furnishings of precious thrones; cauldrons of boiling liquid and furnaces of coals shall become lamps of cool clarity. Iron pellets and molten gold shall lose their scorching menace; saws and knives shall blunt their edges. Bronze serpents and iron dogs shall sever their evil affinities. The ox-headed jailers shall awaken to kindness, the demon kings shall bow their heads, and the underworld clerks shall submit in sincerity. The registers of sin shall be erased, the records of karmic debt burned. Enmities shall be reconciled, debts dissolved. All beings of the four births and six paths shall depart the dust of the mundane. Shell-covered creatures and insects shall attain transformation. Those burdened with sand and stone, the souls who draw waves from the dark sea, the spirits who harness thunder and lightning, the gods who encircle the heavens, the ghosts who sweep mountains with wind, the dragons who tunnel earth and channel water—all shall be released from their toils and ascend to the Southern Palace. May they forever escape the Five Sufferings and be far removed from the Three Evil Paths.

Thus, may the departed **[name]**, the souls listed for deliverance in this assembly, and the ancestral spirits of the disciple **[name]**’s family don the celestial regalia, wear the vermilion sashes of office, ride the winds through the azure vaults, and ascend in feathered chariots to the Supreme Clarity. May the cycles of karmic retribution never cease, and may they be reborn in the halls of princes and kings, cultivating myriad virtues. May they attain the fruits of immortality and reach the Land of Bliss. May all be as your subordinate has petitioned, without fail.

Imploring the Most High to distinguish and heed this plea.

Your humble servant, in accordance with the preceding memorial but altering only the direct divine invocation, respectfully submits on behalf of the chief patron **[name]** of the Great Register Fast a petition to the Celestial Officials of Fengdu, the "Precious Memorial for the Establishment of the Dao and the Pardon of Sins," one sealed document, to be presented to the Bureau of the Most High **[name]** Palace.

Following the format of the preceding memorial:
The Jade Calendar records the names in vermilion script, now presented at the Gate of the Proper Memorial. Herewith are listed the names of the departed souls for universal deliverance—revised to read: "Herewith are listed the names of the departed souls for deliverance in this assembly."

**Primary Deliverance:**
**[Name]** (only the name is written)

**Secondary Deliverance:**
**[Name]** (each name listed individually)

Prepared on the **[day]** of this month by the High Ritual Master, the humble servant **[name]**.

For the Jade Calendar: If this is a universal deliverance, omit the distinction between primary and secondary deliverance. Instead, list the names of the departed sequentially, adjusting the number of names per line based on the quantity of souls and the size of the paper, ensuring an odd number of entries per column. Write in neat, standard script, with rows and columns aligned. Place the document within the memorial’s circular seal, enclose it in the second envelope, and dispatch it.

**Memorial for Opening the Roads**

Prepared by the Ritual Master, your humble servant **[name]**, with reverence and awe, kowtowing and bowing twice, respectfully addresses this memorial:

Your servant, in accordance with the Mysterious Regulations, now bases this upon the same memorial for invoking the Celestial Vault, having already presented the Dragon Tablet and Advanced Petitions to the Heavenly Thearchs, and filed them with the True Offices of the Three Realms and their respective jurisdictions. The external offerings and ritual implements have been prepared.

Your servant petitions to present this memorial to the Celestial Officials, beseeching the redemption and deliverance of all petitions, that they may ascend and be saved.

I humbly reflect: From youth, I have admired the Mysterious Wind and early joined the Registers of Governance. Though my name has been presumptuously included among the Libationers, I dare not neglect my duties in submission.

Having already followed the canonical rites and reverently performed the fast, I still fear that the gates of the unseen are distant and the paths of the netherworld remote. The waters and lands are cut off, and the directions are blocked. The departed **[name]**, the souls for deliverance in this assembly, and the suffering spirits confined in the Nine Dark Realms require this memorial of pardon to escape the depths of dense yin. Without the power of the Dao, the passes and fords cannot be opened. May they all reach the altar of the fast and universally receive liberation.

Respectfully, I present this memorial to be heard by the Three Heavens, to dispel impurity and open the Way amid the yellow clouds. May the Four Directions and Six Connections be unobstructed.

I humbly invoke the Direct Envoys of the Most High and the Direct Envoys of the Three Realms, one each, to bear the Talismans of the Most High and the Mandates of the Great Clarity, and proclaim them to the Three Palaces and Nine Bureaus, the One Hundred Twenty Offices, the Five Thearchs’ Examiners and Chief Clerks, the inner and outer palaces and caverns of Fengdu in the Northern Yin, the Five Marchmounts and Nine Dark Realms, the Thirty-Six Prisons of the Four Quarters, the Great Iron Enclosure Mountain and the Avīci Hell, the Springs and Bends of the Yellow River, the Three Primordial Water Palaces, the Five Paths’ Capital, the Earth Lords of the Nine Provinces, the Dao Masters of the Ten Directions, the Mound Sergeants and Tomb Lords, the River Earls and River Marquises, the Elder of the Barrows, the officials of the Two Thousand Stones, the Two August Lords of the Nine Ramparts, the divine officials of the Earth’s Nether Bureaus, the hidden governances of the Grotto-Heavens, the Examiners of the Bureaus, the Chief Officers of Mount Tai, the various hellish offices, the Mountain and Forest Elders, the deities of temples and altars, the great spirits of the Dark and Cold, the **[Year]** Celestial Noble of the Great Year, the City Gods and Earth Lords of the world, the local Earth Gods, the chief officials of the Departments of Good and Evil, the One Hundred Twenty Offices of Divine Officials, the Seventy-Two Forbidden Guardian Generals, the Heavenly Prisons and Earthly Hells, the hidden governances and dark passes, the eternal springs and gates of the netherworld, and all authorities:

Respectfully heed the Mandate of the Most High. Open the passes, unseal the roads, break the locks, and swing wide the gates. Release the departed **[name]**, the souls for deliverance in this assembly, and all beings of the Six Paths and Four Births—lonely souls and lingering spirits—so that they may all proceed to the Mysterious Altar, attend the Three Treasures, receive the transmission of talismans and precepts, hear the Dharma and the scriptures, and attain the fruits of all virtues. May the paths of the unseen be free of peril, and the gates of the netherworld open to carefree passage. When merit is complete and fruit is fulfilled, may they ascend the ranks of immortality. Those who obstruct shall be demoted by the netherworld’s offices.

Imploring the Most High and the Host of Perfected, to distinguish and heed this plea.

Your humble servant, in accordance with the preceding memorial but altering only the direct divine invocation, respectfully submits on behalf of the chief patron **[name]** of the Great Register Fast this "Precious Memorial for Opening the Roads," one document, to be presented to the Bureau of the Most High **[name]** Palace. Following the format of the preceding memorial.

**Memorial for Refining and Bathing**

Prepared by the Ritual Master, your humble servant **[name]**, with reverence and awe, kowtowing and bowing twice, respectfully addresses this memorial:

Your servant, in accordance with the Mysterious Regulations, now bases this upon the same memorial for invoking the Celestial Vault, having already presented the Dragon Tablet and Advanced Petitions, with external offerings and ritual implements prepared.

Your servant petitions to present this memorial to the Celestial Officials, beseeching the power of the Dao to redeem and deliver the departed souls.

I humbly reflect: From youth, I have admired the Mysterious Wind and early joined the Registers of Governance. Though my name has been presumptuously included among the Libationers, I dare not neglect my duties in submission.

I still fear that the departed **[name]**, the souls for deliverance in this assembly, and the beings of the Six Paths and Four Births—lonely souls and lingering spirits—are bound by the grime of past karma and have fallen into evil origins. Unwashed in body and form, they cannot attend the altar. May they be refined and delivered, each attaining transcendence.

Relying on the compassion of the Dao, I humbly beseech liberation.

Respectfully, I invoke the Five Spirits’ Youths of the Five Directions, five each; the Officers and Generals for Dispelling Impurity, one hundred twenty each; the Bathing Ladies; and the Jade Maidens of the Yellow Flower, one each. May they descend at this time and draw the Divine Water of the Yellow Flower, the Refined Corpse’s Pure Essence, the Cloud Nectar and Jade Wine, and the Golden Dew of Sweet Springs, pouring them into the fragrant waters to bathe the aforementioned departed souls and the boundless suffering spirits. May they wash away the shadows of yin, cleanse the dust of toil, sever the roots of karmic debts and grievances, and purify the inner and outer filth of affliction. Then, may the Five Directions’ Youths invoke the True Qi of the Green Spirit of the Eastern Primordial Elder, nourishing them with the Green Essence of the Nine Qi...

May the Southern Vermilion Spirit of the True Elder bestow the True Qi, nourishing them with the Vermilion Essence of the Three Qi; may the Western Radiant Spirit of the August Elder bestow the True Qi, nourishing them with the Pristine Essence of the Seven Qi; may the Northern Fivefold Spirit of the Mystic Elder bestow the True Qi, nourishing them with the Mystic Spring of the Five Qi; may the Central Primordial Spirit of the Primordial Elder bestow the True Qi, nourishing them with the Yellow Essence of the One Qi. Thus may the souls thus offered partake of this nourishing grace, their hun and po securely settled, their five viscera naturally formed.

We further invoke the Vajra’s Hundredfold Refinement, the Jade Nectar of a Thousand Harmonies, the Flowing Radiance of Venus, and the Primordial Emperor’s Scattered Elixir, to dissolve stagnation, purge impurities, refine body and mind, and illumine wisdom with clarity.

We then invoke the Divine Physicians and Celestial Attendants, the Numinous Officials of Healing. The Three and Five Merit Clerks, the Grand Physicians and Masters, the Attendants of Acupuncture and Stone Needles, and the Numinous Officials of Medicinal Application—may they gather the Supreme Five-Colored Divine Medicines and scatter them within the viscera of the departed souls. May they heal the ailments of the constructive and protective qi from their former lives, needle and purge the stagnations of heart and abdomen, and massage the swellings and sores of qi and blood. For those with severed sinews or broken bones, may their forms be restored and life returned; for those with scattered or fallen limbs, may their substance be renewed and their original state recovered. May flesh grow and muscles lengthen, each part made whole; may bones and body be robust and strong, hun and po unclouded. May sorrow and affliction dissolve, hunger and thirst vanish; may knots be untied, obstructions in the primordial womb dispersed. May form and spirit be upright and proper, their countenances dignified and majestic.

We further invoke the True Water and True Fire of the Celestial Primordial, the Master of Refinement of the Southern Prosperity Upper Palace, the Ninefold Radiance Perfected, the Ninefold Radiance Youths, the Fire Mound Numinous Youths, the Jade Maidens of the Eastern Well, the Great Spirits of Refinement and Salvation, the True Lords of the Five Treasuries, the Governing Masters of Refinement, and the Divine Generals and Officials of Refinement and Salvation—may they restore the dead to their bones, reverse form, and deliver life. May all the true hosts, each bearing their ritual implements, descend to the Mystic Altar. On behalf of the deceased so-and-so, and those souls named in the petition for absolution, together with all the male and female souls thus offered, and universally extending to the six paths, four modes of birth, and all wandering and stagnant spirits, may they be abundantly refined. May they follow the subtle and profound, receive this extraordinary grace, and ascend to the Immortal Realms.

With grace and reverence, we beseech the Most High to distinguish and heed our plea. Your humble servant, following the precedent of the previous petition and altering only the presiding deities, respectfully presents on behalf of the deceased so-and-so and others this Precious Petition for Celestial Bathing, Refinement, and Salvation, to be submitted to the Bureau of the Most High.

[Petition for the Salvation of the Departed appended to the Yellow Register on the third day at dusk, presented at the Altar of the Fast and Offering.]

The Petitioner, in awe and trepidation, bows his head to the ground, prostrates himself, and respectfully addresses:

Your servant, in accordance with the Mystic Regulations, now bases this petition upon the previously submitted Celestial Petition, extending to the presentation of the Dragon Tablet and the offering of ritual tokens. Your servant humbly requests to present the Celestial Petitions for Salvation, beseeching the power of the Dao to uplift and deliver the departed souls. Reflecting upon my youthful admiration for the Mystic Wind and early participation in the Registers of Governance, my name has been recklessly included among the Libationers, and my office dare not neglect its duties of transmission and verification. Having already exhorted and led the ritual currents, I have followed the regulations in performing the rites: ninefold repentance and gratitude, and a three-day proclamation of vows. The Ritual Patron so-and-so has exhausted his sincerity and fulfilled the ceremonies, his words and intent reaching all realms, his grace and light universally bestowed upon the Nine Springs. May the souls thus offered be absolved of their transgressions and karmic burdens; may the Dao return them to the Golden Gates, and the scriptures be fittingly placed within the Jade Caskets. May blessings extend to both the living and the dead, and merit accrue to all.

We respectfully invoke the Lords of Destiny of the Southern Prosperity Upper Palace: the Lord of Life Records, the Lord of Longevity Extension, the Lord of Lifespan Augmentation, the Lord of Tribulation Deliverance, and the Lord of Superior Birth, one each, to elevate the souls of the deceased so-and-so thus offered, and those male and female souls named in the Fengdu Petition, universally extending to the six paths, four modes of birth, and all wandering and stagnant spirits, to be reborn in the Southern Palace, their lifespans recorded on Jade Tablets, their names inscribed in Golden Script.

We further invoke the Great Spirit Sima, the Great Spirit of Life Surveillance, the Numinous Matron of the Protective Chamber, and the Youths of the Cavernous Yang, to refine and deliver the deceased so-and-so and the souls thus offered, together with all wandering and stagnant spirits. May they enter the Divine Courtyard of Flowing Fire and the Yellow Flower Precious Pool, their forms purified and substance renewed, their bones restored and life returned. According to the rank of the Vermilion Palace, may they be entrusted to the transformations of humanity and heaven, re-establish their Mystic Merit, and directly attain the Daoist Fruition.

With grace and reverence, we beseech the Most High to distinguish and heed our plea. Your humble servant, following the precedent of the previous precious petition and altering only the presiding deities, respectfully presents on behalf of the deceased so-and-so and others this Precious Petition for Celestial Salvation, to be submitted to the Bureau of the Most High.

[The remainder follows the precedent of the previous petition.]

The resident of [Residence Location], [County], [Prefecture], under the [Provincial Administration Commission], the Grand Ritual Master of the Yellow Register, [Name], humbly petitions on behalf of the deceased kin [Name] and universally offers salvation to all the assembled souls, reverently conducting the Supreme Yellow Register Grand Ritual.

On this day, we present the Precious Petition to the Celestial Bureau, trusting in the true efficacy of the Dao to forward and submit it. We respectfully prepare thirty-six scrolls of the *Most High Dongxuan Lingbao Scripture of Ascending Mystery, Dispelling Disaster, and Protecting Life*, thirty-six portions of gold coin offerings, and thirty-six steeds.

**Regulations on the Format of Memorials**
The decree states: For the method of memorial writing, do not leave the preceding document (*du*) too long—the paper should be convenient for the Supreme Mystery Capital (*Taixuandu*). The following are the rules:

1. The Supreme Mystery Capital’s *Zhengyi Pingqi* (Orthodox Unity’s Balanced *qi*) is addressed by this treatment’s *Zhengyi* minister [Name], who bows twice with reverence.
2. The memorial begins: "Respectfully examining the document, [Name] of [Prefecture, County, Township, Village], male/female, aged [Age], of [Household Name]."
3. "With grace, we beseech the Most High to distinguish and hear our plea. Your humble servant is sincerely awestruck and fearful."
4. Conclude with "I humbly report this" followed by another bow. Leave a one-inch gap below, and for those of lower status, use a separate sheet. The minister’s surname should be written at the top of the line.
5. Align the next sheet with the minister’s surname and the Year Star (*Taisui*) at the top of the line.
6. Align the next sheet with the *Taiqing* forty-eight-character text, written in three-inch characters.
7. Align the next sheet with the Year Star’s day, month, and hour, and present it with a bow in the middle of [Prefecture, Township, Village].
8. Leave three sheets blank afterward. The Three Masters’ spiritual endorsement (*Lingzan*) may be appended on additional paper if fewer than three sheets remain.
9. When ruling the paper for memorials, leave an eight-fen margin. The central ruling should also be divided as a standard.
10. The method for writing memorials must follow the above rules; do not arbitrarily alter the margins or sheet divisions.

The decree states: *Zhengyi* Daoists must observe the above regulations for the dignity and standards of memorial writing. These ten decrees forbid arbitrary changes to margins or sheets, or the creation of new methods that may confuse later learners. Violators who devise their own methods shall be subject to the *Zhengyi* Daoist Five Punishments. The Five Punishments are: labor service in the celestial administration, and the provision of 2,000 bundles of thatch for roofing.

11. The method for writing memorials requires placing a cloth beneath the paper; the paper must not touch the bed.
12. The paper must also be handled properly; do not let clothing brush against the memorial. Exercise caution.
13. When writing memorials, ensure the paper, brush, and inkstone are clean; do not allow contamination or mixed use.
14. When grinding ink, rotate the inkstick leftward forty-nine times and stop.
15. When holding the brush, rotate it left and right seven times each and stop; do not hold the brush tip in the mouth.
16. Do not engage in idle conversation while writing memorials.
17. The water used for writing must be clear and settled.
18. Do not dip the brush in water and drip it onto the inkstone.

18. When writing memorials, keep the mouth closed; do not eat or drink anything.
19. If the body is defiled or unclean, do not write memorials.
20. Select a hand towel to wash the hands, ensuring they are always clean.
21. Do not write corrupted characters. If a character is incomplete or incorrect, cease writing.
22. Do not allow the paper to tear or the brush to leak ink.
23. Do not let the memorial or paper fall to the ground; if it does, do not reuse it.
24. Do not continue writing after consuming meat or unclean food.
25. Do not continue writing while engaged in unclean or improper matters.

It is decreed: The above twenty-five articles are the regulations for writing memorials under the purview of the Office. They must be followed accordingly. Should one act with negligence or disobey these orders, the responsible Daoist priest shall be subject to the three penal statutes. The three penal statutes entail sweeping roads and bridges for thirty days.

26. When writing memorials, attire must be properly arranged; do not expose the body.
27. Approach with reverence, prostrating respectfully; do not squat or sit casually.
28. After completion, read and proofread the memorial once in private.
29. Omitted characters must be corrected using white ink and realgar.
30. Do not write characters carelessly.
31. Do not allow others to secretly read the memorial’s contents.
32. Do not pre-write the date and time of the Supreme Clarity audience; fill it in only when submitting.
33. After the Daoist priest seals the memorial, the host shall don a sash and request the memorial.
34. When the host requests the memorial, perform three bows, three prostrations, and three rises and descents, totaling nine stops.
35. When the host faces the memorial to bow, continue until the submission is complete. Offer personal prayers and express whatever is in the heart—petition for recovery from illness or state the matter at hand.
36. After the Daoist priest completes the submission of the memorial, the host shall express gratitude, bowing and prostrating as when initially requesting it.

The above thirty-six articles are from the *Orthodox Regulations on Writing Memorials*, the second section of the statutes. For all memorials and petitions, first purify oneself through fasting and bathing, wash the hands and face, and arrange one’s attire and cap. Enter the chamber, face the Celestial Gate, set up a seat, and burn incense according to the prescribed form.

The paper for writing memorials should be one foot nine inches in height, or one foot two inches, or one foot four inches as the standard. Use the ancient method of spreading silk on the table for writing.

In the Supreme Capital, the character "Supreme" (泰) should be one character higher than the line above it. Leave eight fen of space above the upper text, and ensure the lower text flows smoothly. Each line should contain seventeen characters, with a line width of one cun and two fen, or two cun and four fen. The first line should conclude with the official title, ending at the "bow twice" (再拜) characters. The upper text occupies its own line. The character "minister" (臣) must not begin a line, nor should "ghost" (鬼) appear at the start. Do not leave living names incomplete or dead names exposed, nor split or break personal names. Each name should occupy one character; even if a name consists of two characters, treat it as one. Characters related to souls, spirits, or the deceased must be avoided at the beginning of lines.

Do not allow outsiders to peek or permit chickens, dogs, or other animals to enter the chamber. While writing the memorial, do not speak to outsiders; hold the breath while writing. Do not set down the brush before completion. When facing the memorial, do not read it aloud in a harsh voice. Do not leave the seat before finishing. Do not let the incense burn out.

When writing "hear and depart" (以闻去), leave one cun of space above, and write "bow again" (再拜). If the text runs long, attach a separate sheet. The essentials of cultivating the Dao follow the same rules.

For *Cai Zhixu’s Rites*, write "report" (以闻) and "inform" (低告) as two characters. Leave three lines blank afterward, then write the minister’s name. Leave another three lines blank, then write the "Supreme Clarity Rank" (太清阶). After three more lines, write the "Great Year" (太岁). The "Great Year" and the minister’s name should be two cun and four fen lower than the upper text. The "Great Year" line should extend to the end of the row based on the number of characters. Leave three more lines blank; if space is insufficient, add another sheet of paper. The "Supreme Clarity Rank" should be tightly aligned.

According to the statutes, the "Supreme Clarity" (太清) consists of forty-eight characters, written in three cun. However, the current "Supreme Clarity Rank" contains fifty-six characters, eight more than the ancient statute. For *Cultivating the Dao’s Essentials*, omit the four characters "Golden Palace Seven Treasures" (金阙七宝), resulting in fifty-two characters, which also differs from the statute. This requires verification.

In the *Red Pine Master’s Calendar*, the fine characters of "Supreme Clarity" ascend three cun and five fen at the top, four cun and five fen in the middle, and five cun at the bottom, not exceeding these measurements. For *Liu Chongjing’s Rites*, write the minister’s name and "Great Year" each in one line of fine regular script. Write the memorial evenly and without delay. Fill in "Your Majesty" (陛下) without delay; the ancient method requires filling in "Supreme Clarity" (太清) without delay. Write the fine titles of "Supreme Clarity" below.

Have the fasting host don a sash and request the memorial. The Dharma Master submits the memorial facing east during the day and north at night.

For vermilion memorials, use even and clean yellow silk, writing in red. The height and measurements follow the same rules as the memorials. Each line should contain twenty-four characters, with a line width of one cun and two fen, or nine fen as the standard.

Those who write memorials must be meticulous. Do not allow characters to fade or crack, nor omit or miswrite them. Do not arbitrarily alter the memorial’s text to suit the fasting intent, ensuring coherence and avoiding breaks.

While writing the memorial, the Divine Officials, Merit Officers, and Twelve Writing Assistants oversee from the left and right. All merits and faults are recorded without omission. The prohibitions and solemnity herein are unparalleled. Exercise utmost care.

**Memorial Seal.**

**Regulations state:** For all memorials, one must first prepare the *xin* offering. If there is no *xin*, the divine spirits will not accept it, and you will be reproached for stinginess and reluctance to part with wealth.

It is further said: If a memorial lacks proper *xin*, the wealthy should increase it, while the poor may reduce it. Those of wealth and nobility, though desiring merit and virtue, cling to their possessions and merely imitate the poor in offering *xin*—such conduct is of no benefit. For impoverished scholars seeking to present memorials or perform *jiao* rites, the master may provide the ritual *xin* on their behalf. Though the old memorials specify different requirements, they generally follow these principles. The Son of Heaven, nobles, and commoners differ in rank, and their *xin* offerings vary accordingly; they must not be confused or treated without distinction.

The regulations further state: The items of *xin* should be distributed to the poor, thereby cultivating hidden virtue. The master must not use them all—only three parts out of ten may be retained. The celestial statutes are strict and severe; one must be cautious.

**Silk and Brocade:**
- The Son of Heaven uses purple silk, measured in *pi*.
- Nobles use silk of their life-destiny color, measured in *zhang*.
- Scholars and commoners use plain silk, measured in *chi*.

**Seal Money:**
- The Son of Heaven uses gold coins.
- Nobles use silver coins.
- Commoners use copper coins.

**Rice for Blessings:**
- The Son of Heaven: three *shi* and six *dou*.
- Nobles: two *shi* and four *dou*.
- Commoners: one *shi* and two *dou*.

**Sealing Oil:**
- The Son of Heaven: one *shi* and two *dou*.
- Nobles: six *dou* and four *sheng*.
- Commoners: two *dou* and four *sheng*, or one *dou* and four *sheng*.

**Incense for *Xin*:**
- The Son of Heaven: one full *jin*.
- Nobles: half a *jin*.
- Commoners: three to five *liang*.

**Brushes, Ink, Paper, and Cinnabar:** These are provided for the scribe to write the memorial. All memorials must be fully equipped with these; none may be temporarily lacking. The rest follows the original regulations.

**Memorial to the Mysterious Heavens:**
- Paper: one hundred sheets.
- Brush, ink, and inkstone: one set each.
- Writing knife: one.
- Gold fish: one.
- Jade geese: a pair.
- Incense: five *liang*.
- Firewood: fifty *jin*.
- Charcoal: fifty *jin*.
- Salt: one *jin*.
- Fermented beans: one *jin*.
- Oil: one *dou* and two *sheng*.
- Rice: one *shi* and two *dou*.
- Coins: one *guan* and two hundred *wen*.
- Clean cloths: two.
- *Mingxin* silk: as many *zhang* and *chi* as required.

For each additional memorial, provide:
- Rice: five *dou*.
- Coins: one *guan* and two hundred *wen*.
- *Mingxin* silk, paper, brush, ink, and inkstone as per the ritual.

**Method for Sealing the Memorial:**
After the memorial is proclaimed, place the writing knife before the Supreme Clarity. Position the gold fish and jade geese to the left and right of the Supreme Clarity. Envision the Divine Officials and Writing Assistants examining the memorial text, along with the new brush, ink, and inkstone placed before them. The High Priest rolls the scroll tightly within the incense smoke, inserts it into the case, and adds *naozi*. Secure it with three knots of green silk, then seal it in the wax pool. Enclose it again in a green paper case, and commit it to the purifying flames.

Vermilion Memorial on Yellow Silk,

Your humble servant [Name], in solemn reverence, bows his head and prostrates himself, kneeling twice to address the Supreme, Boundless, and Utmost Dao—the Perfectly Real and Spontaneously Self-So—beneath the Golden Gates of the Heavenly Palace.

We, unworthy and foolish, have presumptuously partaken in the loftiest rites. Our merits are but specks of dust and dew, while our transgressions pile high as mountains. Overwhelmed with shame, body and soul lose their truth.

With utmost reverence, we bow our heads and prostrate ourselves again.

Truly, though base and insignificant, we have been fortunate to rely upon past blessings, undeservedly encountering the wondrous transformation and gratefully bearing the profound grace of the Mystery. Having been unworthily entrusted with the office of the Perfected, we are duty-bound to deliver and save. Though our nature is dull and blind, we vow to exhaust our sincerest devotion, pursuing the compassionate breeze and embracing the wondrous teachings. Seeing righteousness, we think of courage, day and night keeping it in our hearts. Given the karmic conditions at hand, how dare we not make this known?

Now, from [Place of Origin], there is one who enters the fast with the following intent: having never before undergone purification, they have learned of the Supreme Orthodox Rites of the Yellow Register Grand Fast, which dissolves the bonds of life and death, washes clean the sins of body, heart, mouth, and intent. It augments the imperial destiny above and extends to all living beings below, safeguarding the state and pacifying households, averting calamities and repelling harm.

May the nine generations of ancestors and the seven lineages of forebears be delivered and uplifted, all wandering souls be rescued, and the living be succored—may the radiance of wisdom and grace extend universally. With reverence, we present the golden dragon tokens of the ten directions as pledges of faith, along with life-thread silks, incense, oil, candles, and all requisite offerings for the fast and jiao rites, submitting our petition to the altar. We humbly beseech that at [Location], the Supreme Orthodox Yellow Register Grand Fast be established for three days and nights, culminating in the full dispersal of the three hundred and sixty-part offering of the thanksgiving purification jiao.

All merits thus accrued shall be dedicated to the deliverance of the deceased kin, [Name(s)], and universally to all souls in attendance for deliverance, including those within the household, distant ancestors, and extended kith and kin. May it further extend to the ten directions and nine nether realms, to imprisoned spirits and those burdened by sin, dissolving their karmic fetters and uplifting them to the realm of life. By this extraordinary cause, may it augment the state and family above, bring benefit and peace to all beings, and bestow blessings upon the living.

As the petition is earnest and sincere, we dare not refuse. Having already memorialized the Ten Heavens and pledged before the Three Realms, we now reverently lead the ordained Daoist priests, [Names], in accordance with the sacred protocols of the Lower Prime Yellow Register and the ranks of the numinous immortals. Following the celestial patterns and earthly forms, we establish the sacred altar. With the golden dragons and silken banners presented, we consecrate the ten directions, invoking heaven and earth to save the living and deliver the dead. Together, we exert our utmost devotion, purifying hearts and minds, prostrating in ashes and dust, and surrendering to the Supreme Perfection, that our prayers may be fulfilled.

For three days and nights, through nine dawns of ritual, we proceed in due order, proclaiming the true scriptures. We bow and present memorials to the Celestial Officials for deliverance, reciting the sacred titles of the Most High’s true scriptures. We issue talismanic decrees, absolving the nine nether realms, kindling lamps to perpetuate light, and invoking radiance to shatter the prisons of darkness. Universally, we offer boundless alms, summoning and nourishing the departed souls, guiding them to bathe and ascend the altar, to hear the scriptures and receive the Dharma. We transmit talismans and confer precepts, refining and delivering them to transcendence.

Gathering vast merit, we dedicate it wholly to their deliverance. Commencing on the [Day] of this month and concluding at [Time] on [Day], we reverently perform the rites to dissolve the altar, casting the dragon tablets into mountains and waters. With cinnabar and golden petitions, we memorialize the sacred altar. Prostrate, we present a vermilion memorial on yellow silk, that it may ascend to the Nine Heavens.

We implore the Most High, Boundless Dao, the Primordial Celestial Worthy of Numinous Treasure, the Most High Dao Lord, the Most High Lord Lao, the Most High Elder, and the Supreme Mysterious Elder, the Ten Directions’ Spontaneous Numinous Treasure Celestial Worthies, the perfected and sagely hosts, the most true lords and elders, the Great Emperors and Celestial Emperors, the Celestial Masters, and the Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Center. May they deign to regard our petition with compassion. Should it find favor before the throne, we beseech the pardon of those bound by judgment.

We proclaim to the Five Elder Lords of the Ten Directions, the Perfected Immortals of the Five Peaks, the Three Officials and Nine Bureaus, and the true numina of the Ten Realms: deliver the deceased [Name(s)], the souls in attendance for deliverance, and the household of the fast’s sponsor, including their hundred thousand ancestors across kalpas, all kith and kin through eons, the six paths and four modes of birth, suffering souls and sin-laden spirits—whether bound by affinity or not, whether foe or kin—granting all equal deliverance, that they may escape eternal night. From the nine nether realms, may they ascend to the Southern Palace, donning robes upon withered bones, restoring flesh to bloom. May the wheel of rebirth be exhausted, transforming them to enter the gate of blessings.

May the spirits guarding the land and the forms of the departed return to their original state, uniting with the luminous and the obscure. For the sponsor [Name]’s household, may all sins from past and present lives be swept away, dissolving calamities and dispelling harm. May misfortunes be averted, disasters dispelled, life prolonged, and destiny preserved. May the living and dead flourish, and kinfolk dwell in peace.

Above, may the seven luminaries shine brightly, and the two primal forces endure. May yin and yang harmonize, the five grains yield abundant harvests, the nation prosper, and the people live in peace. May the world attain great tranquility, the imperial destiny be prolonged, plagues and poisons vanish, and auspicious omens daily increase. May we eternally uphold the Dao’s grace, preserving primordial auspiciousness.

We now summon the celestial immortals’ legions, the earthly immortals’ legions, the flying immortals’ legions, the perfected beings’ legions, the divine beings’ legions, the legions of the sun, moon, and stars, the legions of the Nine Palaces and Five Emperors, the legions of the Three Rivers and Four Seas, and the legions of the Five Peaks and Four Waterways—each numbering nine hundred million cavalry. From the Thirty-Two Heavens, we invoke the overseers of the fast, the golden youths attending incense, the jade maidens scattering flowers, the direct emissaries of the Five Emperors, the messengers of proclamations, and the flying dragon couriers.

Within our bodies, we bear the ordained registers of inner and outer true immortals, the officials of the Numinous Treasure, the majestic spirits of the Three Treasures, the couriers of the Mysterious Capital’s golden dragons, the nine dragon messengers, the life-examining youths, the guardian spirits of the Dharma, the dragon-tiger cavalry, the generals of the Three Primes, the refining and deliverance officials of Southern Prosperity, the divine tiger pursuers, the city gods and earth deities, the local territorial deities, and the altar-monitoring deities of the Three Realms—all those who have been invoked to oversee this altar’s incense and flame, whose awe-inspiring power is manifest.

May all those who have been summoned to oversee, protect, and assist, who have diligently served the fast, be arrayed in full regalia. With this memorial, we present them to the Mysterious Capital, that they may be ranked and rewarded according to merit. May they ascend the true palaces, advance in immortal rank, receive titles and imperial appointments, and be enfeoffed according to their grade. May all ranks and degrees be exalted and attained, in accordance with the rites of the Perfected.

We, whose mastery of the Dharma is yet incomplete, may have erred in our bearing or transgressed the protocols, failing to meet the proper forms. We fear being censured by the Four Offices or seized by the Five Emperors. For our thousand faults and ten thousand sins, we beseech pardon and absolution. May our ignorance be met with compassion, and our transgressions go unseen.

Once the rites are complete, may the true officials within our five bodies return to their palaces, that we may study and attain the Dao, seek and achieve immortality, and forever become true persons. May we align with the three luminaries’ brilliance and endure with the five qi. We implore the Most High and all worthies to discern and show mercy.

With utmost reverence, we entrust this memorial to the flying immortal couriers of the Three Officials, the Orthodox Unity functionaries, the left and right official messengers, the yin-yang spirit-decision officers, the chariot-directing talisman couriers, the strong wind couriers, the memorial-delivering couriers, the flying dragon cavalry, and the celestial immortal cavalry—each twenty-four in number.

The officiating minister humbly undertakes the establishment of the Yellow Register Grand Fast for Official So-and-So, having completed the open-air petitions and now dissolving the altar to transfer duties. The celestial ranks are restored, and merits re-illumined. A vermilion memorial on yellow silk, one scroll in length, is respectfully presented to the Most High’s Such-and-Such Bureau, awaiting report and response.

This minister, with trepidation and reverence, prostrates and bows twice to make this known.

[Three blank lines]
Minister [Surname] of [Such-and-Such] Abbey, [Such-and-Such] Prefecture, [Such-and-South] County, engaged in purification through incense and devotion
[Three blank lines]
The Most High, Boundless and Nameless, Primal and Spontaneous, Perfect and True Great Dao, Supreme Heavenly Worthy Beneath the Golden Portals and Jade Towers

As Master Du Yi notes, this sacred title is to be inscribed by the Dharma Master at the time, with each character measuring two *cun* and four *fen*, filling the space entirely. If the space cannot be filled, the characters may be written in a single line in smaller script.
[Three blank lines]
On the [Such-and-Such] day of the [Such-and-Such] month in the [Such-and-Such] year of the reign era, when the Celestial Gate opens at the hour of [Such-and-Such], prostrated and presented at the Mystic Altar within the abbey
[Three blank lines]
The vermilion memorial is to be written on yellow silk measuring one *zhang* and two *chi*, backed with light yellow paper, and cut to a height of one *chi* and two *cun*. Each line shall contain twenty-four characters. If following the ancient method, each line shall be two *cun* and four *fen* in width. Should the text be too lengthy, the number of lines may be adjusted accordingly. As the memorial is termed "yellow silk," raw yellow silk should be used. However, Master Tian notes that raw silk is too soft for outdoor handling, and it is preferable to use thin paper as backing. The sacred title consists of twenty-four characters, with no three-character line—as recorded in the *True and Unified Spontaneous Scripture and Decisions*. For cases where the text may leak, a square box may be used, following the same method as for memorials. The memorial is to be presented without a seal.

**Memorial for Transmutation and Liberation**

The minister of such-and-such rank, [Surname], with trepidation and reverence, prostrates and bows twice.

To the right: This minister humbly pours forth his cinnabar sincerity, beseeching the celestial audience. In accordance with the intent of the fast, and as the stains of the past have never been cleansed, he respectfully requests that on the [Such-and-Such] day of the [Such-and-Such] month, at [Such-and-Such] place, the Supreme Yellow Register Grand Fast be inaugurated, lasting three days and nights before its conclusion. A thanksgiving purification rite shall be performed, with three hundred and sixty divine positions invoked. May the power of the Dao be relied upon to deliver the departed souls below. In accordance with the true statutes, the rites of transmutation and liberation shall be proclaimed and enacted, that the departed may return to form, transform their substance, and receive rebirth through transformation.

This minister, though base and insignificant, has been permitted to partake in the supreme Dharma. Overstepping his station, he presides over salvation, his duty lying in proclamation and transcription. Having received the command to submit, it would be improper to refuse.

With due reverence, this memorial is respectfully presented to the August Ancestral Master, the Northern Pole Purple Tenuity Great Emperor, and the August Ancestral Master, the Southern Pole Longevity Great Emperor—may Their Celestial Compassion deign to bestow Their sagacious decree, issuing proclamations to the Water and Fire Bureaus and the True Lords Governing the Five Marchmounts. May They vouchsafe the descent of the numinous roots of yin and yang, the True Water and True Fire. At this very hour of this very day, may They descend into the altar precincts to refine and deliver the departed, so-and-so and others. May their spirit-souls be clarified and rectified, their myriad qi wholly preserved; may their bodies radiate luminosity, and no demon dare assail them. May their spirits ascend to the Northern Palace, their ranks be conferred in the Southern Court. Humbly relying upon Your awe-inspiring radiance, may You graciously extend Your all-penetrating scrutiny.

This minister prostrates himself in profound submission, awaiting the manifestation of celestial grace. Presumptuously trespassing upon Your divine majesty, this minister is filled with awe and trepidation, kowtowing and knocking his head to the ground—worthy of death.

With due reverence, this memorial is respectfully presented for Your august perusal.

Respectfully submitted.

In the year of such-and-such *jiazi* of the Great Year, on such-and-such month and day, this memorial is presented by the titled minister so-and-so.

[Seal] May be disclosed

To the August Ancestral Master, the Northern Pole Purple Tenuity Great Emperor, and the August Ancestral Master, the Southern Pole Longevity Great Emperor—

This memorial is respectfully sealed and presented by the titled minister so-and-so. [Square Envelope]

A memorial in one sealed envelope is respectfully submitted to the Gate of the Three Heavens for presentation.

The titled minister [Name] respectfully seals it with double reverence.

*Pass-tally for the Day-Duty Merit Clerk*

To the Supreme Yellow Register Grand Fast Altar—

This altar now dispatches one sealed memorial, fully sealed and stamped, to be presented at the Gate of the Three Heavens. A pass-tally is hereby issued for immediate transmission.

To the Merit Clerk and Messenger on duty this day: receive this with clear accountability and proceed without delay.

**Format for Writing Memorials**

For *blue-green memorials*, use only the finest blue-green paper, ensuring no stains, blemishes, or tears. If the paper is thin, affix two sheets back-to-back, each measuring one foot and two inches in height. Only one sheet may be used. The text should span no more than seventeen lines in total, front and back. While lines may be closely spaced, leave half a sheet blank at the end. After the character *wei* (維), begin each line flush with the margin. Leave eight *fen* of space at the top, and allow the text to extend fully to the bottom. The number of characters per line is unrestricted, though precise, small regular script is ideal. Following the invocation of the Sage, the subsequent text must not exceed sixteen sentences. Address the matter directly, ensuring brevity without ornamentation and substance without redundancy. Avoid ostentatious language or excessive embellishment; simplicity is paramount.

The paper for writing memorials must not be allowed to drift onto beds, mats, or the ground, nor should sleeves or clothing brush against the text. When writing, retire to a quiet chamber. The desk should be draped with a fresh cloth, and only vermilion brushes and inkstones—unused for impure purposes—are to be employed. Hold fragrant herbs in the mouth, hold the breath while writing, and take care not to exhale onto the text. If the writing falters, do not set the brush down, nor speak to others. The memorial must be completed in a single sitting; it may not be left unfinished overnight. The character *chen* (臣) must not appear at the start of a line, nor may a person’s name be split across lines.

These are the standards for writing memorials. Even minor deviations may not only fail to reach their destination but also invite misfortune.

The above is excerpted from the *Rituals of the Yellow Altar* by Ren Zhongsheng, which contains many detailed prescriptions, making abbreviation difficult. Adding a few lines is permissible, provided ample blank space remains at the end.

The above merits shall be dedicated to the deliverance of all beings across the six paths and four modes of birth, and all wandering souls and lingering spirits, that each may depart from suffering and together attain rebirth and completion.

To the right, with reverence, we present the profound ritual codes and treasured scriptures of the sacred canon, serving as the bridge for salvation from suffering and the ladder for the deliverance of the departed.

Relying upon these sublime and wondrous means, we dedicate them to the salvation of those lost in delusion.

We earnestly recall the departed kin, [Name], and as in the universal dedication, the names of those sponsored by the assembly leader shall be placed foremost, followed by all the departed souls within this assembly. Having traversed the depths of worldly dust, their souls now dwell in distant realms. Fearing that their karmic conditions remain unfulfilled, their transformation into immortals may yet be delayed. We pray that through the merit of the true teachings, like the gentle seep of water, all consciousness adrift in the sea of suffering may be universally delivered.

Before proclaiming the sacred texts, we first open the jade-bound scriptures. We humbly beseech the all-hearing wisdom of the divine to graciously accept this petition of prior supplication.

Your servant, unable to contain his awe and longing in gazing upon the heavens and yearning for the sagely, prostrates himself in utmost reverence.

Respectfully submitted this memorial for your perusal.

Memorial respectfully presented.
In the year of [Year], on the [Day] of the [Month], your official servant [Name], memorialist.

Presented by [Name], in his official capacity.

Upon reviewing the prior petition from [Village/Place of Origin], wherein the intent to enter the retreat was declared—though yet unpurified—devout offerings of ritual tokens were respectfully presented to the Great Ritual Bureau of the Numinous Treasure. A request is hereby made to select the [Day] of [Month] for the establishment of the Supreme Yellow Register Grand Retreat at [Location], to be held for three days and nights. Upon its completion and dispersal, a thanksgiving purification rite shall be conducted. The intent to re-enter the retreat is again declared, extending blessings to the living. As this servant finds the words too pressing to suppress, having already transcribed the petition for the imperial threshold, he humbly beseeches the venerated masters to memorialize the Ten Heavens and ally the Three Realms. The altar rites are now solemnly prepared, and the ritual seats strictly arrayed. This servant, leading the fellow Daoist priests of the retreat, reverently selects this evening to inaugurate the numinous altar, dividing its light to dispel darkness, arranging the ritual pledges, and unfolding the true scriptures. At dawn on the morrow, the retreat shall commence in earnest. For three days and nine audiences, the ritual codes shall be proclaimed, delivering the suffering from the hidden realms and repenting transgressions. May the radiance of grace be hoped for from above, and the attestation of deliverance be bestowed from below. This petition is respectfully submitted for your perusal.

To the right: The Dao of the Five Elders is revered, born of the same primordial qi; their virtue crowns the Three Powers, nurturing the myriad spirits under their unified governance. They are the object of faith for humans and heavens, the refuge for the living and the dead. In initiating this retreat, how dare we neglect reverent invocation? With utmost respect, we address the Celestial Lords of the Five Directions, the Five Numinous Ones, the Five Elders, and the Five Emperors: you who transform and cultivate all beings, who unfold the myriad perfected. You record meritorious deeds and ever observe the affairs of retreats. May your heavenly compassion widely extend, and your sagely blessings reach afar. Release the five-colored radiance to rescue those languishing in the depths of darkness. May the retreat’s merit be perfectly accomplished, and the names of the living be eternally inscribed upon the Cinnabar Terrace; may the repentance and thanksgiving be heard, and the records of transgressions wholly erased from the Black Registers. Relying upon the gift of your refining grace, may the work of protection and deliverance be fulfilled. May blessings shower upon the state and family, and grace extend to both the hidden and the manifest. This servant’s heart is overwhelmed with awe and longing, prostrate in utmost reverence. Respectfully submitted this memorial for your perusal.

[Sealed again] The undersigned [Name], with utmost reverence, respectfully seals this memorial. The Celestial Master, the undersigned [Name] of such-and-such dharma rank, having examined and collated the preceding memorials together with the Three Officials’ memorials, humbly states:

Rightly do you uphold the Three Heavens’ teaching, spreading the breeze of compassion to succor beings; rightly do you diffuse radiance through the Ten Realms, proclaiming the secret nourishment to deliver humankind.

To the August Presence of the Most High, Auxiliary of the Primordial, Embodying the Dao, Great Sage of the Three Heavens, Supreme Celestial Master of the Great Law, Perfected Lord of Orthodox Unity and Serene Response:

A memorial, enclosed in a square case, is respectfully presented to the August Presence of the Great Celestial Master of the Three Heavens, the Three Masters, and the Perfected Lord of Orthodox Unity and Serene Response. The dharma ranks and names are reverently sealed within.

The Three Masters, bearing their dharma ranks and the surname [so-and-so], having reviewed the preceding:

Rightly we recall that the Primordial’s beginning qi first illumined all transformations; the scriptural masters, register masters, and precept masters expounded the teachings at the dawn of the Three Vehicles. Aspiring to cultivate and serve, we dare not delay our reverent submission.

With utmost reverence, we invoke the August Presences of the Perfected Lords of the Numinous Treasure Scriptural Masters, Numinous Treasure Register Masters, and Numinous Treasure Precept Masters. Your Dao veils the profound mystery, your names are inscribed since high antiquity. Adapting teachings to all directions, you broadly promulgate the statutes of retreats and offerings; responding to beings with flowing efficacy, you manifestly reveal the path of true constancy. Having ordered the yellow altar and completed the rites, we gaze toward the purple portals to present our words.

We humbly pray that the Masters’ enlightened gaze may observe, that the immortals’ sojourns may descend, that they may guide this humble student and bestow the upright qi at the numinous pass; that they may deliver submerged souls and extend auspicious radiance throughout the dharma realm. May grace flow without limit, and blessings moisten without bound.

This servant’s heart is overwhelmed with awe and longing, prostrate in utmost reverence. Respectfully submitted this memorial for your perusal.

Before the sacred presence of the Most Venerable Perfected Lords of the Daoist Canon, Registers, and Salvation, this humble servant, [Name], holder of the dharma rank, respectfully seals this memorial in a square envelope and presents it to the sacred presence of the Most Venerable Perfected Lords of the Daoist Canon, Registers, and Salvation. This humble servant, [Name], holder of the dharma rank, respectfully re-seals it.

We humbly reflect: the Primordial Origin expounded the teachings, widely opening the gate of universal salvation; the Supreme Ultimate established the statutes, manifestly revealing the title of the retreat supervisor. All who undertake devotion and reverence look up to you for verification.

We reverently recall the sacred presence of the Most Venerable Perfected Lord, Great Dharma Master and Supervisor of the Retreat. At the dawn of teaching, you arose at the close of the sorrowful kalpa. You specially transmitted the rites of retreat to bestow grace and succor upon the submerged. We humbly pray that you may condescend to bestow your compassion and specially issue the true decree. Command the officials of the Daoist Canon Bureau and the sacred perfected ones of the Yellow Register Abbey. According to the standards of the divine immortals in the *Simplified Writs of the Lower Prime*, dispatch the flying celestial guardian-transmitting officials. Record the sincerity of the retreat, proclaim and transcribe the words of the memorial. Guide and welcome the radiance of wisdom, open the path to deliver submerged souls. May good fruits be perfectly fulfilled, and all—both hidden and manifest—receive salvation. May grace moisten the present, and blessings extend to the state and its households.

This servant’s heart is overwhelmed with awe and longing, prostrate in utmost reverence. Respectfully submitted this memorial for your perusal.

To the Sacred Presence of the Great Dharma Master and Perfected Lord of the Numinous Treasure Retreat,

**[Envelope Inscription]**
Sealed with reverence, bearing the Dharma rank and name,
A square envelope containing one memorial,
Respectfully presented to the Sacred Presence of the Great Dharma Master and Perfected Lord of the Numinous Treasure Retreat,
Again sealed with reverence, bearing the Dharma rank and name.

**[Memorial for Altar Opening]**
Your servant, [Dharma rank] [surname and given name], with utmost sincerity, prostrates and offers this plea to the boundless Dao.

Previously, in accordance with the memorial to the Five Emperors, this servant invoked the covenant of the Three Realms, reverently following the prescribed order to proclaim and expound the true statutes. Bowing in submission, I presented the sacred writs and issued the talismanic decrees, delivering the sin-laden and opening pardon for the submerged. I burned incense and lit lamps, established the retreat, and performed the Dao. Invoking radiance to shatter the prisons, I universally bestowed the nocturnal retreat. Summoning and gathering the departed souls, I bathed and refined them for deliverance. Transmitting talismans and conferring precepts, I safeguarded and recommended them for transcendence. Upon completion of these rites, I presented a memorial to report the merits, offered the dragon tablets, and submitted the bamboo slips. Solemnly arranging the pure jiao offering, I gave thanks for the vast grace. Broadly accumulating virtuous merit, I collectively aided their ascent and deliverance. Thus, with the altar rites now solemnly prepared, together with the memorial to the Five Emperors, I humbly submit this report.

To the right, with utmost reverence: having meticulously prepared the yellow altar and fulfilled the rites, I dutifully adhered to the protocols of devotion. Gazing toward the purple celestial gates, I present these words, humbly hoping for the grace of your observation. With all sincerity, I reveal the sincerity of this retreat.

Reverently considering the boundless and limitless Great Dao of the Most High, the true and supreme scriptures of the Thirty-Six Divisions, the sacred talismans and true writs, the Three Venerable Ones of the Most High, the sacred assemblies of the ten directions, and the presence of the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center—these unfold the five sections and establish the myriad standards. The soaring mysteries congeal qi, naturally forming the texts of the Empty Cavern; the Lower Prime unites the spirits, thus establishing the ranks of the numinous immortals. They safeguard the kalpas and protect both the hidden and manifest. This unworthy servant, by virtue of the master-disciple bond, has presumptuously transmitted these wondrous teachings. Thus, I have followed the statutes in reverent observance, daring to proclaim and enact them without transgression. I have earnestly exhorted my Dharma disciples to faithfully adhere to the prescribed forms, establishing covenants and pledges to jointly accomplish the merits of the retreat.

I humbly pray that the Three Treasures bear witness and the myriad spirits descend in response. May you incline your radiance and turn your celestial carriage to oversee the deliverance of beings. In the dark realms of earth and water, may the compassion of the Dao open the path to salvation; in the lands illumined by sun and moon, may the power of wisdom shine forth. May blessings universally extend to the state and its households, and grace pervade both the living and the departed.

Your servant, overwhelmed with awe as I gaze toward the heavens and long for the sacred presence, prostrates in utmost reverence. Respectfully submitted this memorial for your perusal.

Memorial respectfully presented.

To the Most Perfect and Supreme Thirty-Six Divisions of the Sacred Scriptures and Precious Talismans of the True Writ,
Before the Supreme and Boundless Dao of the Utmost High,
Before the Three August Ones and the Sacred Hosts of the Ten Directions,
Before the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm,
Your subordinate, [Name], respectfully submits this memorial under seal.

*Square Envelope*
Memorial for the Opening of the Altar, Respectfully Presented to the Three Heavens’ Chancellery.
Your subordinate, [Name], respectfully seals this again.

Memorial to the Divine Officials of the Ten Directions.
The Dharma-ranked [Name] has reviewed the memorial for the return of the Three Officials, which concerns the covenant binding the Three Realms. The present altar rites are now solemnly prepared, and the Dharma assembly is strictly arrayed.

I humbly lead the assembled Daoist priests of this retreat to reverently select this night for the establishment of the sacred altar. Splitting light to dispel darkness, we set forth the pledges of faith and unfold the true writ. At dawn on the morrow, the purification fast shall begin. We shall proclaim the ritual codes and confess transgressions. Herewith, brush, ink, paper, and inkstone are arrayed to secure the Ten Directions. We beseech that our memorial be transcribed and presented, that grace may be bestowed from on high, and deliverance granted to both the living and the departed. This memorial is respectfully submitted for your attention.

It is further humbly stated:
The Brahma-qi suffuses the vastness of the ninefold heavens;
The True Capital stretches boundlessly through the towering realms of the ten poles.
To ensure our sincerity ascends and is heard, we rely upon the sagely grace that descends in aid.

We reverently invoke the boundless worlds of the Ten Directions, the palaces of sun and moon, the sacred lands of scriptures and treasures, the earth and water, and the divine officials of the ten realms of immortals. May this memorial be conveyed before the sacred hosts. The True and Constant respond with goodness; the sagely transformation knows no bounds. Each time they descend to the altar, they serve as the conduit for our words.

We humbly pray that the virtue of boundless compassion be widely extended, and the merit of universal deliverance be broadly bestowed. In offering thanks to the Ten Directions, both far and near, we pray for mutual resonance; in presenting our sincerity through ninefold memorials, all faults and transgressions may be encompassed and concealed.

May it be that our intent ascends to meet the radiance of grace, and below, purification reaches all. The karmic deeds of the conditioned realm shall be elevated into boundless merit. May both the living and the departed universally partake in the blessings of life and transformation.

Your subordinate, with utmost reverence and urgency, respectfully submits this memorial for your perusal.

Respectfully submitted.

To the Divine Assemblies of the Ten Directions, the Transmitting Immortals and Divine Officials—before the Sacred Hosts:

The undersigned, [Name and Rank], respectfully submits this memorial in sealed form.

*Square Envelope*
Memorial submitted to the Divine Assemblies of the Ten Directions, the Transmitting Immortals and Divine Officials—each undersigned, with reverent double seal.

Threefold covenant established for the Supreme Yellow Register Grand Fast.

Now, on behalf of the Grand Fast Master of the Supreme Yellow Register residing in [Village, Prefecture, and Location], [Name], together with the convener of the grand assembly, [Name], and all attending officials, scholars, and commoners, we have prepared offerings of patterned silks from the Ten Directions, golden dragon jade seals, and pledges of sincerity. We invite [number] Daoist masters to the [Temple Name] in [Prefecture and Location], to commence the altar rites on the eve of [Month and Day], conducting the Supreme Yellow Register Grand Fast for three days and nights. Upon its completion, we shall hold a thanksgiving purification rite, encompassing the three hundred and sixty divine ranks.

Our intent is to benefit the state and the household above, and to deliver the deeply afflicted below. To transcend the departed ancestors and safeguard the living. Thus, we turn to the supreme orthodox Dharma—the Supreme Yellow Register Grand Fast. It harmonizes Heaven and stabilizes Earth, protects the state and secures the household. It universally delivers the living and the dead, awakening all to the true Dao.

In accordance with the ancient mystic canons, we emulate Heaven and model Earth, erecting the altar and unfurling the registers. Pledges of sincerity are arrayed in the hall of splendor, while our petitions ascend to the golden gates. Solemn and reverent, we approach as though in the presence of the divine, purifying all with utmost care.

This endeavor depends entirely upon the participants of this fast, who together pledge their covenant, purifying their inner vision. For the essence of fasting lies in fasting the heart: severing the allure of sight, sound, and form; restraining the tongue from flavors and the nose from fragrances. Exhaling to clarify the qi, embracing the spirit in stillness.

Thus, our Supreme Polar Ancestral Master left these regulations: at the outset of the fast, one must first receive the Ten Precepts of solemn deportment. Penalties and statutes are established to ensure mindfulness without transgression, conduct upright in every gesture. Burning the Black Registers, illuminating the Crimson Writs—seven generations of ancestors ascend to Heaven, the Nine Dark Realms are delivered. All sentient beings, without exception, partake in this grace.

Now, the Grand Fast Master [Name] and the assembly, led by [Name], turn to our Dharma gate, taking refuge in the Great Dao. They undertake this fast for the state and the household, delivering the living and the dead, universally bestowing grace upon all beings. Bearing the Dharma’s pledge, they beseech its transmission.

I, lacking immortal virtue, have been unworthily summoned to this task. Truly, I am filled with trepidation and shame, yet cannot decline. I vow to exhaust my sincerity and strive to fulfill my duty.

Today, with all participants of this fast, we jointly swear before the Three Officials and pledge before the Five Emperors, mutually exhorting one another to complete the fast’s merit. Should any violate the precepts, profane the celestial perfected, and refuse correction, we invoke the Three Officials and Five Emperors to subject them to the trials of wind and blade, consigning them eternally to the abyssal chasm.

We respectfully request that each sign their Dharma rank, composing three copies of this covenant. Two shall be presented to the Three Officials and Five Emperors, while one shall remain in the Supreme Mystery Capital for reference.

Respectfully submitted in covenant.

**Memorial for Merit Offerings to [Name] and the Hosts of Three Generations Burdened by Debts of Wealth, Life, Gratitude, and Virtue, Enemies, and Creditors**

Submitted by the sponsor, of the surname [Name].

**General Memorial of Merit Offerings**

The humble official [Name], of [Native Place and Rank], respectfully pours forth his sincere devotion, beseeching the boundless grace of the cosmos.

Your servant humbly submits the intent of this fast and the requisite offerings, presenting them to the Supreme Bureau of the Numinous Treasure Great Dharma.

We earnestly request a Daoist altar to be established at [Location], commencing on [Date], to solemnly conduct the Supreme Yellow Register Great Fast for three days and nights, with the Dao invoked at nine intervals. Following the prescribed order, the true precepts shall be proclaimed. Banners shall be raised to deliver the sin-laden souls. The sacred scriptures and august titles of the Most High shall be recited, and petitions to the Celestial Officials for salvation shall be presented. The altar shall be adorned with written prayers, and the terms of merit shall be recorded. Offerings of trust shall be arrayed, and the true writs shall be displayed. Lamps shall be lit to perpetuate light, summoning radiance to shatter the prisons of the underworld. Talismanic decrees shall be issued to open the pardons of the Nine Dark Realms. The rites of soul-summoning shall be performed, with ablutions and refinement for transcendence. The Pure and Unobstructed Night Fast shall be universally bestowed upon the Nine Springs and Six Paths. Precepts shall be received, talismans transmitted, registers granted, and bonds of debt severed. According to the rites, they shall be elevated and delivered, ensuring liberation and rebirth. Upon completion, a memorial shall be presented to report the merits, and the Dragon Tablet shall be offered with inscribed petitions. On the night of [Date], a solemn Pure Offering shall be prepared for the Three Hundred and Sixty Divine Positions. We shall give thanks for boundless grace, presenting offerings of wine, fruit, incense, and flowers, and burning paper carriages, money, and horses.

All rites and offerings having been duly completed, we humbly rely upon the Dao’s compassion to universally deliver the departed spirits. May this merit ascend to benefit the state and the household, and descend to protect the living.

The following are respectfully recorded and presented, along with the offerings and dedications, including the true scriptures and august titles, itemized as follows:

One: Request the Daoist [Name] to recite [Scripture Name], with each item listed in detail as per the memorial for scripture recitation.

To the right, we humbly state: the jade-sealed sacred texts unfold the transformative power of the Dao’s transcendence; the secret rites of the Jasper Terrace proclaim the merit of deliverance. Looking up, we rely upon the true journey; looking down, we succor the cold and suffering.

We reflect upon the departed [Name] and the ancestors of three generations, who, since their passing, have wandered in realms unknown. Deeply entangled in the dust of the world, who has awakened from the drifting waves of the River of Love? The path to immortality is distant, and none escape the wheel of karmic rebirth. Thus, we establish these extraordinary merits to dedicate to their dark blessings. We hope, by the power of the Three Caverns’ true talismans, to universally open the gates for the souls languishing in the long night of the Nine Dark Realms.

We reverently pray that luminous grace be bestowed, elevating the departed spirits. May the cold courts of the underworld be without exception, and all ascend to the land of bliss; may all sentient beings in the Dharma-realm enter the path of carefree wandering.

Your servant, with utmost reverence and urgency, prostrates himself in prayer, humbly submitting this memorial for your august consideration.

Respectfully memorialized.

**Notice to Constrain Wandering Spirits**
**Supreme Yellow Register Great Vegetarian Altar**

This altar is now established by the honorable [Name] of [Place] to conduct the Supreme Yellow Register Great Vegetarian Ritual, primarily for the deliverance of the deceased kin [Name] and universally for all wandering spirits in attendance, as well as the six paths of rebirth and the four kinds of life—all orphaned souls and stagnant spirits—to ascend to the immortal realms. As the ritual altar is now constructed, the marshals, officers, and deities such as the City God and local earth gods are summoned to guard and protect the altar. The following constraints are hereby decreed:

This notice is to inform all divine officers of the Dharma Courts, celestial marshals, spirit officials, courier deities, divine soldiers, mounted messengers, the City God of this locale, local earth gods, Controller of Destiny, and all attendant guardian deities of the matters herein. Each is to unite in heart and strength to safeguard the altar grounds. Sweep away defilements and impure qi, reverently welcome the divine chariots. Ensure unimpeded communication of prayers and summons. Gather all wandering spirits under the jurisdiction of the yin officials, along with the river-sands of orphaned and stagnant souls, in the vicinity to await the ritual summons. Let them promptly attend the altar to bathe, refine, and be delivered. Let them hear the scriptures and receive the Dharma, accept precepts and transmit talismans. May they clearly comprehend their meritorious deeds and ascend to the pure realms.

Should there be karmic creditors, vengeful foes, or those who, in life, were thieves, malefactors, or oppressors of ritual offerings—those who consume meat, drink alcohol, or violate altar prohibitions—let them be silently restrained and subdued, their retribution made manifest. Ensure the ritual’s merit is perfectly fulfilled and demonic obstacles do not arise. May the state and household receive blessings, and both the living and the dead be delivered. Upon completion, report merits for promotion and reward, in gratitude for divine favor.

This notice is hereby proclaimed for all to know and abide.

**Proclamation to Admonish Wandering Spirits**
**Supreme Yellow Register Great Vegetarian Altar**

This altar, on behalf of the sponsor of the Yellow Register Great Ritual, the honorable [Name], has erected the Supreme Yellow Register Great Vegetarian Ritual. On the night of the ___ day of this month, an unbounded measure of food will be offered in the nighttime ritual.

All spirits summoned to the Dharma assembly—those of the six paths and four kinds of life, the nine provinces and ten classes, the river-sands of stagnant souls, and the suffering spirits of the dark night—whether male or female, old or young, must consider this: there may be creditors from past lives, ancient grudges, debts of life, wealth, kindness, or virtue. At this juncture, evil thoughts may suddenly arise. Instead of seeking liberation, they may harbor thoughts of revenge. Such intentions will prevent transcendence and perpetuate the cycle of rebirth. Therefore, the following constraints are decreed:

This notice is to admonish all spirits summoned to the Dharma assembly—those of the five directions and five clans, civil and martial, scholars and Daoist adepts, lay devotees and monastics, female Daoists and nuns, farmers and scribes, soldiers and officers, merchants and artisans, diviners and shamans, servants and physicians, the orphaned and widowed, those who died unjustly or violently, executed rebels, the unfilial struck by lightning, the deformed and disabled, the blind and deaf, those who died in childbirth or infancy, creditors and debtors, those who perished in grass or ruins, spirits of ancient altars and abandoned shrines—whether male or female, old or young, all orphaned souls, stagnant spirits, prisoners of the long night, and divine or ghostly multitudes without refuge or master.

Each must restrain body and spirit, listen to the scriptures and the Dharma. Assemble in order and partake of the offerings. Do not bully the weak, nor rely on strength to intimidate the timid. Let all be sated, and fairness prevail. Wash and purify body and mind, follow the true Dao. Reconcile with foes, repent of transgressions. Through the merit of these teachings and the fruits of this deliverance, together seek liberation and aspire to rebirth. Do not linger in delusion or cling to the ghostly realm. Be reverent and await transcendence. The covenants of the Perfected and the ritual codes carry the gravest prohibitions. All must comply and not violate them.

Thus proclaimed.
On the ___ day of the ___ month of the ___ year.

**Proclamation to Instruct Wandering Spirits**
**Supreme Yellow Register Great Vegetarian Altar**

Previously, this altar received a petition from the honorable [Name], who sought to conduct the Supreme Yellow Register Great Vegetarian Ritual to deliver the deceased kin [Name] and universally deliver all wandering spirits in attendance. All spirits now summoned to the altar for deliverance have already purified body and spirit and paid homage at the altar. Daily, they are guided in timely rituals to venerate the sagely Perfected, reverently listen to the Dharma, and await deliverance. The following further admonitions are hereby decreed:

This notice specially commissions the altar supervisors, courier deities of the Dharma Courts, and spirit marshals to constantly exhort the summoned spirits—those delivered at the altar and those bound by karmic enmity—to each generate good thoughts, abandon evil affinities, restrain body and mind, and take refuge in the Dao’s fruits. Recognize past lives and cease forming grudges. Know that the nature received at birth is inherently pure. Yet, deluded by sensory conditions, false passions arise. Clinging to these evil roots creates obstacles and afflictions. When qi withers and spirit departs, the original state is difficult to restore. The five hindrances entangle, and the three paths exact retribution. Forever sunk in the dark night, fallen into evil origins, drowned in delusive waves, unable to escape.

Such suffering has already been endured in the past. Now, standing before the Dao, seek the Dharma of liberation. Sever inverted thoughts. Arouse faith and turn toward the heart. Reflect on the original nature. Ultimately, emptiness reveals the true, and the actual nature of sin and obstacles is also empty. Thus, the wondrous function appears before you, and the numinous light remains undimmed. Roam freely and at ease, forever freed from the cycle of rebirth.

Reverently await the altar’s timely guidance. Venerate the sagely Perfected, repent of transgressions. Receive precepts and talismans to rely upon for deliverance. Do not leave the spirit assembly without summons, nor depart at improper times. The codes of the Perfected are clear, and the prohibitions are most severe. All must comply and not violate them.

Thus proclaimed.
On the ___ day of the ___ month of the ___ year.

**Gate of Ritual Completion and Memorial of Thanksgiving**
**Memorial on Three Jade Tablets**

Your subject, [Name], of [Rank], humbly prostrates himself, baring his sincerest devotion to ascend to the celestial hearing. Retiring in reflection, he acknowledges his presumption and awaits reproof or punishment.

Formerly, a certain person of [Village and Prefecture], [Name], petitioned on behalf of the recently deceased [Name of Deceased] and all the departed souls of the assembly, beseeching that at a certain temple or abbey, the **Supreme Yellow Register Grand Fast** be solemnly performed, memorials and petitions be presented, and talismanic commands be proclaimed. Reverently imploring the outpouring of grace, he sought universal deliverance for those sunk in the nether realms.

Your subject, accordingly, commenced the establishment of the sacred fast on the [Day] of [Month], concluding it on the [Day] of [Month]. In strict observance of the ritual codes, he proceeded to:

- At a certain grotto-heaven, present the **Golden Dragon Jade Tablet** to the Celestial Officials of the sacred mountains and grotto-palaces;
- At the site of the established fast altar, present the **Golden Dragon Jade Tablet** to the Earthly Officials of the terrestrial bureaus;
- At a certain deep pool or grotto, present the **Golden Dragon Jade Tablet** to the Water Officials of the aquatic palaces.

Thus were the names of the deceased [Name] and all the departed souls of the assembly expunged from the ledgers of transgression.

Your subject now humbly submits this memorial, flying it to the **Threefold Realm of the Golden Portals** and the **Seven-Jewel Jade August One**. Reverently awaiting the Dao’s compassion, he prays that Your August Majesty may deign to approve his petition, issue a special edict, and command the **Supreme Dark Capital Ministry** to proclaim it to:

- The **Heavenly Official Who Bestows Blessings of the Upper Prime**, all celestial bureaus, and the lords of the grotto-heavens;
- The **Earthly Official Who Pardons Sins of the Middle Prime**, the Five Marchmounts and Ten Palaces, the **Nine Nether Prisons**, the **Nine Mounds’ Earthly Sovereigns**, and all terrestrial spirit-officials in charge;

**Attached Note:**

**Memorial Requesting the Issuance of an Imperial Decree via the Three Officials’ Golden Dragon Jade Tablets**

**Attached Note:**
Requesting the transmission of the decree to the Supreme Mystery Capital Province.

According to the old ritual protocols, separate memorials were submitted for the **Mountain Tablet**, **Earth Tablet**, and **Water Tablet**. The phrases *"resolving grievances"* and *"increasing merit"* were used only in the Mountain Tablet memorial, while *"severing the roots of the Three Evil Realms"* and *"cutting off the bonds of the underworld"* were employed in both the Water and Earth Tablet memorials. Now, combining them into a single memorial not only simplifies the procedure but also avoids redundancy.

As for the timing of submitting the three tablets, it shall follow the old method. Within the memorials, if the location is referred to as a *"Cave Heaven"* but is not in fact a Cave Heaven, it should not be called such; instead, it may be termed a *"Mountain Grotto Abode."*

**Sealed Memorial:**
A single sealed memorial is respectfully submitted to the **Three Heavenly Gates**, to be presented to the **Supreme Clarity Heavenly Pivot Institute.**

**Submitted by:**
[Rank and Name], with reverence, in double-sealed form.

Daring to offend the sagely majesty, [Name] is filled with utmost awe and trepidation.

Respectfully submitted for consideration.

The **Earth Official**, [Name], in humble office, having previously received the memorial from the **Heavenly Official**, respectfully complies with the ritual statutes and establishes the altar site at [Location].

Had the Orthodox Daoist Rites of Heavenly Mind not been performed, the generals and troops assisting the ritual would not have been required. Yet all remained at the altar, diligently fulfilling their duties.

This office has already submitted a vermilion memorial to memorialize the Three Heavens, beseeching the issuance of an imperial mandate for implementation, and has also submitted a memorial to the bureaus of the Three Officials Great Emperors for formal assessment, merit calculation, and reward distribution. It is now necessary to report as follows:

The aforementioned generals and officers, aside from the two great generals and elite troops originally assigned to this institute, are not practitioners of the Orthodox Daoist Rites of Heavenly Mind. [Omitting nineteen characters: "The generals and officers who came to the institute aside from..."] The previously petitioned and dispatched guardian deities, divine generals, officers, and soldiers of the numinous altar have now arrived as reported.

Respectfully submitted to the Most August Heavenly Thearch of the Eastern Marchmount, the Benevolent and Sagely Emperor of Celestial Equality.

We humbly beseech Your August Command to direct the subordinate bureaus to retain and manage them as before, keeping them in service and awaiting further instructions from the Celestial Court.

Respectfully submitted for Your August Perusal.

On the ___ day of the ___ month of the ___ year, the ritual master of such-and-such rank and surname [Name] respectfully submits this document. The sealed envelope follows the standard format. The document for the City God’s return to his shrine and the document for the altar-monitoring deities’ return to their shrines follow the same format.

**Section on Offering Prayers and Presenting Offerings in the Jiao Ritual**

**On the Proper Order of the Sacred Ancestor’s Position**

As recorded in *Cloudy Peaks Random Jottings* by Zhao Yanwei: In the fourth month of the first year of Jingyou (1034), Emperor Renzong addressed his chief ministers, saying, "In recent years, yin and yang have fallen out of harmony, and the hexagrams’ qi have deviated from their proper course. This must be due to some failure in aligning with the Dao of Heaven, some dissonance with the Heavenly Will, or some contravention of human sentiment. We must thoroughly investigate the root of this fault and its signs."

His ministers submitted a memorial, stating: "In former years, Chen Pengnian and others established the protocols for jiao rituals both within and beyond the capital. At that time, the **Celestial Worthy of the Sacred Ancestor** was placed above the **North Culmen Emperor**. However, the **North Culmen Great Emperor** governs all things and presides over the Central Ultimate. The **Sacred Ancestor, Controller of Destinies**, was hastily elevated with an exalted title, thereby occupying a position above the **Purple Tenuity Emperor**. Since this arrangement was improper, disasters and calamities have frequently befallen prefectures and counties throughout the realm. We humbly beseech that the matter be reexamined and the proper order reestablished."

The Ritual Institute, having deliberated in detail, together with the Daoist clergy, examined the Daoist abbeys throughout the realm. Whenever jiao rituals are conducted, offerings are presented at the **Sacred Ancestor Hall**. The **Celestial Worthy of the Sacred Ancestor** and the six attendant transcendents do not interfere with the assembly of all perfected beings, and separate green petitions are submitted in address. Where no **Sacred Ancestor Hall** exists, a separate altar for the jiao ritual is established for convenience. Daoist priests wish to intermingle the **Sacred Ancestor** among the other perfected beings to lend greater weight to their teachings and restore coherence. Since the crossing of the Yangzi, when the court conducts jiao rituals, it has followed this practice.

I, Shuyu, privately consider that the sacrifices to the **Sacred Ancestor** in our dynasty and in the Tang are akin to the sacrifices to the **Emperors of Engendering Influence**. The **Emperors of Engendering Influence** originate from the Confucian scholars, while the **Sacred Ancestor** arises from the fangshi. Their contrivance is one and the same. The **Emperors of Engendering Influence** are one of the Five Celestial Emperors. Those who rule all under Heaven do so by virtue of the Five Powers’ mandate, and their ancestors are said to have been engendered by the virtue of a particular emperor, hence, apart from the seasonal sacrifices at the Welcoming of Qi, a separate altar is established for their special veneration. The **Sacred Ancestor** is one of the perfected beings among the Celestial Emperors. The Tang, claiming the Li clan descended from Laozi, thus revered Laozi as their ancestor. Our dynasty, claiming the Zhao clan descended from the Yellow Emperor, thus revered the Yellow Emperor as their ancestor, bestowing upon him an exalted title and constructing the **Palace of Radiant Spirits** to honor him. In the **Abbeys of Celestial Felicity** throughout the prefectures and commanderies, **Sacred Ancestor Halls** are universally established, and their rites are most solemn.

The Ritual Institute of Jingyou era, having deliberated on the Daoist abbeys throughout the realm, determined that whenever jiao rituals are conducted, offerings are presented solely at the **Sacred Ancestor Hall**, without intermingling with the assembly of all perfected beings, thereby honoring the origin of their ancestral line. When officials of prefectures and counties, acting for the state and the people, perform prayers and exorcisms, and jiao rituals are conducted, they may invite the **Sacred Ancestor** to attend, though this already verges on presumption. For the households of ministers and commoners, such presumption is even less appropriate.

In the discourse on jiao rituals, offerings with reciprocation are called *xian*, while those without reciprocation are called *jiao*. *Jiao* involves the use of wine at the altar to reverently complete the rite. Inviting the perfected to descend and manifest their numinous presence, and naming it *jiao*, may derive from the ancient practice of using wine at the altar. Since the transmission of jiao methods by the Celestial Master of Han, they have been employed to bless all beings. Among the texts now found in the Daoist Canon, their categories are particularly numerous. Master Du Guangcheng revised and established the *Jiao Rituals of the Yellow Register for Scattered Altars*, defining sacrifices involving animals and blood as *ji*, and those with vegetables, fruits, and refined offerings as *jiao*. *Jiao* is thus an alternate name for *ji*.

Within the *River Chart* and the classifications of the Three Caverns, there are forty-two ranks in total, all with the **Most High** as their sovereign and the **Northern Dipper** as their principal. If the ritual implements are refined and abundant, and the heart is sincere with wholehearted devotion, what blessing will not descend, what calamity will not be dispelled? Though their names and ranks differ, their ritual forms are alike.

After the rites of *Purification*, *Reverence to the Master*, and the *Guardian Spirit Incantation*, the ritual proceeds to *Kindling the Brazier and Inviting the Deities*. First, incense is offered; then the petition is read, followed by a second offering; next, the paper money is presented and the petition burned; and finally, a third offering is made to *Send Off the Deities and Seal the Brazier*. The positions are few, so the rites are focused; the forms are simple, so the sincerity is complete.

The altar is arranged with seats, and tea, fruit, wine, and food are set out according to one’s means—whether lavish or modest. The most elaborate may include one hundred twenty cups and plates; lesser arrangements may have seventy-two, sixty-four, forty-two, thirty-six, or twenty-four. According to the *Precepts of the Ritual Codes*, all food, cakes, and fruits required for a *jiao* must follow the same rules as for a *zhai*. If purchased, one must not haggle over price, nor use goods obtained through usurpation, theft, or illicit means. Lamps must be fueled with pure, fragrant oil, never with wealth of questionable origin or substances tainted by impurity or meat. The emphasis on substance over form is thus evident.

Never has it been heard of to erect placards, conduct a *Universal Jiao* for the Three Realms, or conflate celestial and terrestrial deities into a single altar. The *Universal Jiao* likely arose from the misguided notion of *Extending Longevity and Dispelling Evil* during the *Shuntian Xingguo* era, a corruption of proper altar standards. The *Yellow Register Rituals of Zhang Qingdu* does not include a *Thanksgiving Jiao*. Only in the rituals of Du Guangcheng does it first appear, serving to summon and command spirits, guard the altar, transmit petitions, and acknowledge the labor of those who come and go. Thus, to express gratitude, this *jiao* feast is set, offering rewards. However, it is confined to the outer altar, where mats are spread with green cloth and crimson seats, arrayed with fruits and delicacies.

For the *Three Treasures* and *Primordial Masters*, offerings include fragrant tea, ginseng, and *fuling* decoction. For the *Three Officials*, *Five Emperors*, and their generals and officers, tea and wine are presented in cups, with the number matching the plates. For the *Nine Ancestors*, *Earth Gods*, and *Daily Attendants*, silver coins are used. After the ritual, these are burned according to their respective positions.

The positions for the *Descending Perfected Jiao* begin with the *Jade Capital*, *Mystic Capital*, *Purple Tenuity Upper Palace*, the *Ten Directions’ Great Sage Assemblies*, the *Perfected Lords and Venerable Ones*, and the *Flying Immortals and Jade Lads and Maidens*. Next come the *Celestial and Terrestrial Spirit Immortals*, the *Great Saints of the Myriad Heavens*, the *Lords of the Sun and Moon*, and the *Perfected and Immortals with their Jade Lads and Maidens*. Then follow the *North Culmen*, the *Great Emperor of the Heavenly Sovereign*, the *Seven Primes of the Northern Dipper*, the *Six Stars of the Southern Dipper*, the *Three Terraces and Five Stars*, the *Twenty-Eight Constellations*, the *Divisions of the Circumpolar Heavens*, and the *Divine Soldiers and Cavalry of the Stellar Deities*.

Next are the *Lords of the Five Directions and Five Emperors*, the *Perfected of the Five Emperors*, and their *Jade Lads, Maidens, Soldiers, and Cavalry*. Then the *Three Officials and Three Primes*, the *Three Palaces and Nine Bureaus*, the *One Hundred Twenty Offices*, the *Perfected Gods of the Five Peaks*, the *Transformative Lords of the Grotto-Heavens*, the *Eternal Emperors of Rivers and Seas*, the *Twelve River Source Immortals*, the *Perfected of the Nine Palaces*, the *Life-Mandating Officers of the Nine Heavens*, the *Venerable Ones of the Five Peaks*, the *Messengers of the Nine Heavens*, the *Deputies and Rightful Officers*, the *Assisting Deities of Destiny*, and the *Divine Soldiers and Cavalry of Heaven and Earth*.

Next are the *Perfected Officials of the Three Caverns and Four Supplements*, the *Immortal Dukes, Earls, Ministers, and Great Officers*, the *Censors of the Nine Heavens*, the *Mystic Masters and Celestial Masters*, the *Lineage Masters and Precept Masters*, the *Three Ancient Masters*, and the *Officials of the Scriptures and Registers of the Three Treasures*. Then the *Officials of the Numinous Treasure*, the *Supervising Immortals of the Fast*, the *Attending Perfected of the Altar*, the *Incense-Offering Generals and Officers*, the *Jade Lads and Maidens*, the *Officials and Generals of the Six Jia*, the *Jade Maidens of the Six Xun*, and all the *Spiritual Offices of the Altars and Sacrificial Lands*.

Next are the *Envoys of the Three and Five Merit Officers of the Body’s Armor*, the *Jade Lads and Maidens*, the *Direct Attendants and Incense Officials*, the *Executive and Transformative Officers of Yin and Yang*, the *Merit Officers for Dispelling Disasters and Dissolving Calamities*, and the *Relieving Lords and Officers*. Then the *Twenty-Four Treat Generals of the Body’s Armor*, the *Four Divisions’ Merit-Inspecting Heralds and Immortal Envoys*, the *Three Divisions’ Merit Officers for Healing Illnesses and Hastening Qi* of the *Orthodox Unity*.

Next are the *Yin-Yang Spirit Envoys*, the *Red Talismans of the Ritual Chariot*, the *Cavalry of the Vajra Winds*, the *Post Horses for Memorials*, the *Flying Dragons and Celestial Immortals*, the *Flying Immortal Cavalry*, the *Upper and Middle Departments’ Envoys*, the *Capital Officials and Messengers*, the *Wolf Officers and Tiger Guards*, the *Inspectors of Deceit and Hook Cavalry*, the *Capital Commanders and Archers*, the *Celestial Ding Soldiers*, the *Celestial Couriers and Armored Troops*, and those who *Capture and Consume Qi of Ghosts and Demons*, the *Cavalry for Destroying Talismans and Demolishing Temples*, and the like.

Finally, the *Original Constellations of the Disciples*, the *Greater and Lesser Years of Fate*, the *Life Stars*, and the *Post Horse Generals and Officers*. In total, the deities invoked at the *jiao* feast number thirteen categories. The *Earth Gods of the Local Domain* descend to the western seats. Though the cups and plates are limited, the Perfected and Spirits who descend are boundless. This is because the *August Heaven and Earth* are nourished by utmost sincerity, not by the quantity of offerings.

In the *Yellow Register Fast and Jiao Rituals* of Cai Zhixu, though three hundred sixty positions are set, many deities are grouped together. Apart from the *Imperial Position*, which uses a dedicated petition, the rest are arranged by category, with a single collective memorial for offerings and send-offs—an approach that seems to recognize this principle. In the *Great Fast Ritual Standards of the Yellow Register* by Lu Shizhong, one hundred twenty main seats are arranged, with forty *Netherworld Officials* placed outside. Each position receives one invitation and one offering, making the rites complete. Yet to claim that this alone suffices to move the spirits would be mistaken. For the Dao gathers in emptiness. If our hearts are empty, they merge with the Dao. With fasting, purification, and bathing, even a simple cup of wine may be offered to a thousand Perfected. But if one remains entangled in outward forms, there will always be constraints and obstructions. As ornamentation grows ever more elaborate, the ancient essence fades.

In current practice, many of the positions invoked in *jiao* rituals have no connection to the *zhai* method. With time pressing, the writing is hasty and imprecise. The Ritual Masters have no chance to review it all, leaving everything to the scribes. How can errors and omissions be avoided? Where then lies true reverence? To prune the superfluous and return to the ancient methods depends on the wisdom of great craftsmen to restore them. As Master Tian’s *Fast Rituals* states: “The *jiao* is not recorded in ancient rites.” Only Master Tang Ruoshan of the Tang dynasty included it.

Should one seek to follow the ancients, one ought to adhere to the old methods of the Jin and Tang dynasties. Yet the *xie’en* rites and *jiao* offerings have long been preserved by Liu Chong and Jing Gu, and these we dare not abandon. Their forms are set forth below.

For the **Grand Yellow Register Retreat** presided over by **Patron [Name]**, primarily to universally deliver the departed soul of **[Name]**, along with all assembled spirits, a **Supreme Yellow Register Retreat** has been solemnly established.

Previously, for the same **Day-Officer of Merit**, in preparation for the offering of profound gratitude, it was necessary to record and submit memoranda, invoking the **Celestial Thearchs and August Worthies of the Three Realms**, the **Presiding Deities of the Ritual**, and all **Numinous Powers**. Having already submitted separate memorials for each, the following items are now specified, requiring the might of the divine and urgent conveyance:

This memorandum is hereby issued to the **Year-Officer of Merit**, the **Month-Officer of Merit**, the **Day-Officer of Merit**, the **Hour-Officer of Merit**, the **Upper Realm’s Direct Courier**, the **Middle Realm’s Direct Courier**, and the **Lower Realm’s Direct Courier**.

Issued this [X] day of the [X] month.

Three Green Petitions, as follows:

The *Nine Heavens’ Life-Securing and Destiny-Protecting Purification Rites* of Emperor Wuzong of Tang

On the fourteenth day of the tenth month, the first day of which is *yihai*, in the year *yichou* of the *Huichang* era (Year 5), the Benevolent, Sacred, Civil, and Martial Emperor—who Upholds Heaven, Achieves Success, Manifests Divine Virtue, Illuminates the Dao, and Embodies Great Filial Piety—[Name], your humble servant, bows his head in reverence and prostrates himself twice, devoutly invoking and addressing the Most Perfect and Boundless Great Dao, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of Original Commencement; the Jade Dawn Lord of the Great Dao of the Supreme; the Great Sage Ancestor, Supreme and Lofty Great Dao, Golden Portal, Mysterious Origin, Heavenly August Emperor, and Supreme Lord Lao; the Three Treasures’ Venerable Deities—the Heavenly Treasure Lord of the Great Existence of the Jade Clarity, the Numinous Treasure Lord of the Mysterious Wonder of the High Clarity, and the Divine Treasure Lord of the Supreme Ultimate of the Grand Clarity; the Venerable Elder of the Three Treasures; the Nine Heavenly August Emperor of the Purple Tenuity of the Dark Capital; the Four Heavenly Lords of the Eastern Florescence, Southern Culmen, Western Numinosity, and Northern Perfection; the Thirty-Six Heavenly Emperors; the Thirty-Two Heavenly Lords; the Ten Directions’ Numinous Treasure, Most Ultimate Heavenly Worthies; the Five Elder Thearchs and Three Radiance Lords; the Three Primordials’ Host of Virtuous Sages; the Heavenly Master Lord of the Supreme Ultimate Heavenly Emperor; the Illuminated August Dao Lord of the Most Ultimate Primordial Cavern; the Thirty-Six Divisions’ Venerable Scriptures; the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center; the Host of the Three Luminaries’ Sages; the Eight Sceneries’ Numinous Lords; the Thirty-Six Earths’ and Sacred Peaks’ and Watercourses’ Rightful Deities; the Rivers, Seas, Streams, Marshes, Renowned Grottoes, Numinous Mountains, and All Blessed Lands’ Attained Daoist Immortals; the Three Realms’ Responsive and Perceptive, and All True Numinosities.

Your servant has heard: at the inception of the myriad transformations, that which unites them is the wondrous Dao; among the host of numinous beings, that which crowns them is the Most Perfect.

When the Dark and Yellow were sundered, the myriad forms were shaped and ordered. Once the realms of darkness and light were distinguished, governance followed its proper pattern. The Nine August Ones ruled through non-action, the Eight Emperors governed their domains with measured discipline.

Yet in time, the pure source became obstructed, the mysterious blessings ceased to flow. Shun and Yu bequeathed the legacy of abdication, while Tang and Wu arose amidst the clamor of war. Ritual and music crumbled before the Great Simplicity, and sacrificial vessels took pride in petty achievements. Jade and silk merely adorned the rush of contention, while the world’s ways lamentably perished in mutual ruin. This is what is meant by rulers of the age forgetting their roots, the supreme principles left irretrievable. The teeming multitudes, adrift and forlorn—what refuge could they seek?

Thus we know that the tasselled canopy and throne of state cannot secure the perfect governance without the Dao, nor can the trailing robes of office establish our nation without virtue. The Mysterious Origin bestowed its protection, and the Sacred Plum blossomed in splendor. Inheriting the foundation of sagely virtue and enlightened flourishing, it carried forward the legacy of the High Ancestor and Taizong. The court encompassed the Six Directions, its eaves embraced the Nine Lands. It fanned the land with balmy harmony, bathed it in profound blessings, governed through the transforming power of sound and teaching, and rectified it with the *Odes* and *Documents*. Sweet dew suffused the hidden and obscure, and the hundred spirits all fell into proper order; benevolent radiance extended to the tenderest shoots, and great harmony resounded in unison. For two hundred years of Zhao, the realm attained the Dao.

Yet I, of meager virtue, humbly succeed this vast enterprise. I aspire to magnify the standards of purity and quiescence, that the world’s blessings may be foretold. With mind fixed upon the cinnabar tablets, I direct my thoughts to the mysterious scriptures. Unfolding the texts of the Most High’s Nine Heavens, I have obtained the *Primal Cavern’s Scripture of Generating the Spirits* in its entirety. Now, to present the precious registers, I first prepare the altar of purification. Brocades and patterned silks, golden dragons and white jades—these I offer in universal homage across the ten thousand heavens, exhausting the bounds of dawn and dusk in reverent proclamation.

May the responses of all spirits be fully realized, and luminous blessings converge in assembly. May the paired birds and mated fish all return to the land of benevolence and longevity; may the seas and lands within the four seas be transformed into the customs of Huaxu. Let not the Terrace of Yan Zhao alone condense the clouds of the Three Primes, nor the halls of Han Wu alone welcome the descent of the Nine Numinous Chariots. For this is to safeguard the multitudes of billions, not to covet the soaring flight of immortals.

May the host of sagely perfected ones descend to heed this earnest plea. With due reverence, I dispatch the Daoist Master of the Eastern Peak to perform the Nine Heavens’ Precious Purification, for three days and four nights, bowing my head in solemn invocation.

Respectfully submitted.

**Section on Ritual Codes and Ceremonies**

**Ancient Rites for the Inaugural Establishment of a Retreat**

The Dharma Master takes his seat in the hall. The disciples perform nine bows and three prostrations.

All officials array themselves in full ceremonial regalia. The Cantor leads the High Merit Dharma Master forth from the hall. Offerings are made to the Five Emperors, the Three Masters, the Supervisor of the Retreat, the Three Officials, and the Heavenly Master’s incense altar.

All proceed to stand in order before the Mysterious Master’s curtain.

Next, the Retreat Officer bows twice, offers incense, and holds the petition case before the Mysterious Master, stating the purpose of the retreat in his own words, then bows twice again.

The Retreat Officer turns, cradles the petition case, and kneels to present it to the Dharma Master. The Master receives the petition, and the Retreat Officer bows twice.

The Dharma Master withdraws to stand on the right.

Next, the High Merit Master performs three bows, offers incense, and announces the retreat. Du Guangcheng states: According to the old rites, the Retreat Sponsor was to submit a petition daily, following the form for announcing the retreat. Since the petition has already been submitted at the initial establishment of the retreat, to repeat it daily would be superfluous. Thus, it shall be done but once, and omitted on subsequent days.

The officiant, bearing his full title and surname, petitions the Great Dharma Master of the Transformative Center of the Three Heavens:

Now, the disciple of the Great Dao, the official so-and-so, humbly undertakes such-and-such a matter, establishing at such-and-such a place the Supreme Yellow Register Great Retreat for three days and three nights. A petition is submitted, listing the details and invoking the true numina. Today, in accordance with the canonical rites, at the commencement of the retreat, we beseech the Void-Space Overseers, the Day-and-Hour Attendants, the Messengers, the Incense Attendants, and the Courier Officials to open the covenant with the Three Realms, universally announce it to the Ten Directions, and bear witness to the merit. May our petition swiftly ascend, the retreat’s merit be accomplished, the living and the dead receive deliverance, and all—seen and unseen—be blessed with grace. We, the said official and all assembled, are moved by utmost sincerity and earnest prayer, and bow thrice in reverent hope.

Next, the Supervisor of the Retreat proclaims the duties of the officers. Upon completion, he administers the oath, saying: Let all officers attending the retreat fulfill their respective duties with utmost purity, that we may attain spiritual resonance. May the state and the household be blessed, the living and the dead delivered. Those who neglect their duties shall be subject to the prescribed penalties.

Next, the *Hymn to the Dao* is chanted.

From the announcement of the retreat to the chanting of the *Hymn to the Dao* follows Du Guangcheng’s *Rites for the Yellow Register Retreat*.

Next, the *Hymn of Huaxia* is intoned. The High Merit Master proceeds to the outer altar’s main gate, offers incense, and recites the invocation to open the altar.

The Scripture Attendant proclaims the petition to open the altar. Next, the rites for the Golden Bell and Jade Chime are performed. (This was absent in the ancient rites and may be omitted.)

Next, the *Hymn of Huaxia* is chanted. The High Merit Master ascends the outer altar and stands before the Earth Gate.

Next, the High Merit Master, standing to the left of the Earth Gate, silently recites the *Earth Gate Incantation*. Upon completion, he enters through the Earth Gate and ascends to the Middle Altar. The High Merit Master enters first, followed by the officials.

The *Earth Gate Incantation* is from the *Scripture of the Golden Register’s Simplified Texts*.

Next, the High Merit Master enters through the Heavenly Gate and ascends to the Inner Altar, offering incense to the Ten Directions.

The officials circumambulate the Middle Altar, then stand in order.

Next, incense is offered at the Imperial Table. The *Incense Incantation* is from the *Scripture of the Cavern of Perfection*.

Next, the Precentor chants, and all bow to the Master, visualizing as prescribed.

From the *Scripture of the Three Registers’ Simplified Texts*.

Next, the High Merit Master recites the *Five Directions’ Guardian Spirit Incantations*.

From the *Essential Exegesis of the True Writ*.

Next, the Precentor chants, and the Dharma Drum is sounded twenty-four times.

Next, the *Incantation and Prayer for the Threefold Offering of Incense* follows Du Guangcheng’s rites.

**Opening the Censer**

The Most High Lord Lao, the Three Qi of the Primordial Beginning of the Three Heavens, is invoked to summon forth from our bodies the Three and Five Merit Officers, the Left and Right Attendant Envoys, the Left and Right Incense-Bearing Dragon Couriers, the Golden Lads of Incense, the Jade Maidens of Scattered Flowers, and the Five Emperors’ Day-and-Hour Attendants and Incense Officials—thirty-six of each.

Let those summoned array themselves in solemn attire and report to the local deities of the land and domain, the true officials and rightful spirits. We now burn incense and, on behalf of the official so-and-so, earnestly recommend the deceased kin so-and-so, and universally recommend all the souls assembled here, as we establish the Supreme Yellow Register Great Retreat for three days and three nights. On this first night, we inaugurate the altar, invoke the perfected, perform the Dao, fulfill our duties, proclaim the precepts, and covenant with the various heavens. May the life-breath of the Ten Directions’ true and upright perfected ones descend and flow into our bodies, that our petition swiftly ascend directly to the Most High, Boundless, and Great Dao, the Perfectly True Jade Emperor of the Supreme Ultimate, before whom we bow thrice.

The *Opening* and *Closing of the Censer* are from the *Simplified Texts of the Three Registers*.

From the *Opening of the Censer* to the *Closing of the Censer*, all petitions and expressions of repentance during the establishment of the retreat and the setting of the altar rely on the transmission of the immortals and spirits. Thus, at the end of the *Opening of the Censer*, it is said: “May our petition swiftly ascend directly to the Most High, Boundless, and Great Dao, the Perfectly True Jade Emperor of the Supreme Ultimate.” Likewise, at the end of the *Closing of the Censer*, it is said: “May the petition we have just submitted swiftly ascend directly to the Most High, Boundless, and Great Dao, the Perfectly True Jade Emperor of the Supreme Ultimate.”

Modern masters, ignorant of the scriptural intent, insert additional phrases into the *Opening of the Censer*, elaborating at length and importuning the celestial perfected. During the covenant and proclamation, they strive for ornate rhymes, squandering time and effort. A single *Opening of the Censer* may take nearly one or two *ke*; the rest may be inferred. Where, then, lies their earnest sincerity?

The prayer states: “Arrayed in solemn attire, report to the local deities of the land and domain.” This refers to the deities who govern the Three Realms, each with their appointed duties. The vastness of the Great Void makes direct transmission difficult. Those dwelling in the earthly realm, when making petitions, must rely on the local deities to relay them step by step, that resonance may be achieved. Thus, the *Majestic Rites for the Supreme Ultimate Retreat* summon the officials from within the body and from the registers of the ritual domain, reporting to the oratories, lodges, and transformative centers of the four directions, the mountains and rivers, the hills and marshes, the deities of the various temples, the lords of the land, the spirits of the altars and granaries, and the generals and officers, all to join in the ascent.

In the *Ritual of the Broad and Luminous Offering* by Du, beyond the sacred perfected ones, a separate altar is necessarily established for the day-duty deities of the land—precisely because the root and origin of all petitions for transmission lie here. Yet Guang Zhangruo and Hai, how could they comprehend this? They merely designated it as a mark of rank. During the Tianfu era of the Later Jin in the Five Dynasties, they expounded upon this in their discourse, revealing their profound lack of understanding.

The *Most High, Boundless, Great Dao, Perfectly True Jade Sovereign of the August Heaven*—who within the vast expanse of the Six Directions could stand beyond the Dao and qi? The *Perfectly True Jade Sovereign* encompasses countless august deities in its title. Yet Yang Jie, in his revision of the *Golden Register*, altered it to *The Three Pure Ones, Supreme Saints, Jade Sovereign of the August Heaven*—this is to seek within the petty realm of form and appearance. Moreover, he did not base his changes on the scriptural texts but lightly altered them according to his private judgment; such an approach is not adopted here.

I have observed that in the *Methods of Ritual Practice*, when the High Priest ascends to the principal altar to offer incense, the incense-attendant and the ritual director proceed to the left, first offering incense to the Ten Directions, beginning with the North. Next, the Cantor intones, and all present recite their dharma ranks and the scriptures and registers they have received, declaring their dharma ranks and their commitment to perform the great ritual of the *Yellow Register*.

"We, your servants, now offer this incense, dedicating its merit upward for the Son of Heaven, the princes and marquises, the local officials and magistrates, the masters of scriptures and ordination, the Daoist scholars dwelling in mountains and caves, fellow practitioners, the disciples of so-and-so, the nine generations of ancestors of the departed, both the living and the dead of two generations, kin and relatives, inner and outer affines, all people under heaven, flying and crawling creatures, and all sentient beings.

We now offer this incense, taking refuge in the body, taking refuge in the spirit, taking refuge in the life, in the *Most High, Ten Directions, Numinous Treasure, Natural, Perfectly True, Supreme Great Dao*. We specially beseech the forgiveness of transgressions committed in past and present lives, in the course of birth and death, of deep-seated karmic obstacles and grave faults, that we may be delivered from the Three Evil Paths, the Ten Sufferings and Eight Difficulties, and the Nine Perils. May our bodies attain the perfection of the Dao, soaring through empty space, ascending to heaven in broad daylight. May we attend upon the Dao Lords, roaming freely in the unexcelled, seven-jeweled, spontaneously arisen palaces of the Golden Gates, forever in union with the Dao.

May the resonance of this mysterious invocation ascend before the *Perfectly True, Boundless Dao*."

From the *Golden Register Simplified Texts*.

Then the Cantor intones, and the assembly bows to the Ten Directions, devoutly taking refuge in the *Boundless Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Northern Realm*. One bow.

To the Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, Above, and Below. Then the Cantor intones, and each takes refuge and repents, with the Dharma Masters kneeling in penitence.

We, the assembled ritualists, devoutly take refuge in the *Boundless Supreme Dao Heavenly Worthy*. We repent on behalf of the Preceptor, the assembly, and all beings—past and present lives, transgressions of the bodily form, the four limbs’ every movement, actions violating precepts, and conduct not in accord with the scriptures. The grave sins of bodily karma are measureless and boundless; we beseech their complete eradication. May the Preceptor, the assembly, and all beings attain union with the Perfected Immortals, merging with the Dao and the True. We bow in reverence and gratitude to the *Supreme Ten Directions, Orthodox and True Three Treasures*. One bow.

We, the assembled ritualists, devoutly take refuge in the *Boundless Supreme Dao Heavenly Worthy*. We repent on behalf of the Preceptor, the assembly, and all beings—past and present lives, transgressions of mental karma, distracted thoughts, fickle emotions, restless impulses. The grave sins of mental karma are measureless and boundless; we beseech their complete eradication. May the Preceptor, the assembly, and all beings unite their spirits with True Quiescence, penetrating the Natural. We bow in reverence and gratitude to the *Supreme Ten Directions, Orthodox and True Three Treasures*. One bow.

We, the assembled ritualists, devoutly take refuge in the *Boundless Supreme Dao Heavenly Worthy*. We repent on behalf of the Preceptor, the assembly, and all beings—past and present lives, transgressions of verbal karma, perverse speech, deceitful words, ornate rhetoric misleading the multitude. The grave sins of verbal karma are measureless and boundless; we beseech their complete eradication. May the Preceptor, the assembly, and all beings unite their nature and life with the Dao, merging with the Profound and Non-Action. We bow in reverence and gratitude to the *Supreme Ten Directions, Orthodox and True Three Treasures*. One bow.

Then the Cantor intones:
We, the assembled ritualists, devoutly take refuge in the *Three Supreme Worthies and the Sages of the Ten Directions*. The scriptures are revered in accordance with the Dharma.

Next, three invocations are chanted, each followed by one bow. From the *Sutra of the Fundamental Vows of Wisdom*:

I take the Dharma as my wife,
Cherishing the scriptures as pearls and jade.
Holding precepts to restrain the six senses,
Contemplating the Dao to dispel desires.
Serene, the true qi abides;
Empty, the spirit is still.
Heavenly demons all revere and protect,
Lifetimes of great blessings received.
Flourishing are family and state,
Prosperous the scriptures and Dao.
Heaven and humankind share this vow,
Soaring into the Great Vehicle.
Cultivating the mind to establish a field of merit,
The Dharma Wheel ascends in splendor.
Seven generations of ancestors ascend to heaven,
My body soars in broad daylight.
The Great Dao pervades the Profound Void,
With mindfulness, all is in accord.
Refining the body to enter the Immortal True,
Attaining the Diamond Body.
Transcending the Three Realms’ trials,
Liberating from the Five Sufferings of hell.
All take refuge in the *Supreme Scriptures*,
In stillness, we bow in reverence.

Then, all bow at once to the Three Treasures.

The Cantor intones:
With utmost devotion, we bow to the *Boundless Supreme Dao*. One bow.
With utmost devotion, we bow to the *True Writs and Sacred Talismans of the Thirty-Six Divisions of the Supreme Orthodox Scriptures*. One bow.
With utmost devotion, we bow to the *Three Supreme Worthies, the Sages of the Ten Directions, and the Great Dharma Masters of the Mystic Realm*. One bow.

Next, the High Priest proceeds to the left, arriving at the East. Holding the True Writs, he censes them over the incense. He intones the four characters *Dǎnlóu Āhuì*, and the assembly echoes the incantation:
*Dǎnlóu Āhuì, Wúhé Guānyīn.
Xūyán Míngshǒu, Fǎlǎn Pútán.
Jiànà Āyì, Hūhē Liúyín.
Huādū Qūlì, Xiānpú Yùzhēn.
Dáluò Dàfàn, Sànyān Qìngyún.
Fēisǎ Yùdū, Míngmó Shàngmén.
Wúxíng Shàngshǒu, Huízhí Liúxuán.
Ātuó Lóngluó, Sìxiàng Xūyuán.*

The assembly bows twice, places the True Writs upon the eastern altar, secures them with a golden dragon, and presses them with jade rulers on either side.

Next, the High Priest proceeds to the left, arriving at the South. Holding the True Writs, he censes them over the incense. He intones the four characters *Nányán Dòngfú*, and the assembly echoes the incantation:
*Nányán Dòngfú, Yùmóu Shēnshēn.
Fànxíng Luòkōng, Jiǔlíng Tuīqián.
Zéwú Pútái, Lǜluó Dàqiān.
Miǎomǎng Jiǔchǒu, Sháoyáo Yuánzāo.
Yúnshàng Jiǔdū, Fēishēng Zìqiān.
Nàyù Yùfù, Móluó Fǎlún.
Hóngchí Wújìng, Lǎnzī Yùnróng.
Fùlǎng Kuòyì, Shényīng Zìgōng.*

The assembly bows twice, places the True Writs upon the southern altar, and secures them with a golden dragon.

Next, the High Priest proceeds to the left, arriving at the West. Holding the True Writs, he censes them over the incense. He intones the four characters *Dāolì Chányóu*, and the assembly echoes the incantation:
*Dāolì Chányóu, Póní Jiùtōng.
Wǎnsǒu Díshǎi, Tàimiǎo Zhītáng.
Liúluó Fànméng, Jǐngwèi Xiāoyú.
Yìmiǎo Wújì, Wǎnshǒu Shǎodū.
Āyù Yùzhú, Huámò Yányóu.
Jiǔkāi Zìbiàn, Ānà Pǐnshǒu.
Wúliàng Fúgài, Fúluó Héshén.
Yùdàn Chángsāng, □ Kōngdù Xiān.*

The assembly bows twice, places the True Writs upon the western altar, and secures them with a golden dragon.

Next, the High Priest proceeds to the left, arriving at the North. Holding the True Writs, he censes them over the incense. He intones the four characters *Juéwú Zìyù*, and the assembly echoes the incantation:
*Juéwú Zìyù, Jiǔrì Dǎoqián.
Kūnmǔ Dōngfù, Xíngshè Shàngxuán.
Tuóluó Yùmiǎo, Miǎoqì Héyún.
Fēitiān Dàchǒu, Zǒngjiān Shàngtiān.
Shātuó Jiéliàng, Lónghàn Yīngxiān.
Bìluò Fúlí, Kōnggē Bǎozhēn.
Èyì Wúpǐn, Dòngmiào Zìzhēn.
Yuánfàn Huīmò, Yōujì Dùrén.*

The assembly bows twice, places the True Writs upon the northern altar, and secures them with a golden dragon.

Next, the High Priest proceeds to the left, arriving before the throne. He takes the True Writs of the Center and censes them over the incense. He intones the four characters *Huángzhōng Lǐqì*, and the assembly echoes, reciting from the *Qingdu* section of *The Numinous Treasure Rite of the Five Refineries for the Living and the Dead*: "The Yellow Emperor’s single qi, the celestial writ of the Yellow Center’s earthly qi, governs all spirits. The Star of Stability emits its essence, refining the divine form through circulation." This differs from the previous; it should be examined.

The incantation follows:
*Huángzhōng Lǐqì, tǒngshè wúqióng.
Zhènxīng tǔhuī, liúliàn shéngōng.*

The assembly bows twice, places the True Writs upon the altar, and secures them with a golden dragon.

The High Priest then intones the Jade Characters of the East: *Dǎnlóu Āhuì*. Next, he proceeds to the South, then the West, then the North, and finally the Center, as before. The assembly joins in unison, reciting the Jade Characters of the Five Directions once through. The High Priest returns to his position.

This is drawn from *The Scripture of the Five Refineries for the Living and the Dead*.

Next, the memorial to the Ten Directions’ Divine Officers is proclaimed.
Next, the ranks of the Dharma are solemnly recited.

We, your humble servants, [names] and all present, reverently conduct the great Numinous Treasure fast and Dharma rites, and now respectfully address the Most High, Boundless Dao, the Primordial Celestial Worthy of Original Commencement; the Most High Lord of the Dao; the Most High Lord Lao; the Hosts of Great Perfected Worthies and Celestial Worthies of the Ten Directions who have attained the Dao; the Perfect Sovereigns and Great Thearchs; the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures; the Great Dharma Masters of the Mystic Realm; the Heavenly Master Lords; the Supreme Ministers; the Four Offices and Five Thearchs; and all the divine officials and true spirits of the Three Realms.

By fortunate karmic affinity, we were born into this great transformation of the Nine Heavens’ kalpa. Extending to the present, the Three Treasures have unfolded their chart, and the Three Vehicles guide their course. The true scriptures expound their teachings; the great Dao transmits its precepts. The secret registers and numinous writs harmonize heaven and stabilize earth. Above, they protect the nation’s destiny; below, they deliver the living and the dead.

We, though humble and unworthy, have received the transmission of true ranks and, on the day of our ordination, pledged our vows before the Three Officials. To save beings and deliver souls is the foundation of merit. Thus, we should broadly proclaim the secret and wondrous, opening the Way to those who have not yet heard. All who take refuge should be duly reported. Having respectfully presented our petition, we dare not fail to make this known.

The proclamation is read:
As stated in the memorial, with utmost sincerity and reverence, the fast’s sponsor, [name], has long been blessed with good affinity and taken refuge in the supreme Dao. Bound by duty to requite and offer, his resolve to cultivate and honor is profound. Yet he deeply fears that the departed spirit, [name], along with his nine generations of ancestors and seven generations of kin, and all karmic relations across countless kalpas—those suffering in the Six Realms and Three Paths, the boundless hosts of the afflicted—may have, in their lifetimes, committed sins too numerous to name. After death, they entered hell, where their suffering knows no end.

We humbly pray for your grace and mercy to deliver the living and the dead. May they repent before the Mystic Perfected, dissolving past karmic obstructions. Above, may this benefit the nation and the family; below, may it protect all beings.

We, your servants, dare not presume to judge, but respectfully submit this plea together.

At the sacred altar in [location], in accordance with the *Huanglu* liturgical texts of the Lower Prime and the ranks of transcendent immortals, we establish the rites of the Mystic Ordinance. Modeling the four quarters and eight directions upon Heaven and Earth, we present the gold-dragon silks and multicolored banners entrusted by [name], securing and consecrating the Ten Directions. [Number] feet of life-thread silk are offered as tokens of our cinnabar sincerity. We bathe our five limbs and purify our hearts in still contemplation.

On this [day] of the present month, we undertake the supreme *Huanglu* Grand Fast, transcribing the petition and fulfilling its terms. We burn incense and rotate the scriptures, kindle lamps to perpetuate their radiance, and illuminate all heavens. For three days and three nights, we perform the Dao nine times at the appointed hours. We deliver the departed spirit [name] and the household of disciple [name], along with their myriad ancestors, imprisoned souls, and those bound by karmic adversaries and sinful suffering.

Following the liturgical statutes, we humbly submit this preliminary report. May the Most High Three Worthies, the Perfected Sages of the Ten Directions, and the Great Dharma Masters of the Mystic Realm deign to turn their divine gaze upon our petition and review what has been set forth. We beseech you to command the officials of the Numinous Treasure, the local earth deities, and all attendant spirits to unite in purpose and strength, safeguarding the fast’s precincts, sweeping clean its inner and outer bounds, purifying the altar grounds, subduing demonic forces, and annihilating malevolent influences. May we, your servants, find peace of mind and stability of spirit, our thoughts swiftly answered, the heavens serene and the earth luminous, our supplications ascending without hindrance. May the fast’s merit be perfected without obstruction.

Though we bear the seals of the Most Real and partake in the Great Dharma, we dwell in the Five Turbidities and are stained by the Six Dusts. The Three Barriers remain unharmonized, and the Six Passions run unchecked. We rely upon the precepts to restrain body and mind. In accordance with the luminous statutes, we now proclaim the威仪 of the precepts, that all participants in the fast may comprehend the Dharma’s teachings. Tomorrow morning, as we perform the Dao, we will submit a further report.

Respectfully submitted.

The *Ziran Chao* ("Natural Audience") is the progenitor of all fasts. At the commencement of any fast, the *Ziran Chao* must first be conducted: the incense is lit, names and ranks are recited, and the Ten Directions are entreated with repentance. The Three Karmas, Three Petitions, and Three Bows are performed—this is the *Ziran Chao*. Through it, the true texts are revealed, the petition is read, the precepts are proclaimed, offices are filled, and prohibitions are declared. This is what the present liturgy means by "following the liturgical statutes and submitting a preliminary report."

The phrase "tomorrow morning, as we perform the Dao, we will submit a further report" indicates that the formal fast and performance of the Dao will begin the following day. When establishing a fast for others, one must first inform the true spirits of the intent to undertake the fast. According to ancient statutes, the preliminary report is submitted at the *zi* hour on the day the fast begins. However, in *Lingbao Daoshi Zixiu Mengzhen Zhaiyi* ("Ritual for the Lingbao Daoist’s Self-Cultivation Fast of Alliance with the Real"), compiled by Master Lu, there is no preliminary report. Instead, on the morning of the fast, the precepts are proclaimed, the fast is initiated, and the Dao is performed, followed by the recitation of scriptures. The statutes simply state: "When establishing a fast, first perform the *Ziran Chao*," with no mention of a preliminary report or dispersal of the altar.

Zhang Ruohai of Yun’guang, lacking depth of insight and unacquainted with the scriptures, presumptuously offered his own opinions, committing them to writing in twenty articles that grossly contravene the teachings. This has led later generations of the unlearned to err by proclaiming precepts and filling offices *before* the preliminary report, and only then ascending the altar after receiving the registers. Master Du Guangcheng has rightly criticized this practice.

As seen in the *Zhaifa Xiuyong Men* ("Gate of Ritual Use in Fasts") compiled by Li Jingqi, on the day the altar is established, the *Ziran Chao* is first performed before the Great Dao in the afternoon. The precepts are then proclaimed, and one returns to the Mystic Master’s tent to fill offices and declare prohibitions. Only at night is the preliminary report submitted in accordance with the statutes. This means that before the fast has even begun, the *Ziran Chao* is performed twice in a single day—is this not redundant?

While at the Bamboo Palace, I once discussed this with Liu Chongjing. He argued that on the night of the preliminary report, the division of lamps, the breaking of hell-prisons, and the summoning and bathing of spirits involve an overwhelming number of tasks. Without this arrangement, the limited hours of the day might leave some matters unattended. Yet, in the end, this is not the ancient way.

Having now reverted entirely to the original liturgical manual, should one conduct the fast rites without seeking ornamental beauty in the flourishes of elaborate chanting, but instead follow the scriptures and manuals in their practice, there will assuredly be ample energy to spare. Let those who cherish antiquity join together in its propagation.

Next, recite the *Three Hymns of Wisdom*, bowing once after each hymn. These are taken from the *Sutra of Wisdom’s Contemplation of the Body*:

**First Hymn**
Wisdom arises from the primordially non-existent,
Radiant, transcending the ten directions.
It weaves emptiness to stand in the Mystic Empyrean,
While all heavens draw from its flowing fragrance.
Its marvel defies thought and discourse—
Through void, true and real interpenetrate.
What seems to exist ultimately does not,
And what seems not to exist is not absent.

**Second Hymn**
Wisdom ever contemplates the body,
The first task of those who study the Dao.
Vast and boundless, it roams the Mystic Expanse,
Naturally recording my spirit.
The Heavenly Worthy ever shields and guards,
While demon kings pledge their protection.
Resplendent is the Vajra body,
Transcending even before the Most High.

**Third Hymn**
Wisdom engenders the root of precepts,
For the true Dao takes precepts as its master.
From this arise the Three Treasures,
Revered and received by lofty immortals.
Riding this deathless vessel,
Swiftly one crosses the Great Existence.
At this moment of proclaiming the precepts,
All heavens bow their heads in homage.

Next, circumambulate once around the altar. The Dharma Master stands facing east.
Then chant the invocation to the ten directions.
All officials and disciples prostrate fully, silently paying homage to the ten directions, bowing once to each, beginning with the north.

Next, chant the instruction for the assembly to be seated for the precept-proclamation.
All officials face west and sit facing east. Disciples receive the precepts together before the altar as the Dharma Master, holding three incense sticks, proclaims the precepts.

The Heavenly Worthy addresses the Most High Lord of the Dao, saying:
“Now is the time to universally proclaim the Dharma’s sound, awakening all beings. For all men and women, we dissolve calamities and avert misfortunes, invoke blessings and receive destiny, and uproot the roots of suffering.
May the living behold the Dao and escape the eight difficulties in body;
May the dead rejoice and feast in the heavens.”

May you be reborn early among men, in the household of a Wheel-Turning Sage King.
When performing purification rites or seeking the Dao, maintain wholehearted devotion.
Receive the Ten Precepts with careful attention, never forgetting them.
Focus your mind in silent contemplation, deeply reflecting on the natural order.
Avoid stray thoughts that disturb body and spirit.
Those who can do so should listen with quietude.

The First Precept: Let the heart be free of malice and envy, without harboring hidden ill will.
Guard your speech and correct your faults, keeping your thoughts fixed on the Dharma.

The Second Precept: Uphold benevolence and refrain from killing, showing compassion to all living beings.
Extend boundless mercy and salvation, nourishing all things.

The Third Precept: Maintain integrity and yield to righteousness, neither lusting nor stealing.
Always cultivate good intentions, sacrificing for others.

The Fourth Precept: Be free from sensuality and desire, keeping the mind from recklessness.
Uphold purity and vigilance, ensuring your conduct remains unstained.

The Fifth Precept: Let your speech be free of malice, avoiding ornate or deceitful words.
Be upright in all things, inwardly and outwardly, without transgressing in speech.

The Sixth Precept: Abstain from alcohol and regulate your conduct, harmonizing your qi and nature.
Preserve your spirit from harm, avoiding all evil.

The Seventh Precept: Do not envy those superior to you or contend for fame and merit.
In all matters, yield and defer, humbling yourself to aid others.

The Eighth Precept: Do not criticize the scriptures or slander sacred texts.
Devote yourself to the Dharma, ever as if in the presence of the divine.

The Ninth Precept: Do not engage in quarrels or gossip, nor judge others.
Heaven and humanity will resent you, harming your spirit and qi.

The Tenth Precept: In all actions and conduct, maintain equanimity and single-mindedness.
Let harmony prevail among people and spirits, ever thus in your practice.

Having recited the Ten Precepts, can you uphold them?
The assembly responds, each declaring, "We can uphold them."
The Heavenly Worthy says: To observe these pure precepts is ever in accord with the will of Heaven, always practicing great compassion.
May you universally deliver all from this troubled world.
Reverently follow the sacred teachings without negligence.
Better to die upholding goodness than to live in evil.

Thus, without retreat, you may escape the Five Paths and avoid the Three Evil Realms.
Protected by all heavens, revered by myriad spirits,
Through unwavering devotion to the precepts and purification rites, you will attain liberation.
The Heavenly Worthy says: The Dao is exalted, its Dharma wondrous; the human body is also precious.
Thus, the Dao has revealed scriptures and precepts to liberate humanity.
Once the human body is liberated, it ascends to unite with the Dao.
Strive in your practice, observe the precepts, purify your heart, and still your mind.
Let your aspirations be clear, your devotion single-minded, without division.
Purify the six viscera, refrain from overindulgence in food.
Maintain inner and outer purity, ever in harmony with the natural order.

On the day of purification, when offering incense and making vows, let your sincerity ascend to the Four Heavens,
Where the Ten Divisions of Vigilant Deities will descend to witness your conduct and listen to the Dharma.
If your heart aligns with the precepts and you practice the Dao, your merits will be recorded in the heavens.
Fortune and misfortune will manifest instantly; the Dao does not fail those who strive.
Receive these teachings earnestly, and let no demonic words sway you.

The Heavenly Worthy says: When establishing purification rites and practicing the Dao,
The Four Heavenly Kings arrive in flying clouds and jade chariots,
Attended by perfected beings and jade maidens, bearing flower banners,
Preceded by phoenix songs and followed by celestial music.
White cranes and lions sing in harmony,
Burning incense and scattering flowers as they float through the air.
They come to witness the rites, listen to the Dharma, and pay homage.
The Heavenly Kings descend, and myriad spirits gather in reverence.
How could one not fully commit to such a practice?
First receive the Ten Precepts, then proceed with the Daoist rites.
Move with refined grace, still your mind, and close your thoughts.
In sitting, rising, lying, or resting, never depart from proper decorum.
The Heavenly Kings rejoice, inscribing your name in the Upper Clarity.
This is what it means to attain the Dao within the square inch of your heart.

From *The Scripture of the Upper Grade of Wisdom and the Great Precepts*,
Bestowed by the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning upon the Most High Lord of the Dao
In the first year of the Kaihuang era, in the Western Jade Land of Xina.

Next, chant the Precept-Honoring Hymn and circumambulate once before returning to the ranks.
From *The Scripture of the Venerable Immortal’s Inquiry*:

The Dao is the origin of no-mind,
All acts become fields of merit.
Merit has no fixed master,
Each fulfills their vow as they will.
Empty yourself to respond to all beings,
Focus your mind without partiality.
The Great Sage expounds the supreme teaching,
Like rain falling from the heavens.
It reaches all, high and low,
Ever humble, thus forming the abyss.
The sea is king of a hundred rivers,
For it contains the scales of dragons.
Through ten thousand kalpas, wisdom endures,
Not merely for this lifetime.
Uphold the precepts without lapse,
And世世善结缘。
Cultivate deep contemplation of the Great Vehicle,
And you shall embody the true Dao.

Next, the High Master selects and appoints the assembly officials.
The next day, during the Daoist rites, each shall fulfill their duties.

The High Master, as the scriptures say, should be one of lofty virtue, deeply versed in the meaning of the scriptures.
Such a person is inwardly filled with Dao and virtue, outwardly adorned with proper decorum.
In every movement, whether bowing or rising, they embody the Dharma.
They are a model for the Three Realms, observed by gods and spirits.
They open prayers, invoke the divine, and summon spirits.
They resolve doubts, dispel obstacles, and guide the assembly.
The Dharma Master bows twice, receives the tablet, and bows again.

The Cantor, as the scriptures say, should be one of keen intelligence, well-versed in the rites.
Their duty is to regulate the timing of the rites, from beginning to end, in eating and resting.
They first report to the Dharma Master, then lead the assembly.
In bowing, yielding, and all gestures, they provide the proper chants.
The appointee bows twice at their station, approaches the High Master’s seat, kneels to receive the tablet, returns to their place, and bows again. The assembly follows likewise.

The Purification Overseer’s duty is to inspect the assembly for faults, correcting errors and omissions.
They uphold the regulations, reporting all matters as they arise.
They must ensure fairness, without concealment or leniency.

The Scripture Attendant’s duty is to safeguard the sacred texts, arranging their covers and wrappings.
They prepare the high seat, the table, and the seating for the four directions.
They keep all adornments neat and orderly, without negligence.

The Incense Attendant’s duty is to manage the censer and ensure the fire burns cleanly.
During the three periods of rites and the two scripture recitations,
They must prepare everything in advance, never lacking when needed.

The Lamp Attendant’s duty is to oversee the illumination of the four directions,
Preparing the lamps and arranging them according to the rites.

The flames must burn brightly, ever radiant and clear. Should wind or rain arise, preventing the fire from standing firm, one must report to the Dharma Master and cease only when permitted. No negligence or slackness is allowed, lest the rites fall into neglect or abandonment.

The above expounds the six offices, drawn from the *Golden Register*’s *Simplified Text*, forming the solemn decorum for ascending the fast.

Master Lu’s *Lingbao Fast* states in its *Ritual of Light, Candles, Prohibitions, Penalties, and Vows*: First, the preliminary petitions are completed. Then, the ten precepts of the highest grade are conferred. Facing east, all stand evenly and recite the *Hymn of Wisdom*. Upon finishing, they turn north, prostrate body and head to the ground, and repentantly bow to the ten directions. The Dharma Master then faces west from the east to expound the precepts and decorum. After the precepts are delivered, the Dharma Master returns to his seat, and the assembly of officers kneels to receive their writs. The following day, during the circumambulation, each attends to their assigned duties. Once the appointments are made, all face east to offer incense in renewal. The officers then lead the procession to the hall, arranging themselves in order of rank. The Dharma Master again proclaims the regulations and prohibitions, instructing all in the proper decorum.

Thus, the recitation of precepts, the appointment of offices, and the proclamation of prohibitions must occur after the preliminary petitions, as clearly stipulated in the regulations. However, the prohibitions and decorum are only announced after the renewal of incense—not for any other reason, but because Master Lu’s system includes, beyond the thirty-six articles of the *Great Ultimate*, many additional rules. For instance:

First, ensure an ample supply of fragrant oil and pure water, never allowing shortages or deficiencies when needed. Next, repair and maintain latrines, ensuring they are fully enclosed and not exposed. Furthermore, when establishing the fast and arranging seating, no outsiders may intermingle with the assembly. The offerings of the fast must always be simple, pure, and unadorned. On the day of the fast, at dawn, serve white congee, vegetable greens, salt, and fermented beans. During the day, provide meals of vegetable broth, steamed greens, pickled greens, ginger, and the like, concluding with ample leftovers. According to the kitchen’s provisions and the regulations, no wine is permitted, as clearly stated in the texts. These prohibitions are meticulously detailed, intending that the fast’s sponsor, along with all present, submit to the Dharma’s teachings. The ten precepts are not solely for the six offices but must be received by the sponsor as well, making it fitting to expound them after the renewal of incense.

First, the *Natural Audience* is performed, followed by the recitation of precepts, the appointment of offices, and the proclamation of decorum. This sequence, observed from the Jin to the Tang dynasties, remained unchanged. However, Zhang Ruohai of the *Cloud Radiance* sect, propagating reckless and baseless claims, composed the *Rectification of Errors in the Primordial Altar*. Shallow scholars, swayed by his arguments, began to follow his teachings, causing the ancient methods to gradually fade into obscurity.

Master Chongzhen once thoroughly refuted these errors. Zhang Ruohai asserted: “Today, when Daoists gather for a fast, they assemble from dawn until night. After the sponsor submits the petition and the Dharma Master issues the announcement before the *Mystic Center* Master, they ascend the altar to proceed. Following the *Great Thanksgiving*, they immediately turn to the *Cavern Tablet* to recite the precepts and appoint offices. How grievously disordered this is!”

He further stated: “The rites of the *Audience with the Perfected* are akin to the state’s sacrifices to the gods. Seven days prior, the Grand Commandant gathers the fast’s officers to administer the precepts and oaths. Never has it been heard that the officers are admonished only after the sacrifices conclude. Now, Daoists ascend the fast, offer the solemn petition and thanksgiving, then recite the precepts—listening to the admonitions as if they were newly ordained, receiving the precepts of the Dao. The sequence is inverted, the order disrupted. This stems from past scholars’ failure to correct and amend, blindly following erroneous regulations, leading later generations to perpetuate these mistaken practices.”

The remaining errors and absurdities are too numerous to enumerate in full.

Yet they do not consider: when the Most High Heavenly Worthy opened the Upper Palace of Mystery Metropolis, the Purple Tenuity Jade Canon revealed the wondrous fasts of the Numinous Treasure, establishing the standards of dignity and decorum for the deliverance of all classes—all meticulously recorded in the scriptures. *Numinous* means *spiritual*: its subtle and wondrous efficacy lies beyond the reach of thought and discussion, its transformations boundless—hence it is called *numinous*. *Treasure* is *oneness*, that which the Three Powers attain and by which they are made pure, tranquil, and upright. What must not be lost—hence it is called *treasure*.

Dwelling in the defiled world, humans are restless across the Three Passes, unable to remain still. The body engages in killing, theft, and lustful movement—thus it is disciplined through prostration. The mouth utters evil speech, frivolous and deceitful words, double-tongued slander—thus it is tasked with scripture recitation. The heart harbors greed, desire, and wrath—thus it is directed to contemplate the divine. Through these three methods, the heart is cleansed and conduct purified. When heart and conduct reach utmost refinement, this is the meaning of the fast.

The Perfected of the Great Ultimate expounded the scriptures and composed the essentials of fasts, precepts, and dignified decorum. Celestial Master Lu gathered these essentials and compiled the rites of fasts, thanksgivings, precepts, and penalties. Whether the Three Registers and Nine Yous, the liberation from the trials of fire and water, the three-day or seven-day fasts, or the one-time or nine-time observances—though the categories are manifold, the standards of decorum remain unified. To trace the source is to abandon the Perfected of the Great Ultimate and Celestial Master Lu—where else could one turn?

Yun Guang, ignorant and unlearned, presumptuously offers his critiques. Master Chongzhen rebukes him for his shallow, vulgar views, which obliterate the lofty regulations of the worthy and the sage, subverting the mystic principles and abandoning the sagely Dharma without law. It is like the mud-dauber or the frog in the well, unaware of the vastness of the sea. The twenty instances of his perverse errors are meticulously refuted in detail, the texts of which are preserved in the Daoist Canon.

In our present dynasty, the flourishing of Daoist learning has seen the explication of scriptures and the refinement of texts, with offices established for this purpose. Yet when Yang Jie revised the *Golden Register*, he in some cases followed Yun Guang’s lead—this is truly cause for deep lament.

As for Yun Guang’s claims: in today’s grand fasts, the fast’s sponsor must submit a petition in advance, which the Dharma Master receives and memorializes, all occurring a month prior. The sequential presentation of memorials, the proclamation of talismanic decrees—is this not what is meant by “first conducting the proceedings”? If one insists that the appointment of offices must follow the proceedings, calling it inverted, how then could the High Priest be appointed *before* the preliminary announcements and formal memorials?

Upon careful examination, the scriptural regulations regarding the appointment of offices are intended for the dawn ritual processions—mere preparatory rites, unrelated to the main fast. Yet Yun Guang conflates the main fast with these, calling it an eleven-session Dharma rite. No wonder his arguments are so tangled.

The Most High bequeathed the methods of the fast’s direct repentance and thanksgiving to universally deliver gods and humans, serving as a bridge for all classes. Sins may be repented, and blessings will follow. Dwelling within the Three Realms, enmeshed in the turning wheel of causes and conditions, defiled by karmic burdens, we accumulate transgressions in myriad forms—offending the Three Luminaries, the mountains and rivers, the ten directions. The *Scripture of the Treasure Accumulation* enumerates these sins, binding them in the Nine Yous. To seek absolution and deliverance, one must first perform repentance according to the proper methods—this is the purpose.

The repentance texts for the twenty directions are found in the *Yellow Register’s Simplified Writs* and the *Scripture of the Three Primes’ Precepts*. Those for the ten directions appear in the *Essential Explications of the True Writs* and the *Jade Canopy’s Alliance with the Perfected*. How could such scriptures be subject to the conjectures of worldly, vulgar men?

A single day’s observance is merely called a *fast gathering*. Only when it spans three days or more is it termed a *fast and precepts*. For seven or nine days, or even a full month, the scriptural regulations for the processions, repentances, and thanksgivings never consider repetition a fault. Yet Yun Guang claims that a three-day Dharma assembly consists of eleven sessions, with nine sessions devoted to repentance, leaving the fast’s sponsor and officers standing for long periods, leaning wearily against the altar—how could they endure it? The repentance texts need only be read once. If, after the grand thanksgiving, they are recited two or three times, one need only alternate the texts. They must not be reread within three days. Yet those who conduct fasts today, seeking to eliminate complexity and embrace simplicity, have taken to such contrivances.

The *Upper Clarity* fast’s rites extend to the Nine Heavens, and the Nine Heavenly Emperors are none other than the Heavenly Worthies. The regulations state: “The Heavenly Worthy of the Infinite Joy Heaven of the Highest Realm.” The *Cavern Spirit* fast, beyond the ten directions, adds a central incense altar—making eleven. The *Numinous Treasure Alliance with the Perfected* fast, though repenting to the ten directions, in the *Golden Register’s Simplified Writs* naturally extends to the four poles—making fourteen. The *Yellow Register’s Three Primes* fast, beyond the ten directions, also pays homage to the Three Luminaries, the Five Peaks, the Water Palaces, and the *Scripture Treasure*—making twenty. Though the positions of the directions vary, they ultimately do not depart from the ten. For the Primordial Beginning divided the empty realm into ten directions, five billion worlds, and three thousand universes. Within each domain lie ten directions and Three Realms, the sun, moon, and stars, the celestial bureaus and earthly offices, the Heavenly Worthies of the Nine Yous and hells—scattered in radiant forms, pervading the world. Responding to the needs of beings, they preach the Dharma and deliver humanity. The ranks of sages, perfected beings, and immortals, high and low, are beyond the perception of mortal eyes and vulgar men.

Thus, in the *Upper Clarity* regulations, the Primordial Beginning is placed after the Nine Heavenly Primordial Father and Mysterious Mother, not out of irreverence. In the *Numinous Treasure* scriptures, the Thirty-Two Heavens and their Emperors are elevated above the Primordial Beginning’s Supreme Emperor and the Most High Dao Lord, not out of disrespect—each has its own causes and conditions.

Yun Guang claims that when the Dharma Master first offers incense to the ten directions, it is to first descend the true *qi* of the ten directions. Yet when addressing the Three Clarities in memorials, omitting the titles of the myriad Heavenly Worthies is not due to neglect but because the Three Clarities are without peer. In today’s fasts, after the proclamation of the memorial and the triple offering of incense, homage is paid to the ten directions, sometimes combined with repentance, and further extended to the sun, moon, and stars, the Five Peaks, and the Water Lords. There are even repentance texts for the ten Heavenly Worthies of the directions and the sun, moon, and stars—this may be acceptable before the Three Clarities. But the gods of the Five Peaks and Water Palaces—how can this be deemed proper afterward?

Those who conduct ritual fasts, not knowing where to direct their devotion, have thus incorporated rites for the Azure Emperor of the East, the White Emperor of the West, the Vermilion Emperor of the South, the Dark Emperor of the North, the Great Emperor of Fengdu, and the Heavenly King Yama, all subsumed under general repentance rituals. Yet when one undertakes a Daoist fast, one ought to uphold the precepts and the Dharma. The boundless deliverance and the subtle prohibitions of the Dharma are to be observed: one must restrain one’s thoughts, subdue the mind, and attain purity. Thereby transgressions and defilements are dissolved, and wisdom arises of itself. One escapes the perils of birth and death and attains the realm of non-action. One deeply contemplates the arising of phenomena and examines their cessation. According to the affliction, one applies the medicine of wisdom. If one sees forms of profit, one covers the eyes with precepts; if one hears evil speech, one stops the ears with precepts; if one craves sweet fragrances, one seals the mouth with precepts; if one indulges in passions, one subdues the heart with precepts; if one inclines toward evil deeds, one restrains the feet with precepts. If the body does not transgress the precepts, one transcends the snares of the dusty world and may be called one who perfects the hundred practices and establishes the ten thousand virtues. Only after receiving and upholding the pure precepts may one engage in fasting, still the thoughts, and turn the hearing inward to introspect. The mouth does not speak idly, the body does not move recklessly. Thus, the color of the colorless is seen; the sound of the soundless is heard; the sweetness of the tasteless is savored; the response of the wordless is received. The divine spirits descend, and blessings arrive. For blessings not yet manifest, no wish remains unfulfilled.

If, however, one outwardly fails to uphold dignified deportment and inwardly neglects the precepts, with conduct unworthy of record and merit unworthy of manifestation, lacking sincerity and harboring doubt, with inner and outer not in accord, heart and mouth at variance, temper hasty and disposition perverse, secretly envious and arrogantly jealous—if the thoughts are wearied by external distractions and the spirit consumed by excessive desires—then even if one engages in fasting, one will gain no blessing throughout life. For the mind is not inwardly present, and the hun and po are labored by external affairs. Without the harmonious *qi* as master, nothing can be moved to response.

In the rituals of fasting and reciting precepts, both the altar officers and the fast’s sponsor must each uphold their duties—how can distinctions be made? Ziyun Guang claims never to have seen the *Sutra of the Supreme Precepts of Wisdom*, asserting that merely listening to the precepts’ words does not accord with the intent of the fast, and that one should first receive the precepts of ordination before proceeding. Yet those who conduct fasts, from the outset seeking novelty and indulging in extravagance, have thus introduced transgressions such as slackening in dignified deportment when ascending the altar or causing commotion at the outset of entering stillness.

Burning incense and pacing the Dao, repenting sins and confessing faults—this is called a *zhai* (fast). Inviting the perfected and descending the sages, beseeching grace and requesting blessings—this is called a *jiao* (offering). The ritual protocols of *zhai* and *jiao* must not be conflated. Yet Ziyun Guang claims that the *zhai* is simply an audience with the perfected, equivalent to the state’s sacrifices, differing only in the use of incense, vegetables, and ritual meats—this is a complete failure to recognize the origins and development of the fast’s Dharma. How can this not be astonishing?

The selection of the six offices, if following the old texts of Master Lu, admits no dispute. Yet in recent times, the *doujiang* (lecturer) has been allowed to fill the six offices, and beneath the offices, clauses such as “after discussion by the upper and lower assemblies, so-and-so is appointed” have been added, which is highly problematic. How can the *gaogong* (high priest) be a position that can be filled by popular consensus? Now all is to be reverted to Master Lu’s original regulations, to spare later generations from confusion.

Next, the *doujiang* chants, and the assembly of officers sits in order. The thirty-six prohibitions of dignified deportment are proclaimed, drawn from the *Sutra of the Supreme Ultimate’s Dignified Deportment*. The Dharma Master says: The Dharma of the fast is pure and empty, and its prohibitions are most weighty. The sponsor must sweep and purify the halls, striving for utmost cleanliness. They must command all, within and without, to be silent. They must not allow incense or oil to be lacking, nor the ritual implements to be deficient. Daoists entering the fast must each bring their own towel, robe, tablet, and shoes; they may not exchange them at the last moment. If there is a deficiency in public duties, they must not appropriate the garments of others.

When Daoists enter the fast, in all their movements—rising, sitting, coming, and going—they must report to the *jianzhai* (fast supervisor), bow once to the Dharma Master, and bow three times to the incense before departing. The same is observed upon returning. Master Zhang Wanfu says: One does not presume to point to the Three Treasures, hence one bows to the incense.

If one arrives at the fast hall with disordered shoes, one is fined two *jin* of oil, equivalent to twenty bows. The recipient of the bows may choose to accept the fine in its original form or in incense and oil. For those who comply with the fine, it is permitted. If one’s sitting and rising are disorderly, one is fined half a *sheng* of oil, equivalent to five bows. If one does not sit properly, one is fined half a *liang* of cinnabar, equivalent to five bows. If, during the performance of rituals, one speaks with outsiders, one is fined one *jin* of incense, equivalent to twenty bows. If one disturbs the incense fire, one is fined half a *jin* of incense, equivalent to ten bows. If one discusses worldly affairs, one is fined one *jin* of incense, equivalent to twenty bows. If one engages in frivolous speech or laughter, one is fined one *liang* of cinnabar, equivalent to ten bows. If one speaks coarsely or dozes, one is fined half a *liang* of cinnabar, equivalent to five bows. If one spills lamp oil, one is fined five *sheng* of oil, equivalent to fifty bows. If one’s towel or robe is disordered, one is fined half a *jin* of incense, equivalent to ten bows. If the *doujiang* errs in chanting, one is fined one *jin* of incense, equivalent to twenty bows. If the enforcer of discipline sees a transgression but does not admonish private faults, one is fined six *sheng* of oil, equivalent to sixty bows. If one attending the scriptures does not properly adorn the high seat or damages objects, one is fined half a *jin* of incense, equivalent to ten bows. If one attending the incense allows the incense smoke to break off, one is fined four *sheng* of oil, equivalent to forty bows. If one attending the lamps allows the lamp fire to extinguish, one is fined one *jin* of incense, equivalent to twenty bows. If the fast’s sponsor fails to supervise within and without, causing loud voices, one is fined five *sheng* of oil, equivalent to fifty bows. If one listens to the scriptures while leaning or not holding a tablet, one is fined one *sheng* of oil, equivalent to ten bows. If one’s attention is not fixed on purity and emptiness, and one’s thoughts and mind grow weary, as noticed by the assembly, one is fined three *sheng* of oil, equivalent to thirty bows. If one enters or exits the fast hall without reporting to the *jianzhai*, one is fined two *jin* of oil, equivalent to twenty bows.

If one lets their hair hang loose and walks hurriedly, one is fined one *jin* of incense, equivalent to twenty bows. If one recites scriptures in disorder, asks questions that disrupt the verses, one is fined three *sheng* of oil, equivalent to thirty bows. If the chanting voices are not in unison, one is fined two *sheng* of oil, equivalent to twenty bows. If one ascends the altar without washing hands or rinsing the mouth, one is fined two *jin* of oil, equivalent to twenty bows. If one’s sitting, rising, bowing, or yielding lacks proper decorum, one is fined half a *sheng* of oil, equivalent to five bows. If one circles the altar out of order or walks against the flow, one is fined half a *jin* of incense, equivalent to ten bows. If one rises, approaches, or returns to their seat without bowing to the scriptures three times before departing, one is fined one *jin* of incense, equivalent to twenty bows. If one rushes forward while burning incense, one is fined one *sheng* of oil, equivalent to ten bows. If the fast’s sponsor fails in their preparations, leaving matters incomplete, one is fined one *jin* of incense, equivalent to twenty bows. If one receives a report but does not relay it to superiors, one is fined three *jin* of oil, equivalent to thirty bows. If during the fast one leaves and does not return, having been reprimanded by the assembly, one is fined five *jin* of incense, equivalent to one hundred bows. If one violates the rules of decorum and refuses to accept the penalty, one shall report to the Three Treasures and be expelled from the fast.

If the lower-ranking officials in attendance neglect the rites, penalties shall be imposed as follows: for one to three offenses, fines shall be levied according to the regulations; for more than three offenses, one shall be expelled from the fast. Those responsible for enforcement who fail to report violations shall be punished equally with the offenders. If the presiding Dharma Master neglects their duties, they shall acknowledge their fault and submit a tablet to the *jianzhai*. For one to three offenses, fines shall be levied according to the regulations; for more than three offenses, their merit shall be revoked for three hundred days, and they shall not again occupy the Dharma seat.

The Supreme Master of the Great Ultimate states: All these prohibitions and regulations are ancient statutes from the Mysterious Capital’s Upper Palace, meant to restrain laziness and negligence and to correct transgressions. When establishing a fast, the Four Heavenly Kings and the Perfected Saints of the Celestial Realms personally descend to the fast’s location to witness the rites and circumambulation. They observe one’s conduct and examine one’s sincerity. If faults are found, they command the Four Departments and Five Emperors to report to the Three Officials, who shall investigate and impose punishment accordingly. The Heavenly Worthy, in great compassion, pities the foolishness of the world and does not wish for them to incur guilt through the fast. Thus, the path of penalties and corrections is opened, allowing one to recognize their faults. If one can reform, their sins shall also be dissolved. Those who receive penalties must accept them willingly, listen respectfully, and not conceal their wrongdoing or contend against the divine. In this way, discipline is upheld, misfortunes are averted, past sins are absolved, and future blessings are extended. One must proceed with utmost care, reverent and vigilant day and night.

If one personally serves the Great Sage or attends the sovereign in person, the divine spirits shall respond, and blessings shall gather abundantly. Those who participate in the fast must take heed and be warned.

From the *Lingbao Regulations of the Mysterious Capital*.

Next, the *dujiang* chants, and the *jianzhai* receives the penalty tablet. The *jianzhai* bows three times upon receiving the tablet and rises.

Next, the incense is replenished. The Incense Official, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, and the various spirit officials of the incense shall cause the site of the Yellow Register Fast altar to naturally produce golden liquid, cinnabar, and azure mushrooms, where the hundred spirits and perfected beings gather before the incense burner. May the merit of the fast be accomplished, and may both the living and the deceased receive its grace. May the jade maidens and immortal youths of the ten directions guard the incense smoke. May the prayers just offered be transmitted directly to the presence of the Most High, the Limitless Dao, the Perfectly Real Jade Emperor.

Next, the *Hymn to the Empty Cavern of Immortal Learning* is recited, exiting the altar. From the *Scripture of Pacing the Void* and the *Scripture of the Empty Cavern’s Numinous Chapters*.

Next, the Dharma Master exits the door, recites the spell, and waits for the officials to leave the earthen portal. Facing the altar, they recite the secret incantation within the portal.

Next, they pay respects at the curtain before the Mysterious Master. The High Priest offers three pinches of incense and makes a brief report. They acknowledge their faults with three bows. From the *Du Guangcheng Ritual*.

Next, the dedication of merit.

Next, the *dujiang* chants, and the *jianzhai* reports any violations. The *jianzhai* speaks if there are any, remains silent if there are none.

Next, the *dujiang* chants the conclusion of the fast’s proceedings, and the officials return to their positions.

Next, the decorum for welcoming the Master back to the hall, where the fast’s sponsor and disciples offer thanks to the Dharma Master.

Master Du Guangcheng states: Once the fast’s conclusion is announced, the officials, the fast’s sponsor, and the disciples shall offer thanks to the Dharma Master and congratulate one another. The disciples must offer their reverence sincerely and not behave arrogantly or with self-importance. From the establishment of the fast until its dispersal, when the Dharma Master ascends the altar to recite scriptures and circumambulate, they shall don court robes and wear the *yuan* crown. Upon completion of the rites, the officials shall be regarded as the altar’s hosts. Even if the officials bow, the Dharma Master shall not return the gesture. This practice has long been observed on Mount Mao and the Five Peaks. In the regions of Min and Shu, it has not yet been fully implemented. If mutual bows are exchanged, how can the proper decorum be maintained? For now, we shall follow this practice to preserve the regulations. After the altar is dispersed, all may return to normal.

The sixteenth scroll of the *Complete Ritual for the Supreme Yellow Register Great Fast* is concluded.
The seventeenth scroll of the *Complete Ritual for the Supreme Yellow Register Great Fast*.

The Master of the Three Caverns of Supreme Clarity, Li Jingqi, established the regulations; the Master of the Three Caverns, Chongjing, transmitted and preserved them; the Celestial Enforcer of the Most High, Jiang Shuyu, revised them.

**Section Two of the Ritual Codes: Ancient Rite for the Three Times of Circumambulation**

The Dharma Master sits in the hall while disciples perform the nine bows and three prostrations. With incense, flowers, and the *Huaxia* hymn, the Master is escorted from the hall. They proceed to the six curtains, following the rites of the previous evening’s invocation.

The Dharma Master moves to the left and enters the altar through the Earth Gate.

**Incantation for Entering the Gate**

Next, the *Huaxia* hymn is chanted as the Master circumambulates leftward into the altar, ascending through the Heavenly Gate. They offer incense to the ten directions, beginning with the East.

**Incense at the Master’s Table**

Then, the High Priest recites the Five Directions’ *Guardian Spirits Incantations* from the *Wondrous Scripture of the Essential Exegesis of the True Writ*:

**East**
Nine *qi* of the Azure Heavens, great deities of the Radiant Star.
Shining upon the eastern quarter, illuminating the nine gates.

Reporting above to the Imperial Lord, upholding the true Dao and the vermilion script of jade.
The talismanic command of the Nine Heavens dispatches dragons in swift transmission.
All under heaven is pacified; I attain transcendence and flight.

**South**
Cinnabar Heavens of the South, three *qi* flowing with light.

Preserving heaven’s eternity, enduring for aeons without end.

**West**
Heavens of the Seven *qi*, essence of Venus flowing bright.
Light gleams at the Golden Gate, illuminating the Great Darkness.

The Black Spirit, clad in dark feathers, attends the five gates.
Inspecting essences and capturing wrongs, none dare test their might.
The *Huoluo* blades sever and crush; the jade talisman commands.
The Eight Might of the Divine Spirits seals the gates of evil; the true Dao shines forth.
Illuminating my body, the Three Lights unite in splendor.
Spurring the void and riding the floating, my form ascends in transcendence.

**Center**
The Yellow Center governs *qi*, unifying the mysterious and true.
The Star of Stability radiates, its brilliance flowing through the Nine Heavens.
Twelve Luminous Youths open the light, primordial *qi* and yang essence.
Crimson flames ascend; illuminating all under heaven and my body.
A hundred evils are crushed, myriad ghosts slain.
The incantation of the Central Mountain universally prevails.
The Five Spirits are pacified; my body ascends as an immortal.

Next, the Precentor chants while the Dharma Drum is struck twenty-four times.
Then, the High Priest performs the threefold divination with incense and offers the incense prayer.
Finally, the incense burner is kindled.

sunk in the final age’s toils,
indulging in fleeting pleasures and glory,
bound by karmic causes from past lives.

Suddenly granted deliverance, we have been privileged to serve the Great Dao.
*(Here concludes* The Ritual Code of the Supreme Ultimate Fast.*)*

Overwhelmed by the weight of such grace, joy and awe intertwine within us. On the day we received the Dharma, we pledged to uphold the Mysterious Decree, to manifest our cinnabar sincerity, to spread and flourish the true wind, and to broadly proclaim its benevolent blessings. With compassionate hearts, we cherish all beings and open the path of deliverance for heaven and humanity.

Now, there is a certain official of such-and-such prefecture and such-and-such county, who, on behalf of the departed spirit so-and-so, requests the performance of the Supreme Yellow Register Grand Fast. In strict accordance with the ritual statutes, we present golden dragons and painted silks, incense, flowers, oil, and candles as offerings to attest our cinnabar sincerity and to beseech the fulfillment of our prayers.

We, unworthy as we are in our offices of the Mysterious Bureau, are unequal to what we have witnessed. Reverently, we bathe our five limbs and purify our hearts with right mindfulness. Following the *Divine Immortal Statutes of the Yellow Register Liturgy of the Lower Prime*, we establish the Imperial Altar at such-and-such place to perform the Supreme Yellow Register Grand Fast for three days and three nights, conducting the Dao nine times at the nine hours. Beneath the radiance of the Three Luminaries, we prostrate ourselves before the Ten Poles. We burn incense and light lamps, recite scriptures and invoke the Perfected, to deliver the departed spirit so-and-so—disciple such-and-such—and the ancestral and primal spirits of his lineage, along with all the long-night dead souls of the Nine Dark Realms. We repent sins and seek forgiveness, that they may depart from suffering and ascend to joy. May the profound grace extend to the state and the household, bestowing blessings upon the living. May all sentient beings universally attain the fruit of the Dao.

We reverently invoke the celestial hosts: the celestial armies of the Three Caverns, the terrestrial immortals’ armies, the flying immortals’ armies, the Perfected Ones’ armies, the divine beings’ armies, the armies of the sun, moon, and stars, the armies of the Nine Palaces and Five Emperors, the armies of the Three Rivers and Four Seas, and the armies of the Five Peaks and Four Waterways—each numbering nine hundred million legions. From the Thirty-Two Heavens, we summon the overseers of the fast, the golden youths who attend incense, the jade maidens who scatter flowers, the direct talismans of the Five Emperors, the messengers who transmit words and memorials, the flying dragon riders, and others—thirty-two in all—to descend in full assembly and fill the fast’s precincts. For the fast’s sponsor, so-and-so, we deliver the departed spirit so-and-so, along with the nine generations of ancestors, the destitute souls, and the suffering shades, that they may escape the long night of the Nine Dark Realms, sever the roots of sin, and depart from the Three Paths and Five Sufferings, their bodies entering into light. May they ascend to the heavens, where clothing and sustenance arise naturally. May they turn the wheel of rebirth and enter the gate of blessings and felicity.

The fast’s sponsor, so-and-so, now offers sincerity and devotion, entrusting life to the boundless worlds of the ten directions, to the hosts of great sages who have attained the Dao, to the perfected lords and venerable masters, and to the divine officials of the ten directions. We pray that wishes be fulfilled and the self delivered; that the Three Calamities and Nine Tribulations, the Ten Sorrows and Eight Hardships, be removed from this moment onward, all emerging from the multitude of evils recorded in the Yellow Register scriptures. May the state be secured and the household pacified, and may all sentient beings universally benefit.

When the Dao rituals are complete, those who have rendered meritorious service shall be reported back to the celestial bureaus. The functionaries and messengers, the flying dragon riders, shall separately file and transmit the records in due time, and upon the conclusion of the memorials, each shall return to reside within us, restoring themselves to their palaces. When summoned again, they shall arrive as before, in accordance with precedent.

Three rolls of the dharma drum are sounded, and the saliva is swallowed three times.

On the first day of the fast, the divine officials are sent forth at dawn. The same does not apply thereafter.

Daoists who have not received the Lingbao scriptures, who have not received the Registers of the Covenant of Uniting the Powers, may not dispatch divine officials to conduct the fast.

The dispatch of divine officials follows the regulations of the Three Caverns, where the registers and ranks differ, and the Perfected Officials vary accordingly. Each shall dispatch the immortal officers and soldiers corresponding to the registers they have received.

For the establishment of a Lingbao fast, the officials of the Covenant of Uniting the Powers and the governors of the central bureaus are dispatched. Thus, the regulations state that those who have received the Registers of the Covenant of Uniting the Powers may only be designated as officiants of the fast. This is because for an Upper Clarity fast, the five divine officials of the Covenant of the Lingbao Cavern Mystery are dispatched.

The Dao’s evolution begins with the Orthodox Unity, unfolds through the Cavern Spirit, permeates the Numinous Treasure, and culminates in the Upper Clarity. The Upper Clarity conceals its radiance and veils its light, refining the spirit to ascend the Dao. Its aspiration is to rise lightly, entirely untouched by the mundane. The Cavern Spirit commands and employs divine spirits, subduing demons and pestilence, yet in matters of deliverance, it is no longer concerned. The Yang Light expounds the Dao and virtue in their natural state, investigating the true nature of the profound mystery. With a tranquil mind, one cultivates and refines, aligning with the Dao. To cultivate the self and preserve life, to deliver heaven and humanity—nothing surpasses the Lingbao fast.

Those who receive the Dao must first receive the Three and Five Registers of the Covenant of Uniting the Powers. Only after gradual cultivation may they advance to receive the Middle Covenant of the Lingbao and the various registers of the Upper Clarity Great Cavern. Otherwise, it is an overstepping and usurpation, violating the standards of the Supreme Perfected. Yet today’s Daoist clergy fail to comprehend this. The Most High, in compassion, expounded the teachings, but they are wholly preoccupied with profit. The covenants of the Upper Clarity and Lingbao, the weight of the golden pledges—these are not to be trifled with. Yet some rely on a single register’s text received at a lineage altar, calling themselves disciples of such-and-such register and officiating fasts. Others, having received only the Registers of the Covenant of Ascending the Mystery, presume to dispatch the divine officials of the Lingbao fast. In distant regions and remote commanderies, this has become customary. Not only does this violate the celestial statutes, but it is also a gross deception of heaven.

The *Yi of Du Guangcheng* states: “Otherwise, the ten precepts, the white-slip Daoists, may not be appointed to office or ascend the altar. Those who usurp titles beyond their station shall incur karmic retribution in the unseen realm.” The sponsors of fasts shall not escape liability—how can they not be warned? Those who conduct fasts must painstakingly reform this.

Next, the lecturers and cantors each announce their dharma ranks:

[Dharma ranks] reverently conduct the Supreme Yellow Register Grand Fast. We, your subjects so-and-so and others, with sincere devotion, humbly memorialize the Boundless and Spontaneous Primordial Heavenly Venerable of the Limitless Dao, the Supreme Lord of the Limitless Dao, the Most High Lord Lao, the August Jade Emperor, the hosts of great sages who have attained the Dao in the ten directions, the perfected lords and venerable masters, the thirty-two Heavenly Emperors, the Jade Clarity Sovereign, the Great Emperor of Jade, the Eastern Florescence, Southern Culmen, Western Numinosity, Northern Perfection, the Seven-Treasured Mystic Terrace of the Purple Tenuity Upper Palace in the Jade Capital of the Mystic Metropolis, the Radiant August Lord of the Dao of the Numinous Treasure, the thirty-six divisions of the revered scriptures, the Great Dharma Masters of the Mystic Cavern, and all the divine officials of the three realms.

We, your subjects, by karmic affinity from past lives, were born in this great transformation. The Mystic Perfected initiated our deliverance, enabling us to enter the root of faith. Through the Three Masters, we received the covenant and the divine scriptures of the Three Treasures. The dharma accords with the deliverance of humanity—ninety-nine thousand nine hundred. Though we have attained the rank of the Perfected, our merit is slight and our virtue small, and we have not yet attained immortality. We dedicate our lives and bodies to assist the state and establish merit.

All the above follows the *Lingbao Jade Casket’s Regulations on Illuminating the Perfected*, and all matters of submission and memorialization are duly observed. Now, in accordance with the edict, we dare not withhold this from the celestial hearing.

Next, the proclamation is read:

In accordance with the words of the proclamation, with utmost sincerity and earnestness, we pray to rely on the great Dao to deliver the living and the dead. The fast’s sponsor, so-and-so, respectfully considers the departed spirit so-and-so, the nine generations of ancestors, and all destitute souls. In their lifetimes, their sins and transgressions were beyond reckoning. Upon death, they entered hell, forever without release.

We have heard that the Supreme Yellow Register Grand Fast surpasses all methods in merit and bestows boundless grace. Reverently following the mystic regulations, we offer golden dragon-patterned silks, the pledges of our destined lives, along with incense, flowers, oil, and candles, to manifest our sincere devotion. We beseech the deliverance of the nine generations of ancestors from the suffering of the long night. We pray for the profound protection that universally blesses the unseen and the manifest.

We, your subjects, reverently purify our thoughts and settle our spirits, concentrating our minds in silent contemplation.

Following the sacred protocols of the *Huanglu* Simplified Writs and the Ritual Codes of Transcendent Immortals, we establish the deliverance rites and arrange the numinous altar. The four quarters and eight directions mirror heaven and emulate earth. We erect the fast, perform the Dao, burn incense, and light lamps. Through repentance, we atone for the sins of the living and the dead across three generations. We dedicate this to the departed soul of so-and-so and to the myriad ancestors of the fast’s sponsor—bound spirits and those who died in confinement—opening for them the radiance of deliverance, releasing them from suffering. May they be freed from evil destinies and turn toward the root of faith.

Now we burn incense, taking refuge in the Venerable Masters, the Great Sages, and the assembly of perfected virtue, who after attaining the Dao ascended into formlessness, harmonizing with the true Dao.

The master and disciples turn left, thrice offering incense to the ten directions, then return to face east while the master intones:
We now, on behalf of the fast’s sponsor so-and-so, deliver the departed soul of so-and-so and the nine generations of ancestors—those confined in the Nine Dark Prisons of the Jade Vaults, the long-night abodes, the malevolent adversaries of the dead, and the karmic roots of past transgressions. Through the power of merit, we establish the fast, burn incense, and invoke the ten directions. May the departed so-and-so and the nine generations of ancestors of so-and-so’s family—those long-dead souls—be lifted from the darkness of suffering and ascend to the celestial halls.

Now we burn incense, surrendering body, spirit, and life to the Great Dao. We prostrate ourselves, taking refuge in the Three Supreme Ones. May this merit flow to the departed soul of so-and-so and the nine generations of ancestors of so-and-so’s family, all the dead souls. May they be spared the ten sufferings and eight adversities of the long night, behold the light, ascend to the celestial halls, and dwell in effortless abundance.

Now we burn incense, taking refuge in the Venerable Masters, the Great Sages, and the assembly of perfected virtue, who after attaining the Dao ascended into formlessness, harmonizing with the true Dao.

The master and disciples turn left, thrice offering incense to the ten directions, as before.

The Dharma Master intones:
We now, on behalf of the fast’s sponsor so-and-so, deliver the departed soul of so-and-so and the nine generations of ancestors—those confined in the Nine Dark Prisons of the Jade Vaults, the long-night abodes, the malevolent adversaries of the dead, and the karmic roots of past transgressions. Through the power of merit, we establish the fast, burn incense, and invoke the ten directions. May the departed so-and-so and the nine generations of ancestors of so-and-so’s family—those long-dead souls—be lifted from the darkness of suffering and ascend to the celestial halls. We extend this universally to the Emperor and lords of the realm, their ministers and officials, those who receive the Daoist teachings, parents and revered kin, fellow disciples, and all who dwell in mountain forests pursuing the true Dao. May each attain the true Dao, surrendering body, spirit, and life to the Great Dao.

We prostrate ourselves, taking refuge in the Three Supreme Ones. May this merit flow to the Emperor and lords of the realm, their ministers and officials, those who receive the Daoist teachings, parents and revered kin, fellow disciples, and all who dwell in mountain forests pursuing the true Dao. May each attain the true Dao and dwell in effortless tranquility.

Now we burn incense, taking refuge in the Venerable Masters, the Great Sages, and the assembly of perfected virtue, who after attaining the Dao ascended into formlessness, harmonizing with the true Dao.

The master and disciples turn left, thrice offering incense to the ten directions, as before.

The Dharma Master intones:
We now, on behalf of the fast’s sponsor so-and-so, deliver the departed soul of so-and-so and the nine generations of ancestors—those confined in the Nine Dark Prisons of the Jade Vaults, the long-night abodes, the malevolent adversaries of the dead, and the karmic roots of past transgressions. Through the power of merit, we establish the fast, burn incense, and invoke the ten directions. May the departed so-and-so and the lineage of so-and-so’s family, the nine clans and affinal kin, officials and people of the realm, fellow disciples and companions, all people under heaven, the flying and crawling, the creeping and resting, those already born and yet unborn—all beings—surrender body, spirit, and life to the Great Dao.

We prostrate ourselves, taking refuge in the Three Supreme Ones. May this merit flow to the disciple so-and-so, granting them immortal deliverance, their body entering effortlessness and harmonizing with the four great elements. May all people under heaven, the flying and crawling, those already born and yet unborn—all beings—be spared the ten sufferings and eight adversities, the five poisons and waters of fire, the ten calamities and myriad harms, the qi of bandits, epidemics, and ghosts, and the afflictions of punishment.

Now we burn incense, taking refuge in the Venerable Masters, the Great Sages, and the assembly of perfected virtue, who after attaining the Dao ascended into formlessness, harmonizing with the true Dao.

The above is drawn from the *Huanglu* Simplified Writs. The phrase “harmonizing with the true Dao” appears four times, all following the original text.

For the *Zhang Qingdu* rites, when offering incense thrice, one need not circumambulate. An attendant may hold the censer and proceed left, or the attendant may guide the fast’s sponsor to offer incense in each direction, which is more fitting. Generally, in performing the Dao, one must not occupy too much time. Excessive labor leads to slackness in ritual deportment, which in turn nullifies the merit.

The Supreme Lord transmitted the fast’s methods for those who study the Dao, seeking to repent sins and attain immortality, enabling mutual deliverance. Thus, in the fast’s rites of offering incense and reciting vows, after invoking the Emperor and lords of the realm, one must invoke the Three Masters, those who transmit the Daoist teachings, and fellow disciples. The *Huanglu* Simplified Writs’ standard protocols explicitly state, “We now act for the fellow practitioner so-and-so,” making this clear. Later generations have applied these rites to others, and while some wording may be slightly adjusted, the three offerings of incense and the invocations for the Emperor, masters, and fellow disciples must remain unchanged in all scriptures.

Kneeling in repentance:
We now burn incense, surrendering body, spirit, and life. Solemnly, on behalf of the sponsor of the *Huanglu* Grand Fast, so-and-so, we contemplate the departed soul of so-and-so and the nine generations of ancestors, all the dead souls. In their lifetimes, they committed grievous evils. Their sins bind them to the Nine Dark Hells of the Eternal Night, where souls endure the lash and every torment is fully inflicted. Their forms are broken and emaciated, their suffering unbearable. They sink into ten thousand kalpas, forever without release.

Now, in accordance with the *Alliance of Perfected Ones and the Jade Casket*, the *Chief Prohibitions Official of the Upper Palace of Lady Green*, and the *Rites of Salvation and Deliverance*, we present three hundred and twenty feet of azure-patterned silk, thirty-two feet of the same, and one golden dragon. We surrender our lives in devotion to the *Supreme Venerable Sovereign of the Dao of Numinous Treasure in the Infinite Upper Realm*, the Thirty-Two Heavenly Lords, the Perfected Ones and Jade Maidens of the Jade Capital and Mystic Capital’s Purple Tenuity Upper Palace, and the divine immortals and officials of the Upper Realm of the Infinite World. We beseech the deliverance and ransom of the departed soul of so-and-so and the nine generations of ancestors of the *Huanglu* Grand Fast’s sponsor, so-and-so, along with all the dead souls—eradicating their karmic roots of evil and transgressions, and annulling the reckonings of the Three Realms.

May the *Chief Prohibitions Official of the Upper Palace of Lady Green* expunge their records of sin, open the path to deliver the destitute souls, and guide their forms into radiant light. May they ascend to the Heavenly Halls, where clothing and sustenance arise naturally, and swiftly attain the gate of rebirth and blessed fortune. May so-and-so’s person attain the perfection of the Dao, harmonizing and uniting with the divine.

Next, to the Lower Realm:
We, the assembled officiants, wholeheartedly surrender our lives in devotion to the *Supreme Venerable Sovereign of the Dao of Numinous Treasure in the Infinite Lower Realm*, the August Sovereign of the Nine Lands and the Four Offices and Five Emperors, the Twelve Immortal Lords, the Perfected Ones of the Nine Palaces, the divine immortals and jade maidens, and the divine officials of the Lower Realm of the Infinite World. Each reverently repents.

We beseech the deliverance and redemption of the departed soul of so-and-so and the nine generations of ancestors of the sponsor of the *Huanglu* Grand Fast, so-and-so, along with all the dead souls. May their evil karmic roots and transgressions, recorded by the Three Realms’ Offices of Account, be erased by the Four Offices of the Lower Palace of Lady Qing and their enforcers. May the imprisoned souls be liberated, their forms entering radiance, ascending to the Heavenly Paradise where clothing and sustenance arise naturally. May so-and-so attain the Perfection of the Dao, harmonizing with the divine in shared luminosity.

The next day, facing the northeast, we chant the rites:

Kneeling in repentance:

We contemplate the departed soul of so-and-so and the nine generations of ancestors, all the dead souls, extending to so-and-so’s own person—all the transgressions committed in life, sins too numerous to recount. The dead souls, bound by karmic retribution, drift through the Eternal Night. In the Nine Dark Hells, they endure the lash, every torment fully inflicted. Their forms are broken and emaciated, their suffering unbearable. They sink into ten thousand kalpas, forever without release. We now burn incense and surrender body, spirit, and life to the *Solar Lord and Lady*, the *Flame Radiance Youth*, the *Vermilion Cloud Jade Maidens*, and the divine immortals within the sun.

We contemplate the departed soul of so-and-so and the nine generations of ancestors, all the dead souls—all the grievous evils and heinous transgressions committed in life, offenses against the divine immortals of Mount Tai and the Eastern Marchmount.

Sins bound in the Nine Dark Realms, exiled to toil under the Water Officials. Blocked in the long-flowing sources, imprisoned in the cold night, the soul endures suffering and torment, fully immersed in filth and agony. Eternally sunk through ten thousand kalpas, forever without release.

We, the assembled, wholeheartedly surrender body, spirit, and life to the *Thirty-Six Divisions of the Most Supreme and Perfect Sacred Scriptures*, the *True Writings and Treasure Talismans*, the *Natural Celestial Books*, the *Most Numinous Writings*, the *Divine Immortals Attending the Three Caverns*, and all the divine officials. Each reverently repents.

Kneeling in repentance:
We now surrender body, spirit, and life, solemnly on behalf of the sponsor of the *Huanglu* Grand Fast, so-and-so. We contemplate the departed soul of so-and-so and the nine generations of ancestors, all the dead souls—the karmic transgressions of past and present lives, the thoughts and intentions of the heart, the accumulated habits of manifold evils.

Body and speech mutually sustain each other, and with every action sin arises.
At the sight of forms and the hearing of sounds, defilements and delusions multiply.
Treading through suffering or encountering joy, confusion and obstacles ever arise.
We have violated the *Three Primes’* *One Hundred Eighty Precepts*, the *Twelve Thousand Rules of Dignity*, the *One Thousand Two Hundred Precepts of Conduct*—even those transgressions unrecorded in the ritual codes, unforgivable by law and decree.
Through kalpas unending, these sins have accumulated, compounding over vast eons.
What came before remains unrepented, and later offenses are heaped upon them.
Some were committed knowingly, others in error or unawares;
some were unintended, others forced upon us by others.
The retribution of sin and the bonds of evil entangle one another,
bringing birth after death, with sorrows and hardships endless and far-reaching.
The spirit sinks into the depths, bound forever without release.

Now, therefore, we burn incense and surrender body, spirit, and life to the *Thirty-Six Divisions of the Most Supreme and Perfect Sacred Scriptures*, the *Treasure Talismans and Jade Chapters*, the *Jade Lads and Jade Maidens*.
We beseech forgiveness and absolution for all offenses committed in life and death,
that through merit and power, the nine generations of sinful souls may be delivered,
freed from the *Three Wretched Realms* and the *Five Sufferings*—
from the *Mountains of Swords* and *Forests of Blades*, from the *Long Rivers* and *Frigid Courts*.
May their souls emerge from the dark night and enter into the light,
ascend to the heavens above, where clothing and sustenance come naturally,
and the self of so-and-so attains the perfection of the Dao.
Harmonized, they unite with the scriptures.

The *Twenty Directions’ Confession Texts*, from the East to the *Water Official*, are all drawn from the *Huanglu* *Simplified Scripture*. The *Thanksgiving to the Three Treasures and Sacred Scriptures’ Confession Text* is the *Great Thanksgiving Confession*. Since the ritual codes lack a *Great Thanksgiving*, Master Lu’s *Three Primes Fast* concludes the *Twenty Directions’ Confessions* and then returns the incense burner. The confession text giving thanks to the sacred scriptures is thus made the *Great Thanksgiving*. This practice began with Master Lu, who, following the *Taiyi* *Ritual of Solemn Dignity Scripture*, compiled the *Complete Rites for the Daoist’s Self-Cultivation and Alliance with the Perfected Fast*, and thereafter it became customary. The *Scripture and Treasure Confession Texts* must not be abandoned.

Now, following the *Zhang Qingdu Rites*, after the *Burning of Incense and Surrender of Body, Spirit, and Life*, we return to the original text of the *Huanglu* *Simplified Scripture*. The tradition of *Master Chongjing* and *Li Jingqi’s* ritual codes used only the *Ten Directions’ Great Thanksgiving Text* from the *Lingbao Natural Fast*, as found in the *Essential Exegesis of the True Writings*. This is now replaced with the *Twenty Directions’ Confession Texts* from the *Huanglu* *Simplified Scripture*. According to the original ritual code, for each direction honored, one bows and strikes the breast according to the number of that direction—such as ninety for the East, three hundred twenty for the Upper Realm, thirty for the Palace of the Sun, seventy for the Palace of the Moon, and one hundred twenty for the Water Palace.

Now, in conducting the grand fast, the rites vary, and with limited energy, full observance is difficult. The *Alliance with the Perfected in the Jade Casket*, the *Upper Palace of the Lady of Qing*, and the *Deliverance Ritual Codes* refer to the secret *Jade Casket* and the *Alliance with the Perfected Deliverance Rituals* hidden within the *Nine Dark Prisons of the Long Night*. When *Qu Gongxun* compiled the *Huanglu Offering Rites*, he listed *Alliance with the Perfected in the Jade Casket* first, stating that it was for swearing alliance with the Supreme Perfected and should be performed accordingly. The sealing of the *Jade Casket* signifies its secrecy—something he had never witnessed. The *Lingbao Scripture of the Jade Casket Alliance with the Perfected Ritual* has lost its original intent.

When conducting the fast and ascending the altar, if one encounters wind and rain, urgent emergencies, extreme heat or cold, violent thunderstorms, fierce winds, or darkening skies—any extraordinary events—after offering incense thrice, the assembled officials stand upright in their positions and use this *Ten Directions’, Five Peaks’, and Three Luminaries’ General Confession Text*. The *Water Official’s Scripture and Treasure* ritual code is not to be used except in unavoidable circumstances; otherwise, one risks violating the ritual prohibitions. Following the original rites for the Ten Directions, after completing the confessions for each, a general confession and thanksgiving is especially excellent.

We, the assembled, wholeheartedly surrender body, spirit, and life to the *Ten Directions’ Boundless Most Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy*, the *Ten Ultimate Heavenly Lords*, and the *Ten Realms’ Divine Immortals and All Divine Officials*. Each reverently repents.

Kneeling in repentance:

Their sins bind them in the *Nine Dark Prisons of the Long Night*, where their souls endure flogging and every torment.
Their forms are broken and emaciated, suffering unbearable pain.
They sink into endless kalpas, forever without release.

Now, in accordance with the *Alliance of Perfected Jade Casket* and the *Upper Palace of Lady Qing*, we present the ritual offerings for deliverance: one hundred thirty-six feet of patterned silk from the Ten Directions, and ten golden dragons. We reverently surrender body, spirit, and life to the *Ten Directions’ Boundless Most Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy*, the *Ten Ultimate Heavenly Lords*, and the *Ten Realms’ Divine Immortals and All Divine Officials*. We redeem and deliver the departed soul of so-and-so, the nine generations of ancestors of the sponsor of this *Huanglu* Grand Fast, and all the dead souls—eradicating their karmic roots of evil and transgressions recorded by the Three Realms’ reckoning officials.

May the *Upper Palace of Lady Qing* expunge their names from the ledgers of sin, liberate these destitute souls, and guide them into radiant light. May they ascend to the Heavenly Paradise, where clothing and sustenance arise naturally, and swiftly attain the gate of rebirth and blessed fortune. May so-and-so’s person attain the Perfected Dao, harmonizing and uniting with the divine.

**Water Officials** follow the original statutes.
**Scriptural Treasures** follow the original statutes.

Next, the *Dujang* chants, and each participant visualizes the nine-colored circular image, swallowing saliva to command the demons as recorded in the *Hidden Commentary on the Jade Scripture*. Then, the *Dujang* chants the esoteric incantation to summon the *Five Talisman Beings of Birds and Humans*.

First, strike the teeth three times and swallow saliva three times, visualizing the sun and moon before one’s face, entering the *Cavern Chamber’s Golden Flower Palace* through the nostrils. One inch inward between the brows lies the *Hall of Brightness*; two inches inward, the *Cavern Chamber*; three inches inward, the *Cinnabar Field*. North of the *Hall of Brightness* and south of the *Cavern Chamber*, one inch upward lies the *Golden Flower Palace*, from which radiant light emerges behind the neck, shimmering into a nine-colored circular image. It gently enters the *Jade Pillow*, illuminating the ten directions, and follows my distant scripture as it proceeds.

The sun enters through the left nostril, the moon through the right. Again, strike the teeth three times, swallow saliva three times, and recite the esoteric incantation: *Master Guangcheng of Du* said, "This incantation must not be heard by the ears. Those who transmit it carelessly will incur blame—be cautious, be cautious."

*"Within the Yellow Center, qi severs the lineage of evil;
Esoterically, it subdues strong essence and severs the Elder of Demons.
The Supreme has decreed, the Supreme Chamber summons;
Hasten the Northern Emperor to the Jade Palace.
Receive the majestic command to proclaim to the Demon Kings;
The five qi billow and surge, clashing with fate.
The secret jade script is now complete and flourishing.
The Three Heavens revolve in brightness, the Six Heavens reach their end.
How wise!"*

Next, the *Dujang* chants, and the assembly circumambulates in *BuXu* steps. Then, they recite the ten *BuXu* hymns of *Mount Jade Capital* from the *Scripture of the Numinous Treasure’s BuXu*, concluding each with a bow and a chant of *Shan*.

*Bowing in reverence to the Supreme,
Burning incense to surrender to emptiness.
Radiance flows and follows me in return;
The Dharma Wheel turns thrice as well.
Profound vows arise in the four directions,
Bringing numinous blessings to kings and lords.
Seven generations ascend to Heaven’s halls,
Resplendent, their glory unfurled.
Chanting and gazing upon the Great Void,
Heavenly music delights my joy.
Equal in fragrance is the supreme virtue,
With lower immortals I join in company.
Wondrous thoughts illumine dark awakening,
In orderly ranks we traverse the void.
Circling, we tread the cloud’s warp,
Riding the void, we step the dark records.
Chanting the hymn to the Emperor of Unity,
A hundred passages self-regulate.
Bending, I command the lads of the Eight Seas;
Uplifting, I grasp the lofty immortals’ hands.
The heavens scatter fragrant flowers,
A numinous wind arises, serene.
Long-held vows root destiny,
Thus attaining lofty eminence.
Rejoicing before the Supreme,
For ten thousand kalpas, plans never cease.*

*Towering, the Dark Capital’s mountain,
The ten directions revere its imperial unity.
Lofty, the Heavenly Treasure Terrace,
Its radiance blazes like the flowing sun.
Resplendent, the jade grove’s blossoms,
Vermilion fruits glow in dazzling hues.
Ever mindful to consume primordial essence,
Refining fluids to solidify form and substance.
Golden light scatters the Purple Tenuity,
Graceful, the Great Vehicle’s ease.
Looking up and down, I hold the Supreme in mind,
The Flowery Splendor flourishes in the Cinnabar Field.
Glancing left, I grasp Yu Yi;
Gazing right, I carry Jie Lin.
The Six Perfections crown the Brahman conduct,
Virtue and power renew with the sun.
Long-cultivated karmic blessings respond,
Hearing the scripture as if meeting kin.
Heaven-endowed with transcendent talent,
Delighting in reciting the subtle and profound.
The qi of supreme harmony, empty and tranquil,
Exhaling and inhaling the flowing rosy mist.
Fetal breathing stills the hundred passages,
In solitude, I master the three conveniences.
The Mud Pill’s cavern shines with bright scenes,
Thus becoming a Golden Flower immortal.
The Demon King respectfully receives his charge,
Thus able to ascend and pay homage to the heavens.
All begins with fasting and precepts,
Accumulating merit to bind past affinities.
Soaring through the vast void,
Uplifting the loftiest of beings.
Guiding the reins to the ten directions,
Resting in the dark and radiant vale.
Gazing up at the Kalpa Terrace,
Looking down upon the Purple Cloud Net.
Roaming the Supreme’s capital,
Together we sit upon lotus flowers.
Accumulating study to become a Perfected Person,
Serene, the guard and defense harmonize.
Forever enjoying boundless longevity,
Ten thousand *chun*—what abundance!
Contemplating the profound stillness of the Great Dao,
Ascending as an immortal, befriending the peerless.
The noble scion bestows the numinous talisman,
The Great One bears the cavern scripture.
The relic shines with golden form,
The dragon carriage suddenly arrives to welcome.
The Heavenly Worthy glances at the cloud chariot,
Floating, floating, riding the void in flight.
Fragrant flowers like drifting clouds,
Swirling and luxuriant upon the dark beam.
Bowing the head to the Golden Gate,
Hand in hand, we roam the Jade Capital.
The *Qian* Tree’s Round Radiance Garden,
Resplendent with the seven-jeweled grove.
Three hundred named heavenly beasts,
Lions vast as ten thousand *xun*.
Flying dragons pace and roar,
Divine phoenixes chant in rhythm.
A numinous wind fans the wondrous blossoms,
Pure fragrance scatters upon my lapels.
Without transcendent talent,
How could one indulge this heart?
I adorn my nine-dragon carriage,
Riding the void in carefree ease.
The Eight Heavens are like the palm of my hand,
The Six Directions—what distance?
The assembled immortals recite the *Cavern Mystery*,
The Supreme chants the pure hymn.
Fragrant flowers scatter with the wind,
Jade tones form the Purple Empyrean.
The Five Sufferings burst forth at once,
The Eight Difficulties follow the scripture’s void.
Wondrous indeed, the Numinous Treasure’s preserve,
Raising this great Dharma bridge.
The Heavenly Perfected’s Palace of Imperial Unity,
Lush with the crown of luminous spirits.
Flowing and radiant, the Dharma Wheel’s warp,
Circling the void, entering the formless.
The Void Emperor plucks the cloud zither,
The assembled Perfected recite the *Cavern Scripture*.
The lofty immortals, solemn in praise,
Through endless kalpas, preserve integrity.
The Utmost Perfected await nothing,
At times, they rein in flying dragons.
Long fasting gathers at the Dark Capital,
Jade chimes strike the jasper bells.
The Ten Flowers’ immortals assemble,
Purple mist congeals into a palace.
The jeweled canopy arrays before the Supreme,
Perfected Persons grasp the lotus.
Scattering flowers, I declare my vow,
Grasping the tally, I subdue the Demon King.
The Dharma drum assembles the immortals,
Numinous chants resound in unison.
There is no "can" or "cannot,"
Thoughts commune with the subtle and profound.*

Next, the *Dujang* chants: "We, your humble assembly, with utmost sincerity, surrender body and life to the *Supreme Three Worthies* and the *Saints of the Ten Directions*. We perform the ritual obeisance to the scriptures as prescribed."

Then, they recite the *Three Hymns of Invocation*, concluding each with a bow and a chant of *Shan*, as seen in the *Ritual for Establishing the Altar at Night*.

Next, the *Dujang* chants the *Three Bows*:
*"With utmost sincerity, we bow in reverence to the Supreme, Boundless, and Great Dao—one bow.
With utmost sincerity, we bow in reverence to the Utmost Perfected, Supreme *Thirty-Six Sections of the Venerable Scriptures*, the *True Writings and Numinous Talismans*—one bow.
With utmost sincerity, we bow in reverence to the *Supreme Three Worthies*, the *Saints of the Ten Directions*, and the *Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center*—one bow."*

Next, the *Dujang* chants, reiterating the ritual ranks. Then, the *High Merit Officer* offers profound thanks, kneeling in full ritual attire.

*"We, your humble assembly, respectfully reiterate and reverently address the *Supreme, Boundless, and Great Dao*, the *Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning*, the *Supreme Lord of the Great Dao*, the *Supreme Lord Lao*, the *Supreme and Mysterious Ancient One*, the *Celestial Worthies of the Ten Directions and the Boundless Great Dao of Virtue and Power*, the *Utmost Perfected Great Emperors*, the *Celestial Thearchs*, the *Thirty-Six Sections of the Venerable Scriptures*, the *Heavenly Master and Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center*, the *High Ministers and High Stewards*, the *Four Directors and Five Emperors*, the *Officials and Attendants of the Three Realms*, and all the Perfected and Numinous Beings."*

We, though unworthy and base, have been granted the privilege to partake in the supreme Dharma. Our merits are scant, while our transgressions accumulate like mountains. Truly, we should bind our bodies and await the punishments of the unseen. Yet from the day we received the Dao, we pledged our vows to the Three Officials: to propagate the mysterious wind of the Dao, to succor and protect both the hidden and the manifest, and to guide all beings universally into the Dharma gate.

Now, the patron of this retreat, so-and-so, in reverent concern for the departed spirit of so-and-so and the nine generations of ancestors, as well as all destitute souls—whose sins and defilements, accumulated across past lives and the present, have bound them in karmic retribution—find their numinous essence sunk in darkness. Without the merit of this retreat, there would be no means of repentance and deliverance. Bearing the tokens of the Dharma and pledging our sincere devotion, we beseech that the ancestors be delivered, freed from sorrow and suffering, that the souls of the long night may behold the light of the great sun, that the solitary spirits return to the womb, and that decayed bones be clothed anew in flesh. May all under heaven be bathed in the grace of the Dao.

As this is our ordained duty, how dare we fail to present this petition? Thus, in accordance with the *Lingxian Ordinances of the Lower Prime* and the *Huanglu Ritual Texts*, we reverently conduct this *Supreme Huanglu Grand Retreat* for so-and-so, lasting three days and three nights, with nine periods of ritual circumambulation. We recite the scriptures, perform repentance rites, burn incense, and light lamps, universally aiding both the living and the dead to redeem their sins and suffering.

With single-minded devotion, we take refuge in the *Supreme Great Dao* and the *Perfected Worthies*, humbly beseeching the vast compassion of your grace and the boundless favor of your mercy. We implore the absolution of the departed spirit of so-and-so, the patron’s household, their myriad ancestors, and all souls trapped in the long night—extending to their present selves, their families great and small, the people of the world, and all sentient beings. May the grave sins committed in life and death be pardoned:

Those who harmed rulers or fathers, failing in filial piety to their parents;
Those who betrayed teachers or deceived friends, abandoning truth for falsehood;
Those who rebelled against superiors or oppressed inferiors, slaughtering the innocent;
Those who ensnared living beings, waged war on families or nations;
Those who injured or killed creatures, framed the loyal and good, seized others’ treasures, or sundered families;
Those who indulged in licentiousness, conspired with clans, envied the worthy, or resented the capable;
Those who slandered the virtuous, burned or stole scriptures, defiled the Three Luminaries, or disdained the Four Great Elements;
Those who, as rulers, acted without the Dao, or as subjects, were disloyal;
Those who mocked the destitute, cruelly oppressed the people, cursed heaven and earth, or reviled the true and real;
Those who reviled spirits, raged at wind and rain, failed to honor the Dao or respect the elderly;
Those who aided wrongdoing or ridiculed good deeds;
Those whose hearts contradicted their words, deceiving even their own shadows;
Those whose sins deepened day by day, month by month, until their karmic obstacles became insurmountable.

If the patron’s household harbors other concealed transgressions they wish to repent, the master shall compose a text to be added here: from kalpa to kalpa, through rebirth after rebirth, the five desires and ten fetters, the six senses and three karmas, defying heaven and earth, breaking vows and betraying covenants. The roots of past suffering, entangled across lifetimes, drag them into the abyss of evil. Bound in litigation between the living and the dead, they are trapped in the unending wheel of rebirth, their souls tormented by interrogations, their bodies severed by the winds of judgment. Confined in the dark prisons, they endure every agony.

We now burn incense and perform the ritual circumambulation, repenting before the mysterious and true. May the sins listed above be dissolved and released according to each transgression. Relying on the *Celestial Worthies* and the *Heavenly Lords of the Ten Poles*, we present the patron so-and-so’s *Golden Dragon Silk Token of Deliverance*. We pray that the *Flying Heavenly Divine Kings* be dispatched with the *Nine Dragon Mandates* to proclaim to the *Nine Dark Realms of Fengdu*, the *Peaks of Mount Tai*, the *River Sources and Spring Bends*, the *Three Officials and Nine Bureaus*, the *One Hundred Twenty Offices*, the *Yin-Yang and Water-Fire Departments*, and the *Judges and Clerks of the Underworld*: upon receiving this mandate, may they release the imprisoned souls. May the departed spirit of so-and-so and the ancestral spirits of the patron’s household emerge from the long night, behold the light, extinguish their evil roots, and erase their names from the ledgers of sin. May their earthly bonds be severed, their watery oaths annulled, their ranks transferred to the *Vermilion Mound*, and their spirits refined in the *Cinnabar Fire*. Those destined for deliverance shall be delivered; those destined for rebirth shall be reborn. If they reside in blessed realms, may their merits increase. May all beings in the *Four Births*, *Five Paths*, *Six Destinies*, and *Three Wretched Realms* universally depart the dust of the mundane and ascend to transformation.

May the imprisoned officials, exiled criminals, and condemned prisoners, by the merit of this retreat, all attain purification and liberation. May they equally attain the fruit of true perfection and together ascend to the realm of bliss.

Our highest aspiration is that the *Three Luminaries* shine brightly, the *Two Modes* harmonize, the imperial reign be steadfast, and the harvests abundant. May floods, droughts, locusts, wars, banditry, and plagues never invade our borders, and may all within be preserved in peace. May the patron so-and-so, their family, and kin perpetually receive the mysterious protection of the Dao. May a thousand disasters be extinguished, and ten thousand virtues be nurtured. May all our supplications and prayers be heard, and all our repentances and thanksgivings be answered. Above, may the great compassion of the *Celestial Worthies* be manifest; below, may our sincerity in repentance and gratitude be reciprocated.

Respectfully submitted.

This *Great Repentance Text of the Lu Tian Shi’s Covenant Ritual* is derived from the *Scripture of Thanksgiving* within the canon, originally modeled after the *Tai Ji Ritual of Retreat Propagation*. The *Huanglu Ritual of Zhang Qingdu* presents its own *Great Thanksgiving*, though its wording is somewhat verbose. Thus, the version transmitted by Li Jingqi adopts the *Great Thanksgiving of Lu Tian Shi’s Covenant Ritual* as the *Great Thanksgiving Text for the Huanglu Retreat*, incorporating only a few phrases from the *Zhang Qingdu Ritual*. Indeed, Lu Tian Shi never composed a *Huanglu Retreat Ritual*—its repentance rites and ordinances are plain yet not ornate, its language difficult to read, and modern readers often mistake its austerity for antiquity.

In the year *Qingyuan Bingyin*, Liu Chongjing came to *Kuocang* to preside over the retreat at the home of Minister Wang Xi. Each time he read the *Great Thanksgiving*, the bereaved family, believing the deceased had committed no grave sins in life, questioned the necessity of such repentance. They failed to understand that the *Supreme* established the ritual of retreat and repentance to encompass the karmic origins of all beings in the Dharma realm, inspiring remorse. Where remorse takes shape, the heart of goodness naturally manifests. Thus are heaven and hell divided.

Entering yet never returning to the Dao.
All under heaven and earth are gathered into a single rite of repentance and vow—thus is it called the *Great Retreat*.
How could this be merely for the deceased, to beg mercy and repent sins?
Yet if the host of the retreat harbors dissatisfaction, this too contravenes the Supreme’s teaching, which adapts to the moment.

Du Guangcheng’s *Huanglu Retreat* served as a ritual for fellow disciples to practice the Dao, wherein he cited the *Precious Text of the Kuocang Repentance* for the *Great Thanksgiving*. Here, I have slightly refined it to ease comprehension. Yet where repentance of sins is concerned, I have faithfully repeated the scriptural language, that the retreat’s Dharma may endure for eternal kalpas.

Next: The Rekindling of the Censer
Fragrant officials and envoys, Lords of the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger, and all attending spirit-officials—
At this place where the retreat is held, may the golden elixir, cinnabar mushrooms, and azure fungi arise naturally. May the hundred spirits and host of perfected ones gather here before the incense burner.
May the host of this retreat, both living and deceased, receive blessings, and may the state and household be graced with favor.
May the jade maidens and immortal youths of the ten directions attend the fragrant smoke, conveying the petitions just offered directly to the Celestial Venerable of the Supreme, Boundless Dao, the Most High Jade Emperor.

Next: The *Hymn to the Study of Immortality*; exiting the altar, the *Ritual of Master Zhang Wanfu of the Ten Thousand Blessings* is employed, followed by the *Hymn of Precepts*
Next: The *Exiting-the-Door Mantra*
Next: The *Hymn of the Empty Cavern*, leading the assembly to form ranks before the Mysterious Master; the High Priest offers a brief apology and performs the three prostrations
Next: The *Hymn of Dedication*
Next: The *Retreat Overseer’s Correction of Faults*—whether faults are present or not is noted.
If none: "The altar assembly has upheld the Dharma in perfect completion, fortunately avoiding omissions or errors."
If present: The Dharma Master is informed and presents the tally.
The offender approaches the Master, bows twice, kneels to receive the tally, then retreats to the scripture table to perform the prescribed prostrations.

Upon the completion of the designated days of the retreat, whether at midnight of that day or at dawn the following morning, the assembled officials proceed in ranks before the Original Master. Then:

The *Hymn of the Dao* is intoned,
Followed by the *Hymn of Splendor*, leading the Dharma Master to ascend the altar and recite the *Entering the Door Mantra*.
Next, ascending through the Earthly Gate to the Heavenly Portal, they offer incense to the Ten Directions,
Then recite the *Incense Mantra for the Imperial Table*.
The Precentor chants, and each pays homage to the Master while maintaining proper contemplation.
Next, the *Mantra of the Five Directions’ Guardian Spirits* is proclaimed.
The Precentor chants again, and the *Dharma Drum* is sounded twenty-four times.
Then the *Three-Pinch Incense Mantra* is recited,
Followed by the *Opening of the Brazier*.

"To the Supreme Three Heavens, the Primordial Origin, the Three Qi of the Most High Lord Lao: we summon forth the Three and Five Merit Officers within our bodies, the Left and Right Attendant Envoys, the Left and Right Incense-Bearing Dragon-Riding Couriers, the Golden Lads of Incense, the Jade Maidens of Scattered Flowers, the Five Thearchs’ Direct Attendants, and the Incense Officials of the Day—thirty-six each in number—to emerge. Let those who emerge be arrayed in solemn attire. We now open the gates and invoke the True Officials and Divine Rulers of this land and domain. As we now burn incense, we do so on behalf of the assembled officials [names] who have undertaken the Supreme Huanglu Great Retreat for three days and three nights, conducting the Nine-Period Dao Procession. The rites are complete, and we now report our merit. May the life-generating qi of the Most High’s Ten Directions and True Perfected Ones descend and flow into our bodies, that our petition may swiftly ascend to the presence of the Most High, the Boundless Dao, the Utmost True Jade Thearch of the August Emperor."

Each performs the Three Bows.
Then the Dharma Master and disciples offer incense to the Ten Directions.

Then the Cantor intones, and each declares their dharma rank and full title, performing the merit-reporting rites of the Supreme Huanglu Great Retreat. We, [name] and the assembled, now burn incense once more, dedicating this merit to the Son of Heaven and the feudal lords, the local officials and magistrates, the masters of scriptures and ordination, the Daoist adepts dwelling in mountains and caves, fellow students of the Dao, the disciples of [name] and the departed souls they commend, the nine generations of ancestors, both the living and the dead, all kin and affines, inner and outer clans, the people of the world, all creatures that fly and crawl, and every sentient being. Now we hold the incense, taking refuge in body, spirit, and life, in the Most High’s Ten Directions and the Numinous Treasure’s Natural, Utmost True, and Supreme Dao. We humbly beseech the absolution of all transgressions—past and present, in life and death, and all grave offenses. May we be delivered from the Three Evil Paths, the Ten Sufferings, the Eight Adversities, and the Nine Calamities. May our bodies attain the True Dao, soaring through the void. May we ascend to heaven in broad daylight, serving the Dao Lords, and roaming freely in the Supreme Golden Towers and the Seven Treasures’ Natural Palaces, forever united with the Dao. May our profound invocation swiftly ascend to the presence of the Utmost True and Boundless Dao.

Then the Cantor intones, and all pay homage to the Ten Directions:
With utmost sincerity, we take refuge in the Eastern Direction’s Boundless, Most High, Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy—one bow. The remaining nine directions likewise.

Then the Cantor intones, and each takes refuge and repents, the Dharma Master kneeling in confession:
We, the assembled, wholeheartedly take refuge in body in the Boundless, Supreme Dao and Heavenly Worthy. We repent for the Retreat Master [name], the assembled, and all sentient beings, for all transgressions of body—past and present—where our four limbs and actions have violated the precepts, strayed from the scriptures, and incurred grave karmic sins, boundless and immeasurable. We beseech their complete dissolution. May the Retreat Master [name], the assembled, and all sentient beings enter the realm of the Perfected Immortals and unite with the True Dao.
We bow in reverence and gratitude to the Most High’s Ten Directions and the True Three Treasures—one bow.

We, the assembled, wholeheartedly take refuge in spirit in the Boundless, Supreme Dao and Heavenly Worthy. We repent for the Retreat Master [name], the assembled, and all sentient beings, for all transgressions of mind—past and present—where our thoughts and intentions were scattered, our emotions restless, and our minds ceaselessly wandering, incurring grave karmic sins, boundless and immeasurable. We beseech their complete dissolution. May the Retreat Master [name], the assembled, and all sentient beings unite with the True Quiescence and penetrate the Natural.
We bow in reverence and gratitude to the Most High’s Ten Directions and the True Three Treasures—one bow.

We, the assembled, wholeheartedly take refuge in life in the Boundless, Supreme Dao and Heavenly Worthy. We repent for the Retreat Master [name], the assembled, and all sentient beings, for all transgressions of speech—past and present—where we have argued over right and wrong, embellished falsehoods with ornate words, and deceived the multitude with flowery rhetoric, incurring grave karmic sins, boundless and immeasurable. We beseech their complete dissolution. May the Retreat Master [name], the assembled, and all sentient beings unite their nature and life with the Dao, merging with the Profound and Non-Action.
We bow in reverence and gratitude to the Most High’s Ten Directions and the True Three Treasures—one bow.

Then the Cantor intones:
We, the assembled, wholeheartedly take refuge in the Most High’s Three Worthies and the Ten Directions’ Host of Sages. We perform the ritual in accordance with the scriptures.

Then three invocations are chanted, each followed by a hymn.

Then the Cantor intones, and all perform the Three Bows.

Next, proceed with the circumambulation, retrieving the True Writs of the Five Directions. Upon completing the recitation for each direction, have a disciple hold the True Writ over the incense to fumigate it. Strike the teeth twelve times and recite the Jade Seal Incantation. It is said that for any prayer or exorcism, if one does not first strike the teeth before reciting the incantation, external demons will interfere, and the gates of heaven will remain unopened, unresponsive.

**The Incantation:**
O Most High and Perfectly True, Great Sage and Lofty Venerable,
Who spreads transformation and circulates qi through the Thirty-Two Heavens,
Whose Eight Assemblies and Nine Radiances naturally form the Writ,
Pacifying and securing heaven and earth, preserving and governing the kalpas.
The Mandate of the Primordial Beginning is universally proclaimed to the Three Origins.
Below, it commands the Nine Earths; above, it seals the myriad heavens.
At its center, it announces to the seas and mountains, the great peaks and rivers.
Today, this supreme proclamation is heard by all spirits.
Disciple [Name], conducting the Retreat and practicing the Dao,
Liberates and delivers the hidden souls, the Three Offices and Nine Bureaus,
Eradicates the roots of sin, eternally crossing the Three Wretched Paths.
The source of the Five Sufferings, may they receive blessings for generations.
Their names inscribed in the Crimson Register, their spirits born in heaven.
Refined and transformed by nature, the gates of life and death are opened.
Preserved for countless kalpas, the Mandate of the Nine Heavens is transmitted by wind and fire couriers.

All respond three times. This is from the *Inner Sounds of the Numinous Treasure Jade Seal*. After the incantation, place the writ upon the incense table, and following the memorial, burn it. Scatter the ashes amidst the azure smoke.

Next, the Cantor strikes the Dharma drum twenty-four times. The High Master strikes the teeth, closes the eyes, swallows saliva, and visualizes the method of the Nine Qi’s radiant splendor.

Then the Cantor, once more invoking the Dharma rank of Li Jing, performs the Three Bows and offers profound gratitude before presenting the memorial. This follows the Zhang Qingdu ritual, not the ancient method.

Assuming the Dharma rank, proceed with the Yellow Register Great Retreat’s merit-accruing memorial presentation.

**Memorial:**
Your humble servants [Names] reverently and sincerely address the Most High, Boundless Dao, the Primordial Celestial Venerable of the Origin; the Most High Lord of the Great Dao; the Most High Lord Lao; the Supreme and Mysterious Ancient of the Ten Directions; the Numinous Treasure Celestial Venerables; the Great Sage Assemblies who have attained the Dao; the Perfected Lords and Masters; the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures; the Heavenly Master of the Mysterious Center, the Great Dharma Master; the Prime Ministers and High Chancellors; the Four Offices and Five Emperors; the officials and attendants of the Three Realms; and all true spirits.

Since the kalpa of the Boundless, by karmic conditions, we have endured to this day. We have encountered the Great Dharma, the true scriptures descending into the world. Unworthy and undeserving, we have received the precious writs. Yet we have not transcended the mundane world, nor concealed our light in secluded forests. We have practiced long retreats and苦思, seeking lofty conduct, but remain entangled in worldly paths, indistinguishable from demonic and vulgar ways. Our bodies and speech have committed transgressions, accumulating faults without end. We constantly fear the arrival of judgment, ashamed before the hidden and manifest. Day and night, we tremble in dread, our forms and souls at a loss.

We know full well that the defiled are not those who contemplate the true. Yet from the day we received the Dharma, we vowed to exhaust our foolish sincerity, presenting this memorial to express our crimson devotion. We widely proclaim the wind of compassion, praising and extolling the wondrous transformation, universally guiding all to enter the Dharma gate. For all who take refuge, we shall transcribe and submit their names.

Now, in accordance with the imperial edict, how dare we not make this known above?

**Proclamation:**
As the words state, we are to be pitied. Your servants, leading one another, have followed the Yellow Register’s simple writ and the ancient canons of威仪. At the numinous altar of [Location], we have established the pattern of the Mysterious Rite, modeling heaven and earth. With the gold dragon silks and brocades brought here, we pacify the Ten Directions. The token of our life’s destiny serves as proof of our crimson devotion. We bathe our five limbs and purify our hearts, entering stillness and contemplation.

Beginning on the [Day] of this month at [Hour], we reverently conduct the Yellow Register Great Retreat for Deliverance, prostrating in ashes and dust, burning incense and reciting scriptures, lighting lamps to continue the radiance, illuminating the myriad heavens. For three days and nights, at nine intervals, we practice the Dao. We deliver the departed spirit [Name] and the nine generations of ancestors of disciple [Name]’s family, along with the karmic kin of countless kalpas. The hidden souls, suffering spirits, and karmic roots of past offenses—all are completed by the hour of Hai on [Day]. The merit is accomplished, the task fulfilled. Grace extends to the living and the dead, benefiting households and nations. Rewards for merit are bestowed, reaching all spirit offices.

Within your servants’ bodies, the inner and outer true officials, lords, generals, officers, and soldiers; the invited Numinous Treasure officials and attendants; the guardians of the retreat and true spirits; the celestial, terrestrial, and flying immortals; the perfected and divine persons; the sun, moon, and stars; the Nine Palaces and Five Emperors; the Three Rivers and Four Seas; the Five Peaks and Four Waterways; the cavalry and chariots; the myriad heavens’ overseers of the retreat; the golden youths attending incense; the jade maidens scattering flowers; the Five Emperors’ direct talismans and incense officials of the day; the flying dragon couriers transmitting words and memorials; and all officials, Dharma registers, governing ranks, lords, generals, officers, the four directions’ inspectors, local true officials, and spirits of the Three Realms—who have come and gone, transmitting memorials, overseeing and protecting, proclaiming and summoning, and safeguarding the retreat—have all labored diligently.

We respectfully present a memorial on yellow silk with vermilion text, ascending to the Three Heavenly Courts. We dissolve the altar, transfer ranks, and restore the heavens’ positions, reaffirming merit and virtue. The memorial rests upon your servant’s jade table. We request that the text be reviewed.

Next, the memorial is taken and fumigated over the incense. The Dharma ranks are invoked, and after two bows, the assembly rises to a long kneel. In harmonious voices and upright qi, as the disciple’s name is read, all perform two bows. From the phrase “your servants, trembling with awe,” all perform two more bows. Upon reaching the date and location, “[Location], reverently presented on [Date],” two more bows are performed.

The memorial is unfolded upon the jade table. A ritual knife is placed to the left of the sacred title, and a vermilion brush to the right. The High Master takes three pinches of incense, strikes the teeth three times, and in a long kneel, dispatches the memorial, declaring:

**Dispatch:**
We reverently dispatch the true officials within your servants’ five bodies, one minor scribe, twelve writing assistants, and the repeatedly commanded Merit-Officials and Couriers, Flying Dragon Riders. Adorned in solemn attire, crowned and sashed, they grind ink, prepare brushes, gird swords, and arrange the registers. They shall promptly carry this yellow silk memorial with vermilion text to the Three Heavenly Courts for timely presentation. Should there be errors, omissions, transposed words, or disordered passages, the transmitting scribes, minor officials, and couriers shall wield dragon-headed ritual knives and sharp brushes to correct and amend them.

Let no supervising officials obstruct or reject this dispatch. Seal the mouth, let the qi ascend directly to the Three Heavens’ Infinite Great Dao, before the Most High’s presence—let there be no delay. The Left Lord shall pass through the barriers, the Right Scribe shall present in order, and all officials shall proceed rank by rank in due sequence.

May what is petitioned descend, what is summoned arrive, what is saved be delivered, what is proclaimed be communicated, what is promoted be advanced, what is wished be fulfilled, and what is sought be obtained. Should any subordinate officials, through obstructive qi, intercept or block this memorial from reaching its destination, seize them and consign them to the nearest prison, to be punished according to the law and the celestial statutes.

The officiant retires and prostrates before the altar, awaiting a response. Next, the memorial is placed into its case, and the ritual master leads the procession to escort the memorial down from the altar. The Dharma Master then faces the Heavenly Gate, prostrates upon the ground, and in meditation presents the memorial with due ceremony. The memorial is burned at the Heavenly Gate, and the Dharma Master rises to recite the incantation of burning.

The cantor intones, and the inner officials kneel in accordance with the ritual. The Dharma Master offers incense three times, strikes the teeth twelve times, and restores the officials to their posts.

The memorial having been presented, at the commencement of the fast, the Merit-Officials and Couriers, all Perfected Officials, Immortal Lords, and divine soldiers dispatched from the officiant’s body shall return to their places within. Entering through the Gate of Myriad Mysteries, those on the left return to the left, those on the right to the right. The Directing Merit-Official shall take charge of inspection and sealing, returning each to their original position without error or confusion. When summoned again, they shall arrive as before.

The officiant strikes the teeth three times, swallows saliva three times, and visualizes the officials of the Three and Five Chapters returning to their places within. All bow twice. The cantor intones, and the assembly kneels to return the precepts in accordance with the ritual. The Dharma Master faces west, the officials face east.

We, your servants, have not yet mastered the Dharma in full. In our reverence and movement, in our advance and retreat, we may have transgressed the regulations and violated the ritual forms. We fear being impeached by the Four Administrations or seized by the Five Emperors. For our thousand faults and ten thousand errors, we beg forgiveness and mercy. Though our origins are humble and our understanding dim, we pray not to be visited with punishment or retribution.

At the commencement of this fast, we reverently invited the Ten Precepts of the Upper Grade of Wisdom. Now that the Dharma rites are concluded, we respectfully return them to their heavenly palace. We humbly submit this report, praying for your luminous pardon.

We, your servants, with utmost reverence and awe, prostrate ourselves and bow twice.

Next, the precepts are returned with the recitation of the Three Obeisances, as recorded in the *San Dong Ke Yi*:
*"The Heavenly Worthy, in great compassion,*
*Preaches the precepts to deliver sentient beings.*
*Virtue and power pervade the hidden and manifest;*
*Karmic retribution moves the divine spirits.*
*The devas come to bow their heads;*
*The demon kings submit in form.*
*Those of the past transcend the eight difficulties;*
*Those of the present preserve a thousand years.*
*As the fast’s blessings draw to a close,*
*Together we send forth our devotion.*
*Flowing Sanskrit, ethereal clouds chant;*
*Flying incense mingles with fragrant smoke.*
*Jade phoenixes ride the cinnabar carriage;*
*Golden dragons draw the green canopy.*
*In life and death, all find joy;*
*Families and nations all know peace."*

Next, the Mountain Simpl is proclaimed, striking the teeth nine times. The assembly kneels in harmony and reads the text aloud. When the proclamation of the Mountain Simpl is complete, the officials bow twice. The disciples are instructed to hold the tablets and carry the incense smoke forward.

The High Master faces east, strikes the teeth nine times, and recites the incantation. The assembly joins in unison:
*"Mysterious and supreme, radiant and clear,*
*The Primordial Beginning oversees the Perfected.*
*The Five Elders of the Emperor,*
*Red Script of the Cinnabar Text.*
*Origin of Heaven and Earth,*
*Governors of the Three Primes.*
*Gathering qi, summoning the assembly,*
*Urging the ascent of immortals.*
*Exalted talismanic commands,*
*Universally proclaimed to the Ten Heavens.*
*Sun, moon, and stellar lodges,*
*Spirits of the Five Peaks.*
*Above in Heaven, below on Earth,*
*Great deities of the vast and dark.*
*Overseers of life and recorders of deeds,*
*Southern Gate of the Three Portals.*
*Guarding the jade tablets,*
*Inscribing names in the cinnabar register.*
*Erasing the records of transgressions,*
*Promoting to the ranks of imperial ministers.*
*So-and-so relies upon the Perfect Dao,*
*Establishing merit through the fast.*
*Redeeming the nine generations of ancestors,*
*All suffering souls.*
*The Dao rites concluded,*
*We respectfully follow the sacred mountain.*
*We present the jade tablet,*
*Begging to erase our transgressions.*
*May all attain liberation,*
*Without enmity or kinship.*
*Departing the Three Evils,*
*Ascending to the Nine Heavens.*
*Deliverance in life and death,*
*Eternal through ten thousand kalpas.*
*Today we make this report,*
*Heard by all the myriad spirits.*
*We request the Dragon Tablet,*
*To ally with the Perfected Officials.*
*Grant our plea as stated,*
*Transmitted by the Golden Dragon Couriers."*

Next, the Water Simpl is proclaimed in the same manner as the Mountain Simpl. When the proclamation is complete, the High Master faces east and recites the incantation:
*"Primordial Beginning and Five Elders,*
*Exalted Lords of the Emperor.*
*Perfected Ones of the Ten Directions,*
*Spirits of Mount Taihua.*
*Red Script proclaims the command,*
*Nothing hidden remains unheard.*
*Ascending to the Nine Heavens,*
*We request the descent of the jade text.*
*Sun, moon, and five stars,*
*Northern Dipper’s seven origins.*
*We report to the Five Peaks,*
*Spiritual mountains of the four directions.*
*Below, we report to rivers and seas,*
*Twelve springs and sources.*
*Water Emperors of the Nine Treasuries,*
*Great deities of the vast and dark.*
*Today we make this report,*
*Opening the ten thousand vows.*
*Performing the fast and practicing the Dao,*
*Universally for the living and the dead.*
*We beg to redeem the seven generations of ancestors,*

*Heard by all the myriad spirits.*
*We request the Dragon Tablet,*
*To ally with the Water Emperors.*
*Grant our plea as stated,*
*Transmitted by the Golden Dragon Couriers."*

Next, the Earth Simpl is proclaimed in the same manner as the Mountain Simpl. When the proclamation is complete, the High Master faces east and recites the incantation:
*"Heaven and Earth unfold,*
*Nine qi divide the numinous.*
*Three Primes share the talisman,*
*Ten directions shine in clarity.*
*The Five Elder Emperors,*
*Open the Perfected and govern life.*
*Cinnabar Script and Red Text,*

*We request the Golden Button,*
*To manifest our utmost sincerity.*
*Grant our plea as stated,*
*Presented by the Golden Dragon Couriers."*

The incantations for the three tablets are from the *Lingbao Chishu Yujue*.

Next, the hymn for presenting the Dragon Tablets is chanted. The cantor intones, and the officials return to their duties. Before the Three Treasures, all bow three times, kneel, and present the tablets. The High Master bows three more times and retires.

Next, the incense brazier is rekindled. The Incense Officials and Envoys, the Lords of the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger, and all attending spirit-officials of the incense are invoked to dissolve the precincts of the Yellow Register Retreat. Here, golden liquid elixirs and cinnabar mushrooms naturally arise. The hundred numinous perfected beings gather in this place before the incense brazier. May the living and deceased disciples receive blessings, may households and the state be graced with favor. The jade lads and maidens of the ten directions attend the fragrant smoke, conveying the petitions just presented directly to the Most High, the Boundless Dao, the Perfectly True Jade Emperor before the Celestial Throne. All bow three times.

Next, the Dharma Master offers incense, stands facing east, and takes leave of the Three Treasures:

*"The time allotted for this retreat has passed, the sun’s shadow wanes.
The fragrance pervades the void, the great bell’s resonance ceases.
The Dao returns to the Golden Palace, the scriptures are sealed in jade caskets.
We bow our heads in reverence and take refuge."*

**Response:** *"In the Most High Dao-Treasure."* **One bow.**

*"Incense disperses with the wind, its sound enters the Great Clarity.
Names are inscribed on golden tablets, petitions written on jade slips.
The immortal lads record them, the jade maidens present the documents.
We bow our heads in reverence and take refuge."*

**Response:** *"In the Most High Scripture-Treasure."* **One bow.**

*"The Dao-chamber is complete, the Dharma-seat fully arrayed.
May all beings ascend to the shore of non-action.
We bow our heads in reverence and take refuge."*

**Response:** *"In the Most High Master-Treasure."* **One bow.**

*"May all beings refrain from all evil and practice all good,
ever reborn in the Central Land, never cast to the frontier realms.
May the six paths receive grace, may the Fengdu courts dismiss their suits.
We bow in homage to the ten directions."*

**Response:** *"To the perfected immortals and all the holy hosts who have attained the Dao."* **One bow.**

Next, the assembly circumambulates while chanting the *"Hymn of the Three Paths and Five Sufferings,"* then posts the proclamation from the *Sutra of the Vows of Fundamental Wisdom for Dispelling Demons, Pacifying the Will, and Stabilizing Aspiration.*

Next, the *"Hymn for Dissolving the Altar"* is chanted.
Next, the *"Hymn for Cultivating Immortality"* is chanted while circumambulating out of the altar, from the *Scripture on the Ritual Dignity of the Taiyi Spread-Fast.*
Next, the *"Door-Closing Incantation"* is recited.

Next, the assembly proceeds to the tents of the Five Emperors, the Three Masters, the Fast-Overseer, the Three Officials, the Celestial Master, and the Mysterious Master to offer thanks and take leave.

Next, the *"Hua-Xia Prelude"* is played, and the High Master retires to his chamber.

Next, all officials bow to the Dharma Master three times, kneel, and offer thanks:
*"We, unworthy as we are, have been permitted to witness these rites from afar.
Though we have followed the precepts, we have often transgressed. We pray for your forbearance."*
**Three bows.**

The disciples, leading all men and women, young and old, approach the Master. They perform nine bows and three prostrations, offering thanks:
*"We, fortunate to have met you in a thousand lifetimes, have received your guidance.
The merit of this retreat is complete; we owe our lives and deaths to your grace.
Unworthy and remiss from beginning to end, we have fallen short in every way.
We pray for your forgiveness."*
**Three more bows, then receive blessings.**

Here concludes *Scroll Eighteen of the Established Rites for the Most High Yellow Register Grand Retreat.*

*Scroll Nineteen of the Established Rites for the Most High Yellow Register Grand Retreat*

**Ritual Gate: Altar-Prohibiting Rite**

After inviting the Master to descend, the *Huaxia* hymn is chanted once around the altar, proceeding to the Earth Gate. The Dharma Master assumes the principal role, visualizing as prescribed in the original rite. Alternatively, a Zhengyi Dharma Master may be selected—donning a dark cap and crimson robe—to perform the altar-prohibiting ritual. If the High Priest conducts the rite personally, this is also permissible.

The Tai Xuan Du Zhengyi Pacifying Qi Lineage Celestial Master of [Name] Parish, the Red Heaven Three-Five Step Pace Yuanming True Person, your subject [Name], respectfully declares:

I have heard that none govern yin and yang more profoundly than the Hundred Spirits, nor can any surpass the Great Dao in delivering the living and the dead, the household and the state. Thus, the Azure Heavens bear omens of fortune and calamity, which mortals strive to discern; the Yellow Register holds the rites of salvation, which mortals endeavor to cultivate. Though I am utterly foolish, I ardently revere the mysterious transformation. Unworthily, I bear the great Dharma and presumptuously hold the office of Parish Master. In every altar I have served, how dare I forget my duty to repay this grace?

On this day, the [Year] of the Great Year [Celestial Stem-Branch], the [Month] [Day], I humbly act on behalf of [Official Title] at [Place] Abbey, conducting the Most High Yellow Register Grand Retreat for [Purpose], spanning [Number] days and nights. We perform the Daoist rites, recite the scriptures, and submit petitions in accordance with the established procedures.

We purify our forms and refine our qi, still our hearts and calm our spirits. Having set this appointed time, how dare we fail to make our supplication above?

We reverently recall that the Most High has issued decrees of renewal and opened the grace of nurturing and sheltering. Commands have been dispatched to the True Officials, who descend to oversee and inspect. May the mists and clouds momentarily cease across the Three Realms; may wind and rain not afflict the Four Seas. Our repentance and gratitude shall surely be heard; our prayers shall be transmitted without delay.

Overwhelmed by awe and longing, I concentrate my thoughts and invoke the True Ones, awaiting their response.

Concluding, I close my eyes and visualize the Azure Dragon, Vermilion Bird, White Tiger, and Dark Warrior. Then, donning the Dipper upon my head and the Five Stars, Sun, and Moon, I see them radiant in the four directions. With hands lowered and fists clenched, I recite the incantation:

**Azure Dragon of the East**, essence of Horn and Neck,
You exhale the numinous, dense qi, roar with thunderous voice.
Soaring across the Eight Extremities, roaming the Four Seas,
Come and attend at my left.

**White Tiger of the West**, corresponding to Beak and Tri-Star,
Your form is resplendent and pure, your voice solemn and clear.
You awe and subdue all beasts, your howls shake the mountains and forests.
Come and stand at my right.

**Vermilion Bird of the South**, chief of all fowl,
Born from the Cinnabar Cavern, your cries echo through the azure vault.
Your wondrous hues span five colors, your divine countenance bears six images.
Come and guide before me.

**Dark Warrior of the North**, transformed from the Supreme Yin,
Your form is marked by Void and Danger, serpent and tortoise conjoined.
You coil through the Nine Lands, command and gather the myriad spirits.
Come and follow behind me.

I summon the Four Numinous Beasts; now that they have assembled,
They shall encircle me as a sash, the Sun and Moon shall accompany my circuit.
The Nine Provinces and Sixteen Divine Generals shall serve as my messengers;
The Heavenly, Earthly, and Water Officials shall share in this blessing.

Next, I perform the Ding Pace, taking three steps. Advancing, I take the sword in my right hand and recite the incantation:

The Five Phases move—Fire, Wood, Water, Earth, Metal.
I wield this unyielding sword to command and restrain gods and spirits.
The Twenty-Eight Constellations follow my direction;
The Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper escort the numinous and true.
Roaming the ten thousand directions, may a hundred blessings converge.

Then, taking the water bowl in my left hand, I recite:

The waters of the Jiang, He, Huai, and Sea are no ordinary waters;
The Five Dragons exhale them to purify heaven and earth.
The Great Emperor drank them for thirty thousand years;
Today, I shall use them to cleanse malevolent qi.

Next, I face the sword toward the water and recite:

**Azure Dragon of the East**, bearing the talisman, descend with true qi into my water.
**Crimson Dragon of the South**, bearing the talisman, descend with true qi into my water.
**White Dragon of the West**, bearing the talisman, descend with true qi into my water.
**Black Dragon of the North**, bearing the talisman, descend with true qi into my water.
**Yellow Dragon of the Center**, bearing the talisman, descend with true qi into my water.

My water is no ordinary water—it is the water of the Five Dragons and Five Stars’ true qi.
My sword is no ordinary sword—tempered nine times, unyielding and firm, the Seven Stars flank it.
I tread upon the Northern Dipper, straddle the Demon-Quelling Star.
The Great One generates water, which flows through the ten thousand directions.
Nothing is purer than water; nothing is filthier than defilement.
With purity, I wash away impurity; with water, I govern defilement.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the statutes and ordinances!

I further command:
The Nine Wood Officials of the Azure Emperor of the East, Purifiers of Defilement;
The Three Fire Officials of the Crimson Emperor of the South, Purifiers of Defilement;
The Seven Metal Officials of the White Emperor of the West, Purifiers of Defilement;
The Five Water Officials of the Black Emperor of the North, Purifiers of Defilement;
The Twelve Earth Officials of the Yellow Emperor of the Center, Purifiers of Defilement.

I invoke:
The Heavenly Purifying Officials above,
The Earthly Purifying Officials below,
The Purifying Officials of the Current Year’s Directing Talisman,
The Purifying Officials of the Current Month’s Directing Talisman,
The Purifying Officials of the Current Day’s Directing Talisman,
The Purifying Officials of the Current Hour’s Directing Talisman,
The Purifying Generals, soldiers, True Persons, and Divine Lads—
All true officials, descend together!

Arriving at this retreat altar,
dissolve the defilements of heaven, earth, humanity, ghosts, cattle, horses, the six livestock, birds, and insects.
The Phoenix of Defilement-Breaking shall proceed from front to back, from east to west, purifying in order, restoring immaculate purity.

Let the heavenly defilements return to heaven,
the earthly defilements return to earth,
the human defilements return to humans,
the ghostly defilements return to ghosts.
May all evil defilements swiftly depart ten thousand leagues, never to linger.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the statutes and ordinances!

Next, I proceed westward to the Qian position and recite the incantation—this is the Yu Step incantation:

Qian, exalted and radiant; Kun, compliant and inwardly flourishing.
The Two Modes harmonize; the Six Directions align in uprightness.
Heaven and Earth unite in offering; eternal peace and solemn purity reign.
Responding to the mysterious and the yellow, above is the robe, below the skirt.
Zhen, Li, Kan, Dui assist and support; Qian, Kun, Gen, Xun—tiger strides, dragon soars.
The Gate of Heaven, the Door of Earth, the pivot of humans and ghosts.
Who guards me? The luminous heavens, the azure vault.
Today, my Yu Step corresponds to the Celestial Stem.
Ghosts and spirits submit; misfortune is averted below.
What I invoke and declare shall be answered with timely numinous radiance.

Then, performing the Yu Step—three steps, nine traces—from the northwest to the northeast, I face south and recite the incantation.

I invoke the Azure Emperor of the East, the Azure Youth Lord, and their retinue of ninety million officers and soldiers. Riding the true qi of Jupiter, they descend through the floating void to alight upon this altar ground. From the northeast corner, I seal the boundary to the southeast corner. The marching deities deploy their qi, scouring for evil spirits. Banish and expel demonic thieves—those guilty shall know no pardon.

Then, performing the Yu Step—three steps, nine traces—from the northeast to the southeast, I face west and recite the incantation:

I invoke the Vermilion Emperor of the South, the Vermilion Youth Lord, and their retinue of thirty million officers and soldiers. Riding the true qi of Mars, they descend through the floating void to alight upon this altar ground. From the southeast corner, I seal the boundary to the southwest corner. The marching deities deploy their qi, scouring for evil spirits. Burn and consume demonic thieves—those guilty shall know no pardon.

Then, performing the Yu Step—three steps, nine traces—from the southeast to the southwest, I face north and recite the incantation:

I invoke the White Emperor of the West, the White Youth Lord, and their retinue of seventy million officers and soldiers. Riding the true qi of Venus, they descend through the floating void to alight upon this altar ground. From the southwest corner, I seal the boundary to the northwest corner. The marching deities deploy their qi, scouring for evil spirits. Execute and behead demonic thieves—those guilty shall know no pardon.

Then, performing the Yu Step—three steps, nine traces—from the southwest to the northwest, I face east and recite the incantation:

I invoke the Black Emperor of the North, the Black Youth Lord, and their retinue of fifty million officers and soldiers. Riding the true qi of Mercury, they descend through the floating void to alight upon this altar ground. From the northwest corner, I seal the boundary to the center. The marching deities deploy their qi, scouring for evil spirits. Drown and sweep away demonic thieves—those guilty shall know no pardon.

Then, performing the Yu Step—three steps, nine traces—from the southeast, I face the altar’s heart and recite the incantation:

I invoke the Yellow Emperor of the Center, the Yellow Youth Lord, and their twelve myriad yellow-robed soldiers. Riding the true qi of Saturn, they descend through the floating void to alight upon this altar ground. From above, I seal the boundary to the altar’s center. The marching deities deploy their qi, scouring for evil spirits. Bury and conceal demonic thieves—those guilty shall know no pardon.

Then, proceeding in order to the northeast, I face north and recite the incantation:

Today, I act on behalf of so-and-so official, so-and-so person, to perform the Great Yellow Register Fast, conducting the Dao in accordance with the ritual statutes.

I invoke the celestial immortals’ legions—nine hundred million cavalry; the terrestrial immortals’ legions—nine hundred million cavalry; the flying immortals’ legions—nine hundred million cavalry; the perfected beings’ legions—nine hundred million cavalry; the divine beings’ legions—nine hundred million cavalry; the legions of the sun, moon, and stellar lodgings—each nine hundred million cavalry; the legions of the Nine Palaces and Five Emperors—each nine hundred million cavalry; the legions of the Three Rivers and Four Seas—each nine hundred million cavalry; the legions of the Five Peaks and Four Waterways—each nine hundred million cavalry. All array themselves in strict formation, advancing in unbroken ranks, their advance shaking the wind and raising thunder, their banners boiling the rain and surging the clouds. As one, they descend to alight upon the altar ground. Circling the altar thrice, they cover it threefold. Above, they spread the celestial net; below, they lay the earthly snare. The Nine Lands unite in effort as the legions and cavalry array themselves within and without the altar precincts, on all four sides and eight directions. All earthly and wooden spirits, lingering corpses and stale qi—every inauspicious impurity that defies the Dao—shall be seized and consigned beneath the Demon-Quelling Star. Plunged ten thousand fathoms into the earth, they shall stir no more, act no more. Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes of the Most High Lord Lao!

Upon the Earth Gate, I inscribe the character for "ghost," plant the sword into the ghost’s heart, sprinkle water, lower my hands, clench my fists, and facing the Ghost Gate, recite the incantation:

The Nine Heavens issue their decree, proclaiming it to the myriad spirits. Hasten to summon the celestial perfected, all to assemble in the imperial court. The Great Unity descends, the Twin Stars escort their essence. They oversee and suppress evil, govern qi and sustain life. Should any inauspicious force test the divine, by the Dao of the Emperor’s command, I marshal the divine soldiers. Seven spirits wield their axes, the Celestial Blade advances to the right. Brandishing the sword, they lead the charge, hurling fire bells. I dispatch the edict to the armored couriers, the tiger soldiers and celestial warriors. Wind and fire join in battle, vanquishing the cunning spirits of evil. Above, they overawe the Six Heavens; below, they subdue demonic spirits. Once awed, once subdued, the myriad evils are annihilated. The divine halberd sweeps like lightning, leaving no trace of wickedness or demonic beings. The Immortal Sovereign raises his standard—those who dare delay the command shall be executed. Defy the standard, violate the command, and your form shall be destroyed. Be vigilant, be cautious, to preserve this Yellow Tranquility. The Nine Heavens proclaim their decree—let all spirits heed with reverence!

Next, the *Huaxia Hymn of Praise* is sung, guiding the Dharma Master to circumambulate from the Earth Gate and ascend the altar. The *Ritual of Lamp Veneration* begins with the *Hymn to the Study of Immortality*, leading the Dharma Master out of the hall. Then, the *Hymn to the Bright Lamp* is chanted, guiding the Dharma Master to circumambulate the bright lamp, stand upon the Earth Gate, form ranks, and bow in prayer.

The Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate and Great Void declares: Yin and yang establish their symbols; heaven and earth divide their forms. Day and night differ, darkness and light diverge. Thus, the pure and ethereal manifest their essence, and the myriad heavens become the abodes of the sagely and divine; the turbid and dense flow into form, and the myriad earths become the domains of ghosts and spirits. Above the Nine Heavens, yin qi is wholly dispelled; below the Nine Earths, the light of yang is forever cut off. This is the boundary of the netherworld, where no light remains. At the time of painted scenes, it is like a dense fog; after dusk, the gloom deepens. The sinful souls of the long night have no means to find brightness. Some beings, devoid of good karma and burdened with past sins, have since their death sunk into hell, enduring myriad torments and confined in Fengdu. Deprived of the Three Lights, they suffer for countless kalpas. Our Heavenly Worthy, in great compassion, opens many gates of salvation. He bestows the scripture of the kindled lamp to continue the light and illuminate the night. Where the numinous radiance reaches, sins and afflictions are all dispelled. Through the opportunity of repentance and deliverance, the wish for rebirth is fulfilled.

If there are good men and good women who awaken the supreme Dao-mind, follow the ritual codes, and come to the fast, bringing fragrant oil to kindle lamps for the emperor, his ministers, parents, and children—through the Three Paths and Nine Nights, whether in darkness or light—then, in accordance with the Dharma, they shall light lamps to illuminate within and without. Above, these lamps shall shine upon the heavens and the halls of fortune; below, they shall illuminate the Nine Earths and the depths of hell. Thus, suffering souls shall be delivered, the benighted shall see the light, the nine generations of ancestors shall ascend to heaven, and the Three Paths shall be freed from darkness. Blessings shall extend to all, and merit shall be boundless. Know that those who perform such deeds accumulate good karma over kalpas and shall surely attain the Dao.

Now, so-and-so conducts the Great Yellow Register Fast, following the scriptural texts to kindle lamps in offering. May the emperor enjoy blessings, the Two Luminaries shine brightly. May the seven generations of ancestors ascend to heaven, and the Three Paths be serene. In this life, may the divine and sagely protect and uphold them, their fortune towering high, and may they forever ascend to the immortal realms.

The disciple bows twice.

The *Perfected Immortals of the Upper Prime Golden Register Scriptural Texts* state: For the *Ritual of Lamp Kindling*, upon the Dao Gate, kindle two lamps to illuminate the dwelling of the fast’s sponsor, to dispel calamities and deliver from misfortune, and to pacify and secure the household deities. Beneath the lamps, the disciple bows three times and recites the incantation to the Dharma Master:

The true light of the Orthodox Unity blazes upward in vermilion smoke. Twelve Light-Opening Lads thoroughly illuminate this dwelling and my own body. A hundred evils are shattered, ten thousand ghosts repelled. The radiance is bright and clear, connecting with the divine and reaching the numinous. Ascending into the formless, it unites with the Dao’s spontaneity.

The *Perfected Immortals of the Upper Prime Golden Register Scriptural Texts* state: For the *Ritual of Lamp Kindling*, upon the sponsor’s life destiny, kindle three lamps to illuminate the three souls, to restrain evil and deliver from misfortune, and to bind and guard the three souls. Beneath the lamps, the disciple bows three times and recites the incantation:

The yang light thoroughly illuminates, and the three souls naturally arise. They gather the myriad spirits, forever attaching to my form. Like the sun and moon sharing their radiance, may I forever preserve this without decline.

The *Perfected Immortals of the Upper Prime Golden Register Scriptural Texts* state: For the *Ritual of Lamp Kindling*, upon the sponsor’s current year, kindle seven lamps to illuminate the seven po, to pacify the spirit and avert calamity, and to restrain the po and expel evil. Beneath the lamps, the disciple bows three times and recites the incantation:

The bright lamp gathers its light, and the wandering spirits do not flee. The seven po are secure, and the myriad spirits all return. Like the sun at its zenith, may I forever dwell in radiance.

The *Perfected Immortals of the Upper Prime Golden Register Scriptural Texts* state: For the *Ritual of Lamp Kindling*, upon the Year Star, kindle one lamp to illuminate the spirit of the Year Star, to dispel the sponsor’s yearly calamities and usher in blessings and fortune.

The disciple bows three times beneath the lamps and recites the incantation:

The radiance of the Great Sun flows forth, its flames illuminating the four directions. It penetrates my body, traversing the seven wefts and nine depths. Within it shines brightly, without it glows clearly, piercing through the vastness of the Great Void.

The *Perfected Immortals of the Upper Prime Golden Register Scriptural Texts* state: For the *Ritual of Lamp Kindling*, upon the great ancestral tomb, kindle three lamps to illuminate the sponsor’s ancestral burial mounds across generations, to deliver and ascend the departed souls of former lives, to sever karmic entanglements in litigation, and to dissolve the calamities of retributive cycles. The disciple bows three times beneath the lamps toward the great tomb.

The incantation of *Gong, Yu, Chen, Shang, Chou, Jue, Wei, Zhi, Xu* is recited:
The Great Sun is shrouded in darkness, boundless kalpas without end. The radiance of yang light shines brilliantly, descending to illuminate the decayed remains. The soul receives the light, and its spirit is reborn. Attaining birth in the royal gate, joy and bliss abound.

The *Perfected Immortals of the Upper Prime Golden Register Scriptural Texts* state: For the *Ritual of Lamp Kindling*, upon the lesser tomb, kindle five lamps to illuminate the sponsor’s recent ancestral burial mounds, to deliver and ascend the divine souls, that they may be born in the heavenly realms, to benefit and protect the living, and to prosper blessings and fortune. The disciple bows three times beneath the lamps toward the tomb.

The incantation of *Gong, Yu, Xu, Shang, Wei, Jue, Chou, Zhi, Chen* is recited:
In the long night of the netherworld, boundless kalpas remain unopened. The light lies hidden in the Great Yin, and the seven *po* drift astray. The Vermilion Spirit Youths and the radiance of the Great Sun shine brilliantly. Illuminating the gate of the *po*, the divine souls are reunited.

The *Perfected Immortals of the Upper Prime Golden Register Scriptural Texts* state: For the *Ritual of Lamp Kindling*, in the central courtyard, kindle seven lamps to illuminate the seven generations of ancestors—father and mother—so that the suffering souls in darkness may be born in the heavenly realms. The disciple bows three times beneath the lamps toward the earthly gate and recites the incantation:

Heaven and earth revolve, succeeding one another in turn. The Nine Netherworlds lack light, and the seven generations remain unopened. The Great Sun bestows deliverance, and the dead souls respond in return. The bright lamps continue through the night, and the decayed remains shine with radiance.

The *Perfected Immortals of the Upper Prime Golden Register Scriptural Texts* state: For the *Ritual of Lamp Kindling*, in the central courtyard, kindle the lamps of the Nine Netherworlds to illuminate the long-night abode of the Nine Netherworlds, to deliver the disciple’s departed souls from within, that they may behold the light. The disciple bows three times beneath the lamps toward the *Xu-Si* southwest direction and recites the incantation:

The Nine Netherworlds are shrouded in darkness, boundless kalpas without light. The long night imprisons the souls, and the Primordial Beginning remains unopened. The resplendent lamps continue the light, descending to illuminate the Earthly Sovereign. Delivering the Seven Mysteries, they ascend to the Southern Palace. Illuminating the entire household, may generations become immortal kings.

The *Perfected Immortals of the Upper Prime Golden Register Scriptural Texts* state: For the *Ritual of Lamp Kindling*, at the side gates, kindle two lamps to illuminate the official residence, to expel evil and capture malevolence for the disciple, and to protect the entire household. The disciple bows three times beneath the lamps toward the south and recites the incantation:

The radiance of yang light unfolds, vermilion mist blazing brilliantly. The Great Flame Youths guard the mysterious gates. Illuminating the palace and residence, the four windows and eight doors open wide. Driving away ghosts and capturing evil, the myriad spirits are vanquished. The Three Realms reverently protect, enduring through generations without decline. The assembly of Perfected Ones gathers, and sun and moon shine together.

The *Perfected Immortals of the Upper Prime Golden Register Scriptural Texts* state: For the *Ritual of Lamp Kindling*, upon the earthly gate, kindle twenty-four lamps to illuminate the twenty-four vital breaths of life, to extend the disciple’s lifespan and augment their *qi*, to increase blessings and pacify the spirit, to inscribe their name in the register of the living, and to erase it from the ledger of the dead. The disciple bows three times beneath the lamps toward the earthly gate and recites the incantation:

The Three Divisions and Eight Effulgences unite to form my body. The twenty-four *qi* constitute my spirit. The bright lamps are first kindled, opening the Supreme Mystery above. My body transcends water and fire, harmonizing with *qi* naturally. The Eight Effulgences shine together—may I attain immortality.

The *Perfected Immortals of the Upper Prime Golden Register Scriptural Texts* state: For the *Ritual of Lamp Kindling*, in the eight directions, kindle eight lamps to illuminate the Eight Trigrams, to illuminate the eight reaches for the disciple, to open the nine palaces of perception, to secretly guard the eight spirits, and to unblock the eight directions. The disciple bows three times beneath the lamps toward the *Wang* direction and recites the incantation:

The Three Effulgences shine brilliantly, and the Eight Trigrams open their windows. The heavenly *qi* is serene and sealed, the Great Yin conceals its light. The resplendent lamps illuminate the darkness, and the ten thousand wishes are unblocked. My body enters the radiant splendor, forever enjoying boundless abundance.

The *Perfected Immortals of the Upper Prime Golden Register Scriptural Texts* state: For the *Ritual of Lamp Kindling*, in the four directions and the center, kindle nine lamps to illuminate the Nine Palaces, to deliver the disciple from the calamities of the Nine Palaces and inscribe their name among the immortals of the Nine Palaces. The disciple bows three times beneath the lamps toward the center and recites the incantation:

The positions of the Nine-Five unfold, and heaven and earth open wide. The mysterious light lies hidden, the Great Yin and Great Yang. Illuminating with my resplendent lamps, they ascend to shine upon the Nine Palaces. The mysterious night unfolds brightly—may my wishes be auspicious.

The *Perfected Immortals of the Upper Prime Golden Register Scriptural Texts* state: For the *Ritual of Lamp Kindling*, in the ten directions, kindle ten lamps to illuminate the ten directions, to illuminate the ten extremities for the disciple, to summon the Perfected and descend the spirits, to resolve calamities, and to inscribe their name in the Ten Heavens. The disciple bows three times beneath the lamps toward the Heavenly Gate and recites the incantation:

Heaven opens and earth closes, the mysterious yin remains unilluminated. The vermilion mist blazes upward, opening the netherworld for me. The honored spirits of the ten directions mystically observe my form. Soul and *po* shine together, naturally radiant in essence.

The *Perfected Immortals of the Upper Prime Golden Register Scriptural Texts* state: For the *Ritual of Lamp Kindling*, in the four directions, kindle twenty-eight lamps to illuminate the Twenty-Eight Constellations, to erase the disciple’s name from the ledger of the dead, to augment their name in the register of the living, to fall death under the Northern Dipper, and to extend life under the Southern Dipper. The disciple bows three times beneath the lamps toward the southeast and recites the incantation:

The bright stars blaze brilliantly, their light flowing through the ten gates. The mysterious essence descends, and the Nine Netherworlds remain unopened. I kindle the resplendent lamps, riding the light upward to be heard. May I attain the pure canopy to illuminate my form and soul.

The *Perfected Immortals of the Upper Prime Golden Register Scriptural Texts* state: For the *Ritual of Lamp Kindling*, upon the Heavenly Gate, kindle thirty-six lamps to illuminate the Thirty-Six Heavens, to deliver and ascend the disciple’s ancestral fathers and mothers into the heavenly realms.

Beneath the lamps, the disciple faces the Heavenly Gate, bows three times, and recites the incantation:

The Dragon Han flows boundlessly, the Three Qi ride the mysterious.
The Brahmanic practice stretches afar, encompassing the vast trichiliocosm.
The long soul, eternal and vast, gazes upward in endless reverence.
Today, with these bright lamps, I vow to attain immortality.
May my seven ancestors ascend with me to the celestial realms.

The *Perfected Immortals of the Upper Prime Golden Register Scriptural Texts* state: For the *Ritual of Lamp Kindling*, in the five directions, kindle five lamps to illuminate the Five Quarters, to inscribe the disciple’s name in the immortal register and safeguard their form.

Beneath the lamps, the disciple faces the five directions, bows three times, and recites the incantation:

The sacred mountains of the Five Peaks stand firm, anchoring the Five Quarters.
The Five August Thearchs, revered deities, are the wellspring of immortals.
Today, with these kindled lamps, their light ascends to illuminate the Heavenly Kings.
May my name be recorded in the celestial registers, and may I be delivered into the immortal ranks.
May my seven ancestors be liberated, ascending together into the Great Void.

The *Perfected Immortals of the Upper Prime Golden Register Scriptural Texts* state: The *Ritual of Lamp Kindling* carries the utmost merit. Its light illumines the heavens above and brightens the earth below. For eight directions and nine nights, all behold its radiance. Those who witness these lamps shall have their sins extinguished and blessings arise. The host of this lamp-kindling accrues profound fortune. Their nine generations of ancestors shall ascend to the celestial halls, forever departing sorrow and suffering, eternally freed from the Nine Netherworlds, and roam joyfully within the Upper Prime Immortal Palaces. The living shall dwell in peace, descendants flourish, households remain pure and serene, and myriad calamities be averted. The departed shall be delivered, the living and dead alike bear gratitude. Its merit is boundless, and all aspirations shall be fulfilled. For families and nations, all shall attain prosperity and harmony. For nine nights and the Three Wretched Realms, all shall ascend to the true Dao.

The method of lamp-kindling incantations is recorded in the *Upper Prime Golden Register Scriptural Texts*. When Du Guangcheng’s rites conclude, and the *Falling Twilight Dao Procession* is complete, the master leads the assembled officials and disciples in circumambulating beneath the lamps, reciting the incantations according to their positions. After each recitation, the officials and disciples bow in reverence. The *Retaining Tranquility* and *Lamp Invocation* should precede the *Stellar Petition*, though it is also fitting to perform them afterward. It is best to offer prayers each night. If the master’s strength is insufficient, the attendant scripture-keepers or lamp-tenders may perform the rites on their behalf. Disciples shall remain outside the main gate for their prostrations. Next, recite the *Eulogy of Goodness*, followed by the *Hymn of Immortal Study*, leading the assembly back before the Original Master to disperse according to the usual rites.

The *Upper Prime Golden Register’s* "Perfected Immortals" section states: In the *Lamp-Lighting Rites of Dignity*, the officials attending the lamps must apply themselves with diligence. They shall ensure the lamp’s light remains bright and unbroken, never extinguished midway. If the light dims unevenly, it severs one from the world of the living—this must always be guarded against.

The *Upper Prime Golden Register’s* "Perfected Immortals" section further states: In the *Lamp-Lighting Rites of Dignity*, the lamps are extinguished at dawn. The master recites the incantation:
*"Mysterious Yin unfolds its radiance,
The eternal lamp renews its light.
The Great Yang now shines resplendent,
The Eight Dark Realms open in clarity.
The lamp returns to Great Yin,
Its light merging with the luminous essence.
The Two Perfected of Sun and Moon
Unite with me in oneness."*
Upon completion of the incantation, the lamps are extinguished.

**Investiture of the Dragon and Jade Ritual**

Proceed to the Grotto-Heaven, and outside its gate, select level ground—or a boat, or a stone surface. All must be swept clean and made pure to establish the altar. Prepare five mats of refined cloth and two ritual towels. Blue and crimson cloths may be used for offering wine, tea, or broth, with five sets of vessels. Fruits, cakes, and viands shall be provided according to what is available. For the state, sixty portions; for officials and commoners, twenty-four. Arrange four incense burners, four censer cloths, and four tables. At the center, set the Three Treasures’ position; to the left, the Grotto-Heaven’s divine immortals; to the right, the Day-Officer Earth Deity and the Surveillance Deities, along with the master’s memorial-filing position. Once the arrangements are complete, sprinkle the altar’s exterior with fragrant water to dispel impurities and perform the exorcism as in the usual rites.

Master and disciples must bathe and purify themselves, prioritizing reverence. Negligence, clamor, or irreverence shall incur severe penalties. Next, the assembly is called to bow, each venerating the master and visualizing as prescribed. Then, invoke the Three Honored Ones, the Scripture Treasure’s Mystic Master, the Five Stars and Five Emperors, the Five Peaks and Five Visceral Spirits, the Five Numinous Ones, and the Three-Colored Clouds of the Scripture Transmission Masters. Envision the local Grotto-Heaven’s perfected immortals, the divine administrators, the surveillance officials, and the Day-Officer Earth Deity seated solemnly in formation, their ranks distinct. Once the visualization of the fast is complete, proceed according to the ritual statutes.

**Method for Presenting the Mountain Memorial**
First, outside the Grotto-Heaven’s gate, arrange the altar. Bow to the master and visualize the deities as in the original method. Each then venerates the master and visualizes as prescribed.
Next, recite the *Guardian Spirit Incantation*.
Then, strike the ritual drum twenty-four times.
Proceed to the *Incense Offering*.

Supreme Three Heavens’ Primordial Originator of the Three Qi, Most High Lord Lao, summon forth from within our bodies the Three and Five Merit Officers, the Left and Right Attendant Envoys, the Left and Right Incense-Bearing Dragon-Riding Couriers, the Golden Lads Attending Incense, the Jade Maidens Scattering Flowers and Transmitting Words, and the Five Thearchs’ Direct Talismans and Daily Incense Officials—thirty-six of each—forthwith. Let those who emerge don their solemn regalia and report to the local Earth Deity and the True Officials of the Realm. We now, in this very act of burning incense, reverently perform this rite for [Name/Official Title], on behalf of [Matter], beseeching the establishment of the Supreme Yellow Register Grand Fast. May the rite be perfected and the matter concluded, that we may present this memorial to the numinous mountain.

For the water memorial: may it become a numinous spring.
For the earth memorial: may it become a numinous altar.
We pray that the qi of the Most High’s Ten Directions’ True Perfected Ones descend and flow into our bodies, that our petition swiftly ascend to the presence of the Most High’s Boundless Great Dao, before the Kunlun and Five Peaks, the numinous mountains and grotto-heavens.

Each makes three bows.

For the water memorial: before the Most High’s Boundless Great Dao, the Divine King of Yang Valley, and the Water Thearchs of the Nine Rivers’ Water Palace.
For the earth memorial: before the Most High’s Boundless Great Dao, the August Spirits of the Nine Lands, and the Great Gods of the Earth Palace.

Next, each declares their ritual rank.

Having assumed their ritual ranks, they proceed with the Yellow Register Dragon-Presentation Rite. Your servant [Name] humbly petitions the Great Luo’s Jade Clarity, the Boundless and Supreme Perfected Great Dao, the Primordial Celestial Worthy of Original Commencement, the Most High Dao Lord, the Most High Lord Lao, the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures, the Great Dharma Masters of the Mystic Realm, the Three Treasures’ Sacred Assembly, and all the Venerable Numinous Ones. We reverently hope for their radiant response, that they may condescend to descend in mercy.

Kneeling with heads bowed, we humbly petition the immortals of [Name] Grotto-Heaven, the grotto-heaven’s divine administrators, and the perfected ones who have attained the Dao. We implore their true mercy, that they may cast their light downward.

We reverently summon the local governing deities, the Void-Space Surveillance Officials, the Incense Officials and Envoys, the Three Caverns’ Divine Might, the Realm’s True Officials, the Guardian Generals and Officers, and all the rightful gods of mountains, waters, rivers, and marshes. We beseech their sagely mercy, that they may descend in full attendance.

Next, three pinches of incense are offered, followed by tea and wine.

Then, kneeling in prostration, the invocation is made.

Your Majesty, we reverently summon the Most High Boundless Dao’s Three Supreme Ones, the great holy multitudes of the ten directions who have attained the Dao, the perfected lords and venerable elders, the Eastern Florescence and Southern Culmen, the Western Numinous and Northern Perfected, the thirty-six divisions of revered scriptures, the Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Center, the True Persons of the Great Ultimate, the Three True Persons of the Mysterious Unity, the divine immortals of the heavens’ sun, moon, and stellar lodges, the gods and immortals of the Kunlun Upper Palace, the Golden Mother of the Western Numinous, the True Lords of the Five Marchmounts, the rightful officers of the Sacred Mountain, the Hidden and Huo Reservoir Lords, the Venerable Elder of Mount Qingcheng, the Envoys of Mount Lu, the secluded ones of Mount Zhong’s lofty peaks, the western Mysterious Ramparts and Terrace, the great deities of the mounded hills, the Northern Bureau of the Three Officials, the Six Palaces’ Nether Offices, the gods of heaven above and earth below, the numinous hosts of the dark underworld, the Registrars of Life and Death, the Southern Upper Three Gates, and all the supremely divine and numinous host of immortals.

Your servant, born of dust and defilement, is blind and ignorant. Yet by the good karma of ten thousand kalpas, I have depended upon and received the transformation of the Dao. Reverently proclaiming the merciful teachings, I assist the state and establish merit, succoring beings and delivering persons, guiding and aiding the Dharma. On behalf of so-and-so official so-and-so, I have performed the grand Yellow Register fast, directly offering it for so-and-so and universally for all souls, both living and deceased, repenting sins and seeking grace. May offenses and transgressions be dissolved, and the ritual be wholly accomplished. The petition is entrusted to the Sacred Mountain, conveyed by the golden dragon courier. We beseech that names be stricken from the ledgers of sin and inscribed in the Jade Calendar. May the gods and immortals release the ninefold ancestors and sevenfold forebears, the nine clans and all kin, those who have passed before and after, redeeming their evil roots and delivering them from Mount Fengdu and the Terrace of Tai, the twenty-four hells, the courts of the Five Marchmounts, the nine nether realms, the mountains of knives and forests of swords, the lands of suffering and affliction. May their souls behold the light and forever receive deliverance, turning the wheel to receive transformation and roaming freely through the gates of blessing. May their tombs rest undisturbed, lawsuits cease, the whole household receive fortune, and all be laden with grace. May demonic influences be eradicated, auspicious omens arise daily, the cultivation of the Dao attain perfection, and all forever ascend to the ranks of immortals. Should this petition be granted, we shall look up in reverence to the mysterious grace.

Your servant so-and-so, with utmost trepidation and awe, bows his head to the ground, prostrates himself, and respectfully submits this entreaty.

Rising, he holds the petition and offers incense upon the inkstone. Next, having read the petition to its end, he seals it with blue paper and binds it with green silk, completing the dragon-button jade tablet. The disciple holds it above the incense, and the Dharma Master intones the incantation:

"Mysterious Above, open and illumine; the Primordial Beginning oversees the true.
The Five Elders of the Supreme Emperor, the red writ of cinnabar script.
The origin of heaven and earth, governing the Three Primes in their entirety.
Gather qi and summon the assembly, hastening the ascent of immortals.
The exalted talisman and mandate, universally proclaimed to the ten heavens.
Sun, moon, and stellar lodges, the numinous Marchmounts and Sacred Mountain.
Above in heaven, below on earth, the great gods of the dark and cold.
Registrars of Life and Death, the Southern Upper Three Gates.
Receive the jade petition, inscribe names in the cinnabar register.
Strike from the ledgers of sin, promote to the ranks of imperial ministers.
So-and-so, relying upon the supreme Dao, performs the fast and establishes merit,
redeeming the nine ancestors and all suffering souls.
The ritual now complete, we reverently follow the Sacred Mountain’s decree,
presenting the jade petition to beseech the erasure of sin.
May all receive deliverance, without enmity or kinship.
Depart from the three evil destinies, souls ascend to the nine heavens.
Delivered in life and death, eternally preserved through ten thousand kalpas.
Today we make this supplication, may the myriad gods all hear."

We beseech that the Dragon Tablet, the *Jade Instructions*, and the *Dragon Tablet Admonitions* be bound with golden clasps, and presented to the covenant-keeping Perfected Officials. May the petition be granted as supplicated, transmitted by the Golden Dragon Courier.

The incantation complete, all officials bow twice.
Next, the tablet is cast into the grotto.
Next, the *Dragon Tablet Eulogy* is recited.
Next, three prostrations.
Next, three offerings of incense.
Next, the incense burner is replenished.
Next, the *Hymn to the Immortals* is chanted.
Next, the offerings are withdrawn.

**Rite of Casting the Water Tablet**
Reverently attend to the master’s contemplation.
Recite the *Guardian Spirit Incantation*.
Strike the ritual drum.
Open the incense burner.
Proclaim the dharma rank.
Summon the Perfected.
Present tea and wine.

Next, kneel and address:
Your servant reverently petitions the Most High Boundless Great Dao, the Three Supreme Ones of the Great Dao, the host of great sages who have attained the Way in the ten directions, the perfected lords and venerable masters, the Eastern Florescence and Southern Culmen, the Western Numinous and Northern Perfected, the thirty-six divisions of sacred scriptures, the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center, the Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate, the sun and moon, the Five Stars, the Seven Primes of the Northern Dipper, the Five Peaks and Four Quarters, the sun’s cavern of eternal radiance, the grotto-valleys and dark recesses, the Divine Kings of the Immortals, the Great Emperor of Fusang, the Nine Elder Lords of the Immortal Capital, the Three Rivers and Four Seas, the Nine Jiang and Huai Marshes, the Three Officials and Nine Bureaus, the Twelve Water Sources and Nine Water Lords, the great gods of the dark and cold, the host of immortals of the water palaces, and all assembled spirits.

Your servant, born in the lower realm, is endowed with a humble and common constitution. Yet by karmic affinity with the Dao, I have encountered this sagely dispensation. The Numinous Treasure bestows its transformation, the Great Dharma delivers beings, assisting the state and establishing merit, upholding the compassionate teachings. Today, on behalf of the official So-and-so, I have performed the supreme Yellow Register Great Fast, offering deliverance for the departed spirit So-and-so, universally encompassing the living and the dead, praying for grace and atoning for sins, beseeching blessings and dispelling calamities. May enmities be resolved, and life and fortune be prolonged. The ritual now complete, we cast the tablet into the numinous spring, transmitted by the Golden Dragon Courier. We beseech the erasure from the ledgers of death and the inscription of life. May the gods and immortals grant renewal. May the nine ancestors and seven generations be delivered from the roots of suffering, departing the radiant valleys and the dark, cold realms of the netherworld. Bathed and refined, may they ascend to the heavens. May tombs be peaceful and auspicious, and all misfortunes forever obliterated. May the entire household receive blessings, their spirits and qi at rest and flourishing. May learning and understanding be illuminated, wisdom perfected and radiant. May the true Dharma be proclaimed, and treacherous villains subdued. May the three realms attain deliverance, merits fulfilled and deeds complete. May the emperor be secure and the state prosper. We reverently present this petition, beseeching that it be granted as supplicated.

Your servant So-and-so, with awe and trepidation, bows his head and prostrates himself, twice bowing reverently to address.

The address complete, kneel.
Knock the teeth thrice, and read the tablet inscription to its end.
Seal the tablet with blue paper, binding the Dragon Tablet and jade clasp with blue silk.

Instruct the disciple to hold it over the incense and recite the incantation:
The Five Elders of the Primordial Beginning, the Most High and Venerable.
The perfected of the ten directions, the numinous immortals of Mount Taihua.
The red script proclaims the mandate, no hidden realm left unaddressed.
Above, it ascends to the nine heavens, beseeching the descent of the jade missive.
The sun and moon, the Five Stars, the Seven Primes of the Northern Dipper.
It petitions the Five Peaks at the center, the numinous mountains of the four quarters.
Below, it petitions the rivers and seas, the twelve water sources.
The Nine Water Lords, the great gods of the dark and cold.
Today we present this supplication, may all wishes be declared.
So-and-so has performed the fast and practiced the Dao, universally for the living and the dead.
We beseech redemption for the seven ancestors, and the dissolution of karmic roots of sin.
Reverently casting the earthen tablet, may it be heard above.
Inscribe names in the water palace, may the departed ascend to heaven.
Delivered in life and death, may all gods hear.

We beseech that the Dragon Tablet, with the *Jade Instructions* bound by golden clasps, be presented to the covenant-keeping Water Officials. May the *Jade Instructions* serve as the pledge to the Water Officials. Grant as supplicated, the *Jade Instructions* serving as the petition. Transmitted by the Golden Dragon Courier.

The incantation complete, all officials bow twice.
Next, cast the tablet into the water.
Next, recite the *Dragon Tablet Eulogy*.
Next, three prostrations.
Next, three offerings of incense.
Next, replenish the incense burner.
Next, chant the *Hymn to the Immortals*.

Next, the offerings are cleared, dispersed according to the usual method. The *Earthen Tablet Casting Rite* proceeds as follows:

Invoke the master’s mindfulness, recite the *Guardian Spirit Incantation*, strike the ritual drum, and kindle the incense burner. Next, declare the dharma ranks and invoke the perfected. Offer tea and wine.

Next, kneel and make the petition:

Your humble servant reverently addresses the Most High, Boundless Dao, the Three Supreme Ones of the Great Dao; the host of great sages who have attained the Way in the ten directions; the perfected lords and venerable elders; the Eastern Florescence, Southern Culmen, Western Numinous, and Northern Perfected; the Five Elder Thearchs; the thirty-six divisions of revered scriptures; the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center; the Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate; the Three Perfected of the Mysterious Unity; the Great Thearch of Fengdu; the sovereigns of the nine provinces’ palaces and the lords of the Yellow Springs; the imperial numina of the boundless world and the nine lands of the August Spirits; the Central August of the Seasonal Thearchs and the High Perfected; the Yellow Spirit of Earth of the nine lands; the Five Thearchs of the Earthly Bureau; the officials and spirits of the Three Realms; the local deities of land and domain; and all numinous beings of this abode and oratory.

Your servant, born of common qi and foolish by nature, has by karmic fortune encountered the true Dharma and met with good causes and conditions. At the opening of the numinous treasure’s radiance and the proclamation of the *Red Writ*, I was permitted, despite my humble and defiled state, to serve the true and perfected. Aiding the state and the times, I establish merit and propagate the teachings.

On behalf of the official so-and-so, who has undertaken the great *Yellow Register* fast, I offer this to deliver the departed spirit so-and-so, universally encompassing the living and the dead, dispelling calamities and atoning for sins. Having supplicated for blessings and grace, the Daoist rites are now complete. The tablet is cast upon the numinous altar, transmitted by the Golden Dragon Courier. I beseech that earthly misfortunes be erased and their names stricken from the rolls of sin. May they attain deliverance and rebirth, their forms and spirits safeguarded. May their names be inscribed in the *Jade Calendar* of the Nine Elder Immortals’ capital. May the nine generations of ancestors, parents, and kin of the womb; the departed and the newly deceased; all partake of blessed causes. May they depart from the nine depths below, the eight gates, the hells, and the midst of torment. May their transgressions dissolve, their households be purified and at peace. May the roots of evil be severed, and may they ascend to the halls of fortune. May so-and-so’s studies be perfected and their merit and conduct resplendent. May the living and the dead share in this blessing, steadfast and unshaken. May the emperor receive fortune and the world know peace.

I reverently make this petition, beseeching your compassionate response. Your servant so-and-so, with awe and trepidation, bows his head to the ground, prostrates twice, and humbly submits.

The petition complete, kneel once more. Strike the teeth twelve times and read the tablet’s inscription. Next, seal the tablet with yellow paper, bind it with plain silk, and affix the dragon clasp and jade disk. Have a disciple hold it above the incense and recite the incantation:

The heavens and earth unfold, the nine qi divide their numen.
The Three Origins share the same tally, the ten directions shine in clarity.
The Five Elder Thearchs open the true and guide the living.
The cinnabar writ and red script, the primordial essence of the Most High.
Universally proclaimed beneath heaven, the imperial numina of the nine lands.
Today, I make this supplication, and the myriad immortals decree life.
So-and-so undertakes the fast and practices the Dao for the living and the dead.
I vow for my immortals: may their jade names be cast.
Great Thearch of the Earthly Bureau, erase their sinful forms.
Submit the tablet to the upper palace, inscribe their names in the *Flourishing Azure* register.
May they swiftly ascend, their numen shared by heaven and earth.
May the nine generations of kin, their rotting bones, be renewed in glory.
May their souls ascend to the Southern Palace and receive transformation in the immortal courts.
Today, I issue this decree—may all gods hear.
Hear and grant peace; the *Dragon Tablet Petition* reads: "hear" as "grant."
With the golden clasp, I manifest utmost sincerity.
Grant as supplicated, presented by the Golden Dragon Courier.

The incantation complete, all officials bow twice.
Next, cast the tablet into the center of the altar’s earth.
Next, recite the *Dragon Tablet Eulogy*.
Next, three prostrations.
Next, three offerings of incense.
Next, replenish the incense burner.
Next, chant the *Hymn to the Immortals*.

Next, the offerings are cleared, dispersed as in the usual rites.

For the *Earth Tablet*, on the night of the merit-concluding rite, once the recitation of incantations and hymns is complete, by dawn it may be buried within the altar—no further petition or announcement is required.

Here, from the ritual method of Master Zhang Chengxian, three tablets are presented in petition, each corresponding to a distinct true rank; thus they are recorded again. If performing a *zhai* rite with the *Earth Tablet*, it may be cast immediately after the incantation is recited at the merit-concluding *jiao*. As for the *Mountain* and *Water Tablets*, though the incantation is recited at the time of the merit-concluding rite, if a *jiao* is later established at the grotto site, one must follow this sequence in full: each tablet is recited, sealed with its incantation, and then cast—this is thorough and complete. One must not, having already petitioned at the altar, proceed directly to cast them at the mountain. The true numina of those places may fail to receive and acknowledge them. The merit may not reach its destination, and the loss would be grave; one must be meticulous and prudent.

The reason for petitioning these *Mountain* and *Water Tablets* at the altar is that the *zhai* sponsor and disciples, bound by public and private affairs, may be unable to journey in person to the grotto heavens. Thus, they are petitioned together at the altar. If the *zhai* sponsor and disciples do not shrink from the distance of mountains and waters or the toil of ascent, and personally accompany the officials to the grotto palace, then at the time of the merit-concluding rite, after the memorial is presented and the *Earth Tablet* petitioned, the *Mountain* and *Water Tablets* are retained for the journey. The ritual will then be even more fitting. One must act with careful deliberation.

When handling the three tablets, it is most excellent to burn one or two hundred paper coins for the local earth gods—this ensures the documents are not obstructed.

Master Daoist Zhang Chengxian of the Tang said: After ascending the altar and receiving the *Central Alliance of the Numinous Treasure*, in accordance with the *Spontaneous Golden Statutes*, cast ten golden clasps, releasing dragons into clear springs, as the Dao of seeking immortality. Ascend the altar again to receive the *Red Writs of the Five Elders*, the *Two Registers*, and the *Staff of Strategic Thought*, stabilizing resolve. According to the *Luminous True Statutes*, cast thirty-seven dragon clasps in three sets of three, for the three sites of mountain, water, and dwelling, as tokens for the study of immortality. Then, following the *Jade Formulae*, separately cast twenty-seven dragon clasps in nine sets, on the eight solar terms, into mountains, waters, and dwellings, to seek the erasure of sin from the registers and the inscription of names in heaven.

Furthermore, at the conclusion of the *Yellow Register Zhai*, a *Dragon Tablet* is also cast, following only the *Three Yuan Tablet* texts, without additional petitions or established oral formulae. The masses, following one another in ignorance, have practiced this in confusion. In the past, I encountered Master Lu, who communed with the divine and entered the subtle, whose words accorded with principle and never failed to elicit response. He transmitted the wondrous in his heart, yet his texts lacked ritual protocols. If one were to follow the scriptural texts literally and cast them carelessly, the gods of mountains, waters, and dwellings—unable to recognize the records of the hidden and manifest—would find it wildly incongruous. Thus, the *Mysterious Ancestor* composed these petitions for the three sites, each addressing its respective immortal bureau, and separately issued three established formulae for the tablets. Now, as I examine them clearly, they must have been inscribed at that time. With sins erased and names recorded, the nine lineages are immediately delivered. The household bears glory, studies flourish, and in life and death, immortality is attained. I reveal this to my disciples and enjoin them to hold it in reverence.

Du Guangting said: The Great Dao, with the one *qi*, transforms and gives rise to the Three Powers, shaping the myriad existences. Thus, it divides the courts of the Three Yuan to govern sin and fortune—namely, the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water, who truly preside over the Three Yuan. The length of human life and early death, sin and goodness, fortune and misfortune, are all bound to them. The formats of the three register tablets are also the canonical forms of the Three Yuan. In the method of performing the *zhai*, one must cast the three tablets to petition the Three Yuan. Thus, the *Mountain Tablet* is cast into the grotto heavens and grotto palaces, petitioning the Heavenly Official of the Upper Yuan; the *Water Tablet* is cast into the numinous springs and water palaces, petitioning the Water Official of the Lower Yuan; and the *Earth Tablet* is cast into the altar or dwelling, petitioning the Earth Official of the Middle Yuan. Within the texts of the tablets, the ranks and titles of the true numina are clearly evident.

In recent times, only the *Mountain* and *Water Tablets* are cast. In the regions of the Huai and Zhe rivers, there are records of the three-tablet rite, long practiced. Now, upon examining the origins, I have found the texts described by Master Zhang Chengxian, which petition the Three Yuan and are quite clear and fitting. Thus, the casting of the three tablets is indeed without doubt. It may be followed as a permanent model. Not only when receiving scriptures, but also when casting the three tablets in the *zhai* for deliverance, the merit is entirely bound to the Three Yuan. If all three tablets are employed, the merit of the good deeds is fully conveyed to the courts of the Three Officials. Those who practice and uphold this should not harbor doubts.

The rites for the *Prohibited Altar*, the *Lamp Offering*, and the *Casting of the Dragon Jade* are all taken from Du Guangting’s *Yellow Register Zhai Rituals*.

Here ends *Formal Rituals for the Supreme Yellow Register Great Zhai*, Scroll Twenty.
Here begins *Formal Rituals for the Supreme Yellow Register Great Zhai*, Scroll Twenty-One.

Master Tang Cheng, Du Guangting, compiled the *Rites of the Gate of Liturgies* for the *Ascending the Altar and Circulating the Scriptures*, as revised by the Enforcing-Dao Immortal Officer Jiang Shuyu.

When performing the Yellow Register and Numinous Treasure *zhai* rites, the Dao is practiced and scriptures are circulated thrice daily. Through the six periods of day and night, disciples offer petitions, recitations, and invocations to pray for blessings. As the timing of the *xingdao* and *xiaoxi* rites shifts, one may separately ascend the altar to circulate scriptures, chant praises, and perform the liturgy—all in accordance with the *Golden Register* protocols.

Upon ascending the altar and taking the high seat, the recitation of scriptures and the observance of *weiyi* proceed as prescribed. If wind or rain disrupts the schedule, or if other liturgies intervene, the *xingdao* and scripture-circulation rites may follow in succession.

For the *Ascending the Altar and Circulating the Scriptures* rite, the Dharma Master dons the *Crown of the Primordial Beginning*, a yellow skirt, and a purple-brown *pei* robe adorned with the five-colored numinous radiance—this is called the *Dharma Robe*. The assembled officials wear their usual attire.

First, the assembled officials, arrayed in full *weiyi*, welcome the Dharma Master and proceed before the Mysterious Master to stand in formation. The Dharma Master then offers incense.

Next, the *Hymn to the Dao* is chanted,
followed by the *Huaxia Hymn* as an introit, and the ascent to the altar proceeds as prescribed.

The Dharma Master ascends the *Gate of Heaven*, approaches the incense table of the imperial seat, and recites the *Incense Offering Mantra*.
Next, the Dharma Master and the *Dujang* each offer incense at their respective stations.

Then, the *Three Refuges* are chanted:
*"With wholehearted devotion, we take refuge in the Dao-Treasures of the Ten Directions.
May all beings turn their minds toward the Way and universally offer their reverence.
With wholehearted devotion, we take refuge in the Scripture-Treasures of the Ten Directions.
May all beings awaken to understanding and receive, uphold, recite, and chant.
With wholehearted devotion, we take refuge in the Master-Treasures of the Ten Directions.
May all beings ascend the Dharma Bridge without obstruction."*

Next, the assembly in the ritual arena is instructed: *"Hold the tablets before your hearts and sit properly, as prescribed."*
Then, hymns are chanted in accordance with the liturgy,
followed by the *Hymn of Past Lives*:
*"The truth of past lives is certain,
yet the feeble dismiss it as nonexistent.
All is judged by what the eye beholds—
what passes from sight is deemed distant.
The great sages, enlightened by the Dao’s teachings,
grieve for the stubborn and foolish.
Tenderly, they lament the suffering of their disciples,
earnestly, they express their concern for us."*

Next, the *Dujang* initiates the scripture recitation:
*"In the primordial vastness of the Cloud-Script of the Great Void,
amidst the eons of beginningless time,
now distant, now near, now submerged, now afloat,
wandering the Five Directions, spanning over a *zhang* in expanse—
the Heavenly Perfected, the August One, took up the brush and inscribed
the *Dongzhang* scriptures, followed by the Numinous Talismans.
The Primordial Beginning descended, and the True Writs were revealed.
Luminous in their presence, obscure in their absence,
they heal the deeply afflicted and raise the drowned from the dark depths.
By this means, one may ascend to the Immortal Realms.
Today, on behalf of the *zhai* sponsor [Name], we establish this Supreme Yellow Register Great *Zhai* to offer proper deliverance for the deceased kin [Name],
and universally deliver the souls of all present, that they may ascend to the blessed realms.
We now gather the assembly, the pure multitude ascends the altar,
to reverently recite the *Supreme Scripture of the Numinous Treasure of the Highest Clarity, the Limitless Salvation of Humanity, the Wondrous Upper Chapter*—
the foremost of the myriad scriptures, the root of the ten thousand Daoist practices,
most fitting for recitation during the performance of the Great *Zhai*.
For a three-day *zhai*, it is essential to complete ten recitations, adhering to the number ten.
If one can additionally recite the *Chapters of the Divine Embryo* and other scriptures, it is even more excellent.

After each recitation, offerings are made to the Three Treasures, the August Thearchs of the Ten Poles, the administrators of Earth and Water, the sovereigns of the Nether Gates, the officials of the Three Realms, and all responsive numinous spirits.
May the deceased souls [Names] and all the imprisoned and sin-laden spirits of the Nine Glooms be delivered from suffering and attain rebirth in the proper realms.
We pray that the Flying Celestials descend to observe, and the August Thearchs chant from afar.
With the turning of a single numinous sound, the hells of the Nine Glooms fall silent;
with the hidden resonance of ten recitations, the sunken souls of the Five Paths cease their retributions.
May grace flow to the departed and blessings extend to the living.
May all sentient beings universally attain the fruits of the Dao.

For this supreme cause, we invoke the names of the Great Sage, the Primordial Beginning Heavenly Worthy;
the Supreme Dao Lord; the Supreme Lord Lao; the Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy;
the Heavenly Worthy Who Saves by Sound; the Heavenly Worthy Who Delivers from the Nine Glooms;
the Heavenly Worthy Who Crosses the Vermilion Mound; the Heavenly Worthy of the Great Dharma Bridge;
the Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions Who Save from Suffering;
the Left and Right Perfected of the Highest Clarity; the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center;
and all inconceivable merits and virtues."*

Next, the assembly is instructed: *"Meditate in stillness, as prescribed."*
Each visualizes themselves seated amidst clouds of blue, yellow, and white *qi*,
with the Azure Dragon to the left, the White Tiger to the right,
the Vermilion Bird before, and the Dark Warrior behind.
The sun, moon, and five stars illuminate their sides,
while the attending scripture immortals array themselves within the altar.
A halo, like the sun’s image, appears around them.
When this is complete, they swallow saliva thrice and click their teeth thrice,
then silently recite the *Mysterious Essence Mantra of Opening the Scripture*.

For the circulation of all Numinous Treasure scriptures, this visualization of the scriptural text should be observed.
For differing practices, follow the respective methods.

*"Silent, it reaches the ultimate origin,
towering in emptiness, spanning eons.
The profound writ of the Vast and Mysterious—
who can fathom its depths?
Entering the path of the Great Vehicle,
countless kalpas pass.
Neither born nor extinguished,
yet born from the lotus.
Transcending the paths of the Three Realms,
with compassion, they untangle the world’s snares.
The Perfected, of supreme virtue,
become immortals for all generations."*

Next, the *Hymn of Initiating the Scripture* is chanted:
*"We bow our heads before the Heavenly Worthy of the Void."*

Then, the assembly is instructed: *"Please circulate the *Scripture of the Limitless Salvation of Humanity*, in accordance with the liturgy."*
At the point of the secret mantra, follow the text in practice.

Each visualizes the Thirty-Two Heavens, where nine-colored clouds interweave,
forming palaces and towering terraces.
The Heavenly Thearchs, clad in celestial robes and crowns, appear distinctly.
Beginning with the Heaven of the Grand Primordial, they click their teeth once,
then bow once in their minds, proceeding through the Thirty-Two Heavens in sequence.
Upon completion, they close their eyes and meditate in stillness.

From the Three Elixir Fields, the primordial *qi* emerges—
first as blue, yellow, and white clouds like threads, gradually thickening as they leave the body.
The clouds envelop the practitioner, then the seat, the table, and the scripture mat, surrounding all.
Lush and swirling, they encircle the altar, then expand outward to enclose a quadrant of space,
eventually merging with heaven and earth in profound unity.

Next, they visualize the Azure Dragon emerging from the liver to stand on the left,
the White Tiger from the lungs to stand on the right,
the Vermilion Bird from the heart to stand before,
the Dark Warrior from the kidneys to stand behind,
the Lion from the spleen in the Lower Elixir Field, with twelve lions arrayed on either side,
and nine white cranes emerging from the *Niwan* Palace, encircling the four directions.
From the Six Harmonies Palace behind the *fangcun* between the brows,
the sun and moon emerge from the eyes, nine *cun* from the face,
their light illuminating the altar, penetrating and radiant.
Only then is the secret mantra recited.

Silently recite the secret words, letting not even the ears hear them.

The Most High Mysterious Prime, Supreme Lord of the Dao, summons forth from within this servant’s body the Three and Five Merit Officers, the Left and Right Attendant Messengers, the Golden Lads of Incense, the Jade Maidens of Transmission, and the Thirty-Two Fragrant Officers of the Five Thearchs’ Direct Talismans and Direct Days—each in their thirty-two ranks—to receive and convey these words.

We, on behalf of the officiant [Name], now offer the deceased kin [Name] in proper rite, and universally present all departed souls gathered here for the performance of the Supreme Yellow Register Grand Fast.

Today, as we ascend the altar to circumambulate the scriptures, may these offerings aid in their deliverance. May what is here proclaimed ascend directly to the august presence of the Most High Primordial Lord of the Thirty-Two Heavens.

This done, draw the eightfold azure *qi* of the Eastern Eight Heavens eight times into the liver; the eightfold vermilion *qi* of the Southern Eight Heavens eight times into the heart; the eightfold white *qi* of the Western Eight Heavens eight times into the lungs; the eightfold dark *qi* of the Northern Eight Heavens eight times into the kidneys.

Only then begin the recitation of the scriptures.

When the recitation is complete, next chant the *Hymn of Rising from the Seat*:
*For all beings yet to come,*
*May this sow the seeds of good affinity.*
*Should they awaken to the truth,*
*Let them look up in gratitude to the mysterious grace.*

The hymn concluded, the assembled officers rise, and the master of intonation extols the scriptures.

Consider well: the Three Caverns’ precious scriptures are the supreme models of the myriad heavens. They weave the *qi* of soaring mystery into chapters of cloud-seal script, their meaning surpassing all unborn things, their text enduring through eternal kalpas. Thus do heaven and earth by them divide and order themselves; sun and moon by them revolve and course; ghosts and spirits by them transform and adapt; and humankind by them is enlightened and delivered. Therefore, those who chant them ascend in form to the crimson empyrean; those who hear them are reborn in spirit among the azure heavens. None—whether of the celestial or mortal realms, whether living or dead—do not look up to them in reliance, depend upon them for refuge. They are the bridge for all classes of beings, the gateway for all perfected ones. Vast and majestic is their model; praise of them knows no end.

Now this disciple [Name], having inaugurated the Yellow Register Grand Fast, performs the ninefold Dao-circumambulations and the sixfold scripture-circumambulations. May we, by the power of the true vehicle, uplift and transcend the departed souls. Above, may this benefit the state and the family; below, may it protect those still living.

Now, as the scripture-case is opened to expound its profound mysteries, its resonance pierces the Three Heavens; as the scroll is held to chant its arcane verses, its sound reaches five hundred million. May the golden maidens attendant with incense weave fragrant characters in the midst of heaven; may the jade lads in charge of scriptures present the sacred texts upon the bamboo slips. Thus shall past transgressions dissolve in former kalpas, and blessings descend upon this very day. The living and the dead alike shall bear the grace of renewed prosperity; all beings, moving and still, shall rejoice in the virtue of growth and fulfillment. By this supreme goodness, may all be adorned and perfected. May the Three Wretched Paths cease their torments of anguish; may the Nine Nights end their bitterness and sorrow.

So too, may all classes of beings—whether stirring or inert, whether dimly sentient—together board the vessel of the Six Perfections and reach the shore of the Three Clarities.

Next, the chanting of the *Three Hearings of the Scripture*:
After hearing the scripture, may all beings have their myriad sins swept away and the sprouts of goodness grow.
After hearing the scripture, may all beings deeply enter the Dharma-gate and take refuge in faith and acceptance.
After hearing the scripture, may all beings forever sever delusion and constantly cultivate the supreme Dao.

The Dharma-master strikes his teeth three times, swallows his saliva three times, and visualizes the Three Primordial Sovereign Ladies in the Golden Flower Palace, appearing as infants.

Next, the circumambulation:
Recite the *Hymn in Praise of the Most High’s Scripture of Wisdom*.

The Most High’s Mysterious Void Sect exalts the Dao and venerates its scriptures.
With a single bow and lift of the head, one attains immortality—
through countless kalpas, age upon age.
Majestic is the virtue of the Great Perfected,
serene in the cause of non-birth.
Celestial radiance weaves empty structures,
riding the void to journey by nature’s decree.
Sun and moon blaze as torches,
peace and harmony bring joy without end.
Those who study immortality cast aside ornate thoughts,
each thought building upon the last.
Coming and going disturb my spirit,
restlessness leaves no experience unscathed.
Extinguish thoughts and dwell in tranquil emptiness,
whispering into the silence of the void.
Seek the scriptures as if parched with thirst,
hold fast to your resolve like unyielding metal or stone.
Preserve the child and ascend the mysterious path,
the Five Spirits pass through talismanic registers.
Cross me with the practice of the Six Perfections,
thus unbind the Three Nets.
Purify the fast and worship the Primordial Simplicity,
exhale and inhale to nurture the cloud-sprout.
Roam freely within the Golden Gate,
the Jade Capital is my home.
Naturally, the Seven Treasures arise,
each person seated upon a lotus.
Above, they chew the fruit of the Mysterious Capital,
below, they drink deeply of the Hollow Melon.
Their countenance shines brighter than ten suns,
what reckoning of years or kalpas?
The Dharma-drum summons celestial immortals,
the tolling bell subdues the great demons.
A divine wind fans fragrant blossoms,
brilliant and resplendent, unfurling rich robes.
The Great Perfected plucks the cloud-zither,
the assembled immortals strum the numinous harp.
Elegant songs resound in the Three Heavens,
scattering wisdom through the Jade Flower Grove.
The seven generations ascend the Hall of Blessings,
by this they tread the mysterious sound.
If past-life virtue was insufficient,
this scripture remains distant and hard to find.
Those whose faith in the Dao is unwavering,
though they soar, may yet sink.
The Most High’s Dao of Non-Action
flourishes when planted in the hearts of all.
To study the Dao, one must have unwavering faith,
revere the master as one’s closest kin.
Draw near the radiance and embrace the pure void,
diligently renewing with each passing day.
Until all beings are delivered,
I shall not deliver myself.
Great vows bring weighty retribution,
mysterious virtue is surely thus.
Hidden evils and deep sins
confront one like a turning wheel.
To study the Dao is also arduous,
day and night, cultivate the field of blessings.
Planting virtue is like planting a tree,
piling baskets of earth to form a mountain.
If you can immerse yourself in the mysterious and exalted,
you will soar lightly into the azure heavens.
Cultivate this Dao of Non-Action,
and you shall be bound in affinity with goodness.
The Most High’s most recondite scripture,
is called the *Scripture of Wisdom*.
To relieve suffering requires great talent,
transcending the mundane to attain immortality.
The numinous countenance is what the world relies upon,
radiant as a lotus in the deep pool.
Each person’s conduct has its root,
all stemming from past-life merit.
Establish virtue while the time is ripe,
make vows and none will go unfulfilled.
Good and evil both await their reckoning,
the principle of rise and fall is unfathomable.
The worthy uphold the Dharma’s words,
the Dao also lies in silent forgetting.
To comprehend this is the great wisdom,
ascending to become a Lord of the Great Ultimate.
A jeweled canopy joins the jade chariot,
commanding the nine dragons to drive.
The Golden Flower holds aloft the *Cavern Scripture*,
immortal youths all bear incense.
Whistling songs resound through the Mysterious Capital,
jade chimes strike the jasper bell.
Rising to stand in the Great Clarity,
transcending radiance to roam the Purple Empyrean.
Uphold the Dharma’s net without fail,
wander the mysterious ultimate in freedom.
Ten thousand kalpas are but last night,
a thousand springs like the morning dawn.
Towering, they shade the cloud-flower,
grasping the branches of the Jeweled Grove.
Incense smoke arises naturally,
the mysterious steps ascend in a whirlwind.
Spiritual banners unfurl with the wind,
fleeting thoughts dissolve in their time.
Extinguish wisdom to expand the great chaos,
let Non-Action become the pure hymn.

Next, chant the *Hymn in Praise of Studying Immortality*,
exit the hall to stand before the Mysterious Master, and dedicate the merit.

The Left Immortal Lord of the Great Ultimate says:
The eight true hymns are all the words of the Most High, the Perfected of the Great Ultimate.
The assembled immortals delight in their recitation,
never divulging them to the world below.
Secretly treasured within the Golden Gate and Jade Chamber,
they are fittingly transmitted to the perfected,
to cultivate the *Numinous Treasure* fast.
They must not be shown to the frivolous and ostentatious—
be cautious, be cautious indeed!

The Perfected of the Great Ultimate says:
The jade maidens and immortal youths who attend the scriptures,
hearing the sounds of this ritual scripture’s hymns and praises,
all rejoice and protect the practitioner.
This great scripture should always be venerated with these hymns.
Even those who silently recite the scripture
should chant them, for they are the words of the highest immortals,
the wondrous essence of cultivating the true.

From the *Numinous Treasure Mysterious Capital Southern Scripture of the Jade Capital*.

The Heavenly Worthy says:
The scriptures are my legacy, guiding the foolish and lost,
able to awaken boundless Dao-mind in all beings.
Intention arises from awakening,
through awakening, one becomes true.
All sages who cultivate and practice
ascend to the fruition of the Dao.
Thus, the Primordial Beginning, with one qi, gave birth to and transformed the Three Qi,
dividing them into the Three Heavens.
The first is the Beginning Qi, known as the Heaven of Pure Tenuity,
the realm of the Heavenly Treasure Lord of the Jade Clarity,
where I manifested.
At the dawn of the Dragon Han kalpa, I was called the Heavenly Worthy of the Formless,
and in this heaven, I revealed the twelve divisions of the *Cavern Real Treasure Scripture*,
to teach the Nine Saints of the heavens—
also known as the Mysterious Masters of the Myriad Heavens,
the Supreme Dharma Kings—
for ninety-nine thousand nine hundred ninety-nine billion kalpas.
The second is the Primordial Qi, known as the Heaven of Yu Remnant,
the realm of the Numinous Treasure Lord of the Highest Clarity,
where I manifested.
At the dawn of the Yan Kang kalpa, I was called the Heavenly Worthy of the Nameless,
and in this heaven, I revealed the twelve divisions of the *Cavern Mystery Treasure Scripture*,
to teach the Nine Perfected of the heavens—
also known as the Healing Kings of the Three Realms,
the Supreme Perfected Lords—
for eighty-eight thousand eight hundred eighty-eight billion kalpas.
The third is the Mysterious Qi, known as the Heaven of Great Red,
the realm of the Divine Treasure Lord of the Great Clarity,
where I manifested.
At the dawn of the Crimson Brightness kalpa, I was called the Heavenly Worthy of the Brahma Form,
also known as the Perfected of Beholding the World,
and in this heaven, I revealed the twelve divisions of the *Cavern Spirit Treasure Scripture*,
to teach the Nine Immortals of the heavens—
also known as the Guides of the Ten Directions,
the Heavenly Worthies of the Utmost Extreme—
for seventy-seven thousand seven hundred seventy-seven billion kalpas.
When the Kai Huang era began, I was called the Vacuous August,
governing the Primal Yang within,
expounding the Three Caverns,
descending to transform the human realm as the Most High Dao Lord,
for sixty-six thousand six hundred sixty-six billion kalpas.
Upon reaching the Shang Huang era, I was called the Primordial Beginning in full,
governing within the Purple Tenuity Palace,
widely disseminating scriptures and precepts
to save and deliver all beings.
The Three Cavern Treasure Scriptures comprise thirty-six divisions,
also called the Three Vehicles of the *Cavern Real Treasure Scriptures*—
this is the Great Vehicle.
The *Cavern Mystery Numinous Treasure Scriptures*—
this is the Middle Vehicle.
The *Cavern Spirit Treasure Scriptures*—
this is the Small Vehicle.
They coalesce the qi of soaring mystery,
naturally forming chapters,
written in jade characters and golden script,
in dragon scripts and phoenix seal-script.

The Great Square spans one zhang and eight corners, its radiant beams descending to instruct the heavens. Circulating through the world, it endures from beginning to end across kalpas, ever turning the Dharma Wheel. At times it is real, at times expedient; sometimes broad, sometimes concise. Adapting to capacities to awaken understanding, it guides practice according to the age. Though heaven and earth may end their course, the Three Caverns shall never perish. They open the path for all ranks of beings, guiding humans and gods alike. The Three Realms and the ten directions all receive its benefits.

Thereafter, at the dawn of each kalpa, the *Cavern Real* descends to transform the world. People embrace virtue and power, dwelling together in non-action. All revere the Most Perfect, attaining long life and the Dao. Next, the *Cavern Mystery* descends, and humanity and all beings gradually decline. Simplicity scatters, frivolity spreads, the Dao is lost, and virtue is betrayed. Finally, the *Cavern Spirit* descends, and humanity grows ever more frivolous. They no longer revere the true and perfect, and their years and lives grow short.

From this point onward, the human heart is corrupted, the Three Caverns cease to spread, and worldly wisdom flourishes day by day. Humans and spirits intermingle, the kalpas hasten, and lifespans do not reach a hundred years. In every thought, impermanence reigns, and the cycle of death and rebirth never ceases. Thus, I manifest again to proclaim and propagate the Three Caverns, disseminating transformation among humankind. Adapting to the capacities of each era, I expound and propagate the scriptural teachings—sometimes great, sometimes small—according to what suits the beings.

Thus, the original texts of the Primordial Beginning were not fully transmitted below. In the Three Pure Realms above and the Four Brahmā Heavens, the perfected and sages cultivate and practice in full. Though in mountain caves and grotto palaces, in seas and sacred peaks and immortal palaces, there is cultivation, it is not complete. This is because the scriptures they practice vary by place, and the Three Caverns are not fully present.

Therefore, I commanded Laozi to incarnate in the human realm, to save and deliver all beings, and to expound the precepts and regulations. Whether among the Yi or the Xia, whether sage or commoner, throughout the ten directions, all are enabled to attain liberation. The wondrous Dharma of the Three Caverns is scattered among humankind, exhorting men and women to diligently cultivate and practice.

Ordinary beings accumulate sins, their karmic burdens sinking them into delusion. They have no affinity with the Dao and cannot believe or revere it. They follow only false teachings and various heterodox spirits, exhausting body and mind in vain, only to descend into hell in the end. Those who believe and practice the Three Caverns all enter the Hall of Blessings. Some ascend in broad daylight, some escape through corpse liberation, concealing their forms in grotto palaces, roaming the world. They attain long life, change their names, and endure for eternal kalpas. Refining qi and transforming form, they turn spirit into the Dao. None can recognize them, for they are boundless.

After my passing, demonic teachings will flourish. The world will uniformly follow them, and people will die young. Warfare, floods, fires, illnesses, and injuries will cause death and harm. Nations will fall, families will perish, and these calamities will follow one after another day and night. Their treasuries will be exhausted in service to demons and heresies. Falsehood and chaos will daily increase, and frivolous deceit will spread through the times. Hunger, cold, and suffering will afflict them, and fathers and sons will be scattered and displaced. The world will be foolish and deluded, forever without awakening.

I pity you, who have sunk for kalpas on end. I speak these essential words to enlighten the deaf and blind. Yet the wondrous Dharma of the Three Caverns is of one kind, which is twofold: first, the true Dharma; second, the transformative Dharma. The true Dharma is free from all falsity and endures for eternal kalpas. The transformative Dharma circulates through texts and perishes with the times.

Within the transformative Dharma, there are five kinds:
1. The coalescing of soaring mystery’s qi, cloud-seal scripts forming chapters, naturally combining and separating, appearing and disappearing unpredictably. In the Three Pure Realms above, it eternally abides as the scriptural treasure, enduring for billions of kalpas, protected by sages and perfected beings.
2. The numinous script of one zhang and eight corners, resplendent throughout the Three Realms, the ten directions, and the five billion heavens, rising and falling with the kalpas, circulating in response to karmic conditions.
3. The writing and recitation of texts in the halls, pavilions, terraces, chambers, gates, and doors of the heavens’ palaces, subduing beings and guiding their entry into and exit from cultivation.
4. Flower-patterned and leaf-shaped characters, jade tablets and rosy compilations, the square zhang of Penglai, the Langfeng and Xuanpu gardens, now hidden, now revealed, enduring or perishing with the kalpas, teaching and training immortals, subduing demonic spirits.
5. Paper and silk, bamboo and wood, lacquered writings, scattered among humankind, transmitted and recited. At the kalpa’s beginning, they descend; at its end, they ascend. They protect nations and pacify people, opening the path for all ranks of beings.

The scriptures are the words of the Primordial Beginning, teaching and transforming all beings, enabling them to recognize the root and origin, the causes and conditions of past lives, the retribution of sins and blessings, the auspicious and inauspicious, good and evil, the gateways of birth and transformation, and the origins of expedient means. They turn from evil to embrace goodness, preserve and secure their lives, attain long life and non-action, return to the Dao, and become eternal models. Those who preserve them receive blessings. Those who cultivate them become immortals.

From the *Sutra of Karmic Retribution and Causes and Conditions*.

The Most High Dao Lord said to the Three Heavens Dharma Master: "The teachings and precepts of the Heavenly Worthy, the wondrous texts of the Three Caverns, the celestial writings in jade characters, the numinous seal-scripts and dragon scripts—though boundless—are all summarized and categorized into twelve matters. Their divisions and distinctions vary according to the roots of beings:
1. Natural original texts
2. Divine talismans
3. Precious oral instructions
4. Numinous diagrams
5. Registers and genealogies
6. Precepts and regulations
7. **Dignified observances**
8. Methods and techniques
9. Arts and calculations
10. Records and biographies
11. Hymns and recitations
12. Memorials and petitions

The natural original texts are the celestial writings of the Eight Assemblies, the phoenix seal-scripts and dragon scripts. They are the root of heaven, earth, and the myriad things, enlightening humans and spirits, establishing all Dharmas. They summon the divine immortals and emperors of the Nine Heavens, verify and determine registers and charts, regulate the celestial pivot, subdue the Fengdu underworld, vanquish demonic spirits, command the water deities, summon dragons to ascend the clouds, mark the kalpic cycles of heaven and earth, record the names of sages and perfected beings, govern the cities and terraces they oversee, and delineate the realms of the multitude of perfected beings. They broadly proclaim distinctions, various ranks of descent, methods for ingesting primordial essence, and techniques for transforming form.

Divine talismans are the cloud-seal scripts, the pledges of divine perfected beings. They summon and subdue demonic hordes, awe and control spirits and ghosts, govern the primordial and command fate, and protect life through the years.

Precious oral instructions are the explanations of the celestial writings of the Eight Assemblies by the heavenly perfected and supreme sages, establishing the correct sounds and revealing the Great Dao."

The *Lingtu* (Numinous Charts) are the transformative traces of the multitude of sages, manifesting without fixed form. They depict and convey adaptability, enabling comprehensive understanding and realization.

The *Pulu* (Registers and Genealogies) are the recorded accounts of the multitude of sages, listing the names and titles of immortals and perfected beings, their ancestral origins and lineages, and the hierarchical positions of divine palaces.

The *Jielü* (Precepts and Disciplines) are the systematic regulations and binding agreements that prevent transgressions and examine faults, weighing the gravity of offenses and blessings to distinguish their severity.

The *Weiyi* (Dignified Rituals) fully demonstrate the forms of purification and abstinence, serving as models for advancement and retreat, the measured rhythms of bowing and rising, and the standards for demeanor and bearing.

The *Fangfa* (Methods) are the writings of the multitude of sages, containing the essential secrets of elixirs and medicines, divine herbs and numinous fungi, malleable gold, flowing water, and jade—the Dao of self-cultivation.

The *Shushu* (Arts and Calculations) clarify and discern the spirit through contemplation, preserving authenticity and focusing the mind on the Dao. They encompass fasting of the heart and sitting in forgetfulness, wandering through emptiness and flying steps, ingesting the six *qi*, guiding the Three Luminaries, refining the body to transform form, and the methods of immortal transcendence.

The *Jizhuan* (Records and Biographies) are the accounts of the multitude of sages, documenting their studies and practices, the attainment of the Dao and perfection of the real, the entry into mystery and subtlety, the places of cultivation, and the times of fruition.

The *Zanyong* (Hymns and Chants) are the adorned dharma-words of the multitude of perfected beings and great sages, extolling the true Dao, inspiring universal faith and joy, arousing dedication and redirection, and cultivating reverence and veneration.

The *Zhangbiao* (Memorials and Petitions) are the wondrous treasures and extraordinary texts transmitted between master and disciple, used in altar rites, oaths of transmission, confessions and repentances, prayers for blessings, and official declarations.

These twelve categories comprehensively encompass all methods. Every intention and purpose is fully provided without omission. They transform and guide the Three Vehicles to enter the One Vehicle Dao, as stated in the *Sutra of Fundamental Boundaries*.

From the Three Antiquities onward, down to the Great Tang,
The sacred scrolls and numinous texts, now hidden, now revealed,
Appeared in historical records or were separately recorded.
By the Song dynasty, Master Jianji,
In the course of collation, compiled the *Catalogue of Pearl-Bag Scriptures*,
Totaling eighteen thousand scrolls.
Thereafter, war raged in the Jiang region, and armed conflict in Qin,
Many authentic scriptures and secret texts were scattered and lost.
Emperor Wu of the Later Zhou established the Abbey of Penetrating Mystery,
Collecting the various scriptures, still numbering ten thousand scrolls.
When the Sui dynasty’s flames raged and the Tang arose,
Evil vapors were swept away, and the realm was pacified.
By the Kaiyuan era, scriptures and instructions flourished.
Emperor Xuanzong compiled the *Jade Network Catalogue*,
Comprising seven thousand three hundred scrolls.
Additionally, there were separate catalogues of sacred names,
Records, commentaries, and treatises, totaling over nine thousand scrolls.
Soon after, the Two Hu barbarians disrupted the orthodox teachings of Xia.
The two capitals fell into decline, and many secret repositories were burned.
In the Shangyuan era, over six thousand scrolls of scriptures and registers were collected.
By the Dali era, Master Shenfu of the realm,
Through nationwide searches and transcription in the capital,
Amassed another seven thousand scrolls.
After the Changqing era, between the Xiantong years,
The two streets transcribed only five thousand three hundred scrolls.
Recently, as great bandits invaded and the imperial carriage fled south,
The two capitals were reduced to smoke and ashes, the six directions overgrown with brambles,
Temples and abbeys lay in ruins everywhere.
Of the jade tablets and numinous cases, barely a third remained.
I, caught in these dire times, drifted to Chengdu,
Accompanying the imperial return, lingering briefly,
Undertook another search, enduring hardships.
New and old scriptures and edicts numbered only three thousand scrolls,
Yet remained uncompiled.
Moreover, the scriptures obtained during the imperial inspection were soon lost.
I journeyed again through the Three Shu regions, intending further searches,
But was repeatedly hindered by the blades of war, my earlier resolve unfulfilled.

On the third day of the eighth month, gengchen, in the second year of Dashun (Xinhai),
At the Jade Bureau of Transformation in Chengdu, I briefly record this account of the provincial examination of precepts and teachings.
Recorded by Du Guangting.

*Concluded: Scroll Twenty-One of the* Ritual of Establishing the Great Fast of the Supreme Yellow Register
*Begins: Scroll Twenty-Two of the* Ritual of Establishing the Great Fast of the Supreme Yellow Register

Transmitted by Master Liu Chongjing of the Three Caverns, the Serene One
Compiled by Jiang Shuyu, the Celestial Enforcer of the Supreme Dao, Immortal Officer of the Registers

*Section on Rituals*
*First – Rite of Submitting Memorials to the Emperor*

First, the hymn of praise to the Hua-Xia is recited, and the High Priest is led to stand before the Patriarch’s Dao and before the Divine Marshal of Memorials. After offering incense and performing the purification by sprinkling, the Dharma Master makes the invocation, inviting the Perfected to receive the libation.

Next, the *House-Entering Mantra* is recited:
*"The Four Luminaries, Attendants of Merit,
Messengers of the Realized, transmit this truth:
May the primordial qi of the Upper Prime enter my body,
That the memorial I present be conveyed and heard on high."*

The *Hua-Xia* rite follows, with the incense rotated once around. Then, incense is offered at the imperial desk.

Each pays reverence to the masters, visualizing as prescribed.

With the memorial placed upon the tablet, held in both hands at the heart, the officiant stands upright, bows slightly, and visualizes their root master, standing to the west.

Three silent bows are made, then:
—Visualizing the Lords and Elders of the East, three silent bows.
—Visualizing the Heavenly Worthy of Dao and Virtue in the South, three silent bows.
—Visualizing the Three Masters of the West, three silent bows.
—Visualizing the Most High Lord Lao in the North, three silent bows.
—Visualizing the sun to the left and the moon to the right, each nine inches from the face, with the Seven Stars above the head.

Green qi emanates from the liver, filling the chamber, its pure radiance surpassing sun and moon.

Next, visualize:
—General Tang emerging from the left kidney, standing to the left.
—General Ge emerging from the right kidney, standing to the right.
—General Zhou emerging from the heart, standing in front.
Each commands thirty million soldiers, all clad in crimson, resplendent.

Then visualize the Five Virtue Generals—the five spirits—arrayed in the four directions.

Next, visualize:
—The celestial couriers and armored guards emerging from the navel.
—The Heavenly Ding warriors emerging from the forehead.
—The wolf officers and tiger guards emerging from between the brows.
—The riders of the fierce winds and placers of documents emerging from the knees.
—The qi-gathering and qi-consuming officers emerging from the nose.

Then visualize the jade youths and maidens who transmit memorials, standing to the left and right. The Directing Attendant of Merit, clad in crimson with a black headband, stands before them.

Only then proceed with the ritual.

The Dao of immortals manifests in the flicker of an instant; delay not in visualization. Let the mind be ever alert, for with each thought, clarity arises.

Next, the *Mantra of Guarding the Spirits* is recited, followed by twenty-four strikes of the Dharma drum.

Invoking the Brazier

The Supreme Mysterious Origin Five Numinous Venerable Lords, summon now the Attendants of Merit, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, the Incense-Bearing Attendants, and the Three Qi Rectifying Spirits. Hasten to report above to the Three Heavens’ Mysterious Origin Supreme Dao Lord.

Your servant now kindles this incense, reverently offering it on behalf of the master of the retreat, so-and-so, to directly present the deceased kin, so-and-so, and universally present all the assembled souls. On such-and-such a day, an unsurpassed Yellow Register Grand Retreat was established to provide aid for their transcendence.

In strict accordance with the ritual protocols, petitions to the Celestial Offices were previously submitted—so many scrolls of such-and-such a petition—ascending to such-and-such a palace bureau for processing at such-and-such a palace.

May the upright and true life-qi of the eight directions descend into your servant’s body, that what your servant petitions may swiftly ascend and directly reach the presence of the Jade August Thearch, the Supreme Honored One of the Limitless Dao.

Each proclaims their dharma rank:

With due reverence, your servant so-and-so, holding the dharma rank, humbly petitions the Vacuous and Spontaneous Primordial Heavenly Venerable One, the Limitless Dao Supreme Lord of the Dao, the Supreme Venerable Lord, the August Jade Thearch on High, the hosts of great sages who have attained the Dao in the ten directions, the Heavenly Venerables and Perfected Ones, the Great Thearchs and Celestial Thearchs, the Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Center, the Great Dharma Masters of the Three Heavens, the Perfected Lord of Orthodox Unity and Serene Response, the Perfected Woman Master of Orthodox Unity, the Perfected Heirs and Lineage Masters of Orthodox Unity, the Three Yuan Perfected Lords Tang, Ge, and Zhou, the divine administrators of the various bureaus under the Three Heavens, the transcendent officials who transmit petitions to the celestial bureaus, the numinous officials and registrars of such-and-such a petition in the Celestial Offices, the transcendent generals and officers governing the registers of the dharma, the spirit honored in such-and-such a year, and all the responsive and mighty numina within and beyond the Three Realms.

Your servant, born of flesh and blood, a humble being of dust and clay, by fortunate karmic conditions has presumptuously ascended the ranks of the dharma. Bearing talismans and registers, I follow and practice the teachings and methods.

May all universally enter the gate of the dharma.

Should any seek refuge and submission, it is fitting to report and inform. Now your disciple, [Name], moved by the bonds of righteousness and desiring to repay kindness, is earnest in cultivation and reverence. Wishing to establish the merit of a fast, broadly bestowing hidden blessings, I humbly request to follow the ritual statutes and present a memorial in worship. May the universal bestowal of wisdom’s power open the dark paths to prosperity. Your servant, unworthily filling the office of Libationer, bears the duty of proclamation and transcription. With reverence, I petition the Three Heavens and offer sincerity to the host of sages. Looking upward, I hope for resonance and response; bowing downward, I pray for inspection and regard. May celestial grace descend, and the memorial ascend. Let the prayers be fulfilled, and both the hidden and manifest realms receive favor. May the winds of Orthodox Unity forever flourish, and the transformative power of great compassion universally extend.

Your servant, with utmost sincerity and awe, prostrates and bows twice. Respectfully, I make this known.

Next, proceeding to the thrones of the Three Pure Ones, I offer incense to summon the sages and pour libations in ritual observance. Before the thrones of the Three Pure Ones, one censer of incense is offered at each. Before the Supreme Clarity, a censer of blazing, abundant incense must be maintained without interruption in its smoke—this is the decree of ascending tranquility.

Next, I knock my teeth twenty-four times. Kneeling lengthily, I invoke the officials; all officials likewise kneel lengthily.

Respectfully, I summon the Five Body Perfected Officials and the Merit Archivists from within my own body. The Direct Envoys of the Upper Transcendents and Upper Numinous Ones, two Orthodox Unity Merit Archivists, two Healing Merit Archivists, two Left and Right Official Envoys, two Yin-Yang Divine Decision Clerks, two Red Talisman Chariot Clerks, and two Post Horse Memorial Clerks emerge. Those who emerge don proper attire, caps, and pendent tassels, arraying their majestic dignity. The Direct Envoy Merit Archivists wear the Cap of Penetrating Heaven, holding black single-layered robes. The Orthodox Unity Merit Archivists wear the Scarlet Yang Turban, crimson single-layered robes, and gird themselves with dragon-headed swords, bearing memorial tablets. The Envoys wear the Dark Yin Turban, the Nine Virtues Cap, multicolored corded single-layered robes, tiger-symbol girdles, and carry jade tablets.

The Direct Envoy Merit Archivists stand at the four directions; the Orthodox Unity Merit Archivists stand at the center; the Healing Merit Archivists guard and protect your servant’s body. The Left Official Envoys erect standards at the front; the Right Official Envoys hold banners at the rear. The Yang Divine Decision Clerks stand to the left; the Yin Divine Decision Clerks stand to the right. The Wolf Clerks, Tiger Warriors, Inspectors of Treachery, Hook Cavalry, Three Officials’ Archers, Celestial Couriers, Celestial Soldiers, Celestial Might Generals, Rectifying and Upholding Clerks, Qi-Gathering and Qi-Consuming Clerks, Spirit-Gathering and Spirit-Consuming Clerks, Ghost-Gathering and Ghost-Consuming Clerks, Toxin-Gathering and Toxin-Consuming Clerks, Evil-Gathering and Evil-Consuming Clerks, Essence-Gathering and Essence-Consuming Clerks, Fever-Gathering and Fever-Consuming Clerks, Talisman-Subduing and Shrine-Destroying Clerks, Gale-Riding Clerks, and Flying Dragon-Riding Clerks—two of each—emerge, all arrayed and standing before, behind, to the left, and right of your servant. They all receive the words from your servant’s mouth, distinguishing the memorial to be presented to the Celestial Officials of such-and-such a petition, and report to the Perfected Officials within the district, the Qi-Recording Overseers, the Examiners and Summoners of the District Lords, the Left and Right Capital Lords, the Lords and Clerks of the Four Directions, the Two Mysteries and Three Primordials of the Dao spread below by the Celestial Master, the August Thearch of the Twelve Hours of the Four Beginnings of the Twelve Earthly Branches of the Royal Heaven, the Lords of Jiazi, the Benevolent Lords of Bingzi, the Red Yang Lords of the Five Sevens, the Lords of the Twenty-Five Offices, and all Examiners and Summoners of the various Lords and Clerks.

The twenty-four male and female officials of such-and-such a register received by your servant, the twenty-four male and female qi, the twenty-four male and female offices, the twenty-four yin and yang qi of the left and right within the register, the Great Generals of Erecting Standards and Supervising Merit, the true qi of the high and low within the register, the Front Division’s Merit Effecters, the Rear Division’s Executioners, the Post Station Commandants and Vice-Commandants, the Four Divisions’ Memorial-Overseeing Attendants, Memorial-Reviewing Attendants, Memorial-Presenting Attendants, Memorial-Recording Attendants, Memorial-Transmitting Attendants, Memorial-Guarding Attendants, Memorial-Fixing Attendants, Memorial-Collating Attendants, Memorial-Carrying Attendants, and the Five Hundred Seal-Bearing Attendants; the Eastern Nine Yi, Southern Eight Man, Western Six Rong, Northern Five Di, Central Three Qin; the over thirty-six thousand gods of the Mysterious Origin Beginning; the mountains, rivers, streams, valleys, and the Lords and Clerks of the Altars of Soil and Grain—all join in sincerity to report above to the Supreme Clarity, Mysterious Origin, Peerless Three Heavens, Boundless Great Dao, the Most High Lord Lao, the Heavenly Thearch Lord of the Celestial Venerable, the Nine Elder Transcendents of the Celestial Venerable, the Nine Qi Venerable, the myriad layers of Dao qi, the twelve hundred Lords of the Offices, before the Seven Treasures Jade Steps of the Golden Portal of Supreme Clarity, the Celestial Master, Female Master, Heir Master, and Lineage Master Ladies, under the Dao’s gate, the Upper Officials and Scribes, the minor assisting clerks, who carry out the affairs of documents.

Your servant, of fleshly substance, is dull and ignorant in all matters, yet bears the duty of proclamation and transcription. I universally proclaim the Master’s commands to succor and relieve the people and all beings.

At this moment, with reverence, so-and-so respectfully submits such-and-such a memorial, which now rests upon your servant’s plain desk, enclosed within its case. Your servant prostrates himself and recites the memorial according to ritual. The Attendant Officers and Messengers, having jointly prepared the proceedings, are specially granted direct audience. With care, the jade case is opened, and the memorial’s text is read in prostration.

Next, incense is held in the hand-warmer, and the memorial case is unsealed with the dragon-headed writing knife. Three rounds of tooth-clicking are performed, and the invocation is spoken:

*"Attendants of the Four Clarities, Opening-Case Clerks—*
*With writing knife in hand, unseal the case’s track.*
*The memorial ascends in petition, opening the Dao’s path.*
*The deceased rise to heaven, the living receive protection.*
*Swiftly, swiftly, as in the statutes and decrees!"*

Then the memorial is drawn from the case and passed over the incense. Three more rounds of tooth-clicking are performed, and the invocation is spoken:

*"Smoke of five colors, bearing the memorial to heaven.*
*Qi of five hues, conveying the memorial to the Thearch.*
*Let no wayward qi of subordinate officials dare interfere.*
*Swiftly, swiftly, as in the statutes and decrees!"*

Next, the Dharma Master hands the memorial to the Scripture Attendant, who kneels to receive it. Together with the incense attendants, they present the golden fish to the right and the jade wild goose to the left.

The Dharma Master who recites the memorial then faces the Heavenly Gate and bows twice. Advancing on his knees to the petitioning official’s station, he bows twice more, maintaining the prescribed posture. Upon completing the recitation, the memorial is placed upon the desk, with the writing knife set to the left and the brush to the right. The Dharma Master bows twice more and returns to his position, comforting the memorial as ritual dictates.

Next, the Dharma Master places the memorial upon the incense burner of the imperial desk to be fumigated. Two rounds of tooth-clicking are performed to dispatch the memorial.

With reverence, your servant dispatches the True Officials of the Five Viscera within his body, each accompanied by a minor clerk, twelve scribal assistants, all properly capped and sashed with hanging cords, grinding ink and dipping brushes. At this time, your servant, acting with diligence, respectfully submits such-and-such a memorial to the Celestial Officials, presenting it to the Bureau of such-and-such a Celestial Palace for adjudication.

Your servant, foolish and unworthy, has presumptuously taken part in the administration of registers. His ears and eyes are blocked, his inspections and verifications unclear. The memorial now submitted may contain errors: ranks out of order, characters poorly formed, omissions or transpositions, phrases disjointed, front mistaken for back, left for right. May the officials of yin and yang, the divine clerks, the messengers, the scribal assistants, and the minor functionaries follow the memorial in its presentation, wielding the dragon-headed writing knife to seek out and amend the text, using long, sharp brushes to certify and correct according to ritual. Let no supervising official reject it, but allow the qi to close and the memorial to ascend directly to the presence of the Most High Lord Lao, to the Left Clerk before his throne and the Right Clerk at the passes, passing through each office in sequence. Let each gate be opened in turn, each office notified in order. May those your servant has petitioned descend, those he has summoned arrive, those he has sought to deliver be delivered, and those he has memorialized reach their destination.

Should any subordinate official’s wayward qi intercept your servant’s memorial and prevent its ascent, let them be recorded and delivered to the nearest prison, punished according to the statutes, to uphold the celestial decrees.

Your servant prostrates himself to the left of the desk, awaiting the sacred response with reverence.

The memorial is sealed in its case. The Scripture Attendant bears the memorial, accompanied by the Fast Supervisor. With solemn dignity and refined praise, they are led to the burning site. The Scripture Attendant reads the memorial and recites the pass-opening litany. The memorial is burned with the appropriate hymn. The Dharma Master prostrates himself and presents it according to ritual, awaiting the response.

The hymn of ascent is raised, and the officials are received in prostration.

The submission of the memorial now complete, the Attendant Officers and Messengers, all the numinous officials and clerks who emerged from your servant’s Gate of Myriad Wonders, return to their places—those on the left to the left, those on the right to the right. The Directing Attendant Officer oversees and verifies, returning to the palace chambers without error. Should they be summoned again, let it proceed as before.

Three rounds of tooth-clicking are performed, and saliva is swallowed three times. The incense burner is restored.

The Incense Officials and Messengers, the Lords of the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger, and all the numinous officials attending the incense—may they cause golden liquid, cinnabar, and azure mushroom blossoms to arise naturally at the place where your servant presents the memorial. May the hundred spirits and host of perfected ones converge here before the incense burner. May your disciple, so-and-so, and his entire household receive blessings, with both the hidden and manifest realms receiving grace.

May the jade maidens and immortal youths of the ten directions, who attend the incense smoke, transmit your servant’s words and the memorial just presented directly to the august presence of the Most High Jade Sovereign of the Limitless Dao.

The Hymn of Departure from the Hall is raised. Before the Heavenly Master, the ritual of thanksgiving is performed. The Cloud Chariot escorts the Master away. The recitation of merits concludes. The rite of offering is conducted to request blessings.

This ceremony is not recorded in ancient rituals. Master Tang established it, and it is now followed as available. If the Master is a scholar of antiquity, he should adhere to the old methods of the Jin and Tang dynasties.

First, purify and arrange all offerings—incense, lamps, tea, wine, fruits, and the implements for the offering—each prepared according to proper ritual. Next, the water is consecrated to cleanse impurities, and the grand liturgy ascends the altar.

The *Entering the Chamber Spell* is recited. Circling the offering mat, the incense is carried once around, while the Daoist assembly stands in ranks according to sequence. Each bows to the Master, maintaining proper mindfulness.

The *Guardian Spirit Spell* is recited.

The twenty-four strikes of the Dharma drum resound. The Most High Three Heavens’ Primordial Origin and First Three Qi, the Supreme Lord Lao, summon forth from within us the thirty-six each of the Three and Five Merit Officials, the Left and Right Attending Envoys, the Left and Right Incense-Bearers, the Courier Dragon Riders, the Golden Lads Attending Incense, the Jade Maidens Transmitting Words and Scattering Flowers, and the Five Thearchs’ Direct Talismans and Daily Incense Officials. Let those summoned array themselves in solemn attire and open the gates of this local earth deity and the true officials and divine spirits of this domain. We now reverently burn incense to petition on behalf of [Name] for the establishment of the Supreme Yellow Register Grand Retreat. The rites of the Dao now concluded, we respectfully set forth a pure offering altar, one seat of several ranks. We humbly beseech the vast grace of the Most High, that the life-qi of the Ten Directions’ True and Upright Ones may descend and flow into our bodies, so that our petition may swiftly ascend to the presence of the Most High, Boundless, and Utmost Dao, the Perfect and Jade August Thearch.

Next, kneeling in prostration, we summon the officials, strike the teeth, and swallow the saliva according to ritual. Together, we summon forth from within our bodies the true officials and merit officials of our five viscera, the twelve each of the officials who ascend to the Three Heavens, enforce the Dharma and transform beings, the yin and yang merit officials, and those who deliver from the Dao, dispel calamities, scatter misfortune, and resolve adversities. From within us, the governing officials of our bodies: the Great General Who Establishes the Standard and Oversees Merit in our office, the Vanguard Who Effects Merit, the Rear Guard Who Effects Severity, the Courier Court Director, the Courier Court Deputy, the Inspectors of the Four Quarters’ Merit, the Petitioners, the Transcendent and Numinous, the Direct Merit Officials, the Left and Right Attending Envoys, the Yin and Yang Spirit-Deciding Officials, the Scarlet Talisman Chariot Officials, the Gale Courier Officials, the Courier Horse Memorial Officials, the Flying Dragon Riders, and two each of all other officials, emerge. Let those summoned array themselves in solemn attire, displaying their regalia, with caps and pendants hanging in proper order, their dignity and bearing impeccable.

The Merit Officials wear crimson yang headbands, the Heaven-Pervading Crown, black silk unlined robes, and gird themselves with dragon-headed swords, bearing the petition registers. The Envoys wear dark yin headbands, the Nine Virtues Crown, vermilion unlined robes, and gird themselves with tiger tallies, carrying jade tablets. The Direct Merit Officials stand at the four directions; the Orthodox Unity Merit Official stands at the center; the Healing Merit Official guards our bodies. The Left Attending Envoys establish the standard at the front; the Right Attending Envoys hold the banners at the rear. The Yang Spirit-Deciding Official stands to the left; the Yin Spirit-Deciding Official stands to the right. The Upper Merit Official stands above; the Middle Merit Official stands within our bodies. The Urging Qi Merit Official hastens the Ten Directions. The Upper Envoys gaze afar toward the heavens; the Middle Envoys survey the eight directions. The Capital Envoys encircle our bodies. The Wolf Officials and Tiger Warriors, the Inspectors of Treachery and Hook Riders, the Capital Officials and Archers, the Heavenly Couriers and Armored Soldiers, the Heavenly Might Warriors, the Rectifying and Upholding Officials, the Spirit-Seizing and Spirit-Feeding Officials, the Ghost-Seizing and Ghost-Feeding Officials, the Qi-Seizing and Qi-Feeding Officials, the Toxin-Seizing and Toxin-Feeding Officials, the Essence-Seizing and Essence-Feeding Officials, the Evil-Seizing and Evil-Feeding Officials, the Talisman-Destroying and Shrine-Demolishing Officials, the Gale Courier Officials, the Courier Horse Memorial Officials, the Flying Dragon Riders, and all others, station themselves to our left and right, before and behind, to receive our words and transmit them accordingly.

This local earth deity, the true officials and inspectors, the Left and Right Capital Lords of Rectification, the Twenty-Eight Treatments established by the Heavenly Master, the Thirty-Six Retreat Huts, the Seventy-Two Blessed Lands, the Three Hundred Sixty Named Mountains, the Kunlun and other Upper Palaces and Grotto-Heavens of the Seas and Peaks, the Three Origins and Four Beginnings, the Twenty-Four Qi, the Twelve Bureau Deities, the Year Star and Great Yin, the Officers of the Jiazi, the Three Myriad Six Thousand Spirits of the Primordial Origin and First Qi, those currently serving in the memorials, the Eastern Yi, Southern Man, Western Rong, Northern Di, and Central Three Qin, the Five Elder Spirit Lords, the deities of mountains, streams, and valleys, and the numinous officials and generals—all join in sincerity to reverently petition the Most High, Boundless, and Utmost Dao, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy; the Most High Lord of the Great Dao; the Supreme Lord Lao; the Most High Elder, the Supreme and Mysterious Lord; the Ten Directions’ Boundless Great Dao and the Host of Sages and Heavenly Worthies of Virtue; the Perfect and Great Thearchs and Heavenly Thearchs; the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures; the Heavenly Master, Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center; the Host of Numinous Treasures and the Mighty Spirits of the Three Realms.

By our karmic destiny and affinity, we have presumptuously transmitted the teachings and Dharma. On the day of our covenant, we pledged to uphold and practice them. We vowed to propagate the true wind and broadly transform all beings. Now, for our disciple [Name], we reverently follow the ritual codes and uphold the precious retreat. Having dispersed the jade altar, we now present this pure offering. We look up to repay the vast creation and express our sincere devotion. We prostrate ourselves and earnestly beseech the Merit Officials, Envoys, and Flying Dragon Riders to transmit our memorial swiftly on our behalf. May the Three Clarities’ Great Thearchs and the Ten Poles’ Lofty Perfected Ones universally bestow their vast compassion, casting their radiance and descending their gaze. May they pour grace upon the earth below and bestow blessings upon the depths of the springs. May fortune extend to the living and the dead, and blessings be shared by families and states. With utmost reverence and awe, we bow our heads to the ground, our urgency and sincerity unbounded. We respectfully submit this memorial for your hearing. Each declares their Dharma rank.

Having declared their Dharma ranks, they undertake the grand jiao ritual of merit in accordance with the Yellow Register’s teachings.

Your servant [Name], together with the assembled altar officials, humbly and with one heart petitions the Vacuous and Spontaneous Primordial Heavenly Worthy of Original Commencement, the Boundless Dao’s Most High Great Dao Lord, the Most High Lord Lao, the August Jade Thearch, the ten directions’ great holy multitudes who have attained the Dao, the perfected lords and venerable masters, the thirty-two Heavenly Thearchs, the Jade Clarity Highest Deity, the Great Thearch of the Jade Capital, the Eastern Florescence, Southern Culmen, Western Numinous, Northern Perfected, and the Seven-Treasure Jeweled Terrace of the Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace’s Numinous Treasure Perfected Radiant August Dao Lord; the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterium, the Heavenly Master Lord; the supreme ministers and prime ministers; the Four Offices and Five Thearchs; and all the perfected numina of the Three Realms’ officialdom.

Your servant reverently conducts the supreme Yellow Register grand fast on behalf of disciple [Name]. With the merit complete and the rites concluded, we respectfully choose an auspicious evening. Having prepared the jiao offering with utmost devotion, we invite the descent of the sacred perfected of the various heavens, the Numinous Treasure’s officialdom, the Three Realms’ administrative offices, and all governing numina. May they deign to descend in their chariots and inspect our sincere devotion.

We, unable to contain our longing as we gaze toward heaven and yearn for the sacred, prostrate ourselves in utmost urgency and reverence, bowing our heads twice to present our petition.

Next, the descent of the sacred is invoked.
Incense is offered.
Tea is presented.
Wine is offered.

The ritual procession circles the jiao altar once, bearing incense, and stands before the grotto shrine.
The long chant ritual is performed.
Each declares their Dharma rank.

Your servant [Name], together with disciple [Name] and the assembled altar officials, once more humbly and with one heart petitions the Three Clarities’ august sages, the Ten Poles’ lofty perfected, the numinous immortals of heaven and earth, the sun, moon, and stellar lodges, the Four Offices and Five Thearchs, the true officials of the mountains and rivers, the Numinous Treasure’s immortal courts, the Three Realms’ officialdom, and all perfected numina descending in response to the jiao altar.

We have long been blessed with residual fortune, having encountered the true wind. We have presumptuously borne the numinous scriptures and received the profound teachings. Our merit is as light as dust and dew, while our transgressions weigh like mountains and hills. Rightly should we restrain ourselves and exercise self-discipline. Yet the Dharma permits salvation and assisting the state in establishing merit. For all who take refuge, it is impossible in principle to refuse or reject. Bound by the words of the ritual, how dare we not make this known above?

The proclamation is recited.
In accordance with the ritual’s words, we have exerted utmost sincerity.

The fast’s sponsor, [Name], reverently upholds the true Dao and bears the Dharma’s token. Following the ritual codes, we have respectfully established the imperial altar. Conducting the supreme fast, we exhaust the sincerity of serving heaven. Bowing our heads to the Ten Poles, we turn in reverence to the Three Luminaries. We repent our accumulated sins before the divine scriptures and apologize for past transgressions before the mountains and rivers. Adorning each direction with radiant colors, we ensure utmost purity and solemnity. The incense and lamps are arrayed without lapse or interruption. Blue petitions and vermilion memorials ascend to the Mysterious Capital. Jade talismans and golden writs descend to the nether realms. Assured of the fast’s merit coming to fruition, we pray for the fulfillment of virtuous vows. May the hidden and manifest alike prosper, and the living and dead alike receive blessings.

Now that the ritual affairs are complete and the immortal’s model has concluded, the true chariots return to the upper mysteries, and the Dharma’s flow disperses to the lower realms. The scriptures are gathered into their precious scrolls, and the Dao returns to the Jade Capital. The Sanskrit qi’s tablets are removed, and the jade lotus’s tassels are inverted. We reverently consider the Three Realms and all perfected numina, the scriptures’ mighty spirits, and the altar’s guardian officers. From the initial invocation to the altar’s dispersal, following the canonical rites, we have performed the ninefold morning petitions. We have overseen and protected, ensuring unimpeded comings and goings. The laboring officials and hastening officers have fulfilled their duties. Respectfully presenting the jiao rites, we reverently give thanks for the numinous grace.

We humbly pray that you may briefly halt your cloud chariots and linger in your precious conveyances. Partake of this purity, and witness this sincerity. Bestow abundant fortune upon this household and descend auspicious blessings upon its members. May the netherworld flourish, and may the living and dead alike receive your grace.

We, unable to contain our utmost reverence and urgency, bow our heads twice, offer incense, and present the second libation of wine.

Next, the ritual procession circles the jiao altar once, bearing incense, and stands in order before the grotto shrine.
The long chant ritual is performed.

Your servant [Name], together with disciple [Name] and others, once more humbly and with one heart petitions the Most High Three Worthies, the ten directions’ sacred multitudes, the Three Realms’ officialdom, and all perfected numina.

We have heard that the great Dao is non-action, and its divine power is unfathomable. It engenders and completes heaven and earth, nurturing the myriad numina. It benevolently aids the hidden and manifest, bestowing benefit upon all beings. For all who present their prayers, resonance is surely attained.

Now disciple [Name], having planted good causes in past lives, has taken refuge in the true teaching. Deeply indebted to its boundless grace, we have striven to repay it without lapse. The precious fast has concluded on this auspicious night, and the pure jiao is again presented on this propitious evening. We answer the virtue of heaven and earth’s engendering and completing, and give thanks for the true numina’s protection and guardianship. We wash away the transgressions of accumulated lifetimes and dissolve the karmic knots of a hundred existences. May the departed ascend, and may our kin be safeguarded.

We humbly beseech the august sages to bestow their compassion and the perfected to grant their protection. May the Three Officials record our goodness, and the Five Thearchs inscribe our names. May merit and virtue be fully perfected, and good affinities come to fruition. May fortune flow without limit, and benefit extend to all sentient beings.

First, we pray for our ancestral line and former sages, the state’s august numina, that they may long preserve their great enterprise and ensure the prosperity of their descendants. May the emperor’s heavenly foundation endure forever, and his sagely lifespan know no bounds. May the four barbarians all submit, and the five weapons be laid to rest. May yin and yang harmonize in sequence, and wind and rain arrive in due season. May the year bring abundant harvests, and all things be free from blight and pestilence.

Next, we pray for disciple [Name] and their ancestors of a hundred thousand generations, the suffering souls and hidden spirits, that all may partake of the wondrous goodness’s merit and together attain the path of transcendence. May the dead souls undergo refinement, forever casting off the bonds of defilement; may their true nature endure, suddenly awakening to the fruit of non-action.

Next, we pray for ourselves and our families, our entire clan and kin. May our bodies harmonize with primordial harmony, and our spirits merge with the wondrous Dao. Like gold refined and jade polished, may our fortune and prosperity increase in grandeur; like mirrors bright and dust cleared, may our lifespans extend into the distant future. May disasters dissipate like mist, and goodness arrive like clouds. Whether moving or still, flying or submerged, within the realm or beyond, may all partake of vast fortune and together bathe in the profound grace.

Finally, we pray for the spirits of this place, the local earth deities, that they too may partake of the fast’s power and ascend the immortal ranks. May they guard the home and pacify the household, bringing peace to people and protection to all things. May those in the three paths and five sufferings, the six destinies and four births, those who died in battle or perished in war, the sunken souls and lingering spirits—may all receive the Dao’s power, universally attain special merit, swiftly depart the dark passes, and soon transcend to the true realms.

May we humbly look up to the true responses, that they may fully accord with our prayers. With heads bowed in reverence, we present the final libation. The rites of the jiao altar are now complete, respectfully proclaimed in full.

Next, we offer the chariots and carriages, the paper money and horses, and present the *General Memorial of Merit and Virtue*. The ritual procession circles the jiao banquet with incense, completing one round before standing in order before the grotto altar.

We, your humble servants, once more offer our sincerest devotion, reverently invoking the Perfected and Greatly Sagely, the Boundless and Exalted, the True Spirits of the Three Realms, and all their divine retinues. We dutifully uphold the immortal statutes and celebrate the completion of the Daoist canon. The rites have been fulfilled with the threefold offering, and blessings now descend in a hundred auspicious forms. May all that we desire be granted, and all that we seek be realized. May merit extend to the water and land realms, and goodness reach both the living and the dead. May all sentient beings partake of the profound grace.

Yet we fear that we, your servants, may have been unprepared in our study of the law, or may have transgressed in our conduct. Your disciples, so-and-so, may have erred in the offerings or fallen short in the rites. We humbly beseech your forgiveness and the universal bestowal of vast mercy. Though we are but dust in the mortal world, we dare not delay. Gazing up, we see the true chariots already ascending the cloudy heavens. May the grace of your ascent not fail our prayers.

Our hearts below are filled with boundless longing and hope for your favor. With deepest reverence, we bow twice and take our leave.

*Returning the Chariot Hymn*
Kneeling in prostration, we receive the official decrees.

The memorial is now concluded. The *Gongcao* messengers previously dispatched shall return to our bodies: entering through the Gate of Myriad Mysteries, those on the left return to the left, those on the right to the right. The *Zhishi* *Gongcao* shall preside over and supervise their return. Let each resume their original position, with no errors or confusion. When summoned again, let them arrive as before.

The incense is restored to the censer.

Fragrant Official Messengers, the Lords of the Left Dragon and Right Tiger, and all Attending Fragrant Spirit-Officials—may this place of ritual offering naturally generate golden liquid, cinnabar, azure mushrooms, and divine herbs. May the hundred spirits and host of perfected beings gather here before the incense burner. May the living and the deceased receive blessings, may households and the realm be graced with favor, and may the golden lads and jade maidens of the ten directions attend and guard the fragrant smoke. Convey this servant’s sincerity, as previously expressed, directly to the Most High, Boundless, and Utmost Dao—the Perfected Jade Emperor of the Supreme Heavenly Thearch.

Chant the hymns of burning, proceed to the pyre site, and dedicate the merit. Recite the good, intone the completion of the ritual offering—let all officials return to their positions.

*Concluding the Twenty-Second Scroll of the* Supreme Yellow Register Great Fast’s Established Rites
*Beginning the Twenty-Third Scroll of the* Supreme Yellow Register Great Fast’s Established Rites

*Transmitted by Master Chongjing of the Three Caverns, retained for use by the Most High’s Enforcing Immortal Officer Jiang Shuyu*

*Section on Ritual Procedures*
*Rite of Requesting Light and Dividing the Flame*

First prepare a bright torch and place it before the Three Treasures. The Daoist assembly arranges ranks at the fast altar, inviting the fast’s officiant to offer incense and bow. The ritual proceedings commence.

Next, the Dharma Master, together with the Attendants of Incense and Lamplight, approaches the Dao and requests the light.

The Dharma Master petitions:
Your humble servant, [Name], in full Dharma rank, now petitions the Jade Pure Highest Emperor, the Heavenly Venerable of Primordial Beginning; the Supreme Pure Great Emperor, the Heavenly Venerable of Numinous Treasure; the Grand Pure Great Emperor, the Heavenly Venerable of Dao and Virtue; the Eastern Ultimate Great Unity, the Heavenly Venerable Who Saves from Suffering; the Heavenly Venerables of the Ten Directions Who Respond to Cries for Salvation; the Greatly Compassionate and Greatly Merciful Perfected Who Save from Suffering; the Greatly Compassionate, Greatly Merciful, and Greatly Wise Perfected; and the Five Preceptor Perfected Lords of Numinous Treasure.

This servant has heard that the four kinds of birth dwell in darkness, never straying from the path of delusion; the six destinies languish in gloom, abiding forever in eternal night.

This servant has accumulated the filth of unilluminated obscurity, never encountering the radiant grace of resplendent mercy. Thus does the Preceptor’s Treasure extend compassion, as the Perfected Lords of the Emperor emanate transformation. They reveal the luminous statutes of reflected brilliance and descending light, unfolding the rites of the Lamp Repentance to dissolve transgressions. Above, it illumines the manifold heavens, augmenting the splendor of the Three Mornings; below, it shines through the Nine Nights, halting the bitterness of the myriad hells. At its center, it reflects through the ten directions, universally aiding the six destinies. The divine light universally bestowed—its wondrous efficacy defies comprehension.

Now, this disciple [Name] respectfully dedicates this offering for the departed kin [Name], and universally for all the assembled souls, establishing the Supreme Yellow Register Grand Fast to aid their deliverance. Reverently following the ritual protocols, the altar is arrayed. The divine lamps are kindled, dispelling the darkness of the unseen.

Humbly beseeching the celestial light to descend in aid, and the blessings of the Dao to flow abundantly, may the nine-hued radiance be released to deliver the suffering souls of the Yellow Springs. Throughout the ten Dharma realms and the Nine Nights’ nether gates, may all, by the merit of this illumination, together fulfill their aspirations for ascent.

With bowed head, we take refuge and invoke the empowerment of the Lamp’s fruition.
Great Sage, Primordial Beginning Heavenly Venerable,
Great Sage, Jade Pure Heavenly Venerable,
Great Sage, Mysterious Origin Heavenly Venerable.

The Dharma Master holds the talismanic candle in hand and recites the *Divine Radiance Returning* incantation:

Nine suns’ utmost purity, the Three Heavens’ Dao illumined.
Sun and moon’s divine splendor, starlight conjoined in brightness.
Threefold blossoms’ precious radiance, merging with all crystalline hues.
The Three Treasures unfold their glory, wisdom’s light awakens the divine.
Ever descending through the flying void, below it illumines the netherdark.
With a single flash of wisdom’s light, it pervades and pierces the ten directions.
The Three Wretched Paths cease their opposition, the Five Sufferings halt their turning.
The flames of Fire Mountain are stilled, ice melts and snows dissolve.
Blades transform into jade trees, swords become towering forests.
Iron cities crumble to ruin, souls ascend to Jade Clarity.
Your servant now humbly invokes, beseeching the gift of opening and clarity.
Sun and moon’s numinous consorts, starlight’s perfected ones—
the twelve bearers of the burden bow their heads in reverent compliance.
Scattering the lamps’ radiance, it shines through the cold courts.

The Dharma Master brings the talismanic candle before the Three Treasures, invoking the light into his hand, and recites the *Wisdom Light Dividing* incantation:

Vermilion brightness unfolds the chart, the workings of destiny naturally revealed.
The Three Luminaries’ brilliance opened, since before kalpas uncounted.
Today’s great celebration: sunken souls receive refinement.
The dense gloom of darkness forever sealed in the cold springs.
We now invoke wisdom’s light to shatter the gates of the netherworld.
Frozen cold warmed to harmony, furnace coals’ flames extinguished.
Blade mountains and sword trees forever severed from grasping.
Turning the light toward the ten directions, it illumines all heavens.
Souls dissolve the Five Encumbrances, karmic entanglements are erased.
The Three Celestial Bodies shine as one, through eternal kalpas unchanging.
The Light-Opening Lads, bearing grace from the Supreme Mystery,
The Three Lights’ Jade Maidens—may they fulfill this prayer as spoken.

The incense and lamp attendants, each with paper candles, approach the Dharma Master’s talismanic candle and divide its light into three torches.
The Dharma Master divides the radiance:
One gives rise to two, two gives rise to three, three gives rise to the ten thousand things.
Universally illumining the sunken darkness, all in the assembly of the pure and clear are invited to share in the radiance.

The *Flowing Light Dharma Realm Heavenly Venerable*

The incense and lamp attendants distribute and light the altar’s lamps.
Each officiant holds a paper candle, approaching the Dharma Master’s hand to receive and kindle their light.
The altar’s lamps are all fully lit, their brightness clear and far-reaching, their splendor reflecting through the ten directions.
The officiants stand in order and chant the *Returning Radiance Flying Light Hymn*.

The Dharma Master offers the dedication:
The merit of the lamps just kindled is measureless and supreme.
Dedicated to the deliverance of the hidden spirits, their ascent to the Pure Realms.
Forever parted from suffering’s darkness, eternally dwelling in light.
Benefiting the ten directions, grace extending to the Six Paths.
As an offering of the finest karmic affinity, we invoke:
The Three Clarities’ Supreme Heavenly Venerables,
The Great Unity Savior from Suffering Heavenly Venerable,
The Ten Directions’ Savior from Suffering Heavenly Venerables.
Inconceivable merit and virtue.

*Golden Bell and Jade Chime Rite*
First, place the golden bell and jade chime outside the main gate, before the incense table—the bell to the left, the chime to the right.
Next, the High Priest offers incense.
The Precentor makes the announcement.

We humbly observe: amidst the mist-veiled Flowery Grove, the heavens of heavens encircle the central realm; the cinnabar towers stand in solemn array, their reach extending beyond all phenomenal forms. Moreover, the Jade Casket offers the raft to cross the River of Love, while the Treasure Retreat moors the boat to escape the Shore of Suffering. Broadly ferrying across the Sea of Delusion, all ascend together to the fruit of the Dao. Instruments are fashioned with symbolic form—how could their functions not be fully displayed? Thus we reverently consult the grand rites of the Great Dharma, meticulously following the subtle applications of the profound liturgy. Golden bells resound in alternation, jade chimes ring in harmony. The Four Openings and Six Penetrations unfold, interspersed with the circling steps of the "Void-Stepping" hymn; the Nine Harmonies and Ten Unions proclaim the vastness of the Great Brahma’s boundless expanse. The divine wind stills into silent harmony, while the vast qi soars aloft, bearing auspicious omens. Phoenixes sing and dragons dance, tigers roar and dragons chant. The rare sound vibrates, illuminating the Three Luminaries; it ascends to the imperial precincts of the Lofty Yang. The hidden resonance resounds, parting the Nine Yin; it descends, connecting to the spirit realms of the Dark and Obscure. We, your servants, reverently establish the sacred altar, solemnly welcoming the treasure chariot. Looking up, we pray for divine response; bowing down, we present our sincere devotion. Prostrating, we take refuge in the Boundless Great Dao.

**Strike the golden bell twenty-five times**
We humbly observe: the Nine Yang conceal their resonance, the Great Sound is without sound. Its form embraces the perfection of the round ultimate, its measure encompasses the vastness of the Great Void. Relying on true quiescence to move the sagely, we hope for the mysterious harmony to gather the immortals. When struck, it responds—like the valley answering the echo. Soaring through the vast and boundless, it reaches the resplendent halls of the Crimson Precinct; silently moving the celestial pivots, it subtly manifests the elegant vistas of the Nine Heavens. Beyond the outermost, there is no beyond; knowing emptiness is not empty. The mysterious sound operates in secret, renewing the merit of the ritual.

**Incantation for Summoning the Yang Spirits**
The primordial expanse is vast and boundless, the Nine Clouds illumine the sky. The cinnabar spirits manifest their brilliance, the Five Planets interflow. True Yang blazes through, its resonance harmonizing with the Mysterious Palace. The Primordial Beginning lingers, the host of immortals reverently follows. The ten thousand qi ascend together as immortals, their subtle presence descending with profound intent. The Dao arises naturally, uniting with the Dao in truth.

**Strike the jade chime thirty times**
We humbly observe: the jade altar is purified and immaculate, the jade chime resounds with crystalline clarity. The true lords of the Six Directions gather their spirits, the yin spirits of the Nine Wilds bow their heads. Radiance descends in fivefold response, glances divide to observe the Three Paths. Awakening the deluded, returning to the origin and restoring the root. The wondrous mechanism of subtle being stirs the wondrous, the ethereal resonance of the void unites with the void. Mysteriously aligning with nature, it completes the secret model.

**Incantation for Summoning the Yin Spirits**
Supreme and lofty, the Great Void—its jasper palace and purple chambers. The Mysterious Altar fashions its instruments, the jade chime resounds with crystalline clarity. Clouds and dawns rise in flight, heaven and earth expand in unison. Yin arises in Brahma’s chant, flowing forth the primordial net. Auspicious clouds emerge at the gate, ascending to deliver the drowned and lost. Perfecting the attainment of lofty immortals, forever dwelling in the land of fortune. Uniting with the Dao in truth.

**Strike both bell and chime together thirty-six times**
We humbly observe: soaring through the void, halting the purple lightning in distant skies; streaming beacons hang like crystals, scattering subtle essences across the mysterious desert. A thousand zithers sing in the wind, ten thousand stone chimes clash in battle. Dragons hold tiger qi to welcome auspices, jade harmonizes with golden winds to display omens. Lightly dispersing the four directions, illuminating the space between the altar’s hairpin and topknot; thin mists sink into the nine depths, guiding the path of the Dharma Realm’s emptiness and non-being. Nine Harmonies and Two Qi, Ten Unions and Three Palaces. Rain and dew bestow grace, wind and clouds gather in felicitous assembly. The Two Qi merge and blend, manifesting yin and revealing yang. Gold harmonizes to move auspiciousness, jade moistens to bring tranquil prosperity. Interacting above and below, reaching the Ten Directions. The Mysterious Palace resounds in profound vibration, jade pendants chime with resonant clarity. The divine talismans proclaim their message, the altar stands in solemn reverence. The secret model is solemnly proclaimed again, the myriad spirits open and expand. Uniting with the Dao in truth.

**Strike the golden bell nine times**
**Strike the jade chime six times**
We humbly observe: at the primordial division of the undifferentiated, heaven and earth took separate forms. The nine hundred million layers of lofty clarity were distilled, while turbid stagnation congealed in the thirty-six barriers. Sound transcends phenomenal form, resonance pervades without limit. Flowing through the eight extremities to explore the depths of obscurity, penetrating the five agents to reach the outer bounds of creation. Dragons coil and clouds gather, dispelling the perverse traces of the vast seas; tigers crouch and winds calm, revealing the true knowledge of humans and heavens. The efficacy of warding off evil, the merit of the consecrated altar—inexhaustible in praise, we first reverently comply. Now, as the purified precinct is newly opened, we welcome auspiciousness from the realm of the Great Desert; the purple model is reverently proclaimed, bestowing grace upon the depths of the Dark Yin. The golden bell rings with clarity, the jade chime holds harmonious resonance. Summoning the yang spirits of virtue from the ten directions, assembling the yin lords of the nine earths. Universally attending the Dharma assembly, together witnessing the merit of the retreat. The pure assembly unites in sincerity, circling in procession to offer praise and hymns.

With reverence, we take refuge in the boundless Great Dao.

Within the wondrously serene and majestic realm, there exists the Honored One who cherishes life and delivers beings.

**Heavenly Worthy of Flowing Light Manifesting Presence,**

**Heavenly Worthy of Pervasive Illumination,**
We have heard that the primal essence has unfolded, and the celestial gates have opened. The stars array the pattern of the Pole, and the ten thousand phenomena embody the movement of primal harmony. On behalf of [Name], the sponsor of this *Yellow Register Great Retreat*, we dedicate this rite for the deliverance of the spirit of [Name], kindling the *Nine Darknesses Spirit Lamps*.

**Supreme Heavenly Worthy of Penetrating Spirit,**
The merit of the lamps kindled thus far illuminates the Three Realms above and shines upon the Nine Darknesses below. Beholding this radiance, all equally partake of its blessed power. Even the flames of the mountain of fire are stilled, and the waves of the icy pools grow calm. Those who swallowed fire and consumed coals now taste sweet dew. Golden hammers and iron staves transform into lotus blossoms. Whether lingering or departed, all ascend to the fruit of the Dao. Within the Nine Darknesses hells, the boundless sinful souls—whether they be nine generations of ancestors or seven degrees of kinship, whether forebears or recent dead, whether known or unknown, whether enemies or kin—have fallen into these hells to endure their karmic retribution. Some committed transgressions in past lives, others perpetrated wrongs across seven existences; some were bound by the three karmas or the six emotions, others by the ten evils or the five rebellions. In their lifetimes, they failed to awaken to good causes. They acted upon their own deeds, defying heaven and betraying earth. After their lives ended, they were seized by the dark officials of the netherworld, tormented by the five sufferings, and subjected to every evil. Only when their sins were exhausted and their retribution fulfilled could they obtain rebirth, yet they revolved through the three paths and cycled through the six destinies. Countless kalpas passed, and no means of escape arose. Once the human form was lost, the path of the worthy was forever forsaken. Were it not for the deliverance of the Great Dao and the compassion of the Most Sagely, the eternal night would remain unbroken, and liberation would never come. Therefore, we now repent, kindle lamps, and burn incense, praying to behold this radiance so that myriad sins may dissolve. By the power of this merit, may they be reborn among humans and gods, pay homage to the Heavenly Worthies, hear the sutras, and awaken to the Dharma. May all evils forever cease, and may all virtues be upheld. Life after life, may they forever return to the true Dao.

For this noble cause, we once more rely upon and invoke the **Heavenly Worthy of Deliverance from the Nine Darknesses**. Inconceivable is this merit.

Master Du Guangcheng states: The *True Immortal Ranks of the Golden Register of the Upper Prime* says that the ritual of kindling lamps serves emperors and rulers, above dispelling celestial disasters and rectifying celestial destinies, and below pacifying the multitudes and delivering the living and the dead. Thus, the *Nine Darknesses Spirit Lamps* illuminate the halls of blessings in the Nine Heavens above and the Nine Darknesses hells below. Humans and gods receive blessings, and the living and the dead bear its grace. As for the *Nine Darknesses Lamps*, one should procure pure fragrant oil, avoiding wealth obtained through unrighteous means or impure, foul, and defiled substances. Alternatively, various incenses may be steeped within it, so that the lamp’s flame emits a fragrant and pure fragrance. The incense’s qi ascends to move the heavens and descends to dispel foul impurities. The lamp’s light shines clearly, dispelling darkness and continuing brightness, thereby accruing great merit. The *Nine Darknesses Lamps* should be arranged before the sacred altar in a spacious hall, in the presence of the assembled sages. They are divided into nine trees, arrayed according to the nine directions, each tree bearing nine lamps. Alternatively, each tree may have nine tiers, with nine lamps on each tier. The number nine times nine models heaven and emulates earth. Below, it opens the nine nights; above, it reaches the nine ancestral generations. Delivering the living and rescuing the dead, this is the most supreme blessing. For those whose means are insufficient, even preparing nine lamps suffices, and the full ritual need not be observed. Simply burning incense and invoking the true, with sincere and profound prayers, the merit will still resonate and be equally efficacious.

Alternatively, offerings may be prepared according to each position: nine portions of water, congee, and seasonal fruits, or eighty-one portions arranged before the nine directions—this is especially refined and wondrous.

**Ritual of the Nine Hells Spirit Lamps**
The Daoist assembly establishes the hells’ precinct. The officiant offers incense, and the Dharma Master petitions the *True Talisman of Jade Purity for Breaking Open Hell*.

The ritual officer, your subject [Name], burns incense and reverently invokes:

The Great Emperor of the Mulberry Water Palace,
The Thirty-Six Lords of the Earth Mounds,
The Wardens of the Eastern Wind-and-Thunder Hell,
The Wardens of the Southern Fire-and-Glare Hell,

And all responsive and efficacious numinous spirits.

May they descend without partiality, together turning back those under surveillance. On this day, we humbly serve as the chief patron [Name] of the Great Yellow Register Retreat, dedicating merit to the deceased kin [Name]. We now establish the Supreme Great Yellow Register Retreat, kindle the Nine Hells Spirit Lamps in accordance with the Dharma, and present the *Jade Purity Precious Register* and the *True Talisman for Breaking Open Hell*. By the Emperor’s talismanic command, may they ascend at this very hour.

O Prisons of Heaven and Hells of Earth,
Dark Passes and Shadowy Roads,
Gates of the Long Night and Springs of the Underworld,
All underworld officers,
The hundred spirits who fulfill their duties,
The examiners and clerks—
Hear the talismanic command of the Highest Mystery!
Open the gates, clear the roads,
Shatter the locks, unbar the doors.
Release and deliver the bound and dedicated souls,
All the imprisoned and submerged spirits of the Nine Hells and Ten Paths.
Regardless of the weight of their transgressions,
May all be universally freed.
Let their guardian hosts come forth,
Subdue the demons and protect their ascent.
Let the dead be refined in the Southern Palace,
Their souls receive transformation.
Let them be reborn as humans,
Turn with the kalpas,
Live as long as heaven,
Forever escape the Three Paths, Five Sufferings, and Eight Adversities,
Transcend the Three Realms,
And roam freely in the Highest Clarity.
The *Precious Register* and *True Talisman* are now respectfully presented.

**Proclamation of the Talismanic Command**
**Petition to the Spirits**
The Dharma Master summons the Underworld Officers:
Reverently summon the Underworld Officers to attend before the Dao and receive the talismanic command.
Proclaim it to the Ten Directions,
And grant amnesty in accordance with the Dharma.

**Proclamation of the Pass**
**Burning of the Talisman**

The *Hymn of the Bright Lamps* is recited, and the assembly circumambulates once.

The Dharma Master transforms into the Heavenly Worthy of Great Unity Who Saves from Suffering and performs the rites as prescribed.

The lamp attendants hold the scroll and proclaim:
The Primal Unity unfolds its transformation, distinguishing high and low to shape heaven and earth.
The Three Qi radiate light, determining the rise and fall of the hidden and manifest.
Gather the immortals and sages in the azure void of celestial song,
Confine the sinful souls in the springs and valleys of Fengdu.
Karma and consciousness interact,
And beings receive retribution in the cycle of rebirth.
Once fallen into the evil destinies,
They are forever bound in the dark passes.
For aeons uncounted, they see no light,
Enduring suffering in the long night.
O Jade Capital’s sagely beings,
O Golden Portals’ mysterious perfected ones—
Greatly compassionate, universally saving, universally delivering.
You establish the standards for turning back radiance and descending light,
And bestow the texts for continuing brightness and breaking darkness.
May they attain the merit of repentance and purification,
And fulfill the vow of transcendence and ascent.

Now, the chief patron [Name] of the Great Yellow Register Retreat dedicates merit to the deceased [Name], performing this great retreat to transcend them into the immortal realms. During the retreat, we humbly kindle the lamps in accordance with the Dharma.

We pray that the Three Realms’ Imperial Masters,
The Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions Who Respond to Cries and Save from Suffering,
The Compassionate Lords of Great Unity—
Will release the nine-colored divine radiance,
And shatter the deep darkness of the underworld springs.
In boundless worlds,
May all suffering beings who behold the lamp light
Recognize their past lives,
Reflect on their transgressions, repent of their sins,
And cease their suffering and sorrow.
Riding the power of the Dao to ascend,
Relying on the true talisman to open the gates and deliver them.
Illumine the Nine Hells,
Radiate the Three Paths.
Universally reach all sentient beings,
That all may together attain the fruits of the Dao.
May the assembled pure assembly
Together offer praise.

**The Heavenly Worthy of the Nine Hells Who Delivers from Sin**
In the east of the Nine Hells lies the Wind-and-Thunder Hell.
Flying spears and drifting halberds assail the sinners.
Now, we humbly serve as the chief patron [Name] of the Great Yellow Register Retreat, dedicating merit to the deceased [Name].
We beseech the standards of the *Numinous Treasure* to kindle the Nine Hells Spirit Lamps.
We pray that the Heavenly Worthy of the Jade Treasure, the August Emperor of the East Who Saves from Suffering,
Will universally release auspicious light,
And illuminate the dark prisons.
May the compassionate breeze widely fan,
Ceasing the might of thunderclaps;
May the power of wisdom spiritually penetrate,
Forever stilling the trials of wind and thunder.
May the deceased transcend and ascend,
Their sins purified and elevated.
Entering the Cinnabar Radiance to refine their spirits,
Proceeding to the Azure Flower to receive their records.
May the assembled pure assembly
Offer praise.

**The Heavenly Worthy of the Jade Treasure, August Emperor of the Highest Heaven**
We bow to the August Emperor of the Jade Treasure in the Flowery Grove.
May you bestow your great compassion,
And deliver this deceased soul.
Liberated from the Wind-and-Thunder Hell,
Reborn in the human and heavenly paths.
Inconceivable merit.

The Dharma Master forms the Jade Purity mudra with the left hand and holds the ritual staff in the right.
Knocks the teeth nine times before the hell and recites the incantation:
Nine Qi generate smoke,
The Compassionate Lord of the Jade Treasure.
The August Qi of the Highest flows down into the underworld void.

And visualizes the precious light of the Primal Beginning illuminating and breaking open the dark prisons.

The assembly recites the **Perimeter Incantation for Breaking Fengdu** and the **Sweet Dew Incantation for Communicating with Perfection**.
Circling the altar, the Master sprinkles water with a willow branch and vessel.

The Six Palaces of the Northern Emperor shroud the unilluminated essence of the intestines; the Nine Prisons of the Northern Darkness house the dwelling of sinful souls. Without the majestic radiance of the Supreme Sages, none may open the living path of the Yellow Springs. Today, on behalf of the Great Register Retreat’s sponsor, [Name], we dedicate merit to the departed soul [Name], conducting the Dao according to ritual and kindling lamps as prescribed.

Inscribed in the Jade Clarity Register, the path of ascent and promotion is duly assembled; recorded in the Yellow Register, the grace of deliverance is thereby manifested. All suffering souls adrift shall find refuge in the true Dao. Reverently relying on the vast and towering model of the Great Way, may they all transcend to the distant and boundless immortal source. Every sentient being receives the moisture of the Dharma. Grace extends to family and state, blessings reach both the living and the dead. Bowing in reverence, we take refuge in the Boundless Great Dao.

For the supreme karmic conditions, we invoke the Most High Sovereign of Salvation, the Most High Sovereign of Deliverance from the Nine Hells, the Most High Sovereign of the Vermilion Mound, the Most High Sovereign of Rebirth According to Wish, and the Most High Sovereign of Carefree Bliss—immeasurable and inconceivable merit.

**Ritual of the Five Sufferings’ Radiant Wheel Lamp**
First, at the Earth Gate, kindle the lamps according to the prescribed form. The Dao assembly arranges itself at the lamp station, recites the *Hymn of Radiant Flight*, and circumambulates the lamp once. The Dharma Master, together with the retreat officers, offers incense and prostrations.

**Proclamation**
The wondrous Dao opens the way, establishing positions in square and round. Clarifying the lofty and pure to form the canopy of Heaven, condensing the turbid and yellow to shape the chariot of Earth. The Three Luminaries are arrayed, the myriad transformations spread forth. Above, it reaches the summit of existence; beside, it extends to the boundless. All within its illumination are nurtured and sheltered.

Yet the good and evil of human hearts diverge in intent, thus the retributions of karmic paths differ in course. If the Three Karmas remain uneliminated, how can one escape the trials of the Three Realms? If the Five Aggregates are not extinguished, how can one halt the wheel of the Five Sufferings? Having fallen into the gates of darkness, none may transcend the realm of the living. In the desolate northern wastes, the Yellow Springs’ winding paths, Fengdu’s thirty-six springs, twenty-four prisons—sinful souls are bound, destitute spirits confined. Deprived of light, they have no means of liberation.

Thus, the Primordial Sovereign pitied them, the Most High took compassion. He bequeathed the ritual of kindling lamps to dispel darkness, established the forms of repentance to absolve sins and transfer spirits. The wheel’s turning takes its image from the chariot hub; its square and round apply the method of Heaven and Earth. This merciful radiance is bestowed to extinguish all suffering and darkness.

Today, the Great Register Retreat’s sponsor, [Name], humbly dedicates merit to the departed soul [Name] and all sinful souls, solemnly establishing the supreme Great Register Retreat. Reverently following the ritual codes, we kindle one altar of the Radiant Wheel Lamp. We repent and eradicate the roots of sin, transferring and ascending the departed souls.

May the three dawns’ radiance revolve, illuminating the lands of the eight directions; may the Five Paths’ light open, forever ending the sufferings of the Nine Hells. Through the grace of wisdom and compassion, may they attain the gate of liberation. Respectfully proceeding according to the profound ritual, we perform the Dharma rites.

**Precious Radiance of the Nine Nights, Most High Sovereign**
Next, the officers circumambulate to the west of the wheel lamp and stand facing east.

The first turning path of the wheel is named the *Gate of Suffering from the Burden of Form*. All sentient beings, driven by lustful hearts, indulge their passions and desires. After the body perishes, they endure the sufferings of the Mount Tai Earth Prison. Today, the Great Register Retreat’s sponsor, [Name], following the ritual codes, kindles the repentance lamp. We dedicate it to the departed soul [Name] and all sinful souls, to eradicate the roots of the burden of form and release the sufferings of the mind and spirit.

May the Nine Clarities witness and reflect, may the Three Treasures turn their light. Humbly beseeching the mercy of pardon, may they descend to relieve the trials of the Mount Tai Earth Prison.

**Wheel-Turning Sage King, Most High Sovereign**
The Dharma Master forms the Jade Clarity mudra with the left hand and holds the ritual staff with the right, proceeding with the practice. Reciting the hidden words, he burns the banner at the lamp and sprinkles purified water with a willow branch.

The mysterious lamp illuminates the highest void,
The Nine Heavens blaze with radiance.
Within the vast golden tower,
The Brahma-voices chant the cave scriptures.
The dragon chariots of all heavens descend,
Comforting the multitude of spirits.
The demon lords hold the talismanic commands,
Ascending to report at the court of the Supreme Emperor.
Inconceivable merit.

The officers circumambulate to the north of the wheel and stand facing south.

The Second Wheel of Rebirth is called the Gate of Love’s Burdensome Affliction of the Spirit. All sentient beings drift upon the River of Love, tossed by the waves of the Sea of Desire. After the body perishes, they endure the torments of the Wind-Blade Hell.

Now, the Great Offering Master of the Yellow Register, so-and-so, in accordance with the ritual codes, kindles the lamp of repentance. On behalf of the departed spirit so-and-so and all sinful souls, may the roots of love’s burdens be extinguished, and the sufferings of spirit and form be released. We humbly pray that the Most Sacred Ones of the Jade Capital and the August Worthies of the Golden Portal may deign to bestow their merciful deliverance, relieving the trials of the Wind-Blade Hell.

**Wheel-Turning Sage King, Most High Sovereign**
The Dharma Master proceeds with the practice as before.

The mysterious lamp illumines the Great Void,
Its radiance piercing the highest emptiness.
Within the profound halls of the long night,
A hundred knots unravel and dissolve.
The sufferings of ten thousand kalpas are released in an instant,
The Nine Mysteries ascend to the heavenly abodes.
The feathered riders swiftly turn their wheels,
Journeying to the court of the Supreme Emperor.
Inconceivable merit.

The officers circumambulate to the east of the wheel and stand facing west.

The Third Wheel of Rebirth is called the Gate of Greed’s Burdensome Affliction of the Form. All sentient beings, coveting fame and pursuing profit, deplete their qi and harm their forms. After the body perishes, they endure the torments of the Mountain-Carrying and Stone-Bearing Hell.

Now, the Great Offering Master of the Yellow Register, so-and-so, in accordance with the ritual codes, kindles the lamp of repentance. On behalf of the departed spirit so-and-so and all sinful souls, may the roots of greed’s burdens be extinguished, and the sufferings of form and spirit be released. We humbly pray that the True Emperors of the Great Net and the Primordial Worthies of the Vast Kalpas may deign to bestow their merciful deliverance, relieving the trials of the Mountain-Carrying and Stone-Bearing Hell.

**Wheel-Turning Sage King, Most High Sovereign**
The Dharma Master proceeds with the practice as before.

The mysterious lamp suffuses the Nine Perfected,
Transcending the Supreme Palace of the Infinite.
Resonant and clear, the scriptures are recited,
Their jade-like voices piercing the great void.
Feet tread the steps of Heaven’s Unity,
Gaze flowing to observe the ten directions.
The Golden Tiger inscribes the register of destiny,
Abiding forever in the halls of the Supreme Emperor.
Inconceivable merit.

The officers circumambulate to the south of the wheel and stand facing north.

The Fourth Wheel of Rebirth is called the Gate of Florid Striving and Bitter Refinement. All sentient beings, coveting and contending for fleeting glory, dissipate their true qi. After the body perishes, they endure the sufferings of the River-Filling and Earth-Excavating Hell. We pray that the Supreme Sages of the Mysterious Capital and the Lofty Perfected of the Purple Palace may deign to bestow their great mercy of forgiveness, relieving the trials of the River-Filling and Earth-Excavating Hell.

**Wheel-Turning Sage King, Most High Sovereign**
The Dharma Master proceeds with the practice as before.

The mysterious lamp illumines the darkest night,
Its radiance suddenly revealing a luminous countenance.
Joyfully, the seven ancestors are liberated,
Forever freed from the Eight Difficulties.
Bathed in orchid-scented waters,
They form bonds with the towering pines.
Lifting the Ten Heavenly Perfected,
Ever to dwell with the Supreme Emperor.
Inconceivable merit.

The officers circumambulate to the northeast of the wheel and stand facing southwest.

The Fifth Wheel of Rebirth is called the Gate of Corporeal Burden and Suffering Spirits. All sentient beings, deluded by illusory realms, exhaust their spirit-souls through toil. After the body perishes, they endure the sufferings of the Fire-Swallowing, Coal-Eating, and Cauldron-Boiling Hell. Now, the Great Register-Holder of the Yellow Register Retreat, so-and-so, in accordance with the ritual statutes, kindles the divine lamp of repentance. We pray for the departed spirit so-and-so and all sin-laden souls, that the roots of corporeal burden may be extinguished and the sufferings of the spirit-souls dissolved. We pray that the True Sages of the Ten Directions and the Compassionate Worthies of the Three Realms may deign to bestow their deliverance, relieving the trials of the Fire, Coal, and Cauldron-Boiling Hell.

**Wheel-Turning Sage King, Most High Sovereign**
The Dharma Master proceeds with the practice as before.

The mysterious lamp pierces the Nine Heavens,
As if igniting the opening of the Nine Netherworlds.
Gently, the nine ancestors are liberated,
Reborn upon the jade steps.
With minds serene, they return to the Cavernous Void,
Neither thirsting nor hungering.
Within the Five-Colored Canopy of Mysterious Yellow,
Their bodies grow garments of feathers.
Inconceivable merit.

The officers return to their original positions.

The Purple Sages bestow their compassion, manifesting the luminous standard of descending radiance; the Pure and True unfold their transformations, enacting the rite of spirit-deliverance and sin-removal. Universally for those sunk in delusion, they illuminate the darkest depths. Above, their light shines upon the Nine Heavens, augmenting the splendor of the Three Mornings; below, it gleams upon the Nine Earths, stilling the bitterness of the myriad hells. The blessings pour like wine into the Yellow Springs, grace moistening the Six Paths. In the Northern Darkness’ Night Bureau, the suffering souls at the end of their punishment behold this lamp’s glow and forever depart the evil destinies.

Throughout the ten directions’ Dharma-realms, all sentient beings—from the one arising to the five, revolving in birth and return—find the Six Directions unbound and afflictions stilled. All ascend to freedom, abiding long in light.

For these supreme causes, we invoke the Great Sage Primordial Heavenly Worthy, the Most High Great Dao Lord, the Most High Lord Lao, the Heavenly Worthy of Grand Salvation, the Heavenly Worthy of Deliverance from the Nine Netherworlds, and the Heavenly Worthy of the Vermilion Mound who Liberates Lives.

Inconceivable merit.

The five incantations above derive from the Celestial Master Lu’s *Rite of Lamp-Lighting and Invocation*, titled *The Nine Netherworlds’ Five Directions Lamps*. Here ends Scroll Twenty-Four of the *Perfect Rites of the Supreme Yellow Register Great Fast*.

Scroll Twenty-Five of the *Perfect Rites of the Supreme Yellow Register Great Fast* begins.

The Most High Enforcer of the Dao, Immortal Officer Jiang Shuyu, arranges the *Ritual Gate* and the *Banner-Raising Rite*. First, at the banner-raising site, a single incense table is set. The Dharma Master and the Fast Officers offer incense together. The invocation reads:

Your humble servant in the Dharma rank, [Name], respectfully invokes the Most High Boundless Dao, the Perfect and Supreme Thirty-Six Divisions of the Venerable Scriptures, the Treasured True Writs and Talismans; the Three Supreme Ones of the Most High; the Hosts of Sages of the Ten Directions; the Heavenly Compassionate Ones of the Eastern Ultimate Heavenly Palace, the Ever-Joyful Abode; the Responsive and Attending Most High Lord of Grand Salvation; the Jade Treasure August Heavenly Worthy of the East; the Mysterious Perfected Heavenly Worthy of Myriad Blessings of the South; the Supreme and Most Wondrous Heavenly Worthy of the West; the Mysterious August Jade Dawn Heavenly Worthy of the North; the Heavenly Worthy of Transcendent Salvation of the Northeast; the Heavenly Worthy of Life-Nurturing Deliverance of the Southeast; the Supreme Numinous Void August Heavenly Worthy of the Southwest; the Boundless Grand Florescence Heavenly Worthy of the Northwest; the Jade Void Luminous August Heavenly Worthy of the Upper Realm; the True August Cavern Spirit Heavenly Worthy of the Lower Realm; the Vermilion Mound Heavenly Worthy who Liberates Lives; the Heavenly Worthy of the Wheel-Turning Sage King; the Heavenly Worthy of Transcendence and Ascension; the Great Compassionate and Great Merciful Perfected of Salvation; the Great Compassionate and Great Merciful Perfected of Great Benevolence; the Great Compassionate and Great Merciful Perfected of Sin-Removal; the Great Compassionate and Great Merciful Perfected of Deliverance; the Imperial Lord of the Radiant Yang; the August Monarch of the Consolidated Yin; the Nine August Lords of the Central Northern Dipper; the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center; the officials and attendants of the Three Realms; and all majestic numina.

Your servant has heard that the Primordial August One established the teachings to condescend to all sentient beings, while the Yellow Register bestowed its ordinances to universally deliver the suffering destinies of the Nine Netherworlds.

Establishing the fast is the foundation of reverent cultivation, while raising the banner precedes the offering of lamentation. As we prepare to inaugurate the sacred altar, it is fitting to proclaim the precious titles.

Now, with due reverence, we, the officials of such-and-such rank and name, on behalf of the departed soul of so-and-so, and for the universal salvation of all assembled spirits, hereby initiate the Supreme Yellow Register Grand Fast to aid in deliverance and inaugurate the sacred cloister. We humbly unfurl the resplendent banner, longing for the distant arrival of the Perfected’s celestial chariot and beseeching the descent of merciful radiance. May the luminous glory turn back, illuminating all with divine splendor. At the first hearing of the sacred name, the Three Wretched Realms shall, by its sound, escape suffering; by the pointing of the final grace, the Eight Directions shall be shaded and ascend. We, your servants, perform our devotions in due season, offering sincerity as though in the presence of the divine. Fearing the turbidity of the mortal realm and the sluggishness of the celestial path, we look up in reliance on supreme benevolence and bow in pity for our humble offerings.

Now, with the banner of deliverance and the divine spell of absolution, we reverently proclaim:
*The Yellow Register opens the path to salvation; the Three Realms and Ten Directions, the Four Kinds of Birth and Six Paths of Existence, all arrive at the Dao altar. May the spirits of the living be reborn and the souls of the dead be transformed, never forgotten through ten thousand kalpas.*
The banner’s essence follows the wind in flight; where the wind reaches, each turns toward its proper direction. In the courts of deepest yin, the lands of ninefold night, the hells, hungry ghosts, and boundless beings of suffering—all shall attain liberation and ascend to the heavens.
*Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the Ordinance of the Most High for the Salvation of the Living.*

Next, the banner is raised and the invocation made:
*Banner of Absolution, Heavenly Worthy of Deliverance.*
The boundless merit of raising the banner is hereby universally dedicated. To the Ten Directions, Three Realms, Six Paths, and Four Kinds of Birth, may all together realize the mysterious merit and jointly attain the fruit of the Dao.

For the supreme karmic connection, we invoke the Great Sage Primordial Heavenly Worthy, the Most High Lord of the Great Dao, the Most High Lord Lao, the Heavenly Worthy of Great Compassion and Salvation, and the Heavenly Worthies of Salvation in the Ten Directions. Inconceivable merit!

**Initiating the Scripture-Recitation Rite**
The Dao assembly gathers at the scripture hall, facing the Three Treasures before the Celestial Throne, and stands in order.

**The Opening Hall Hymn**
The Dharma Master offers incense and makes the invocation:

Your servant, of such-and-such Dharma rank, burns incense and reverently invokes:

The incense is jade blossoms scattering radiance, the ninefold qi congealing into fragrant smoke. The dense clouds of incense weave a net, piercing straight through the Nine Heavens. May the Golden Lad who attends the incense and the Jade Maiden who transmits words convey your servant’s invocation and bring it before the Celestial Throne. May all that your servant has invoked be granted as petitioned.

Your servant has heard that the jade scripts and golden writings unfold the transformation of the Double Mystery; the precious chapters and sacred models give rise to patterns before the Void and Cavern. They safeguard and secure the state and household, transcending all ranks and kinds. Their divine efficacy is unfathomable, their profound meaning inexhaustible.

Today, on behalf of the Ritual Officer So-and-so, I solemnly offer this for the deceased kin So-and-so Yi, and universally for all the souls assembled here, having established the Supreme Yellow Register Grand Fast. In prayer for their ascent and deliverance, on this very day, we turn and recite the true scriptures of the Most High in all their departments, their resonant titles inscribed upon jade tablets. Reverently relying upon the power of the Dao, we universally deliver those sunk in darkness. Looking up, I implore your gracious radiance; looking down, I beseech your witnessing presence.

Your servant’s heart is filled with utmost sincerity, devotion, and reverence. Having heard the scriptural petition, I now respectfully proclaim it.

[The proclamation of the scriptural petition is concluded; it is then burned.]

All officials proceed to their positions.
The Three Refuges ritual hymn is intoned.
All in the ritual arena, holding tablets before their hearts, sit properly as prescribed.
The hymns of praise are chanted as prescribed.
The *Host of Past Lives* hymn is sung.
Incense is carried; hands are purified with water.
The scriptures are unfurled.
The *Silent Recollection* is recited as prescribed.
The Dharma Master recites the *Mystic Store* mantra.
The scriptures are opened.

At the dawn of kalpas vast, the cloud-script filled the void.
Now distant, now near—now sinking, now floating.
Five directions circling, beyond a zhang’s reach.
The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign took brush in hand and wrote,
Expounding the profound chapters, inscribing next the numinous talismans.

The Primordial Beginning bestowed the True Writ,
Spreading its radiance in the manifest, its mystery in the hidden.
Those afflicted by unseen ills may heal themselves of dust.
The weary and drowned may float free;
the lost in darkness shall rise, by this means ascending to the Immortal Capital.

Today, on behalf of the chief patron of the Yellow Register Grand Fast, the official [Name], hailing from [Place], we reverently offer this for the deceased kin [Name] as principal dedication, and for the living as universal blessing—adjusting the intent of the fast as announced on the [Day] of this month, having pre-notified the Three Heavens and filed records across the Three Realms.

We now gather the pure assembly before us to open and recite the various true scriptures of the *Most High Cavernous Mystery, Numinous Treasure*, dedicating them to the Three Treasures, the August Thearch, the Ten Poles’ Lofty Perfected, the Three Origins and Three Realms, the Mountain, Earth, and Water Bureaus, the altar’s assembled deities of the jiao, and the mourned departed spirits, the ten directions’ sin-laden souls.

The sacred titles of the true scriptures, their merit complete, are proclaimed in a separate memorial.
May the sagely insight return in brilliance; may the thearch’s compassion grant protection.
Sever the earthly roots at death’s gate, stilling karmic retribution;
Refine the yin souls at life’s portal, elevating form and spirit.
May the eight directions know purity and peace; may the nine nights shine resplendent.
May all sentient beings attain the wondrous fruit of non-action.

For this supreme cause, we invoke:
The Great Sage Primordial Heavenly Worthy,
The Most High Great Dao Lord,
The Most High Lord Lao,
The Heavenly Worthy of Great Compassion Who Saves from Suffering,
The Heavenly Worthy Who Delivers from the Nine Hells,
The Heavenly Worthy Who Crosses to the Vermilion Mound,
The Heavenly Worthy of the Great Bridge of Salvation,
The Heavenly Worthy of the Cinnabar Realm of Fire,
The Heavenly Worthy of the Wheel-Turning Sacred King,
The Heavenly Worthy Who Grants Rebirth According to Wishes,
The Heavenly Worthy of Carefree Bliss,
The Heavenly Worthy of Lofty Perfection’s Wondrous Fruit,
The Heavenly Worthies of the Numinous Treasure of the Ten Directions—
their inconceivable merit and virtue.

*Opening the Scriptures Hymn*
The rotation of recitation proceeds as prescribed; the methods of visualization and recollection are found in the *Ritual for Ascending the Altar and Reciting Scriptures*.

**Rite of the Divine Tiger Announcing the Jade Tablet**

First arrange pure tea, wine, and fruit offerings. The Daoist assembly stands in order, while the Dharma Master performs the visualization as prescribed.

**Prayer of Incense**
By the power of sincere devotion, the myriad sages descend from afar.
With crimson sincerity ascending, the thousand perfected gather in full.
Relying on the divine spirits to convey our heartfelt pleas,
borrowing the precious incense to transmit our minds.
Reverently we burn this sacred incense,
offering it to the Three Clarities and Supreme Saints,
the Ten Poles of Lofty Perfected,
the Seven Primordials of the Northern Dipper,
the Dark and Mysterious Great Unity Lady of the Northern Dipper,
the Heavenly Unity Divine Tiger of Northern Blessing,
the Great Unity Purple Prime Jade Tablet Lady,
the Male Left Jade Minister Xuanbo,
the Female Right Martial Luan Master Clerk,
the Envoys of the Three Bureaus Who Pursue Souls,
the Three Direct Seal Spirits,
the Seven Primordial Jade Maidens,
the Officials and Soldiers Who Seize and Capture Hun and Po,
the Great Gods of the Five Paths,
the True Officials of Earth and Local Domains,
and the Void-Space Overseers—
all numinous and responsive powers.
By this true incense, we make universal offering.

The incense is jade blossoms scattering radiance, ninefold qi congealing in mist.
The fragrant clouds densely woven, piercing the nine heavens.
The Golden Lad Who Attends the Incense and the Jade Maiden Who Transmits Words
ascend to report before the Celestial Emperor,
so that all our petitions may be granted as spoken.

Now, in accordance with the intent of entering the fast:
We submit that yang gives life while yin brings death,
illuminating good and evil with impartiality;
earth is turbid while heaven is pure,
determining ascent and descent by their own nature.
The Northern Kuei establishes the bureau of pursuit and seizure,
while the Southern Chang maintains the office of refinement and deliverance.
This may be called the great compassion of the supreme Dao,
the universal deliverance of the luminous perfected.
Today, on behalf of so-and-so,
we beseech the performance of this fast and rite,
bestowing blessings upon both the hidden and the manifest.
Respectfully following the golden precepts,
we proclaim and enact the Jade Tablet.
May the nine springs open the way to deliverance,
and the six paths receive grace.
May all sentient beings
attain the wondrous fruit.
The officiating assembly, pure and clear,
purifies the altar as prescribed.

**Purification by Sprinkling**   *Prayer repeated*

The dead cannot be revived, yet the Most High possesses the method of returning the soul;
the Dao transforms through non-action, as the Primordial Perfection bestows the ordinance of universal deliverance.
To restore the lingering departed to life, one must first summon their ethereal consciousness.
With my utmost concentration, I align with their numinous presence,
hoping to disperse the accumulated gloom of yin’s miasma,
that it may not offend the harmonious yang qi.

We humbly beseech the Divine Tiger Great Sage and the Lords of Pursuit and Seizure,
to remember the teachings and precepts of the Primordial Beginning,
and to regard with favor the sincere supplications of the fast’s sponsor.
Hearing the call, respond with compassion.
The Dao assembly, in utmost devotion, wholeheartedly invokes:

We beseech the Divine Tiger Host of Sages.
The Dharma Master forms the mudra, intones the secret incantation,
and presents the Jade Tablet of the Dark Heaven and the talismanic script of the Divine Tiger.
Primal Unity converges qi, the Supreme One and the Mysterious Dark.
Pursue the soul, seize the spirit, open the yang, and awaken the yin.
Let all spirits heed and attend—how dare they not receive our summons?

Divine Tiger Jade Maidens, Divine Tiger Great Sage,
Messengers of Soul-Pursuit, Officers of Spirit-Seizure:
Come swiftly at the first call, without delay or hesitation.
Receive the talismanic command and proclaim it to the cold courts.
Pursue the soul, seize the spirit, manifest shadow and form.
Come to this Dharma assembly, and may your merit be reported to the Jade Emperor.

Burn the talisman.
Visualize the offering of supreme incense,
present tea and wine in three libations,
and conduct the ritual as prescribed.

Proclamation:
Issuing talismans and conferring registers, all follow the ordinances of the Most High;
seizing spirits and summoning souls, all adhere to the decrees of the Primordial Master.
May cloud-borne chariots traverse every realm,
reaching even the gates of the Yellow Springs.
Guide the soul’s procession to attend this Dharma assembly.
The altar’s proclamation is now solemnly recited.

Recitation of the Jade Tablet Proclamation:
The preceding altar proclamation has been fully recited.
We humbly invoke the Two Great Sages of the Divine Tiger,
the Messengers of the Three Departments, the Seven Jade Maidens,
to bear the Hidden Writ of the Mysterious Dark and the Jade Tablet of Primal Unity,
ascending to the Ninefold Purity, descending to the Ninefold Underworld,
and extending to the ten directions, three realms,
the Northern Yin of Fengdu, the Ninefold Dark Prisons, the grotto palaces of immortals—
opening barriers and clearing paths,
to pursue and retrieve the soul of the departed so-and-so,
along with all wandering spirits and lingering souls across the nine provinces,
the six paths, the four modes of birth,
that they may swiftly depart their stations and come to this numinous altar.
Attend the audience of the Most High, approach the living kin.
Go everywhere, reach everywhere.
In accordance with the mysterious ordinances and the jade statutes, act without delay,
lest the work of deliverance be hindered.

Burn the talismanic proclamation as prescribed.

The Dharma Master paces the Dipper, enters the Dipper’s realm,
holding the Water Sword, facing east and standing to the south, intones:
"Supreme One, Purple Primordial Sovereign,
Celestial One of the Northern Charge,
Divine Tiger soars on the halberd,
wielding the Dipper’s sway—
wherever the Jade Tablet reaches,
gather the radiant essence of the ten directions in a single breath.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and command!"

The Dharma Master draws qi from the southeast, infuses it into the water,
and sprays a mouthful, intoning:
"Generals He and Qiao,
Messengers of the Three Departments for Soul-Pursuit,
hasten to the realm of the living and the abode of the dead,
to pursue and retrieve the soul of the departed so-and-so.
Swiftly attend this Dharma assembly,
to receive the merit of the Numinous Treasure’s ascension and deliverance."

Visualize the officers departing to pursue the departed soul.
Recite the *Nian Shan San* as prescribed.

*Concluding the Twenty-Fifth Scroll of the* Supreme Yellow Register Great Fast *Established Rites*
*Beginning the Twenty-Sixth Scroll of the* Supreme Yellow Register Great Fast *Established Rites*
Compiled by the Celestial Enforcer of the Most High, Immortal Jiang Shuyu
*Section on Rituals: Rite of Summoning the Departed*

First prepare an incense-and-flower altar, placing it before the Ghost Gate, with the soul-summoning banner set before the altar. Invite the fast’s patron to offer incense, while the Daoist assembly lines up in order and intones the *Universal Offering Hymn*. The Dharma Master then offers incense and makes the following declaration:

*"In this duly ordained ritual office, your servant [Name] now kindles incense and respectfully memorializes the Three Clarities and Three Realms, the Ten Poles and Ten Radiant Realms, the Compassionate Venerables of the Great Dao, the Great Saints of all Heavens, the Palaces of Sun and Moon, the Northern Dipper and Southern Asterisms, the Five Planets and Three Terraces, the Earthly Waters and Sacred Mountains, the Rivers and Marshes, and all responsive numina of the Ten Directions and Three Realms. By this true incense, we make universal offering. This incense is jade blossoms scattering radiance, ninefold qi congealing as mist—its fragrant clouds densely woven, ascending straight to the Nine Heavens. May the Golden Lads who attend the incense and the Jade Maidens who transmit words hear this above before the Celestial Emperor, so that what your servant now petitions may be granted as spoken."*

*"Your servant now humbly acts on behalf of the fast’s patron [Name], who, in this grand offering of the Supreme Yellow Register Great Fast—observed for three days and three nights—solemnly dedicates it to the departed kin [Name] and universally to all souls present. Having already submitted the memorial to the Celestial Bureaus, entreated the Preceptor, memorialized the Ten Directions, and sealed the covenant with the Three Realms, we now inaugurate this fast’s altar with the established rites. We reverently beseech your compassion to bestow deliverance, to issue decrees commanding the numinous authorities, summoning and gathering the departed souls to attend this Dharma assembly, receive the fruits of merit, and ascend to the realm of rebirth. Your servant now purifies thought and darkens the heart, reverently invoking true response."*

The Dharma Master visualizes the transformation step upon the Divine Tiger’s Stellar Diagram and summons the spirits:

*"We solemnly summon the Northern Kui and Mysterious Model Bureau; the Divine Tigers who seize souls and capture hun-po; the Jade Maidens of the Inverted Life Office; the Male Left Jade Court’s Mysterious Elder; the Female Right Martial Phoenix’s Chief Scribe; the Upper, Middle, and Lower Departments’ Soul-Pursuit Messengers; the Great Spirits of Cloud and Auxiliary Essence; the Sevenfold Merit Officers; those who call and breathe forth hun-po; the Luminous Essence Clerks and Soldiers; the Community Deities and City Gods; the Five Roads’ Earth Deities; and all guiding spirits of good. Hear this urgent summons and hasten to this altar!"*

*"On behalf of the fast’s patron [Official Title and Name], who has inaugurated this Supreme Yellow Register Great Fast to universally dedicate it to the departed kin [Name] and all souls present, we seek to dissolve karmic burdens and enable transcendence to the realm of rebirth. Having already memorialized all Heavens and sealed the covenant with the Ten Poles, we now require the dedicated souls—hun of the departed and po of the kin—to come before this altar and reverently receive the fast’s merit. Today, at this hour of the [Day] day of the [Month], we dispatch the Great Unity Primal Divine Tiger’s Jade Edict, to proceed in advance to the realm of the living and the abode of the dead, executing the preliminary pursuit and capture. Now, in reverent compliance with the Jade Statutes and in observance of this precious fast, we require the aforementioned departed souls to come before this numinous altar and undergo deliverance according to the rites. We humbly entreat the Two Great Saints of the Divine Tigers, the Three Departments’ Soul-Pursuit Messengers, the Seven Jade Maidens, and all others to urgently traverse the Three Realms and Ten Directions, to every office where myriad true numina fulfill their duties, to pursue and seize the soul of [Name], bringing it before the soul-summoning banner to attend the true ones, hear the Dharma, receive transformation, and attain rebirth. Let none delay or obstruct this deliverance. If universally dedicating, proclaim the list of names and statuses here."*

The Dharma Master burns the *Great General’s Soul-Summoning Talisman* and silently recites the incantation.

The *Lingbao* Talismanic Command delivers and liberates the departed souls of [Name] and others, releasing them from hell and forever parting from eternal night. Let the Five Sufferings and Three Paths no longer detain them. Let them break free from the pressing throng of ghosts and sever the bonds of death’s register. Swiftly, swiftly, as the Statutes of the Great Emperor of Longevity decree!

The invocation is repeated:
I act as Heaven’s agent to transform, delivering the dead and aiding the living. Relying on your numinous efficacy, assist my true Dharma. All departed souls—whether dwelling in the heavens or among humans, whether fallen into ghostly realms, detained for interrogation, or bound in dark yin—are hereby summoned in accordance with the talismanic command of the Supreme Mystery, the jade writ of celestial script. Pursue and seize their souls, hastening them to this altar. Reveal their forms in clarity, reconnect them with their yang kin. Thus shall the great teaching be proclaimed, and all beings find faith. This is executed strictly in accordance with the statutes of the Mysterious Canon and jade ordinances; none may delay or obstruct.

Next, the Pure Yang Youth is directed to hold the banner,
while the officiating Daoist performs the summons according to ritual.
The *Talismans of the Two Great Saints* are burned, and the Master silently intones:
Left, the Mysterious Elder of the Jade Bureau; right, the Martial Mistress of the Phoenix Office. I now summon the departed souls of [Name] and others to swiftly come before the soul-summoning banner, without delay. He Chang, Qiao Xun—aid my spirit. What I command must be swiftly obeyed. Swiftly, swiftly!

During the summoning, the Dharma Master transforms into the Most High Heavenly Worthy. From the *Hand Seal of the Original Master*, passing through the *Two Principles and Jia Signs*, to the *Hand Seal of Returning to the Supreme Emperor*, the seal is pressed upon the departed one’s life destiny. Drawing qi from the Ghost Gate, he blows it onto the banner. With focused intent, he invokes the Three Yuan Attendants, Divine Tiger General, Seizer of Souls Official, and Pursuer of Spirits. May they descend without delay, swiftly arrive at the ritual altar, and guide the departed soul to manifest clearly in response.

With focused intent, he summons the departed soul of [Name], praying that the spirit remain undimmed, as if still living. This very night, at this very hour, may it come before the Dharma assembly to receive this Yellow Register and partake in the merit of liberation.

**Hymn of the Dipper:**
The cycles of yin and yang shift as kalpas turn,
Life and death flow in ceaseless return—who is wise, who is foolish?
The wheel of rebirth knows no end, shaped by the Upper Yuan’s creation,
Yet those who have not transcended the Three Realms remain bound by divine transformation.
□□ the Eastern Dipper, □□ the Western turn,
□□ the Southern Dipper, □□ the Northern face.
Yin spirits drift in obscurity, lost in the void,
Yang souls wander in restless gloom, unseen and unheard.
When heaven and earth are still, myriad ghosts lie hidden;
When heaven and earth stir, myriad ghosts awaken.
As yin and yang revolve, ghosts and spirits receive their due—
Why, then, does the summoning of the Great One linger?
First or last to arrive, the law remains constant:
Hear this call, hasten to my altar,
And be granted the sacred writ to ascend to the Highest Clarity.

The Dharma Master forms the *Hand Seal for Seizing Souls* and silently recites the secret incantation (as recorded in the *Secret Instructions for Practice*):
*Xingsheng, Duli, Kehan, Gongdu, Juhun, Duihun she.*
He then intones:
May the soul’s spirit be pure and upright,
May the myriad qi endure forever.
Spared from suffering and torment,
May the body radiate light.
Restore the original form,
Revive the original spirit.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the Law of the Great Emperor of Eternal Life.

Three times repeated, he draws northern qi and blows it onto the banner, visualizing the arrival.

The Dharma Master recites aloud:
*Taiguang, Youjing, Shuangling*—the Three Hun—
Return to emptiness, return to truth,
To the primordial qi of heaven and earth.
Once more, gather your form and spirit.
This is the true work of the Five Agents’ creation,
No hiding, no evasion, no escape.
At a single call, swiftly transform into a true spirit.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the law commands.

The officiating Daoist summons again:
With focused intent, he invokes the Three Yuan Attendants, Divine Tiger General, Seizer of Souls Official, and Pursuer of Spirits. May they descend without delay, swiftly arrive at the ritual altar, and guide the departed soul to manifest clearly in response.

With focused intent, he summons the departed soul of [Name], praying that the spirit remain undimmed, as if still living. This very night, at this very hour, may it come before the Dharma assembly to receive this Yellow Register and partake in the merit of liberation.

**Hymn of the Yellow Return:**
The Banner of the Yellow Return from the Grand Tenuity,
The Luminous Command of the Peerless One.
Summoning from the Palace of Endless Night,
Liberating and receiving the souls of the reborn.
Such inconceivable merit!

The Dharma Master recites aloud:
The Three Officials of the Northern Feng,
Inspecting the ghostly encampments.
No concealment permitted,
The golden horse relays the decree.
Proclaimed universally,
All spirits heed the call.
The Five Emperors of the Three Realms,
Declare it to the Highest Clarity.

The Dharma Master burns the *Talisman of the Merit Official for Healing Illness* and the *Talisman for Summoning the Five Spirits to Merge*, praying:
Incense is offered to petition the Azure Emperor, Lord Protector of the Hun;
The White Emperor, Attendant of the Po;
The Vermilion Emperor, Nourisher of Qi;
The Black Emperor, Conveyor of Blood;
The Yellow Emperor, Central Sovereign;
The Heavenly Physician, Great Sage of the Six Offices;
The Divine Healers of the Two Bureaus;
The Life-Forming Doctors;
The Merit Officials for Healing;
The Generals Who Gather Poisons;
The Dispensers of Medicinal Spirits;
The Stone-Needle Attendants;
The Officials of Bian Que;
The Immortal Medicine Youths;
The Great Generals of Life-Transformation Who Restrain Hun and Po;
And all spirit authorities.
May they all, in compassion, descend to this altar,
And on behalf of the souls now present to receive liberation,
Draw down true qi to heal their afflictions,
Revive their hun and po,
Restore their forms and spirits,
In accordance with the statutes of the Most High.

The Dharma Master, conducting the affairs of the Five Bureaus, silently recites the true names of the Five Emperors and performs the ritual.

The Dharma Master prays:
On behalf of the ritual sponsor [Name], I now universally deliver the departed kin [Name] and all assembled souls, establishing this Supreme Yellow Register Grand Ritual.
Thus, I summon and gather the departed souls of the sponsor’s entire household—
Those being delivered, along with the nine generations of ancestors, the seven lineages of descent,
Parents, spouses, children,
Brothers, sisters,
Nephews, grandchildren,
Close and distant kin,
Inner clan and outer relatives,
All named dependents,
And those bound by marriage ties—
Those who owe life, owe wealth,
Owe gratitude, owe virtue,
Whether deceased before or after,
And all karmic adversaries.

All shall arrive at the Dao altar to universally receive deliverance and enlightenment.
By the power of the Dao, I enable you all to rejoice and be at ease.
Come forth to the Dao altar; you should quietly focus your thoughts and cast aside all fear.
This ritual fast is called the Rite of Equality.
If the Three Poisons remain unremoved, still clouding the Six Perceptions,
if enmity and kinship, self and others, are falsely distinguished,
then there can be no true equality.

Those who come in male form shall array themselves to the left;
those who come in female form shall array themselves to the right.
Each shall take the hand of another and follow the ritual banners to approach.
Bathe, change garments, and attend the altar to hear the Dharma.
The pure assembly, with reverent sincerity, shall recite hidden invocations to guide the way.

The spirit script leads the departed souls to the bathing place,
where one attendant sprinkles purified water along the path with a willow branch to cleanse defilements.

**Ritual for Bathing the Departed Spirits**
First, within the bathing chamber, prepare two fragrant-water baths with meticulous purity.
All necessary bathing implements shall be fully provided.
A clean wooden bucket filled with purified water shall be placed before the main path.

The Dharma Master leads the Dao assembly to the incense table,
where they offer incense and stand in proper order.
The Dharma Master makes the invocation to request the water:

*"In my ritual position, your servant [Name] burns incense and respectfully invokes the Three Treasures, Venerable Masters,
the Ten Directions’ Great Sages, the Five Ancient Lords, the Thirty-Two Heavenly Emperors,
the Lords of the Sun, Moon, and Five Planets, the Star Lord of the Eastern Well,
and all assembled deities of the Yellow Register, whose majestic numen responds to invocation.
I have heard that departed souls undergoing refinement must rely on the true key of enlightenment;
that defiled qi, scattered and profuse, requires the cleansing power of Dharma-water for purification.
To achieve deliverance, I now humbly present this petition.
On behalf of the ritual sponsor [Name], I have established this Supreme Yellow Register Grand Ritual
to properly deliver the departed kin [Name] and universally deliver all assembled souls.
In strict accordance with ritual protocol, I have summoned and gathered the spirits.
First, I shall cleanse their forms and spirits, then guide them to attend the altar.
May their karmic transgressions and impurities be repented, allowing them to transcend and attain rebirth.
I pray for your compassion, that you deign to hear and deliver them.
Send forth true qi and bestow the radiance of celestial light,
that all souls receiving deliverance may bathe in the profound blessings of the Mysterious and the Primordial.
I offer this prayer with utmost reverence."*

Next, the water is stirred with a ladle, beginning from the lunar station.
The assembly recites the hidden invocations in unison, stirring thirty-two times in accordance with the sound.

**The Master’s Dedication**
*"O majestic and virtuous One, whose merit and practice are complete,
descend to receive and guide, as the Treasure of the Master accompanies.
With compassion, bestow the Dharma-water to wash away delusion,
forever delivering them from the shores of the Three Wretched Realms,
eternally parting from the mire of the Five Defilements.
All the boundless meritorious causes from the invocation of this water
shall now cleanse the departed spirit [Name] of all karmic roots,
universally purifying them for the above-stated purpose."*

Recite the names of the Great Sage, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy,
the Most High Lord of the Dao, the Most High Lord Lao,
and the Ten Directions’ Savior from Suffering, the Heavenly Worthies.
*Inconceivable merit and virtue.*

The Heavenly Worthy of the Celestial River’s Purifying Bath leads them to the bathing chamber,
where the invoked water is divided between the male and female bathing areas.
Boil the Five Fragrances decoction and mix it with the water, ensuring it is warm and suitable.

The officiating Daoist performs the ritual.

The Three Wretched Realms’ scorching afflictions
are cooled by the grace of the Dharma’s moisture;
the Five Entanglements’ binding coils
are washed and scoured by the numinous stream.
Thus does our Heavenly Worthy, moved by compassion,
the Great Dao’s merciful kindness,
sprinkle and shower all beings,
delivering them from every suffering.
He reveals the wondrous canon of perfumed cultivation,
bestows the luminous rite of bathing and refinement,
enabling them to bathe in the Flower Pool,
attaining carefree ease upon the Dao’s shore.
Thereafter, form and spirit both become wondrous,
blessings and felicity arise of themselves.

We now reverently invite the departed spirit to approach the bath with devotion.

Recite the *Eastern Well Hymn*, with the assembly responding in harmony.
The Dharma Master visualizes the chamber filled with five-colored clouds of qi,
the qi of the Thirty-Two Heavens, the sun, moon, and Five Stars,
intermingling within the water.

The Celestial River pours into the Eastern Well,
the essence of the Stone Mirror Water Mother.
A halo of radiance brushes the spirit’s brilliance,
mysterious luminance gleaming in lofty clarity.
The Primordial Beginning parts the heavy night,
heavenly beings follow the moon’s birth.
Bathed upon the Orchid Pool,
dragons bear the Long Geng vase.
Golden Lads scatter fragrant flowers,
Jade Maidens stream the Five Stars.
Crown and sash are laved in jade fluid,
refining and transmuting the Five Immortals’ forms.
The body’s fragrance summons myriad spirits to descend,
riding the light to ascend the heights of purity.

Though the long night’s luminosity
derives from the talisman’s deliverance from suffering,
the fullness of meritorious deeds
still relies on fragrant water to refine the essence.
May this corporeal form of the Five Aggregates
receive the profound teachings of the Double Mystery.

Let all the Dharma assembly now cultivate pure minds,
and on behalf of the departed spirit, recite the *Three Primes’ Sincere Bathing and Purification Spell*:

Heaven’s qi is serene and clear,
five colors resplendent in lofty brightness.
Sun and moon emit their radiance,
tempering and refining the body’s form.
The spirit’s fluid washes within,
fragrant waters refine the essence.
Light and brilliance shine through,
illuminating the Highest Clarity.
Qi admits no dust,
the Five Palaces receive the numinous.
Sins vanish from the Three Wretched Realms,
calamities disperse from the Nine Darknesses.
The body receives liberation,
ascending into the Imperial Court.
Purifying form and refining substance,
the name is inscribed in the Purple Register;
delivering life and returning to birth,
the character is listed upon the Jade Clarity.
To render the soul-spirit limpid and upright,
all karmic filth must be dissolved.

Let all the Dharma assembly now cultivate minds of beneficence,
and on behalf of the departed spirit, recite the *Nine Perfected Ones’ Bathing and Refinement Spell*:

The Most High Perfected Ones,
essences of the Nine Numinous.
They cause souls to fly as immortals,
ascending to the Purple Court.
Bathed in the Flower Pool,
the spirit-body becomes limpid and clear.
Essence penetrates the Great Void,
myriad qi arise of themselves.
Invoking the Venerable One of the Eastern Ultimate,
universally delivering the living and aiding the dead;
stirring the Cinnabar Flower’s waters,
thoroughly removing defilement and dispersing yin.
May they forever uphold the Orthodox Perfected,
and constantly practice purity and stillness.

Let all the Dharma assembly now cultivate vast and expansive minds,
and on behalf of the departed spirit, recite the *Great Spell of Bathing, Cinnabar Yang, and Refinement*:

The Dragon Han is vast and boundless,
formless and nameless.
Across countless kalpas,
the August Dao opens in clarity.
The spirit lamp shines brightly,
the Nine Souls emit their essence.
Jade Void gleams with radiance,
Great Auroras resplendent in lofty brightness.
The Primordial Beginning initiates transformation,
all heavens unite in numinosity.
The Three Primes guide and nurture,
the Two Images gather and give life.
Those already delivered are delivered,
those unformed are formed.
The dead are transformed,
the withered flourish.
All creatures that wriggle and fly,
every dark spirit.
Those with child and those pregnant,
all receive life.
The departed spirit transcends fate,
the soul returns to the Three Clarities.
The po receives refinement and transmutation,
the Southern Palace transforms the form.
Today is most auspicious,
all attain luminosity.
The Five Emperors witness and reflect,
universally proclaiming to the myriad spirits.
Heavenly and earthly deities,
and all river sources.
The Five Peaks and Four Waterways,
and all renowned mountains.
Caverns of Mystery, Caverns of Void,
Caverns of Emptiness, Caverns of Immortals.
The Boundless Great Sage,
the Most Perfect Honored Spirits.
Without limit or end,
universally overseeing the deliverance of beings.
The roots of earth are severed,
names are recorded in the Mystic Capital.
All spirits shine together,
all heed this command.
Upon the Nine Clarities’ Jade Throne,
the grace of the August Emperor extends;
within the Three Caverns’ Golden Writ,
the compassionate Honored One’s Dharma words unfold.
How could this be aspired to by the dust-bound and ordinary?
Such is not for the defiled and impure to hear.

Having purified body and form,
attire must be made solemn.
Let all the Dharma assembly now cultivate minds of dignity,
and on behalf of the departed spirit, recite the *Three Primes’ Sincere Crown and Sash Spell*:

The Five Turbidities are now clear,
the Eight Effulgences now bright.
Today, receiving refinement,
sins vanish and blessings arise.
Forever equal with the Five Emperors,
joining the Perfected Ones of the Upper Numinous.

Burn the *True Robe of the Morning Audience* and the like.

The Six Palaces and Five Offices
internally purge the multitude of delusions;
the nine orifices and hundred bones
externally cleanse all impurities.
Thus may they approach the altar to hear the Dharma,
repent sins and remove transgressions.
Receive the prohibitions to sever evil roots,
attain the majestic light to know past lives.
Drawn forth from the earth’s gate,
ascend to be born in heaven.

On behalf of the departed spirit, we now reverently submit and await.

The Dharma rite guides the spirit back to its place.

Before the spirit’s seat, first perform the *Spell-Food Rite*,
arranging pure water, fragrant flowers, and offerings as prescribed.

Offer incense, and make the proclamation:

Golden grains and jade nectar,
those who partake ascend to the Nine Clarities’ realm.

Fire-pear and flame-date,
those who partake depart the Five Nights’ realm.
Without the power of the Dao as their aid,
how could they cross the Dharma-bridge?

The departed spirit of [Name],
suddenly swept away by flowing waters,
has fleetingly traversed the stream of time.
As the season of renewal approaches,
we reverently prepare pure and fragrant offerings.
Relying on the assembly of the pure,
we follow the subtle rites in due order.
Recite the precious gāthā to empower,
chant the spirit’s verses to confer prophecy.

We humbly pray the soul may remain undimmed,
as if still living.
May it partake of this fast’s merit
and perfect the wondrous Dao.

On behalf of the departed spirit, we dedicate this to aid rebirth in the celestial realms.
Recite the *Jade Clarity Wisdom-Life Summons Spell*:

bow in homage to the Profound Mystery Lord.
Fashioning heaven and earth without boasting virtue,
you become the refuge for all beings.
Compassionately deliver the souls of the Five Paths’ turning wheel,
pity and rescue the three souls from hell’s torments.
Homage to the Golden Portal Heavenly Worthy,
homage to the Six Perfections’ Merciful Father,
homage to the Jade Clarity Supreme Perfected.
Thus may they escape birth and death, everlastingly.
Emerging from existence, entering the void without reliance,
you transform the withered and decayed into immortals.
Once in a thousand kalpas, once in ten thousand kalpas—rarely encountered—
for the multitudes you broadly expound the causes of karma.
Reviving the corpse, raising the dead to eternal life,
you ensure their form and spirit remain unchanged.

*From the Jade Clarity Scripture.*

**Great Unity Savior from Suffering Heavenly Worthy**
All respond three times (hereafter the same).

We have heard that Fengdu’s depths are distant,

With the samādhi blue lotus,
they ascend to the divine, eternally at peace.

Now that hell’s gates are opened,
Fengdu’s judgments cease.
Wherever transformation is entrusted,
they emerge from the dark yin.

Now we recite the *Jade Clarity Brahma-Chant, Life-Soul Nurturing Dharma Words*:

For the departed spirit, we dedicate this to aid rebirth in the celestial realms.
Recite the *Jade Clarity Cloud Palace Brahma-Chant, Life-Soul Nurturing Spell*:

the source of all transformations.
Within, the seven pò cohere;
above, the three hún conjoin.

entering and exiting without gate.
In the dim and distant,
flickering with primordial essence.
Surviving kalpas or perishing,
born following qi.
Externally, the undifferentiated is congealed;
internally, the seven meridians are nourished.
The five spirits plant blossoms,
the Three Terraces spread glory.
The Purple Palace and White Youth
return the form to infancy.
Ascending clouds, riding mists aloft,
amidst them the Jade Perfected,
named Divine Lord.
To the left, embracing Non-Shadow;
to the right, guarded by White Origin.
The Dark Beast blocks behind,
the Vermilion Phoenix escorts ahead.
Above floats the emerald canopy,
below surges the golden lotus.
Fragrant clouds condense in the void,
sweet dew without end.
Used without exhaustion,
tracing the source without end.

*From the Jade Clarity Scripture.*

**Vermilion Mound Life-Conveying Heavenly Worthy**

Now that the hún and pò are revived,
they must transcend the celestial path.
Refine and transform their form,

with various hindrances.
Now we recite the *Sweet Dew Communicating with the Perfected Dharma Words*:

Recite the *Sweet Dew Communicating with the Perfected Dharma-Food Spell*:

faintly opens the dark barrier.

A thousand spirits, doubly harmonized,
ever dwell in the Twelve Towers.
Hastily proclaim the Numinous Treasure’s decree,
roam freely in the celestial paradise.

The Heavenly Worthy declares: This divine spell,
if the deceased has long been confined in hell,
unable to achieve liberation,
upon hearing this spell,
their throat and gullet will open,
without obstruction.
Naturally joyful,
food and drink sweet and fragrant.
Their mind turns toward rebirth,
cutting off afflictions and karma.

resting, dwelling in the mysterious chamber.
Hunger is sated with yellow coptis blossoms,
thirst quenched with jade-root nectar.
The spirit’s banner commands the great demons,
the body refined with true light.
Reflecting and illuminating the Great Non-Being,
ever roaming the void.
Perfect communion, wave-subduing deliverance,
true transformation without delay.
Subtle and wondrous, without beginning or end,
practitioners must clearly know.
Silent and serene, forgetting doctrine and teaching,
responding to the times, unfolding the grand rule.
The descending Dao does not reveal itself,
it must first be applied.
Converging in the non-dual place,
following the mind, naturally uniting or parting.

We have heard: In the primordial undifferentiated chaos, none were sundered from their ancestral roots;
When the True Writs shone forth, all divine spirits were universally established.
The Three Origins were ordained, governing all transformations.
Born into the human realm, they bathed their forms in the Great Yang.
Departing from their original true nature, they brought upon themselves decay and death.

Lofty and majestic, vast and boundless in virtue.
Granting that all may follow and uphold them, to deliver the hidden and dark.

The bureaus of the Law, the offices of immortals, the generals and clerks—
All preside over their domains, each observing the proper rites.
May they together exalt the mysterious wind, swiftly manifesting the divine transformations.
Dutifully following the Dao’s decree, opening the deliverance for the departed souls.
The six destinies and three paths, erased from the death registers of the Nether Bureau;
The three transformations and nine refinements, inscribed in the life rosters of the Heavenly Court.

May the gods graciously accept, fulfilling our earnest prayers.
In utmost reverence and supplication.

And reverently approach the presence of the August Emperor.

Receive the precepts and transmit the talismans,
Ascend to perfection and attain deliverance.

The assembly, with utmost sincerity, requests the procession of welcome and guidance.
Next, the assembly chants the hidden verses to lead the soul in audience.

Next, descend from the seat.

**The Twenty-Seventh Scroll of the** *Wu Shang Huang Lu Da Zhai Li Cheng Yi* **concludes.**

**The Twenty-Eighth Scroll of the** *Wu Shang Huang Lu Da Zhai Li Cheng Yi*
**Compiled by the Supreme Enforcer of the Dao, Immortal Officer Jiang Shuyu**

**Section on Rituals**
**Rite of the** *Ling Shi Da Zhai* **for Transmitting Precepts, Talismans, and Delivering the Departed Soul**

First, the ritual master instructs the family to part from the spirit. Next, the officiating Daoist invokes and summons the spirit, leading the banner to the place where the precepts are proclaimed. The assembly arranges itself in order. The Dharma Master approaches the seat, offers incense, and recites the incense prayer:

*"One stick of Dao-virtue incense,
May it penetrate the paths of the Three Realms.
May the Heavenly Worthy, in great compassion,
Proclaim the secret and wondrous words.
Deliver all departed souls,
That they may swiftly cross the Dharma Bridge.
May the nine depths’ wandering spirits,
Together escape the sufferings of the Three Wretched Paths."*

Today, the Dao altar is pure and serene. The assembly, with unified sincerity, dedicates this rite to the ritual sponsor, their countless ancestors, and the departed souls to be delivered. With wholehearted devotion, they reverently invoke the Three Treasures’ Imperial Master of the Jade Capital and Golden Towers—the Supreme, Boundless, Utmost True Great Dao—as well as the Ten Poles, Nine Heavens, and all the Great Saints of the celestial realms; the Three Origins, Four Beginnings, Four Offices, and Five Emperors of the sun, moon, stars, and celestial pivots; the deities of the divine realms, dark mountains, Yellow Springs, and the netherworld courts; the spirit officials and clerks of the Three Realms; and all responsive and efficacious numinous powers. May they bestow compassion, condescend to witness this rite, and affirm the merit of transmitting precepts and talismans, that the souls sunk in nine nights of darkness may attain the true fruit of the Three Vehicles.

The assembly recites the *Third Wisdom Hymn*. The Dharma Master expounds from the seat:

The wondrous precepts of the Cavernous Mystery, the numinous talismans of the Numinous Treasure—above, they safeguard the nation’s prosperity in peace; below, they deliver suffering souls from the kalpas of tribulation. Their prohibitions are most solemn, their divine power beyond thought. Today, before the Dao, we transmit them according to the ritual codes. Yet we fear the departed souls, long deluded by the true Dao, remain bound in the cycle of rebirth. First, we must broadly proclaim the Dharma’s teachings to illumine their inherent nature, that they may awaken, comprehend, and escape the dark paths.

As the scriptures state: All beings in the Three Realms are originally without transmigration. They are purely of the Dao’s qi, initially without birth or extinction, without enlightenment or delusion. The nature that hears and knows has never been divided. It has no beginning in coming, no end in going. All is the vast Brahma, without inside or outside. Yet all sentient beings, from the moment they take form and gain awareness, bind their senses to phenomena: forms to the eyes, sounds to the ears, fragrances to the nose, flavors to the tongue, perceptions to the mind, and desires to the body. Hunger drives them to eat, thirst to drink, cold to clothe themselves, heat to bare their skin. They fall into the snares of circumstances, drown in the dust of the senses, toil in cravings, and are fettered by clinging thoughts. Day by day, month by month, their evil roots remain unexhausted. The great wheel of birth and death never ceases for even a moment. Some are born in heaven, some among humans, some cast into hell, enduring all manner of suffering. After countless transformations, they have yet to attain liberation. They know not whence comes the superior condition of the Dao, nor from what the spirit, qi, essence, and blood arise. The arising and ceasing of life and nature—from where do they ultimately come? Even if one becomes a heavenly being with a lifespan of billions, without understanding the root of the Dao or recognizing the Utmost Truth, one’s long life is but fleeting, and one will again fall into decline. For this reason, the Lofty Perfected Kings of old revealed the pure, luminous, and supreme Dharma treasure, establishing the great teaching to universally deliver heavenly and human beings. Today, we proclaim it—listen carefully.

*Strike the chime once.*

In the past, our Primordial Heavenly Worthy, with his singular Dharma-body, nurtured the embryo of the Dao. Thereafter, the primordial vastness formed the void. After the void endured, existence arose, and thus all living beings suddenly came into being. Life originally had no substance; it arose from emptiness to form images. From images, shapes took form, and luminous consciousness came to dwell within. Falsely conceiving the notion of birth, once the idea of birth was established, they clung to delusion as the self. Turning away from awakening, they took clarity as their nature, and clarity became the opposite of darkness. As clarity and darkness contended, the forms of water and fire appeared. Thereupon, they divided into the Five Agents, assuming the five forms. They encroached upon and seized one another, flowing and transforming in turn. Wood became benevolence and love, fire became clarity and discernment, earth became sincerity and thickness, metal became resoluteness and decisiveness, and water became wisdom and calculation. Internally, they transformed into the five forms, becoming the five viscera. Externally, they solidified into the five views, collectively forming the six senses. Emotions and circumstances intertwined, layering into pairs. They lost the Primordial Chaos’ Scarlet Writ of the Utmost Supreme True and Wondrous Dao, mistaking the guest for the host, generating emotions that harmed their nature, and using knowledge to confuse the mind. Binding love as the root, binding thoughts as karma, they thus experienced manifold births, manifold extinctions, manifold karmic retributions, manifold causes and conditions, manifold heavenly joys, and manifold netherworld sufferings. In such delusion, they remained unaware. Birth and death, coming and going—endless kalpas passed without cease.

*Strike the chime once.*

Seated assembly, delivered souls—observe the worlds within heaven and earth, boundless and immeasurable. Heaven turns left, earth turns right, revolving south and north—who governs this motion? Without the Utmost Spirit, none could alter it. The spirit has no fixed form; it manifests in phenomena. Just as within the human body, the nature and life are concealed: when the corpse lies still, it seems lifeless. Yet when it rises to walk, speaks, or makes sounds, one knows the spirit’s transformations and the life’s nature, hidden yet revealed in movement. The Utmost Spirit is likewise. If the spirit did not exist, how could there be life and nature? Life and nature are but other names for the spirit. Within the human body, what is it, and what form does it take? If one identifies movement and activity as the spirit, then the dead should have no spirit. Yet the deceased may become malevolent spirits, their forms appearing as light and shadows. Or, years after death, they may suddenly possess the living—relatives or old acquaintances—recalling past events as if in life. Clearly, this spirit endures, never perishing. The spirit of life is unborn, and thus undying. It is one with the Dao, originating in transformation. It may dwell in heaven or enter hell. Though it may enjoy the two paths or suffer in hell—boiling cauldrons, blazing fires, endless kalpas of darkness, boundless torment—only the karmic consciousness, the sinful soul, and the corpse’s hun-soul and po-soul endure this retribution.

As for your primordial spirit, what glory or decay could it know?

Thus should you understand: The Supreme Primordial Origin, the Central Yellow True Dao, divided heaven and earth, established the laws of ruler and minister, and enfolded the numinous within the Great Void, where spirit transforms and gives birth. The vast emptiness bears no form, its nature unseen. Yet within it dwells the supreme spirit, alone directing its divine transformations. Though spirit admits no gaps, qi flows through myriad paths—rising and descending, parting into darkness and light. Once the two halves are formed, yin and yang are fixed. Yin and yang unite in virtue, and thus the root of life is established. The root flourishes, branches multiply, begetting offspring as seeds, each transforming in succession, none knowing the other. Should you seek to know it, understanding eludes you. To know is not the Dao; the Dao transcends all knowing.

Within the Three Realms, all that has life has not yet transcended yin and yang, nor severed the cycle of birth and death. Generation upon generation, change follows nature’s course. To seek the Dao through knowledge is to distance oneself from it ever further. Behold these boundless transformations of birth—all arise from the divine qi of the Great Void, wondrously generating and transforming. Observe your own body: it receives this primordial mandate, passing from kalpa to kalpa, shedding form after form, countless in number. Though life changes ten thousand times, that which makes you *you* has never truly shifted. It endures unbroken, from ancient times to the present, its Dao ceaseless.

Thus in my teaching, we recognize that emptiness is not mere inert void, but inwardly refines spirit and transformation. The Dao of life is unbroken—this is the root of the Way. Cultivate this to nurture life, and life shall know no end; apply this to all things, and all things shall know no limit in their harmonious stillness.

Disciples who receive the precepts, if you awaken to this profound truth, you shall perceive the true Dao, sever the roots of karma, and escape the path of rebirth. If you have not yet grasped this, I shall grant you the Three Refuges and expound the Nine True Precepts, to serve as your ladder and bridge.

Now, let this be proclaimed and revered. Let each chant with reverence:

We announce to the departed soul: First, take refuge in the unsurpassed Treasure of the Dao—the Three Supreme Ones of the Ten Directions, who deliver beings across kalpas and expound the teachings of primordial heaven. With boundless compassion, they universally save all living beings. Their jade countenances and golden visages manifest in myriad transformations, their shadows responding to echoes, their benevolent responses inexhaustible. In this life and all lives to come, hold them in faith and reverence.

*Chant the Hymn of the Dao-Treasure:*
Bow and take refuge in the Dao, the Primordial Lord of the Great Heaven.
May this Dao’s power open the way and deliver this departed soul.
*Together: Ascend to the realm of divine immortals.*

We announce to the departed soul: Second, take refuge in the unsurpassed Treasure of the Scriptures—the sacred texts of the Ten Directions, treasures of numinous writ, jade characters and golden script, dragon seals and phoenix glyphs, thirty-six divisions and eighteen thousand scrolls. They guide the lost to transcendence, erase transgressions and extinguish sins, enabling attainment of the Dao and perfection of the true. In this life and all lives to come, hold them in faith and reverence.

*Chant the Hymn of the Scripture-Treasure:*
Bow and take refuge in the Scriptures, the dragon-sealed phoenix-glyph texts.
May this Dharma’s power awaken and liberate this departed soul.
*Together: Ascend to the realm of divine immortals.*

We announce to the departed soul: Third, take refuge in the unsurpassed Treasure of the Masters—the Three Supreme Masters of the Numinous Treasure, the Orthodox Unity Perfected Ones, the Lords of the Three Heavens, the divine immortals of the Ten Directions who have attained the Dao. They transmit the Dharma and bestow the scriptures, opening the way for all beings. They are true parents, great physicians of the soul. In this life and all lives to come, hold them in faith and reverence.

*Chant the Hymn of the Master-Treasure:*
Bow and take refuge in the Masters, the compassionate ones of the Numinous Treasure.
May this spiritual power uplift and deliver this departed soul.
*Together: Ascend to the realm of divine immortals.*

All departed souls, having taken refuge in the unsurpassed, true Three Treasures, shall now be expounded the Nine Wondrous Precepts, to dissolve all suffering and ascend to the Nine Heavens. Listen and receive with single-minded devotion.

The Merciful Heavenly Worthy expounds the precepts:

First precept: Reverence and deference, filial piety and care for parents.
Second precept: Diligence and loyalty to one’s lord and sovereign.
Third precept: No killing; compassion and salvation for all beings.
Fourth precept: No licentiousness; rectify the body and conduct among all things.
Fifth precept: No theft; extend righteousness and diminish the self.
Sixth precept: No wrath; no cruelty or oppression of others.
Seventh precept: No deceit; no flattery or harm to the good.
Eighth precept: No arrogance; no contempt for the utmost truth.
Ninth precept: No duality; uphold the precepts with singular devotion.

These wondrous precepts were expounded by the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning from his golden mouth, universally eradicating the roots of all evil. Now, in accordance with the mysterious rites, they are transmitted before the sacred assembly. By the power of these Nine True Precepts, may you forever depart the calamities of the Five Sufferings, ascend to the Vermilion Palace, and transcend to the Purple Court.

We pray that the jade maidens attending the scriptures, the spirit youths guarding the precepts, the flying heavenly kings, and the mighty heavenly warriors descend throughout the boundless worlds of the Ten Directions and the Nine Dark Hells. May the Twenty-Four Bureaus and Thirty-Six Courts erase the name of the departed one, [so-and-so], from the black ledgers, dissolve the sins of the yin barriers, unlock the gates of eternal night, and point the way to the path of non-action. Within the Nine Empyrean Palaces, may they ever roam in feasting; amid the Eight Limitless Heavens, may they dwell in realms of carefree ease.

All golden registers and jade writs, sacred talismans and precious charms, are reverently presented before the Dao and proclaimed in due order.

Proclaim to the Master of the Talismans of Longevity at the Gate of Heaven’s Abode: may auspicious light burst forth, and propitious radiance dazzle the eyes.

Before the heart and gaze rise the Three Treasures Sovereigns of the Jade Capital and Golden Towers, enthroned in majesty, attended by an august retinue.

The Sovereigns command the Golden Lads and Jade Maidens to bear the talismans and writs, ride upon beams of golden light, descend from the Gate of Heaven, strike the writs against their teeth thrice, recite the dispersal incantation according to ritual, draw qi, and blow upon the talismans to seal them. Then, having proclaimed the texts in full, the writs are sealed.

**Ode to the Writ of Transcendence**
**Proclamation of the Precious Declarations of the Nine Heavens**
**Proclamation of the Golden Register of Longevity and Transcendence**

The master intones the prayer:
May the departed soul, upon receiving and upholding these, sever the bonds of earthly servitude, endure refinement, and be reborn. May they forever transcend the Three Wretched Paths, the Five Sufferings, and the Eight Perils; ascend beyond the Three Realms; and roam carefree in the Upper Clarity.

The incantation complete, the banner is raised.

After proclaiming the **Writ of Ascension to Heaven**, the master divides the writ in two. The right half is tied to the banner’s base, while the left half is sealed in an envelope according to ritual. The Merit Officer of the day is summoned to dispatch it.

The **Petition of Merit** is issued according to ritual, summoning the Flying Heavenly Kings of the Ten Directions. The master visualizes them as they depart, then intones:

We humbly recall that the Great Sage of Longevity, the Flying Heavenly Kings, heed the inner resonance of the Numinous Treasure and bear the charge of the Primordial Beginning. Heaven and humanity converge in assembly at the Upper Realm of the First Azure; mountains and peaks swallow mists in the initial kalpa of Crimson Clarity. Turning their light and wheeling their chariots, they oversee the deliverance of the true and the salvation of the living. We pray for your compassion, that you deign to descend and witness this rite. Bearing the Primordial Beginning’s writ of command, absolve the sinful souls of the Northern Capital. May the departed spirit [so-and-so] ascend and transcend in due time, be delivered by the reckoning of days, avoid the hells, and be clothed in radiance. May they wander freely beyond the Terrace of Kalpic Blades and forever dwell in the realm of blessed halls. We offer our most devout supplication.

In due order, the **Petition of Merit** is proclaimed, universally notifying the Three Realms and passing through the gates of all heavens. The earthly deities are commanded by the writ of the Primordial Beginning.

Upon completing the proclamation, a gold paper offering is burned.

The master intones:
We reverently invoke the Flying Heavenly Kings, the Flying Heavenly Envoys, and their divine hosts, just as in days of old, in the Celestial Assembly of Floating Radiance within the First Azure Heaven, they did not forget the teachings and admonitions of the Primordial Beginning. Look down upon the pious devotion of the ritual’s sponsor. May the departed spirit [so-and-so], their soul refined in death, be transformed into an immortal being. May their living form receive deliverance and endure through kalpas unending. May blessings extend to their descendants and grace their household. May all sentient beings together ascend the shore of the Dao.

**The Venerable One Who Delivers the Immeasurable**
The true scriptures and wondrous precepts, the jade writs and precious talismans, are the secret essences of the Three Caverns, expounding the supreme models of the Nine Heavens. They guide the lost to awakening and enable the realization of the Dao and attainment of perfection. Yet, fearing there may be no reliance or assurance to prevent hindrance to transcendence, we now, on behalf of the departed soul, invoke the assembly of sages in solemn covenant. We issue a **Certificate of Merit**, to be carried and cherished as a treasure of the self.

**Proclamation of the Certificate of Merit**
The proclamation complete, the master intones:
May the departed soul, holding this certificate as proof, forever erase their name from the ledgers of earthly tribunals, and may the nether courts no longer detain them. Between heaven and earth, may they transcend and transform according to their karma.

**Ode to the Northern Emperor**

All the preceding transmissions of precepts and talismans, and the manifold merits, are now complete. We humbly pray that, upon receiving and upholding these, the departed soul’s name be inscribed in the Purple Register and their rank elevated in the Vermilion Palace. May they don the Precious Declarations to pay homage to the Perfected, and bow before the August Sovereign to receive their destiny. May they attain the fruits of divine transcendence and reach the Land of Bliss.

Now, once more for the departed soul, we sever the Three Corpses and deliver the Five Households. May their form and spirit together attain perfection, merge with the Dao in truth, and ascend in due time. Let all take heed and cherish this.

The master performs the ritual, summoning the deities:
We solemnly summon the resplendent immortal hosts of the Jade Clarity and Numinous Treasure, the divine officials who eradicate the hells and the evil paths of the lower ghosts, the divine officials who eradicate the evil paths of beasts, the divine officials who deliver the Household of Form-Attachment, the Household of Love-Attachment, the Household of Greed-Attachment, the Household of Emotion-Attachment, and the Household of Desire-Attachment. We beseech you to attend before the Dao and reverently receive the writ of command. On behalf of the departed soul [so-and-so], in accordance with the statutes of the Supreme Perfected, sever the roots of the corpse. May the Three Evil Paths be extinguished, the burdens of karma delivered, the Five Paths opened, and the blades of the wind transcended. May they ascend to the Heavenly Courts, their form dissolved and transformed, their luminous essence flowing into the Upper Clarity. The jade writ of the Primordial Beginning shall now be proclaimed.

**Proclamation of the Writ of Command for the Three Wretched Paths and Five Sufferings**
After each writ is proclaimed, paper money is burned beneath the banner.

May the roots of evil be severed, sparing them from drifting and sinking in the Five Paths. May the burdens of suffering be dispelled, enabling them to transcend the purity of the Six Dusts.

The Demon Kings shall supervise and escort, unhindered at the Gates of Heaven. Once more, the Immortal Lads are invoked to jointly guide and lead.

**Inviting the Five Directional Lads**
We reverently invite the Azure Spirit Dao-Opening Lad of the East, who holds a blue lotus, to receive and guide this departed soul, harmonizing their rebirth in the Immortal Realm.

We reverently invite the Vermilion Spirit Dao-Opening Lad of the South, who holds a red lotus, to receive and guide this departed soul, harmonizing their rebirth in the Immortal Realm.

We reverently invite the Primordial Spirit Dao-Opening Lad of the Center, who holds a yellow lotus, to receive and guide this departed soul, harmonizing their rebirth in the Immortal Realm.

We reverently invite the Radiant Spirit Dao-Opening Lad of the West, who holds a white lotus, to receive and guide this departed soul, harmonizing their rebirth in the Immortal Realm.

We reverently invite the Mystic Spirit Dao-Opening Lad of the North, who holds a jade lotus, to receive and guide this departed soul, harmonizing their rebirth in the Immortal Realm.

The Ten Poles’ divine realm shall swiftly expunge their name from the ledger of sins; the Five Spirit Lads shall ensure their immortal journey knows no delay. They shall roam the azure heavens, repose in halls of purity, personally attend the Primordial Beginning, and chant the hymns of the Grottoes. Never to fall into the cycle of rebirth, they shall forever follow the mysterious and wondrous Dao.

Let all be reverent and solemn, giving thanks for Heaven’s grace. Bowing in devotion, they take refuge in the Boundless Great Dao.

The Carefree and Joyous Heavenly Worthy leads the soul before the Great Dao, where the Dharma Master guides the departed to give thanks together.

In life, they endured the suffering of form and the retribution of rebirth. By the radiant grace of the Sagely Ones, compassion and expedient means were bestowed. Through the measured postures of dignity, the souls lost in the darkest night are delivered.

The departed soul [so-and-so], by virtue of this offering of the fast, gains access to the altar’s steps, hears the scriptures, and listens to the Dharma, thereby washing away sins and erasing transgressions. Their essence has already been cleansed in the Yellow Flower, their form refined in the Flowing Fire. They receive talismans and precepts, transformed and reborn anew. By the diligent descent of the True Chariots, even the dead shall be delivered.

The great virtue of Heaven and Earth—who can repay such boundless grace? Though the sincerity of an ant is small, it must recognize the source of life’s blessings. The departed soul [so-and-so] bows in gratitude to Heaven’s grace, prostrating twice in reverence.

The Register of Souls is raised, and the soul is led to the burning site. The Dharma Master performs the *huixiang*, giving thanks for the deliverance.

Your servant reverently establishes the jade altar and proclaims the precious rites. Humbly beseeching the True Creation, may the departed soul be delivered.

With this rite’s merit now complete and the affairs of the living and the dead concluded, I fear my ignorance of the statutes and any breach of dignity. Should I be examined by the Three Officials and my transgressions recorded in the Nine Bureaus, I dare to hope for your grace and pardon. May the cloud chariots return to the Jade Capital, the feathered canopies ascend once more to the Crimson Palace. My heart races toward the Pure Han, my thoughts fixed upon the layered heavens. I further implore your vast kindness to bestow wondrous blessings. May all directions know peace, and the Great Dao flourish. May all sentient beings attain the wondrous fruit.

Your servant, unable to contain his longing gaze toward the Sagely and True, offers this plea for forgiveness and grace.

The Dharma Master performs three bows and exits, proceeding to the burning site to conduct the rites. He summons the Golden Dragon Courier Officers, reads the *guanzi*, and issues the Talisman of Longevity.

The Heavenly Worthy of the Great Crossing leads the soul across the bridge.

**Proclamation of the Dharani for Ascending the Dharma Bridge**
By the wisdom of the Heavenly Worthies and the compassion of the Great Dao, the ninefold yang *qi* transforms into a curved rainbow. A thousand *zhang* of long rainbows, myriad layers of gold and jade. Below, it enters the Realm of Opening Light; above, it ascends the Crimson Mound. The Dharma Bridge delivers all, universally saving the boundless. From the earth, they ascend to the heavens, proceeding directly to the Gates of Heaven. Let each refine their form and dignity, step upon the bridge, and ascend into the void. Their old intentions washed away, they shall endure for eternal kalpas.

The soul is sent forth as the *Three Clarities* hymn is chanted, and the talismans, registers, scriptures, banners, and spirit money are burned.

**Recitation of the Burning Register Hymn and Performance of the Deliverance Rite**
The Dharma Master silently intones:
May the soul’s spirit be pure and upright, their *qi* enduring forever. Unafflicted by suffering, their body radiant with light. Merit complete and virtue perfected, they roam carefree in the Upper Clarity.

After the incantation, he silently recites the Transformation and Rebirth Dharani:
*Xingsheng, Dulì, Kehán, Jùhún, Gōngdū, Jùhún. Swiftly, as the Emperor commands!*

**Silent Recitation of the Transformation Register Dharani**
The fire bells blaze fiercely in the eight directions. Myriad spirits stand guard, forever severing misfortune. Swiftly, as the Cinnabar Heaven Fire Bells command!

He visualizes the fire bells filling the earth, blazing like the sun, spanning heaven and earth. The delivered soul rides the golden light and ascends to heaven.

**Proclamation of the Universal Deliverance and Offering Dharani**
By the merit of the Numinous Treasure, the boundless deliverance of beings. The Primordial Beginning’s writ of command releases and pardons the roots of sin. Longevity returns to the corpse, the ninefold refinement revives the form. The wondrous precepts guard against wrongdoing, transcending the Three Realms. Through kalpas of turning, they roam carefree in the Upper Clarity. Merit complete and fruit fulfilled, they ascend to attend the Emperor Lord. Blessings flow to descendants, joy extends to the household.

Go well, go well! Do not forget the grace of the Dao.

The Heavenly Worthy of the Perfect Lotus concludes the deliverance. The immeasurable merit of the preceding rites is now complete.

Relying upon the pure assembly, for the sake of the superior conditions, we recite the great sagely Primordial Heavenly Worthy, the Most High Lord of the Great Dao, the Most High Lord Lao, the Heavenly Worthy of Great Compassion and Salvation, the Heavenly Worthies of Salvation in the Ten Directions, the Heavenly Worthy of Deliverance from the Nine Dark Realms, the Heavenly Worthy of the Crimson Mound’s Life-Deliverance, the Heavenly Worthy of the Great Crossing Dharma Bridge, the Heavenly Worthy of the Cinnabar Realm’s Fire Refinement, the Heavenly Worthy of the Golden Palace’s Transformation, the Heavenly Worthy of the Wheel-Turning Sagely King, the Heavenly Worthy of Rebirth According to Wish, the Carefree and Joyous Heavenly Worthy, the True Person of Great Compassion and Salvation, the True Person of Great Compassion and Great Wisdom, the True Person of Great Compassion and Sin-Deliverance, the True Person of Great Compassion and Deliverance—unfathomable merit.

For the sake of the fast’s patron, merit complete and virtue perfected. Gathering blessings and dispelling calamities, we recite the Heavenly Worthy of Purple Clarity’s Blessings, the Heavenly Worthy of Disaster-Dispelling and Misfortune-Resolving, the Heavenly Worthy of Longevity and Life-Extension, the Heavenly Worthy of Boundless Blessings, the Heavenly Worthy of the Eight Trigrams’ Protection, the Heavenly Worthy of the Nine Palaces’ Calamity-Aversion, the Heavenly Worthy of the Perfect Lotus—unfathomable merit.

The rites for delivering souls in this world include the *Rite of Severing the Three Corpses* and the *Rite of Crossing the Five Gates of Suffering*, as originally recorded in the *Primordial Registers of the Supreme Clarity Grotto-Real Department* from the *Jade Instructions of the Supreme Perfected*.

Those who study the supreme methods must first dispel all desires. Eradicating the roots of evil, the Dao naturally descends, and immortality naturally manifests. When inscribing the transforming luminous talismans, let the jade script of flowing radiance be employed according to the text. The talisman for delivering beings from the Three Wretched Realms and Five Sufferings is the Upper Corpse Talisman, inscribed in azure on dark silk. The Middle Corpse Talisman is inscribed in yellow on white silk. The Lower Corpse Talisman is inscribed in white on white silk. The talisman for the Gate of Color-Entanglement is inscribed in black on white silk. The Gate of Love-Entanglement is inscribed in white on white silk. The Gate of Greed-Entanglement is inscribed in red on white silk. The Gate of Florid Competition is inscribed in azure on white silk. The Gate of Bodily Entanglement is inscribed in yellow on white silk.

When severing the Upper Corpse Talisman, the disciple places it upon the head; the Middle Corpse Talisman upon the heart; and the Lower Corpse Talisman along with the Five Sufferings Talismans upon both feet. At the threshold of the Three Evil Gates, facing north, the disciple holds a blade in the mouth and presents a cup of pure water, bowing the face over it. The master stands behind the disciple, strikes the teeth nine times, and recites the incantation. In the worldly rites, these are the three incantations for the Upper Corpse’s Azure Desire, the Middle Corpse’s Peng Zhi, and the Lower Corpse’s Peng Jiao. For each gate delivered, the master takes the blade held in the disciple’s mouth and circles the disciple’s head nine times. The master then takes the rolled jade talisman, buries it beneath the gate, pours water over it, and departs. The Five Sufferings Gates follow the same procedure as the original scripture, without incantations.

Now, in receiving the Supreme Clarity Precious Register at the ancestral altar, this becomes the Most High Talismanic Method. Though it is said that spiritual transformation is boundless and that salvation in life may also deliver the dead, the incantations for severing the Three Corpses, when applied to the deceased, may yet encounter obstacles. Moreover, the ritual texts are exceedingly vulgar, and so they have been excised here. The eradication of the Three Evils and the aerial deliverance of the Five Household Spirit-Officials belong to the Great Rites of Jade Clarity and Numinous Treasure, to be summoned and descended according to the oral instructions. If the present purpose is to transmit talismanic commands and deliver the souls of the dead, then such practices are theoretically permissible.

Furthermore, the worldly rites’ Five Suffering Hells do not align with the scriptural names. Often, following the *Scripture on the Three Wretched Realms and Five Sufferings*, they describe the Five Sufferings as the Mountain of Swords, the Forest of Blades, the Bronze Pillars, the Cauldrons of Boiling Oil, and the Endless Tides of the Dark Sea—terms forcibly adapted into the rites. However, since the Three Evil Gates, Five Paths Gates, and Flowing Radiance Jade Talismans derive from the *Jade Instructions of the Supreme Perfected*, they ought to be performed strictly according to the scriptural texts to achieve perfection. The Five Sufferings Wheel Lamps follow the same principle.

Beginning Scroll Twenty-Nine of the *Complete Rites for the Supreme Yellow Register Great Retreat*.

The *Ritual for Refining and Delivering the Suffering Souls with Offerings*, compiled by the Celestial Enforcer of the Most High, Immortal Jiang Shuyu.

First, at the site of refinement or before the Great Dao, arrange the ritual banquet in thirty-six or twenty-four divisions. Once all is prepared, the Daoist assembly and officiants invite the Dharma Master to proceed.

**Purification**
**Offering of Incense**
**Hymn of Burning Incense**

The Dharma Master addresses the deities, declaring:

*"Your subordinate, [Name], in full ritual vestments, now kindles incense and reverently petitions the Jade Clarity of the Great Luo, the Boundless and Supreme Perfected Great Dao, the Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning; the Most High Lord of the Great Dao; the Most High Lord Lao; the Great Emperor of the Purple Tenuity of the North Pole; the Great Emperor of Longevity of the South Pole; the Great Emperor of the Vermilion Mound; the Heavenly Venerable of Salvation through the Great Unity; the Great Emperor of the Nine Heavens Who Gives Birth to the Spirits; the Twenty-Two Heavenly Lords; Lord Donghua of the East and Queen Mother of the West; the True Lords Who Protect the Hun and Attend the Po, Nourish the Qi and Circulate the Blood, and Govern the Central Five Emperors; the Lords of the Sun and Moon; the Seven Primordial Lords of the Northern Dipper; the Six Administrative Lords of the Southern Dipper; the Five Master Lords of the Numinous Treasure; the True Governors of the Three Ministries and Five Bureaus; the Great Lord of Longevity of the Southern Prosperity Upper Palace, Lord Han Jun Sima; the Lord Who Restores the Body and Raises the Dead; the Lord Who Delivers the Innumerable; the True Lord Who Delivers Lives and Perfects Immortality; the Nine Perfected of the Southern Pole; the Dharma Master of the Primordial Beginning of Jade Clarity; the Left Immortal Duke of the Great Ultimate; the True Lords Who Govern the Five Marchmounts; the True Governors of the Southern Prosperity Pivot Bureau, the Vermilion Mound Fire Bureau, and the Yellow Register of the Southern Prosperity Upper Palace; the Immortal Officials of the Numinous Treasure, the Lords and Officers of Pursuit, Seizure, and Refinement; the Great Emperor of Fengdu of the Northern Darkness; the Sage Emperors of the Five Marchmounts; the Great Emperor of Fusang of the Water Palace; the Venerable Deity of the Year’s Virtue; the Earth God and City God; the Earth Gods of the Five Paths; and all the numinous powers responsive to the Three Realms.*

*I have heard that the teachings unfold from the Purple Clarity, opening the Eight Gates to deliver and save; the scriptures transmit from the Azure Empyrean, proclaiming the Nine Refinements to restore life."*

For all those sunk in suffering, to relieve every affliction.
To wash away the filth of sin, to refine and transform the realms of rebirth.

This humble servant, unworthy and dull, has presumptuously received the transmission of the supreme Dharma. Though my person has been carelessly entrusted with the office of deliverance, my duty dares not falter in proclamation and transcription. Now, on behalf of the patron of this retreat, [Name], who properly dedicates this offering for the departed kin [Name], and universally dedicates it for all assembled souls, we establish the Supreme Yellow Register Great Retreat for three days and nights. Universally we set forth the Pure and Unobstructed Night Retreat for the Nine Springs and Six Paths, to protect and deliver the numinous forms, and to ascend them to the realms of the Dao.

Here we prepare the offerings of water-plants and fern, though our sincerity falls short of the otter’s sacrifice. We humbly beseech the Perfected Sages to oversee, the Immortal Spirits to descend in presence. May your radiant chariots turn back, and the great bounty of Heaven’s grace be abundantly bestowed. Deign to bestow your majestic light, to oversee and refine. This servant and the retreat officers [Names] cannot but reverently entreat, gazing upward in hope of your gracious illumination.

With reverence, we bow twice and offer incense to summon the Perfected.

This servant, occupying the dharma-position, [Name], with awe and trepidation, bows twice in reverence. We respectfully invite the Supreme Perfected Three Treasures, the Highest Divinity; the Northern Culmen, the Great Emperor of Purple Tenuity; the Southern Culmen, the Great Emperor of Longevity; the Great Emperor of Vermilion Mound; the Heavenly Worthy of Great Unity Who Saves from Suffering.

We humbly hope for the compassion of Heaven, that it may respond and divide its radiance, bestowing mercy and descending to witness.

We respectfully invite the Nine Heavens’ Spontaneously Generated Life-Spirit Highest Divinities; the Five Venerables and Five Emperor Lords; the Thirty-Two Heavenly Emperor Lords; the Lord of Wood and the Queen Mother of Metal; the Lords of the Sun and Moon; the Seven Primordial Star Lords of the Northern Dipper; the Six Bureau Star Lords of the Southern Dipper; the Five Masters of the Numinous Treasure; the Four Sage Perfected Lords; the Perfected Lords of the Three Ministries and Five Bureaus; the Dharma Master of the Primordial Beginning; the Left Immortal Duke of the Supreme Ultimate; the Great Lord of Longevity of the Southern Prosperity Upper Palace; the Lord of the Vermilion Mound Fire Bureau; the Lord Who Delivers Life of the Southern Palace; the Controller of Horses, Lord Han; the Perfected Lord of Refinement and Immortal Transcendence; the Ninefold Florescence Perfected of the Southern Culmen; the Great Divinity Who Oversees the Resurrection of the Dead; the Flying Heavenly Immortals; the Perfected Lords Who Govern the Five Marchmounts; the True Governors of the Southern Prosperity Pivot Bureau, the Vermilion Mound Fire Bureau, and the Yellow Register of the Southern Prosperity Upper Palace; the Great Emperor of the Northern Darkness of Fengdu; the Sage Emperors of the Five Marchmounts; the Great Emperor of Fusang of the Water Palace.

We humbly hope for the sagely compassion to bestow your light and descend.

We respectfully invite the Perfected Lord of the Numinous Treasure, the Spontaneously Generated and Perfectly True, Who Universally Delivers Beings; the Great Generals of the Left and Right of the Cinnabar Heaven; the Heavenly Generals and Great Divinities of the Numinous Treasure’s Radiant and Majestic Immortal Bureaus; the Perfected Officials and Immortal Clerks of the Nine Refinements; the Great Generals of the Twelve Qi Transformations of the Primordial Unity; the Attendants of the Southern Prosperity’s Water and Fire Pools; the Great Generals Who Govern Water and Fire; the Various Attendants Who Gather the Flying Primordials; the Great Generals of the Six Jia and Six Ding; the Golden Lads and Jade Maidens; the Fire Bell Immortal Lads; the Nine Radiance Lads; the Yellow Flower Jade Maidens; the Jade Maidens of the Eastern Well; the Perfected of Refinement; the Attendants of Refinement; the Divine Generals of Refinement; the Merit Officers of Refinement; the Presiding and Executive Officials of the Refinement Assembly; the Three Divisions of Divine Tiger Great Sage Jade Maidens and Pursuit Attendants; the Clerks and Soldiers of Pursuit and Seizure; the Great Sage Heavenly Physicians; the Six Bureau Governance Officials and Generals; the Merit Officers, Presiding Officers, and Dharma Register Governance Perfected Officials and Their Retinues; the Venerable Deity of the Year’s Virtue; the Direct Attendants of the Three Realms; the Seven Path Merit Officers; the Earth God and City God; the Earth Gods of the Five Paths; the Lads Who Open the Dao; the Divine Lords of Prohibitions; the Officers of Earth and Water; the Officials Who Guide the Good; the Void-Space Overseers; and all the numinous powers.

We humbly hope for the sagely compassion that all the officials may descend in full attendance.

We offer incense and make the initial presentation.

This servant respectfully addresses the Three Clarities, the Highest Divinities; the Compassionate Honored One of Great Unity; and the host of sages of the Three Realms and Ten Directions.

We have heard that when the primordial qi first divided, yin and yang established their positions. The Three Origins guided nurturance, and the myriad beings took form. All who dwell within the sheltering and nourishing cosmos rely upon the virtue of generation and completion. Habits lead to differing fruits, and karmic retribution follows distinct paths. Until the illusory dust is eradicated, one continues to revolve in the path of suffering. Without cultivating contemplative practice, it is difficult to escape the mechanisms of transformation. The lofty and numinous sagely beings, in their compassion, reach out to creatures. They expound the subtle and wondrous Dharma, opening the gates of skillful means. They cleanse the yin impurities with yellow blossoms and refine the yang essence in flowing fire. Thus may all attain the marvels of the Dao, forever securing the root of life.

Now, the patron of this retreat, [Name], has reverently performed the retreat rites to deliver the departed spirits. Universally, for those sunk in darkness, we proclaim and perform the refinements. We humbly beseech the descent of Heaven’s light and the widespread flow of its beneficent moisture. May the Perfected Spirits be commanded to follow the talismanic decrees. May they divide their forms and descend their qi, refining the luminous and seizing life. Thus may the delivered souls, boundless and clear, be received. May the five spirits merge and harmonize, cutting off the roots of the five afflictions; may the one nature long endure, attaining the true fruit of the one vehicle. May they be enabled to reach the shore of non-action and forever purify the conditions of defilement.

We cannot but earnestly pray to this effect.

We offer incense and make the second presentation.

We address the officials, generals, and clerks of the Numinous Treasure Refinement; all those who assemble in response; and all the numinous powers.

We have heard that the Primordial Beginning opened the chart and divided his body to descend and transform. The August Jade Emperor governed the course and established the Dharma to deliver beings. In their kindness, they aid those sunk in suffering, providing a bridge across life and death. The direct attendants and guardian clerks serve the numinous scriptures. The Dharma bureaus and immortal offices assist in propagating the victorious models. They should together expand the wondrous transformations, greatly illuminating the imperial Dao. Charged with the mandate to proclaim grace, they act in accordance with the rites. Above, they follow the decrees of the Dao; below, they deliver the sunken souls. They accomplish the work of refining the embryo and returning to the root, manifesting the virtue of the Perfected who oversee and deliver life. May evil conditions be severed forever, and the long night’s icy pools be left behind; may the true qi fill and flourish, ascending directly to the realms of cinnabar blossoms and fire bells.

May the divinities graciously accept and respond to our sincere prayers.

The Three Divisions of Divine Tiger Pursuit Attendants, the Merit Officers of the Heavenly, Human, Earthly, Immortal, Ghostly, and Karmic Paths, are invited to arrive before the Dao and receive the written decree.

We offer incense and make the final presentation.

We proclaim the writ and present the memorial.

The sincerity of our supplications has now been fully expressed. We humbly gauge the true wisdom of the Perfected and trust that it penetrates all with clear discernment. Though the dusty world is defiled and impure, and our offerings flawed and meager, we pray that our humble and insignificant efforts not be faulted, but rather graciously pardoned.

May the refining and delivering immortal officials, the pursuing and seizing divine lords, the revered deities of the Great Year, and the city gods and local earth spirits each adhere to the great teachings and widely spread the winds of compassion. May they open the gates of darkness, summon the hidden souls, and at the time of the universal summons before this altar, marshal and guard all spirits to receive deliverance according to the rites. We await their manifest response and urgently command their compliance.

**Return and Offering** – Burn and consume according to the ritual.

**Rite of the Five Upper Clarity Bureaus for Summoning Hidden Souls, Restoring Their Complete Forms, Ascending Through Deliverance, and Returning to Spirit to Recover Their Nature**

First, face the Ghost Gate and arrange the incense table. Next, the ritual master performs the **Breaking Darkness and Opening the Path** method: he burns incense, stands upright, recites the **Purification of Heaven and Earth Mantra** once, and blows toward the four directions. He visualizes the **True Official of the Nine Phoenixes for Breaking Defilement**—crimson-robed, wearing a black headscarf, riding a nine-headed vermilion phoenix—who spews fire before him, flames blazing across his body.

Next, he paces the **Nine Phoenixes Breaking Defilement Stance**, circling his body three times. He visualizes himself within the flames, transforming into the **Nine Radiance Perfected**, the fire stretching between heaven and earth, its light illuminating the ten directions. After a long while, he envisions the **Celestial Worthy of Original Beginning** leading the great sages, supreme perfected, and boundless celestial true ones of the ten directions, seated at the center of a circular halo, bowing nine times.

**Secret Mantra:**
*The Celestial Worthy of Original Beginning summons the great celestial deities, the supreme perfected, and the wonderfully accomplished true ones. They turn their radiance and return their chariots to oversee the deliverance of life.*

He bows three times in his heart.

**The Ritual Master’s Incense Prayer:**
Your subordinate, [Name], humbly burns incense and respectfully memorializes the Three Clarities and Three Realms, the August Ones of the Golden Towers, the Celestial Worthy of Great Compassion of the Eastern Ultimate Palace who responds to cries and attends to suffering, the Heavenly Worthies of Numinous Treasure of the Ten Directions, the true administrators of the Three Realms, and the sovereigns of the Ten Directions.

By virtue of past causes, I have presumptuously transmitted the supreme methods. My merits fall short by the slightest measure, while my transgressions accumulate like mountains. I tread the earth in trembling fear and gaze upon heaven with quaking awe. I hope to broadly proclaim the wondrous teachings and thereby universally deliver those sunk in darkness. Having pledged my devotion, I dare not fail to make this declaration.

For the present rite, I, the humble sponsor [Name], now universally offer the supreme Yellow Register Grand Fast on behalf of the departed kin [Name] and all souls gathered in assembly—extending also to the six destinies and four births, the orphaned spirits and stagnant souls. In accordance with the true statutes, I proclaim and perform the refining and deliverance.

Having already memorialized the intent of the fast and notified the true administrators, summoned the numinous attendants to descend and attend the Dharma assembly, I yet fear that those in darkness and light, separated by different paths, may remain sunk in oblivion, unable to behold the radiant light or partake in liberation. I humbly beseech that a special Dao decree be issued, commanding the Lord of the Southern Cinnabar Heaven Fire Mansion to illuminate with yang brilliance, open the obstructed roads, dispel the shadows of yin, and guide them to the Mysterious Altar.

Dare I not purify my thoughts and settle my mind, reverently praying for response?

The Dharma Master strikes his teeth three times and bows thrice in his heart.
Holding the *Talisman for Opening the Roads*, he recites the esoteric incantation:

*"The Primordial Beginning summons and guides,
The great gods of heaven and true perfected ones.
August and exalted, the perfected of wondrous conduct.
The boundless ten directions, the supreme true gods.
Turn your radiance and return your carriage,
Oversee the true and deliver the living.
The chancellors of all heavens, the Southern Palace of Supreme Prosperity.
Han, the registrar and overseer of life, the great god of monitoring existence.
Holding the registers and grasping the records, all assemble before the Emperor.
As each is to be delivered, strictly examine the heavens.
Universally proclaim to the Three Realms and the boundless divine lands.
The subterranean courts, the Northern Capital of Fengdu.
The Three Offices and Nine Bureaus, the Twelve River Sources.
Liberate ancestors and parents through countless kalpas.
Swiftly erase the ledgers of transgressions, eradicate the roots of evil.
Do not detain or coerce them into ghostly throngs.
By the Primordial Beginning’s talismanic command, ascend without delay at this very moment.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the statutes of the Great Emperor of Longevity decree!"*

Recited thrice, he draws a breath of qi from the Gate of Heaven and blows it upon the talisman.
With mudras formed and fingers pressed, he burns the *Talisman for Opening the Roads* at the Ghost Gate.
He then recites:

*"By the Primordial Beginning’s talismanic command, ascend without delay at this very moment.
The cold pools of the Northern Capital, the guardians of form and soul.
Subdue demons and protect the summoned, deliver them to the Southern Palace.
Let the dead souls undergo refinement and be transformed into immortals.
Let the living receive deliverance and endure through kalpas.
Through cycles of kalpas, their years shall equal heaven’s.
Forever delivered from the three paths and the five sufferings, eight hardships.
Transcending the Three Realms, they wander freely in the Supreme Clarity."*

The Dharma Master offers incense and prays again:

*"Now, as I burn this incense, I reverently invite the Lords of the Han Mansion, the Duli Mansion, the Xingsheng Mansion, the Gongdu Mansion, the Juhun Mansion, the Registrars of Life and Destiny, the Administrators of Merit and Execution, and all divine lords.
I now execute the talismanic command for refinement and deliverance, summoning the six destinies, four births, orphaned spirits, and stagnant souls. Having already notified the true administrators and secured this moment, I compel them to hasten here and attend the altar for deliverance. Yet I fear the underworld paths may remain obstructed, preventing full illumination. By the Emperor’s decree, I summon the Great General of the Southern Dipper’s Fire Chime to swiftly fly the fire chime, illuminating all directions without bound, penetrating the deepest darkness—all as commanded. Step the Fire Chime Pace, execute the Fire Chime Mudra, and visualize six Fire Chimes taking flight."*

He burns the *Flying Talisman of the Great One* and prays:

*"Before the wondrous Dao, all was undifferentiated and formless.
The Three Names divided, giving rise to the Nine Qi;
The One Primordial separated, initiating the Three Powers.
The pure ascended and the turbid congealed—thus heaven and earth took their places.
The minute and vast dispersed and differentiated—thus the myriad beings were complete.
Qi’s origin is without form, yet humans are the most numinous.
Good and evil first arise in the one mind; retribution thus cycles through the six destinies.
Some are born in the heavenly path, some among humans,
Some dwell in the gates of the spirit path, some endure the sufferings of hell,
Some incur the retribution of hungry ghosts, some abide among beasts.
Once fallen into the wheel of rebirth, escape is not easily won.
Even to the farthest reaches of the empty void, the accumulated darkness of the cold realms,
The orphaned souls without offerings, the stagnant souls unable to ascend,
Constantly burning with the fires of hunger, forever cut off from yang’s light.
Before their evil roots are eradicated, they merely drift upon the sea of suffering.
Yet the Most High, deeply moved by compassion,
Deems all sentient beings to share the ancestral qi of the Primordial Beginning.
Thus, in boundless vastness, he plants the great virtue of cherishing life.
Broadly proclaiming essential methods, he makes boats for humanity.
Universally delivering sentient beings, he constructs ladders for the Dharma.
Manifesting a hundred thousand auspicious marks, he opens the twelve gates of vows.
Here he spreads the statutes for delivering the dead, using them to open the path to transcendence.
Let the dead souls undergo refinement and be transformed into immortals.
Erase transgressions, remove faults, rescue from hardship, and relieve suffering.
Gather all good benefits—beyond conception.
Today, I reverently initiate the jade statutes, proclaiming the precious models.
I set forth the Dharma food, chanting the cavernous hymns.
Auspiciously opening the five gates to transfer the spirits,
I earnestly invite the assembled perfected to oversee the deliverance.
Relying on the power of the Dao, may they come to the numinous altar,
Receive the causes of all wondrous blessings, and forever escape the sufferings of rebirth.
Having long entrusted this to the divine generals, I now notify all relevant bureaus.
Let none remain sunk in darkness—come forth and follow the guidance!"*

He reverently invites the Divine Tiger Envoys, the Generals for Summoning and Seizing Souls, the Three Yuan Generals, the Venerable Deities of the Year’s Virtue, the Seven Dao Merit Officers, and the Six Jia Envoys to swiftly assemble in accordance with the statutes and escort them to the numinous altar.
Having prepared the official proclamation, he now solemnly declares it.

He recites the *Universal Summons* and burns it.
The Dharma Master performs the rites, burning the *Talisman of the Great General for Summoning Souls*.
He recites the esoteric incantation:

*"By the Numinous Treasure’s talismanic command,
Deliver the six destinies, four births, orphaned spirits, and stagnant souls.
Escape the hells, forever part from eternal night.
The five sufferings and three paths—do not detain them.
Coerce them no longer into ghostly throngs, sever their dead names.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the statutes of the Great Emperor of Longevity decree!"*

Drawing qi from the Gate of Heaven, he blows it upon the talisman and burns it.

**Summoning the Generals and Officers for Pursuit and Seizure**

He reverently summons:
The Great Dharma Bureau of Numinous Treasure,
The Southern Palace of Supreme Prosperity,
The Southern Mausoleum Pivot Mansion,
The Vermilion Mound Fire Mansion,
The Immortal Officers and Heavenly Generals of the Refining and Deliverance,
The Divine Tiger Envoys of the Three Departments for Pursuing Souls,
The Merit Officers of Heaven, Earth, Immortals, Humans, Ghosts, and the Karmic Path,
The Administrators of Earth and Water,
The City Gods and Earth Lords,
The Attendant Officers and Guardians,
The Underworld’s Chief Officers of Wandering Souls.

*"Hear now this summons! Swiftly take charge and escort the six destinies, four births, orphaned spirits, and stagnant souls to the altar for transfer!"*

**Further Commanding the Restraint of Wayward Spirits**

It is further decreed: restrain the raving souls and frenzied spirits, rectify their forms and spirits, and conduct yourselves with virtue at the altar precincts. You shall not, on account of this occasion, seek vengeance or redress grievances, nor encroach upon the living. The dark statutes shine forth—all must comply. Should any dare transgress, their offenses shall not be pardoned.

The officiating Daoist, holding the banner, summons and gathers:
With wholehearted devotion, we invoke and beseech the boundless realms of the ten directions, the farthest reaches of the mysterious void, the suffering multitudes of the limitless, all the sunken and obscured, the six destinies and four births, the orphaned spirits and stagnant souls. May they, by the power of the Three Treasures, arrive this very night, this very hour, to attend the Dharma assembly and partake in these deliverance merits.

*Chanting the Yellow Chapter*
The Great Tenuous Banner of the Supreme Yellow,
The Numinous Pennant of the Peerless commands.
Summoning the long-night abode,
Delivering and receiving the reborn souls.
*And the inconceivable merits.*

The master forms the mudra of summoning and restraint, silently reciting the true secret names. Following the names, the mudras are formed, and the master recites the invocation aloud:

*"Radiant Womb, Obscure Essence, the Three Hun of the Luminous Spirit—return to emptiness, return to truth. The true qi of Heaven and Earth, gather once more to reconstitute your form and spirit. This is the true work of the Five Agents’ transformation—nowhere to hide, nowhere to flee, nowhere to escape your form!"*
*Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the Emperor’s decree!*

*Further invocation:*
*"The Three Officials of the Northern Feng, inspecting the ghost encampments—no concealment shall be tolerated; report at the Golden Horse Post. Proclaimed universally, all spirits heed: the Five Emperors of the Three Realms shall present their accounts on high!"*
*Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the Emperor’s decree!*

The master draws qi from the northeast, blows it upon the banner’s left eye three times, and visualizes the assembly of millions of ghostly souls beneath the altar.

*Next incantation:*
*"Spirits, clarify and rectify! May the ten thousand qi endure forever. Spare them from suffering and affliction; let their bodies shine with light. Restore their original forms, restore their original spirits!"*
*Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the Decree of the Great Emperor of Longevity!*

The incantation is silently recited three times, and qi from the east is drawn and blown upon them.

The Dharma Master ascends the seat, and the Daoist assembly chants the central liturgy, guiding the wandering souls to prostrate before the seat.

The Dharma Master intones...

Now, by the supreme power of the Dao, the supreme power of the scriptures, and the supreme power of the Dharma—encompassing all heavenly realms, all human realms, all divine realms, all hellish realms, all hungry ghost realms, all animal realms, and all wandering souls and lingering spirits who have gathered in this sacred precinct—we acknowledge that in your earthly lives, you may have suffered from thunder and lightning, flood and fire, execution and warfare, muteness and lameness, deafness and blindness, curses and poisons, miscarriage and falls, wounds from beasts and insects, untimely and violent deaths, lingering illness and unjust demise, causing your souls to scatter and your spirits to drift, your forms incomplete and your limbs unwhole. What afflicted you in the yang world afflicts you still in the yin realm. Though you have come before this Dharma assembly, you remain entangled in suffering.

Today, in accordance with the sacred teachings, we summon the spirits of the numinous offices, enact the great ritual, and gather the true qi to heal your ailments, uproot your suffering, restore your forms, and revive your spirits. Only then shall we purge the filth and impurity, refine and liberate you. Cultivate reverence and solemnity, lest you forfeit the fruits of this sacred practice.

*Next, the incense is offered, and the invocation begins:*
With reverence, we kindle incense and supplicate:
Green Emperor, Guardian of Souls;
White Emperor, Attendant of Spirits;
Red Emperor, Nurturer of Qi;
Black Emperor, Conductor of Blood;
Yellow Emperor, Central Sovereign;
True Lord of the Vermilion Mound Fire Palace;
True Lord of the Southern Prosperity Upper Palace;
True Lord of Refinement and Transcendence;
Divine Physicians of the Numinous Treasure;
Healing Merit-Officials;
Refining Perfected Ones;
Divine Marshals and Immortal Hosts—
all mighty and numinous beings.
May you bestow compassion and descend with true qi,
universally healing the ailments of these male and female souls,
restoring their forms and reviving their spirits.
*As decreed by the Most High!*

The Venerable Master visualizes the descent of the celestial officials, arrayed to his left and right, guarding before and behind.

*Next invocation:*
Supreme Lord of Jade Purity, Primordial Origin,
command the Divine Physicians to descend.
Restore the withered and decayed bones,
universally deliver and save all beings.
*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the Primordial Origin’s Boundless Salvation of Humanity!*

*Next, the Five Palaces ritual is performed. The true names of the Five Emperors are silently recited:*
Mo Hei Zi, Wa La Wu, Ling Bao Zhong, Hong Xing Mao, Mo Zhen You.
*Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the Decree of the Great Emperor of Longevity!*

The Master draws the qi of the Five Peaks and blows it forth.
Holding the talisman of the Healing Merit-Officials, he silently intones:
All beings of the four births and six destinies,
the ten kinds of sentient life,
all who suffer in the myriad transformations—
may the celestial light seize them,
and the talisman’s command prevail!
*Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the Decree of the Great Emperor of Longevity!*

He draws the ancestral qi, blows it upon the talisman, and burns it. Silently reciting the true name for delivering souls:
Xing Sheng Chen, Du Li Mao, Ke Han Yin, Gong Du Da Zhi Jia Xia, Ju Hun Dui Hun She.
*Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the Decree of the Great Emperor of Longevity!*

He draws the qi of the Three Paths and Five Peaks, blowing it upon the wandering souls to be delivered.

The Dharma Master takes his seat and intones:
Those whose bones have returned to life and the dead revived
have reverted to their original state;
those whose qi is gathered and forms restored
are sustained by the power of generation and transformation.
May their souls be clarified and rectified,
their bodies radiant with light.
By the jade talismans of the Great Cavern,
the precious true names of the Highest Clarity,
we enact the ritual as prescribed,
refining you for ascension.

Holding the Eighteen Jade Talismans of the Great Cavern, he invokes:
By the Emperor’s decree, commanded by the Primordial Lady of the Great Ultimate,
we solemnly summon:
Brain Spirit: Crimson Script of the Nine Muddy Vapors, Master of the Primal Roar, You;
Left Eye Spirit: Master of Penetrating Light and Mystic Truth, Li;

*Swiftly descend and attend these wandering souls,
entrusting qi to gather their forms,
restoring their spirits and reviving their natures!*

He draws the ancestral qi, blows it upon the talismans, and burns them as the text is recited.

*The Venerable One of Universal Qi and Boundless Life.*

Holding the Talisman of the Five Spirits in Conjunction, he intones the prayer:
By decree of the Supreme Emperor and command of the Primordial Lady of the Great One, we reverently summon:
the qi of the Heavenly Treasure of the Primal Vastness of Hun Dun,
the qi of the Numinous Treasure of the Crimson Vastness of Chi Hun,

the qi of the Teeth Spirit, Blade-Edge of Luo Qian,

the qi of the Left Azure Dragon of Jia Yi,
the qi of the Right White Tiger of Geng Xin,
the qi of the Front Vermilion Bird of Bing Ding,
the qi of the Rear Dark Warrior of Ren Gui—
Hasten, hasten to descend! True and life-generating qi,
flow into the body of the refined wandering soul.

He draws the ancestral qi, blows it upon the talisman, and burns it.

*The Venerable One of Boundless Wondrous Transformation.*

Then he intones the invocation:

By decree of the Supreme Emperor and command of the Primordial Lady of Grand Unity, I reverently summon the Six Ding Metal Lads, the Six Ding Jade Maidens, the Six Jia Metal Lads, the Six Jia Jade Maidens; the Spirit of Essence-Hidden, the Spirit of Water-Hidden; the spirits of eighty-four thousand pore-orifices; the spirits of thirty-six thousand ingress and egress; the spirits of twenty-four thousand breaths of qi; the spirits of twelve thousand radiant essences; the spirits of one thousand two hundred bodily forms; the spirits of three hundred sixty joints; the Jade Lad Lord, the Jade Maiden Lord, the White Prime Lord, the Cinnabar Field Lord, the Thirty-Six Lion Lords, the Master Father Lord, the Master Mother Lord, the Peach Prosperity Lord, the Union Longevity Lord; the Upper Harmony Lord, the Middle Harmony Lord, the Lower Harmony Lord; the Upper Prime Lord, the Middle Prime Lord, the Lower Prime Lord—hasten, hasten to descend! True and authentic spirits, each guard within the form of the refined wandering soul.

He draws the qi of the Five Directions and blows it into the wandering soul.

*The Venerable One of Aeonic Transformation of Form.*

Next he intones:

By decree of the Supreme Emperor and command of the Primordial Lady of Grand Unity, I reverently summon the Three Hun: Spirit Terrace Radiance, Luminous Soul, and Obscure Essence; I reverently summon the Seven Po: Corpse Dog, Crouching Arrow, Dark Yin, Swallowing Thief, Non-Poison, Removing Filth, and Foul Lung—each guard your proper station. Do not dare to transgress, and naturally attain long life.

He forms the Seal of the Three Paths and Five Sufferings, draws the qi of the Three Paths and Five Sufferings, swiftly imprints and blows it into the wandering soul to be delivered.

*The Venerable One of Transcendent Liberation.*

The master recites the Jade Clarity Incantation for Generating the Hun and Nurturing the Po:

Seven qi perfect the true,
Six rites revolve the void.
Five numina mend the broken,
Two luminaries assist [the obscured].
The net spins through empty space,
Steps fly to the cloud palace.
The embryo has its beginning,
Dust kalpas have no end.
The golden fortress nurtures substance,
The jade grotto congeals spirit.
True qi inwardly nourishes,
To perfect the sage.
Above it enters the Six Voids,
Below it penetrates the dark springs.
Within the cloud palace’s jeweled towers,
There dwells the true hun.
It enters and leaves the land of blessings,
Circulates through the Gate of Life.
It chews numinous mushrooms,
Rinses with golden springs.
Sweet dew flows in streams,
Drizzling rain descends upon the cinnabar field.
Purple auroras dawn and shine,
Three qi condense as mist.
The jasper chamber transforms the immortal,
Seated serenely upon the golden lotus.
True countenance veils the sun,
Dust kalpas become years.
*The Venerable One of Golden Countenance Manifest in the World.*

He sprinkles water, visualizing the countless wandering souls—forms and faces refined and proper—gathered beneath the altar, awaiting deliverance.

Again he intones:

Your illusory bodies perish easily,
But the sickness of the heart is hard to cure.
The forms of earth, water, fire, and wind
Have long since scattered;
The thoughts of hunger, thirst, illness, and suffering
Have not been forgotten through endless kalpas.
Today I generate your hun and nurture your po,
Restore your nature and return your spirit.
Those whose forms are incomplete
Shall henceforth be whole;
Those whose illnesses and sufferings are not healed
Shall from this moment be cured.
Sins are erased from the ledgers,
Evil roots extinguished.
The nether courts may no longer detain you,
And in heaven and earth you shall be reborn.
Compose yourselves and await ascension.

*The Venerable One of Universal Moistening of the Numinous Source.*

Your roots of suffering are dispersed and released,
Your true nature shines clearly.
You should bathe in orchid-scented waters,
Thoroughly washing away karmic obstacles,
That body and spirit may both attain perfection,
And merge with the Dao in truth.
Compassionate assembly, proceed with guidance.

*Ritual for the Universal Deliverance Great Purificatory Bath of Wandering Souls.*

According to the method, two immaculate bathing chambers are prepared, with buckets filled with fragrant water, into which the Yang-Purifying Talisman of Luminous Cinnabar is submerged. Before the altar, the Dharma Master intones:

In my duly ordained capacity, I, [Name], humbly invoke the Five Venerable Lords, the Thirty-Two Heavenly Emperors, the Perfected Lords of the Sun, Moon, and Five Planets, and the Star Lord of the Eastern Well. I have heard that the immortals and perfected dwell in profound seclusion, untouched by dust. The supreme Dao is mysterious and empty, its Dharma unattached to things. Only the benighted among sentient beings, entangled in karmic filth, require the true teaching to awaken, and the grace of wisdom to cleanse. I now, on behalf of [Name], solemnly offer this Yellow Register Great Purificatory Rite, universally delivering the six paths, four births, and all wandering, stagnant souls. I empower the Dharma water to bathe the multitude of souls. May you bestow compassion and condescend to deliver them. Let the flow of true and authentic qi descend and infuse the fragrant waters, that they may dispel the afflictions of heat and vexation, and swiftly attain the fruit of purity.

The assembly of the pure, present before me, is invited to offer praise.

The master visualizes the sun and moon, blending the red light of the Six Harmonies Palace and the yellow essence of the Two Qi, intermingling with five-colored clouds filling the chamber. The qi of the Thirty-Two Heavens—yellow, green, blue, red, black, azure, purple, and white—and the qi of the sun, moon, and five planets interweave within the water.

The assembly chants the *Hymn to the Eastern Well*:

The Celestial River pours into the Eastern Well,
Stone radiance, water-mother essence.
Round light brushes the numinous brilliance,
Mysterious splendor gleams in lofty clarity.
The Primordial Beginning parts the heavy night,
Heavenly beings follow the moon’s birth.
Bathing upon the orchid pool,
The dragon bears the Long Geng vase.
Golden lads scatter fragrant flowers,
Jade maidens pour the five stars.
Crowns and sashes laved in jade nectar,
Refining the forms of the five immortals.
Bodies fragrant, myriad spirits descend,
Riding the light to ascend the high clarity.

The officiating Daoist performs the rite:

In former lives, deluded by the true,
You drifted upon the bitter sea;
Today, receiving deliverance,
You are bathed in the flowery pond.
Without extraordinary causes,
None transcend to the pure realm.
On your behalf, I dedicate this
To aid your rebirth in the celestial realms.

He recites the *Three Primordials Precept Bathing Incantation for Dispelling Filth*:

Heaven is limpid, qi is clear,
Five colors rise in lofty brightness.
Sun and moon emit their radiance,
Refining and purifying the body’s form.
Numinous fluids inwardly cleanse,
Fragrant waters refine the essence.
Light and brilliance flow and shine,
Illuminating the Highest Clarity.
Qi does not receive evil,
The five viscera embrace the numinous.
Sins vanish from the Three Paths,
Calamities dissolve in the Nine Darknesses.
Evil roots are severed,
Fortunate blessings arise of themselves.
Today’s great vow
Is proclaimed to all.
Universally receive deliverance,
Ascend into the imperial court.
Jade void’s limpid splendor
Has washed away the yin filth;
The golden chamber delivers life,
Again bathing in the numinous fluids.
May you forever serve the true lineage,
And constantly practice purity.

On your behalf, I dedicate this
To aid your rebirth in the celestial realms.

He recites the *Golden Chamber Life-Delivering Incantation.

The celestial spirits flourish in glory,
The nine apertures are solemnly purified.
The five palaces and six viscera,
Their divine radiance fresh and bright.
The Three Primes are firmly secured,
Myriad qi fully suffused.
The Golden Chamber delivers life,
The Green Script restores rebirth.
Thrice refined and ninefold transformed,
Ascending into the Grand Clarity,
The Three Luminaries shine as one,
Heaven and earth unite in parallel.
Soaring through the mysterious void,
Roaming and feasting in the Purple Court.
Washing with the waters of yellow blossoms,
Swiftly attaining purity and emptiness;
Chanting the verses of the Green Script,
Enabling flight and transformation.
May the roots of evil forever fade,
Preserving the Dao-qi to endure.
On your behalf, I dedicate this
To aid your rebirth in the celestial realms.
He recites the *Green Script Longevity Inner True Incantation*.

Heaven and earth together purified,
Washing away filth and sweeping away dust.
Refining and transforming the nine paths to restore the primordial true form.
The hundred joints receive the numinous,
Each node renewed.
Purity and emptiness reflect and illuminate,
Displayed within and without.
Auspicious day, propitious hour,
Life delivered, years restored.
Jade lads and jade maidens
Hold your towels for you.
Mystic clouds and purple canopies
Adorn your body.
May you attain long life,
Rooted with heaven and earth.
Washing the heart and cleansing thoughts,
Dissolving karmic debts of countless kalpas;
Gathering qi to form the body,
Shedding the abode of the five aggregates.
Thus the mortal dust no longer stains,
The true realm ever luminous.
Swiftly untangling deluded attachments,
Free from defilements and burdens.
On your behalf, I dedicate this
To aid your rebirth in the celestial realms.
He recites the *Purificatory Ascension Incantation*.

The heavens bright, the qi clear,
Your body now refined.
Dust and filth dissolved,
The nine apertures receive the numinous.
Enabling your transformation,
Restoring the form of youth.
Dark souls delivered,
All attain flight and ascension.
Driving out the turbid and raising the pure,
Attaining utmost purity;
Ascending to truth and leaving suffering,
Requires solemn adornment.
Now the Golden Chamber delivers life,
Jade maidens bring forth the numinous.
Voiding the hymns of the cavern chamber,
Completing the splendor of rainbow robes.
On your behalf, I dedicate this
To aid your rebirth in the celestial realms.
He recites the *Three Primes Precepts and Adornment Incantation*.

The five turbidities now purified,
The eight luminaries now bright.
Today you receive the Dao,
Sins extinguished, blessings arise.
Ever with the Five Emperors,
Equal in truth to the highest spirits.
Next, the transformation robes—
The Heavenly River’s ablutions and vestments.
The Celestial Worthy awaits the completion of the transformation robes,
Then ceases.
Envision the dark souls’ bodies radiant,
Their immortal robes resplendent,
All souls joyful and lovely.

You have now completed your ablutions,
Your robes and crowns fully arrayed.
All filth and turbidity purged,
Instantly attaining purity and emptiness.
Yet you must refine your soul’s demeanor,
To approach the Dharma assembly.
May you forever remove karmic defilements,
Untangling the debts of three lifetimes;
Instantly generating yang radiance,
Ascending the path to the Nine Heavens.
All should reverently prepare,
Awaiting your ascent.

Next, the Preceptor’s dedication—
All the merits of the preceding ablutions,
Boundless and immeasurable,
Are employed to cleanse
All sentient beings.
Untying the knots of root and dust,
Universally rendering them pure.
For these causes and conditions,
He recites the *Great Sage Primordial Celestial Worthy*,
*The Most High Great Dao Lord*,
*The Most High Lord Lao*,
Whose inconceivable merits are invoked.

The *Unsurpassed Yellow Register Grand Fast Established Rites*, Scroll Twenty-Nine, concludes.
The *Unsurpassed Yellow Register Grand Fast Established Rites*, Scroll Thirty.

The *Grand Fast for Universal Salvation with Empowered Offerings* from the *Rituals and Precepts* compiled by Supreme Enforcer of the Dao, Immortal Jiang Shuyu

The Preceptor leads the souls from the bathing chamber into the reed enclosure, recites the *Hymn of Radiance*, and circumambulates the enclosure once. Then, the Daoist assembly arranges itself at the offering banquet. The Preceptor offers incense with this prayer:

This single stick of incense,
Rooted in the Primordial, grounded in the Later Earth,
Its fragrance scatters the Ten Flowers, ascending to the bounds of the Forest of Spirits;
Its smoke congeals the Nine Qi, descending to the realms of darkness and silence.
Universally pervading all sentient beings,
Pervasively encompassing the Dharma-realm.

Today, on behalf of the fast’s sponsor, [Name],
and with the intention of universally benefiting the six destinies, the four modes of birth, and the wandering souls of the departed,
we establish this pure and unimpeded nocturnal fast.
We burn this precious incense,
offering it to the Boundless Dao’s Three Realms’ Imperial Teachers,
the Most Revered Scriptural Treasures,
the Sagely Beings of the Heavens,
the True Lords of the Three Realms,
and the Mighty Spirits of the Ten Directions.

We humbly pray:
May you traverse the skies, gazing down upon auspicious clouds;
May you turn your radiant chariot, riding the瑞 mist to descend.
Before you, may the assembled souls to be delivered
concentrate their spirits, purify their thoughts,
contemplate the Dao, and return to the True.
May they suddenly awaken to past causes,
severing forever the bonds of worldly dust;
May they be steeped in the Dharma’s grace,
realizing the inherent emptiness of the awakened nature.
Swiftly, may they see with their eyes and hear with their ears,
their noses open and their hearts comprehend.
The Three Paths and Five Sufferings,
shall not depart from the root of purity;
The Six Realms and Nine Hells,
shall all belong to the realm of light.
May all attachments be forever dissolved,
and all attain freedom.
We bow our heads in reverence,
taking refuge in the Boundless Dao.

*Recitation of the Universal Offering Hymn*
Universally offering to the boundless sages,
Incense smoke scatters to the ten directions.
May it form a tower of the Seven Treasures,
Shedding light upon the Five Turbid Worlds.
Conveying the hosts of heaven and humanity,
All ascend the Dharma Bridge.
Together, we gather in the realm of Non-Action,
Diligently cultivating without retreat.

The Preceptor offers incense, visualizing transformation,
following the *Lingbao* original scripture’s practices,
transmuting into the Heavenly Worthy of Salvation from Suffering,
while the altar assembly becomes the Perfected Ones of Salvation from Suffering.
The offering banquet becomes a three-tiered treasure terrace,
with red and purple qi from the offering vessel surging to the heavens.
The supervising officers, local earth gods, and guardians of the four directions
are all present according to ritual.

Next, visualize the Three Treasures’ Great Emperors,
the Supreme Compassionate Lord of the Great Ultimate,
the Ten Directions’ Perfected Ones of Salvation from Suffering,
the True Lords of the Sun, Moon, and Three Realms,
the Golden Lads and Jade Maidens,
the Divine Officials and Merit Officers,
each distinctly present.

Then, make the following petition:

Your servant, [Name], of the Dharma rank,
burns incense and respectfully petitions:
The Marvelously Non-Existent Supreme Lord, the Celestial Worthy of the Primordial,
The Supreme Dao Treasure, the Marvelously Existent Supreme Lord,
The Jade Emperor of the Void, the Great Dao Lord,
The Supreme Scriptural Treasure, the Perfectly True Great Emperor,
The Myriad-Transforming Primal Elder Lord of Chaos,
The Supreme Master Treasure, the Heavenly Worthy of Salvation from Suffering of the Eastern Ultimate,
The Heavenly Worthies of Salvation from Suffering of the Ten Directions,
The Five Ancient Emperors,
The Thirty-Two Heavenly Lords,
The Solar Lord of the Sun Palace,
The Lunar Sovereign of the Moon Palace,
The Lords of the Five Directions, Five Virtues, and Five Stars,
The Seven Lords of the Northern Dipper,
The Six Lords of the Southern Dipper,
The Perfected Lord, Master of the *Lingbao* Scriptures,
The Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center,
The Three Heavenly Great Sagely Master Lords,
The Perfected Lord of the Great Ultimate Immortal,
The True Lords of the Three Ministries and Five Offices,
The Fragrant Official Envoys of the Void’s Surveillance,
The Local Earth Gods of the Present Realm,
and all the responsive and efficacious mighty spirits of the Three Realms.

Your servant has heard:
The six destinies cycle endlessly,
never escaping the sea of rebirth;
The four modes of birth drift like waves,
hardly transcending the realm of liberation.

The souls of the ten myriad kinds lie in the Yellow Springs,
their spirits bound in the Nine Springs’ eternal night.
Endlessly they suffer retribution,
with no hope of transformation or release.
Craving and desire weigh heavy, breeding hunger and thirst;
spirit and wisdom grow dim, gathering sorrow and affliction.
Once sunk into the realm of suffering,
they are forever cut off from the light of the sun.
Without the true canon of the Three Caverns,
there is no path to life from the Nine Springs.
The Mysterious Perfected One, moved by compassion,
has bequeathed the teachings of the Great Dao.
Opening the gate of universal offering in the Night Feast,
delivering the consciousness adrift in the sea of suffering.
The light of wisdom shines forth,
transforming and gathering billions upon billions.
The power of the Dharma extends its blessing,
pervading the entire Dharma realm.
Your servant now, on behalf of the feast sponsor [Name],
solemnly dedicates this offering for the departed kin [Name],
and all the wandering souls present—
those of the six destinies and four modes of birth,
the lonely spirits and stagnant souls—
establishing the Supreme Yellow Register Great Feast,
to aid their deliverance and transcendence.

Tonight, with reverence,
we prepare a banquet of the Most High’s compassion,
boundless and unobstructed,
vast and impartial,
pure and abundant—
a single offering of sacred food.
First, we present it to the Ten Poles and Ten Flowers,
the Three Origins and Three Realms,
the Flying Celestial Great Saints,
and all the compassionate lords by their sacred titles;
to the sun, moon, and stars,
the rivers, seas, and mountains,
the springs, Fengdu, and earthly altars—
all the mighty spirits.
May they together deign to witness and partake,
and in unison grant their attestation and deliverance.
The Three Flowered Treasure Radiance
bestows the luminous brilliance of the Three Sceneries;
The Eightfold Assembly’s Sacred Scriptures
gather the celestial qi of the Eight Heavens.
Descending into the altar’s precinct,
they infuse the Dharma food.
May all beings of the six destinies and four modes of birth,
all lonely spirits and lost souls,
partake of this offering,
so that the six desires grow still and the hundred bodies flourish;
may they hear the Dharma and listen to the scriptures,
so that the one nature becomes complete and the myriad spirits gather.
May evil roots be extinguished,
the wheel of karmic retribution cease.
May all ascend to the heavens of self-mastery,
and forever dwell in the realm of blessed halls.
Your servant is overwhelmed with fervent supplication.

The officiating Daoist purifies the space and intones:
*Cool and sweet is the nectar feast,
its Dharma flavor beyond thought or speech.
Rare fragrances flow with the seven treasures,
what doubt remains in the unseen?
Receive this Dharma offering,
ascend to heaven and enter the Purple Tenuity.
Alas for those who suffer in the long night,
tormented in the three paths of existence.
Fire rages in their throats,
eternal hunger and thirst their lot.
A single sprinkle of sweet dew,
and the scorching heat finds cool relief.
Spirits and souls are born in the Great Canopy,
nourished and pervaded by its grace.
Naturally, they partake of heaven’s kitchen,
its Dharma flavor beyond thought or speech.
Universally aiding those in the six destinies,
all hungry ghosts and spirits yet unsaved.
May they all be steeped in the sweet dew’s savor,
and be fully sated.
In this wondrous assembly,
may all be encompassed.
Ascend to heaven and enter the Purple Tenuity,
rise to the Clear Capital’s palace.*

The celestial gate’s golden light and Dao qi,
layer upon layer, descend in unbroken streams,
infusing the officiant’s body and the vessel of Dharma food,
illuminating within and without.
The Three August Ones of the Most High,
the Azure Mystery Emperor,
and the hosts of saints in the ten directions from the void,
bear witness and form this sacred covenant.

*We invoke the Three Treasures—
each with reverent faith—*
The Dharma Master intones:
*Abstruse and unfathomable,
dwelling alone before the Lord of Images;
elusive and obscure,
originating at the dawn of the Great Beginning.
Splitting the primal qi,
unfolding the myriad perfected beings.
Only the Great Dao is exalted,
the refuge of all living things.*

Tonight, we solemnly present pure offerings,
and perform the sacred rites.
May the Treasure of the Dao extend its compassion,
that the hidden spirits may receive deliverance.
We humbly beseech your radiant witness,
and pray for your attestation.
The assembly, with devout sincerity,
invokes with focused intent.

The officiating Daoist proclaims:
*With focused intent, we invoke
the Dao Treasures of the ten directions,
to descend upon this altar.
We take refuge in the Supreme Dao,
the Most Perfect and Greatly Compassionate One.
May all beings universally
attain the fruit of non-action.*

The Dharma Master intones:
*The jade tablets of the celestial script,
existing before emptiness itself;
the golden tablets and sacred texts,
qi congealed at the dawn of the Flying Mystery.
Preserving the kalpas’ destiny,
universally nurturing the divine spirits.
Only the sacred scriptures of the Three Caverns are exalted,
the true treasures of the ten directions.*

Tonight, we solemnly present pure offerings,
and perform the sacred rites.
May the Treasure of the Scriptures extend its compassion,
that the hidden spirits may receive deliverance.
We humbly beseech your radiant witness,
and pray for your attestation.
The assembly, with devout sincerity,
invokes with focused intent.

The officiating Daoist proclaims:
*With focused intent, we invoke
the Scripture Treasures of the ten directions,
to descend upon this altar.
We take refuge in the Primordial Lord of Mystery,
the thirty-six divisions of scriptures.
May all beings universally
enter the Three Vehicles’ path.*

The Dharma Master intones:
*Manifesting in countless forms to descend and transform,
serving as the bridge between life and death;
establishing the Dharma to deliver humanity,
the ladder and steps to true immortality.
Drawing forth the four assemblies,
opening the path of the Three Vehicles.
Only the true masters of countless kalpas
are the compassionate fathers of humans and heavens.*

Tonight, we solemnly present pure offerings,
and perform the sacred rites.
May the Treasure of the Masters extend its compassion,
that the hidden spirits may receive deliverance.
We humbly beseech your radiant witness,
and pray for your attestation.
The assembly, with devout sincerity,
invokes with focused intent.

The officiating Daoist proclaims:
*With focused intent, we invoke
the Master Treasures of the ten directions,
to descend upon this altar.
We take refuge in the Lord of Mystery,
the Most Compassionate and Supreme Master.
May all beings universally
constantly hear the teachings of the Master Treasure.*

*May you take refuge in the Supreme Dao,
may you take refuge in the Supreme Scriptures,
may you take refuge in the Supreme Master.*
*Together, we dedicate the inconceivable merit.*

The Dharma Master addresses:
*With utmost sincerity, we reverently petition
the Greatly Compassionate One of the Eastern Pole’s Palace,
the Heavenly Worthy of Great Unity who responds to cries and attends to suffering,
the Most High Savior from Suffering.
Your servant has heard:
Gathering qi and amassing merit,
the Most High composed the scriptures for delivering beings;
responding to cries and attending to suffering,
the Compassionate One bears the name of Savior from Suffering.
Your majestic spirit pervades the ten directions,
your vows universally deliver all beings.
May they, by the power of the Dao,
escape the paths of delusion.*

Your servant, on behalf of the feast sponsor [Name],
solemnly dedicates this offering for the departed kin [Name],
and all the wandering souls present—
establishing the Supreme Yellow Register Great Feast.
Tonight, we prepare a universal offering,
a boundless and unobstructed,
vast and impartial,
pure and abundant night feast of Dharma food
for the six destinies, four modes of birth,
lonely spirits, and stagnant souls.
We humbly beseech your great compassion
to turn your true chariot back to us,
bestow your radiant brilliance,
and illuminate with your majestic light.
Spread auspicious clouds to open the path of life,
and dispense propitious mists to seal the gate of death.

Now we draw the qi of the supreme heavens,
to succor the souls of the Nine Dark Realms.
As the sacred name is proclaimed,
the Three Wretched Paths hear and escape suffering;
as the numinous scripture is chanted,
the Six Destinies receive deliverance and transcend.

We look up in reliance upon your utmost benevolence,
and bow in hope of your all-penetrating gaze.
Again, we rely upon the pure assembly
to join in praise and exaltation.

*Four invocations of the Most High Savior-from-Suffering Heavenly Worthy*
Recite the *Sutra of Salvation from Suffering* once.

Visualize five-colored radiance manifesting in the east,
a perfect halo like the moon’s corona,
illuminating without exception the heavens above, the earth below,
and the ten directions of the cosmos.
At its center sits the Azure Mystery Supreme Emperor,
his head crowned with a diadem of emerald jade,
robed in a flying cloak of kingfisher-green feathered silk,
his left hand holding a luminous jade-green bell,
his right hand grasping a branch of azure-green feathers.
He is enthroned upon a nine-headed lion of nine hues,
seated upon a golden-cinnabar lotus pedestal.
From each lion’s mouth flames swirl in encircling coils.
Within the radiance of the Heavenly Worthy’s body,
another nine-hued halo arcs like a rainbow.
From his neck shines a solar orb.

Attended by the eighty-one spirits of the Great One,
the Two Perfected Ones to left and right,
heavenly marshals and valiant knights,
Azure Mystery functionaries,
and jade lads and maidens of the Yellow Register,
the divine kings emit from their brows beams of wisdom-light,
their brilliance sharp as ten thousand flashing swords.
Each detail is distinct as they infuse the Dharma food.

With single-minded devotion, we invoke the thirty-two Heavenly Lords.
Your servant has heard:
when the Primal Beginning unfolded its chart,
true yang spread its transformative power.
Though it nurtures life through wondrous being,
it truly gathers qi in the Upper Prime.
From the Form Realm downward,
all are bound in the turning wheel.
When the blessings of karmic conditions are exhausted,
one generation may end and another begin.

Only the true scriptures of the Eight Assemblies,
hidden within the great Brahma of the heavens,
transcend the ten thousand ranks,
their grace universally pervading the Nine Dark Realms.

Your servant, on behalf of the feast sponsor [Name],
solemnly dedicates this offering for the departed kin [Name],
and all the wandering souls present—
establishing the Supreme Yellow Register Great Feast.
Tonight, we prepare a universal offering,
a boundless and unobstructed,
vast and impartial,
pure and abundant night feast of Dharma food
for the six destinies, four modes of birth,
lonely spirits, and stagnant souls.

We humbly beseech the celestial chariot to descend,
gazing upon the dusty world below.
May it bestow the radiance of heaven,
and send down the flow of Dharma sustenance.
In the great thousandfold world,
by the Brahma qi it gathers and transforms without end;
for the souls sunk in darkness through kalpas uncounted,
by the true vehicle they receive full and sufficient nourishment.

Thus may the transformative nurturance of primordial essence
further enhance the vast and luminous sheltering grace.
The pure assembly, with sincere intent,
joins in unison to chant and praise.

Recite the esoteric incantation once,
and form the mudra of the Three Wretched Paths and Five Sacred Peaks.
Envision the Dao assembly all transformed into perfected beings,
together with the Heavenly Lords of the thirty-two heavens,
chanting in unison.
After each direction is completed,
visualize the qi of that quarter—
nine from the east, three from the south,
seven from the west, five from the north—
flowing in their respective numbers
to infuse the Dharma food in the water vessel with a breath.

Again, recite the esoteric incantation once,
and visualize twelve streams of yellow qi
from the five directions, the sun and moon, and the five stars,
drawing the qi of the thirty-two heavens,
interweaving and interlacing,
infusing the Dharma food.

Recite the esoteric incantation three times,
and visualize red light from the four directions
enveloping the altar for a long while,
merging into a five-colored rainbow aura
that descends into the five viscera of the officiant’s body,
then coalescing into one vast orb,
expansively covering and filling the empty void,
so that the officiant’s body seems to dwell within the solar palace.

The Dharma food multiplies from one to two,
from two to three, from three to nine,
from nine to eighty-one,
gathering and transforming without end,
pervading the ten directions,
from earth to heaven,
boundless and immeasurable.

Next, immerse the talisman of transformed food into the water vessel,
and recite the *Sweet Dew Permeating the True* mantra three times.
The master lifts the water vessel,
stirring it with a cypress branch,
sprinkling the Dharma food in all directions.
Visualize the Azure Mystery Supreme Emperor,
together with the officiant’s perfected being and the lords of the ritual,
all reciting the *True Mantra of Sweet Dew*,
sprinkling its nectar,
fragrant qi richly suffusing and fulfilling all.

The merit’s golden light,
subtly opens the gates of darkness.
From the Flower Pool flows true fragrance,
lotus canopies drift upon the clouds.
A thousand spirits, replete with primordial harmony,
ever dwell in the Twelve Towers.
Swiftly proclaim the sacred decree of the Numinous Treasure,
that all may wander freely in the celestial paradise.

Next, recite the *Mantra for Breaking Open Fengdu’s Hell and Opening the Path of Karma* three times.
The Dao assembly circumambulates,
while the Dharma master, standing in position, concentrates the spirit,
visualizing the myriad suffering souls in Fengdu’s Nine Dark Hells of the northeast,
enduring every torment.
Then visualize the Jade Clarity Supreme Emperor enthroned in the mud-pill palace.
In accordance with the great ritual,
the officiant’s perfected being, along with the divine officials and marshals,
all recite the *Mantra for Breaking Open Fengdu’s Hell and Opening the Path of Karma*.
After a long while,
the Supreme Emperor emits from his mouth nine-colored auspicious clouds and purple qi,
a golden light piercing straight into the hells,
shattering the layered darkness of the iron citadel,
crushing the willow fetters,
dissolving the swords and blades,
transforming them into azure lotuses.
The cauldrons of boiling liquid become spring gardens,
the ninefold depths of darkness all turned into pure realms.
All the sinful souls emerge,
advancing to the altar’s base,
awaiting deliverance.

Vast and desolate, within Fengdu’s bounds,
layer upon layer of diamond mountains.
The boundless light of the Numinous Treasure
illuminates the scorching torments of the cauldrons.
The seven generations of ancestors and all the dark-bound souls,
their bodies borne upon fragrant cloud chariots,
ascend upon the blue lotuses of samadhi and wisdom,
to be eternally at peace in the divine realms.

All the foregoing empowerments of the Dharma food
are immeasurable meritorious causes,
used to deliver the dark-bound souls,
elevating them to blessed realms.

Your former great afflictions arose from possessing this body.
With a body, hunger and emptiness arise, and thoughts turn to food.
With a body, cold and heat bring suffering, and thoughts turn to clothing.
But where is the body now? Why cling to food?
Without a body, why cling to clothing?
With food and clothing, thoughts turn to wealth and treasure.
Yet hunger, emptiness, cold, and heat no longer concern you.
What use are wealth and treasure?
The six sense-objects are illusory and false,
all ultimately returning to emptiness.
Behold the assembled spirits before you—
their physical forms have perished,
yet attachments and desires linger unresolved.

If you can perceive emptiness and see your true nature,
cutting off delusion to return to the real,
transcending attachment to existence and non-existence,
you will naturally attain liberation.
But if the roots of sensory dust remain unsevered,
and karmic thoughts are not extinguished...

Behold those who suffer from hunger and thirst—now I offer them the unobstructed sweet dew of the Dharma as sustenance.

*The Ten Directions’ Savior from Suffering, Heavenly Worthy of Numinous Treasure, Universal Salvation Grand Purification Feast and Alms-Rite Proclamation*

The Dharma Master offers incense, takes his seat, and gazes toward the ghost-gate altar arrayed before him. He universally proclaims to the boundless worlds of the ten directions, to all assemblies of heavenly beings and humans, to all mighty spirits soaring through the void, to all suffering souls in hell, to all creatures burdened by karmic debt, and to all wandering, ownerless, and stranded spirits:

It is said that the two conditions of good and evil yield vastly different fruits of suffering and joy. The paths of life and death diverge, separated by the divide of darkness and light. You, having just shed your sheltered bodies, have sunk into the ghostly realm. You know only the torment of hunger and thirst, clinging to the remnants of withered husks. How much worse for those souls enduring the pains of retribution—obstructed by the hindrances of their residual senses, the faintest sprouting of a thought for food ignites the fires of karmic consequence.

Now, as this Dharma assembly is arrayed and banners and flowers beckon, this wondrous, pure offering is transformed to relieve the emaciated forms of your suffering. Upon hearing this summons, you gather at once, jubilant as if presented with a grand feast, consoled as though restored to life. Old and young support one another, young and old press shoulder to shoulder in order. Without clamor, you take your places, your only aim to be filled. Above, you receive the compassion of the Dao and its teachings, universally partaking in the offering; below, you embody the vow and power of this purification rite, with none left behind. Let this rare encounter stir your hearts—do not conceive of it as finite. Return to the true Dao and be delivered from this existence. With bellies full, you rejoice as if sated beyond measure; with minds awakened, you feel shame as though hearing sighs of remorse.

Today, for all you ghosts and spirits, we establish this boundless purification feast and perform the empowering Dharma rites.

The officiating Daoist intones the *Jade Clarity Lifespan Invocation of the Celestial Master*, saying:

I bow my head to the Radiant Wisdom of the Void and Supreme,
I bow my head in reverence to the Sovereign of the Profound Origin.
You fashion heaven and earth without boasting of virtue,
Yet serve as refuge and support for all beings.
With compassion, you rescue the souls turning in the five destinies’ wheel,
With mercy, you deliver those suffering in the three paths of hell.
I revere the Heavenly Worthy of the Golden Palace,
I revere the Father of Compassion who embodies the Six Perfections,
I revere the Supreme Perfected of Jade Clarity,
Who severs the bonds of life and death, granting eternal continuity.
Emerging from existence, entering the void without reliance,
You transform the withered and decayed into immortals.
A chance like this comes but once in a thousand, ten thousand kalpas—
For the multitudes, you broadly expound the causes of karmic conditions.
You reverse decay, raise the dead to everlasting life,
Ensuring their forms and spirits transcend all bounds of change.

*From the Scripture of Jade Clarity*

Next, the offering of food is made.

Within cloud-kitchens, wondrous viands—
those who partake ascend in radiance, soaring beyond the void;
From the Purple Palace, sacred scriptures—
those who heed attain perfection and grasp the Dao.

Now you have tempered your forms, cleansed your essences,
gathered qi to reconstitute yourselves as humans.
Having arrived at this Dharma feast,
each must be sated to the full.

We offer this for you,
to aid your ascent into the immortal realms above.
Recite the Jade Clarity Sweet Dew Empowered Dharma-Food Spell:

I bow my head to the Encompassing Net of Heaven,
converging radiance to draw in numinous splendor.
I restrain the hun-soul, govern the seven po,
contemplating with clarity to stabilize the center.
In movement and stillness, I venerate the Void;
in rest and repose, I repose in the Chamber of Mystery.
Hunger is sated with yellow and azure blossoms,
thirst quenched with jade-root nectar.
The divine banner commands the great demons,
uniting the body to refine true light.
Reflecting again upon the Great Nothingness,
I wander ever in the midst of emptiness.
Round and all-pervading, I ferry across the waves of dissolution,
true transformation knows no fixed term.
Boundless, without end or beginning—
practitioners must clearly understand this.
In silence, I forget doctrines and teachings,
responding to the times to expound the great principles.
The Dao descends yet does not illuminate itself—
it must first be bestowed by others.
Converging in the non-dual realm,
following the heart’s intent, it naturally unites and parts.

From the *Scripture of Jade Clarity*

Golden tones proclaim the teachings,
jade tablets transmit the precepts.
They serve as the bridge to rescue the dead,
the ladder and steps to ascend as immortals.
Relying on the power of wisdom,
you depart from the paths of delusion.
May your nature and insight attain perfect communion,
your body and mind achieve purity.

We offer this for you,
to aid your ascent into the immortal realms above.
Recite the Three Lights Dharma-Qi Spell:

Vast and crystalline, Dharma-qi arises,
billowing and congealing in the midst of heaven.
The two luminaries together shine with clarity,
the five planets intermingle in mutual resonance.
The Three Lights blaze with brilliance,
precious qi fills the Three Palaces.
In the imperial realm, the Nine Elders convene,
swallowing and imbibing, the hundred parts of the body flourish.
Golden blossoms illuminate radiance and shadow,
your body becomes one with the sun and moon.
Invoking the Dao before the Perfected Saints above,
your lifespan spans ten thousand kalpas without end.

The Three Lights blaze in splendor,
the Nine Elders gather in the imperial realm;
The five planets weave their net,
the myriad spirits nest in the true abode.
Swallowing jade nectar, chewing numinous sprouts,
the nine orifices are opened and unobstructed,
the hundred meridians are harmonized and regulated.

We offer this for you,
to aid your ascent into the immortal realms above.
Recite the Three Lights Flowing Essence Spell:

The wondrous Dao divides the One Qi,
within qi, yin and yang are separated.
Congealing and transforming into sun, moon, and stars,
brilliantly flowing as the Three Lights.
Nine blossoms contain the Nine Ways,
eight hues delight the eight directions.
Resplendent, they illumine the true body,
flowing essence returns to the Great Vastness.
Below, they descend into the Abyssal Spring Palace,
above, they array themselves in the Realm of Non-Where.
Releasing the body, traces take flight,
suddenly, all is forgotten.
Seven treasures stream with pure essence,
chaos intermingles with radiant blossoms.
Swallowing the Nine Clouds Elixir,
this joy knows no end.

The Dharma-vessel ferries and guides,
delivering from the five sufferings’ depths;
The wisdom-dew cools and refreshes,
dispelling the heat and afflictions of the three paths.
To dissolve and remove karmic filth,
you must rely on the true teachings.

We offer this for you,
to aid your ascent into the immortal realms above.
Recite the Three Lights Nurturing Infant Spell:

Within the profound and recondite Nine Qi,
the Nurturing Infant arises from the Great Nothingness.
The radiant sun blazes in the Valley of Light,
the resplendent moon shines on the celestial thoroughfare.
The five stars stream with precious light,
the Dipper and Pole pivot the celestial axis.
Flying qi billows and scatters,
swallowing and imbibing, you pause in contemplation.
Transcending traces, you ascend the celestial jade steps,
refining the magic mushroom, partaking of blossoms in bloom.
Qi spreads, the myriad spirits convene,
lifting the body to ascend into the Great Void.

The Primordial Beginning unfurls the chart,
true scriptures manifest in the world.
The Compassionate Venerable guides and receives,
exemplary models are proclaimed and disseminated.

By its power to widely nourish all beings, it is called "Sweet Dew"; by its power to shatter karmic obstructions, it is named "Dharma Speech." You have long been trapped in the wheel of suffering, cut off from the true Dao. Through the illusory union of false conditions, your original nature has grown dim and obscured. To transcend and realize the eternal truth, you must return life to the hun and po souls.

For your sake, to aid your ascent into the immortal realms, recite the Jade Clarity Yin-Sheng Brahman Chant:

The magic mushroom has no root, yet it is the source of all transformations.
Within, the seven po souls congeal; above, the three hun souls coalesce.
The twenty-four Perfected Ones enter and exit without gate.
In the profound obscurity, all is indistinct and without essence.
Through kalpas they endure or perish, born with the ebb and flow of qi.
Externally, primordial simplicity solidifies; internally, the seven meridians are nurtured.
The five spirits plant blossoms; the Three Terraces unfold their glory.
The Purple Palace and White Youth return the form to infancy.
Rising on clouds, soaring through mist, they float in the void.
Within resides the Jade Perfection, known as the Divine Lord.
To his left, he clasps Wu-Ying; to his right, Bai-Yuan stands guard.
The Dark Beast blocks the rear; the Vermilion Phoenix leads the front.
Above, a verdant canopy floats; below, golden lotuses surge.
Fragrant clouds congeal in the sky; sweet dew flows without end.
Its use is inexhaustible, its source unending.
The sacred sound resonates, the Dharma accords with the mystic scripture of the Jade Treasury.
Voices reach the ten directions; grace pervades the three realms.
Dao-qi descends with the incantation, its luminous blessing circulating in harmony.
Poured into the Dharma-food, it universally purifies.
Those who partake shall have their karmic obstructions forever dissolved,
the five viscera blossoming, the hundred meridians harmonized,
life without end, their form like the Great Void.
The merit is profound and unfathomable.
Each of you should arouse the mind of great compassion,
universally sharing with all, that all may be fully sated.
Body and mind cool and refreshed, free from heat and vexation.
Body and mind full and content, free from hunger and emptiness.
Body and mind peaceful and secure, free from sorrow and suffering.
Body and mind liberated, free from the cyclic suffering and joy of karmic retribution.
Transform this into sustenance, universally offering it to all the heavens,
and even bestowing it upon all the destitute and forsaken, that none may be hindered.
Thus shall you not fail the Ten Directions’ Heavenly Worthies in their vast deliverance of the drowned and universal salvation of those in darkness.
May both giver and receiver alike bathe in the grace of the Dao and together attain blessed fruition.

Now, the Heavenly Worthy possesses the Divine Incantation for Shattering Hell, Liberating from Suffering, and Ascending to Heaven. For your sake, recite it with single-minded devotion.
Its merit is beyond thought; practitioners gain blessed reward.
Bestow the Dharma-drink and food, and abide forever in peace and bliss.

The offering of food now complete, I shall further expound the true Dharma for your universal benefit, that you may rely upon it in cultivation and use it as a bridge to the Way.

Of old, in the emptiness of non-being, the Three Qi first arose.
The Three Qi congealed and formed the Three Heavens.
Three transformed into nine, nine again gave birth to three,
and the thirty-six heavens were thus arrayed.
Below, the nine layers of earth and water, along with the twenty-seven winds,
mutually support one another, also thirty-six in number, corresponding above to the heavens.
Beyond this lies the root of primordial qi, embracing and upholding the limitless Two Modes.
Once humanity was placed therein, they shared with heaven and earth
the governance of qi through its division.
Qi gathers and scatters; beings live and die.
From birth to death is the constant way of all things.
To not die and live forever—this is the true Dao.
The Dao divides into the Three Caverns, its teachings unfolding as the Three Vehicles.
Expounding broadly on causes and conditions, it awakens all existence.
Devas, humans, spirits, and ghosts—all may cultivate it.
According to their vows and practice, each attains their fruition.
Accumulating merit is gradual; piling virtue is the foundation.
When merit is full and virtue complete, the body transcends the Three Realms.
Within the Three Realms, the longevity and excellence of devas and humans vary,
each differing from the other.
The refinement of cultivation, too, differs in each case.
From the subtle to the manifest, one gradually accords with the true Dao.
From mortal to immortal, passing through the Perfected to become a sage—
only by transcending this realm does one enter the Three Clarities,
first attaining the ultimate fruit, which is the Dao of eternal life and imperishability.

All beings, deluded regarding the true Dao,
long habituated to inversion, their thoughts scattered and chaotic,
pursue the dusts of the world, abandoning one thing to grasp another,
never resting for even a moment.
Bewildered by what exists, they are blind to what does not.
Karmic bonds and conditions arise from this,
drawing in transgressions and defilements, accumulating through the ages.
Revolving in the Three Realms, adrift and forgetful of return,
they drift through the Five Paths, long submerged and unenlightened.
Embracing pain and poison, they cannot awaken to themselves.
The great Dao flows through forms, its kinds and categories intermingled,
its qi boundless, its numbers unfathomable.
Dying and reviving, obscured and then illuminated—
the heavens and earth revolve like the wheels of a chariot.
The pure and unified Dao-qi is fundamentally without birth or death.
Even if one were to become a deva or human with a lifespan of billions,
without understanding the root of the Dao, bound by desire,
one’s allotted time would end, and they would again fall into the Four Births, Five Paths,
Six Destinies, and Three Wretched Realms,
endlessly revolving without respite.

If, among all dharmas, you generate the mind of existence,
abandoning the impure realm to seek the bliss of the Three Clarities,
forsaking the body of sentient beings to pursue the form of the true Dao,
desiring to sever afflictions and enter the unconditioned,
seeking to leave behind all views to attain quiescent extinction—
such attitudes, I tell you, are called great perverse views.
It is like a fool who fears the great earth and wishes to flee,
yet wherever he goes, he cannot escape the earth.
So too with beings who fear the body of birth and death,
hastily abandoning the Three Realms with a mind of aversion.
The body they attain does not transcend birth and death.
Such beings have yet to perceive the Dharma.
All beings are heavily shrouded in ignorance.
The true Dao is within them, yet they cannot see it.
It is like a fool who runs east and west in search of emptiness and form,
unable to realize that form itself is emptiness.
So too is the world:
the mind races in pursuit of the true Dao,
not knowing that body and mind are the true Dao itself.
Now I proclaim this to you, that you may know.

Even the Three Clarities to come remain inseparable from afflictions.
Yet now you know the great Dao lies not in some distant realm.
Simply observe body and mind, cultivate the true Way,
and liberation arises of itself.

The mark of the true Dao is called "non-action":
no arising, no ceasing,
neither being nor non-being,
neither eternal nor annihilated,
neither great nor small,
neither form nor mind.
To take this as your model is to cultivate the true Way in right practice.

All that has been spoken above
comprises the true and authentic Dharma-words of the Three Branches,
serving as the ladder for all—devas, humans, ghosts, and spirits—to ascend in right cultivation.

Now, in accordance with the profound liturgy, we universally establish pure offerings,
widely propagating the most wondrous teachings to awaken those sunk in delusion.
We humbly pray that you, gathered in this assembly,
may arouse the mind of refuge, practice the pure conduct,
cut off the path of rebirth, and transcend the gate of liberation.
May you broadly accumulate meritorious deeds and advance toward the fruition of the Dao.

Yet we fear that you, not having purified the three karmic actions,
still remain veiled by the six senses,
unable to accord with the Dharma-words and thus difficult to transcend into the pure realm.
With compassion, we rely on the Most High,
whose boundless salvation is manifest—
who bestows the grand rites of refinement and deliverance,
and expounds the wondrous precepts of the Nine Perfected.

Imitating the non-dual nature, we gather qi and return to the true.
The soul ascends to the Nine Heavens, the spirit transcends the Three Realms.
Proceed according to the liturgical forms, proclaiming them in due order.
Now pause briefly at the numinous altar to await the opening of deliverance.

Next, rise and perform the dedication of merit:
The immeasurable roots of virtue from the offerings just made
shall aid and guide all spirits to accomplish the supreme Dao.
For this supreme cause, we invoke the inconceivable merit of
the Great Sagely Primordial Heavenly Worthy,
the Most High Great Dao Lord,
and the Most High Lord Lao.

Next, as prescribed, invite the descent of true water and true fire for the refinement and deliverance of souls.

The thirtieth fascicle of *The Complete Rites of the Supreme Yellow Register Great Fast* is concluded.

The thirty-first fascicle of *The Complete Rites of the Supreme Yellow Register Great Fast*
*Rites of the Upper Clarity Southern Palace for the Refinement and Deliverance of Suffering Souls*
Compiled by the Celestial Enforcer of the Law, Immortal Jiang Shuyu
Section on Liturgical Rites

First, place a square vessel in the northwest of the altar and erect a placard inscribed: *"Southern Palace Supreme Yin Water Refinement Pool."* Then, place a round vessel in the southeast of the altar and erect a placard inscribed: *"Southern Palace Supreme Yang Fire Refinement Pool."* Prepare in advance a vessel of yellow-flower divine water and charcoal fire of willow wood, placed beneath the altar. At the time of refinement and deliverance, the Dharma Master shall knock his teeth, visualize the spirits, and silently pay homage, beseeching the descent of the Most High’s true water and true fire into the refinement site.

Bow three times, offer three pinches of incense, and make the proclamation:

*"Your disciple, [Name], in full Dharma rank, humbly petitions the Patriarch, the Northern Pole Purple Tenuity Great Emperor, and the Patriarch, the Southern Pole Longevity Great Emperor. This lowly one, though a defiled corpse, dares to partake in the Dharma ranks, bearing the sacred scriptures and upholding the true teachings. To succor the living and deliver the dead, I fulfill my vows. I now lay bare my sincere heart, supplicating Your audience.*

*I prostrate myself on behalf of the patron, [Name], who, for the universal deliverance of the departed kin [Name], has convened this assembly of souls to establish the Supreme Yellow Register Great Fast. A universal offering of pure alms-food is set forth for the six destinies, the four modes of birth, the orphaned and lingering spirits, invoking the Most High’s compassion, vast and impartial, boundless and unobstructed. I beseech that, in accordance with the true rites, the rites of refinement and deliverance be proclaimed, that grace may be bestowed, suffering ended, and transcendence attained.*

*May Your celestial mercy deign to issue a sagely decree, commanding the Water and Fire Bureaus of the Southern Palace and the True Lords Governing the Five Peaks to descend the spiritual roots of yin and yang—true water and true fire—this very day and hour, into this altar ground, to refine and deliver the multitude of spirits. May their souls be purified, their myriad qi preserved whole, their forms restored in full, and their radiance rekindled. May they ascend through the Southern Palace’s ranks and transcend to the Heavenly Courts. Relying upon Your majestic might, may Your sagely grace perceive all. I prostrate myself in await of Your heavenly favor’s manifestation. This disciple, unable to contain his reverence, gazes toward the sacred with fervent longing, awaiting Your pardon."*

Next, the Dharma Master intones the ritual proceedings:

The Master visualizes the Primordial Sovereign of the Origin residing in the Mud-Pill Palace, now attended by the Nine-Flowered Perfected Ones and the assembled immortals, officials, and generals, all arrayed in solemn splendor, descending in radiant majesty.

The Master performs the Fire Pool Rite, pacing the Southern Dipper’s Fire Bell Mantra Steps to the fire pool, where the assembly recites the hidden incantation.

The Master encircles the fire pool in twelve positions, employing the Opening and Flowing Circulation Rite. He recites the *Purification of Heaven and Earth Spell* once, sprays water from his mouth, and blows it into the pool.

Proceeding as prescribed, he recites the *Establishing the Fire Pool Spell*:

*"By the Most High’s decree, sins are absolved, and beings delivered.
The six destinies and three paths all behold the light.
The fire pool is established, and they ascend in order.
Each according to their karma, all attain transcendence.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the Emperor commands!"*

He visualizes the Vermilion Mound’s raging fire flowing like molten gold, entering the fire pool from its southeast corner, its golden-green flames blazing fiercely. Drawing three breaths of noon qi, he blows them into the pool.

Holding the True Fire Unification Talisman, the Master forms the Descending True Fire Mudra, tracing from *yin* to *wu*. Silently, he intones:

*"Fiery spirits, fiery spirits, the Vermilion Bird soars.
With one divine fire, press upon bing and ding.
The Fiery Spirit Maidens wield the Emperor’s bell.
Samādhi’s true fire swiftly descends from the Vermilion Mound.
I act by the command of the Southern Pole Longevity Great Emperor!"*

Drawing noon qi, he blows upon the talisman and burns it in the pool. Secretly, he recites:

*"Southern Yan’s floating cavern, the flowing fire’s court.
Jade eyes gleaming, the flowing fire’s essence.
The sharp blade of Dhyāna’s wisdom, the divine youth of Vaṇī.
The flowing fire’s substance, the jade-eyed true visage.
Ascend into the Hall of Blessings, the Cavern-Yang’s palace."*

Facing east again, he draws the qi of the day’s sun and blows it forth.

Next, he commands the Fire Pool Attendants, the Refinement and Deliverance Officials, the Divine Youths, and the Solar Essence of Midday to swiftly descend into the pool and await, guiding the orphaned souls into the fire pool to refine their forms according to the Dharma.

*"Swiftly, swiftly!"*

The Master visualizes the Flowing Fire Divine Court, boundless in its expanse.

Above stands the Vermilion Mansion of the Southern Numinous Prefecture, its towers and pavilions rising in solemn array. Within its courts, the fire shines with a golden-green hue, its flames crowned with golden bells that ascend in flickering ascent.

The Master performs the Water Pool Rite, pacing the Mystic Pivot of the Northern Dipper to reach the water pool. The assembly chants in veiled speech. The Master circles the twelve positions around the water pool, employing the *Opening, Releasing, Retaining, and Communing* method. Silently, he recites the *Purification of Heaven and Earth Incantation* once, then sprays a mouthful of water into the pool. Having completed the ritual proceedings, he intones the *Water Pool Construction Spell*:

*"By the Supreme Decree, sins are absolved and beings delivered.
The six destinies and three woeful paths all behold the radiant light.
The water pool is established, and they ascend in due order.
Each according to their karmic retribution, all attain liberation.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the August Emperor commands!"*

He visualizes the waters of the Celestial River and Eastern Well flowing into the water pool from its northwest corner, limpid and serene. Drawing a breath of northwest qi, he blows it into the pool.

Holding the *True Water Unification Talisman*, the Master forms the *Descending True Water Mudra* and extends it to the *zi* hour. Silently, he recites:

*"Great Yin, Great Yin, essence of the Dark Warrior.
With one descent of divine water, it connects to the *gui* and *ren* stems.
Celestial true nectar, radiant chamber of the Upper Clarity.
The Primordial Beginning Venerable Lord, the Life-Cherishing Lord Han.
The numinous root of true water swiftly descends to the Pivot Prefecture.
I, in accordance with the Purple Tenuity Northern Pivot August Emperor’s statutes and decrees, command!"*

Drawing northern qi, he blows upon the talisman and sinks it into the water pool. Secretly, he recites:

*"The mirrorless pool, abyss of divine dragons.
Conveying the splendor of the Eastern Well to cleanse the orphaned souls.
Gathering their bearing and refining their forms, the essence of Great Harmony.
The Jade Maidens of Mystic Harmony pour it into their spirits.
Souls and spirits clarified and rectified, the Dao’s qi endures forever."*

Facing west again, he draws the true qi of the day’s moon and blows it forth.

Next, he commands the Water Pool Attendants, the Form-Purifying Officials, the Divine Youths, and the Numinous Root of the Moon’s Yellow Splendor to swiftly descend into the pool and await, guiding the orphaned souls into the water pool to purify their essences and cleanse their forms according to the Dharma.

*"Swiftly, swiftly!"*

The Master visualizes the Celestial River and Eastern Well, boundless in their expanse.

The waters are pure, luminous, and radiant, with celestial palaces above, their towers and pavilions standing in solemn array.

Next, the Dharma Master proceeds to the refining and deliverance site. The Master approaches the incense seat, visualizing the transformation as prescribed. *Incense for the Return of Spirits* rises, its smoke curling into talismanic script. All heavens and earths are suffused with billowing fragrance. Qi is entrusted and merits gathered; orphaned souls receive refinement. All sentient beings ascend together to the Dao’s shore.

The Dharma-ranked minister [Name] burns incense and reverently invokes the Three Clarities and Three Realms, the Ten Poles and Ten Florals, the Most High Sovereign of Salvation from Suffering, the Great Emperor of Longevity, the true lords of the Three Provinces and Five Offices, the Vermilion Numinous Fire Palace, the Southern Prosperity Upper Palace, the sacred assembly of the Numinous Treasure refining and deliverance, and all divine immortals within and beyond the Three Realms. May the jade wheels and feathered canopies briefly descend from the layered heavens; may the Dharma rain and merciful clouds extend over the hidden earth. Grant this minister the power to perform deliverance and universally succor the submerged and lost. Humbly beseeching the radiance of grace above, and the witness of proof below. This minister offers utmost reverence in prayer.

The seat is arrayed, and the Master visualizes the auspicious smoke of the Celestial Gate, propitious qi and cloudy hues, rosy light dazzling and resplendent. In heart and sight appear the Three Treasures’ merciful lords, the Azure Mystery Emperor, all heavenly great sages, and every immortal spirit—brilliant and majestic in their descent.

You, divine and mighty, swiftly and reverently comply with the primordial teachings, summoning from the ten directions, the boundless empty realms, the Six Paths and Four Births, the owned and ownerless, all orphaned, stagnant, imprisoned, and suffering souls—assemble at the numinous altar to reverently receive refinement and deliverance. Each assumes their office to gather qi, harmonizing form and spirit. Refine their essences to congeal the true; ascend as immortals and awaken to the Dao.

*As swiftly as the flowing fire’s decree!*

The Master visualizes the aforementioned officials and clerks, their bearing solemn and majestic, arrayed to left and right. The souls receiving deliverance all stand beneath the altar.

**The Heavenly Worthy Who Pervades and Transforms the Three Realms.**

**Next, the Fire Refinement:**
Holding the True Fire’s united talisman, the Master proclaims the incantation for summoning true fire, forming the *wu* mudra:

The Eight Sceneries’ jade tones guard the form and direct the talisman.
Summon the numinous to achieve the true; the talismanic marshals seize the souls.

Bathe the thousand spirits.

All receive form.

The Three Heavens nurture the embryo,
The Nine Qi coalesce the spirit.
Above transforms the Mysterious Elixir,
Below revolves to become immortal.
The Two Images intermingle and merge,
Thereby completing your body.
The Six Glories of the Jade Luminance,
The Nine Palaces receive the Perfected.
The Twelve Knotted Nodes,
Each severs its root.
Expel the defiled qi,
The Five Numinous array in formation.
The Mysterious Woman exhales her essence,
Refining and transforming into radiant splendor.
The Golden Immortals wing the numinous,
The Jade Splendor knits the stanzas.
Record your name in the Azure Palace,
Ever preserving the Lord of Dawn’s command.

Swiftly, swiftly, as the Lord Emperor of Imperishable Life decrees!

The vermilion script of Jade Purity ascends to commune with the Purple Court.
Heaven’s compassion grants absolution; the numinous spirits of the Three Realms,
The ten directions’ worlds, the sinful souls of the Nine Nether-realms,
The myriad ancestors of countless generations, the suffering shades and wandering essences—
Erase their names from the ledgers of sin, sever the roots of evil.
Hasten to the realm of rebirth, where qi and consciousness abide in tranquil repose.
Ascend to the Heavenly Hall, refine the essence and temper the spirit.
Transcend the Five Sufferings, the true heart luminous and clear.
Sweep away the shadows of Yin, enter the Dao and ascend to perfection.

Swiftly, swiftly, as the Lord Emperor of Imperishable Life decrees!

Burn the talisman, draw the primordial qi, and blow it into the Water Pool. Visualize the orphaned souls’ bodies suffused with jade light, radiant and resplendent, their forms dignified and majestic, clad in beloved immortal robes.

The Perfected One of Perfect Treasure and Rounded Splendor.

The master silently recites the incantation for delivering souls:
*Xingsheng, Duli, Kehan, Gongdu, Baohun Yinghun She.*

Burn the talisman for summoning the Generals of the Six Dings and Six Jias, the Golden Lads and Jade Maidens. As the refinement and deliverance of merits are now complete, reverently summon the Great Generals of the Six Dings and Six Jias, the Golden Lads and Jade Maidens, to swiftly escort the refined orphaned souls. Let each compose their appearance and demeanor, and reverently proceed before the August Emperor’s throne to offer thanks for Heaven’s grace, receive the precepts and transmit the talismans, ascend to perfection, and attain deliverance by rank.

The ritual assembly, with utmost sincerity, requests to proceed with the welcoming and guiding. The assembly chants the hidden verses, leading the souls to pay homage.

Next, descending from the seat, the *Lingbao Rite of the Great Fast for Transmitting Talismans and Conferring Precepts*

The Dharma Master approaches the incense and prays, saying:
Reverently summon the boundless worlds of the ten directions, all spirits now present to receive deliverance. You have, since the vast kalpas, planted the roots of suffering, enduring this cycle of rebirth without respite. Now the jade altar’s rites are complete, and the precious models proclaimed. A summons is issued to the hidden and the manifest, gathering the six destinies like motes of dust; spirits soar through the empty vast, entreating the true chariots of the Nine Pures. Relying on the Dao’s compassion, may all departed souls universally transcend. Let pure offerings quench the ever-burning fires of hunger, and Dharma waters cleanse the defiled forms of sin. Refine the true essence, smelt away the shadows of yin, for this expedient teaching bends even the Most High’s majesty to condescend. Having arrived at the Dao altar, you must each compose yourselves with reverence. Receive the talismans and precepts in solemn return. Past transgressions are now pardoned; henceforth, cultivate good fruits with ever greater care. Let steadfast faith repay the virtue of creation.

All ghostly and divine assemblies, submitting in reverence, bow twice in gratitude to Heaven’s grace.

The *Ling Shu* is raised, guiding the assembled souls to the place of precept-bestowal. The Dao assembly stands in order, each with utmost respect.

The Master approaches the seat, holding the censer of incense, and invokes:
Today, the Dao altar is pure, and all present unite in mind. We dedicate this to the six paths of beings before us—orphaned souls and lingering spirits, all assembled spirits. We bow in reverence to entreat the Three Primes of the Great Void, the Seven Perfected of the Empty Realm, the Boundless Wondrous Dao, the Nine Qi of Cavernous Spirit, the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning in his infinite manifestations, the great sages and lords of the ten directions, the thirty-six Heavenly Emperors, the Five Masters of Lingbao, the numinous immortals of Heaven and Earth, the sun, moon, and stars, the Four Controllers and Five Emperors, the mighty spirits of the Three Realms. May they deign to receive our plea, respond with radiant grace, descend into this Dao altar, and witness the conferral of precepts. We beseech your wisdom and blessings, that Heaven’s grace may abundantly flow, universally reaching all beings, that all may ascend to the Dao’s fruit.

*The Celestial Worthies of Lingbao in the Ten Directions*

The Dharma Master ascends the seat:
By the power of the Dao, I now serve as your great preceptor. I call to mind your countless kalpas of disbelief in the Great Dao, your failure to awaken to the true vehicle. Some have sinned through the three karmas, others erred through the six senses; some harbored inner perversity, others were stained by external defilements. From the three poisons arose one hundred and eight afflictions; from the six emotions sprang eighty-four thousand toils of dust and suffering. Through kalpas you have revolved, unaware and unenlightened, long mired in the bitter destinies, with no hope of liberation. The Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning, in his great sagacity and compassion, mindful of all, divided his form and scattered his light. Descending into the Nine Darks, his majestic radiance illuminated the suffering, and he addressed the four assemblies: “Listen well, for I now proclaim for you the Nine Wondrous Precepts of the True Ones and the Golden Register’s White Tablet. The merit of upholding them delivers from peril and relieves suffering—its divine power is beyond thought.”

The spirits bow their heads, humbly receiving the teaching.

Now, in accordance with the mysterious statutes, we transmit them before the sacred. You must receive them with single-minded devotion, never to forget.

*The Celestial Worthy of Compassionate Precept-Proclamation*

First: respect and deference, filial piety toward parents.
Second: diligence and loyalty to one’s lord.
Third: no killing, compassionate salvation of beings.
Fourth: no licentiousness, rectifying the body in its place.
Fifth: no theft, yielding to righteousness and diminishing the self.
Sixth: no wrath, lest fury harm others.
Seventh: no deceit, lest flattery and treachery injure the good.
Eighth: no arrogance, lest pride scorn the true and real.
Ninth: no duality, upholding the precepts with singular devotion.

The Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning, having proclaimed these precepts, through the power of his compassion and wisdom universally bestows them upon the living and the dead. Spirits awaken to understanding, each generating good thoughts. All suffering dissolves, body and mind at peace. All arouse the Dao-mind, abiding in non-retrogression.

Today, as we transmit the precepts and grant the registers and deliverance talismans, we pray that the Three Treasures and the Venerable Masters will together witness and deliver. May the Youths Who Examine Fate, the Mighty Spirits Who Guard the Precepts, the Direct Talismans of the Five Emperors, and the officials of the Six Palaces follow and protect, enlighten and elevate. Let names be inscribed in the Jade Purity, recorded in the Golden Registers, swiftly attaining the Dao’s fruit and forever transcending the wheel of suffering.

The *Precious Registers and Numinous Talismans* are now solemnly proclaimed.

Proclaim the *Talisman of Longevity*
Proclaim the *Talisman for Salvation from Suffering*

The Dharma Master visualizes the Celestial Emperor, commanding the Golden Lads and Jade Maidens to bear the registers and tablets, descending on golden light from the Heavenly Gate. The Master takes the tablet and passes it over the incense, praying:

The Primordial Sage on High, the Lofty Numinous Jade Emperor,
By jade script proclaims the mandate, delivering the dead and saving the living.
The wondrous precepts of the Golden Register protect and succor the hidden realms.
The White Tablet and precious talismans, the Nine Perfected Immortals’ scriptures,
Dissolve transgressions, reconcile karmic debts.
The True Person Who Saves from Suffering erases all guilt and punishment.
The Youths Who Examine Fate inscribe names for rebirth.
The Mighty Spirits Who Guard the Precepts guide them to the courts of blessing.
Transcending the Five Sufferings, they ride cloud chariots,
Turn the wheel to attain the Dao, and ascend to the Upper Purity.

Proclaim the *Precious Register for Ascending to Heaven*
The Dharma Master takes the register and passes it over the incense, praying:

By the Celestial Worthy’s talismanic mandate, at this very moment, ascend and advance.

At the Northern Capital’s Frigid Pool, the ranks guard the bodily souls.
They restrain demons and ensure promotion, advancing them to the Southern Palace’s ranks.
The dead souls undergo refinement, transformed by immortals into perfected beings.
Those whose living bodies receive the transmission endure through kalpas everlasting,
Revolving with the kalpic wheel, their years equaling Heaven’s.
Forever delivered from the Three Paths, the Five Sufferings, and the Eight Adversities,
They transcend the Three Realms, roaming freely in the Upper Purity.

**Prayer over the Talismanic Register**
May all beings of the Six Paths and Four Births, the lonely souls and lingering spirits,
Upon receiving and upholding this register, have their names inscribed on the Purple Tablet,
Their lives transmitted to the Vermilion Numinosity.
Great sins dissolved in the Nine Dark Realms, they are plucked from the Earth’s Gates;
Swiftly ascending beyond the Three Realms, unbound by Heaven’s Portals.
Yet they must be summoned again by celestial immortals, specially escorted and guarded.
Let all take heed.

**Summoning the Escort Officers**
We reverently summon the celestial officers and generals of the various Dharma courts,
The attending merit officials, the Great Generals of the Six Dings and Six Jias,
The Golden Lads and Jade Maidens, the Thunder Gods on duty,
To carry out the ritual teachings and universally deliver the submerged souls.
Let them listen to the Dharma, hear the scriptures, receive talismans, and accept the precepts.
Now that the ritual is roughly complete, the time for escort has arrived.
We temporarily lend our majestic authority to strictly guard and deliver them,
That none remain detained, and all swiftly attain transcendence.
The written decree is as follows, and shall be executed accordingly.

**Proclaiming the Decree**
The August Emperor descends in transformation, mindful of those with karmic affinity.
The Numinous Treasure bestows its teachings, delivering countless beings.
Thus are the departed of the dark paths bathed in the radiant grace of the Great Dao.
Names inscribed on golden tablets, ranks conferred in the Vermilion Palace.
Through the distant cloud thoroughfares, their feathered sleeves flutter.
Forever severed from the wheel of rebirth, they bid farewell to the altar and depart.
May they follow their vows to be reborn in the presence of the Heavenly Worthy.

**Rising and Turning Toward**
We have just performed this for the Great Register’s chief patron, so-and-so,
Universally dedicating it to the deceased kin, so-and-so,
And universally delivering all souls present—the Six Paths, Four Births, lonely souls, and lingering spirits.
May all these merits be fully perfected.
May the primal grace grant our sincere prayers,
That all attain the fruit of the Dao and never again fall into the delusions of the dusty world.

Ascend the Dharma Bridge with measured steps, swiftly reach the Dao’s shore.
The Three Torments cease their reckoning, the Nine Nights end their bitterness.
May all beings in the Dharma Realm dwell in harmony and acceptance.
May all under heaven awaken to the Dao and cultivate the True.
May this servant forever abide beneath the Dao’s shelter.
For these most excellent merits, we invoke:
Jade Purity’s Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Origin,
High Purity’s Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy,
Grand Purity’s Heavenly Worthy of Dao and Virtue,
Heavenly Worthy of Great Unity Who Saves from Suffering,
Heavenly Worthy Who Delivers from the Nine Hells,
Heavenly Worthy Who Crosses to Vermilion Radiance,
Heavenly Worthy of the Cinnabar Realm’s Alchemical Fire,
Heavenly Worthy of the Golden Portal’s Transformation,
Heavenly Worthy of the Wheel-Turning Sacred King,
Heavenly Worthy Who Grants Rebirth According to Vows,
Heavenly Worthy of Carefree Bliss,
Heavenly Worthy of Jewel Flower Perfection.
Boundless, inconceivable merits.

Proceeding beyond the gate, transform the petitions, talismans, and registers.
The Dharma Master performs the deliverance rite, reciting the *Fanjian* ode:
May the souls be purified and upright, their myriad qi enduring forever.
May they know no suffering, their bodies suffused with radiance.
When merits are fulfilled and virtue perfected, they shall ascend to High Purity in carefree ease.
Swiftly, swiftly, by the decree of the Emperor of Eternal Life.

Silently recite the *Huasheng* incantation:
Rise and gather, solitary souls—*Kěhán* summons you.
Accomplish the assembly of souls—swiftly, swiftly, by the Celestial Emperor’s decree.

Silently recite the *Huadie* incantation:
Blazing flames of the Fire Bell, above and below, in the eight directions.
Ten thousand spirits stand guard, forever severing misfortune.
Swiftly, swiftly, by the law of the Cinnabar Heaven’s Fire Bell.

Envision the Fire Bell filling the earth, resplendent as the sun, spanning heaven and earth.
The delivered souls ascend, borne away upon golden light.
Heavenly Worthy of Jewel Flower Perfection.

The deliverance rites performed thus far are now complete.
Again, relying on the pure assembly, for the sake of these karmic conditions, we invoke:
Great Sage Primordial Heavenly Worthy,
Supreme Lord of the Great Dao,
Most High Lord Lao.
Inconceivable merits.

**Numinous Treasure Rite of Life Release**
When Daoists release lives themselves or perform the rite for others, the text may be adapted accordingly.
Prepare the site for life release by arranging a table.
The Master and the assembly proceed to the table, first offering incense and striking the teeth three times.
The incense is kindled.

Supreme Three Heavens Mysterious Primordial Three Qi Most High Lord Lao, summon forth from within this servant’s body the Three and Five Merit Officers, the Left and Right Attendant Envoys, the Left and Right Incense-Bearing Dragon-Riding Couriers, the Incense-Holding Golden Lads, the Message-Transmitting Jade Maidens, and the Five Thearchs’ Direct Talismans and Daily Incense Officials—thirty-six of each—forthwith. Notify this place’s earth spirits and local deities, the true officials and rightful gods. This servant now, on behalf of so-and-so, establishes the Supreme Yellow Register Grand Fast to aid and deliver the soul of so-and-so, the rites of which have now been fully performed. At this moment of burning incense and releasing lives, may the qi of the Most High’s Ten Directions Orthodox Perfected enter this servant’s body, that this petition swiftly ascend before the Most High’s Boundless Dao Supreme Perfected Jade Thearch.

Petition:
This duly ordained servant so-and-so respectfully petitions the Most High’s Boundless Dao and the Ten Directions’ Perfected, the Accomplished Great Sages, the Fusang Great Thearch Lord of Yang Valley, the Divine Kings of Cave Source and Abyssal Depths, the Great Spirits of Mingling, the Three Rivers and Four Seas, the Nine Jiang Water Thearchs, the Twelve Huai and Ji River Lords, the River Earls and Marquises; the Two Thousand Piculs of the Yellow River’s Lady of Clear Waters, the Water Palace Divine Immortals and Perfected Spirits, and all the deities of this lake, land, and locality. This servant, by good fortune and karmic conditions of past lives, has endured the kalpas of the Nine Heavens to reach this present body. Having encountered the scriptural teachings, I revere and uphold the Three Treasures. Though ordained in the Great Vehicle, I reflect upon my own impurities and unworthiness. Yet from the day of receiving this mandate, I have pledged to cultivate and propagate the wondrous Dharma, to extol the winds of benevolence, that the sun’s numinous radiance may illumine the Nine Netherworlds, and the Primordial Beginning’s compassionate grace may universally extend to all beings. Creation nurtures all things, and the myriad forms flourish. Though human and non-human differ in form, all alike receive the primordial qi. All living kinds yearn for wholeness. Yet in this age, the Dao declines while perversity and evil flourish. People, greedy and turbid, devour living beings. Birds, beasts, fish, and turtles are made their sustenance. Trapped and captured on land and water, their numbers are beyond reckoning. Now the fast’s sponsor, so-and-so, moved by karmic retribution, establishes this grand fast, donating personal wealth to ransom lives, fostering and protecting them, ensuring their universal well-being. Released into clear springs, may this merit aid the unseen blessings. If Daoists release lives themselves, they should follow the original statutes and add accordingly: According to the scriptural texts, releasing lives to deliver the dead takes precedence in cultivation. This servant, leading the assembly, reverently performs these rites without negligence. Moreover, the devout laymen and laywomen so-and-so and others, compassionate toward all beings and devoted to good causes, [join in this endeavor].

Each contributes their wealth to purchase turtles and fish, following this servant to arrive at the clear depths. Together we release them, returning them to the source of life. If no one joins the assembly to release lives, omit the phrase "Moreover, the devout laymen and laywomen so-and-so and others."

As the statutes of Celestial Master Lu originally contain this passage, I dare not delete it: may they transcend calamities, escape suffering and distress, all bathe in life’s wholeness, and forever enjoy primordial auspiciousness. May this merit universally flow to all heavenly beings, the seven generations of parents, the emperor and kings, dukes and the myriad commoners.

If Daoists release lives themselves, they should follow the original statutes and add accordingly: as well as this servant’s precept-master, parents, fellow disciples, worthy recluses in the mountains, Daoist officials, Orthodox Unity disciples, friends, acquaintances, the six relations, all winged insects and creeping things, those that crawl and gasp for breath, the spirits of the heavens and hells, the earth-prisons and the Five Peaks and Four Waterways, the suffering souls and wandering shades, the imprisoned and those burdened by labor—may they all be freed and dispersed, delivered from evil destinies, and ascend together to the realm of non-action.

May the heavens be lofty and clear, winds harmonious and rains timely, sun and moon radiant, stars arrayed in order. May the earth be level and upright, mountains and forests lush, waterways unobstructed, and the five grains abundant.

May the sovereign’s virtue expand boundlessly, his majestic presence vast and awe-inspiring. May the imperial teachings shine with clarity, gazed upon by all under heaven. May the people embrace righteousness and deference, and rival states cease their strife. May the six barbarian tribes submit as guests, and heresies and evils never arise. May rivers and seas be full, and sages and worthies be born daily. May wealth be shared in generosity, and clothing and sustenance come naturally. May men be of lofty talent, and women of chaste virtue. May none take up lost items on the road, and the Dao and its power flourish. May schools and academies thrive, with each guiding the other to enlightenment. May bodies be offered in alms, and fields of merit widely established. May the sorrowful and suffering be dispersed, extending to all living beings. May this disciple’s seven generations of ancestors ascend to the heavens, their embryonic forms reborn, soaring through the skies. May they be reborn among the chosen people, free from care or calamity. May the radiance of sun and moon be equal, delivering all from hardship. May they be delivered in every generation, and blessings extend to their descendants. May this servant, having attained the true Dao, ascend to heaven in broad daylight.

Respectfully submitted.

*Recite and ponder the verses of the* Micro-Determination of Will Sutra, *the hymn of the Perfected of the Great Ultimate:*

O worthy one, do not kill,
nor even harbor the thought of killing.
Though creatures may be small,
all delight in growth and life.
How can you take their lives
to nourish your own?
Such nourishment lasts but a moment,
yet binds you to the natural consequences.
Long mired in the Three Paths,
you suffer and return again.
Good and evil each have their causes,
as echo follows call.
Why not change this conduct,
rewarding yourself with a heart of compassion?
Hand in hand with the Perfected, roam,
carefree, observing the floating world.

*Right One*

Though the Great Dao has no intent,
it may be sought with feeling.
I halt my chariot in the hollow vastness,
gazing back at the veiled, surging currents.
Beyond the Three Realms, in purity and brightness,
I wander the jade capital in solitude.
Without the mysterious impetus of fate,
who could grasp the hidden truth?
The Milky Way shines clear and distant,
lofty and low, all is empty and yielding.
The Seven Mysteries scatter the dark night,
and the unborn drift with the tides.
If the hidden term quietly congeals,
the Yang’s nine calamities bring no joy or sorrow.
Witnessing these meetings and partings,
time and again I linger.
By forsaking the body, the body endures—
true immortals gather with their kind.

*Right Two*

The profound path lies within the mysterious,
deep and still as the Han’s clear waves.
Change and decay turn like a wheel,
yet the camphor’s branches never alter.
Still the heart and contemplate the Perfect,
flowing with fate, departing the net of separation.
Response and resonance follow principle,
the spirit’s ease extends even to the ancestors.
Wandering in simplicity, without bounds,
myriad thoughts dissolve into the nine distances.
Flying roots scatter dark leaves,
principle returns—there is nothing else.
Ever recite the jade scriptures,
their mysterious tones piercing the clouds and rosy dawn.
When the *jiashen* flood disaster arrives,
I soar on wings to the Queen Mother’s abode.
Forever enjoying boundless ages,
who knows how many kalpas have passed?

*Right Three*

**Next: Releasing Lives and Restoring the Incense Burner**

*End of Volume Thirty-One of the* Supreme Yellow Register Great Fast Established Rites.
*Beginning of Volume Thirty-Two of the* Supreme Yellow Register Great Fast Established Rites.

Transmitted by Master of the Three Caverns, Chongjing, and bequeathed by Master Liu Yongguang to the Celestial Enforcer of the Most High, Jiang Shuyu, for compilation.

**Section on Fast Rites and Their Application**

*Explanation of the Dragon’s Radiance*

The *Lower Prime Yellow Register Simplified Writs of the Spirit-Immortal Rank* states: For the威仪 of extracting and delivering sinful roots, one should craft ten golden dragons to镇 the ten directions. To deliver sinful souls, place one in each of the ten directions. Present the ten-directional silk offerings as tokens: ninety *chi* of green-patterned silk for the east (or nine *chi*), thirty *chi* of crimson-patterned silk for the south (or three *chi*), seventy *chi* of white-patterned silk for the west (or seven *chi*), fifty *chi* of black-patterned silk for the north (or five *chi*). For the four corners, use yellow-patterned silk, each one hundred twenty *chi* (or twelve *chi*). For the upper direction, thirty-two *chi* of azure-patterned silk; for the lower, thirty *chi* of yellow-patterned silk. According to each direction’s color, arrange them in the ten directions to deliver the souls of the eternal night.

The host presents silk corresponding to their life-destiny, varying by year. The Son of Heaven and feudal lords use purple silk, emulating celestial patterns. Commoners use the color of their life-destiny’s proper direction, placing it at the center to deliver their year and fate, ensuring all is refined and wondrous. The Son of Heaven’s offering is measured in *pi*; feudal lords in *zhang*; commoners in *chi*. Rank determines the measure, all following the luminous statutes.

The Flying Celestial Divine Persons declare: Those who violate this shall be examined by the Heavenly Officials of the Mysterious Capital Bureau.

*Explanation of Ascending the Altar*

Whenever entering the oratory to ascend the altar, rinse the mouth with fragrant water, called "dispelling defilement." Upon exiting, rinse again, called "sealing the true *qi*." After arranging the offerings, first have two Daoist adepts proceed as威仪, leading the master and disciples to ascend the altar. They circumambulate the outer altar once, stopping at the southeast corner. The master recites the *Entering the Door Spell*, then leads the disciples in order through the Earth Gate to ascend the central altar. The威仪 remain circling the outer altar and do not enter the central altar. One威仪 is stationed on each side of every altar. After three circumambulations, they stand on the four sides. When stepping in emptiness and circling, they proceed to the northwest corner. The master ascends the inner altar through the Heavenly Gate, turning left three times, offering incense to the ten directions once. Then, offering incense at the imperial desk, they retreat to the west, standing facing east. The disciples circumambulate the central altar once, then stand in order and perform the rites as prescribed. The disciples lead the master out of the altar, passing before the master, who follows behind.

In establishing fasts and erecting altars, emulate heaven and earth. The inner altar is entered and exited through the Heavenly Gate; the central altar through the Earth Gate. Whenever entering the altar, the master leads the disciples through the Earth Gate, the master preceding, disciples following. Whenever exiting the altar, the disciples lead the master out through the Earth Gate, disciples preceding, the master following.

*Hymns of China and Their Explanations*

Diligently uphold fasts and precepts,
recite scriptures to restrain the six emotions.
Thus one rides the void and soars,
radiant above the Jade Clarity.

With focused mind, uphold the scriptural teachings,
refine the five spirits through exhalation and inhalation.
Virtue crowns the heavens,
turning the wheel to become an Upper Immortal.

*From the* Numinous Treasure Jade Casket Covenant of the True Scripture.

Master Du Guangcheng says: Now only the eighteen empty sounds are used. Today, even these are abandoned.

*The Morning Entering the Door Spell*

The Dharma Master turns to the left of the Earth Gate, strikes the teeth three times, and recites the secret incantation.

*Night Entering the Door Spell (partial)*
According to Laozi’s *Visualization Diagram*, visualize the following: one Attendant of the Four Luminaries, one Messenger for Communicating with the True, two Jade Maidens for Transmitting Words, and two Jade Maidens for Pacifying Attendance—six in total.
The Attendant of the Four Luminaries,
the Messenger for Communicating with the True.
The Jade Lads for Transmitting Words,
the Jade Maidens for Pacifying Attendance.
Convey my words to the deities of the Dao chamber.
The primordial qi of the Upper Prime enters my body.

Upon completion of the prayer, enter the door with the left foot first.

*Morning Exiting the Door Spell*
After exiting the Earth Gate, turn to face the altar, strike the teeth three times, and recite the prayer while visualizing one Jade Maiden:
Exiting the yin to enter the yang,
the myriad spirits open and clear.
Once the affairs at the Pass are concluded,
request the closing of the Yellow Chamber.
The Jade Maidens for Pacifying Attendance
illumine and prepare the divine palace.

Upon completion of the prayer, exit the door with the right foot first.

*Night Entering the Door Spell*
According to Laozi’s *Visualization Diagram*, visualize the following: one Attendant of the Four Upper Ones, one Dragon-Tiger Messenger, one Plain Maiden for Pacifying Attendance, one Luminous Lad, and one Maiden of the Upper Mystery—six in total.
The Attendant of the Four Upper Ones,
the Dragon-Tiger Messenger.
The primordial qi of the Orthodox Unity,
the Plain Maiden for Pacifying Attendance.
For matters to be reported at night,
the Luminous Lad.
The Maiden of the Upper Mystery enters with me.
Within the Yellow Palace,
all that is conveyed shall be heard above.

*Night Exiting the Door Spell*
After exiting the Earth Gate, turn to face the altar, strike the teeth three times, and recite the prayer while visualizing one Maiden:
The Great Yin of the Mysterious Upper,
the eight windows open and brighten.
For matters to be reported,
the Maiden communicates the numinous.
Once the affairs are concluded and positions restored,
the myriad spirits withdraw in tranquility.

*From* The Incense-Burning Rituals, *in* The Upper Prime Golden Register Precepts of the Perfected Immortals.

*Offering Incense to the Ten Directions*
At dawn and midday, incense is first offered to the east, then southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest, north, northeast, below, and above.
At night, incense is first offered to the north, then northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest, below, and above.

*From* The Fasting and Incense-Offering Rituals, *according to* The Original Precepts of the Numinous Treasure:
At midday, begin with the east, then proceed to south, west, north, northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest, above, and below. Here, however, the order begins with the southeast, then east, following the sequence of the *Golden Register Precepts* for the Ritual of Deliverance from Sinful Roots. For the present *Golden Register Fast*, the original scripture is followed.

Master Zhang Wanfu of the Pure Capital’s *Ritual for the Celestial Master’s Fast* states that the order for ascending the altar to offer incense is the same as the first.
The Ritual of Deliverance from Sinful Roots is based entirely on the *Golden Register Precepts of the Perfected Immortals and Transcendents*. It is an ancient text from the Dragon Han era and must not be altered.

*Incense-Offering Spell*
After the Dharma Master has offered incense to the ten directions, he approaches the imperial desk, offers incense three times, and recites the secret incantation:
Jade blossoms scatter radiance,
the nine qi contain mist.
Fragrant clouds densely woven,
directly ascend the nine heavens.
The Golden Lad for Attending Incense,
the Jade Maiden for Transmitting Words.
Report before the Emperor,
granting your servant long life.
For all generations to come, as a divine immortal,
all that is petitioned and desired shall be fulfilled as spoken.

*From* The Great Cavern Scripture of Supreme Purity: *The Scripture’s Incense-Offering Spell* omits the phrase "the Golden Lad for Attending Incense," and "the Jade Maiden for Transmitting Words" is rendered as "the Jade Maiden for Attending Incense." "That which is petitioned" is written as "that which is directed," and "shall be fulfilled" as "shall not fail."

First, the officiant visualizes with focused reverence:
Within the Heavenly Treasure Terrace, the Three Supreme Ones are seated. To their left, the thirty-six divisions of sacred scriptures; to their right, the Great Master of the Mysterious Center. The Ten Perfected and Five Emperors, hosts of immortals in attendance, arrayed as in the grand assembly for the audience of the True.

The officiant closes his eyes and visualizes the Three Supreme Ones descending through the void, flanked by the Lords of the Dragon and Tiger, a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, the honored spirits of the Three Realms, and hosts of perfected beings in attendance, all arrayed in their seats. The master, on behalf of the disciple, presents the intent of the retreat.

Next, he visualizes the Scripture Master, the Master of the Numinous Treasure of Supreme Purity, Lord Zhan, whose personal name is Qi, with the courtesy name Ji Zhong, who propagated the Dao in Changsha. He bows in his heart three times and prays: "May the master attain the immortal Dao, and may I be elevated and delivered."

Next, he visualizes the Register Master, the Master of the Three Caverns of Supreme Purity, Lord Tian, whose personal name is Jushi, with the courtesy name Ruoxu, born on the second day of the fifth month of the jia-yin year in Changsha’s Zhenyan. He propagated the Dao in the Two Zhe regions. He bows in his heart three times and prays: "May the master attain flying immortality, open the path of deliverance for me, and may my seven generations of ancestors ascend early to the heavenly halls. May I attain the perfection of the Dao and ascend into the formless."

Next, he visualizes the Initiation Master, the Master of the Three Caverns of Supreme Purity, Lord Liu, whose personal name is Yongguang, with the courtesy name Daohui, born at the xū hour on the twenty-fifth day of the third month of the jia-yin year, a native of Guixi in Xinzhou. In the bing-yin year of the Kaixi era, on the Heavenly Offering Day, he transformed and ascended at the Supreme Purity Palace on Mount Longhu, having propagated the Dao in Jinghu, Jiang, and Zhe. He bows in his heart three times and prays: "May the master attain elevation and deliverance, ascend to the ranks of the lofty immortals, open the path of deliverance for me, and may the five destinies and eight difficulties be overcome, my name entered in the immortal registers, and I forever become a perfected person."

According to *The Divine Immortals’ Section of the Middle Prime Registers of the Five Registers*: "The ritual propriety for honoring the masters: the Scripture Master is the origin of the scriptures, and thus should be revered. The Three Ancestors’ lineage begins here. The Register Master is the master of the Initiation Master, and thus should be revered three times, for from him come the registers of life and death. The Initiation Master is the master from whom one receives the scriptures, who delivers one from the five destinies’ difficulties, and thus should be revered. One who studies the Dao without honoring the Three Masters will find the Three Treasures not descending, the Three Realms not respecting, and demonic spirits harming the body."

Master Du Guangcheng said: "Scripture (經) means ‘distant.’ Among the Three Masters, the Scripture Master is the distant master, the master of the Register Master, and one’s ancestral master. Register (籍) means ‘cause.’ The transmission of the true and the study of the Dao depend on the mutual causation of master and disciple; he is the disciple of the Scripture Master and the master of the Initiation Master. Initiation (度) means ‘advancement.’ He delivers my mortal body and advances me to the ranks of the Dao. From the beginning to this point, none is without dependence on the master; he is one’s own master. The direction of their abode is the place where they reside. In the heart’s bow, one visualizes their appearance, personal names, and titles, and reveres them with prayers. The reason for revering the master is that the methods I practice, which open the path of deliverance for heaven and humanity, depend on the master’s instruction to reach this point. In all acts of cultivation and devotion, one first reveres the master, not forgetting the root. In ancient times, scriptures were received from masters, so when burning incense during a retreat, one necessarily revered the master. The methods of retreats derive from the divine scriptures, so establishing a retreat takes the veneration of the scriptures as its foundation. The retreat’s regulations speak of the Three Masters’ covenant to receive the Three Treasures’ divine scriptures, offering reverence and cultivation—this is the essence of the retreat’s observance. In the present age, scriptures are not received from masters, and the methods of retreats have also declined. Those who establish retreats, if they have not covenanted to receive the precious scriptures—such as those referred to in the regulations as the *Golden Writ of Supreme Purity and the Three Caverns’ Treasures*—should adapt as appropriate. When revering the masters, one may visualize and pray to the Three Masters who transmit the registers of the method."

At dawn, he visualizes the qi of blue-green clouds filling the retreat hall, with blue-green dragons and lions guarding front and back. According to *The Numinous Treasure’s Visualization of Spirits*: "The blue-green dragon and lion together have eight heads. Four heads are at the two sides of the high seat’s southern envoy station, above sì and wèi. Four heads are in the north, above chǒu and hài, with the central high seat as the standard. The blue-green dragon is within, the lion without, all facing east and west in mutual opposition." Next, he visualizes the blue-green qi emerging from the master’s liver like ascending clouds. The blue-green dragon and lion emerge within the blue-green qi, covering the bodies of the disciple’s entire household.

At midday, he visualizes the qi of red clouds filling the retreat hall, with vermilion phoenixes and male and female fenghuang singing mournfully to the left and right. According to *The Numinous Treasure’s Visualization of Spirits*: "The male is called fèng, the female huáng; they are birds. Their heads resemble a rooster’s, beaks a swallow’s, necks a snake’s, backs a tortoise’s, tails a fish’s, with five-colored dragon patterns, together having eight heads. Four are in the east, above yín and chén on the two sides of the envoy station. Another four heads are in the west, above xū and shēn on the two sides of the envoy station. The vermilion phoenix is within, the fenghuang without, facing north and south in mutual opposition." Next, he visualizes the qi of red clouds emerging from the master’s heart, with the fenghuang and vermilion phoenix emerging within the red qi, covering the bodies of the disciple’s entire household, young and old.

At sunset, he visualizes the qi of white clouds filling the retreat hall, with white tigers and qilin guarding the four directions. According to *The Numinous Treasure’s Visualization of Spirits*: "The qilin is a beast. Its body resembles an ox’s tail, horse’s hooves, is yellow in color, with round hooves and a horn. Its head bears flesh, together having eight heads. Four are born in the four directions, two heads above zǐ, wǔ, mǎo, and yǒu. The white tiger is within, the qilin without, all facing south." Next, he visualizes the white clouds emerging from the master’s lungs, with the white tiger and qilin emerging within the white qi, covering the bodies of the disciple’s entire household, young and old.

Next, he visualizes immortal lads and jade maidens, celestial immortals, earthly immortals, flying immortals, the celestial bodies of the sun, moon, and stars, and the five emperors’ armies, each with nine hundred million and ten thousand riders, overseeing the retreat’s affairs. The officials of the Three Realms array to the left and right, their majestic propriety solemn, without negligence or slackness. According to *The Numinous Treasure’s Visualization of Spirits*: "The immortal lad attends the incense, standing to the left in the east; the jade maiden attends the incense, standing to the right in the west. From the celestial immortals to the Five Emperors of the Five Peaks, all are the armies of celestial immortals, wearing crimson robes, stationed at the celestial gate, to the east of the gate."

The earthly immortals’ officers and soldiers wear attire like that of military troops, stationed at the earthly gate. The flying immortals’ officers and soldiers wear feathered robes, stationed at the celestial gate, to the west of the gate. The officers and soldiers of the Solar Palace wear red robes, stationed at the solar gate. The officers and soldiers of the Lunar Palace wear pale yellow robes, stationed at the lunar gate. The officers and soldiers of the stellar lodges wear robes of colors corresponding to their directions, stationed at the four quarters, the four seasons, and the four *meng* positions. The Five Emperors’ officers, soldiers, and horses follow their respective directions, each wearing robes of their directional color and stationed in their own quarter. The central position is the direction of the established king.

Next, with eyes closed, inwardly visualize and perceive the five viscera and five consciousnesses, the five stars and Five Emperors, attending and guarding within the body, illuminating and covering the whole as one. The body becomes golden in color, and true *qi* emerges from behind the lungs. A circular radiance appears around the neck, like the image of the sun, illuminating the ten directions. Within the body, all is clearly seen, both inside and out.

According to *The Numinous Treasure’s Visualization of Spirits*: "As for the five viscera: first visualize the lungs, red and white in color, with seven lobes like a lotus flower, connected below the throat, with the *zouyu* covering the heart. Next visualize the heart, purple-red in color, like an oil sac, three inches long, wider above and narrower below, with a central aperture below the lungs. Next visualize the liver, purple-green in color, with five lobes below the heart. Next visualize the kidneys, which are paired, purple-black in color, like inverted cups, positioned beside the spine at the level of the navel. Next visualize the spleen, a muddy golden-yellow color, one foot long, with both ends slightly curved and coiled. The granary contains the stomach, located directly at the navel.

As for the Five Peaks: visualize the Eastern Peak, Mount Tai; the Southern Peak, Mount Heng; the Western Peak, Mount Hua; the Northern Peak, Mount Heng, each in their respective directions. The Central Peak, Mount Songgao, is in the southwest. Each of the Five Peaks is in its own domain; visualize them from afar.

As for the five stars: visualize the five stars shining brightly in the five directions. The Fiery Star of the south is above the forehead; the Quelling Star of the center comes before the heart; the Chronographic Star of the north comes between the two knees; the Jupiter Star of the east comes at the left elbow; the Venus Star of the west comes at the right elbow.

As for the Five Emperors: visualize the Green Emperor standing in the east, the Red Emperor standing in the south, the White Emperor standing in the west, the Black Emperor standing in the north, and the Yellow Emperor standing in the center, the direction of the established king. Each wears the crown of an emperor and robes of their directional color, standing within the ritual altar.

Again, following the method above, visualize true *qi* emerging from behind the lung viscera, ascending through the spine, and surging upward to exit above the head. The *qi* of the four viscera then rises in succession, intermingling and crowning the body, lush and dense, like thick smoke. Thereupon, the body becomes golden, a circular radiance appears around the neck, and like a mirror, it illuminates the ten directions. Within the body, all is clearly seen, both inside and out.

The above describes the majestic propriety for establishing the retreat, excerpted from *The True Immortals’ Section on the Upper Prime Golden Register of the Numinous Treasure*. For all who ascend the altar to perform the Dao, burn incense, make invocations, or engage in visualization, follow the method above.

The above is excerpted from *The Essential Exegesis of the Numinous Treasure True Writ*, entitled:
*The Celestial Worthy’s Numinous Treasure Five Spontaneous Guardian Spirit Incantations*

**Explanation of the Ritual Drum**
Master Du Guangcheng states: The ritual drum aligns the inner spirit and *qi*, externally dispelling demonic influences. It is the first act of all ritual proceedings.
Striking the left and right sides forms the Heavenly Bell;
striking the center sounds the ritual drum.
The rhythm follows eight beats as a measure, for the twenty-four *qi*.
Three offerings of incense, with invocations for each:

**First Incense Offering**
Invocation: May it reach the Jade Clarity Realm, to offer to the Wondrously Non-Existent Supreme Emperor, the Spontaneous Primordial Celestial Worthy of the Dao, the Peerless Treasure of the Dao.

**Second Incense Offering**
Invocation: May it reach the Supreme Clarity Realm, to offer to the Wondrously Existent Great Emperor, the Jade Dawn Lord of the Great Dao of the Void Emperor, the Peerless Treasure of the Scriptures.

**Third Incense Offering**
Invocation: May it reach the Grand Clarity Realm, to offer to the Perfectly True Great Emperor, the Venerable Lord Lao of the Myriad Transformations and Primordial Chaos, the Peerless Treasure of the Master.

The above is excerpted from Master Du Guangcheng’s *Rituals of the Retreat*.

**Incantation for Holding the Censer**
The Dao arises from the study of the heart; the heart transmits through incense.
Holding the jade censer, the heart contemplates the Nine Heavens.
The true spirits gaze downward; the immortal banners approach the chamber.
Grant that your servant’s memorial swiftly ascend to the Nine Heavens.

The above is from the *Golden Register Rituals* promulgated during the Song dynasty—it is not an ancient method and may be omitted. In ancient practice, the High Priest and the Chief Cantor each had an incense table before their positions to offer incense; they did not use a handheld censer but offered incense directly at their own tables.

**Explanation of the Incense Offering**
The Most High Three Heavens, the Primordial Three *Qi* of the Celestial Worthy Lord Lao, summon forth from within us, your servants:
the Three and Five Merit Officers, the Left and Right Attendant Messengers, the Left and Right Dragon Courier Riders, the Incense-Holding Golden Youths, the Flower-Scattering and Message-Transmitting Jade Maidens, and the Five Emperors’ Direct Talisman and Daily Incense Officers—thirty-six of each.
Let them emerge, fully adorned, to report to the local earth gods and true officials of this place.
We now burn incense to universally deliver the departed kin of so-and-so, and all the souls gathered here, as we conduct the Most High Yellow Register Great Retreat for three days and nights.
On this first night, we begin the retreat by ascending the altar, paying homage to the true, performing the Dao, fulfilling our duties, proclaiming the precepts, and pledging allegiance to the various heavens.
May the life-*qi* of the Most High Ten Directions’ true and correct spirits descend and flow into us, your servants, so that our memorial swiftly reaches the presence of the Most High, Boundless, Great Dao, the Perfectly True Jade Emperor.

This incense offering marks the beginning of invoking the true spirits, excerpted from the *Golden Register Writ*. The Dao is divided into the Three Caverns, and its teachings likewise follow distinct divisions. For instance, the *Upper Prime Five Spirits and Five Venerables Divine Perfected* pertains to the *Shangqing* incense offering; the *Most High Numinous Treasure Supreme Prime Celestial Worthy* pertains to the *spontaneous* incense offering. The *Jade Maidens Transmitting Messages to the August Lords* pertains to the *Dongshen* incense offering; the *Most High Primordial Five Spirits Venerable Lord Lao* pertains to the *Zhengyi* incense offering. Other variations are too numerous to list comprehensively. As for the *Numinous Treasure*, it follows the *Golden Register Writ* in its entirety. However, the *Yellow Register Writ* differs, as in its description: the Incense Officers, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, the Dragon Courier Riders, the Incense-Attending Jade Maidens, and the Five Emperors’ Direct Talisman Officers—thirty-six of each—emerge. Master Zhang Wanfu’s *Orthodox Retreat* incense offering follows the *Yellow Register Writ*, yet for the *Host Initiation* and *Retreat Conclusion*, it reverts to the *Golden Register Writ*. The invocations differ between the two. It is likely that the *Orthodox Retreat* follows the original scripture, while the *Host Initiation* and *Retreat Conclusion* employ the *spontaneous audience* method, thus adhering to the *Golden Register Writ*—though this is not certain. As the teachings have been transmitted for so long, discrepancies abound.

As in the *Golden Register Writ*, beneath the Three and Five Merit Officers, the five characters "Left and Right Official Envoys" are absent, yet they appear in the *Alliance with the True* ritual scriptures. The *Golden Register Writ* speaks of "Incense-Attending Golden Lads," while the *Alliance with the True* renders them as "Jade Lads." The *Golden Register Writ* mentions "Incense-Attending Jade Maidens," whereas Master Lu’s and Du Guangcheng’s rites refer to them simply as "Jade Maidens," and Zhang Qingdu’s ritual calls them "Flower-Scattering Jade Maidens." Beneath the Five Emperors’ Direct Talisman Officers in the *Golden Register* and *Alliance with the True*, the four characters "Direct Day Incense Officers" are absent, yet all rites by Master Lu, Zhang, and Du include them. All *Alliance with the True* scriptures speak of "before the Perfected Jade Emperor," while the *Yellow Register Writ* reads "before the Jade Emperor, the August Thearch’s Presence."

In essence, the Three Registers and *Alliance with the True* scriptures are used in mutual reference, hence the ritual code states: "The *Alliance with the True* cannot be performed alone; the *Golden Register* cannot be used exclusively." Though the *Yellow Register*’s *Roots of Transgression* varies in scroll titles and names, it too serves as a common lower canon with broad applications. As for the re-lighting of the incense burner, discrepancies likewise arise, which cannot be fully explicated. Here, we provisionally record the *Host Initiation* and incense-lighting rites; the rest may be inferred by analogy.

**Explanation of the Dharma-Rank Announcement and Audience Petition**
Master Zhang Wanfu states: Each participant shall announce their received Dharma rank. When reciting, let the voice be heard only by oneself, avoiding clamor. The rest follows this example.

**Text for the Dharma-Rank Announcement and Audience Petition after the Conclusion of the *Host Initiation* and Incense-Lighting**
This passage is drawn from the *True Immortal Ranks* of the *Upper Prime Golden Register Writ* in the *Scriptures of the Numinous Treasure*, serving as the ritual code for the *Audience with the Host of Perfected Ones* and the *Dignified Rites of the Assembly of Perfected*, known as the *spontaneous audience* method. It differs from the triple incense-offering and vow-recitation of the *Orthodox Retreat*, as it does not invoke the sacred ranks.

In Zhang and Du’s *Host Initiation* rites, after announcing the Dharma rank, the text proceeds: "Your servant so-and-so now burns this vow-incense, dedicating these merits..."—this follows a single scriptural source. Among the *Host Initiation* rites for the various *Numinous Treasure Retreats* preserved in the canon, none include the invocation of sacred ranks. Only one *Standing Rite for the Spontaneous Numinous Treasure Retreat*—of uncertain authorship—replaces much of the original phrasing with contemporary language and inserts the invocation of sacred ranks during the procession. Later generations have uncritically perpetuated this practice, and even the transmissions of Liu Chongjing follow suit. Though it is said that when offering incense and petitions, one must first report to the Supreme Mystery, the invocation of sacred ranks during the procession derives from the *Alliance with the True Ritual Code of the Nine Dark Prisons of the Long Night’s Treasury in the Cavern Mystery*, where the Celestial Worthy of Original Beginning, in the Fragrant Grove Garden, taught the seven thousand two hundred and forty youths the methods of transforming the body’s majestic radiance and destiny. Summoning the flying deities and transcendents of the ten directions, he expounded the karmic retribution of transgressions and blessings, delivering the highest ranks. The Great Dao Lord of the Supreme then petitioned the Celestial Worthy of Original Beginning, seeking to bestow teachings for cultivation and the deliverance of all beings. Thereupon, the flying deities and transcendents were commanded to establish the protocols for the *Duty of the Retreat*. The invocation of sacred ranks during the procession originates here.

The *Host Initiation* and dispersal of the retreat follow the *spontaneous audience* method. Since it traces its lineage to the *Golden Register Writ*, which lacks such invocations, they cannot be arbitrarily inserted. Moreover, the prayers of supplication, repentance, gratitude, and vows rely solely on the transcendents’ memorializing the retreat’s sincerity. Here, we adhere to the ancient ritual code and omit the sacred ranks. Yet, fearing that later students, unfamiliar with the scriptural texts, might harbor doubts, we briefly elucidate the origins.

**Explanation of the Ten Directions Salutation**
At midday, the salutation begins with the East; at night, it begins with the North.
Master Zhang Wanfu states: For every bow, first recite "With utmost sincerity, I take refuge in the East," then focus the mind on the East. Lower the body, bend the knees, and invoke the "Boundless Supreme Numinous Treasure." Gradually descend until both hands touch the ground. As the invocation of "Celestial Worthy" concludes, the forehead touches the ground. Rise in unison with the voice, neither too swiftly nor too slowly, with measured rhythm. Ensure the five bodily postures conform to the ritual, avoiding cramped or lax movements. Align the ascent and descent; after each bow, rise from the seated position before resuming the seat, following the example below—never remain seated. Strike the chime only after the recitation of "Celestial Worthy" concludes. This is called *salutation* because the rising, bowing, and kneeling proceed with dignified order, in accordance with the ritual. Only those who can salute with utmost sincerity truly perform the salutation; those who perform the salutation must possess utmost sincerity. If one does not examine the reverence of form, how can the mind’s intent be conveyed? Thus, repentance and prayers for blessings always begin with salutation.

**Explanation of the Three Karmas’ Repentance**
After the salutation, each participant kneels upright, holds the tablet, kowtows, and repents.
Master Zhang Wanfu states: From the salutation to the Ten Directions’ Celestial Worthies through the repentance of the Three Karmas, all derive from the *Perpetual Audience Rite of the Numinous Treasure*. The Three Petitions and Three Eulogies follow.

The Dao as one’s spouse, the scriptures cherished as jade and pearls.
Holding precepts to restrain the six passions, mindful of the Way to dispel desires.
In tranquility, the upright qi abides; in serenity, the spirit rests in silence.
Heavenly demons all revere and protect, generation after generation receiving great blessings.
The household and state flourish in abundance; the scriptures and Dao thrive in splendor.
Heavenly beings and humans share this aspiration, ascending into the Great Vehicle in subtle mystery.
By the mind, the field of merit is established; the Wheel of Dharma ascends in boundless motion.
Seven generations of ancestors ascend to heaven; this body soars in broad daylight.
The Great Dao pervades the profound void—with thought, nothing remains unanswered.
Refining the essence to join the immortals, thus attaining the vajra body.
Transcending the Three Realms’ tribulations, liberating from the Five Sufferings of hell.
All return to the *Supreme Scripture*; in stillness, bow with reverence.

The above is from the *Dongxuan Lingbao Xiaomo Baozhen Anzhi Zhihui Benyuan Dajie Shangpin Jing* (*Scripture of the Supreme Precepts of the Numinous Treasure’s Treasure of Wisdom for Dispelling Demons, Stabilizing the Will, and Fulfilling Fundamental Vows*), also found in the *Bu Xu Jing of Yuqing Mountain*, known as the *Ritual Scripture*. After each recitation concludes, one proclaims "excellent" and bows once. The oral instructions of the perfected state: the jade maidens and immortal youths attending the scriptures, upon hearing this invocation, rejoice and protect the devotee’s body. All great scriptures employ this invocation in their veneration. For those who venerate the scriptures in silent contemplation, they inwardly recite the text—this is the secret of the highest immortals.

In ritual purification, the scriptures are the foundation. In all purification rites, before the Three Treasures, the sacred scriptures must be placed to consecrate the altar. Thus, the *Shangyuan Jinlu Jianwen Zhenxian Pin* (*Catalogue of Perfected Immortals of the Golden Register of the Upper Prime*) states: upon completing the circumambulation in the purification rite’s dignified observances, all turn northward to venerate the scriptures with three bows.

**Explanation of the Three Bows**
Master Zhang Wanfu states: The Three Bows derive from the *Perpetual Audience Rite of the Numinous Treasure*.

*End of Scroll Thirty-Two of the* Wushang Huanglu Da Zhai Licheng Yi
*Scroll Thirty-Three of the* Wushang Huanglu Da Zhai Licheng Yi *begins*

The Venerable Master Chongjing of the Three Caverns, as transmitted by Liu Yongguang to the Celestial Enforcer of the Most High, Jiang Shuyu, compiled:

**Methods for Purification Rites: Explanation of the Placement of the True Writs for Pacification and Consecration**

The Hidden Scripts of the Myriad Heavens, the Spontaneous Jade Writs, and the Boundless Cavern Chapters derive from the *Lingbao Scripture on the Five Refinements for Deliverance from the Corpse*. They are also called the *Method of the Five Immortals’ Refinements for Pacifying Spirits and Consecrating the Divine*, specifically for the deliverance of the departed. For the consecration of purification altars, these must be observed and employed.

The method requires writing in cinnabar on azure paper to consecrate the five directions. On the eve of the rite, after reciting the writ, it is secured with a golden dragon. When dispersing the altar, after reciting the writ, the disciple holds it above the incense smoke while the Dharma Master strikes his teeth twelve times and intones the incantation:

*"Most High Perfected, Great Sage and Lofty Honored One,
Spreading transformation and circulating qi through the Thirty-Two Heavens.
Eight Assemblies and Nine Radiances, spontaneously forming script—
Pacifying and consecrating heaven and earth, preserving and governing the kalpas.
The Primordial Beginning’s talismanic command universally notifies the Three Primes.
Below, it commands the Nine Earths; above, it seals the Myriad Heavens.
At its center, it announces to the seas and mountains, the famous peaks and great rivers.
Today, this supreme proclamation is heard by all spirits.
Disciple So-and-So, performing purification and practicing the Dao,
Delivers and uplifts the hidden souls, the Three Offices and Nine Bureaus.
Eradicates the roots of transgression, eternally delivering from the Three Paths.
The source of the Five Sufferings, generation after generation, receives blessings.
Names recorded in the cinnabar register, spirits ascend to heaven.
Refinement and transformation occur naturally, opening deliverance from life and death.
Preserved for kalpas unnumbered, by the Nine Heavens’ edict.
Transmitted by wind and fire couriers."*

All respond three times. From the *Lingbao Inner Sound Jade Formula*.

After the incantation, the writ is burned in the memorial casket. There are also methods for employing the Five Elders’ Red Writs and Jade Scripts, which are not fully recorded here. The *Jade Formula of the Red Writs*, with Du Guangcheng’s preface, is appended to the left.

The Yellow Register Purification Rite fundamentally aims to rescue hidden souls, uplift wandering spirits, open deliverance for those in eternal night, and ascend and ferry those in the depths of the Yellow Springs. Yet its benefits extend further: averting calamity and inviting fortune, repenting transgressions and seeking grace, universally cultivating for humans and heavens, and benefiting both families and states—its merits are all-pervasive.

The consecrated *Lingbao True Writs of the Five Elders’ Red Scripts*, when examined in detail, serve four distinct purposes:
1. Seeking immortality and receiving the Dao: the twenty-four characters beginning with the Nine Qi of the Eastern Direction.
2. Warding off and restraining stellar influences: the thirty-two characters beginning with Jupiter, assisting the liver.
3. Subduing and vanquishing demonic spirits: the thirty-two characters beginning with the incantation of the Eastern Mountain Spirit.
4. Dispelling and eliminating water disasters: the thirty-two characters beginning with "Below, restrain the Eastern River."

The applications of the five writs are thus complete.

Master Zhang Wanfu of the Pure Capital Abbey in the Western Capital, in his *Ritual Norms*, states: The Hidden Scripts of the Myriad Heavens and the Eight Assemblies’ Jade Writs were expounded by the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning in the Fragrant Grove Garden to the Youth of Supreme Wisdom. They deliver from the Five Sufferings and ferry across the Nine Dark Realms. In the *Rite for Transmigrating Spirits*, they are carved into stone for practical use.

Now, for the Yellow Register rites of deliverance, these texts should be employed. Whether in mourning or celebration, their application is measured and fitting. May they be perpetuated through endless kalpas, universally practiced. The incantations and burnt offerings are equivalent to the true writs. Established methods exist for these, and they are to be widely propagated.

**Three Hymns of Wisdom with Exegesis**

**Wisdom arises from the formless,**
Radiant, transcending the ten directions.
It weaves emptiness to tower in the dark firmament,
While all heavens draw from its flowing fragrance.
Its subtlety defies thought,
Yet through emptiness, truth and reality commune.
Being is ultimately non-being,
Non-being embraces all without exclusion.

**Wisdom ever observes the body,**
The foremost task in learning the Dao.
Vast and boundless, it roams the mysterious,
Naturally recording my spirit.
The Celestial Worthy ever shields and guards,
While demon kings pledge their protection.
Resplendent is the vajra body,
Transcendent, a Supreme Immortal.

**Wisdom engenders the root of precepts,**
For the true Dao, precepts are the master.
From this, the Three Treasures arise,
Revered and received by lofty immortals.
Aboard this deathless vessel,
Swiftly cross the great expanse.
At this moment of preaching precepts,
All heavens come to bow in homage.

*From the* Scripture of the Numinous Treasure on the Great Precepts of Wisdom-Observing the Body. *After each hymn, perform one prostration.*

The Preceptor of the Sharp Precepts faces west; the assembly faces east.

The Celestial Worthy addressed the Most High Lord of the Dao: "Now, let the Dharma-sound be universally proclaimed to awaken all beings. For all men and women, dispel calamities and avert misfortunes. Invoke blessings, deliver lives, and eradicate the roots of all suffering. Let the living perceive the Dao and escape the Eight Difficulties; let the dead rejoice, feasting in celestial halls. May they soon be reborn among humans, in the household of a Wheel-Turning Sage King. Those who cultivate fasts and seek the Dao must do so with single-minded devotion. Receive the Ten Precepts with earnest attention and never forget them. Focus your thoughts in silent contemplation, profoundly reflecting on the natural. Do not allow scattered thoughts to disturb body and spirit. Those who can do this should now listen attentively."

**The First Precept:** Let the heart harbor no malice or envy; do not nurture hidden harm. Guard your speech, be mindful of transgressions, and let your thoughts dwell on the Dharma.

**The Second Precept:** Uphold benevolence, refrain from killing, and compassionately aid all beings. Extend loving-kindness and universal salvation to all.

**The Third Precept:** Maintain integrity and yield to righteousness; neither lust nor steal. Constantly cultivate virtuous thoughts and sacrifice for others.

**The Fourth Precept:** Be free from lust and desire; let the heart not wander. Uphold purity and vigilance, ensuring conduct remains unstained.

**The Fifth Precept:** Let speech be free of malice; words should not be ornate or deceitful. Be upright within and without, avoiding verbal transgressions.

**The Sixth Precept:** Abstain from alcohol and regulate conduct, harmonizing qi and temperament. Do not injure the spirit or commit manifold evils.

**The Seventh Precept:** Do not envy others’ superiority or contend for fame and merit. In all matters, yield and defer, humbling yourself to deliver others.

**The Eighth Precept:** Do not criticize scriptures and teachings or slander sacred texts. Receive the Dharma with reverence, ever as if in the presence of the divine.

**The Ninth Precept:** Do not engage in quarrels or disputes, nor judge the four classes of beings. Heavenly beings and humans will resent and blame you, harming your spirit and qi.

**The Tenth Precept:** In all actions and undertakings, maintain equanimity and single-mindedness. Let harmony prevail among people and serenity among spirits, ever thus in conduct.

The Celestial Worthy declared: "Those who cultivate and uphold these pure precepts align with the heart of Heaven. Constantly practice great compassion, vowing to universally deliver this troubled world. Reverently follow the sacred teachings without negligence. Better to die upholding goodness than to live in evil. Through unwavering devotion, one may be delivered from the Five Paths and avoid the Three Evil Realms. Protected by all heavens and revered by myriad spirits, those who maintain long fasts and uphold precepts will naturally attain deliverance from the world."

The Celestial Worthy said: "The Dao is venerable, the Dharma is wondrous, and the human body is also precious. Thus, the Dao has revealed scriptures and precepts to deliver humanity. Once the human body is delivered, it ascends to unite with the Dao. Cultivate purity, observe fasts, and uphold precepts. Calm the heart, still the mind, and let aspirations be clear. Single-mindedly turn toward the Dao, focusing without distraction. Purify the six viscera, avoid flavors beyond moderation. Maintain inner and outer clarity and emptiness, ever in accord with the natural. On the day of the fast, express all vows. If sincere, they will ascend, and the Four Heavenly Patrollers and Ten Divisions of Mighty Spirits will descend to witness. They observe and listen to the sacred sounds, reflecting upon your heart. Those who uphold precepts and practice the Dao will have their merits recorded in the heavens, and karmic retribution will swiftly manifest. The Dao does not fail those who diligently practice and earnestly receive its teachings—do not let demonic words deceive you."

The Celestial Worthy said: "When establishing fasts and practicing the Dao, the Four Heavenly Kings arrive in flying dragon chariots and jade carriages of eight scenes. Attended by perfected beings and jade maidens, holding flower banners, leading with phoenix songs, followed by celestial music, white cranes and lions, their harmonious chants fill the air. They burn incense, scatter flowers, and float through the void to come. They gaze upon the rites, observe the procession, and listen to the Dharma-sound. The Heavenly Kings descend, and myriad spirits pay homage. How can one not fully adhere to these methods? First receive the Ten Precepts, then practice the Dao. Proceed with refined steps, calm the heart, and close the mind. In sitting, rising, lying, and resting, never depart from proper decorum. The Heavenly Kings will rejoice, and your name will be inscribed in the Upper Clarity. This is what it means to attain the Dao within the square inch of the heart."

**Hymns of Upholding Precepts with Exegesis**

The Dao is the origin of formlessness,
The field of merit for all.
Establishing merit has no fixed master,
For each person’s vows arise from within.
Emptying oneself to respond to beings,
Focus the heart without partiality.
The Great Sage expounds the supreme teaching,
Like rain descending from heaven.
Lofty peaks are universally embraced,
While humility forms the abyss.
The sea is king of all rivers,
For it can relinquish even the dragon’s scales.
Through ten thousand kalpas, preserve wisdom’s use,
Not merely for this lifetime.
Uphold precepts without the slightest lapse,
And life after life, good affinities will form.
Profoundly contemplate the Great Vehicle,
And you shall embody the true Dao.

*Composed by the Perfected of the Great Ultimate, from the* Scripture of the Numinous Treasure on the Questions of the Immortal Duke. *After the precepts are expounded, circumambulate while chanting.*

**Exegesis on Filling Offices**

According to the *True Immortal Ranks of the Golden Register of the Upper Prime* in the *Simplified Writs of the Numinous Treasure*: For the rites of the fast, on the eve, appoint the High Master of Ritual, the Master of Recitation, one Supervisor of the Fast, one Attendant of Scriptures, one Attendant of Incense, and one Attendant of Lamps. On the morrow, they shall each perform their designated duties during the procession.

From the *Simplified Writs of the Golden Register*, only four of the same Dharma are to be invited: one Supervisor of the Fast, one Attendant of Affairs, one Attendant of Incense, and one Attendant of Lamps. At the main gate, they shall follow the master in circumambulation, bowing to the host to pray for the absolution of sins and mutual deliverance. Thus, beyond the six offices, no other titles exist.

Though the *Ritual Codes of Zhang Qingdu* speak of "fast officials" numbering from six to eighteen, it does not specify their respective duties. The intent of conducting a fast and circumambulating the Dao is fulfilled with the six offices alone. The remaining officials are all assigned to assist the six, jointly managing the fast. Hence, the *Simplified Writs of the Golden Register* state: "In ascending or descending the fast, precedence is given to office. Among those of equal office, precedence is given to seniority in years. Among those of equal years, precedence is given to virtue." The hierarchy of the six offices is already fixed in order. If there is but one person, no office is established. The principle that "among equals, precedence is given to seniority" is broadly evident here.

Moreover, the *Scripture of the Great Mystery* states: For those who transmit the Dao and its methods before a fast, the limit is thirty-eight persons; the minimum may not be fewer than six. Fast durations are nine, seven, five, or three days. To reduce it by even a single day is to hold a gathering, not a fast. The thirty-eight persons are as follows: first, the Three Masters—one Principal Master and two Protecting Masters, who are the Dharma Masters; second, the Five Guarantors, five persons who are the Masters of Recitation; third, the Six Illuminators, six persons who are the Supervisors of the Fast; fourth, the Seven Witnesses, seven persons who are the Attendants of Scriptures; fifth, the Eight Degrees, eight persons who are the Attendants of the Master; sixth, the Nine Accomplishments, nine persons who are the Attendants of Lamps. Thus, in the nine-tiered altar circumambulation rites recorded in the canon, the six offices are filled by more than one person, following this principle.

In recent times, beyond the High Master of Ritual, the remaining officials each don ritual vestments and occupy their positions. New titles such as Keeper of the Bell, Attendant of the Chime Stone, Announcer, and Attendant of the Altar have been created to substitute for the duties of the assembled officials. Beyond the six offices, many superfluous titles have arisen. Yet do they not know that the *Ritual Codes* clearly state: "Those conducting the fast wear coarse robes; those reciting scriptures wear ritual stoles"? The essence of the fast lies in sincerity and repentance. The utmost reverence is required to achieve spiritual resonance—how can it be a matter of mere display?

Master Du Guangcheng has discussed this in detail; his words are appended below.

**Master Du Guangcheng states:**
The scriptures and ritual codes all declare that among the fast officials, the one of highest virtue and power serves as the Dharma Master, while the one most versed in ritual procedures serves as the Master of Recitation. The *Duties of the Master of Recitation* further state: "First strike the Dharma drum, then lead the assembly. Set the wind to order and ritual, relying on their guidance and recitation." Thus, chanting, singing, and leading the procession are all the duties of the Master of Recitation.

In Wu, Jiangbiao, and Jingchu, the Master of Recitation holds the chime stone and chants the liturgy during the circumambulation. "First strike the Dharma drum" refers to the bell and chime stone. To ensure the officials are solemn and the ritual dignified, the chime stone must first be struck to align the assembly, after which the Master of Recitation chants the ascent to the altar—this too is the duty of the Master of Recitation.

However, in recent years, if the Master of Recitation is advanced in years or virtue and does not wish to be burdened with every task, one person from among the officials may be appointed to hold the chime stone and chant the liturgy. This is a temporary measure, not an ancient institution. Upon examination, it is a neglect of duty. Furthermore, some later students, acting on whim, have arbitrarily added an "Attendant of the Chime Stone" beyond the six offices, with no scriptural basis—such errors run deep.

The High Master of Ritual is responsible for making offerings and petitions, leading the assembly in all movements. If infirmity or age renders one unfit, one may retire. How can one delegate duties, becoming a mere supernumerary? Yet in Shu, the High Master of Ritual only announces the opening and closing of the incense burner, declaring his name and title. All other proclamations are entrusted to others. Though it is said that he leads the chant and others follow, how is this different from a dragon’s roar answered by a turtle’s croak? Such actions invite karmic retribution and self-inflicted blame. If even human affairs cannot tolerate this, how can the Dao of Heaven respond? Future Dharma leaders must take heed: do not seek convenience in the present only to accumulate sins for the hereafter.

The Supervisor of the Fast upholds the ritual codes and corrects transgressions. Impartiality is essential to jointly uphold the canonical laws. If any violations occur, the offender must be formally admonished. The one receiving punishment must willingly accept the penalty. The hope is that externally, ritual propriety is maintained to preserve the dignity of the salvific rite; internally, the heart remains unbetrayed, avoiding the regret of unfulfilled aspirations. During admonishment, there must be no clamor or dispute. The one upholding the law must proceed with proper protocol; the one at fault must not resist or refuse. Such conduct not only offends the sages but also invites ridicule from the assembly.

Next, the Attendant of Scriptures arranges the altar, presides over the Dharma seat, and oversees the scripture tables, offerings, and ritual implements, ensuring all is properly displayed. Moreover, the old method placed two high seats within the fast hall for recitation at the three periods. Thus, the *Simplified Writs* state: "Recitation occurs at the three periods." The *Duties* further state: "Guard the two lion seats." The *Penalty Codes* state: "Those listening to scriptures who lean or sit improperly without holding the ritual tablet," and "Those who ask improper questions." These all indicate that after the circumambulation, the Dharma Master and officials engage in recitation at the three periods.

In recent times, the practice has been to circumambulate and recite scriptures at the three periods within the altar space, with no recitation or two high seats. During scripture recitation, the officials sit while one person distributes purifying water, the Attendant of Incense offers incense, and the Attendant of Scriptures recites. After the recitation, the Attendant of Scriptures collects the scriptures, returns them to their seats, and tidies the altar, ensuring the offerings are properly maintained and no outsiders trespass upon the sacred space. These are the duties of the Attendant of Scriptures.

Do not neglect one’s duties with empty attendance, nor display arrogance and irreverence. Do not allow tables and stands to lie askew within the altar space, nor let offerings become soiled or mixed with impurities. Do not permit servants or kitchen staff to enter the altar, lest they profane the divine and true, violating prohibitions and precepts. Even after the altar’s closure, one must not permit reverse movement, yet servants and cooks are often allowed to enter and exit freely—such practices are common and must be strictly forbidden. Should they persist, the Attendant of Scriptures shall bear the blame and punishment.

The duties of the Attendant of Incense are fully set forth in the ritual writ. Yet in recent times, many have grown lax and negligent, so that not only does the incense smoke often cease, but the fire may go out and the ashes grow cold. Moreover, before the High Priest has even ascended the altar, some presume to add incense and tend the censer within the sacred space—such violations are widespread. When reviewing the ritual codes, one must take heed and exercise caution.

The Attendant of Lamps must be diligent and vigilant, ensuring the lamps are tended according to ritual, extinguished at dawn, and relit to sustain their brightness—only then is one deemed fit for the role. Yet of late, some unlearned and shallow-minded individuals, instead of entrusting the Attendant of Scriptures with the arrangement of the altar, have established a separate post called the "Altar Attendant." This introduces redundant titles beyond the six established offices. Enlightened Dharma Masters should reject such innovations, lest they leave false traces and become a laughingstock to later generations.

Furthermore, according to the ancient statutes of the *Golden Register* and the old rites of the *Yellow Register*, on the eve of the pre-dawn invocation and during the declaration of merit, one must first perform the *Natural Audience* before proceeding with the ritual. Thus, the *Rites of Invocation and Purification* state: "The officials shall lead one another in first performing the *Natural Audience*; after the Three Bows, they shall report to the Purification Office, recite the precepts, and proclaim the ritual codes. At dawn the following morning, they shall proceed with the ritual in accordance with the Dao." This method has been transmitted from Master Lu of the Celestial Master, Celestial Master Kou, and Zhang Qingdu, down to the present day, spanning many generations. As the *Purification Rites* derive from the *Numinous Treasure*, the *Natural Audience* is the origin of all purification—thus, it is performed first to demonstrate that one has not forgotten the root.

Yet some ignorant Daoists, failing to grasp the intent of the ancient worthies, first appoint the six offices before the Mystic Master, proclaim the ritual codes, and receive the tablets—only then do they ascend the altar. They claim that Master Jianji’s purification rites are erroneous, adorning falsehoods and slandering the teachings, their words and reasoning confused and ignorant to the extreme. Even worse, some of their followers imitate these practices. Such actions not only disrupt the Dharma but also incur the sin of slandering the worthy. Those of discernment in the teachings should firmly reject them.

Among the old rites, there is one transmitted error: during the pre-dawn invocation and declaration of merit, the *Natural Audience* should properly address the *Numinous Treasure Celestial Worthy*. Yet the transmitted practice has been to bow to titles such as the *Jade Treasure Sovereign*, which slightly deviates from the original intent of the *Natural Audience*. This may be due to the passage of time and textual corruption. In the present ritual, this has been corrected—not out of presumption, but in accordance with reason. May later scholars of the age and future worthies uphold this together.

The *Numinous Treasure Purification Rites* are fully recorded in the *Ten Sections of the Flying Celestial Wondrous Scriptures*. Their invocations, vows, repentances, and prayers, as well as the postures of reverence, the protocols of ascent and descent, are all ancient texts from the Dragon Han era and must not be altered. Only Dharma Masters who have mastered the Three Caverns, received the scriptures and registers, and are well-versed in ritual procedures may preside over them. Thus, in Zhang Qingdu’s *Rites of Construction and Establishment*, one bows only to the *Primordial Chapter of Invocation* and the memorial—local deities and spirits are not petitioned separately. This is because the purification rites are profound and subtle: the divine officials and celestial soldiers respond to the words themselves, requiring no relay of documents or messengers to achieve resonance.

The *Numinous Treasure Great Dharma* descended to the world, and with it came the texts of jade talismans and golden tablets, the registers of true writs, the incantations for summoning divine tigers, the rites of refinement and deliverance of Nanchang, the ablutions of the Five Immortals, the protocols of radiance and descending light, the methods of staff-breaking and prison-breaking, and the gates of repentance through wheel lamps. Each has its own secrets, and each is performed in proper sequence. They elevate the sinful and deliver both the living and the dead, refining the ancient methods with greater detail. The ancient methods focused solely on purification, recitation, and lecture, without other distractions, so their structure was simple and direct. In the present age, grand purifications are often accompanied by multiple rites, resulting in a proliferation of details. Though the needs of past and present differ, each has its proper place. One must seek the root to understand the purpose.

The proper purification rites of invocation and thanksgiving, the pre-dawn invocation, and the dispersal of the altar are based on the scriptural texts. The issuance of talismanic commands, the summoning and refinement of spirits, and the deliverance of souls derive from the *Numinous Treasure*. The bowing to memorials, the elevation of the sinful, and the liberation of the damned originate from the *Orthodox Unity*. If one thoroughly investigates their origins and ends, their application will not be in vain.

Those who do not conform should seek like-minded companions, select an auspicious site, establish an altar, and adhere strictly to the scriptural texts, without incorporating extraneous rites. I know that the eyes of the Dao observe all—such merit is towering and cannot be measured by shallow standards. Yet without a scholar who has mastered the Three Caverns and the highest learning, one cannot advance in this.

**Proclamation of Prohibitions**
The present regulations state: The *Thirty-Six Prohibitions* derive from the *Ritual of the Supreme Ultimate’s Purification*. They are to be made of ivory, bone, bamboo, or wood—thirty-six tablets in total, each eight *fen* wide and nine *cun* tall, inscribed with the text in a manner similar to the ritual tablets. Zhang Qingdu said: "On the day of the circumambulation, they are placed upon the ritual table." Du Guangcheng said: "They are stored in a crimson pouch, and the Purification Supervisor carries them when ascending the altar. If a violation occurs, the tablet is presented as a penalty." Both methods are acceptable.

Zhang Qingdu said: "Those whose bodies bear the weight of grave transgressions—even they are permitted to seek redemption through purification and repentance, thereby dissolving their offenses. Now, the rites of purification elevate reverence through prostration; how much more should this apply to those of lofty virtue? Yet when ritual protocols falter, I propose substituting prostrations in their place, with the number of bows determined by the severity of the matter. The officiating officers shall adjudicate accordingly in the moment—this aligns with the intent of Lu Jianji. Furthermore, the *Thirty-Six Prohibitions* are also recorded in the *Laws of the Supreme Ultimate and Mysterious Capital*. There, the penalties are inscribed in fragrant oil, totaling only thirty clauses. That it speaks of *Thirty-Six Prohibitions* likely accounts for the host’s duties in sweeping and cleansing the hall, the Daoists’ bearing of towels, robes, tablets, and shoes, and the reporting to the Purification Supervisor—along with violations of decorum by those below or above the dais, or lapses in ritual propriety. These, combined with the preceding prohibitions, make thirty-six in all. However, the six additional clauses, though listed as prohibitions, carry no penalty of fragrant-oil inscription and thus seem unfit for tablets. Yet Zhang Qingdu states that the tablets—thirty-six in number, made of bamboo, wood, ivory, or bone—are to be inscribed individually for each prohibition, from the High Master downward. This essentially consolidates the tablets for the six offices into a single set.

**Reopening the Censer**
After the announcements conclude, approach the altar, offer incense, and recite the invocations. Drawn from the *Scripture of the Natural Rites of the Three Registers of Numinous Treasure*.

**Section on Purification Rites and Their Application**
**Explanation of the Announcement of Official Departure**

Master Zhang Wanfu the Celestial Master states: All transmitted words and courier dispatches rely upon the spirit-way to achieve resonance and communion. By "spirit-way," the ranks of immortal officials, clerks, and soldiers are meant. These immortal officials, clerks, and soldiers must be received through one’s master—namely, the registers of the numinous governance of immortals, the Three Divisions and Eight Effulgences, the Thirty-Two Heavens, the Jade Lads and Jade Maidens, and the Direct Talismans and Direct Officers of the Five Thearchs. Only when a Daoist possesses these immortal officials may they participate in the invitation to the fast. To perform rites in vain, without the presence of true numina, is to incur fault and punishment. Beware.

After the censer is opened, all officials kneel in unison. The Dharma Master strikes the teeth twenty-four times and summons the clerks and soldiers. Once the supplication to the heavens is complete, each strikes the teeth three times and swallows saliva three times.

*Recorded in the* Scripture of the Celestial Guest’s Supreme Ultimate Rites for the Presentation of the Fast’s Dignified Observances.

Master Xian the Immortal Duke states: This is called the rite for the initial fast’s supplication. At the six daily periods of burning incense, one need only pray toward the censer and then perform the prostrations.

Zhang Qingdu says: When establishing a fast, only one official is summoned. Upon the fast’s conclusion and the declaration of merit, the clerks and soldiers are no longer summoned.

**Explanation of the Supplication and Aspiration Recitation**
During the main fast, when supplicating the sacred ranks and subsequent invocations, the text is drawn from the *Alliance with the Perfected: Ordinances of the Numinous Treasure*, as spoken by the Flying Celestial Divine Beings.

The three offerings of incense and the recitation of manifest aspirations are taken from the *Register of Immortal Transcendents of the Lower Prime Yellow Register*. In present practice, when burning incense, the phrases from "I take refuge in the Master, the Venerable, the Great Sages, and the host of immortals" to "uniting with the Dao and the Perfected" are standard in the texts for the three offerings of incense during all fasts. Moreover, in current ordinances, after the supplication, the phrase "uniting with the Dao and the Perfected" is also used. This is because the *Register of Immortal Transcendents of the Yellow Register Scripture* includes this passage before the aspiration recitation for the three pinches of incense. Not daring to alter the language of the scriptures, Zhang Qingdu’s ordinances follow suit. This is briefly explained for the benefit of later learners who may not know its origin.

**Explanation of the Repentance to the Twenty Directions**
Following the directions and ordinances, repentance is offered to the Palace of the Sun in the northeast, the Palace of the Moon in the Central Marchmount, the Palace of the Stars in the southwest, the Water Palace, the Scriptures and Methods in the north, and the Four Marchmounts, each according to its respective direction.

*These repentance texts for the twenty directions serve as the dignified observances for the deliverance from the roots of transgression. Drawn from the* Register of Immortal Transcendents of the Lower Prime Yellow Register.

**Explanation of the Visualization of the Nine-Colored Circular Image, the Swallowing of Saliva, and the Commanding of Demons**
The High Functionary stands above the Ghost Gate, the General Lecturer above the Heavenly Gate, and the assembled officials stand in order behind the General Lecturer. First, they strike the teeth three times and swallow saliva three times. In the mind, they visualize the sun and moon before their face, entering through the nostrils into the Cavern Chamber of the Golden Flower Palace between the eyebrows, then proceeding one inch inward to the Palace of the Hall of Light, two inches to the Palace of the Cavern Chamber, and three inches to the Palace of the Cinnabar Field. North of the Hall of Light and south of the Cavern Chamber, one inch upward lies the Palace of the Golden Flower. The sun enters through the left nostril, the moon through the right. Radiance emerges from the back of the neck, resplendently forming a nine-colored circular image that penetrates the Jade Pillow and illuminates the ten directions. They follow this visualization while circumambulating the scriptures.

Again, they strike the teeth three times and swallow saliva three times.

*Recorded in the* Hidden Commentary on the Jade Scripture of the Most High.

**Secret Mantras and Their Explanation**
Master Du Guangcheng states: These secret mantras must not be heard by the ears. To violate this incurs blame and responsibility. Be earnest, be vigilant.

Within the Yellow Center, strategize qi to sever demonic remnants; secretly refine and strengthen essence to sever the old fiend. The Most High issues a decree from the Chamber of the Most High, urgently summoning the Northern Emperor to the Five Palaces. Receiving the majestic command, he proclaims it to the demon kings—fivefold qi billows thickly, clashing with fate. The secret jade scriptures have just flourished in abundance; the Three Heavens revolve in brightness, the Six Heavens complete their cycle. How wise is this!

*Recorded in the* Numinous Treasure Scripture of the Five Talismans and the Human-Bird.

The method of visualization for the Eight Dao Command Registers in the *Cavern-Real* differs from this and is appended below for concurrent use.

When the ritual in each direction is complete, turn back to face east. Visualize the gods with eyes closed, strike the teeth five times, and swallow saliva five times. Envision the five spirits fully present within the body, the five talismans resplendent inside and out, while the demon hordes of the five directions flee far away. Those who come to attend and guard stand in solemn array behind the perfected officials.

After a long while, swallow saliva three times, strike the teeth three times, and recite the incantation from the *Human-Bird Mountain Scripture*: *"Within the Yellow Center, strategize qi..."*

Master Zhang Wanfu the Celestial Master states: Before the Heavenly Worthy expounded the scriptures, the demon kings of the Three Realms and the myriad heavens, along with the five great demon emperors, were all revered as lords of the ten thousand spirits, commanding ghostly legions to roam the vast heavens. They styled themselves as radiant and mighty, their achievements rivaling Heaven. Wielding power and unleashing poison, they afflicted the multitudes with suffering. Men and women offered prayers and sacrifices, slaughtering and dancing to honor and fear them.

After the Heavenly Worthy expounded the scriptures, the hundred demons submitted and transformed. The divine lords received their mandate to universally sweep away inauspiciousness. Demons dared not trespass, ghosts harbored no malevolent spirits. Once the demon multitudes submitted to the Heavenly Worthy, the sagely transformation elevated them to become the exalted sages of the myriad heavens and perfected beings of wondrous conduct. They now drive the chariot ahead, sweeping away dust to clear the path. Thus, when the host of sages wishes to traverse the heavens, they first command the demons to drive the chariot ahead. As the scripture says, *"The demon kings respectfully receive their duties and thereby ascend to the heavens."* Such is the case.

Therefore, when pacing the void, one must first visualize and command the demons.

The three morning audiences commanding the demons, as expounded by Zhang of the Pure Capital, are exhaustive. Master Zhao Daosheng, in his *Huanglu Rituals*, held that inner affairs conclude with the noon audience commanding demons, following the *Jinlu* of the Zhenghe era. This is his mistaken view, not the intent of the scriptures.

*Explanation of pacing the void and circumambulation.*

Master Zhang Wanfu the Heavenly Master states: The Jade Capital Mountain of the Mystic Metropolis crowns the eight directions. It is the domain governed by the Supreme Venerable Sovereign of the Limitless Dao, the August Lord of the Void, and the celestial abode of the loftiest immortals. Here, the great sages of the heavens and the perfected immortals of high rank each observe the fasts and uphold the precepts, revering the Supreme Void Sovereign. On every fast day, they ascend in flying-dragon carriages drawn by the eight-scene cloud chariots, convening in grand assembly at the Jade Capital of the Mystic Metropolis. They burn the naturally fragrant *zhantan* and the life-restoring *lingxiang* incense, while flying immortals scatter blossoms, circumambulating the seven-jeweled terrace thrice as they recite the hymns of the *Kongdong* odes. At that moment, the eight winds unfurl banners, and fragrant flowers drift and disperse. Wafting smoke billows thickly, and the Supreme Venerable praises their virtue. Moreover, the flying deities of heaven, ever riding carriages of azure radiance, roam the Jade Prosperity Heaven. Thrice daily, they lead the host of celestial sages to ascend and pay homage at the seven-jeweled palace, the seven-jeweled terrace, and the seven-jeweled jade palace—all abodes of the Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning. As the celestial host pays homage, they circumambulate in procession, chanting the *Dong* hymns, ascending in the *Xuan Bu Xu* odes, or rotating through the void in the *Xuan Kong* hymns, such as the *Great Brahma Immeasurable Dong* and their kind. When the secret incantations conclude, the *doujiang* intones the *Bu Xu* circumambulation, and the assembly proceeds in orderly leftward procession, encircling the scripture three times. For the first hymn, they stand upright, facing the scripture and its image. At the second hymn, they begin the circumambulation. By the tenth hymn, each must return to their original position to conclude. Each time the Supreme Venerable praises them, they turn to face the center, scatter blossoms, and bow once, enacting the rite of the ten directions’ homage to the Mystic Metropolis.

As recorded in the *Upper Prime Golden Register* under the *True Immortals* section: After delivering beings from the cycle of birth and death and establishing the fast’s majestic rites, the homage to the ten directions concludes. Then, for one period, they circumambulate leftward around the incense and lamps three times. The master recites the *Bu Xu* hymns, while the disciples at the gate chant the praises thrice, following the *Xuantai* method. Superior and subordinate proceed in sequence, moving with serene and graceful steps, modulating their voices and rectifying their qi as they chant the *Kongdong* hymns. They must not glance about, lest their thoughts wander, nor falter in pace or err in order, nor jostle one another in advance or retreat. The number of circumambulations should be adjusted according to the breadth of the altar space. If the altar is narrow, they may scatter blossoms during the second, fifth, and eighth hymns while circumambulating, and for the rest, face the scripture and its image.

The ten *Bu Xu Kongdong* hymns, with annotations:

1.
We bow our heads to the Supreme Venerable,
Burning incense to return to the Void.
Luminous radiance follows our turning,
The Dharma-wheel likewise circles thrice.
Mysterious vows arise in the four quarters,
Spiritual blessings extend to kings and lords.
Seven generations ascend to heaven’s halls,
Resplendent, their glory unfolds.

2.
Whistling and singing, we gaze upon the Great Desert,
Heavenly music delights our joy.
Equal fragrance exalts the supreme virtue,
Lesser immortals cannot compare.
Wondrous thoughts illumine the Mystic Awareness,
In orderly ranks we traverse the void.
Rotating, we tread the cloud’s warp,
Riding the void, we pace the Mystic Record.
Chanting the hymns of the Lord of Unity,
A hundred passages naturally harmonize.
Bending, we command the lads of the eight seas;
Uplifting, we escort the high immortals.
The heavens scatter fragrant blossoms,
Solemnly, the numinous wind arises.
Long-held vows root destiny,
Thus we attain lofty eminence.
Rejoicing before the Supreme Venerable,
Even ten thousand kalpas are but a beginning.

3.
Towering, the Mystic Metropolis Mountain,
The ten directions revere the August One.
Far-flung, the Heavenly Treasure Terrace,
Its radiance outshines the flowing sun.
Resplendent, the five groves of blossoms,
Brilliant, their crimson fruits gleam.
Ever mindful to consume the Mystic Essence,
Refining the fluids to solidify form and substance.
Golden light scatters the Purple Tenuity,
Graceful, the Great Vehicle soars free.
Looking up and down, we contemplate the Supreme Venerable,
The radiant splendor flourishes in the cinnabar field.
Gazing left, we grasp the *Yuyi*;
Glancing right, we embrace the *Jielin*.
The Six Perfections crown the Brahma-conduct,
Virtue and power renew with the sun.
Long-cultivated karmic blessings respond,
Hearing the scriptures as if meeting kin.
Heaven-endowed with talent surpassing the world,
Delighting in reciting the subtle and arcane.
The qi of the Supreme Harmony and the Void,
Exhaling and inhaling the flowing rosy mist.
Embryonic breathing stills the hundred passages,
In profound emptiness, we fathom the three conveniences.
The *Ninao* cavern illumines with bright radiance,
Thus we become the Golden Flower Immortals.

4.
The demon kings respectfully receive their duties,
Thus they ascend to pay homage to the heavens.
All begins with the fasts and precepts,
Accumulating merit to bind past karmic ties.
Soaring through the Great Void,
Escorting the loftiest immortals.
Guiding the reins to the ten directions,
Resting in rotation at the Mystic Radiance’s slope.
Looking up, we behold the Terrace of Kalpa’s Blade;
Looking down, we gaze upon the Purple Cloud Net.
Carefree in the Supreme Venerable’s capital,
Together we sit upon lotus blossoms.
Accumulating learning to become perfected beings,
Tranquil, our *rong* and *wei* harmonize.
Eternally enjoying boundless longevity,
Ten thousand springs are but a trifle.

5.
The Great Dao’s master is the Mystic Quiescence,
Ascending as immortals, friends with the peerless.
The noble scion transmits the numinous talismans,
The Great One bears the *Dong* hymns.
The *sharira* radiates golden splendor,
The dragon-drawn carriage suddenly arrives to welcome.
The Heavenly Venerable gazes upon the cloud chariot,
Floating, floating, riding the void in flight.
Fragrant blossoms like flying snow,
Drifting mists luxuriate upon the Mystic Beam.
Bowing our heads to the Golden Portal,
Hand in hand, we invite one another to the Jade Capital.
The *Qianshu* garden of the round radiance,
Resplendent, the seven-jeweled grove.
Three hundred named heavenly beasts,
Lions vast as ten thousand *xun*.
Flying dragons crouch and roar,
Divine phoenixes chant in rhythm.
The numinous wind fans wondrous blossoms,
Pure fragrance scatters upon our robes.
Without the talent of high immortals,
How could one indulge such a heart?

6.
We array our nine-dragon carriage,
Riding the void in carefree ease.
The eight heavens lie like the palm of a hand,
The six directions—how could they be distant?
The host of immortals recites the *Dong Xuan*,
The Supreme Venerable sings the pure hymn.
Fragrant blossoms scatter with the wind,
Jade tones form in the purple empyrean.
The five sufferings all burst forth,
The eight difficulties follow the scriptures’ emptiness.
Wondrous indeed is the numinous garden,
Raising this great Dharma-bridge.

7.
The Palace of the Heavenly True Lord of Unity,
Lushly crowning the radiant spirits.
Flowing and resplendent, the Dharma-wheel’s warp,
Rotating through the void to enter the formless.
The Void Sovereign strikes the cloud zither,
The host of perfected beings recites the *Dong* scriptures.
The high immortals solemnly praise,
Through endless kalpas, they preserve integrity and purity.
The supremely true await nothing,
At times, they guide the flying dragons.
Long fasts convene at the Mystic Metropolis,
Jade chimes resound with the ringing of chimes.
The ten blossoms gather the host of immortals,
Purple mists congeal to form a palace.
Jeweled canopies array before the Supreme Venerable,
Perfected beings hold lotus blossoms.
Scattering blossoms, we declare our vows,
Grasping the tally, we subdue the demon kings.
Dharma-drums assemble the host of immortals,
Numinous chants harmonize without discord.
There is no "can" or "cannot,"
Thoughts commune with the subtle and arcane.

From the *Lingbao Jade Capital Mountain Pace-the-Void Sutra*. At the conclusion of each verse, all proclaim "Excellent!" and bow once.

**Releasing the Weight: Reciting the Dignitary’s Great Thanksgiving**
All again recite the dharma-rank they have received.

The High Functionary faces north and offers profound thanks.
All officials and participants kneel in reverence.
The Perfected of Lingchong stands facing east.

From the *Essential Explications of the Numinous Treasure True Writ*.

**Dedication of Merit**
The merits of repentance, recitation, scripture-transmission, and meditative turning accrued heretofore may be redirected as appropriate: above, for the benefit of state and sovereign; below, for the living and the deceased. Together, may the merits of fast and scripture-transmission become supreme causes, perfecting the unsurpassed Dao.

**Secret Petition for Pardon**
Each day, upon completing the fast and exiting the altar, before the Mystic Master, silently intone:
*"We, your servants, now undertake this fast and ascend the altar to perform the Dao on behalf of [Name], [Title]. We humbly fear that in our conduct we may have transgressed regulations, failed to conform to ritual propriety, drawn the censure of the Four Offices, or incurred the displeasure of the Five Emperors. For a thousand faults and ten thousand sins, we beseech your pardon, that our merits may be perfected and our petitions answered. We now reverently rely upon the boundless grace of the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Center, the Three Officials, and the Five Emperors."*

**Section on Fast Rites and Their Application**
*Explication of Verbal Merits, Prostration, and Memorial Presentation*

Master Du Guangcheng states: Memorial texts are to be written on yellow silk five *chi* in length, with vermilion borders and vermilion script, each line containing twenty-four characters. The character for "life" (*sheng*) must not appear at the bottom of a line, nor the character for "death" (*si*) at the top. The first line records the ritual rank in full, concluding with the phrase "kneeling with head bowed." The phrase "I humbly address" occupies its own line. "The Supreme Vastness of the Boundless Dao" begins the second line. After the memorial text, the phrase "we reverently submit" is separated by three lines from the petitioner’s surname. The sacred title is separated by three lines from the petitioner’s surname. The date is separated by three lines from the sacred title. All must conform to the prescribed format; no emendations or corrections are permitted, lest severe censure follow. Proceed with utmost care.

When reading the memorial, first pass the document over incense for purification, then recite the ritual rank. Rise, bow twice, and resume a long kneel. In a harmonious voice and with regulated *qi*, read aloud. At the mention of the disciple’s name, all present bow twice. At phrases expressing reverent trepidation, rise and bow twice again. Upon reaching the date, time, and place of submission, bow twice more. When finished, unfold the memorial upon the jade table, verifying its presentation before the throne. Secure it with a dragon-headed ritual knife to the left of the sacred title and a vermilion brush to the right. Next, offer three pinches of incense, kneel long, and strike the teeth three times. Conclude the dispatch of the memorial and the issuance of its mandate.

The Dharma Master stands behind the table, gazing toward the Gate of Heaven, bowing slightly. Within, he visualizes the Three and Five Officials, the generals of the Three Primes, the courier functionaries, and their mounted retinue arrayed before and behind him. His body ascends in a jade-feathered chariot drawn by dragons, borne aloft amid purple *qi*, rising gently to the threshold of the Three Heavenly Gates. First, he pays homage to the Dharma Masters of the Three Heavens, then enters the left gate of the Mystic Capital Palace to present the memorial. Holding the memorial case, he proceeds directly through the Three Heavenly Gates. Twelve attendants—bearing the memorial, presenting the petition, and performing related duties—await the celestial review. Once the memorial is received, they exit the Three Heavenly Gates, returning in the feathered chariot with their mounted escort. The sequence of celestial palaces and pathways traversed follows the same order as the Three-Five Memorial Rite.

Next, strike the teeth twelve times to conclude the inner rites, then three more times, swallowing saliva thrice. Visualize the Three-Five memorial officials returning to their respective positions within the body, then bow twice. Roll the memorial into its case, seal it, and place it with the true writ upon a small table. The table is borne forward, with the Fast Overseer verifying the seal, preceded by banners and staffs, the disciples following behind. At the Gate of Heaven, the memorial is burned. The Dharma Master, standing in his original position facing the Gate of Heaven, visualizes the true officials bearing the true writ and memorial ascending with the crimson flames of the incense smoke into the celestial gate.

The above describes the merits of verbal petitions, also called "verbal merit memorials." Memorials and petitions follow the same method, both rooted in the Orthodox Unity tradition. In ancient times, Register Disciples and Libationers, overseeing households and transforming the people, submitted memorials and petitions by adhering to the proper method, visualizing the dispatch of officials to present them, awaiting the mysterious response. Thus, the original scripture for dispatching memorials states: "Should there be errors or inversions, the long brush of the celestial scribe will correct them accordingly." Yang Jie, in his revision of the *Golden Canopy*, arbitrarily removed these thirty-eight characters, failing to grasp the ancient method. Once the visualization of submission is complete, the memorial is left in the care of the central administration. On the days of the Three Primes, it is burned according to the prescribed method for concluding memorials. Memorials submitted after the Upper Prime are concluded on the Middle Prime; those after the Middle Prime are concluded on the Lower Prime.

In ancient times, the Dharma Registers were complete, and transmission had a proper lineage. The Three and Five Officials and their soldiers responded to the breath, not merely to written documents. After Du Guangcheng received his official appointment, he began collecting memorials into their cases and burning them at the Gate of Heaven. This reflects the ancient method, though later transmissions lost their authenticity. Without relying on written documents, one could not expect a response. Thus, after dispatching the officials, the memorial is rolled into its case, and the Dharma Master, following the proper visualization, burns it immediately—a slight deviation from the ancient method. Later, Zhao Daosheng further altered the procedure, having the Dharma Master read the memorial from back to front after the phrase "we reverently submit," and pressing the memorial with a jade scepter three times—a method from the *Celestial Unity* tradition.

The *Scripture of the Five Refinements for Animating the Corpse* in the Numinous Treasure tradition contains the method for yellow silk memorials, which serves as a template. At the beginning of a fast, the officials are summoned to initiate proceedings. Upon completion, a memorial is submitted, accompanied by a decree of merits, which ascends with the memorial to the Mystic Capital to receive celestial rewards. The officials are not summoned again. When Yang Jie was commissioned to revise the ritual scriptures, he added a second invocation of the ritual rank and a re-summoning of the officials after the Three Bows at the dispersal of the altar. This practice persisted thereafter, though it was never part of the ancient method, having failed to thoroughly examine the scriptures.

**Explication of Summoning the Officials**
All officials kneel long. The Dharma Master strikes the teeth twelve times, concluding the summoning. He strikes the teeth three more times and swallows saliva thrice. Visualizing the Three-Five officials returning to their respective positions within the body.

**Explication of Dismissing the Offices**
Each official, in order of rank, bows once before the Three Treasures, kneels long, and receives the tally from the High Merit. Rising, they perform the Three Bows and retreat to stand in the west. The High Merit bows three times and returns to his position.

**Explication of Proclaiming the Tally**
First, offer three pinches of incense. Holding the mountain tally, strike the teeth nine times and read it aloud, passing it over the incense thrice before recitation. Upon finishing, all officials bow twice. A disciple holds the tally horizontally over the incense smoke. The Dharma Master strikes the teeth nine times and recites the incantation facing east. As he chants, the officials echo his words. Afterward, all bow twice to the tally and recite the four characters for "golden dragon courier transmission" three times. The incantation concludes, and the tally is sealed according to the proper method. The water and earth tallies follow the same procedure.

**Returning the Precepts and Hymn of Praise**
The Heavenly Worthy, in great compassion,
Proclaims the precepts to deliver sentient beings.
Majestic virtue pervades the hidden and manifest,
And karmic retribution moves the divine.
All heavens come to bow in reverence,
While demonic hordes restrain their forms.
The past transcends the eight difficulties,
The present secures a thousand years of life.
When the fast’s blessings are fulfilled,
Together we send forth our sincere devotion.
The floating Sanskrit hymn soars on the clouds,
Incense and fragrant smoke intermingle.

The Jade Phoenix mounts the cinnabar carriage,
The Golden Dragon draws the verdant chariot.
In life and death, all know joy,
In family and state, all is peace.

**Ode to the Great Ultimate, with Exegesis**
The Dao takes fasting as its foremost practice,
Diligent cultivation ascends the Golden Portal.
Thus is the great Dharma Bridge established,
Universally delivering all beings and things.
Repaying the virtue of past lives,
The mind of Dao arises transcendent.
The body soars to ascend the Mystic Capital,
And the seven ancestors all attain liberation.

**From the *Ritual of Fasting and Majestic Demeanor in the Great Ultimate Sutra***
**Hymn of Studying Immortality**
To study immortality is urgent,
To uphold the precepts restrains the pure heart.
In emptiness and equanimity, the upright *qi* abides,
Immortal sages naturally seek one another.
If you do not believe the Dharma’s words,
Why dwell in the mountains and forests?

**Hymn of the Cavernous Void, from the *Scripture of the Cavernous Void and Numinous Chapters of the Divine Treasure***
The Primordial Beginning unfurls the chart,
Spreading forth the jade tablets.
Chanting the Cavernous Void in lofty song,
One strides into the Mystery on flying steps.
Divine kings deliver life,
Riding the void and mounting the mist.
Reverently reciting the numinous chapters,
They endure as long as the kalpas.

**Hymn of the Three Paths and Five Sufferings**
The Three Powers and the myriad things,
Each relies on the other in their allotted years.
The beginning and end span the great kalpas,
When blessings are exhausted, heaven and earth collapse.
Coming and going through the Five Paths,
How bitter to cycle through death and rebirth!
Revolving within the Three Paths,
Departing and returning, ever bound to calamity.
The great worthy heeds this precept,
Enduring the world and severing attachments.
The foolish do not believe the Dharma,
Their sins and pains ever cling to them.
I grieve that the world’s suffering knows no end,
And so I proclaim it again, now and of old.
If you wish to escape this calamity,
Take refuge in the Most High Scripture.
Sin and blessing arise not from another,
But truly emerge from your own self.
The great worthy thus guards his speech,
Seeking to cut off all evil roots.
Extinguishing thoughts and returning to forgetfulness,
Relying and submitting, awaiting their final dissolution.
To propagate the Dao and pacify the world,
In the end, one shall behold the True and Real.
Lust and jealousy are the chief of calamities,
The greatest afflictions that destroy the body.
Covetousness and indulgence bring such disaster,
Inevitably leading to premature ruin.
To know evil yet not reform it,
How can this bring peace to the Dao?
Harboring poison while feigning purity,
I now utter a long sigh.
Karma from past lives is surely real,
Yet the weak and lost call it nonexistent.
All desire to see it before their eyes,
Dismissing what passes beyond their gaze as false.
The great worthy, enlightened to the Dao’s teachings,
Wields the axe to pity the stubborn.
Tenderly mindful of your suffering,
Diligently I cause myself sorrow.
Human life is easily spent,
Like a flame in the oil.
The Four Great Elements temporarily meet,
The Five Aggregates are but provisional.
In the prime of youth, one should study diligently,
Hastening to seek the preservation of self.
When blessings are exhausted, body and spirit scatter,
Plunging into the dark hells below.
The sagely fear this,
And so seek the Dao to escape this calamity.
To study immortality is urgent,
To uphold the precepts restrains the pure heart.
In emptiness and equanimity, the upright *qi* abides,
Immortal sages naturally seek one another.
If you do not believe the Dharma’s words,
Why dwell in the mountains and forests?
The great worthy delights in the scriptures and precepts,
Receiving them as treasures for the body.
To pursue study is ever belated,
To cultivate the self is ever too late.
By the time one unravels the profound and obscure,
In the blink of an eye, one is already old.
Clutching the scroll, one sighs to the utmost,
Only to face death’s agony and sorrow.
Thus in my youth, I abandoned the world
To study the Dao.

**Composed by the Perfected of the Great Ultimate, from the *Scripture of the Fundamental Vows of the Divine Treasure Precepts***

**Exegesis of the Lamps**
The *Yellow Register Petition* of the Lower Prime’s Divine Immortals states: For the majestic demeanor of delivering from the roots of sin, the ten directions each have nine lamps lit, totaling ninety lamps. Beyond the capital’s gates, lamps are lit at the year’s station, the great and lesser tombs, the life star, and beside the gates, as many as the host can arrange. Each must shine brightly, illuminating the night without ceasing, never allowing them to extinguish.

The *Yellow Register Petition*—though the number of lamps is fixed, one must measure their strength and the altar’s size to arrange them, ensuring they do not hinder the proceedings or soil the robes of the participants.

The *Golden Tally Petition* of the Upper Prime’s Divine Immortals states: The majestic demeanor of lighting lamps is of utmost merit and virtue. Above, it illuminates the heavens; below, it illuminates the earth. The eight directions and nine lands all behold its radiance. It rests entirely with the lamp-attending officers to diligently apply their minds. Each lamp must shine brightly throughout the night, never extinguishing or dimming. Those who cut off the world’s ties should ever be vigilant.

The Flying Heavenly Divine Persons say: If scholars do not understand the rites of lighting lamps and burning incense, their seven ancestors will not be delivered from the long-night’s abode, and in the Nine Dark Realms, their bodies will lack light, subject to the trials of the Dark Yin Bureau.

Master Du Guangcheng says: The rite of lighting lamps originates from the *Golden Register Petition*. In all fasting and Daoist practices, burning incense and lighting lamps are the most urgent tasks. Incense conveys fragrance and transmits sincerity, ascending to move the Perfected and Numinous. Lamps dispel darkness and illuminate the hidden, descending to open the underworld’s long night. Thus the precepts state: Burning incense and lighting lamps illuminate the heavens’ halls of blessing above and the long-night hells below. Suffering souls and stagnant spirits, riding this light, may attain liberation. Since lamps must be lit, each has its symbolic form. In spring, nine; in summer, three; in autumn, seven; in winter, five; and in the four seasons, twelve—all arranged according to the Five Phases’ fundamental numbers. There are also lamps for the various heavens and earths, the Eight Trigrams and Nine Dark Realms, each positioned according to the *Golden Register Petition*, with incense burned and prayers recited. Blessings and virtue descend at once, and disasters and misfortunes naturally dissipate. Whether on the night of the fast’s commencement or within three or seven days, lamps are lit according to the method, and after the evening’s practices conclude, one exits the altar to the earth’s gate. With hymns and chants, banners and staffs, in orderly and refined steps, the master leads the assembly of disciples to circumambulate beneath the lamps, reciting prayers at each position. After each prayer, the assembly bows. When all prayers are complete, the Cavernous Void’s chant guides them back before the Mystic Master, dispersing as in the usual rite. Even if only at the earth’s gate, arranging the ranks to pray and recite accords with the method.

It is further said: In all *Yellow Register* rites, one should follow the true texts and jade instructions. Beyond the four seasons’ lamps, one separately lights the *Golden Register* lamps, bowing and praying according to the method. Whether performing this within three days or praying for a single night, all will gain blessings and benefits, and both the hidden and manifest will receive grace. Even if not within a fasting altar, lighting these lamps and bowing according to the method yields equal merit.

The virtuous and noble should widely propagate this.

**Hymn of the Bright Lamp**
The Orthodox Unity’s yang-light,
Flaming upward in vermilion smoke.
Twelve Divine Lads of Illumination,
Pervading all under heaven and our own bodies.
A hundred evils shattered and cast down,
Ten thousand demons repelled.
Radiance clear and luminous,
Communing with the true and reaching the numinous.
Ascending into the formless,
Merging with the Dao in spontaneity.

*From the* Orthodox Numinous Treasure’s *Upper Prime Golden Register Simplified Texts, True Immortals’ Section: Ritual of Lighting Lamps*

**Three Hymns of the Bright Lamp**
The Most High scatters to the ten directions,
Flowering lamps convey sincerity.
All heavens likewise shine,
All earths are profoundly bright.
My body, too, is luminous and clear,
The five viscera blossoming in splendor.
Fiery light illumines the Great Prime,
Distant thoughts flourish in Jade Clarity.
Cinnabar essence lodged in the Great Void,
Mysterious yang resounds in the void.
Embracing form, eradicating the roots of suffering,
Profound and wondrous, thoughts of the utmost truth.
Hanging blossoms reveal no substance,
Causal conditions manifest as light’s image.
My body is likewise thus,
Riding transformation, entrusting to the flowing radiance.
Night’s light marks the cinnabar yang,
Far-reaching, illuminating the numinous chamber.
All heavens universally shine,
All yin realms vanish like the sun.
My spirit, too, is keen and bright,
Ever delighting in wisdom and insight.
Carefree, attuned to the Dao’s movement,
Transience and renewal follow heaven’s power.
Raising my form, I tread the cavernous void,
Night’s torch gleams with streaming brilliance.

*From the* Cavernous Perfection’s *Observation of the Great Precepts, seen in Master Lu’s Ritual of Lighting Lamps, Prayers, and Dignified Conduct*

**Hymn of Extinguishing the Lamp**
Mysterious yin’s tranquil light,
Eternal lamp continues brightness.
The Great Yang now radiant,
The Eight Dark Realms open to clarity.
The lamp returns to the Great Yin,
Light adheres to the radiance’s arising.
The Two Perfected of Sun and Moon,
Merge and unite with me.

*From the* Upper Prime Golden Register Simplified Texts, True Immortals’ Section: Ritual of Lighting Lamps*

**Explanation of Presenting the Dragon Tablet**
The *Lower Prime Yellow Register Simplified Texts, Numinous Immortals’ Section* states: For the ritual of delivering from the roots of transgression, when the fast is fully completed, one should follow the jade instructions and present one golden dragon tablet. Inscribed with cinnabar on a jade slip, bound with azure silk, it serves as a token of ascent and deliverance to the numinous mountain. It is hung in the midst of sheer cliffs, strictly adhering to the full method.

It further states: For the ritual of summoning the Water Thearch’s power, one should inscribe cinnabar on a jade slip, attach one golden dragon tablet, bind it with azure silk, and sink it into the Three Rivers as a token of ascent and deliverance to the Water Thearch, strictly following the jade instructions and complete text.

It further states: When the summoning of the Water Thearch is complete, take nine jade slips, golden dragon tablets, and golden buttons, bind them with azure silk, and bury them at the altar site to report and covenant with the Earth Official, entirely according to the ritual statutes.

The *Jade Tablet Covenant with the True Statutes* states: When performing the *Yellow Register* precious fast, one should use three taels of superior gold to cast golden dragons. Each dragon weighs one tael. The state uses superior gold, nobles and high ministers use secondary gold, scholars and commoners may use silver or bronze gilded, all of which are permissible, accompanied by the tablet text. The jade slip should record the purpose of the fast, the state’s reign title, the year, month, and day, the Dharma Master’s name, and the location of the offering, then cast it into famous mountains and caverns, numinous springs and dragon lairs, or the fast’s altar or its vicinity, to covenant with the Three Treasuries of Heaven, Earth, and Water, allowing them to witness and verify the fast’s merit. Those who neglect this will be examined by the Nine Offices of the Earth Official.

The statutes say: The dragon rides the clouds’ qi, governs yin and yang, coalesces to form a body, disperses to compose patterns, its transformations unfathomable, entering earth and ascending heaven. Thus, the thirty-six heavens, the utmost yang’s realm, can serve as couriers to transmit messages, communicating with the mysterious and numinous—such is the dragon. The dragon is a yang creature. Of heaven’s uses, none surpass the dragon; of earth’s uses, none surpass the tortoise; of humanity’s uses, none surpass the horse. Thus, in heaven, dragons serve as couriers, coming and going among humans. Gold is the foremost of the five metals, unyielding and unchanging, treasured by heaven and earth, communicating with the numinous and uniting with the divine. Therefore, superior gold is used to cast it in the dragon’s form, presenting it to cavernous palaces to covenant with the Three Primes. The true officials of cavernous palaces, their subordinate offices, receive the dragon token and tablet text, record its good merits, and memorialize them to the Most High. The response to this resonance is like a shadow following form. Those who cultivate and esteem this must not neglect it.

The tablet is for reporting, recording, and inscribing. It records the world’s goodness and reports to the Highest Perfected. Its length is one foot and two inches, symbolizing the twelve earthly branches. Its width is two inches and four fen, corresponding to the twenty-four true qi. Its thickness is two fen, symbolizing the Two Modes. Its top and bottom are square, corresponding to the sun’s square radiance, upright and true, penetrating and reaching without avoidance or evasion. The state uses jade for it, as jade possesses nine virtues and can serve as a token for rites to the great earth spirits, hence jade is used. Nobles, ministers, and commoners universally use hibiscus wood, as its purity and fine texture can compare to jade, clarifying the distinction between noble and base.

The jade disk is a treasure for rites to heaven, earth, and mountains and rivers, made of jade. For mountain tablets, use one round disk, its color blue-green, two inches in diameter, hollow in the center. The mountain tablet serves as a token to the Nine Heavens, hence a blue-green disk is used, corresponding to heaven and earth. For water tablets, use a six-pointed disk, its color black, three inches in diameter, hollow in the center. The water tablet serves as a token to the Nine Seas’ Water Officials, hence a dark disk is used, the color of water. Six points correspond to water’s number. For earth tablets, use a yellow disk, square, two inches in diameter, hollow in the center. The earth tablet serves as a token to the Nine Earths, yellow being earth’s color. Square corresponds to earth’s form. The disk and dragon accompany the sealed tablet, bound with azure silk.

The method for presenting the three tablets uses nine golden buttons. Three tablets use twenty-seven buttons. Golden buttons replace the blood oath, azure silk replaces cutting hair, conveying sincerity in covenant, most weighty. Therefore, azure silk binds the buttons and disk, attaching them to the tablet and dragon, and only then are they released. The button method: the state uses gold; ministers and commoners may use silver or bronze gilded. The button’s diameter is nine fen, its exterior round like a ring.

Upon completing the purification fast, select an auspicious day—or the very day of the fast—to prepare the offering feast. The ritual master, assembled officials, the fast’s sponsor, and disciples either sail by boat to the water cavern or ascend by land to the mountain gate. Outside the cavern, they clear the grass, sweep, and purify the ground, then arrange the offering mats. Wine, fruit, viands, dried venison, broth, tea, and other items are set forth: sixty portions for the state, twenty-four for ministers and commoners. Following the solemn rite’s protocol, they don robes, bathe, rinse their mouths, and pay homage in the ritual proceedings, adhering strictly to the prescribed forms.

The local divine officers, inspectors, and guardian officials must act as intermediaries, opening the cavern’s gates to the celestial bureaus within, transmitting the fast’s inscribed tablets. Thus, blessings and virtue are swiftly realized. No one may omit the gate-opening and directly cast the tablets into the cavern, for such neglect fails to reach the true spirits and instead invites punishment. Should the mountain or water cavern lie too distant for the entire assembly to travel or ascend, select one or two ritual officers from the altar, along with disciples, to bear the tablets to the cavern. There, they perform the offering rites, open the gates, and present the tablets exactly as prescribed.

When the state presents the Dragon Tablets to the Five Peaks and other sacred mountains, the Golden Register’s protocols apply, differing in complexity from these ordinary rites. If the fast’s sponsor is constrained by public or private duties and cannot personally visit the cavern, choose one devout, reverent, and trustworthy attendant to perform the rites in their stead. If no substitute is available, the master may act as intermediary to transmit the tablets. Under no circumstances may the inscribed tablets be concealed or delayed, for such neglect breaches the covenant’s faith. The local divine officers will record and report the lapse, and the resulting offense is no trifling matter—take utmost care.

*End of Scroll Thirty-Five of the* Instant Rites of the Supreme Yellow Register Great Fast
*Scroll Thirty-Six of the* Instant Rites of the Supreme Yellow Register Great Fast

At the outset of establishing the fast, the *Investiture Prayer* is offered:

Vast and formless, the empty void,
Endless, it moves the numinous.
Reverence draws Heaven’s grace,
Neglect invites demonic intrusion.
Fortune and misfortune turn with fate,
Adversity and prosperity arise from karmic conditions.
The Dao does not prize pearls or jade,
The gods respond only to utmost sincerity.
With redoubled devotion, exhaust all toil,
With earnest sincerity, pour forth the heart’s truth.
Thus the Great Dao is naturally attained,
And all receive the descent of true spirits.
Holding incense, we state our vows,
Bowing our heads in reverence to exalted purity.
The Heavenly Worthy abides in serene quiescence,
Turn the heart to worship the distant and obscure.

*Opening the Hall Hymn*
To study the Dao, one must toil diligently,
Gather faith and circulate the cinnabar sincerity.

True qi mingles with fragrant smoke.
We only pray for the opening of great pardon,
That the seven ancestors may depart the dark realms.

*Three Refuges Hymn*
With utmost sincerity, we take refuge in
The Dao Treasures of the ten directions.
May all beings arise with minds of dedication,
Offering devotion in all acts of worship.

Receiving, upholding, reciting, and transmitting.

With utmost sincerity, we take refuge in
The Master Treasures of the ten directions.
May all beings universally ascend the Dharma bridge,
Without obstruction.

*Hymn on Hearing the Scriptures*
After hearing the scriptures,
May all beings have their myriad transgressions forever dissolved,
And the sprouts of goodness grow ever stronger.

After hearing the scriptures,
May all beings deeply enter the Dharma gate,
Taking refuge with faith and acceptance.

After hearing the scriptures,
May all beings forever sever delusion,
Constantly cultivating the supreme Dao.

All within the Dao altar,
Each directing their minds,
Take refuge in the Three Treasures, the supreme and venerable,
In all recitations.

The Water Officials descend with dragon chariots,
Cloud brocade rising from the azure waves.

*Inviting the Five Emperors Hymn*
The Five Emperors dwell among the immortal ranks,
Rectifying the causes of good and evil.
Auspicious light suffuses the cosmos,

Enjoying blessings forever without end.

To protect and bind the fast’s participants.

*Burning the Memorial Hymn*
In life, we face many obstacles and hardships,
The Great Dao truly pities and cherishes.
Through salvation and deliverance, it leaves statutes and precepts,
All are enabled to repent their karmic causes.
Transgressions are recorded in the earthly prisons,
Offenses have already been heard in Heaven.
Revealing our prayers, we seek true protection,
With sincere hearts, we look up to the sages.
Reverently worshipping the Three Treasures,
We wish to deliver the nine lineages,
Prolonging life and years.
The memorial is burned and ascends to the upper realms,
Names are presented before the Jade Emperor.

Myriad recitations, the Dao naturally accompanies.
Jade peaks flourish in the forest of gems,
Life and death dwell in the abode of blessings.
Without the Yellow Register,
How could the roots of suffering be eradicated?
Circling and reciting the numinous chapters,
The five spirits mutually support one another.

*Investing the Dragon Tablets Hymn*
Praying to the Perfected, ascending the Purple Mansion—mountain tablets,
Earth tablets, water tablets—clouds of the Purple Mansion,
Announcing the mandate to the numinous altar.

**Mountain Tablets and Water Tablets Hymn**
Mountain tablets—Clouds of the Numinous Peak,
Water tablets—Clouds of the Numinous Spring.

Golden lads offer fragrant incense smoke.
Names inscribed traverse the Nine Earths,
Characters arrayed ascend the Three Heavens.
Eternally partaking of boundless life,
They consummate as the loftiest immortals.

**Dissolving the Altar Hymn**
The Great Void embraces all forms,
The Supreme Dao is profound, its form primordial.
Receiving harmony, it permeates wondrous qi,
Responding to resonance, it reaches the heart’s sincerity.
In an instant, it pervades the Eight Extremities,
Vaguely descending with the myriad spirits.
Subtle incense presents pure offerings,
Surrendering the self to express cinnabar sincerity.
Far-flung, the soaring luan canopy,
Distant, the climbing of brocade phoenix banners.
The incense palace towers, lush and verdant,
The cloud pavilion ascends, serene and still.
The jade carriage emerges from the celestial river,
The golden dragon enters the Great Clarity.
Sweet dew cools the mortal world,
Auspicious blessings blanket the hidden and the bright.

**Hymn for Sending Forth the Master**
The purification rites now complete,
We reverently receive the mysterious grace.
With devoted hearts, we bow in homage,
To send forth Master So-and-so.
May your cloud chariot not tarry,
Your crane carriage is hard to detain.
When next we hold purification rites,
We shall again invite your presence.

**Hymn for Sending Forth the Sutra Master**
Though the scriptural Dharma is profound,
Its reverence depends entirely on the master.
All who establish goodness
Should wish to venerate him.
With qi in motion, merit is easily achieved,
But a careless heart brings regret hard to undo.
If one can diligently fix the mind,
Morning and evening, one shall naturally ascend as an immortal.

**Hymn for Sending Forth the Register Master**
The Dao holds purification rites in highest esteem,
The Dharma makes audience a constant practice.
Those who neither cultivate nor revere—
How can they wander to the imperial realm?

The Purple Chamber naturally opens.
The Mysterious Woman arrays her cloud carriage,
And one beholds only halls of gold and silver.
Thus we take leave of the Three Masters,
Bowing in homage to the August Void.

**Hymn for Sending Forth the Liberation Master**
Far-off stands the Jade Capital Mountain,
How towering is the Dark Metropolis!
The Perfected ride the void-steps,

At the edge of the heavens, we envision the homeward path,
Hearing the jade pendants tinkle like coral.

**Hymn for Sending Forth the Five Emperors**
The immortal retinue arrives from the celestial extremity,
Honored presence arrayed in the Five Directions.
Banners and winds stir the feathered regalia,
Luan carriages halt in the pure precinct.
As the purification rites near completion,
The returning chariots ascend to the Upper Azure.
Their flowing grace knows no bounds,
How could it be merely for the fragrance of incense?

**Hymn for Sending Forth the Heavenly Official**
The wondrous model of purification rites is upright,
The luminous statutes wash clean the roots of sin.
Gazing upon the vault of heaven, we exalt the supreme good,
Passing through earnest supplications, we convey subtle words.
Having accepted the petition and invitation,
We receive the bestowed blessings of pardon and grace.
The Heavenly Official returns to the Jade Palace,
His precious carriage enters the Golden Gate.

**Hymn for Sending Forth the Earthly Official**
The pure assembly’s audience of the Primordial now complete,
The merits of the purification rites bear fruit in perfection.
True grace is proclaimed to the Five Marchmounts,
Sincere devotion is presented to the Three Heavens.
The mat’s empty model now withdrawn,
We dissolve the altar and send forth the host of immortals.
The Earthly Official returns to his Marchmount palace,
Ascending in his five-spirit chariot.

**Hymn for Sending Forth the Water Official**
The proclamation of the mysterious tones now finished,
The various immortals return to the Upper Empyrean.
The numinous wind dispels misfortune,
Sweet dew repays true merit.
The command fulfilled, the dragon-drawn carriage,
Returns afar to the Palace of Bright Yang.
The Water Official returns to his grotto palace,
Bestowing blessings and prosperity without end.

**Hymn for Sending Forth the Altar Inspector**
The numinous altar exalts the Dharma seat,
Rightly relying on the descent of the inspector.
Correcting transgressions and recording good deeds,
Even the true immortals look up in admiration.
Soon he shall drive his Daoist steed,
Vanishing into the depths of the five-colored clouds.
While living, one may depend on his aid,
And further, he shall deliver the hidden and submerged.

**Hymn for Sending Forth the Celestial Master**
The purification rites now refined and solemn,
The memorial tablets ascend to the heavens.
Utmost sincerity penetrates resonance,
The entire household gains extended years.
The dark prisons of the netherworld,
All sins and sufferings are absolved.
He holds the registers of all heavens,
His memorials presented before the Emperor.
Ancestors are all liberated and ascended,
Descendants rejoice in honor and promotion.
The Lord Who Upholds the Teaching of the Three Heavens,
Having completed the rites, reports the fulfillment of merit.

**Hymn for Sending Forth the Mysterious Master**
The Supreme Emperor commands the true immortals,
To perform purification rites at the Yellow Register Altar.
The various heavens descend in response,
Incense burned to repent transgressions.
The nine watches of Dao-circuits now complete,
The purification rites have come full circle.
The deceased souls attain liberation,
The Mysterious Master ascends to the Nine Heavens.

**Hymn of the Returning Radiance and Flying Light**
Resplendent, the brimming goblet lamp,
Flickering like moonlight.
Reflected back, its name is Returning Radiance,
Filling the void with the semblance of arrayed stars.
Its streaming light like a rainbow,
Scattering brilliance, giving birth to lotus blossoms.
Mistakenly entering the cavern of jade and chalcedony,
One finds oneself in the chamber of jade mushrooms.
Jade maidens gleam with jade pendants,
Golden lads illuminate golden robes.
The myriad spirits ascend the Dao’s shore,
The host of Perfected gathers in the flowery hall.
The dragon tower turns twelve times,
Day and night, its light revolves in radiance.

**Hymn of the Luminous Light**
The Most High Lord of the Great Dao,
Dwells in the realm of No-Where.
The precious light of the true youths
Descends to govern the Nine Dark Chambers.
Lamenting the suffering souls in bondage,
Liberating them from bitter sorrow.
The twenty-four gates and portals,
All are made to hear the fragrance of the precious incense.
The lamp’s light illumines the long night,
May it dissolve the calamities of accumulated kalpas.

**Hymn to the Northern Emperor**
We bow in homage to the Supreme Dao,
Our hearts turn to the Primordial Honored One.
The wondrously responsive Lord of the Utmost Real,
Opens and transforms the soaring Mystery Gate.
The wondrous precepts delight the Five Spirits,
The golden script admonishes the myriad gods.
Examining fate, he determines the register,
The numinous talismans liberate suffering souls.
Riding clouds to audience the Jade Emperor,
In perfect accord with the people of the Mysterious Center.

**Hymn for Burning the Tablets**
The Most High’s Dharma is subtle and wondrous,
Register upon register liberates heaven and humankind.
The Primordial Beginning announces the talismanic decree,
At the appointed hour, one attains ascension as an immortal.
Transmitting salvation to the drowned,
All attain effortless freedom.
Names inscribed on the golden register tablets,
Wandering freely before the Jade Emperor.

**Eulogy of the White Crane**
The Perfected of the Great One, with a countenance of ice and snow,
Treading the void, coming and going without trace.
To Penglai he must go—now he departs,
Clouds linger at the window, the crane perches in the pine.
The white crane returns but once in a thousand years,
Mountains and rivers remain unchanged, mortals grow scarce.
Were it not for the clear words of the marble pillar,
Who would recognize Ding Lingwei of that time?
The white crane descends from the Nine Heavens,
Its several clear cries resound through auspicious mist.
Sun and moon hasten, mortals age swiftly—
Better to cultivate the Dao and learn to be an immortal.
The wondrous bird, born of transformation, cries in the Nine Heavens,
Snow-white feathers, cinnabar crown—both gleam resplendent.
Mortals fail to recognize its return to the marble pillar,
Bringing auspicious signs of peace for a hundred million years.

**Hymn of Scattering Flowers**

On Jade Capital Mountain, the assembly of the Perfected gathers in the Scattering Flowers Grove,
Ten immortals together intone the *Step-in-Emptiness* melody, scattering blossoms to fill the ritual ground—
An offering before the Heavenly Worthy.

Five-colored auspicious clouds follow their steps as they depart the Scattering Flowers Grove,
Six-jewel immortal robes draped upon them as they arrive to fill the ritual ground—
An offering before the Heavenly Worthy.

A resonant note from the Void descends beneath the moon in the Scattering Flowers Grove,
Three chants of *Step-in-Emptiness* ascend into the clouds to fill the ritual ground—
An offering before the Heavenly Worthy.

**Ten Remembrances**

First, Heaven and Earth in harmonious union;
Second, sun and moon in lofty brightness;
Third, yin and yang in orderly succession;
Fourth, the realm at peace and tranquility;
Fifth, the sovereign’s ten thousand years of longevity;

**Here ends Scroll Thirty-Six of the *Ritual of the Supreme Yellow Register Great Fast***
**Scroll Thirty-Seven of the *Ritual of the Supreme Yellow Register Great Fast*** begins.

The Venerable Master Chongjing of the Three Caverns, posthumously styled Master Guang, transmitted the teachings to the Supreme Enforcer of the Dao, Immortal Jiang Shuyu, who compiled this section on the sequence of ritual praises.

**Establishing the Grand Fast and Enacting the Supreme Rites**
The principles are manifold, and the practices indeed intricate. Only by adhering strictly to the regulations can resonance with the unseen be achieved. Should the sequence be neglected or altered at will, not only would it mislead the spirits and the living, but it might also offend the celestial statutes. Thus, we meticulously expound upon the ancient canons and establish this standardized ritual. From beginning to end, all must conform to the prescribed model.

**Sequence for Invoking the Officers**
First, before the hall, arrange the positions for the Merit-Officers, Talisman-Messengers, and divine attendants, with offerings of incense, tea, wine, and fruit.

Next, intone the *Tang Song*; then, the Dharma Master ascends to offer incense and makes a silent memorial. The Ritual Officer then performs two bows while offering incense. The Dharma Master transforms the spirits and paces the *Dang* steps. The assembly moves to the officers’ positions for purification by sprinkling.

The *Yin Suming Zan* is sung, incense is offered, and the scriptures are recited. The *Zan Jing* follows the prescribed form. The *Jing Nian* is chanted in stillness. The *Qing Zhuan Falun* is intoned, and the scriptures are recited. Upon completion, the *Dujing* strikes the chime, and the *Shijing* collects the scriptures. The *Jiezuo Song* is recited, followed by the *Qili Tan Jing*. The *San Wen Jing Zan* is sung, then the *Yin Taishang Zhihui Jing Zan*, concluding with the dedication of merits.

If ascending the altar to recite the scriptures, the assembly stands in ranks before the Mystic Master. The *Dujing* intones the *Dao Zan*. The *Huaxia* ascends the altar and enters the chamber, as in the audience ritual. Upon reaching their positions, they stand in formation and chant the *Three Refuges*. The scriptures are recited in order. Upon completion, the *Xuexian Song* is sung. The assembly exits the altar before the Mystic Master, and the dedication of merits concludes. The assembly disperses to the refectory as usual.

**Sequence for Presenting Memorials**
First, arrange the ritual space, setting out offerings before the central Three Treasures. To the left, place the positions for the Orthodox Unity’s Three Masters; to the right, the positions for the Memorial Officers and Divine Generals, in thirty-six divisions. The Daoist assembly stands in ranks before the Celestial Master’s Hall. The Dharma Master offers incense. The Ritual Officer offers incense and bows. The *An Ren Ge* is sung, each participant expressing reverence. The Master is invited. The Ritual Officer offers incense and bows again. The libation ritual proceeds. The Dharma Master offers incense, kneels, and presents the memorial’s intent. The hymn leads to the Memorial Officers’ Hall. The Dharma Master offers incense.

Following the divine standards of the Lower Prime Yellow Register’s Immortal Ranks, a sacred altar is established. A propitious day is chosen to conduct the Supreme Yellow Register Grand Retreat, observing three days and three nights of ritual, with nine periods of circumambulation. In due order, the true precepts are proclaimed, petitions and memorials are presented, and talismanic decrees are issued. The sinful and wayward are delivered, the imprisoned and forsaken are released. Lamps are kindled to perpetuate light, and their radiance shatters the prisons of the damned. Universal alms of unstinting sustenance are bestowed, and the summoned souls of the departed are offered salvation. They are bathed and robed anew, to attend the Perfected and hear the Dharma. Talismans are transmitted, precepts conferred, and through refinement and deliverance, transcendence is achieved. Upon completion, the merits are declared in memorials, and dragon tablets are cast into the waters. A pure offering is solemnly prepared, with three hundred and sixty divine stations. In profound gratitude for boundless grace, all accumulated virtues are dedicated to ascension and deliverance. Humbly beseeching your merciful favor, may all—living and dead—be universally saved. With utmost sincerity, this petition is respectfully submitted."*

The *Thirty-Two Heavens Talismans* also appear in the *Dongzhen Shanggong Taizhen Keyuan Dong Jiu Tian Shengshen Baoming Zhai Yi*, each differing in form.

**Nine Hells Lamp Diagram**
The Dark Master states: *"Model heaven, emulate earth—square and round form the pattern. The Nine Nether Yins’ Courts, where sin is judged and punishment meted out, lie in Fengdu of the southeast."* According to the *Taiyi Shengzhen Ke*, nine altars of earth or stone are constructed, each two feet square. The nine altars together span six feet, symbolizing earth’s yin extremity and the image of two sixes. Each altar is surrounded by three curved walls, shaped like a prison. One lamp is lit per altar, three torches per altar—nine altars in all, totaling twenty-seven lamps. At the center of the nine altars, a placard is erected, its **obverse side** inscribed with the *Jade Clarity Earth-Prison-Breaking True Talisman*, its **reverse side** with the name of the hell. Beside it stand nine green bamboo poles, each nine feet tall, each bearing a small banner inscribed with the sacred titles of the *Ten Directions Lingbao Heavenly Worthies*. At the top of each banner is written the *Fengdu Talisman*. When the time comes to break open the hells, the lamp-attending Dharma Master recites the *Earth-Prison-Breaking Rite*, proceeding direction by direction. The Dharma Master, holding the *Lingbao Staff*, chants the *Earth-Prison-Breaking Incantation*. The assembly responds with *"Ten Directions Savior-from-Suffering Heavenly Worthy!"*, then burns the talisman over the hell-lamp. The Dharma Master strikes the prison with the staff, burns the green banners, and replaces them with yellow ones. Thus the earth-prisons open in radiance, and the deceased souls ascend to truth.

**Nine Nether Lamps Diagram**
The *Dongxuan Lingbao Yuanshi Tianzun Shuo San Tu Wu Ku Ba Du Miao Jing* states: *"To deliver and rescue the dead, lighting lamps is supreme. The Five Directions and Eight Extremities, the earth-prisons and dark dungeons, lie in the land of utmost yin, the realm of eternal night. The souls of the dead are imprisoned, cut off from the Lord’s light. In the gloom, they endure every torment and torture. Therefore, erect a lamp-tree and light nine lamps, from the day of death through the seven sevens. Let the lamp-light continue unbroken, illuminating the Nine Nether. Upon seeing this radiance, they shall be liberated."* Now, plant a pole at the center and light nine lamps in sequence, totaling eighty-one lamps, to universally illuminate the profound darkness and deliver the suffering souls.

**Revolving Radiance Wheel Lamp Diagram**
The Dark Master states: *"The covenant of alliance with the true has the pattern of revolving radiance and descending light, repenting the Five Accumulations and opening the karmic gates of life and death, shattering the sin-courts of black darkness."* The method employs catalpa wood to fashion a wheel in the likeness of a chariot axle. The **upper tier** holds twelve lamps; the **middle tier**, sixteen lamps.

The **lower tier** holds twenty-one lamps, totaling forty-nine lamps. At the center, inscribe the names of the Five Accumulations’ suffering gates and the various hells upon plaques, following the *Revolving Radiance Lamp Rite*. Further, craft forty-nine small banners, alternating in yellow and white, upon which are written the sacred titles of the Heavenly Worthies from the *Luminous Canons*. At the top of each banner, inscribe in vermilion the talisman to shatter Fengdu. The attendant lamp-master recites the repentance lamp liturgy, while the grand master, holding a ritual staff, follows the repentance rite to each hell, planting the staff and intoning the great Brahmanic incantations. Sprinkling water with a willow branch, they burn the small silk banners upon the lamps. Thus, all sinful souls in the hells, riding the yang radiance, shall be liberated from their sufferings in that very moment, severing the roots of the Five Accumulations’ afflictions and directly departing from the karmic bonds of worldly toil.

As per the original liturgical manual, this method has long fallen into disuse. It is fitting to follow the rites of Cai Zhixu and Lu Shizhong, constructing the wheel from sand: square without, round within, nine feet in diameter, arranged in three tiers resembling a chariot wheel. The **first, outer ring** has twenty-four spokes; the **second, middle ring**, fifteen spokes; the **third, inner ring**, nine spokes. At the center, erect one *Revolving Radiance Spirit Banner* and light ten lamps. On the nine spokes of the inner ring, place nine lamps, and behind each lamp, set plaques marking the Three Evil Gates, the Three Corpse Paths, and the Three Wretched Realms. On the fifteen spokes of the middle ring, light fifteen lamps, and behind each, set plaques marking the Five Accumulations, the Five Paths, and the Five Suffering Gates. On the twenty-four spokes of the outer ring, light twenty-four lamps, and behind each, set plaques marking the Twenty-Four Hells. Again, craft forty-nine small banners in alternating yellow and white, arranging them beside the lamps. Upon completing the repentance lamp rite, burn all banners and plaques upon the lamps. The inner ring’s nine banners and plaques...

In the *Great Rites of the Numinous Treasure*, the Edict of Longevity is addressed to the couriers of the Golden Dragon Post, while the Edict for Salvation from Suffering is directed to the riders of the Jiaolong Cavalry. The forms of these talismans, however, have long been rife with errors, and the transmitted versions lack incantatory formulas. Thus, though I have corrected their graphic forms in this manuscript, I have not had time to incorporate them fully. Nevertheless, as these talismans have been employed by successive generations of masters, they cannot be abandoned. Here, I append the versions revised by Lin Huiling.

*Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure*

*Most High Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure*
*Life-Prolonging Destiny-Delivering Supreme August Yellow Register*

On the [day] of [month], in the year of [cyclical year] under the reign of [Tai Sui], [name], of [native place], humbly petitions on behalf of deceased kin [name], offering a Green Petition to express utmost gratitude to Heaven’s grace. At the Yellow Register Retreat altar, [name] beseeches the transmission of the *Most High Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure Life-Prolonging Destiny-Delivering Supreme August Yellow Register* of the first rank, to be conferred upon the soul of [name], that it may traverse the Three Realms and ascend to the Nine Heavens.

As the scriptures state: Of old, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, abiding in the Wondrous Realm of the Nine Purities and the Palace of the Three Primes, expounded the most profound teachings amidst the sacred assemblies of the heavens, enlightening humans and devas, marking meritorious deeds, and inscribing names upon the Yellow Register—golden tablets and jade slips arrayed within the Three Clarities. In every hell, the Ten Directions’ Savior-from-Suffering Heavenly Worthy was beheld, descending into the Nine Glooms to deliver all from torment.

The Heavenly Worthy universally proclaimed to the four assemblies: "If you can receive and uphold the Golden Register and White Slips, the Nine Perfected Wondrous Precepts, the Life-Prolonging Numinous Talismans, and the Savior-from-Suffering True Talismans, you shall dissolve the great sins of the Nine Glooms and have your names inscribed in the Nine Palaces. The Youths Who Examine Destiny, the Mighty Spirits Who Guard the Precepts, the Direct Talismans of the Five Thearchs, and the Clerks of the Six Palaces shall naturally follow the talismanic writ to shelter and protect those who receive the precepts."

"Now, disciples, I shall clearly expound for you the Nine Perfected Wondrous Precepts and the Golden Register White Slips. The merit of their reception and upholding, the deliverance from calamity and salvation from suffering, are of unfathomable spiritual power."

The assembled spirits bowed their heads, prostrating to receive the teachings.

The Heavenly Worthy declared:

First, uphold reverence and deference, honoring and nurturing father and mother.
Second, be diligent and steadfast, loyal to your lord and sovereign.
Third, do not kill, but with compassion deliver all beings.
Fourth, do not commit adultery, but rectify the body and dwell rightly among things.
Fifth, do not steal, but extend righteousness and diminish the self.
Sixth, do not harbor wrath, lest fierce anger drown others.
Seventh, do not deceive, lest flattery and treachery harm the good.
Eighth, do not be arrogant, lest pride and contempt slight the Perfected.
Ninth, do not waver, but uphold the precepts with single-minded devotion.

The Mighty Spirits Who Guard the Precepts,
the Youths Who Examine Destiny,
and the Savior-from-Suffering True Talismans proclaim this writ:

By the Primordial Talismanic Mandate, the Golden Register White Slips, and the Savior-from-Suffering True Talismans, let it be decreed to the boundless worlds of the ten directions, the Three Bureaus and Nine Offices, the One Hundred Twenty Courts, the Examiners of the Five Thearchs, the Nine Glooms of Hell, the Mighty Heavenly Enforcers, the Punitive Divine Soldiers, the Lords of Destiny and Record-Keepers, the Ministers of Merit and Execution, the Ox-Headed Jailers, and the Great Demons of the Three Realms:

Deliver the soul of so-and-so, extricating it from hell, forever parting from the eternal night, to behold the light. May all sins be swept away, all enmities dissolved. By the merit of upholding these Nine Perfected Wondrous Precepts, ascend to the heavens above, all in accordance with this decree.

Proclaimed on the [day] of the [month] in the [year] at the Yellow Register Retreat Altar.

The One Hundred Twenty Court Officials,
the Talismans of Longevity,
proclaim this writ.

By the Primordial Mandate of the Origin, the Golden Register and White Tablet, the Talismans of Longevity proclaim this writ to the Cinnabar Heavenly Realm of the South, the Vermilion Tomb of Fire, the Southern Prosperity Upper Offices, the Great Lord of Longevity, the Venerable Han and Sima, the Lords of Destiny and Record-Keepers, the Divine Extenders of Lifespan and Augmenters of Years, the Exalted Spirits of Deliverance from Calamity, the Restorers of Bones and Raisers of the Dead, and the Great Divine Overseers of Life:

Deliver the soul of so-and-so, ascending to the Vermilion Palace and the Flowing Fire Courtyard. May the jade eyes refine the essence, the yellow blossoms purify the form. Inscribe the name upon the purple tablets, receive transformation and rebirth. By the merit of this Golden Register’s deliverance of life, ascend to the heavens above, all in accordance with this decree.

Proclaimed on the [day] of the [month] in the [year] at the Yellow Register Retreat Altar.

The Exalted Spirits of Restoring Bones and Raising the Dead,
The Great Divine Overseers of Life,
The Mandates of the Thearchs,

Receive the delivered and transgressed soul of so-and-so, who this day reverently approaches the Yellow Register Retreat Altar to receive the Supreme *Tai Shang Dong Xuan Ling Bao* Unsurpassed Yellow Register of Longevity and Deliverance of Life, First Rank.

As the ritual prescribes, uphold and maintain it, that the waters may fully aid in deliverance. Between heaven and earth, let all honor and faithfully practice it, in accordance with the Mysterious Statutes and Ordinances.

Given on the [day] of the [month] in the [year] at the Yellow Register Retreat Altar of the [prefecture], [county], [abbey/temple].

[Seal of the] Sponsoring Master, [Dharma rank and name]
[Seal of the] Supervising Master, [Dharma rank and name]
[Seal of the] Delivering Master, [Dharma rank and name]

The *Tai Shang Dong Xuan Ling Bao* Unsurpassed Yellow Register of Longevity and Deliverance of Life:

This Yellow Register of Longevity and Deliverance is solely for the deliverance of the deceased; no other registers shall be issued. Write upon yellow paper in vermilion ink, or upon jade hall paper in gold ink. Once the figures are fully painted in colors, inscribe the name of the delivered soul as "Delivered Soul of So-and-So" in six characters. Only after completion shall the Flowing Fire Pavilion and Fire-Refining Talisman be made. After the seals and signatures are affixed, mark the reverse with blue, purple, yellow, or red. Use a scripture ribbon and scroll ends.

Nowadays, in the registers and proclamations of ancestral altars, the figures within the pavilion are the Fire-Refining Talismans. All shall be written in dispersed form.

The above follows the *Yellow Register Rites* of Cai Zhixu. The Jade Hall calls it the Golden Register, though not as fully detailed. The *Purple Radiance Numinous Writ* contains the *Unsurpassed Alliance of the True Jade Casket of the Southern Prosperity Upper Offices Yellow Register*, but only includes the register text and the officials of the Southern Prosperity Offices. Suspected omissions and errors therein are not corrected here.

Here, the transmitted secret texts are collated with the *Supreme Lord’s Jade Chapters* and the *Three Caverns Talisman Formulae*, verified through careful examination to approximate the highest principles. Those who cultivate the Dao must first master the incantations and study the forms of the talismans in detail. Only then may the written talismans be correctly executed, their application evoking resonance and response.

**Precious Register for Ascending to Heaven**

The Precious Register for the Most High’s Salvation and Pardon for Ascending to Heaven is issued to the masters of the Ten Directions, Three Realms, and Nine Dark Realms.
The dharma master of rank [X], [Named], now, on behalf of the [X] village and district’s supplicant seeking blessings for the living, petitions this bureau. As the plea cannot be denied, beginning on the [X] day of the [X] month, a sacred altar shall be established at [X] location to conduct the retreat rites, promulgate talismanic decrees, open pardons for the Nine Dark Realms, and amass vast merit for universal deliverance.
Having already memorialized the Celestial Emperor to request an imperial mandate for implementation, and having petitioned the Heavenly Thearchs for their sagacious decrees, we now notify the true bureaus of the Three Realms and their subordinate offices to trace the souls of the deceased [Named] and others. At the appointed time, they shall personally attend the altar steps, repent their sins, and reverently receive the merit of the retreat. Yet we fear the multitude of recommended souls, bound by karmic retribution, may be detained in hell courts and unable to approach the retreat altar, attend the true rites, or hear the Dharma.
We beseech the promulgation of the Most High’s Imperial Pardon Precious Register for Ascending to Heaven to absolve their transgressions and deliver them from suffering.

Now, in accordance with the imperial mandate, the decree is issued.

All above written in vermilion on yellow paper.
This space reserved for talismanic registers.

**Right Side: The Most High’s Precious Register for Ascending to Heaven is issued to pardon the deceased [Named] and others, as well as the six paths, four births, orphaned souls, stagnant spirits, the underworld’s hell courts, dark prisons, and all imprisoned, suffering sin-laden souls.**
From past kalpas to this day, due to the three karmic actions and six senses, they have committed myriad sins:
- Murdering rulers or fathers, being unfilial to parents.
- Slandering the Great Dao, forsaking truth for falsehood.
- Harming siblings, plotting against masters.
- Conspiring with relatives to commit incest.
- Being bandits, taking lives.
- Slaughtering beings for personal gain.
- Oppressing the weak with strength, abusing the lowly with power.
- Feigning devotion to the Three Treasures while harboring insincerity.
- Disrespecting Dharma masters, defiling sacred texts.
- Harboring malice, cruelty, and jealousy.
- Engaging in slander and gossip to disrupt the virtuous.
- Killing beings for sacrifices, exposing the Three Luminaries.
- Sins of the mind, speech, or self-commissioned, or taught to others—all sins accumulated across kalpas—are hereby swiftly erased from their sin-registers, their evil roots severed.
They shall not be detained; they shall ascend without delay.
Thus, the deceased [Named] and all sin-laden souls: their seven *qi* shall become true, their six rites shall move through emptiness, their five spirits shall reconnect the severed, the two luminaries shall support the weak, they shall turn the Big Dipper and leap through the void, striding upon cloud palaces.
From the beginning of gestation to the endless kalpas, their golden city nurtures their essence, their jade cavern congeals their spirit.
The true *qi* nurtures within, forming the true person.
Above, they enter the Great Void; below, they penetrate the dark springs.
Within the cloud palaces’ jeweled towers, their true souls reside.
They come and go in blessed lands, revolving through the gates of life.
Chewing divine mushrooms, rinsing with golden springs.
Sweet dew flows like rivers, showering their cinnabar fields.
Purple auroras dawn, the three *qi* condense into mist.
Jade chambers transform into immortals, seated upon golden lotuses.
Their true forms eclipse the sun, kalpas become years.
As the decree commands, transmitted by wind and fire couriers.
In the year of the Great Year [X], the month [X], the day [X], the hour [X], the decree is issued.
The officiant of dharma rank, [Named], respectfully receives and executes the command.

**The Supreme Numinous Treasure Yellow Register for Long Life and Deliverance of Destiny**

On this [day] of the [month] in the year of the [Celestial Stem-Branch] [Year], in the district of [Place], [Name], humbly petitions on behalf of their deceased kin [Name], offering the Green Petition’s words to express gratitude for Heaven’s grace. At the Yellow Register Fast Altar, they beseech the transmission of the *Supreme Numinous Treasure Yellow Register for Long Life and Deliverance of Destiny*, to be bestowed upon the soul of [Name], that they may traverse the Three Realms and ascend to the Nine Heavens.

As the scriptures state: Once, the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning, dwelling in the Wondrous Realm of the Nine Purities within the Three Primordial Palaces, expounded the most subtle and profound teachings among the assembly of great sages, enlightening humans and gods. He marked meritorious deeds and inscribed names upon the Yellow Register, recording them upon golden tablets and jade slips, arrayed before the Three Clarities. In every hell, the Celestial Worthies of Salvation from Suffering of the Ten Directions were revealed, entering the Nine Dark Realms to deliver all from torment.

The Celestial Worthy universally addressed the four assemblies: “If you can receive and uphold the Golden Register and White Slips, the Nine Perfected Wondrous Precepts, the Talismans of Long Life, and the True Talismans of Salvation, you shall eradicate the great sins of the Nine Dark Realms and inscribe your names in the Nine Palaces. The Youths Who Examine Destiny and the Guardian Spirits of the Precepts will protect you. The Direct Talismans of the Five Thearchs and the clerks of the Six Palaces shall follow and attend you. The scriptural texts shall shield and guard you, the precept-receiving disciples.”

Now, on your behalf, I shall clearly expound the Nine Perfected Wondrous Precepts and the Golden Register with White Slips, along with the merits of their reception. Their divine power is beyond thought, delivering from suffering and aiding in distress.

The assembled spirits bow their heads and reverently heed the teachings.

The Celestial Worthy proclaimed:
1. Be respectful and yielding, and honorably serve your parents.
2. Be diligent and loyal to your sovereign.
3. Do not kill; compassionately save all beings.
4. Do not commit adultery; rectify your body and conduct.
5. Do not steal; promote righteousness and diminish the self.
6. Do not harbor anger; do not vent fury upon others.
7. Do not deceive; do not slander or harm the virtuous.
8. Do not be arrogant; do not disdain the Perfected.
9. Do not be duplicitous; uphold the precepts with singular devotion.

**True Talisman of Salvation**
By the Talismanic Command of Primordial Beginning, the Golden Register and White Slips, and the True Talisman of Salvation, proclaim to the boundless worlds of the Ten Directions, the Three Palaces and Nine Bureaus, the One Hundred Twenty Offices, the Examiners of the Five Thearchs, the Nine Dark Hells, the Mighty Heavenly Warriors, the Divine Soldiers Who Execute Punishment, the Directors of Destiny, Records, Merit, and Execution, the Ox-Headed Wardens, and the Great Demons of the Three Realms: deliver the soul of [Name], liberate them from hell, forever parting from eternal night to behold the light. Let all sins be eradicated and enmities resolved. By the merit of upholding these Nine Perfected Wondrous Precepts, ascend to rebirth in Heaven. As this edict commands.

Reflecting upon this, this minister, by fortunate karmic affinity, bears the sacred registers. Charged with their propagation, it would be improper to refuse.
Thus, a day shall be chosen to establish the numinous altar, the rites conducted in accordance with the prescribed forms, and the fast solemnly proclaimed.
Humbly beseeching the celestial grace to witness and the sagely power to affirm the covenant, may the disciple [Name] encounter no obstacles, and may the fast’s merit be fully accomplished.
May the deceased ancestors receive deliverance, and may the hidden and manifest realms be blessed with felicity.
This minister, unable to contain his reverent awe and fervent supplication, prostrates himself in utmost devotion. Respectfully memorialized for your attention.

**Memorandum**
**Summons Document**
[For documents with the heading *Mysterious Capital Ministry* in plain script, the same format applies.]

By the duly ordained ritual officer [Surname] [Name], I reverently memorialize the Three Heavens’ Great Sage, the Celestial Great Master of the Dao, the Heavenly Master of the Orthodox Unity, the Quiescent and Responsive Perfected Lord.

It is said: In the midst of the flow of human qi, those who receive transformation rely upon the unchanging; the descent of celestial perfected beings enters the realm of action from non-action.
Thus, the luminous regulations of the Three Registers open the path of life for the Nine Springs.
For all who undertake these rites, it is fitting to set forth their intent in full.

**Memorial Continued**

Now, according to the report of the duly appointed official [Surname] [Name], who seeks to offer prayers for the departed spirit of [Name], and to establish at [Location] an **Unsurpassed Yellow Register Grand Fast**, concluding with the performance of gratitude-requiting pure offerings and [Number] altars of thanksgiving. May the power of the Dao be invoked to universally deliver the suffering in the nether realms.

At this moment, we beseech the command of the myriad heavens and pledge alliance with the Three Realms. Reverently following the primordial model, we establish the sacred altar.

We humbly reflect: our nature is base and our form and spirit defiled. Fearful that we may fail to achieve resonance, we risk blemishing the fast’s merit. Thus, we reverently invite the **Venerable Master** to preside over and witness the ritual proceedings. All written summonses and commands shall bear his august title.

May the ten thousand spirits of the Three Realms reverently heed the call, and the Great Sages of the Ten Directions penetrate all with their wisdom and hearing. We presume upon your exalted clarity, beseeching your gracious assent.

[Name] is utterly overwhelmed with reverence as we await your divine favor.

**Dispatch Document**
The Dharma Master, in accordance with the ritual, paces the **Dingang**, soaring in spirit to silently summon the officers and generals of the various bureaus, as prescribed by the original statutes.

**Ritual Proceedings**
**Purification by Sprinkling**
**Incense Offering**
We reverently make offerings to:
The **Yearly Merit-Officer Messenger** of the [Year] *jiazi* cycle,
The **Monthly Merit-Officer Messenger** of the [Month] *jiazi* cycle,
The **Daily Merit-Officer Messenger** of the [Day] *jiazi* cycle,
The **Hourly Merit-Officer Messenger** of the [Hour] *jiazi* cycle,
The **Direct Talisman Messengers** of the Upper, Middle, and Lower Realms,
The **Dharma Register** administrators, Perfected Immortals, generals, and officers,
The **Jade Maidens** and **Merit-Officers** who memorialize above,
The **Village Deities**, **City Gods**, **Supervising Earth Gods**, and **Local Deities**,
All responsive and efficacious numinous powers.

We submit: the Great Dao is impartial, and only sincerity may move it. The supreme spirits are ever-present, and where there is resonance, communion is achieved.

Herewith we perform the rite of invocation and summons, trusting that our reverent sincerity may be deemed worthy. On this day, we act on behalf of the officiant [Name], who seeks to offer posthumous deliverance to the spirit of [Name], and humbly beseech that the Supreme Yellow Register Grand Fast be established at [Location]. We shall proceed in accordance with the sacred statutes, observing the covenantal rites as prescribed. Without the aid of divine power, no transmission may be effected. We prepare these modest offerings to solemnly welcome the radiance of the gods. Bowing in devotion, we wholeheartedly invoke:

The **Talisman Messengers and Merit-Officers of the Four Directions**, the **Local Earth Gods**—may the primordial unfolding of transformation commence, and the myriad norms be revealed. Let the Three Realms divide their jurisdictions, and the hundred spirits receive their commissions. May the **Perfected Officers, Generals, Talisman Messengers, Merit-Officers, Village Deities, and all Earth Gods** who oversee this land, having received our petition, attend this Dharma assembly. We pray they witness our sincerity and accept our offerings and rites.

**First Offering:**
To the heavens of the Great Brahmā, where the uppermost realms of formlessness shine;
To the palaces of deepest yin, where the nethermost wind-wheel turns.
Mindful of the vast distance between ascent and descent, where no voice or form may reach—
Yet by flight and motion, the divine presence is made manifest.
Across the Three Realms and Ten Splendors, the Eight Obscurities and Nine Ramparts,
We present these prayers and supplications, beseeching swift transmission.
May your majestic numinosity be revealed, and your response made manifest through signs.
Thus shall the Dharma be exalted, and our earnest prayers answered.

**Second Offering:**
Though the offerings of water-plants and ferns be humble,
In the context of purification and fasting, they embody the utmost reverence.
Relying on pure offerings to express the sincerity of our crimson hearts,
We beseech adherence to the primordial statutes, that our commands may be conveyed.
Riding the winds and commanding the *qi*, ascending in inverted radiance to the farthest reaches—
Above, to the heavens beyond thought; below, to the boundaries of the cosmic net.
We entreat the arrival of the true chariots, descending to grace the altar.
Wholly dependent on divine hemp, may the fast be perfected.

**Final Offering:**
As the resonant tones of the cavernous scriptures fall silent and the rites of offering conclude,
We humbly await the presence of your numinous power, praying that our heartfelt words be heard.
Respectfully relying on these written petitions to convey our faithful sincerity,
We present this official document for solemn proclamation.

[Read the covenant document, burn the offerings as prescribed by ritual.]

**Presentation of the Memorial to the Orthodox Unity Patriarchs:**
The Dharma Master [Name] respectfully addresses the **Ancestral Master, the Three Heavens Great Dharma Master, the Orthodox Unity Serene and Responsive Perfected Lord**; the **Orthodox Unity Female Master Perfected Person**; the **Orthodox Unity Successor Master Perfected Person**; and the **Lineage Master Perfected Person**.

We prostrate ourselves, acknowledging that the fast is established in the *Dongxuan* statutes to deliver the dead and succor the living. Through the proclamation of compassion and the aid of transformation, the memorials uphold the solemnity of the Orthodox Unity canons.

The **Twelve Hundred Official Lords** govern, while the **Twenty-Four Administrations** unify the qi. This humble servant, appointed as Inspector, holds the duty of proclamation and transcription. Moreover, as we submit in reverent devotion, propriety forbids refusal. With words of utmost reverence, we choose this day to present and bow before the **Celestial Officials**, offering this memorial chapter to ascend to the **Court and Administration of [Name]**. Relying upon the power of the Dao, we universally deliver those lost in the nether realms.

We reflect with awe that, though unworthy, we bear the sacred talismans and mingle among the ranks of the common. Our spirit yearns to hasten to the **Purple Towers**, there to petition the **Pure Mystery** for decree. Without the grace of your luminous favor, we cannot hope for our plea to be heard. We humbly beseech the issuance of a true edict, summoning the immortals and spirits. May the guardians uphold this memorial, presenting it in accordance with its text. As the sincerity of the fast ascends, we pray it reaches the penetrating perception of the **Cavernous Mirror**; as the celestial blessings descend, may they relieve the suffering of those sunk in the depths.

This humble servant’s heart is filled with nothing but the utmost sincerity in prayer and supplication.

**Presentation of the Memorial for the Three Offerings to the Libation Officials:**
The Dharma Master [Name], burning incense, respectfully addresses the **Perfected Lords of the Three Origins—Tang, Ge, and Zhou**; the **Immortal Bureaucracy of the Memorial Chapters’ Court and Administration**; the **Generals of the Twenty-Four Administrations, who establish standards and oversee merits**; the **Commanders of Merit and Execution, the Courier Court’s Magistrates and Assistants**; the **Inspectors of Merit, Petitioners, Attendants, Courier Clerks, Scribes, and Divine Lads**; the **Official Lords and Officers**; the **Celestial Officials of this Memorial Chapter**; the **Libation Officials of the Registers and Administrations**; the **Perfected Immortal Officials**; the **Officials and Spirits of the Day**; the **Attendant Talisman Clerks**; the **Perfected Officials of the Local Domains**; the **Generals and Officers of the Altars and Earth**; the **Guardians of the Memorial Chapters**; and all **Mighty Spirits**.

We prostrate ourselves, acknowledging that the **Crimson Towers and Pure Capitals** ascend to the utmost bounds of the **Void and Non-Being**, while the **Divine Continent of the Red Regions** below extends to the **Dark and Desolate Realms**.

Though their ascent and descent differ vastly, we trust that sincerity may yet bridge the distance. Today, we humbly offer this rite on behalf of [Name], to aid and uplift the departed soul of [Name]. With reverence, we seize this hour to present our memorial before the Celestial Officials of this Chapter. Invoking your mighty power, we submit this petition to the Administrations. Here we lay forth our modest offerings, approaching in solemn awe before your divine wisdom. May you deign to cast your gaze in mercy and graciously accept our heartfelt prayers.

The Officiant [Name], overwhelmed by awe of your majesty, prostrates in devotion and respectfully invokes your presence.

**Incense Offering** | **Invitation of the Sages** | **First Presentation Rite**
The teachings expound the Dao of Primordial Origin, revealing the method of prostration and memorial submission; the orthodox transmission of the *Zhengyi* preserves the rites for the soul’s flight to the imperial audience. We lift our gaze to the profound wisdom above and bow to present our earnest prayers. Today, the Officiant [Name], bearing the talismanic tokens of the Dao, has established this sacred fast. Having submitted the memorial in advance, we beseech the deliverance of the departed soul. We pray that the Three Primordial Lords Supreme, the Escorting Immortal Officials, the Four Divisions of Memorial Overseers, the Attendant Couriers, the arrayed processional regalia, and the gatekeepers of the celestial vaults may proclaim the edicts and manifest the boundless grace of divine power. The Officiant [Name] is utterly devoted in prayer.

**Incense Offering** | **Second Presentation Rite**
The Crimson Writs govern destiny, the Yellow Registers bestow scripture. They universally protect and deliver both the hidden and the manifest, elevating all ranks of beings. Thus, the method of the *Tongzhang* is established, enabling the full expression of our sincerity. Without the power of the divine, who could manifest such transformation? The petitioners descend, and the summoned arrive, fulfilling our fervent pleas; the delivered cross over, and the seekers attain communion, secretly aligning with our deepest wishes. We humbly implore your benevolent presence to penetrate and witness our innermost hearts. The Officiant [Name] is utterly earnest in prayer.

**Incense Offering** | **Final Presentation Rite**
The rites complete the threefold presentation, the words now fully set forth. The precious memorial ascends to the Three Heavens, the profound grace descends to the Nine Realms. Swiftly dispatch the divine chariot, passing directly through the adamantine winds. Present the documents and transmit the intent. The fast concludes, the rites accomplished as prescribed. May the mighty spirits briefly tarry to await their dismissal.

**Memorial of Gratitude to the Patriarchal Masters**
I, [Name], unworthy as a Libationer, have presumptuously submitted this memorial. Mindful that my impure *qi* has not yet dissipated, I fear my sincerity may fail to reach you. Thus, I implore the true chariots to descend and cast their gaze upon us. Now, following the mysterious statutes, the rites are complete. I dread that my ignorance of the proper ranks may hasten my transgressions. Humbly beseeching your merciful grace, I pray for special pardon. The dusty world is profane and clamorous; may your banners return to the celestial heights. I, along with the Officiant [Name], are utterly devoted in longing.

**Memorial to the Talisman Master**
The Dharma-ranked servant [Name] respectfully addresses the Jade Purity Supreme Lord of Primordial Beginning, the Supreme Lord of Numinous Treasure of Highest Purity, the Supreme Lord of Dao and Virtue of Great Purity, the Supreme Lord of Great Unity of the Eastern Ultimate who Saves from Suffering, the Flying Heavenly Perfected of the Ten Directions, the Five Masters and True Lords of Numinous Treasure, the Three Officials, and all responsive and efficacious mighty spirits of the Three Realms.

I have heard that the statutes of Numinous Treasure tower above all methods, their merit surpassing myriad dharmas. The true talismans absolve sins, their blessings extending to the Nine Netherrealms. Daring to implore the radiant grace of the Supreme Sages, I seek to deliver those in the bitter realms of the Yellow Springs. Today, I humbly perform this rite on behalf of [Name] to uplift the soul of [Name], establishing the supreme Yellow Register Great Fast. Yet I fear that the soul we commend remains bound in the dark bureaus, their sins violating the Azure Statutes, unworthy of deliverance, and thus unable to witness the merit of this fast. Therefore, in accordance with the canonical rites, I proclaim and issue the talismanic commands, universally granting absolution and summoning them to the sacred altar.

Now, I reverently summon the Courier Clerks of the Mysterious Capital’s Reed Dragon Post, the Nine Dragon Talisman Envoys of the Azure Palace, the Document-Bearing Lads of the Earth Prisons, and the Earthly Courier Clerks. Standing respectfully before the Dao, they receive the talismanic commands to announce below the dark prisons and release the departed souls. Humbly beseeching the Supreme Sages to cast their light and all heavens to witness in clarity, may my memorial be granted and the commands permitted to proceed.

May it thus be that the departed soul of so-and-so be bathed in the radiance of wisdom, its bitterness stilled forever, and bid eternal farewell to the long night; may it be anointed by Heaven’s grace and receive deliverance, ascending directly to the Southern Palace. This petitioner awaits your command with the utmost reverence and urgency.

**Petition to Open the Altar**

On the [day], the [day of the sexagenary cycle] of the [month] of the [year] of the [reign title], the Daoist disciple of the Great Way, [Name], of such-and-such rank, residing in [location], together with their household, having purified themselves with fasting and ablutions, bow twice with utmost reverence and humbly address the Most High Three Caverns Master, the Venerable [Name]:

We observe that since the primordial *qi* first divided, all things have been nurtured under its sheltering embrace; since the Dao’s origin first unfolded, its true lineage has manifested through successive generations. Yet only the perfected may fully propagate the Great Teaching. With sincere devotion, we dare to present our plea before your wisdom.

We, the undersigned, petition on behalf of the departed soul of so-and-so, who in life was bound to the true repose and dwelt in the human realm. Long entangled in the delusions of the Six Dusts, their Three Actions remained uncleansed. Fearing the inescapable retribution of the unseen and the accumulated wrongs of mortal transgressions, they have sunk into the abyss of night, forever severed from the light of the sun. Without the subtle and wondrous rites, how may their submerged suffering be alleviated? Thus, we have sought a master of the highest order to establish this sacred altar.

We reverently recall that the Venerable Master, the Perfected One, embodies the Dao in its purest essence, dwelling in profound tranquility. Having awakened to the essence of the Three Caverns and Four Supplements, you serve as the teacher of the Ten Directions and Three Realms. You open the gates of the Mysterious Portal and act as the vessel across the sea of suffering. Heaven and humanity revere your virtue; the hidden and the manifest alike receive your grace.

We humbly beseech you to extend your boundless compassion and heed our earnest prayers. May your spirit soar, guiding the reins across the Three Realms of the unseen; may you bestow talismanic commands to uplift the souls from the Nine Springs. As auspicious clouds descend, may the breath of life be inexhaustible; as the divine wind gathers, may the bones of the dead emit fragrant smoke. May this soul, once subject to judgment, attain the fruit of ascending to the true. Further, may the lingering consciousness of the Nine Ancestors and the hidden spirits of the Six Paths all ascend to the realm of liberation, together reaching the shore of the Inaudible and Invisible.

Our devotion is most earnest, our words inadequate to express it. We dare to intrude upon your august presence with this plea. This petitioner’s heart is filled with fervent supplication beyond measure.

**Response to the Petition to Open the Altar**

When the officiant concludes the deliverance prayer, the supervisor of the fast addresses the master:

"The Great Yellow Register Fast is a secret rite of the Purple Clarity. Its merit surpasses all dharmas, its grace extends to the Nine Netherworlds. We humbly implore the master’s compassion to ascend the altar and perform the ritual."

The master responds:
"The precious fast is of profound subtlety, its mysteries deeply hidden. Without mastery of its majestic forms, how may its canonical rites be proclaimed? My talents are unworthy; to accept this request is beyond my capacity."

The supervisor of the fast again addresses the master:
"The Jade Emperor’s transformation descends; the Three Caverns’ teachings are proclaimed. The Yellow Register’s rites are perfected, and the Nine Netherworlds are opened to peace. This is not merely the heartfelt plea of one, but the yearning gaze of all four assemblies. We beseech you to embody Heaven’s grace, to heed the desires of humanity. Should the departed souls attain deliverance, it will truly be the master’s boundless compassion."

The master responds:
"To deliver the dead and save the living relies entirely on the wondrous rites. To act on Heaven’s behalf requires the perfected. I am but a humble and unworthy vessel; how dare I accept such a great request?"

The supervisor of the fast again addresses the master:
"The departed spirits have gathered at the sacred altar. Banners of color and tassels of splendor attend the ritual seat. We humbly beseech you to proclaim the teachings and broadly deliver the submerged. This is not only the compassion of the Great Dao, but also the fortunate convergence of all the deluded."

The officiant and all present bow with utmost reverence.

The master responds:
"The true heart is easily obscured; the supreme Dao is difficult to know. With bodies stained by the Six Dusts, dwelling in the floating vanity of the Five Turbidities, karmic retribution binds the spirit, causing it to sink and drown. Without the gate of my dharma, there is no means of deliverance. Though I have been honored with this great request, how dare I neglect its execution? The canons have their eternal principles; I shall now proclaim them."

The officiant and all present prepare to bow in gratitude, but the master raises a hand to stop them. The master of ceremonies escorts the master to the seat, and the invocation of incense begins.

**Invocation of the Covenant**

The High Priest ascends the seat; the ritual assembly stands in order. The ritual proceedings commence. After the supervisor of the fast kneels and reads the disciple’s petition, the High Priest holds the incense and intones:

"Within the Land of Floating Radiance, upon the Jade Capital Mountain, for myriad years the *qi* has congealed into mist, and countless multitudes have communicated their sincerity and faith. Roots entwine the towering trees below; leaves fill the sandalwood groves. A single stick of precious incense burns in the censer, and the Three Realms and Ten Directions all bow in reverence."

Having spoken, the incense is placed in the censer.

The incense is offered to the Three Clarities and Three Realms, the Ten Poles and Ten Flowers, the Most High Perfected, the Dao, the Scriptures, the Masters, the Treasure, the Ten Directions and Three Realms, the Thousand Perfected and Myriad Spirits, the Great Yellow Register Fast, and the True Sovereign of Responses.

We humbly pray that you ride dragons and phoenixes, soaring through the void. Descend upon this ritual arena and witness the merit of this covenant.

The master takes the seat, and the invocation of the subtle and wondrous covenant begins:

Before the One True was yet manifest, the mechanisms of auspiciousness were already unified, for the Three *Qi* had first divided. The ultimate source of the serene and formless, the vast and spontaneous transformation, born at the inception of the Image Emperor, hidden within the empty and cavernous. The Primordial Beginning unfolded the chart, spreading the Five Scripts across the azure heavens; the Cavernous Mystery revealed its secrets, revolving the Ten Transformations within the original canon. The principle of ceaseless generation is inexhaustible; the origin of endless transformation is unfathomable. It set in motion the unfolding of the Two Modes, enabling the myriad beings to be transformed and completed. Its virtue is rooted in the love of life, standing alone as the Way of eternal life; its power lies in non-interference—who knows the essence of the True Sovereign? It is neither the ordinary Dao nor the ordinary name; it does not flee from humanity nor from things.

From the beginning of the Three Sovereigns, the Dao was complete within humanity. By the end of the Five Emperors, humanity had drifted far from the Dao. Private deceit prevailed, and Heaven’s principles faded; illusory realms deluded, and the awakened nature dimmed. Unable to preserve life and cherish the spirit, they turned ever further from the true and embraced the false. Thus, life arises from this, and death arises from this; emerging from the mechanism and returning to the mechanism. The true mind is drowned in joy, anger, greed, and wrath; the eternal truth is discarded like dreams, illusions, bubbles, and shadows. They bring death upon themselves, severed from their root. Assailed by both human transgressions and ghostly retributions, the blades of frost and snow converge upon them."

Amidst the raging flames of scorching hells, beside the towering peaks of icy pools, all arise from a single perverse thought, self-inflicting the torments of the Nine Dark Realms. Their cries of sorrow echo in vain, for they know only too late the errors of past lives; though the Savior manifests in myriad forms, they have not yet encountered the boundless grace that might reach them. The ceaseless currents of countless sins surge like unrelenting winds—only the Most High can lift them by the nape, delivering all without limit.

Expounding the vast scriptures of the Yellow Register, flourishing the sacred canons of the Covenant of Perfection, harnessing the chariot of nine phoenixes and eight simurghs to seek and save the ten directions, proclaiming the talismans of nine dragons and two tigers to open the path for the six destinies. Transforming the fires of torment into the sweet dew of cloud-milk, dispelling the shadows of flame with the radiant light of the Numinous Treasure. The blades of sword-trees shatter, the waves of cauldrons still. When the universal summons concludes, the fair ones of Li Hua attain deliverance; when one soul stands fearless, the Northern Emperor petitions in reverence. This is the supreme cause, a fruit beyond all measure.

For the Primordial Sovereign spread transformation, and the successive sages disseminated its flow. The scriptures divide into thirty-six sections, yet none surpasses the *Duren* in liberating beings; the fasts array in twenty-seven ranks, yet the Yellow Register stands foremost. Lord Ge Xuan transmitted the essence of the *Great Cavern*, while Zhang Jing responded with the *Rectified Unity* texts. The wellsprings of immortality flow boundlessly, and the lineage of truth transmits endlessly. Not only are its merits vast and universal, but its precepts command solemn awe. Without single-minded sincerity and utmost purity, how could one glimpse or hear of its great model?

Now, the officiant of the Yellow Register Grand Fast, so-and-so, pledges devotion to the Ten Poles and petitions the Three Heavens. Honoring ancestors with filial reverence, they seek to deliver countless generations; cultivating goodness and establishing merit, they universally succor all beings. With utmost sincerity and pledged faith, they gather a host of the pure and serene to solemnly convene the Covenant of Perfection. It is fitting that an exalted adept be chosen to proclaim and enact these rites.

As for myself—a mere drifter in the Dharma-sea, a humble student of the Mystery Gate—I have presumptuously taken my place among the robed, undeservingly inheriting the transmission of my masters. My body has not yet penetrated the true, how could it attain the wondrous union of form and spirit? My virtue is meager and shallow, how could it harmonize heaven and earth as one? I ought to cast off limbs and dull the senses, dwelling in mountains and marshes. How then has the dust of the world soiled me, burdening me with these ornate words? Yet, reflecting on the lingering embers of imperial favor, I recognize the depth of my devotion. Fortunate indeed that karmic conditions align, and worthy assistants are found. Together, we pledge our oaths, striving to perfect the fast’s affairs.

Moreover, the regulations are fully set forth, merits and transgressions clearly distinguished. The records of the Three Officials and Five Emperors, the registers of the Nine Bureaus and Four Offices—every minute detail is accounted for, not a speck overlooked. Let no negligence or carelessness arise, lest the blessings of cultivation be lost. We must swear before heaven and earth, pledge before gods and spirits, each pouring forth a sincere heart, harboring no stray thoughts. Then shall our merits be inscribed on azure tablets, elevating seven generations to ascend to heaven; let no sins be bound in black writ, lest nine lineages fall to earth.

At the moment of ascending the altar, at the outset of receiving office, all shall uphold the sworn words and together propagate the great teaching. Now, as the fast’s solemnity is established and the covenant’s proclamations complete, the jade pendants chime in harmony, resounding to the ten directions; the majestic rites stand in full array, observed by the myriad sages above. With unified sincerity, we raise the sublime affair, establishing the pure assembly—may all hold this in reverence.

**Invitation to the Supervising Officials and Spirits**

We now burn incense and reverently invite:
The administrators of the Registers of Destiny, the numinous officials and immortal clerks;
The various bureaus and courts of the Dharma;
The officials, generals, and soldiers of the void and the responsive numinous offices;
The direct messengers, merit-recording functionaries, incense officials, and mounted couriers;
The City God of this prefecture, the guardian deities of this fast’s altar, and the local earth gods;
All deities and spirits.

As heaven and earth unfold, the myriad spirits receive their offices. The sagely and true descend to oversee, the hundred gods hasten to their posts. We welcome the whirlwind chariots, aligning with the fast’s covenant and laws. Now, as the rites are to be performed, we duly report this to you.

On behalf of the officiant so-and-so, we pursue the deliverance of the spirit of so-and-so, and now commence the Supreme Yellow Register Grand Fast. We shall open the numinous altar and reverently proclaim the precious model. We humbly invite all to join in the covenant’s oaths and together establish the fast’s merit. Sweep away defilements and dispel miasmas, reverently welcoming the true chariots. Convey our sincere words, awaiting the descent of numinous radiance. Let all maintain solemnity in their majestic rites, guiding and receiving the auspicious blessings. Adhere strictly to the altar’s prohibitions, disturbing not the fast’s covenant. In accordance with the jade statutes of the Mystery Code, act swiftly and without delay.

**Proclamation of the Oath**

**Invocation to the Mystic Master**

From the Dharma-rank so-and-so, we reverently address the Three Heavens’ Transformative Lord, the Great Master of the Mystic Center, Perfected Lord.

Your office presides over the Three Realms, and we look up to the exalted name of the Precious Master; your teachings expound the profound mystery, relying on your compassionate light to reach all beings. The forty-two altar rites of libation, the seventy-two ranks of fasts—all serve the multitudes, universally relieving all suffering. For all who undertake cultivation, we duly present this.

We now act on behalf of so-and-so, pursuing the deliverance of the spirit of so-and-so, and commence the Supreme Yellow Register Grand Fast. We shall follow the Mystery Code, enacting the fast’s laws. Humbly beseeching your boundless grace, we universally succor the living and the dead. Reverently praying for your auspicious light to descend upon the altar’s deliverance. Dispel all demonic afflictions, bestow the true *qi* upon the numinous gate; witness this fast’s sincerity, rescue the sunken souls from the dark night. May blessings overflow for families and nations, and grace extend to the living and the departed.

We, with utmost devotion and earnest supplication, bow our heads in reverence and undertake this fast in prayer.

**Invocation to the Five Emperors**

From the Dharma-rank so-and-so, we reverently address:
The Azure Emperor of the Nine *Qi* of the East, Lord of the Verdant Dawn, Elder of the Azure Spirit, residing in the Jeweled Forest of Peace;
The Vermilion Emperor of the Three *Qi* of the South, Lord of the Flourishing Yang, True Elder of the Cinnabar Spirit, residing in the Jewel of Brahma’s Prosperity;
The White Emperor of the Seven *Qi* of the West, August Elder of the Radiant Spirit, residing in the Seven Jeweled Golden Gate;
The Black Emperor of the Five *Qi* of the North, Mystic Elder of the Five Numinous Ones, residing in the Solitary Darkness of the Northern Wilderness;
The Yellow Emperor of the One *Qi* of the Center, Primordial Elder of the Original Spirit, residing in the Jeweled Mystery of the Jade Treasure.

We have heard that when the Primordial Beginning unfolded the chart, the true scriptures manifested in the world; when the Three Origins established their positions, the Five Emperors governed the directions. They wield the mechanisms of yin and yang’s life and death, and preside over the records of heaven’s merits and transgressions.

In all matters of reverent offering, a formal memorial must be presented.

Your servant now, on behalf of [Name], seeks to deliver the spirit of [Name] through the recitation of the Supreme Yellow Register Grand Retreat. Following the mysterious statutes, we shall enact the rites of the retreat. Humbly beseeching the outpouring of grace, may it universally succor the hidden and the manifest. Reverently invoking the descent of auspicious radiance upon this altar. May the whirling wheels descend to the earth below, as in the assembly of Floating Black; may the souls sunk in the dark of night be pitied, that they may shelter beneath the Dao’s shade. May all within the household and the realm alike be encompassed by this blessed repose.

Your servants, with utmost sincerity and earnest supplication, bow in reverence and devotion, offering this retreat in solemn invocation.

**Memorial to the Heavenly Master**
Your servant, holding the dharma rank and surname [Name], respectfully invokes the Most High Heavenly Master, Lord of the Three Heavens, Great Dharma Lord of the Capital Heaven, Orthodox Unity, Serene and Responsive Perfected Sovereign.

We reflect that the Dao of Heaven is nameless, yet through scripture the teachings are established. The utmost numinous nurtures all things, yet only the sagely can bring them to fruition. There must be master and disciple to serve as models. In proceeding with this reverent offering, we dare not delay our submission.

Your servant now, on behalf of [Name], seeks to deliver the spirit of [Name] through the recitation of the Supreme Yellow Register Grand Retreat. Following the mysterious statutes, we shall enact the rites of the retreat. Humbly beseeching the outpouring of grace, may it universally succor the hidden and the manifest. Reverently invoking the descent of auspicious radiance upon this altar. May the sufferings of sentient beings in the cycle of birth and death be transcended, all bathed in the merit of this retreat; may the transgressions of eons across the cosmos be washed clean, inaugurating a new era of primordial transformation. May all beings forever enjoy the blessings of Heaven.

Your servant, with utmost sincerity and earnest supplication, bows in reverence and devotion, offering this retreat in solemn invocation.

**Memorial to the Three Masters**
Your servant, holding the dharma rank and surname [Name], respectfully invokes the Perfected Sovereign of the *Lingbao* Scripture Master, the Perfected Sovereign of the *Lingbao* Register Master, and the Perfected Sovereign of the *Lingbao* Deliverance Master.

We reflect that through the conjoining of *qi* the scriptures were formed, perfecting the wonders of the Double Mystery; the teachings were established before Heaven, uniquely exalting the name of high antiquity. There must be true masters to oversee these sacred canons. In proceeding with this reverent offering, we dare not delay our submission.

Your servant now, on behalf of [Name], seeks to deliver the spirit of [Name] through the recitation of the Supreme Yellow Register Grand Retreat. Following the mysterious statutes, we shall enact the rites of the retreat. Humbly beseeching the outpouring of grace, may it universally succor the hidden and the manifest. Reverently invoking the descent of auspicious radiance upon this altar. May the wondrous fruit be perfected, delivering those sunk in delusion. In the Nine Nights of the Yellow Springs, may they be aided by divine power to cross over; through the Three Paths and Six Realms, may they be illuminated by the radiance of wisdom. May the realm be preserved in peace and tranquility, and the people ascend to benevolence and longevity.

Your servant, with utmost sincerity and earnest supplication, bows in reverence and devotion, offering this retreat in solemn invocation.

**Memorial to the Three Officials**
Your servant, holding the dharma rank and surname [Name], respectfully invokes the Supreme August Emperor of Purple Tenuity, First-Rank Bestower of Blessings, Heavenly Official of the Upper Prime; the August Emperor of Pure Emptiness, Second-Rank Remitter of Sins, Earthly Official of the Middle Prime; and the August Emperor of Solitary Darkness, Third-Rank Reliever of Distress, Water Official of the Lower Prime.

We reflect that the primordial *qi* of the Mysterious Origin first divided yin and yang; the officials of water and fire, in their paired oversight, administer transgressions and blessings. They determine life and death in the Nine Treasuries and govern the registers of the Three Primes. In initiating this retreat, we dare not neglect our entreaty.

**Opening the Retreat Altar**

Your servant, the duly ordained minister [Name], now kindles incense and reverently addresses the Supreme Boundless Dao, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Origin; the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao; the Supreme Lord Lao; the Most High Mysterious Elder; the Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions Who Hear Cries and Deliver from Suffering; the Great Sage Assemblies Who Have Attained the Dao; the Perfected Lords and Venerable Masters; the Thirty-Six Heavenly Emperor Lords; the Jade Purity Highest Emperor; the Jade Emperor the Great Emperor; the Eastern Flower and Southern Culmen, the Western Numinous and Northern Perfected, the Mysterious Capital and Jade Capital, the Golden Watchtower of the Seven Treasures, the Purple Tenuity Upper Palace’s Numinous Treasure Perfected Radiant August Lord of the Dao; the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures; the Heavenly Master Lord of the Great Dharma within the Mysterious; the Upper Ministers and Upper Chancellors, the Upper Protectors and Upper Tutors; the Four Offices and Five Emperors; the Preceptors of the Scriptures and Registers; the Three Yuan Emperor Lords; the Perfected Lord Great Dharma Master Who Oversees the Numinous Treasure Retreat; the officials and attendants of the Three Realms; and all true numina.

I have heard that when the Vermilion Writs govern the course of destiny, they open the gates of the retreat for thanksgiving; when the Yellow Registers deliver the living, they inscribe the ranks of the numinous immortals.

In all matters of cultivation and reverence, a formal memorial must be presented. I, on behalf of [Title] of [Location], now petition to dedicate the merits of [Deity/Spirit] and humbly request that an Unsurpassed Yellow Register Grand Retreat be solemnly established at [Location], lasting three days and three nights.

Reverently following the mystic model, I prepare the Yellow Altar and invoke its inception.

May the Supreme Saints turn their radiance toward us, and may the host of Perfected Ones oversee the deliverance. May they deign to descend and bestow their witness, jointly granting confirmation of the covenant. I, unworthy, gaze heavenward in awe and longing, prostrate in reverence, and now present this altar memorial with utmost sincerity.

**Three-Day Grand Retreat: Six Sessions of Invocation and Sutra-Chanting**
The methods of visualization, sutra-recitation, and circumambulation are fully set forth in the *Ritual for Ascending the Altar and Circumambulating with the Sutra*. Only the opening and closing invocations are adjusted according to the occasion.

**First Day – Morning Invocation for Sutra-Chanting (Traditional Text)**
The Jade Writs of the Purple Palace bestow blessings upon the ten directions and all beings; the Jade Tablets of the Mystic Capital subdue the hundred demons to deliver the multitudes. Above, they enable ascent to the heavens and descent to observe the world; below, they refine the souls of the dead. Their boundless merits defy full praise.

Today, on behalf of [Title] [Name], dedicating the merits for [Deity/Spirit], we have established the Unsurpassed Yellow Register Grand Retreat. The assembled pure assembly has reverently recited *The Wondrous Upper Chapter of the Numinous Treasure’s Limitless Salvation of All* once through, completing the full cycle. By this merit, we dedicate and offer to the Most High Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Jade Capital and Golden Portals of the Seven Treasures in the Purple Tenuity Palace of the Great Luo Heaven; the August Lord of the Void and Supreme Dao; the Most High Lord Lao; the multitude of honored ones of the Dao and its Power; the sacred scriptures of the Three Caverns, the jade texts and mystic characters; the host of sages of the ten directions; the masters of past kalpas; the Perfected Ones who uphold the teachings; the Dharma Lords of the Mystic; and all the Perfected Ones gathered at this retreat altar.

By this sublime cause, we first adorn and dignify the deities of all heavens and earths, the sun, moon, and stars, the sacred mountains and rivers, the lords of wind and clouds, the ancestral spirits and former sages, emperors and empresses, crown princes and kings, civil and military officials, all peoples of Hua and Yi, and the multitudes of beings. May the Two Modes endure forever, and the Three Luminaries shine brightly. May the six qi harmonize and cold and heat balance, the eight seasons align and rain and sunshine be timely. May the jade charts be steadfast, the precious mandate prolonged. May the realm be illuminated, wars cease. May the nine provinces share a common path, the four seas unite in culture.

May the departed soul of [Name], once inscribed in the Black Register, have their name expunged and be ranked in the Crimson Palace. May their true heart remain undimmed, their awakened nature perfectly luminous. May the retreat’s sponsor, [Name], have their misfortunes averted and calamities extinguished. May their household thrive in peace, all ascending to the land of benevolence and longevity. May their seven ancestors ascend and directly attain the realm of carefree wandering. May all beings receive blessings, the darkness of the netherworld be illuminated. With bowed heads, we take refuge and reverently offer praise.

The above invocation is already recorded in the *Ritual for Ascending the Altar and Circumambulating with the Sutra*. This text is now composed anew only because the *Ritual for Circumambulation* in one fascicle was compiled by Master Du Guangcheng, and to avoid altering the ancient rites. Yet, lest modern practitioners grow overly familiar, this version is provided as an alternative.

**First Day – Evening Invocation for Sutra-Chanting**
The primordial scriptures of the Primordial Beginning planted the numinous and opened the Three Luminaries; the hidden verses of the myriad heavens dispelled poison and harm to deliver the countless multitudes. Those who awaken to them attain the Dao and become Perfected; those who hear them dissolve disasters and erase sins. Vast and boundless, the Great Brahma defies description.

Today, on behalf of [Name], dedicating the merits for [Deity/Spirit], we have established the Unsurpassed Yellow Register Grand Retreat. The assembled pure assembly has reverently recited *The Wondrous Upper Chapter of the Numinous Treasure’s Limitless Salvation of All*, aspiring to rely on the true vehicle to eliminate karmic filth. May the field of blessings grow, securing peace for body and kin; may the grace of wisdom suffuse all, bringing prosperity to both the living and the departed.

The grace extends equally to state and family, the blessings reach both the living and the departed.

*Second day, morning scripture opening*

In the Crimson Clarity, the True Writ manifested in the world. Gathering the hidden verses of the myriad heavens, it formed the numinous chapters of the Eight Assemblies. It delivers the deluded multitudes and elevates the myriad beings.

*Chanting the scripture*

The scriptures of the Utmost Real are the most exalted field of blessings. All who take refuge therein receive protection and fruition according to their vows.

*Evening scripture opening*

The Great Dao is nameless, primordial qi subtly pervaded the beginning of the great void; the Utmost Real manifested symbols, the numinous writ opened the dawn of existence. All prayers are answered, none are left unsaved by its words.

Today, on behalf of the official [Name], dedicating the merits universally for the deceased kin [Name] and the assembled souls, we have established the Unsurpassed Yellow Register Grand Retreat.

**On the Third Morning: Opening the Sutra**
The Great Dao divides its radiance, first expounding the teaching of wordless silence;
The Heavenly Worthy spreads transformation, gradually bestowing texts of wondrous creation.
Condensing qi into scripture, congealing clouds into celestial seals,
It encompasses the myriad dharmas, universally delivering all beings.

Today, we humbly act on behalf of [Name], universally dedicating this to the deceased kin [Name], and all assembled souls, as we reverently perform the Supreme Yellow Register Grand Retreat. We now gather the pure assembly before us to recite the *Most Exalted Wondrous Sutra of the Numinous Treasure of the Cavernous Mystery: The Upper Chapter on the Limitless Salvation of Humankind*.

May we rely on the true vehicle to dissolve karmic filth, the Dharma’s power to ferry them across, together severing the bonds of worldly defilement;
May sacred wisdom attain perfect penetration, equally attaining the fruit of true enlightenment.

May the departed souls receive deliverance, and all under heaven be blessed with grace.

**Hymn of the Sutra**
The Primordial Numinous Scripture, the Upper Chapter for Salvation:
It dispels the Three Calamities, delivers from the Nine Perils.
It orders the Five Qi, harmonizes the hundred spirits.
Treasured in the heavens above, not transmitted to the world below—
This is called the profound mystery, difficult to fathom in full.

Today, we reverently act on behalf of the official [Name], universally dedicating this to the deceased kin [Name], and all assembled souls, as we reverently perform the Supreme Yellow Register Grand Retreat. We have respectfully gathered the pure assembly before us to recite the *Most Exalted Wondrous Sutra of the Numinous Treasure of the Cavernous Mystery: The Upper Chapter on the Limitless Salvation of Humankind*, each recitation now complete.

With these meritorious deeds, we dedicate them to the Southern Pole Star Lord of Longevity, the Sun and Moon, the Nine Luminaries, the Great Unity and Ten Spirits, the Southern Asterism and Northern Dipper, the Twenty-Eight Constellations, the Twelve Palaces, the patron’s natal stars, their original destiny, the true officials and divine generals, the fortunes of their life and fate, the governing and attending stars, the darkly shining baleful stars, the Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams, the yin-yang stems and branches, the Year Star, and all deities and baleful spirits.

With these excellent causes, we first use them to repent and purify the retreat sponsor [Name]’s household.
From past kalpas to the present life,
They have clung to deluded attachments, thereby incurring obstacles and hardships.
The six senses and three karmas, the five desires and ten entanglements,
Ancient enmities and grave transgressions, yang offenses and yin faults—
We pray they all be absolved and wholly eradicated.

May boundless grace descend, the light of heaven shine below.
May they forever escape the sufferings of water, fire, and wind disasters, never encountering the demons of mountain and marsh.
May their kin enjoy peace, the departed souls attain liberation.
May the nation receive blessings, all beings be graced with favor.

**In the Evening: Opening the Sutra**
The Primordial One unfurled the chart, the true sutras established the teaching.
Above, to harmonize heaven and pacify earth; below, to protect the nation and secure the household.
Universally delivering the boundless—thus is it called "Limitless."

Today, we reverently act on behalf of the official [Name], universally dedicating this to the deceased kin [Name], and all assembled souls, as we reverently perform the Supreme Yellow Register Grand Retreat. We have respectfully gathered the pure assembly before us to recite the *Most Exalted Wondrous Sutra of the Numinous Treasure of the Cavernous Mystery: The Upper Chapter on the Limitless Salvation of Humankind*.

May we rely on true merit to universally bestow vast blessings.
The illusory and false six dusts—may the roots of the six desires all be eradicated;
The flowing current of the Three Caverns—may the fruits of the three expedients all be realized.
May the world be tranquil, the nether realms at peace.
Above, reaching the myriad heavens; below, extending through the nine abysses.
May all universally receive this grace, equally attaining the state of non-action.

**Hymn of the Sutra**
The Upper Chapter’s wondrous sutra, the celestial realms’ supreme chant:
It gathers the flying qi of the Three Caverns, forming the cloud-seal scriptures of the Eight Assemblies.
Hidden in the Jade Capital of the Mystic Metropolis, the Supreme Purple Tenuity Palace,
Bestowed with the celestial hymns of the Azure Vault, the Great Floating Black Soil.
For a trillion kalpas and five translations, transmitted once in forty thousand kalpas—
The bridge for all beings, the gateway for all immortals.
No being it fails to deliver, every prayer it fulfills.
Such sacred merit cannot be exhausted by human effort.

Today, we reverently act on behalf of [Name], universally dedicating this to the deceased kin [Name], and all assembled souls, as we reverently perform the Supreme Yellow Register Grand Retreat. We have respectfully gathered the pure assembly before us to recite the *Most Exalted Wondrous Sutra of the Numinous Treasure of the Cavernous Mystery: The Upper Chapter on the Limitless Salvation of Humankind*, each recitation now complete.

With these meritorious deeds, we dedicate them to the Three Caverns and Four Auxiliaries, the attendant scriptural immortals, the officials of the Numinous Treasure, the supervising immortals of the retreat, the various lords and generals, the inspectors of empty space, the direct messengers and functionaries, the divine youths and jade maidens, the administrators of the Dharma registers, the divine officials and generals, the Four Controllers and Five Emperors, the responsive and efficacious numinous spirits, the guardians of the retreat altar, and all deities.

With these excellent causes, we dedicate them to the retreat’s patron [Name] and all participants, to nurture the sprouts of goodness and usher in auspicious blessings.
May grace extend to both the living and the dead, bestowing blessings upon the nation and household.

We humbly pray:
May their awakened nature attain perfect clarity, their true mind abide in empty stillness.
Accumulated transgressions from past lives—may they be eradicated by the power of wisdom;
Unmanifested disasters and misfortunes—may they be dissolved by these excellent causes.
May their years be lengthened, their lifespan extended, their life preserved and rooted.
May auspicious omens gather at their gates, felicitous blessings bless their kin.
Above, may the stars follow their proper courses, wind and rain arrive in due season.
May the phoenix calendar endure, the dragon regalia be secured.
May weapons and pestilence not afflict the people; may floods, fires, droughts, and locusts not invade their lands.
May the dark paths cease their accusations, the night prisons open their light.
May all beings receive grace, all life be blessed with fortune.
May they equally attain the fruit of true enlightenment, together ascend the realm of bliss.

**Text for Inviting the Spirits to the Altar**
After the departed souls have bathed, the reciter of hidden verses leads the banner-bearer to the altar’s base, facing south and standing northward to intone:

"Through karmic entanglements, they drift; their awakened nature obscured.
Once fallen into the dark paths, they cannot transcend the realm of the living.
Now, by the power of the Dao, they arrive at the numinous altar.
They should purify themselves, rectify their bodies, and incline their hearts.
Silently recite the refuge, bow to the Three Treasures in gratitude."

All the immortals reverently approach before the Dao, humbly receiving deliverance.

**Hymn:**
The deceased [Name], with sincere heart, bows to the Most High Limitless Great Dao.

**Hymn:**
The deceased [Name], with sincere heart, bows to the Most Exalted Perfectly True Thirty-Six Divisions of the Sacred Scriptures.

**Hymn:**
The deceased [Name], with sincere heart, bows to the Three Supreme Honored Ones and the Ten Directions’ Host of Sages, the Great Dharma Masters of the Mystic Realm.

This done, the banner-bearer returns to position.

**First Day’s Offering of the Purification Feast:**
The honor due the boundless is beyond all measure;
The utmost reverence of our offered sincerity is wordless.
We humbly present this precious feast,
Solemnly arraying its fine viands.
We emulate the otter’s and jackal’s gratitude,
And aspire to the offerings of water-plants and ferns.
Daring to offend your luminous majesty,
We are deeply remiss and transgress.
We prostrate ourselves, awaiting punishment.

---

**Second Day’s Offering of the Purification Feast:**
Reverently upholding the mystic model,
We humbly open the Yellow Altar.
Invoking the command of the Venerable Masters,
We pray for the radiance of your grace to descend;
Offering sincerity with water-plants and pondweed,
We hope for the divine response to draw near.
Looking up, we rely on your supreme benevolence;
Looking down, we implore your compassion for our humble offerings.
We prostrate ourselves, awaiting punishment.

---

**Third Day’s Offering of the Purification Feast:**
The Nine Dragons suspend their imperial presence,
Their resplendent light shining brilliantly;
The Three Qi congeal in majesty,
Their awe-inspiring countenance looming near.
We have prepared pure and fragrant offerings,
Humbly striving to express our devotion.
Our rites have profaned the divine,
And we willingly accept the axe’s punishment.
We prostrate ourselves, awaiting punishment.

---

**Invitation to the Deceased to Receive Deliverance:**
After the nine audiences are completed, on the night of the deliverance of the soul,
The feast officers and family members proceed before the numinous altar,
Offer incense, and take leave of the deceased.

The Dharma Master for the Invitation of the Deceased intones:
The paths of life and death diverge; the living never forget the dead.
The destinies of immortals and mortals differ; the Dao of immortals can transcend the mundane.
This soul has traversed worldly entanglements,
Deeply dwelling on the true path.
Yet, lost in the distant dark,
It has not yet attained rebirth in the night.
Now, we establish the Yellow Register,
Proclaiming the Purple Model.
We have eradicated karmic burdens,
And released the roots of suffering.
It is fitting to compose oneself, quiet the heart,
Reflect on the true, and contemplate the Dao.
Reverently receive the refining and deliverance,
Humbly await ascension.
Behold the precious flower of the Three Qi,
Listen to the wondrous precepts of the Nine Perfected.
Receive the transmission of the white writ,
And ascend to the Vermilion Palace.
The assembly, with utmost sincerity,
Chants the hidden verses to welcome and guide.

---

**Farewell Prayer for the Departed:**
The Dao is but a forced name; the four elements are but a temporary union.
The body is not one’s own; which of the six relations can truly be called kin?
Moreover, the dream realm is illusory,
And the kalpa’s dust is defiled.
It cannot bear attachment or delight,
But should be swiftly abandoned.
Now, the purification feast is concluded,
And the audience with the Perfected is imminent.
With fluttering feathered sleeves,
Step swiftly upon the cloud thoroughfares.
Refine the soul in the Heaven of the Three Qi,
Bow in reverence to the realm of the Ten Flowers.
Ever heed the true Dharma,
And eternally attend the Compassionate Honored One.
Deeply comprehend true emptiness,
Without lingering attachments.
Go well.
Go well.

**Farewell Prayer to the Five Emperors:**
In full ritual rank and surname, so-and-so humbly invokes:
The Azure Emperor of the Nine Qi, Heavenly Lord of the East, Lord of the Origin and Elder of the Azure Spirit in the Jeweled Forest of Peace;
The Vermilion Emperor of the Three Qi, Heavenly Lord of the South, True Elder of the Vermilion Spirit in the Flourishing Yang of the Brahma Treasure;
The White Emperor of the Seven Qi, Heavenly Lord of the West, August Elder of the White Spirit at the Golden Gate of the Seven Treasures;
The Black Emperor of the Five Qi, Heavenly Lord of the North, Mysterious Elder of the Five Spirits in the Dark Solitude of the Northern Wilderness;
The Yellow Emperor of the One Qi, Heavenly Lord of the Center, Primeval Elder of the Primordial Spirit in the Jade Treasure.

When the Great Beginning first divided, the Five Elders became the progenitors of creation; their profound efficacy unfathomable, they oversee the Three Heavens and the offices of judgment. The precious purification feast now concluded, the celestial steps are no longer traceable. Though we perform the rites of offering and reverence, we cannot escape the transgressions of corpse defilement and contamination. For our missteps in ritual deportment and our lapses in audience protocol, we acknowledge all as faults and humbly beg for your compassion and absolution. May the living and the dead alike receive your blessings, and may your grace extend universally to households and kingdoms. The jade altar is now cleared, and your jade chariots ascend. The nine phoenixes sing, the eight simurghs cry, the myriad perfected gather, and all heavens rejoice. Our gaze is fixed in longing, yet we cannot follow. We are overwhelmed by the radiance of your grace.

With reverence, we bow twice and take our leave.

---

**Farewell Prayer to the Three Masters:**
In full ritual rank and surname, so-and-so humbly invokes:
The Perfected Lord of the Scripture Master of the Numinous Treasure,
The Perfected Lord of the Register Master of the Numinous Treasure,
The Perfected Lord of the Salvation Master of the Numinous Treasure.

The vermilion memorial has reported our merits to the Ten Poles; the golden dragon soars in splendor, bearing our offerings to the Three Primes. By the luminous protection of the venerated masters, the purification feast has reached its perfect fruition. The unseen and the manifest are opened to prosperity, a joy beyond words. We have been favored by your divine presence and graced by your radiant majesty. Having attended your cloud-palace, you now return to your bejeweled chariots. As your immortal retinue ascends, we gaze afar toward the crimson heavens. We beseech your boundless compassion to bestow your vast grace universally.

Overwhelmed by longing and devotion, we bow twice with reverence and take our leave.

---

**Farewell Prayer to the Inspector of the Purification Feast:**
In full ritual rank and surname, so-and-so humbly invokes:
The Perfected Lord, Great Dharma Master and Inspector of the Numinous Treasure.

The ranks of the enlightened are resplendent, revealing the scriptures of deliverance; the yellow registers and their statutes fully set forth the precepts of dignity. We have followed the codes in reverence, yet in proclaiming the prohibitions, we may have transgressed. We fear that the heavens may lack records of our good deeds, while the Five Emperors hold ledgers of our faults. How can the departed soul ascend? Our special karma is tainted. We look to your vast compassion to grant us great forgiveness, to announce it to the Three Realms, and to inform the Ten Heavens. Together, we attest to the merit of the feast, that its blessings may flow widely. May the rotting bones be clothed anew in flesh, and the withered skeletons rise as living beings. The jade altar is now dispersed, the incense burners’ embers fade, and the sacred talismans are spent. We turn our gaze to your wind-borne chariot, already returned to the jasper heavens.

Overwhelmed by longing and devotion, we bow twice with reverence and take our leave.

---

**Farewell Prayer to the Three Officials:**
In full ritual rank and surname, so-and-so humbly invokes:
The Heavenly Official of Bestowed Blessings, First Rank of the Upper Prime, the Great Emperor of the Purple Tenuity;
The Earthly Official of Pardoned Sins, Second Rank of the Middle Prime, the Great Emperor of Pure Emptiness;
The Water Official of Released Calamities, Third Rank of the Lower Prime, the Great Emperor of Dark Solitude.

We have established the sacred altar of Brahma qi and conducted the purification feast with solemnity; we have humbly summoned the radiant chariots of the Three Primes to witness our covenant. By fortune, the Daoist rites are now complete, and we have been graced by your luminous presence. Yet we fear our profanations have violated the statutes. The registers will record our faults in the Four Offices, and the Nine Treasuries will inscribe our transgressions. We cannot escape the dark decrees, and our errors may reach the unseen realms. We beg for your great mercy to pardon our unforgiven faults. May the earthly records be severed, and the watery covenants dissolved. May all sentient beings in the Dharma realms equally bathe in the wisdom and grace of the Profound Mystery.

Overwhelmed by longing and devotion, we bow twice with reverence and take our leave.

---

**Farewell Prayer to the Heavenly Master:**
In full ritual rank and surname, so-and-so humbly invokes:
The Heavenly Master of the Three Heavens, Great Dharma Master of All Heavens, Perfected Lord of the Orthodox Unity and Serene Response.

The Primordial August One established the teachings, inscribing the three registers; the Master and Treasure bestowed compassion, becoming the lords of the Profound Mystery. We have opened the yellow altar to make our vows and humbly summoned your crimson chariot to descend. The sublime fruit is now perfected, and the true merit shines forth. We reflect that our learning of the Dharma is incomplete, and our observance of the precepts is often flawed. We have presumptuously undertaken the grand rites and conducted the purification feast. We have issued talismanic commands and summoned the spirits. Our devotion was not single-minded, and our reverence was at times negligent. All these are counted as transgressions, and we cannot escape the dark punishments. We pray for your pity and beg for universal pardon. May the imperial transformation be proclaimed, and the Emperor’s compassion be further extended.

We gaze toward the layered heavens, where your true chariot is already prepared. Unable to follow in your radiant train, our spirits strain in longing.

Overwhelmed by longing and devotion, we bow twice with reverence and take our leave.

---

**Farewell Prayer to the Profound Master:**
In full ritual rank and surname, so-and-so humbly invokes:
The Perfected Lord, Great Dharma Master of the Profound Center, Transformative Lord of the Three Heavens.

The rites at the yellow altar are now complete; by fortune, we have roughly performed the grand ceremonies. The white memorial has ascended, and we trust it has silently conveyed our gratitude for your radiant favor. Your celestial chariot has turned back to witness the covenant of the feast. Our sincerity is exhausted, yet we cannot repay the profound grace bestowed. We reflect that our understanding has not yet grasped the Dao, and our bodies have not penetrated the truth. We have presumptuously worn the sacred talismans, yet remain indistinguishable from the demonic and the vulgar. Our duty is to deliver and save, our office to proclaim and transmit. Unmindful of our defiled and insignificant bodies, we have presumptuously undertaken the sacred rites of the enlightened. We have issued talismanic commands and wielded the dew-writing brush. For five days, we have made petitions; for nine mornings, we have offered thanks. We have dispatched generals and officers, wearied the spirits and gods. Our learning of the Dharma is incomplete, and our observance of the precepts is lacking. Our devotion was not single-minded, and our dignity was often deficient. All these profanations are counted as transgressions. We fear the unpardonable punishments and the karmic retributions of both seen and unseen realms. We can only hope for your great pardon and universal compassion. May the sincerity of the feast’s sponsor in seeking the Dao be acknowledged, and may the faults of the Dharma assembly be absolved. May your grace extend to both the unseen and the manifest, bestowing blessings upon the state and its households. May the winds of compassion be greatly stirred, and the teachings of the Dao be forever exalted.

The feast is now dispersed, and the crane-borne chariot cannot be detained.

Overwhelmed by longing and devotion, we bow twice with reverence and take our leave.

With hands bowed to the celestial thoroughfare, our spirits race toward the highest heavens. Overcome with longing and devotion, we reverently kowtow twice and take our leave.

**Document for the Supervising Officials:**
The precious fast has concluded, and the altar rites are complete. Merit has been presented to the Three Heavens, and grace flows to the ten directions. We now beseech the divine chariots to return, each to their sacred abodes. The fast’s sponsor, with utmost reverence, kowtows in farewell.

**Text for the Dharma Assembly Gathering in the Hall:**
The assembly arranges itself in proper order. The cantor leads the faithful in three bows of reverence. They sit in accordance with the ritual.

**First Offering of Food:**
The High Priest recites the incantation for the offering of food:
All fields of merit begin with the offering of sustenance. May the living find joy, and the departed ascend to heaven. May those yet to come dwell in pure lands, where clothing and nourishment arise naturally. Thus, we make offerings universally to all deities. From the fragrant kitchens, exquisite offerings are presented—first to the Heavenly Worthies, then to the Perfected Sages, and finally to all sentient beings, that all may partake equally. May blessings flow to the living and the dead, as waters return to the sea.

**Upon Completion of the Fast:**
The leftover rice is gathered, and the text for offering to all beings is recited:
Diligently cultivating the great Dao’s teachings, with focused minds we move the darkest mysteries. The true descends, and demonic illusions scatter; all malevolent spirits vanish. May the seven generations of ancestors ascend to the heavenly halls, soaring into the highest purity. Since blessings extend universally, this food is offered to all beings.

**Next, the Cantor Proclaims:**
For all future lives, may this create good karmic conditions.

**Dedication of Merit:**
Boundless compassion grants every wish. The great Dao gathers in emptiness, and all prayers are answered. The merits of this fast are limitless, the most excellent of causes. We pray for the fast’s sponsor, their seven generations of ancestors, and the departed souls they commend—may they emerge from eternal night and enter the light. May disasters vanish and blessings descend, that in life and death they may ascend as immortals.

We invoke the great sagely **Yuanshi Tianzun**, the **Most High Lord of the Dao**, the **Most High Lord Lao**, and the **Lingbao Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions**. Unfathomable are their merits.

**Appendix: Rites for Altar Invocation and Posthumous Salvation**
**Formats for Altar Petitions and Dedications**

Residing in [State] [Location], the petitioner of the [Surname] clan, prostrate in reverence, observes the **Unsurpassed Yellow Register Great Fast**, which universally delivers the Three Realms and all sentient beings. Its merit surpasses the myriad Dharmas, its grace extending to all directions.

Reflecting upon my departed kin [Name], who passed into darkness some time ago, now long since gone, I long to offer posthumous veneration yet lack the means to perform proper rites. Learning that [Name] has established the **Unsurpassed Yellow Register Great Fast** to universally deliver the Three Realms and all sentient beings, I humbly beseech to attach this petition for the salvation of [the departed’s] soul, that it may ascend to the realm of blessings.

Herein I record the dates of birth and death as follows:
Departed kin [Name], born in the year, month, day, and hour of [Date], passed away in the year, month, day, and hour of [Date] at [Location], having lived [Number] years. Should multiple names be listed, each shall be recorded in the same manner as above.

With utmost sincerity, this petition is respectfully submitted to the **Great Dharma Bureau of Lingbao**. I prostrate and beseech that, in accordance with the rites, the deliverance be enacted. Awaiting the Dharma decree.

In the [Year] of the Great Year Star, [Month], [Day], petition submitted by the [Surname] clan of [State] [Location].

*Endorsement:*
Petition submitted to the **Gate of the Three Caverns under the Dharma Master**.
Sealed by the [Surname] clan of [State] [Location].

Should outsiders wish to join the fast and attach petitions for the departed during the rite, the Dharma cannot refuse. Following the prescribed format, four copies of the petition shall be prepared and presented at the altar. The Dharma Master shall receive the words and memorialize them to the **Three Heavens**.

The petition is submitted to the **Five Masters of Lingbao**, the **Supreme Emperor of Fengdu**, and the **Divine Tiger Direct Talisman**, who shall summon and escort the souls to the altar for deliverance in accordance with the rites.

Of the four petition copies:
- One shall be submitted to the **Gate of the Three Heavens**,
- One to the **Netherworld**,
- One entrusted to the **Divine Tiger Messenger of the Three Realms**,
- One retained by the bureau for reference.

The petition paper shall be cut to a height of one foot and four inches, written in standard script. When submitted, the sheets shall be joined as one, sealed with an imprint—this being the proper document for an individual establishing the fast. For collective rites, this is not required.

**Memorial to the Three Pure Jade Emperors**
By your subordinate, the Dharma-ranked [Name],

Your subordinate humbly memorializes: For the sake of [Name], who petitions for the posthumous salvation of their departed kin [Name], I beseech permission to establish the **Unsurpassed Yellow Register Great Fast** at [Location] on the [Day] of [Month] to aid in their deliverance.

As per the petition submitted by [Name] and others of [Location], they observe the **Unsurpassed Yellow Register Great Fast**, which universally delivers the Three Realms and all sentient beings. Reflecting upon their departed ancestors, long since passed, they lack the means to perform proper rites and cannot offer salvation. They beseech to attach their petitions to the fast, repenting past transgressions and ascending to the realm of blessings.

Unable to refuse their plea, I have respectfully attached their petitions to the altar and shall enact deliverance in accordance with the rites. I have already memorialized the **Five True Lords of Lingbao**, the **Supreme Emperor of Fengdu of the Northern Darkness**, and the **City God Bureau of the locale**, beseeching their acknowledgment.

Herewith, I submit the attached register of the names, birth dates, and death dates of the departed souls petitioned for, to the **Upper Clarity Heavenly Pivot Institute under the Gate of the Three Heavens**, awaiting the imperial decree.

Beyond this, I prostrate in utmost reverence and submit this memorial, beseeching the celestial mercy to grant my petition. May a special imperial mandate descend to the **Three Realms and Ten Directions**, the **Bureaus of Earth and Water**, the **Netherworld Courts and Dark Prisons**, and all relevant offices, to acknowledge and deliver the departed souls of [Names], their deep-rooted transgressions and grave sins. May they emerge from eternal night, behold the light, and arrive at the sacred altar to partake in the blessings of the fast.

Daring to offend the celestial majesty, I prostrate in fear and trembling, kowtowing repeatedly, acknowledging my transgression. This memorial is respectfully submitted, awaiting the imperial decree.

For the departed souls affiliated with the altar: after the Three Rites of the Fast’s eve and inaugural invocation, the master shall issue a general *Salvation from Suffering* talisman. If the deliverance concludes before the memorial to Fengdu is presented, these souls may also be included in the primary deliverance rites, which is particularly efficacious.

The master shall further incorporate the intent of the fast into the Divine Tiger Pass.

**Chapter: Essential Knowledge for Conducting the Fast**

**Standards for Observance and Offering**
When establishing a grand fast, it is paramount to select a grotto-heaven, blessed land, or Daoist abbey as the superior site.

The altar must be positioned with precise orientation: facing south, with its back to the north, adhering to the original directional alignment of the abbey’s existing altar. If constructed in a separate hall, the altar should be erected according to the prescribed form. Once the altar’s position is correct, even if the hall’s orientation is irregular, the rites may proceed unimpeded.

The fast’s sponsor must cultivate utmost sincerity and reverence. The preparation of dragon-silk and jade-knotted seals must prioritize refinement and excellence. Incense, flowers, oil, and candles—every requisite item—must be pure and immaculate, avoiding any defilement or deficiency at the time of use.

The scriptures state: In performing a grand fast, single-minded devotion is foremost, with dragon-silk as the highest offering. Fragrant candles and reverent purity follow thereafter. Any lapse, however minor, mars the fast’s perfection. Those who uphold these rites must observe these precepts with utmost care.

When establishing a fast, one must act within one’s means. The wealthy may furnish all necessities; the poor may adapt accordingly. The procurement of fast requisites must not involve ill-gotten wealth or disputes over prices. Excessive frugality despite ample means, or forced expenditure beyond one’s capacity, both betray insincerity and hinder divine resonance.

If the fast’s sponsor hails from a family of loyalty and filial piety but lacks resources, the master may provide dragon-silk and other essentials, simplifying all matters as needed.

Documents such as memorials, petitions, and offerings should be categorized appropriately, ensuring propriety in their arrangement.

When the fast’s officiant submits a memorial, those with official rank shall list their titles; those without shall be styled "Devoted Daoist Disciple." If the sponsor is in mourning for parents, they shall be styled "Solitary Child" or "Grieving Child."

If the deceased remains unburied within the household, the dwelling’s dimensions must be measured. If the deceased lies elsewhere, the fast may still be conducted. However, those afflicted by death’s defilement or who have not undergone purification rites may not establish an altar within their home.

The visualization techniques and incantations employed during the fast are recorded in the *Chapter on Fast Rituals and Their Application*. The protocols for chanting and ceremonial deportment are detailed in the *Chapter on Requisites for Observance*. These will not be reiterated here.

**Documentary Procedures**
For memorials to the Celestial Worthies, use a *zou zhuang* (memorial petition); for other matters, use a *shen zhuang* (submission petition). Communications with divine bureaus shall employ *gong die* (official missives).

Memorial petitions shall be styled "Your subject petitions," with the recipient designated as the "Heavenly Pivot Institute," the "relevant bureau," or prefaced with the bureau’s seal. Notices, notes, and missives shall be titled "This Bureau."

For memorials and submissions, leave one hand’s breadth of space at the top and two at the bottom. Paper should measure approximately one *chi* and four *cun* in height; extended scroll paper is preferable. Petitions for offerings and invocations shall use standard petition paper.

Within memorials, the names of sacred entities shall be inscribed on yellow labels and affixed at the appropriate time.

At the top of memorials, affix a yellow strip (*tie huang*), measuring either three *cun* and two *fen* in height by two *cun* and four *fen* in width, or three *cun* and six *fen* in height by three *cun* in width, as the standard. Write in single columns. After affixing the yellow strip, inscribe the officiant’s name at the seam, apply the seal, or follow the imperial court’s format for yellow strips.

Within memorials and submissions, use small yellow labels (*yi huang*) for marginal notes, affixing them beside the year’s cyclical sign.

For memorials and submissions with a single sacred entity, affix a yellow label to the side. For two or four entities, use a slightly wider yellow label affixed centrally. For three or five entities, the central position denotes precedence. For two or four entities, the right side denotes precedence.

Within sacred contexts, write "Before the Throne" or "Before the Sacred." Alternatively, only the foremost entity may be listed. For petitions to terrestrial deities, use white labels.

For square envelopes (*fang han*) containing memorials or submissions, omit the yellow strip on the exterior and do not style the text as "Your subject." Inscribe only the title and the phrase "Memorial Tablet" at both ends. The outer envelope follows the same rule.

If a submission contains multiple sacred entities, the square envelope shall list only the foremost. For example, if the Wood Virtue of the East and the Eastern Dipper’s Seven Mansions are addressed in a single petition, title it: "Before the Sacred, the True Lord Jupiter, Wood Virtue of the East," and the like.

**Stylistic Conventions for Memorials and Submissions**
Memorials to the Supreme Deity shall invoke the "Edict of the Dao’s Compassion"; those to the Celestial Worthies, the "August and Wise Decree." Memorials to the Two Empresses shall invoke the "Sacred Decree of the Celestial Palace."

The Three Clarities and Four Emperors shall be addressed as "Your Majesty"; the Two Empresses as "Your Highness." Celestial Worthies shall be addressed as "Before the Throne"; the Perfected as "Before the Sacred." Terrestrial deities shall be addressed as "Before the Divine."

**Offerings**
Celestial Worthies shall be presented with dragon chariots. Earthly Sovereigns and Lords shall be offered palanquins.

**Protocols for Missives and Notices**
All missives and notices shall be endorsed in vermilion. Official missives shall bear the officiant’s name and signature. Notices and notes shall bear only the signature.

On the front of a missive’s cover, inscribe "Respectfully" at the top, the ritual rank’s seal in the center, the officiant’s name and signature below, and "Sealed" at the bottom, using three seals. On the reverse, inscribe the bureau’s seal, "For the Attention of the Director," using two seals.

For notices, on the front, imprint the ritual rank’s seal, sign, and inscribe "Sealed" at the bottom, using one seal at the front and two at the back.

For memorials and submissions sealed at the half-year mark, inscribe the officiant’s name and affix one seal, with another below the perforation.

Square envelopes shall bear three seals on both front and back.

All missives, notices, placards, and the like shall be signed and sealed. For official missives and placards, the cyclical year’s line shall bear four seals, with three at the front. Notices shall bear one seal at the half-year mark.

All seals shall be applied starting from the back.

**Talismans, Bamboo Slips, and Announcements**
For talismans, bamboo slips, and announcements, affix one seal to the date. For perforated documents, use two seals on the front and one on the back.

Talismanic documents sent in square envelopes shall follow the envelope’s sealing protocol.

Memorials and submissions to celestial entities shall use the *Three Qi Flying Mystery Jade Seal* or the *Seal of the Lord of the Great Dharma of All Heavens*. Square envelopes shall bear the same seal at both ends or the *Seal of the Universal Chapter*, with the *Seal of the Great Dharma Bureau of the Numinous Treasure* on the front.

Submissions to middle and lower celestial entities shall use the *Seal of the Great Dharma Bureau of the Numinous Treasure*.

Longevity talismans shall bear the *Primordial Qi Seal of the Yuan Shi*. Salvation talismans shall use the *Azure Mystery Salvation Seal*. Jade missives shall bear the *Seal of the Lord of the Jade Chief Bureau*.

For talismanic documents belonging to the Jade Clarity realm, use the *Seal of the Primordial Beginning*. For those belonging to the Eastern Ultimate, use the *Salvation Seal*. For those belonging to the Highest Clarity, use the *Seal of the Three Heavens and the Most High*. This seal may also be universally applied to all talismans. Memorials and petitions shall use the *Seal of the Nine Elder Immortals of the Immortal Capital*. Green petitions shall use the *Three Qi Jade Seal*. Outer envelopes shall follow the protocol for memorials: the central seal shall be the *Three Qi Jade Seal*, while the seals at both ends may use either the *Seal of the Three Heavens and the Most High* or the *Universal Chapter Seal*.

For written memorials, each line shall contain seventeen characters, spaced two cun and four fen apart, forming a single line. The paper shall be one chi and two cun in height. For memorial tablets, each line shall contain twenty-four characters as the standard, with the number of sheets and lines preferably being odd. Leave two blank lines at the beginning and three at the end, following the usual format. Green petitions shall follow the same format as memorials and tablets, without restriction on the number of characters. Leave a space of one palm’s width at the beginning and two palms’ width at the end. For documents requiring perforation, use a three-cun yellow paper strip, and enclose the outer envelope in a square case.

All memorials, petitions, and tablets shall be written in a dedicated chamber, where an incense table shall be set. No outsiders shall be permitted entry. The scribe must bathe, change clothes, and enter the chamber. When writing memorials or petitions, cover both ends of the paper to prevent contact with clothing. In writing memorials or petitions, do not begin with a person’s name or place a ghost character at the head. Do not invert characters for life or death or mutilate a person’s name. When burning incense, do not use ashes or fire from the stove. For burning paper money and other offerings, do not use oil lamps or candles to ignite them. For vegetarian offerings, do not use dairy products. Do not consume alcohol before the ritual.

The High Priest must have received the *Register of the Three and Five Capital Offices*, the *Zhengyi Alliance Register*, the *Middle Alliance Five Dharma Registers of the Numinous Treasure*, the *Ten Sections of the Wondrous Scriptures of the Numinous Treasure*, and be practiced in the *Great Dharma of the Numinous Treasure* before conducting rituals according to the regulations. If only the *Register of the Capital Offices* and the *Alliance Register* have been received, along with the *Numinous Treasure Scriptures* and the practice of the *Celestial Pivot* and *Celestial Heart* refinement and deliverance methods, they may also be permitted to perform the rituals. In memorials and petitions, where the *Great Dharma Bureau of the Numinous Treasure* is mentioned, and in ritual protocols where the *Alliance of the Three Caverns’ Treasure Scripts and Golden Characters of Jade* is referenced, the text must be adjusted accordingly.

If a Dharma Master has only received the *Register of the Capital Offices* and the *Registers of Ascending Mystery, Yang Radiance, or Cavern Abyss*, but not the *Alliance Register*; or only the *Register of the Capital Offices* and the *Middle Alliance Five Dharma Registers*, but not the *Alliance Register*; or only the *Register of the Capital Offices* and the *Highest Clarity Register*, but not the *Alliance Register*; or only the *Register of the Capital Offices* without the *Alliance Register*; or only the *Alliance Register* without the *Register of the Capital Offices*—none of these shall be permitted to conduct rituals. The Numinous Treasure ritual protocols originate from the officials of the *Three and Five* and *Zhengyi* registers; without both registers, the officiating ranks are incomplete, and no ritual may be performed.

The five roles below the *Chief Lector* must also have received the *Three and Five*, *Zhengyi*, *Numinous Treasure*, and *Yang Radiance* registers before they may participate in the altar. When inviting fellow Daoist participants, they must be those who endure kneeling and bowing, embrace simplicity, dedicate themselves to incense and rituals, and do not covet wealth and property, before they may form a sworn alliance. They shall ascend the altar and, together with the ritual patrons, devote themselves sincerely to beseeching the celestial realms, thereby invoking divine response. If they merely focus on the beauty of sounds and rhythms without concentrated devotion, not only will they waste their energy and squander resources, but they may also incur blame and achieve nothing. The success of the ritual lies entirely in the selection of participants; this must not be taken lightly.

Twelve *Ritual Attendants* responsible for maintaining decorum must first master the *Scripture of Pacing the Void* and the *Ten Great Pacing the Void* chants. During the circumambulation of the main ritual, they shall accompany the chanting with their voices. Scribes assigned to write documents must bathe and wash their clothes upon arrival, ensuring cleanliness before commencing work. Scribes and all personnel involved in the bureau shall first make a covenant not to return home for meals or lodging. A separate person shall be assigned to provide them with food and accommodations. Another person shall be designated to manage the paper and writing materials, distributing them by count. If errors occur, no corrections or alterations are permitted; instead, the entire sheet must be rewritten, and a new sheet of paper shall be provided. The erroneous sheet shall be collected for verification of the paper count and to assess the scribe’s accuracy.

The quantity of paper and writing materials allocated by the *Office of Ritual Expenses* is a fixed amount. When purchasing paper, acquire several dozen extra sheets to replace those with errors. The forty-ninth scroll of the *Complete Ritual of the Supreme Yellow Register Great Fast* concludes here. The fiftieth scroll begins.

**Additional preparations:**
Ascension Bridge of the Dao,

Nine Dark Realms Illumination Lantern Plaques,
Refinement and Transcendence Water-Fire Pools,
Banner poles,
Memorial incense burner,
One *shi* of fine sand,
One hundred bundles of dried bamboo (washed clean and sun-dried),
One hundred *jin* of charcoal,
One bundle of small bamboo,
Four clean water buckets,
Ten buckets for washing ritual implements,
Two fumigation baskets,
Ten boxes for memorial documents,
Four clean towels.

**The above are calculated according to the original liturgical manual. Should any items remain unlisted, prepare them as appropriate.**

**When establishing a grand vegetarian feast, abundant ritual offerings are ideal, yet this is only feasible for those of great means. If a filial descendant, moved by deep devotion, lacks the resources to fulfill all requirements, the master should assess their contribution and reduce the scale of offerings—such as incense, candles, spirit money, memorial paper, and other ritual necessities—without demanding perfection, lest even a trace of reluctance arise.**

**As for altar linens, the scriptures provide no fixed measure. The master’s share of ritual donations should be distributed among fellow participants and the poor, for “not coveting is the true treasure.” Yet in this age, such principles are often reversed, their essence lost.**

**End of Volume Fifty-Six of the *Supreme Yellow Register Great Fast Rite Standard Procedures***
**Beginning of Volume Fifty-Seven of the *Supreme Yellow Register Great Fast Rite Standard Procedures***
**Appendix: Record of the Book’s Composition**

My late father, Master of the Fast, posthumously named **Chúyú**, courtesy name **Dézhān** (formerly **Xiāohán**), of the Jiang clan.
From the Liang dynasty’s *Tōngpǔ* era, our family resided in Yóngjiā. His great-grandfather was named **Fú**; his grandfather, **Dūn**, posthumously honored as *Zhòng Dàfū*. His father, **Xíngjiǎn**, served as *Cháo Yì Dàfū*, Prefect of Chǔzhōu, posthumously honored as *Zhòng Fèng Dàfū*.

In the *Shàoxī* era, *Rénzǐ* year, my father was granted the title *Dífēng Láng* through imperial favor and served as the *Hùyàn* (accounting clerk) of Yángzhōu. During times of fiscal hardship, he was renowned for his integrity. When the *Zhōng Fèng* passed away, Governor Hóng of the *Shàodào* deeply lamented his loss. Later, when stationed in Lín’ān to oversee the *Shàn Dīngsūn* (military conscription), he was tasked with managing the *Rénhé Yánchǎng* (salt fields). The *Tínghù* (village households) were rebellious and disruptive, repeatedly undermining his governance. My father enforced strict financial regulations, and all acknowledged his impartiality, fearing his authority while cherishing his benevolence. After three years, his performance exceeded expectations, and he was specially promoted to *Chéngzhí Láng*, serving as the *Jūn Jiétuī* (military administrator) of Yuèzhōu.

In the *Yǐhài* year, a drought and locust plague ravaged the region for several years. He submitted petitions to the *Lù Yù* (Provincial Administration) for relief measures, actively implementing policies to aid the starving. Markets remained stable, and no one in the countryside went hungry. When a false accusation arose against the Lǐ family for worshipping a wild shrine, my father investigated their household, uncovering the full truth through official records. After one interrogation, he exposed the deceit, exonerating all involved—saving dozens from execution. By the end of *Chúnxī*, the *Zhōng Fèng*’s governance brought prosperity, and the people erected shrines in his honor at Liángshān and at the site where my father had cleared the Lǐ family’s name. Those wronged wept along the road, saying: *"We knew he was the son of Magistrate Jiang."*

Later, he served as *Chéng* of Yǒngxīn in Jìzhōu, where he was quickly recommended for merit and transferred to *Yìyáng Xiàn* in Xìnzhōu. The county’s administration had long been corrupt; monthly tribute to the *Jiānghuái* armies and monthly remittances to *Huáidōng* drained the treasury, often exceeding allocated quotas. Outlying regions suffered from exhaustion, and the people, burdened by oppressive taxes, resorted to deceit and usury, with many ruined by forced labor. My father personally reviewed the registers, rooting out official malfeasance, and governed with simplicity, prioritizing the people’s grievances. He resolved long-standing disputes, relieving wronged parties, and adjusted tax burdens to ease the pressure of collections. He suppressed powerful local bullies to protect the virtuous. When officials and scholars presented petitions outlining local hardships, he acted immediately. His policies reached even the most remote villages, where elders and scholars gathered in awe, singing his praises in verse—news of his governance spread to the imperial court.

The ancestral temples and ritual altars had fallen into disrepair, and the *Shī* (shrines) were neglected. My father restored them all, planting appropriate vegetation. Schools, granaries, and official halls that had decayed were repaired at his expense, using funds from his own administrative surplus—unlike previous officials who embezzled for personal gain. He ensured no one remained unjustly imprisoned, and even the most vulnerable—widows, orphans, and the destitute—received fair hearings without delay. His devotion to the people was absolute, sparing no effort.

His subordinates worked tirelessly, day and night, forgetting to take breaks.

His life ended from grief and diligent service, his illness already impairing his vision. Though the official documents were as yet unfulfilled, he still entrusted his deputy, saying, *"Do not relax the county laws."* He knelt in prayer to the heavens, sat upright, and passed away on the twenty-sixth day of the first month of the *Jiādìng* era (1217), at the age of sixty-two.

He had accumulated the rank of *Chéngyì Láng* (Honorary Advisor), and in the year *Xīnyǐ* (1083), he was granted the *Míngtáng* (Ennobled by Imperial Ancestral Temple) title, with the privilege of wearing the five-rank official attire. Alas, how grievous it is!

My father, in his youth, was precociously bright and discerning, with keen intellect and a luminous spirit. He studied widely across ancient and modern texts, never tiring, and could recite from memory whatever he read once or twice. He was earnest and sincere, never speaking frivolously, and his nature was noble yet gentle, his breadth of mind vast and harmonious. Those who knew him found him distant, never seeing the colors of his joy or anger.

He mastered the *Táng Lǜ* (Tang Dynasty legal codes), their style austere yet refined, and found his own delight in them. His ambition was not content with small achievements, and he explored countless schools of thought. Celestial phenomena, earthly geography, the cycles of *qì* (cosmic breath), calendrical systems, granary techniques, and *Yúfāng* (medical prescriptions), as well as *Gānxīng* (astronomical divination) and *wūxué* (occult studies)—he delved deeply into all. Yet, above all, he was captivated by the essence of *Hùnyuán Dàodé* (the supreme Dao/Virtue of the cosmos).

In the year *Yǐnguāng* (1205) of the *Qìngyuán* era, *Chóngjìng* (Master of Serenity) invited my father to *Bùcáng* (Bracketed Mountains). My father met him in the *Yānyǔlóu* (Misty Rain Tower), and they discussed ancient ritual methods. Their tastes aligned in the profound, and thus their friendship was sealed. In the years *Jǐwù* (1318) and *Rénxū* (1322), he revisited *Chóngjìng*’s *Zhúgōng* (Bamboo Study), engaging in thorough discussions.

*Chóngjìng* praised him highly and entrusted him with all the insights gained from his *Jīngshū* (Upland Shrine) masters and reclusive sages. My father mastered their transformations and applied them, and his methods always proved effective.

Whether in urgent or leisurely matters, he never refused to answer. His strange and miraculous cures were renowned, and his responses to inquiries were swift and precise. *Chóngjìng* said to my father: *"Take the Three Caverns True Scriptures as the foundation of the Dao/Way, and regard the Ten Directions’ Repentance as genuine sincerity. Devote your thoughts to the Nine Dynasties, and submit your petitions in triplicate. Such are the rituals as they should be. The convoluted, deceptive, and illusory are not the way."*

He also said: *"The salvation of beings is boundless; the myriad paths converge in the One Dao. The Master *Táidìng Tiān* (Master of Tranquil Virtue) resides in the place where his teachings are transmitted, yet his methods are limited to saving the dying, averting celestial disasters, pacifying emperors, and warding off malevolent influences. What is lacking is the means to guide both heaven and humanity. Why not expound upon the scriptures’ intent and supplement what Master *Táidìng Tiān* did not complete—would that not be excellent?"*

My father pondered deeply his teacher’s lessons, lamenting the corruption of contemporary customs, following the trends without return, indulging in superficiality while abandoning substance, and truncating the remnants of genuine tradition. He practiced vocal recitation for mere pleasure, relying on hollow symbols and echoing influences to feign divinity. As false doctrines spread and perverse teachings proliferated, he systematically reviewed ancient texts, tracing their origins and examining all his teacher’s past experiences and esoteric writings. He pored over every scroll and manuscript, night and day, by the light of his *yíngchuáng* (lamp like a firefly) and *hánjiàn* (cold wick), tirelessly copying and annotating them.

For the vulgar and shallow language of these texts, he refined and corrected it; for their erroneous practices, he clarified and dismantled them. Where teachings diverged in intent, he harmonized them into unity; where rituals were disordered, he pruned and restored them to their proper form.

He compiled the *Huánglù Zhāiyí* (Sacred Rituals of the Yellow Scrolls) into thirty-six volumes, the *Zìrán Zhāiyí* (Natural Rituals) into fifteen volumes, and the *Dùrén Xiūzhāi Xíngxiāng Sòngjīng Yí* (Rituals for Guiding Beings, Observing Rituals, and Reciting Scriptures) into twenty-four volumes. In total, he called his work the *Língbǎo Yùjiǎn* (Jewel Mirror of the Numinous Treasure), comprising seventy-five volumes.

He began in the *Jiātài Rénxū* year (1204) and completed it in the *Jiādìng Guǐwǔ* year (1213), spanning twenty years of labor. Such was his devotion to upholding the great teachings.

Disciples like *Zhū Suì* (Master Zhu), *Lín Yáofú* (Master Lin), *Chén Zìchéng* (Master Chen), and *Zhào Xīhuǒ* (Master Zhao) followed his methods.

As he lay dying, he told *Xīyīng* (Master Xi) and others: *"Death is the fate of life; wealth and honor are decrees of heaven. My work has fortunately reached completion, yet my great destiny arrives suddenly. If I die, you must return my writings to the ancestral shrine. Perhaps the ritual methods will thus continue to flourish, and the living and the dead may find reliance in them—then my hopes will be fulfilled."*

For a scholar’s conduct, it is only necessary to avoid associating with those inferior to oneself. With these words, he closed his eyes and departed.

After his passing, his body remained as if alive. Alas, heaven! How profound it is that, at the threshold of death and life, he remained unshaken—my father had truly attained the core principles of *Dàodé* (Dao/Virtue) and *Xuányuán* (the Primordial Source)!

We, his disciples, grieved deeply and endured bitterness, reverently following his final instructions. We meticulously reviewed and verified his writings four times, then sealed them in a hidden mountain.

Moreover, we appended his official career and major deeds, recording the beginning and end of his life, so that future generations may have something to study. In the seventh month of the *Jiādìng Guǐwǔ* year (1213), his unfilial son, *Fǎmíng Chōngsù* (Master of Serenity, posthumously ordained), and *Xiānyīng* (Master Xi), his disciple, wept blood and inscribed this with utmost care.

**Record of Master *Chóngjìng* (Master of Serenity) *Liú Yòngguāng* (Use Light, courtesy name *Dàohuī*), of the *Liú* (Leave) clan, originally from the *Héluò* (River Luo) region.**

His sixth-generation ancestor served in the *Táng* (Tang), holding the rank of *Yīnqīng Guānglù Dàfū* (Silver Green Light and Grand Minister).

In the Five Dynasties period, his family relocated to Jìnjiāng in Quánzhōu. When the Song Dynasty rose and pacified the four quarters, his fifth-generation ancestor, endowed with extraordinary talent, traveled westward through the Jiānghuái region, passing through Shàngráo Prefecture, and was captivated by the noble Yǔnxī Cloud Peak Mountain, where he settled.

His father, Fā, cultivated purity and virtue, embodying the upright demeanor of an ancient gentleman. Together with his wife, Lady Zhān, they received the *fǎjiào* (initiation rites) from the Longhú Shān (Dragon Tiger Mountain) under the guidance of the Heavenly Master. One night, he dreamed of the Han-era Heavenly Master, who bestowed upon him an elixir, saying: *"Consume this, and you shall have a son who will grow weary of worldly life."* Thus, she conceived.

Master *Chóngjìng* was born with innate brilliance and ancient grace, disciplined and dignified in bearing. From his youth, he grasped profound Daoist learning and received the Way from the Daoist priest Cài Yuǎnjiǔ of the Shàngqīng Zhēngyī Palace. Cài Yuǎnjiǔ, during the Xuān Hé era, held the title of *Tàisù Dàfū* (Grand Master of Supreme Purity) and was registered in the *Níngshén Diàn* (Hall of Concentrated Spirit), being the third-generation descendant of Wáng Dàojiān.

After taking the Daoist vows, he upheld his resolve with unwavering resolve, maintaining singular focus and profound depth. He delved into the arcane, uncovering hidden meanings and traversing perilous paths. Whether examining *jīnjiǎn yùzì* (golden tablets and jade inscriptions), *qióngzhuàn lánghán* (jade seals and bronze cases), the ten *dòng* (caverns) of vital precepts, or the inner texts of the *Sānhuáng* (Three Sovereigns), he mastered their essence and clarified their lineages.

The *sutra* of all Daoist teachings was without exception mastered, with particular devotion to the *Yùfǔ Wǔléi* (Five Thunder Laws of the Jade Treasury) and the *Zhèngyī* (Orthodox Unity) as his core doctrines. In secret, he practiced *yuánliàn* (primordial refinement) for thirty years.

Emperor Xiàozōng, moved by his loyalty, bestowed upon him the title *Xīyí* (Recluse of the Western Peak) and granted him the favor of nine respite days. He was entrusted with great governance over the three administrative circuits.

In a year of severe drought, the prefectural governor, Lord Shěn, constructed a ritual platform, having heard of his mastery over wind and thunder. He was summoned with great ceremony. Upon arrival, the priest inscribed talismans with seals, commanding officials and spirits to assemble with the might of rivers and mountains—all in solemn order. The officials, farmers, and elders alike marveled in awe.

That very day, torrential rain fell, flooding the four borders. The governor and above reported the drought at court. The emperor, delighted by the report, summoned him to the capital, lodging him in the *Tàiyī* (Great Unity) Palace, and commanded him to perform the rain-summoning rites as before. He also engraved an iron talisman, driving away the Dragon Master.

Soon after, the rain poured down furiously, like a deluge. The Western Lake and the Grand Canal, once parched and impassable by boat, were now overflowing. The emperor dispatched an imperial attendant with a decree, ordering the Dragon to return. In an instant, the clouds dispersed, and sunlight broke through. The emperor was greatly pleased, summoning him to the *Xuǎndé* (Select Virtue) Hall, where he bestowed lavish praise and rewards. He was granted a golden seal, appointed *Yòujiē Dàolù* (Right Street Daoist Master), and honored as a *gāoshì* (High Sage). After returning to his mountain retreat, a year passed before imperial messengers hurried to summon him along the way—only to encounter rain. Turning to the envoys, he said:

*"My prayers have been long. If Heaven does not divide its boundaries, how could the rain follow my carriage upon arrival?"*

The emperor replied: *"Indeed, your conduct is pure and lofty, your sincere devotion moving even the heavens."*

He inscribed an eight-character decree, which, upon receiving, the priest humbly declined, saying: *"Your Majesty’s virtue stirs the heavens—how could the rain disobey? My sincerity is but foolishness; what power could I possess?"*

When winter brought no snow, he was commanded to perform rites, invoking the mountain rivers and hundred spirits, and snow fell to a depth of a foot. The emperor marveled even more.

When the noble consort Liu of the *Déshòu* (Longevity and Virtue) Palace passed away, the palace conducted *Huángluó* (Yellow Talisman) rites. That night, there were strange sounds, as if the spirit of Lady Li had appeared. He was summoned to the private audience hall, where he was consulted on matters of ghosts and spirits. He replied:

*"The interplay of yin and yang is the Dao. Ghosts and spirits are the unfathomable manifestations of yin and yang. They coalesce into form, dispersing as *qi*. The Daoist method of gathering *qi* to restore spirit reveals their true nature."*

The emperor agreed.

*"Moreover, within the Daoist laws lies the essential doctrine of Orthodox Unity, its texts profound yet comprehensive. Why not compile an annotated commentary, to be presented to the throne for engraving and dissemination?"*

The *qí* (fortune) of the *jì* (fate) was again fulfilled, and he returned to serve the *dàoshū* (Daoist Master) in charge of the *Guójiāo* (orthodox teaching) gates. He oversaw the affairs of the *Lónghǔshān* (Dragon Tiger Mountain) and the *Shàngqīng* (Upper Clarity) *Zhèngyī* (Orthodox Unity) Palace.

When *Guāngzōng* (Emperor Guangzong) ascended the throne by *shòu* (receiving the imperial seal), he happened to violate the *yùshòu* (auspicious longevity) taboo. The emperor wore a worried expression, and commanded him to perform Daoist rites of *fá* (Dao) purification and exorcism. Suddenly, a towering spirit appeared, disheveled hair and sword drawn, standing in the palace hall. The attendants were struck with awe.

The emperor himself remained serene and unperturbed. The two palaces rejoiced in harmony. He was granted the title *Chōngjìng Xiānshēng* (Mr. Pacifying Tranquility), but he declined.

After the emperor’s enthronement, he prayed for snow. That night, he conducted the *Lǜzhāng* (Green Talisman) rites, and the stars and constellations still hung scattered and bright. At dawn, he reported the joyful snowfall to the throne, and the emperor marveled at it, promoting him to *zuǒjiē Dàolù* (Left Street Daoist Registrar) and then to *Tàiyī* (Supreme Unity) Palace *dūjiàn* (Superintendent).

In the year *rénxū* (1612, by the *Zhūyòu* cycle), there was a drought. The emperor entrusted him with the task of summoning rain, and he was just ascending the ritual platform to perform the rain-appeasing *fá* (Dao) when the sound of rain suddenly echoed like the roar of rivers and seas. The emperor said, *"Retain your service—you are a rain-maker."* He was granted imperial calligraphy on *yásimpli* (jade tablets).

The following year, there was again a lack of rain. He spoke to the inner palace hall: *"I am but a humble grass and reed, year after year beseeching Heaven. If the Celestial Sovereign has chastisement, my guilt is unforgivable. The *Huángguān* (Yellow Crown) *jìjiǔ* (Sacrificial Officer), how dare I monopolize the rites for the dead?"* The emperor replied, *"Plead for my sake—Heaven truly praises you. Do not decline."* At that moment, rain fell, and the *jiāosì* (ritual sacrifices to Heaven and Earth) were completed. He paid thanks at the *Tàiyī* Palace and was transferred to the *zuǒyòu jiē Dàolù* (Registrar of Both Left and Right Streets).

One day, he suddenly said, *"Life has bounds, knowledge knows no end. To let the bound follow the unbound—this is surely my folly."* He added, *"A scholar should not linger in celestial peaks or vanish in misty forests, nor should he tarry in the capital, troubling the worldly sovereign. This is my fault."* He begged earnestly to be allowed to return home. Though summoned by imperial edict four times, he declined each time due to illness.

On the New Year’s Day, he visited the *Dìshì Zhēnwǔ* (Emperor’s True Martial) Palace and took his leave with a smile. Someone asked, *"Where are you going?"* He replied, *"To wander in the realm of *Wúhéyǒu* (No-Where)."* Again, someone asked, *"Will you visit the *Báiyù Jīng* (White Jade Capital), or pay respects at the *Pénglái Dǎo* (Penglai Isle)?"* He answered, *"A fleeting thought arises—this is called *wàngxiǎng* (delusive fancy). The Great Sage’s perspective is boundless; who comes and who goes?"* Then, he entered his chamber, sat upright, and ascended.

One day, after seven days, his complexion remained as if alive—was this not truly the *shījiě* (corpse dissolution) spoken of?

His posthumous memorial reached the Emperor, who sighed and lamented. He bestowed fragrant gifts and funeral stipends, and provided the rites and proclamations for his burial.

Since his residence in the *Zhúgōng* (Bamboo Palace), noble families of princes, ministers, and high officials all invited him with utmost respect, hosting grand feasts and open prayers, seeking *dàowèn shòufǎ* (Dao/Way and teachings) from him. All came with sincerity and exertion, each finding favor in his presence.

With talismanic water to aid others, and rescue for those in peril without recourse, his footsteps outside their doors were as if he knew them by name.

Through endless nights of inscribing *zhuàn* (divinatory scripts), he never grew weary in his dealings with people.

For those who refused to sell charms, he provided funds for *zhāijiào* (vegetarian feasts and exorcisms), meticulously following the ancient texts.

He often said: *"Men use their emotions to petition the imperial gate—how could there be no way to reach the Emperor?"*

In drafting petitions and memorials, he expressed what others could not: his eloquent, nuanced compositions on matters of *zhāngcí* (proclamations), *biǎoshū* (memorials), *diéxí* (edicts), and *jièshì* (exhortations and oaths) numbered in the hundreds, not a single one flawed.

Across *Jiāngzhè* (the Jiangnan region), ten thousand *huánglù dà zhāijiào* (Yellow Banner Grand Exorcism Feasts) were established, and the *jǐngyǐng* (miraculous responses) were so profound that records were filled to overflowing.

One day, the *Shòukāng Huánghòu* (Empress Dowager Shou Kang) summoned him to the palace for a grand exorcism, honoring the *Xīngdì* (Star Emperor) with twelve hundred offerings, each of vast wealth and splendid ritual.

The overseers remarked: *"The Master is already wealthy."*

He smiled without replying, and after the rites were completed, he gathered the Star Emperor’s offerings and banknotes, burning them all together.

He then distributed gold to the *Xīnzhēng Yīgōng* (New Year’s Palace) within the Imperial City, storing tens of *láng* (hall chambers) worth, surpassing even the treasures of *Jiāngnán* (the southern Jiang region).

He also donated to the scriptural repositories of all departments.

For ruined temples, collapsed bridges, and broken paths, he repaired and restored them, his relief for the destitute and aid to the urgent being most fervent.

As in the case of *Yángshì* (Yang Family) revived from ashes, *Zháishì* (Zhai Family) vindicated in court, *Róngyī* (Rong’s son) saved from drowning, and *Zhèngzhuàn* (Zheng’s descendants) spared from unjust fate—his deeds were especially praised.

*Zǐsī* (Master Zisi) said, *"Utmost sincerity can exhaust one’s nature."* But he went further, exhausting the nature of all people and all things.

*Mèngzǐ* (Master Mencius) spoke of *"the benevolent will that extends even to the unknowable spirits."* His practices were indeed devoted to the *chōngmì* (sublime and secret) and the *qínzhì* (ardent and profound).

In aligning the heart with the *Tian* (Heavenly), and in *shìtiān* (serving Heaven), his only concern was *shè* (parsimony).

In connecting with the *língguǐ* (spirits and ghosts), his *rén* (benevolence) encompassed both the living and the dead.

His achievements were heard in the
