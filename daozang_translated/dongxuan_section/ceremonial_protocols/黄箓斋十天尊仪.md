**Sacred Rite of the Ten-Day Yellow Talisman**
Upon hearing the sacred rites, the Three Realms of the Highest Worthies eternally abide above the Jade Capital;
The Ten Days stretch boundless, reaching afar to the Golden Gate.

This is the dwelling of the illustrious saints, all named the Realm of the Boundless Dao.
In awe of the Jade Throne’s benevolent transformation, I earnestly invoke the sincere compassion of the Saviors.

To those who have not yet heard the teachings, I reveal the sacred realm.
If they return with unwavering devotion, I will surely manifest boundless discernment without bias.

I guide the ascent of both heavenly and human beings,
So that the living may intimately embrace the blessings of goodness;
I bestow upon the unseen paths,
So that the departed may forever escape the bonds of karma.

With this solemn vow of fasting, I dare not forget my return to the Dao.

Now, the officiant [name omitted] constructs a Daoist hall,
To provide offerings for the departed.

I rely upon the Dao’s power,
And together we extol its virtues.

The jade terrace and crimson gate stand clear beneath the Milky Way’s dust,
While ethereal pink clouds brush the crimson sky’s vast expanse.

Pursuing merit and spiritual essence to attain boundless virtue.

**The Heavenly Lord of True Sovereign and Divine Spirit**

The **Three Mountains’** immortal caverns seal the mists and clouds,
While **Lang Yuan’s** and **Peng Hu’s** landscapes are most wondrous.
A thousand years pass without need of the golden cauldron’s elixir,
Yet in every season, one personally admires the jade orchid’s bloom.
Fish and dragons sprawl across the boundless **Stygian Depths**,
While **Luan** and **Huo** birds soar in extravagant display.
From here, the divine rites extend their distant paths,
And the triumphant feasts are ever the abode of immortals.

In harmony with the inconceivable merit.

It is heard that there exists a wondrous scripture,
Unfurled across the **Green Void**;
The ten directions’ sacred realms
Are distinguished within the **Red Mists**.

And attain the essence of returning to the Dao.
Guiding the multitude along the path of confusion,
I strike the **Most High’s** boundless compassion.

I offer the departed souls,
And extol the precious verses.

**The Heavenly Lord Who Follows the Voice to Save Suffering**

The Heavenly Lord’s mercy is vast and boundless,

And the departed souls take flight toward the realm of rebirth.

In harmony with the inconceivable merit.

The extolling of virtues has been fully completed.
I offer the departed souls,

And rely upon the Dao’s boundless grace.
Ascending to the immortal realm,
To wander freely and at ease.

May blessings extend to both the living and the departed,
And benefit all who exist.
All sentient beings alike may ascend to the Dao’s shore.
