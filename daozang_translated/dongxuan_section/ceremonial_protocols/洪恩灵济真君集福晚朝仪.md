**Rite of the Evening Audience for Gathering Blessings of the Venerable Sovereign of Vast Grace and Numinous Aid**

The ritual proceeds according to form. Each pays reverence to the master and maintains mindfulness as prescribed.

**Invocation of the Divine Incantation:**
The radiance of divine light illumines brightly,
Auspicious qi swirls in encompassing grace.
The Dipper and Ladle gleam with limpid splendor,
The halls of lingzhi mushrooms stand serene.
Eyes of jade and spirits of gold—pure perfection,
The precious altar is wholly of the Qian trigram.
Transforming night into day,
Reversing midnight to noon.
The Great Flower streams forth its hues,
The vermilion phoenix soars in mystery.
Quelling demons and vanquishing treachery,
It strides aloft through propitious mist.
The Perfected of Heaven gather in full,
All arriving before the Celestial Emperor.

**Strike the Dharma Drum twenty-four times.**

**Invocation of the Most High Mysterious Origin, the Five Numinous Venerable Lords:**

May all deign to gaze upon us with vast compassion and condescend to scrutinize us with penetrating insight.

We have heard that movement gives rise to yang, stillness gives rise to yin, and the wondrous subtleties of the Dao secretly emerge from the Supreme Ultimate.

Rites speak of reverence, virtue speaks of abundance, and the canons of ceremonial observances are fully recorded in the liturgical codes. The ceaseless mechanism of movement manifests the resplendent virtue of cherishing life. Dragon scripts and phoenix seals gather the radiance of stars and sun. Whirlwind chariots and feathered conveyances descend in solemnity from the clouds and heavens to the earth. The court’s rites are solemnly observed, and the audience is grandly held; the offerings of the jiao rite are presented with earnest words. The grace of imperial favor is majestically bestowed upon the imperial banners, and the thick fragrance of incense drifts through the evening hall. The scrutiny is illustrious, and the regard and acceptance are without omission. The long-held aspirations are earnest and lofty, and the original sincerity remains unswerving. The assembly of the hundred spirits and host of perfected beings, the ten directions and three realms, all arrive in unison. The fast is for serving Heaven, and the august countenance is seen most near; as dusk falls into evening, the joyous radiance shines forth in splendor. Crimson clouds and vermilion mists soar, auspicious stars and propitious clouds gleam brilliantly. In stately and majestic array, august and resplendent, they witness the sincerity of the jiao offerings and bestow abundant and manifold blessings.

On this evening audience, ascending the altar to perform the Dao, the assembled ritualists now present the first pinch of incense, chanting in harmony: *The incense reaches the Palace of Numinous Aid, pervading the Nine Heavens’ Golden Gates to form a canopy of blossoms, offering to the Manifestly Numinous and Vastly Beneficent Perfected Lord.* May this fragrant smoke offer to the Vastly Beneficent Perfected Lord of the Nine Heavens’ Golden Gates and the Vastly Beneficent Perfected Lord of the Nine Heavens’ Jade Gates. We, your servants, take refuge in body, spirit, and life to the host of perfected immortals and sagely beings of the Palace of Numinous Aid. May the merit of this pinch of incense be dedicated to the Vastly Beneficent Perfected Lords of the Nine Heavens’ Golden and Jade Gates, that they may illumine the Dao and attain virtue, broadly benefiting all with manifest numinosity. May their literary splendor shine in the celestial mechanisms, their radiance illuminating the stars; may their mighty prestige resound in the Thunder Department, governing the revolutions of yin and yang. Blossoms unite in brilliance, ocarinas and flutes play in succession; their divine works are beyond recounting, their sagely transformations are boundless. Thus, we now burn incense, taking refuge in the virtue of the Great Sages and host of perfected beings, the Perfected Lords. Since attaining the Dao, they have preserved Heaven and endured eternally, chanting in harmony: *In union with the Dao, they merge with the Perfected.*

We have heard that fragrant mists fill the sky, and evening clouds congeal in emerald. The earnest aspirations of morning attendance and the vigilant hearts of evening watchfulness—on this evening audience, ascending the altar to perform the Dao, we now present the second pinch of incense, chanting in harmony: *The incense reaches the Palace of Numinous Aid, pervading the Nine Heavens’ Jade Gates to form a canopy of treasures, offering to the Manifestly Numinous and Vastly Beneficent Perfected Lord.* May this fragrant smoke offer to the Vastly Beneficent Perfected Lords of the Nine Heavens’ Golden and Jade Gates and the host of perfected immortals and sagely beings of the Palace of Numinous Aid. We, your servants, take refuge in body, spirit, and life to the host of perfected immortals and sagely beings of the Palace of Numinous Aid. May the merit of this pinch of incense be dedicated to the supreme prayer for His Imperial Majesty, that the Dao may unite with Heaven and Earth, and his wisdom may shine like the sun and moon. May the jade chart of ten thousand generations remain firm, and the nine-tiered imperial repast be honored and secure. May rains be timely and winds harmonious, the people prosperous and creatures abundant; may the hundred officials be loyal and reverent, and all ranks just and incorrupt.

At the frontier, the dust settles, as shields and spears are stilled and martial might laid to rest. In villages and hamlets, virtue transforms, as plows and sowing return the people to farming. Perfect governance unfolds without striving, and the signs of Great Peace appear.

Thus we now burn incense, taking refuge in the virtue of the Perfected Lords, the Great Sages, and the host of perfected immortals. Since attaining the Dao, they have preserved Heaven’s enduring existence. *Harmonizing with the Dao, uniting with the Real.*

We, your servants, have heard that Heaven’s net is vast in its clarity, and the sun sets to rest. The fragrance of incense scatters like wind through the hall, while the moon of wisdom hangs in the mid-heaven.

On this evening audience, ascending the altar to perform the Dao, we, the assembly of ritualists, offer this third pinch of incense. *Harmonizing: May the incense reach the Palace of Numinous Aid, spreading through the palaces of the Nine Heavens to form a canopy of clouds, offering to the perfected immortals and sagely beings of the Palace of Numinous Aid.*

May the merit of this incense smoke be dedicated to the Vastly Beneficent Perfected Lords of the Nine Heavens’ Golden and Jade Gates and the host of perfected immortals and sagely beings of the Palace of Numinous Aid. We, your servants, take refuge in body, spirit, and life to the host of perfected immortals and sagely beings of the Palace of Numinous Aid. May the merit of this pinch of incense flow to the heir apparent, the imperial princes, the chief ministers and officials, the people of the realm, and all beings within the four seas.

We humbly pray that the first goodness of spring may melt away, and the six dusts disperse like clouds. May karmic obstructions and habitual tendencies dissolve, while vows and practices deepen through cultivation. May the two luminaries and five phases radiate auspicious light in brilliance; may the six palaces and hundred offices turn the wheel of propitious qi in harmony. May the jade body remain pure and balanced, and the golden branches flourish and multiply.

Thus we now burn incense, taking refuge in the virtue of the Perfected Lords, the Great Sages, and the host of perfected immortals. Since attaining the Dao, may they forever preserve eternal life. *Harmonizing with the Dao, uniting with the Real.*

*Chant the directions. Repent.*

**Threefold Invocation, Triple Bows, Reaffirming the Dharma-Seats**

We, the humble officiant [Name], together with all present at this altar, reverently and earnestly offer this solemn petition:

To the **Perfected Lords of the Golden Towers of the Nine Heavens, Vast Grace True Lords**; to the **Perfected Lords of the Jade Towers of the Nine Heavens, Vast Grace True Lords**; to the **host of perfected immortals and sacred assembly of the Palace of Numinous Aid**; and to all majestic spirits invoked in this rite—

We have heard that the **Dao** is most exalted, **virtue** most noble, their subtlety and wonder merging in wordless silence. Vast in transformation, sagely and numinous, their responsive resonance flows unseen, as if winged. Ninefold are the heavens, veiled in mystery; thrice daily do we reverently pray—profound within, boundless above.

We, your servants, heed the sacred edicts with reverence, diligently following the mystic model in our morning devotions. The altar is adorned with pine blossoms and lustral herbs, our minds racing to the Great Desert. We gaze upon the crimson banners and jade wheels, shimmering in the distant skies, our eyes fixed upon the layered heavens.

We revere the **Pure Capital**, yearning for the **Numinous Aid**. Beholding the defilements of the six dusts, we redouble our vigilance like ice. Tasting the profundity of the **Three Caverns**, we have long relied upon their cloud-like shelter. We humbly seek the guidance of those who have attained, entreating with unwavering sincerity.

May our highest prayers ascend:
That the **sacred lifespan** equal the heavens, the **imperial radiance** rival the sun.
May jade and silk flow from distant isles, and weapons of war be forever cleansed at the frontiers.
May blessings reach the heir’s palace, granting abundant peace and well-being; may grace extend to the vassal lords, uniting all in purity and honor.
May the counsels of loyal ministers shine ever brighter, and all people ascend to benevolence and longevity.
May the palace chambers know tranquility, and the **Dao’s** transformative power spread its light.

Thus shall the luminous teachings of the **True Lords’** great compassion be fulfilled above, and our devotion in taking refuge below be answered.

We respectfully present this petition.

**Twelve Vows, Visualizing the Spirit, Burning Incense**

**Incense Officials, Divine Envoys, Left and Right Spirit Lords, Attendant Incense Spirits**—may this place of our evening audience naturally birth golden elixirs, cinnabar mushrooms, and azure herbs. May the **hundred spirits and host of perfected ones** gather here before this incense burner.

May our sincere hearts shine through, the rite’s offerings be perfected. May the **jade maidens and immortal youths of the ten directions** attend the orchid-scented smoke, conveying our petition swiftly and directly to the **Perfected Lords of the Golden Towers of the Nine Heavens, Vast Grace True Lords**, and the **Perfected Lords of the Jade Towers of the Nine Heavens, Vast Grace True Lords**.
