**Golden Talisman Tenfold Recitation for Universal Salvation – Midday Circumambulation Ritual**

**Preface at the Master’s Hall:**

**Ritual Proceedings:**
The high-ranking officiant kneels and begins the invocation.

**Your humble servants,**
[Name], with sincere reverence, now humbly petition the **Venerable True Master of the Golden Talisman, the Mysterious Middle Dao**,
the **Venerable Master of the Golden Talisman Scripture**,
the **Venerable Master of the Register**,
the **Venerable Master of Salvation**,
the **Venerable True Master of the Orthodox Heavenly Dao**,
the **Venerable Master of the Female Lineage, the Successor of the Dao**,
the **Venerable True Master of the Golden Talisman, the Supervisor of the Ritual Fast**,
the **Venerable Master of the Opening of the Golden Talisman, the Lineage Teacher of the Transmission of the Millet Pearl Dao**.

With deepest respect, we gaze upon Your benevolent guidance and humbly await Your divine discernment.

**Your humble servants hear that:**
The **Primordial Beginning** (Yuanshi) opened the talismans,
and the **True Scriptures** (Zhenwen) established the teachings.
With these, one may **harmonize with Heaven and pacify Earth**,
**guard the nation and bring peace to the home**.
The salvific power is boundless—
this is known as the **Supreme Scripture**.

We now **ascend to Your sacred presence** (zài dēng shī què) and **petition for the sacred ritual scriptures**.

**Your humble servants** now, with earnest intent, lead the assembled officials
to ascend the platform and recite in circumambulation the *Supreme Scripture of the Mysterious Cavernous Golden Talisman for Universal Salvation, the Marvelous Scripture of the Highest Grade* (Taishang Tongxuan Lingbao Wuliang Duping Shangpin Miaojing), from the **fifth circumambulation** to the **eighth circumambulation**,
devoutly offering **prayers for the longevity of the Ten Thousand Ages** and **sustaining Heaven’s eternal existence**.

We **humbly beseech Your sacred creation** (shī zào),
to **specially grant us the sacred alliance** (zhǔ méng).
Thus, may the **echoes resound through the Three Heavens** (Sān Tiān),
and the **sound be heard in the Nine Earths** (Jiǔ Dì)."

「The benevolent waves flow boundlessly, the gracious blessings descend profoundly.
They universally encompass all living beings, equally nourishing their merits.
We now await Your sacred decree, to solemnly proclaim the scriptural rites.

Your servants, with reverence unmatched, dare to approach Your august presence,
our humble prayers exceeding all devotion.

We lead the assembly to ascend the platform,
and respectfully perform the prescribed rituals.
We chant the Dao, guiding them to the platform’s fore to stand in order,
then ascend in sequence, offering incense,
and bowing in faith—each paying homage to You,
keeping their thoughts pure as the Law commands.

The Taishang Xuan Yi, the Nine Sovereigns exhaling their essence,
the Three Five Seven transformations, their mysteries observed in the depths.
The sun and moon cast their radiance downward,
illuminating the divine court.
Their splendor shines across the Six Directions,
the Ta Yi Sovereign reigning in eternal peace.

The Celestial Lord’s golden palace, its golden scriptures unerring,
the Five Elders bearing talismans—Heaven and Earth together accomplished.
Granting me immortality, to attain the True Spirit,
repelling all ten thousand malevolences—calamities thus pacified.
Ascending to the Celestial Court, returning to youth and vigor,
the Great Emperor’s edicts, all hundred deities listening in reverence.
The Law-drum is struck twenty-four times.

The Supreme Xuan Yuan Taishang Dao Jun,
summons forth from Your servants the Three Five Seven officials and left-right messengers,
the golden boys attending incense, the jade maidens delivering words,
the Five Emperors’ direct talisman-holders and direct sun-moon incense officials—each thirty-two in number.

As You have commanded, we now, as certain [names],
with earnest intent, pray to receive the Taishang’s descent of the Ten Directions’ true *qi* and genuine essence,
flowing into our bodies, so that our petitions
may swiftly reach the Supreme Emperor of the Thirty-two Heavens, the Most Venerable Yuan Shi,
before the august throne.

We humbly request to be called to the Law-position.
Your servants, certain [names],
with utmost sincerity, now jointly petition the Taishang of the Supreme Way of the Boundless Dao,
the Natural and Spontaneous Yuan Shi Tian Zun, the Wondrously Void Emperor,
the Xuan Huang High Holy Taishang, the Jade Morn Supreme Dao Jun, the Spirit-Embracing Emperor,
the Xuan Yuan Old Lord of the Dao and Virtue, the Moral Emperor,
the Jade Emperor of the High Heaven,

the Emperor of the Southern Pole, the Purple River Grand Sovereign,
the Celestial Lord of the Red Star of Destiny,
the Earthly Sovereign of the After-Terra,
the Taishang Spirit-Embracing Emperor of the Boundless Dao,
the Great Saints who have attained the Dao,
the Most Venerable Lords of True Essence,
the Thirty-two Heavenly Emperors,
the Supreme Dao Jun of the Golden Palace in the Eastern Celestial Capital,
the Southern Pole, the Western Spirit, the Northern True,
the Supreme Dao Jun of the Boundless Dao in the Jade Capital,
the High Lord, the High Sovereign, the High Protector,
the Supreme High Holy Emperor of the Xuan Zhong,
the Thirty-six Departments of Sacred Scriptures,
the Supreme High Law-Master of the Xuan Zhong,
the Five Emperors and Three Officials,
the Four Ministries and Nine Offices,
the Five Celestial Bodies,
the Southern Celestial Star and Northern Dipper,
the Twenty-eight Constellations,
the Celestial Compasses and Jade Balance,
the Arrayed Celestial Symbols,
the Supreme True Gods of the Ten Directions,
the Flying Celestial God-Kings of Infinite Life,
the Celestial True Lords of Marvelous Deeds,

the Jade Boys Attending Scriptures,
the Three Caverns Attending Scriptures,
the Spirit-Embracing Officials,
the Five Emperors of the Three Realms,
the Great Merit-Mage Kings,
the Officials of the Three Realms,
and all responsive true spirits.

With reverence, we gaze upon Your boundless compassion,
and humbly pray for Your discerning gaze.

Your servants have heard:
The Five-Zhang Jewel Pearl is the supreme manifestation of the Emperor’s divine wisdom;
The Sacred Realm of the Ten Directions is the place where the *dharma-qi* (fán qì) transforms into the boundless.

We seek to borrow Your radiant light,
and entrust the propagation of the scriptural Law to Your boundless blessings.

Though my Dao-grade is yet unfulfilled,
how dare I undertake the great vehicle’s duty?
Yet by past karmic fortune,
I have heard of the Supreme Scripture’s teachings.

I pray that at noon court,
You may reopen the sacred treasury.
With awe for Your sacred spirit above,
I lay bare my sincerity to hear Your words first.

To reveal the hidden and clarify the profound,
we calculate the numbers five, six, seven, eight;
To be touched by the winds and transformed by the *qi*,
may my merit extend to the Gēn and Xùn directions of the Four Symbols.

With deepest obeisance, I take refuge in the Boundless Dao.
With utmost devotion, I take refuge in the Ten Directions’ scriptural treasures,
praying that all beings may open their hearts to enlightenment,
and receive, uphold, and recite them.

With utmost devotion, I take refuge in the Ten Directions’ Dao treasures,
praying that all beings may turn their minds toward the True,
and render all offerings in faith.

With utmost devotion, I take refuge in the Ten Directions’ Master treasures,
praying that all beings may universally ascend the Law-bridge,
encountering no obstacles.
