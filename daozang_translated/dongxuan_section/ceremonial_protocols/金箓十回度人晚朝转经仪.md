**"Ritual for the Ninth and Tenth Recitations of the *Jinlu* Ten-Cycle *Duguren* (Degree of Saving Beings) Evening Scripture Rotation**

**Preface to the Hall of the Master**

**High Functionary Kneeling and Reporting:**

Your devoted disciple, [Name], respectfully petitions the **Venerable True Lord of the *Lingbao* Mystic Middle Dao**, the **Lord of the *Lingbao* Scripture Master**, the **Lord of the Register Master**, the **Lord of the Degree Master**, the **Lord of the Celestial One Master**, the **Lord of the Female Master, Successor Master, and System Master**, the **Venerable True Lord of the *Lingbao* Supervising Fasting Master**, and the **One Who Shakes the Lineage—Lord of the *Chiming* Diagram and *Shu Zhu* Transmission**.

With deepest reverence, I humbly await Your Benevolent Guidance and Your Piercing Insight.

I have heard that the *Lingbao* Original Chapter encompasses the hidden melodies of a hundred demons, while the **Supreme Grade of Marvelous Initiation** unfolds the tenfold transformations of the Mystic Work. Now, this ritual is once again performed in the scriptural rites, relying entirely on Your Master’s creation.

Today, with sincere devotion, I lead the assembled officials in ascending the platform to recite the *Taishang Dongxuan Lingbao Wuliang Duguren Shangpin Miaojing* (The *Supreme Venerable’s Mystic Treasure Sutra of Infinite Salvation: Supreme Grade of Marvelous Initiation) from the **ninth to the tenth cycle**, in solemn prayer for the **Ten Thousand Years of Longevity** and the **Eternal Preservation of Heaven**.

All depends on Your Benevolent Oversight, presiding over this sacred assembly.

May the resonance pierce the **Three Heavens**, and the sound reach the **Nine Realms**."

「All beings share in the universal benefit. We await Your Benevolent Command and solemnly recite the scriptural rites. With deepest reverence, we dare not presume upon Your Master’s severity, nor can our humble prayers be adequately expressed.

We lead the assembled multitude to ascend the platform and respectfully perform the prescribed rituals. We chant the **Dao**, and guide the congregation to stand before the altar in order. Then, in sequence, we ascend the platform, offer incense, and each pay homage with sincere devotion to Your Master’s presence as per the ritual.

With **jade voice** capturing the **qi**, and **mystic wind** gathering the smoke, the **purple void** flourishes in splendor, aiding and supporting the **Ten Thousand Celestial Immortals**. In perfect harmony and unity, the ritual naturally attains its true essence. We strike the **law-drum** twenty-four times.

**The Supreme Dao/Way of the Primordial Origin, the Venerable Lord of the Supreme Grade, the Natural and Spontaneous Lord of the Beginning of the Dao/Way, the Supreme Lord of the Mystic Treasure and the Way of Marvelous Initiation, the Supreme Lord of the Miraculous and Manifest, the Lord of the Old Master of the **Primordial Chaos** and **Dao/Way of Transformation, the Jade Emperor of the Broad Heaven, the Benevolent Father of the Primordial Yang, the Jade Mother of the Mystic Treasure, the Celestial Sovereign of the Southern Pole, the Great Purple Emperor of the Northern Pole, the Lord of the Vermilion Mound who governs lifespan, the Earthly Sovereign of the Rear Soil, the Supreme Lord of the Mystic Treasure of the Ten Directions, the **Ten Thousand Years of Longevity** and the **Eternal Preservation of Heaven**—the **Ten Thousand Celestial Immortals** of the **Supreme Grade**, the **Supreme Saints** who have attained the Dao/Way, and all the Venerable Lords—**

**The Thirty-two Celestial Emperors of the Eastern Marvels, Southern Pole, Western Spirits, and Northern True Purities; the **Supreme Lord of the Golden Gate** and **Seven Treasures** in the **Jade Pivot Palace** of the **Purple Void Upper Court** of the Mystic Treasure, the **Supreme High Official** and **Supreme Grand Vizier**, the **Supreme Protector** and **Supreme Tutor**, the **Supreme High Lord of the Mystic Center**, the **Thirty-six Imperial Scriptures**, the **Supreme Grand Master** of the Mystic Center, the **Five Emperors** and **Three Officials**, the **Four Ministers** and **Nine Departments**, the **Sun, Moon, and Five Stars**, the **Southern Celestial Axis** and **Northern Dipper**, the **Twenty-eight Constellations**, the **Ruler of the **Xuanji** and **Jade Balance**, the **Celestial Immortals of the Stars and Symbols**, the **Ten Directions’ Supreme Saints of the Dao/Way**, the **Long-Lived, Boundless Degree of Salvation Lord of the Flying Celestial Ones**, the **Celestial Man of the Dao/Way** and the **Miraculous True Person of the Way**, the **Three Mystic Treasures**, the **Supreme Master of the Ritual Fast**, the **Five Emperors Attending the Scriptures**, the **Jade Boys and Jade Girls**, the **Jade Gentleman of the Scriptures**, the **Three Dao/Way Attendants of the Scriptures**, the **Mystic Treasure Officials**, the **Five Emperors of the Three Realms**, the **Great Magical King**, the **Three Realms’ Officials**, and all the **Responsive True Spirits**—**

We humbly gaze upon Your **Great Benevolence**, awaiting Your **Divine Discernment**. We have heard that the **emptiness and dharma** coalesce into sacred texts, though they transcend the **hidden and revealed** cycles of the **Dragon-Kang Effort***; and the **law-wheel** reveals its mysteries, encompassing the **universal harmonizing** of all existence.

Now, as we recite with our mouths and contemplate with our hearts, Your mercy surely extends to every utterance and response.

We, Your humble servants, **某** (name), are unworthy and insignificant. Yet, by the fortunate encounter of **karmic circumstances**, we have seized this opportunity to expound the scriptures.

On this auspicious night, we complete the **ritual cycles** once more. The division of **yin** and **yang**, the reckoning of numbers, has reached its fullness in the **odd and even pairs**; the **high and low**, the **vast and profound**, have been thoroughly illuminated by Your **Benevolent Grace**.

With deepest reverence, we prostrate ourselves and take refuge in the **Supreme Dao/Way of the Boundless**. With utmost sincerity, we take refuge in the **Ten Directions’ Scriptural Treasures**, praying that all beings may open their hearts to enlightenment and uphold, recite, and study these teachings.

With utmost sincerity, we take refuge in the **Ten Directions’ Dao/Way Treasures**, praying that all beings may turn their minds to **devotion** and render **sincere homage** to all.

With utmost sincerity, we take refuge in the **Ten Directions’ Master Treasures**, praying that all beings may ascend the **law-path** universally, encountering no obstacles.

**Praise of Past Lives**
We solemnly recite the scriptures: the **ninth cycle** opens the ritual rites. We sit in contemplation, reciting the **seated hymns**, and focus our minds as per the **law**.」

**Opening the Scriptural Mysteries and Turning the Dharma Wheel**

**Chant of the Opening Invocation**
*"Request the turning of the Dharma Wheel"*
**The Master Inscribes the Sutra**
*"Completion of the Recitation"*
**Hymn of the Dispersed Assembly**
*"Attending the Sutra’s Devotion"*
**Ode of Wisdom and Grace**

**The Master and the Ritual Officials Return to the Upper Realm**
*They offer incense and bow twice.*

With humble reverence, we present this **void-permeating, luminous verse**—
Crafted into **Nine Transformations**,
Its **cloud-borne resonance** piercing the **Ten Directions**.

With profound reverence, we honor the **Supreme Celestial Sovereign of the Boundless Dao/Way** in the Upper Realm,
The **Long-Living Great Sage, the Flight-Heaven Deva King of Infinite Salvation**.

Seated upon the **Circular Luo**, His **merits cover all**—
His **jewel-like brilliance** lets Him hear the **Golden Mouth’s exposition**,
His **lofty cloud-canopy** ever attends the **Jade Capital’s governance**.

We humbly pray for His **radiant descent** and **command of restorative power**—
May **yin-yang, cold-heat** find their balance, **no creature suffer blemish or plague**,
May the **sun, moon, and stars** shine in their proper order, **the land abound in auspicious omens**.

With **manifest decrees** in hand, we now **solemnly proclaim**.

**Proclamation of the Decree**
*Burning the Offering*

*"Attending the Sutra’s Proclamation,"*
**The Tenth Cycle Opens the Ritual Rites**
**Hymn of the Dispersed Assembly**
*"Request the Turning of the Dharma Wheel"*
**The Master Lifts the Sutra**
*"Hold the Thought as Initially Directed"*

The Dao speaks: *"In the beginning, the Azure Sky was vast and boundless, profound and mysterious."*

**Hymn of the Dissolution of the Seat**
*"Attending the Sutra’s Reverberation"*
**Hymn of Wisdom and Benevolence**
*"Turning to the Lower Realm,"*
**Offering Incense and Kneeling in Reverence,**
With utmost devotion, I now present the incense and recite the sutras—
From start to finish, ten full circuits completed.

I humbly pray for blessings and command,
With sincerity in my offering.

I reverently acknowledge the **Supreme Sovereign of the Boundless Lower Realm, the Most Sacred and Precious Heavenly Venerable**,
And the **Boundless Lower Realm’s Flying Celestial Deity-King, the Eternal Great Sage, the Infinite Liberator of Sentient Beings**.

His command encompasses the **Nine Encirclements**,
His light pervades the **Four Quadrants**.

To all **Great and Lesser Officials**,
They must surely receive His proclamation and **broadly disseminate His transformative teachings**;
And to universally liberate **heavenly and human beings**,
None can surpass the merit of **expounding the scriptures**.

I pray He bestow upon me His **final blessings**,
And grant me **pure felicity**.

I write and proclaim His deeds—
Not one record omitted, His **meritorious deeds clearly inscribed**;
Whether **colored or colorless**, none are excluded—
All are equally encompassed by His **unifying and balanced teachings**.

With the **proclamation text** in hand, I now **solemnly declare**:

**Proclamation of the Decree**
*Burning the Offering*

*"Attending the Sutra’s Proclamation,"*
**All praise the scriptural text**—
**Threefold Hearing of the Sutra**
*"The Master’s Hymn of Receipt"*
**Receiving the Sutra with the Dao attained**—
**Universal blessings for heavenly and human beings**.

The **Supreme and Profound Origin**,
With **boundless enlightened grace**.

I vow that **emperors and kings** may **preserve and uphold** their realms,
That **national fortunes** be **secure and tranquil**.

May **eternal joy and great peace** prevail,
And may all **long enjoy serene stillness**.

In unison, I **kneel and take refuge** in the **Boundless Dao**.

The Master **knocks the teeth three times**—thirty-six times in total—
And **kneels in homage to the Ten Directions** before retiring.

Facing east, with **heartfelt reverence**, I **bow three times**,
Closing my eyes, I **recite the secret mantra**:
*"I, [Name], have reverently recited the **Sutra of the Supreme Origin’s Liberating Sentient Beings in the Highest Grade**—
Ten full circuits now completed.

I beseech the **Celestial Dragon Palanquin** to descend,
That the **Heavenly Deities** may descend and manifest,
To command the **Six Celestial Stems**,
That the **Seven Ancestors** may ascend and soar,
And I may ascend to the **Highest Purity**."*

After the mantra concludes, the Master **knocks the teeth three times**,
And **swallows the saliva three times**.

Facing north, with **heartfelt reverence**, I **bow three times**,
Closing my eyes, I **recite the mantra**:
*"The **Supreme Sovereign of Heavenly Truth**,
Command me to ascend to the **Spiritual Realm**.*

With **pure fasting and ritual purification**,
I **recite and chant** the **Sacred Scriptures**.

The **Seven Mysteries** are revealed and dispersed,
I **ascend to the Highest Void** and **attend the Celestial Court**.

May my years be **prolonged** and my life **enduring**,
And may my name be **inscribed in the Record of Merit**."*

After the mantra concludes, the Master **knocks the teeth nine times**,
And **swallows the saliva ten times**.

**Returning the Officials as prescribed**—
Having recited the sutras to completion,
The **Thirty-five Functionaries of the Three and Five**,
The **Left and Right Attendants and Messengers**,
The **Golden Boys of Incense Service**,
The **Jade Girls of Transmission**,
The **Five Emperors of Direct Command and Direct Day Incense Officials**—
Each totaling **thirty-two**—

I now **request their return** into my body,
And **restore them** to their **palaces**.

May the **Mother Command** them to **alternate and intermingle**.
When summoned again, they shall **return as before**.

After the Master **concentrates and returns the Officials**,
He **knocks the teeth three times**,
And **swallows the saliva three times**.

**Making the Vow**—
The **Incense Furnace** is restored as originally.

**Summoning the Celestial Officials**—
The **Immortal Sovereigns and Celestial Officials**,
The **Golden Boys and Jade Girls**,
The **Five Emperors and Five Sacred Mountains’ Immortal Worthies**,
The **Three Qi’s Pure Deities**,
The **Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords**,
The **Heavenly and Earthly Immortals**,
The **Five Spirits of Incense Officials**—

I now **command them to summon** the **Rectified Qi of the Ten Directions**,
And naturally **generate** the **Golden Elixir**, **Lapis Lazuli**, **Ginseng, and Holy Fruits**.

The **Hundred Spirits and Multitudes of Worthies**,
Shall **congregate** here,
Before the **Incense Furnace**.

I vow that the **Golden Boys and Jade Girls of the Ten Directions**,
Shall **guard** the **incense smoke**,
And **transmit** the words I have **uttered** as before,
Swiftly reaching the **Supreme Sovereign of the Thirty-Second Heaven**, the **Primordial Emperor of the Highest Dao**, in His **Most Venerable Presence**.

**Before descending the altar**,
I **offer thanks** to the **Divine Kings**.

All the **Celestial Officials**,
I now **solemnly and sincerely** **pray** to the **Ten-Directional Boundless Flight Celestial Kings**, the **Great Saints of Longevity**, the **Infinite Degrees of Humanity**,
The **Ten-Directional Celestial Envoys**,
The **Jade Girls of the Ten Heavens**,
And all **Celestial Officials and Attendants of the Ten Directions**—

May they **behold** the **Great Mercy**,
And **respond** with **Piercing Clarity**.

I have **reverently received** the **Imperial Edicts**,
And **devoutly observed** the **Golden Talismans and Grand Fast**,
**Reciting** the *Supreme Scripture of the Dao/Way’s Mystic Treasures, Infinite Degrees of Humanity, and Highest Perfection* **ten times**,
And **hope** for **Divine Inspection and Verification**—
Fortunately, it has been **completed**.

I now **devoutly present** my **sincere vows**,
And **directly proffer** my **thanks**.

I **humbly reflect** that my **physique** is not **immortal**,
And my **corporeal form** is still **impure**.
To **declare** the **Cloud-Signs and Talismans**,
How could I **grasp** them with my **hands** or **heart**?
To **recite** the **Celestial Scriptures**,
Is merely to **speak** with my **mouth** and **hear** with my **ears**.

My **meditation** is **confused and erroneous**,
And my **chanting** is **hollow and discordant**.
I have **not yet attained** the **Mystic Insight of Piercing Clarity**,
Yet I **first invite** the **faults of carelessness and arrogance**.

I **pray** for **Spring’s Nurturing Grace**,
And **beg** for **Oceanic Tolerance**.
I **knock my teeth three times**,
And **swallow my saliva ten times**—
**Having recited the Talismanic Sutra to completion**,
I **humbly await** Your **Merciful Inspection**.

I **vow** that Your **Sacred Heart** be **broad and encompassing**,
And the **Cosmos** **embrace** the **Great Mercy**.
May You **not exact** the **punishment of the Axe and Cleaver**,
And **instead bestow** the **blessing of the Silk Canopy**.

Thus, the **teachings** shall **radiate** across the **world**,
And the **Dao’s grace** **shine** upon the **land**.

May the **assemblage of devotees** **sincerely** **deliver** this **vow**.

**Returning to the Altar**,
I **bow** before the **Curtain** and **take leave of the Master**.

The **Master** **presents incense** and **performs two prostrations**.

All the **Celestial Officials**,
I **once more** **sincerely** **pray** to the **True Lord of the Mystic Treasures’ Highest Dao**,
The **True Lords of the Mystic Treasures Scripture**, the **Scripture Master**, the **Master of Degrees**,
The **Supreme Lord of the Rectified Dao**,
The **Female, Successor, and System Masters**,
The **True Lord of the Mystic Treasures’ Grand Supervisor of the Fast**,
The **Opener of the Red Diagram** and the **Receptor of the Millet Pearl Transmission**—
The **One Lineage of Teachers**.

I **reverently** **behold** Your **Mercy**,
And **humble myself** in **gratitude**.

I **humbly** **acknowledge** that I have **frequently relied** upon Your **teachings**,
And **broadly proclaimed** Your **precious texts**.
I have **already been enlightened**,
And **fortunate** to **fulfill** the **completion**.

I **reverently approach** Your **steps**,
And **specially express** my **gratitude**.

I have **previously led** the **Celestial Officials**,
And **ascended the altar** to **recite** the *Supreme Scripture of the Dao/Way’s Mystic Treasures, Infinite Degrees of Humanity, and Highest Perfection* **from the Ninth to the Tenth Section**,
And **successfully fulfilled** the **completion**.

I **rely** upon Your **Grace**,
And **achieve** the **good intentions**.

I **directly exhaust** my **humble sincerity**,
And **pay homage** to the **Mystic Hall**.

I **once more reflect** that my **body** has **not yet penetrated** the **True Dao**,
So I **cannot fathom** the **Mystic Profoundness**;
My **learning** has **not reached** the **Dao**,
And I **am ashamed** not to have **attained** the **Pure Void**.

I **humbly pray** for **Great Compassion’s Grace**,
And **beg** for **Mystic Teachers’ Blessings**.
May You **look down** upon the **unworthy disciple**,
And **not condemn** him with **rebuke**.

Thus, my **family and nation** may **benefit** from Your **Grace**,
And **both the living and dead** **gain blessings**.

When **good deeds are perfected**,
The **rankings of merit** shall **take form**.
I **dare** not **violate** Your **strictures**—
My **lowly feelings** are **unutterably** **deep**.
I **gaze** upon the **Heavenly Steps**,
And **bow** with a **devoted heart**.

**Performing the Fast**—
The **Cloud-Carriage**.

**In past observances,**
I **recited** the *Golden Talisman Sutra* ten times,
**conducting** the **Evening Scripture Turning** for **deliverance of beings**,
**following** the **proper ritual etiquette**.
