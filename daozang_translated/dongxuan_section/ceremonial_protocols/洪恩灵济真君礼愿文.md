**Preface to the Vows to the Venerable Lord of Vast Grace and Numinous Aid**

Vows are the aspirations of the perfected, and also the aspirations of all people. Each kneel and bow is the focus of the heart; the focus of the heart is the utmost of goodness. The goodness of human nature is like water flowing downward. If one does not correct what is not good, this is my sorrow. These vows are thus established for those who would be good—how could they be mere words of aspiration?

Gazing upward at heaven, one obtains the number twenty-five. Looking downward to earth, one obtains the number thirty. Combined, they yield fifty-five. It is by this number that the vow is fulfilled, for without sharing in the work of heaven and earth, how could this be achieved? The good person is the guiding principle of heaven and earth. If there is even a trace of deceit, arrogance, or negligence, this is not what I call a vow. How could such a one be spoken of in the same breath as the good?

The *Tradition* says: "Goodness has no constant master; it harmonizes with those who achieve unity." There is no other reason for this—beginning with it, ending with it, never halting halfway, this is to be perfectly good and perfectly beautiful.

Goodness is the foundation of fortune; fortune is the accumulation of goodness. Gao Ying of the Tang said: "Accumulate goodness to attain fortune; do not expend wealth to seek fortune." Since fortune can be sought without expending wealth, can those who do good be said to expend wealth? Seeing goodness, one should point it out; hearing goodness, one should proclaim it. All who share this aspiration should thus encourage one another, that we may be without shame before heaven and earth, and also without shame before the Venerable Lord. This, too, is the great vow of the Venerable Lord.

**Rite and Vows to the Venerable Lord of Vast Grace and Numinous Aid**

Today, with reverence, we burn precious incense and offer sincere devotion to:
The Great Immortal of the Nine Heavens’ Golden Gate, who illuminates the Dao and manifests virtue, whose numinous power is vast and whose aid is universal, who dwells in the pure and mysterious, the empty and subtle, whose compassion and kindness protect the state and shelter the people—the Venerable Lord of Vast Grace;
The Supreme Immortal of the Nine Heavens’ Jade Gate, who proclaims transformation and upholds the teaching, whose numinous radiance is far-reaching and whose aid is abundant, who is lofty and serene, empty and profound, whose wondrous responses are benevolent, who assists the state and protects the people—the Venerable Lord of Vast Grace;
And all the divine officials and immortals of the Palace of Numinous Aid, to whom we offer our common devotion.

We have heard that the manifest virtue of the spirits is called uprightness and wisdom. The common desire of people is for peace and ease, for wealth and honor. If sacrifices must bring blessings, then the rites must not be too simple. For over four hundred years, the temple offerings have flourished; the incense fire burns as brightly as ever. The stele inscriptions number a thousand characters, and their compositions may still be heard. Their illustrious and imperishable names, their awe-inspiring and lifelike righteousness—these have preserved the altars of the state and bestowed virtue upon the living.

The farmer labors in the fields, and there is celebration of millet, rice, and grain. The artisan refines his craft, meeting the standards of plumb line, compass, and square. The scholar establishes himself through loyalty and filial piety; the merchant profits through benevolence and righteousness. Those who seek marriage find harmony in family and home; those who pray for descendants beget sons and grandsons. Wind and rain nourish the people, fulfilling the wishes of all life. Clothing and food sustain us, granting the kindness of warmth and fullness. Bestowed upon the myriad things, all is fitting; arranged through the four seasons, all is in order.

Gazing up to them is like beholding Mount Tai or the Northern Dipper—their radiance is vast. They do not abandon us in the distance; when they manifest, it is as light, as stars and clouds contending in splendor, a joy to behold first. They are fitting recipients of great rites, that their numinous power may be proclaimed.

In the past, they received the honor of imperial bestowal; today, they bear the favor of heaven’s grace. Their rank has ascended to the Golden and Jade Gates; their names have advanced to the Great and Supreme Immortals. Their honorific titles are exalted, their majesty resplendent; their sacrifices endure for a hundred generations, their example rectifies the myriad spirits. They walk with the great creators, ever ancient yet never aging.

I, so-and-so, though my heart yearns for the Dao, my talent does not compare to others. I humbly extend my private gratitude and offer a small token of respect. Having prepared this solemn Dharma assembly, I presumptuously invoke the true wisdom of the Venerable Lord.

I pray that the jade phoenix may sing *jiujiu*, that the eight dragons may coil and glide, that clouds and rainbows may lead the way, that the gates may open at the sound of your approach. First, let Fenglong advance as your vanguard; then, let Feilian hasten as your retinue. Bestow your beauty with ease, repay with serene longevity. Offer cassia wine and peppered libations, orchid mats and magnolia feasts. Roam freely and linger, look back with care and affection.

My humble devotion is boundless; I await your presence with reverence.

There is the Venerable Lord’s original vow and divine incantation, which I shall now recite with care:

*Venerable Lord, Venerable Lord, Great Spirit of the Northern Dipper.*
*Heaven and earth praise your transformation; sun and moon shine together.*
*Below, you govern Fengdu; above, you attend the imperial court.*
*Upholding the true Dharma, you slay and vanquish evil spirits.*
*Your numinous title, Lingji, brings fortune to the myriad people.*
*Those who seek are answered, as echo follows sound.*
*Those who feel are moved, as shadow follows form.*
*Those who oppose me perish; those who follow me live.*
*Om, Radiant Numinous One, Radiant Numinous One, universally aid the living.*
*Qianyuan,亨利贞, swiftly, swiftly, as the law commands.*
*Venerable Lord of Numinous Aid, descend swiftly.*

The virtue of cherishing life pervades the hearts of the people. Preserve my two *qi*: the fiery *yang* and the watery *yin*. Dissolve disasters, cross over calamities, bring fortune to the good and misfortune to the licentious.
*Swiftly, swiftly, as the law commands.*

*Venerable Lord, Venerable Lord, born of the Northern Dipper.*
*Acting on heaven’s behalf, you transform; assisting the state, you save the people.*
*Transmitting the true Dharma, you slay and vanquish evil spirits.*
*Demon kings guard you; true qi abides forever.*
*Swiftly, swiftly, as the law commands.*

The divine incantations have now been fully proclaimed. We respectfully invite:
The Sacred Father, the Loyal and Martial True Lord of Aid and Brightness, Prince Qi;
The Sacred Mother, the Benevolent and Longevous, Kind and Virtuous Immortal Consort;
The Two Venerable Lords of Numinous Aid, the Two Immortal Consorts;
Their divine processions to descend and join the assembly of the perfected, to array themselves in ranks and pay homage.

Having completed the homage, each ascends to their Dharma throne. With reverence, we set out the offerings and burn incense.

*Ode to the Incense*

We humbly submit that bright virtue, when offered, surpasses the fragrance of millet and grain; those who cultivate goodness share their scent with orchids and angelicas. This incense—jade censers present auspicious omens, golden tripods manifest felicity. Dense and abundant, it coalesces into clouds of mist and vapor; warm and radiant, it steeps the cosmos in spring. When held aloft, messengers stand before us; when attended, youths stand behind. In rites with libations, we bow in reverence and make offerings. In rites without, the first cup of wine is presented, this incense accompanying the chalice—let the Dharma assembly focus their minds and make offerings with devotion.

*Incense Verse*
In the heavens, clouds sow their seeds;
A mighty wind scatters them across the four seas.
Deep within the dragon palace’s secrets,
Sea spirits offer them to the immortals.
Now, fervently kindled with sincerity,
Its mist ascends to the Purple Palace.
Penetrating the boundless void,
All prayers are fulfilled as wished.

*Response:* Together, we make offerings with one heart.

*Scattering flowers.*
From the censer’s depths, smoke arises.
*Scattering flowers through the forest.*
The incense of the effortless Dao and virtue.
*Scattering flowers to fill the Dharma realm.*
Offerings before the True Lords.

*Ode to the Water*

We humbly submit: though turbid waters may be offered to lords and nobles, only loyalty and sincerity form their true essence. The source-water flows ceaselessly day and night, yet we blush at the excess of our own reputation. This water—neither muddied nor dim—remains ever clear, ever pure. In heaven it becomes rain and dew, caught upon bronze pillars and golden stalks; on earth it turns to sweet springs, savored like jade nectar. The wise act without pretense, and the highest good, like water, contends with none.

Its current never fails to flow east, yet its source lies in the north.

*With ritual present:* We bow our heads in reverent offering.
*Without ritual:* The second cup of wine is presented, this incense accompanying the chalice—let the Dharma assembly focus their minds and make offerings with devotion.

*Ode to the Water*
In heaven the Silver River overflows,
its limpid depths reflecting the ten directions.
Transformed into rain and dew it descends,
bestowing grace across heaven and earth.
Moistening what is withered, nourishing all life,
its bounty revives the parched and sustains the myriad beings.
Pouring forth, it expresses our deepest sorrow—
body and mind wholly purified.

*Response:* Together, we make offerings with one heart.

*Scattering flowers.*
The source flows not from earthly veins.
*Scattering flowers through the forest.*
It waters all from the celestial river.
*Scattering flowers to fill the Dharma realm.*
Offerings before the True Lords.

*Ode to the Flowers*
We humbly submit: layered emerald leaves cast their shade upon the limpid isles; jade blossoms flourish, giving rise to spirit in the courts of abundance. These flowers—fragrant in their very essence, their hues unbound by fixed form. The red lotus of the pool may suddenly turn jade-green; the white peony can be dyed golden. In the Palace of Broad Cold, a single cassia branch trails its shadow beneath the autumn moon; within the Wu-ling grotto, a thousand peach trees smile in the breath of spring. Though we long to pour forth the devotion of sunflowers, we offer but the modest tribute of repeated veneration.

*With ritual present:* We bow our heads in reverent offering.
*Without ritual:* The final cup of wine is presented, this incense accompanying the chalice—let the Dharma assembly focus their minds and make offerings with devotion.

*Ode to the Flowers*
Rare blossoms of the Dark Garden flourish,
their roots spreading through the ten directions.
Standing tall for eight hundred years,
their fragrance lingers in the dusty world.
Resplendent in the realm of radiant light,
a cascade of jeweled petals rains down.
Gathering the purest essence,
we now rise to make our offering.

*Response:* Together, we make offerings with one heart.

*Scattering flowers.*
Ten thousand flowers arise in offering.
*Scattering flowers through the forest.*
Dancing, they descend from heaven.
*Scattering flowers to fill the Dharma realm.*
Offerings before the True Lords.

We humbly submit: in roaming the spirit through the Dao, one sees without seeing, hears without hearing. Abiding in the Dao with spirit, one gazes ahead—suddenly behind. Concealment has no end, and names are not forced upon it. Since the dawn of the Red Clarity, when celestial scriptures first descended, and the Heavenly Perfected took up their brushes, human culture began to flourish. The Emperor Shun received it before the Terrace of Pastoral Virtue; the Yellow Emperor transmitted it upon Mount Emei. Some obtained it at Gourd Valley, fulfilling the wish of King Helü; others descended upon Bell Mountain, completing the work of Yu the Great. Through the transmission of these scriptures and teachings, we sentient beings awaken to understanding.

Thus, we reverently invoke:
The Nine Heavens’ Golden Portal, Illuminating Dao and Manifesting Virtue, Great Immortal of Resplendent Efficacy, Vast Salvation, Pure and Subtle, Cavernous and Mysterious, Marvelously Responsive, Compassionate and Benevolent, Protector of the Nation and Shelter of the People, Vastly Merciful True Lord;
The Nine Heavens’ Jade Portal, Proclaiming Transformation and Upholding the Teachings, Supreme Immortal of Radiant Efficacy, Vast Salvation, Lofty and Serene, Profound and Tranquil, Marvelously Responsive, Benevolent and Kind, Supporter of the Nation and Guardian of the People, Vastly Merciful True Lord.

Assisting the Dipper Perfected in the northern pole, inwardly participating in the mysteries of Eastern Florescence. Through a hundred million kalpas, kalpa after kalpa of cultivation; fifty-five vows, vow after vow fulfilled. Refining gold into phoenix-script, kneading jade into dragon-chapters. May all sentient beings together attain the supreme Dao.

The assembly of this Daoist sanctuary bows in reverence, pledging devotion and singing praises.

*In unison, we chant the True Lords’ Original Vows:*
Ascending the imperial throne, advancing upon the celestial steps.
Radiance companion to sun and moon, duties spanning the Three Terraces.
Constellations arrayed in guard, the Silver River shines in revolution.
The Dragon’s Horn in the east claims the Dipper’s head;
the Canopy and Chamber Steeds serve as strict attendants.
Feathered Forest generals escort left and right;
ocarinas and flutes play in turn, harmonizing with pitch-pipes.
Returning in glory to the celestial palace,
a journey of ten thousand leagues through the clouds.

Let all in this sanctuary rise, each offering reverent praise according to ritual.

With devoted hearts we bow and take refuge, proclaiming:
Virtue matching heaven and earth, merit equaling sun and moon,
mysterious efficacy of spiritual power, upright and enlightened.
Great compassion, great mercy, great sanctity, great vows—
responding to circumstances, pledged to deliver all beings:
The Nine Heavens’ Golden Portal, Illuminating Dao and Manifesting Virtue, Great Immortal of Resplendent Efficacy, Vast Salvation, Pure and Subtle, Cavernous and Mysterious, Marvelously Responsive, Compassionate and Benevolent, Protector of the Nation and Shelter of the People, Vastly Merciful True Lord.

The Dao, majestic and beyond naming,
the flourishing qi of the Nine Heavens belongs to the True Lords.
From ancient times to the present, without end,
a hundred thousand transformations, wondrously divine.

*Response:* Now we sing of their sacred virtues with reverence,
may their awe-inspiring radiance witness our sincerity.
May all sentient beings together take refuge in the supreme Dao.

One must know the debt of gratitude that cannot be repaid, yet follows the Way of due reverence,
Moreover, receiving the king’s decree, answering with civil and martial glory,
Establishing the state and founding the household, entrusted with the legacy of Yi and Zhou,
Whose merit secures the altars of the land, whose blessings extend to descendants,
Most sacred, most numinous, most venerable, most solemn—

With earnest teachings of ritual and propriety passed in the Hall of the Carp,
The inner assistance of family precepts is most strict.
Before the hall, learning the play of the patterned robe,
A thousand springs of longevity are wished, presented with rhinoceros cups.

Harmonizing the three clans, they receive Heaven’s emolument—
A thousand measures, even ten thousand measures,
Enfeoffed upon the land, first among those of the same surname, then among others,
Having humbly received the profound love of General Liu Hong,
And knowing the prudent virtue of Minister Fu of Zheng,
Their names weighty in their time, their rewards enduring through the ages—

Forever serving as the auspicious omen of this blessed land—
Most sacred, most numinous, free and unbound—
The Sacred Consorts of the Entire Hall.

Pearl-trimmed slippers and golden hairpins fill the palace courts,
Their bearing rich yet refined, virtuous and chaste.
Gathering duckweed from the pond, the affairs of lords and nobles,
Unlike the consorts of the Jia or the Guo, who brought ruin to the palace.

With devoted heart we bow and take refuge,
Within the Hall of Numinous Aid, in the Hall of Joyous Feasting,
The sun as spirit, the moon as soul,
Taiyi presides over the Register of Life,
Tianyi governs the Office of Birth,
The constellations store their essence, moved by Venus to enter dreams,
Mountains and rivers nurture brilliance, rejoicing in the descent of numen from Mount Song,
Bearing the celestial qilin,
All become marvels among mortals—
Most sacred, most numinous, responsive to every invocation—
Taiyi, Overseer of Life, Tianyi, Registrar of Birth, and all attendant consorts.

What auspicious dream heralds the joy of a son’s birth?
The numinous peak’s vital qi emits propitious light.

The lineage flourishes for ten thousand generations, thriving and prosperous.

With devoted heart we bow and take refuge,
In the Dragon-Headed Temple’s courtyard, the Sacred Realm of Ao Peak,
Their offices span the hundred ranks, their positions among the nine ministers,
Overseeing emolument as the authority of Wenchang,
Governing fortune as the sovereign of the Registrar of Birth,
Their teachings follow the *Hongfan*:
"Long life, wealth, health, and peace,"
Their praises offered in the *Biyong*:
"May they thrive, prosper, and reach venerable age,"
Every person rejoicing, every place blessed—
Most sacred, most numinous, responsive as echo to sound—
The True Lords and Sovereigns of Left and Right Fortune and Emolument.

The twin stars of Fortune and Emolument appear at the pivot of the Dipper,
Their offices to the left and right advance the worthy.
A family of accumulated goodness, known as gentlemen,
Sons and grandsons abound in blessings.

With devoted heart we bow and take refuge,
In the Dragon-Headed Temple’s courtyard, the Sacred Realm of Ao Peak,
Lightning flashes, clouds rise high,
Heaven speaks not, yet its voice thunders in wrath,
The earth’s bounty relies on rain and dew to nurture life,
Divine mechanisms operate in the unfathomable,
Wondrous transformations turn in the formless,
Grace descends upon the nine regions,
Blessings extend to all living beings—
Most sacred, most numinous, transforming and changing—
Lord Thunder, Mother Lightning, Earl Wind, Master Rain,
The Illustrious Dragon Kings of this temple,
The Earth Gods of the Five Directions,
The Rain-Bringing Dragon Spirits, and all others.

Dragons ride the clouds, their power assured,
Their voices shake the thunder for ten thousand miles.
The world’s people long for timely rain,
At once their fortunes rise, their horns emerge—

With devoted heart we bow and take refuge,
In the Sacred Realm of Ao Peak, the Dragon-Headed Temple’s courtyard,
Most sacred, most numinous, to the left and right,
Some present their jesting arts,
Others excel in the arts of the *guanlu*,
Those who oversee the kitchen wield the eight delicacies,
Those who direct music harmonize the six pitches,
The Sixteen Guardians of the Army, all born with the talents of generals,
The Three Hundred Cavalry, each destined for enfeoffment,
Their majesty and numen manifest,
Their images fierce and vivid—
Most sacred, most numinous, stern and protective—
All the numinous powers of the entire hall.

For their labors in stabilizing the state and enacting laws for the people,
Their incense and karmic ties enshrine them in the temple.
The renown of generals and ministers endures through the ages,
Their images praised for a thousand years, likened to the qilin.

The rites complete, each rises and kneels in devotion,
Sincerely repenting with reverence.
With devoted heart, body, spirit, and life, we take refuge
In the Nine Heavens’ True Lord of Numinous Aid and all the majestic immortals of the hall.

We humbly beseech the sacred compassion,
To bestow vast blessings and descend abundant grace.
Through this day’s solemn fast and devotion,
We sincerely take refuge and repent.
We have heard that misfortune and fortune have no fixed gate,
Only summoned by one’s own actions;
Omens of good and ill follow like shadows.
Good serves as the tally of evil,
Evil as the proof of good.
For those who do good,
The Five Phases support them, the Overseer of Fate befriends them.
For those who do evil,
Malevolent qi overwhelms them, baleful stars shine upon them.

Though Heaven’s net is hard to escape,
Yet all lies in the awakening of the human heart.

This day, we prostrate in reflection:
All sentient beings turn their hearts toward the Dao,
Their utmost sincerity moving the gods.
We bow in reverence before the True and All-Hearing,
First confessing our faults,
From past kalpas to this present life.
Ashamed of wrongs, we have acted perversely,
Turned from right to follow wrong,
Altered our nature to chase power,
Embraced deceit to exploit flaws.
In darkness and secrecy, we schemed with cunning,
In cruelty and savagery, we wrought harm.
Deluded by dreams, we wandered lost
In the fields of profit, fame, and cunning.
Killing, stealing, lust, and deceit—
We sank into the mire of greed, wrath, and delusion.
In great matters, we deceived Heaven and Earth;
In secret, we betrayed the gods.
We cursed the heat, railed against the cold,
Scolded the wind, reviled the rain.
Before the stars, we sought advantage;
Before the sun and moon, we bared ourselves.
We pointed at rainbows, swore by mountains and seas,
Defiled temples and shrines, polluted sacred precincts.
Unmindful of the wrongs of body, heart, mouth, and intent,
Unsettled in the roles of scholar, farmer, artisan, merchant.
We honored not the Three Treasures, nor practiced the Five Constants.
In serving others, we were disloyal;
In friendship, untrustworthy.
Toward parents, unfilial;
Toward lords, ungrateful.
Wealthy yet unkind,
Greedy yet unjust.
We called sacrifice futile,
Violence harmless.
Deemed reverence unworthy,
Words unworthy of fear.
We rebelled against superiors, stirred chaos,
Loved violence, hated poverty,
Slandered the loyal, bullied the weak.
We served public ends for private gain,
Exalted ourselves at others’ expense.
We incited lawsuits, sowed enmity,
Arrogant in self-regard, cruel in self-will.
Unclear in goodness, insincere in conduct.
Small resentments eroded the bond of father and son,
Neglect dissolved the love of brothers.
When customs decayed, we sang the *Gu Feng* in reproach;
When kin turned to hatred, we chanted the *Jiao Gong* in lament.
Now, knowing our sins have filled the measure,
We humbly face the merciful and repent.

Who among us is without fault?
Yet faults, once mended, bring trembling fear.
The gods accept no fixed offerings,
But respond to utmost sincerity—
Thus we offer our earnest, reverent devotion.

We pray the Most Benevolent grant protection,
The Great Dao show compassion,
Forgive our past transgressions,
Bestow future blessings.
Let all regions rejoice,
All lands receive grace.
May this day bring great peace,
Disasters cease, misfortunes end.
May every blessing arrive,
The old grow strong, the young vigorous.
Long have we revered the awe-inspiring power of your virtue,
Now we dedicate ourselves to works that aid the people.

With utmost sincerity, we bow our heads,
Twice prostrating to give thanks to the Two True Lords of Numinous Aid.
We perform the Triple Rite of Thanksgiving.

Disciples, with one heart, bow in reverence and thanks
To the True Lord of the Nine Heavens’ Golden Portal.
Disciples, with one heart, bow in reverence and thanks
To the True Lord of the Nine Heavens’ Jade Portal.
Disciples, with one heart, bow in reverence and thanks
To the Illustrious Father, True Lord of Supportive Brilliance.

The rites of thanksgiving complete,
Our repentance fully revealed,
We reverently follow the wondrous canon,
Daring to approach your numinous wisdom.
With sincere devotion, we lay bare our humble wishes.

We pray your sacred compassion deign to look upon us.

First, may the present emperor’s life be long,
His harmony and longevity matching Heaven’s—ten thousand, ten thousand springs.
Second, may ministers and officials enjoy rank and emolument,
Their blessings like wind and clouds—enduring for a thousand years of joy and prosperity.
Third, may scholars attain wealth and honor,
Their names rising to Heaven’s court as dukes and ministers.
Fourth, may farmers diligently till the soil,
From this year onward, year after year, rejoicing in triple harvests.
Fifth, may all artisans perfect their crafts,
Awaiting summons to the Golden Gate to hear the jade decree.
Sixth, may the path to wealth be great,
Comparable to the lords of a thousand households.
Seventh, may wind and rain be timely,
All under Heaven celebrating universal peace.
Eighth, may incense and offerings ever flourish,
The temple’s majesty and numinous power enduring for a thousand years.
Ninth, may the Nine Heavens bestow their mandate,
Jade pendants chiming as we approach the Purple Court.
Tenth, may all faithful and good in the ten directions
Turn to the Three Treasures with utmost devotion.

The above hymn of praise and rites now complete,
The merit and virtue fulfilled.

All in the ritual assembly, each with reverence, speak again:
We have heard that with trembling caution,
We shame ourselves for our repeated offenses.
In awe of your radiant majesty,
We behold your numinous presence close at hand.
Grateful in heart, we bow and declare:
Your virtue shines forth—manifest and luminous,
Your merit extends boundlessly, aiding all.
You are the bridge across the sea of suffering,
The sun and moon guiding the lost.

Today, we reverently follow the sacred decree,
Conducting this ritual of gratitude and prayer for blessings.
We face your true wisdom, proclaiming your wondrous example.
With the devotion of triple ablutions and triple incense,
We dare to offer our gaze and our reverence.
May the impartial gods see our sincerity,
Washing away the sins of past kalpas and this life,
That we may plant the seeds of present and future karma.
With beginning and end, without evil or song,
What can be grasped, the foolish cannot reach;
Yet the gods transform, and the people are rightly guided.
When merit is complete and deeds perfected,
We may ascend to the Jade Chamber and Cinnabar Terrace.
When qi abides and spirit is upright,
We may open the brocade pouch of the Purple Sun.
May all faithful men and women attain long life,
Countless generations of ancestors be delivered.
Extending even to the departed in darkness,
All may return to the vast Mahayana.
For these supreme causes, we earnestly invoke:
The Heaven-Blessed Honored Lord of the Nine Heavens,
The Ten-Thousand-Fortunes-Protecting-Body Honored Lord,
The Heaven-Invoked-Fruit-Attaining Honored Lord.
Together: Inconceivable merit and virtue.

The *Ritual Text of Offering and Prayer to the Numinous Aid True Lord* is now complete.
