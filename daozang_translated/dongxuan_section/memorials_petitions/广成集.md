**Memorial Substituting for Minister Tao Fu on the Restoration of the Jin River Mouth Transcendence Sanctuary and Request for Its Name Plaque**

Your subject humbly states: The Jin River Mouth Transcendence Sanctuary is the eighteenth of the Twenty-Four Transcendence Sites, its seasonal node aligned with Lesser Fullness and its stellar correspondence with the Net Star. Traces of Chen Anshi’s ascension to heaven in broad daylight remain, as do the chariot tracks of the Lady of Bao, who attained the Dao. Each spring and autumn, by imperial decree, prayers and offerings are conducted here. Yet since the recent wars, all has been ravaged. The ancient halls stand empty, the altars bare, with only their foundations left. The sacred images and visages of immortals lie hidden beneath brambles and weeds. Pilgrims no longer come to pay reverence, and officials and commoners alike have no refuge for devotion. Who could have foreseen that this blessed site would fall into such desolation?

Your subject has undertaken its restoration, wishing to contribute to the sacred longevity of Your Majesty. I humbly recall that Your Majesty, heir to the numinous origins of the Xuanyuan Emperor and the immortal lineage of Mount Gou, succeeds Heaven in ruling the realm, governing the people through the Dao. The myriad lands bask in the vastness of your compassion, and the Three Teachings are renewed by your grace. The fields of magic mushrooms and the gardens of immortals all benefit from your solemn devotion. Even ancient temples and Confucian halls have received your restorative care. How much more, then, should this sanctuary of the Everlasting Life Teachings be honored with reverent repair?

Thus, I have cleared the overgrowth, rebuilt the halls and chambers, spared the sacred images from exposure, and enabled the faithful to resume their rites of burning incense and offering prayers. The distant traces of transcendence are once more a place of sublime cultivation. Lamps and incense now have their proper place, and the rituals of purification and offering suffer no lack. I have also summoned the Daoist masters Yang Xuanjing, Dugu Zhiyuan, and He [given name omitted], who have taken up residence at the sanctuary.

Yet, as the desolation endured for so long, the gate plaque has been entirely lost. I dare to beseech the favor of your beneficent grace, that this realm of gods and immortals may be specially adorned.

May I humbly beseech Your Sacred Grace to graciously bestow, in accordance with the former name of this sanctuary, a plaque inscribed with the august title "Shengshou." Permit this humble servant to craft and hang it, that the silver characters on jade tablets may forever bask in the radiance of sun and moon, and the immortal mountains beside the Han River may eternally celebrate Your Sagely Longevity. This servant is overwhelmed with gratitude.

**Memorial of Thanks for the Restoration of the Golden Register Daoist Ritual at the New Hall**

Your servant humbly reports: By imperial decree, I, together with Right Street Ritual Master He Chonghui and twenty-one others, conducted a seven-day Golden Register Daoist ritual within the new hall, commencing on the fourteenth day of this month and concluding on the twentieth. Palace Attendant Yang Shaoye performed the scheduled rites of obeisance, and the memorial of merit and praise has now been duly submitted.

I reflect that Heaven has blessed Your Sagely Work, renewing the grandeur of the imperial palace. Its jade terraces and vermilion gates surpass the palaces of the Three Isles, while its azure portals and cinnabar doors transcend the phoenix towers of the Nine Heavens. It embodies the splendor of the imperial residence and the solemn majesty of the Son of Heaven’s abode. All nations gaze in reverence, and a thousand spirits stand guard in awe. Scarcely had the construction of this jeweled palace been completed when the altar of the Golden Register was first established. Every detail was meticulously renewed, and each act of devotion was marked by profound purity. The fragrance of dragon incense ascended, and it seemed as though ten thousand sages had descended; the glow of the toad moon shone low, and it appeared as though a thousand perfected beings had gathered. May Your Sagely Lifespan be extended, and may the imperial realm endure forever.

Your humble servant, bowing in reverence, offers words of praise to the chief ministers, his heart filled with devotion and prayer. Auspicious omens have duly converged, and boundless blessings have been bestowed. May the great treasure of the throne flourish for a thousand springs, uniting the eight directions under one rule. We, your servants, have been favored with appointment to the sacred teachings and have taken part in these rites of devotion. We have feasted on jade delicacies from the celestial kitchens and trodden the cloud-paved courtyards of the immortal realm. Our honor is already beyond measure, yet further imperial gifts have been bestowed. We humbly acknowledge the gracious bestowal of supplementary funds, silver vessels, and bolts of silk—favors as deep as the vast ocean and as weighty as Mount Song. How can one as insignificant as a crane or swallow repay such sagely rewards? This servant is overwhelmed with gratitude.

**Memorial of Thanks for Appointment as Vice Minister of the Ministry of Revenue, with Additional Rank and Title**

Your servant humbly reports: By imperial grace, I have been appointed Grand Master for Splendid Happiness, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Revenue, Supreme Pillar of State, Duke of Cai, and Master of Broad Achievement. The warmth of Your Sagely Benevolence shines forth like spring, and the imperial brush has bestowed its radiance. Overwhelmed by such honor, I can scarcely comprehend its magnitude; burdened by such favor, I know not how to respond. Your servant offers his deepest gratitude.

I have heard that when a sagely ruler sits upon the throne, he must appoint the capable to office. When the worthy and good serve in government, they must exert their utmost. Those who ascend the ranks must embody the Dao; those who govern must be adept at adapting to change. Above, they must possess the ability to assist their ruler; below, they must fulfill the duties of a minister. Having found their proper place, they must apply themselves to the needs of the times. If they fail to benefit the people, they will surely incur the reproach of seeking mere favor.

As for your servant—obscure and timid—I have been honored to serve under such a radiant reign. Yet, looking inward, I see only my mediocre talents and dare not presume upon such extraordinary favor. I reflect that Your Majesty, in inaugurating this era and assuming the throne, has embraced the mandate of Heaven. Your wisdom outshines the twin luminaries, and Your virtue harmonizes with the vastness of Heaven and Earth. You have swept away the mists of corruption and revived the world. Your achievements have united all things in common purpose, and Your transformative influence has brought the eight directions under Your sway. Dreams have bridged the chasms of mountains and valleys, and Your ministers have answered the call of destiny; the mists and waves of distant lands have turned in admiration, and Your aides have fulfilled the omens of loyalty. The great pillars of state, steadfast in their support, hold aloft the sun and prop up the heavens. Heroes of the age, they are as stars descended from the heavens and peaks risen from the earth. The Eastern Palace aids in governance, and the sun and moon shine with renewed brilliance; the Southern Palace stands firm in loyalty, and the pillars of the realm are strengthened.

Your servant, a lowly being from rivers and lakes, possesses but modest talents. As a scholar, I have failed to achieve the heights of the unicorn; as a Daoist, I have been content to sketch the tiger. Moreover, I have been absent from court for many years, serving Your Majesty from afar. Though I have received no favors from mountains and streams, I have often been moved by the encounters of wind and cloud. For over thirty years, I have dwelled in seclusion, nurtured by Your light. The favors bestowed upon me are as weighty as Mount Song and as deep as the vast seas. You have transformed withered roots into lush grass and raised broken bones into robust flesh. Yet, though I call this a wondrous achievement, it scarcely compares to Your sagely rewards.

Thus, I prostrate myself in earnest supplication, my gratitude accumulating before Your Imperial Benevolence. Day and night, my spirit is stirred, and my shadow startles me. I have not repaid even a hair’s worth of Your kindness, yet my heart overflows with awe and trepidation. Now, at the dawn of this new era and the beginning of Your reign, You have bestowed upon me the elegant title of "Master of Broad Achievement," akin to the illustrious ranks of the Northern Bureau. I am unworthy of the discourse on serving the state with one’s person. How can I, who have failed to offer counsel at Your knee or present ideas to ease Your heart, presume to occupy such an exalted position? To covet further honors beyond my rank would be the height of greed. How could I dare to tread upon such extraordinary favor, ascending the ranks of the pure and distinguished? You have bestowed upon me a title as resplendent as the azure heavens and gathered my flawed being into the gates of mystery.

Yet, even in the Han dynasty, Dongfang Shuo was celebrated, and in the Jin, Pei Kai of Zhichuan was honored. Never before has one been granted consecutive appointments to such esteemed offices or twice bestowed with such exceptional ranks. Weighing my worth, I am filled with trepidation, torn between advancing and retreating. Facing Your Imperial Majesty, I have no means to decline. I can only vow to steel myself with diligence and forever repay Your boundless grace. This servant is overwhelmed with gratitude.

**Memorial of Thanks for the Imperial Decree Exempting This Servant from Joining the Two Teachings in Processions for Court Celebrations**

Your servant humbly reports: By Your Sagely Grace, it has been decreed that whenever court celebrations or congratulatory audiences arise, I shall no longer stand in the same rank as the Daoist and Buddhist clergy but shall instead be summoned alone for private audience, apart from the general assembly. Such exceptional courtesy transcends customary norms. The praise originates from Your Sagely Heart, and the honor uniquely illuminates the realm of the Dao. The weight of this favor is more than I can bear.

Your servant is both honored and awestruck, bowing his head again and again.

I reflect that Your Majesty, in Your divine wisdom, has inherited the mandate of Heaven and wields the symbols of imperial authority. You encompass Heaven and Earth in Your embrace and suspend the sun and moon to illuminate all below. The brilliance of Your golden mirror leaves no darkness unexposed, and the harmony of Your jade candle nurtures all things in spring. Thus, dew descends from the roots of Heaven, and Your grace flows across the face of the earth. You have pacified the realm through martial prowess, subduing the rebellious and instilling awe in the wicked; You have cultivated civil virtue to tame the distant and transform the treacherous. Even the nomads of felt tents and the dwellers of ice caves have come to court, offering tribute and observing the winds of change.

The realm settled, music arises; achievements complete, rites proceed. You have raised the fallen norms of the Three Dynasties and revived the lost canons of a hundred kings. There is renewal and reform, without faction or bias.

When the lords of the land assemble to pay court, You govern with ease, Your robes hanging loose, attended by ministers as stalwart as the Three Heroes and Ten Worthies, surpassing even the sagely talents of Feixiong and Shenxiang. The splendor of culture and ritual outshines past and present alike.

Some, clad in cloud-patterned robes and feathered garments, gaze toward the vermilion steps and raise their voices in homage; others, barefoot in square-cut robes, stand in the vermilion court and offer solemn blessings. At such times, this humble minister, though but a traveler in the ranks, has been permitted to approach the cloud-like steps, ever astonished at his own insignificance—like a mere ravine or gorge—yet finding himself lifted above the mist and clouds.

Now, Your sagely favor has been lavished anew, transforming all former observances. Though my humble person has been privileged to don the cap and sash of office and to enjoy the emoluments of a pure and elevated rank—my talents first employed in the northern ministry’s illustrious service, then transferred to the southern bureau—You have, in this moment of audience, singled me out from among the ranks of black-robed and yellow-clad officials, granting me a private summons to display Your boundless grace.

In former times, the Wei honored Jian’s reverence for Liang’s purity, and the Han praised Manqian while Qin lauded Ziping; yet even then, no new forms of ritual were devised, and courtly decorum adhered to established norms. Now, however, You have bestowed a mandate bright as the nine heavens and established a grand design for ten thousand generations. In quiet reflection, I am overwhelmed by awe; in my frailty and insignificance, how can I bear the grace of Your rain and dew? I can only strive to offer my utmost sincerity in eternal repayment of Your vast beneficence.

This unworthy minister is utterly overwhelmed.

**Memorial of Thanks for the Privilege of Private Audience, Ordered to Be Entered into the National Histories**

Your servant humbly states: By Your sagely grace, I have been specially favored with a private audience, exempted from the general summons. Moreover, my memorial of thanks has been ordered to be entered into the Histories. From the depths of Your imperial regard, this extraordinary courtesy has been extended, and my gratitude shall be forever recorded in the annals of truth, bearing witness to Your boundless favor. Overwhelmed by such honor, I am at a loss.

I prostrate myself in gratitude, reflecting that Your Majesty, in Your great wisdom, governs the realm, proclaiming sagely achievements. You have expanded the embrace of Heaven and Earth with martial grace and spread the radiance of sun and moon to illuminate all. The worthy and good have come to assist You, and the court abounds with ministers of exceptional talent. The Hua and Yi alike submit to Your benevolence, and the treasuries overflow with tribute from distant lands. All peoples enjoy prosperity and longevity, and without exertion, the realm approaches the harmony of Huaxu.

Thus, the palaces of Penglai and the halls of Zhi are all aglow with splendor; the sacred groves and imperial gardens are adorned with solemn magnificence. The Four Spirits manifest their auspicious forms, and the Six Qi harmonize in timely accord, bearing witness to Your blessings. The profound and the learned flourish, and the black-robed and brown-clad rejoice together. Though I am but an ordinary man, I have been blessed to encounter this glorious era, my name recorded among the honored and my office twice elevated to exalted rank.

Yet You have further distinguished me with singular favor, granting me a private audience. Amid the ranks of black-robed and yellow-clad officials, I received the summons and ascended directly to the heavens; in the court of the mandarin ducks and egrets, I glanced at my shadow and wondered if wings had sprouted upon me.

Now, this honor has been inscribed in the national histories, proclaimed throughout the realm—a grace beyond all precedent, forever enshrined in imperishable records. My long-standing dullness and insignificance cannot withstand the depth of Your rain and dew; my meager worth, like the smallest blade of grass, can never repay the virtue of Heaven and Earth. I can only devote myself to diligent service in reverent response to Your sagely wisdom.

This unworthy minister is utterly overwhelmed.

**Memorial in Celebration of the Yellow Clouds**

Your Majesty,

I, your humble servant, have observed the memorial submitted by Minister of Rites Zhao Wen-gui, reporting that on the twenty-third day of this month, as Your Imperial Majesty graced the De Xian Tower to inspect the troops, the Crown Prince returned from reviewing the cavalry encampment south of the city and entered the gates. At the hour of *you*, two golden clouds appeared above the city walls, shaped like canopies of blossoms, lingering before transforming into a purple hue.

I humbly note that at the birth of Emperor Yao, golden clouds descended in shelter; during the reign of Emperor Shun, golden clouds congealed in the heavens. Moreover, when Emperor Xuan of Han visited the Ganquan Palace, purple clouds entered the hall; when Emperor Taizu of Song ascended the throne, purple clouds manifested at the Gate of Uprightness. The Yellow Emperor had auspicious clouds by which he ordered his officials. Now, as virtue stirs Heaven’s favor, propitious clouds appear in the skies. Both Hua and Yi gaze in reverence; seas and mountains join in celebration.

I, your servant, offer my deepest congratulations. Your Majesty embodies the Dao and wields the Mandate, divinely endowed with sagely wisdom. Your benevolence embraces all living things; your grace extends across the earth. You pacify distant lands with civil brilliance and subdue fierce foes with martial prowess. As the Central Plains remain unsettled and all things restless, you have resolved to restore order and relieve the suffering of the people. Your commands have crushed the southern rebels like serpents; your campaigns have swept away the northern dust like smoke. Iron axles and dragon-prowed ships gleam upon the waters; frost-edged spears and snow-bright halberds march upon the land. Mountains and rivers tremble at your might; thunder and lightning hasten at your call. With boundless magnanimity, you expand the realm of Heaven and Earth.

Thus, you have entrusted the Crown Prince with the training of the Six Armies and the enforcement of the Three Commands. Warriors in chariots and armored ranks soar with valor; men of titanic strength blaze with courage bright as the sun. All stand firm as metal and stone, their loyalty unshaken. Truly in accord with Heaven’s will, the divine favor has manifested: twin clouds arose in majestic splendor, their forms coalescing like golden branches and jade leaves. High above the imperial throne, they deepened to purple, resembling blossoms in full bloom, descending to embrace the royal city. First assuming the guise of a cauldron’s shade, they gradually took on the hue of a frontier pass—clear signs that the vault of Heaven applauds your virtue, now ascendant. This surpasses the omens of Yao and Shun, exceeds the portents of Han Xuan and Song Taizu. Henceforth, the eight wilds shall submit as guests, and the myriad lands shall share a single path. May your sagely years stretch into the thousands and millions; may your grand foundation stand eternal and unshaken.

I, your servant, have been deeply favored by your wisdom and twice witnessed these wondrous signs. Dare I compose verse to express my sincerity and offer song to extol your sagely virtue? I humbly present a poem in tribute.

**Memorial in Celebration of the White Magpie**

I have further observed that Li Yan-tao, a commoner of Chongshan Village in Duogong District of Yandao County, captured a white magpie from a nanmu tree and presented it as tribute. The Five Phases reveal their auspiciousness, heralding the flourishing of the Metal Cycle; all officials gaze in unison, celebrating the celestial bounty bestowed upon the Jade Capital.

I, your servant, offer my most sincere congratulations. I have heard that when a true king rectifies names and establishes teachings, he embodies Heaven’s will, curbs cruelty and eliminates slaughter, thus comforting the hearts of the people. Then do rare trees and precious birds appear, coming to pay court at the palace gates—frost-touched feathers stirring with color, deep-blue talons marking their marvel. Folding their wings to display their form, they put to shame the vain boasts of Han and Wei; transmitting their cries to convey joy, they soar in homage to Your August Brilliance.

I humbly reflect that Your Majesty’s auspicious signs surpass those of all former kings, your achievements transcend those of the Three Antiquities. In harmonious sequence, winds and rains follow the measures of Yu; dispelling darkness, your mirror-like wisdom fills the halls of Xuantai. Nurturing all within the Four Seas, you have twice established the foundation of Heaven and Earth; illuminating the lands below, you have renewed the radiance of sun and moon. You have outshone the feeble Han, whose people rested their shoulders, and surpassed the contented Tang, whose people drummed their bellies. The people sing of abundant harvests; all things rely on the peace of the times.

Moreover, your legions—tens of thousands of fierce warriors, thousands of encampments gleaming with armor—capture the wicked and eradicate corruption, shelter the weak and nurture the orphaned. Thunderous rolls of war drums advance; clouds darken with the unfurling of banners. At your commands, the bold and mighty leap to action; through your grace, the weary and afflicted revive. The Five Planets move in their courses to bestow blessings; the Eight Seas submit to your influence and calm their waves. Thus do mountains and rivers offer their felicity, and birds and beasts present their omens.

Far from their nests upon the sea, they come to face the palace amid the clouds. Behold them in their jade cages, their snowy forms revealed at a glance. Unstartled, they do not circle the imperial gardens in flight, but before your celestial benevolence, they dance with joy. Coming and going along the jade steps, perching beside the beaded curtains, their pure white plumage is hard to distinguish, yet their new songs sound familiar. They are no companions for bridge-building magpies, nor are they part of flocks circling trees. Having manifested their snowy-white beauty, they truly herald the flourishing of the Metal Cycle.

I await the day when weapons are laid down and treachery is eradicated. The smoke and beacons of the battlefield shall be swept away, forever returning to the North Star; the brambles and thorns of the realm shall be stilled, pacified from the West. Truly, you surpass the might of Wei’s virtue and eclipse the achievements of Han’s prosperity.

I, your servant, have been blessed to witness this flourishing era and repeatedly behold these wondrous signs. Thus, I dare to present verses of song and praise, humbly offering them for Your Sagely Inspection.

I further humbly submit a poem in celebration of your sagely virtue and the auspicious omen.

**Memorial in Celebration of the Auspicious Grain Presented by Tianzhen Army**

I, your servant, have observed that Cui Shan, Acting Military Commissioner of Tianzhen Army, has presented a depiction of double-eared grain offered by Wang Youtian, a commoner of Shehong County. Your sagely virtue reaches far, and auspicious signs arrive in succession. Civil and military officials gaze upon them in awe; all within and beyond the realm rejoice.

I, your servant, have consulted the Auspicious Omens Record, which states: "Auspicious grain is a most excellent omen. In years of abundance, when the ruler’s virtue extends to the earth, two stalks grow from a single root." In ancient times, Tang Shu obtained such grain, with different fields bearing identical ears. King Cheng asked the Duke of Zhou: "Does two ears on one stalk signify that all under Heaven is in harmony?" The king commanded Tang Shu to compose the *Ode to Auspicious Grain*. Thereafter, the Nine Lands were united, the Eight Directions submitted, tribute of mastiffs came from the west, and pheasants arrived from the south. For thirty generations, the grand foundation endured; for seven hundred years, the great enterprise flourished—outshining the Xia and eclipsing the Shang.

Now, in this sagely and enlightened age, such an omen has again appeared. I humbly reflect that Your Majesty has inherited the sacred lineage of the Xuanyuan Emperor and carries forward the great source of the Zhou sovereigns. Aligned with the Mandate of Heaven, you unite Hua and Yi as one, ruling like the Thearch. In reverence and frugality, you have renounced the pleasures of music and wine; in sagacity and divine insight, you possess the clarity of keen sight and sharp hearing. Spreading martial virtue, you first punish those who defy the law, sweeping away treacherous rebels like lightning; disseminating civil culture, you swiftly pacify the Rong and Qiang, who come bearing tribute like clouds. You labor with concern for the people’s welfare, pitying the toil of farmers. Year after year, harvests are bountiful; fields know neither drought nor flood.

Your virtue reaches the earth, manifesting in the shared bloom of two stalks; your resonance with Heaven is revealed in the identical ears from different fields. This fulfills the omen of the sagely ancestors and heralds the Zhou’s auspicious grain; it signifies our sovereign’s expansion of the realm. In the past, harmony united Heaven and Earth as one; now, your embrace encompasses all lands in a single realm. Moreover, as the royal armies prepare for punitive campaigns, swearing to relieve the people’s suffering, your awe-inspiring might has already cowed distant lands, and auspicious signs first appear in nearby regions. We await the restoration of peace, the eternal dispelling of miasmic turmoil. You shall reveal the radiance of sun and moon across the Nine Heavens, fulfilling the Zhou’s divinations; you shall unite the hopes of all living beings across the Four Seas, matching the Tang’s auspicious grain.

I, your servant, gazing upon the Auspicious Omens Record, join in singing of your sagely influence. I wish to be included in the annals of those who gather poems, aspiring to follow in the footsteps of Tang Shu’s ode. I humbly submit a poem in praise of your sagely virtue and the double-eared grain.

**Memorial Requesting That the Imperial Carriage Not Proceed to the Northern Army Front**

I, your servant, have received the imperial decree that the imperial carriage shall proceed to the northern army front.

Your servant has heard that the inspection of righteous deeds and the review of meritorious service are enduring rites handed down in the ritual classics, while the punitive expedition against rebels and the suppression of traitors are universal norms of statecraft. Such measures aim to extend radiant illumination to every region and to gather the five auspicious omens from the feudal lords. They serve to eradicate violence and disorder, bringing solace to the suffering masses. Yet the rebellious tribes of Bin and Qi, long deluded and estranged from the Great Norm, shall soon—indeed, within days—witness their annihilation. There is no need for Your Imperial Carriage to personally advance upon the war chariot, venturing afar to the lair of cunning foes. The earnest pleas of the multitude, united in their apprehension, give rise to widespread alarm and doubt.

I humbly reflect that Your Majesty surpasses the luminous virtue of Shun and transcends the divine martial prowess of the Zhou kings. You wield the commanding severity of autumn frost while bestowing the nurturing breath of spring’s renewal. Entrusting all to perfect impartiality and extending boundless sincerity, your transforming influence sweeps across the realm like wind bending grass. Yet in the lands of Long and Wei, among the customs of Qian and Qi, the people have grown accustomed to the harsh qi of frigid valleys, forsaking the warmth of yang; they have embraced the yin of foul waters, shunning the solitary radiance of your illumination. Relying on anthill-like fortifications for false security, they nest in tented encampments, clinging to fleeting peace.

Now, with your supreme generals leading the expedition and your mighty armies pressing the assault, your celestial strategies shall surely sever the roots of rebellion. I privately consider that the roads of Hanqu and Baochuan, now gripped by winter’s chill, present perilous paths where frost and snow render the treacherous passes nearly impassable. How easily could they be ascended? To loose a thousand-jun crossbow at a mere minnow or a fly would be as futile as expending the awe of ten thousand chariots upon a desolate, crumbling fortress. I humbly beseech Your Sagely Compassion to heed the will of the people, to revoke the decree, and to await the triumphant news of victory, thereby ensuring the eternal unity of Hua and Yi.

In presumptuous defiance of Your Celestial Majesty’s authority, I am seized by trembling, dread, and overwhelming trepidation. With utmost reverence, I present this memorial at the palace gate, prostrating myself in gratitude.

**Second Memorial**

Your servant has received the imperial decree that the imperial carriage shall proceed to the northern army front, and that the Crown Prince, the chief ministers, and all officials have submitted memorials in earnest petition, yet no assent has been granted.

Though the inspection of regional customs and mores is an ancient rite of the classics, the consolation and reassurance of the troops reflect the compassionate illumination of a sovereign and father.

Yet the journey is fraught with peril—land and water congeal in harsh rigor, while hearts near and far burn with genuine anxiety. I humbly reflect that Your Imperial Majesty embodies the compassion of Yao and surpasses the wisdom of Shun, desiring that all within the four seas bathe in the harmony of your transformative virtue. Yet in the regions of Qian and Long, so close to the frontier, long-standing covenants have been betrayed, and profound trust has been violated. Those who recognize the need for change have already bound themselves to loyalty; those still lost in defiance cling to false security, covering their ears. Thus, the people of this land nurse grievances accumulated over years. They have long witnessed the barking of dogs at Yao, yet yearn for Shun with no means to reach him. Therefore, you have entrusted generals with halberds to marshal the troops and erected altars to swear oaths before the masses. Commands fly like the wind, and valor surges like rain. The might of your commanders shakes the earth like thunder, their resolve firm as iron and stone. They pledge to achieve victory by a set date, ensuring the land’s pacification. Why then should Your Majesty personally ride the jade carriage, wielding white-feathered arrows? Six dragons and eight steeds would traverse treacherous paths; ten thousand riders and a thousand officials would traverse distant peaks beyond. Frost and snow now fall, and biting cold draws near. I humbly beseech Your Celestial Mercy to heed the sentiments of the myriad people and temporarily suspend the command to inspect the frontier. Thus, you will uphold the ancestral altars above and console the hearts of Hua and Yi below. Awaiting the triumphant report, may your realm expand further. Overwhelmed by Your Majesty’s profound favor, I yet feel unworthy of such luminous sincerity. My trespass against your august dignity is unbearable; my longing for grace is urgent, and my prayers are fervent.

**Memorial of Thanks for the Imperial Favor to Renovate Xingsheng Abbey under Master Hongyi Zhang Qian**

Your servant has received the imperial decree granting Master Hongyi Zhang Qian of Xingsheng Abbey on the Left Street the honor of renovating and presiding over the abbey. This grace flows from Your Majesty’s sacred heart, bestowing glory upon the realm of the Dao. The robes of the faithful rejoice, and the sacred groves shine with renewed splendor. I prostrate myself in gratitude, reflecting that Your Majesty’s Dao equals that of the Yellow Emperor and your sagacity rivals that of Emperor Yao. You dwell in thought upon the peaks of Guye and dream of the land of Huaxu. In your care for the great teachings, principle harmonizes with the wellspring of life. The spiritual and the formless merge in non-action, while your mind cherishes those of hidden virtue. Your transformative influence aligns with purity and stillness, benefiting the state and its people. Yet the abbey’s halls stood desolate, its images veiled in dust. Now, your profound favor has been bestowed, commanding its restoration. This abbey, adjacent to the Jade Purity precinct, was once a center of Daoist learning. Later, it was renamed Zhenyuan Abbey, then designated the Purple Ultimate Palace. In the Zhide era, it was renamed Xingsheng, fronting the broad thoroughfare and bordered by the Jin River to the east. Truly a numinous site, a blessed place within the imperial capital. Its gates and halls remain intact, its sacred images preserved. It is a trace of immortals through the ages, a land of fortune for the imperial city. Now, it undergoes thorough renovation, all impurities swept away. Dust is cleared from its humble corners, revealing jade-like visages; tiles and bricks are purged from the overgrown thickets, and a jasper altar is newly raised. Rain and dew nourish the trees, enhancing their splendor; incense and musk adorn the countenances, imbuing them with solemn dignity. Zhang Qian and his peers devote themselves to carving and polishing, faithfully upholding their duties. Evening chimes and morning bells pray for Your Majesty’s longevity; morning incense and evening candles seek the eternal flourishing of the imperial enterprise. I, though unworthy, have been counted among the faithful and personally honored by your radiant favor. My gratitude is boundless.

**Memorial of Thanks for the Imperial Favor of Bestowing a Bell for the Yamen Hall**

Your servant has received the imperial decree bestowing a bell to be struck during rituals in the Riyuan precinct before the Yamen Hall. This grace descends from the heavens, honoring the faithful, filling me with joy beyond measure, and amplifying the radiance of my humble station. I reflect that Your Majesty’s virtue spans the Two Modes and shelters the Three Luminaries.

The radiance of Your Majesty’s grace floods boundlessly, and your benevolence has been bestowed for generations. Thus, the eight seas have stilled their waves, and the great leviathan shall be extinguished in this flourishing age; the five planets follow their constant course, and the mighty comet dissolves into the eternal night. The barbarian and the civilized lands alike have been pacified, and weapons of war sheathed in submission. Yet Your Majesty’s compassion further extends to the mysterious teachings, preserving the profound Daoist path. This has moved the numinous realms to respond, and signs of divine favor have manifested among the immortals. Rightly should Your Majesty’s sacred longevity rival the sun, moon, and stars, and the imperial destiny be exalted above heaven, earth, sea, and mountain.

Now, mindful that within my temple precincts the ritual instruments remain incomplete, and that on days of fasting and offering, the resonant tones of the bell are still absent, I lack the means to commune with the true, and the rites to summon the sacred cannot be harmonized. Yet from the jade steps of the celestial palace, the sound of the sun’s resonance descends from on high; from the bountiful peaks, the frost-laden chime is bestowed upon the mortal realm. This act surpasses the honor of bestowed music, and the grace of this bell’s gift is beyond measure. I shall forever burn fragrant herbs and offer prayers to the true spirits, beseeching the advent of auspicious fortune. Humbly aspiring to repay Your Majesty’s favor, I reverently receive the bestowed bell with incense and gratitude, overwhelmed by gratitude.

**Memorial of Thanks for the Imperial Bestowal of the Jade Bureau’s Laozi Statue**

Your servant humbly acknowledges the imperial decree bestowing the ancient stone statue of Laozi from the Jade Bureau’s grotto gate, to be enshrined and venerated in the western chamber beneath the Imperial Portrait Hall of Longxing Abbey. The accompanying stone canopy has been dismantled and reassembled at the abbey, and funds have been granted for a vegetarian feast for the Daoist assembly, along with banners, flowers, and ceremonial processions to escort the statue to its new home.

The imperial grace descends like a soaking rain, illuminating the gates of the mysterious Dao; the grand thoroughfare is transformed, and Daoists and laity alike rejoice. I, your servant, prostrate in gratitude. I reflect that Your Majesty’s governance unfolds the primordial Dao, ruling with effortless transformation. You have propagated the principles of purity, tranquility, and non-action, and spread the power of emptiness and non-interference. Great peace has been achieved, and unity is at hand. Though the visage of the Primordial Lord has long been near the imperial residence, where incense and lamps are never lacking, the proper place for veneration is within the sacred halls of the Dao. Thus, the imperial command was issued, and the feast was richly prepared. Sandalwood and aloeswood incense waft fragrance, while banners and canopies stand in solemn array. The clamor of golden cymbals and jade chimes has scarcely faded from the palace courtyard before the procession, swift as wind and clouds, arrives at the gates of Longxing Abbey. All hearts gaze in reverence, and the multitude follows in joy. The thunderous acclamation of praise resounds, and the mist of sacred blessings gathers.

I, along with the Daoist assembly, have found refuge in the great teaching and repeatedly received Your Majesty’s profound favor. We shall redouble our devotion in cultivation, striving to repay your sagely grace, overwhelmed by gratitude.

**Memorial of Congratulation on the Recovery of Longzhou**

Your servant has learned that before the northern army, the military governor of Longzhou, Sang Jian, along with his troops and the city itself, has surrendered and returned Longzhou to imperial control. Your Majesty’s far-reaching strategy has been proclaimed, and loyal generals have rendered their service. With but a slight exertion of force, a formidable city has been reclaimed.

I, your servant, prostrate in congratulation. I reflect that Your Majesty’s sagacity surpasses that of the Yellow Emperor, and your martial prowess exceeds that of King Wu of Zhou. Your divine calculations unfold as if held in the palm of your hand, and every move achieves success; you assess formidable enemies as if viewing them within a nutshell, and every strategy is flawless. Since the rebels in the Qi borderlands betrayed their oaths and broke the alliances beyond the passes, they have deeply violated the rites of amity and abruptly severed the bonds of neighborly harmony. Clinging to a pack of jackals and wolves, they relied on the strength of their three regions. Like birds nesting in broken reeds, they sought fleeting security, or like one sitting atop a pile of firewood, they claimed false stability. The lesser failing to serve the greater is a crime the *Spring and Autumn Annals* condemns. Thus, righteous warriors lifted their gaze in indignation, and strategists clenched their fists in resolve, all resolved to eradicate the threat and take up arms.

The six armies surged forward in eagerness, and the eight encampments silently roused their courage. They trampled the dust in anticipation of crushing Wu Peak, and watered their horses at the Wei River, preparing to pay homage. Sang Jian, adapting wisely to changing circumstances and discerning the right path, laid down his weapons and presented jade in surrender, offering his allegiance. He has presented a thousand *li* of mountains and rivers without a single blade being drawn, and restored a region of households and populace without the slightest harm. The blades of the imperial army have been sheathed, and the masses of Shang and Shou have been reclaimed without effort. Envisioning the roads of Huizhong, the rebels find no path of retreat; gazing upon the solemnity of Bashang, they realize nowhere to flee. It is certain that the vile shall soon be captured and executed. Behold the unity of the eight rivers and three mountains, and the eternal dominion over the nine provinces and four seas. All shall be encompassed within the reign of Shun and the domain of Yu.

I, your servant, have been blessed to witness this flourishing era and repeatedly behold such great victories, overwhelmed by gratitude.

**Memorial Presenting the Statue of the Perfected Zhang on the Birthday of the Celestial Han**

In the second month and eighth day of the first year of Tianhan, your servant humbly observes that the imperial enterprise shines eternally, and the Supreme Emperor bestows auspicious omens. From the northern pole and the jade pivot of the heavens, a radiant rainbow light heralds the birth of Your Majesty’s sagely brilliance...

In the central heavens, the jade Dipper gathers purple lightning to congeal its splendor. The myriad states rejoice in reverent gaze, and the hearts of all people swell with exultation. We humbly reflect that Your Majesty embodies the luminous spirit of Heaven and Earth, and the Nine Heavens amass auspicious omens. Your perfect governance fills the cosmos, and Your clarity and solemnity command the reverence of gods and spirits. Having laid the grand foundation for thirty generations, Your reign now surpasses the glory of the Zhou; having ushered in four hundred years of radiant fortune, Your enterprise is poised to transcend the legacy of the Han. Your profound virtue and grace extend to the dark-haired people, and the balmy winds of Your benevolence stir both Hua and Yi lands.

Now, as the grand festival of Shouchun approaches and the sacred day of Your Majesty’s birth draws near, tribute pours in like clouds, and vessels from across the waves converge. All offer the humble gift of celery in observance, continuing the mountain-shaking acclamations. Together with the Daoist priests of this abbey, I reverently sweep the resplendent altar, meticulously following the secret rituals. We chant the sacred texts with jade-like clarity, unfurling scrolls veiled in mist. The frost-white silks are immaculately arrayed, and our purified sincerity shall eternally expand the blessings of Heaven and Earth.

The Perfected Zhang, once a disciple of the Daoist Patriarch, personally received the sacred scriptures. He transmitted the true records of the Primordial Heaven and sealed the jade texts in the blessed realms. He foresaw the flourishing of the imperial enterprise and penetrated the mysteries of the Dao’s pivot. When compared to Song Gao’s recognition of the Divine Yao or Tao Hongjing’s acquaintance with Emperor Wu of Liang, his discernment and virtue are beyond parallel. Thus, we dare to adorn the silk with elegant embellishments, offering this image for veneration. Through the burning of incense, may we perpetuate the auspicious blessings. With utmost reverence and trepidation, I present this memorial, unworthy as I am to approach Your Majesty’s august presence.

The details of the painted image’s merits and virtues are respectfully submitted to the palace gates for Your Majesty’s perusal, awaiting Your sacred decree.

**Memorial of Thanks for the Bestowal of Purple Robes and Daoist Titles upon Huang Wanyou and Deng Baijing**

I, your servant, observe that by Your Majesty’s sacred edict, the Daoist priest Huang Wanyou of Kuizhou has been granted purple robes and a Daoist title, and the Daoist priest Deng Baijing of Luojiang County has been bestowed purple robes. The Great Sage rules the heavens, and His divine works extend to all things. Within the court, worthy and capable ministers assist; beyond its walls, no worthy person is left unrecognized. All within the realm pay homage, rightfully so under the radiance of Your sagely reign.

I, your servant, humbly express my gratitude. Huang Wanyou and his peers have long embraced their aspirations in the forests, gathering like deer in the wilderness, dwelling deep among the cliffs and vines, untouched by fame or profit. Some possess the power of cinnabar and flowers to revive the dying and halt the advance of time; others wield vermilion talismans to expel demons and dispel misfortune. All have expanded the application of the Dao, subtly aiding this enlightened era. Suddenly, imperial summons arrived like crane-borne decrees, calling them to the phoenix gates of the palace. Wanyou hastened from the brocade-laden waters, and Baijing journeyed from Luojiang. Together, they gaze upon the heavens of Yao and bask in the grace of Shun. Surveying the annals of history, none can compare to this honor.

We humbly reflect that Your Majesty’s Dao surpasses that of Tang Yao, and Your achievements tower above those of the Yellow Emperor. Even in the days when the spirit congealed by the Fen River, the Ninefold Gates remained distant; when the carriage was labored to Mount Kongtong for counsel, the journey was arduous. Yet now, the imperial reed-boats arrive in abundance, and cassia-oared vessels come like clouds. They forsake the mist-laden vines and personally attend the imperial throne. With illustrious titles conferred and splendid robes bestowed, their glory shall shine in the records and illuminate the humble headdresses of Daoist priests. I am overwhelmed with gratitude beyond measure.

*Guangcheng Collection, Volume Two*

The Memorial of Thanks for the Imperial Summons to Meet with Grand Master Hongdao Huang Wanyou, Composed by Du Guangting, Court-Appointed Literary Master of the Supreme Clarity Palace in the Upper Capital, Bestowed the Purple Robe

Your servant humbly states: By imperial decree, I was commanded to proceed to the Inner Privy Council to meet with Grand Master Hongdao, Huang Wanyou.

Heavenly kindness extends its compassion, stooping to embrace the frail and lowly. The burden of grace is too weighty to bear; my awe and honor redouble without end.

Your servant prostrates himself in gratitude. I humbly reflect that Your Majesty’s transformation is vast and rooted in the Dao, and Your governance upholds perfect benevolence. Your toil and care extend to all quarters, and Your compassion leaves nothing untouched. Thus, reclusive scholars who slumber among clouds hasten their hearts toward the imperial court from afar, and lofty men who scorn the world now fully comprehend the rites of attending the Son of Heaven.

Grand Master Hongdao has long delved into the profound arts and dwelled in seclusion among towering peaks. Though his name and fame were known, his form remained unseen. Now, heeding the imperial summons, he has come directly to the palace gates, exchanging his hempen sash and lotus robe for the honored purple vestments and the title of Grand Master. This event shall illuminate the annals of history and bring glory to the Daoist gate.

By Your sagely grace, I was commanded to meet with him, receiving the favor of Your radiant wisdom and beholding the countenance of a crane soaring among clouds. My steps tread the celestial precincts of the Jasper Pool, ascending the immortal isles of Penglai. I am overwhelmed by this extraordinary favor, my honor shining upon ten thousand lives.

Yet how can one as insignificant as a wren or sparrow repay the virtue of Heaven and Earth?

Your servant is at a loss.

*Memorial Submitted at the Jade Bureau of the Dragon Prosperity Abbey*

Previously, on the twenty-second day of the tenth month of this year, Your servant received an imperial edict bestowing an old Jade Bureau abbey hall, along with a stone statue of the Venerable Lord Lao, to be relocated to the present abbey. Now, upon the completion of the new hall constructed on the foundation of the lecture hall behind the main殿, the stone statue of the Venerable Lord Lao has been duly installed for offerings and reverence.

The sacred mountains and great rivers, the Twenty-Four Transformations, and the seasonal sacrifices of spring and autumn are all prescribed in ancient rites. For the regular offerings at the Jade Bureau Transformation, I humbly request that they commence on the eighth day of the second month of the first year of the Tianhan era, to be conducted by the local prefecture and county officials before the stone statue of the Venerable Lord Lao at the Jade Bureau within the Dragon Prosperity Abbey. May this prevent any neglect and align with reverent devotion.

Moreover, the Northern Mang Transformation in Junzhou has lacked offerings and prayers for many years. As it lies within the realm, it is fitting to restore the proper rites. For this transformation as well, I propose that it be conducted at the Dragon Prosperity Abbey alongside the Jade Bureau rites. May the extended blessings bring eternal fortune to the sagely court.

I respectfully submit the above for Your Majesty’s consideration and await Your imperial decree.

A Memorial on the Emperor’s Establishment of a Vegetarian Feast for the Crown Prince’s Birthday

Your servant humbly receives Your Majesty’s sacred decree, which, in celebration of the Crown Prince’s birthday, bestows sixty strings of cash from the Manor and Estate Treasury. These funds are to be disbursed at the Northern Emperor’s Abbey, where twenty-one selected Daoist clerics shall be dispatched to inaugurate a seven-day-and-night Yellow Register Daoist ritual on the eighth day of the seventh month, concluding with the dispersal of the vegetarian feast on the fifteenth.

As the purple qi fills the court and the Eastern Palace brings forth a sage, joyous voices resound across the Six Directions, and felicitous qi congeals within the Ninefold Enclosure. All within the realm reverently offer their congratulations. Your Majesty’s grace extends throughout the realm, and Your compassion embraces Your ministers. Mindful that the Crown Prince has long been devoted to self-cultivation and ever cherishes frugality, You fear that unwarranted expenditures might deplete the people’s resources and burden their labors. Thus, all government offices have been instructed to curtail their ritual observances. Yet from the Inner Treasury, funds and goods have been specially allocated to open a sacred altar within the abbey, invoking the Perfected Ones of the Jade Capital and Golden Gates, and amplifying the blessings of the Radiant Hall and the Four Quarters. This noble rite surpasses even the finest precedents of antiquity.

Your servant, having received this august command, shall proceed with reverent offerings and prayers. Witnessing this renewed grace and beholding the vast and magnanimous design, I am overcome with boundless joy. With utmost reverence, I record this memorial in celebration and respectfully submit it for Your Majesty’s consideration.

A Memorial on the Yellow Register Ritual at the Venerable Lord Lao’s Hall

Your servant humbly receives the imperial decree instructing that at the Northern Emperor’s Abbey, before the Most High Lord Lao, a three-day Yellow Register Daoist ritual be conducted, concluding with the dispersal of the vegetarian feast. Sixty strings of cash from the Manor and Estate Treasury are to be disbursed, and twenty-one selected Daoist clerics are to be dispatched to perform the rites of recitation and repentance with utmost purity and devotion.

Your Majesty’s achievements surpass those of the Five Emperors, and Your virtue excels that of the Three Sovereigns. From beneath the suspended tassels of Your crown, the winds of the Dao are spread abroad; from behind the upright screen, the transformation of non-action is unfurled.

Your Majesty’s profound intent moves in secret, and the myriad spirits respond in silent communion; Your sagely thoughts extend afar, and the four seas follow like clouds to attend the Sacred. Thus do Heaven and Earth unite in harmony, sun and moon shine with unblemished radiance, the years yield abundance and peace, and winds and rains come in due season. Where the divine spear points, the long serpents and great boars are all subdued; where Your boundless grace extends, drought demons and lurking dragons retreat of themselves. Thereupon, from the immortal mountains and secluded grottoes, auspicious omens arise in ceaseless succession; jade seals and bronze talismans, pillars of good fortune, appear in due course.

Now, as You deliver the realm from the calamity of overflowing chaos and raise an army like timely rain, You shall expand the Eight Seas to unite all under one rule. Yet still, with reverent heart, You honor the teachings of the Mysterious, yielding virtue to the august heavens. On this day of the Zhongyuan Festival, when purity is observed, You prepare the assembly of incense and flowers across the Three Realms, repaying the sacred power of the Primordial Lord and opening the precious altar of the Yellow Register. Through this, boundless blessings shall be secured, great fortune firmly established, and Your jade-like reign and sagely longevity perpetuated.

Your servant, favored by Your exalted grace, humbly presents this report in praise of Your virtuous decree. With utmost sincerity, I reverently offer prayers through the burning of incense. The weight of this honor is beyond bearing.

This memorial is respectfully submitted to express gratitude for the proclamation of peace and the pacification of the frontier.

Your servant, [Name], prostrates to receive the sacred edict, which proclaims the memorial submitted by the eastern and northern frontier armies. The report details the return of the surrendered officials Jian Wang and Yan Liu from Fengxiang, who have provided intelligence on the rebels’ affairs, along with popular ballads foretelling the pacification of the frontier by the coming year.

Your servant ventures to declare: The Dao of Heaven is subtle and profound, silently overseeing the signs of fortune; the workings of the divine are obscure yet truly govern blessings and omens. Thus, the words of folk songs serve to herald auspicious decrees. In ancient times, the green youth’s ballad on the broad roads of Wu foretold its fall; the strange bird descending upon the high terrace in Chen presaged its destruction. The flight of the five stars marked the moment Yu Shun received the realm; the transformation of a horse into a dragon signaled the rise of Emperor Yuan. All these arose from the will of Heaven, resonating deeply in the hearts of the people. Upon careful examination, such propitious words invariably reflect the sagely virtue of the ruler.

Your Majesty, inheriting the Mandate of Heaven and manifesting divine wisdom, has responded to the joyous acclamation of the multitudes, governing the seas and mountains; bearing the cherished charge of the vast heavens, You have delivered and saved all living beings. The treasures and sacred talismans of the realm have arrived unbidden; rare tributes from distant lands and border tribes have come in droves, drawn by the radiance of Your rule. Yet the northern frontier, ungrateful for Your grace, has turned its back on righteousness, perching upon a pyre only to invite its own conflagration, standing at the edge of a reed only to ensure its own destruction. Now, the divine has revealed its portents, and the streets and alleys hum with prophecy. The words thus proclaimed bear the promise of swift victory. The "frontier" mentioned refers to the lands beyond the nation’s strategic passes. At this time of the nation’s strength, under the leadership of the "rain-bringing" army, the divine will speaks, and auspicious light manifests. The ballad of the coming reign foretells triumph over the enemy, and success is within reach. Soon, the Three Qin shall be pacified, and all under heaven shall be unified under Your rule. May Your jade-like reign and precious destiny endure as long as heaven and earth.

Your servant, favored by the celestial benevolence, has personally heard these auspicious words. I humbly present my shallow insights, trespassing upon Your sacred dignity, overwhelmed by the weight of this honor.

**Memorial of Gratitude for the Bestowal of the Tianxi Abbey Estate**

Your servant, [Name], prostrates to receive the sacred grace, which has decreed the bestowal of one estate in Tongji County, Hanzhou, formerly belonging to Tang Youze, upon the Tianxi Abbey, to be held in perpetuity as its permanent endowment.

Your Majesty, inheriting the Mandate of Heaven and responding to the cosmic order, has extended Your sacred robes to govern. The grand design was preordained in the Upper Clarity, and the precious registers have emerged from the depths of the earth. The renovation of the abbey’s halls fittingly answers the auspicious omens. The images in the Three Halls are majestic and solemn, and the incense and flowers offered year-round are pure and refined. Now, You have specially bestowed Your sagely favor, generously granting estates and fields, converting fertile lands into permanent endowments. The imperial benevolence descends from on high, enhancing the glory of the Daoist teachings. Henceforth, the daily provisions for vegetarian meals shall be secured without want; morning incense and evening candles shall burn with undivided devotion. May this pray for the eternal prolongation of Your sacred longevity and the everlasting prosperity of Your grand foundation.

Your servant, undeservingly honored by Your sacred reward and personally favored with extraordinary grace, is overwhelmed by this honor.

**Memorial of Gratitude for the Renovation of the Zhangren Abbey by the Monk Xingzhen**

Your servant, [Name], prostrates to observe the memorial of the Great Master Monk Xingzhen, which reports the completion of the renovation of the True Lord Zhangren Hall on Mount Qingcheng, as decreed by Your sacred edict.

Your Majesty, in Your benevolence, governs all directions, and Your compassion extends to both teachings. The Jetavana Grove and Penglai Isle alike share in the grace of Your reverence and adornment; the Deer Park and the Turtle Palace together receive the gift of Your renovations. Now, for this abode of the immortals, You have specially commanded a eminent monk to undertake the carving and construction, bringing to completion its magnificent splendor. The newly completed hall stands deep and resplendent, forever anchoring the court of blessings. May the spirits of the Five Peaks and Ten Caves augment Your longevity, matching the heavens in enduring kalpas.

Your servant, dwelling within the Daoist teachings and personally favored by the imperial grace, is overwhelmed by this honor.

**Memorial for the Daoist Ritual and Abstinence on the Birthday of the Imperial Prince**

Your servant, [Name], prostrates to declare: The Nine Heavens have gathered their blessings, and the Three Luminaries have congealed their auspicious signs. The moving pivot of the palace radiates light, and the spring chamber of the Eastern Palace brings forth a scion of excellence. All within the realm, from the Hua to the Yi, rejoice as one. The Emperor has generously dispensed coins and treasures, devoutly observing the fast to accumulate merit. May the Upper Clarity look upon this with favor, bestowing boundless longevity upon Your sacred person; may the Perfect Dao confer blessings, bringing a thousand auspicious signs to the heir apparent. May the great treasure flourish and the Nine Regions be eternally governed.

Your servants, having diligently performed the rites of incense and purification, are honored to receive the imperial bestowals, overwhelmed by awe and reverence.

**Memorial of Gratitude for the Approval of the Honorific Title**

Your servant, [Name], prostrates to receive the imperial decree approving the honorific title proposed by the ministers and myself.

Our earnest petition has been presented above, and the imperial brilliance has gazed upon it below. By the Mandate of Heaven, all within the realm rejoice as one.

We humbly reflect: The Emperor, like the black bird that heralded the rise of Shang, and the red omens that marked the founding of Han, has rescued the world from fire and flood, endowed by the divine with a talent for the age; with the sun’s halo and the moon’s mystery, Heaven has bestowed its timely signs. Your majestic achievements and sagely virtue surpass those of former dynasties; encompassing the celestial reckoning and expanding the grand foundation, You have reverently received the precious Mandate. Thus, the Three Spirits have altered their divination, and the myriad states have submitted. You surpass the rulers of Tang and Wu, who marshaled their armies with axes; You scorn the founders of Wei and Sui, who bullied the weak and oppressed the orphaned. Shaking Your robes, You bring peace to the Nine Regions; with Your crown tassels still, You illuminate the great treasure. Inheriting the golden destiny of the Yellow Emperor, wielding the talismans of the White Emperor, You hold the golden mirror to illuminate the world, uniting the spirits and the people in harmony; grasping the jade armillary, You survey the seas and islands, as the multitudes joyfully acclaim Your rule. Thus, at the Upright Gate, auspicious vapors fill the halls; upon the Circular Mound, divine soldiers attend Your retinue. At the ancestral temple, dark clouds gather in volumes, and the moon shines brightly at midnight; bearing the grand title, white mist lightly ascends, and smoke envelops the broad steps. Unicorns appear in the ponds, dragons leap in the river rapids; plants and trees bear patterns, clouds and rosy dawns display their hues. Golden talismans dance in their scripts, and jade seals radiate their light. Though You defer to the virtue of the Upper Mystery, Your deeds already fill the annals of the Grand Historians.

Moreover, from the ends of the earth to the farthest frontiers, from the northern deserts to the southern wilds, rare treasures are arrayed in the bright court, and divine steeds are presented from the celestial stables. Precious incense arrives from distant lands, and exquisite jade is offered from foreign realms. Like Emperor Wu of Han, who received tributes from the four corners, You bestow the correct calendar; like Emperor Gaozong of Tang, who unified the myriad states, they now seek to share in Your culture and governance. Soon, You shall restore the ancient boundaries of Yu, and further expand the lands of Yao.

The hundred offices follow their seasons in perfect order, and the six harmonies of music resound in concord. Trust extends even to the creatures of land and water, and grace embraces all that moves and grows. You pardon debts long overdue and relieve the imprisoned, reducing punishments. No star of imprisonment appears in the heavens, nor does the earth bear the ominous *qi* of slaughter. Captives, their necks bound in ropes, are spared the axe and halberd’s might; even the guilty kin of condemned rebels receive grants of silk and coin. Sacrificial beasts are fat and sleek, and grain offerings pure and abundant. Thus do You dare to manifest reverence before the divine, honoring the worthy with robes and caps. Your sincere heart reaches Heaven and Earth, and Your utmost devotion is displayed in the suburban rites. Every feeling finds response, and every movement meets timely favor.

You do not flaunt extravagance nor indulge in delicate splendor. No excess attends Your pleasures, nor do You fall prey to dissipation. You do not delight in reckless riding nor yield to the chase or the hunt. In stillness, You are solemn and stern; in action, You adhere to ritual and precedent. Wealth is abundant and the people harmonious; violence is forbidden and the populace secure. The grand review corrects martial prowess, and the great muster displays the army’s might. A million fierce warriors stand ready, all equipped with chariots and arms. The finest stallions—thousands strong, each a dragon’s descendant—are rebuffed; the swiftest steeds, worthy of Sun Yang, are rewarded for loyalty and filial piety. Talent and ability are broadly sought: no good deed is overlooked, and even the smallest merit is recorded. Those devoted to the classics are spurred by lofty examinations; recluses of pure integrity are bound by noble rank. Rewards encourage diligence and strengthen the foundation, while farming is promoted and agriculture urged. The year yields abundant grain in the fields, and the granaries overflow with the season’s plenty. The countryside teems with ripening crops like clouds, and the nation prospers as households grow rich. No beacon fires trouble the four frontiers, and within a hundred *li*, songs and joy abound.

Generals blaze like stars with martial prowess, their achievements towering and their ranks resplendent; scholars rise like mountains with vast learning, their Confucian influence majestic and profound. Though Sun Quan once flourished south of the Yangtze and Liu Bei held the southwest, when compared to Your surpassing merit, how faint their glory appears. Now the passes and rivers are at peace, watchtowers silent, and neighboring states exchange envoys bearing gifts. Nearby borders lay down their weapons. The people rejoice in wealth and longevity, governance is harmonious and prosperous, and loyal ministers—civil and military—long to enhance Your glorious virtue. From within and without, all humbly beseech You, and the lands of Hua and Yi speak with one voice. May You indeed restore the radiance of sun and moon, and in Your benevolence, bestow the imperial assent.

Wearing the round heaven as a crown and treading the square earth as a mat, all within the realm and beneath the sky rejoice. As we await the appointed day of the grand ceremony, gazing upon the lofty heavens, we leap for joy.

Your servants, along with the assembled Daoist clergy, cannot contain our exultation, our jubilation, and our fervent devotion.

**Memorial Requesting Restoration of the Original Surname**

Your servant has heard that the lineage of the unshakable rock admits no other clan, and the weight of the ramparts’ defense truly rests upon its own branches. To establish enduring and grand principles, one must properly define the distinctions of kinship. Your servant, though versed in literary arts, is ignorant of martial classics. Yet, having trodden the path of war, I early received the grace of Your celestial favor. Wielding spear and sword, my sole intent was to repay my lord; in northern expeditions and southern campaigns, I ever swore to serve the throne with devotion.

Since Your Majesty has marshaled heroes and swept clean the realm, I have been mindful of even the slightest service. In recognition of my humble efforts, You have bestowed extraordinary grace, granting me kinship and placing me among the imperial lineage. Yet, I strive to dedicate my life, hoping to repay Your sagely favor.

Now, as the cosmos undergoes transformation, Heaven and Earth bestow their blessings. The virtue of earth subtly shifts, and the mandate of metal begins its course. Responding to the acclamation of Hua and Yi, You fulfill the allegiance of the myriad peoples. Seated in tranquility, the divine regalia come to You, as in the abdication of Shun; governing with reverence, the dragon chart is inaugurated without the need for Zhou’s conquest. The sacred lineage of Mount Gou shall endure as the heavens, and the jade source of the Huai River shall last as the earth. The majestic imperial succession must be upheld by the unbroken line of descendants; the vast imperial foundation cannot be mingled with the offspring of common gates.

Reflecting upon myself, I find that honor has only deepened my anxiety. Thus, I dare to lay bare my earnest plea, though it risks offending the imperial scales. I seek to distinguish noble from base and forever order the celestial from the mortal. I humbly beseech Your sagely compassion to permit Your servant to return to his original surname. In presuming to offend Your august dignity, I await punishment, overwhelmed by tears of gratitude and prostrate in awe.

**Memorial on the Solar Eclipse That Did Not Occur**

Your servant observes that the Bureau of Astronomy has reported that on the first day of this month, at the *dingwei* hour (9–11 a.m.) and four *ke* (one *ke* = 14.4 minutes), the sun was to be eclipsed at 11 degrees in the constellation *Zhen*, and was to be restored to fullness by the *wei* hour (1–3 p.m.) and four *ke*. Yet, upon verification, no eclipse occurred.

The sun’s brilliance ascends, and the ruler’s virtue equals its majesty. Surpassing the calculations of astronomers, it did not wane, revealing Your sagely luminosity and responsive perception.

**Memorial of Gratitude**

Your servant prostrates himself in reverence, reflecting that Your Imperial Majesty, born of the primal yang, has brought forth sagely radiance, and the two luminaries shine with equal brilliance. Rising like the fusang tree in the eastern palace, Your pure splendor illuminates the Qian Dao. Embodying the winter sun’s warmth, Your grace flows to the Nine Regions; emulating the spring breeze’s kindness, Your mercy extends to all beneath heaven. Thus, the great light gains luster, its brilliance beyond the reach of measuring instruments. In perfect accord with the singular blessing of heaven and earth, it transcends the ordinary bounds of yin and yang. Auspicious radiance grows ever more resplendent, and Your mysterious virtue moves heaven. Surpassing the Han’s twice-restored sun and eclipsing Yao’s conjoined luminaries, this glory shall be inscribed in the annals of history, crowning all celestial charts.

Your servant, privileged to witness this flourishing era, has beheld such gracious favor. Looking back upon the twilight of my years, my heart, like the sunflower, turns ever more fervently toward the sun. Words fail to express my boundless joy.

**Memorial on the Completion of the Renovation of the Hall of the Perfected Lord at the Zhangren Abbey**

Your servant humbly notes that Master Xingzhen of Changping Mountain has reported the completion of the reconstruction of the grand hall of the Perfected Lord at Zhangren Abbey, as commanded by Your August Decree.

The sagely enterprise spreads far and wide, and the immortal sanctuary is renewed. A monumental achievement is accomplished, and the numinous traces gain greater glory. Your servant reflects that Your Majesty’s virtue permeates all directions, and Your benevolence extends to both teachings. The civilizing influence reaches distant lands, where even foreign courts offer sincerity; martial prowess shines forth, and barbarian tribes heed commands as stern as frost and snow. From the palaces of Penglai to the gardens of Nai, all are restored and rebuilt. Within the realm, all gaze upon the rites of music; both Chinese and foreigners recognize the teachings of the Daoist and Buddhist clergy. Such merit surpasses antiquity, and such glory outshines former kings.

Last winter, as the Zhangren Abbey had stood for many years and its halls and corridors had fallen into disrepair, You commanded eminent monks to oversee its reconstruction and bestowed resources to ensure its flourishing. Thus, stones were quarried from distant mountains, timber felled in secluded valleys. Fine beams were hewn for use, and craftsmen applied their skills. In no time, a magnificent edifice stood firm, rivaling the heavens in grandeur. Its soaring eaves gaze upon the sun, its vast terraces span the sky. Clouds brush against its lofty beams, winds whisper through its lattice windows. Though its walls and foundations remain unchanged, the painted murals appear freshly rendered. Hills are leveled to open courtyards, and streams are diverted to protect the steps. No rushing currents can reach it, no flying stones can assail it. This wondrous achievement manifests Your sagely and divine benevolence. Such extraordinary merit shall endure forever, prolonging Your sacred longevity without end.

Your servant, though unworthy, has long stood at the gates of the mysterious, deeply bathed in Your imperial grace. With reverence, I burn incense to repay Your radiant kindness.

**Memorial on the Thanksgiving Ritual for the New Hall of the Zhangren Abbey and the Installation of the Earth Deity**

Your servant humbly received Your August Decree, commanding that a thanksgiving ritual be held to consecrate the newly completed hall of the Zhangren Abbey on Mount Qingcheng and to install the earth deity.

Your servant reflects that Your Majesty’s benevolence encompasses land and sea, and Your grace extends to both Confucian and Daoist teachings. Turning toward the sacred mountain, You bestow favor upon the immortal abbey. Its halls and chambers had long fallen into ruin, and the restoration of its teachings had no means to proceed. By Your sagely command, a true monk was appointed, and the nation’s resources were allocated. The grandeur of the reconstruction seemed divinely wrought, its towering magnificence rivaling the works of the gods. May this blessed foundation endure forever, as eternal as heaven itself.

Your servant, honored by Your sagely favor, has reverently prepared the ritual altar. With solemn incense and candles, I have performed the rites, offering thanks to the true spirits. Amid cloud-wreathed peaks and misty valleys, I seem to hear the echoes of "Long live the Emperor!" The jade registers and golden talismans further extend Your reign, multiplying Your years like the thousand-cycles of the *chun* tree.

Having completed the ritual on the twenty-third day of this month, I now return and respectfully present this memorial at the palace gates to report on the proceedings.

**Memorial Congratulating the Presentation of the Divine Sword and Offering a Poem**

Your servant humbly notes that Zhao Kuangye has today presented a divine sword retrieved from the river at Hezhou, which has been displayed throughout the realm.

Your servant reflects that as the era of grand peace dawns, auspicious omens must appear. To purge evil and calamity, a divine sword has manifested. It aids Your sagely power in severing malevolence and embodies the heavens’ and earth’s support.

Your servant reverently considers that Your Majesty’s merit surpasses the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, Your awe commands the world, Your benevolence reaches both seen and unseen realms, and Your Dao equals heaven and earth. Thus, mountains and rivers, forests and valleys emit golden flames from towering cliffs; winds and rains, thunder and lightning reveal frost-edged blades across ten thousand *li*. This single strip of autumn water first reveals its earth-emerging form; this several-foot gleam of tempered light displays its sky-leaning might. Its transformations further manifest its divine marvels.

In ancient times, the First Emperor of Qin retrieved such a sword from the river’s heart and indeed swallowed the Six Kingdoms. Now, Your Majesty has obtained it from the river’s surface, and You shall unite all under heaven. Who could compare to its jade-cutting, metal-slicing edge? What blade that beheaded horses or severed serpents could rival it?

Your servant, honored to live in this flourishing age, has witnessed this wondrous omen. I humbly offer a poem in praise, wishing to extol Your sagely influence. With reverence, I present a regulated verse of seven characters per line, four rhymes, in tribute to Your sacred virtue. I presume to offend Your august dignity, overwhelmed by awe.

**Memorial Congratulating the Execution of Liu Zhijun**

Your servant humbly notes that by Your August Decree, Liu Zhijun, for his persistent violence and cruelty, has been executed.

His crimes had reached their full measure, and both men and gods were outraged. Rightly did Your sagely judgment mete out stern punishment. Your servant rejoices with boundless joy, bowing his head in reverence.

Your servant reflects that Liu Zhijun was by nature treacherous and cunning, his abilities base and mediocre. His heart harbored the greed of a ravenous wolf, yet he lacked any intent to repay kindness or cherish grace. Driven by desperation, he submitted to our great court. You bestowed upon him the boundless mercy of rain and dew, then entrusted him with command and banner. Though his appointment was extraordinary, You placed unwavering trust in him. You further elevated him with the utmost favor, granting him sole authority over military campaigns.

Yet he raged with unbridled arrogance, his heart filled with cruelty. He slaughtered the common people, flouting laws and decrees. He subverted the court’s policy of pacification and betrayed Your sagely benevolence in punishing and comforting the realm. Having betrayed Your boundless mercy, he could not escape the manifest punishment.

Your servant reverently considers that Your Majesty’s benevolence spans heaven and earth, Your kindness surpasses that of Yao and Tang. Embracing the supreme Dao, You cherish life; spreading the warmth of spring, You illuminate all things. The barbarian tribes of the four directions all know the depth of Your compassion; the sun, moon, and stars all witness the vastness of Your magnanimity.

Yet Liu Zhijun alone defied Your sagely enterprise, wantonly wielding cruel punishments. His actions obstructed the distant lands’ path to enlightenment and hindered the four directions’ turn toward civilization. Now, the thunderous decree has struck, and the axe of execution has fallen. Thus, all under heaven rejoice in the virtue of eradicating evil and eliminating malevolence.

May the imperial lineage flourish through the ages, and the people forever enjoy blessings.

Your servant, [Name], having witnessed the majesty of Your celestial authority, is overwhelmed with boundless joy and exultation.

**Memorial Congratulating the Revival of Withered Cypress Trees at Crane Cry Mountain**

Your servant, [Name], humbly observes that Commissioner for Military Training of Qiongzhou, Zhang Jingzhou, has memorialized regarding the report from Guo Zhaomei, Master of Mysterious Unity at Crane Cry Mountain in Dayi County. Within an ancient cypress grove, seven withered trees, barren for many years, have suddenly revived, their branches and leaves flourishing with extraordinary vigor. The prefectural authorities dispatched officials to verify the phenomenon, confirming its authenticity.

A divine mountain’s auspicious omen, a propitious tree’s manifestation—this marvel attests to the resonance of Your sagely virtue and the flourishing nurturance of divine power. Your servant is utterly overjoyed, bowing his head in reverence again and again.

According to the *Auspicious Omens Record*: When an emperor’s virtue extends to plants and trees, and governance achieves great peace, pines and cypresses remain evergreen, and trees display wondrous anomalies. Your Majesty, having received the Mandate and inaugurated the era, holds the celestial tally and governs the realm. You cultivate civilizing influence to pacify distant lands and display martial prowess to quell the Nine Provinces. Your benevolence encompasses all vegetation, and Your kindness extends even to ants and insects. Remote barbarians untie their braids to embrace benevolence; fierce tribes scale mountains to present tribute. Thus, all beings, even the most alien, are moved by Your grace—snow hares and frost birds nest in close proximity, auspicious dragons and divine turtles appear as commonplace.

Now, at Jade Grotto’s cloud-capped peaks, the sacred site of ancient transformations—where, during the prosperous reign of the Han, the Heavenly Master cultivated the Dao—verdant forests stretch and misty vapors glow. Green cliffs bear the woven patterns of moss, where the celestial chariot’s tracks still linger in the air; emerald glades are carpeted with lush grass, where the alchemical altar of the crane-transformation remains. Yet before these crags stood ancient cypresses, withered and decayed for years. Now, bathed in rain and dew, they have revived in splendor, sprouting golden shoots and flourishing anew. Their towering boughs sway with verdant grace, their dense foliage casting deep shade. Even Wang Yi’s famed camphor trees cannot rival their luxuriance, nor can the immortal cypress of Lai Xiang match their auspiciousness. The revival of these seven cypresses heralds a reign of boundless longevity, a wonder unparalleled in ancient records.

Your servant, privileged to serve in this flourishing era, has frequently witnessed such felicitous omens. Daring to compose verses in celebration, I wish to proclaim Your virtue across the realm. With utmost reverence, I present a seven-character quatrain in four rhymes to extol Your sagely power and offer congratulations.

**Memorial Congratulating the Audience of Western Hu Monks**

Your servant humbly notes that monks from the Western Regions and India have arrived at court to pay homage. Your boundless compassion reaches distant lands, inspiring foreign realms to seek allegiance. Thus, monks from ten thousand *li* away come to pay tribute to a millennium’s sagely sovereign. Chinese and barbarians alike submit to Your transformative influence; all beings rejoice in unison.

Your servant offers his congratulations. Your Majesty, inheriting the sacred lineage and embodying the primordial, establishes the ultimate standard. Your benevolence blankets the Nine Lands, bestowing blessings upon all; Your governance extends to the Eight Wildernesses, fostering harmony and prosperity. Thus, all regions present tribute, and interpreters throng the court. Tribute arrives without fail each month, and chroniclers’ records never cease.

Now, from the distant Western Hu, beyond the snowy deserts and shifting sands, near the towering peaks and isles of deer, they gaze upon the clouds reaching the heavens and conceive the desire to journey toward the celestial light. Though their words require repeated translation and their path spans years, they brave rugged wilderness without hesitation, prostrating themselves to behold the radiance of Your sagely sun. Even Fotucheng, who entered Xia from the east of Khotan, or Kumarajiva, who followed the Qin from the north of Kucha, cannot surpass their arduous devotion. From the depths of a subject’s heart, this devotion arises solely from the inspiration of Your sagely brilliance. May this be forever inscribed in the national annals, amplifying Your sacred achievements.

Your servant, basking in the celestial light, is overwhelmed with gratitude.

**Memorial Presenting a Portrait of the Primordial Heavenly Worthy and Merit Record for the Longevity Festival**

Your servant humbly observes that the nine bends of the limpid river and the harmonious union of heaven and earth herald omens of flowing rainbows from starry islets and flying lightning from the Dipper’s pivot. Auspicious signs align with millennia of peace, and joy pervades the myriad states.

Your Majesty, grasping the celestial tally and receiving the Mandate, presides over the realm with upright authority. You propagate the supreme Dao, surpassing the Three Sovereigns, and disseminate the highest virtue, transcending the Five Emperors. Your transformative influence permeates seas and mountains; Your grace encompasses Chinese and barbarians alike. Those clad in felt and fur regularly present tribute; the Four Wildernesses and Eight Extremities all offer precious treasures. By harmonizing the Six Treasuries, heaven bestows extraordinary omens; by penetrating the Three Springs, earth manifests wondrous gifts. All are inscribed in jade scripts—golden carp leap through waves, frost-white beasts appear, snow-winged birds soar, sacred fungi and mushrooms burgeon, and fragrant dew glistens. Immortals are often seen amidst misty crags; steadfast cypresses flourish anew in clouded valleys. Jade granaries overflow with annual abundance; treasures stream in like rivers. No one is left destitute, and every household merits enfeoffment.

Thus, distant lands admire Your sagacity, and foreign realms submit to Your court. With joyful reverence, they celebrate Your transformative influence. From the Sanggan to the vast deserts, monks like Fazheng bow in homage to heaven; from Sindhu to Jibin, the Three Treasures of Buddhism offer tribute with sincere devotion. All gaze toward the North Star and pray for the longevity of the Southern Mountains.

Now, as the sun shines with ninefold radiance and the winds harmonize with the eight directions, the grand Longevity Festival of the flourishing spring arrives, marking Your sacred and prosperous birthday. I have reverently painted a portrait of the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, wishing to enhance Your sagely blessings. Together with the Daoist assembly of this abbey, I have established a seven-day and seven-night *Lingbao* Longevity Ritual beginning on the first day of this month, with pure incense, lamps, and devout recitations. May the efficacy of the wondrous Dao eternally secure Your boundless longevity.

I humbly present the aforementioned portrait and merit record, presuming to lay them before Your celestial wisdom.

**Memorial Thanking for the Bestowal of Purple Robes upon Lü Yanchang of Yangping Mountain**

Your servant has received the imperial decree bestowing purple robes upon Lü Yanchang, Master of Yangping Mountain, and appointing him as a Great Virtue for inner palace rituals. Your grace descends from the heavens, bestowing honor upon the mountain forests. Plants and trees radiate splendor; mist and clouds shimmer with color. All who dwell in these sacred precincts, whether robed in caps or coarse garments, share in the joy of this illustrious favor.

Your servant offers his profound gratitude. Your Majesty, with sagely wisdom, inaugurated the era and grasped the celestial tally to govern the realm. Your benevolence extends across the Nine Lands, bestowing blessings upon all; Your governance spreads to the Eight Wildernesses, perfecting the harmony of a flourishing age. Thus, all regions present tribute, and interpreters from distant lands attend the court.

At this propitious moment of celebrating the imperial longevity, marking the grand festival of the season of renewal, Your Majesty’s boundless grace extends to both teachings, showering imperial favor across the ten thousand regions. Lü Yanchang has long dwelled amidst mist and clouds, refining his skill in medicinal arts. Though he devoted himself solely to cultivation and repair, he dared not aspire to such honor and glory. Yet Your Majesty, mindful of meritorious ministers, deeply commended his mastery of the healing arts. When Lü Yanchang’s prescriptions achieved remarkable efficacy, saving the life of Yan Yin—whose grave illness was thus dispelled—You bestowed upon him the highest grace, publicly conferring the robes of office. Arrayed in rainbow-hued vestments and bearing the ivory tablet, he finds the debt of heaven and earth’s favor impossible to repay; with evening candles and morning incense, he vows to answer the radiance of Your sagely illumination. Your servant and the Daoist assembly are overwhelmed.

**Memorial Presenting a Twenty-Couplet Poem on the Arrival of Indian Monks**

Your servant observes that the three *samanta*s from the Western Heaven have arrived at court to pay homage. They have traversed jade passes to the north and crossed golden rivers to the west, their journey spanning layered frontiers and exceeding ten thousand *li*. Even Ban Chao’s expeditions reached only as far as Wusun, and Zhang Qian’s explorations extended no farther than Qinghai. Some paths wind through serpent-haunted deserts where human footprints vanish; others cross flying snow and shifting sands where horses’ hooves cannot tread. Thus, the reach of civilization has differed, and tribute from these lands has seldom been offered. Yet the white jade rings from Kunlun’s peaks first heralded auspicious omens, and the fiery jewels of Mount Zhong marked wondrous treasures. How much more so for those from Shendu, dwelling in the shadow of the Congling Mountains, or from Khotan, beyond the snow-crowned peaks—let alone the distant lands of India, whose arduous journey reflects their reverence. They admire the majesty of China’s myriad people and turn toward the sagely rule of Great Shu’s enlightened sovereign. Their single-minded devotion to paying homage is truly laudable in the annals of history.

Your Majesty, whose sagely essence embodies the heavens, has received the mandate to inaugurate an era. Your virtue surpasses that of Fuxi and Zhuanxu; Your benevolence eclipses that of Yao and Tang. Through civil virtue, You govern the remote frontiers; through martial prowess, You pacify the seas and lands. Thus, the western tribes submit in allegiance, and all under heaven acknowledge their rightful lord. To the south, the lands of Jiaozhi are connected; to the north, the peoples of the yurts are gathered. Tribute and offerings arrive without fail, year after year.

In the intervals of governance, You bestow blessings from the heavens, promoting and honoring both the Daoist and Buddhist teachings. Monasteries stand resplendent in their purity; Daoist temples gleam in their splendor. With unified devotion, both traditions flourish. The immortals of the Purple Cloud Grotto manifest auspicious signs, while the foreign monks of India present tribute—all drawn by Your sagely influence to bless the imperial realm. The ministers of the land and the officials of the court share in the joy, dancing in celebration.

Your servant, a humble scholar of the mushroom fields and a solitary wanderer of the clouded peaks, has been graced by Your celestial kindness to proclaim this luminous decree. With reverence, I have composed a twenty-couplet poem in seven-character lines in praise of Your sagely virtue and now present it, daring to intrude upon Your imperial majesty. I am overwhelmed with awe and trepidation.

**Memorial Congratulating the Enfeoffment of Prince Zi as Prince Zhong**

The imperial rescript descends in radiant splendor, and rituals proceed with illustrious clarity. The ancestral temple bestows felicity, while the realm rejoices in exultation.

With reverence, I offer my congratulations. May it please Your Imperial Majesty, whose benevolence extends boundless love and whose Dao cherishes steadfast renewal. You prolong the jade calendar to perpetuate prosperity and fortify the jasper branches for enduring greatness. The phoenix-script confers mandate, and the unicorn’s hooves add luster. Joyous qi ascends to the crimson heavens, while glory gathers at the vermilion palace.

Your servant, blessed to witness this sagely era and gaze upon Your majestic presence, is overwhelmed with awe.

**Memorial Congratulating the Naming of the Newly Constructed Tianxi Hall**
Your servant prostrates to acknowledge the imperial decree bestowing the name *Tianxi Hall* upon the newly completed palace within the Great Interior. The august residence is renewed, and a resplendent name is graciously conferred. Both within and beyond the realm, all rejoice in admiration, while Hua and Yi alike exult.

With reverence, I offer my congratulations. May it please Your Imperial Majesty, who holds the pivot of governance and wields the Dipper to extend the hem of Your robe. You encompass the nine lands in sovereign rule and open the four gates to foster harmony. Modeling the heavens in construction, You elevate the imperial abode in the capital; spanning the earth in foundation, You fortify the royal residence for myriad generations. Thus, the gates of the Vermilion Phoenix stretch afar, and the Dragon Court expands in grandeur. Gathering the pure radiance of sun and moon, its towering gates stand majestic; assembling the auspicious hues of stars and constellations, its literary halls open wide. Lofty and towering, it presses upon the realms of Shen and Jing; soaring and precipitous, it mirrors the forms of Di and Fang. None but that mountain spirits flew boulders, river lords contributed timber, men came forth as sons to labor, and divine aid lent its strength. Though the palaces of Hao and Lu were refined, they pale in comparison; though the halls of Han and Zhou were grand, they cannot rival this. Now that the work is complete, a precious plaque is newly bestowed. The divine is revealed by the Supreme Mystery, aligning with the Celestial Bestowal; the vast design shines to the eight extremities, eternally proclaiming Your sagely achievement. Here, You survey the seas and mountains to inspect treasures, and assemble the feudal lords to receive the homage of all nations. Great rites shall be performed to bless the myriad regions. May the divine and luminous assist in this era, and may the longevity of heaven and earth be extended.

Your servant, honored to bask in this sagely light and gaze upon this divine work, is overwhelmed with awe.

**Memorial Congratulating the Gradual Recovery of the Sacred Body**
Your servant humbly reports that, since yesterday, the Sacred Body has swiftly returned to peace and recovery. Your servant is filled with boundless joy and exultation, bowing his head again and again.

With reverence, I reflect upon Your Imperial Majesty, whose profound benevolence governs the realm and whose supreme Dao extends like the hem of a robe. Grace blankets the ten thousand regions, and favor encompasses all beings. Day and night, You toil with vigilance, Your labor straining the harmony of sinews and skin; from dawn to dusk, You don robes and attend to affairs, Your concern spanning the shifts of cold and warmth. Now, the numinous and unseen assist, mountains and rivers offer their efficacy, the ancestral temple bestows auspices, and the Dark Vault descends blessings. The Sacred Rest is restored, further enhancing the brilliance of rain and sunlight; vast felicity is embraced, perpetuating the longevity of ten thousand years. Hua and Yi rejoice in delight, and the myriad peoples raise a chorus of joy.

Your servant, afflicted with an eye ailment for over ten days, has been unable to hasten to the jade palace, dance upon the celestial steps, or gaze toward the misty heavens. I am overwhelmed with awe and trepidation.

**Memorial Congratulating the Recovery from Illness**
Your servant humbly reports that the Sacred Body has fully recovered, and all ministers within and beyond the realm leap for joy. Your servant is filled with boundless exultation, bowing his head again and again.

I have heard that even the five planets in their celestial courses may deviate in motion, and the four seasons in their cycles may falter in their transitions of cold and warmth. Though the discord of cold and heat may arise, it is but the natural order of yin and yang. With reverence, I reflect upon Your Imperial Majesty, who governs in accord with the seasons and rules with virtue. The myriad affairs weigh upon Your imperial heart, and the six qi occasionally disrupt the Sacred Body. Now, the divine and numinous align in assistance, the ancestral temple bestows auspices, vast celestial blessings gather, and the Sacred Rest is swiftly restored. Thus, You inherit the unified rule of Tang Yao and extend the distant longevity of Zhou’s emperors. Rewards are bestowed upon the physicians for their skill, and grace flows throughout the realm; drums resound for all beings, and their echoes shake the layered heavens.

Your servant, since the third month, has been afflicted with illness and unable to join the dance upon the steps of Yao, overwhelmed with joy and trepidation.

**Memorial Expressing Gratitude for the Imperial Edict**
Your servant humbly reports that today, I received the imperial edict bestowing a personal decree in reward for my memorial of the eleventh of this month, congratulating the recovery of the Sacred Body. Grace descends from the imperial throne, and purple seals convey favor. I look up to the celestial mandate and am humbled by the imperial consolation.

Your servant, though coarse and rustic, is fortunate to stand among the ranks. Though I daily pray for the Dragon Diagram in my devotions, I should hasten morning and night to the Phoenix Gate. Yet, afflicted by illness, I have been absent from court. Yesterday, learning that Your Imperial Majesty, burdened by the myriad affairs of state, had briefly fallen ill but swiftly recovered, I bowed my head in joy and dispatched a memorial in celebration. Such is the humble duty of one in my position, a routine observance of the ranks. Never did I expect the imperial grace to bestow this purple edict. I have reverently burned incense and knelt to receive it, overwhelmed by the sight of heaven and the weight of Your sagely favor.

**Memorial Expressing Gratitude for the Bestowal of Funds for the Daoist Ritual**
Your servant humbly reports that today, I received the imperial decree bestowing twenty strings of cash from the imperial treasury for the Daoist ritual held at the Three Clarities Altar in this abbey since the twenty-first of last month. There, the elder masters and Daoist assembly gathered to perform the *Lingbao* scripture recitation and disaster-dispelling rites for Your Imperial Majesty.

From the central court, favor is bestowed; from the inner treasury, wealth is granted. I look up to the celestial kindness and inscribe this humble gratitude in my heart.

**Memorial Expressing Gratitude for the Bestowal of Funds**
Your servant humbly prostrates in gratitude. As one presumptuously entrusted with the role of teaching master, I have deeply received the nation’s grace. All daily rites and devotions are but the fulfillment of my duty. Never did I expect Your sagely favor to descend as private beneficence. Gazing upon the dragon countenance of heaven’s Son, my awe for Your sagely virtue redoubles; cradling the imperial treasury’s *e-yan* coins, my prayers for Your longevity grow ever more fervent. The funds bestowed have been received in full with reverent kneeling and distributed to the Daoist assembly. Your servant and the Daoist community are overwhelmed with gratitude, trembling with devotion.

**Memorial Congratulating the Heir’s Ascension to the Throne**
Your servant reports that today, the imperial heir has assumed the precious throne, illuminating the grand enterprise. The realm rejoices, and all under heaven exults. Your servant offers his congratulations.

I have heard that when King Cheng succeeded to the throne, he upheld the illustrious governance of a thousand generations; when Emperor Shun inherited the mandate, he became the model for a hundred kings. Above, he accorded with heaven’s decree; below, he harmonized with the people’s will. Now, I reflect upon Your Imperial Majesty: Your Dao rivals that of Tang, Your benevolence equals that of Yu. Your virtue aligns with the five planets, Your destiny resonates with the two poles. Thus, You have worthily inherited the ancestral legacy and gloriously ascended the precious throne. The imperial mandate shines with renewal, the grand foundation heralds an era of enduring prosperity. May the realm be unified in script and axle, the Chinese and barbarians dwell in peace. May the nine lands see horses return to the mountains, the four seas know no whales crossing their expanse. May the imperial order be upheld, the great enterprise forever secure.

Your servant, honored by this flourishing era, has been counted among the court’s ranks. Though I strive to emulate the sun-bearing devotion of the loyal, my joy is but that of a turtle’s dance; though I harbor the regret of one who once lay by the Zhang River, I cannot match the swift flight of the wild duck. I am overwhelmed with reverence, leaping with devotion.

**Memorial Congratulating the Proclamation of a Virtuous Decree**
Your servant reports that today, the Emperor ascended the throne to proclaim a virtuous decree. I have heard that sagely virtue emulates heaven, its timely governance ever attuned to nurturing life; divine merit embodies the Dao, its seasonal blessings fostering growth. None are untouched by its grace—from the nine tribes to the myriad states, all under heaven’s cover and earth’s bearing rejoice as one.

Your servant offers his congratulations. I reflect upon Your Imperial Majesty: enthroned at the center of the realm, Your gaze spans all under heaven. You practice frugality, leaving the thatched eaves untrimmed; You cultivate the spirit, holding the golden mirror aloft. Thus, the distant frontiers of Yan and the barren wastes beyond submit tribute like clouds; the remote lands of Jilin and the ends of the earth gather like mist, their ships and ladders converging. Your rule rests in non-action, and the people delight in the Dao.

Now, You broadly proclaim virtuous teachings, aligning with the true yang. You pacify the remnant peoples beyond the borders, raising them to a realm of longevity; You ascend the newly built hall of heavenly bestowal, fanning the fragrant winds. You console the toil of frontier soldiers, remit the arrears of taxes in prefectures and counties. Exiles and banished officials alike receive the grace of pardon; prisoners in fetters are all embraced by the lenient and enlightened statutes. Through the threefold amnesty, all shall be as one.

Your servant, bound by illness, cannot join the ranks to dance upon the jade steps. I am overwhelmed with joy, leaping with devotion.

**Another Memorial Congratulating the Proclamation of a Virtuous Decree**
Your servant reports that today, the Emperor ascended the throne to proclaim a virtuous decree. Thunder and rain dissolve the drought, abundant blessings flow without end, ensuring no land is left untouched and all living beings dwell in peace. The multitudes of Hua and Yi, the countless millions—who does not rejoice?

Your servant offers his congratulations. I reflect upon Your Imperial Majesty: inheriting sagacity and continuing enlightenment, You grasp the charts and rule the realm. Your filial piety, vast as steam rising, rivals that of Emperor Hui of Han in upholding the ancestral temple; Your reverence, meticulous and humble, equals that of King Cheng of Zhou in ascending the throne. In civil matters, You cherish distant customs; in martial affairs, You pacify remote frontiers. Embracing the *qian* hexagram, Your transformative influence knows no bounds; emerging from the *zhen* hexagram, Your benevolence is complete and unbroken.

Now, You govern with serene majesty, proclaiming grace from the central hall. You pacify the people beyond the borders, raising them to a realm of longevity; You shower the realm with heavenly virtue, fanning the fragrant winds. Moved by the hardships of conscripted soldiers, You release the arrears of taxes and levies. Exiles and prisoners alike receive the private grace of amnesty, all benefiting from the lenient and enlightened statutes. Joyful voices resound beyond the borders, jubilant spirits float among the clouds. May the realm be unified in axle and script, awaiting the return to oneness. May the jade charts and celestial calendars endure for a thousand springs.

Your servant, though aged and infirm, has personally witnessed this sagely reign. Yet, afflicted by illness, I cannot dance upon the steps of Yao. Gazing longingly at Your heavenly kindness, I am overwhelmed with joy, leaping with devotion.

---

**Memorial Expressing Gratitude for the Imperial Response**
Your servant reports that I have received the imperial rescript, which graciously responded to my memorial of the second day of this month congratulating Your accession to the throne. Favor descends from the vermilion heavens, bestowing honor upon the Daoist teachings. The five-colored imperial edict emerges from the immortal precincts, resplendent; the nine-rayed sun shines upon the fields of magic mushrooms, luminous.

Overwhelmed by this honor, I am at a loss, my joy boundless. Your servant humbly prostrates in gratitude. I reflect upon Your Imperial Majesty: the pearl balance brings forth auspicious omens, the jade dipper unfurls divine power. Emerging from the *zhen* domain, You renew the light; inheriting the *qian* pivot, You ascend as the sagely heir. Your virtue surpasses that of the ancient sages, Your filial piety vast as You govern with folded arms; Your brilliance continues the illustrious legacy, Your great luminosity reigning over the realm. Profound grace spreads afar, abundant blessings extend everywhere. Joyful voices shake the earth like thunder, jubilant spirits condense in the sky like a canopy. The multitudes of Hua and Yi turn toward the sun, gazing at the clouds.

Your servant, constrained by age and affliction, cannot approach the dragon steps to present my pure devotion or join the ranks in the beast dance. Yet, I offered my sealed memorial from afar, humbly expressing my sincerity. Never did I expect such exalted praise, the imperial rescript descending like heavenly script. The auspicious dew of virtuous conduct glistens, the fragrant clouds of imperial favor gather. Holding the response, I feel the weight of Mount Song and Mount Heng insufficient; moved by grace, I find the depths of the four seas inadequate. Though as insignificant as the wren, I cannot repay the boundless heavens and earth.

The imperial rescript bestowed has been reverently received with incense and kneeling. I am overwhelmed with gratitude, bearing the sagely favor.

**Memorial Requesting the Imperial Edict for the Major Mourning Rites**
Your servant kowtows repeatedly. Time passes unceasingly, and the late Emperor has now reached the major mourning rites. I reflect upon Your Imperial Majesty: in grief and longing, Your sagely heart is inconsolable. Above, You honor the ancestral temple; below, You comply with the will of the countless. By observing the great rites, You forever bless the Hua and Yi.

Your servant, bound by age and illness, cannot join the ranks to offer condolences.

Your servant is overwhelmed with grief, prostrate and trembling beyond measure. I humbly submit this memorial to offer condolences.

**Memorial on the Release from Mourning Attire**
Your servant kowtows repeatedly. Time passes unceasingly, and the late Emperor’s passing seems but yesterday, now having completed the rites of mourning. I reflect upon Your Imperial Majesty: in eternal longing and grief, Your sagely heart is inconsolable. The four seas and all subjects have fulfilled the mourning rites. Gazing at the heavens, I am left helpless; treading the earth, I find no place for myself. Your servant, bound by age and illness, cannot hasten to the palace to express my sorrow. I am overwhelmed with choking grief and longing beyond measure. I humbly submit this memorial to offer condolences.

**Memorial on the Bestowal of the Temple Name and Posthumous Title**
Your servant states: On this day of the present month, the late Emperor’s exalted posthumous title and temple name have been conferred. I reflect upon the late Emperor: born in response to Heaven’s mandate, he rode the tide of destiny to unfold his great enterprise. His robes, grand as those of Feng and Pei, surpassed the merits of the Han founder; his virtue, like the branches of Bin and Qi, exceeded the benevolence of King Wen of Zhou. He embodied the name of Tang Yao, who aided the virtuous, and followed the illustrious title of Yu Shun, whose brilliance shone forth. Now, as we honor his exalted posthumous title, we extol his sagely achievements. All within the realm grieve as one, moved by shared sorrow. I reflect upon Your Majesty: boundless in grief, You govern with filial piety. Gazing upon the imperial regalia, You find no solace; receiving the decree, Your sorrow deepens. All under heaven share in this profound mourning.

**Memorial on the Opening of the Temporary Palace**
Your servant states: I have learned that on this day of the present month, the temporary palace of the late Emperor has been opened. Princes and ministers are wrapped in sorrow; the six palaces resound with wailing. I reflect upon Your Majesty: in grief and longing, Your sagely heart is inconsolable. Facing the imperial regalia, Your sorrow grows; reflecting on the fleeting light, You are lost in mourning. Your servant, bound by age and illness, cannot join the ranks in lamentation. I am overwhelmed with grief, prostrate and trembling beyond measure.

**Memorial on the Completion of the Ancestral Temple Rites**
Your servant kowtows repeatedly. I have learned that the rites for the late Emperor’s enshrinement in the ancestral temple have been completed. The rites honor the ancestral sacrifices, and the order of generations is duly observed. By upholding the solemn ceremonies, the divine merits shine forth. I reflect upon Your Majesty: in reverence for the ritual classics and devotion to filial virtue, You have established the proper rites of spring and autumn sacrifices, and the grand ceremonies of offering to Heaven and serving the ancestors. May these great blessings forever grace the sacred temple. All under heaven share in this profound mourning and longing.

**Memorial on the Naming of the Imperial Mausoleum**
Your servant kowtows repeatedly. I have witnessed the late Emperor’s mausoleum being named [X] Mausoleum. I reflect upon the late Emperor: his birth was marked by auspicious omens, his reign guided by celestial signs. Grasping the primal *qi* of Heaven, he inaugurated his dynasty; expanding the wilds of Earth, he laid its foundations. He disdained the trifling divisions of Wu and Wei, extending his transformative grace; aspiring to unify Hua and Yi, he sought to harmonize all under one rule. The naming of his mausoleum fittingly accords with his sagely virtue. I reflect upon Your Majesty: inheriting the weighty duty of succession, You honor the past while advancing the legacy. Illuminating his enduring merits, You enhance the splendor of these grand rites. Gazing upon his virtuous footsteps, Your sagely heart finds slight solace. All ministers share in this profound sorrow and longing.

**Memorial on the Procession of the Imperial Funeral Cortege**
Your servant states: I reflect upon the late Emperor’s spirit chariot, which sets forth on this day of the present month. Heaven and Earth mingle in sorrow; sun and moon lose their light. All subjects grieve as one; clouds and mist darken in mourning. Your servant is crushed with grief, choking with sorrow, and kowtows repeatedly. I reflect upon Your Majesty: Your filial devotion knows no bounds, and Your sagely heart is inconsolable. As the divine chariot grows ever more distant, the sound of the funeral dirge deepens Your sorrow. In ceaseless longing, Your lamentation is unbearable.

**Memorial Congratulating the Emperor on Resuming Court Audience After Ascension**
Your servant states: I have learned that on the ninth day of this month, the Emperor ascended the Mingde Hall to hold court. The regalia and banners were first arrayed upon the jade steps; the ranks of officials, like soaring cranes and egrets, stood in formation upon the jeweled terrace.

The realm rejoices as one, and the world celebrates in unison. Your servant is filled with boundless joy and leaps with exultation, kowtowing repeatedly. I reflect upon Your Imperial Majesty: born of the Nine Heavens, Your sagely might governs the Seven Celestial Luminaries. Grasping the jade Dipper, You guide the celestial dragon to bring peace to the Four Seas; holding the jade sighting-tube, You oversee the great cosmos to shepherd the myriad regions. You have unfolded the civil brilliance of the ancient sage-kings and cultivated the virtue and power of the former monarchs. Now, the clouds part to reveal the azure vault, and all revere the Pole Star’s majesty; the mists disperse over the boundless sea, and all pay homage to the radiance of the Great Luminance. Your grace extends without limit, and Your benevolence flows without end. Though I, Your servant, remain distant in the fields of immortals, I am honored to witness this auspicious era. Moved by sorrowful verses, I grieve my inability to hasten to the Han palace. Gazing toward the sky of Yao, I cannot contain my exultant joy, my fervent delight, my overwhelming emotion.

**Memorial Offering Consolation Upon the Completion of the Imperial Mausoleum**
Your servant states: I have learned that the rites for the mausoleum of the Late Emperor are now complete. The divine palace is sealed forever, and the immortal chamber rests in eternal peace. All within the realm, unable to bear their lamentation, grieve as one. I reflect upon Your Imperial Majesty: Your longing knows no respite, and Your sagely heart is inconsolable. Facing the grave mound, sorrow deepens; grasping the dragon’s whiskers, Your grief is everlasting. The traveling robes remain, yet the divine chariot has long since departed. Recalling His majesty and might, my sorrow and longing are beyond measure. Your servant, confined by frailty and illness, cannot attend to offer consolation at the palace gates. I am overwhelmed with grief, choking with sorrow.

**Memorial Requesting Permission Not to Attend the Imperial Mausoleum**
Your servant states: I have learned that the mausoleum is near completion, and Your Imperial Majesty, in boundless grief and longing, wishes to attend the tomb in person. I have reverently heard the imperial decree, and it has struck terror into the hearts of all. Every subject under Your radiance is filled with dread and confusion. Your servant is truly alarmed and fearful, kowtowing repeatedly. I humbly consider: the filial piety of emperors and kings follows Heaven, accords with the people, and adheres to principle in establishing rites, ensuring that all living beings conform and the ancestral temples remain eternally secure. Never has it been heard that one should express filial devotion through the sorrow of bow and sword or emulate the solitary conduct of Zeng and Min. To suddenly mobilize the imperial guard and personally oversee the rites would be unprecedented. I reflect upon Your Imperial Majesty: examining the ancient rituals of the hundred kings and adhering to the established precedents of successive dynasties, may You turn Your sagely gaze and align with the principles of ritual propriety. By following the universal norms of antiquity, You will set a model for future rulers, further manifesting the principles of filial governance and consoling the realm. Your servant, unable to contain his earnest and fervent plea, respectfully presents this memorial to make his request known.

*End of Volume Three of the* Guangcheng Collection
*Volume Four of the* Guangcheng Collection *begins*

The Most Reverend Du Guangting, Grand Master of Imperial Compositions, Purple-Robed Virtue of the Supreme Clarity Palace in the Upper Capital, has composed the *Ritual Petition for the Promotion and Deliverance of the Perfected* on behalf of Minister of Revenue, Duke Zhang, for the advancement of the departed.

Your servant has learned that the Supreme One unfolded the sacred diagrams, and the Primordial Sovereign expounded the teachings. The Three Registers established the golden and luminous canons, their merit extending to humans and heavens; the Nine Dark Realms suspended the jade tablets of ordinances, their grace encompassing the living and the dead. Tracing the purport of the scriptures and adhering to the mysterious texts, I humbly beseech the mercy of promotion and deliverance, and thus prepare this earnest petition of repentance.

On the twenty-fifth day of this month falls the death anniversary of my late mother, Lady Liu, Tang Dynasty Lady of Chu State, posthumously honored as Grand Lady of Song State by the Former Shu. On the thirtieth day of this month falls the death anniversary of my late father, former Tang Chancellor and Grand Preceptor to the Crown Prince, posthumously honored as Grand Commandant by the Former Shu.

With reverence, I present offerings of oil, candles, incense, and alms, to be consecrated at the Northern Emperor Cloister of the Jade Bureau in Chengdu Prefecture, where a *Lingbao* *Mingzhen* ritual will be performed for one day and one night. Fourteen Daoist priests will conduct the Dao at three intervals and recite the scriptures at three intervals. Baring my heart before the celestial patterns, I dispatch the fragrant dragon to present this petition on high.

May the Most Exalted One deign to look with compassion, and may the host of sages bestow their radiance, universally notifying the Four Offices and informing the Three Realms. May the Nine Dragon Mandates descend, unlocking the cold courts of eternal night, refining and bathing the forms and souls, promoting and delivering the divine spirits. May they depart the palace of dark yin and enter the palace of cavernous yang. May transgressions and faults be absolved, grievances and enmities dissolved. May their names be stricken from the earthly registers and inscribed upon the ranks of the Dao. May they revolve toward the land of blessings and ascend to the ranks of immortals. May the ninefold dark consciousnesses all attain transcendence.

I vow to cultivate devotion with diligence, repaying the grace of the true numina above.

*Ritual Petition for the Yellow Register Retreat at the Residence of the Grand Lady of the Zhang Clan*

I reflect that the wondrous Dao and its mysterious efficacy aid the times and assist the state. The true scriptures and their secret purport rescue beings and save humanity.

At the inception of the cosmic order, ere the passage of countless kalpas, the vast transformation of the Dao unfolded across the ten thousand heavens. Those who honor it store blessings and receive protection; those who cultivate it ride the radiant clouds and ascend at dawn. Through the ages, its luminous canon and sacred decrees have shone forth. The Zhang clan has inherited auspicious favor, its fortune aligned with sagely brilliance. Bathed in celestial light, they reflect the splendor of imperial grace. Mindful of their allotted portion, they ever hold reverent caution, examining themselves and ever heeding bright admonitions. Yet they fear that the accumulated blemishes of past lives remain unrepented, and the encumbrances of this existence may deepen. In the shadowy yin, there are registers of litigation; in the obscure void, there are ledgers of life’s reckoning.

Moreover, this year for the Zhang clan, the celestial tally descends upon the Wood Tomb position, while dark stars lodge in the year of Flying Transformation. Mars shines upon the Palace of Self, still clashing with their inherent nature. The great fortune meets the ascendant Metal, its fire power somewhat diminished; the minor fortune resides in the realm of generating Metal, its Wood qi already attenuated. Reflecting upon this convergence of adversities, their anxiety redoubles. Yet the boundless Dao knows no limit in bestowing grace universally. Thus, with earnest devotion, they offer prayers, assured of receiving blessings and felicity. Therefore, they purify their cinnabar hearts and undertake the Yellow Register Retreat. Arraying the ritual in solemn ranks before the jade altar, they unfold its sacred contents. Presenting their sincerity to the myriad heavens, they kindle orchid lamps through the midnight hours; proclaiming their vows to the Three Realms, they waft sandalwood and orchid incense through the nine watches. With earnest supplication, they beseech mercy and repentance.

They humbly implore the Most High and the myriad sages and perfected ones to look upon their prayers with compassion and manifest their abundant grace. May they command the celestial and terrestrial bureaus, the yin officials and yang offices, to strike their names from the black registers and inscribe them in the azure palace. May debts and litigations be harmonized, grievances and enmities dissolved. May the Northern Capital remove the records of confrontation and deception, extending their years; may the Southern Culmen fix the tally of prolonged life, ensuring prosperity and longevity. May the Five Phases dispel the texts of disaster and stagnation, and the Nine Luminaries cease their baleful influences. May they ever rejoice in the sunlit days of Shun and forever thrive under the heavens of Yao. May their kin enjoy peace and well-being, their descendants loyalty and filial piety. May the ninefold dark consciousnesses and the seven generations of ancestors, along with all departed forebears—whether bound in the gloomy thoroughfares or yet to ascend the path of blessings—by the power of the Dao swiftly attain rebirth. May the living receive blessings and assuredly meet with true felicity. May all beings in the three paths and six destinies, dwelling in the cold realms of the night, through the bond of repentance and purification, fully attain the fruit of liberation. May the yin and yang officers, the dragon spirits of the residence, long delight in tranquility, and may misfortune and decline be extinguished.

Above all, may the imperial domain expand afar, the sagely lifespan extend boundlessly. May its years surpass those of the Zhou, its prosperity exceed that of the Han. May the world be unified, its scripts and chariot-tracks harmonized. May all hearts turn toward the sun with reverence, and all bathe in the blessings bestowed from heaven.

*Ritual Petition for the Yellow Register Retreat by the Attendant for Ritual Protection and Blessing*

I have heard that the Dao, in its fundamental non-action, descends primordial essence to generate the Two Modes; from these modes arise numbers, which array the Five Wefts and complete the myriad forms. Earth aligns with heaven, never deviating from the celestial patterns; yang expands and yin contracts, all dependent upon their regulation. Thus, good and evil cycle endlessly, fortune and misfortune lie in wait. The firmness of Qian and the receptivity of Kun cannot avert the appointed times of nine and six; the moon’s orb and the sun’s wheel cannot alter the waxing and waning of their phases. How much more so for the two poles, endowed with their natures, and the three destinies, fixed at birth? Before transcending the mechanism of transformation, they are inherently subject to the principle of change. Therefore, one should ever hold caution in the heart, examine faults and recognize errors. Constantly rousing oneself with diligent effort, one may hope to move the gaze of the true numina.

Your servant has long received the shade of the mysterious, early bathed in abundant favor. My fortune has aligned with sagely brilliance, and I have presumptuously received esteemed appointment. Though I have striven to offer loyal service, my efforts to aid and succor remain unfulfilled; though I have supported the sagely and upheld heaven, I have repeatedly received surpassing grace. Entrusted with the seal of the altar and the insignia of office, my commission has grown ever more exalted. Leading the army with the green sash, my honors have deepened. Yet I fear that in fullness lies peril, and how may I repay the sovereign and father? I still dread that in action and stillness, I may fall short of my allotted portion; in thought and deed, I may offend the divine. Perhaps in public affairs, I have erred in rewards and punishments; in leading the multitude, I have faltered in judgment. Or perhaps the transgressions of past lives remain unresolved, or the karmic debts of accumulated lives unremoved. Any such failing must be repented and purified.

Moreover, this year, both major and minor fortunes converge upon the Tomb position, while the Flying Palace still encounters Mars. Though I reside in the direction of the Flowery Canopy, where fortune and virtue abide, I fear the baleful influences of punishment and conflict. With such trepidation, my earnest sincerity redoubles. In the midst of the Xu clan’s yearly fortunes, there are also stagnations. Both major and minor fortunes see the Metal and Fire qi diminished; the Flying Palace meets Ketu, and the celestial tally descends upon the birth month. Fearing these portents of disaster and stagnation, I am resolved to repent and pray. Thus, I reverently prepare the tokens of sincerity and devoutly undertake the retreat. Following the standards of the Mysterious Capital, I establish the Yellow Register ritual arena. For two days and six watches, I array fragrant flowers and summon the true sages from all heavens and earths. Concentrating spirit and fixing intent, I pour forth my earnest supplication.

I humbly implore the myriad sages to turn their light and the host of perfected ones to bestow their gaze, moved by my sincere devotion to grant blessings and felicity. May they absolve the sins and blemishes of the past and dispel the adversities to come. May the bright stars and dark luminaries bring no baleful influences; may the Three Destinies and Five Phases remove the clashes and obstacles. May grievances be harmonized, litigations dissolved. May descendants flourish, longevity and prosperity increase. May the ninefold dark consciousnesses receive blessings, the gloom of night be illuminated. May kin enjoy peace, dragon spirits rest in contentment. Above all, may the sagely person enjoy boundless longevity, the great enterprise ever flourish. May the voice of instruction spread to the nine regions, all rejoicing in the grace of Shun; may the scripts and chariots be unified to the eight extremities, all delighting in the benevolence of Yao. May the hundred grains abound, the six qi flow harmoniously. I vow to offer utmost loyalty and filial piety, repaying the sagely and enlightened grace; to rouse my sincerity, looking up to the protection of the true numina.

*Ritual Petition for the Yellow Register Retreat by Shangguan Zirong*

I reflect that the vast power of the Dao and its wondrous efficacy, the utmost truth and mysterious resonance, flow blessings according to circumstance and extend mercy in response to prayers. Aiding the state and saving the people, their grace encompasses all beings; dispelling disaster and bestowing fortune, their kindness reaches both the manifest and the hidden.

All petitions here raised shall surely receive luminous scrutiny. The petitioner, [Name] Clan, fears that within the cycles of major and minor fate this year, the Three Lifespans may wane; amid the configurations of yin-yang and celestial lodgings, the Five Planets may exert baleful influence. Thus disaster and misfortune arise, with no recourse for supplication. Having heard of the wondrous efficacy of the Yellow Register Retreat—its merit vast, its power dissolving all calamities and averting all misfortunes—I pour forth my sincerity, hoping to receive the mysterious protection. Reverently following the ritual statutes, I establish the altar precinct: three days of incense and lamps, nine intervals of repentance and thanksgiving. The utmost truth responds in hidden ways, and every entreaty finds its answer. I humbly pray that the Three Realms’ heavens, the lofty perfected, and the host of sages descend boundless grace and extend the sheltering favor of broad coverage. For the [Name] Clan, may they dissolve accumulated transgressions of past lives and debts of enmity from many rebirths. As repentance is offered, may they be smoothed away; as the hour arrives, may they be swept clean. May kinfolk dwell in peace and stability, public and private affairs flourish in harmony. I vow to offer utmost loyalty and filial piety, forever upholding the sagely mandate.

*Ritual Petition for the Yellow Register Retreat by Feilong Tangyi, Minister of the Secretariat*

I have heard that in the primordial stillness, at the origin of the undifferentiated, the Dao gave birth to the primal qi, which divided into the Two Modes. Yin and yang differ in ascent and descent; purity and turbidity distinguish immortals from mortals. Thus the Purple Clarity’s golden gates stand high in the court of supreme mystery, while the Yellow Axis’ wind barrier guards the nethermost depths. As beings are stained by delusion, doubts of advance and retreat arise; as they drift in sinking and floating, the pain of dispersal follows. Lacking prior awakening, they must rely on guidance. The August Lord of the Dao, in the final years of the Eastern Han, opened the treasure canon of the Southern Palace, first transmitting the true registers to greatly deliver all beings. Those who cultivate it ride the clouds and soar into emptiness; those who practice it aid the people and assist the state. Some quell the vapors of disorder, some chastise and reform malevolent spirits. They rectify the celestial origins of sun and moon, harmonizing wind and clouds with the seasons; they pacify disasters and perversities in the earth’s records, ensuring the growth of plants without fault. Revered through the ages, their blessings are inexhaustible. I have long received the shelter of the Dao and enjoyed the emperor’s grace. Though my merit is slight, the profound favor grows ever deeper; though my strength is weak, the debt to ruler and parents remains unpaid. I constantly aspire to receive the secret registers and honor the sacred texts, diligently tending the incense and lamps from dawn to dusk, rousing my devotion in prayer and supplication. I hope that state and family alike may receive blessings and good fortune. Now, having strictly prepared the ritual offerings, I reverently open the altar ground, repenting and purifying through the night, prostrating in homage and taking refuge. Orchid lamps illuminate the nine nether realms by night; sandalwood incense ascends to the Three Realms by morning. With earnest reverence, I send forth my plea, hoping it reaches the august numina. I humbly invoke the Most High Three Honored Ones, the August Lord of the Primordial Dao, the sages of the ten directions, and the mighty deities of the Three Caverns: may they perceive my sincere devotion and grant responsive efficacy. May the divine officials and true qi bestow transmission, enabling inner protection of bodily peace and outer resolution of disasters and obstacles. May my name be entered in the registers of the Dao, my sins erased in the courts of darkness. May the Nine Mysteries depart the realm of accumulated night, forever dwelling in eternal joy; may the entire clan enjoy boundless goodness, ever serving the radiant and luminous. May lifespan extend far, public and private affairs know purity and prosperity. Above, I pray that the dragon charts endure long, the phoenix calendar extend in grandeur. May the sagely lifespan increase without limit, heaven and earth share eternal duration; may imperial grace spread to all bounds, seas and mountains know peace. Together may we embody the wind of the utmost Dao, jointly flourish in the transformation of non-action.

*Ritual Petition for the Retreat at Mount Qingcheng by the Crown Prince*

I have heard that the rules of the Numinous Treasure, through fasting and purification, evoke the signs of the subtle and formless; the sacred texts establish teachings, linking conduct and concealment to the work of cultivation. All begin in the heart and expand through the Dao. Above, they can reverently entreat the celestial vault, illuminating the mysterious and subtle; next, they can proclaim sincerity and extend blessings and protection. Reflecting on my pure faith, I dare to offer reverent devotion. I humbly consider that the emperor, carving out territory and establishing the foundation, models heaven in his sheltering care. He pacified chaos and inherited the virtue of earth; he elucidated truth and responded to the phase of metal. With utmost caution, he has borne the fear of treading on thin ice; with unceasing vigilance, he has endured the toil of wind and rain. Through the passing years, his reverence has only grown. Thus the land enjoys abundant harvests, the state wealth and military strength. He secured the borders of Shu and Han, controlled the strategic passes of Qian and Wu. In civil and martial arts alike, he ordered the constant norms; in utmost impartiality and fairness, he exalted the roots of governance. The four quarters admire his righteousness, the myriad lands return to his benevolence. Ships and carriages traverse no barriers of height or depth; writing and wheels align with the transforming influence. This is the shelter of the nine heavens’ numina, the hidden support of the great Dao. Thus the imperial enterprise flourishes, the celestial calculations endure. My admiration and reverence grow ever deeper, my vigilance ever more earnest. Yet with celestial signs lingering, time’s passage slightly delayed, and the observed divisions of the heavens, prayer and supplication are truly needed. Therefore, I purify my resolve and cleanse my heart, relinquishing cunning and clarifying my thoughts. I summon the ritual companions of the Ten Isles, adhere to the mysterious statutes of the Three Caverns, reverently establish the pure retreat, and proceed with the grand offering. I humbly pray that the perfected above descend their scrutiny, the host of sages proclaim their mercy. May they turn the axis at the mysterious barrier, kindle radiance on the cinnabar path. May all spoken disasters be dissolved, all auspicious signs received and answered. May the sagely lifespan increase beyond a thousand autumns, the imperial way spread through the ten thousand regions. May the mountain of longevity rise higher than the Five Peaks, the sea of fortune deeper than the Eight Seas. May it stand firm with heaven and earth, shine bright with sun and moon. May it harmonize with the sentiments of the Hua and Rong in their veneration, fulfill the earnest pleas of ministers and children. In exhausting the profound teachings, may it graciously meet my humble devotion, though I dare to disturb the true immortals. I am overwhelmed with awe and trepidation, my fervor and anxiety beyond measure. I respectfully dispatch the Great Master of Attaining Unity, Purple-Robed Zhang Maoqing, and fourteen others to reverently perform the ritual, praying that my sincere devotion be perceived.

*Ritual Petition for the Golden Register Retreat on Behalf of the Emperor by Princess Pukang*

I have heard that the Dao blends into emptiness and non-being, melting the dark and yellow to form the beginning of the Nine Mysteries; images congeal from the indistinct, marking nurturance and transformation as the sole source of creation. Thus heaven and earth cover and support, sun and moon illuminate. The Three Powers share the Dao, employing hardness and softness. As the myriad beings arise in succession, the origins of good and evil unfold, and so afterward they are ordered: rulers and fathers descend to govern, ministers and limbs assist.

The virtue of the August Thearch transcends governance, embodying the boundless warmth of the Supreme Emperor’s silent nurturance. Vastly securing the realm’s borders, broadly sheltering the black-haired people.

We humbly recall that Your Imperial Majesty, emerging from the east to govern the people, succeeds the celestial mandate. Endowed with the radiant essence of the cosmic pivot, infused with the numinous origins of mountains and rivers, Your wisdom aligns with the Three Luminaries, Your rule harmonizes with the Four Seasons. At this moment of perfect accord between heaven and humanity, prophetic omens and auspicious signs converge. Moved by the decline of former ages, You have brought peace to the multitudes, pacified the commanderies and states, and divided the rivers and mountains. Your toils equal the labors of Great Yu; Your transformative influence rivals the virtue of the Zhou. How could You forget the cares of dawn and dusk, sparing no effort in Your devotion? Thus, harmony prevails, and eternal tranquility is sought.

Now, as the season turns to the first month and the solar term meets the height of yang, when the two qi are about to merge and the fiery brilliance of the noon position blazes, we aspire to magnify a hundred blessings and offer prayers for a thousand years of longevity. We open the sacred altar of the Golden Register and ascend the sublime precincts of the Jade Capital. We humbly pray that Your Majesty’s wisdom may equal the moon’s osmanthus, Your longevity rival the celestial elm. Wielding the golden mirror to govern the realm, You bring joy to the myriad peoples with overflowing goblets. Beneath Your imperial canopy, You inquire of the Dao, beholding the loyalty of the noble ministers; from Your throne, You harmonize the primal qi, securing the assistance of the finest advisors. May the realm endure as long as the Three August Ones, and the Six Directions know no peril. Reverently serving the August Emperor of the Void, we look up to the profound workings of creation, hoping our sincere prayers be received and our earnest supplications answered.

*Ritual Petition for the Golden Register Retreat on Behalf of the Emperor by the Crown Prince*

We acknowledge that the vast and boundless Dao nurtures heaven and earth, while the unfathomable workings of the mysterious power govern creation. It condenses the primal qi to give rise to the Three Powers and pervades the Six Voids to animate the myriad beings. Thus, the spring sovereign and autumn emperor, the cloud chronicles and fire officials, wielding wondrous efficacy, govern the realm and, embodying non-action, unify heaven and earth. How could they not embrace harmony, treasuring purity and uprightness? With reverent clarity, they uphold the great image, and humanity rides the soaring dragon. Though their transformative influence melts metal and scorches stone, the virtue of Tang shines ever brighter; though floods engulfed mountains and submerged hills, the winds of Yao spread ever wider.

The Emperor, responding to the prophetic charts and assuming the throne, established the foundation. He reveres the frugal and compassionate lineage of the Mysterious Origin and follows the footsteps of the Yellow Emperor’s *Huaxu* dream. Day by day, he remains vigilant, never resting even in times of prosperity. Thus, his moral influence spreads far and wide, grain overflows the granaries, customs attain leisure and joy, and the people delight in harmony. Neighboring states exchange goodwill, and tribute pours in from the remotest lands. Deeply awed, he bears the burden of the vast heavens.

Recently, as celestial omens flared and heavenly signs issued warnings—though their paths diverged across the constellations—our prayers and supplications redoubled in earnest devotion. Reverently establishing the imperial altar, we dare to seek abundant blessings. Gazing upon the mysterious transformations of the Jade Purity, we bow our heads in reverence; opening the Daoist precinct of the Golden Register, we purify our hearts and make our vows. Our greatest wish is to convey our sincerity to the azure heavens and extend the Emperor’s longevity, that he may share the brilliance of the sun and moon and the enduring vastness of heaven and earth.

The blue-green memorial is presented, veiling the golden wisdom in radiance; the vermilion petition reaches the perfected, aligning the pearl talismans with their proper measure. May disasters and calamities forever cease, and auspicious signs perpetually arrive. May the imperial reign be harmoniously attuned, and the wolf-smoke of war never alarm. May governance surpass the Three and Five, and the imperial line extend for myriad millennia. Though I, unworthy, dwell in the Eastern Palace, I truly revere the immortal realms. Thus, I pour forth my earnest devotion, looking up to the mysterious compassion.

*Ritual Petition for the Golden Register Retreat During the Middle Prime by the Assembly*

We have heard that the supreme Dao is subtle and formless, its true essence profoundly tranquil. It extends its transformative influence beyond the primordial chaos and concentrates its radiance before the Great Ultimate. Dispersing the root of pure unity, it subtly distinguishes the steps of creation; stirring the qi of the Three Powers, it governs the realm. Thus, the sovereigns who rode dragons and inherited the qi, and those who drew the hexagrams and draped their robes, unfolded the essentials of the Dao, establishing the imperial foundation. Expanding its wondrous efficacy to bless the realm, they spread divine works to benefit all under heaven. The imperial records shine brilliantly, and human culture flourishes resplendently.

Rightly does the sagacious court correspond to this mandate, born to receive the celestial gaze. The Emperor, embodying the celestial mandate, responds to the prophetic charts. He continues the numinous lineage of the Yellow Emperor and Zhuanxu, and emulates the supreme virtue of King Wen, his royal father. Inheriting the earthly destiny, he illuminates the golden balance. His imperial canopy manifests reverent clarity, and he aspires to the true governance of Yao and Shun. He seeks to realize the great harmony and bring peace to the people of the Nine Lands. Harvests are bountiful in succession, and both Hua and Rong enjoy tranquility. The Crown Prince shines with the beauty of double brightness, and distant lands praise the winds of the Dao. Within and without, all is serene; the living beings are at peace.

Moreover, as the season of the Three Primes arrives and the great amnesty heralds an auspicious time, it is fitting to offer the sincerity of fasting and purity, jointly praying for the longevity of the sovereign and parents. Sweeping the jade altar to perform the rites, we arrange the ceremonies according to the Golden Register. With dragon-like sincerity, we prepare incense and flowers as tokens. The flames of the nine-rayed lotus lamps illuminate the dark underworld; the fragrant smoke of the three-pure sandalwood ascends to the true realms.

We earnestly hope that the Three Heavens will bestow their blessings, and the myriad sages extend their compassion, that the ancestral temples flourish and the precious charts remain secure. May the Emperor’s longevity equal heaven and earth, and his wisdom match the sun and moon. May his civil virtue and martial achievements bring peace to the Eight Extremities. May the imperial lineage shine for ten thousand years, and the Crown Prince enjoy the longevity of the camphor and osmanthus. May he ever support the great enterprise; may the empress and consorts embody the virtue of the floating duckweed and knotted cords, jointly assisting the imperial residence. May the vermilion palace and the pure court ever receive abundant blessings. May the outer domains and inner ministers increasingly tread the path of殊荣. May all constantly delight in harmony and prosperity, attaining wealth and longevity.

For those burdened by accumulated misfortunes, past debts, former enmities, or calamities of fate and destiny—afflictions from the reckoning of years, the flying banners of misfortune—we beseech that through this repentance and absolution, all be dissolved and pacified.

We further pray that the ancestral temples’ revered spirits and the Three Realms of the living deities may grant that we, our nine generations of ancestors, and the seven lineages of forebears, receive the blessings of all heavens, bestowing prosperity and transmitting boundless felicity.

May the celestial patterns shine brightly, and the celestial bodies remain pure. May the banners of the Great Unity reverse their course, and the radiance of the jade comets and golden rays cease. May anxieties be dispelled from the lands of Jing and Shen, and blessings and good fortune extend to the regions of Liang and Yi. May the Nine Grains know no peril, and the Five Weapons be sheathed.

May locusts and droughts not disrupt the farmers’ toil; may epidemics and famine not bring calamity to the villages and hamlets. May the passes and frontiers know ease and abundance, all living things flourish in their kinds; may seas and mountains return to benevolence, and the realm receive transformation.

Among those who have rendered service—generals who stood firm, commanders who have passed on, those whose merits shone in defending the throne, whose loyalty was proven in the ultimate sacrifice—whenever we offer vegetarian rites and prayers, we always include them in our repentance and supplication. May they all depart the dark and desolate realms and attain the joys of carefree wandering. Yet if some still linger in the shadows of the underworld, untouched by liberating grace, or if their descendants are gone and offerings are lacking, may the talismanic commands of the Nine Palaces swiftly guide their spirits onward. Through the vast mercy of the Three Registers, may all be delivered from suffering. Let them no longer be afflicted by illness, but hasten to the courts of blessing. May all beings—whether moving or still, flying or submerged—ascend to the true Dao.

*Emperor’s Prayer at the Auspicious Talisman Retribution and Grace Vegetarian Rite*

We have heard that emperors of successive dynasties, having received the celestial talismanic mandate, all revered the supreme Dao to govern their grand designs. None failed to govern the people with the treasure of compassion or to aid all beings through the workings of mysterious power. Thus they brought about eras of harmony and prosperity, and were granted texts of auspicious omens in return.

Now, reflecting upon our own humble self, we have undeservedly ascended the great throne. The realm remains unsettled, and though we yearn to lay down arms, peace has not yet been achieved. While decrees have been issued and laws enacted, we strive to reduce punishments but have not yet succeeded. Inwardly, we remain vigilant and diligent, never daring to rest at ease.

This year, in the seventh month, Guo Huizhi, a commoner of Shifang County in Hanzhou, while gathering herbs and tilling the land at Xianju Abbey, unearthed a bronze tablet measuring seven *cun* in length and four *cun* in width, inscribed with sixty characters. As recorded in *Laozi’s Record of Heavenly Communications*: "In the *dingmao* year, the *jiaxu* and *yihai* months, the Human King shall be born and enjoy a reign of two hundred years. The Son of Heaven shall be Wang Cong; Wang Yuanying, Wang Wanggan, Wang Yue, Wang Ze, and Wang Daoyi." Following these five characters in seal script is the inscription: "Zhang Hongdao of Beimang transformed; in the Tianbao era, this remains for a sagely age." Reverently receiving this mysterious favor, we devoutly bear the sacred talisman. Recognizing the great Dao’s bestowed blessings and foreseeing the enduring prosperity of the divined years, we prostrate ourselves in sincere devotion to repay this extraordinary grace. In accordance with the nine-grade ritual statutes, we perform the rites of the *Lingbao* scriptures. May our earnest hearts directly reach the sagely gaze. May the altars and state flourish eternally, auspicious omens surely manifest, the four seasons align in harmony, and all things thrive in abundance. May all within the realm become guests of the land, each preserving boundless fortune. We bow our heads and present this reverent petition.

*Two Hymns by Huang Qi to Assist the Zhongyuan Yellow Register Rite*
*Second Hymn: Lamp-Lighting Prayer*

We have heard that the Three Yuan’s great amnesty marks the day when the heavens descend their blessings, and the nine nights of profound darkness are the realm where the earth’s dense yin prevails. To dispel accumulated shadows, we rely upon the divine lamps. Above, they receive the light of the Three Luminaries; below, they illuminate all beings. As the scriptures and rituals esteem, salvation and protection take precedence. Now, as the season arrives at the Zhongyuan altar, we open the Yellow Register’s threefold morning repentance, dissolving ten thousand sins. We prepare fragrant oil to jointly offer this devotion. May the radiance of phoenix flames coalesce within the earthly prisons, and starlight unfold like lotuses, scattering brilliance within the gates of the Yellow Springs. May all transcend the realms of suffering and forever escape the dark ford. May nine generations of ancestors ascend to heaven, and six relations receive blessings. May disasters vanish before they arise, and goodness flow without end. We dedicate this for the peace of our household, praying for supreme fortune.

*Huang Qi’s Yellow Register Rite Prayer for Two Deceased Sons*

Your servant has heard that the supreme Dao, embracing all phenomena, stands as the honored nurturer of creation, while the Heavenly Worthy, in vast salvation of all beings, expounds the Way of Emptiness. Its grace extends to the minutest dust, its blessings embrace both the living and the dead. The Perfected Ones reveal the jade-chamber scriptures, releasing those in the long night from the suffering of dense yin. Sincere devotion ascends to move the unseen, and mysterious favor must surely arrive. Yet your servant’s past transgressions have long been manifest, and the divine has sent down its reproof. Within barely a month, two sons have been lost in succession. In the desolation of middle age, I stand alone, a solitary shadow. During the season of ancestral offerings, I have cut off all thoughts of the dark beyond. How then may I aid those wandering souls still bound and detained? Reflecting on their deliverance, I can only rely upon these rites of burning and cultivation. Setting aside the resources for mourning garments, I instead assist this assembly of fragrant lamps. May the cool breeze harmonize with the chime of bells, heard amidst the melodies of the Yellow Springs; may the autumn moon congeal over the altar, illuminating the terraces of the night. Through the merit of this fast, may they together pass the gates of darkness. May their souls be refined in the Vermilion Palace and their spirits born in the Crimson Mansion. May each follow the path of carefree wandering and all ascend to the realm of purity. May they forever serve the true and upright, eternally dwelling in the domain of the Dao. In the human world and the heavens above, may they meet again in good affinity at the end of time; through ten thousand kalpas and a thousand lives, may they reunite with their kin. This luminous vow, the true sages surely perceive. I cannot contain my weeping and reverent prayers.

*Three Hymns by Zhao Gao to Assist the Shangyuan Yellow Register Rite*

The supreme Dao flows with compassion, and the Primordial August One bestows its favor. The Three Palaces and Four Amnesties extend their trust and grant absolution...

The myriad beings shine in glory, rejoicing together in the spring-like grace of the Dao. The imperial altar bestows its vast protection, leaving none in darkness or light unblessed. I, though foolish and unworthy, have been favored by the sacred mandate, early receiving the grace of rank and emolument, ever vigilant against complacency. Yet I fear that within the span of years and the movements of the stars, I may encounter adversity and misfortune, and thus my apprehension runs deep. Taking this opportunity of the Yellow Register Daoist sanctuary, I humbly offer repentance and gratitude, looking up to the exalted sages and beseeching them to look down upon my sincerity. May they secretly bestow blessings and prosperity, silently dispel calamities and faults, augment my years and vitality, and grant well-being to my family. May the living and the departed, the seen and the unseen, together attain radiant protection.

**Middle Prime**
The season shifts as the summer’s heat yields to autumn’s purity. The drum of the *Yize* resounds in the western suburbs, and the fiery clouds gather at the southern pole. This is a time to cease wrongdoing and guard against evil, truly befitting this sacred occasion. Though I am but dust in the mortal realm, I have been graced to partake in the transformation of the Dao. My body serves the Vermilion Register, and my name is inscribed in the Mystic Terrace. Yet my transgressions accumulate easily, and the snares of the world are hard to escape. In movement and stillness, action and retreat, I have not merged with the Great Dao; in the passage of years and the configurations of the stars, I remain entangled in manifold afflictions. Thus, I take this occasion of the Yellow Register’s sacred altar to assist in the offering of incense and devotion. I hope to receive the power of the sages and have my humble sincerity beheld. May the scrolls of sin be unsealed and transgressions absolved, may worldly burdens be lifted and hardships dispelled. May the Nine Mysteries receive this grace, and my entire clan be blessed with honor. I vow to forever uphold the mercy of their protection and devote myself to their worship.

**Lower Prime**
By virtue of past causes, I have received accumulated blessings. Early in life, I assumed official duties, and my family has been undeservedly honored with rank. Yet the responsibilities I bear are weighty and difficult, and my apprehension runs deep. I still fear that the passing years may bring misfortune, and the stars may cast their baleful influence. Should I encounter hardship and obscurity, I would have no recourse for prayer. Now, as the Dark Emperor governs the season and the Lord of Waters presides over the time, the stellar handle points to early winter, and the northern constellations command the frosty air. The year’s light wanes, and my devotion grows ever more earnest. Thus, I dare to approach the altar of the Nine Offerings, reverently gazing upon the exalted sages. Pouring forth my myriad supplications, I pray for their boundless compassion. May my sins and faults be dissolved, and my misfortunes cease. May past grievances and karmic debts be pacified through merit and virtue; may past lives and the present be uplifted through repentance and prayer. May the Nine Mysteries enjoy blessings, and my entire clan be graced with honor. I vow to forever uphold the mercy of their protection and devote myself to their worship.

**Feng Juan, Grand Master for Assisting the Prime, Offers Hymns for the Upper Prime Yellow Register Rite**
I prostrate myself, acknowledging that the Great Dao bestows its scriptures, its grace extending to both the living and the departed; the Heavenly Worthy expounds its teachings, its mercy reaching the seen and unseen. It broadly establishes the ninefold ordinances to deliver those in deepest darkness from suffering. With sorrowful sincerity, I dare to knock upon the mystic gate. On the twenty-sixth day of this month, it is the memorial fast for my late mother, the Lady of Longxi Commandery, posthumously honored as the Grand Lady of Longxi Commandery, née Li. I have come to the Jade Bureau’s sacred altar to participate in the Upper Prime’s grand assembly, offering incense and devotion to pray for blessings. I humbly pray that my late mother may refine her spirit in the Vermilion Mansion and dwell in the Mystic Garden. May she awaken to the Dao of tranquility, stillness, and emptiness, and attain the truth of eternal life through kalpas. May she realize the unfettered assembly of the Dao and achieve its wondrous fruit.

**Middle Prime**
I have heard that the luminous ordinances of the Yellow Register and the august canons of the Purple Yang, through the sublime power of the Primordial August One, proclaim grace upon the cinnabar tablets, delivering the submerged in darkness and illuminating the night of the unseen. From ancient times to the present, all who receive its teachings, in life and death, bear its grace. Where there is sincerity, there is response; what is prayed for shall be granted. On the twenty-sixth day of this month, the anniversary of my late mother, the posthumously honored Grand Lady of Longxi Commandery, I take this occasion of the Jade Bureau’s altar and the Middle Prime’s rites to offer devotion, hoping to reach her true spirit. I humbly pray that my late mother, by this blessed affinity, may ascend to the realm of the Dao, wander the azure heavens, and shed her form in the Vermilion Terrace. May she forever dwell in the land of joy and realize the Dao of tranquility and emptiness.

**Lower Prime**
As the Dark Emperor governs the season and the Lord of Waters orders the time, the grand assembly of the Lower Prime arrives, a day of great pardon and prosperity. It is fitting to reverently pray to the exalted sages, who in turn bestow their grace upon the earth below, bringing auspicious blessings to the living and the dead. Now, at the Jade Bureau’s sacred precinct, the jade altar is arrayed for the rites. I humbly present the ritual tokens to assist in the sincerity of the fast. I dare to hope that the host of sages will deign to descend and the myriad perfected ones will shine their protection. May the Nine Mysteries be delivered, transcending the desolate realm of darkness; may the five clans harmonize and forever enjoy the blessings of peace and stability. May misfortunes cease and sins be absolved. I forever pledge my devotion and look up to receive this vast grace.

**Zhou Xiang, Gentleman for Court Audiences, Offers Hymns for the Upper Prime Yellow Register Rite**
I have heard that the fasts of the nine ranks are observed, and the festivals of the Three Primes commence. This is the time when all directions pray for blessings, the day when the host of sages proclaim their grace. Now, as the true transformation of the Primordial August One unfolds at the Jade Bureau’s sacred altar, the rites of the Yellow Register are arrayed, and the ordinances of the Mystic Capital are followed. For nine periods, offerings are made; for three days, the fast is observed. With incense and lamps, repentance and purification are jointly offered. I humbly pray that the exalted ones will bestow their protection, that the Great Dao will extend its compassion, that my sincerity will be received, and that vast blessings will be conferred. May the nine generations of ancestors fulfill their wish for ascension, and the six relations be graced with the benevolence of their shelter. May future hardships be dispelled and past enmities resolved. May sins be absolved and illnesses healed. May longevity and emolument be augmented, and misfortunes eradicated. May I ever embody the virtue of renewal and never forget the grace of the Great Dao.

**Lower Prime**
As the Dark Emperor governs the season and the Water Official orders the time, this is the season for seeking blessings and extending grace, a period for concentrating the mind and purifying the thoughts. Moreover, the Jade Bureau’s immortal traces and the jade altar’s grand rites are observed. For nine periods, prayers are offered, surely bringing auspicious blessings; for three days, the fast is solemnly kept, daring to join in repentance and gratitude. I hope that misfortunes will cease, karmic debts be dissolved, sins be absolved, and the living and the dead together enjoy peace. I vow to forever uphold my devotion in gratitude for the mystic grace.

**Lu Wei, Grand Master for Assisting the Prime, Offers Hymns for the Upper Prime Yellow Register Rite**
I prostrate myself, acknowledging that the Great Dao pervades all, the Three Primes establish their teachings, and the bright scrutiny of their judgment leaves nothing, however minute, unexamined. Early in life, I admired the mysteries of the void and from the first revered purity. With each display of reverent devotion, I have prayed for the shining mercy of their protection. Now, at the Jade Bureau’s sacred altar and the Upper Prime’s assembly of blessings, I humbly present incense and candles to assist in the fast and offerings. I pray for the dissolution of misfortunes, the cleansing of sins, the eradication of illnesses and hardships, and the augmentation of my years.

**Lu Wei, Grand Master for Assisting the Prime, Offers Hymns for the Upper, Middle, and Lower Prime Yellow Register Rites**

May the merit of good deeds extend to both the living and the departed, and may blessings of prosperity embrace all kin. With unceasing devotion, I strive to fulfill the boundless grace of the Dao.

**Upper Prime**
At this season of scrutiny, when the auspicious hour precedes spring’s renewal, the Upper Prime’s festival of bright judgment arrives—the very time when all beings find ease. With utmost sincerity, I offer my reverent prayers. Now, in the radiant transformation of the Brocade Capital and at the Jade Bureau’s jade altar, where the true rites of the Yellow Register unfold and the grand liturgy of the Mysterious Code is displayed, I humbly present incense and offerings to aid this virtuous cause. I pray that the host of sages and the myriad Perfected Ones, in their mercy, will witness my devotion and bestow blessings: universal grace upon the living and the dead, the far-reaching absolution of sins, the dissolution of misfortunes before they manifest, and the renewal of fortune and longevity. With an enduring heart, I seek to align with the profound favor of the Dao.

**Middle Prime**
As the four beginnings cycle through the year and the Three Primes establish their registers, their scrutiny pierces the bright and the obscure, leaving nothing unexamined. I have long upheld the Daoist precepts and early embraced the mysteries of the void. At every auspicious gathering, I have redoubled my devotion. Now, as the Jade Bureau’s Frost Altar completes its rites for the Morning of the Prime, I present incense and candles to assist in the purification of the fast. I pray for the great mercy of pardon, the descent of celestial blessings, the healing of illnesses, and the extension of life’s span. I reverently commend the spirits of my ancestors and seek grace for all my kin. May I forever receive their vast protection and honor the primal merit.

**Lower Prime**
As the virtue of Water aligns with the season and the dark winter unfolds, this is the time when the two qi retreat in solemn stillness and the assembly of celestial scrutiny convenes. It is fitting to rouse the will toward the profound and concentrate the mind upon the supreme Dao, to cleanse faults, repent transgressions, and beseech blessings and favor. Moreover, at the Jade Bureau’s imperial altar and the Brocade Capital’s assembly of blessings, I dare to prepare incense and offerings to join in the fast and rites. For three days, I maintain solemn reverence; at nine intervals, I present my repentance. I hope to receive manifest protection and the abundant bestowal of auspicious signs: the ascension of my ancestors, the liberation of the departed, the deliverance of the living and the dead, and the dissolution of misfortunes. May grievances be released in the nocturnal courts, and sins erased from the earthly records. May illnesses be healed, life’s span lengthened, and my vow of steadfast devotion ever align with the protection of the Perfected Ones.

*Scroll Five of the* Guangcheng Collection *begins*

To the Most Sacred Supreme Clarity Palace in the Upper Capital, the Eminent Virtue of Literary Works for Imperial Service, Purple-Robed Bestowed Du Guangting, composes:

**Prayer for the Yellow Register Fast of the Jade Bureau’s Transformation of the Multitude on the Upper Prime Festival**

We have heard that the Dao emerges beyond the formless void, its office lying in generation and completion; its virtue surpasses benevolence and righteousness, its merit encompassing compassion and nurturance. Its transformation endures through countless kalpas, its teachings spread across all directions. Thus did the Three Sovereigns govern heaven and earth through the Dao, and the Five Emperors inherit the cosmos through virtue. People attained fortune and longevity, customs achieved harmony and prosperity.

Though the cycles of metal and wood shift and the march of time renews, in ordering the household and prospering the state, the Dao alone takes precedence. When followed, the Four Seas become tranquil and clear, and the age returns to pristine simplicity; when violated, the Central Plains fall into chaos, and all things grow shallow and degenerate.

Our dynasty revives the winds of highest antiquity, continuing the teachings of the Mysterious Origin. Embracing the Dao and holding to virtue, it follows the legacy of Shun and recounts the ways of Yao. Thus has it wielded divine martial prowess to sweep away the dust of turmoil and restore the phoenix’s reign; illuminated sagely culture to secure the altars of the state and firmly establish its grand design.

We, your servants, have long been nurtured by the Dao’s compassion and have encountered this radiant destiny. Though our meager merits remain unmanifest, the grace bestowed upon us runs deep. We aspire to the sincerity of fasting and purity, looking upward to repay the virtue of ruler and kin.

Now, as the Celestial Officials govern the seasons and the Wood Emperor presides over the direction, we approach the season of the Upper Prime’s reckoning and correction, the time for the lower lands to refine their devotion. Together we present ritual offerings and approach the sacred altar. We prepare the jade baskets and golden beans, array the rites of the Ten Poles and Four Flowers. Lotus lamps scatter their flames, continuing the sunlight to illumine the dark passes; orchid incense wafts its smoke, guiding the stellar paths to convey our humble pleas.

We earnestly hope that the host of Perfected Ones will turn their chariots, that the ten thousand sages will wheel their carriages, deigning to look down upon the hearts of the multitude and pour forth vast blessings. Above, may they uphold the imperial throne, securing the dynasty’s rule for as long as heaven endures; below, may they support the ancestral counsels, stabilizing the earth’s foundations for eternity. May border beacons remain unlit, the seasons harmonious, grains abundant, and all living beings at ease. May the realm enjoy concord, its carriages and roads united. May noxious influences not arise, and auspicious signs accumulate.

May we, your servants, in life and death receive boundless fortune; may our seven generations of ancestors ascend to heaven. May our clans share in glory, the three disasters cease. Some among us may bear sins from past lives or this existence, their karmic nets not yet cleared; others may carry old debts or lingering grievances, their transgressions unresolved. Some may have erred in legal judgments or governed unjustly; others may have caused harm through intent or accident, forming karmic retribution. Some may have acted with minds that offend the divine, or indulged in extravagance in earth and timber, in attire and adornments. The Three Officials record their faults, the Five Emperors oversee their wrongs. Through this repentance and prayer, we hope all may be washed clean.

Grant us, your servants, extended years and distant blessings, the removal of calamities, the reconciliation of enmities. Those who have served the throne with single-minded devotion, who have labored for the king with all their strength—though frost and dew first startled them, and the swift passage of time now separates them—we recall them in the nocturnal courts, wishing them to enjoy felicitous karma. May the causes of deliverance be extended, and the paths of transcendence all be attained. For those whose ancestral rites have long been abandoned, who drift in the dark without refuge, may they too be reborn and not remain mired in suffering.

May the dragon spirits and the five ancestral shrines, by the special grace of the Yellow Register and the radiant blessings of the Mysterious Capital, purify the winds and scenery, securing and pacifying all regions. May plagues not invade, weapons not be raised. May strange creatures and unusual forms, all beings of the six destinies and four births, the three paths and five sufferings, by the command of the Nine Dragons and the majestic light of the Three Treasures, universally bathe in divine power and together ascend the true Dao.

**Eulogy for the White Jade Sphere’s Luminous Fast in Praise of the Most High Lord Lao**

We have heard that the Dao originates in perfect nonbeing, its transformation unfolding into wondrous existence. Its merit encompasses all under heaven, its grace extends to both the manifest and the hidden. Households and states rely upon it for peace; the living and the dead depend on it for deliverance. Its divine majesty and numinous blessings are of boundless efficacy.

We, your servants, at the Jade Bureau’s Grotto-Heaven, the transcendent abode of immortals, now offer reverence and present our imperial observances. Thus have we, for the secluded chambers of our mysterious ancestors, sculpted the true image. Its gaze is dignified and solemn, its attendants arrayed in order. It seems as though the Pearl Palace has just descended, or the Jade Throne floats in midair. With this great work completed, the wondrous countenance grows ever more majestic. The sun’s corner and moon’s mystery shine forth, illuminating the lord of all beings; the green brows and hoary hair tower as the august one among the ten thousand sages. May it eternally bless this land, securing its numinous transformation.

Therefore, we devoutly prepare this eulogy and prayer, fully expressing our sincerity. We open the jade archives, observe the rites of the Illuminated True, recite scriptures, circumambulate the Dao, light lamps, and burn incense. We pour forth our pleas to the Most High, our minds fixed upon the lower realms.

We humbly hope that the radiance of the Three Realms will incline, that the chariots of the Nine Heavens will turn. May they look down in compassion upon this dust-like existence and descend a cascade of auspicious blessings. May they secretly uphold the precious mandate and covertly protect the sagely dynasty. May they align with the winds of natural purity and attain the principle of the Great Antiquity’s nonaction.

Next, may the earth’s foundations be solemn and tranquil, the river lands peaceful and secure. May auspicious omens be heard, and calamities not arise. May the nine generations of our ancestors and the seven generations of our forebears emerge from the courts of endless night and ascend to the halls of the Radiant Yang. May those whose names were stricken from the earthly registers soar upon the celestial thoroughfares. May all sentient beings of the three paths and six destinies universally partake in this luminous fortune and each attain their destined fulfillment.

We, your servants, having dissolved our accumulated sins and erased our long-standing flaws, find disasters dispelled like mist and the winds of the Dao’s transformation blowing freely. May we obtain the mysterious pearl of the formless and enter the secret registers of the serene and invisible. We vow to refine our devotion in repayment of the profound grace.

**Prayer for the Communal Fast at Zhaoxian Abbey in Wenjiang County**

We have heard that the wondrous Dao fuses with the true, towering beyond the primordial chaos; the Heavenly Worthy established the teachings, their light spreading before the vast kalpas. Through the ages, enlightened beings have appeared, aiding beings according to their capacities. For the greatness of states and the salvation of both the manifest and the hidden, all rely upon divine power and universally receive radiant blessings.

We, your servants, have been favored by this sagely destiny and have long been imbued with the true teachings. We revere the Mysterious Origin as the fountainhead of virtue and the Dao, and have witnessed the immortal traces of our illustrious ancestors. Yet we remain entangled in the world’s nets, not yet freed from its cages. We apportion land and employ heaven, reverently upholding the teachings of the mysterious and the classical; we moderate wealth and restrain ourselves, never forgetting the private grace of heaven and earth.

Now, as the Most Sagely One governs with effortless rule, the founding merit pacifies the people, the five weapons are stilled, and the hundred grains offer their bounty.

The countryside resounds with songs of joy, and the people enjoy wealth and longevity. In this month when the Nine Wells bestow life, and this season when the Three Terraces manifest auspicious signs, we seek first to repay the boundless grace through the Yellow Register rites. Thus, we humbly gather the strength of all, together preparing the offerings of faith, meticulously adorning the immortal traces, and reverently following the secret protocols. We lay bare our hearts to the ten directions, surrendering our lives to the myriad heavens. With lamps kindled and incense burning, we convey our sincerity and earnestness.

We humbly pray that the Three Honored Ones may pause their radiant presence to gaze upon our crimson hearts, and that the ten thousand sages may turn their chariots to bestow their mysterious blessings. Above, may they uphold the altars of state, harmonizing with heaven and earth to ensure peace and prosperity; below, may they assist the sagely person, shining with the brilliance of sun and moon. May the auspicious stars of the Three Terraces forever illuminate the earth’s foundations. May the strategies of the ancestral temple and the plans of the court forever govern the wells and towns. May one region flourish in peace, the four borders remain secure, pestilence be kept at bay, and weapons of war stay sheathed.

May we, your servants, along with our nine generations of ancestors and seven generations of kin, transcend the gates of the underworld; may our five clans and six relations be truly blessed with prosperity. May sins and transgressions be dissolved, and calamities and misfortunes be pacified. May agriculture and sericulture be preserved in abundance, and the suffering and afflicted all find relief. May dragon deities guard and stabilize, and wind and rain be harmoniously regulated. May the transformative power of the Dao spread far and wide, and its numinous might extend universally.

Across the vast nine lands and the teeming four kinds of beings, by the merit of the Yellow Altar’s universal repentance and the command of the Most High’s Nine Dragons, may all ascend to the fruits of the Dao and universally mount the immortal ranks. May the wandering souls of flower-strewn sacrifices and the spirits touched by frost and dew no longer suffer from disease and pestilence, each attaining rebirth. Wherever the power of the Dao reaches, may eternal fortune prevail.

The Liu Yin, Fei Shun, and Huanglu Memorial for the Yellow Register Rites:

We regard the pure and tranquil origin as the foundation of the profound mystery, establishing teachings; the root of creation relies upon the wondrous pivot to manifest its works. Households and states receive it and flourish, while past and present revolve by it without exhaustion. Of all transformations, the Dao’s influence first emerged before the emperors. Now, as the sagely and wise govern the heavens, the primary terraces divide their domains, spreading and magnifying virtue and the Dao, nurturing and fostering the multitudes. Their benevolence rivals that of Yao, Shun, and Yu, and their virtue surpasses that of Hou Ji and Gao Yao. The myriad regions enjoy peace, and the four borders know no peril. Moved by this extraordinary grace, how can we ascend to repay it?

Thus, we lead and encourage our subordinates to examine and adhere to the scriptural canons, meticulously adorning the altar grounds and fully observing the rites of purification. With refined incense and lamps, we convey our earnestness, and with offerings of faith, we express our sincerity. We focus our thoughts on the Nine Pures and direct our hearts toward the Three Realms.

We humbly pray that the mysterious light may descend to illuminate, and that the Most Sages may spiritually commune, graciously perceiving the sentiments of all and abundantly bestowing their vast blessings. Above, may they uphold the imperial enterprise, gloriously assisting the sagely court, shining as brightly as the three luminaries and standing as firmly as heaven and earth. In the lands of Kun Pond and Phoenix Cave, may the sound of teachings spread afar; in the regions of Mulberry Ford and Meng Valley, may the scripts and decrees be unified.

May the frontier regions be safeguarded, and the generals be aided and protected. May the heavenly blessings forever increase, and the span of life grow ever broader. May our nine generations of ancestors in the dark realms transcend suffering and pass through the gates of obscurity; may our five clans and all relations enjoy the good karma of the Dao’s domain. Within the borders, may the three agricultural seasons yield abundant harvests stored in granaries; amid the governance, may auspicious omens daily be recorded in the annals.

May weapons of war fall silent, and pestilence be kept at bay. For those with lingering bones and wandering souls, long grieving in wind and dew, or suffering in ruined tombs and dilapidated temples, may they, by this meritorious cause, all attain wondrous joy. May dragon deities remain peacefully in their abodes, and the people and officials flourish anew. May all living beings, great and small, together ascend to the realm of blessings.

Memorial for the Yellow Register Rites on the Occasion of the Imperial Heir’s Birth:

We have heard that the Dao is supreme, employing its mysterious power to give birth to and nurture heaven and earth; the emperor is most honored, wielding the great pivot to govern and shape creation. He broadly oversees the myriad states and distantly rules the multitudes, receiving the radiant mandate from the Three Pures and establishing the grand foundation across the nine lands. Thus, jade charts accumulate auspicious signs, and the Silver River shines with splendor, giving birth to the illustrious heir and expanding the great enterprise.

Now, as auspicious rainbows shimmer with color and precious lightning flashes with light, during this season when the sun’s brilliance awakens and the entire land reverently observes this sacred time, we dare to open the cloud-bound scriptures and humbly approach the immortal altars. We prepare the sacred precincts of the Numinous Treasure and solemnly convene the grand assembly of longevity. Whale-bone chimes and phoenix bells resound through the nine heavens; crane flames and dragon smoke convey our sincerity to the Three Realms.

We humbly pray that the imperial domain may flourish eternally, equaling the boundless rain and dew; that the sagely lifespan may rise high, matching the vastness of the eight seas. May the six palaces and inner offices harmoniously assist the imperial residence, and the myriad beings and regions widely proclaim the wise virtue. May the imperial heir possess the dragon’s pattern and phoenix’s form, as steadfast as mountains and as pure as pines, surpassing the Han and exceeding the Zhou, wisely supporting the unified realm and universally harmonizing transformation, extending even to the humble and black-haired people.

May all together revere the era of the Dao and unite in the governance of non-action. Your servant, so-and-so, cannot express the utmost of his reverent prayers and devout surrender.

Memorial for the Yellow Register Rites Offered by Wang Chengxiu, Grand Master for Splendid Happiness, on Behalf of His Mother:

We have heard that the supreme sages transmitted their canons, and the heavenly perfected established teachings. Their divine works save all beings, leaving nothing—neither the moving nor the still—unattended; their benevolent power spreads grace, universally reaching both the ascending and the descending. From the most ancient times to this very day, we have received their blessings and kindness, the limits of which are beyond knowing.

Thus, in the northern precincts of Mount Feng, they secretly dispelled the dust of evil and pestilence; in the southern precincts of the Dipper’s extremity, they broadly bestowed the warmth of creation and sustenance. Yet only through reverence and purity can one attain spiritual resonance. Your servant, though base and insignificant, has been honored by the shade of the Dao, encountered the wise favor, and ascended through the ranks of office. Within, I attend the celestial steps, ascending high above the nine heavens; without, I hold the bamboo tally, honored to govern a thousand miles.

At times, I must solemnly lead troops, wielding the authority of punishment and law; at others, I must pacify the frontier regions, employing the majesty of command. Fearing that I may deviate from the mean or incur blame, I am ever vigilant and anxious, my heart truly burdened.

Now, my mother, Lady Dou, born under the celestial signs of *jiazi* in such-and-such a month, has been ensnared by baleful influences and afflicted with illness. Though she has diligently taken remedies, she has yet to recover. I fear this may stem from karmic debts or lingering grievances from past lives, where sins of former existences and this present one have entwined. Perhaps it is the malign aspect of stars or the inauspicious passage of years that has brought misfortune, wearing down her fate and fortune. Day and night, I am consumed by anxiety, at a loss for how to aid her. Moreover, as I am charged with royal duties, journeying far upon the roads, I cannot personally attend her at home, nor prepare her medicines and meals. My heart races across ten thousand valleys; my gaze stretches beyond a thousand mountains. I can only rely on the compassion of the Great Dao, hoping for the efficacy of spiritual resonance.

Thus, I turn in devotion to the sacred observance, bowing my head before the flower-strewn altar. I establish a *Huanglu* Daoist ritual, invoking the Perfected and Supreme Saints of the Mysterious Realms. May the sagely gaze turn toward me, bestowing blessings and good fortune. Grant my mother an exchange of her brief span for a long and prosperous life. Dissolve her calamities, wash away her misfortunes, harmonize the six *qi*, and restore health to her hundred meridians. May her faults be absolved, her grievances settled, and her karmic debts resolved. Let her behold the radiance of sun and moon, and receive anew the blessings of creation and sustenance. May those lost in the three wretched paths and the six realms of existence alike partake of this meritorious cause, together attaining the grace of goodness. May the Nine Mysteries open the way to salvation, and the Five Lineages dwell in peace.

If I may ever serve my parents in life, I shall fulfill my filial duty with sweetness and devotion. Honoring the sagely court, I shall forever offer my loyal and sincere heart. With this solemn vow, I humbly submit to the mysterious protection. Unable to contain my earnest supplication and reverent plea, I respectfully submit this petition.

**Petition for the Huanglu Ritual by Attendant Censor Hu**

I have heard that the wondrous origin is subtle and imperceptible, the utmost truth empty and tranquil. Through the workings of divine power, it nurtures and transforms; through the molding of all things, it brings forth creation. Its responses are impartial, its circulation tireless. Thus, across the Nine Mysteries and the Three Antiquities, all proclaim its encompassing compassion; between heaven and earth, all bathe in its nurturing grace. The golden precepts and jade statutes, the cloud-script and jade chapters, precede the myriad dharmas in bestowing their teachings, and through the nine schools, they save the world. Great indeed is this supreme teaching—beyond all praise.

I have long been favored by the grace of the Dao, and now rejoice in this glorious era. I wander in the mysterious workings of creation, bathing in the imperial wind. At ease, I follow the harmony of heaven; in all things, I partake of the great transformation. Early on, I entered the secret registers, ever striving to cultivate clarity and sincerity. Like fire-drill and incense, I have maintained reverence from dawn to dusk; like jade rituals and treasured texts, I dare not falter in respect and devotion. My kin and close relations have ever enjoyed its sheltering protection.

Thus, I now perform the *Huanglu* ritual with utmost sincerity, offering it to the mysterious favor. Following the rites of the Ten Flowers and Three Realms, I prepare the feathered fans, chime-stones, frost-bells, and ritual platforms. My heart turns to the myriad saints; my head bows to the hosts of heaven. I humbly beseech that you look upon my sincere devotion and, in your boundless grace, bestow blessings and good fortune.

Grant that my nine ancestors and seven generations ascend to heaven and attain the Dao; that my six relations and five lineages receive fortune and glory. May the living and the dead alike know the benevolence of salvation; may all, in motion and stillness, receive the gift of peace and constancy. May disasters and misfortunes cease, grievances be settled, and faults be absolved; may lifespans be extended, and all beings under heaven—all that lives upon the earth—share in the bond of virtue. May they forever delight in the harmonious transformation of the Dao. Unable to contain my reverent plea, I respectfully submit this petition.

**Petition for the Ritual for the Deceased Daughter by Li Xuanjing**

I, from my humble origins, early embraced the true teaching. I have been deeply favored by the mysterious grace, long blessed by the divine favor. Yet, entangled in worldly affairs and bound by the web of the age, I have long been constrained by official duties, unable to fulfill my original aspirations. Though I yearn for the feathered robe and long to take flight, my desire remains unfulfilled. In my devotion to cultivation and reverence, I dare not neglect my private sincerity. Yet, misfortune has befallen me: my daughter has passed away. Time slips away, and my grief is unbearable.

My daughter, in her fifteenth year, was wed to the Yi family. After her husband’s death, she vowed to dedicate herself to the Dao. She had already made her ritual robes and copied scriptures and registers, intending to wear the cap and sash and devote herself to cultivation. But when I was called away on royal business, her wish could not be fulfilled. Soon after, she fell ill and suddenly passed away. Holding my hidden sorrow, I have no way to express it; thinking of the gates of the underworld, my resentment only grows.

I humbly beseech the Three Honored Ones to show compassion, and the host of saints to take pity. May you, in your boundless mercy, bestow the grace of deliverance. Let her soul find refuge and return to the fold. May the karmic debts of her past lives be dissolved, and the faults of this existence be absolved. Rescue her from the suffering of the dark springs, and let her dwell in the bliss of the good realms. May the mysterious power of the Dao ever protect and guide her.

The scriptures, registers, and ritual robes she had prepared, I now reverently burn before the ritual altar, offering them in supplication. I humbly beseech the Perfected Saints to look upon my foolish heart and command her soul to receive and ascend. Unable to contain my earnest plea, my grief, and my sorrow, I respectfully submit this petition.

**Petition for the Birthday Offering of the Eastern Court by Heavenly Commissioner He Wenji**

I have heard that when Heaven and Earth divided their numinous essence and sovereign and subject established their positions, they necessarily relied upon assistance and support to bring about the flourishing of all things. As the wind awaits the tiger and the cloud responds to the dragon, so too do omens appear in dreams and auspices manifest in cauldrons. The wise are born in accordance with their images, as Gao Yao and Kui emerged in the time of the Tai clan; the virtuous rise in succession, as the Eight Elements of Yao’s reign and the noble winds of the Yu court. None failed to illuminate the imperial enterprise and shine forth in the annals of history, bringing peace to the multitudes and blessing the realm entire.

Now, as the year bears the cyclical sign *renchen*, the day holds *gengwu*, the new moon aligns with the celestial markers, and the month accords with the Water Balance. Auspicious omens gather at the Southern Dipper, and propitious radiance converges upon the Eastern Mound. The balmy breeze enters the pitch-pipes, the stellar fire heralds good fortune, the birth-star descends upon Mount Song, and the season is truly fitting. Though I, unworthy, hold a place among the blue-robed officials, I dare to beseech the grace of the Mystic Saints. With reverence, I approach the resplendent altar, praying for the bestowal of boundless fortune. Orchid lamps burn through the night, sandalwood incense rises at dawn. Looking upward, I present the threefold petition, that it may surely reach the scrutiny of the Nine Heavens.

I humbly hope that with azure tablets and vermilion brushes, my name may be inscribed in the Eastern Pole’s register of longevity; that with crimson slips and vermilion records, I may be enrolled in the Southern Palace’s ledger of attainment. May my years rival the mountains in height, my emoluments match the seas in depth. May my joyous realm grow ever clearer, and the virtue of the mulberry-clad one be manifest. May the wild geese in formation inherit the splendor of the Three Terraces, and the carp in the courtyard surpass the seven generations of heroes. May I refine and govern the Nine Regions, aiding the Primordial Sage, unifying governance, and harmonizing customs in great unity. May the blessings extend universally to all lands, and the culture of concord be eternally secured.

I, so-and-so, having received extraordinary favor, reflect upon my own emptiness and frailty. Only by knocking my head before the numinous and true do I express my profound gratitude. Unable to contain my earnest and reverent devotion, I respectfully submit this petition.

**Petition for the *Mingzhen* Offering for the Deceased Son Zhaoyin by Military Commissioner of Xuan Sheng Army, Wang Dang**

I have heard that the great transformation knows no bounds, and the divine power is universally bestowed. It penetrates the realms of darkness and light, responding to all appeals, and extends its grace to both the living and the dead. None are left unrelieved, and from ancient times to the present, all have received its blessings.

Recently, I led an expedition to the northern lands, commanding troops in battle. With black bows drawn against the foe, I swore to fulfill my loyal duty; wielding carved halberds, I pledged my life to cleanse the nation’s store. Yet the mountains and rivers were vast, the supply lines strained by transport. As I strove to bring matters to order, my anxiety and vigilance were acute. Moreover, the soldiers suffered from pestilence, their dead and wounded strewn along the roads. My youngest son, Zhaoyin, was also afflicted by illness, his life hanging by a thread. With sincere devotion, I made vows and supplications, hoping for the scrutiny of the Mystic Saints. Soon after, we turned our weapons homeward, sparing the court from neglect. Upon returning to the vermilion steps, I reverently received the emperor’s grace and humbly acknowledge the favor of the Dao. Thus, I now offer thanks and repay this debt.

Following the standards of the *Dongxuan* and the rituals of the *Lingbao*, I have examined the rites for the long night of the Nine Dark Springs and adhered to the *Yugui*’s *Mingzhen* protocols. With utmost sincerity, I have conducted this fast and offering to repay the divine mercy.

I humbly beseech the Three Realms to shine their light and the hosts of heaven to show compassion. May the nine generations of ancestors and the seven lineages be delivered from the suffering of the dark gates, and may my kin and relations enjoy felicity in this illustrious age.

I bear the karmic faults of past lives and the enmities of former existences. Since assuming my duties, I have incurred both public and private transgressions—whether in rewards or punishments misapplied, or judgments ill-considered. The resentment of the people and my own errors are recorded in the unseen ledgers. Thus, obstacles have constantly beset me, and I have known no smooth passage. Day and night, my heart is heavy with sorrow and trepidation. Through this offering and repentance, I beg for the absolution of all these faults.

My son Zhaoyin died before reaching his prime. His wandering soul now dwells in a foreign realm; his untimely passing fills me with profound grief. Whether by malevolent influences or the restraint of dark spirits, I earnestly implore the power of the Dao to guide his spirit to life. May he cross the Southern Palace’s flowing fire and ascend to the radiant precincts of the Upper Realms. May he partake in the mysteries, attain enlightenment, and ascend to perfection. May his sins be absolved and his karmic debts resolved.

May my own calamities be lifted, my misfortunes dispelled, and my rank, emoluments, and longevity further extended. With unwavering devotion, I shall forever repay the emperor’s grace; through diligent cultivation, I shall uphold the protection of the Perfected Ones.

**Petition for the *Mingzhen* Offering for the Deceased Father by Wang Chengyan**

I have heard that the Supreme Dao unfolded its plan, and the Three Honored Ones bestowed their teachings. Their kindness extended to both the hidden and the manifest, their grace permeated life and death. They traversed the Eight Gates, spreading compassion to relieve suffering; moved by the sorrows of the dark night, they turned the torch of the Dharma to cast its light. The Southern Palace opens its courtyard of refinement, and the cinnabar registers initiate the ledgers of transcendence. The wise youths of the upper realms desire to know the causes of sin and blessing; the flying deities and divine beings request the forms of repentance and supplication. Expounding the profound and wondrous canon of *Mingzhen*, they deliver souls from the dark gates; unfolding the numinous rites of the *Yugui*, they dissolve the trials of the deceased. The obscurities of the mysterious and pure are dispelled, and parched sorrows are quenched. All lost souls are rescued and become beings of bliss. Through endless kalpas, all bathe in the mysterious mercy.

My late father encountered the winds of the Dao in his time and frequently partook in the sacred registers. Born in an age of sagely rule, he repeatedly attained official honors. Yet within the web of the world, could he have been without error? Amid the dust of the mortal realm, he must have incurred transgressions. Moreover, as steward of the kitchens, he was required to slaughter; as commander of troops, he often meted out punishments. Leading an army in the field or serving in the inner court, he may have oppressed the strong or protected the weak. Though he issued three commands and five exhortations, any misjudgment of severity or leniency would have constituted an offense. Separated from his homeland by war and chaos, his ancestral tombs may have been desecrated, and disputes over graves may have extended to his descendants. In selling his property and relocating his residence, the construction of earth and timber may have offended the bright spirits. For all these causes of anxiety, I now seek repentance and absolution.

Thus, I have followed the standards of the *Lingbao* and established a *Mingzhen* ritual altar. With pure incense and lamps, abundant offerings and sincere vows, I lay bare my heart and beg for grace. I humbly implore the Three Honored Ones of the Supreme and the hosts of saints in the ten directions to cast their divine light downward and pour forth their benevolent favor. May my late father’s accumulated sins and deep calamities across lifetimes be pardoned, his name erased from the earthly ledgers, and his essence cleansed in the celestial thoroughfares.

For past transgressions of accidental harm, for the debts of former grievances, for the faults that have extended to descendants, and for the blemishes of ancestral resentments—may all these be absolved, leaving inner and outer purity.

Thus, I beseech that the elixir of divine refinement be bestowed, that his name be inscribed in the Registers of Azure Radiance. May he bypass the trials of Mount Tai and Fengdu, and swiftly attain the celestial path of blessed halls. Above, may the Nine Lineages be delivered, the Seven Ancestors ascend; may graves rest in peace, the netherworld lie still. May the Three Paths and Six Realms together partake in this sublime merit, and may both kin and allies alike receive luminous protection.

With heart carved open and tears wiped in blood, I bow my head and pray to Heaven. Overcome with sobbing and choking grief, I humbly submit these words.

**Prayer for Clear Skies by the Crown Prince at a Banquet for Generals**

It is said that the supreme Dao responds to circumstances as echo answers sound, and that the enlightened spirits attend to devotion as shadow follows form. Reflecting on the unseen blessings I have received, I am ever grateful for the grace bestowed.

On the twenty-second day of the sixth month, the Crown Prince hosted a gathering for his generals, having already selected an auspicious hour. As this was the season of summer rains, prayers for clear skies were offered. Indeed, the divine favor was granted, and this earnest plea was answered. In but a moment, the torrential downpour ceased. The mountains gleamed in dawn’s verdant light, the sky cleared as if a screen had drawn back the clouds; the six directions were swept by pure winds, and the sun, hastening onward, saw the Radiant One take up the reins. The banquet was fully prepared, and all within and without rejoiced together.

Now, as we prepare to mobilize our forces and commence punitive action, a thousand troops surge like thunder, and the mountains and rivers are freed from the threat of mud and flood. Ten thousand horses race like stars, their armor and weapons gleaming with crystalline brilliance. Awaiting the pacification of the rebellious and the great deliverance of the people, I seek to repay the Perfected Officials and thus present this offering of a fast. Lotus lamps cluster in the night, orchid tassels flutter at dawn. The rites are performed with utmost reverence, incense and flowers abundant in their splendor.

May this reach the sages of the Pure Capital, and may the merits of the Purple Palace be further exalted. I knock my head in reverence to the mysterious power, that the great enterprise may flourish. Overcome with devotion, I humbly submit these words.

**The Emperor’s Prayer for the Yellow Register Fast in Honor of Lord Lao**

It is said that before the chaos of primordial vastness, beyond the formless and silent, there dwells the Supreme Sage, whose radiance fills the Nine Heavens. He expounds the school of tranquil emptiness and practices the teaching of non-action. From the Three Antiquities onward, across the ten thousand regions, the reverence for the true wind has assisted and fulfilled the transformations of the age.

Since the inception of governance and the assumption of the throne, I have constantly striven to manifest sincerity, ever offering reverence and devotion. The divine favor has been repeatedly bestowed, and auspicious blessings have followed one another. The immortal abode granted the talisman of the Mandate, greatly securing the foundation of the realm; the Hall of Audience gave rise to prayers of supplication, and the response was invariably felt.

Thus, wind and rain have been harmonious, malevolent influences have not arisen, the four borders have known no alarms, and the hundred grains have flourished. Grateful for these graces, I earnestly seek to express my thanks.

Therefore, at this season, I specially establish the fast altar, observing three days of reverent solemnity and six periods of purification. I hope that through this offering, I may repay the mysterious power above.

Now, as I dispatch masters and disciples to quell the rebellious, I still rely on the power of the Dao to eradicate the nests of evil. Borrowing the might of Fenglong and Lieque, may the clans of the greedy and rapacious be swept away. May further blessings be bestowed, and the realm forever enjoy peace. Overcome with devotion and longing, I humbly submit these words.

**Prayer by the Imperial Son-in-Law of Shuzhou for the Yellow Register Ritual of Disaster Dispelling and Salvation**

Your servant has heard that the supreme Dao is profound and subtle, its mysterious power vast and great. It encompasses the myriad heavens to spread transformation and extends its grace to all beings.

Thus it can descend to deliver those beyond the gates of darkness, broadly pacify the state and nation, stabilize and secure the land, and harmonize and enlighten the spirits. All rejoice in the governance of the Ruler, exhausting the power of compassionate mercy. From ancient times to the present, none—whether hidden or manifest—are left unblessed.

Your servant has long revered the mysterious grace and early received the imperial favor. Yet before I could render even the slightest service, I was suddenly honored with the dignity of office, burdened with the weight of manifold duties, and charged with overseeing criminal law, adjudicating disputes. I feared straying from the principles of benevolence and forgiveness; leading troops, I truly lacked the essentials of discipline and order, and my actions often incurred faults and blame. Constantly gripped by trepidation and anxiety, since assuming governance of this commandery, I have ever remained vigilant and cautious. Yet calamity and punishment have swiftly befallen me—how dare I hope for survival? Bound by ritual constraints, there is no escape from destruction. Though I cling to this fleeting breath, further profound grace has descended. With bloodied tears, I cry out to Heaven—lonely and helpless, to whom can I appeal?

I have heard that the Mysterious Origin established the teachings, and the Purple Yang possesses the rites of deliverance; the Orthodox Unity transmitted its precepts, and the Yellow Register offers the path of repentance and prayer. Therefore, I dare to solemnly purify the public office, erect the altar for the fast, prostrate myself before the Nine Heavens with this memorial, and send forth my words to the Three Realms. I humbly implore the Three Honored Ones and the host of sages to extend their compassionate mercy; may the nightly courts and the gates of the Yellow Springs open the way to ascension. May the soul of the Lady of Yun State, such-and-such, attain peace and prosperity, her blessings and goodness perfumed by virtue. May all her accumulated transgressions and deep stains be washed away. Unbound by the earthly prisons, may she ascend directly to the Heavenly Hall.

May the seven generations of ancestors and the nine lineages of descendants, all those departed and passed away, together ascend by the power of the Dao and assemble in the courtyard of blessings. Within the halls of this dwelling, repeatedly renovated and altered, I fear that disturbances may have arisen, preventing tranquility. I pray that through the merit of this fast and offering, the transgressions of offense and violation may be resolved. May the dragon spirits return to their positions, the earth gods be at peace, the residence be favorable and fitting, and all misfortunes and disasters be extinguished. May the city gods of the walls and moats, the local deities of the wards and domains, and the true officials of the land secretly receive divine favor and forever dwell in the land of blessings.

Above, I wish for the imperial enterprise to be firmly prosperous and the sagely lifespan to extend in abundance. May the Crown Prince and the various princes uphold great fortune in service to the state; may the empress, consorts, and imperial concubines receive radiant blessings to assist the court. May the officials within and beyond the court, the six armies, and the myriad people together rejoice in flourishing fortune and attain perfect peace and stability. May the years bring abundant harvests, and the customs be free from plague and pestilence. Within the realm, may the ten thousand regions be unified. May all together reach the land of benevolence and longevity, and together uphold the transformation of supreme peace.

With utmost reverence, I prostrate myself, lay bare my heart, and offer my sincerest and most earnest prayers.

Respectfully submitted by Zhang Taibo, Prefect of Qiongzhou, on behalf of the restoration of the withered cypress at Heming, for the performance of the Golden Register Fast.

I have heard that the supreme Dao is profoundly penetrating, and divine power broadly operates. It shapes and completes Heaven and Earth, and assists and praises the emperors and kings.

The sovereigns of Fuxi, Shennong, and Suiren, the lords of Yao, Shun, Yu, and Tang—none failed to take the profound and formless as their teacher, drawing forth harmony and radiance. Thus did they secure the enduring majesty of their dynasties and amplify the resplendence of their renown. Some rode the winds across the azure seas; others attained ranks in the Purple Courts. Their light illumined the nine distant realms, their longevity matched the Three Luminaries.

We humbly reflect upon the Great Emperor of Shu, who governs the pivot of the cosmos and grasps the Dipper to stabilize the primordial. Wielding the Great Image, he pacifies Hua and Yi; mounting the Six Dragons, he soothes the hundred millions. His virtue surpasses that of Yao and Yu; his sagacity exceeds that of Fuxi and Shennong. The lords of the felt tents and distant lands present tribute and turn toward civilization; the barbarians beyond the Han’s farthest reaches, though their tongues differ, come as guests. His beneficence saturates mountains and rivers; his benevolence extends to grasses and trees. Sacred birds nest in the inner gardens; auspicious beasts dwell in Shanglin. The triple blossoms manifest omens; the ten cowries signal wonders. Yet still he labors in humility, yielding virtue to the celestial mandate; though his deeds overflow the bamboo annals, his modesty deepens.

Now, with the hidden aid of immortals and the gracious descent of numinous transformation, profound blessings moisten the withered roots, and branches and trunks revive upon the dead cypress. When the wind stirs the verdant cliffs, its fragrance drifts far and near; when the moon passes the sacred altar, the luxuriant shadows reappear. This auspicious sign surpasses all in antiquity. It reveals the flourishing of the imperial lineage and the eternal endurance of the sacred reign. Though the sprouting grain in the ancestral temple and the *ming* leaves in the vermilion court were wondrous of old, they pale beside this divine response.

I, honored to encounter this flourishing fortune and entrusted with the seal of this prefecture, have witnessed this supreme omen. With brush and ink, I present it at the Dragon Gate; with silk and thread, it is proclaimed upon the Phoenix Edict. The imperial response bestowed, the rites of offering and prayer are solemnly renewed. Praise resounds in splendor; honor and favor abound. Though I measure the imperial grace, the vast sea is not deep enough; bearing the sacred favor, heaven and earth cannot repay.

Daring to seize the emperor’s natal day, I establish the Golden Register Daoist sanctuary, raising my crimson heart in reverence, to beseech the mysterious blessings. May the hosts of heaven descend their gaze; may the ten thousand sages manifest their presence. Pour vast fortune upon the altars of state and the august spirits; augment radiant protection for the ancestral temples and former sages. May the Two Modes stand firm; may the myriad states share a common script. May the emperor’s longevity equal Mounts Min and Emei; may his brilliance match the sun and moon. May he universally proclaim the correct calendar and unify the earth beneath the seas.

May the empress receive blessings in the Purple Chamber and extend her years through the cinnabar registers. May the crown prince forever uphold the imperial pole, nurturing virtue in the Azure Palace. May the princesses, consorts, and concubines honor and assist the sacred sun. May the myriad princes and officials revere and support the imperial foundation. May the nine lands enjoy peace; may the five weapons be sheathed. May the dust of war vanish; may the harvests be abundant. May all beings—those that move and grow, fly and sink, the three paths and six destinies—together receive the imperial bounty and all attain the courts of fortune.

I vow to pour forth the principles of loyalty and filial piety, repaying the sagely grace from above.

*Guangcheng ji*, Volume 6 begins

The Most Reverend Du Guangting, Great Virtue of Literary Composition by Imperial Commission and Purple-Robe Honoree of the Supreme Clarity Palace in the Upper Capital, respectfully presents the *Jiao* Petitions for the Northern Emperor’s Yamen Ritual.

We humbly acknowledge that the Five Qi’s Mysterious Heaven and the Great Emperor of the Northern Palace oversee good and evil, govern life and death. All matters of longevity, fortune, fortune, and misfortune are subject to their judgment and record. We fear that celestial asterisms may bring calamities of illumination upon us, and that our fate in this life and our annual destiny may incur the faults of punishment and harm. We beseech the Perfected Saints to specially prepare expiatory rites. With utmost sincerity, we jointly perform the *jiao* ritual, humbly praying for the dissolution of disasters and the extension of years. May our names be stricken from the death registers of the Northern Feng and inscribed in the life rolls of the Southern Culmen. May public and private affairs flourish in harmony, and our families dwell in peace. Thus do we look up to receive the benevolent protection of the Imperial Lord.

**Petition for the Three Assemblies’ Register Ritual**

Your servant has received the Orthodox Perfection and partaken of the Mysterious Registers, inwardly aspiring to cultivation to preserve body and mind, and outwardly hoping for numinous power to dispel disasters and pestilence. Following the ritual codes, I have early attained the precious talismans. Yet I fear being constrained by worldly affairs and ensnared by mundane mechanisms. On days of fasting and abstinence, my morning audiences may be deficient; at times of cultivation, incense and lamps may be lacking. Good deeds remain unestablished, while faults and transgressions readily manifest. The Perfected Qi and Numinous Officials have not bestowed their protection, and the Mysterious Bureau of Heaven’s Court reproaches my lack of devotion. The three destinies and five phases have not dispelled calamities and declines. Day and night, I am filled with dread, as if holding ice and fire in my breast.

Now, on the day of the Upper Assembly and the time when the Heavenly Officials review merits and demerits—when all deeds, good and evil, great and small, are laid bare—we dare to pour forth our sincerity, repent our faults with utmost devotion, and diligently perform the *jiao* ritual, presenting this petition. We implore the host of saints to show mercy, pardon our transgressions, and send down numinous responses to dissolve disasters and misfortunes. May the officers and soldiers of the Three Bureaus ever grant their protection. May we enjoy health and peace in all our movements and repose, forever partaking of

**Petition for the Northern Dipper *Jiao* Ritual by Attendant Wang Qian**

Your servant, though base and insignificant, has been blessed to encounter the transformation of the Dao. Constantly receiving your sheltering protection, I am truly indebted to your true compassion. Since the first year of the *Longji* era, when I was dispatched on a mission to the branch commanderies, I carried the imperial decree forth—only to suddenly tread upon the mechanism of disaster. In that perilous dread, the true numina looked down in aid. My body and life were preserved, all anxieties and doubts dispelled. Yet, separated by two lands, we have been cut off for three years. My son, Yan Gui, earnestly offered prayers and supplications, repeatedly beseeching the divine luminaries. Heaven’s scrutiny of his sincerity ran deep, and he personally witnessed the response in omens. Gazing up to the Most Sagely, I am shielded by this extraordinary grace. I yearn to exhaust my cinnabar heart in repayment and thanksgiving.

Now, at the great festival of the Upper Prime and the auspicious time for invoking blessings, I have prepared the *jiao* altar to requite your radiant favor. I humbly implore you to overlook the meagerness of this offering and accept my humble sincerity. Fulfill the vow of old in this very year, and bestow your grace upon this day. I shall forever uphold my devotion to bear the divine hemp.

**Petition for the Southern Dipper *Jiao* Ritual by Minister Ma**

I have heard that when the clear and turbid divided their forms, the high and low were fixed in their stations. The Northern and Southern Dippers govern the registers of life and death, while yin and yang partake of expansion and contraction. Thus, the august deities of the Southern Dipper—saints of the Six Palaces—record merits and exalt goodness, inscribing the script of immortality. They preside over the ledgers of fate and determine the years, ever initiating the root of long life. Their wish is that all things return to the Dao, and all people ascend to perfection, complementing the Heavenly Honored One’s boundless compassion and upholding the Great Dao’s principle of cherishing life.

Yet the waves of the dusty world easily drown, and the mind’s horses vie in their gallop. The net of transgressions is a tight cage; none find a path to soar. The passions are firmly barred, never a gate of liberation. Your servant dwells in the mortal realm, his heart shackled by worldly duties. Holding the reins of power, he must enforce the statutes of reward and punishment; overseeing punishments and rewards, he cannot indulge in the harmony of equanimity. I fear my faults and errors have accumulated in the courts of the unseen. Moreover, with calamities and misfortunes converging, this has become a time of tribulation. Though I have repeatedly offered prayers and repentance, knocking at the gates of heaven, I have not yet poured forth my luminous sincerity to lay it before the Southern Culmen.

Now, on this auspicious day of divination and felicity, I have reverently arranged the *jiao* altar. Following the true canons, I lay bare my cinnabar sincerity. The multitudes of the lower realm humbly display their offerings upon the jade steps; the radiant perfected of the upper realm will surely descend to the jeweled mats. I dare to hope for your compassionate pardon, that you might look upon this humble one with mercy. Release my sins and dispel disasters, striking my name from the yin ledgers of the Northern Palace. Bestow added years and augment my blessings, inscribing my name in the yang registers of the Southern Dipper. May the Six Palaces forever record my name, and may the Five Planets secretly nourish my fortune. I pray that my ninefold ancestors and sevenfold lineage receive blessings from the Vermilion Mound, and that my fivefold kin and sixfold affines extend their felicity in the Purple Palace. I vow to diligently uphold my devotion in repayment of your vast compassion.

**Li Guan’s Prayer for the Nine Luminaries Offering**

I have heard that the two qi descend in harmony, thereby shaping all things; the Three Radiances spread their forms to nurture the multitude of beings. Among these, the most numinous is revered, as it receives the bright blessings of Heaven. All matters of conduct and concealment, good and evil, movement and rest, fortune and misfortune—all are governed by the heavens above, which oversee the earth below.

I, your servant, have fortunately inherited past blessings and have been graced by the winds of the Dao. In serving my lord and establishing myself, I have striven to fulfill the duty of loyalty and sincerity. In reflecting upon myself, I have constantly maintained a heart of reverent caution. The emoluments and ranks I have received are bestowed by the divine luminaries. Yet my anxieties have only deepened, for I fear my flaws may bring peril.

For years, I have been afflicted by an eye ailment, enduring persistent suffering. Though acupuncture and medicine have been applied, and I have diligently consumed remedies, I have not yet recovered, and my dread has only grown. I fear that the cycles of yin and yang in this year have brought me grave misfortune, and that the movements of the celestial luminaries have conspired to deepen my distress.

I have previously offered prayers and sacrifices, hoping to attain peace, yet now, as the Dark Void passes through my natal palace, my long-standing illness coincides with this calamitous period. With no recourse before me, I am left bewildered and without support.

I have heard that the true statutes provide a method, and the rituals of offering and libation are recorded in sacred texts. Thus, I humbly exert my utmost sincerity, hoping for the divine gaze. I diligently perform the offering rites, inviting the descent of your august presence.

I beseech the mighty deities of the Nine Luminaries, who divide their light to illuminate and receive. Dissolve my past transgressions, reconcile my grievances, and dispel the entanglements of disaster. Remove the afflictions of my illness. May the Purple Youth guard and protect me, so that my eyes suffer no further pain; may the Azure Emperor shield me, so that my liver enjoys peace and tranquility. May misfortune and decline forever cease, and may my official rank and lifespan be renewed.

I dare not forget my vow of diligent cultivation, that I may repay the gift of your illumination.

**Prayer of Minister Ma to the Northern Emperor**

I, your humble servant, though of lowly station, have long heard of the transformative power of the Dao. I have settled my heart in tranquility and directed my thoughts toward the true and upright. Each time I have offered sincere prayers, I have been graciously blessed with manifest protection.

Recently, as the public fields were opened and the wheat in the furrows began to grow, the lingering days of spring brought warmth, yet the dense clouds of oil-like rain had not yet spread. Gazing upon the farmlands, I was filled with deep concern. I knocked upon the gates of the mysterious, and indeed, your vast grace descended. Where the incense from the censer dispersed, the stones glistened with moisture; when the forbidden water was sprinkled, it transformed into a rain as rich as cream. Thus, the autumn harvest became promising, and the spring plowing proceeded without error. The granaries of the capital may soon overflow, bringing abundance to the lands of Shu.

The favor bestowed by the supreme sages is profound, yet how may this lowly servant repay such virtue? I humbly swept the jade altar and arranged a modest offering. Though the bundled water-plants and pondweed are unworthy as offerings, I dare present them alongside silk, candles, incense, and flowers as a small token of gratitude. I pray you deign to accept them and bestow lasting auspicious blessings.

In gratitude for past kindnesses and in prayer for future grace, I dare not elaborate further.

**Prayer of Minister Ma to the Southern Dipper**

I have heard that the Great Sage is impartial, responding to sincerity and answering prayers. The perfected ones descend to aid, manifesting their presence in answer to devotion. Their transformations are unhindered by the mundane, and their salvation extends even to the lowliest.

I, your servant, though obscure and unworthy, have secretly admired the mysteries of the Dao. I have purified my heart and relied upon the realm of emptiness, secretly hoping to repent my sins; I have bowed my head in reverence toward the vast and formless, praying to cleanse my past transgressions. First, I sought deliverance for my sevenfold ancestors; next, I prayed for harmony and peace in the four directions.

No sooner had I expressed my humble sincerity than your boundless compassion descended. A divine communion was granted, and I received an auspicious dream. My soul was clear and my qi refreshed, entirely unlike the time when Zhuangzi dreamed of a butterfly; I felt as content as the fisherman who obtained the pearl. This surely portends a year of abundance and the cessation of disasters.

Reflecting upon the divine favor, I now offer this grand blessing. Overwhelmed with gratitude, I am at a loss for words. To repay this spiritual grace, I have once more performed the offering rites. The paired mandarin-duck lamps emitted flames, their light mingling with the radiance of the Jade Dipper; the dragon-shaped incense wafted fragrance, scattering the hues of the Jasper Pool. Casting aside all distractions, I united my heart in devotion.

I beseech the perfected ones of the Cinnabar Palace and the exalted sages of the Six Palaces to turn their crane-drawn chariots and briefly descend beneath the rainbow banners. Accept my humble sincerity and take pity on this degenerate age. Brush clean the golden tablets of longevity and open the vast pardon of great mercy. Grant me extended years and renew my blessings. In governance, may the three agricultural seasons yield abundance; in military affairs, may the seven virtues display their might. May transgressions be erased, public and private affairs flourish, the living and the dead receive blessings, and my kin enjoy prolonged life.

May the Northern Prime expunge the records of my past faults, and may the Nine Treasuries inscribe my name in the registers of extended years. Moreover, as the Five Planets move in their courses, they may at times align with the Three Primes, influencing my fate with hardship or fortune. When the time comes to transform misfortune into blessing, or to reduce my rank and shorten my years, the common lot cannot fathom such matters, and I am left to ponder my fate with worry. Without relying on the compassion of the Dao, there would be no means of self-deliverance.

I have heard that the Most High established the rites of expiation, and the Heavenly Master inscribed the statutes of prayer and offering. Sins are surely erased, and blessings are granted in response to prayer. Today, on the day of my nativity, I humbly present the texts of the Orthodox Unity. Reverently bowing, I arrange this modest offering. To the Three Palaces and Five Planets, I offer my sincere prayers; to the Six Treasuries and Seven Primes, I express my repentance and gratitude.

I pray that the multitude of exalted ones will bestow their protection, and that the Great Sages will deign to descend. Pardon my past transgressions and bestow future blessings. May the Three Disasters be stilled, and the Nine Calamities dispelled. May my lifespan be secretly extended, and my blessings and rank flourish. May my sevenfold ancestors and ninefold lineage transcend the dark prisons; may my fivefold kin and sixfold affines equally receive the shade of the Dao. May public and private affairs forever prosper, and may the living and the dead enjoy peace and well-being.

I now look up in reverence to the boundless grace of the Great Sages.

**Tang Dongqing’s Prayer for the Natal Day Offering**

I, your servant, by the fate of my past lives, have encountered the transformative power of the Dao. I have received and upheld the true registers, thereby gaining the opportunity to cultivate myself. Yet my merits and deeds remain unremarkable, and my transgressions and faults easily accumulate. The cycles of yin and yang have gone awry, and I have been afflicted by illness. Overwhelmed with worry, my prayers have been earnest. Indeed, I have received manifest protection and swiftly attained recovery.

On the day of the Middle Prime, I wished to hold a gathering for the Yellow Registers, humbly informing the perfected sages and hoping to fulfill my sincere devotion. Now, the altar rites have been completed, and the merits and virtues have been accomplished. The covenants have been answered, and the winds and rains have not intruded.

The profound kindness of the sagely and numinous is felt in the unseen, yet its repayment remains beyond measure. Daring to take this life’s destiny as occasion, I reverently prepare the ritual observances. Setting forth a modest offering to express my sincerity, I bow in homage to the sacred writ and entreat blessings. Humbly I pray that the Most Exalted may deign to receive this, and that the host of sages may shine their presence upon us. May the vows previously made now come to fruition, and extraordinary auspices descend. Let my transgressions dissolve and misfortunes vanish, my deeds flourish and merits abound. May those I serve in filial devotion be preserved in peace and tranquility, and those I commend from afar surely partake in elevation and deliverance. I shall forever steel my resolve and sincerity to repay the true numina.

No words suffice.

Memorial for the Ritual Offering at the Abbey of the Venerable Master, Mount Qingcheng

I humbly reflect: the immortal mountain of Qingcheng, the sacred abbey of the Venerable Master—its nine chambers open into countless grottoes, and gazing upon the myriad peaks, it stands supreme. Since the Yellow Emperor bestowed its enfeoffment, the Han sovereigns offered their veneration; since Xuanzong erected its halls, former emperors augmented its splendor. The immortal chambers grew ever more majestic, the pure altars ever more solemn. Recently, a worthy magistrate has undertaken its restoration, renewing the numinous palace. Yet to the west of the main sanctuary, vacant land still lies; to the north of the secluded windows, remnants of old foundations remain. The image of the Dark Primordial has yet to be enshrined, while the traces of the imperial scion linger still. I venture, therefore, to propose the construction of an ancestral hall and the establishment of a fasting chamber. May these serve perpetually as the site for offerings and reverence, and enhance the purity and emptiness of this sacred realm. As we prepare to wield shovels and spades, we fear disturbing the dragon spirits. Thus, I dare to arrange this ritual feast and reverently present this solemn announcement. Humbly I pray that this sincere entreaty be granted, and that mysterious blessings descend, ensuring the work’s completion without hindrance above or below. May laborers and artisans dwell in peace and safety, and blessings and goodness be renewed. No words suffice.

**Prayer for the Nine Luminaries Ritual at Zhangren Mountain**

It is heard that when Heaven and Earth divided their numinous powers, the Three Offices fixed the patterns of life and death; when yin and yang suspended their images, the Nine Luminaries bestowed their illuminating radiance. The Southern Palace unfurls the talisman of extended years, while the Northern Bureau displays the register of transgressions. As stars traverse mountains and rivers, their scrutiny admits no partiality. All within the human realm are governed by their dominion.

I, though humble and unworthy, have been graced with profound compassion. Yet in my conduct, I fear I have strayed from hidden blessings; in my thoughts, I have failed to align with the divine. Thus, misfortune has befallen me, compounded by faults and errors. Adversity has swiftly converged, leaving no path for repentance or prayer.

This year, the Central Palace is under the sway of the Celestial Talisman; my station is illuminated by the gaze of Saturn. The great cycle still resides within the baleful stars, and the flying banners are ensnared by the year’s progression. In the three destinies and five phases, I dread encountering harm and conflict; among the constellations and Nine Luminaries, I fear further illumined scrutiny. Hence, my path remains rough, and calamities arise in succession. Without recourse to the Most Sage, there is no way to seek deliverance.

Therefore, I dare to offer my utmost sincerity and conduct this grand ritual. Humbly I pray that the host of sages deign to descend with blessings, dispelling future disasters and absolving past transgressions. May the Six Offices of Destiny augment my fortune in the Crimson Heavens, and may the Seven Sovereign Deities of the Primal Ultimate bestow auspicious favor. May public and private affairs flourish in tranquility, and my kin dwell in peace and health. Thus shall I forever bear the grace of the sages’ protection.

**Prayer for the Life-Prolonging Ritual of the Circumpolar Stars by Vice Envoy Mo Tingyi, Magistrate of Qingcheng**

It is heard that the transformative power of the Dao spreads forth, its mysterious workings embracing all. The unfathomable interplay of yin and yang nurtures all without partiality.

Thus do the Five Emperors and Three Sovereigns govern the Six Rituals and order all things; the Celestial Offices and Watery Palaces oversee the Eight Assemblies and uphold the great net. The Southern Palace records the statutes of good, while the Northern Culmen binds the ranks of transgression. Fortune and misfortune, guilt and blessing—all are tied to the numinous bureaus.

This humble servant reflects that the sacred precincts of All-Sichuan, the metropolis of Huayang, command the frontiers of eight lands and pacify the manifold tribes. Its jade encampments stand lofty, its golden terraces tower high. Abroad, it purifies alien customs, its might and grace drawing equally upon civil and martial arts; within, it wields a mighty host, its decrees enforcing both reward and punishment.

Your servant humbly observes that Minister Zhang has long borne the weight of authority, wielding it with unswerving loyalty. Above, he receives the sagely designs; below, he follows the temple’s grand strategy. At times, he deploys the tiger-like troops to sweep the frontiers clean; at others, he recovers cities and fortresses, leveling the borders. Now he roots out the treacherous and cunning, crushing the violent and overbearing; now he oversees the levying of taxes and the provisioning of the army. Given these manifold affairs, how could punishments be withheld? Yet this servant deeply fears that in the swiftness of execution, errors of weight or lightness may arise, leading to divine censure—all without prior repentance or supplication.

Moreover, the Three Destinies and Five Phases may yet bring decline and adversity; the bright stars may dim, or baleful influences descend. The workings of the spirit-way are profoundly subtle, beyond the reach of mortal understanding. Without recourse to the utmost sagacity, deep stains cannot be cleansed.

Thus does this servant venture to approach the numinous mountain and conduct this grand ritual, traversing the yin and yang bureaus of Heaven and Earth, circling the palaces of stars, sun, and moon. With heart laid bare, he beseeches grace and repents past transgressions. Humbly he prays that the far-shining numinous light may scrutinize and erase all former faults; that beneficent favor may descend, stilling future calamities. May true blessing be vouchsafed, ever fostering fortune and felicity. May the red registers record his extended years, and the black ledgers strike his name from the rolls of guilt. Thus shall the land flourish, and all beings forever dwell in peace. The debt of gratitude is beyond expression.

**Memorial for the Zhou-Tian Offering to the River Lord by Mo Tingyi**

I have heard that the Primal Sage unfolds his radiance, his lofty majesty condescending to transform all. His grace suffuses the ten thousand kinds, his compassion overspreads the myriad heavens. He suspends the luminous statutes of sin and blessing, and sets forth the great law of life and death. Above, he watches over the state; below, he extends to all ministers. All alike enter the gate of his governance, all heed the lessons of his reproof and encouragement. From antiquity to the present, his order remains unconfused, and not the slightest fault escapes his notice.

Your servant reflects that to assist the sagely and establish merit, none but the worthy can accomplish it; to uphold the imperiled and rescue the distressed, none but the virtuous can take the lead. Military Commissioner Wang, his loyalty piercing the divine, his fidelity guarding the altars of state, displayed martial prowess to restore the former court to rightness and drummed forth benevolent transformation to bring peace to the present sage’s reign. For these abundant merits, he was granted this great command.

Yet in the course of his duties, he may have stormed palace gates and extirpated malevolent forces; marched his troops through the Qin heartlands and mustered his legions in Baochuan; swept clean the庸 and Shu lands and pacified the heavens of Tianpeng. Though he quelled the frontier and suppressed the violent, it was not by choice that he could not lay down arms. Thus did he proclaim the Son of Heaven’s might and wield the general’s axe—all in service of righteousness, all for the sake of the times. Still, I fear that in the unavoidable slaying, unintended harm may have arisen, giving rise to unseen offenses. The celestial bureaus and earthly registers may yet record these transgressions. Moreover, I dread that the stars of fate may have cast their baleful influence, that his current year may bear misfortune, that the cycles of fortune may bring decline, or that the astrological divisions may portend calamity. It is thus necessary to prepare this repentance and confession, that all may be illuminated and cleansed.

Your servant, though unworthy of his office, has consulted the sacred texts and charts. With utmost sincerity, I now reverently present this grand offering. I purify the rites and hymns upon the immortal peaks, and offer fine grains upon the numinous altar. Above, I knock upon the void and pray to the highest heavens; below, I bow to the nine earths and entreat with reverence. May my earnest thoughts reach the true powers, and may their blessings flow abundantly.

I pray that the Northern Palace may absolve all sins, and the Southern Culmen extend life. May the obstructions of the Five Phases be dissolved, and the misfortunes of the Three Fates be eradicated. May his years stretch as broad as the rivers, his emoluments rise as high as the mountains. May the grain harvests be bountiful, and the common people rejoice in harmony. May he ever support the sagely sun, and forever bless all beings.

Above, I pray that the state’s destiny be long and enduring, that the sagely court enjoy profound peace, that weapons fall silent, and that the realm be united under one civil order. May the Three Luminaries follow their proper courses in the highest heavens, and may the ten thousand kinds flourish upon the earth below. Whether in the hidden or the manifest, whether upon water or land, may all alike bathe in the true compassion and together attain the great blessings.

I am unworthy.

**Memorial for the Zhou-Tian Offering by Mo Tingyi**

I prostrate myself before the myriad spirits of Heaven and Earth, who fulfill their offices in yin and yang. They spread forth the transformations of the Dao, sustaining and nurturing all beings.

The Northern Culmen and Western Palace wield penal statutes to determine transgressions; the Southern Chariot and Eastern Mansion dispense nurturing care to proclaim merit. From emperors and kings down to all officials and commoners, all submit to the governance of the celestial stewards, who distinguish fortune from misfortune.

I have long been favored by karmic blessings and, though unworthy, have entered the official registers. I tread the path of peril and hardship amid the season of weapons and armor. Once following the military banners, twice residing in famed cities, yet the frontiers stretch far and distant, and the levies are heavy and numerous. If I govern with leniency, the collection of taxes yields no results; if with severity, the weary and weak harbor resentment. It is no easier than herding chickens, and far harder than taming pheasants. Moreover, as harmony has not yet been fully achieved, I must still rely on punishments and rewards. Though I have eradicated self-interest and followed only reason, I still fear that the weight of my judgments may deviate from the Middle Way. Deeply anxious over unintended errors, I have thus accumulated flaws and blemishes.

I further fear that the celestial luminaries may cast their influence upon me, or that the years I traverse may bring obstruction, thereby giving rise to calamity and decline. Here, where the borders adjoin immortal mountains, clouds veil the true temples; where grottoes embrace thunder and rain, the earth gathers dragons and spirits. Gazing upward toward the divine capital within the formless, I wish to lay bare my sincere entreaties; beholding the jade countenance beyond the mists and clouds, I pray for the descent of profound compassion.

Therefore, in accordance with the ancient rites of the *Lingbao*, I have arranged the Great Zhou-Tian Offering. It extends to the palaces and courts of the nine regions and invokes the majestic spirits of the ten poles. With bowed hands and reverent submission, I wholeheartedly pray and repent. May all sins, great and small—past transgressions and present faults, unseen disasters, and future misfortunes—all be absolved and pardoned. May you graciously grant expiation, dispel all adversities, reconcile long-standing grievances, and augment my modest blessings. May I attain long life, my nine generations ascend beyond, and the Three Paths open to peace.

May my family, kin by blood and bond, scattered across two lands, soon be reunited and together receive purity and fortune. Recently, during construction, I feared inadvertent harm might have been caused. I pray for safety and tranquility, that all may share in auspicious blessings. May the sacred temples within this domain, and the spirits presiding over rivers and marshes, protect the living and dispel malevolent influences. May the towns be free from flood and drought, and the people’s granaries overflow with abundance. Even those lost souls without refuge, adrift and wandering, may they partake of this blessing and attain freedom.

I am unworthy.

*Memorial for the Life-Command Offering at Mount Qingcheng by Mo Tingyi*

I prostrate myself before the Three Luminaries, which manifest auspicious signs, and the Nine Radiant Ones, which condense their splendor. Aligned with metal and wood to govern the directions, the four seasons proceed in proper order;...

Having established the symbols to fix yin and yang, the myriad beings come into existence. Presiding over the hidden and the manifest, You govern both transgression and fortune. I, in my humble and coarse nature, have been granted the honor of serving the True and Numinous. Yet I fear that in the course of my conduct, I may easily incur faults; in the path of cultivation, I have not yet aligned with the divine. Moreover, in the duties I oversee, both weighty and trivial matters rest upon me, and I dread straying from the eternal laws, thereby accumulating further errors.

Day and night, I serve in office, how dare I forget reverence and diligence? Yet good and ill fortune are difficult to foresee, and my apprehension only deepens. In addition, as the celestial bodies have their transits, I exhaust my pleas for repentance and prayer. Thus, on the occasion of my life-command, I reverently prepare this offering feast, presenting incense and flame to offer sincerity, and arranging star lamps to perform the rites.

May the Most Sublime and Sacred deign to look upon my earnest heart; may the Nine Radiant and Most Exalted Ones graciously bestow their mysterious favor. Absolve the faults of the past, dissolve the misfortunes yet to come. May grievances and debts be settled and leveled, inauspicious declines be swept away, and longevity and fortune be further augmented, ever accompanied by blessings and auspiciousness. May my family be secure in peace, and both public and private affairs flourish in harmony. I am unworthy.

**Prayer Upon the Completion of the Painted Merits at the Abbey of the Venerable Master**

Prostrate, I reflect: the immortal mountains of Green Citadel, the sacred abbey of the Venerable Master—long left unrepaired—have lately been restored to grandeur. Now that this great labor is complete, we have commissioned the work of painting. Within the vast hall, the true forms have been depicted: crane-like visages and cloud-borne countenances, as though one might encounter them in the hidden courts of the void; jade-like bearing and refined grace, as if they had descended from the limpid azure palace. Delightful to behold, awe-inspiring as if present in truth—we humbly pray that their numinous power may descend through the virtue of Water, and their blessings flow into the mortal realm. Thus, we perform this offering rite, reverently beseeching their gaze and protection. I am unworthy.

**Prayer for the Painted Images of the Five Marchmounts’ Deities**

Prostrate, I state: the Abbey of the Venerable Master, long fallen into ruin, has lately been restored. With the tasks of earth and timber now undertaken, the work of painting and adornment has been established. Within the secluded hall, the divine forms have been rendered: robes of kingfisher clouds and cinnabar brocade; vessels of dark jade and yellow cong; treasures of stellar radiance and solar essence; the distinctions of the Five Florals and Seven Honors; chariots drawn by two steeds or six horses; palanquins of cloud-wings and rosy canopies. Here are the deputy ministers and the eight mountain stewards who assist the Mandate; the august presences of the Marchmount Lords and Water Sovereigns; the ranks of the Stream Maidens and River Marquises; the elders of mountains and forests, the numinous overseers of pools and islets; the courts of emperors and kings, the offices conferred by canonical decree. Some govern the sea’s edge, eastward reaching Fangzhu; others preside over grotto-heavens, westward neighboring Kunlun’s peaks.

May all shake forth thunder and lightning, roar with dragons and whales. They inspect the hidden and manifest, record the rivers and marshes. They uphold the Supreme’s orthodox and true principles, proclaim the emperors’ nurturing grace. Drinking of the six qi, they complete the great transformation. Like autumn, winter, spring, and summer, they follow the seasonal commands without fail; like wind, rain, snow, and frost, they balance the year’s work without error. All receive the Mandate of Xuanyuan, each wielding the authority of governance. With the Marchmounts and waterways’ numinous hosts, they fulfill the offices of celestial oversight.

Thus the Perfected Lord of Mystery and Silence, bearing the weight of the august sanctuary, assumes the solemnity of imperial presence. The order of audience and tribute must be arrayed in solemn ranks. Now the master’s brush and artisan’s hand have adorned the walls in sequence, gleaming as stars in formation, towering like clouds in embrace. Thereupon, flowing robes and trailing sleeves, jade swords and pearl-studded scabbards; fiery pendants holding stars, jade tablets gathering moonlight. Some with faces like jasper and sleeves of fresh bloom seem to descend from Guye’s peaks; others in strange forms and wondrous postures appear to mirror the shores of Xunyang. The pigments are fully arrayed, resplendent and lifelike.

This must surely resonate with the divine spirits, entwining blessings and felicity. Above, it upholds the state; beside, it protects the common folk. It harmonizes the ten rains and five winds to bring forth the harvest; it pervades the nine provinces and six directions to achieve great harmony. Its vast design rivals the sun and moon, heaven and earth; its mysterious transformation encompasses all creatures, from the crawling to the rooted. Reverently we perform the libation and offering, earnestly we voice our prayers. We await the descent of mighty numen, the sure bestowal of auspicious favor.

Respectfully submitted.

**Prayer for the Life-Renewal Rite of Mo Tingyi**
*Composed by Du Guangting, Grand Virtue of the Imperial Academy, Purple-Robed by Imperial Favor, of the Great Pure Palace in the Upper Capital*

We humbly acknowledge that the Three Officials keep the registers, the Five Emperors determine life. The Southern Heaven records the tally of blessings, while the Northern Dipper governs the red threads of fate. As for the true courts of the sacred mountains and rivers, the bureaus of one’s life-palace—these preside over retribution without error, examine and weigh the bonds of life and death.

Your servant fears that, having been unworthily entrusted with governance, he has failed to harmonize the realm. The scales of justice may have erred in severity or leniency; the transformative power of instruction may not yet have perfected virtue and righteousness. Thus, faults and transgressions have been inscribed in the numinous archives. Without offering rites of supplication and gratitude, we dread the onset of calamitous omens.

Moreover, we fear that celestial signs and stellar influences may have aligned in ill-omened conjunction, or that the year of one’s life-palace may have encountered obstruction. The Celestial Talisman and Five Demons occupy the positions of Kun and Gen, residing in the hour of one’s natal destiny. With the first month opposing the year’s pivot, we are especially wary of decline and adversity. Therefore, on this day of primordial fate, we dare to approach the sacred mountain with reverence, to prepare the altar and unfold our sincere plea.

We pray that the heavenly bureaus may absolve our transgressions, that the earthly records may dispel our disasters. May misfortune vanish in secret, and blessings gather in radiance. May our years and blessings be prolonged, and our fortune perpetually secured. May the realm know peace, the people health and prosperity. May the grain flourish, drought and flood be averted. May no pestilence harm the people, and may customs attain the beauty of harmony.

**Prayer for the Life-Renewal Rite of Mo Tingyi**

We have heard that the Great Dao gives rise to all things, that primordial harmony sets the tally in motion. It shapes the forms of creatures, spreads transformation among the multitudes. It extends the work of the Supreme Dark Lord above, and suspends below the warnings of fortune and misfortune for the earthly realm. Thus, the punishment of evil and encouragement of good stand as unchanging maxims. Harm befalls the full, blessing the humble—this is the constant teaching.

Your servant has long heard the mysterious decree and dares not fail to reflect inwardly, to examine his conduct with trepidation. Though I have thought of the Dao, I remain entangled in worldly dust, holding office yet unworthy of its emoluments. Wielding the brush to define laws for the court, or overseeing the levies of the realm with the rod of punishment—my works may have stirred earth and timber, while my table has not yet forsaken roasted delicacies. The weight of my errors remains unknown, their gravity unmeasured. Thus, anxiety and fear have taken root, lest my faults accumulate and invite reproach.

Moreover, this year the Celestial Talisman has aligned with the hour of my natal destiny, while Venus lingers in a position of sorrow and stagnation. I fear my aspirations may falter with misfortune, lingering amid the allure of fame and desire; my heart may drift with calamity, drowning in the depths of wine and song. Thus, I resolve to vigilance and repentance. On this day of destiny, I dare to perform the rites of burning incense and devotion with utmost sincerity. I purify my heart in the numinous cavern, return my pledge to the sacred mountain. Gazing upon the Dipper and the constellations, I pray to efface past faults; beholding the phoenix canopy and dragon banner, I beseech the bestowal of new grace.

May my offenses be smoothed away, my grievances dissolved, disasters quelled, and blessings prolonged. May kin separated by distance rejoice in health, and the people of the realm prosper in abundance. May the blades of war be forever sheathed, pestilence unvisited, drought and flood restrained, and agriculture and sericulture flourish. May the dragon spirits remain at peace in their abodes, and all, near and far, be suffused with felicity. With a heart of red sincerity, I pledge to fulfill the mysterious design above.

**Prayer for the Southern Dipper Rite for Duke Jin**

We humbly acknowledge that the Scarlet Mansion guards its precincts, the Southern Palace of Longevity presides over the direction of pure yang, enacting the transformative power of the Great Dao that gives life to all things. Whatever we pray for, it surely bestows.

Your servant, though foolish and unworthy, has been favored by this sacred day, honored with proximity to the imperial inner court, and blessed with boundless grace. Yet I constantly fear my mediocrity cannot bear such kindness. I dread that the adversities of my year, the baleful influences of stellar conjunctions, may bring trials of punishment and restraint, or obstructions in my path. My apprehension grows, and I dare not rest at ease.

Thus, I offer my red sincerity and reverently perform the rites of supplication. I especially beseech your compassionate protection and the descent of your numinous radiance. May past transgressions be erased, future disasters averted. May the red tablets of the Southern Pole be extended, my years increased; may the black records of the Northern Capital be expunged, my blessings renewed. Grant me deliverance, that I may forever bear your divine grace.

**Jin Gong’s Supplication to the Earth Deity**

I humbly acknowledge that Heaven and Earth, in their vast embrace, bear all things and cover all beings. They give life to the myriad creatures and nurture the host of spirits. The virtue of the Earth, mother of all, shines upon the ten thousand existences. From rulers and ministers, fathers and sons, down to the moving and still, the flying and the hidden—wherever there is sincere prayer, it must be reverently declared.

Within my domain, warfare has repeatedly arisen. Its harm has reached the hills and graves, its slaughter spared neither infants nor the aged. Far and near lie in ashes, neither men nor spirits know peace. The suffering of this land pierces to the bone and marrow. Thinking of these countless people, my prayers are earnest and fervent. With blood poured forth and heart laid bare, I look up in hope of your compassion and protection.

I implore you to bend in mercy and heed my devout supplication, to lend your numinous power. Command the spirits of mountains, rivers, and peaks to aid in quelling calamities; instruct the officers of thunder, lightning, wind, and clouds to still the fields and plains. Fling wide the gates of the sword, that the path to the celestial court may remain unobstructed. Illuminate and revive the weary people, cleanse deep-seated grievances.

Let it not be as in Xiang Ji’s shrine, which could only dispel Shu’s troubles; nor let Jiang Mountain’s temple alone aid the Jin forces. With goblet raised and words spoken, my tears flow unchecked.

---

**Jin Gong’s Supplication to the Northern Emperor**

I humbly acknowledge that the Five Planets traverse the heavens, and the Three Origins govern the flow of qi. Above, they revere the Dipper and the Pole; below, they order human affairs. Yin and yang have their cycles of prosperity and decline, while the celestial bodies follow their appointed courses of influence.

I fear that within the span of fate and the palace of the stars, encounters with harmful conjunctions may bring obstruction and misfortune. Thus, on this auspicious day, I reverently prepare the altar of supplication, knocking upon the threshold of your sacred power, and especially beseech your compassion and protection.

May the trials of the Three Destinies and Nine Palaces be wholly dispelled; may the disasters of bright stars and dark omens be entirely stilled. May the land know peace, the people harmony. May armor be laid aside, weapons stilled, the years abundant, and customs prosperous. Forever I offer my sincere devotion, to repay your mysterious grace.

**Invocation to the Star of Venus and the Wolf Star**

It is heard that the celestial bodies of the highest mysteries each possess their sovereign governance. Some preside over the mustering of armies, others over the origins of baleful vapors. Gazing upward at their radiant splendor, the fortunes of all are bound to their sway.

Within my borders, weapons have clashed for years beyond count. Fields lie abandoned, silkworms neglected; the people suffer in ashes and blood. This grievous oppression weighs upon me, piercing to the very core.

Thus, I prostrate myself, kindling incense, and direct my heart in prayer for blessings. May my fervent plea move you to bestow your luminous gaze. I humbly beseech that the stern might of the Metal phase’s autumnal severity be tempered by the great power of righteous judgment. Aid these martial forces to purge the outskirts and capital. Deliver the land from the peril of drowning, rescue the people from their inverted plight. May bows be sheathed and weapons stilled, rains fall in season, winds blow in harmony. May the hundred grains yield their harvest, and the five weapons know eternal rest.

---

**Invocation to the Great Emperor of the Northern Dipper**

I reflect that the Dipper governs the center of heaven, its reach extending to the eight directions. Where the Pointer star directs, right and wrong are swiftly distinguished.

Now, as the season arrives at the *Zhengyuan* and the time of reckoning is at hand, may all things be graced with the blessings of renewal; may the ten thousand regions receive the nurturing warmth of your transformative power.

**Reflection on the Frontier’s Plight**

This borderland remains ensnared in war, its people mired in suffering, its fields overgrown with brambles. The season for sowing and planting is upon us, yet the common folk are barred from their plows and mulberries. In this anguish, my prayers redouble.

I beseech the Northern Pole’s celestial palace, the Seven Primes’ register of fate: turn from the people’s hollowed gaze, reverse this land’s ruin. Let peace be witnessed, let blades be forever sheathed. If I, your servant, have met with misfortune or offended the stars through fault, I willingly submit to just retribution to atone before all beings.

---

**Petition to the Northern Emperor**

I have heard that heaven and earth sustain all things, yet yin and yang know cycles of growth and decay; sun and moon illumine the world, yet cold and heat follow their ordained succession. Fortune and misfortune turn with fate, prosperity and adversity alternate. Though the course of time brings calamity—floods in Yao’s reign, drought in Tang’s—yet rites of expiation hold their power, as seen in the winds that turned back, the foes that retreated.

Now this land faces its hour of trial. The people remain unsettled, war follows war. Consulting the star-charts, we find Mars ascendant. Thus I turn my heart to the Great Dao, reverently imploring the Supreme Mystery. I open the altar of the Great Unity, perform the rites of the Three and Five. Treading the crimson whirlwind, I plead for blessings; pacing the dark Dipper, I pray to heaven.

May the arrayed fires blaze forth in might, their stellar radiance answering in the celestial realm; may the sun’s light scatter its flames, purging yin’s filth from the earth below. I pray for the sacred person’s grace, for the vast protection of the rivers and lands of Shu. May the people ascend to fortune and longevity, may the fields know rest from spear and blade. Together, let us bathe in the divine power, forever dispelling care and calamity.

Your Majesty,

I have heard that the Dipper and Pole Star hold the highest seat, overseeing the eight directions. They command the myriad forms and govern all spirits. Wherever the Dipper’s handle points, calamity and misfortune naturally cease. Yet now, within our borders, war still rages. The people have not laid down their burdens, and the times tremble with fear. Though we labor in defense, fields lie fallow and silkworms neglected. Gazing upon these overgrown wastes, my sorrow deepens. Thus I dare to offer this libation, renewing my earnest plea.

I humbly beseech the Grand Steward to display his might, the Seven Primes to enforce their decrees. May the chariots of thunder and steeds of lightning sweep the four quarters; may the winnowing winds and timely rains nurture all things. Let our lands be purified, and all living beings sheltered. If my own fate harbors disaster, if yin and yang conspire to bring misfortune, I beg to bear heaven’s punishment, that the people’s suffering may end. With utmost sincerity, I await your luminous judgment.

*Memorial of the Lord of Shu to the Northern Emperor*

I have learned that the celestial signs manifest their power, and the Northern Pole holds the highest station. It oversees all existence and illumines all beings. Its eighty-one transformations command awe; its thirty-six divine warriors embody martial prowess. It purifies creation, scrutinizing both hidden and manifest. It eradicates evil, punishes wrongdoing, and safeguards the people and the state.

Now, as the Vermilion Yang reaches its season and the Red Emperor governs the quarter, the southern winds bestow their nurturing grace, and the four seasons harmonize in clarity. The silkworms near their labor’s end, the fields demand toil—yet pestilence spreads unchecked, drums of war still sound. The people perish in droves, the countryside languishes in flight. With no ground to stand, how can they rest their shoulders? Entrusted with the defense of this land, my sorrow cuts deep. On this occasion of the temple rites, I renew my plea with utmost sincerity.

I humbly pray that the divine warriors lend their strength, dispelling miasmic vapors from the capital’s outskirts; that the cloud-borne cavalry surge forth, sweeping disease from every village. May the people know peace, near and far live without fear. Let the murky mists dissolve forever, revealing the hues of Shu’s mountains and rivers; let the drifting clouds vanish, unveiling the light of sun and moon across the nine heavens. May misfortune be smoothed away, calamity stilled.

Ever devoted, I offer this pure sincerity to match your boundless grace.

*Memorial of the Duke of Jin to the Northern Emperor*

I observe that the six qi circulate in ceaseless flow, for the Dao of heaven is the root of all creation; the seven stars of the Dipper set the measure, for the Lord of the Dipper is the source of all governance. Sin and blessing, fortune and misfortune—all are recorded and weighed.

Yet now, the lands near the capital remain unsettled, weapons still clash. The countryside knows no peace, and pestilence spreads. Mindful of this suffering, my heart aches as if pierced. Thus, on this occasion of the temple rites, I dare to voice my plea once more.

I humbly pray that your sacred power turn in mercy, that your divine might lend aid. Bestow your radiant favor upon the people, still the perils that beset the three regions of Shu. Let weapons be laid down, the times know peace, and the people rest secure. May misfortune be smoothed away, and fortune and blessings converge.

With deepest reverence.

**Thanksgiving for the Northern Dipper Rite**
I, your humble servant, am but a fool, undeservingly clad in official robes. My cultivation has been sorely lacking, my faults and transgressions ever mounting. Punishment has befallen me, and illness has taken hold. My frail form nearly perished, my faint breath barely preserved. The Three Caverns Master Du Hongguang, moved by kinship and grieved by my perilous condition, earnestly unfolded his sincere plea and silently implored the celestial truth. By your grace, extraordinary blessings descended, extending my allotted years. I lift my gaze to the protection of the divine spirits, once more beholding the light of sun and moon. Though my strength is as feeble as an ant’s, the kindness of heaven and earth is boundless. Thus, I offer this rite and libation, looking up to repay the gift of life. I humbly pray that your sacred mercy deign to accept and witness this. Unworthy as I am...

**Rite for the Five Planets**
I reflect that the Three Luminaries shed their radiance, the Five Wefts stream their brilliance. Waxing and waning follow their constant course, while past and present know no fixed pattern. In their revolving ranks, they govern all living things. Their influence remains unerring, their auspices and omens inextricably linked. I, though unworthy, have been entrusted with office and entrusted with lands. Yet my benevolence has not reached all beings, and my domain remains entangled in calamity and pestilence. Weapons rage with violence, people flee in displacement. A thousand *li* lie wounded, a single region poisoned by ruin. This sorrow and pain pierce my heart and liver. I recall that the supreme sages cherish life, and the perfected truths nurture all things. Thus, I dare to rely on your compassionate warmth and once more devote myself to this rite of supplication. I humbly pray that Venus display its might, aiding martial prowess on the plains; that Jupiter unfurl its splendor, spreading benevolent grace to the outskirts. May the Five Celestial Bodies follow their paths and manifest blessings, and may all things receive their protection and favor. Let the wilds know no sorrowful laments, and customs be steeped in harmony and peace. I vow to exhaust my sincerest devotion, looking up to requite your divine favor. Unworthy as I am...

**Northern Dipper Rite for One’s Natal Destiny**
I have heard that when the Dipper stands at the center of heaven, its handle extends to the eight directions. Where the pivot of the *Kui* points, fortune and blessings surely arrive. Now, in the midst of my fate’s course, earth occupies my natal position. Within the cycle of the *You* year, misfortune looms in the southern quarter. At this time, as the Dipper resides in the southern sky and the sun traverses my natal constellation, I humbly present this rite of supplication, hoping to attain resonance with the divine. May you wield your governing might to still the dark and obscure forces of my destiny. Grant me your profound protection, and I shall never betray your luminous grace. Unworthy as I am...

**Southern Dipper Rite for One’s Natal Destiny**
I have heard that the Six Palaces of the Southern Dipper are the abode of the host of sagely beings of Wen Chang. The span of life is bound to them, and the register of birth is under their charge. From the tiniest creatures to the hidden and subtle, all depend on their sovereign rule. Those who pray for life and seek blessings must bare their sincerity. I, undeservingly favored by your grace, have been entrusted with governing a frontier region. My merits are as dust, my faults as mountains. Yet now, in the midst of my fate’s course, I face obstruction and adversity. Within the celestial patterns, inauspicious influences converge. Thus, I dare to approach the altar of memorials, renewing my hopes in prayer. I humbly pray that the sagely beings of the Vermilion Palace and the exalted ones of the Cinnabar Terrace turn their compassion toward averting misfortune and calamity, opening the path from death to life. Let the weapons of this land be laid down and silenced, and the four seasons bring timely rains and gentle winds. Rescue the souls of the plague-stricken from the depths of the underworld, and deliver the wandering spirits from eternal night. Bestow the blessings of primordial harmony, and succor the realms of darkness and desolation. Let no floating clouds obscure the azure sky, and may my loyal sincerity be made manifest in the light of day. My deepest aspirations look up to your vast blessings. Unworthy as I am...

**Rite to the Three Honored Ones for One’s Natal Destiny**
I have heard that the great Dao shines brightly, uniquely manifesting the transformation of cherishing life; the celestial perfected ones, in their mercy and kindness, singularly extend their benevolence to save all things. Their nurturing is impartial, their governance without flaw. I, in my mediocrity, have undeservingly received your favor and honor. Though I have not rendered meritorious service, I have been deeply steeped in your abundant grace. Yet, like the snipe and the clam locked in struggle, or the sandpiper and the mussel bringing disaster, my meager virtue has invited misfortune, and adversity has gathered around me. Within the three destinies, there may be clashes and conflicts; among the nine luminaries, inauspicious influences still loom. Thus, on the occasion of my natal destiny, I reverently implore the supreme mystery. I humbly pray that you turn aside this cycle of misfortune and bestow your auspicious blessings. Pardon my past transgressions, and dissolve the calamities yet to come. Let my loyal and sincere heart be poured out, answering the grace of heaven and earth. I vow to steel myself and uphold your divine compassion. Unworthy as I am...

**Rite to the Twenty-Eight Constellations of the Celestial Circuit**
I have heard that the celestial patterns hang in the heavens, illuminating all things. From the moving to the still, all receive the impartial virtue of the Dao; from the hidden to the manifest, all partake in the effortless workings of the ungoverning. I, though undeservingly bathed in your favor, have been entrusted with the defense of the frontier. Truly ashamed of my meager virtue, I have nonetheless encountered profound calamity. Cities and towns lie in ruins, the people perish in droves. This sorrow and pain compel me to redouble my sincere prayers. I humbly pray that you grant your divine favor, bringing peace to the afflicted and weary. Let the banners of war be forever furled, and no sound of grievance be heard; let the harvests be bountiful, and the realm steeped in the harmony of peace. As for the disasters and inauspicious periods within the mountains and rivers, and the celestial misfortunes within the paths of the stars, may they all be dissolved and dispelled, that I may attain security and well-being. I vow to exhaust my sincerest devotion, looking up to fulfill your vast grace. Unworthy as I am...

Memorial of Ritual Classics Erudite Su Shaoyuan for the Nine Luminaries Jiao Rite

I, though base and insignificant, have fortuitously encountered this sagely age. I have received the grace of the Three Realms’ illumination and the favor of the Two Modes’ nurturing power. Yet I ever fear that my steps tread in benighted paths, my person entangled in the snares of the vulgar. My cultivation remains deficient, and my transgressions readily accumulate. Though I bear the secret scriptures and reverently partake in the sacred registers, my incense and lamps grow slack, and impurities encroach. The Dao’s qi fails to descend upon the hundred passages, and the numinous officials silently withdraw from the six palaces. Thus do pernicious influences gather within, and ailments coil about me. Day and night I tremble with anxiety, dreading that I may not be preserved whole.

Moreover, I fear that the Five Phases and Three Destinies have met with baleful decline. Saturn and Jupiter, too, now lodge in the Palace Mansion. Considering my humble self, long devoid of meritorious deeds, I am all the more alarmed at this time of calamity. Therefore, I dare to unseal the ancient canons of the River Chart and open the jiao altar, invoking the sacred texts of the Numinous Treasure to beseech the celestial portents.

I humbly pray that your profound compassion may deign to look upon me, that your divine blessings may distantly moisten me. Wash away my faults and transgressions, dissolve and dispel my misfortunes. Let the radiant stars conceal their baleful light, and together bestow auspicious omens. May the Eight Trigrams and Nine Palaces alike avert penal adversities. Let illnesses be healed, and pestilential influences purged. May my emoluments and rank be renewed, and my years extended in perpetuity. May the spirit-generals of my advancing years, the officers of the dharma registers, and the divine soldiers suspend their punishments, exalt my merits, and grant me manifest protection.

I vow ever to cultivate and strive, that I may repay this profound grace. I am unworthy...

**Prayer for the River Lord’s Celestial Net and Earthly Web Ritual**

I have heard that the primal *qi* gave rise to the embryo, and the Three Spirits initiated all beginnings. The odd of Qian and the even of Kun determined yin and yang. Metal, leather, and earth floated, revealing their celestial lodges. The nine arose from Kan, Xu, and Hai, called the Celestial Net; the six emerged from Li, Chen, and Si, called the Earthly Web. These are the realms where the two bodies ascend and descend, the domain where the Two Modes alternate. Yang lies hidden and cannot prevail; yin is severed and cannot endure. The years one traverses mark the very days of calamity.

Moreover, the harmony of heaven and earth nurtures all things, shaping forms and endowing essences, sending forth marvels to command the age. Yet all return to the authority of forging and casting, and none can escape the reckoning of rise and decline. I, a humble and benighted servant, dare not shun this dark obscurity. In the *bingchen* year, the baleful conjunction looms; in the *dingsi* year, the disaster’s term nears its end. Within these two years, I bear a hundred sorrows. I raise my prayers to the mysterious heavens, humbly beseeching dissolution.

May Your Sagely Insight deign to regard my sincere entreaty, manifest Your majestic power, and greatly dispel misfortune. Let the warp of Qian and the weft of Kun quiet inauspicious vapors in every region; let the Earthly Web and Celestial Net release the baleful terms of the lesser cycles. Let songs rise and clods be struck, restoring the plain and unadorned customs of the sagely court; let armor be bound and bows sheathed, fulfilling the subtle teachings of the Mysterious Ancestor. I shall ever tend the incense fire to repay Your profound compassion. I am unworthy…

**Prayer to the Nine Luminaries for the River Lord**

I, Your servant, have undeservedly received the state’s grace and been entrusted with military command. The lands of the southwest—mighty Shu and the wilds of Mao—lie under my charge. Three lodges align with the paths of Shen and Jing; eight states control the domains of the Qiang and Man. My jurisdiction is vast, and governance is arduous. I constantly fear my inadequacy, unworthy of this singular trust. Day and night, I am filled with dread and dare not rest at ease.

In recent years, disasters have not ceased: illnesses and pestilence arise in season, and warfare erupts daily. Now, consulting the *Yellow Plan* and examining the mysterious calendar, I find that within my allotted region, Venus is about to descend. Moreover, as I plan campaigns and marshal troops, I rely on the principle of punishing wrongdoing and wield the might of stern justice. I await the stilling of the four frontiers to bring peace to the myriad people.

I humbly pray that the celestial light may look down, and sagely power may secretly aid me. May Your abundant grace moisten the ninefold heavens, and Your salvation reach the perilous from a thousand *li* away. Let bows be unstrung and armor laid aside; let wells be dug and fields tilled. May no household in village or hamlet suffer from pestilence, and may distant and near alike rejoice in harmonious customs. Where the Long-Lived Star points, may all obstructions dissolve.

I shall forever bear the grace of manifest protection. I am unworthy…

**Yang Ding’s Prayer for the Life-Destiny Ritual**

I reflect that the Dipper governs the center of heaven, its handle shifting through the stellar ranks. The Celestial Emperor’s chariot moves alone; the floating canopy of the parasol looms high. It judges good and ill, examining and weighing transgressions and blessings. Though the dust of the mortal realm is distant, and I gaze at the starry dials without means to ascend, the celestial hearing is most keen—where there is sincere devotion, it surely perceives. The red sincerity I knock upon shall surely evoke a mysterious response.

I, Your servant, have lately been afflicted by misfortune, encountering hardship and obstruction. Roads are blocked, and kin are scattered. My youngest son and I have been sundered in two places, lost in panic, with no word reaching one another. By day, I pray to the boundless heavens; by night, I gaze upon the Northern Dipper. Hoping for communion, I long for reunion. Burning incense, tears of blood fall together; prostrating, my heart and soul are wholly given.

By Your manifest protection, I swiftly achieved return. I constantly cherish the grace of rebirth, yet have not repaid the bounty from heaven. I pass my days in trepidation, as if thorns pierced my flesh. Now, as the Jade Bureau’s immortal abode and the numinous transformations of Brocade Metropolis appear—below concealing grotto palaces, above linked to the stellar paths—communication with the divine may be expected, and the true spirits shall assemble.

I venture into this sacred realm, wishing to present my ritual prayers. I seek to repay the kindness of blessings and protection, and modestly express my reverent devotion. I await the turning of the true gaze to condescend to my mortal heart.

My youngest son was born under the sign of *renzi*; I, Your humble servant, was destined by *gengshen*. I ever hope for sagely power to eternally grant protection, dispelling the calamities of the Five Phases and Three Destinies, and dissolving the baleful terms of the celestial degrees. May I diligently cultivate and strive, and uphold the radiant and luminous.

Though millet and grain are not fragrant, the true immortals shall perceive. I am unworthy…

**Memorial for the Southern Dipper Ritual Offered by Duke Ling of Shu**

*[Note: #1 Originally written as "长," an error; emended to "辰" according to the context.]*
Composed by Du Guangting, Grand Virtue of the Inner Palace, Bestowed with the Purple Robe, by Imperial Commission

I have heard that heaven covers and earth bears all, relying on the Great Dao for generation and completion; that all beings receive their essence and nurture their spirits, subtly moved by the Most True. Thus do they achieve boundless governance and endless transformation. The True Sovereign presides, and the Mysterious Power commands. Though the Great Void stretches vast and kalpas span distant ages, the myriad beings clamor in tumult, the Nine Gates lie open and desolate. Penal laws and governance grow intricate, the divisions of the land profound. Disaster and fortune are overseen, peace and peril are bound to them.

I, your servant, have encountered the sagely mandate and, though unworthy, been honored with grace. Entrusted with the banner and tassel, charged with the duties of a minister. The land is mighty in Ba and Shu, the borders hold the Qiang and Man. Ashamed of my inability to soothe and pacify, I am ever filled with trepidation and earnest concern. Moreover, to reward the good and punish the wicked requires the use of rewards and penalties; to suppress rebellion and execute the violent demands the wielding of axes and cudgels. Sacrifices to the gods require the preparation of animals, while tax collection and corvée labor bring hardship. To govern is to do what cannot be avoided. Yet I truly fear that my judgment of talent may be amiss, my appointments ill-suited, giving rise to resentment and complaint, and thus bringing about calamity.

Now, moreover, Saturn traverses its degrees, casting its gaze upon this region. As Earth once shifted its palace, it will soon depart from Yibu. The Five Demons approach the *Kun* position, Mars treads the *Sheng* palace. Furthermore, my great fate lies in the realm of clash and rupture, my lesser fate in the year of the tomb of life. Wood is already weak, fire likewise in decline. The Celestial Talisman descends upon my active years, and in my wanderings I encounter the year of life’s end. Earth faces this region directly, and also resides in the palace of the wife. Metal and fire move in concealment, dwelling in stagnant positions. Jupiter lingers in a constellation of sorrow, while dark stars emerge in discordant directions. The celestial signs are most clear, the numbers of yin and yang fixed. How could I not be vigilant, striving to cultivate and refine myself?

Yet I fear that faults may easily deepen, transgressions accumulate, and through my errors, disaster may befall the living. Reflecting upon myself and consoling my heart, I find no rest. I have heard that in the month of the True Yang, on the day of *bingwu*, the Six Stars descend to observe, and the Southern Dipper convenes to determine life. This is the time to cleanse faults and receive blessings, to pardon sins and extend grace. Accordingly, I follow the luminous statutes and humbly offer my thanks. I approach the True Palace of the Mysterious Origin and the Sacred Altar of the Jade Bureau, meticulously preparing the tokens of sincerity, solemnly revering the incense and flame. I invoke the realms of the sun, moon, and stars, the offices of mountains, rivers, seas, and peaks. With wholehearted devotion, I conduct the grand ritual.

I humbly beseech the turning of the impartial gaze, the descent of the unfathomable spirits. From the Southern Palace, look upon this mortal realm. Together, bestow true favor and condescend to perceive my humble sincerity. Dissolve the celestial portents of disaster in this region, dispel the baleful manifestations of the heavens. Quell the calamities of the Three Destinies and Five Phases, remove the misfortunes of the Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams. Still the afflictions of the land where Saturn casts its gaze, that I may receive auspicious blessings; avert the ominous fate of Earth’s shifting course, that I may be granted felicitous signs.

May the common people all be preserved in peace and prosperity, the grain and crops assured of abundance. May the encampments know security, the four borders be free of peril. May pestilence not encroach, weapons be sheathed and stilled. Above, may the Three Luminaries display their auspices, following the Yellow Way to bring fortune; may the Emperor’s person and the Five Planets proceed in harmony, supporting the Purple Tenuity in its embrace. May the Mysterious Ultimate and the Dragon Chart endure, the Phoenix Calendar flourish evermore.

May the dragon spirits of the land, the shrines of mountains and rivers, all extend their blessings. May they succor both the seen and unseen, reaching the dark passes of the underworld, the wandering souls and suffering spirits, the fluttering and flying, the creatures of water and land—all may they receive the grace of deliverance and protection, forever enjoying peace and blessings.

*Memorial for the Southern Dipper Ritual of the Lord of Shu*

We humbly observe that the stellar path of Shu aligns above with the Quail’s Head constellation, while its terrestrial division below adjoins the Kun quadrant. Positioned in the direction of *shen* and *wei*, it resides within the degrees of *Shen* and *Jing*. Now, as Saturn stands in opposition and Metal and Fire converge in their stations, the Five Ghosts temporarily lodge in the Second Palace, while the Earthly Unity General shifts toward the Yi region. We fear that governance may stray from compassionate nurture, laws may falter in merciful restraint, the wilds may echo with resentful sighs, and the people may suffer calamities and afflictions. Moreover, within this year’s progression and the span of this life, as punishment and conflict coincide with decline and weakness, we dread the onset of misfortune and adversity.

Daring to choose this propitious month of the True Yang, this auspicious *bing-wu* day, we reverently prepare this ritual offering to present our repentance and purification. We humbly beseech that great mercy be extended, that our earnest devotion be regarded with favor. May the inauspicious omens of celestial patterns and terrestrial divisions be dissolved, and the faults of the Three Lives and Five Phases be dispelled. May auspicious blessings be graciously bestowed, and lasting peace and security be granted. We vow to devote our hearts to governance, in repayment of the grace of cherishing life.

We cannot fully express our reverence.

*Memorial for the Zhou Heavenly Circuit Ritual of the Lord of Shu*

We prostrate ourselves before the Heavenly August Emperor, who oversees and inspects all directions, and before the Great Unity and the Ten Spirits, who traverse the Eight Extremities. They bestow disasters or blessings, omitting neither great nor small. How dare we, as ruler and ministers, forget their luminous admonitions? Now, as the Earthly Unity’s position shifts and is about to depart from the land of Shu, we deeply fear that amidst the administration of punishments and policies, there may inevitably be errors and transgressions. Filled with trepidation, we hasten to offer repentance and supplication. Reverently performing the rites of incense and flame, we express our earnest devotion.

We humbly pray that our sincerity be acknowledged and auspicious blessings be conferred. May the realm enjoy peace and tranquility, and the people revive in prosperity. May the seasons be harmonious and the years abundant, with weapons sheathed and bows laid aside. We shall renew our gratitude for the mercy bestowed and never betray the gifts of your oversight.

*Preface to the Zhou Heavenly Circuit Ritual by Attendant Censor Zhou*

We prostrate ourselves before the Dao’s qi in its ceaseless motion, nurturing and harmonizing all things. It divides the myriad spirits to spread transformation and suspends the constellations to adorn the heavens. All beings that possess spirit receive its mandate. It further appoints overseers to determine fortune and misfortune.

I, though unworthy and undeserving, have presumptuously received profound favor. Entrusted with the governance of a frontier region, I have yet to devise a strategy for victory; appointed to administer a province, my achievements in pacification and reassurance have been meager. Moreover, this land borders barbarian settlements and controls the passes of Ba, where my limited talents constantly fear oversight, and the diverse customs prove difficult to soothe and instruct. Only through vigilance and caution have I managed to preserve my position from beginning to end. Having furled the hawk banners, I now rely on the military encampment. Reflecting on the depth of the honors bestowed, how can I find peace in self-examination?

My anxieties run deep, and illness has taken hold. I often contemplate the origins of accumulated existence, extending to this present life. The Three Karmas have woven transgressions, and the Six Emotions have entangled conflicts. Past grievances remain unresolved, and old debts still bind me. Perhaps in the course of governance, rewards and punishments have been misapplied; in matters of life and death, errors may have been unavoidable. Or perhaps within the celestial patterns and degrees of the constellations, there have been encounters with inauspicious alignments. Or within the Five Phases of the Three Lives, there have been clashes and conflicts.

This year, the Five Ghosts reside in the Palace of the Wife, and the Heavenly Talisman enters the Position of Wealth. In the minor progression, the *bing* fortune is entombed, while in the major progression, the Water of *zi* approaches decline. Metal and Fire move through the Palace of the Body, and the Net Star afflicts the Post Horse. All these portend adversity, redoubling my apprehension and doubt. Thus, in times of illness and suffering, I have silently prayed and vowed, hoping for resolution and repayment.

Now, as the myriad sages extend their compassion and the host of perfected beings show their mercy, they deliver me from affliction and grant me healing. Gazing upon the workings of the Mysterious Creation, I know where to turn; moved by the vast grace bestowed, I seek to repay it. Unfurling the true patterns of the River Chart, I approach the numinous altar of the Jade Bureau. Preparing rites of purification and reverence, I establish the Great Circuit of the Zhou Heavenly Ritual. To the stars, the sun, and the moon, I offer my utmost sincerity; to the Earthly Prisons and Heavenly Passes, I extend my declarations of gratitude and repentance.

We humbly pray that our earnest pleas be witnessed and our pure sincerity be accepted. May auspicious blessings be eternally bestowed, and aid and protection be granted. May transgressions and faults be eradicated, and the span of life be prolonged. May grievances and debts be resolved, and calamities and misfortunes be transcended. We vow to diligently cultivate and serve, in accord with the Mysterious Compassion.

We cannot fully express our reverence.

**Wang Zongpu’s Prayer for the Six Jia Ritual**

We humbly acknowledge that the Great Dao congeals in radiance, while the Primordial Venerable unfolds transformation. From the inception of unified qi, the five agents take their places. In ceaseless cycles of beginning and end, the myriad beings are born and completed. Above, the kalpas turn through the revolutions of time; below, human relations are shaped by fortune and misfortune. All who receive form and nurture essence depend on the mysterious workings of the Dao.

Your servant has long revered purity and emptiness, aspiring to draw near the serene and formless. Having been granted access to the secret registers, I have ever hoped to follow and cultivate them. Recently, while on a mission to the capital, I traversed perilous and distant roads. Fearing neglect in my duties, I silently offered prayers. By the hidden aid of the Dao’s power, I was secretly shielded with extraordinary blessings. Arriving in the Qin lands, I met with unblemished fortune; returning to the Shu city, I bore no trace of failure or harm. Gazing upward in gratitude for this numinous grace, I earnestly desire to repay it.

Now, as the esteemed festival of the Double Ninth coincides with the auspicious day of *jiazi*, I humbly prepare my modest sincerity and reverently present this ritual offering. May the divine majesty deign to look upon me, fulfilling my humble wishes. Accept my crimson devotion and proclaim your vast blessings. Let transgressions be swept away, grievances resolved, disasters dispelled, and good fortune assembled. In serving my parents and the state, may I ever receive compassionate protection; in upholding my duties and advancing in rank, may I forever bear the gifts of the true spirits.

**Meng Yanhui’s Prayer for the Northern and Southern Dipper Ritual**

We humbly recall that the Great Dao nurtures the numinous, while the Heavenly Venerable expounds transformation, seizing the moment to manifest auspicious signs and send forth sages to the world. Thus do they rectify the state and succor the age, proclaiming merit and benefiting all beings. Endowed with the pure qi of the stars and constellations, they gather the essence of mountains and rivers. All receive their mandate from Heaven and concentrate their spirits upon the earth, expanding their capacities to the utmost to aid living beings.

Your servant, as Military Commissioner and Prince of Langye, was born under a propitious star and has repeatedly received the sagely favor. With martial might, I have upheld the Tang dynasty; with loyal devotion, I have assisted the sagely enterprise, illuminating the restoration and securing the throne. Tribute has ever filled the imperial treasury, and my integrity has led the feudatories. Given these meritorious labors, I should rightfully receive divine favor.

Now, on this auspicious day of my birth, I prepare offerings of sincerity and reverently perform the ritual. Following the *Taiyi* method of invoking the true, I approach the altar where the Perfected Ones pay homage to the Dipper. Incense drifts through the empty courtyard; lamps glow in the still night. With heart poured forth, I present this petition, hoping for a response. Universally, I contemplate the celestial patterns in silent reflection, offering prayers to all true spirits.

We humbly pray that the stars traverse their celestial paths, that earthly and heavenly offices witness our devotion, that the host of sages turn their radiance toward us, and that the myriad spirits look upon us with favor. Bestow auspicious omens and extend great blessings, opening the realm of longevity and magnifying illustrious merit. May I forever assist the sagely court and uphold the imperial throne. May dragon spirits lend their aid, and the riverine lands know peace. May the hundred grains flourish, and the five weapons be sheathed. May customs be harmonious and the years free from calamity. May all beings, seen and unseen, together attain the transformation of the Dao.

**Prayer for the Nine Luminaries Offering by Minister of Works Zong Ke**

We humbly acknowledge that the Great Dao extends its compassion, while the myriad spirits fulfill their offices. Yin and yang unfold transformation, and the stellar patterns reveal their signs. They illumine the hidden and manifest, shaping all things in their ranks. Governance follows measure, and retribution for sin or blessing knows no error.

I, though base and insignificant, have been sheltered beneath the vast canopy of grace. Undeservingly, I have long enjoyed favor and rank, early granted honors and emoluments. For years, I have led troops and disciples, and still hold the insignia of office. Yet I fear my talents are slight for so weighty a charge, and that fortune may turn to misfortune. Day and night, I tremble with anxiety, daring not rest in ease.

Moreover, this year’s celestial motion has brought the heavenly tally into the central palace, while the direction of royal charge again aligns with the great cycle. The post horse star is opposed by the Five Ghosts. The minor cycle clashes with the major, and both my birth month and natal hour are afflicted. As Saturn traverses its course, illness and calamity have arisen, and I have yet to recover.

Examining myself and reflecting on my heart, I am filled with dread. I have heard that the celestial bureaus and exalted sages record life and death, while the Northern Dipper and Southern Palace govern the clarity of sin and blessing. Thus, I dare lay bare my heart in earnest supplication, prostrating in prayer to seek grace. With reverence, I approach the sacred altar and present my offering with utmost devotion. Though my gifts are meager, my sincerity is fervent.

We implore the myriad sages and honored spirits to open their grace and grant protection. Pardon my sins accumulated over past lives, and dissolve the misfortunes of my three destinies. Strike my name from the Dipper’s death register, and inscribe it in the Southern Palace’s ledger of life. Dispel the convergence of calamities, and reconcile the bonds of grievance. Banish illness and suffering, and extend my allotted span of fortune. I vow to cultivate diligence in repayment of this profound grace.

**Prayer for the Natal Offering by Zong Kui of the Ministry’s Bureau**

We humbly acknowledge that the Great Dao gives birth and completes, while yin and yang nurture and sustain. Governance follows measure, and retribution for sin or blessing is never overlooked.

I have undeservingly enjoyed favor and honor, ever mindful of caution and fear. Though I reflect on my faults and examine my heart, I still dread that in my conduct, the slightest error may go unnoticed.

This year, within my three destinies, the qi of earth and wood is weak; in the course of my fate, both life and fortune are meager. The heavenly tally occupies the position of office and emolument, while the year’s wandering star aligns with the direction of doom. The major cycle is afflicted by Saturn’s influence, and the minor cycle is governed by the original hour. Ketu lingers in a stagnant constellation, while Venus enters a realm of discord. Morning and night, I tremble with anxiety, fearing the onset of disaster.

Thus, I dare follow the sacred statutes and rites, preparing a pure offering in earnest prayer. My spirit races toward divine transformation, and I lift my gaze to the mysterious heavens in fervent supplication.

We pray that the celestial and terrestrial courts, the Nine Luminaries, and the Southern Palace will deign to witness our sincerity and bestow their profound protection. Grant me the grace of renewal, and pardon my past transgressions. Dissolve the calamities of the five phases and three destinies, and dispel the perils of the lunar mansions and dark voids. Cleanse my faults, and reconcile the debts of grievance. May I uphold impartiality and selflessness, and wholeheartedly serve my lord and kin. May public and private affairs flourish, and my household and dependents enjoy peace and well-being. May all, living and departed, together partake in blessings and good fortune.

**Prayer for the Nine Luminaries Offering by Minister of Works Xu Geng**

We humbly acknowledge that the Celestial Court and Earthly Bureau govern the registers of fate, while the Southern Palace and Northern Dipper record the cycles of life and death. The Three Officials hold the documents of judgment, and the Five Emperors preside over the ledgers of destiny. Thus, those of us below are indeed bound to the mysteries above.

Moreover, in this world of existence, good deeds are difficult to manifest, while transgressions and errors easily accumulate. Though I have long been undeservedly honored with distinction, I have failed to render commensurate service. Whether in governance I have erred in penal statutes, or in my domain I have misapplied rewards and punishments, my faults have piled up before the Earthly Bureau and Celestial Court, my sins entwined with the paths of stars and the realms of the sun. Yet I have offered no repentance, nor have my offenses been absolved.

Furthermore, in the midst of my current fate, I now face a time of calamity. Mars flies through my minor destiny, the Celestial Talisman enters my central palace. Mercury lies hidden in the realm of punishment and misfortune, Saturn retreats to a mansion of sorrow and distress. Though the fire of fortune waxes strong, the earth of my natal hour remains weak. For years now, my afflictions have not abated. My earnest supplications arise from deep anxiety and fear.

We reflect that the Supreme Sages and Perfected Ones, in their boundless compassion, nurture all things. With a devoted heart and focused mind, they respond unfailingly to all who call. Thus, we rely upon the bond of incense and flame, meticulously performing the rites of offering and prayer. In sincere repentance, we bow our heads in hope of mercy.

We implore Your compassionate regard for our humble service and Your gracious bestowal of divine protection. Dissolve the calamities already formed, pardon the sins and errors of the past. May the Southern Dipper extend my life, and the Northern Palace remove the mark of death. Secretly increase my allotted years, and grant me peace and security. May my illnesses be healed, my afflictions pacified, and my family and dependents enjoy health and prosperity. Thus shall I forever bear the boundless grace of the Many Sages, who grant me rebirth.

**Prayer for the Great Offering to the Southern Dipper by the River Lord and Grand Preceptor**

We humbly acknowledge that the great transformations of creation began with the division of primordial essence, giving rise to heaven and earth and shaping yin and yang. The Three Norms were established as foundations, and the Four Seasons were set in motion to complete the year. Thus, the myriad spirits received their offices, and the five *qi* were apportioned. The Celestial Court and Earthly Bureau oversee the registers of life and judgment, ordering the scales of sin and blessing, and regulating the mechanisms of retribution. Nothing, however minute, is overlooked; from ancient times to the present, no detail has been disordered.

Moreover, above, the celestial bodies trace their paths; below, the mountains and rivers are governed. Their influence waxes and wanes with the cycles of fate, and their warnings are manifest in reverence and caution. Gazing upon the mysterious teachings, how could we fail to cultivate ourselves accordingly?

I have long been favored by Heaven’s grace and blessed with sagely commendation. Elevated to the lofty rank of the balance, I wield the authority of the axe. Yet in upholding the jade statutes and golden laws, I fear I have erred in weighing matters of grave import. Though I have issued repeated commands, I am ashamed to have strayed from the proper path of instruction and governance.

Nevertheless, I have striven to aid my lord and devoted myself wholeheartedly to the realm. I have cut down the long serpents to restore the palace, and quelled great omens of disaster to still the weapons of war. I have reclaimed cities and shattered fortresses, transforming the customs of ant-like swarms and bee-like throngs into a people who turn toward civilization as guests toward a host. The Three Shu regions are now at peace, and the four classes of people live in harmony—all through the power of the Sages above. Though I have clearly received the favor of the divine, I still fear that in governance I may have fallen short.

Perhaps my faults and flaws are too grave to escape scrutiny. Perhaps I have strayed from the Dao and my heart has not yet aligned with the divine. Perhaps the stars of my domain portend disaster, or my current year brings a convergence of misfortune.

This year, my minor destiny encounters the *jiesha*, and my major destiny meets the Celestial Talisman. Saturn opposes my body’s palace, and my current year clashes with my life’s position. Constantly mindful of these warnings, I seek to perform rites of repentance and prayer.

Now, on this auspicious *bingwu* day—the day when the Southern Dipper descends in its true form—and with the Six Palaces of the Many Sages overseeing the registers of fate, I humbly present the rites of offering and libation, hoping to convey my earnest supplications.

We implore the Celestial Gate to bestow its blessings and the Pole Star to extend its mercy. Pardon the transgressions of the past, and grant auspicious protection for the future. May calamities and misfortunes be stilled, and our lands enjoy peace and tranquility. May distant and near regions revive, and dragons and spirits live in harmony. May wind and rain be balanced and timely, and illnesses and plagues be dispelled. Let the prosperity of the people be our greatest omen, and the abundance of the year our supreme blessing. May loyalty uphold the altars of state, and stillness answer the spirits. With sincere devotion, we seek to repay the mysterious grace above.

**Prayer to the Perfected Lord of Mount Qingcheng by Jia Zhang**

We humbly observe that Min and Shu form a mighty metropolis, the great bastion of the southwest. Below, its myriad valleys coil in repose; above, it upholds the Nine Purities.

**Prayer to the Perfected Lord of Mount Qingcheng by Jia Zhang**

It is the wondrous court of creation, the hidden sanctuary of immortals. Jade palaces and jasper towers lie concealed within the Terrace of Washings; emerald cliffs and cinnabar crags yawn aloft into cloud and mist. Here the loftiest Perfected dwell in repose, and the supreme Sages wander in leisure. Truly, it governs auspicious omens to bless the seas and lands.

I have been favored to encounter the transformative power of the Dao and have long borne its mysterious grace. Yet ashamed of my meager merits, I find it difficult to repay the virtue of heaven and earth. Living amidst the worldly, I easily accumulate faults and transgressions. In past lives and this present one, how could I be without error? The five phases and three destinies may yet bring misfortune and decline. The celestial paths and stellar patterns may cast baleful influences. Perhaps I am hindered by old grudges or entangled in unresolved disputes. Any of these would be cause for dread.

Thus, I dare to lay bare my heart upon the sacred peak, bowing my head to the immortal capital. With sincere offerings, I present my distant prayers. May you deign to witness my earnest devotion and bestow your mysterious favor, that boundless blessings may flow, life’s span be prolonged, and calamities dissolve. May sins and faults be absolved, grievances and debts reconciled, and official emoluments endure. I further pray for the continuity of descendants and the flourishing of my lineage. With a heart of reverent devotion, I seek to repay the protection of the immortal spirits.

**Prayer for the Birthday Offering to the Perfected Lord of Mount Qingcheng by Zong Kui, Prefect of Shuzhou**

We humbly observe that the Dao shapes all things, and the celestial origin establishes the supreme pole. The Perfected Sovereign issues commands, presiding over the myriad spirits. Thus, all beings receive their destiny and assume their forms, each inscribed in the celestial registers and ascending to the mysterious heights.

I have been nurtured by the generative power of the Great Dao and am deeply grateful for the sagely favor bestowed upon me. Entrusted with governance over the lands of Min and Chu, I bear the weight of the imperial balance. Though my achievements are manifest, they have not yet matched the workings of creation; though the honors granted me surpass those of past and present, the times are fraught with peril. The celestial chariot makes its solemn progress, and I regret that I cannot personally support the imperial pole, defend the emperor’s carriage, stabilize the cosmos, purify sun and moon, secure the great treasure, and restore the dynasty to prosperity. Only by invoking the true spirits do I hope to uphold my loyal devotion.

We revere Mount Qingcheng as the divine bastion of the celestial realm, where hosts of Sages reside and ranks of Perfected exercise their authority. Surely, they can marshal their numinous power, command the armies of the unseen, dispel calamities to pacify the Central Plains, and rescue the realm from chaos to restore the great enterprise. Thus, I follow the secret rites and reverently prepare the altar for offerings. May the unfathomable might of the spirits be turned to bestow boundless blessings, that demonic vapors be stilled and the imperial destiny flourish. May the phoenix’s reign and the dragon’s chart endure as long as heaven and earth.

I have accumulated faults and transgressions across lifetimes, and misfortunes loom unmanifest. Through this repentance and prayer, I seek their dissolution. This year, both my major and minor destinies reside in the western quadrant, clashing with my natal sign. Mars shines upon my native region and occupies my life palace. Earth traverses the dire conjunctions of misfortune, while Metal lies in discordant retreat. The year confronts the Three Killers’ position and stands at the Gate of Six Harms. I fear these baleful influences may bring disaster and am deeply anxious. Only through these offerings do I express my utmost sincerity, praying that calamities be averted and my loyalty fully realized. May I fulfill my duty to sovereign and state, accomplish my plans to quell chaos, and gloriously assist the sagely court—all through the protection of the spirits.

**Prayer for the Nine Luminaries by Zong Rujiu, Banquet Commissioner**

We humbly observe that the two luminaries radiate their numinous power, and the three origins govern transformation. All beings receive their forms and nurture their essences, looking up to the benevolence of the Great Dao; all are endowed with life and existence, ever indebted to the virtue of the divine.

I have been sheltered by the mysterious grace of the Dao and have fortuitously encountered a time of prosperity. Repeatedly, I have been undeservingly honored with favor and burdened with official duties. Yet my achievements remain unworthy, and I am deeply moved by the extraordinary grace bestowed upon me. In my conduct and self-discipline, I dare not forget vigilance and diligence. Yet in my thoughts and reflections, I fear I may have been remiss. Moreover, my duties are weighty and difficult: overseeing banquets, rewarding troops, preparing feasts, comforting the masses, and disciplining the army. I fear that in administering punishments, I may err in severity or leniency; in butchering and cooking, I may commit unintended mistakes. These could lead to grievances and debts, accumulating sins and flaws. Perhaps in past lives or this one, old transgressions remain unresolved. The five phases and three destinies may yet harbor misfortune. This year, the dimly shining Saturn resides in my life palace, while the celestial tally of the Five Demons approaches my fate’s path. Mars nears the palace of punishment and misfortune, and Venus traverses the position that clashes with my nature. Illness has arisen, lingering unresolved.

Fearing that calamities may deepen, I knock upon the gates of prayer, knowing that the utmost Perfected aid all beings, and the Great Dao cherishes life. It broadly opens the gates of expiation and demonstrates its responsive power. Thus, I follow the prescribed rituals and reverently prepare the altar, baring my heart to the Nine Luminaries and gazing upon the stellar hosts to present my earnest pleas. May the celestial light deign to witness my devotion, and the sagely creation lend its aid. May past injuries and unintended killings be absolved, and sins accumulated across lifetimes be pardoned. May dire conjunctions be dissolved, and calamities dispelled. May the six qi flow freely, and the hundred ailments be cured. May the blessings of my allotted fate be fulfilled, and my official emoluments extended; may the grace of rebirth be granted, and my lifespan prolonged. May public and private affairs prosper, and my family and dependents enjoy peace. I look up to the mysterious grace with reverence.

**Prayer for the Perfection of the Cosmos by the Duke of Suifu**

We humbly observe that the Great Dao of emptiness and non-being nurtures all beings, while the myriad spirits of heaven and earth govern all things. As for the bestowal of form and endowment of qi, the manifestation of images and the exercise of numinous power—all rely on the workings of creation and depend upon the generative power of life.

I inwardly reflect upon my meager virtue and have long borne the grace of the Dao. My contributions to the sagely court remain unworthy, yet the honors bestowed upon me as a regional pillar have been abundant. The banners of office and dragon seals, the insignia of authority and military command—repeatedly, I have received the emperor’s favor. Yet mindful of my inadequacy, I am deeply anxious. I constantly fear that rewards and punishments may be unjust, that legal judgments may be improper, that my actions may deviate from principle, and that my governance may fail to harmonize with the people’s will. In construction projects, there is the burden of labor; in banquets and rewards, the expense of feasting. Unintended injuries and killings, old debts and grudges—these sins and faults may incur divine censure.

At times, the Five Phases and Three Destinies, the dimmed luminaries and arrayed stars, jointly weave calamitous entanglements, giving rise to illness and misfortune. Though not yet fully recovered, I am doubly alarmed by the peril. This year, my major fate resides in the domain of declining qi, while my minor fate occupies the position of the broken Horse. Jupiter retreats above the Palace of the Body, Saturn shines upon the direction of the Three Harmonies. The Metal and Water stars lodge in discordant constellations, while the Flying Heavenly Mars occupies the celestial mansion of my natal destiny. The Nine Palaces’ Saturn once more governs my birth month. Witnessing these baleful portents, I am deeply moved to offer prayers and supplications.

Thus, in accordance with the *Mysterious Regulations of the Numinous Treasure* and the *Secret Patterns of the River Chart*, I have arranged a grand *jiao* ritual spanning the celestial circuit, repenting and beseeching the Supreme Mystery. I humbly implore the myriad sages to be moved by my sincerity, the host of spirits to witness my devotion, to accept my earnest pleas, and to bestow blessings and felicity. May past debts and former grievances be dissolved, deep calamities and grave transgressions pardoned. May my mandate and emoluments be prolonged, my years of life extended. Amid the Five Stars and Four Sceneries, may all perils and misfortunes be forever dispelled; within the celestial and terrestrial bureaus, may auspicious omens be newly inscribed. May my ailments be wholly dispelled, granting me peace and ease. May my loyalty and filial piety be further strengthened, that I may better serve my sovereign and parents.

Thus, I reverently rely upon the protective grace of the exalted ones, a favor I can never fully repay.

**Memorial for the Nine Luminaries Ritual Offered on Behalf of the Prince by His Attendant**
I have heard that the celestial bodies manifest numinous radiance, acting on Heaven’s behalf to transform all under heaven. They unfold the efficacy of the Dao and make manifest the wondrous works of the spirits.

At the very inception of cosmic division, the luminaries revealed their sovereign power of illumination. All living beings, moving and still, depend entirely upon their mysterious grace. I have received the celestial benevolence and am deeply steeped in the imperial favor. Yet my achievements remain unworthy of the encompassing earth and sustaining heaven, while my honors and glory already surpass those of all other ministers. I constantly fear that my conduct may stray from propriety, that rewards and punishments may be misapplied. The golden statutes and jade decrees may falter in compassion; campaigns against rebels and executions of the wicked may err in leniency toward the axe and block. Grudges from former ages remain unresolved, while the transgressions of this life swiftly become manifest. Reflecting upon this, I am ever filled with trembling awe.

Moreover, in this year, both the major and minor cycles of my fate converge in opposition. From beginning to end, the eclipsing spirits all take their positions in illumination. My branches are bound to fire and wood, yet lie within the waning qi; the celestial tally flies forth, resting upon the post horse. Together, these portend calamity and stagnation, deepening my anxiety and dread. Recently, I have been afflicted by minor ailments, which have yet to fully abate. Thus, my prayers for grace and atonement are all the more earnest.

On this day of my nativity, I reverently offer this ritual memorial. May the Most Sagely Ones deign to look upon my sincerity, absolve the faults of the past, and dissolve the perils yet to come. May my years of life and allotted emoluments be extended, and all enmities and doubts be harmonized and released. Thus may I fully dedicate my humble devotion, uphold the great treasure, pacify the weary populace, and assist in the restoration of the realm. I vow to devote my heart to self-cultivation and diligence, forever repaying the bounty of the true numina.

*Here ends Volume Eight of the Guangcheng Collection*
*Guangcheng Collection, Volume Nine*

**Memorial for the Nativity Ritual of Minister Zheng Tan of Qingcheng**
*Composed by Du Guangting, Grand Virtue of Literary Works by Imperial Commission, Purple-Robed Bestower, Inner Attendant of the Supreme Clarity Palace in the Upper Capital*

I humbly submit: Born of qi and endowed with spirit, we wholly depend on the Great Dao. Our lives and natures emerge by the grace of the Supreme Mystery. The span of longevity we pray to extend, the boundary between fortune and misfortune—all hinge upon the interplay of the Five Phases and the alternation of the Two Qi. Truly, we rely on the governance of the divine, and dare not slacken in reverent devotion.

This year, the year-star of Mars resides in the direction of my nativity; the Golden Star of the Nine Palaces stands above my current age. Long afflicted by illness, I have yet to recover. I fear that in my conduct and intentions, I may have fallen short in hidden virtue; in nurturing the people and fostering all things, I may have neglected governance. Perhaps lingering transgressions from past lives remain unexpiated, or ancient enmities unresolved. Such grievous calamities have left me no path for repentance and prayer.

Moreover, this site borders upon the immortal mountains, its earth aligned with the grotto-heavens. My sincerity may be declared, and the true numina cannot be deceived. Thus, on this day of my nativity, I dare to prepare the ritual of offering and prayer. With a cleansed heart, I confess my faults and earnestly beseech for life.

I humbly implore that the phoenix-drawn chariots may pause and descend to this mortal realm. Moved by my distress, bestow upon me your grace and repose. Strike my name from the Black Register of death, and extend my years and emoluments anew. Inscribe my fate in the Vermilion Record of life, and absolve all deep transgressions. May enmities be harmonized, calamities dissolved, public and private affairs flourish, and my kinfolk dwell in peace. I vow never to forget my resolve for self-exertion, that I may repay the protection of the true numina.

*Memorial for the Ritual of Offering and Prayer by the Minister of Works of Zongshou Prefecture in Guozhou*

I have heard that the Two Luminaries illumine the heavens, governing all beings below. Life and death are bound to them, as are sin and fortune. Though I am but dust, I have received their gaze and protection. Yet within the three destinies, the forces of water and fire are weak. This year, the celestial net of the year-star and the month-star of *chen* and *xu* ensnares me, while the two cyclical phases meet their tombs—both ominous times. Moreover, Mars has entered the Palace of the Head, and dark stars lurk in the position of my fate. Disasters accumulate, and my dread runs deep.

Thus, I dare to follow the luminous statutes, reverently presenting this ritual memorial. I uphold the blessings of purification and meticulously prepare the offerings of prayer. For three days, I maintain solemnity; at nine hours, I submit my petitions. I humbly hope that the dark compassion may shine upon me, and the vast grace descend. Grant that my calamitous fate be pacified, my misfortunes transcended. May I prolong my allotted blessings, and justly receive felicity and fortune. May I forever preserve peace and constantly receive protection. In serving my parents and sovereign, and in bringing tranquility to the realm and home—shall I not vow to exhaust my sincerity and repay the dark grace?

*Memorial for the Earth-Thanksgiving Ritual by Yang Shentuan*

I humbly submit: The Dao’s qi divides its radiance, and the dark power governs all. Below, it stabilizes the numinous transformations; above, it matches the arrayed stars. Here, the myriad sages gather in repose, and the host of immortals find their abode. From the beginning of kalpas to this very day, the Jade Maidens have ascended as honored guests, recognizing the fragrant springs by the riverbanks; the Dark Primordial One has halted his chariot, leaving the Jade Bureau at the city’s edge. The auspicious splendor of the Heavenly Eye shines forth to pacify the well and net of the land; the paths and tunnels of the Grotto-Palace open to bless the earth’s foundation.

This is the sacred precinct of the Brocade Capital, the divine and transcendent abode of Shu. Yet for long, its halls have lain neglected, its sacred grounds overgrown. The pure altars have become trampled grounds, the secluded halls tainted by the stench of impurity. Our king of Shu, with far-reaching divine insight, gazing upon this numinous threshold, swiftly commanded its purification and restoration. The soot was swept from the stone walls, revealing the immortal’s majesty; the brambles were cleared from the overgrown steps, once more revealing the sacred grotto.

Thereafter, repeated renovations gradually restored its splendor. Halls stand in sight of one another, towers and terraces stand side by side. The gates and portals were relocated, now overlooking the bustling thoroughfares. Evening chimes and morning bells now fulfill the rites of dawn and dusk; morning incense and evening lamps now complete the rituals of purification. How may I repay such virtue? My gratitude arises from this.

Thus, I present this ritual of offering and prayer, hoping to reach the true numina. I humbly implore that divine grace be widely bestowed, and great blessings generously conferred. May the sagely sovereign’s years be prolonged, and the myriad regions pacified; may the king of Shu’s longevity be extended like the camphor and cassia, and the Three Shu enjoy renewed peace. May the generals and officers of the encamped troops each be exalted in the annals of merit; may the households of the people together delight in the harmony of peace. May the dragon deities rejoice, and the crops flourish in abundance. May pestilence not encroach, and weapons forever be sheathed.

For those who have defiled this place with foulness or violated it with excavation, through this repentance and prayer, may all be absolved. We, who assist the times and benefit the people, who propagate the teachings and establish merit, who present offerings to the throne and commune with the sacred—may public and private affairs thrive, and our kinfolk dwell in safety. Moreover, may the transformative power of the past teachings and the old virtues of the former masters flow unobstructed, and the fruits of the Dao swiftly ripen. May the officials within and without, the yin and yang generals and functionaries, be promoted in rank and forever assist the court of blessings. May we ever uphold the wind of the Supreme Dao and constantly receive the grace of the exalted numina.

**Prayer at the Yu Temple in Zhongzhou**

We humbly acknowledge that the Three Qi gave form to the embryo, and the Nine Origins shaped the essence. Pure and light, turbid and heavy—true essence refined in the furnace of creation. Emerging from *Zhen* and riding *Qian*, the *Great Ease* unveiled the latent potential of Heaven and Earth. The sky of Yao succeeded in covering, the sun of Shun transmitted its brightness. The Five Teachings were duly spread, yet the fate of Huai and Xiang remained unchanged; the Four Gates were opened, yet the sorrows of darkness and inundation still lingered.

Only our sagacious and luminous sovereign, rescuing this lower realm, toiled for four years and wearied himself for the myriad regions. Vast and untroubled, the hundred grains knew the path of tributary flow; towering and revered, the mountains recognized the supremacy of the sacred peaks. He demarcated the Nine Provinces and pacified the myriad beings. The merit of casting the tripods was accomplished, and the reward of bestowing ranks was made manifest. This great achievement shall shine through all antiquity.

Your servant, having long received your vast grace, is privileged to serve at this immortal shrine. Ba’s rains and Wu’s clouds descend upon the jade hall; the waters of Min and the vistas of Chu gleam upon the crystalline steps. We pray that your boundless mercy may turn toward us, deigning to regard our earnest supplications. Delving into the scriptures of the jade grotto, we perform the libation upon the sacred peak. May this fulfill the distant prayers of the King of Shu and grant this humble servant’s wish to return home.

**Prayer at the Immortal Capital’s Mountain Altar by the King of Shu**

We humbly acknowledge that true essence manifests auspiciousness, and primordial *qi* divides into forms. Accumulated excellence and layers of refinement in the human realm congealed into an immortal mountain; gathered subtlety and wonder beyond the material world established a solemn grotto-heaven. Above, it connects to the stars; below, it blesses the state and its people.

Thus, the palaces of jade and gates of pearl remain profoundly secluded and difficult to glimpse. Feathered canopies and rainbow banners descend in ethereal flight. The Two Perfected Ones and the traces of the Three Capitals are revealed; the merit of the Nine Tripods is fulfilled. Ascending to perfection in broad daylight, they soar through the cinnabar heavens. Their majestic power ever grows, and the phenomena of the world are perpetually renewed. Precious scriptures and true classics, inscribed in jade and encased in jasper, are stored in the cloud palaces as a guardian presence, enduring alongside the illustrious footsteps of the past.

In distant contemplation of the mysterious wind, we gallop our unadorned sincerity. Now, as the Three Rivers witness transformation, we repeatedly encounter the ravages of war. Phoenix missives and dragon writings are no longer found in the walls of Lu; tiger tallies and turtle registers are difficult to seek in the pits of Qin. The Great Teaching has declined—it is fitting to restore and uplift it.

Therefore, we raise our gaze to the verdant peaks and bow our heads to the white clouds. We perform the rites of libation and offering, hoping for the scrutiny of the divine immortals. We set aside the sealed scriptures of the Crane Grotto to serve as the scriptures revered by humans and heavens. We await the completion of this extraordinary merit and the return to the former abode.

We privately reflect that the Dao is present everywhere, and the Dharma permits free circulation. Gazing upward at your great favor, we trust it will truly harmonize with our sincere devotion. We also pray that your hidden blessings may universally extend to the world. May the descendants of the Mysterious Origin flourish and prosper; may the palace city of the sagely sovereign be restored. May the Nine Lands know tranquility, and the myriad beings shine in harmony. May our borders be secure, our people healthy and at peace; may disasters cease of their own accord, and our allotted years and blessings increase.

Ever holding fast to a heart of loyalty and sincerity, we aspire to fully receive the protection of the Most Perfected. We cannot express the depth of our devotion.

Upon Arriving at Mount Xiandu to Present the Offering Text

We humbly consider that since the primordial transformation first divided, this mountain has stood as a guardian. To its front lies the prospect of Chu; to its side, it commands the city of Ba. Myriad streams encircle it in winding loops, its stern fastnesses arrayed as the abode of dragons and serpents; countless peaks stand in guard, their beauty forming the capital of perfected sages. The two Perfected Ones soared aloft in former dynasties, their illustrious traces shining through a thousand years. Its cliffs and peaks block out the sun, its pines and cypresses pierce the clouds. Auspicious omens gleam in its records, blessings silently sustain the state.

The King of Shu upheld the heavens, his flourishing deeds renowned through the ages. With heroic bearing, he ruled the Eight States and the Two Rivers; early on, he was enfeoffed within the royal domains, while the cities of Qian and the passes of Chu all fell within his shaping influence. Yet this immortal mountain alone shines forth across the realm.

Gazing upward to its sacred traces, we bow our heads in reverence; from afar, we extend our sincere prayers. Turning our hearts toward its secluded precincts, we devoutly perform the offering rites. We seek the writings of Yu’s cave, awaiting the encounter with the Eight Assemblies’ scriptures; we delve into the archives of Dongting, hoping to attain the Five Talismans’ secrets. May their profound mysteries be widely expounded, the true lineage fully unfolded.

Moreover, as the great teaching declines and the Central Plains face many hardships, its transmission and practice must await free circulation. We ourselves have traversed vast waves, dutifully following the established command. Burning incense, we make this solemn declaration, praying that our sincere devotion may be witnessed.

We aspire that by the Fenshui Bridge, it shall not be only the Han minister who receives transmission; by the Quyang Springs, it shall not be only Lord Gan who is granted the teachings. Carrying the sacred texts westward, may the sagely teaching be revived in this age of renewal. We cannot express the fullness of our devotion.

**Li Yanfu’s Memorial for the Luo Tian Jiao Ritual on Behalf of the Prince of Shu**

We humbly acknowledge that the Dao crowns the void and nothingness, its merit preceding the covering of heaven and the bearing of earth. It shapes and nurtures all things, its nurturance impartial. Through boundless kalpas it endures, outlasting heaven and earth. Its fashioning never ceases, its life-giving transformations ever more manifest.

Your servant has long been graced with profound favor, faithfully upholding the Dao’s dispensation. Yet my merits are as light as dust and dew, while my burden is as weighty as the balance of state. Across thousands of miles of mountains and rivers, I have traversed the six garrisons; for seventeen years, I have governed and pacified this region. Ever fearful that fortune may turn to calamity, and that my feeble strength may breed conflict, I remain vigilant in self-examination, overwhelmed by anxiety and dread.

Moreover, with the imperial carriage yet to return and the Central Plains beset by ramparts, my exhortations to train troops and inspire warriors are but empty aspirations to serve the state and aid the sovereign. Gazing toward the palace, my heart races—how distant the heavens, how remote the sun! My meager efforts yield no effect; my solitary sincerity finds no outlet.

Now, as the Four Divine Beings embark on their grand procession, lingering in the lands of Yong and Qin, and the Lesser Procession of Heavenly Unity arrives in the regions of Liang and Shu, the earth once more aligns with the Palace of Kun, while the moon’s comet traverses the Well Mansion. Gazing upon these celestial signs, I reflect upon the looming disasters. Deeply I fear that the phoenix carriage and simurgh chariot, though guarded by the hundred-fold passes and rivers, remain unrecovered; that the imperial tombs and ancestral temples, though walled by the nine-fold gates, stand yet empty.

Thus, with earnest prayer, I await your divine regard and protection. In accordance with the mystic statutes and the luminous precepts, I have prepared the Yellow Register Daoist ritual and established the grand Luo Tian Jiao. To the Nine Purities and Three Realms, we present rites of repentance and gratitude; to the celestial perfected and earthly spirits, we offer ceremonies of supplication and prayer. Encompassing the realms of sun, moon, and stars, extending to the uttermost mountains, rivers, peaks, and streams, we exhaust all reverence and solemnity, completing the full cycle of communion and response.

We humbly beseech the Heavenly Worthy to descend his mandate, the Sage Ancestors to bestow their blessings, and the divine powers to lend their aid, that the state’s fortunes may be secured, its grand designs firmly established, and its imperial destiny renewed. May it stand as enduring as the North Star, as eternal as the Southern Mountains.

Your servant, entrusted with heaven’s grace, shall forever uphold the Tang dynasty’s years. May I enjoy the longevity of the pine and cedar, and devote myself with the loyalty of metal and stone. May the realm know no disasters or pestilence, the years be blessed with abundant harvests. May timely rains fall, and weapons of war be stilled. May dragon spirits rest in tranquility, and the people and officials dwell in peace. May the gates of the underworld be touched by the mercy of deliverance, and distant lands yearn for the harmony of our transformative influence.

I vow to magnify the pure and tranquil, in gratitude to the true numina.

**Middle-Level Three Sovereigns Jiao Ritual Memorial**

We humbly acknowledge that the dark canopy floats above, the yellow chariot anchors below. The primordial essence descends as auspicious omens, responding to the unfolding of destiny and the opening of the cosmic plan.

**Grand Supreme Jiao Ritual Memorial for the Luo Heaven**

We grasp the six celestial cycles to reign supreme, our grace encompassing all within the four seas; we embody the Three Powers to shepherd all beings, our benevolence suffusing every living thing. Our moral influence fills the realm, our numinous radiance enduring across the ages, unwaning through time. We, unworthy, have received Heaven’s favor to guard the earthly quadrant. Overwhelmed by the burden of its vast protection, we vow unswerving loyalty and steadfast devotion.

Yet the celestial mandate remains unfulfilled, Heaven’s decree in temporary decline. Gazing toward the clouds, the River Chart and Luo Writ remain distant; bearing the sun aloft, mountains and rivers still bar the way. Our crimson hearts burn with sincerity, yet our toil yields no fruit.

Now the Four Spirits embark on their grand procession through the lands of Yong and Qin; the Lesser Procession of Heavenly Unity halts in the regions of Liang and Shu. The earthly guardian stabilizes the southwest, while the comet traverses the Well Mansion. Consulting the weft-texts and celestial portents, we prostrate ourselves in deep concern.

Thus, we unroll the sacred statutes and reverently prepare the Yellow Register. We conduct the Grand Luo Heaven Jiao, entreating the true numina of the Three Realms. May they bestow divine favor to reverse Heaven’s decree. Let the loyal and righteous, the valiant and resolute, wield the might of wind and thunder to sweep away all obstacles; let the civil and martial deities lend their power to restore order and governance.

May the imperial line flourish anew, malevolent vapors forever stilled. May the Nine Provinces witness an era of clarity and peace, the Three Regions of Shu receive the gift of tranquility. May disasters be averted before they arise, and blessings descend without end. Whether moving or still, living or perishing, all shall together bask in the grace of divine protection.

We dare not presume further.

Your Majesty,

In reverent examination of celestial portents and apterial signs, we find that this year the Great Wandering of the Four Spirits resides in the lands of Yong and Qin, while the Lesser Wandering of Heaven’s Unity has shifted to the region of Liang and Shu. Earth’s Unity has descended to the Palace of Kun, and the Comet of Lunar Eclipse traverses the Well Mansion. Gazing upon the celestial degrees, we trace the ominous conjunction of these signs. Reflecting upon ourselves and pressing hand to heart, we are filled with dread and trepidation.

Thus, we dare to follow the numinous statutes, establish sacred altars, conduct the Yellow Register’s solemn fast, and prepare the Grand Luo Heaven Jiao. We unfold the mysteries of the Dao and reveal the true scriptures. We humbly beseech the august deities to turn their radiance toward the Supreme Mystery, bestow blessings upon the earth below, and extend their auspicious favor far and wide, that calamitous alignments may forever cease. Grant that our borders remain secure, the dragon spirits harmonious, the people hale and prosperous, all regions revived and restored, pestilence averted, and weapons laid to rest. In our devout observance, we strive to fulfill the divine work.

We dare not presume further.

*Invocation for the Luo Heaven Jiao of the Five Sacred Peaks and Four Waterways*

We observe that as the Two Modes rise and set, the firm and yielding assume their places; as the Three Powers expand, rivers and mountains take form. The Earth’s virtue manifests its capacity to bear all things, and the myriad beings receive the gift of life-sustaining power. Though the primordial chaos knows no bounds, the cycles of nine and six still portend peril; though its expanse is infinite, it remains bound to the fortunes of obstruction and flourishing.

Now, as the movements of yin’s intestines dictate, and the apterial signs reveal, the Lesser Wandering of Heaven’s Unity has shifted to Liang and Shu, while the Great Wandering of the Four Spirits has likewise settled in Yong and Qin. Earth’s Unity has descended to the Palace of Kun, and the Comet of Lunar Eclipse traverses the Well Mansion. Gazing upon the celestial degrees, we are struck with awe and dread.

We, undeserving yet long entrusted with the grace of imperial favor, have long guarded the frontier as a shield. Our domain spans six garrisons, girded by mighty rivers. Our waters rank among the Four Waterways in dignity, our mountains stand as the eldest of the Five Peaks. The altars of immortals and numinous transformations bear traces of dragon-drawn chariots and crane-borne flights; the jeweled shores and golden dikes mark the lands where Yu dredged the waters and Qin opened the roads. Here, the true spirits reside, and auspicious responses abound. We must secure their blessings to fulfill our devout prayers.

Thus, we dare to present the Yellow Register in solemn fast and inaugurate the Luo Heaven Jiao. May the host of sages cast their light upon us, and the myriad spirits descend with their blessings. Together, may they stabilize Heaven’s course and eternally uphold the imperial design. Dispel the gloom over the divine capital, that we may once more behold the sacred sun; unify the chariots and script of the realm, that we may preserve the Tang’s enduring reign. Grant that our lands remain at peace, our people at ease. Let no beacon fires blaze on the borders, and let the customs of the land resound with songs of praise. Avert disasters before they arise, and dissolve the lingering faults of the past. We vow to remain steadfast in devotion, repaying the divine work.

We dare not presume further.

*Universal Invocation for the Luo Heaven Jiao*

We have heard that the mysterious work governs all, and the transformative power of the Dao spreads forth. It endows forms with images, coalesces spirits, and circulates qi. Heaven covers and Earth bears, arising from the boundless; sun and moon illuminate, giving rise to the ten thousand things. As for the ascent and descent of yin and yang, the passage of kalpas and the shifting of epochs, Heaven and Earth have their cycles of nine and six, while the sun and moon have their waxing and waning.

To seek deliverance and protection, we must rely on the true spirits. We, in our humble station, have encountered an era of flourishing fortune. We have been undeservingly drenched in extraordinary favor, ascending to singular honors. Dragon tablets and tiger tallies have apportioned the weight of mountains and rivers; golden statutes and jade laws have entrusted us with the lives of the people. We constantly reproach ourselves for our inadequacy in governance, ever mindful of the perils of excess.

Yet now, as the Central Plains face manifold trials and Heaven’s course grows arduous, the altars of state hang in peril, and the realm is steeped in suffering. In training and marshaling our forces, we can but hold fast to our resolve to serve the state; from afar, gazing toward the divine capital, we find no path to support Heaven’s cause.

Now, in examining the apterial signs and consulting the sacred charts, we find the Great Wandering of the Four Spirits in the lands of Yong and Qin, and the Lesser Wandering of Heaven’s Unity near the region of Liang and Shu. Earth’s Unity has descended to the Palace of Kun, and the Comet of Lunar Eclipse entangles the Well Mansion. Gazing upon the celestial degrees, our dread deepens.

Thus, we dare to unfold the scriptures of the Numinous Treasure, follow the standards of the River Chart, establish the Grand Luo Heaven Jiao, and open the sacred altar of the Yellow Register. We reverently beseech the Golden Gates and Jade Capital, invoking the myriad sages; we proclaim to all spirits within and beyond the cosmos. We rein in the horse of the mind to bare our hearts, and entrust our prayers to the incense dragon. May we be deemed worthy of divine regard and granted the descent of numinous power.

We humbly implore the deities of the Three Realms and all heavens, the Four Offices and Five Emperors, the sovereigns of Qian’s origin and the august spirits of the earthly courts. Bestow the unfathomable power of yin and yang, and lend the boundless force of transformation. Let the divine armies secretly assist, and the true responses subtly manifest. May the great enterprise be revived, and all directions know peace. May the imperial foundation stand forever, and the Four Seas be cleansed. Sweep away the baleful stars from the vast sky, and exterminate the leviathans in the mighty waves. May we ever gaze upon the sacred sun and together uphold the Heaven of Yao.

Grant that our domain remain secure, calamities stilled, the five weapons sheathed, and the four seasons harmonized. Let the people know no fear of plague, and the harvests promise abundance. In the Three Rivers and Six Garrisons, may the people, the spirits of the land and waters, all enjoy joy and well-being, together attaining purity and auspiciousness. May the lost souls and lingering consciousnesses of the six destinies and three paths bathe in the mysterious grace to quicken their spirits, ascend to the Crimson Mound, and receive blessings. Whether living or dead, moving or still, may all be revived and restored.

We vow to pour forth our loyalty and filial piety, striving to meet the divine gaze.

We dare not presume further.

*Invocation for the Luo Heaven Jiao to All Spirits*

We observe that humanity serves as the host of the spirits, and the spirits rely on humanity for transformation; the spirits bless humanity, and humanity depends on the spirits for aid. From Heaven’s mandate to Earth’s governance, from states to households, from antiquity to the present, all follow this Dao.

Our Great Tang, whose virtue was sown by Gaoyao, whose blessings were bequeathed by the sagely ancestors, has illuminated the Central Plains and transmitted its legacy through twenty emperors. The mysterious wind has fanned the myriad lands, and the imperial grace has suffused the Nine Provinces. All beings have basked in its sheltering care.

Yet now, as fortune has turned to adversity and the times have brought displacement, Heaven’s course remains unsettled, and the Emperor’s Chariot has not returned. Loyal ministers and righteous knights all hold fast to their resolve to serve the state; gazing toward the sun and looking to Heaven, none dare abandon their duty to the king.

Now, as the Lesser Wandering of Heaven’s Unity entangles the region of Liang and Shu, and the Great Wandering of the Four Spirits resides in the lands of Yong and Qin, the Comet of Lunar Eclipse traverses the Well Mansion, and Earth’s Unity has descended to the Palace of Kun. The apterial signs make this clear, and our dread and concern deepen.

Herewith, in reverent adherence to the mystic canons and with diligent study of the numinous ordinances, we have prepared the precious Yellow Register Fast and established the Grand Offering of the Heavenly Veil. Below, we have delved into the Nine Abysses; above, we have ascended to the Three Pure Realms. Solemnly arraying the rites of repentance, we humbly beseech the response of sympathetic resonance.

We prostrate ourselves before the august deities and holy sages, trusting that they will look with compassion upon our sincere devotion. May their divine might thunder forth, and may propitious winds reverse the baleful omens. Sweep away the perils that assail the azure vault, and extinguish the miasmic vapors that shroud the imperial capital. May the grand design be eternally secured, and the great enterprise of restoration flourish.

Next, we pray that the borders and regions of the realm be freed from calamity and obscurity. May the gathering of misfortunes be dispelled, and the qi of harmony and peace be summoned. May the dragon spirits be harmonious, and wind and rain be evenly regulated. May pestilence and plague be kept at bay, and weapons of war be truly sheathed. We vow to govern with diligence, that our efforts may complement the works of the divine. With millet and grain, fragrant and pure, we offer our utmost reverence; with pondweed and water plants, we fulfill the solemnity of the fast. We pour forth our earnest entreaties, prostrate and unable to contain ourselves.

*Memorial for the Life-Span Offering of Prince Shu to the Transformation of Immortal Ge*

Prostrate, we reflect: the vault of heaven arrays its luminaries, with the Dragon Star presiding above; the square earth shapes its forms, with the transformations of immortals apportioned below. Truly, they oversee the registers of destiny and govern the order of humankind. We have received the mystic mechanism and have long enjoyed illustrious protection. Early on, we were graced with abundant favor and entrusted with the governance of this multitude. Though we hold the frontiers of six marches, our virtue is meager and shallow; though we oversee the sacred sites of manifold transformations, our sincerity brims with joy and honor. We constantly fear that our governance may falter, failing to meet the scrutiny of the true immortals.

Now, as the Great Unity traverses the regions apportioned to its course, we dread that calamity may befall the lands of Liang and Yi, or that in the borders of Yong and Qin, the Comet of Lunar Eclipse may entangle the Well Mansion, and Earth’s Unity may bring disaster to the Palace of Kun. Consulting the apocryphal texts, we are filled with dread and concern. Moreover, this year is the ding-mao year, which marks the year of our own life’s origin; this month is the second month of spring, the season of our birth. We approach the transformation of our life’s origin, and on this day of our nativity, we reverently prepare incense and lamps, earnestly offering our prayers and supplications.

We humbly implore the Primordial Honored One to look upon us with compassion, and the host of sages to deign to witness our devotion. May our plain entreaties ascend to the celestial palaces, and may great blessings be bestowed upon the earth below. May the imperial enterprise be revived, disasters cease, and the imperial cortege return to Qin; may the realm and its borders enjoy peace and prosperity, and the inauspicious fortunes be dispelled, bringing auspicious omens to Shu. Thus may we fully realize our resolve to serve the sovereign and truly fulfill our heart’s concern for the state. May the hundred grains flourish, all beings enjoy harmony and peace, the dragon spirits bestow their favor, and pestilence and plague be kept at bay. May our seven ancestors ascend to heaven, and their years be prolonged. We vow to propagate the Dao and its transformations, in repayment of the divine grace. We are prostrate and unable to contain ourselves.

May this prayer be offered to the Southern Dipper:

We humbly acknowledge that the mysterious Dao divides and unfolds, initiating the mechanism of transformation. Clear and turbid are fixed in their ascending and descending positions; yin and yang operate the pivot of punishment and virtue. The Southern Dipper governs life, bestowing prosperity and encouraging goodness; the Northern Palace records death, compiling transgressions to restrain wrongdoing. The divine luminaries employ these to transform humanity, while the sovereign uses them to achieve governance. Not even the most minute detail is overlooked, and this has remained constant from ancient times to the present.

Your servant, born under the guidance of true teachings and revering the profound instructions of the Dao, dares not forget exhortation and self-cultivation. Yet, burdened with office in these troubled times, though I strive with diligence and reverence, I still fear neglect and deviation; though I remain vigilant and anxious, I am justly reproached for occupying a position without merit. In suppressing treachery and eradicating evil, I have sometimes enforced penal statutes, sometimes overseen punishments, sometimes administered the lash. In rewarding soldiers, I may have permitted executions; in feasting guests, I could not avoid the slaughter of animals. I fear that through such acts, unintended harm may have been inflicted, giving rise to deep enmity and grave offense.

Moreover, as I advance in years, my minor destiny encounters calamity. The stars that entangle me are illumined by Mars. The moon passes through *Shen* and *Wei*, while the celestial tally resides in the hour of my birth; my position faces *Chou* and *Yin*, where the flying banner strikes the point of destruction. Apprehensive of this convergence of misfortune, I am all the more alarmed.

Though I examine myself and reflect, tempering punishments and acting with caution, reducing feasts and moderating wine, avoiding excess and guarding against transgression, I still fear that misfortune has not been dispelled and blessings have not manifested. Reverently consulting the canonical texts and devoutly approaching the sacred mountain, I follow the ritual forms of the Southern Dipper, adhering to the celestial divisions of the supreme mystery. The ninefold subtle lamps cast their radiance, arrayed to correspond with the six stars; the incense of unified virtue rises in clouds, its hue ascending to the Three Primes. The bamboo hall summons both the void and the real; the pine pavilion may descend the true numina.

Thus, laying bare my heart, I dare to hope for divine favor. We prostrate ourselves and pray: may the six august palaces of the upper saints suspend the registers of death to prolong life; may the five exalted stellar deities shatter the chariot of misfortune and pour forth blessings. May grievances and resentments dissolve, calamities and perils be pacified. May kin be secure, borders and towns prosperous. May wind and rain be harmonious, grains abundant. May bandits and thieves not arise, and pestilence and plague not occur.

We humbly beseech that the *Lingbao Jade Scriptures* and the *Red Emperor’s Celestial Writ* descend to illuminate the southern cinnabar, bestowing benevolent grace upon the earth below. May we forever receive steadfast fortune, fulfilling our prayers. We are prostrate and unable to contain ourselves.

**Memorial for the Life-Renewal Offering of Vice-Governor Zheng Xu**

We humbly acknowledge that the Dark Heaven suspends its signs, and the Dipper and Pole Star hold their exalted station. They govern the ten thousand beings with impartiality, and steer the four seasons to complete the year. Below, they oversee the registers of destiny and govern fortune and misfortune. Whatever is felt is communicated; whatever is prayed for is answered.

Your servant, since youth, has reverently gazed upon your majestic power. I regard the Seven Stars as the pivot of Heaven and Earth, and the Five Qi as the foundation of all transformation. They command fortune and misfortune, and regulate the spirits. I have ever turned my heart toward the Supreme Mystery, and in times of difficulty, I have always turned to the Northern Dipper. Repeatedly, I have received manifest blessings, and auspicious signs have descended in abundance. My movements are as if followed by a shadow; my affairs are as if answered by an echo.

At times, I have wished to resign my post, seeking physicians to cure my ailments. At others, I have feared treading upon the mechanisms of misfortune, shunning ill and pursuing good. Or, when my aspirations were assailed by slander, or my flaws stirred by suspicion and resentment, I have secretly poured out my sincerity to the boundless heavens, silently borne my devotion through endless nights. The Most True has ever been my witness, and every prayer has been granted.

Yet, entangled in manifold affairs, I have been unable to repay the divine grace. I have long resolved to purify myself, hoping to inaugurate this offering. Now, Heaven has heeded my deepest yearnings, and the gods have aligned with my long-held wishes. By fortunate appointment, I find myself within the jade precincts of the immortal realm, in the very shadow of the jeweled capital, amidst the mist-laden verdure and towering walls of this city.

Moreover, as this is my life-renewal day, coinciding with the autumn season, I have been able to personally ascend the pine and cypress heights, treading deep into the clouds and mist. I have performed the rites of the Three Offerings with due solemnity, fulfilling my official duties, while also discharging the prayers of accumulated years and realizing my private devotions. In reviewing my duties and reflecting on my heart, I am both honored and overjoyed.

Thus, I dare to present this memorial with reverence, preparing incense and lamps. Though the humble offerings of mountain herbs and rainwater are unworthy to move the sagely gaze, by the virtue of responding to sincerity and seizing the moment, I pray that my foolish devotion may be received.

I hope to repay the grace of the past and await the blessings of the future. Grant me auspicious fortune and secure well-being. May the county be free from peril, the harvests abundant, the people harmonious, and customs prosperous. May near and far dwell in peace.

If your servant’s life is afflicted by clashes in the Five Phases, or if the Nine Luminaries of Heaven’s pattern traverse inauspicious paths; if governance has been unclear, or rewards and punishments misapplied; if new grievances or old debts, past killings or unintended harms remain, I beg that they all be swept away, and that eternal grace and protection be bestowed. I am prostrate and unable to contain myself.

**Memorial for the Life-Renewal Offering of Attendant Gentleman Sun Tu**

We humbly acknowledge that the Two Qi first divided, and the Five Phases set in motion. They beat the bellows of yin and yang, and hold the pivot of life and death. They nurture all without partiality, shaping and harmonizing without weariness. They govern longevity and brevity under the Five Emperors, and assess good and evil before the Three Officials. The Northern Dipper holds its exalted station, presiding over all beings.

Your servant, though obscure and unworthy, has received the grace of your shaping power. Clad in cap and gown, I have ever feared my undeserved position. Following the luminous teachings of the plain scholars and upholding the model words of the mysterious sages, I still fear that my every movement may err, and my conduct may stray from the Dao. It is difficult to ascend to good fortune, yet easy to accumulate faults.

Moreover, I dread the shifting of the Three Paths, lest I encounter misfortune when the Nine Luminaries traverse inauspicious positions. This year, the Celestial Talisman descends upon the direction of the Hook and Strangler, and my minor fortune coincides with the position of the Hidden Chant. Among the Thirteen Mansions, the Moon’s Comet has passed; in my great fortune and life-year, I still dwell in clash and break.

With such apprehensions, I fear to tread upon misfortune. Thus, on this day of my life-renewal, I dare to earnestly present this offering in repentance. I pray that the Perfected Sages deign to look upon my sincere prayers. Pardon past sins and dissolve grievances; bestow future blessings, increase my emoluments, and prolong my years. May my family be secure, and public and private affairs harmonious. I shall forever bear the boundless grace of the august assembly. I am prostrate and unable to contain myself.

*End of Scroll Nine of the* Guangcheng Collection
*Scroll Ten of the* Guangcheng Collection *begins*

**Memorial for the Ritual Offering Commanded by Vice Censor-in-Chief Li Chou**
Composed by Du Guangting, Grand Virtue of Literary Works for Imperial Service, Purple-Robed and Bestowed, of the Supreme Clarity Palace in the Upper Capital

We humbly observe that the Two Images mold and blend, the Three Origins engender and transform. They shape all beings and nurture the myriad regions. From the celestial treasury we receive our mandate and form; our lifespan’s brevity or length, our emoluments’ duration or transience—all are bound to it. In establishing oneself, one reaps the causes of sin or fortune; in traversing fate, one encounters the reckonings of good or ill. Heaven records and Earth examines, their governance impartial.

Your servant fears that in the Three Destinies and Five Phases, calamity may strike; that among the Nine Stars and Seven Luminaries, baleful influences may descend. Yin and Yang bear times of punishment and conflict; emoluments and fate meet with ominous decline. Moreover, we dread that transgressions accumulated over lifetimes remain unexpiated, that wrongs committed across generations still coil unresolved. Mortal understanding cannot fathom these, nor can the Dao of the gods be known. Without recourse to ritual supplication, there is no means of absolution. Thus, on this day of my life-renewal, I reverently prepare incense and lamps. Gazing upon the celestial patterns, I lay bare my heart; facing the star altar, I pour forth my sincerest pleas. Daring to hope that the Perfected Sages will deign to look upon my earnest devotion: may the Three Officials strike my name from the ledgers of sin, may the Five Emperors erase my entry from the registers of disaster. May past stains be scoured clean, long-standing grievances dissolved. May I be spared death in the Northern Palace and reborn beneath the Southern Culmen. May the Celestial Bureau augment my emoluments, may the Director of Destinies prolong my years. May my family dwell in harmony, public and private affairs in clarity and peace. I shall forever bear the boundless grace of the august assembly.

**Memorial for the Vow-Fulfilling Ritual Offering by Attendant Gentleman Zhang Daoheng**
We have heard that the celestial symbols hang from the Nine Heavens, their radiance streaming through the ten thousand beings. The Emperor’s Chariot wheels in its course, the sagely power reaching far and wide. It carves out the Four Seas without partiality, bestowing blessings upon all living things without dominion. Prayer is invariably answered; vows are surely fulfilled.

Your servant, in the second year of Great Favor, encountered peril and distress—my anxiety exceeded treading upon fire, my danger surpassed walking upon ice. Unable to secure safety from dawn to dusk, how dared I hope to preserve my body and life? With utmost sincerity, I poured forth my pleas, yet found no gate to voice my grievances. I could only fix my thoughts upon the azure vault and secretly beseech the Mystic Dipper. Silently, I vowed a great vow, hoping to redeem profound calamity. By good fortune, the Great Dao deigned to look upon me, the Perfected Ones responded to my entreaty. They extended the blessing of cherishing life, opened boundless grace. My sins were washed away, all grievances dispelled. Gazing upon Heaven’s mercy, my gratitude deepened; yet how could I repay the mysterious workings of creation?

Soon after, I was constrained by official duties, the journey affording no leisure. Years passed, my sincere vow unfulfilled. Moreover, as I traversed rivers and mountains, journeying back and forth, I repeatedly encountered disturbances and frequently faced hardship and peril. By good fortune, I escaped the clash of arms and evaded violent misfortune—all through the sheltering protection I received, which redoubled my reverence and gratitude.

Now, on this day of my life-renewal, at the Jade Bureau of Numinous Transformation, before the Hall of the Seven Origins of the Northern Dipper, in the presence of the Great Emperor of Mystic Eminence, I reverently prepare the ritual altar to fulfill my past vows. Formerly, I pledged an offering of *x* strings of cash, to be presented in five installments by the eighth month of this year. We humbly beseech the Perfected Ones of the Dipper’s midst, the high officials of the Mystic Bureau, to perceive our earnest devotion and graciously turn their boundless favor. May our long-standing vows be fully realized, may divine blessings widely bestow their grace. May sins be pardoned and disasters removed, may auspiciousness be extended and blessings conferred. May years and emoluments increase, may perils and distress be dissolved. May our families dwell in peace, public and private affairs in steadfast good fortune. We shall forever bear the covering protection of the Dipper’s august assembly.

**Memorial for the Scripture-Recitation and Ritual Offering for His Mother by Gentleman of the Ministry of Personnel, Zhou Xiang**
We have heard that the Three Caverns’ precious scriptures and the Nine Heavens’ true formulas, congealed in the void and blended with primordial *qi*, form their patterns. Dragon scripts and phoenix chapters trace their origins to the remotest beginnings; jade tablets and seals proclaim them before Heaven and Earth. In their greatness, they govern and order the cosmos, safeguard and stabilize the kalpas, secure the dynastic succession, and manifestly protect emperors. In their lesser aspects, they harmonize the Five Phases, regulate the Six *qi*, dispel evil and deliver from distress, benefiting beings and aiding humanity. Through cultivation, calamities may be dissolved; through recitation, auspiciousness may descend.

Your servants’ mother has entered a year of decline and distress, afflicted by illness and suffering. Our anxiety runs deep, yet we know not where to turn for supplication. Daring to rely upon the Perfected Sages, we lay bare our sincerest hearts. We humbly pray that the Three Treasures’ mighty spirits will command the attendants of the scripture bureau to resolve the conflicts of the Five Phases and avert the ominous decline of the Three Destinies. May emoluments be augmented in the Southern Heaven, may life be prolonged in the Director’s register. May the Six Palaces be regulated, all ailments healed. May we forever receive the covering protection of their grace and enjoy the blessings of long life.

Respectfully, at the Jade Bureau of Transformation, we recite scriptures and perform the ritual offering, secretly knocking upon the gates of the Perfected Ones.

**Memorial for the Life-Renewal Ritual Offering on the Jiazi Day for Vice Commissioner of Pacification Zhang Lin by Mo Ting**
Your servant has heard that the Dao of Heaven is impartial, aiding those who possess virtue. When merit extends to beings, blessings know no limit.

Vice Commissioner of Pacification for the Chuan Circuit, Zhang Lin, serves his lord without partiality, repays knowledge with utmost loyalty. His resolve remains unwavering from beginning to end, steadfast through wind and rain; his plans are manifold, growing ever more vigorous with the passing of seasons and the chill of winter.

At present, the four frontiers lie in turmoil, and the two garrisons stand embattled. The mobilization of arms has drained resources, while expenditures swell beyond measure. Heavy levies would surely plight the people, yet light taxes cannot meet the demands of supply. Through sagacious counsel, he has ensured the army’s provisions are abundant—grain piled high as mountains, weapons and armor massed like clouds. No man complains of toil, no matter is left unaddressed. Thus has he bolstered the might of our forces, poised to achieve the triumph of punitive justice.

Yet Vice Commissioner Zhang’s Three Life-spans still encounter misfortune; within his Two Cycles, the qi of his Jia-year fate and official salary wanes. The Celestial Talisman descends upon his Palace of Destiny, while Saturn retrogrades into his House of Sorrow. Fearing these portents of calamity, I have exhausted my sincerity in prayer, entrusting my plea to the imperial altar, and humbly beseech divine aid. May the Ten Flowers bestow blessings, may the Three Saints turn their radiance toward him. Let the gods of the heavens grant their benevolent gifts, that disasters naturally cease; let the Nine Bureaus absolve his transgressions, that his official salary and lifespan be extended. May he forever enjoy peace, and together with the realm, secure the frontier’s tranquility.

With utmost urgency and reverence, I dare not overstep, yet my devotion compels me.

**Prayer for the Ritual Offering by General Luo**
I humbly observe that the dual qi, pure and congealed, manifest the Dao of Heaven and Earth’s flourishing integrity; the Five Agents, interdependent, bear the grace of Qian and Kun’s nurturing power. As for the length of one’s life-record, the abundance of one’s official salary, the sins and fortunes of one’s conduct, and the auspices and misfortunes of one’s fate—none escape the oversight of the celestial bureaus or the influence of one’s primordial destiny. All is governed, examined, and recorded, great and small alike.

I privately fear that the constellations and Five Phases, in their celestial courses, may bring ill omens through their conjunctions; that the Nine Palaces and Three Life-spans, in their interplay of yin and yang, may coincide with perilous junctures. Thus do I tremble with apprehension, lest calamity take root.

Now, on this propitious day of the Beginning of Winter, I offer my prayers with utmost sincerity, meticulously performing the ritual offering. Gazing upward, I earnestly beseech; looking toward the earthly realms, I concentrate my mind. I await the descent of benevolence, the bestowal of boundless fortune. May misfortunes and disasters be eradicated, may transgressions and faults be absolved. Grant him auspicious omens, augment his lifespan and salary. Let his sins be stricken from the Northern Bureau’s ledgers, and his life-record inscribed in the Southern Prosperity’s registers. May his family, both seen and unseen, dwell in peace. May he soar upon the celestial paths, ever basking in the light of sun and moon; may he rest within the mortal realm, forever sheltered by the true spirits’ protection.

With reverence, I dare not presume further.

Humbly I have heard that the celestial patterns shift and turn, cycling through the Three Origins to complete the year; the transformations of yin and yang draw upon the Dao of Heaven to manifest their works. The blessings of moisture extend to both the seen and unseen realms, their principles constant across past and present. Those who magnify benevolence and uphold righteousness, who embody harmony and radiate concord, receive from Heaven auspicious omens, and the spirits manifest their felicitous favor. Yet if one’s conduct strays from vigilance and caution, if one’s will aligns with perversity and deceit, one treads the path of hardship and peril, foreshadowing obstruction and adversity. The principle of retribution—swift as echo follows sound—stands resplendently clear.

I, by contrast, am but a mediocre and unworthy man, long since burdened with official rank and emolument. Though I strive to maintain solemn reverence and advance with awe and sincerity, I constantly harbor the fear of being mocked as a snipe clashing with a clam, and ever dread the reproach of the greedy cormorant. Moreover, I am charged with disciplining the ranks of soldiers, dutifully guarding the frontier walls. Blades and arrows remain in use, the roll of drums has yet to cease. Crushing the strong and blunting the sharp, I merely execute the strategies of capture and suppression; yet in the course of battle, unintended killing and mistaken harm may give rise to grievances and hidden resentments. Such thoughts weigh heavily upon me, deeply occupying my mind.

Now, as the Autumn Emperor reviews merits and the Earth Official examines the registers, every transgression and blessing is raised, no detail—however minute—left unrecorded. If I have committed faults of presumption or negligence, errors of killing or wounding, offenses of the six emotions, or guilt of the three karmic actions; if there remain unresolved lawsuits or unredressed enmities—my deeds inscribed in the Black Ledgers, my name recorded in the Courts of Darkness—I beseech that a path of repentance and absolution be granted, and that the grace of remission and dissolution be bestowed. May I thus be enabled to exert myself and renew my conduct.

As for the baleful stars that cast their misfortune, the inauspicious years that bring calamity, I likewise pray for deliverance, that I may be preserved in peace and security. Above all, I entreat for my nine generations of ancestors, that they ascend to the Three Realms of Heaven. May they escape suffering and transcend the depths, fulfilling their nature and flourishing in life. May the weapons of war in the four directions be swiftly sheathed, and the myriad households soon return to the peace of plowing and weaving. May the common folk’s songs and chants resound, and the wilderness be stilled of dust and turmoil. May all return to the winds of purity and stillness, and the great Dao of the Inaudible and Invisible be universally realized.

With utmost reverence, I prepare the libation and offering, earnestly presenting this memorial. From afar, I invoke the immortal altar, gazing upward in hope of true protection.

I dare not presume further.

Memorial for the Life-Rite of Minister Ma

I, in my mediocrity and insignificance, have presumptuously received the favor of destiny, mistakenly occupying a position of rank and inheriting the honors of office. Commanding the war chariots, I carry out the statutes and decrees. At times, I succeed in pacifying towns and cities, sweeping away the treacherous and wicked. Externally, I repel invaders and foes; internally, I soothe the weary and afflicted. Yet when feasting guests and rewarding troops, the slaughter of livestock is unavoidable. In eradicating corruption and punishing evil, reliance upon penal laws is essential. Though my actions are not self-serving but aimed at securing the people’s peace, I privately fear that in the moments of sentencing and execution, errors in severity or leniency may occur; in the throes of killing and wounding, the line between intent and accident may blur. Such anxieties fill me with trepidation, lest I incur divine censure.

Moreover, I worry that in the cyclical years of my life, I may encounter inauspicious declines; that the five stars of my natal chart may be afflicted by baleful conjunctions. Should such calamitous alignments occur, I may yet fall into peril and danger. I further fear that my nine generations of ancestors, still dwelling in the shadows, have not been delivered; that my six relations, bound by lingering attachments, remain confined. Contemplating the long night of the underworld, my soul trembles; reflecting upon the gates of darkness, my heart quails.

Yearning to express my most earnest devotion, I lift my sincerest offerings in supplication. Relying upon the hour of my birth, I prepare the full measure of purifying incense. With mind attuned to the numinous transformation, I envision the distant sacred altar. I present the ritual offering with solemn reverence, and proffer this memorial in fervent prayer.

I humbly implore that the Primordial Origin bestow its protection, that the Great Dao extend its compassion. May the radiance illuminate the courts of the Yellow Springs, and decrees descend from the palaces of Fengdu. May the Nine Ancestral Spirits be delivered, and all sufferings dissolved. May they ascend to the Azure Heavens of the Living Spirits, and shed their forms in the Vermilion Caverns of the Immortals. May blessings extend to descendants, and grace embrace the clan.

For all past transgressions and endless grievances, may they all receive the cleansing of repentance and be restored to harmony. I beseech that my sins be stricken from the records, and my name inscribed in the registers of life. May disasters and misfortunes be quelled, and my allotted span of fortune and emolument be prolonged.

Furthermore, I pray that blessings flow to the rivers and springs, and that grace extend near and far. May weapons of war be swiftly laid down, and pestilence and disease vanish. May the fields return to plowing and mulberry cultivation, and the people attain wealth and longevity. Even unto the hidden and obscure beings of the deep, the distant and estranged realms of the vast, may all together bathe in the winds of the Mysterious, and ascend to the domains of the Dao.

I vow with utmost sincerity to forever uphold this boundless compassion.

I dare not presume further.

Memorial for the Rite at Mount Qingcheng

I humbly observe that as the vast qi gradually congeals, the myriad mountains rise in majestic splendor. Loftily supporting the celestial pole, they firmly stabilize the earthly realm.

Memorial for the Rite at Mount Qingcheng

In that southwestern realm, its heights reach the stars of Shen and Jing. Gathering numinous essence and amassing auspiciousness, it cradles the radiance of sun and moon; layered emerald peaks and piled mists enfold the abodes of immortals. Its rank surpasses all sacred peaks, its bounty second only to the Three Isles. As the felicitous court of all under heaven, it crowns the finest landscapes of the realm. Towering terraces stand in array, where the secret traces of the Yellow Emperor’s chariot yet remain; vast waters branch beside it, where the divine works of Great Yu may still be witnessed. Ever manifesting its responsive signs, it shelters the living.

Of late, rains have lingered beyond ten days, and springs surge forth in tumult. Though red cliffs and verdant ridges echo with tales of collapse, the vermilion halls and crimson pavilions remain untouched by calamity or alarm. Such manifold marvels further attest to its luminous power.

I, undeserving, have been laden with extraordinary favor, entrusted with this weighty charge. My governance has yet to bring peace, and my anxious devotion runs deep. I fear my own transgressions may have summoned these unusual portents from the immortal peaks; that encroaching misfortune may have drawn forth these warnings from the divine summits. Day and night, I examine myself, as though perched upon ice or embers. With no path to lay bare my heart, I can only offer the utmost sincerity in prayer and repentance.

Thus, in accordance with the sacred statutes, I reverently present this grand rite, humbly beseeching your gaze and protection, that my faults may be redeemed.

I dare not presume further.

Memorial for the Life-Span Rite by Minister Ma

I have heard that as the primordial transformation unfolds, the Three Powers draw upon its origin. Embodying heaven and earth, it forms all images; moved by its nurturing warmth, spirits coalesce. Hence, the register of life hangs at the Celestial Gate, and the threads of existence are tied to the Dipper’s pivot. Every action, great or small, every gesture, fine or subtle—none escapes the watchful gaze of the Eight Spirits, nor the exhaustive scrutiny of the Ten Rectifiers. Good deeds, though hidden, inscribe one’s name among the immortals; transgressions, once noted, consign one to the ledgers of the dead. Through such rewards and punishments, humanity is guided.

Above all, the Life-Span Deity presides over the recording and judgment of these accounts. Reflecting upon its profound decree, I am compelled to cultivate myself with earnestness.

I, unworthy and insignificant, possess no cunning strategy. I have only served with integrity, offering my life for the times. Yet my labors remain unfulfilled, and I am burdened by the weight of my inadequacy. Fear and humility grow within me, even as my responsibilities deepen.

Moreover, in the aftermath of war within the capital’s precincts and the abandonment of fields, the weary have not recovered, and wounds remain unhealed. To soothe them is like offering dew from my lips; to agitate them risks flooding the ditches. Yet I have been suddenly tasked with overseeing six districts, tending to the three labors of agriculture. Whether toiling in summer’s heat or winter’s cold, though human effort is strained, the harvest still depends on heaven’s timing.

Thus, I pour forth my sincerest devotion, gazing upward in prayer for divine aid. On this day of my life-span rite, I dare to reverently present this offering of repentance. May the true sages deign to look upon me, and may blessings gather abundantly. Pardon my presumption in holding office, and reward my earnest devotion. Let weapons be swiftly stilled, and granaries overflow. May the people be spared the suffering of pestilence, and the land freed from the dread of flood and drought.

May my nine generations of ancestors ascend beyond, and the Three Realms be cleansed of turmoil. Should the stars portend misfortune, or the years bring calamity; should unjust punishments or reckless rewards mar my rule, or unintended harm befall others—may all such faults be illuminated and forgiven, universally absolved. I vow eternal devotion, in gratitude for your true grace.

I dare not presume further.

A Memorial Prayer for the Benming Rite at Green City’s Mo Courtyard

I prostrate myself, reflecting: born of qi and shaped in form, I depend entirely upon the mysterious transformation of the Dao. My allotted span and destined emolument are ordained by the true courts on high. Yet I fear that in the course of my conduct I may incur faults and transgressions, or that within the cycle of years I may encounter misfortune and calamity. Without the power of the gods, repentance and purification cannot be achieved. Thus I presume to address the true mirror of heaven, reverently preparing the rites of offering.

This mountain is the supreme seat of the Five Peaks and the Four Waterways, a blessed land of immortals. Within its caverns stand jade towers and golden palaces, hidden from the profane world; below lie ancient halls and ruined terraces, their traces ever shifting. Beams collapse like broken rainbows, tiles scatter like paired mandarin ducks. Were no effort made to repair them, the paths would soon be overgrown with weeds.

I, unworthy, hold office here and have undertaken their restoration. Having completed the work, I now present its adornments: images of the Five Peaks and Nine Rivers are depicted, the true forms of the River Earl and the Stream Maidens rendered, their regal crowns solemn and majestic, pearls and jades arrayed in splendor. It is as though one ascends the shell-paved towers of the immortals, or draws near the jeweled palace of the dragon. The white walls now gleam with radiance, and the mysterious virtue of the gods is all the more revered.

May the celestial precincts of this lesser city forever rely upon such blessings. In autumn’s gratitude and spring’s prayers, may we ever receive their gracious favor.

On this day of my original destiny, I humbly prepare a feast of praise and invocation. I implore the gods to turn their chariots in response, to send down their divine grace. Bestow upon me the extension of my allotted span and emolument, and aid me in averting misfortune and calamity. May the kin of both realms enjoy peace, and the cattle and people of this land thrive in tranquility.

I vow to pour forth my sincerity, to repay your boundless compassion. I dare not presume further.

**Jiao Petition of Mo Tingyi on the Jia-Shen Day of His Original Destiny at Mount Qingcheng**

I have heard that the wondrous origin responds to its time, and the primordial essence initiates its course. The Three Luminaries divide their radiance, and the myriad beings are shaped in form. Between the round and pure above and the square and turbid below, they alternately serve as hosts and guests; within the realm of the sun and the paths of the stars, each fulfills its appointed office. In great matters, they govern kalpas and unfold the cosmic pattern; in small, they scrutinize the good and evil of human conduct. Their discernment surpasses the balance and mirror, and no blade’s edge or hair’s tip escapes their notice.

I humbly consider that the Nine-Chambered Grotto-Heaven is the assembly hall of the host of perfected beings, where cinnabar cliffs reflect the sun and emerald valleys yawn to the clouds. It is the place where phoenix banners come and go, and where rainbow standards gather. Though I have presumptuously received the charge of governing this land and have been permitted to approach these immortal mountains, I have consumed only coarse fare to discipline my heart and drunk icy waters to purify myself. Yet my merits have failed to compensate for my shortcomings, and my transgressions must surely be known. How, then, in this proximate presence, dare I deceive the gaze of the perfected immortals?

Moreover, I fear that as the Nine Celestial Bodies proceed in their courses and the Three Destinies shift, fortune and goodness may not endure, while calamity and misfortune remain unfathomable. With earnest and trembling sincerity, as if treading upon perilous ground, I now, on the day of my original destiny, renew the rites of prayer and jiao offering. To the celestial thoroughfares and earthly expanses, to the water palaces and stellar abodes, I present my utmost sincerity, lifting my gaze to implore luminous protection.

I humbly beseech that disasters be dissolved and transgressions absolved, that blessings be extended and auspices bestowed. May my span of life and emolument only increase, and may misfortune and peril naturally cease. For those departed, may the Nine Mysteries open the way to deliverance; for those living, may the two realms enjoy peace. May all beings within this domain together receive the shade of fortune. May the war chariots rest their steeds, and may the frontier regions know no anxiety. May I long rejoice in the era of tranquility and forever bear the grace of the numinous perfected.

I dare not presume further.

**Jiao Petition of Mo Tingyi to the Nine Luminaries**

I have observed that the Two Images divide their splendor, and the Three Origins array the luminaries. They govern the covenants of remorse and fortune, of good and ill, and hold sway over life and death, sin and blessing. Their dominion leaves nothing unmastered, and both the hidden and the manifest are bound to their decree.

I, though dull and common, have long revered the true and orthodox. Presumptuously bearing the favor of imperial insignia, I have been granted rank and emolument. Ever mindful of the bounds of my office, I have feared neglecting my duties; in caring for the people and pacifying the realm, I have not dared to forget self-discipline. Yet I still worry that my actions may stray from reverence and caution, that my daily faults and flaws may accumulate, offending the numinous spirits and covertly inviting adversity.

I further fear the advance and retreat of the Five Planets and the movements of the Four Luminaries. Should they reside in the palace of my life and destiny, or alight upon positions of weakness and ill fortune—this year, the Celestial Talisman descends upon my life trigram, while Jupiter has not yet emerged from my natal palace. Among the twenty-eight lunar mansions, the eclipse spirit traverses its path, and my minor destiny aligns with the Celestial Net. Privately, I fret that fortune may turn to calamity, and that my destiny may wane while my emolument dwindles.

According to the inner ranks of the *River Chart* and the secret texts of the *Grand Mystery*, I pour forth my earnest entreaty, laying bare my heart in full ritual observance. Gazing toward the resplendent gates of the Canopy of Flowers, I stand as if before the Nine Rays; beholding the palaces of the stars, the sun, and the moon, I empty my sincerity in crimson devotion.

I humbly implore that the radiance of the celestial throne may descend to illuminate the dark and murky, dispelling obscurity; that the divine light may extend its brilliance, shattering the chariot of misfortune and burning away the net of sin. May my years be preserved, and my rank and office ascend. May the people of this domain enjoy health and peace, and may the kin of both realms know safety and prosperity. May the immortal mountains bestow their favor, and may no pestilence harm the people; may the numinous precincts grant their auspices, and may the year bring the hope of abundant harvests.

With pure and earnest sincerity, I seek to repay the profound merit of the Dao.

I dare not presume further.

**Jiao Petition of Lord of the River to the Northern Emperor**

I have observed that the Seven Governors hold supreme authority, and the Five Numinous Elders preside in mystery. Their positions command the Northern Culmen, and their jurisdiction extends over the central heavens. From the fortunes and misfortunes of earthly regions to the calamities and blessings of celestial patterns, from the Five Phases and Six Qi to the Three Destinies and Nine Palaces, the weal and woe of all things are subject to their scrutiny and judgment.

For years, warfare has raged, and the people have suffered devastation. The pain of their plight pierces my flesh and bones. Thus, I dare to present this jiao offering, pouring forth my prayers in full devotion. With earnest sincerity, I knock upon the gates of the Purple Tenuity and lay bare my heart before the celestial patterns. Truly, I hope for compassionate regard and the descent of auspicious blessings. May the noxious qi be dispelled from the plains and fields, and may the baleful stars retreat from the asterisms of the well and net.

May this riverine land know peace and prosperity, and may all things flourish anew. May the weapons of war be sheathed forever, and may my allotted span be renewed. May the mists of the Nine Heavens part, revealing once more the light of the sun and moon; may the smoke over the Three Shu clear, and may the blessings of clouds and thunder be bestowed anew.

I now reverently bear the Emperor’s mercy and protection.

I dare not presume further.

**Jiao Petition of Lord of the River to the Empress of the Zhou, Earthly Deities, and All Gods**

I have observed that this is a renowned precinct of the celestial domain, a sacred tract of the lesser city. It is a blessed land of dragon spirits, a mighty bulwark of the Celestial Emperor.

Though I am but a humble and insignificant being, I have been entrusted with the governance of this land, and by some misfortune, I have been charged with the stewardship of this domain. For ten years now, I have lived in daily trepidation. Yet from the moment I first assumed this duty, I was met with hardship. The Yellow Turbans rose against Qin, and the imperial carriage fled to Shu, where the wandering court of ten thousand souls remained for five years. Exhausting all strength to uphold the heavens, my devotion to the realm ran deep, and my efforts in restoring order bore fruit. Even upon the imperial return, rebellion flared—Shi Li raised arms, and Gan Neng seized the moment. Xiu Sheng amassed forces at the lower rapids, while Guo Qi rallied in the heart of the army. The imperial carriage stood but a short distance away, yet the shock of battle shook its wheels. By the sagacious might of the throne and the borrowed power of the gods, these threats were quelled in succession, securing the great chariot’s safety. Moved by such divine aid, I have ever held this gratitude in my heart.

Now, however, the times remain unsettled, and men give free rein to chaos. The Emperor’s Chariot moves once more toward Chen Cang. The Central Plains burn with the fires of war, and the Six Directions know no peace. Though my heart aches with concern for the realm and my resolve to aid the sovereign is unshaken, I cannot offer the loyalty of Ji Shao, for mountains and rivers divide us; nor can I shed the tears of Yuan An, for I have no means to attend the imperial guard. In distant reverence of the gods’ power, I trust they will grant their saving grace. Thus, I present this jiao offering, humbly beseeching divine communion. May the grace of aiding the right prevail, and may the celestial pace be steadied; may the force that curbs excess be lent, and may the roots of evil be swept far away. May the imperial carriage return to the capital above, and may the precious mandate endure for ten thousand generations. With libations of peppered wine, I forever repay this radiant mercy.

I dare not presume further in my earnest entreaty, laying bare my heart in utmost devotion.

**Jiao Petition to Mount Ge the Transformed**

This immortal mountain stands as a pillar of the earth. Its eighty-one grottoes divide the sun and moon within the land; its twenty-four peaks weave mist and rosy clouds at heaven’s edge. It silently governs the balance of sin and fortune, overseeing all living beings. From my earliest days, I have revered the mysteries of the Dao and long cherished purity and stillness. In this era of sagely rule, I have been honored with a role in its flourishing; in dreams, I have wandered the sacred peaks, ever holding the aspiration for freedom. Yet worldly affairs have weighed heavily upon me, stifling my true longings. Now, as the season turns to mid-autumn and the rites of the full moon approach, I gaze afar at the emerald peaks, distant beyond the red dust. With reverence, I prepare the jiao altar to offer my sincere prayers. May the tiger banners and dragon pennants depart from the palaces of the Eight Extremes; may the crane-drawn and swan-borne chariots descend, if only briefly, from the carriages of the Three Immortals. Accepting this modest offering, bestow upon us extraordinary blessings: let the harvests be bountiful, let calamities cease, let the unseen and the seen alike share in fortune, and let both household and state know peace. May the imperial destiny rise like a lofty ridge, and may the years of Tang endure beyond the cycles of kalpas. I vow to maintain purity and devotion in service of the divine radiance.

I dare not presume further.

**Jiao Petition to the Nine Stars of the River Lord**

I have heard that the Nine Origins govern the pole, arraying the constellations within the Purple Tenuity; the Seven Governors shed their light, guiding the host of stars along the Yellow Way. They point to the Celestial Handle to oversee all phenomena and turn the Big Dipper to rule the hundred spirits. Life and death, fortune and misfortune—all are subject to their governance. At the time of my birth, in this very month, Mars and the dark stars of the Dipper’s handle converged upon my fate. Trembling with dread, I fear the onset of disaster. With crimson sincerity, I humbly beseech their divine protection. Reverently, I conduct this great jiao, pouring forth the depths of my heart. May the Nine Sages extend their compassion, descending in the Emperor’s Chariot to grant blessings; may the Seven Perfected bestow their favor, turning the Dipper’s handle to dispel calamity. May the movements of the Twenty-Eight Lodges bring forth auspicious fortune, and may the divisions of the Twelve Palaces forever still their troubles. I pledge my loyal and steadfast heart in gratitude for the divine beings’ regard.

I dare not presume further.

**Jiao Petition for the Harmony of the Zhou Heavens**

Though I am unworthy and base, I have been burdened with great responsibility. Elevated to the heights of the imperial terrace and stationed in the lofty bastion of the frontier, I have poured forth my heart like one who holds the sun in devotion, yet I have achieved no merit in aiding the sovereign. Of late, the four frontiers bristle with ramparts, and the Central Kingdom knows no peace. Warhorses gallop unceasingly, and chariots remain harnessed. Some among the inner court have turned traitor, while distant lords have betrayed their grace. No sooner was the nest of the owl destroyed and the imperial carriage returned than news of punitive campaigns arose, compelling another imperial progress. As a subject, how can I not burn with indignation? In silent meditation, I burn incense and yearn for the blessings left by the sagely ancestors; in prostration, I present petitions and await the aid of the unseen hosts. Indeed, the false king and his vile ministers were beheaded in succession; the treacherous general Zhu Zhi met his end in swift succession. In distant reflection of this hidden support, my sincerity deepens. Recently, the Great Unity has traversed the heavens, its light now shining upon Shu’s domain. The Five Planets shift their courses, some entering the palace of my fate. Fearing that my meager virtue has invited misfortune, I dread the onset of further calamities. Ever vigilant, I dare not rest in complacency.

Thus arose Zheng Junxiong and Han Qiu, who conspired across two lands and swiftly raised arms. They severed all bonds of grace and trust, violating the defenses we had heard of. They ravaged the living, burned commanderies and towns, leaving several provinces in ashes and a thousand li scarred. Moved by this hidden grievance, my pain cuts to the bone. Therefore, I ascended to beseech the Supreme Dao and openly prayed to the true spirits—not for my own sake or my household, but with a heart that ever grieves for state and people. Thereupon, Heaven repented its calamity, and the Great Dao bestowed its numen. Those who harbored treachery were soon eradicated; their adherents, all swept away. The frontiers grew still again, and the ravaged lands began to heal. Han Qiu perished in defeat, and Junxiong was beheaded like an owl. Roads gradually reopened, and long-buried wrongs neared redress.

Yet in this season of reaping, the slain were not few. Gazing upward, I recall the decree of cherishing life—how can I rest easy in such sorrow? Looking down, I mourn the souls wandering Mount Tai, their desolation unending. Thus, I compose my spirit, knock in stillness, bow in reverence, and turn my heart homeward. I perform rites of gratitude and repentance, pouring out my earnest prayers to Earth and Heaven. May the Mystic Sages, in their boundless grace, look kindly upon my sincerity. May their radiance illumine the sacred altar, their vast blessings flow forth, washing away transgressions and quelling disasters. May the living enjoy peace, and the hidden paths open to prosperity.

I have further heard that all stars bow to the Pole, and the hundred grains pay homage to their source. Yet these rebels, defiant of court and Heaven’s Dao, still fester near our borders, stretching across several provinces. Their mountain strongholds stand in sight, long havens for the wicked. Like swarming bees or gathering ants, they rally with hoes and staves. For twenty years, they have spurned the enlightened transformation. Seizing the moment when the waters brim over, I shall break them like bamboo. For the state, I shall punish the treacherous; for the people, I shall remove their scourge. I humbly implore divine power to amplify our martial might.

The Underworld commands thirty thousand troops, ever dispelling pestilent qi; the Grotto Springs host twenty-five generals who suppress the usurping fiends. The true Dao smites the perverse, and the gods aid the righteous. Embracing this decree, I once more pour forth my red heart. I prostrate myself, trusting that Your August Brilliance will deign to heed my petition and turn back to grant Your luminous protection.

May the lands of Chang, Lu, and Zi flourish, forever free from the scourge of serpents and boars. May the grasses, trees, and thickets all transform into the forms of blades and spears. Let all know the power of imperial might, and let the people’s songs once more extol the king. Thereafter, we shall reward the turtle-walled city, present our memorial at the phoenix towers, sheathe our bows, and unarmor our troops, returning horses to pasture and oxen to rest. May the harmony of fish and water endure, and the Dao of ruler and minister flow unimpeded. With utmost sincerity and blood-deep earnestness, may the great Dao bear witness. Unable to contain my reverent plea for grace, I prostrate myself in trembling devotion.

*Here ends Volume Ten of the* **Guangcheng Collection**
*Volume Eleven of the* **Guangcheng Collection**
*Composed by Du Guangting, Grand Master of Imperial Edicts, Purple-Robed Master of the Inner Offerings at the Supreme Clarity Palace in the Upper Capital*
*Memorial for the Water Bureau: Prayer for the Repair of the Weir*

I have heard that the great Dao bestows its works, shaping and perfecting all things. The true spirits establish their stations, governing all living beings. As for the luminous deities of the water bureaus and the rightful overseers of mountains and forests, each administers reward and punishment to shelter the multitudes. This county commands the upper reaches, long renowned as a bustling prefecture. Its tax burdens are heavy, and its farming and planting abundant. The weirs it guards are tied to its safety and peril.

The weir I oversee lies along those rushing currents. Since the floods began, it has repeatedly collapsed. Though we labor day and night, exhausting our strength and hearts, repairs are swiftly undone, and collapses soon follow. Is this the natural course of the water’s veins, beyond all prevention? Or is it the work of dragon spirits, resisting all obstruction? Anxious and desperate, I have nowhere to turn for aid.

Moreover, food is the sky of the people, and the people are the foundation of the state. Should the autumn harvest falter, famine will surely follow. This fertile land of the celestial storehouse borders the lower rapids, while the households of the lesser city adjoin its flowing waters. If inundation strikes, the silt and sand will shift. To save those drowning in these waters, we must rely on divine power.

I humbly implore the great Dao to extend its grace, the radiant spirits to cast their gaze, pitying the farmlands and considering the lives of the people. Turn your unfathomable divine work and lend your impartial sagely power. Bestow your aid and protection, that we may attain safety. Let millet and grain flourish forever, and the granaries of the capital overflow with hope. Avert the calamity of rising waters and submerged hills, and align this year with an era of abundance and prosperity. With offerings of duckweed and pondgrass, I dare not betray your divine favor.

*Memorial for the Five Talismanic Stones of the River Lord*

The Three Treasures radiate their light, and the Five Scripts nurture transformation. They condense the qi of water, fire, wood, and metal, forming the writings of clouds, mist, dragons, and phoenixes. They safeguard the cosmos and stabilize heaven and earth. Since their descent to the mortal realm, they have protected and aided all living beings. Yu the Great used them to achieve success, and Confucius revered them in song. No household or state fails to honor and practice them.

Thus, they are employed to subdue spirits and deities, pacify mountains and rivers, dispel pestilent qi, and purify palaces and cities. Even the construction of dwellings falls within their purview of warding and pacification. Recently, within my jurisdiction, I oversaw the building of a new residence. Having completed this great task, I now conduct a grand offering. Following the standards of the *River Chart* and the rites of the *Numinous Treasure*, I have inscribed the true talismans and maintained the sacred incense and fire.

I hope thereby to dissolve transgressions, summon the proper spirits, and invoke the divine officials to grant eternal protection. I humbly beseech the Primordial One to witness and bless, and the host of sages to extend their compassion. Command your offices to bestow their auspicious favor. May my dwelling and kin know peace and health.

This place lies near the celestial region of the Great Fire, and my own palace of destiny may face its influence. With trepidation, I examine my heart and find myself shaken and fearful. Thus, I gaze upon the mountain of fortune in my life’s destiny and look up to the transformations of the immortals. Through the Three Primes, I offer prayers, and to the Nine Luminaries, I present my devout pleas.

I humbly implore the divine perfected of the grotto heavens, the attendants of the incense halls, and the august sages of the Dark Heaven to descend with their blessings. Grant me your resplendent favor and talismanic signs, and dissolve the disasters and calamities that mark my fate. May I receive your protection and truly attain peace and well-being.

Above, I pray for the imperial enterprise to match the heavens, the sagely plan to stabilize the mountains, the Yi and Luo rivers to herald a revival of the realm, and the eight waters and three mountains to harmonize with radiant prosperity. May weapons be sheathed across the nine wilds, and may all under heaven share a common culture and governance. May I be inspired to steadfast loyalty, forever supporting the wise and sagely ruler. Unable to contain my devotion, I prostrate myself.

A Memorial Prayer by the King of Shu for the Lunar Eclipse in His Life Palace at the Jade Bureau’s Ritual of Transformation

I have heard that the great Dao, in its boundless numinosity, initiates transformation through primordial harmony. It illumines the Three Luminaries in the heavens above and governs the six qi in the midst of the sky. Dispensing the power of nurturing and fostering all things, none fail to flourish; wielding the handle of cold and heat, warmth and coolness, no governance is unequal. Thus do the Five Planets bear the talismans of the Great Emperor, adjudging merit and fault; the Ten Spirits execute the decrees of the Great Unity, presiding over fortune and misfortune. The celestial stems and earthly branches admit no deception, for they are the foundation of all ages.

I, your servant, have encountered this sagely era and, though unworthy, am dusted with singular honor. My mountains and rivers command the might of the Well and Net constellations; my lands hold the weight of the earth’s cardinal corners. Yet I constantly fear that my fortune may exceed its measure, and truly dread the entanglement of calamity.

Now my virtue remains unrefined, and the Great Vault of Heaven issues its warning. At the new moon, the sun suffers partial eclipse in the region of opposition; at the full moon, the moon undergoes waning in the position of my Life Palace. The Flying Celestial Mars descends upon my fateful hour; the stem of my official rank and the tone of my natal sound both encounter the qi of decline. I fear that misfortune may take form, and my anxiety deepens.

Therefore, I follow the mysterious statutes, rousing my sincerity to utmost devotion. I offer fragrant oblations at the Jade Bureau and array the ritual of the libation altar. Gazing toward the Three Radiant Ones, I beseech their grace; praying across the entire heavens, I invoke blessings.

I humbly implore that your luminous presence deign to look upon me, that your divine resonance bestow favor. Grant auspicious signs to my Three Lives and Five Phases, and dissolve the calamities portended in the celestial field of my Life Palace. Any past injuries, accidental killings, karmic debts, or long-standing grievances—may all be absolved and forever rendered pure and fortunate.

Above, I pray that the imperial enterprise endure, that the sagely lifespan be prolonged. May the prosperity of Qin and the glory of the Great Han be restored, and may the dwelling at Luoyang rival the splendor of the ancestral Zhou. May weapons be laid down, and both Chinese and barbarians revive in harmony. May I pour forth my heart in service to the state and truly align with the protection of Heaven.

Unable to contain my fervent devotion, I prostrate myself in utmost reverence. Respectfully submitted.

**Prayer for the Pacification of a Dwelling**

I have heard that the qi of the Dao flows and spreads, giving rise to the division of the Three Powers. Yin and yang unfold the mechanisms of transformation, while water and wood initiate the images of mutual generation. The winds of nests and caves have now given way to the construction of dwellings. Thus, we cultivate the harmonious qi of the two forces and embody the Five Phases in our regulations. Truly, we rely upon the transformations of the spirits to shelter all living beings.

I, in my mediocrity and ignorance, fail to comprehend the profound principles. Following the times, I have undertaken renovations and, within my limited capacity, initiated construction. In the labor of earth and timber, I have observed no taboos; in the cutting and digging, I have caused great disturbance. Perhaps I have encroached upon the royal directions or violated the Dao of Heaven. As a result, the dragon spirits have not guarded their posts, and the dwelling is ill-suited. I fear that misfortune and decline press near, prolonging calamities and hardships.

With utmost sincerity, I turn my heart to the Great Dao, bow my head to the Three Honored Ones, and, following the luminous precepts of the *Lingbao*, perform the Grand Offering of the Five Emperors. Reverently, I confess and repent, prostrating to invoke the talismanic writ. I repent for past transgressions and offenses, praying for the blessings of future peace and tranquility.

I humbly beseech the Two Modes to bestow auspicious signs and the Five Emperors to grant good fortune. May all evil and misfortune be dispelled, and the dragon spirits firmly guard their posts. May the household enjoy purity and prosperity, and all movements be met with health and peace. May enterprises flourish and livelihoods thrive, ever receiving beneficial protection. May public and private affairs flow smoothly, and all kin and dependents live in safety.

Thus, I shall forever bear the grace of the Most High and the multitudes of honored ones, as well as the protection of the Five Emperors.

**Prayer for the Eight Seasonal Offerings**

I have heard that the Great Dao bestows its transformations, and the primordial qi shapes all forms. It forges the multitudes of beings, giving rise to distinctions of purity and turbidity, firmness and softness. It unfolds the eight seasonal nodes, fixing the directions of spring, autumn, winter, and summer. Thus, it examines and judges fortune and misfortune, overseeing the clarity of transgressions and blessings. Its benevolence extends throughout the state and the household, and its grace encompasses both the living and the dead.

We, your servants, have been fortunate to live in this flourishing era and have long revered the transformations of the Dao. We rely upon the power of the spirits for our nurturance and depend upon the sagely might for our cultivation. Yet, we fear that in dwelling among the common folk and establishing ourselves in the world, we may not be without faults. In past lives and the present existence, we must have accumulated flaws. Perhaps within the Five Phases and Three Lives, we have encountered inauspicious conjunctions; or beneath the dark and luminous stars, we have been subject to their influences. In such trepidation, we have resolved to seek solace through offerings.

Now, as we encounter this propitious season, we unite in utmost sincerity. This is the time when Heaven’s origin inaugurates the cycle, the day when the Great Sage extends his compassion. We lift our hearts to the numinous transformations, bow our heads at the jade altar, and, with pure incense and flowers, reverently present our offerings and prayers.

I humbly beseech the Most Exalted to witness and protect us, and the multitudes of sages to take pity. May they extend boundless compassion and bestow limitless blessings. May the sins and afflictions of past lives, the grievances of successive generations, past transgressions, and future misfortunes—through the power of renewal at the eight seasonal nodes and the grace of amnesty from the Three Palaces—all be swept away and forever granted purity and good fortune.

May we, your servants, along with our ninefold ancestors and sevenfold kin, receive blessings in the Southern Palace; and may our kin and relatives be freed from the records of death in the Northern Bureau. May public and private affairs harmonize, and may our lifespans and fortunes be long and distant.

Thus, we shall forever bear the grace of the multitudes of sages and their protection.

Memorial for the Grand Zhou Heavenly Rite of Offering

We humbly acknowledge that the Great Dao is all-pervading and harmonious, wherein all talents shine forth. As yin and yang rise and fall, the principles of good and ill fortune are thereby distinguished; as good and evil circulate in cycles, the texts of sin and blessing are thus revealed. The Jade Void Great Emperor and the Golden Portal Primordial Sovereign command the perfected spirits, bidding them to govern all. The Three Officials and Five Emperors preside over the bureaus of reward and reproof; the Southern Dipper and Northern Origin oversee the registers of life and death. Their mighty statutes are fully established, unerring through countless kalpas.

Thus, the cinnabar tablets and mysterious scriptures contain the secret arts of cultivation and expiation; the rites of praying to Heaven and repenting transgressions hold the luminous statutes of confession and purification. Gazing upward in reverence of their vast compassion, we dare to present our humble petition.

Your servant, having been favored by fate’s conjunction and born in an era of flourishing fortune, has—despite my common and unworthy nature—been graced with extraordinary favor. Reflecting upon my sojourn in this world, dwelling in purity while treading the turbid, serving my lord and honoring my parents, governing my household and correcting the realm, I have striven to uphold loyalty and integrity, laboring diligently in public service. Yet blessings have been elusive, while transgressions and errors readily accumulate.

Moreover, of late, while attending upon the imperial retinue, I have encountered times of hardship and sorrow. Rapacious rebels defied Heaven, and dark clouds obscured the sun. Auspicious vapors gathered only to shield the imperial chariot upon the layered crags, while demonic dust enshrouded the avenues of the capital in gloom. It was a moment when loyalty and righteousness demanded action, when a minister’s duty called for the offering of his life. Thus, I was able to grasp the Pivot of Heaven with my hands and stand firm against the leviathan’s waves, securing the imperial throne and exhausting my sincerest devotion. Thereupon, I was undeservedly granted exceptional favor and suddenly entrusted with weighty and perilous responsibilities—commanding encampments of valiant warriors across a thousand *li* of frontier lands. Ashamed of my lack of supervisory and pacifying abilities, I can only express my earnest trepidation.

I fear that in past lives, this present existence, and through countless kalpas, I have failed to attain true rectitude, thereby accruing manifold transgressions. Perhaps I have offended Heaven’s principles above, violated Earth’s propriety below, clashed with human sentiments in between, or contravened the nature of things around me. Tenfold entanglements accumulate externally, while the three karmic actions arise within. At times, I have aided the rightful and eradicated treachery, punishing the wicked to assist the mandate; at others, I have caused harm—whether intentional or accidental—while upholding the law and maintaining order. Or perhaps the movements of celestial bodies have brought adverse influences, or the cycles of the three destinies have coincided with decline and peril. The eight trigrams and nine palaces bear the numbers of punishment and obstruction; karmic debts and litigations contain the texts of interrogation and retribution. These hidden and obscure matters are subtle and difficult to fathom.

Only through devoted observance may I ascend to knock upon the mysteries of the void, hoping to attain spiritual resonance and receive the protection of the sages. Therefore, in accordance with the true methods of the *He Xun* and the sacred statutes of the *Zheng Zhou*, I offer sincerity as vast as seas and mountains, pouring forth earnest supplication throughout Heaven and Earth. With reverence, I present this rite of offering to express my solemn devotion.

We implore the Three Luminaries to turn their radiance upon us and the multitudes of sages to cast their gaze in mercy. May they absolve our past transgressions and bestow extraordinary blessings. May our sins be expunged and our names inscribed in the registers of life. May karmic debts be reconciled and calamities swept away. May our ninefold ancestors and sevenfold kin alike be bathed in boundless grace; may our sixfold affines and ninefold relations all be nurtured by mysterious compassion.

May the riverine borders be tranquil and the people’s dwellings harmonious. May customs be free of pestilence, and the countryside resound with songs of joy. May the dark bureaus and nether courts be illuminated by divine splendor, and may all flying and crawling creatures receive the blessings of nourishment and moisture.

Above all, we pray that the nation’s path be smooth and level, the sagely body at ease and flourishing. May the five weapons be sheathed, and may all living beings enjoy peace and well-being. May the imperial carriage swiftly return to the capital of Qin, and may the symbols of governance once more be displayed at the gates of Wei. Gazing at Heaven and longing for the sun, our words arise as our hearts hasten forth. We cannot fully express our devotion.

**Joint Memorial for the Life-Renewing Jiao Ritual**

We humbly submit: The Great Dao sheds its radiance, and the Three Spirits bestow their origins. Heaven and humanity establish their stations, while the myriad transformations divide their courses. Endowed with qi, some are pure, others turbid; granted fate, some meet fortune, others misfortune. Once darkness and light are distinguished, sin and blessing become manifest.

Thus, the Most High extends boundless compassion, and the Primordial Honored One shows mercy and protection. In the southern palace, the Repository of Extended Life is opened; in the northern capital, the statutes of merit and goodness are arrayed. The Two Leaps array their stars, shining impartially to illuminate all; the Three Officials and Five Emperors unfold vast pardon and rule with sovereignty. Their intent is that all may together bathe in non-action and attain purity and stillness, that beings may ascend to the fruits of the Dao and their names be inscribed on the ranks of the Perfected.

We, your servants, have presumptuously been blessed by divine power and fortunately encountered this flourishing era. We have heard the wondrous teachings of the Mystic Scholars and trod the broad path of benevolence and righteousness. Seated, we draw from the goblet of Yao; in motion, we sing of sagely virtue. Reflecting on ourselves, we are deeply moved with reverence and joy.

Yet we fear that in past kalpas and this present life, our conduct and bearing have often transgressed, frequently offending the unseen and the manifest. The defilements of the six senses are hard to dispel; the transgressions of the three karmic actions are not easily accumulated. On the ledgers of Wenchang, our good names remain unrecorded; in the halls of Fengdu, our sins are already marked. Moreover, we dread that in our current years, calamities may strike, and baleful stars may descend. Perhaps in constructing earth and wood, we have violated taboos; or in accidental harm or mistaken killing, we have bound ourselves to grievances and enmities. Thus, our years are silently stolen, and our blessings and fortune subtly diminished. Without the aid of this sacred assembly, our profound sincerity would be difficult to express.

Now, as white dew congeals in the morning and the clear autumn arrives in season, this is the day for repenting sins and praying to the Perfected, the time for extending grace and invoking blessings. We therefore lead those who share our devotion to take refuge in the Supreme Dao. Bearing ritual offerings, we bow our heads before the numinous altar, baring our hearts to the celestial palaces and fixing our thoughts upon the stellar abodes.

We humbly implore the Three Primes and the Upper Saints, the hosts of the Ten Realms, the mighty deities of the Southern Culmen, and the attendants of the Northern Terrace: in consideration of our earnest devotion, descend with your luminous presence. Bestow blessings upon the living and the dead, and quell misfortune and calamity forever. May we, your servants, and our nine generations of ancestors and seven lineages all ascend to heaven; may our five clans and six relations together enjoy peace and safety. May our sins be eradicated, our fortunes and longevity extended, our households serene, and our endeavors harmoniously fulfilled. May the five phases and three destinies forever be free from harm and conflict; may our private chambers and public halls long bear the blessings of prosperity and integrity. We cannot fully express our devotion.

**Zhang Daoheng’s Vow to the Northern Dipper**

We humbly acknowledge that the celestial patterns descend as foreknowledge, illuminating all things without exception; the Emperor’s Chariot revolves in its course, and no supplication fails to reach its mark. Though I am but lowly and obscure, I have been graciously favored with your divine regard. In the second year of the Great Shun era, I fell into dire peril, my very life hanging in the balance. I poured forth my sincerest devotion, beseeching the mysterious workings of the Dao. Thereupon I made a solemn vow, pledging one hundred thousand strings of cash. Soon after, I regained peace and was granted absolution. Though my life as a mere ant has been preserved, the grace of the true spirits remains unrequited. Since then, pressed by urgent travels and toiling north and south, I have seldom encountered a fitting occasion to repay this debt. The weight of ice and fire in my heart has left me sleepless and fearful.

Now, turning my heart toward the numinous transformation, I bow my head before the jade altar. With reverence, I prepare incense and lamps, meticulously performing the rites of offering. From the fourth month of this year until the present, I have five times presented the pledged sum, fulfilling the one hundred thousand strings. Moreover, at the Jade Bureau’s Hall of the Northern Emperor, I have commissioned the sculpting of eight statues of the Northern Dipper Perfected Lords, thereby expressing my long-held devotion and repaying the profound grace of the Dao. May the sagely compassion deign to accept this offering, so that the vows of old may be fulfilled on this day. May past sins be erased, lingering misfortunes swept away, enmities reconciled, and years of prosperity extended. May public and private affairs align with auspicious harmony, and may my kin enjoy the blessings of peace. May the living and the dead alike know tranquility, and may all beings partake in this grace.

**Prayer for the Military Marshal’s Household Altar**

We have heard that the Great Dao fuses with the true, and the Heavenly Worthy expounds its teachings. In the era of Red Clarity, the *Lingbao* revealed its charts. The eight assemblies formed its scriptures, congealing beyond the vastness of the firmament; the five talismans traced their traces, proclaiming the great abundance within. The Five Emperors received them to deliver humanity, and the Nine Heavens obtained them to establish order. Bestowed upon the earth below, they protect the state and succor the people, subduing malevolent spirits and eradicating evil. All undertakings are permitted to proceed in accordance with their decree.

Recently, as the construction of my dwelling nears completion, I fear that transgressions may have been committed, difficult to examine in full. Following the mysterious statutes, I humbly request the issuance of talismanic commands. I have reverently prepared the Yellow Register, submitting a memorial to the Pure Capital. I have inscribed the texts of the Five Directional Great Emperors, adhering to the Three Caverns’ rites of suppression and exorcism. Below, I notify the spirits of the five lands; above, I memorialize the Nine Subtleties. May the host of sages bestow their compassion, and may the myriad spirits grant their protection. May the talismanic officials be commanded to proclaim their duties, descending with their numinous power to spread their true *qi*. May demonic forces be purged, and dragon spirits pacified. May the Eight Trigrams and Nine Palaces, the Five Phases and Six Jia, the forces of yin and yang, the punishments and slayings, and the Generals of the Grand Year each guard their respective directions, forever dispelling calamity.

May any lingering corpses, residual *qi*, metal-and-earth demons, stagnant specters, wandering souls, hidden spirits, and obscure shades—each by the power of virtue—be allowed to depart freely. May this dwelling be preserved in peace, forever blessed with good fortune.

**Petition for the Three Assembly Offerings**

We humbly recall that human life is endowed by the two *qi*—yin and yang establish the body, while the hun and po guard the self. Should the slightest disharmony arise, misfortune and adversity follow. The days of the Three Assemblies mark the time when the three hun ascend to present their reckoning. Sin and blessing, fortune and calamity—no detail escapes notice. Lifespans are lengthened or cut short, rewards and punishments meted out with perfect clarity. Thus, one must accumulate virtue, and if not, at least perform meritorious deeds to redress transgressions, praying for auspicious responses to secure long life. The profound sages’ admonitions and the true scriptures’ teachings—how dare we not heed them to discipline body and mind?

For several years, on the days of the Lower Assembly, we have jointly conducted offerings and prayers, exhausting our devotions in reverent practice. Yet recently, entangled in worldly affairs, we inadvertently let the propitious festival pass. Our hearts trembled with unease, and we dared not rest at ease. Now, we have selected another auspicious day, invited virtuous companions, and together prepared incense and fire to hold this special offering. In the stillness of the cold night, we concentrate our minds and direct our thoughts, trusting that the true numina will descend and our sincere prayers will reach them.

May the myriad sages turn their radiance toward us, and may the thousand perfected ones reflect our devotion. Grant our supplications, dispel calamities and misfortune. Restrain the po and bind the hun, fulfilling each aspiration for cultivation. Transform ill fortune into good, opening the path to longevity. Some among us suffer from the decline of the Three Life-Spans or the stagnation of the Nine Palaces. Some endure the baleful influence of celestial omens or the entanglement of inauspicious fate. Some bear unresolved karmic debts or lingering afflictions. Some carry the weight of past injuries, accidental killings, or deep-seated transgressions. We beseech that all be purged, that we be granted luminous protection. May our households be blessed, and may our nine generations ascend to heaven. May public and private affairs flourish with harmony, and may our kin enjoy the blessings of peace.

**The Emperor’s Petition for the Southern Dipper Offering**

We humbly observe that the Three Luminaries adorn the heavens, illuminating all existence. The host of stars hangs as celestial signs, governing all forms. The Southern Dipper and Wen-chang oversee the register of life, serving as the foundation of the yang’s nurturing warmth and the arbiter of the emperor’s destiny. According to the *Heavenly Origin* and *Supreme Clarity* scriptures, on the fifth day of the fifth month, when the day of *bing-wu* arrives, blessings are bestowed, mercy extended, lives aided, and all beings benefited. All things are harmonized, and the state and its people are pacified. The yang’s power is thereby sustained, and its blessings universally bestowed.

This year, the four stars of Fire, Water, Metal, and Earth converge in the domain of *Shichen*. Moreover, the sun’s course aligns favorably, and all are in proper submission. At the new moon of the fifth month, the sun was to be eclipsed yet remained whole. By the full moon, the moon was to wane yet suffered no loss. Thus, this fifth day coincides with *bing-wu*, a moment of pure yang. Though we are unworthy and dull, we reverently receive this profound grace. Ashamed that our governance remains incomplete and our influence not yet universal, we dare to hope that this flow of kindness may extend even to our humble selves. May the Great Dao extend its compassion, and may Heaven grant its protection.

May the Nine Provinces and Four Seas enjoy peace and the people thrive. May the years be bountiful, the Six *Qi* balanced, the seasons regular, and the Four Times harmonious. May bows be sheathed and warhorses retired, oxen released from labor. May all attain the blessings of preserved life, and may the virtue of cherishing life be widely cultivated. With sincere devotion, we bow before the numinous altar. Gazing upon the Eight Luminaries, we lower ourselves in reverence, hoping the Nine Radiant Ones will shine afar. Witness this offering of wine and prayer, and grant us auspicious blessings.

The morning’s brilliance manifests the numina’s power, and the unseen aid of the spirits is already evident. As heaven and humanity resonate, the fulfillment of this covenant may be expected. We await the great unity of civilization and the harmony of the realm. With utmost reverence, we receive and uphold this profound compassion.

**The Emperor’s Petition for the Circumpolar Offering**

I have heard that when wind, rain, frost, and snow arrive unseasonably, the stars and constellations display their portents; when pondweed and water-plants may be offered, Heaven and Earth bestow their blessings. Looking back to the ancients, this is indeed a universal principle. I, your humble servant, reverently ascend the great throne and devoutly uphold the grand design. I dare not rest at ease, as though standing upon ice or treading a valley, ever shifting; the seven changes of the jade pitch-pipes weigh upon me, for I fear the common people are not yet at peace. Should even one thing be out of place—whether through misguided governance, misapplied punishments, or unfulfilled benevolence and trust—then weapons may yet linger on the borders, and the calendar not yet unified between Hua and Yi. Flood and drought remain unregulated, and prosperity eludes us. Famine, plague, and pestilence continue to afflict the prefectures and counties; bandits and deceivers still run rampant in the villages. Though I have practiced frugality, encouraged sharing, reduced my meals, and curtailed expenditures; though I have kept far from music and sensual pleasures, forever forsaking the hunt; though I dare not forget self-discipline amid humble vessels of clay and shell, nor seek amusement in pheasant-feather ornaments or tiger-amber trinkets—still, I fear the celestial bureaus may yet record my faults. My ignorance and shame weigh heavily, and I have no means to offer repentance.

Recently, the Metal and Fire stars, along with the Water and Earth luminaries, have all gathered in the region of Shu, converging in the domain of *Shichen*. The sun and moon have entered their eclipses, and even the historians of the new moons have set down their brushes. The sun’s path has shifted, and the astrological divisions have shown their favor. Yet how can these auspicious signs all be mere coincidence? Thus, I redouble my resolve for self-cultivation and deepen my vigilance. Seizing this auspicious noon-day hour, I humbly respond to the profound grace of the Supreme Mystery.

The numinous officials are distant, the Purple Palace most solemn. Though I have made my declarations in full, I fear my sincerity and clarity may not reach them. With fasting and purification, I have chosen this day to present my earnest words. The silent altar stands in solemn dignity, its rituals observed beneath the cold light of the second watch; the ethereal immortals and sages descend, bestowing blessings upon the mortal realm. I prostrate myself in hope that the Eight Directions may be at peace, the common people secure and prosperous, the state fortified, and the altars of soil and grain eternally tranquil. May the Six Treasuries be well-ordered, the Nine Virtues duly fulfilled. May officials in caps and robes faithfully serve, and the written script unite all under heaven.

*Petition at the Offering on Mount Anle in Luzhou*
I reflect that Chu and Shu share a border, a land of great importance in the southwest. The river surges with myriad currents, and mist gathers upon a thousand peaks. The Celestial Emperor gathers his glory here, and dragon spirits guard its bounds. This sacred land alone commands such renown. Its triple-tiered incense smoke mingles with the moonlight, and its eight caves conceal the abodes of transcendent immortals. Ever does it bestow victory and aid upon the people. Free from the harms of drought and flood, its customs preserve the auspiciousness of peace and integrity. Thus, the waters flow smoothly for those who sail upstream, and hemp and silk flourish abundantly. Revering the majesty of the Three Observances, I receive the gracious favor of the Two Perfected. This is proclaimed far and wide, recorded in scriptures and diagrams. With heads raised and hearts fixed, all sing of the profound bounty.

I, your servant, am bound to the imperial chariot, yet my gaze longs for the forests and springs. Often do I pity the white leopards and black apes that play among the mushroom rocks; the cassia peaks stretch before me, and though my steps are earthbound, my spirit wanders. Thus, I offer this modest incense and present my solitary plea. At the Northern Emperor’s Abbey, where I reside, the ritual implements for offerings are incomplete. Though the rites for invoking blessings have been performed, the music of soaring frost remains wanting. I have heard that within these immortal mountains, sacred instruments abound. Yet without a set time for their testing, their resplendent tones remain obscured. The Dao responds to sincerity, and bells may indeed be moved. I humbly wish to reduce what is in excess to supply what is lacking. Taking from the verdant peaks, I would transfer them to the imperial capital. May their pure sounds gradually rise through the vermilion clouds, and their mighty resonance be heard within the Purple Forbidden precincts. I pray that my sincere prayers be granted, that these treasures may forever guard the capital.

**Prayer for the Efficacy of the Sacred Mountains’ Spirits**

Composed by Du Guangting, Grand Master of the Interior for Sacred Offerings, Bestowed with Purple Robes, at the Supreme Clarity Palace in the Upper Capital

We humbly observe: the Great Dao fuses essence, giving rise to the Two Modes. The Primal Honored One spreads transformation, sowing the seeds of the myriad spirits. All receive the mandate of governance, together securing peace for the state and its lands. Revered are the host of numinous presences, who indeed gather blessings and felicity.

Since the founding of the dynasty—heaven’s will aligned with the people’s—this realm was established. Though it has not yet attained the perfection of grand peace, it has fortunately become a land of abundance. The four quarters have submitted, and the hundred lords are assembled. The hearts of the people are steadfast, and heaven’s intent is manifest.

Yet at times, instruction strays from righteous principle, and affection binds to partiality. Great responsibilities of prosperity and splendor are entrusted, and the weighty authority of oversight and nurture is conferred. The base and the eminent alike grow wanton, indulging their whims, forgetting filial piety and reverence. They employ the seductions of treachery, stirring the ferocity of rebellion. Arrows and stones threaten the imperial carriage, and the drums of war resound near the attendants.

Still, we rely on the grace of High Heaven and the descent of numinous transformation. The hearts of owls and jackals were not tolerated; the fumes of wolves and jackals were swiftly extinguished. Before day could turn to dusk, all was swept away. Within and without, peace was restored, and the seas and lands rejoiced.

Thus, an auspicious day was chosen to repay the majesty of the spirits. From afar, we offer our sincerity in proclamation, exhausting the purest of oblations. We dare to hope for their discernment and protection, that lasting peace and stability may prevail.

**Prayer for the Water Spirit at the Unmooring of the Fleet by Zong An, Attendant Censor of Zhenjiang**

We humbly observe: the transformative power of the Dao extends everywhere, and the blessings of the spirits universally reach. Above, they embrace the state and its lands; below, they extend to the bonds of humanity.

We all rely upon the salvific protection of the spirits, silently borrowing their sustaining power. From ancient times to the present, never has this failed—both waters and lands enjoy tranquility.

I, though possessed of but ordinary talent, have fortunately encountered this sagely era. In the great work of statecraft, I have no merit worthy of bamboo and silk; yet through profound grace, I have been repeatedly favored by the creation of Heaven and Earth. Suddenly, I received the sovereign’s commendation and was publicly entrusted with the military tally—ascending Han Xin’s altar of purification, receiving Lü Hou’s golden axe. The sacred grass was bestowed to mark my command, and the chariot’s hub was pushed forth for my expedition. Though I tremble with awe at this responsibility, I dare not decline the trust placed in me. Choosing an auspicious day, I received my orders and set forth.

Moreover, the Chu Gorge lies upstream, the Jin River rushes downstream. A thousand vessels follow in the imperial wake, while ten thousand currents surge forward in competition. The emperor, ever mindful of the true numen, is deeply concerned by these hidden perils. His imperial heart is ever devoted to reverence, seeking to spread transformation and harmonize neighboring lands, while also extending counsel to embrace distant realms. This mighty host of keen warriors embarks first upon this journey. As we prepare to cast off and ride the current, we purify our sincerity and offer this sacrifice.

We humbly invoke the Great Sage of the Primordial Dao, the Five Venerable Elders, the divine commanders of the mysterious offices—may they bestow vast blessings and mighty fortune. May swift waves ensure safe crossing, and turbulent rapids transform into tranquil flows. May the myriad leagues of waterways be opened, and the hundred spirits grant their protection. May the great enterprise flourish, and the grand foundations be further broadened. May the central court be shielded from without, and all together attain auspicious fortune.

**Prayer for the Life-Span Sacrifice by Zhou Xiang, Acting Official**

We have heard that Heaven’s scrutiny is most discerning, responding to all that is felt. The spirit-way is upright and just, with no prayer left unanswered. Ever does it extend its salvific benevolence, fulfilling the wishes of those who supplicate. Disasters are dispelled, and blessings flow forth like echo answering sound. I hold these words in reverence, ever maintaining a humble and devout heart. Whenever my fate has allowed, I have prepared offerings and performed rites, striving to deepen my sincerity and truly receiving bright protection.

Yet I fear that worldly affairs remain unsettled, and transgressions easily accumulate. Bound by the constraints of official duty, regrets and faults are hard to escape. As the stars cast their light upon me, this year’s fate is marked by decline and peril. I dread the entanglement of calamity and dare not hope for fortune’s favor. Since joining the military in neighboring provinces and patrolling distant frontiers, I have twice encamped in war chariots through the cycles of the heavens. Lacking the proper rites of memorial and petition, I must have incurred the fault of negligence. I had intended to wait for our triumphant return to perform the rain sacrifice and offer thanks. But now, as we are still engaged in fortifying our ramparts and have not yet sheathed our bows, the incense and lamps have long been neglected, and no place of peace has been reached. Thus, I hasten my heart toward the numinous realm, distantly knocking upon the gates of the Most True. I prepare the offerings for the threefold sacrifice, presenting them together at a single altar.

We humbly beseech the Mystic Sage to look down upon our sincere devotion. May calamities be dissolved and disasters dispelled, life extended and fate preserved. May past stains be cleansed and former faults erased, that we may witness the completion of our success and forever attain abundant fortune.

**Prayer for the Life-Span Sacrifice to Lord Ge’s Transformed Spirit**

We humbly observe: the two qi derive their numen, and the Five Phases bear their forms. The law of the vaulted heavens determines fate, while the substance of the vast earth shapes all beings. Sin and fortune, good and ill—all arise from hidden judgments. In the workings of the heart and the path of conduct, all is governed by their decree.

Moreover, burdened with exceptional honor and long entrusted with weighty responsibilities, we reflect upon our limits and station, ever filled with trepidation and shame. Whenever we approach the altar of memorials and sacrifices, how dare we forget the rites of reverence and awe? Through our devout offerings, we aspire to repay the grace of sovereign and kin.

Now, as the day of the Primordial Lady arrives, we come before the sacred northern precinct of our life-destiny, kindling incense and flame to beseech the True Immortals. May they look upon our sincere devotion and bestow boundless fortune. May our transgressions be purged and our years prolonged, our dwelling secure and our people at peace. May no calamity or pestilence assail the four borders, and may agriculture and sericulture flourish in abundant harvests. Thus shall we pour forth the loyalty of sunflowers turning to the sun, forever upholding the era of Great Peace.

With utmost reverence and devotion, we submit this prayer.

**First Memorial for the Transformation of the Ten Thousand Immortals**

We humbly observe: this is the famed region of Nine Ridges, where the traces of the Three Immortals’ transformations abide. Above, it connects with the Heart Mansion of the heavens; below, it guards the Brocade River. Clouds and mist weave radiant brocade, while pines and cassia stand tall amid the hues of mist and haze. The Five Palaces rise in lofty splendor, their forms evoking the rites of the Western Numinous and Southern Culmen; the Four Auxiliaries shine in mutual brilliance, arrayed as the Eastern Florescence and Northern Perfected. Most eminent in scenic grandeur, it alone commands the marvels of seclusion. Slanting against the jade wheel of the moon, it overlooks the stone ravine.

Yet of late, as master and disciples stirred in turmoil, the clash of gongs and drums resounded, comets streaked across the sky, and frost-tipped spears gleamed over the fields. Warriors who moved like bears and cranes did not return; recluses who rinsed in streams and rested on stones departed in indignation. Gazing upon these once-exalted wonders, we find them now overgrown and desolate. The gilded towers’ splendor is dulled by dust, and the grand halls’ adornments are marred by moss. Reflecting on this ruin, we can but sigh in lament.

Moreover, as this day of our life-destiny aligns with this site of transformation, it is fitting to renew our vows and repay the True Spirits. Thus, we have commanded the Daoist of the Three Caverns, Tang Dongqing, to fell timber and gather artisans, to measure the stars and select an auspicious day. With the Wind and Winnowing Baskets in alignment for the task, and the propitious hour of *jiazi* at hand, we reverently announce our intent to the Perfected and solemnly perform the Great Sacrifice.

We humbly pray that the True Spirits will look upon our earnest devotion and grant us felicitous omens, that no calamities may intrude, and that our endeavors swiftly come to fruition. May we restore the legacy of the sages of old and establish a model for the kalpas to come. May our merit resound through the Grotto-Heavens and be inscribed upon the cloud-vales.

Thus do we wish that the True Spirits will extend their divine protection, that the riverlands be tranquil, crops abundant, and pestilence dispelled. May we receive the elixir of the Nine Auxiliaries and hear the profound principles of the Double Mystery. Ever shall we turn our hearts toward the Pole Star, aspiring to fulfill the blessings of the Supreme Perfected.

With utmost sincerity, we submit this prayer.

**Memorial for the Sacrifice to Lord Ge’s Transformed Spirit, Presented by the Minister of Works on Behalf of the King**

We humbly observe: the sacred mountains of Supreme Purity are the site of Lord Ge’s numinous transformation. A marvel of the riverlands, they are a court of fortune for all under heaven. Jade caverns yawn to shelter clouds, and jasper peaks rise to obscure the sun. At dawn, iridescent mists disperse; at night, divine torches take flight. Stalactites gleam in secluded grottoes, and springs murmur over deep treasures. The radiance of the Nine Wells manifests its own numen; the vital stirrings of the Three Perfected ever abide. The Cranes’ Observatory stands at the center, while the Constellation of the Responding Dragon shines above. Crimson halls and azure eaves stretch in succession, their ancient forms still visible. The halls of Xiao and the steles of Wei stand in ordered array, their ancient traces preserved.

Ever do these wonders proclaim their auspicious signs, extending even to the isles of the immortals.

The minister, by virtue of his appointment as the envoy to the Prince of Shu on the occasion of His Highness’s natal day, has been entrusted with this transformative mission. Only recently have the bonds of governance been secured, and already the realm stands complete. Towering pavilions and storied terraces snatch the morning radiance from sheer cliffs, while wind-swept casements and cloud-kissed beams lend marvel to the sacred groves. The cavern-heaven has been opened anew to shelter the brocade-clad capital. Within its forty prefectures, the granaries overflow with each year’s abundance; across its five thousand *li* of mountains and rivers, the people thrive in prosperity. All have received the bounty—who does not know the grace bestowed? The minister, humbly shaped by this molding influence, has indeed been deeply touched by the workings of creation. In reverent prayer and gratitude, he has prepared this offering of incense and libation, beseeching the power of the Dao.

May the Nine Heavens grant their favor, may the host of sages look down in witness, and may the radiance of their presence illumine the sincerity below, bestowing vast blessings. May the Three Rivers mirror the expanse of peace, may the eight lands be cleansed of dust. May harvests flourish and disasters dissolve like mist. May the divine elixir be conveyed to ensure long years, and may the merit of serving the sagely court perpetually exalt the great treasure. May the altars of state be twice secured, and may the realm forever enjoy felicity. The minister, unable to contain his fervent prayers and yearning for grace, prostrates himself in utmost devotion.

With respect, this petition is humbly submitted.

*Ran Chuchou’s Prayer of Return to the Northern Dipper*

Prostrate, I reflect: the celestial symbols of the Supreme Mystery shine upon the earth below. The Emperor’s Chariot turns in its course, the Dipper’s handle directs its sway. Sin and fortune, good and ill—all are governed by this sovereign will. We, your servants, having received our charge, journeyed far upon the Way. We traversed hardships, scaled perilous heights, and faced every trial. Yet with each step, we held fast to our sincere devotion, silently entreating the mysterious perfected ones. By grace, we were granted the favor of your protection and attained the blessing of peace. Overwhelmed by this divine benevolence, our hearts burn to repay it. Thus, on this appointed day, we have prepared the rites of incense and prayer, kindling fragrant offerings to fulfill our vow and bow in gratitude for your boundless grace.

We humbly beseech the exalted immortals to accept our modest tribute. May calamities be dispelled and misfortunes swept away. May rank be elevated and years prolonged. May our comings and goings be smooth, our public and private affairs auspicious. May no path be obstructed, and may our families dwell in safety. May we ever bask in the light of sun and moon, and faithfully serve our radiant and sagely lord. We cannot express the fullness of our devotion.

*Prayer of Thanksgiving for the Completion of the Purple Radiance Grotto*

Prostrate, I reflect: the Great Dao is formless and silent, yet the immortals manifest its wondrous transformations. They reveal its boundless efficacy and bestow its unfathomable mysterious power. In secret, they aid emperors and kings, and unseen, they uphold states and nations. From ancient times to the present, the records shine with their glory. Thus did Emperor Yao wander to Guye, the Yellow Emperor ascend Juci, King Mu of Zhou sail the Jasper Waters, and the Han Emperor visit Mount Kun. All gazed upon mist and clouds, beheld ice and snow, and thereby secured long reigns, brought order and peace, achieved great prosperity, and rightfully manifested the protection of the Dao.

Yet I, of meager virtue, have dared to undertake this grand endeavor. How could I presume to neglect reverence before the Golden Gates and Jade Capitals? How could I fail to hold in awe the Nine Pures and Three Realms? Thus, I have ever maintained a heart of utmost sincerity.

In the second year of Yongping, the ren-shen year, on the twenty-first day of the seventh month, ding-mao, a prophetic text bestowed by the Most High Lord Lao was obtained in Shifang County of Hanzhou. Jade scriptures were left in the immortal’s abode, and bronze talismans were engraved upon the fertile earth. Birth dates, life mandates, times, days, and names were recorded, tracing the unbroken succession of generations and clarifying the prolonged blessing of Heaven’s mandate.

On the twenty-fourth day of the eighth month in the fourth year, wu-zi, Wang Chengshang, Military Commissioner of Lizhou, memorialized that the numinous grotto of this mountain had revealed the presence of divine immortals. Thereupon, he commanded Ren Keyan, Master of Ceremonies, and Yang Zhishu, a high-ranking official, to present a formal report of gratitude, reverently responding to the radiant numen.

On the first day of the tenth month, jia-zi, as the jiao altar was first opened, auspicious manifestations were again witnessed. Cloud banners and feathered screens appeared amid the jagged cliffs, while crane-like immortals with divine bearing arrayed themselves within the grotto’s entrance. These events surpassed those of Huishan and Yaoshui, and their splendor exceeded that of Guye and Juci. Overwhelmed by such auspicious omens, we were filled with awe.

Thus, after consulting the classical rites, we have specially undertaken this act of enfeoffment and veneration. On the jia-shen day of this month, Daochang Mountain was renamed Xuandu Mountain, Yangmo Grotto was renamed Zixia Grotto, and Jinggu County was renamed Jinxian County. The spirit of Xuandu Mountain was enfeoffed as Duke of Jade Purity. We established an altar and renovated the temple halls, from the initial planning to the completion of the work. Repeated sightings of true forms further manifested the numinous favor.

We respectfully dispatch Du Guangting, Grand Master for Glorious Happiness, Left Remonstrance Gentleman, Master of Broad Accomplishment, and Duke of Cai, along with twelve others, bearing ritual gifts of silk, incense, and flowers, to perform the Golden Register Daoist rites in accordance with the Mysterious Canon at the Zixia Immortal Abbey. As this occasion coincides with the Lower Prime Festival, a most solemn observance, we duly present this offering of gratitude and again display the honors of enfeoffment.

We humbly beseech the assembled sages, perfected ones, immortal officials, and celestial administrators of the grotto-heavens to witness our sincere devotion and bestow upon us their mysterious blessings. May the nine lands be governed in peace, and the ten thousand regions united in harmony. May the heavens and earth, the palaces of the living and the courts of the dead, ever extend their benevolent grace. May the mandate of our dynasty endure for generations, and may we perpetually enjoy the fortune of prolonged prosperity. We bow our heads and present this reverent petition.

**Memorial for the Life-Destiny Jiao of Lord Zong Kui of Yangzhou**

We have heard that all forms and natures derive their existence from the Great Dao, and all lives and destinies are bestowed by the Supreme Mystery. We receive the compassion of Heaven and Earth’s sheltering embrace and share in the power of qi’s transforming and nurturing force. Through diligent cultivation and reverent devotion, we honor the true numina.

Reflecting upon myself, a mere speck of dust, I have repeatedly received the imperial grace. I have served within the palace as a counselor and without as a guardian of the frontier. Yet I have rendered no droplet of merit, and my heart is ever filled with the fear of overreaching.

Now, within the celestial cycles and the palace of my destiny, dark stars are in conjunction, and Mars stands in opposition. Fearing the convergence of misfortune, I have nowhere else to turn for prayer. We recall that the Most High has transmitted texts, and the Primordial August One established teachings. The Orthodox Unity tradition prescribes rites of expiation, and the River Chart outlines the procedures for jiao offerings. If we exhaust our sincerity and diligence, we shall surely receive manifest protection.

Therefore, on the day of my life-destiny, I dare to perform the Nine Luminaries Jiao, purifying my heart and returning to the Mysterious Ultimate. We humbly beseech the assembled perfected ones and great sages to look down upon our bright sincerity. Cleanse our transgressions, dissolve our karmic debts, dispel calamities, and prolong our years. Increase our emoluments in the Southern Palace and remove misfortune from the Northern Mansion. By purifying our hearts and restraining our conduct, we may repay the grace of the true sages above; by serving the state with loyalty, we may forever requite the virtue of sovereign and parents. I am unworthy.

**Memorial for the Life-Destiny Jiao**

We have heard that the virtue of Heaven and Earth prioritizes life, and the grace of creation and nurturance is rooted in fortune. I have been favored with good fortune and have enjoyed a flourishing era. I have received the compassion of the Three Luminaries’ illumination and the beneficence of the sagely sovereign’s exalted favor. My service in the provinces has been met with honor, and my career has been marked by distinction.

Yet I ever fear that fortune may turn to calamity and remain vigilant in preserving my prosperity through restraint. My apprehension deepens, and I dare not rest at ease. Now, within the celestial cycles and the palace of my destiny, Mars stands in opposition, and dark stars are in conjunction. Gazing upon the celestial signs, I contemplate in silence—how may I offer thanks? Reflecting upon my humble existence, I strive to cultivate my resolve, yet my anxiety only grows.

Thus, on the day of my life-destiny, I have prepared the River Chart Jiao rites, reverently presenting my sincere devotion in the hope of receiving the mysterious compassion. We humbly pray that my disasters and misfortunes be dispelled, my inauspicious influences eradicated. May my years be prolonged, my emoluments increased. May I fully express my reverent devotion and forever repay the protection of the Most True.

**Memorial of Gratitude and Fulfillment of Vows by the Lady of Yueguo on Behalf of Military Commissioner Lord Zong Kan**

We have heard that the Perfect Dao mysteriously pervades all, responding to circumstances and answering prayers. Though our cinnabar hearts reside in the mortal realm, the mysterious perception of the Upper Clarity is ever moved.

**Memorial of Gratitude and Fulfillment of Vows by the Lady of Yueguo on Behalf of Military Commissioner Lord Zong Kan**

The echo responds without partiality, the shadow follows without obstruction. My husband, Wang Zongkan, and our son, Chengzhao, led troops last year to suppress rebellion, serving the state and the throne. Besieged in a lone city, they endured for months on end. Smoke signals flared with urgency, yet word from them remained scarce. My spirit raced toward Baomian, my gaze stretched toward the mountains and rivers—endless anxiety, no path for prayer. Thus, I reverently approached the Daoist temple to present a memorial, solemnly arranging the ritual platform to invoke the celestial hosts. Through the resonance of the true spirits, protection was granted. Soon, the fortified walls were breached, the ferocious rebels crushed. The mission of pacification was accomplished, fulfilling the sagely reward. Kin reunited, the army returned in triumph. Though victory stemmed from sagacious strategy, divine aid played its part. Now, on this auspicious day, I offer thanks for the mysterious blessings. Renewing the rites of memorial and jiao, I present my fragrant gratitude. With utmost sincerity, I bow and light incense, invoking the true chariots of the thirty-six palaces and beseeching the great rites of the eighty-one excellences. May auspicious radiance descend upon the altar, may boundless favor forever bestow fortune upon our land. May the sagely chart endure, may our clan flourish. I vow to uphold my reverent devotion, ever repaying the warmth of the numinous true. Overwhelmed by gratitude for this sacred grace, I cannot express the depth of my reverence.

**Memorial for the Rite of Disaster Dispelling by Attendant-in-Ordinary Mao Xun**

We have heard that the qi of the Dao flows forth, its mysterious power forging all things. The Three Spirits bestow endowment, heaven and earth hold sway over covering and bearing. The five planets govern the cycles of cold and heat, the turning of seasons. Thus, all lives and destinies are bound to the celestial gates. Fortune follows goodness, calamity follows excess—all shaped by divine transformation. It is fitting to devote oneself to reverence and uphold the numinous blessings. From my earliest years, I have been blessed by sagely favor, showered with extraordinary grace. From the northern court to the southern palace, I have repeatedly been honored with appointments; draped in crimson and purple, I have reached the height of splendor. Yet I have always striven to repay the state with loyalty and to discipline myself with caution. Still, I fear that the reckoning of yin and yang may align with misfortune, that baleful stars may cast their light upon me. Construction may disturb the dragon spirits, or my conduct may falter in reverence. My heart, unexpressed in prayer and repentance, is ever filled with trepidation. Now, as my life-destiny faces its cyclical turn, celestial omens descend upon the northeast. The great cycle resides in *xu*, the *kuigang* prevails. The earth star lies hidden in my life palace, its opposing light casting upon the *chou* position. Fearing the onset of disaster, my alarm only deepens. We have heard that the Southern Mansion of Wenchang governs life and merit, while the Northern Palace of the Dipper corrects transgressions. Fortune and misfortune are measured without error, retribution mirrors reflection. The true teachings open the path of repentance, where sincerity finds response; the mysterious scriptures prescribe the rites of gratitude, where prayers are answered. Thus, on this auspicious day, I humbly prepare the jiao offering, baring my cinnabar sincerity in hope of moving the true perception. I pray that my disasters and obstructions be dissolved, my misfortunes purged, my calamities pacified, my transgressions eradicated. May my emoluments and years be increased, may blessings and fortune be bestowed. I vow to uphold loyalty and filial piety, repaying the grace of sovereign and parents. Forever inscribed in my heart, I rely solely upon the mysterious compassion. Overwhelmed by the need to repent, pray, and beseech, I cannot express the depth of my reverence.

**Memorial of Fulfillment of Vows to the Nine Heavens True Lord of Mount Lu by Zhang Chongyin**

We reflect upon the majestic region of Zhenyi, where Mount Lu’s true traces reside. Its rank surpasses the Five Peaks, its domain commands the Nine Rivers. Jade towers and golden cities encompass the hidden abodes of immortals; Lu Peak’s cloud canopy shelters the lofty capital of the true saints. Amidst its verdant stillness, it rises above the vast waves. Each time I have gazed upon it in prayer, it has bestowed fortune and blessing. In recent years, exiled by imperial decree, I drifted like a lone leaf upon the waters. Passing through this sacred realm, my heart prayed to the true lords above, hoping for their merciful aid, offering libations of peppered wine. My sincerity moved them, and signs of response appeared. Yet soon, the path was blocked by weapons, waves startled the ships. My solitary sail was cut off, and I spoke of returning by another route. My unfulfilled devotion remained, the mysterious protection unrequited. Now, as sagely grace is proclaimed and I rest in the Shu capital, I seek the Daoist temple to fulfill my long-held vow. I present the jiao offering, reverently conveying my bright sincerity. We have heard that where there is sincerity, there is response—the Dao is omnipresent. Though the feathered banners may be distant, are ten thousand *li* truly far? Though the chariots of judgment descend, are the Three Rivers too remote? Receiving this cinnabar sincerity, may vast blessings be bestowed. May my former vows be fulfilled, may extraordinary grace extend afar. I pray that my sins be absolved, my disasters forever erased. May I aid in the governance of Yao and Yu, may I enjoy the longevity of two heads and six bodies. May I devote myself to loyalty and filial piety, serving sovereign and parents. I vow to cultivate reverence and devotion, relying upon the power of the Dao. Overwhelmed, I cannot express the depth of my reverence.

**Memorial to the Southern Dipper and Northern Dipper by Zhang Chongyin**

We have heard that the Three Spirits established their positions, and the myriad forms received their shapes. Embracing the perfect harmony of yin and yang, they contain the true essence of heaven and earth. Thus, talents and destinies are bestowed, each with its office. They govern life and death, their gates and barriers distinct. Even the most minute matters are recorded, nothing escapes scrutiny. I humbly consider my past and present lives, spanning countless kalpas. Transgressions accumulate, sins manifest. My conduct may not align with the divine, my actions may lack reverence. Now, as celestial signs cast their light, my life-destiny faces misfortune. Disasters arise, yet I know not how to avert them. Today, I bow before the jade transformation, reverently facing the jasper altar. Having chosen an auspicious day, I solemnly present the jiao rites. I pray that the Six Saints of the Southern Palace bestow a new name upon my life, that the Seven Perfected of the Northern Dipper erase my name from the register of death. May the Three Officials absolve my sins, may the Five Emperors dispel my disasters. May past vows be fulfilled in these sacred mountains, may blessings descend from the sagely grace. Furthermore, as I receive the imperial decree and prepare to journey to the court, I face the perils of rivers and mountains, the dangers of land and water. I rely entirely upon your bright protection, humbly offering my profound sincerity.

Having reached the imperial domain and been granted supreme fortune, how dare I forget my devotions to repay the true spirits?

I, Wang Zongkui of Hanzhou, humbly submit this *jiao* prayer for the pacification of my dwelling.

I have heard that when the Great Primal divided, the Three Spirits established their positions. The customs of cave-dwelling gave way to the construction of halls and houses; since the rise of high antiquity, sages have instituted teachings in accord with the times. Thus they shielded against cold, heat, dryness, and dampness, prepared for wind and rain, and regulated the cycles of darkness and light. As the forms of things multiplied, so too did the scope of their analogies expand. They ordered them by Qian and Kun, Zhen and Dui, embodied them in the five tones—*zheng*, *yu*, *gong*, and *shang*—and propelled the interplay of yin and yang, wielding punishment and virtue. The stems *yi*, *xin*, *geng*, and *gui* were arrayed in their respective offices; the branches *zi*, *wu*, *chou*, and *yin* were distributed among their governing spirits. At the boundaries of the Six Spirits and Four Killers, dragon and tiger forces clash; in the domains of Five Yellows and Nine Purples, auspicious signs converge. The Dao encompasses all in its embrace, and the reckoning of merit follows the stars and sun. Thus we examine fortune and misfortune, and indeed, clear evidence emerges. Magpies follow the Grand Year to aid in evading the General; how much more, then, should we revere the most numinous and never forget caution?

Recently, finding my dwelling crude and unsuitable, I chose an auspicious day to rebuild. I sought the great and sturdy, rejecting excess and extravagance. I emulated the ancient ways of thatching and rammed earth, heeding the admonitions of mountain-carved beams and algae-adorned pillars. Now the plastering is complete, and the construction finished. Yet I fear that in the raising of baskets and shovels, I may have violated taboos; in the course of labor, I may have offended the spirits. Perhaps I have transgressed the suitability of the Five Surnames or neglected the essentials of the Two Dwellings. Maybe I have damaged the earth’s veins, pierced hills and plains, defiled auspicious spirits, or suppressed inauspicious sites—thus inviting disaster without having confessed my faults.

Therefore, I have carefully studied the mysterious classics and redoubled my sincerity. Reverently performing the great *jiao* rites, I humbly invoke the True Writs, open the *Lingbao* Red Scriptures, and follow the talismanic commands of the *Dongxuan*. I dispel malign forces and pacify the dragon spirits. I seek forgiveness for past transgressions, beseeching the removal of calamities and the bestowal of blessings. I pray that the Three Honored Ones deign to witness, that the Five Emperors cast their radiance, that the Eight Assembled Mighties be commanded, and that the Three Primordial Officers and their subordinates safeguard my dwelling and purify its environs. May they absolve the sins of the past and grant future purity and fortune. May I truly receive their protection and ever enjoy peace.

Within this dwelling, the local earth gods and former occupants—whether ancient or recent, of diverse surnames—are also included in this *jiao* altar’s offerings. May they partake of this sincere rite, each preserving their tranquility. Ascend to the courts of blessing and bring no harm. May my entire household receive grace, my nine clans share in prosperity. May I ever incline my heart toward loyalty and filial piety, upholding the virtue of ruler and kin.

I, Ma Shimu, humbly submit this *jiao* prayer for the Soil Star.

I reflect that when the primordial *qi* divided its splendor, the Three Luminaries shone forth, illuminating all beings and governing the myriad regions. They follow the Yellow Path with constancy, adorning the vault of heaven without disorder. In great matters, they govern the cycles of heaven and earth, the rise and fall of states, the alternation of fortune and misfortune, the balance of safety and peril. In lesser matters, they oversee human morality, the fortunes of years, the length of destinies, and all such affairs, which are subject to their dominion.

Within my body’s palace, the Soil Star’s radiance has passed. In my natal constellation, the Dark Void has traversed. Both major and minor transits have encountered clashes and obstructions. In the domain of my fate, the Celestial Talisman has taken residence. Disasters and dangers have piled upon one another; illness and misfortune have clung like chains. Though I have consulted the three physicians, my long-standing ailments remain unrelieved. I fear these are the consequences of sins accumulated over lifetimes, weaving this web of misfortune; past transgressions have led to these present obstructions. Perhaps in my duties, rewards and punishments were unclear. Since establishing myself, errors and faults have amassed. The spirits have meted out their reproach, and my years and fate have been troubled.

Day and night, I have been consumed by worry, wishing to offer prayers and seek absolution. Thus, I have studied the astrological texts and examined the ritual codes. Reverently approaching the sacred altar, I earnestly perform the *jiao* rites. Gazing toward the Central Quarter, I pour forth my sincerity; beholding the celestial images, I direct my thoughts. Bowing, I burn incense and lay bare my repentance. I pray that the hosts of sages in the Mysterious Bureau bestow their great compassion, that the Most High Dao and the exalted ones descend their life-sustaining grace.

May sins and transgressions be absolved, disasters and misfortunes dissolved; may enmities be reconciled, and calamitous retributions leveled. May the hundred meridians flow freely, the six *qi* harmonize and regulate. May illnesses and sufferings be healed, and blessings and auspiciousness converge. May life be prolonged under the Southern Dipper, and death averted from the Northern Palace. With reverence, I receive the benevolent protection of the Dao, and dare not betray the gracious favor of the true spirits.

*Guangcheng Ji*, Scroll Twelve—Concluded
Composed by Du Guangting, Grand Master of Imperial Edicts and Bestower of the Purple Robe, Inner Offering Attendant of the Great Pure Palace
*Zhou Tian Ci* for the Birthday of Vice Commissioner of Pacification Zhang

I have heard that the Dao divides into the One *qi*, while humanity corresponds to the Three Spirits. Good and evil arise from the sincerest depths, and fortune and misfortune respond to the Mysterious Ultimate. If one cultivates noble aspirations, they shall surely align with extraordinary omens. Moreover, situated upon this sacred mountain, overlooking the immortal grottoes, burning incense and offering prayers, I pour forth my earnest entreaties—surely these shall resound before the divine and manifest abundant blessings.

The Vice Commissioner of Pacification of Dangchuan, Zhang Lin, is endowed with far-reaching judgment and upholds a heart of purity and uprightness. His discernment is impartial, his loyalty unwavering. In serving the public and honoring his lord, his mind is as clear as still water; in governing subordinates and relieving the people, his guidance is as effortless as a turning wheel. Moreover, his encampments bristle with tiger-like troops, and his seasonal rewards are ever generous. Though warfare has raged for years, provisions have been transported across a thousand *li* without fail. His words are ever for the state’s welfare, his ambitions never for personal gain. Constantly diligent and reverent, he forgets sleep and meals. All who receive his beneficence know his grace.

I, your humble servant, a lowly official, have been lifted on fragile wings. Relying on his protection, I now soar with resolve. Thinking to beseech the true spirits, I offer this prayer in gratitude.

Now, as the warmth of yang stirs and the valleys awaken to spring, I recall his birth and reverently perform the *Dahui* rites. Gazing upon the celestial patterns, I present my earnest pleas; turning my heart toward the rivers and mountains, I offer devotion. Incense mingles with the clouds of the streams, lamps blend with the moonlight on the peaks. A thousand crags lie in stillness, the midnight wind is clear. I display the rites of solemn reverence, preparing the offerings of water plants and sacred herbs.

I humbly pray that the radiance of the Three Luminaries may shine upon him, and the winds of the Ten Immortals descend. May they witness the sincerity of this libation and bestow luminous blessings. May his lifespan extend to twice nine and six, and the disasters of the Five Phases and Three Destinies be averted. May his virtuous deeds flourish upon the immortal ranks, and his hidden merits illuminate his lineage through the ages.

Then may the frontier regions know peace, and the borderlands be tranquil. May pestilence and plague be dispelled, and weapons of war set aside. May the sagely lord perfect the governance of *wu-wei*, and the provincial defenses display the grace of soft submission. May all beings, seen and unseen, attain their proper places, and all creatures, soaring and sinking, fulfill their destinies. Dare I forget my duty to refine and uphold this, in service to the flourishing and bright?

I, your humble servant, Mo Tingyi, offer this *Jiao* prayer for the Nine Palaces and Celestial Talismans.

I have heard that the vast and profound forms the body, and the Central Yellow establishes its position. It governs water and fire as their sovereign, and crowns metal and wood as their lord. Thus, it nurtures the myriad spirits and encompasses the Five Wefts. Above, it oversees the state; below, it extends to human relations. Fortune and misfortune are its charge, and safety and peril are bound to it.

This palace falls under the *Zhen* trigram, where the Five Ghosts converge. The *qi* of destiny flies like a banner, and this month coincides with its influence. Fearing the onset of disaster, I am deeply anxious. Reverently selecting an auspicious day, I meticulously perform the *jiao* rites. I humbly pray that the true spirits witness my sincerity and bestow great blessings: turning peril into safety, transforming misfortune into fortune; dissolving calamities, averting disasters, increasing emoluments, and prolonging years. May my family and dependents enjoy health and peace, and may public and private affairs harmonize. I cannot express the fullness of my devotion.

**Prayer for the Southern Dipper Rites**

Reverently considering: the Great Dao congeals in truth, and the mysterious power nurtures all life. Though the sources of purity and turbidity differ, the positions of yin and yang are distinct. The Upper Palace of the Southern Dipper truly governs the register of life. Above, it extends to the state; below, it reaches all human relations. Longevity and emoluments, whether abundant or meager, are all subject to its dominion, without distinction between the great and the minute.

We, your servants, have been blessed to serve this sagely dynasty and personally witness the flourishing of the Dao. Yet, though we have received the gifts of heaven and earth, our actions and intentions may still err. In navigating the world and conducting ourselves, how could we be free of faults? Failing to repent and atone, we have thus invited calamity and peril. Moreover, we fear that the stars of our fate, the Nine Palaces, and the Three Destinies may bring us misfortune, punishment, or conflict. The ways of the spirits are profound, and mortal understanding is limited. We must rely on incense and offerings to express our earnest prayers.

Daring to select an auspicious day, we humbly perform the grand *jiao* rites. We pray that your radiant light shines down, and your mysterious gaze descends upon us. Witness our sincere devotion and bestow upon us boundless blessings: dispelling disasters, averting misfortune, increasing emoluments, and prolonging years. May our names be erased from the ledgers of the underworld and inscribed in the registers of the living. May public and private affairs harmonize, and our families enjoy health and peace. May the living and the departed alike receive your grace and protection. We cannot express the fullness of our devotion.

**Prayer for the Pacification of a Residence by Hu Xian, Court Attendant**

I have heard that the *Yijing* presents its teachings through images, drawing from the principle of great strength. The sages established laws to replace the crude dwellings of old. The construction of halls and houses has been a constant from ancient times to the present. Their positions are determined by yin and yang, and their designs are shaped by the balance of punishment and virtue. The spirits are thus commanded, each to their duty. To defy them brings misfortune and calamity; to follow them brings good fortune and blessings.

Recently, my residence failed to shelter me from wind and rain. I took the opportunity to renovate it, making improvements as needed. Months passed, and the great work was completed. Yet I fear that in excavating earth and transporting stones, in raising the low and lowering the high, the tools may have trespassed where they should not, and the digging may have offended the spirits. Without performing the *jiao* rites of repentance and gratitude, I am constantly filled with apprehension and concern.

Moreover, the land on which my residence stands has seen five families succeed one another over the years, and its presiding spirits have changed many times. I worry that their consciousness lingers, still lingering in delay. Relying on this *jiao* rite, I pray that all may be elevated and released.

Thus, I have solemnly prepared the courtyard and reverently established the ritual altar. I invoke the talismans of the *Lingbao* scriptures, following the canons of the *Tai Xuan*. I beseech the true sages to descend and witness my sincerity.

I humbly pray that the Five Emperors and the host of spirits will look upon my devotion. May the envoys of the talismans be commanded to proclaim the decree to the earthly authorities. May the dragon spirits be pacified, and all offenses be dissolved. May misfortunes be eradicated, and true *qi* flow abundantly. May unmanifested calamities be averted, and new blessings be bestowed. May lingering *qi* of the dead and stagnant wandering souls be cleansed and relocated. From the seen to the unseen, may all find their rightful place. May the symbols of the Six Jia and Five Phases, the Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams, each rest in their proper domains, forever ensuring steadfast good fortune. May my household enjoy peace and prosperity, and may my diligent efforts in cultivation meet the favor of the true spirits. We cannot express the fullness of our devotion.

**Prayer for the Earth Net Rites by Hu Fan, Minister of Works**

I have heard that the Five Planets receive their essence from the cosmos, and the Three Powers take their positions in the universe. They bear the molding force of the Supreme Dao and are nurtured by the mysteries of the Highest Mystery. Yet as the cycles of time shift, yin and yang rise and fall. Fortune and misfortune alternate, and cold and heat follow their course. Adversity gives way to prosperity, and calamity is followed by blessing. This is the natural principle of all things, an unchanging truth.

How could I, in my mediocrity, dare to forget caution and reverence? Within my current year, I find myself in a period of misfortune. My great fate resides in the year of *jia-chen*, and my minor fate stands upon *ding-si*. Moreover, these two months coincide with the Earth Net region of the Four Palaces, and my own trigram’s position may bring about a convergence of misfortunes. There is no one to whom I can turn for expiation.

I further fear that the stars of my fate may align with adverse influences, and the flying banners of destiny may respond to changes. The Five Phases may clash, and the Three Destinies may weaken. Though the Horse of Post has arrived this year, I fear that calamity may still overcome fortune. Reflecting on my conduct and examining my heart, I recognize the need for repentance and prayer to express my earnest devotion.

Thus, I have selected an auspicious day to reverently prepare the *jiao* altar, inviting the descent of the august spirits in hope of their illumination. I humbly pray that the Three Officials and Five Emperors will look down upon my sincerity, and that the Lords of the Dipper and the Pole Star will bestow their boundless grace. May the register of extended life be bestowed, and blessings be granted. May the records of accumulated sins be burned, and my faults be pardoned. May disasters be dissolved in the Earth Net, and misfortunes be eradicated in the *Xun* Palace. May my lifespan be renewed, and my good fortune assured. May public and private affairs harmonize, and my family enjoy peace. May I forever receive your aid and protection, and never betray the blessings of the true spirits. We cannot express the fullness of our devotion.

**Prayer for the Rites of the Original Destiny on Xin-You Day by Yin Juhong**

Reverently considering: the Great Dao manifests its power, and the Three Spirits initiate all things. We receive our forms and destinies, and our marks and signs determine our lives. Our bodies are nurtured by the union of *kun* and *qian*, and our fortunes are aligned with the celestial and earthly bureaus. The Three Officials examine and record our deeds, leaving no sin or blessing unaccounted. The Five Emperors govern, and all matters of life and death are bound to them.

I, your humble servant, am but dust and ignorance, yet I have been blessed to serve this illustrious and enlightened age. My name is recorded in the central offices, and I stand among the inner ranks. In the presence of the phoenix and unicorn halls, I tread with shame, for my steps are many. Beneath the light of the sun and moon, I measure my limits and grow ever more fearful. My meager merits remain unnoticed, while my accumulated faults must be profound.

I constantly worry about the stains of past lives and the sins of this one. Without repentance and purification, how can they be absolved? Moreover, I fear that the Three Destinies, Five Phases, celestial patterns, and yearly fortunes may bring me misfortune or calamity. I may have offended the spirits and the lords who govern, or violated the teachings of benevolence, righteousness, mystery, and Confucianism. Perhaps I have harmed others for my own gain, or caused accidental injury through carelessness. My sins are easily accumulated, while my good deeds are difficult to accomplish. Perhaps my lifespan is short, or my emoluments meager.

Thus, on the day of my original destiny, I have prepared the *jiao* rites. Along with my prayers, I offer them to the enlightened spirits. Yet, as I have traversed perilous paths and witnessed the turmoil of the divine land, fleeing through forests and mountains or hastening along roads, I have endured five such journeys. There has been no time to perform the *jiao* rites, and my incense and lamps have been neglected. Sleep and sustenance have brought me no peace.

Now, as I bear the imperial command to the southwest, halting my steed at Min and Jian,
the roads lie unobstructed, and the passes and bridges stand wide open.
The emperor’s grace flows like celestial waves, reaching even the distant four frontiers;
joyous voices and radiant faces resound and shine throughout the land.
Moreover, this Lesser City is in truth a realm of immortals—
here, one may still the heart and offer earnest prayers,
here, one may invoke blessings and seek the true Dao.
Thus, I have divined an auspicious day, aligning it with my original destiny.
Bearing the tokens of faith, I prepare incense and flowers,
and at this very moment, I make up for the rites long neglected.
Sincerity reaches the spirits, and their divine insight must surely perceive it.
I humbly beseech that my crimson devotion be accepted,
and that vast blessings be bestowed in return.
May past vows be fulfilled, and new grace be granted anew.
May my disasters and misfortunes be dispelled, my official rank and lifespan extended.
May the living and the dead alike know peace, and all my kin and dependents be secure.
Above all, may the altars of state flourish and the cosmos be serene.
May the Three Luminaries follow their proper courses, and the Six Qi harmonize.
May martial might recede and civil culture thrive, the times be peaceful, and the people prosper.
May the imperial carriage return in triumph, and the dragon’s destiny be forever firm.
May all these prayers be answered in full, and the era of Great Peace be witnessed at last.

**Prayer for the Empress’s Original Destiny *Jiao* Rite**

I have heard that the Great Dao bestows its scriptures, and the Mysterious Origin propagates its teachings,
aiding the times and assisting the state, spreading transformation and delivering the people.
Its merits precede even the symbols of antiquity, its benevolence extends beyond all things.
As the sacred texts are revered in the highest courts,
the prayers of humanity must reach the heavens;
as celestial grace descends upon the earth,
the blessings of the true realm are surely granted.
All beings receive protection, great and small alike.

This year, my major destiny encounters the position of the Three Killers.
My minor destiny, governed by the Wood Branch, lies in decline and weakness.
The Celestial Stems and the tones of official rank are both obstructed by Earth.
The Flying Banners and Four Killers remain in the Tiger’s domain.
The Net Star treads the palace of my surname, while Saturn lingers in the constellation of discord.
Mars, in its course, approaches my life palace.
The year’s progression, moreover, falls under the Earth Net.
The physicians’ diagnoses reveal that my visceral *qi* remains unbalanced,
my constructive and defensive energies disharmonious, my vital *qi* depleted and thin.
The six pulses have not recovered, and the nine palaces remain weak.
I fear misfortune may arise, and my fate grow even more dire.
I also fear that from past lives, karmic debts remain unpaid,
and with each passing thought or action, new transgressions accumulate.
Thus, I must rely on these memorials and prayers, hoping they reach the spirits in repentance.

Therefore, in accordance with the luminous statutes, I have selected an auspicious day,
prepared the words of petition, and presented this memorial with reverence.
I beseech the celestial officials and divine soldiers to descend, witness, and protect me.
May my internal organs be at peace, and external misfortunes be averted.
Above, may the baleful influences of the stars be dissolved;
below, may the afflictions of my destiny and the harms of the year be erased.
May enmities be reconciled, and debts and disputes settled.
May the Six Qi flow freely, and the hundred passages be regulated.
May my frailty and peril be transcended, my lifespan and rank increased.
May the Northern Palace reverse my brief years,
and the Southern Culmen inscribe long life upon me.

I humbly implore the Perfect and Great Dao, the Three Supreme Ones,
to ever expand their compassionate salvation
and grant the blessings of peace and truth.
I vow to remain steadfast in loyalty and filial piety, to discipline body and mind.
To praise the enlightened ruler’s nurturing benevolence,
and repay the profound grace of the Dao’s creation and completion.

**Daoist Memorial for the Emperor’s *Jiao* to the Great One and the Kindling of the Golden Register Lamps**

I have heard that the One *qi* gave birth to all forms, and the myriad beings depend on it for their beginning.
On high, it suspended the celestial bodies, clearly distinguishing the firm and the yielding.
The power of governance rests with the Most Sagely.
Heaven commands the emperor to shepherd the people,
and the emperor receives Heaven’s mandate to rule over them.
At the dawn of the Regulator’s brilliance, the positions of ruler and minister were established;
in the age of abdication and warfare, both virtue and the Dao were practiced.
In times of peril, the mysterious virtue shines ever brighter;
in eras of decline, vast blessings spread ever wider.

The August Martial, Wise, and Filial Emperor of Great Shu,
his virtue matching the vast heavens, his merit extending to all living beings,
received the Mandate in accord with Qian,
eternally securing the Three Realms.
Divine intelligence aids his counsel, and the human world’s Jade Candle aligns with the seasons;
the rhythms of pitch and calendar harmonize, and the celestial Pearl Bag follows its proper measure.
The people flourish, and the years bring abundant harvests.
Auspicious omens and felicitous signs are recorded day and month.
Yet still, he labors by day and remains vigilant by night, reverently serving Heaven.
He honors the unseen and the manifest, toiling for the welfare of the millions.
His sole concern is to relieve the suffering of the people, his heart untouched by pleasure or distraction.
He ponders the myriad regions, ever striving for benevolence and longevity.

Recently, as the Four Spirits governed the course of destiny, they resided in the Palace of the Salty Pond.
The Directing Talisman descended upon the fields of the Hall of Light.
Warfare arose anew, yet swift victory was achieved.
Those traitorous rebels, who broke their oaths and plotted treason,
now face the ruin they sought—like drifting pestles or scorched trees.
This is the result of the spirits savoring his sagely virtue, Heaven aiding his imperial might.
The transformation of calamity into fortune is witnessed,
and the signs of national peace and prolonged destiny are revealed.

Now, as the year draws to a close and the seasons prepare to shift,
I give thanks for the profound grace bestowed thus far,
and pray for the bright blessings of the coming spring.
To repay his sagely efforts, I offer my utmost sincerity.
I kindle the divine lamps of the Golden Register and prepare the grand *jiao* of the River Chart.

I humbly beseech the Most High to witness and respond.
May the Ten Spirits ever bestow their radiant favor,
and for three years, may blessings be fully granted.
May the precious destiny endure forever, and the ancestral temples know peace.
May the emperor’s longevity match the Five Peaks, his brilliance equal the Two Luminaries.
May the Eight Directions submit to his transformation, and the myriad states rest in harmony.
May all attain the customs of the Dao, and the rebels of unruly lands be swept away.
May the Crown Prince shine with double brightness, and the civil teachings flourish.
May he assist in the sagely plans and extend the great enterprise.
May the six palaces and hundred officials unite in their support;
may the millions of people and the six armies all enjoy renewed well-being.
May the dragon spirits secretly guard him, and the rivers and mountains remain ever secure.
May the hidden and the manifest, the soaring and the sinking, forever receive his vast grace.

**Prayer for the Crown Prince’s Offering of the Grand Jiao and the Lighting of the Golden Register Lamp on Behalf of the Emperor**

We have heard that the mysterious transformation first divided, and the Two Modes took form. They fused and settled into the positions of yin and yang, while the divine and luminous wielded the power of governance. The Supreme Heavenly Worthy and the August Emperor of the Highest sit upon the Purple Tenuity, overseeing all, dispatching divine envoys to traverse the realm. Thus, the Five Phases and Eight Winds, Heaven’s One and Earth’s Two, stir the clouds and mists, riding the stars in their celestial courses. Gazing afar across the Nine Wilds, they secretly bestow admonitions; traversing all directions, they reveal omens of fortune and misfortune. From antiquity to the present, who would dare forget vigilance and self-cultivation?

Your servant, by the mandate of the Straight Talisman, resides in the Hall of Light; by the movement of the Four Spirits, occupies the position of the Completed Pond. It is fitting to purify and cleanse, to offer prayers with utmost sincerity.

The Emperor, receiving the mandate from the Supreme Mystery, grasps the talisman and inherits the lineage. He extends the transformation of magnanimity and frugality, fostering the foundation of purity and tranquility. He seeks to harmonize the Great Peace and bring well-being to the myriad states. Recently, neighboring domains betrayed righteousness, violating borders and breaking covenants. They ravaged the common people and encroached upon commanderies and cities. Yet swiftly, the malevolent were pacified, and all pernicious vapors dispelled. The command and guidance arose from sagely counsel, while divine power truly aided in the assistance.

Now, the frontiers are secure and serene, the Han’s borders purified and orderly. The stellar cycle has turned, and the year’s rhythm draws to a close. On this day of *ren-shen* in the month, the first dawn of the new year, we prepare the altar and reverently offer thanksgiving. We perform the Grand Jiao of the Supreme Unity and kindle the divine lamp of the Golden Register. Below, it illuminates the hidden passes; above, it reaches the Supreme Ultimate. It sweeps away accumulated calamities and stagnation, extending and bestowing blessings and felicity.

We humbly pray that the ancestral temples remain secure and prosperous, that the altars of soil and grain stand firm. May the precious chart endure forever, and the sagely longevity stretch afar. May he surpass the glory of the Fire Deities of the Cloud Palace, and transcend the legacies of the Han, Ji, and Zhou. May he swiftly achieve unification and attain Great Harmony. May the six palaces exemplify support, and the hundred officials unite in loyal sincerity. May the Three Luminaries shine brightly, and the Four Seasons harmonize. May the year bring abundant harvests, and the customs be free of pestilence. May the dragon spirits rejoice, manifesting the auspices of the Five Winds and Ten Rains; may the rivers and mountains flourish, flowing with the blessings of horse-drawn carriages and ritual vessels. May our earnest sincerity be made manifest, ascending to the true numina. We look up in prayer for the grace of their scrutiny and protection, that they may broadly bestow vast and enduring blessings.

**Prayer for the Jiao on Behalf of the Commander of Jingyuan Army on His Natal Day**

We reflect that the Supreme Way gives birth and completes, its mysterious work molding and shaping. It governs the lordship of yin and yang, distinguishing the categories of the myriad beings. All receive their essence and form, looking up to rely on divine transformation.

Your servant has been blessed to receive the shade of the Dao and has presumptuously borne the favor of the court. Clothed in the light of imperial grace, I oversee military affairs. Yet my merits and achievements remain unremarkable, while my dust-like transgressions run deep. Day and night, I examine and follow, daring not forget vigilance and exertion. Yet I fear that my cultivation may be lacking, my conduct often straying, accumulating faults and blemishes, without offering repentance and purification.

Perhaps the Five Phases and Three Destinies have their times of punishment; the Nine Luminaries and arrayed stars, their moments of scrutiny. Perhaps old grudges remain unresolved, or past debts unabsolved. The ways of the divine are inscrutable, and human understanding cannot fathom them. Thus, calamities and stagnation may arise, with no means to express remorse and seek forgiveness.

On this day of my natal destiny, I reverently offer the Jiao and libations. Following the statutes of the Heavenly Perfected, I prostrate myself and present the Great Petition. We humbly beseech the August and Sagely to respond, the True and Numinous to scrutinize and protect. May they perceive our earnest sincerity and bestow mysterious grace, dissolving calamities and leveling misfortunes, extending the span of life and increasing its blessings. May they secretly augment my official emoluments and broadly remit my transgressions. May they untie past enmities and bestow future blessings. I vow to devote myself to loyalty and filial piety, forever serving ruler and kin.

**The Emperor’s Prayer at the Jade Bureau Altar in the Dragon Prosperity Abbey**

We reflect that Heaven arrays the constellations, and Earth spreads its renowned regions. The resplendent symbols hang in the celestial net, while the blessed courts stand in the square marshes. The luminous wield their authority to protect the state and the household.

We note that the Jade Bureau and Terrace of Mystery is where the Primordial One descended in traces. Locked within this metropolis, it lies close to the city gates. Though the years have deepened, its numinous radiance does not fade. Its emptiness and stillness differ not from the forests and valleys, yet its auspicious influence often extends to the common people. We have always held it in reverence, never daring to forget our devotion.

Since we reverently received the mandate of Heaven and established the court, the vermilion gates and palace portals have been aligned with the proper yang positions; the frost altars and feathered halls have followed the appropriate reforms. Yet the stone chambers and grotto gates, the true image of the Venerable Lord, remain. Morning and evening, the rites of incense and candles are performed with utmost reverence. Approaching the dragon steps and phoenix gates, we redouble our purity and solemnity. This place can indeed share eternity with Heaven, enduring forever.

Yet we fear that the dragon spirits and officials of yin and yang, in their activities and disturbances, may have alarmed the multitude with their clamor. Having trodden upon and harmed them, we now offer prayers and repentance through the Jiao. From this auspicious day, we prepare the incense altar. Though our devotion may not reach far, the true numina will surely perceive it.

We humbly beseech the Primordial One to bestow protection, the Great Dao to open its grace. May they remit past transgressions and bestow future blessings. May the precious chart endure forever, and the altars of soil and grain remain secure. May wind and rain be harmonious, and the dragon spirits conciliatory. May calamities be swept away, and sins and faults leveled.

Should the Straight Talisman and Supreme Unity’s movements shift to other regions, or the Fire Star and Earth Star’s scrutiny fall upon our person, we pray that their power may turn to protect and sustain us, bringing clarity and peace to our humble self. May beacons not flare at the four borders, and pestilential vapors not afflict the people. We forever pledge our sincere devotion, offering it up to the mysterious bounty.

**Edict for the Jiao Offered to the Famous Mountains and Great Rivers**

We reflect that the Dao arrays the Three Realms, and Earth bears the multitude of beings. Some are the lands where immortals cultivate and refine, others the domains where perfected officials govern. Their numinous foundations are visible, their divine transformations boundless.

We reverently serve the Supreme Mystery and gloriously receive the great treasure. Looking down, we follow the regions, purifying our sacrifices. Recently, the affairs of state and military have been numerous, and weapons have been employed year after year. We have not yet been able to attend to all, and thus constantly harbor trepidation. We seek to express our reverence and devotion, hoping to dispel calamities and faults.

We now command the Daoist masters of the Three Caverns, together with the envoys dispatched, to solemnly prepare the jiao rites and secretly convey our supplications to the mysterious gaze of the Dao. May the four seasons be abundant, the six qi unassailing. May longevity be extended, the state and house flourish. May the imperial lineage and throne endure, the hundred ministers and thousand officials prosper, from the court within to the lands without, and may the multitudes of the realm all equally receive blessings and protection. With reverence, we entrust these blue petitions, humbly presenting our sincere devotion.

**Edict for the Jiao Offered to Master Zhang of Xianju Mountain**

The Emperor of Great Shu respectfully bows his head to Master Zhang, the Perfected One of Dao who attained transcendence on Mount Beimang. Of the exalted perfected of the Purple Palace and the lofty adepts of the Dark Continent—riding the whirlwind, mounting the void, seated in being yet dwelling in non-being—they ascend the boundless to roam in spirit, enter the primordial chaos to conceal their radiance. Some manifest their signs to the state and altars, aiding the people at large; others secretly assist emperors, jointly purifying adversity and obstruction. Li Shunxing preserved the tranquility of Emperor Jing, Tao Zhenbai lent his support to King Xiao. In the *zi* year, you subtly admonished the Prefect, hoping for the secret enlightenment of Emperor Zhaolie. Those who heed your counsel receive felicity and great fortune; those who disregard it court misfortune and sorrow. Your brilliance, inscribed on silk and bamboo, shines as brightly as the sun and moon.

Now, among the common folk, Guo Hui has gathered herbs at the Xianju Abbey and discovered a bronze tablet left by the Perfected One in the Tianbao era. Its sixty characters form a perfect cycle, with names and dates fully recorded; its two centuries of concealment remain intact, with coin inscriptions and seal scripts all preserved. The succession is clearly evident, the days and hours unerring.

Where lichen encroaches and earth erodes, divine generals must surely guard and preserve; the verification aligns with the tally, truly bearing the Perfected One’s manifestation. Reflecting upon the vast virtue, it openly accords with auspicious omens. This matter surpasses the *Red Hidden* and *Yellow Charts*; its principle excels the phoenix’s bearing and dragon’s burden. Having witnessed the decree of prolonged prosperity, how dare I forget the reverent and diligent heart? Thus, I establish the altar of offering, hoping to repay the profound virtue. Still, I clear the brambles and thorns, selecting an auspicious day to commence the work. May emerald railings and vermilion eaves renew the old site; may the towers of Chen and distant pillars once more recognize the path of return. Earnestly I pray to the Perfected Spirits, that they may witness this bright requital. From the distant Thirty-Six Heavenly Palaces, may their majestic radiance descend; through the fourteen thousand *jiazi* cycles, may I forever bear and revere. [Unworthy as I am...]

**Prayer of the Crown Prince at the Offering on Xianju Mountain**

I humbly consider: where sunlit chambers adjoin rosy clouds, there lies the celestial metropolis; where jade altars and cassia halls stand, there is the worldly court of fortune. Whether the abode where Perfected Sages feast and wander, or the dwelling where immortals and spirits reside, all conceal marvels and nurture excellence, unfolding blessings and flowing auspices, aiding and protecting humanity and heaven, subtly assisting the state. This ancient abbey indeed reveals extraordinary omens. It has received the Perfected Tally of the Tianbao era, revealed in the *Secret Records of Lord Lao*. Golden script and avian seals, seal characters coiled like dragons—distinct and luminous, the auspicious traces appear newly made; brushed clean, the lichen’s marks yet remain. Several millennia ago, it foretold the sage lord’s unfolding of the chart; two hundred years of prosperity await our emperor’s reign. Imperial name and dynastic surname, birth date and year—each is clearly set forth, layer upon layer of verification. The subsequent text records my humble virtue, listing names in full. Having examined the writings of the charts and registers, my reverent devotion grows ever more earnest. Gazing afar at the misty peaks, I look up in gratitude for the numinous grace. Thus, at this altar of libation, I nurture the distant aspiration to burn incense and cultivate the Dao. Above all, I wish that the grand foundation may be firmly established, boundless as the vast seas; that the sagely longevity may be prolonged, towering higher than Mounts Min and Emei. May the Nine Regions follow in harmonious transformation, may the myriad realms return to benevolence. I vow my sincere loyalty and filial piety, to match the protection of the Perfected Spirits. [Unworthy as I am...]

The *Ritual Hymn for the Emperor’s Offering at Mount Xianju*, Composed by Du Guangting, Grand Virtue of Literary Composition by Imperial Commission, Purple-Robed Bestowal, and Inner Attendant at the Supreme Clarity Palace in the Upper Capital

We humbly observe that sagely sovereigns and enlightened kings must attain auspicious omens, receiving the charts and registers amid songs of praise. Thus, enthroned in the majesty of a hundred million, they are deemed worthy of the Mandate of Heaven. Now, as Your Majesty approaches the sixth year of ascending the great throne, the transformative teachings have yet to bring peace to the living, and the distant frontiers still resist the true calendar. With trepidation and vigilance, You dare not rest in ease. You fear the inequity of punishments and the impropriety of rewards. Troops encamp across the plains, for the people’s prosperity remains unfulfilled; bleached bones fill the rivers, for the toll of slaughter knows no end. Ever mindful of these burdens, You seek to atone for transgressions and redeem faults. How could one dare speak of prophetic texts, when even the most learned remain unworthy?

This year, on the eighth day of the seventh month, Guo Jiongzhi, a commoner of Shifang County in Hanzhou, unearthed a bronze tablet while gathering herbs at the Abbey of Transcendent Dwelling. The tablet measured seven inches in length and four in width, inscribed with sixty characters:

*"The Record of Laozi’s Communication with Heaven states: In the ding-mao year, the king born in the jia-xu, yi-hai years shall enjoy two hundred years of life. The Son of Heaven: Wang Congjian, Wang Yuanying, Wang Wanggan, Wang Yue, Wang Ze, Wang Daoyi."*

The five characters in seal script remain undeciphered.

The text further states: *"At the Huazhang Hongdao Monastery north of Mang Mountain in Luozhou, [the tablet] was left during the Tianbao era."* This clearly heralds the advent of a sagely successor.

Reflecting upon my meager virtue, I am suddenly entrusted with such extraordinary auspices. It speaks of the prolongation of the celestial mandate and records the succession of descendants. Clutching this profound boon of the mysterious, I can only respond with trembling awe. Daring to pour forth my deepest sentiments, I humbly offer this sacrifice in gratitude.

May the sacred precincts of the morning court summon the famed mountains, each drawn by chariots of immortals, to partake together in this crimson sincerity. May the altars of state be secured, the people universally at peace. May wind and rain arrive without fail, and weapons be sheathed in lasting stillness. I rely wholly upon this numinous radiance, holding it deeply within my heart.

Respectfully submitted,
*The Emperor’s Ritual Text for the Libation of Divine Talismans in Repayment of Heavenly Grace*

I have heard that when Heaven bestows its favor, it manifests portents in the *Hetu* and *Luoshu*; when the Emperor models himself upon Heaven, he receives the mandate and bears the tally in accord with destiny. From antiquity to the present, this has been the ordained pattern, with the celestial mandate passing in succession.

My reign has chanced upon this mysterious fortune, yet my virtue remains shallow and dim. Following the decline of the Earthly Power, the myriad people were left without refuge; at the inception of the Golden Stem’s resurgence, the realm united in acclaim. Reverently upholding the *Tianbao* mandate, now in its sixth year.

I have ever risen before dawn to don my robes, and forgotten food until dusk. With trembling caution and reverent care, I serve the lofty heavens above. Now, bronze tablets bearing sacred script have emerged from an ancient temple, revealing the portent of the Supreme’s descent of blessings and fulfilling the sign of Heaven’s mandate received. My name and the cyclical year are fully inscribed—this was foreordained in the Nine Heavens, predetermined eons ago. The secret talismans shine forth, the true writ blazes in splendor, proclaiming the enduring of the august throne and manifesting the eternal design for posterity. Reflecting upon myself, I remain ever vigilant and awestruck. Reverently mindful of the divine gaze, I redouble my efforts in cultivation. Thus, with utmost solemnity, I conduct this sacred fast and turn in devotion to the Supreme Dao, praying that manifold blessings may harmonize and forever shelter the myriad realms.

Respectfully submitted,
*The Emperor’s Supplementary Libation Text for the Transformation of the Immortal Ge’s Natal Essence*

I have heard that the constellations adorn the heavens, and the mountains stand sentinel over the earth. Through them, the workings of qi and the signs of fortune are conveyed to bless the state and the household. Whenever I perform the rites of distant reverence, I invariably invoke renewed blessings. Now, as the Emperor, I have received Heaven’s mandate, grasped the tally in accord with destiny. This mountain of my natal destiny is none other than this sacred site of transformation. Its caverns cradle clouds and rain, its peaks clash with mist and rosy dawn—surely potent numina reside here, secretly aiding and sustaining. Moreover, as this propitious season arrives, I duly prepare the libation and prayers. With uplifted heart and reverent devotion, I humbly await the radiant gaze of the divine.

May the Most Holy Ones of the myriad heavens look down and perceive my sincerity; may the Three Perfected and the host of immortals together bestow their boundless grace. May the imperial destiny endure forever, and the altars of state flourish in prosperity. May the twenty-four peaks bear witness to the Emperor’s sacred longevity, and the imperial foundation stand firm for a hundred thousand myriad years. May the Four Seas and the Nine Provinces all submit to the transformative influence of his wisdom. May the five weapons be sheathed, and the hundred grains ripen in abundance. May all ascend to the realm of benevolence and longevity, and together embrace the true and orthodox Dao.

A Memorial Prayer by Vanguard King Chenglu for the Nine Luminaries Ritual on Behalf of His Grandmother

Of the arrayed Luminaries and Five Phases, each governs sin and fortune. From the roofbeam to the eaves, all things have their overseers. In the course of birth and nurture, how could there be no ominous or auspicious responses in protection? Within the dwelling, transgressions and flaws must surely exist. We must rely on the Dao’s power and the profound efficacy of the unseen to dissolve deep calamities and grave faults.

The Primordial Sovereign established the teachings, and the Three Caverns transmitted the scriptures. Daring to follow the canonical procedures, I humbly pray for blessings and protection.

Your servant’s grandmother, the Grand State Lady of the Dai Clan, née [X], is now eighty years of age, born on the thirteenth day of the third month in the yi-mao year, at the wu-wu hour. At present, the Earth and Fire Luminaries reside in the triply harmonious quadrant, while the Celestial Talisman and Flying Banners strike against the great fortune of her life’s course. The Five Earths overpower her Water Child, and this affliction coincides with her birth hour. From such penal clashes, a minor ailment has arisen. Trembling with anxiety and dread, I dare not rest at ease.

I reflect that, though I have been favored to serve in this sagely age and inherit a legacy of blessings, I was early orphaned and bereft, and later endured family hardships. Only my grandmother’s compassionate countenance has allowed me to attend her morning and evening. With heart carved out and sincerity poured forth, I vow to pray for her distant years. Yet now her illness—a goiter—persists, as inauspicious stellar influences continue to cast their light. I fear that within this dwelling, some offense may have been committed, or that across generations, unpaid karmic debts may linger. Perhaps among the departed, there remains some unresolved grievance, or in the hidden yin realms, some indictment awaits. From these accumulated frailties and perils, I can but seek repentance and absolution.

Thus, I have selected an auspicious day and reverently prepared the ritual altar. May the Great Dao shed its radiance, and the host of honored ones look down with compassion. For your servant’s grandmother, née [X], dissolve the afflictions of disaster and fault, and extend the span of her years. Augment her official emoluments in the Southern Palace, and expunge her name of guilt in the Northern Bureau. Sweep away her illness and infirmity, and harmonize the texture of her flesh. May divine medicines secretly sustain her, and numinous officers guard her in secret. Grant her full recovery and everlasting peace. May her household forever abide in auspicious harmony, with dragon spirits standing guard and all evil vanishing away.

I can but strive to cultivate virtue in earnest, seeking to repay the mysterious workings of the Dao. I am unworthy.

The Prayer for Rain at Mount Qingcheng by the Prince of Shu

Of the Five Marchmounts, the Supreme Office presides over the Palace of Zhen in Yue. Mighty as the Celestial Kingdom, towering as the Immortal Capital, it stands in majestic grandeur, anchoring the earth below and propping the vault of heaven above. Here the numinous spirits convene, revered by both land and water. Its bounty nurtures all quarters, its embrace enfolds the Three Shu. Sunlit cliffs scatter the rays of day, while shadowed ravines harbor the clouds. When it aids the seasons, omens of blessing descend; when it aligns with sagely rule, auspicious signs multiply. From antiquity to the present, from near to far, all look up to it in veneration and rely upon it in trust.

I, unworthy, have been graced with sagely compassion and entrusted with the governance of this vital domain. My jurisdiction extends over the lands of Zisu and Qian, and the borders of Wei, Lu, Man, and Dan. My rank is the highest in the court, my duties those of generals and ministers. Yet I ever fear that my merits are slight while my blessings are profound, that fortune may give rise to calamity. Bound by duty, I tremble with vigilance, my heart heavy with concern.

Since the advent of spring, the sweet rains have failed to arrive on time. The fields yield no harvest, and the scorching sun harms all living things. Though I have repeatedly performed sacrifices and entreated the gods, dense clouds gather only over the western outskirts, while the life-giving rains do not moisten the southern fields. The people, in their distress, find no recourse.

I recall that the Great Dao has bequeathed its scriptures, and the Heavenly Master has expounded his teachings. There are protocols for memorials and rites for prayer and offering. To conduct these devotions, one must rely upon sacred efficacy. Therefore, I lay bare my heart before the cloud-wreathed caverns and bow my head upon the immortal peaks. I await the response of the true companions and hope that my sincere plea may ascend.

Grant me timely harmony and abundant harvests, deliver me with rains that follow my wish and winds that comply. Banish the plump demons to the barren wilds, and let the rain-dancing *shangyang* birds prance within my realm. Let the tribes of the cliffs and the peoples of the caves beat their drums to display their might; let the dragon spirits of the grotto-palaces shake the numinous caverns to aid transformation. Dispel the cruel drought-demons and revive the withered seedlings. May the fragrance of millet and grain be pleasing, and the hopes for granaries overflowing be fully met.

I shall strive with all my heart to govern justly and exert myself in service of the public. Above all, I seek to repay the divine compassion and receive the protection of the Dao.

I respectfully dispatch You Du, Marshal of the Palace Guard, Acting Minister of the Right of the Department of State Affairs, and former Prefect of Lizhou, Cao Yue, along with the Grand Master of Vast Teaching of the Left and Right Streets, Purple-Robed Du Guangting, to conduct the rites of prayer and offering with utmost sincerity, placing their trust in the hope of grace.

I am unworthy.

Prayer for Rain by Ge Xianhua, Prince of Shu

Humbly considering that the twenty-eight lunar mansions hang in the heavens, their patterns fixed in place, while the twenty-four mountain spirits guard the earth, their images arrayed to divide the numinous. The constellations govern the unseen and the manifest, and all transformations oversee sin and fortune. How much more so the Heart Mansion, which is the palace of the Celestial Sovereign, and the Supreme Clarity, which is the capital of the immortals? Far-reaching, it commands the long rivers, leaning against the jade peaks’ towering beauty; majestic, it overlooks the great screen of mountains, facing the fertile lands of the Bronze Horse. That distant blessed realm casts its broad shade over Yong and Shu.

This minister’s life is bound to this mountain, yet undeservedly I grasp the jade tablet of office and still dwell in this immortal domain. Ever fearful that my rank is lofty and my duty weighty, while my strength is scant and my talent slight, I oversee the five noble ranks with distant enfeoffment and govern the six garrisons as my charge. At times, rewards and punishments miss their mark; at others, governance and nurture fall out of harmony. Below, there is resentment and sighing; above, the nurturing virtue is impaired. Anxious and uneasy, I have no respite, and faults and transgressions swiftly follow.

Since the second month of spring, timely rains have failed. Dust chokes the fields and ridges, the scorching sun flaunts its might. Winds parch the outskirts and plains, and oily clouds hide their form. The people sigh in distress, fearing the loss of the year’s labor; the fish in ponds and streams gasp, soon to hang in the drying stalls. My thoughts are consumed with this burning concern, yet I have no means to knock and beseech.

As for the finest delicacies, they are fully arrayed before the temple’s visage; the fat and plump sacrificial animals are offered without stint in prayer. Yet though I exhaust my sincere heart, no response is heard. Looking up, I recall that the immortals aid all beings, making no distinction between the hidden and the manifest. The Great Dao cherishes life, universally bestowing its compassionate grace. The Supreme Lord established the rites of expiation, and the Three Heavens opened the protocols of prayer and offering.

Reverently gazing toward the divine peak, I humbly present my mortal plea. With utmost devotion, I conduct the grand offering, looking up to implore the Perfected Ones. Humbly I pray that you take pity on what I have laid forth and grant me the great private grace of forgiveness. Pardon my faults and transgressions, and bestow upon me good fortune. Let thunder and lightning display their might, and the dragon spirits rejoice. May the abundant rains soak the land, bringing about a bountiful harvest. Let the Southern Mountains resound with the hissing of serpents, and the eastern fields flourish with lush crops. May the year’s expectations be forever harmonized, and the harvests truly abundant for years to come.

I vow to diligently uphold the rites of service, to fully repay the true spirits’ favor. I am unworthy.

*Prayer for the Zhou Tian Offering by Zhao Yu, Magistrate of Shifang*

Humbly considering that heaven and earth divide the numinous, and what governs them is the Most Sagely; that the unfathomable workings of yin and yang are embodied by the Most Divine. They preside over life and death, overseeing sin and fortune, responding to every prayer and connecting with every plea.

Undeservedly, by lack of talent, I govern this troubled district. The taxes and corvée it bears are heavy, and its collection and oversight are difficult. The villages and hamlets are impoverished and desolate, making governance and pacification all the more urgent. I purify my heart to seek remedies and restrain myself to serve the public. Through the power of the Dao, I have silently received the aid of the true spirits. Their hidden assistance has helped in collecting taxes and completing the district’s affairs. The land is at peace, plagues and poisons do not intrude, and the people live in tranquility.

Thinking to repay this mysterious grace, all have exhausted their sincere devotion. Together, we honor the altar of the Yellow Register and reverently prepare the rites of incense and prayer. We also conduct the grand offering to repay the divine favor.

Moreover, this district borders the immortal mountains, and its people embrace the transformative power of the Dao. The divine merits of Minister Li remain evident, and the sacred power of Perfected Luo often manifests. They command the blessed realms of the various abbeys and mark the true seats of the two transformations. Surely, they will cast their luminous gaze upon us and accept this sincere prayer.

Humbly I pray that the Supreme Lord extend his compassion and that the host of spirits grant their protection. May they universally aid the hidden and the manifest, extending their grace to the living and the dead. May all be blessed with good fortune and receive salvation and aid. Let this region be peaceful and serene, and the hundred grains flourish in abundance. May plagues, warfare, and weapons never intrude. May all creatures, whether soaring or crawling, each attain safety.

May my nine generations of ancestors and seven generations of descendants ascend to heaven and receive blessings; may those in the three evil destinies and the nine nights of darkness depart from suffering and join the Perfected. Furthermore, I beseech that disasters and calamities be erased, sins and transgressions be swept away. May my official emoluments and lifespan be silently increased, and my years be preserved. Together, we exert our hearts and minds, all receiving vast protection.

I am unworthy.

**Invocation for the Five Talismans to Pacify Wang’s Residence in Jiazhou**

It is heard that the Great Dao sheds its radiance, and the Five Scriptures bestow their teachings. They condense the qi of spontaneity, forming the texts of emptiness and profundity. Above, they rectify the celestial origin; below, they stabilize the terrestrial order. At the center, they govern the kalpas; on all sides, they bless living beings. Revered by the Three Realms, obeyed by the myriad spirits.

Should there be a place where construction stirs earth and timber, unwittingly offending the divine or openly transgressing prohibitions, all rely on these secret talismans to pacify the directions.

I, having recently required the building of my dwelling, have now completed this great endeavor and thus prepared these rites of incense and devotion. I have established an altar of the Yellow Register, widely offering repentance and deliverance; I have performed the libations of the Five Talismans, fully employing them to secure peace and tranquility.

I humbly implore the boundless compassion of the Most High and the penetrating gaze of the Perfected. May the dragon spirits rest in serenity, and all disasters and faults be dispelled. May there forever be no fear of offense, and may we constantly enjoy the blessings of peace.

As for the deities who have long governed the five clans, may each attain rebirth and together receive deliverance. Thus, I look up to bear the immeasurable grace of the Great Dao.

**Invocation for the Nine Luminaries Offering by Minister Zhang**

It is heard that the Great Dao condenses its radiance, and the Supreme Mystery manifests its signs. It illumines the nine lands and nurtures all living beings. It records fortune and misfortune, discerning sin and blessing. All things, great and small, are examined; not even the finest detail is overlooked.

Yet the Golden Tablets transmit their texts, and the Jade Scriptures expound the Dharma. They open the path of repentance and supplication, and establish the rites of remorse and gratitude. With sincere devotion, one is surely granted manifest protection.

I, so-and-so, considering my own emptiness and insignificance, have encountered this fateful conjunction. My position reaches the heights of the imperial court, and my duties are heavy and pressing. In reviewing lawsuits and adjudicating punishments, I may err in weighing severity and leniency, fearing the accrual of faults. Or, in my thoughts and concerns, I may inadvertently incur resentment. Or, through past lives and this existence, I may not have dispelled karmic debts. Reflecting in quietude, I am ever filled with trepidation.

Now, as the star of Saturn transits the Palace of Obstruction, and Ketu approaches my station, Mars—god of war—stands in opposition. My birth month and life position both coincide with celestial portents. From these inauspicious alignments, calamities have arisen. With a trembling heart, I prostrate myself in devotion. Looking up to the celestial signs, I knock in supplication; with utmost sincerity, I offer libations.

I humbly beseech the Perfected and Supreme Saints, the exalted Nine Luminaries. Moved by compassion for the mortal realm, may you descend your grace and pardon. Release past grievances and karmic debts; absolve grave transgressions and deep flaws. Prolong my years, and dissolve all disasters. Grant me harmony in all functions, balance in the six qi, complete relief from misfortune, and total freedom from illness and suffering.

May I, in loyalty and service, forever repay the sagacious ruler’s favor; in purity and concentration, fully respond to the protection of the revered spirits.

**Invocation for the Three Primordials Offering**

Most High and Boundless Great Dao, Original Celestial Honored One; Supreme Great Dao Lord; Most High Lord Lao; Ten Directions’ Spontaneous Numinous Treasure Celestial Honored Ones; Five Elders, Lords of the Three Primordials; Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water; Thirty-Six Divisions of Revered Scriptures; Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center; Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate, Dharma Masters of the Three Heavens; True Spirits of the Heavenly, Earthly, and Watery Bureaus of the Three Realms; and all divine offices of the Mysterious Administration.

We, humble and insignificant in this dusty world, have accumulated blessings through past lives. Having encountered the mysterious transformation, we now serve the Perfected.

**Prayer for the Three Primordials Offering**

Yet dwelling in the mortal realm, our bodies are ensnared by worldly nets. Adrift in the tides of fame and profit, we wander through cycles of life and death. We have not yet fathomed the source of transcendence, merely admiring the principles of purity and emptiness. The six passions and three karmic actions constantly weave threads of transgression. Dark ledgers and black records swiftly accumulate faults and offenses. Some bear unresolved grievances from past lives, still bound to the gates of darkness. Unintentional harm or mistaken killings remain unconfessed and unexpiated. Or the five phases and three destinies bring calamitous alignments, with malevolent stars and baleful spirits encroaching. Common understanding cannot fathom these, nor can prayers of supplication find recourse. The Three Primordials have their appointed times of judgment, and the Five Emperors lack rites for ascending to clarity. Even the nine generations of ancestors and seven lineages may yet languish in the three evil paths. Accusations and litigations drag on, while errors and transgressions pile high. When blessings are exhausted and misfortune arrives, where can one turn for repentance?

On this day of the official’s audit and recording, we collectively present this offering rite. May the Mysterious Mirror turn to us, gazing down upon our sincere devotion. Bestow blessings and extend grace, preserving life and safeguarding destiny. Open the path for the nine generations, erasing their names from the right-hand ledger of sins. Dissolve all calamities, inscribing our names in the left-hand palace of life. May we forever receive the response of the Dao, eternally bearing its boundless favor.

Above, may the imperial throne endure, prolonging the great mandate of heaven. May the mysterious peace bring harmony to all living beings, near and far, in tranquil security. May the nine grains flourish abundantly, and the five weapons of war be stilled. May the suffering souls of the nine darknesses and six destinies all receive the vast and forgiving grace, each attaining the freedom of their true nature.

We cannot express the full extent of our reverent devotion and repentant pleas. With utmost sincerity, we present this prayer.

**Prayer for the Six Jia Registers by Wang Zongzhuan and Others at the Lower Assembly**

We, your humble servants, have long been of mediocre and shallow capacity, yet our aspirations yearn for the profound mysteries. We concentrate our minds upon the wondrous Dao, surrendering ourselves to the true vehicle. We study the sacred texts of the six Jia, admiring the essential principles of longevity. Yet, bound by official duties and worldly reputations, we have been unable to devote ourselves fully to cultivation. On the days of the Three Primordials and the four beginnings of the year, incense and lamps may be lacking; at the gatherings of the five fasts and six yang days, our attention may not be wholly fixed. We fear that unintentional harm or mistaken injuries persist, along with unresolved grievances from past lives. Or our current years may be afflicted by calamitous alignments, or our natal stars may face disastrous periods. Without having performed proper repentance, our anxieties only deepen.

Daring to choose this auspicious day of the lower assembly, we present this offering and register, beseeching your grace. We humbly implore the exalted Five Emperors to descend and bestow auspicious blessings. May the true officials of the six Jia wash away our transgressions and blemishes. Inscribe our names in the heavenly registers of the living, erasing our names from the earthly ledgers of the dead. May our entire households receive protection, and our seven generations of ancestors ascend to heaven. May our official salaries and lifespans be extended, and public and private affairs remain steadfast and peaceful. We vow to perpetually burn incense in gratitude for the mysterious compassion.

We cannot express the full extent of our devotion.

**Prayer for the Three Assemblies on Behalf of Disciples**

We, your humble servants, bear the weight of the great Dharma, spreading and upholding the true teachings to enlighten and deliver celestial and mortal beings. We transmit the Dao and convey the scriptures, aiding the times and enacting transformation. Your disciples, so-and-so and others, have long admired the great Dao, surrendering themselves to the Perfected. We uphold and believe in the mysterious regulations, receiving and bearing the talismans and registers. Since their transmission, years have passed. Yet we fear that before receiving the Dao and after bearing the registers, in our conduct and intentions, we may have committed transgressions. The three karmic actions and ten celestial paths may have been wantonly marred by errors; the Three Primordials and eight seasonal nodes may not have been duly honored. Our natal year, geng-shen, may have seen lapses in cultivation. Perhaps we have consumed meat and blood, defiling the true and pure. Or we may have indulged in excessive desires, violating the precepts and prohibitions. Without the three assemblies, it would be difficult to fully repent and pray.

Now, on this day of the assembly and the time of audit and review, we jointly present this great offering, submitting this memorial to declare our merits. We repent before the Ten Heavens, surrendering our sincerity to the Three Treasures. We beseech the cleansing of past calamities and the absolution of all transgressions. May our names be recorded in the ledgers of good deeds and inscribed in the palaces of the living. May enmities be reconciled and debts settled. May the true qi flourish within, bringing joy to all faculties. May the numinous officials guard us without, dissolving all evil. Within the five phases and three destinies, and amid the dark and bright stars, may no baleful influences ever descend, and may disasters and misfortunes forever cease. May the nine generations of ancestors ascend to heaven, and the six relations receive blessings. May public and private affairs be upright and auspicious, and all movements and stillness be healthy and fitting. May our lifespans be extended and our blessings vast. We vow to cultivate diligently, repaying the mysterious grace above.

We cannot express the full extent of our devotion.

**Petition for the Emperor’s Natal Rites**
*Presented by Du Guangting, Grand Master of Imperial Edicts, Purple-Robed Eminence of Supreme Virtue, and Inner Offering Attendant of the Supreme Clarity Palace in the Upper Capital*

To the Boundless Dao of the Supreme, the Venerable Lord Lao, the Five Elder Thearchs, the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water, the Four Directors of the Celestial Bureaus, the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper, the August Jade Emperor of the Highest Mystery, the Sacred Peaks and River Deities, the Earthly Courts, and the Host of Celestial Spirits of the Sexagenary Cycle:

We humbly submit: when the Two Qi shaped form and the Five Phases framed appearance, we received the virtue of the Great Dao’s creation and the grace of the Primordial Harmony’s nurturance. As for the rise and fall of life’s register, the abundance or meagerness of official emolument, the fortune or misfortune of personal conduct, and the auspiciousness or inauspiciousness of one’s fate—all are governed from above by the celestial offices and determined laterally by the natal destiny. Every assessment, great or small, is meticulously recorded.

Your servant has long been favored with profound blessings, reverently inheriting the mysterious grace. Charged with upholding the celestial mandate and responding to the times with governance, I am ever mindful of my unworthy virtue, which may fail to inspire, and fearful that rewards and punishments may err. Thus, I am filled with trepidation, steering this fragile vessel with utmost care. Relying solely on divine power, I seek to bring peace to the people.

Therefore, with a mind turned inward, I bow before the sacred altar, hoping that the power of the Dao may secretly aid me and that the numinous perfected may invisibly assist. May the five weapons of war be stilled, the hundred grains flourish in abundance, the realm within and without enjoy harmony, and all living beings dwell in ease. I vow to devote myself to cultivation, repaying the mysterious compassion above.

I cannot fully express the depth of my reverence.

**Petition for the Crown Prince’s Natal Rites**

We humbly submit: the Great Dao scatters its radiance, and the Heavenly Origin spreads its transformations, giving rise to the myriad forms and nurturing the Three Powers. Thus, true officials are commanded to oversee the registers of destiny. The waxing and waning of the Five Phases all derive from divine power, and the rise and fall of the Three Lives all stem from the numinous treasury.

Your servant has long been bathed in profound grace, occupying a position in the Eastern Palace. In attending to meals and inquiring after well-being, I strive to fulfill my duties with reverence; in cultivating loyalty and filial piety, I can never fully repay the kindness of sovereign and father. Therefore, on this day of my natal destiny, I humbly prepare the rites of offering and prayer.

May disasters be averted and transgressions repented, blessings augmented and prosperity prolonged. May the sacred person enjoy boundless longevity, the great enterprise endure in peace; may a thousand auspicious signs descend upon the precious destiny, and the flourishing age be eternally served. With utmost sincerity, I dare to hope for mysterious protection.

I cannot fully express the depth of my devotion.

**Petition for the Nine Palaces of the Celestial Patterns by Attendant Censor Cui Yin**

We humbly observe: when the Supreme Mystery suspends its patterns, the Seven Governors follow their cycles; when the earth below turns its mechanism, the Nine Palaces take flight in transformation. Through their traversal, they reveal fortune and misfortune. Thus, the Three Lives and Five Phases bring responses of disaster or blessing, while the odd and even of yin and yang manifest signs of good and evil.

This year, the flying banners of the Nine Palaces alight upon the central position, and the celestial tally descends upon my birth sign; the Five Stars proceed in their courses, with Mars opposing my natal palace. My current year falls in the region of the Earthly Net, and both major and minor destinies suffer clashes. Illness has arisen, and recovery has not yet been attained.

Daring to approach the gate of the Great Dao’s compassionate salvation and follow the Supreme’s decree for offering and prayer, I lay bare my heart before the numinous altar, gazing upward in reverence. I universally proclaim my devotion to the celestial patterns and repent before the host of perfected spirits.

I humbly implore the Six Sages of the Southern Palace to open the scriptures of long life and bestowed fortune, and the Seven Primes of the Northern Dipper to grant the power to avert death and descend blessings. May my official years be extended, and disasters dissolved. May the distant and eternal be revealed, and the brief and fleeting reversed. May the hundred faculties be at ease, and the Six Qi harmonized. May past debts and former grievances be released, and deep flaws and grave transgressions pardoned. May the Nine Mysteries bestow fortune, and my entire clan dwell in peace.

With a heart of diligent cultivation, I seek to repay the protection of the august spirits.

I cannot fully express my devotion.

**Petition at the Stone Inscription of the Venerable Lord Lao at the Stone Wall Abbey of the Mysterious Origin in Langzhou**

We humbly submit: this is a numinous capital of creation, a sacred realm of immortals. Its peaks soar across the sky, its emerald cliffs rise by the river’s edge. Before the misty peaks, the sacred ancestor’s divine presence emerges; within the pine and bamboo groves, the jade lads’ true forms stand revealed. No carving or painting could achieve this—it is the marvel of heaven and earth’s natural art.

Thus, its hidden streams flow with radiance, bestowing blessings upon those in need. It often averts disasters of drought and flood, bringing timely responses of prosperity. Yet today, the imperial carriage lingers by the Han shallows, and the road to the Qin plains remains distant. I pray to the luminous might of the Mysterious Ancestor and the far-reaching grace of the divine descendants, that the myriad households may be purified and the grasses and trees thrive in peace.

May it not be that by the bridge over the Yi River, only the remnants of Pang Xun’s faction are swept away, or by the shrine on Mount Huo, only the forces of Liu Wu are crushed. With reverence, I await the mysterious power to flourish the great mandate.

I cannot fully express my hope and devotion.

**Petition at Tianmu Mountain in Xianzhou**

We humbly submit: this mountain anchors the earth’s heart, its cavern opening the celestial eye. It harbors mist and rain, stores wind and thunder. Its cliffs conceal immortal scriptures, its springs clarify the numinous pools. The abbey’s name reflects the beauty of Fufu, and the town’s title bears the honor of "Serving the State." Through this prayer, blessings are surely secured.

Now, as the jade carriage moves in accord, the vermilion palace suffers calamity. I humbly seek the invisible assistance of the perfected, together inaugurating the destiny of restoration. May the Mysterious Ancestor’s profound power be displayed anew, dazzling the double-pupiled; may the teachings of the Four Instructions of Master Xuan be proclaimed, enlightening the fourfold vision.

May it not be that on Mount Shouchun, tales of martial aid still linger, or before the Ji Shun Shrine, only the welcome of the imperial carriage is celebrated. May the Dao’s transformation be magnified, and the true wind spread far.

I cannot fully express my reverent hope and devotion.

**Petition for the Great Rites of the Three Primes by the Empress**

We humbly observe: the Dao’s transformations shape all things, and divine power nurtures them. The Qi divides into the Two Images, bestowing the private grace of encompassing and sustaining; the Three Primes unfold their seasons, determining the handles of reward, punishment, and retribution. Thus, the Northern Capital’s Yellow Springs often serve as the season of judgment and pardon, while the Southern Culmen’s Literary Prosperity frequently bestows the grace of transcendence and ascent.

Within human relations, fortune and misfortune, good and evil all manifest. With sincere devotion, I have received profound favor.

Your servant, by fortune’s grace, has enjoyed prosperity and walked a flourishing path. Occupying the vermilion palace, I assist in stabilizing the imperial destiny. Yet I am ever mindful of my inadequate virtue, which fails to repay such extraordinary grace, and fearful that past lives and accumulated existences may harbor unresolved flaws. The Five Phases and Three Lives may yet bring calamities, with Mars approaching my natal palace and the celestial tally residing on my birthdate.

Fearing the onset of calamity and misfortune, my resolve is fixed upon repentance and prayer. As this is the season of the Great Amnesty of the Middle Prime, a time when all under heaven yearn for grace, I humble my heart before the numinous altar, bowing my head in reverence. I traverse the halls of the true spirits to offer sincerity, hoping for their turning gaze and protection; I prostrate before every divine court to bare my earnest plea, wishing for the release of transgressions and faults. May Zhou be granted peace in karmic debts and the washing away of sins and blemishes. May disasters dissolve, years and blessings be prolonged, illness and distress find no purchase, and fortune and felicity gather in abundance. May the ninefold ancestors and sevenfold progenitors ascend to the ranks of the immortals’ courts. May kin and relations all bask in the glory of the sagely sun. Above all, may the ancestral temple stand secure, the sagely lifespan stretch afar, the Purple Forbidden Palace and the Eastern Palace uphold the great enterprise, and the bulwark of the realm, steadfast as bedrock, safeguard the grand foundation. May all officials be bound in loyalty and integrity, and the myriad subjects be gathered under benevolent rule. With utmost devotion, I offer these prayers, placing my vast hopes in the mysterious compassion. I cannot but prostrate myself, gazing to heaven and longing for the sagely presence.

*Memorial of Zhao Qiu, Minister of Education, Offering a Ritual for Illness*

I have heard that the wondrous response knows no bounds, for the Dao extends its aid to all things. The mysterious compassion flows widely, bestowing kindness upon all living beings. It opens the gate of prayer, repentance, and absolution, and extends deliverance to those in distress who seek grace. Its works are accomplished without self-regard, and its blessings spread without limit. Daring to rely upon this all-embracing benevolence, I now pour forth my plea in devotion.

Your servant reflects upon his fortune and prosperity, having been honored to serve in a flourishing era. From the ranks of the imperial escort, I ascended the path to the misty heights. My merits are slight, yet my responsibilities weighty; my contributions few, yet the grace bestowed upon me profound. Ever mindful of this, I am filled with trepidation, finding it difficult to repay such favor. Recently, afflicted by calamity and stricken by illness, I have received the sagely concern that brings comfort, and the dispatch of renowned physicians to attend me. Yet recovery has not come, and my anxiety only deepens.

I reflect that my life has been spent in the dusty world, long neglectful of cultivation. In conduct and action, how could I avoid faults and transgressions? At times, I may have harmed living things without pity; at others, wielded the sword in battle, lightly ordering executions. In commanding troops, I may have failed to issue just commands; in governance, erred in rewards and punishments. In the still of night, enmities may have arisen, and in my humble person, lingering illness taken root. Moreover, I fear that across past lives and accumulated existences, unresolved offenses may yet linger. The Five Phases and Nine Luminaries may converge in misfortune. Perhaps in construction, I have trespassed against the unseen; in earth and timber, caused unwitting harm. Searching my heart and examining my faults, my repentance and prayer are only the more urgent.

Thus, I dare to present this precious memorial and conduct a grand ritual, humbly informing the spirits of the earth below and invoking the deities of the heavens above. I implore the Great Dao to extend its compassion, the Perfected True Ones to grant their protection. May the spirits who govern calamity and deliverance from distress dissolve my disasters; may the gods who bestow blessings dispel my illness and prolong my life. May my name be stricken from the registers of the dead in the courts of the underworld and inscribed in the records of immortals in the world above. May past injuries and unintended killings be reconciled, karmic debts pacified. May new sins and old blemishes be cleansed by the mysterious compassion. I vow to redouble my resolve and forever walk in gratitude for the Dao’s grace.

*Memorial of Zhang Daoheng for the Consecration of the Northern Dipper’s Seven Perfected Star Lords*

Your servant, from tender years, has reverently heard of the Great Dao. My heart has turned to the Dipper’s pole, and my thoughts fixed upon the mysterious void.

Every time I have made prayers, I have been graciously blessed. The boundless favor of the spirits fills me with gratitude, yet I find no means to repay such vast beneficence. Now, having divined an auspicious day—when the virtue of Heaven aligns with the propitious hour—I shall, within the Hall of the Northern Emperor of the Jade Bureau, sculpt the august form of the Central Dipper’s Pole Star. Together with its attendant stars, they shall be arrayed in their eightfold positions. Their robes shall shimmer with rainbow hues, their divine visages shaped like dragons and cranes. Set before the Great Emperor, they shall stand as if gathered in the midst of heaven. I have prepared this memorial to announce the undertaking and now command the work to commence. May the Seven Saints deign to descend, and may the host of spirits grant their luminous protection. May their response endure forever, and may blessings and felicity abide without end. May all hearts find a gateway for their prayers, and may all beings discover the path of refuge. I shall forever reverently tend the incense and flame, in gratitude to the Perfected Ones.

*Memorial of Du Yuanji, Court Attendant, for the Consecration of the Fire Star*

I have heard that the yang spirit manifests auspicious signs, and the virtue of Fire receives the mandate of Heaven. It divides the realm of the sun to extend its light, governing the southern quadrant and establishing its position. Thus, in the Xia calendar, it regulates the year’s labors. Thereby, it moves through the crimson heavens and cycles along the Yellow Way. Its responses are never without cause, and its judgments are impartial. Though its celestial image shines brightly, casting its influence upon all states, its dispensation of disaster or blessing extends even to the most minute. I, undeserving, have been favored with profound grace and walk in this flourishing era. Though I strive to conduct myself with purity, I have not yet attained a state free from transgression. My fate, governed by the Five Phases, unfolds within the course of years. Having consulted the arts and calendars, I find that its influence now shines upon me. Fearing the onset of misfortune, I am filled with dread. Therefore, I humbly present offerings with utmost reverence, preparing incense and lamps. I pray to the radiant spirit above, beseeching its luminous protection. May it manifestly dispel calamities and secretly dissolve past faults. May it bestow blessings and grant enduring fortune. I shall forever devote myself in earnest supplication, in gratitude for the Dao’s grace.

*Memorial of Wang Zongshou, Court Attendant, for the Consecration at Mount Zhangren*

Heaven and Earth divide their numinous essence; the Three Officials determine the registers of life and death. Yin and yang suspend their celestial images; the Nine Luminaries extend their illuminating power. The Northern Office measures transgressions, while the Southern Palace prolongs life. The stars traverse mountains and rivers, their scrutiny impartial. All within the human realm fall under their governance. I, though humble and unworthy, have received the Dao’s compassion. Yet in my conduct, I fear I have strayed from the hidden and startled the spirits. In my thoughts, I have not aligned with the divine. Daily, I encounter misfortune and accumulate faults. At times, calamity converges, and I find no means to repent and pray. This year, the Celestial Talisman resides in the Central Palace, while my own position is illuminated by Saturn. The great cycle still resides within the realm of destructive forces, and the Flying Banners are lodged in my year of fate. The Three Destinies and Five Phases may yet bring harm through conflict. The arrayed stars and five planets may further cast their influence. Thus, my path remains rough, and disasters arise frequently. Without the aid of the Perfected Ones, there is no way to repent and pray. With utmost sincerity, I have undertaken this grand rite. May the Supreme Dao and host of saints deign to bestow blessings. May they dissolve future calamities and absolve past transgressions. May the Six Offices of Destiny augment my lifespan in the Crimson Heaven, and may the Seven Sovereigns of the Celestial Records grant me felicity at the Mystic Pole. May public and private affairs flourish in peace, and my family dwell in tranquility. I shall forever bear the boundless grace of the host of saints.

**Memorial for the Nine Luminaries Rite of Minister Xianchu’s Natal Destiny**

It is heard that the Three Lights manifest auspiciousness, and the Nine Luminaries congeal their radiance. Aligned with Metal and Wood to govern the directions, the four seasons proceed in order; establishing yin and yang to set forth images, the myriad things are born and completed. They preside over the hidden and the manifest, overseeing transgressions and blessings.

Your servant, in his humility, has been granted the honor of serving the true and numinous. Fearing that in the scrutiny of conduct, faults and errors may easily arise, and that the path of cultivation has yet to align with the pristine and true, he is further burdened by the weight of his official duties, where every matter, great or small, may strike. Apprehensive of lapses in vigilance, he fears accruing further guilt and misfortune. Though he strives day and night in service, never daring to slacken in diligence, the unpredictable nature of fortune and misfortune deepens his trepidation and concern. Moreover, with the transits of his natal luminaries pressing upon him, he has earnestly undertaken rites of repentance and supplication. Thus, relying on his natal destiny, he reverently inaugurates this ritual feast, presenting offerings of faith and sincerity, arranging incense and lamps to perform the rites.

He prostrates himself, hoping that the Supreme and Reclusive Saints will deign to regard his sincere heart. May the exalted Luminaries of the celestial hours, in their boundless majesty, graciously bestow their blessings. Absolve past transgressions, dissolve future calamities. May karmic debts be settled, inauspicious omens swept away. Further augment his official emoluments and lifespan, and ever grant him felicity. May his family dwell in peace, and public and private affairs flourish in tranquility. He vows to cultivate devotion unceasingly, in gratitude for the numinous grace. [He dares not say more.]

**Memorial for the Jiazi Rite of the Assembly**

It is held that when the Great Simplicity was divided, the primordial essence alone moved. Yin and yang initiated transformation, and the heavenly stems and earthly branches received their foundation. The sixty true spirits govern the four seasons and oversee day and night; the eight hundred talismanic officers determine fortune and misfortune, life and death. In great matters, the state and the cosmos follow the celestial patterns; in small, calamities and blessings, transgressions and felicity are all subject to their decree. Studying the *Dragon Embryo Stone Chamber Scriptures* and perusing the essentials of the *Phoenix Seal Jade Casket*, the core principles are made clear, and devotion is redoubled.

Your servants, relying on the divine efficacy, have encountered the turning of the Dao’s fortune. Yet the dusty mechanisms remain long closed, and the snares of the world have not been cast off. Conduct and retreat do not accord with the Confucian and the arcane; every movement and rest inevitably incurs faults and errors. Further fearing that within the Five Phases there may be clashes and hindrances, and that within the Three Destinies, adversity may be encountered, without recourse to the Supreme Dao, deep stains cannot be repented. Thus, on the day of the six Jia and the first of the Five Origins, with united sincerity and resolute intent, they pour forth their earnest supplications. Gazing toward the azure vault to descend the true, they sweep the numinous altar to perform the rites.

They prostrate themselves, hoping that vast blessings will be justly bestowed, and that the impartial and luminous will regard their plea. May all be granted auspiciousness, and calamities forever dissolved. May the Azure Palace augment their emoluments, and the Crimson Registers prolong their lives. May the living and the dead alike dwell in peace, and public and private affairs together flourish in prosperity. They vow to cultivate devotion with diligence, forever repaying the numinous benevolence. [They dare not say more.]

**Memorial for the Natal Destiny Rite of the Assembly**

Your servants, having planted blessings in past lives, have encountered the transformation of the Dao. The Most Perfect has imparted teachings, and the mysterious principles are proclaimed and practiced. Gazing upward, they receive the grace of sheltering protection, and constantly harbor earnest reverence and concern.

Yet they fear that conduct may stray from propriety and yielding, and that every step may incur faults and blemishes. Dwelling in the world and conforming to the times, they often accumulate transgressions. From past lives to this present existence, they have seldom undertaken rites of repentance and supplication. It is heard that the Three Heavens have established the regulations for rites of offering, and the Orthodox Unity has set forth the standards for cultivation and expiation. Thus, on this auspicious day, with united sincerity, they reverently proceed to the altar to offer prayers and thanks.

They prostrate themselves, invoking the Three Officials and Nine Bureaus, the Five August Emperors, the True Lords of the Dipper and Pole, and the numinous generals of their natal destinies. May they record their earnest pleas and descend with vast benevolence. Absolve past transgressions, release future calamities. May the influences of the stellar luminaries cease their adverse transits, and the year’s fortune be freed from clashes and hindrances. May official emoluments and lifespan be augmented, and felicity and auspiciousness abound. May public and private affairs be upright and prosperous, and their clans and families secure in peace.

They vow to forever cherish the grace of protection and safeguarding, and to eternally pledge their devotion in cultivation. [They dare not say more.]

**Jiao Petition for the Gengshen Day**

Your servant, having reverently studied the true scriptures and devoutly followed the mysterious classics, observes that the Gengshen day is the appointed time for offering and reverence. On this day, the Great Emperor descends to examine the records of retribution. The Three Corpses and yin spirits submit their indictments, listing every transgression—great or small, coarse or subtle—without omission. The charges are first registered in the Palace of Supreme Mystery, then inscribed in the courts of the Yellow Springs. All who cultivate the heart must truly fear and take heed.

Hoping to seize this auspicious occasion, we join in repentance for our deep faults. We prepare fragrant offerings and reverently present this jiao petition in gratitude. We humbly beseech the Three August Ones, in their compassion and protection, to deign to witness our plea. May they reject the false accusations of the yin corpses and bestow the great bounty of the Dao’s love for life. Thus may our disasters be dispelled and our transgressions erased, our goodness accumulated and blessings amassed. May the Nine Mysteries depart the realm of cold night, and the Five Clans receive the blessings of peace and security. May all affairs be upright and auspicious, and our vows swiftly fulfilled. We shall forever cherish our devotion to cultivation, ever repaying the grace of the True and Orthodox. [We dare not say more.]

**Jiao Petition to the Southern and Northern Dippers**

We have heard that since the Great Image was divided, the Three Powers have established their positions. Each embodies the natural Dao and bestows effortless merit. Through non-action, heaven and earth endure; through action, decline and prosperity shift. Fortune and misfortune, regret and shame—all arise from this.

Thus, the Crimson Register of the Southern Pole governs the records of life, while the Black Tablets of the Northern Capital govern the records of death. The two palaces judge without partiality, and the lives and deaths of all beings depend on them. Your servant, long favored by virtuous blessings, has enjoyed prosperous times. Bathed in the imperial wind and nurtured by the mysterious transformation, I nonetheless fear that my thoughts and intentions may transgress the Five Constants. My accumulated faults and errors are manifest in the two registers.

The Five Phases and Three Destinies, yin and yang, foretell times of punishment; the hidden luminaries and arrayed stars decree the pace of their transits. Before I could offer prayers of repentance, misfortunes had already taken root. Thus, on this auspicious day, I reverently perform the jiao rites. The altar stands empty in the quiet of night, while the numinous transformation dawns with the morning’s clarity. My profound devotion must reach them, and the true spirits may descend.

We humbly implore the Six Sages of the Crimson Terrace, Controllers of Destiny, to open the talismans of extended life; and the Seven Perfected of the Mysterious Ultimate, Great Emperors, to remove the days of shortened years. May our anxieties turn to peace, and our years and emoluments increase. May the living and the dead alike share in this singular grace, and our kin and dependents all partake of boundless fortune. May public and private affairs be upright and prosperous, and the old and young enjoy health and well-being. We shall forever bear the boundless grace of the saints of the two palaces. [We dare not say more.]

**Jiao Petition to the Earth Deity of the Imperial Portrait Chapel at Longxing Abbey**

We observe that the jade towers and jasper halls, the star chambers and feathered palaces, stand in solemn array above the Three Clarities and unfold within the Eight Radiant Scenes. They are the gathering place of the myriad beings and the abode of the host of perfected. Thus, they shape the boundaries of the mortal realm and extend their influence into the human world.

When King Mu of Zhou journeyed west, he modeled his terraced halls after them; when Emperor Wu of Han gazed south, he followed the Great Unity in laying their foundations. Hence, immortal sanctuaries and numinous precincts spread across mountains and seas. Their eaves catch the wind, their rafters embrace the clouds, and their splendor adorns the misty forests. They are the dwelling of the true sages and the convergence of blessings and felicity.

Longxing Abbey was first established in the Sui dynasty and has endured through the Tang years, its history long and deep. Yet time has worn it down, and decay has lingered. Thus, we have undertaken its renewal and reconstruction, striving to honor our labors. As the years pass, we deeply fear disturbances may arise. Therefore, we present this jiao offering to pacify and restore the dragon spirits.

May the nation enjoy peace and the people harmony, the times prosperity and customs abundance. May the great mandate be exalted and the mysterious blessings perpetually bestowed. [We dare not say more.]

**Jiao Petition for the Hua-Long Pond in the Central Plains**

When the Three Qi were divided, the Five Spirits gave rise to the dragon. It governs the mechanism of creation and transformation, mastering the subtleties of ascent and descent. Its divine power resides in the celestial image of Qian, while its mysterious virtue is nurtured in the palace of Kan.

Long ago, our ancestor, the Illustrious Emperor, inspected the lands of Shu. There, he witnessed its soaring flight, a true manifestation of auspicious omens. Thus, he ordered the excavation of a pond to provide it a fitting abode. Now, the years have passed, and the embankments lie in ruins. Weeds choke the waves, and sand seals the springs. Yet the numinous presence remains undiminished, and its offerings are still conveyed. Each time, it bestows the grace of timely rain, fulfilling the hopes of the parched farmers.

Mindful of this legacy, we are deeply moved. We, of meager virtue, have inherited the mandate and govern a time beset by rebels. As we inspect the lands and tour the customs, we remain encamped in the southern plains. May the dragon display its thunderous might and shake its wind-borne commands. Sweep away the bandits from the northern lands and clear the mists from the Central Plains. May governance be harmonious and just, and boundless blessings perpetually bestowed. [We dare not say more.]

**Prayer for the Emperor’s Birthday by the Crown Prince**

We have heard that the vast heavens cover all without need of reverent prayers, and the azure seas embrace even the tiniest dewdrop. Daring to follow this principle, we now offer our utmost sincerity.

On the day of this month and year, the Emperor’s birthday, his natal hour falls upon *jiaxu*. The secret records of the Primordial Heaven foretold his radiant blessings, and the earth’s profound depths bore auspicious omens, silently aligning with the luminous scriptures. The divination of his years unfolds the glory of ten thousand generations, and the reckoning of his reign reveals the aid of a hundred spirits. Thus, we conduct this grand *jiao* ceremony, reverently awaiting boundless grace. May the blessings of the Three Origins and the myriad sages converge, granting him the longevity of the North Star and the Southern Mountains. With resplendent devotion, we humbly beseech the mysterious favor.

We, your subject [Name], prostrate ourselves in earnest supplication.

**Prayer for the Descent of the Crane at Pengnü Abbey by the River Lord, Great King**

We reflect that the Dao’s transformations are boundless, and the perfected immortals manifest in the ethereal and indistinct. Within the subtle and imperceptible, they display the forms of the mysterious and the yellow. Gazing down upon the mortal realm, they deliver all beings. Their deeds are recorded in scriptures and illustrated in sacred texts.

Thus, when Ding Ling returned, he was seen with a crimson crest; when Su Dan descended, his frost-white plumage was revealed. Their tales have become timeless legends, and their auspicious signs were inscribed in the annals of their eras.

Now, we suddenly hear that a numinous crane has alighted upon Cloud Peak—a mountain where the Primordial One wandered and taught, the very place where Peng Zu ascended to heaven. The sacred altar lies secluded, long untouched by offerings of incense, yet the dense forests have indeed brought forth this wondrous response. Truly, this is a supreme omen of our sagely dynasty, not something summoned by a mere regional lord.

We pray for the mountain’s longevity and the crane’s enduring years, to honor the dragon’s chart and the phoenix’s calendar. Gazing afar at the mist-shrouded peaks, we are filled with awe and joy. Hoping to convey our devotion through the rites of this *jiao* ceremony, we humbly present our supplication.

We respectfully dispatch the Purple-Robed Great Virtue, Shangguan Zizhen, Commander of the Army, Wang Chengchen, to offer incense and fire with utmost sincerity, addressing the perfected spirits.

We prostrate ourselves in reverent prayer.

Volume Sixteen of the *Guangcheng Collection*
*Jiao* Prayer for the Enfeoffment of the Two Perfected, Li, at the Heavenly-Bestowed Observance
Composed by Du Guangting, Great Virtue of the Inner Chapel of the Supreme Clarity Palace in the Upper Capital, Purveyor of Imperial Compositions, Granted the Purple Robe

We humbly observe that when former kings examined the charts and received the Mandate, they necessarily bore the profound favor of the Dao to assist in establishing their august foundations. Yet when the seas and mountains faced manifold crises and the people had no refuge, they were then elevated by acclamation and swiftly settled the lands of Min and Bo. Though tribute from the four directions arrived, the mountains and rivers of the central realm remained obstructed. Anxiously seeking governance, they toiled from dawn to dusk, honing spears and halberds, issuing stern commands. They awaited the execution of punitive expeditions to rescue the imperiled—not out of a preference for fine weaponry, but to quell the many calamities. With such deep concern, their distress and labor doubled.

Yet the regional lords of the commanderies and kingdoms have repeatedly presented auspicious omens: creatures of scale, shell, feather, and fur gathering among the forests, bamboo groves, and trees. Some display extraordinary forms, others bear patterns that manifest near and far. Each time, we have modestly declined, repeatedly suppressing their reports.

In the autumn of the second year of Yongping, in the seventh month, an ancient bronze prophecy inscribed in seal script was discovered at Ling Mountain in Xianju. It was the *Record of the Supreme One’s Communication with Heaven*, a text cast by Perfected Zhang. Names, birth dates, and the years of descendants were set forth in layer upon layer of revelation, each detail aligning perfectly. Like the Duke of Zhou divining with millet stalks or Guo Pu casting yarrow, this was truly a gift from Heaven, its divine efficacy proven beyond doubt. Overwhelmed by my own inadequacy, how dare I fail in reverent devotion?

Thus, a new abbey was established, and a propitious name bestowed. Its rituals of image and offering were prepared, and the name of the garrison county was changed. Golden registers were purified in fasting, and jade altars were consecrated in libation. Though my sincerity in offering thanks is manifest, it scarcely repays the bounty of the Supreme Mystery.

Perfected Zhang personally sealed the sacred script, while Perfected Li was the first to guard the immortal mountain. Together, they brought harmony to auspicious omens, illuminating all the kingdoms. It is fitting to confer honors in recognition of their meritorious aid. Invoking the enduring statutes, I humbly submit this petition of inadequacy.

Hereby, Zhang Hongdao is enfeoffed as Perfected of Mirroring Sagacity, and Li Babai as Perfected of Mystic Response. I respectfully dispatch the Venerable Master of Broad Completion, Duke Du Guangting of Cai, Grand Master for Glorious Happiness and Left Grand Master of Remonstrance, to prepare incense and lamps with utmost devotion and perform the libation rites.

May the gates of the Ninefold Purity open, and the cloud-chariot of the Eight Radiant Sceneries descend. Look down upon my luminous sincerity, and bestow your boundless grace.

May the Nine Provinces and Six Directions sweep away all miasmic vapors to become your domain; may earth endure and heaven stretch long, merging chariots and writings into a single transformative influence. I vow to uphold the mysterious teachings and forever cultivate the cinnabar heart.

With utmost reverence, I offer this prayer.

---

**Imperial Edict Conferring Title upon Perfected Zhang**

Your name is inscribed upon the cinnabar registers, for heaven has bestowed upon you immortal talent. In the mortal realm, jade scrolls and pearl-adorned carriages have never drawn your gaze; beyond the world, you dwell among clouds, drink from the dawn, and find serene tranquility. Early on, you received the sacred scriptures and mastered the subtle portents of heaven and earth. You delved into hidden depths, foreseeing the future from the past. Engraving bronze with celestial seals upon the immortal mountain, you bore witness to the Metal Phase in the kingdom of Shu. For over two hundred years, your traces have remained concealed, yet ever renewed are the fifty-eight characters that cycle through, verifying every auspicious sign.

Though my virtue is meager, I reverently receive your numinous grace. Though I have built resplendent halls and sculpted august likenesses, inscribed the names of new cities, and performed the rites of purification and offering, my humble heart remains unfulfilled, unable to repay your boundless favor. Thus, I now invoke the rites of state to specially confer honors and exaltation.

Now conferring upon you the title of **Perfected Master of Illuminating Sagacity**, I reverently dispatch Du [Mou] to inaugurate the frost-altar rites and solemnly proclaim this edict.

Phoenix carriages and crane bridles shall attend your journey in the footsteps of Wen Shi; jade chambers and vermilion curtains shall array you among the ranks of Tai Yuan. May the Perfected Master continue to bestow subtle aid, ever lending your numinous radiance, that the Nine Domains be unified under one rule and the Great Enterprise endure in eternal prosperity. Through diligent toil from dawn to dusk, may the people live in peace.

With utmost reverence, the edict.

**Edict Conferring the Title of Perfected Master Li**

Your immortal plum branch, fragrant and golden, parts the clouds with its lineage. From the Dark Mound you set your resolve, though your talent was never bound by fleeting time; your Dao-bone and true wind originally ranked among the ranks of long life. Shaking your robes beyond the world, you soared aloft amid the clouds. Weary of the toil of swift passage like a foal’s window or lightning’s flight, you found the joy of riding clouds upon Ao Ridge. Dwelling and wandering in the kingdom of Shu, you appeared and vanished amid the dusty world. Thrice you concealed yourself on Spirit Peak, living over eight hundred years. Your elixir transformed stone, still abiding on Changli Mountain; your entire household ascended to heaven, thus marking the immortal’s dwelling. Here, upon the old site, the numinous script was indeed discovered—long sealed in the jade ruins, now revealed to accord with the Metal Phase. Reflecting upon my deficient virtue, I humbly bear this extraordinary grace. Though I have repaired and adorned your sacred foundations, reverently arrayed your august likeness, led the assembly in solemn rites of thanksgiving, and commanded the feather-robed to perform the burning offerings, my humble heart remains unfulfilled, unable to repay your profound power. Now, having examined the proper rites, I offer this fine title. May you, clad in starry pendants and rosy robes, swiftly ascend to your true rank; and may dew-sealed vermilion script express my earnest devotion. Reflecting upon my modest bearing, I am deeply abashed.

Now conferring upon you the title of **Perfected Master of Mystic Response**, I reverently dispatch Du Guangting to establish the offering altar and solemnly proclaim this edict. May your mystic shade flow forth to eternally bless the imperial foundation. Hearing the distant thoughts of the Hall of Audience, I await the gaze of the exalted Perfected.

With utmost reverence, the edict.

**Prayer of the Grand Marshal of Hanzhou at the Immortal’s Abode Altar**

Your servant has heard that the supreme Dao, non-action itself, embraces the myriad heavens to accomplish transformation; its dark efficacy, though active, governs the Four Symbols to mold and refine. Its encompassing vastness has never faltered from ancient times to the present. Thus the Three Spirits are ordered, the Five Wefts follow their course, auspicious blessings extend to hidden companions, and great blessings overflow through states and kingdoms. Heaven and humanity depend upon it, receiving its profound moisture in distant reaches.

Your servant, long moved by your numinous compassion, has encountered this flourishing fortune. Repeatedly receiving extraordinary favors, I have been honored with the dignity of the bamboo tally; frequently bathed in profound grace, I have been entrusted with weighty and difficult duties. Yet, reflecting upon my emptiness and meagerness, I have achieved no meritorious deeds. Mindful of my duty to share the sovereign’s burdens, I tremble with awe. Though I devote my heart and strength, vowing to repay the private bonds of ruler and father, I fear that blessings overreaching may invite calamity, or that I may tread the path of obscurity and delusion.

I privately fear that in commanding troops and governing borders, ruling the people entails the burdens of litigation, and fulfilling office involves the breadth of taxes and corvée. Encouragement and deterrence require the use of rewards and punishments; sending off and receiving involve customary feasts and rewards. There are concerns over accidental injuries and misjudgments in severity or leniency. Thus, offenses accumulate, yet I have never performed rites of repentance and prayer. Perhaps past debts and former grievances remain unresolved; or celestial patterns and fate’s course still align with calamitous times. From early summer to autumn’s moon, I have long suffered minor ailments, yet to be cured.

Without relying on the grace of the supreme Dao, who could summon the protection of the true numina? Now, as the jade altar is arrayed and the purple-sealed edict descends, may the exalted immortals pause their chariots in response, and the myriad sages manifest to bestow blessings. Daring to seize this propitious gathering, I humbly prepare fragrant offerings, laying bare my sincere devotion and reverently praying for your mystic shade. I prostrate myself, beseeching your guardianship and the granting of good fortune. May my offenses and faults be swept away, grievances resolved, calamities transcended, and years and blessings increased. May illness and misfortune vanish, and auspicious signs gather. May the altar masters and ritualists diligently serve the sages with devotion; beneath the azure canopy and vermilion wheels, I dare not neglect the arrival of spring’s procession.

I cannot express the fullness of my devotion in returning to life and baring my heart.

With utmost reverence, the prayer.

**Prayer for the Natal Destiny of Former Military Commissioner of Jiazhou, Sikong Wang Zongjie**

---

I humbly acknowledge that the two qi govern the movements of the cosmos, and the Five Agents bring forth transformation. All who receive form and destiny owe their existence to the Supreme Mystery. Yet I, with my meager endowments, have presumptuously enjoyed the grace of nurturing cultivation. By good fortune, I have encountered an era of prosperity and repeatedly been honored with favor. Within, I have served in the inner chambers of the court; without, I have been entrusted with the stewardship of rivers and mountains. I have overseen the military, governing the common people. Ashamed of my lack of talent for governance, I have ever feared the warning against excess. Indeed, I have encountered adversity and thus fallen into peril. Yet through the profound mercy of the sagely and enlightened, I have been restored to the ranks of the gentry. Rising early and retiring late, I am ever mindful of the imperial grace and kindness. My heart is filled with devotion, yet my meager service has not repaid the sovereign and father.

For years now, misfortunes have lingered unceasingly. Since mid-autumn, illness has struck repeatedly. Though I have sought medical treatment, recovery has eluded me. I note that Saturn has resided in the palace of my life and destiny for several years; Mars has lingered in the position of fields and dwellings, still in the northern quadrant. The Year Star has become an omen of the Six Harms, and my minor fate coincides with the year’s destruction. Though the advent of Jupiter at winter’s onset brings fortune, I am presently afflicted by the misfortunes of my current fate. Beset by this inauspicious decline, my anxiety deepens.

Moreover, I fear that the affairs of governance may be fraught with grave difficulties. In administering punishments, I may lack compassion; in overseeing provisions, I may err in preparation. Long-standing karmic debts remain unexpiated, and my prayers of repentance have been incomplete. I also fear that past transgressions may have been recorded in the hidden registers, or that the dragon spirits of my residence may have been offended by solitude. Perhaps the tombs of my homeland have suffered damage, bringing calamity upon me and causing this peril. With remorse, I reflect upon my faults and turn earnestly to prayer.

Daring to seize this day of my natal destiny, I reverently prepare offerings of incense and lamps. Gazing toward the mysterious heavens, I plead for life, pouring forth my sincere devotion in hope of grace. I prostrate myself before the true spirits of Heaven and Earth, the lords of yin and yang. May they bestow their vast protection and heed my deepest sincerity. May my sins and faults be swept away, my calamities dispelled. May grievances be resolved, and the flow of misfortune dissolved. May my ancestors find peace in the netherworld, and my descendants enjoy tranquility in this sagely age. May the three barriers and pores of my body know no obstruction, and the six viscera and their mechanisms find balance and harmony. Grant me recovery and bless me with good fortune. Extend my years in this autumn of near-exhaustion, and preserve my life in this day of rebirth. With heart laid bare and tears shed, I offer my most earnest prayers. I vow to devote myself to reverent service, repaying the protection of the exalted spirits.

With utmost reverence, the prayer.

**Prayer for the Shangyuan Offering by Former Prefect of Hanzhou, Lord Zongkui**

I have heard that the Dao shapes Heaven and Earth, molding yin and yang. The Three Origins serve as the seasons of transformation, and the Five Peaks govern the records of life. Their authority culminates in the Perfect Truth, enabling blessings to extend to the state and grace to embrace both the seen and unseen. The Vermilion Registers of Nanchang expand the path of virtue, while the Black Scripts of the Northern Bureau reveal the principles of correction. Thus are warnings and encouragements issued, and the protection of all beings extended. Having received the true teachings, I have ever adhered to their luminous instructions, striving with diligence to fulfill the mysterious compassion.

I reflect upon the depth of the state’s grace and the insufficiency of my efforts to serve the sovereign. My achievements remain unrecorded in the tripods, yet my honors surpass those of all ministers. Abroad, I have borne the banner and tassel, commanding the military; at home, I have received fresh favors and ascended to lofty ranks. The green gates of the inner court mark my exalted position, and the yellow pivots of power signify my heavy responsibilities. With humility, I am filled with awe, yet I find no means to repay my lord.

Thus, I devoutly perform these rites of incense and prayer, hoping to repay the kindness of sovereign and kin. Now, as the Celestial Officials govern the seasons and the Great White One presides over the directions, the Lesser Yin bestows its nurturing warmth, and the Great Amnesty issues decrees of creation. With utmost sincerity, I hold fast to the fragrant flames and reverently commence this offering. Gazing toward the celestial signs, I concentrate my heart, awaiting the response of auspicious omens.

Above all, I pray that the precious chart may endure, and the sagely lifespan be prolonged. May all within and without enjoy peace, and the realm know tranquility. May the Eight Extremities and Nine Lands be united under one sovereign; may the years be bountiful, the qi harmonious, and the governance ever free from strife. May the netherworld be bright and serene, and all living things flourish. May the land and all beneath Heaven ascend to the realm of longevity.

I, your subject, beseech that calamities be swept away, karmic debts resolved. May sins and faults be erased, and blessings gathered. May both public and private affairs prosper, and my family remain ever at peace. I vow to devote my heart to loyalty and filial piety, aiding the flourishing of this enlightened age.

**Prayer for the Illness and Misfortune of the Lady of Zhao State**

I have heard that the heavenly truth pities all beings, and the great Dao cherishes life. Ever extending its rescuing compassion, it fulfills the wish for safety. Behold the supreme transformation, nurturing all living things. The two qi, in their misty union, shape form; the Three Origins, in their radiance, determine destiny. Fortune and misfortune, sin and blessing, are all ordained by the celestial authorities.

I, however, am burdened by a destiny and fate both in decline, with my natal tone residing in the tomb. Though I have encountered the auspiciousness of the House Spirit, I am also beset by the inauspiciousness of clashes and destruction. My wandering year coincides with the Celestial Talisman, and my natal destiny encounters the Five Ghosts. Within my life palace, hidden malevolent stars entangle me. Saturn has lingered in my dull and stagnant fate, while on the position of punishment and misfortune, Mars has repeatedly converged. Thus, calamity has manifested as illness, and recovery has not come, deepening my anxiety.

I fear that sins from past lives and this existence remain unresolved, and karmic debts of life and wealth unpaid. Without the grand altar of this great offering, my earnest prayers of repentance cannot be fully expressed. Therefore, I set aside my garments and ornaments, preparing these fragrant offerings. Solemnly arranging the altar, I reverently present my prayers.

I prostrate myself before the myriad heavens, entreating their compassion and protection, and the multitude of sages, beseeching their mercy. May they extend their benevolence of rebirth and fulfill the virtue of cherishing life. May the Three Officials and Five Emperors, the hidden malevolent stars and Seven Origins, the Southern Dipper and Northern Star, the celestial authorities and constellations, the sacred peaks and rivers, the luminous spirits of the earthly courts, and the deities of my natal palace, wandering year, and the inner and outer Eight Trigrams—may all the responsive spirits of the Three Realms, within the registers of the celestial bureaus and the records of destiny, pardon my grievances, sins, and transgressions, and the calamities and misfortunes ordained by fate. Grant me the continuation of my blessings and years, and the extension of my lifespan.

---

May it sweep away misfortune and decline, and dispel illness and suffering.
May the hundred meridians flow freely, and the six viscera find peace and harmony.
May I once more behold the light of heaven and again tread the affairs of men.
With heart laid bare and resolve strengthened, I shall forever repay the grace of salvation and aid;
Contemplating goodness and delving into the mysteries, I aspire to fully receive the blessings of the true spirits.

Unable to contain the earnestness of my pleading, I humbly beseech for life and destiny, my devotion and supplication most fervent.

Respectfully submitted.

*Petition for the Grand Offering on the Day of the Holy Descent of the Lady of Hongnong Commandery at the Residence of Wang Zongjie*

I, your humble servant, have heard that the Primordial Daoist Ancestor, the Most High Lord Lao, abides in the Three Realms, ever mindful of all under heaven, and in his compassion for salvation, descends in true form.
He bestows the five-colored radiance of the Great Yang and ascends with the nine dragons of the rising sun.
His dream took shape by the Luo River, and his birth was beneath the immortal plum.
Lotus blossoms opened upon the earth as he first received the jade steps;
A well sprang forth in the empty courtyard, its waters cleansing his jade-like form.
His august countenance revealed his singular bearing, and his sagely decrees expounded the subtle teachings.
The myriad heavens took him as their foundation, and successive generations regarded him as their master.
He marked the propitious day with a festival, bestowing extraordinary blessings upon all beings.
It is fitting to honor this grand assembly and manifest our utmost sincerity.

I, your servant, early awakened to the true vehicle and have long studied the sacred registers.
The wondrous scriptures of life extension, the texts of the Purple Yang and Cinnabar Palace;
The divine charts of transformation, the records of the Crimson Towers and Vermilion Palaces.
I align body and mind within the Nine Chambers, and regulate spirit and qi at the Three Passes.
I cleanse transgressions and dispel evil, benefiting both the hidden and the manifest.
Ever diligent in my devotion, I dare not cease the offerings of incense and lamps.

Now, on this occasion of great amnesty, I reverently prepare the rites for the offering to the true spirits.
Thus, I send forth my sincerity to the crane pavilions and fix my gaze upon the dragon chariots.
With heartfelt devotion, I present my words, and upon the jade altar, I complete the rites.
From the celestial palaces to the earthly courts, from the solar domains to the stellar paths,
The bureaus of the Three Officials and Five Emperors, the northern and southern celestial offices,
Below, encompassing the rivers and mountains, and all around, pervading the hidden spirits—
I exhaust my bright sincerity, hoping for their luminous regard.

Above, I pray that the imperial foundation may endure forever, and the sagely lifespan extend far and long.
May the Dao flourish in harmony, and the sacred teachings spread abroad.
In the nine regions and four frontiers, may the winds of virtue and power be ever revered;
May all beings and myriad creatures together enjoy the fortune of peace and prosperity.
May my ninefold ancestors and sevenfold forebears, the departed spirits of old,
Ascend to the cinnabar mounds and be born in the azure heavens.
May disasters be averted before they arise, and goodness descend without limit.
May my years be increased, and my sins and transgressions all absolved.
I vow to remain steadfast in devotion, fully receiving your vast compassion.

Unable to contain the utmost of my submission to destiny.

*Birthday Petition of the Prefect of Yangzhou*

I prostrate myself, for the Three Heavens spread their transforming influence, and the Orthodox Unity bestows its teachings.
Their wondrous works shine forth, broadly aiding all beings,
Desiring that the light of heaven illuminate the hidden gates below, stilling the sorrows of the unseen;
That the humblest pleas ascend to the radiant sun above, fulfilling the wish for unimpeded communication.
Thus, they unfolded the Twenty-Four Registers, appointed the Twelve Hundred Officials,
To govern humanity and oversee the true records.
They dispatch spirit riders as couriers and waft fragrant stalks as messenger dragons.
Through accumulated thought, resonance may be expected; through salvation and protection, sincerity and clarity will surely reach them.
From ancient times to the present, their veneration has been profound, and their beneficence manifest.

Your servant has long admired the Orthodox and True, ever receiving the shade of their protection.
Though I have held the altar seal and ministerial tally, I have yet to repay my debt to the state;
Purifying myself and clarifying my mind, I have ever been earnest in my desire for self-cultivation.
Now, I reverently receive the imperial decree and temporarily govern the distant frontier.
On the occasion of my birthday, I humbly seek divine favor,
Reverently presenting the offering rites and meticulously preparing this petition.

I beseech the Great Dao to extend its compassion, and the Heavenly Master to grant his regard and protection.
May the martial officials and generals descend to cover and shield me.
May my garrison duties be accomplished, and the beacons of war fall silent.
May the distant lands turn anew, all swaddled infants carried to embrace benevolence;
May the fierce and unruly reform their hearts, all climbing the mountains to turn toward the Dao.
I await the cleansing of the world, that lasting harmony may prevail.

May your servant’s official emoluments and lifespan be increased, and misfortunes and calamities cease.
May the fortunes of the Dao be secure and prosperous, and the generals and officials harmonious.
May the hidden and the manifest alike receive the mysterious blessings.

Unable to contain the utmost of my submission and fervent supplication.

Respectfully offered.

**Eastern Court Minister of Education’s First Month Jiazi Offering**

We humbly acknowledge that the Great Dao sheds its radiance, and the Mysterious Origin bestows its transformation. Qi divides into the Five Wefts, where the Five Emperors hold the power of cyclical change; the seasons unfold through the Three Origins, where the Three Officials govern the records of life and death. Thus, the hundred spirits receive their offices, and all things know their place. Cold and heat alternate, completing the year’s work and revealing retribution; the Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches align, ordering human affairs and determining fortune and misfortune. From ancient times to the present, this has been reverently observed, and the numinous never fails to respond.

Your servant, undeservingly sheltered by the Dao’s shade, has been granted the fortune to assist in this flourishing age. Yet blessings may turn to calamity, and I ever heed the warning of holding too full a measure; my talents are slight, but my duty is weighty, and I can only offer my utmost sincerity in serving the state. Now, as the season reaches the Upper Prime and the cycle renews the Six Jia, we examine the records at the head of the Celestial Office, where the first Jiazi of the new reckoning is observed. On this auspicious day, I reverently conduct the great offering.

Dare I hope the Mysterious Sage will deign to regard my earnest devotion?

Your servant reflects that, though distant from the court and my parents’ chambers, I remain bound by the rites of filial piety. Now, as I prepare to attend them, I am still hindered by mountains and rivers. Moreover, the winding paths of Long Gorge and the treacherous depths of the Yangtze’s waves weigh upon me. Only by relying on divine power may I hope to safely traverse these perilous roads.

We implore the lofty Five Emperors, the great Three Officials, and the numinous spirits of the sixty Jiazi to turn their responsive might toward this offering and bestow their manifest blessings. May my light vessel cross smoothly, covering ten thousand li without peril. Spare me the lament of climbing hills in sorrow, and swiftly grant me the joy of serving my parents in their old age. May my earnest prayers be fulfilled, and may I never fail in gratitude for this luminous grace.

I vow to uphold my reverent devotion, forever repaying the protection of the true spirits. Unable to contain the utmost of my submission and fervent supplication, I offer this prayer with all my heart.

Respectfully presented.

**Offering Prayer of Marshal Zhao, Grand Commandant of Yangping**

We humbly acknowledge that the Perfect Dao scatters its light, and the immortal courts array their ranks. Above, they float among the celestial bodies; below, they bind themselves to renowned mountains. They encompass the cavern-palaces in profound majesty, embracing clouds and mist in their singular splendor. They secretly safeguard the state and broadly shelter all living beings, governing the destinies of humans and heavens, presiding over the registers of life. They dispel disasters and bestow blessings, responding unfailingly to all who call.

Your servant, having received the favor of sagely rule, has been undeservingly honored with rank and emolument. Commanding the military, I am ashamed to lack the achievements of Han Xin or Bai Qi; holding the tally of authority, I am humbled by my failure to match the governance of Gong Sui or Huang Ba. Ever wary of excess, I have brought upon myself misfortune and decline. Thus, I have wholeheartedly turned to the Mysterious Teachings, transmitting and upholding its scriptures and registers, revering its true spirits.

May the fortunes of the state be prolonged and vast, and my lifespan firm and enduring. May the myriad regions be united, and the four seas harmonized as one.

Your servant, having shed the perils of calamity, prays for the absolution of his transgressions. May my six relations receive blessings, and my nine generations ascend to heaven. May my official emoluments and lifespan increase, and my merits and renown be established.

I vow to uphold loyalty and filial piety, forever serving the radiant and enlightened. May my diligent devotion meet the favor of the perfected immortals.

Reverently conducting this offering, I humbly present my sincere plea. Unable to contain the utmost of my submission and fervent supplication.

Respectfully presented.

*End of Scroll Sixteen of the Guangcheng Collection*
*Scroll Seventeen of the Guangcheng Collection*

**Prayer for the Revival of the Withered Cypress at Crane Cry Mountain, Composed by Du Guangting, Grand Virtue of Literary Composition by Imperial Commission, Purple-Robed Bestower, of the Supreme Clarity Palace in the Upper Capital**

Of that immortal mountain,
it establishes this southern land.
Mighty, it cradles the deep earth;
elegant, it upholds the vaulted heavens.
Governing the plains and rivers of Luo and Mian,
commanding the scenic grandeur of Min and Emei.
Its peaks bear the sun aloft,
its grottoes shelter the perfected.
Pines and cypresses, lush and towering, stretch into the void;
for a thousand years, its numinous majesty remains solemn and reverent.
Then came the wondrous portent,
manifest in this blessed sanctuary.
The transformative power of the supreme Yang bestowed its grace,
altering the withered cypress, its decayed form.
Tender branches flourish afresh,
scattering fragrant auspicious dew;
dense leaves renew their glory,
stirred by the clear breeze into swaying verdancy.
The hidden praises of immortals and transcendents,
the blessings invoked for the state and the people.
May this profound felicity endure,
and these auspicious boons be everlasting.
Thus, with utmost reverence, we conduct this offering and prayer,
looking up to answer the perfected spirits.
Our hearts concentrate within the Hall of Audience,
our aspirations soar beyond the cloud-capped peaks.
We pray that the Hua and Yi be illuminated in peace,
that seas and mountains rest in tranquility.
May crops and grains flourish in abundance,
and baleful vapors be dispelled and settled.
May we forever uphold our devotion,
to repay the profound favor of the Dao.

With bowed head, we present this respectful prayer.

**Prayer for Protection by Minister Li Zhongshun, Minister of Works**

Your servant has heard:
the Dao operates without limit,
the divine power is unfathomable.
Responding to the moment and the thought,
where there is sincerity, there is communion.
The Orthodox Unity transmitted its scriptures,
bestowing treasured texts to succor all beings;
the Alliance of Might established its teachings,
setting forth the rites of offerings to aid the people.
From the ancients to this day,
its grace extends to the manifest and the hidden,
its blessings pervade heaven and humanity.
Your servant has long received the profound compassion of the Dao,
and has been blessed to live in this sagely age.
The celestial favor flows boundlessly,
the human rank is most generous.
Ashamed of my lack of talent for governance,
I deeply fear the excess of such honor and toil.
Moreover, I oversee the military and the guard,
commanding the fish tally in my post.
In rewards and punishments, I may err in fairness;
in laws and decrees, I may misjudge severity or leniency.
The people harbor grievances,
the common folk bear wounds and sighs.
Should any such fault arise,
it would surely invite divine reproach.
I also fear that the five phases and three destinies
may encounter calamitous obscuration.
Dark stars and bright constellations
may align in ominous conjunction.
Or in traversing water and land,
I may offend the dragon spirits.
Or in constructing earth and timber,
I may violate taboos.
Or there may be old enmities and past debts,
or unintended killings and injuries,
each accumulating into transgressions.
Coupled with inauspicious alignments,
these may bring forth illness and affliction,
deepening my trepidation and concern.
Yet I recall that the Great Dao cherishes life,
and the Supreme Perfected established its teachings.
It has set forth the rites of prayer and exorcism,
opened the gates of repentance and gratitude.
Thus, I dare to prepare the altar with reverence,
and meticulously conduct this offering and prayer.
I bow to heaven and repent my faults,
pouring out my earnest pleas for grace.
I implore the Three Realms’ exalted ones,
the Great Saints of the myriad heavens,
to descend with compassionate bestowal,
and look upon this humble dust with mercy.
Command the celestial and terrestrial bureaus,
pervade the yin and yang realms.
Dissolve and dispel calamities and misfortunes,
absolve and pardon transgressions and faults.
Sever the bonds of misfortune and decline,
reconcile and pacify karmic debts.
Eradicate illness and suffering,
calm and secure the hun and po souls.
Harmonize the six qi,
and free the flow of the hundred meridians.
Transform my brief and fleeting fate,
grant me the gift of prolonged years.
May the ten thousand sins and thousand disasters
all be transcended and delivered.
I vow to uphold my devotion with diligence,
looking up to serve the perfected spirits.
Your servant, unable to contain his gratitude for absolution and his fervent pleas for grace,
presents this prayer with utmost sincerity.

Respectfully presented.

**Prayer for Offering by the Lady of the Prefecture, Wife of the Minister of Works**

I have heard:
the Great Dao established its precepts,
the Mysterious Perfected set forth its teachings.
The Orthodox Unity possesses rites for beseeching grace,
the River Chart contains texts for repenting faults.
When we reverently invoke the exalted spirits,
they surely grant their luminous scrutiny.
I, [Lady] so-and-so, have long been favored by numinous blessings,
and born into this mortal realm.
Grateful for the shelter of such grace,
I have always been filled with caution and awe.
Recently, I have been afflicted by illness,
and have not yet recovered.
I fear that in my conduct and bearing,
in my thoughts and intentions,
there may have been errors and transgressions,
or offenses and faults.
Or perhaps I have incurred karmic entanglements,
bringing misfortune upon myself.
Or perhaps dark stars and bright constellations
have cast their influence upon me.
Thus, this calamity has bound me,
and has not yet been dispelled.
Day and night, I am filled with anxiety,
daring not rest in peace.
Moreover, within the palace of my body,
the movement of Saturn’s course
has brought my fate to a perilous juncture.
With utmost sincerity, I make this plea,
daring to follow the luminous precepts
and reverently conduct this grand offering.
I implore the Three Treasures and Supreme Saints,
the exalted deities of the Nine Luminaries,
to bestow boundless compassion
and descend their protective power.
Grant me the dissolution of calamities and misfortunes,
the reconciliation of enmities and grudges.
Prolong my years,
increase my blessings and emoluments.
May the hundred illnesses be healed,
the six qi harmonized.
Wash away misfortune and decline,
erase transgressions and faults.
May I forever uphold my devotion,
to repay the profound grace of the Dao.
Unable to contain my gratitude for absolution and my fervent pleas to the perfected,
I present this prayer with utmost sincerity.

Respectfully presented.

**Prayer for the Celestial Net by Duke Ji of the Ministry of Works**

Your servant has heard:
the endowment of emoluments and physical form
derives from the transformative power of the Dao.
The prolongation of life and preservation of destiny
depend upon the divine efficacy.
Yet there are the rise and fall of the three destinies,
the alternation of the five phases.
The movement of stars through their courses,
the auspicious and inauspicious omens of hexagrams.
Should one encounter a period of inauspicious alignment,
the purpose of expiatory rites is surely revealed.
Thus, the Mysterious Perfected pities the world,
and the Great Dao cherishes life.
It has established laws to aid humanity,
responding wherever there is sincerity.
The precious texts of the Three Heavens and Orthodox Unity
proclaim the rites for invoking blessings;
the Grand Mysterious River Chart’s offering rituals
initiate the purpose of averting calamities.
From ancient times to the present, they have been revered,
and their protective succor has been abundant.
Your servant has long been favored by numinous grace,
and has personally lived in this illustrious age.
The honors and favors bestowed are extraordinary,
my rank and status surpass the norm.
Reflecting upon myself, I am ever mindful
of the warning against excess;
pledging my heart and strength, I constantly
fear the reckoning of blessings and faults.
Now, the great fortune still resides in the region of Xu,
and the lesser fortune remains in the position of Hai.
Within this year,
both coincide with the Celestial Net.
I fear that every thought and intention
may incur transgressions and faults.
From past lives and former existences,
I may bear hidden flaws.
Though I have diligently cultivated myself,
how can I be free from errors?
Moreover, dark stars move through the Chen division,
and Mars resides in the palace of my body.
Furthermore, my talents are meager for such great favor,
my merits slight for such weighty rank.
I fear that calamities and obstacles may arise,
deepening my trepidation and concern.
Thus, I dare to follow the mysterious scriptures,
reverently and earnestly prepare my sincere plea,
meticulously conduct this offering rite,
and present this prayer with bowed head.

Grateful for past transgressions before the Nine Heavens,
I pray for the grace of the host of sages.
May the true numina deign to witness and reflect,
bestowing abundant blessings in torrential flow.
May the celestial and terrestrial bureaus be commanded,
the yang officials and yin courts be charged.
Pardon the faults of the past,
cleanse the baleful influences yet to come.
Dispel the disasters of lingering stars,
release the snares of the Celestial Net.
Abundantly extend my allotted blessings and emoluments,
increase my years and lifespan.
May my sincere devotion of loyalty and filial piety
forever aid the radiant transformation of sagely governance.
I vow to diligently hone and refine myself,
to fully respond to the mysterious compassion above.
I can do no more than prostrate myself in utmost reverence.

Field Chongqian and Lu Zhao, having received the *Lu* Text of the Six Jia,
prostrate ourselves and declare:
As the supreme transformation is about to unfold,
the mysterious scriptures first manifest.
Five thousand characters convey the teaching,
the Six Jia unfold the chart.
First transmitted in the court of Yu Shun,
passed down from the age of the Ji Zhou.
Cultivated within, it congeals the true and returns to the One,
riding the sun and moon to tread the misty heavens;
practiced without, it protects the state and pacifies the people,
bringing well-being to all beings and abundance to the myriad realms.
As the root of the Dharma,
it has been revered through the ages.
We, your servants, have been favored by the mysterious talismans,
and moreover, have encountered the imperial destiny.
The true wind spreads widely,
the wondrous decree is proclaimed afar.
We wish to follow and cultivate it,
eternally pledging to uphold it.
Fitting the auspicious occasion,
we reverently reveal our bright sincerity.
May the primal sages and merged compassion,
the host of perfected ones, cast their discerning light.
Fulfill our earnest wishes,
bestow your majestic radiance.
Let our devotion and resonance be felt,
our merit and practice come to fruition.
Open the deliverance of the Nine Mysteries,
dissolve the accumulation of past transgressions.
May blessings and goodness swiftly arrive,
lifespan and years be increased.
Aid the people and assist the state,
magnify the Dao and proclaim the scriptures.
Forever propagate the wind of purity and stillness,
perfect the Dao of emptiness and tranquility.
I can do no more than prostrate myself in utmost reverence.

---

Fan Yanxu and others, having received the *Lu* Text of the Orthodox Unity,
respectfully submit this plea.

Humbly we acknowledge that the Southern Palace of Orthodox Unity and the Jade Hall of Purple Yang
guard the true registers of radiant yang and seal the numinous charts of soaring transformation.
Below, they may quell malevolent spirits and proclaim the harmony of qi and seasons;
above, they may pacify the realm and assemble the divine immortals.
To protect the state and secure the people has been their constant mandate through the ages.
We, having encountered this sagely era, are bathed in the wind of the Dao.
Early we cast off the clamor of the world, together dwelling in feathered robes.
We aspire to receive and partake, striving diligently in our burning and cultivation.
May the host of sages, in their vast compassion, grant that we harmonize with the ancestral teachings.
Clad in stellar robes and treading the Dipper, may we follow the flying steps of the Nine Heavens;
assisting the world and establishing merit, may we fulfill the efficacy of the great Dao in its timely transformation.
With incense at the hearth and hands pressed in reverence, we prostrate ourselves and pray to the perfected,
eagerly awaiting the mysterious grace, unable to contain our fervent devotion.

Respectfully submitted by Wang Dang for the offering of the jiao and presentation of this plea.

We have heard that the treasured canon of the River Chart descends its jiao rites to aid the people,
and the luminous statutes of Orthodox Unity manifest their textual proclamations to assist transformation.
Both propagate the essentials of the Dao and widely bless living beings.
We, having been entrusted with the mysterious gate and presuming to partake in the secret registers,
find our burning and cultivation often lacking, our transgressions and faults swiftly manifest.
Our duties lie in public service, yet our actions are frequently marred by regret.
At times, in adjudicating lawsuits, rewards and punishments err in their weight;
in instructing and comforting disciples, encouragement and admonition fall short of their commands.
Searching our hearts and examining ourselves, our anxiety grows day and night.
Without relying on the mysterious power, there is no path to repentance and absolution.

Moreover, at the close of the fifth month, earth and fire are poised to enter the palace of the body.
In this distress, we yearn for expiation and deliverance.
Now, with utmost sincerity and offerings of faith,
we beseech the presentation of this plea.
May the Most High and the host of venerables, lords of the Three Heavens’ transformation,
bestow the great mercy of their grace and descend boundless favor.
Command the celestial officials, soldiers, and guards to fulfill their duties in protection.
Grant that our faults and transgressions be swept away, our karmic debts be pacified.
May the Nine Luminaries reverse the calamities of their visitation,
may the Three Destinies cease the misfortunes of their clashes,
that we may attain purity and auspiciousness, ever enjoying smooth passage.
We vow to uphold the sincerity of our hearth and incense,
to repay above the protection of the august spirits.
We cannot express the fullness of our devotion.

**Petition of Diao Zizong, Exhortation to the Grand Marshal, Presented at the Sacred Pool to the Perfected Master Zhu of the Grotto**

We have heard that the wondrous Dao of creation and transformation, in its vast teaching, saves all beings; its mysterious power, ungoverned by self, spreads the breeze of mercy to all things. Ever responsive without hindrance, it delivers and protects without omission. Thus, the azure tablets and cinnabar scriptures continue to record the ranks of those who ascend to Perfection; even the nightly gates of the hidden bureaus are encompassed by the benevolence of refinement and transformation. Like fire passed from torch to torch, its radiance has illumined all ages.

This humble one, born in an era of propitious destiny, has had his name inscribed in the register of the True Vehicle. With each devout offering of incense and prayer, he has secretly yearned for the power of the Dao, hoping to invoke boundless fortune and, above all, repay the grace of his sovereign. He aspires that the Perfected One may ever inspire his cinnabar heart, and that his thoughts may soon join the study of the mysterious registers. His longing is earnest and unceasing; how may he scale the heights of his reverence?

We prostrate ourselves before the Transcendent Lord, whose Dao is unfettered, whose hidden flight outlives the distant crane. Pointing to the Three Mountains, he soars aloft—none can trace his cloud-borne path; though he returns but briefly after countless years, one can only imagine his sorrow for the dust-bound world. This humble one, shamed by the faintest echoes of Lu Ao’s footsteps, gazes after the distant traces of the Perfected Master as if beholding the tracks of Ruoshi. With a heart poured out in sincerity, he purifies himself, kindles incense, and bows in worship.

We await the turning of the Perfected One’s gaze, that he may deign to bathe us in the dark waves of the Dao. May we, in the midst of our cultivation and study, glimpse even slightly the subtleties of the profound. By disciplining ourselves with utmost sincerity, we shall forever requite the kindness of sovereign and father; by preserving purity and wholeness of truth, we vow to follow in the footsteps of the divine immortals. We cannot express the fullness of our devotion.

Memorial for the Black Talisman Rite by the Grand Tutor and Chancellor

We have heard that the Supreme Dao has bequeathed its precepts, and the Orthodox Unity tradition has established rites of prayer and supplication; the *Hetu* has set forth its teachings, and the Great Mystery has opened the gates of repentance and gratitude. Such is the means to succor and protect human relations and to magnify the power of the Dao. Its grace and blessings have spread far and wide, revered through the ages as the ultimate source.

This humble servant, favored by the fortune of the times, has been entrusted with weighty responsibilities. Though I have striven with utmost sincerity to serve the state, my contributions remain but a drop in the ocean. Fearing that excess fortune may invite calamity, I have suffered affliction and illness. Now, as the Black Talisman takes flight and transforms, entering the Five Agents into the Central Palace, and as my natal destiny and resonant tones align, the severity of this misfortune has grown. Thus, I dare to turn my mind to the profoundest mysteries, bowing my head before the purified altar. With reverence, I prepare incense and lamps, offering solemn prayers and invocations.

May the Primordial One deign to look upon us, and may the Five Emperors extend their compassion. Let them command the noble deities of the Nine Palaces and the officials of the Three Bureaus to dissolve and dispel ill fortune, to harmonize and release enmities and grudges. May they cleanse away transgressions and stains, and augment my allotted span of prosperity. Let all ailments be soothed and long-standing illnesses healed. I vow to pour forth a heart of loyalty and filial piety, hoping to invoke the sagely and enlightened blessings. Forever shall I uphold the wondrous Dao, aspiring to reflect the boundless grace of the Mysterious. I cannot express the fullness of my devotion.

The Magistrate of Yangzhou, Lord Zongkui, and the Lady of Chen State, née [X]氏, prostrate themselves to present this memorial with the Nine Luminaries’ invocation.

We have heard that the myriad spirits of Heaven and Earth, the manifold beings of yin and yang, rely upon the primordial harmony for nurturance and the Dao’s qi for generation and completion. The Three Destinies and Five Phases determine the reckoning of fortune and misfortune; the Southern Palace and Northern Bureau govern the records of transgression and blessing. No good or evil escapes their notice, nor the slightest measure goes unaccounted.

Moreover, as the Three Origins shift and the Nine Luminaries traverse their paths, omens of censure or favor manifest, their shadows answering as echoes. How could we fail to tremble with reverence and awe before the true numina?

This humble lady’s fate is governed by the earth and fire stars, moving through the position of *wu*. Not only does this mark her life’s station, but it also resides in her bodily palace. In the minor cycle of *chou*, it becomes one of the Six Harms; in the major cycle of *xu*, it falls upon the Tomb. In the major cycle, the *wu* fate weakens; in the minor, the kingly prosperity thins at its outset. Beset by such anxieties, we fear the onset of calamity.

Thus, with utmost sincerity, we turn in devotion to the celestial patterns. Following the rites of memorial presentation, we bow our heads to the Three Heavens; preparing the offerings for prayer and invocation, we direct our hearts toward the Nine Luminaries.

We implore the Most Perfect to show compassion, and the host of sages to bestow grace. Pardon the transgressions of past years, and dissolve the karmic debts of former lives. Pacify and dispel misfortune, rescue us from inauspicious decline. Prolong our years, augment our prosperity and blessings. May we ever receive your sheltering protection, and be granted enduring peace. We vow to serve the numinous spirits with unceasing devotion and reverence. In profound submission, we offer this prayer.

**Prayer for the Birthday Nanjou Offering of Lord Zongkui, Prefect of Yangzhou**

We have heard that the celestial bodies congeal their radiance, adorning the heavens with their signs. The Upper Palace of Southern Prosperity governs the Register of Life, bestowing blessings and flowing auspiciousness, subtly aiding state and realm. The *River Chart*’s secret admonitions elucidate the texts of reverent gaze; the *Zhengyi* sacred canons likewise preserve the principles of cultivation. Daring to unfold the mysterious teachings, we devoutly exhaust our sincerity.

Your servant has long received vast favor, personally encountering this glorious era. Abundant grace and honor have been bestowed, and I have trodden the path of imperial beneficence. Yet I possess no merit to aid the times or rectify the state, and presumptuously bear the weight of the ministerial seal and military insignia. Trembling with awe, I find it difficult to repay the bounty of creation; I vow to remain reverent and diligent, hoping to requite the virtue of sovereign and parents. Only through unceasing self-discipline do I dare not neglect my beginnings or endings.

Thus, on this birthday, I meticulously perform the offering rites. Bowing my head toward the cinnabar terrace, I fix my heart upon the mysterious pole. The sacred incense smoke ascends, seeking to reach the Nine Purities; in this propitious night, I offer earnest supplication, wishing to convey it before the Six Saints. Grant that your servant’s misfortunes and obstructions be dispelled, and enmities be harmoniously resolved. Augment my blessings and emoluments, prolong my years. Pardon past transgressions, and bestow future felicity. May the Primordial Mystery elevate and deliver me, and may my entire clan enjoy peace and well-being. I vow to uphold the utmost sincerity in reverence, forever aligning with the protection of the true numina. In profound submission, I offer this prayer.

**Prayer for the Completion of the Land Pacification Offering at the Hall of the Venerable One, Mount Qingcheng**

We have heard that when the Primordial Unity first divided, forms took shape through fusion. Among them, Mount Min, vast and encompassing the western frontiers, presses upon the two rivers as its guardian and crowns the Five Peaks in majesty. It is the dwelling of immortals, harboring grotto-heavens. Its layered peaks and towering ridges cradle the sun and moon amid the clouds; its piled verdure and stacked mists separate the dust of the mortal world from the celestial realm. Here, the heavenly realm gathers its true spirits, and the city of Chengdu flourishes with magic mushrooms and herbs. This is called the Court of Blessings, presiding over such sublime terrain.

The True Lord of Mystery and Tranquility, having attained the Dao in high antiquity, is renowned among the loftiest immortals. When the Xuanyuan Emperor made his southern progress, he honored the master-disciple rites; when the Brilliant Emperor journeyed west, he further adorned and embellished the site. The Han dynasty expanded the grand shrine, and on the *Zhonghe* day, a noble title was bestowed. Ever manifesting wondrous responses, it has greatly protected the realm.

Recently, I brushed aside the mist-laden vines to gaze upon the feathered banners, and the radiant countenance of the deity remained vivid in my mind, unforgotten in waking or dreaming. Of late, the gates and layered eaves have suffered from wind and rain, their decay and ruin a growing concern as the years silently pass. Thus, I commanded the Great Master Xingzhen to measure the timber, gather the craftsmen, and achieve this grand restoration. Gleaming eaves now catch the light, and jade-like waters cascade through the air. The murals on the four walls are renewed, and the steps and thresholds of the double railings remain unchanged. The main hall has been restored, forever broadcasting the mysterious favor.

May the deities of heaven, earth, mountains, and rivers, in their proper ranks and duties, continually bestow their blessings. Greatly shelter the multitudes, that violence and aggression may not intrude. Let no pestilence or plague arise, and may crops flourish abundantly. May wind and rain come in due season, the heavens be clear, and the land be adorned with jade and pearls. Let all within the four seas—Chinese and barbarian alike—witness civil refinement and martial repose. May border beacons fall silent, and malevolent forces be annihilated. May the scripts and chariots of all directions be united, and the calendars of the Nine Provinces be harmonized. May the people receive blessings, and the ancestral temples endure forever.

Thus, I diligently perform the rites of *pingzao*, ever offering fragrant sacrifices. I have dispatched Master Du Guangting of Broad Accomplishment to devoutly conduct the grand offering, luminously expressing gratitude to the true spirits. Gazing afar at the cloud-borne chariots, I reverently hope for the mysterious gaze. Respectfully, this prayer.

**Prayer for the Second Dispatch to Mount Qingcheng to Pacify and Restore the True Spirits**

We have heard that heaven establishes its sacred precincts, and earth opens its immortal courts. Here, the true spirits reside, revered in both the hidden and manifest realms. They grasp the guiding principles of the mountain ranges and govern the fortunes of all directions. Cloud-capped peaks and rosy-hued terraces have been venerated through the ages. Bestowing blessings upon the people, they have granted favors from antiquity to the present.

Recently, I ventured through distant vines and creepers to personally approach the august hall. Gazing upon the majestic bearing of the temple and the ceremonial guards of the four walls, the numinous presence seemed alive, and my reverence deepened. Thus, I commanded that the deities’ forms be painted and displayed within the inner hall. Morning saw the lighting of jade stalks, and evening the preparation of silver lamps. My prayers were earnest for the sake of the people, and my devotion was not confined to secret invocations. Trusting in the unfailing perception of the spirits, I am certain they have witnessed this sincerity.

Now, within the mountain temple, renovations have been completed. The halls have been renewed, and a separate offering has been commanded. Free from the taint of impure offerings, the rites possess an even greater purity and solemnity. Therefore, I specially perform this offering, meticulously preparing this declaration. I humbly invite the true spirits to return to their immortal abode. May their rainbow banners and crane-drawn chariots roam the pine and moonlight realms; may orchid fragrance and thoroughwort’s scent waft along the path of emptiness and non-being. May the true domain be eternally secure, and the state and realm receive great protection. From this time forth, may the people of the world forever await vast and boundless blessings. In utmost devotion, I offer this prayer. Respectfully, this prayer.

The seventeenth fascicle of the *Guangcheng Collection* is hereby concluded.
