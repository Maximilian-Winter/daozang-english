### **Preface to the *Taiyi Jilian Neifa***

The *Book of Changes* states: "The alternation of yin and yang is called the Dao." The vastness of heaven and earth, the multitude of the ten thousand things—all confined to form and *qi*, bound within the vessels of the Dao—are none other than the flowing and transforming of the two *qi* of yin and yang. Thus, the origins of beginnings and returns, the discourse on life and death, and the causes of the hidden and the manifest are also nothing but the visible traces of this flowing transformation, the evident proof of its sincerity and trustworthiness.

Therefore, ghosts and spirits are the inherent capacities of the two *qi*, the traces of creation. In all cases, they do not transgress the principles of sincerity, trust, movement, and stillness. As for our Daoist teaching—that the dead souls receive refinement and the living bodies receive deliverance—how could this be a deception of the world? It is simply that refining yin with yang employs the flowing *qi* to refine the unobscured spirit. Thus, scattered *qi* must gather, obscured spirit must awaken, the insincere must become trustworthy, and the sunken must ascend. All of this is the natural principle of *qi* and reason.

The *Lingbao* purification rites originated with the three masters Xu, Ge, and Zheng and have circulated in the world. From the Han, Tang, Song, and Yuan dynasties onward, their paths diverged and their methods varied, intertwining in a thousandfold profusion. Yet the ultimate principle of ascending the hall and entering the chamber remains one. Moreover, the refinement and deliverance of souls are the essentials of the *Lingbao* tradition. Among these, the simplicity and directness of sacrificial refinement yield vast merit through minimal effort.

Since the Perfected Lord Ge, the Celestial Master, perfected this teaching and attained the rank of immortality, the lineages transmitted through the ages include the Danyang, Dongyang, Tongming, Yuyang, and Yangjing schools, yet none surpass the Danyang lineage of the Celestial Master. Danyang originates from Nanchang, and Nanchang is another name for *Lingbao*. Those who grasp the essentials of Danyang find no text more detailed than Master Zheng Suonan’s *Inner Method*. Its discussions are incisive and illuminating, truly what is called "revealing the unexpressed subtleties of the Celestial Master." Its teachings first emphasize the great foundation of sincerity—what is not rooted in sincerity? Thus it is said: "Sincerity is the Dao of Heaven; to embody sincerity is the work of man." If one can abide in sincerity, then the mechanisms of yin and yang and the functions of ghosts and spirits are attained.

The secrets of water and fire, the mysteries of talismans and registers, the inner refinement and ascension of the spirit—without uniting the three and the five and embodying their wondrous application, how could one achieve this? The five phases and yin-yang return to the Supreme Ultimate. As for the methods of exhausting one’s nature and fulfilling one’s destiny, restraining the *hun* and controlling the *po*, they may be said to be complete. This text is thus fitting as a model for purification rites.

Yet Master Zheng’s words all emphasize the reality of cultivating body and mind. There are warnings against changing names, altering practices, and indulging in deceptive and bewildering techniques. How could one succeed without embodying purity, absorbing truth, and eliminating defiled *qi*? I have studied several lineages, and none surpass this one.

Yuan Jinghe of Suzhou, a man of pure diligence and earnest inquiry, came to my mountain this autumn to assist in compilation. One day, he requested a preface and intended to carve the text for transmission. His aspiration is admirable, and I do not refuse but briefly set forth these principles. Those who obtain and read this text in the future should seek within themselves, devote themselves to practice, and not merely pay lip service. Then its blessings in the hidden and manifest realms will be vast indeed.

### **Postscript to the *Taiyi Jilian Neifa***

The scriptures of *Lingbao* have been transmitted since ancient times by lofty immortals and superior adepts. Those who attain them may, above, dispel celestial calamities and protect the emperor, and, below, deliver the dead and illuminate the eternal night, their salvation of humanity boundless. These teachings have long been recorded in secret texts. Among them, the *Inner Method of Sacrificial Refinement for Ghosts* was cultivated by the Supreme Ultimate Perfected Lord Ge in the mountains of Shangyu in Kuaiji. Upon completing his practice and perfecting the Dao, he ascended to the heavens. Since then, the wonders of *Lingbao* have been transmitted from master to master, and the methods of sacrificial refinement have proliferated.

Later, the ritual protocols of various lineages multiplied, diverging from the same origin and losing the original intent of *Lingbao*. Some failed to fully benefit ghosts and spirits. Master Zheng Suonan of Wu Commandery, moved by compassion for the dead souls lost in eternal night, elucidated the *Inner Method of Sacrificial Refinement*, which embodies the secret essence of *Lingbao*. Its principles are clear, its methods simple, and its divine mechanisms profound. Those who obtain this text and practice it with faith will bestow blessings upon both the hidden and the manifest.

Fearing that its transmission might not be widespread, he had it printed to disseminate it further. Yet the woodblocks were destroyed by fire, and without successors, the Master’s intent to deliver souls would have been in vain. My disciple Wang Daogui, diligent in his Daoist practice, took Master Zheng’s work to heart. He gathered patrons to re-engrave the text, ensuring that the Master’s book would not perish. Over a thousand years, how could this not be a small aid to the hidden and manifest realms?

**Respectfully inscribed on the Duanwu Festival of the year *dinghai* (1347) of the Zhizheng era by the Daoist Xu Shanzheng, the Joyous Perfected.**

### **The *Taiyi Jilian Neifa***

The *Taiyi Jilian Neifa* is the method of sacrificial refinement for ghosts devised by the Perfected Lord Ge. When a person dies, the *hun* ascends and the *po* descends—this is the norm. Yet in some cases, the *hun* and *po* fail to ascend or descend, becoming mired in the darkness of the netherworld. Their hunger and thirst, their obscured consciousness, stretch endlessly through the eternal night.

Thus, the Perfected Lord, moved by compassion, established the method of sacrificial refinement within the ritual. The *sacrifice* entails offering food and drink to dispel their hunger and thirst. The *refinement* employs spirit and essence to illuminate their darkness. Through this, those mired in suffering are released like melting ice, restoring their original true nature. Truly, this method is great.

The scholar Zheng Suonan of Wu recorded what had been transmitted to him and carved it into woodblocks to instruct others. Daoist texts are held in strict secrecy; unless a disciple presents gold and silk, swears an oath to heaven, and receives the transmission, it is deemed a profane leak—such leaks incur karmic retribution in the unseen realm. Yet Suonan’s intent was one with that of the Perfected Lord Ge. He reflected: when people die, their kin do not know whether the *hun* and *po* of their loved ones have ascended and descended or remain mired in darkness. If this method could illuminate their obscurity, lift them from their mire, and raise them to the heights of clarity—reviving the dead and restoring flesh to bone—would it not bring solace to the hearts of fathers, brothers, sons, and younger brothers? Thus, this method should be made available to every household, and people should trust and practice it. For this reason, he carved it into woodblocks to disseminate it widely, and it cannot be called a profane leak.

The old printing blocks were destroyed by fire, and no one had been able to reprint them. Wang Daogui of the Xuanming Daoist Abbey in the prefectural city, however, gathered support from those of goodwill to reprint this book. In doing so, those who had not yet heard of it could now see and practice it—this, too, was Suonan’s intent, and Daogui made good use of his heart. Daogui, knowing that I had once studied this text, asked me to write a preface, and so I could not refuse.

In the seventh year of the Zhizheng era, the year *dinghai*, on the *guiyou* day of the fourth lunar month, Zhang Xun wrote this preface.

The Perfected Lord of the Supreme Ultimate received the Dao of the Numinous Treasure from the Three Ancient Masters of Mystery. From this arose the ritual for sacrificing to ghosts and the method of refinement and deliverance, which spread throughout the world. A single bowl of rice can sate ten thousand ghosts; a single talisman can deliver ten thousand souls. Its application is simple, its meaning profound, its salvation vast, and its merit great. Yet as time passed, later generations fond of novelty often altered its teachings, mixing and corrupting them until they became chaotic and inconsistent, leaving scholars without guidance.

Master Zheng Suonan was a scholar well-versed in the Three Teachings. With a mind that encompassed Confucianism, Daoism, and Buddhism, he gathered and examined the sacrificial and refinement methods of various Daoist schools, cutting away the superfluous and excising the false. He provided earnest and detailed explanations, compiling them into a single volume to bequeath to learners. By enabling them to follow the source and advance, aiding and delivering the suffering spirits, he achieved both breadth and precision. He once printed and distributed the text, but it later fell victim to a fire, and the blocks were lost.

Now, Wang Daogui of the Yuan dynasty, a man devoted to the Dao, feared that the method would be lost to time. He thus gathered support from many and had the text re-carved into woodblocks to ensure its immortality. Had he not harbored a heart of benevolence, could he have done this?

Yet the great Dao is formless. People, confined by form, embody the Dao. The precelestial realm contains things, and the heart, by investigating things, comes to know heaven and humanity. We share the same essence with all our fellow beings, and their suffering is our own—our sorrows and joys are not separate. The key lies in the learner’s daily practice: maintaining a mind of clarity and stillness, inner and outer purity, like ice melting in spring or clouds dispersing to reveal the bright moon. When inner and outer harmonize, the mechanism of opening and closing arises. Life flourishes without cease, bridging the seen and unseen, the bright and obscure. Illuminating the principles of transformation, it endures through change, responding to things without partiality, moving and resting in accord. Thus, all—whether the seven primordial spirits of heaven and humanity, the four modes of birth, the six paths of existence, or even insects, plants, and trees—merge with one’s own nature, entering the natural state together. Enemies and kin alike are universally delivered, unbound and at ease, expanding into the vastness of empty space to become ageless.

In this way, one does not betray the sacrificial and refinement methods of the Perfected Lord or the sincerity of Suonan’s guidance. Those who do not cultivate this yet speak of the refinement method—I do not understand them. Learners should strive diligently.

On the full moon of the second month of the *dinghai* year of the Zhizheng era, the Daoist Yixuan Qingxuzi of Western Shu, awaiting rectification, respectfully wrote this with bowed hands.

I, a scholar-farmer, have not starved for lack of archery or metallurgy, yet my understanding of the Dao remains unclear, blind to jade and stone alike. I owe it to the painful discipline of my late teacher, Mr. Jushan, which I still cannot endure to this day—thus, I will never forget it. At times, I dream of one or two things among ten thousand, or suffer through bitter chanting and mad laughter, or sit in cold silence cursing Chan. I wish to grasp past and present and transcend the realm of form, sitting in madness and self-intoxication, letting life ebb away in death—how could I know anything of all this?

Some laugh at me, saying: "In the past, you wrote two books—one on the Buddhist *dāna* of feeding spirits, the other on Daoist sacrificial refinement. Are you not still mired in dregs?" Hearing this, I feel as if playing with an old dream in the palm of my hand, utterly unaware of what these "dregs" truly are. Indeed, they are dregs.

Others say: "Let us discuss this in order."
I reply: The Dao is a name born of necessity; the method is its necessary application. All things and affairs employ methods. Zhuangzi said: "Take the root as essence, the branches as coarse." Is this so? Is it not so? In my earlier years, I wrote those two books when my childish habits had not yet faded. Yet the methods of sacrificial refinement in the world are myriad and divergent in purpose.

Take thunder, for example: it is the *qi* of yin and yang clashing and breaking. Those who wield thunder in practice must use the *qi* of their own five phases to clash and break for effect. Why invoke thunder? The names of Thunder Ancestors and Thunder Deities vary widely. Beyond the Orthodox Unity method, there is the Qingwei method, with thunder names numbering in the hundreds. As recorded in Bai Yuchan’s writings, the Orthodox Unity method alone has over a hundred thunder names, and based on my own experience, these do not even encompass all of them.

The various thunder methods and their countless variations—even focusing on one method—reveal that the transmitted incantations, *qi*, talismans, visualizations, and essential principles differ in thousands of ways. What began as one method has become hundreds or thousands through corruption. Some transmit over two hundred lineages of the Slaying and Investigating Thunder, over three hundred lineages of the Divine Officials, and over one hundred and eighty lineages of the Earth Deities. Then there are those who teach the Great Dao of the Golden Elixir, some bowing to over three hundred and fifty masters, others to over ninety—yet these are still not exhaustive of other methods.

In this age, those who speak of the great Dao, the Golden Elixir, and various methods are as numerous as hemp or reeds. Truly, no single person or perspective could encompass them all.

Moreover, in distant lands beyond our borders, where the ways of our Middle Kingdom are not practiced, the various methods they follow differ from place to place, each with its own efficacy. Even three to five hundred years ago, there were no such things as the Slaying and Investigating Thunder, the Divine Officials, or the Earth Deities. As for the scriptures and biographies of the immortals, though a few names of the ancient transcendents’ methods remain, they have already diverged considerably—and today, even these are no longer transmitted. Thus, we may know that in the ten thousand years to come, names and practices will shift and multiply, giving rise to ever more methods born of novelty, startling the eyes and ears, clamoring in this degenerate age, branching into countless errors beyond reckoning. If we consider the world from ancient times to the present, the teachings and learning of the four directions are wild and incoherent, endlessly reinvented, sowing ever greater confusion. This is the corruption of a declining age, the fault of men’s love of the strange and their infatuation with names. They alter and embellish, deceiving themselves and others, leading the blind to teach the blind—no wonder things have come to this. Naturally, there are verses about the Daoist who bowed to a thousand masters, or the man who only received the true transmission at sixty-four. Yet all those he bowed to before were not true teachers.

Laozi said: *"My Dao is very easy to know, very easy to practice. My Dao is level, yet the people prefer byways."* Byways are narrow paths. How, then, should seekers of the Dao and its methods proceed? Some insist on their own rightness, others denounce what they deem wrong—whom, in the end, should the learner follow? If one claims the Dao is one, yet divides it in two, how much worse when it splinters into ten thousand? Without the true eye to illuminate past and present, who is not eroded by perverse *qi*, delighting in false splendor and never awakening? Future generations will be led astray by what they call the Dao. The Dao itself offers nothing to men; men deceive themselves. Though the books of the ancient sages and immortals remain, those who seek to expound their subtle principles refuse to embody their virtue in practice. Without great merit and deep cultivation, one will never encounter a true teacher. My own karma is not yet severed, my true heart not yet one with Heaven and Earth. It is not that Heaven and Earth forbid it, nor that the perfected ones withhold themselves from this world. Yet men, with their frail bodies, squander their scant spirit in frantic pursuit, dreaming of a world where their hearts, desires, affairs, deceptions, doctrines, and karmic deeds multiply ten thousandfold. They cling to this dream, forging it into an unchanging heaven of their own making. Though they pass through ten thousand cycles—though metal and stone rot, seas and mountains wither—the deluded masses remain lost in chaos, never awakening from their confusion. How tragic!

Thus, the Most High condescended to the needs of sentient beings, bending to offer expedient means. To relieve the suffering of the dark realms, these methods were transmitted to the world below. Once, Lord Ge the Immortal greatly expounded the heart of the Most High. But after him, none have fully revealed Lord Ge’s intent, and over time, the teachings have grown ever more distorted and fragmented. Who will correct them? Though the azure heavens arch above, none may ascend to inquire of their mysteries. Thus, even my *Book of Sacrificial Refinement* is but the muttering of a dreamer—translating my dream to awaken theirs, yet their slumber is deep, their folly profound. This is why both I and all beings are cast adrift upon the waves of the dream-sea. Why, then, do we still dance with empty words, parading our vanity?

Alas! Who will strike the great void thrice to rouse the drowned? I offer this preface, and so I have prefaced.

—Written by the Old Man of Three Exiles, Zheng Suonan

**Preface to the *Inner Methods of the Supreme Ultimate’s Sacrificial Refinement*, Volume One**
Compiled by Zheng Suonan

All who share this aspiration and wish to awaken the heart of the Dao to deliver the suffering of the dark realms must first submit a memorial to the Supreme Heavenly Worthy, invoking the Primordial Response of the Left Immortal of the Supreme Ultimate and the True Lord of Trust and Protection. They must vow to remain steadfast from beginning to end. On the Three Primes—
- the fifteenth day of the first month (Upper Prime),
- the fifteenth day of the seventh month (Middle Prime),
- the fifteenth day of the tenth month (Lower Prime)—
and the Five Laba Festivals—
- the first day of the first month (Heavenly Laba),
- the fifth day of the fifth month (Earthly Laba),
- the seventh day of the seventh month (Moral Laba),
- the first day of the tenth month (People’s Year Laba),
- the eighth day of the twelfth month (Kingly Laba)—
these are the Eight Days of Liberation and the Eight Festivals. The twenty-eight assemblies of the year—including the *gengshen* and *jiazi* days, the solstices and equinoxes, and the beginnings of the four seasons—are indispensable for the sacrificial refinement of the dark realms. Yet to truly aid the spirits, one must not adorn the practice with empty embellishments. One must constantly cultivate the inner refinement: nurturing the spirit within, upholding precepts without. When the time comes to practice, resonance will arise naturally.

On the day before the ritual, issue a petition to the City God. On the day itself, maintain unbroken recitation. Silently chant the sacred name of the Supreme One from the *Central Chapter of the Numinous Book*, and reverently inscribe the *Precious Register* along with the *Danyang Talisman*. At deep night, in a secluded place, solemnly arrange pure incense, pure rice, bamboo branches, and pure water. Prepare a basin of bathing water, burn the *Danyang Talisman*, and cast it into the bathing pool. Then, burn the *Precious Register* outside, sit in silence for a long while, and proceed as if the hour were at hand. If the stars are aligned, offer incense and silently pray, adjusting the timing as needed to avoid disappointing the spirits’ expectations. Practicing thus night after night is especially efficacious.

**Inner Refinement Method**
Enter the chamber, sit upright, calm the mind, and settle the thoughts. Regulate the breath until the *qi* is stable, and remain in stillness for a long while. Then visualize the true *qi* of the lower cinnabar field as a flame, like a great red jade pellet, revolving nine times to the left—vivid and distinct. After a long while, when the Jade Pond is full, this is the external sign of kidney water ascending. The true fire, a single pellet, then rises to the Crimson Palace of the heart, called the *Southern Prosperity Upper Palace* or the *Cinnabar Fire Court of Flowing Fire*, where it kindles a blazing, molten flame.

Visualize your entire body as engulfed in flames. After a long while, refine your form into the likeness of an infant, seated upright within the Crimson Palace. Then your body is restored to its original state. The infant gradually ascends the Twelve-Storied Tower to the Golden Gate and Jade Chamber—this is the Mud Pill Palace at the crown of the head. The infant then transforms into the sacred image of the Heavenly Worthy, seated within the palace, holding a green jade bowl in the left hand and a hollow azure branch in the right. This is the Most High Heavenly Worthy of Salvation from Suffering; the visualization must be exceedingly clear.

The heart is called the Crimson Palace; the mouth, the Jade Pond; the space three inches between the brows, the Mud Pill; the area between the two kidneys, the Cinnabar Field. These will be explained in detail later.

**Method for Inscribing the Heavenly Treasure Register**
In the present method, the Six Stars of the Southern Dipper are not employed, nor are incantations applied. For those who wish to use them, the method will be given later.

When inscribing the Treasure Register, first retire early to a quiet chamber, purify yourself, sit in silence, and practice the Inner Refinement Method. Then visualize the Heavenly Worthy of Salvation from Suffering seated in the Mud Pill Palace, radiant with auspicious light. Kneel and secretly petition: "Your disciple now inscribes the Treasure Register to universally deliver the dark and hidden realms, that the dead souls may undergo refinement and immediately ascend to heaven. Your disciple acts by the decree of the Most High Heavenly Worthy of Salvation from Suffering." After clearly visualizing each detail, proceed to inscribe the Treasure Register.

Press the *chou* mark on the left middle finger, and with the brush, make three strokes to the left.
Press the single mark above *chou* on the left index finger, and with the brush, make three strokes to the right.
Press the single mark below *wu* on the left middle finger, and with the brush, make three strokes to the left.
Press the *wu* mark on the left middle finger, and with the brush, make three strokes to the right.

On the upper section of the Treasure Register, write in cinnabar. Silently recite the four syllables *oṃ hūṃ trāḥ hrīḥ* in order: write *oṃ* above the *hūṃ* mark, *hūṃ* above the *trāḥ* mark, *trāḥ* above the *hrīḥ* mark. For each character written, press one mudra and make three strokes. With each stroke, silently recite *oṃ hūṃ trāḥ hrīḥ* once. This forms four mudras and twelve strokes, with the incantation recited twelve times to complete the Register. Then rest the cinnabar brush upon the Register, close your eyes, and visualize a single pellet of true fire in your lower Cinnabar Field—vivid and distinct. After a long while, when you sense water rising in your mouth, the true fire pellet ascends to the Crimson Palace and transforms into the Cinnabar Fire Court. The firelight blazes forth, and within it appears a fire bell, resplendent as the sun.

Swiftly exhale upon the talisman, then form the *wu* mudra and brush it out with the cinnabar pen. Visualize the Treasure Register transforming into a fire bell, ascending through the Mud Pill Palace, rising ever higher and farther, vanishing into the distance.

Next, recite the Perfected Lord’s Incantation:
*"The Most High Perfected Lord decrees to Kunlun:
With one divine talisman, deliver the hidden souls.
Hasten, hasten, as the statutes command!"*
Press the central mark on the left middle finger.

**Format of the Treasure Register**
Write in cinnabar on yellow paper, then affix three talismanic seals upon the Register. If dedicating the Register to a specific departed soul, inscribe another separately with the deceased’s name.

*The Most High Decree of the Treasure Register for Liberation and Ascension to Heaven*
Proclaimed to deliver all beings of the Five Paths and Four Births—orphaned souls, male and female—and to elevate their ranks and grant rebirth, raising them to the immortal realms. As this decree commands, let it be swiftly transmitted by wind and fire couriers.

In the cyclical year ____, month ____, day ____, at an auspicious hour.
Your subordinate disciple [Name], acting by decree.

**Format for the Memorial of Ritual Refinement**
On the day before the ritual, dispatch the memorial; no separate petition is required.

To the Altar of the Supreme Ultimate Ritual Refinement:
Memorial to the Lord of the City God of this prefecture, under the seal of the Southern Prosperity Refinement Bureau.

This altar, on the ___ day of the present month, will conduct the Supreme Ultimate Ritual Refinement at [location] to deliver all beings of the Five Paths and Four Births—orphaned souls and lingering spirits. We hereby notify your office to transmit this memorial, summoning all hidden souls to assemble at the altar for deliverance. This is an official document; we request that you promptly convey our sincere intent and memorialize the Most Compassionate Heavenly Worthy of Salvation, beseeching the issuance of a decree to be proclaimed throughout the Ten Directions and Three Realms, reaching every corner of the darkest hells and hidden prisons. Let all be illuminated and liberated, that every hidden soul may come to the altar on the appointed night to partake of offerings, hear the Dharma, undergo refinement, attain rebirth, receive the Register, and ascend to the heavenly realms. Let there be no delay, lest the deliverance be hindered.

If dedicating the ritual to a specific name, include that intent in the transmission.

In the cyclical year ____, month ____, day ____, at an auspicious hour.
Memorial submitted by the disciple of the Most High [Register Name], conducting the Supreme Ultimate Ritual Refinement, [Name] (seal).
If the practitioner has not received the Register, address as "Disciple of the Dao."

**Method for Entering the Chamber and Sitting in Refinement**
All the following are to be performed in silent meditation while seated.

On the day of the ritual, first inscribe the Elixir Yang Talisman and the Treasure Register. That night, before the rice offering, light a stick of pure incense and prepare a bowl of purified water with bamboo sprigs, and another bowl of water as the Bathing Pool. Burn the Elixir Yang Talisman and cast it into the Bathing Pool, then burn the Treasure Register in the censer. Once all is prepared, sit in meditation; do not move again until the practice is complete.

At deep night, in a secluded place where no one passes, sit in meditation. After a long while, practice the Inner Refinement Method, then visualize the Heavenly Worthy of Salvation from Suffering seated in your Mud Pill Palace. Kneel and secretly recite the incantation, beseeching the release of boundless light to shatter the hells.

Then behold the Heavenly Worthy of the Great Unity emitting boundless light from the Mud Pill Palace, descending northward along the eighteen vertebrae of the spine to the region below the two kidneys, collectively called the Fengdu Prison. The radiance blazes and flashes, illuminating the Three Realms, dispelling all suffering. The mountain prisons are emptied, and all condemned souls are liberated.

*(Sound of the mallet.)*

**Summoning the Souls**
As before, state your dharma rank and name, and with utmost sincerity, acting by the command of the Most High, broadly summon all beings—past, present, and future, throughout the infinite Ten Directions—of the Five Paths: divine, human, animal, hungry ghost, and hell realms, as well as all those in the empty vastness, the dark and cold realms, the sunken souls and lingering spirits. By the power of this Dao, come to the sacred altar, receive the merit, and attain deliverance.

To extend the boundless pervasion of the Dharma Realm and universally reach all hidden souls, silently recite the *Universal Summons*, stating your dharma rank and name, and with wholehearted devotion, invoke as follows. For simplicity, the *Universal Summons* text from the preceding method is provided below.

Visualize the Ten Directions—limitless and innumerable—where all ghostly souls ascend through the Ghost Gate, following the path of your seated form. Behind your left shoulder lies the Ghost Gate of the northeast. Next, envision the Cinnabar Yang Talisman Water Pool transforming into an infinite, boundless ocean, universally summoning all hidden souls. Each receives the generative qi of the Five Phases, simultaneously restoring their forms and bathing together. Silently recite the *Great Cinnabar Yang Incantation*:

*"The Dragon Han flows vast, formless and nameless.
Through boundless kalpas, the Imperial Dao emerges in clarity.
Luminous and radiant, the Nine Dragons spew their essence.
Jade Void gleams bright, the Great Aurora shines high.
The Primal Beginning transforms, all heavens unite in spirit.
The Three Origins guide and nourish, the Two Images gather life.
Those unliberated are liberated, those unfulfilled are fulfilled.
The dead are transformed, the withered flourish.
All wriggling creatures and hidden spirits,
those conceived and gestating, all receive life.
Yin souls whose fates have ended ascend to the Three Clarities.
Their po souls undergo refinement, transformed in the Southern Palace.
Today is a great celebration—all attain radiance.
The Five Emperors reflect and illuminate, universally proclaiming to the myriad spirits.
Heavenly gods and earthly deities, rivers and springs,
the Five Peaks and Four Waterways, all renowned mountains,
the Caverns of Mystery, Depth, Numinosity, and Immortality,
the Boundless Great Dao, the Perfect and True Great Spirits—
infinite and boundless, universally overseeing the salvation of beings.
The roots of earth are severed, names recorded in the Dark Capital.
All gods universally illuminate—let all heed!"*

Upon completing the silent incantation, visualize the assembled souls restored in form, emerging from their bath. All humans—men to the left, women to the right—are clad in immortal robes. All creatures, whether domesticated or wild, are purified and grouped by kind.

Then, envision within your Mud Pill Palace the Most High Heavenly Worthy, holding a green jade bowl in the left hand and a malachite branch in the right. Silently and earnestly petition for the descent of sweet dew nectar into the pure water, reciting: *"The Most High Heavenly Worthy bestows sweet dew sevenfold."* Thereupon, perceive the Most High Heavenly Worthy in the empty void, his sacred form vast and distinctly clear, his right hand sprinkling sweet dew into the water bowl. The pure water transforms into sweet dew. In stillness, the practitioner sprinkles the sweet dew upon the ritual food, instantly rendering it fragrant, moist, and sweet. Silently recite the *Middle Chapter of the Numinous Scripture* three times, causing the ritual food to expand boundlessly, filling the Ten Directions. Behold all souls dwelling in an infinite world of white purity, partaking of the abundant feast. Sweet dew is universally bestowed upon all hidden souls, who drink their fill and are sated. Allow a brief moment for them to feast to their content.

**Water Refinement Practice**
Without reciting incantations, inscribing talismans, or forming mudras, first visualize a point of extreme brightness between the two kidneys, which soon expands like the full moon. Gaze upon it intently until water and fire commingle, generating Jade Pool water. The moon wheel ascends to the crown of the head, as luminous as the midnight moon on the fifteenth night, positioned among the eight stars of the Well constellation. Begin the activation of Yellow Flower water, visualizing the moon precisely within the Well’s eight stars. Naturally, the spine’s water ascends like the Celestial River, piercing the crown. Between the Well stars, the moon’s radiance illuminates the source of the Celestial River, stirring forth yellow-hued water flowers, gradually suffusing the upper palate.

Presently, perceive true water flowing from the crown onto the tongue, filling the mouth with sweet, fragrant, and refreshing nectar—this is one’s own Yellow Flower true water. Immediately, the space before you transforms into an immense expanse of yellow-hued water flowers, boundless and infinite. All hidden souls bathe within, refining their essence and marrow, their complexions nourished and lustrous. After a long while, the refined souls emerge, their forms radiant, their inner and outer aspects gleaming and pure. Upon completion of refinement, the water naturally vanishes.

**Well Constellation**

**Fire Refinement Practice**
Without reciting incantations, inscribing talismans, or forming mudras, visualize a point of true qi between the two kidneys, which soon expands like a great red sun wheel. Gaze upon it intently until water and fire commingle, and Jade Pool water ascends. The sun wheel rises to the Crimson Palace, emitting blazing, molten-gold fire. Behold flames transforming into a vast conflagration, filling the void with scorching heat. All hidden souls joyfully enter the fire’s crucible, each enveloped in its radiance. Upon completion of refinement, turn the gaze inward and downward—naturally, the fire vanishes.

At this point, all distinctions of form are forgotten. Each soul transforms into an infant, all clad in immortal robes, arrayed to the left and right, ready to receive the Three Refuges and Nine Precepts.

First, take refuge in the Most High Boundless Great Dao.
Second, take refuge in the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures.
Third, take refuge in all Sacred Perfected Immortal Masters.

Having taken refuge in the Three Treasures, you shall now receive and uphold the Nine Wondrous Precepts of the Perfected:

1. Respect, yield, and filially support your parents.
2. Diligently serve your sovereign with loyalty.
3. Do not kill; compassionately save all beings.
4. Do not commit adultery; maintain purity in body and conduct.
5. Do not steal; promote righteousness and restrain selfishness.
6. Do not harbor anger or oppress others with cruelty.
7. Do not deceive or harm the virtuous with treachery.
8. Do not be arrogant or neglect the Perfect Truth.
9. Do not waver; uphold the precepts with single-minded devotion.

After joyfully receiving each precept, silently intone the register’s thread. Visualize the precious register transforming into countless, innumerable registers, each hidden soul receiving one. Each soul, holding their register, ascends to the heavenly realms.

Now that you have all taken refuge in the Three Treasures and received and upheld the Nine Precepts, each of you holds this Most High Precious Register. Immediately, you shall ascend to heaven, eternally serving the Dao and its teachings—never forget the words of the precepts.

Thereupon, visualize a fire bell flying forth from your heart, blazing resplendent as the sun. It rises past the Mud Pill Palace, piercing through the crown of your head, ascending ever higher and farther. Each soul, like an infant, rides a lotus flower, following the radiant light of the fire bell upward, vanishing into the distance. Then, turn your gaze downward and inwardly observe: the Jade Pool’s waters rise, and all transformations return to stillness. Once the refinement is complete, you must again turn your gaze downward and inwardly observe, for the Jade Pool’s waters ascend, and creation returns to its source.

After a long while, gently emerge from concentration—lest the heart-fire flare upward and cause harm.

The true qi of the Five Phases in mutual generation follows its proper sequence. Press the five hand seals, blow the qi of the five viscera onto the Cinnabar Yang Talisman, and comprehend the principle of the Five Phases in mutual generation within the five viscera.

**Cinnabar Yang Talisman** (written in yellow on blue paper): Its function pertains to the internal affairs of the Yellow and Black Yang Essences.
Press the middle crease of the middle finger.

Sit in silence and visualize between the two kidneys at the waist a point of utmost brightness. Soon, it expands to the size of the moon’s disk, then rises to illuminate the Central Palace—the place between the heart below and the kidneys above where water and fire unite in natural congress. Here, the Jade Pool’s waters are born. Then, raise the moon disk to the crown of the head, whereupon you see within the moon above five-colored flowing essences and the qi of purple radiance. Draw it in through the nose, hold it in the mouth, and blow it onto the talisman. Next, gather the true qi of the Five Phases in mutual generation and blow it onto the talisman as well.

Apply three talismans to the Precious Register. For the Six Star Officers of the Southern Dipper, use vermilion script as previously instructed.

Within the register, visualize the Most High Heavenly Worthy receiving the decree and proceeding. Then, envision your own Crimson Palace transforming into the Vermilion Fire Mansion, its towering pavilions vast and lofty. See the Six Stars of the Southern Dipper, large as winnowing baskets, resplendent above. Hold this vision clearly, take up your brush, and dot the vermilion. Recite the names of the Six Star Lords of the Southern Dipper, and apply the vermilion to each star:

*Lǐzhǐhuǒ Tiānzūnshèng* (chant three times, then apply to one star).

For the first star, press the *mǎo* crease on the left hand.
For the second star, press the *chén* crease on the left hand.
For the third star, press the lower crease of the *wǔ* finger on the left hand.
For the fourth star, press the upper crease of the *chǒu* finger on the left hand.
For the fifth star, press the upper crease of the *zǐ* finger on the left hand.
For the sixth star, press the lower crease of the *wèi* finger on the left hand.

After reciting the names of the six stars three times, apply the vermilion to one star. Upon reaching the sixth star, set down the brush, raise your head, close your eyes, and visualize the six stars distinctly. Draw in their starlight, then press the lower crease of the *wèi* finger on the left hand, exhale qi onto the brush, and sweep it outward. Envision the Six Stars of the Southern Dipper, their radiance manifesting upon the register.

For souls born in *zǐ* or *hài*: do not apply to the first star.
For souls born in *chǒu* or *xū*: do not apply to the second star.
For souls born in *yín* or *yǒu*: do not apply to the third star.
For souls born in *mǎo* or *shēn*: do not apply to the fourth star.
For souls born in *chén* or *wèi*: do not apply to the fifth star.
For souls born in *sì* or *wǔ*: do not apply to the sixth star.

This method applies to all named souls with recorded lifespans. If the lifespan is unknown, or for universal deliverance of wandering souls, do not apply to the third star. *Yín* is the ghostly path and the root of generative qi—the beginning of the year, also signifying the empty true fire of due south.

Here, the method for applying the six stars is appended for those who wish to use it. If the six stars are not applied to the Precious Register, they remain ineffectual—all six are left empty. If faith is insufficient, first apply the six stars, then proceed with the register.

*Oṃ hūṃ trāḥ lī ya.*

**Universal Invocation**

For the deliverance of named souls to the human realm, state: *"For [Name], I deliver the deceased [Name]."* By the power of the Three Treasures, may their roots and dust be cleansed, that they may receive refinement, liberation, and purity.

With single-minded reverence, I invoke the Dao realms of the ten directions, the High Perfected of the Emperor on High, the True Lords of myriad spirits, the celestial patterns of the firmament, and all divine immortals. May you bestow your compassionate radiance, universally cleansing the roots and dust of all beings and bestowing the blessings of the Dharma offering.

I now invoke the boundless realms of empty space, the heavens of the Three Realms, the celestial beings and their companions. May the immortals of the celestial realms near and above bestow their compassion, universally bearing witness. May all who have fallen be universally refined.

I now invoke the boundless realms of empty space, all immeasurable divine hosts, the mountain and river spirits of the world below, the spirits governing the age, the righteous spirits of the earth, the deities of the altars of soil and grain, the city gods, the local earth gods, the immortals of the Five Penetrations, the officials and spirits of the underworld, the Generals of the Five Paths, the earth spirits of graves and mounds, and all ghostly officials, clerks, and attendants—innumerable and boundless. May you all arouse your compassionate hearts and bear witness to this refinement.

I now summon the boundless realms of empty space, all immeasurable hosts of the human realm—within and beyond the Middle Kingdom, the four seas and ten thousand directions, past and present, named and unnamed, imperial kin and great ministers, civil and military officials, inner and outer bureaucrats, clerks and soldiers, the Three Teachings and Nine Schools, the myriad clans and common folk, Confucians, Daoists, Buddhists, and nuns, farmers, gardeners, artisans, and merchants, all manner of livelihoods and trades, loyal ministers and righteous scholars, filial sons and chaste women, recluses and wanderers, the idle and the content, practitioners of Daoist arts, medicine, divination, astrology, fishing, woodcutting, hunting, and herding, butchers, wine-sellers, brokers, and middlemen, boatmen, drivers, and attendants, shamans, translators, and performers, beggars, thieves, the deaf, blind, lame, and mute, the paralyzed, consumptive, and leprous, those afflicted with tumors, hernias, asthma, swellings, wind diseases, madness, and epilepsy, infants, the senile, the widowed, orphaned, and solitary, the aged, the short-lived, and the prematurely dead, those who met good or violent ends, struck down by heaven or lightning, slain by spirits or ghosts, drowned, burned, or frozen, devoured by beasts or stung by insects, executed by state punishment, flayed, hanged, or shot, those who died by their own hand, by curses, poison, nightmares, or in foreign lands, in prison, in battle, by cold or heat, crushed or dashed, suddenly, in childbirth, all ancestral fathers and mothers, husbands, wives, and concubines, sons and daughters, kin and dependents, the newly deceased and the long-transformed, those entangled in ancestral disputes and lawsuits—all suffering and deceased souls of the human realm, immeasurable and boundless. May they all be liberated and come to receive this refinement.

Now I summon and invite all boundless beings across the empty expanse of the cosmos—every immeasurable multitude of beasts and creatures: phoenixes, cranes, swallows, wild geese, orioles, egrets, crows, sparrows; tigers, sheep, oxen, horses, deer, swine, cats, dogs; dragons, fish, shrimp, crabs, tortoises, clams, snails, frogs; snakes, ants, crickets, mosquitoes, bees, butterflies, fireflies, cicadas; all birds and beasts, insects and fish, aquatic clans, the tiniest stirring life, the faintest flicker of spirit. Such are the beings of the animal realm, immeasurable and boundless. May they all be liberated and come to receive this refinement.

Now I summon and invite all boundless multitudes across the empty expanse of the cosmos—every immeasurable host of hungry ghosts: the starving, the parched, the emaciated; the demons and specters, the pushers of tides and shifters of sands; all ghostly servitors. Such are the hungry ghosts, immeasurable and boundless. May they all be liberated and come to receive this refinement.

Now I summon and invite all boundless multitudes across the empty expanse of the cosmos—every immeasurable assembly of hell-dwellers: the vast and layered hells of Beidou and Luofeng; the deepest, most agonizing realms; the Nine Dark Prisons of Heaven; the Gorge of Stone and Lake of Blood; the Thirty-Six Hells; the Twenty-Four Great Prisons of the Ghost Marshals; the Avīci Hell, the Iron Enclosure, the Azure City Mountains; the Twenty-Four Hells of Mount Tai and its underworld courts; the hells of the Five Peaks; the prisons of Taiyi’s Prison Mountain and all other mountain hells; all infernal realms, all city gods and bureaucratic offices; all prisoners, great and small, light and heavy; all hellish wardens, jailers, and beastly minions. Such are these beings, immeasurable and boundless. May they all be liberated and come to receive this refinement.

Thus do I invoke the myriad deities of the ten directions. May they deign to cast their merciful light, universally illuminating all beings. May those in the Five Realms who remain unliberated attain liberation at once and universally receive this refinement.

Each being’s past karma differs; now, according to their deeds, pure offerings manifest before them. Though these appear as worldly sustenance, they are wholly ambrosia, imbued with pure savor, sating each to fullness. The Dharma is bestowed equally, without distinction between the living and the dead. May all ghosts and spirits partake together in this offering.

*Concluding the Upper Scroll of the Supreme Ultimate’s Inner Rites of Offering and Refinement*
*Commencing the Middle Scroll: Discourse on the Supreme Ultimate’s Inner Rites of Offering and Refinement*

Compiled by the Elder of Three Exiles, Zheng Suonan.
Those who wish to perform the rites of offering and refinement must first study this discourse with care. Those who do not engage in seated inner refinement are not companions of my Dao.

Between Heaven and Earth, there is but one Way of utmost sincerity. As the *Doctrine of the Mean* states: "Only the utmost sincerity under Heaven can fully unfold the great principles of Heaven and Earth, establish their great foundation, and comprehend their transformative nurturance." Thus, in all matters, great or small, utmost sincerity must be the master. A single insincere thought is pretense; a single insincere act is failure—how much more so in matters concerning ghosts and spirits?

The virtue of ghosts and spirits flows abundantly, as if above, as if to the left and right. Yet if the heart is not present, one sees but does not perceive, hears but does not listen. How then can one move Heaven and Earth? How can one stir ghosts and spirits? With a single thought of utmost concentration, the Great One abides above, the host of souls stands before you—visible as a forest, solemn as if alive. All arises from the density of a single thought, moving in perfect transformation, subtly communicating. Its wondrous changes all emerge from the heart.

Mencius said: "Hold fast, and it remains; let go, and it perishes." Does this not speak of the heart? Those who perform the rites of offering and refinement should heed these words and first establish utmost sincerity as their foundation. Utmost sincerity is a heart utterly pure, without the slightest杂念. Without sincerity, there is nothing. With sincerity, one becomes human; when sincerity dissolves into itself, one becomes Heaven. In all matters, utmost sincerity must be considered first, before discussing the method itself.

The method of offering and refinement is one of the rarest and most excellent practices. I have inquired extensively, yet the Supreme Ultimate Immortal Lord is distant. In the world today, those who perform these rites each claim their method as the true lineage of the Immortal Lord. Talismans and incantations vary, schools proliferate like rivers and lakes, their numbers beyond counting. Yet if one holds fast to utmost sincerity, there will be no lack of response. If we speak of what is truly proper and reasonable, this method is a seated refinement practice, exceedingly simple yet profoundly wondrous in its embrace of the hidden and the dark. I do not boast, but wish only for this excellent method to circulate in the world, so that all under Heaven who love the Dao may practice inner refinement, and every soul may cease its suffering in the hidden darkness.

Some may ask: "Why do you claim your transmission is the most excellent?" I reply: This method of offering and refinement focuses first on deeply settling into stillness and nurturing the yang spirit. Only then, with utmost sincerity, does one refine the yin ghosts. These two are united into a single, precise effort. If the slightest inversion of intent occurs, the spirit naturally returns to its source. Those who have not yet reached this stage must sit in stillness within themselves, employing visualization with care. Today, many practitioners focus their visualization on external matters, unaware that the myriad transformations of Heaven and Earth are fully contained within the body.

They speak of drawing in the qi of the Heavenly Gate, the ancestral qi of the Three Pure Ones, the generative qi of the ten directions, the green qi of the East, the white qi of the West, or visualizing golden light in countless rays descending upon their bodies. They suddenly visualize the Most High Heavenly Worthy, the Scarlet Palace of Fire, or the Celestial River and the Eastern Well—all external matters. Some seek to merge qi, such as exhaling liver qi while visualizing it meeting the green qi of the East, then inhaling it back—claiming to unite the most numinous qi of Heaven and Earth with their own. Such practices, calling it "merging qi," combine inner qi with outer qi, yet remain external. How can this compare to circulating the true transformations within one’s own body?

People are deluded by forms and fixated on the distant, believing the Most High Heavenly Worthy must reside in the Nine Heavens above, in the Eastern Ultimate Palace. Yet they do not realize that the Most High Heavenly Worthy is none other than one’s own original spirit. As the *Hidden Canon* states: "The Heavenly Worthy is within yourself—why gaze upward? The Venerable Lord is within yourself—why seek externally?" The *Sutra of Salvation* says: "What shines brightly in the void? It is called the Mud-Pill Immortal." This Mud-Pill Immortal is the Most High Heavenly Worthy—who else but the original spirit residing above one’s crown?

Some, failing to comprehend, mistakenly claim that they themselves are the Most High Heavenly Worthy, falling into delusion. In this inner refinement method, visualizing oneself as fire to burn away all impurities symbolizes the eradication of all evil thoughts. The body’s subsequent restoration to wholeness symbolizes the indestructibility of Heavenly truth.

Above the Mud-Pill is the Heavenly Palace; below the two kidneys is Hell. Between the eyebrows, three inches inward, lies the Mud-Pill—this is the brain. The brain is the root of essence; between the two kidneys is the Cinnabar Field. (See later explanations for details.) Some mistakenly place it three inches below the navel, while others point to a point behind the navel and before the kidneys, calling it the Cinnabar Field—this is incorrect, for below it lies the origin of the Conception Vessel.

The Scarlet Palace of Fire is the Heart Palace. Below the Mud-Pill is the River Source; the Twelve River Sources are the origins of the twelve meridians. The water of the Eastern Well and the Celestial River is the divine water, ascending to the Mud-Pill and descending to moisten the Five Phases. The true qi of the Five Phases’ mutual generation is the true qi of the five viscera’s mutual generation. The true fire is circulated in the heart; the true water, in the kidneys. All these transformations occur within the body. The wondrous Dao of creation is near at hand—seeking it afar is not the proper method.

Laozi said: "My fate lies within me, not in Heaven." The *Classic of the Hidden Talisman* states: "The cosmos is in your hands; the myriad transformations arise from your body." There is absolutely no creation outside the body. The Perfected of Empty Tranquility said: "The Dao is not far—it is within the body." These are essential words. The vast and empty spirit terrace encompasses the ten directions; with a single thought of purity, the myriad methods are perfected—all are the wondrous workings of the heart.

When the heart is focused, the realm appears; when the heart scatters, the realm vanishes. To worship the spirits as if they are present—this is the essence of offering and refinement.

Nowadays, people neglect inner refinement and merely engage in outward adornment—how mistaken! Reciting scriptures and performing rituals remain only on the lips, not in the heart. In seated meditation and silent practice, the work lies in the heart, not the mouth. Silent contemplation in the heart connects with the hidden and obscure, while vocal recitation merely creates a spectacle for the eyes. As it is said: silent contemplation should reside in the heart’s obscurity; thoughts must not emerge as sounds from the throat. Silent contemplation is the heart’s contemplation—moving intent without sound. If one can sit in a quiet chamber, eyes closed in stillness, for the duration of a watch or more, silently performing the work of practice, this is inner refinement. The longer one sits in stillness, the more wondrous and profound it becomes—far surpassing recitation and ritual, indeed by ten thousandfold.

In methods for praying for rain, clear skies, or snow, the crucial point lies entirely in the quality of seated practice. The practitioner does not chant incantations but works silently within the heart. The *Nine Heavens’ Chapter on Generating Spirit* instructs in its recitation method: "Calm the heart and contemplate silently." "Calm the heart" means to pacify the heart. The *Comprehensive Sutra on Salvation* speaks of "the heart’s central incantation" and "heart’s prostration." The *Yellow Court Classic* states: "All revolve the celestial scriptures within the heart"—not only for salvation or spirit generation. The *Yellow Court* and *Great Cavern* scriptures should be contemplated silently, all with a pacified heart, as heart-incantations and heart-prostrations. All revolve the celestial scriptures within the heart—this is the gradual entry into the discourse of the most subtle transformations.

All scriptures and incantations were reluctantly expounded in words by the Most High to guide people beyond the purport of language, transcending the myriad forms to perceive the Dao of emptiness and spontaneity. Yet those who cling to words remain benighted. The Most High, again reluctantly, transmitted the inner work of silent contemplation and practice within the original methods, which have since spread to the lower realm. Today, their transmission is entirely lost. Even those who receive it fail to uphold the precepts and maintain it steadfastly, instead blaming the method for lacking efficacy—this is a grave error.

When one revolves the celestial scriptures within the heart, every method becomes wondrous without exception. With prolonged practice, one may even perceive ghosts and spirits. Nowadays, people merely pursue vocal recitation for appearances, unaware that clamor in speech and hearing depletes spirit and qi, while stillness in thought nurtures essence and spirit. In such offerings and refinement, the benefits for self and others are vast indeed.

In former years, there was a mad Daoist who specialized in offering and refinement. Every month’s end, he would bring food and water to a crossroads or secluded place, set the meal upon the ground, and sit in silent meditation without uttering a word. He would remain for the duration of two watches before departing. Some doubted him; others mocked him. Later, someone secretly observed at night from a distance and saw many spirits partaking of the food, then vanishing. After a moment, they all transformed into infants, clad in ethereal immortal robes, ascending upon the Daoist’s head into the heavens—truly one who had mastered the method of silent seated refinement.

Today, people adorn themselves with vocal recitation for appearances, unwilling to learn from this Daoist and practice the inner work of silent seated refinement. Pitiable and laughable! Without cultivating seated practice and inner work, relying solely on chanting incantations and inscribing talismans, all becomes empty display.

In essence, refinement and salvation involve refining one’s own transformations to deliver wandering souls. If one cannot refine the spirit, how can one deliver ghosts? It depends entirely on the heart’s inner work. Talismans and incantations merely embody one’s own transformations. When the heart’s fire descends, the kidneys’ water ascends, and the true water in the mouth becomes full, sweet, fragrant, and delightful—this is the true water of the kidneys. Without the descent of fire and ascent of water in offering and refinement, all other transformations are secondary. The descent of fire and ascent of water are the essential principles of true refinement.

When Kan and Li unite and water and fire achieve harmony, all transformations ascend to the Mud Pill. Wandering souls receiving this transformation cannot but ascend to heaven. After bestowing the precious register, one revolves a single point of numinous light, transforming it into a fire-bell that pierces the Mud Pill. The wandering souls before one all ascend to heaven following this single thought—this is the crucial point of refining and delivering wandering souls. If one’s numinous light fails to pierce the Mud Pill, the souls have no means of ascending to heaven.

To deliver souls to heaven, one must thought by thought ascend one’s own transformations to the Mud Pill. With diligent practice, the crown of the head will subtly stir. If one remains free from desire and practices assiduously for several years, the fire-bell will naturally appear constantly, and the crown will eventually open wide—initially like myriad ants gathering, causing intense itching, then like a great stone splitting, opening fully. The *Heart Seal Scripture* states: "Silently audience with the Supreme Emperor, after twelve years, one ascends in flight." Not only do ghosts and spirits receive great benefit, but one’s own spirit and essence become vastly abundant—immortality may be hoped for.

This method shares the same principle as the method of silently audience with the Supreme Emperor, differing from other refinement and offering methods. In the method of silently audience with the Supreme Emperor, one first focuses attention on the lower elixir field. After a long while, water and fire unite, the Jade Pond’s water arises and fills the mouth, then is swallowed. Only then does one ascend this intent to the Mud Pill at the crown. If one gazes upward without revolving and swallowing the Jade Pond’s water, fire will blaze upward while the lower region remains empty.

In this method, one should keep both eyes level with the chest, lowered toward the navel, directing this intent behind the spine to ascend to the crown. Naturally, water and fire will circulate and revolve. With prolonged practice, spirit and essence will all ascend to the Mud Pill. Some quote Master Huan as saying: "Direct the heart’s gaze to the Mud Pill," but the old transmission’s wording was lost. Consequently, many people forcefully raise their eyes to gaze at the crown, either damaging their eyes or causing qi to congest in the head.

With my method of silently audience with the Supreme Emperor, silently audience with the Most High Heavenly Worthy is even swifter.

Each night at midnight and each morning at dawn, after practicing the internal refinement method, one should still visualize the Fire Bell piercing upward through the Mud Pill—this momentary ritual refinement yields even swifter results. While there are many methods for the interaction of water and fire, none surpass this foundational internal refinement technique, which aligns with the *Dongyang Internal Refinement* method published by Dai Jun in his *Pure Mist Ritual Refinement*. The only omission in his version is the marvel of generating water within the mouth.

The ritual refinement method published by Dong Jun Guangran, which involves visualizing the tortoise and snake for refinement and deliverance, is truly laughable. Though the tortoise and snake pertain to water and fire, what do they have to do with the Supreme Venerable of the Great One? The transmitted methods for refinement and deliverance through water and fire vary widely, and errors abound. In my method, one solely takes refuge in the Supreme Venerable of the Great One, Savior from Suffering, as the principal focus, without invoking other names—this ensures singular devotion. The marvel lies in refining water and fire to nurture the Infant, which then transforms into the Supreme Venerable of the Great One. For what emerges from one’s own transformation is none other than one’s original spirit, unlike the sudden visualization of the Supreme Venerable of the Great One.

The *Seven-Character Mantra of Sweet Dew* bestowed by the Supreme Venerable of the Great One appears in one version with the additional six characters "Shu Mu Gong and Xi Wang Mu." However, my method focuses solely on the Supreme Venerable of the Great One, without invoking others, for the Supreme Venerable of the Great One is also the sovereign of the Northern and Southern Poles and all refinement and deliverance deities. As Dai Jun said: "Visualize my true person as one, as three, as seven, as fourteen," aptly expressing the idea of emanation and transformation. Yet once the myriad tasks are complete, one need only focus on the singular. Know that the one is not solitary, nor are the myriad truly numerous—Dai Jun’s words are profoundly reasonable. In my method, I only invoke the Supreme Venerable of the Great One and do not recite the names of other lords; instead, it is best to silently chant the sacred name of the Supreme Venerable of the Great One, Savior from Suffering.

Other ritual refinement methods typically employ liturgical forms, merely engaging in superficial ornamentation. Years ago, I was deeply fond of ritual refinement and first received several manuals, all of which lacked internal practice, relying instead on external qi and visualizing external realms. Such errors, passed down in succession, have misled many. I deeply regret this and have often criticized it. Those who peddle methods for profit are to blame for the proliferation of divergent texts and techniques.

Ritual refinement should employ the *Precious Register*. Among the transmitted versions, one is called the *Precious Register for Ascending to Heaven*, another the *Imperial Pardon Precious Register*, and yet another uses the red-printed celestial script "Om Hum Trāḥ Hrīḥ" with a talisman below called the *Mysterious Numinous Talisman for Breaking Hell*. In the center, the characters for "Savior from Suffering, Heavenly Worthy, Sun, Moon, and Stars, Mysterious Divine Lords" are written in standard script, celestial script, or placed to the left of the talisman. Another version, called the *Great Precious Register*, combines various talismans into a single scroll. Some feature the four characters "Om Hum Trāḥ Hrīḥ" written plainly, also called the *Six Heavenly True Words*, while others scatter these four characters among the five agents (Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth), sometimes colored, sometimes not.

Another is called the *Precious Register of the Most High for Ascending to Heaven through Compassionate Forgiveness*, and yet another the *Jade Terrace Talisman for Gathering Transformations and Ascending to Heaven*, which omits the four characters "Om Hum Trāḥ Hrīḥ" and differs significantly in form. Many other *Precious Registers* exist beyond my knowledge, but all used for delivering the deceased belong to the *Lingbao* tradition. The *Lingbao Scripture of Salvation* and its *Lingbao Chapter on Generating the Spirit* focus specifically on matters of life and death. The *Precious Register* originates from the *Lingbao* tradition, which has many lineages, each transmitting distinct methods that later dispersed into various schools. Even within these schools, branches of *Precious Register* methods exist, each differing in form and often not featuring the four characters "Om Hum Trāḥ Hrīḥ", with vastly different applications.

Some claim that the four characters "Om Hum Trāḥ Hrīḥ" are also used in Thunder Rites and the Tianpeng method, and many other traditions employ them, typically for heart-centered operations. One lineage of the Ma Lingguan method uses the incantation "Om Hum Trāḥ Hrīḥ, divine spirits, swiftly gather," while another stacks the four characters to dispatch the divine officials. These four characters have several names, and all that include "Hum" pertain to the spirit of the heart. Know that "Om Hum Trāḥ Hrīḥ" are the inner taboo names of my heart’s spirit. During refinement and deliverance, my heart’s palace is likened to the Southern Office of Shang, hence it receives the title "Southern Office." After refining the form, the inner taboo names of the heart’s spirit serve as the secret language for the work of ascending to heaven.

Know further that the *Precious Register* gathers the divine light within my heart into a talisman. The spirit belongs to fire, and fire’s nature is to ascend—thus it can deliver one to heaven. When sending off a soul, visualize the ninefold divine fire-light within my heart, vast as a golden bell, surging upward to propel it into the Great Clarity. This is perfection. The brush used to inscribe the *Precious Register* should also be pointed and held upright, moistened rather than dry. When people observe the *Precious Register*, they see a red sphere on yellow paper. The deceased soul receiving it perceives a flaming orb, blazing upward in radiant splendor. The divine fire-light ascends into the void, leading the way, illuminating the eyes and heart, and enveloping the body in brilliance. Ghosts and spirits gaze up at it in awe, deeming it the supreme treasure—hence it is called the *Precious Register*. If one casually employs the *Precious Register*, the deceased soul perceives only darkness, rendering it useless—what benefit is there to spirits?

Some say the four characters "Om Hum Trāḥ Hrīḥ" are the inner taboo names of the Compassionate Venerable of the Great One, but this is incorrect. The Supreme Venerable of the Great One is the most wondrous Dao, coeval with the Primordial Beginning, without fixed form—how could it have inner taboo names? These arise only in response to karmic conditions and manifestations.

The term *Tai Shang* signifies that all methods, all talismanic scripts, originate from the *Tai Shang*. *Tai Shang* means "the Most Supreme," for nothing surpasses it—it is the wondrous workings of spontaneous creation and transformation. Thus, Daoists say: *Tai Shang*. In the present *Tai Shang* *Jie She Sheng Tian Bao Lu* (Precious Register for Pardon and Ascension to Heaven), some employ the Six Stars of the Southern Dipper but do not invoke *Om Hum Trāḥ Hrīḥ*, while others merely imprint the four characters *Om Hum Trāḥ Hrīḥ* beneath. Yet the *Precious Register* is formed precisely through the invocation of *Om Hum Trāḥ Hrīḥ*; to employ the Six Stars without invoking *Om Hum Trāḥ Hrīḥ* is incorrect.

Another method is called the *Tai Shang Sheng Tian Zhen Ming Bao Lu* (True Mandate Precious Register for Ascension to Heaven by the *Tai Shang*). It likewise employs the four characters *Om Hum Trāḥ Hrīḥ* but does not use the Six Stars of the Southern Dipper. Instead, a separate *Tai Shang* talismanic mandate is placed above. Many alternate versions omit the Southern Dipper entirely, focusing solely on *Om Hum Trāḥ Hrīḥ*. Regarding the Six Stars on the *Precious Register*, leaving them blank is preferable. Some inscribe them with separate incantations, others with the *Du Ren* (Deliverance of Humanity) mantras, and still others with two or three variations of scattered incantations for the Six Stars—these differences are stark, all being later accretions. One school insists on not inscribing the second □ star, while another only inscribes the character for "ghost" (*gui*) and omits the *Li Zhi Huo Tian Zun Sheng* (Venerable Victor of the Fire of Li Zhi).

Dai Jun’s method of ritual refinement states: "According to ancient texts and original methods, the *Huang Lu* (Yellow Register) ritual’s *Precious Register* bore no Six Stars. Though later transmitted versions retain them, one need not be rigidly bound—this view is entirely correct." I maintain that the *Precious Register* should primarily employ *Om Hum Trāḥ Hrīḥ* and need not invoke the Southern Dipper; the Six Stars should remain blank. When I inscribe the *Precious Register*, I do not fill in the Six Stars, and I would never mislead others. Yet most people, lacking sufficient faith, cling stubbornly to convention, believing that adding more enhances its efficacy—this merely scatters their focus.

If one insists on employing the method, one should first invoke the Six Stars, then *Om Hum Trāḥ Hrīḥ*, reciting only the names of the Southern Dipper Star Lords while inscribing the Six Stars, leaving the third star unfilled. Other versions invoke and inscribe *Om Hum Trāḥ Hrīḥ* with dozens of variations in incantations and visualization techniques. Here, I advocate simply reciting *Om Hum Trāḥ Hrīḥ* and inscribing *Om Hum Trāḥ Hrīḥ*—this is most fitting in principle.

The *Hum* character in *Om Hum Trāḥ Hrīḥ* is sometimes written as *yin* (吟), though it is originally *hum* (吽). Tradition holds that for guiding the deceased to heaven, the character for "ox mouth" (*hum*) is avoided, lest it obstruct the deceased’s progress, and is thus replaced with *ling* (昤). Though written as *yin*, it is pronounced as *hum* without doubt. One should adhere to the original method and regard *hum* as correct. In some versions, the *li* (哩) character is written as *li* (哩), substituted due to phonetic similarity; the *zha* (咤) character may appear as *da* (哒), but modern texts use only *Om Hum Trāḥ Hrīḥ*. Some employ a pre-made seal of *Om Hum Trāḥ Hrīḥ*, reciting the incantation while stamping—this is even more erroneous.

The *Precious Register* is customarily inscribed on yellow paper in cinnabar, with cinnabar being the finest. If cinnabar is unavailable, silver cinnabar or vermilion may be used, but black ink should never be employed. Red is chosen to correspond to the image of the *Zhu Ling Fire Mansion*. Moreover, when spirits see red talismanic scripts, they perceive them as fire.

When inscribing *Om*, the brush turns left; for *Hum*, it turns right; for *Trāḥ*, left; and for *Hrīḥ*, right. Left turns signify yang, right turns signify yin—symbolizing the yin within yang and the yang within yin. After inscribing the four characters in sequence, the brush is swept upward from below, so that all souls may follow this transformative power and ascend to heaven. This also conveys the meaning of divine *qi*, transcendence, resonance, and swiftness. Modern practitioners, when inscribing talismans and sealing characters, employ this upward brushstroke for the same purpose.

When inscribing the *Precious Register*, the four characters are traced with hand seals formed on the four joints of the middle finger, as the middle finger’s meridian connects to the heart and corresponds above to the *Ni Wan* (Mud Pill Palace). The intent behind inscribing the *Precious Register* is profound indeed. Other versions of the *Precious Register* write the four characters in a continuous stroke, sweeping a single brushstroke through the center, called the *Bamboo Leaf Precious Register*. Another writes the four characters in four separate strokes, sweeping brushstrokes from the four corners, called the *Four-Corner Precious Register*. Some employ the *Nine Phoenixes Breaking Impurity Rite*. Others sweep the brush in a single stroke through the Southern Dipper’s □ character. Some insist on inscribing the *Precious Register* at noon, when the sun is at its zenith, to capture the essence of true, blazing fire. Others choose the six yang hours, but focusing on externalities rather than internal refinement leads to loss.

Such variations in inscribing the *Precious Register* are innumerable and cannot all be recorded here. They are all inventions of recent teachers seeking distinction, privately boasting to impress later students, thereby misleading the netherworld—such transgressions are not minor. Some claim the *Precious Register* must be nine inches long and three inches wide, but this need not be rigidly observed. For instance, the *Tai Shang Tian Zhuan Bao Lu* (Celestial Seal Precious Register of the *Tai Shang*), *Precious Contracts*, and others should follow their original methods.

When inscribing the *Precious Register*, one should do so in a quiet chamber, free from disturbances, sitting in stillness for a time until the mind is clear and tranquil. Only then may one perform the internal refinement method and secretly petition the Compassionate Venerable. One should employ only a single *Precious Register* to ensure focused spiritual energy, so that the netherworld may be aided. Dawn, when the *qi* is clear and bright, is also an excellent time to inscribe the *Precious Register*. It should be inscribed on the same day to preserve the undispersed divine *qi*; delay causes dissipation.

For delivering a specific named deceased, a separate *Precious Register* is inscribed with the name filled in below. In grand *zhai* (fasting) and *jiao* (offering) rituals, the *Precious Register* is used twice: first to open the paths of the netherworld, then to proclaim pardon. Initially, the *Breaking Hell* method is employed to inscribe the *Precious Register*, notifying the underworld officials to release the imprisoned souls. The imprisoned souls then look up in reverence as the *Precious Register* is proclaimed as their pardon, and the inscription should include the four characters for "Underworld Officials in Charge."

The *Precious Register* also varies in many forms. Some are inscribed solely with the character for "exhortation," while others arrange the four characters *oṃ hūṃ trāḥ līḥ* in reverse, written vertically from top to bottom—these are all methods for *Breaking Hell* and should not be used for *Precious Registers* meant to ascend souls to heaven. As for the *Precious Register* for ascending souls to heaven, once the imprisoned souls have departed the netherworld and entered the realm of the Dao, they are no longer under the jurisdiction of the underworld officials. Moreover, after they have partaken in the sacrificial offerings, undergone refinement, and received the Three Refuges and Nine Precepts—all completed in full—the *Precious Register* is then proclaimed and bestowed upon the souls, who wield it to ascend to the heavenly realms. At this moment, they truly have no connection with the underworld officials. The *Pardon Register* is akin to an imperial edict releasing imprisoned souls, while the *Ascension Register* serves as the transformative force guiding souls to heaven. This is why the *Ascension Register* for ascending souls to heaven should not include the four characters for "Underworld Officials in Charge," nor employ the *Breaking Hell* method or techniques such as "heaven pressing down and earth lifting up," which are of the same category.

One explanation holds that the *Pardon Register* operates downward with increasing force, penetrating straight to the depths of hell to liberate souls from beneath the earth. The *Ascension Register*, by contrast, operates upward with growing power, piercing through to the highest heavens before lifting souls to behold the Most High. The two are fundamentally distinct, like the ascent and descent of water and fire.

In my *Breaking Hell* method, I enter deep meditation and silently direct my transformative power, personally invoking the Compassionate Venerable One to radiate hundreds of thousands of great beams of light, penetrating straight to the depths beneath the earthly wheel and transforming all hells into a realm of vast purity and luminosity. Thus, there is no need to redundantly employ the *Pardon Register*.

Now, in the rites of sacrifice and refinement, the purpose is precisely to deliver and liberate souls—how could one then speak of their rebirth according to their karmic rank? This *Precious Register* states at its outset, "Promote in rank and receive rebirth." Having already conferred the Three Refuges and Nine Precepts and opened their celestial nature, how could one fail to elevate them according to their merit? The *Precious Register* is a great act of heavenly grace—how could there be no principle of compassionate consideration? To still speak of "rebirth according to rank" would be to deny them the profound blessing and close the door to their renewal. Moreover, the Most Compassionate Venerable One delivers all without exception—thus, the notion of promoting in rank is most excellent.

The *Precious Register* is sealed with three talismanic seals, or sometimes with the Jade Seal of the Dao Lord. For official documents and memorials, the seal of the Southern Prosperity Refinement Bureau is used; for those not yet memorialized, the Three Treasures Seal is employed. When carving talismanic seals, peach, catalpa, or thunder-struck wood is never used, as these carry the *qi* of killing.

The three talismanic seals are collectively called the *Deliverance of Souls Seal*. To the right is the *Talisman for Delivering Imprisoned Souls*, in the center the *Mandate of the Nine Dragons*, and to the left the *Talisman for Breaking Hell*. Later generations of perfected masters combined these three talismans into a single seal, hence it lacks outer borders. The modern *Three Talismans Seal* includes official titles, though it is not the seal of Dai Jun.

There is also a method involving incantations, consecrated water, and talismanic seals—this explanation is particularly misguided. Some claim that one *Register* can only deliver one named soul, a notion that is utterly absurd. As for those who embellish their arguments with far-fetched references and convoluted interpretations, citing the erroneous tradition that the Immortal Lord only delivered eighty thousand souls—how narrow-minded! Today, when people broadly establish Yellow Register *zhai* rituals, the number of petitions received often reaches tens of thousands, and the number of ownerless souls delivered is beyond counting. How much more so for the Immortal Lord? It is truly unknown how many tens of millions of souls among the eighty thousand were actually delivered. Yet some cling to the idea that one *Register* delivers one soul, perpetuating this as established doctrine. Thus, those who inscribe *Precious Registers* boast of quantity as merit, becoming careless and failing to apply focused power. Who understands that utmost sincerity, sitting in profound stillness for a long time, and then inscribing a single *Register* with concentrated power is far superior to inscribing a hundred or ten? In great matters, one encompasses ten thousand; in small matters, ten thousand converge into one. When released, it fills the six directions; when gathered, it does not exceed a handful—all lies in the transformation of the mind, not in the number of *Registers*. A single thought of compassion brings boundless mysterious grace; the key lies in how one directs the mind.

Someone asked: "When establishing a Yellow Register *zhai*, if one does not accept many petitions to universally deliver the named deceased, the merit and virtue will not be vast. Though each soul has its own *Register* and document, only the *Precious Register* of the *zhai* sponsor is inscribed by the high priest with focused power. The remaining *Registers* are all inscribed by scribes, and all memorialized and proclaimed *Registers* are those of scribes—how could they possess the transformative power of the Dao?"

I replied: "The deliverance of tens of thousands of souls is entirely the work of the high priest’s *Precious Register*. For one encompasses ten thousand, and this is truly the vastness of the high priest’s mind. The scribes’ *Registers* merely fill in names to complete the count, like an imperial amnesty—there is only one edict, not one for each person. The power of the *Precious Register* lies not in quantity but in focused singularity."

Bai Yuchan also said: "A single document or *Register* can deliver boundless souls, just as a true dragon needs only a drop of water to become a torrential rain—what need is there for more?" Some texts specify the number of souls to be delivered based on the petition’s rank, or set limits on the number to be delivered, or issue certificates of authorization—I reject all such practices. Those who are meant to be delivered will be delivered of their own accord; they do not wait for deliverance, for they are already liberated. Today, those we deliver should be the most difficult souls to liberate. If one’s intention is set, the benefit received in the unseen realm is profound. I pity the boundless suffering of sentient beings and wish to deliver them all in the snap of a finger. How can one bear to limit their deliverance? If their arrival is endless, to delay would be to miss the moment—would this not disappoint heaven and earth? Even a single being is a part of the Dao—how much more so for all imprisoned souls? The vastness of the mind knows no bounds, flowing with the great Dao through the infinite and unobstructed heavens. How could one narrow one’s wisdom and restrict one’s capacity, thereby diminishing oneself? If one can master oneself and return to propriety, the world will return to benevolence."

One must shatter the barriers to see with the vision of the great—if even a single soul remains in the corner, untouched by grace, then my benevolence is incomplete. How then could one speak of the sagely virtue of the perfected? Some say that Master Xian did not employ the Precious Registers or the Danyang Talismans, and this is indeed so. Yet for those whose strength falls short, let it be; who would deny the possibility for those whose virtue and Dao transcend the common? This method fundamentally takes the mind, entering into the empty mystery, where the great transformation works its wonders—its primary purpose being deliverance. Beyond the Precious Registers and Danyang Talismans, no other talismans or scripts are used.

The original Danyang Talisman may be burned or left unburned, but now it is burned and cast into the bathing pool to benefit the spirits of the unseen realm. If the Danyang Talisman is not burned but instead cast into water, then sprinkled and affixed to the back of the Precious Register before burning, this is entirely incorrect. The Danyang Talisman is for bathing, while the Precious Register is for ascending to heaven—these are two distinct purposes.

The Danyang Talisman is formed from a single qi, originally without dispersed forms. All talismanic scripts derive from it, and in ancient times, there were no myriad shapes—all arose from the one qi, hence called the "Primal Beginning Talismanic Mandate." Master Dong’s Danyang Talisman consists of thirteen scattered segments of incantations, first gathered into one talisman, then immersed in water, after which yellow wax is melted to seal its surface—no one understands its meaning. Some versions add the celestial scripts of the Five Agents (Fire, Earth, Wood, Metal, Water) upon it. Others divide it into five segments, each with its own incantation and mantra, infused with the qi of the Five Agents, then assembled into one talisman. Still others employ the sun and moon, the Ten Celestial Stems, and the Twelve Earthly Branches—twenty-four segments of incantations in total—to inscribe the Danyang Talisman. Such gratuitous embellishments abound in other methods, failing to grasp Laozi’s principle of "reducing and reducing again." The wondrous transmission of these methods has led many to believe that adding a single stroke, word, incantation, qi, mantra, or visualization makes them marvelous, while omitting any of these is seen as a deficiency. These methods, altered by countless hands over time, have resulted in the rituals of refinement, the Danyang Talismans, and the Precious Registers varying from text to text. In the Qingwei tradition, the Precious Registers and Danyang Talismans contain no operative incantations—their talismans are of a distinct celestial script.

The Danyang Talisman now in use follows the corrected version from the Daoist Canon as established by earlier masters. Originally named the "Yellow Qi Yang Essence Cavernous Luminous Talisman," it should properly be activated through the yellow qi and yang essence. Today, its true meaning is often lost. The "yellow qi" refers to the Central Palace, while the "yang essence" is the vital force of generation. It is drawn from the point of transformation between the two kidneys and ascends into the Central Palace—hence the name "yellow qi yang essence." When heart-fire descends and kidney-water ascends, their union occurs in the Central Palace, known as the Yellow Court—not the spleen. Thus, one presses the middle crease of the middle finger.

Though the yellow qi and yang essence share the same principle as the water-refinement process, their applications differ. When inscribing the Danyang Talisman, one should use yellow ink on blue paper—yellow representing the Central Palace, blue representing the vital force of generation, truly embodying the image of the yellow qi and yang essence. During the bathing ritual, the qi of Earth must be present, for Earth gives birth to the myriad things. Wood, Metal, Water, and Fire all depend upon Earth. Without the spleen and stomach, the human pulse cannot thrive.

Where ghosts and spirits find their foothold depends upon the power of intention and visualization. Intention and visualization are Earth. If my intention and visualization do not establish the presence of ghosts and spirits, the realm will collapse. The "Earth" invoked here is not external soil, but the true Earth—namely, the pure Earth of the Yellow Court’s intention. Thus, the Danyang method speaks of drawing upon the yellow *qi*. Some practitioners gather the purified soils of the five directions and place them in the bathing pool, seeking the generative *qi* within Earth, mirroring the principle of the yellow *qi* and yang essence as an external representation. Others focus solely on gathering soil from the East—these methods are not adopted here.

One school combines the purple *qi* from the kidneys with the yellow *qi* from the heart, merging them into a single *qi*, but this is not the yellow *qi* and yang essence. Some equate the yellow *qi* and yang essence with the refinement of Water and Fire—this is incorrect. Others apply it to the activation of precious registers—this, too, is mistaken. The Danyang Talisman may be inscribed in white powder or cinnabar, but only yellow ink is orthodox.

Though the celestial script of the Danyang Talisman includes characters like "Yang Brightness" and the "Five Phases," the true *qi* of the Five Phases’ mutual generation should be applied to the talisman. The three talismanic commands of the Danyang Talisman, as transmitted today, differ from ancient texts, having lost the original intent of the Most High’s first bestowal. Yet, not daring to abandon them, we follow the old tradition still in use, preserving the precedent.

Some speak of refining the form, purging the form, and completing the form—of the heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys—of breaking hells and blood lakes, of summoning and beckoning, all through various talismanic rituals and full ritual registers, numbering over a hundred. Yet now, only the Danyang Talisman is employed. Is this not too simplistic? Know this: talismans embody the workings of creation. When a talisman is wondrously crafted as a divine general, ghosts perceive it as a true divine general. When it is wondrously crafted as a mountain, ghosts perceive it as a true mountain. All forms and celestial scripts function thus, akin to the burning of paper clothing, paper wealth, and paper vessels for the dead. Only ghosts, lacking radiant vision, see illusory images shaped by the talisman’s intent.

The Most High’s transformative teachings originally aimed at resonance with creation—what is called a talisman is the grasp of creation, and what is called a register is the mastery of creation. Later generations, however, reduced talismans and registers to mere talismans, treating registers as external affairs. How far is this from sitting in profound stillness, within the boundless emptiness of the mysterious, where creation unfolds in the most secret place, and ghosts and spirits are moved by the utmost sincerity in the celestial realm? Radiant light shines forth, cleansing away the filth of sins, and through the emptiness of this singular personal awareness, ghosts and spirits receive true benefit—something beyond the knowledge or perception of ordinary people.

As for the five viscera and six bowels, no talismans are used. When I circulate the true *qi* of the Five Phases’ mutual generation, the five viscera are whole in form, and the *po* souls are also whole. The Five Phases are the wondrous workings of Heaven and Earth, and likewise the wondrous workings of the individual body. Thus, no reliance on talismanic scripts is needed.

Today, many conduct rituals at crossings of water and land, claiming these are the paths where ghosts and spirits travel. Yet if these are places where people come and go, even in the dead of night, how can one avoid disturbances? Any disruption scatters the multitude of souls, and they can no longer receive sustenance. When sitting in stillness, one should do so in a quiet chamber, visualizing the multitude of souls ascending from the Ghost Gate in the northeast. In deep stillness, external people are cut off, and the multitude of souls are undisturbed.

By conventional methods, the northeast is the Ghost Gate, located at one’s left shoulder, behind the back—the path by which ghosts come. If not from the northeast, ghosts cannot approach. The northeast corresponds to *yin*, the Tiger, the Ghost Gate—perhaps a subtle allusion to the divine tiger.

The Yellow Register Retreat rites include the saying that on *wu* days, the Heavenly Gate does not open. There are also times when the Heavenly Gate opens on specific days of the ten celestial stems. When submitting memorials or petitions, one must prostrate toward the northwest. Yet when entering profound concentration to perform my rituals, Heaven above and Heaven below merge into one realm, utterly without separation. All hells radiate light, transforming every place into the naturally pure Daoist realm. There is no time that is not an audience with the Most High, no place that is not where the spirits of the dark receive offerings and refinement. Universally, this becomes the vastest and most boundless Dharma realm—is this not wondrous? This is the teaching of great penetration and great enlightenment. Thus, there is no need to discuss the northeast Ghost Gate or the inapplicability of *wu* days when the Heavenly Gate does not open. For those who have not deeply entered profound concentration, the dark souls still ascend from the northeast Ghost Gate.

All prisons fall under the jurisdiction of the Great Emperor of Fengdu. When Fengdu is emptied, every suffering realm is liberated. Some ask about the Blood Lake—it belongs to the Mingling Prefecture of Fengdu, containing two prisons: one called the Gorge Stone Prison, the other the Blood Lake Prison. Within the body, one visualizes the area below the two kidneys as Fengdu, while above the neck lies the Heavenly Palace. The higher one ascends, the greater the merit and power; the higher the Heavenly Palace, the deeper the hells below the kidneys, the heavier the karmic burden, and the more profound the suffering.

When the Most High Heavenly Worthy radiates great light, a single incantation and candle illuminate the Blood Lake, instantly transforming it into a lotus pond. Each detail is vividly seen: the female souls emerge, joyfully raising their fists to attend the ritual refinement. Every dark soul in every prison is likewise liberated. The deepest and most agonizing hells are the hardest to save—without the power of the Dao to extricate them from profound suffering, they cannot come forth.

When visualizing the place where the multitude of souls receive offerings, there are no streets, houses, pits, or mounds—only an infinite, luminous, pristine, and vast world.

If streets, houses, or the like appear, they are all manifestations of evil karma. When making offerings to ghosts and spirits, calling their names allows them to come; without summoning their names, they cannot appear. For those deceased with surnames, silently invoke them. The rituals of the world for refining and delivering the dead—those who gather human spirits—are neither thorough nor exhaustive, and the prescribed methods vary. Some may enter the Dao of heavenly immortals, others the demonic path, but all belong to the six destinies, which are incorrect.

The *Lingbao Sutra* states: "Those who wish to transform the five destinies." The new commentary cites the *Scripture of Lord Lao*, which describes the five destinies: first, the spirit path; second, the human path; third, the beast path; fourth, the hungry ghost path; and fifth, the *Nili* path. *Nili* refers to hell. Thus, in the Daoist netherworld, there are the Five Destiny Generals. While Buddhism speaks of six destinies, Daoism speaks of five.

In this universal invitation text, one should first invite the Most High Divine Spirits to condescend in their compassion and bestow blessings upon the refining ritual. Next, summon the ghosts and spirits of the five destinies to swiftly attain liberation and universally receive the refining offerings. Though the heavenly path is not included, one must still invite the heavenly path to witness the refining ritual. Every detail must be meticulously and precisely attended to. If one merely follows conventional methods and issues a general summons, that may suffice.

When beings die, it is not from illness but from execution or injury. Thus, their yin souls are twisted, crippled, emaciated, festering with blood, and their forms incomplete. Without the true *qi* of the five phases generating one another, how can their spirits be revived? When souls and spirits partake of my offerings and undergo my refinement, they receive this true *qi* of the five phases generating one another, and their forms and appearances become fully restored at once.

Yet the *qi* of the five phases manifests in many ways. In some texts, a spell using red apricots is employed, though it uses sounds like *xu* and *hu*, it merely refers to "the *qi* of the five phases." The method lacks order—some follow a sequence of one, two, three, four, five to apply the five phases, but this neither adheres to the principle of mutual conquest nor the logic of mutual generation. It should not be called "the true *qi* of the five phases generating one another."

For instance, the phrases "the Azure Emperor protects the soul," "the White Emperor attends the spirit," "the Red Emperor nurtures *qi*," "the Black Emperor circulates blood," and "the Yellow Emperor governs the center" employ the principle of conquest. Yet the true marvel lies in the reversal of the five phases to revolve and transform creation. Those who grasp this principle can achieve the elixir and attain the Dao. However, ghosts and spirits inherently fear the destructive *qi* of harm and slaughter, which contradicts the intent of generation.

The true *qi* of the five phases generating one another begins with metal and ends with earth. This follows the meaning of "Heaven One generates water" and "Qian is heaven, Qian is metal." Thus, it begins with metal, followed by water—metal generates water, water generates wood, wood generates fire, fire generates earth, and with earth, the *qi* of the five phases generating one another is complete. Earth then generates metal, forming an endless cycle. All things originate from earth and return to earth, hence it concludes with earth.

*Zhuangzi* said: "Human life is the gathering of *qi*; when gathered, there is life; when dispersed, there is death." Thus, it is said that the world is united by a single *qi*. Medical texts express the same idea. From this, we know that the generation of all things relies on *qi* as the master of the body. Though the sounds *xi*, *chui*, *xu*, *he*, and *hu* each correspond to different viscera, all five are *qi*. The diaphragm governs the *qi* of my entire body. Beginning with *xi* to generate their spirit, *chui* to generate their essence, *xu* to generate their soul, *he* to generate their spirit, and *hu* to generate their intent—this is the method for completing their forms in sequence.

Though ghosts and spirits are named after the heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys, they possess no actual heart, liver, spleen, lungs, or bones. To restore their forms, one must rely on the *qi* of my heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys to generate their spirit, essence, soul, spirit, and intent. Ghosts and spirits are transformations of spirit, essence, soul, spirit, and intent—how could they truly possess a heart, liver, spleen, lungs, or kidneys to be generated?

In recent refining rituals, following the meaning of the eastern direction, they begin with the *xu* breath, though this is not entirely logical. In grand refining rituals, one begins with the kidneys, and the sequence differs from this. In the Qingwei method, the *qi* of the five phases does not use sounds like *xi* or *chui*; instead, it employs *□* for the liver, *□* for the heart, *ni* for the lungs, *□* for the spleen, *ti* for the kidneys, *li sha* for harmonious integration, and *he kou chi* for the teeth. Some say that when using the *hu* sound, it corresponds to the central palace of earth, and one should retreat three steps before employing the *hu* sound—this is unnecessarily elaborate. The commentary explains *hu* as exhalation and *xi* as inhalation, so *hu* is the emission of *qi*; inhaling while uttering *hu* is incorrect. Others use the character *si* to raise *xi* *qi*, *xi* to raise *chui* *qi*, *xu* to raise *xu* *qi*, *he* to raise *he* *qi*, and *hu* to raise *hu* *qi*.

Many methods employ the character *□*, which most severely depletes one’s essence and *qi*. When uttering this *□* character, the deepest *qi* of both kidneys is drawn out. Those who seek to nourish life must be aware of this.

When yin souls receive the true *qi* of the five phases generating one another, their lives are prolonged and their forms restored. Receiving the Elixir Yang Talisman purges filth and purifies their substance. Though their forms are complete and their substance purified, they remain mere souls with complete forms and pure substance, utterly devoid of the radiance of spirit, *qi*, and essence.

To what can this be compared? Before the refining of water and fire, yin souls are like the moon on a dark night—possessing a spirit but obscured by haze. After the refining of water and fire, yin souls become like the moon on a full-moon evening—transforming the spirit’s haze into luminous companions. Water refining nourishes with richness to generate essence; fire refining illuminates to generate spirit. Without richness, there is no essence; without illumination, there is no spirit or *qi*. Without the radiance of spirit, *qi*, and essence, one cannot ascend to heaven. Without nurturing essence to generate spirit, there is no true refining and deliverance.

Someone may ask about the meaning of "water and fire refining." In the various Lingbao methods of today, there are indeed water and fire refining techniques, and their explanations vary, yet none delve deeply into profound mysteries. Those who privately practice refining often fail to elucidate its principles.

I say: The "water" in water refining is not water—it is the luster of my essence. By refining my essence, I generate the essence of the other, thus transforming it into water and refining it thereby. The "fire" in fire refining is not fire—it is the radiance of my spirit. By refining my spirit, I generate the spirit of the other, thus transforming it into fire and refining it thereby.

When essence is lost and spirit departs, one, though once fallen into ghosthood, may yet ascend and be reborn. When essence is generated and spirit is complete, one shall rise to be born in heaven. Refining enables deliverance; without refining, there is no deliverance. Hence, it is called "water and fire refining."

Some fail to comprehend that water and fire are but external names for essence and spirit. Those who mistakenly imagine water as a watery pool or fire as a fiery marsh are truly deluded. If one employs external symbols—setting up external water and fire—it does no harm.

Someone may further ask about the function of water and fire. I say: Water pertains to yin, and by applying my essence to the moon, its color becomes white—though it is not truly the moon. Fire pertains to yang, and by applying my spirit to the sun, its color becomes red—though it is not truly the sun.

Though the water and fire refining methods of various schools differ, they all revolve around these two elements, drawing their meaning from their function. Yet, they abandon the root to chase the branch, growing ever more degenerate. My method of water refining first achieves the union of water and fire, then employs true water for the refining. My method of fire refining likewise first achieves the union of water and fire, then employs true fire for the refining. Is this not superior to other refining techniques?

Bathing and water refining are distinct in meaning: bathing cleanses the body, while water refining generates essence. Many today cannot distinguish between them. Before partaking in offerings, due to karmic impurities, one washes to purify the substance—without bathing, it cannot be made clean for the feast. After eating, having sated the heart, one refines to nurture essence—without partaking, it cannot be moistened to cultivate essence.

Only when essence is complete can spirit be complete, and thus fire refining follows. As "Heaven One generates water," water refining comes first; as "Earth Two generates fire," fire refining follows. Some practice fire refining before water refining, but this contradicts principle.

The place of fire refining is the Southern Palace of Shangchang, where souls are received for deliverance. After passing through the fire cauldron, all souls are transformed into infants, richly moistened and radiant, their spirit, *qi*, and essence fully manifest. Their forms are renewed, and they are reborn as immortals, lustrous as jade, bright as the moon—no longer the dim, filthy souls they once were. Only after receiving precepts and bestowing registers do they ascend to heaven. The workings of this transformation are subtle and wondrous, beyond full description. With a heart of utmost sincerity, practicing the inner method in all actions, one naturally attains resonance—no need for my words to know it.

In grand sacrificial refining, some employ the use of blood, but this is a later corruption. Blood most readily weighs one down; all beings with blood cannot ascend to heaven. Thus, no immortal with blood ascends—it is not a leaking body but a pure one, not a body of bone and blood but one of spirit and *qi*. Even in sacrificial refining that does not generate bones, the intent is the same.

To refine first and then sacrifice is a grave error. Sacrifice precedes refining, hence it is called "sacrificial refining." Sacrifice involves offering food and drink; refining nurtures essence and spirit. Sacrifice is easy; refining is difficult.

In current water and fire refining methods, some use *zi* and *wu* (midnight and noon) refining; others employ two secret characters or two Sanskrit mantras; some write the character for "refining" literally or abstractly for water and fire refining; others visualize the Northern and Southern Dippers, recite their names, or trace their constellations; some use the *he*, *chui*, *ti*, *zi*, and *wu* methods; others recite the "Middle Chapter" or the "Eight Heavens of the South and Eight Heavens of the North" for water and fire refining; some use two talismans of "Flinging Fire Ten Thousand Miles" and the "Twelve River Sources," or recite these two passages; others invoke the Water and Fire Generals, or perform the "Three Turns of the Left Camp"; some recite the "Water-Refining Youth" and "Fire-Refining Youth," or the "Water-Refining General" and "Fire-Refining General"; others invoke the "Fire-Refining Dharma Realm Heavenly Worthy" and the "Yellow Flower Purifying Form Heavenly Worthy"; some summon two messengers by name; others combine water and fire refining with recitations of the "Dragon Han Vast Exorcism"; some recite the names of the Sun Lord and Moon Sovereign, or the incantations of the Sun’s soul and Moon’s spirit; some employ talismans to draw true water and true fire; there are nine-fold refinings, which also vary in form. Some practice nine water refinings and nine fire refinings; others alternate water and fire refinings nine times each, totaling eighteen refinings. Some even use the essence of the external sun and the radiance of the external moon for water and fire refining—this is especially erroneous.

Many methods involve summoning and feasting, after which they merely file documents for the souls to proceed to the Southern Palace of Shangchang and request refining. Others claim that on the third, fourth, fifth, thirteenth, fourteenth, fifteenth, twenty-third, twenty-fourth, and twenty-fifth days of each month—nine days in total—the Southern Palace of Shangchang opens its refining bureau. Yet people fail to grasp that the great handle of heaven and earth’s creation lies within one’s own heaven, not in the heaven above. Without venerating one’s own Heavenly Worthy, without refining one’s own Southern Palace, merely filing documents for refining without performing the true practice, souls will never attain deliverance.

The *Red Writ of the Ancient Cavern Scripture* states: "The greatness of heaven and earth is what I uphold; the multitude of the ten thousand things is what I sustain." Those who comprehend should ponder deeply upon these words.

The Elixir Yang talisman is solely for the purpose of ablution, or sometimes employed in water refinement, for the true Yellow Flower Water is precisely the agent of water refinement. Some use it exclusively for ablution, while others conflate ablution with water refinement as one and the same—all fail to investigate its source. Ablution (*mu*) means washing the head; bathing (*yu*) means washing the body. Yet it is not merely external, cleansing form and purifying substance, but most crucially internal, washing the heart and scouring the mind, lest it be reduced to mere ablution.

The binding of the Well and the binding of the Flower follow the natural monthly cycle of the heavens. The Eastern Well and Yellow Flower are the ablution of heaven and humanity, yet mortals must not practice thus—they must divide it into two distinct functions to accord with principle, though the substance remains water. When ablution is required, it serves for ablution, which is the method of washing away sin and filth. When water refinement is required, it serves for water refinement, which is the method of nurturing essence and spirit.

The Elixir Yang incantation contains many errors. This incantation originally derives from the *Scripture of the Nine Perfected*, and while it appears in various scriptures, each version differs. This edition is the corrected version, and in profound quiescence, one need not recite the Dragon Han incantation.

All methods of sacrificial refinement rely on the Yellow Flower, yet some hastily speak of ascending the Eastern Well’s pool, while others simply visualize the waters of the Celestial River—both fail to investigate the source. Others focus solely on visualizing the Eastern Well star in the southwest, but the Southern Dipper discussed here refers to the six stars of the Southern Dipper, whose form resembles a dipper. Among the twenty-eight constellations, it is the Dipper of Wood and the *Xie* (the sixth lunar mansion), and all historical astronomical records name it the Southern Dipper. Its appearance is identical to the Northern Dipper, as is the Southern Dipper lamp image used in the world. Now located in the *chou* position, why is it called the Southern Dipper? By the earthly plate, it lies in the north; by the celestial plate, it lies in the south. Thus, it is called the Southern Dipper, named for its southern position, though in truth it governs the virtue of fire.

The *Scripture of the Southern Dipper* states: "Among the thirty-six lodges of the constellations, there are six stars of the Dipper Lodge, called the Southern Dipper, which is the Dipper of Wood and the *Xie*—there is no other Southern Dipper." The six aspects of the Southern Dipper are fully expounded in the *Scripture of the Southern Dipper*, and since the Southern Dipper governs longevity, it is thus employed.

One school of refinement focuses solely on the Southern Dipper, but the present method centers on the Supreme Heavenly Worthy. The Eastern Well consists of eight stars, resembling a well. By the earthly plate, it lies in the south; by the celestial plate, it lies in the north. Some say it is called the Eastern Well because its stellar formation faces east, and as a well names the star, it truly governs the virtue of water. The *Astronomical Records of the Jin* state that the Well governs the affairs of the Water Balance and that when the moon lodges in the Well, wind and rain arise—this aligns with the lunar passage through the Eastern Well and the presence of Yellow Flower Water.

The Southern Dipper and the Eastern Well stand directly opposite each other in the celestial configuration. The *chou* position is the Gate of Heaven, truly governed by fire, where the Southern Dipper resides. The *wei* position is the Pivot of Earth, truly governed by water, where the Eastern Well resides. The Southern Dipper and Eastern Well administer water and fire between the Celestial Pass and the Earthly Pivot, and the Qian trigram’s image surely draws from this.

It is said that the binding of the Well is the source of the river, that the Great Yin is water, and that the moon need not be the moon itself. When the moon’s path encircles the Eastern Well, it irrigates the Yellow Flower Water, washing the countenance of heaven and humanity, irrigating the spirit, and moistening the body. Thus, its transformative power is employed for water refinement—not by drawing water from the Eastern Well, but when the moon passes through the Eastern Well, the two essences of the river’s source and the water mother interact with the Celestial River’s origin, stirring forth the yellow-hued water flower. The eight stars of the Eastern Well align precisely with the Celestial River’s source, hence the Eastern Well is called the River Source. Externally, it models the image of heaven and earth; internally, it operates the mechanism of creation. Vast as heaven and earth or small as a single body, their images are one. Therefore, in the internal practice of water refinement, one must employ the moon, yet few do so today—this truly lacks principle.

Some mistakenly regard gallbladder *qi* as the Eastern Well’s Yellow Flower. The moon passes through the Eastern Well twelve times in a year, hence the twelve River Sources. The *Daoist Canon* contains the *Scripture of the Yellow Flower*, the *Scripture of the Three and Five in Sequence*, the *Central Scripture of Laozi*, and the *Scripture of the Cavern Mystery and True Unity*, among others, all of which repeatedly discuss the Eastern Well and Yellow Flower, though their accounts differ slightly.

The times for the twelve River Sources are as follows: the tenth day of the first month at the *ren ding* hour, the eighth day of the second month at dusk, the sixth day of the third month at sunset, the fourth day of the fourth month at the *xia bu* hour, the first day of the fifth month at the *shang bu* hour and the twenty-ninth day at the *ri die* hour, the twenty-seventh day of the sixth month at noon, the twenty-fifth day of the seventh month at the *si* hour, the twenty-third day of the eighth month at sunrise, the twentieth day of the ninth month at the *ji ming* hour, the eighteenth day of the tenth month at the *chou* hour, the fifteenth day of the eleventh month past midnight, and the thirteenth day of the twelfth month at midnight. These are the times when the heavenly beings of the upper heavens undergo monthly ablution, their countenances radiating luminous brilliance. These dates differ slightly from the modern calendar’s lunar passage through the Well.

The *Hymn to the Eastern Well* states: "The Primal Beginning delivers from eternal night; the heavenly beings are born month by month." Some use these twelve days to draw Yellow Flower Water for practice; others count from the *yin* position aligned with the lunar station to the *hai* position for Eastern Well practice; still others add the monthly general to the *chou* hour and count to the *wei* position for Eastern Well practice—these are all external matters.

The twelve River Sources correspond to the twelve origins of the channels within the body. The *Classic of Difficulties* states in the eighth and sixty-sixth difficulties: "The moving *qi* between the kidneys below the navel is the root of the twelve channels." Yang’s commentary says: "The moving *qi* between the kidneys below the navel is the Cinnabar Field, located three inches below the navel, four inches square, and attached to the spine."

Feng’s commentary states: "The Cinnabar Field takes form in life but loses substance in death." It further cites the *Divine Radiance Inner Classic* from the *Daoist Canon*: "The Cinnabar Field is red above and black below, blue on the left and white on the right, with yellow at its center, rotating within a four-inch square. In women, it is black above and red below, white on the left and blue on the right, with yellow at its center, also rotating within a four-inch square—here the primordial *qi* is inhaled and exhaled, circulating through the hundred vessels." The *Yellow Court Classic* commentary, citing the *Jade Calendar Classic*, states: "The Cinnabar Field lies three inches below the navel, attached to the spine, blue on the left and white on the right, red above and black below, four inches square." The *Lingbao Methods*, *Lingbao Complete Methods*, and Wang Shuhe’s *Pulse Classic* commentary all describe it similarly. This aligns precisely with the *Acupuncture Classic* and *Moxibustion Classic*, where the point three inches below the navel is called *Guanyuan* (Pass of Origin). Other Daoist texts describe the Cinnabar Field differently, and one must examine this deeply.

In Buddhist terminology, the Sanskrit *udāna* corresponds to the Cinnabar Field. What is now called "the luminous point between the two kidneys" is the source of this character (□). On exhalation, *qi* issues from the Cinnabar Field; on inhalation, *qi* enters it. All my *qi*, all essence, all strength, all vessels, all sinews, all voice, all will, all wisdom—all emerge from this. Thus, the twelve channel-vessels all arise from the Cinnabar Field, dispersing to the four limbs and the hundred bones.

The *Plain Questions*, *Classic of Difficulties*, and main texts of the *Acupuncture and Moxibustion Classics* contain no mention of the term "Cinnabar Field." This term originates from Daoist scriptures, where it is called the "Cinnabar Field" because it is the field that gives birth to the golden elixir of transformation. The true essence inherited from one’s parents is deeply stored here. Within the body, the Winter Solstice also arises from this deepest, most profound place—hence it is called the "source." The Cinnabar Field and the Conception and Governing Vessels form an inner-outer pair, rising directly to connect with the heart and the root of the brain. If the heart stirs even slightly, the true essence here has already fled. When the heart remains unmoved, essence does not depart; when essence is full and spirit settled, this place becomes supremely luminous and hot.

The character *yuan* (origin) shares the same meaning as *yuan* (source). Considering the body in relation to the cosmological transformations of Heaven and Earth, the region below the two kidneys is the Fengdu Palace, while the space between them is the source of the twelve channel-vessels. If we focus solely on the head to discuss celestial transformations, there is a point above the neck where the Great Emperor of Fengdu resides—this is the northernmost extremity of the head, near the boundary of the neck. Thus, the Twelve River Sources lie below the Mud-Pill Palace of the brain, like the Milky Way flowing across the heavens.

*Concluding the Middle Scroll of* **Essentials of the Supreme Ultimate’s Internal Rituals of Refinement**
*Beginning the Lower Scroll of* **Essentials of the Supreme Ultimate’s Internal Rituals of Refinement**

The venerable Elder Zheng Suonan of the Three Externals compiled this:

Someone asked about the method of transforming food. He replied: The method of transforming food lies entirely in the vastness of one’s resolve. One must first attain clarity and concentration of spirit, with aspirations as boundless as compassion. Only then can one grasp its subtlety. Next, one must rely on utmost sincerity, entering stillness and visualization of the vast. What one visualizes is where the spirit abides.

Where my spirit dwells, there my qi dwells. Where my qi dwells, the form I visualize also dwells—extending upward to the void of space and downward to the deepest depths. This most expansive and great offering of *hushi* (transformed food) is all a transmutation of spirit and qi.

The *Scripture of the Five Kitchens* states: "All foods are congealed qi. Without prolonged stillness, the congealed qi cannot return to the original qi. As one takes in, so one must release." It also says: "Do not force the mind to think, nor seek to be thoughtless, yet no longer engage in thought." This is how the method is upheld—how wondrous the meaning, how profound the principle!

The Five Kitchens teach one to refine the qi of the Five Phases into great harmony, gathering it into a "kitchen" to offer as sacrifice to the ghosts and spirits. The *Scripture of the Five Kitchens*, expounded by the Most High, is a scripture on the transformation of food and the workings of creation, most subtle and marvelous. Is it not the guiding principle of sacrificial refinement and food transformation?

Moreover, when ghosts and spirits partake of my offerings, they are drinking the sweet dew of my great harmony. If my creative power does not return to its root, how can there be sweet dew of great harmony? Sweet dew is the true creative power of my pure celestial nature. When body and mind are pure, creative power ascends to the crown and naturally flows downward—this is sweet dew. If body and mind are impure and the Five Phases do not intermingle in refinement, even if one briefly turns the light inward and kidney-water ascends, it is not the true fragrance flowing from the Flowery Pond.

As in the world, though rain and dew are common, they are not sweet dew.

Sweet dew does not descend in times of worldly great peace—this auspicious sign cannot be summoned, marking its profound distinction from ordinary rain and dew. Discoursing to this point, its marvel defies easy expression.

In sacrificial refinement, water’s function predominates. All things live by water as their life, followed by fire, then earth. In cultivation, earth takes precedence, followed by fire, then water. Guan Yinzi states: "Water, fire, and earth are none other than essence, spirit, and intent." Truly uniting these three as one—this is how longevity attains its enduring nature. Those who seek mastery in sacrificial refinement must likewise unite these three as one.

Nowadays, food transformation employs the *Yuluoluo* [□] incantation, or the *Samaya Samaya* mantra, with various other transformation spells. For instance, the Qingwei Yuyang sacrificial refinement incantation reads: *Oṃ* [□□] *ai* [□] *tali* [□] *hūṃ*. Current methods rely solely on the *Middle Chapter of the Numinous Scripture*, where food transformation pervades the ten directions of empty space. One should visualize the transformed food as supporting heaven above and earth below, suffusing the entire Dharma Realm. The *Middle Chapter of the Numinous Scripture* contains the secret language of the thirty-two heavens; reciting it causes the food to naturally spread throughout the four quarters, four intermediates, and beneath the thirty-two heavens. Alternatively, invoking the sacred name of the Great One, Savior from Suffering Heavenly Worthy, also suffices for transformation. Some use a small banner pole, inscribing the six characters of *Sudāmadāvi* Heavenly Worthy, allowing lost souls to taste sweet savor—these methods are now briefly summarized.

Someone asked: What is the meaning of the Great One Heavenly Worthy?
I replied: The *Record of Rites: Evolution of Rites* states: "Rites originate from the Great One, transforming into yin and yang, revolving into the four seasons." The *Family Sayings of Confucius* says: "The Great One is primordial qi, the source of creation." The *Records of the Grand Historian: Treatise on the Celestial Offices* states: "The central palace’s Pole Star, its brightest one, is the Great One, ever abiding. As the northern pole’s central star remains unmoving, it serves as the lord of all stars." Zhuangzi says: "Governing with the Great One is the highest principle." The *Inner Contemplation Sutra* states: "The Great One Sovereign Lord resides in the head as the Mud Pill Palace, governing all spirits." The *Yellow Court Scripture* says: "The Great One’s flowing pearl rests in Kunlun, signifying the return of creation to its origin." The *Scripture of Salvation* states: "The Great One oversees destiny." The *Chapter on Generating the Spirit* says: "The Great One holds the talisman." The *Sutra of the Heavenly Youth’s Precepts* states: "The Great One seizes me." All these refer to spirits, not the Heavenly Worthy. As Liu Xiang says: "The essence of the Great One is also a spirit." The *Chu Ci* calls the Eastern August Great One a fortune deity. The *Huainanzi* states: "The Supreme Subtlety is the court of the Great One; the Purple Palace is the Great One’s dwelling"—both refer to stellar lords. Numerology has the number of the Great One, for numbers begin with one, and one originates from the Great One. Thus, the Great One’s numerological spirit governs the five fortunes and ten spirits. The Great One Star Lord is the Great One worshipped in the Han dynasty. Thunder has the Great One Thunder, which is the lunar comet. Water’s residual qi belongs to a spirit named the Great One. Across sutras, methods, and texts, the term "Great One" appears extensively—there is no time to discuss them all. Only the Great One Heavenly Worthy and the two characters "Great One" are especially subtle.

"Heaven" means ultimate; "One" means non-duality. If one awakens to the principle of ultimate non-duality and abides in this ultimate, non-dual heaven, then essence, spirit, soul, and vitality all gather without scattering. Free from all extremes—neither empty nor form—utterly still, perfectly real, one returns to the original, celestial truth of the self. This "One" is not the numeral one but the heaven of one’s original nature. By unifying the myriad deluded minds of scattered souls, it manifests in response to thoughts as the Great One Heavenly Worthy.

Human life is such: the ear chases sound, the eye chases form, and in thought after thought, the original celestial unity is divided by ten thousand affairs. Thus, sentient beings die and become souls lost in eternal night. Awakening to the myriad transformations, one returns to the original celestial unity. Therefore, the Great One Heavenly Worthy saves lost souls from suffering—this is why the *Sutra of Salvation from Suffering* says: "I originally dwelt in the Great Void’s empty cavern."

Laozi said: "Heaven attains the One and becomes clear; earth attains the One and becomes tranquil; spirits attain the One and become numinous." Zhuangzi said: "You attain the One, and all affairs are complete." If lost souls, suffering and benighted, attain the One, how could they not be delivered and reborn?

Someone asked: Does the Dao give birth to the One, and is the Great One Heavenly Worthy not akin to a numerical concept?
I replied: To gather the myriad into the One is not to fixate on the One but to return one’s heaven to the state before the Supreme Polarity showed its signs—formless, nameless, neither same nor different. Thus, the Great One arrives, and the Dao is obliterated. How much more so for numbers? The true nature of responsive transformation reluctantly assumes the name of Heavenly Worthy. The aforementioned Mud Pill Palace is also a concession to the deluded minds of the masses, manifesting in response to their thoughts—this is the teaching of the Most High.

The *Wondrous Scripture of the Great One’s Salvation from Suffering, Protection of the Body, and Preservation of Life* states: In the Eastern Land of Eternal Joy, there is a Great Compassionate One, the Great One Savior from Suffering Heavenly Worthy, whose incarnations are as numerous as the sands of the Ganges, responding to beings’ cries. Lord Lao petitioned the Primordial Beginning, saying: "This sage’s awe-inspiring virtue transforms and saves lives—from whence does it arise? Through kalpas of cultivation, may it respond to conditions and expound for all." The Heavenly Worthy replied: "In heaven, this sage is called the Great One Fortune Spirit; in the world, the Great Compassionate One; in hell, the Sovereign Lord of the Abyssal Cavern. You are my qi; I am your root. You know me, and I know you—this is the essence of the nine yangs, the very incarnation of the Primordial Beginning."

The Primordial Beginning and Lord Lao likewise honor this sage with such reverence and esteem for this teaching.

The station of the Great One is titled: Within the Azure Florescence, Ever-Joyful Realm, at the Easternmost Marvelous and Solemn Palace, amidst the Seven-Jewel Fragrant Canopy Grove, upon the Nine-Hued Lotus Throne, encircled by ten thousand perfected beings, bathed in the radiance of a hundred million auspicious lights, the Jade Purity Numinous Treasure Honored One, responsive and transformative, the Primordial Beginning of the Profound Kalpa, who bestows compassion upon the great thousand worlds, the Sweet Dew Gate, the responsive and transformative colored-body, the purple-golden auspicious manifestation, the Great Sage, the Great Compassionate One, the Great Merciful One, the Great Vow-fulfiller, the Sound-Answering, Karma-Responding Great One Savior from Suffering Heavenly Worthy—along with the four characters "Azure Empyrean Supreme Emperor," are all expedient designations, provisional names established out of necessity to convey their sublime excellence.

Yet all people and all things inherently possess this singular unity. If one thought returns to this unity, then beings in the ten directions are all delivered. Thus it is said: At that time, the Savior from Suffering Heavenly Worthy pervaded the ten-directional realms.

However, the Great One Heavenly Worthy does not truly reside in the East. The East is where the generative *qi* of Heaven and Earth arises; it is spoken of as the East to manifest a realm of transformation, thereby universally bestowing the grace of life.

The Great One Heavenly Worthy is the Dao itself, and thus is difficult to illustrate through analogy.

Someone asked: Is it *Taiyi* or *Taiyi* (with the character 乙)?

It was said: No texts originally used the character 乙. Later generations, fearing that *yi* (一) might be confused with the numeral, replaced it with 乙. Little did they realize that the meaning of 乙 differs greatly from that of 一. The correct form should be *Taiyi*.

Among the various refinement and deliverance scriptures and methods in the *Daoist Canon*, some are presided over by the Primordial Beginning Heavenly Worthy. However, the Great One Heavenly Worthy serves as the sovereign who delivers and uplifts the denizens of the netherworld.

The Primordial Beginning initiated creation with the singular *qi*, giving rise to the root of the myriad things. The Great One guides the myriad things to gather and return creation to the source of the singular *qi*. The Primordial Beginning Heavenly Worthy inaugurates the beginning, while the Great One Heavenly Worthy returns to the end. Though their names differ, their principle is one.

In comparison with the Jade Emperor: the Great One Heavenly Worthy independently enacts the transformation of compassion, while the Jade Emperor wields both the powers of life and death. The subtlety of the Great One Heavenly Worthy surpasses that of the Jade Emperor, though his authority is subordinate to the Jade Emperor’s—this is where they differ.

Someone asked: What is meant by *Taiji* refinement and deliverance?

It was said: *Taiji* refinement and deliverance originally derives from the Numinous Treasure methods. Due to its simplicity, it originates from the lineage of the *Taiji* Master Ge Xuan, and thus is called *Taiji* ritual refinement. This is akin to *Numinous Treasure* refinement and deliverance or *Nanchang* refinement and deliverance, each named according to its origin.

The *Numinous Treasure* refinement has nine stages, while the *Nanchang* refinement uses five-colored paper inscribed with talismans—both are more elaborate than this method. Master Zheng Zhong also has many lineages, which cannot be enumerated in detail.

Some also say that *Taiji* refinement and deliverance means that all people and things possess a singular *Taiji*. Each and every departed soul likewise possesses a singular *Taiji*. Descending from the root to the branches, they fall into the realm of netherworld spirits. Returning to the origin and fulfilling the end, they should be restored to their original celestial nature—this is the principle of their deliverance to celestial rebirth. Thus, it is called *Taiji* refinement and deliverance.

Others say that Master Ge Xuan, by means of this original *Taiji* principle, delivered the spirits of the departed. The Celestial Emperor, approving of his virtue, elevated his title and conferred upon him the office of *Taiji* Left Palace Immortal Duke, hence the name *Taiji* Left Immortal Duke—this is another explanation of refinement and deliverance.

Still others claim that the two characters *Taiji* possess a certain efficacy, but such an interpretation is erroneous.

Someone asked about the meanings of the Southern Culmen, Nanchang, Southern Dipper, and Northern Dipper.

It was said: The Southern Culmen is the sovereign of Heaven who grants people immortality, the divine lord of longevity, and the emperor of fire refinement. The Southern Palace refers to the upper palace of Nanchang, the celestial realm presiding over fire, where the souls of the dead are refined into immortals. The Southern Dipper is the stellar configuration in Heaven that governs the souls of the living and the dead, inscribing their names in the register of longevity.

The various lords of the Southern Culmen are the deities within one’s own *niwan* palace and below. The upper palace of Nanchang, also called the Vermilion Numinous Fire Prefecture, is one’s own *jiangong* (cinnabar field). The Southern Dipper guards the celestial chart in a fixed position, while the Northern Dipper revolves around the central Heaven along the earthly chart. The Northern Dipper pertains to water and arises in the North, hence its name. The fourth star of the Northern Dipper’s handle aligns directly with the Southern Dipper. The *Records of the Grand Historian: Treatise on the Celestial Offices* refers to it as the "balance of the Southern Dipper." The *Book of Documents* associates it with the meaning of "equilibrium in mid-spring."

The Northern Dipper is subordinate to the Northern Culmen and the Purple Tenuity Enclosure, while the Southern Dipper is subordinate to the Southern Culmen and the Supreme Subtlety Enclosure. The two Culmens are the sovereigns of the two Dippers. The upper palace of Nanchang is also one of the bureaus within the Southern Culmen. The Southern Culmen, Southern Dipper, and Nanchang are not the same place, though all are ultimately subordinate to the Southern Culmen.

Someone asked: Bai Yuchan once expressed doubt as to whether refinement and deliverance are two separate matters.

It was answered: The *Scripture of Deliverance* states: "The living body receives deliverance" is one matter, and "the dead soul receives refinement" is another. Now, examining the *Register of the Vermilion Numinous Immortal Deliverance of Life*, it mentions the Nanchang Palace, which oversees two bureaus: the upper bureau and the lower bureau. The upper bureau governs the affairs of refinement, while the lower bureau governs the affairs of deliverance. The living body resides in the lower realm, thus it is governed by the lower bureau. The dead soul ascends to Heaven, thus it is governed by the upper bureau. Together, they are called the Vermilion Numinous Fire Prefecture, also known as the Nanchang Refinement Bureau. Its seal is inscribed with a one-cun-three-fen square of human-world stacked seal script. Bai Yuchan’s interpretation is quite apt.

All measurements used by Daoists employ the celestial jade ruler, which takes the length from the middle joint of the middle finger—left for men, right for women—as one cun.

Someone asked about the theory of receiving life at Mount Tai.

It was said: The *Scripture of Deliverance*, the *Chapter on the Generation of the Spirit*, and other scriptures speak of refinement and rebirth, as well as deliverance to the Southern Palace, but ancient texts never mention sending souls to Mount Tai to receive life. Moreover, those who have attained the marvel of water and fire refinement and received the Three Refuges and Nine Precepts should logically be reborn in Heaven. How could they be sent to Mount Tai to be reborn according to rank? This would truly contradict the original intent of the Most High’s eternal deliverance from the three paths, five sufferings, and eight difficulties, enabling transcendence of the three realms and carefree wandering in the Upper Clarity.

Nanchang belongs to the Celestial Bureau, while Mount Tai is an office of the Earthly Administration—having already entered the Celestial Bureau, how could one descend again to the Earthly Office? Now, one should set the mind on the loftiest aim: to deliver souls to rebirth in Heaven is supreme, and one ought not deliver them to Mount Tai to receive life. After the ritual of refinement, the Fire Bell blazes radiantly like the sun, ascending directly to the *Niwan* and piercing through the crown of the head, with all souls following the light of the Fire Bell upward—this is the method of delivering them to rebirth in Heaven. How could it not surpass sending them to Mount Tai?

The *Precious Registers* have always stated: the *Precious Register for Rebirth in Heaven* contains not a single mention of Mount Tai. If the *Precious Register* delivers souls to rebirth in Heaven, yet their spirits are sent to Mount Tai, would this not be a glaring contradiction? For instance, the *Precious Register* of Master Dong includes "descending to the Earthly Prison to receive life." Examining these words, how do they reverse the meaning of "rebirth in Heaven"?

Some argue that among the shades of the dead, many bear heavy karmic burdens—how could all be allowed rebirth in Heaven? I say: having opened the gate of the Most High’s deliverance, one should embody the Most High’s compassionate heart. One must do all within one’s sincerity to deliver them to rebirth in Heaven. Even if this is not fully achieved, they may still receive grace and have their sins reduced.

Someone asked: There is a sword incantation for drawing boundaries to protect oneself, fearing that ghostly *qi* might interfere. Is it necessary to take such strict precautions? I say: It is like extending kindness to a criminal, who, moved by gratitude, would have no thought of offending you. Draw them near, and they are consoled; keep them at a distance, and they grow anxious—this is the longing of the shades in the netherworld for deliverance. Summon them with utmost sincerity, comfort them with compassion, nourish their souls with the *qi* of the Five Phases, and refine their spirits with water and fire—would they still dare to offend you? Such doubts arise only from one’s own lack of spiritual completeness. If one is not reverent, how could one avoid fault?

Others suggest using the *Three Lights Incantation* to dispel ghostly *qi*—their foolishness is beyond measure.

Someone asked: What of visualizing the Divine Officers and Generals encircling the altar before performing the refinement ritual? I say: This is merely superfluous.

Someone asked: What is the meaning of the infant riding the lotus flower? The *Scripture of the Yellow Court* states: "The palace of the heart’s domain is the lotus chamber, the heart of the radiant person." The form of the infant is the spirit; the lotus is the heart. In life, with a physical body, the spirit resides in the heart as its dwelling. When a departed soul receives deliverance, the infant rides the lotus upward. The opening verse of the scripture says: "Neither born nor destroyed, desiring birth through the lotus flower"—this is its true meaning. Some visualize the shades riding a fire dragon upward, but this is not as fitting as the lotus.

Some say it is best to burn many copies of the *Scripture of Deliverance*, the *Chapter on the Generation of the Spirit*, and the *Middle Section*, along with spirit money and spirit garments. Now, these are all omitted. If one wishes to burn them to liberate the lingering shades, that is a matter of personal preference.

Someone asked: Why burn the *Precious Register* first? I say: If one is engaged in silent meditation, it is proper to burn it first. In ordinary ritual refinement, it should be burned afterward.

Someone asked: What is the principle of resolving grievances and untying karmic knots? I say: To harbor thoughts and give rise to intentions is to create evil karma, which leads to the retribution of enmity. To extinguish the mind and forget all things is to return to the root of the Dao. Universally receiving the profound grace of liberation, if I cling, so too does the other; if I forget, so too does the other. When neither side is attached to things, they naturally return to nothingness—thus, heavenly grievances and karmic knots dissolve without need for resolution.

Someone asked: There are methods involving the Celestial Bureau of Medicine to cure illnesses and dispel impurities, the Bureau of Supervision to oversee rebirth, and the dispatch of generals to summon and escort the shades to rebirth in Heaven—what of these? I say: Not understanding one’s own true creative power, one claims one’s ritual strength is weak and must rely on the deities of Heaven—this is the height of narrow-mindedness. Little does one realize: when the *qi* of my Five Viscera and Five Phases mutually generate, the other is healed without need for celestial intervention. When my mind is pure, the other is purified without need for ritual cleansing. When my thought is liberated, the other is reborn without need for supervision. My mind is vast, free of demonic thoughts—why must I rely on generals to summon, protect, and escort them? It depends entirely on the practitioner’s power and insight.

In grand rituals, elaborate formalities abound, but these are merely external displays to manifest inner truths. If creative power truly resided in Heaven, Heaven would deliver them without need for these methods in the mortal realm. Why wait for the living to perform refinement rituals before the shades of the dead can be delivered? This is how humans stand between Heaven and Earth, accomplishing what neither can achieve alone. "The greatness of Heaven and Earth is what I uphold; the multitude of the ten thousand things is what I sustain." Reflect deeply on these sixteen characters.

Someone asked: How did the method of refinement and deliverance originate in the *Lingbao* tradition? *Lingbao* is the ancestor of all methods. Those who annotate the *Scripture of Deliverance* and explain the term *Lingbao* have not done so adequately. *Ling* is nature; *bao* is life. If *ling* is not *bao*, it cannot attain the limitless longevity of life. If *bao* is not *ling*, it cannot awaken the original nature. Separately, they are called nature and life; together, they are called *Lingbao*. All sentient beings are inseparable from nature and life—without *Lingbao*, one cannot deliver others, nor can one generate the spirit. Thus, the *Lingbao* method is the ancestor of all methods.

Now, the so-called *Lingbao* method, with its principles of divine radiance and great concentration, still relies on visualization and has not yet reached the root. Many *Lingbao* masters follow established doctrines, but if one can cultivate life and awaken nature, then deliver the shades of the dead, it is especially extraordinary.

Someone asked: What of reciting the *Chapter on the Generation of the Spirit*? The *Chapter on the Generation of the Spirit* deeply benefits the deceased, but if recited aloud, it is futile. One should recite only the nine chapters, not the preface. One must follow the original preface, which states: "Abstain from worldly affairs, sever all distractions, and with a mind as still as the exhausted drip, silently recite—only then can one generate the spirit of the deceased."

Someone asked: What is *taojue*?
It was answered: *Jue* refers to the apertures. The *Yellow Court Classic* states: "You are the gatekeeper of human prosperity and decline," meaning the hands can grasp the transformations of the entire body. Pressing *zi* invigorates the spirit of Kidney Water, pressing *wu* invigorates the spirit of Heart Fire—each has its explanation, yet they cannot be fully explored. Nowadays, when visualizing the Most High Heavenly Worthy, many press the *mao* seal, claiming *mao* belongs to the East and thus to the Most High Heavenly Worthy. This is utterly mistaken. The *mao* seal corresponds to the Liver, how could it represent the Most High Heavenly Worthy?

In my rites of refinement, I focus solely on the realm of profound stillness, opening my own celestial gate of supreme tranquility. With my true transformations, I transform those in the unenlightened darkness of the netherworld. All else is trivial and insubstantial. Offering a single meal suffices, for my true self, with utmost sincerity and wholehearted devotion, pours forth before the shades of the dead as an offering. Like a great sage or noble gentleman facing his sovereign or father, every word and phrase uttered is an outpouring of liver and gall, the utmost loyalty and filial piety, with no trace of shame or remorse—only then is it truly achieved.

If one wishes to posthumously honor masters and elders, one should secretly petition the Merciful Worthy to universally deliver the shades of the dead, dedicating this merit to enhance their netherworld blessings. For masters to confer registers and precepts is, in principle, improper. If doubts arise, they should be resolved through reason, and one should adhere to correct practice.

During the refinement rites, prepare a quiet chamber with a clean table. Place a small bowl of rice, a small bowl of water, and another bowl of water as a bathing pool. Burn the *Danyang* talisman and cast it into the water. Light a stick of incense before an external image, using the incense burner as fire and the water bowl as water. First burn the precious register; beyond this, nothing else is needed. Do not use lamps or candles. Sit in stillness for the duration of one watch, then proceed with the practice. It is purely through my concentrated spirit that I refine the shades of the dead. Not only do the spirits receive deliverance, but my own spirit also becomes clear and refreshed.

Generally, methods should be simple and direct to be easily practiced; the mind should be single-minded to facilitate resonance. In the state of concentration, the realms of heaven above and the netherworld below merge into one, with nothing left unpenetrated. As the *Yellow Court Classic* says: "The Jade Maiden of the Yellow Court reveals her feelings to you." If you can sit deeply within the exploration of the spirit-light concentration, when you ascend to pay homage to the Most High Merciful Worthy, whatever remains unattained, the divine spirits will surely inform you.

Those devoted to the Dao should practice this in lifelong secrecy, and indeed, carry it out for all eternity. During the refinement rites, impatience and haste are most forbidden. Performing the practice perfunctorily as a mere formality scatters one’s spirit and leaves the ghosts merely glimpsing the food without swallowing it. They depart burdened by their unfulfilled desires, resentful and sorrowful—how then could they ascend to heaven? Thus, when ghosts are partaking in the refinement and sustenance, one must proceed with gentleness and compassion, soothing and consoling the shades until they are fully sated. This takes time.

One must not regard oneself as a living person and the spirits as beings of the ghostly realm, creating distinctions and harboring attachments of self and other. If such divisions arise, the spirits will not receive benefit—this must be guarded against. In still sitting, the ears and eyes become clear, body and mind forgotten, spirit and qi refreshed, inner and outer emptied. Merging into profound concentration, one becomes utterly serene and unified. First, one perfects one’s own celestial gate of the Great One, then delivers the shades of the dead, restoring each to their own celestial gate of the Great One. This is the meaning of unity—its subtlety cannot be grasped without stillness. Laozi said: "Returning to the root is called stillness; this is known as restoring life." In quiescence, spirit and qi become cool and clear, the spirit-light bright and luminous. Drawing the shades into this realm of radiance, no place remains unilluminated, and what sins cannot be dissolved?

Agitation, however, muddles spirit and qi, dims the spirit-light, and plunges both oneself and the shades into the stagnant depths of darkness. If my spirit is not clear, what benefit is there for the ghosts? The *Daoist Canon* states: "When practicing refinement, one must bathe and purify, wear clean garments, rinse the mouth and cleanse the abdomen, ensuring inner and outer purity—no lingering flavors in the mouth, no residual meat in the stomach, no filth in the eyes, no dust on the body. Be indifferent and empty, with the Dao as one’s body." These are the earnest and essential teachings of the Daoist tradition. Without such preparation, one cannot comprehend the true nature of refinement rites.

The *Scripture of the Northern Dipper* says: "The Great Mystery’s One preserves its true form." Without utmost stillness and single-mindedness, how can one preserve it? The joy of stillness is ineffably profound, pervading the ten directions with serene purity, empty, subtle, and wondrous, merging with the Dao. Even in profound mystery, one must not follow any dharma, any realm, any thought, or stray outward. Always keep the mind secretly nestled within itself—this is the subtlety of the *Lingbao* method’s spirit-light concentration.

When shades enter this state to partake in the offering and refinement, how is it different from ordinary rites? Externally, one prepares rice and water, meticulously arranges images; internally, one focuses the mind and subtly directs the spirit. Inner and outer unite, the living and the dead share a single sincerity—only then is it truly achieved. No stray thoughts should intrude. If one thinks of an object, that object manifests in the netherworld. Every hair’s breadth follows the mind’s transformations—this must be carefully guarded.

All practitioners of these methods rely on visualization to summon spirits, perceiving only the forms imagined in their own minds, not the physical bodies present in the world. All realms arise from one’s thoughts. Thus, practitioners employ methods of transforming spirit and dispatching divine generals, and visualization must be singularly focused. If the visualization is slightly off, or thoughts waver, or one acts hastily and carelessly, the shades will not receive their sustenance.

If one awakens without forcing intention, nor seeks the absence of thought, yet no longer thinks of the method—holding fast to this twenty-character wonder—then even visualization is forgotten. How could stray thoughts arise?

Without tranquil sitting to refine the spirit, one cannot speak of this. Within the incantations of sacrificial refinement, the spirit mushroom has no root, yet it is the source of all transformations. A single thought ascends to the Great Clarity; silently reciting, one contemplates the Great Void. Meeting and returning, there is no duality—union and separation follow the heart’s will.

Such phrases are most wondrous, and the *Five Kitchens Sutra* in its entirety is even more so. They must not be treated as empty words to be recited and passed over. All the scriptures and incantations of the Most High speak of the most wondrous transformations within the human body. Yet today, people merely recite them as words—what a pity.

What is gained in tranquil sitting aligns with the teachings of the *Scripture on Ascending to Heaven and Attaining the Dao*. As for silent recitation? One must immerse the heart in the profound stillness of heaven—like a clam drinking moonlight, like a cicada sipping dew, like a snake entering hibernation, like a dragon nurturing its pearl, like a turtle concealing its breath, like a hen brooding her eggs, like a silkworm turning its cocoon, like a bee murmuring over its young—continuous and dense, thought yet without thought, the heart unmoving, all meridians returning to their source.

Naturally, fire descends and water rises, qi settles and spirit clears. The cosmos radiates light, the empty chamber generates brightness. Above, it pierces the celestial realms; below, it shatters the hells. Vast and boundless, luminous without end—diligent and unceasing, enduring without fail. The realms of ghosts and spirits become clearly visible and distinctly audible. One sees their sustenance received and their joy in refinement and rebirth—all vividly present before one’s eyes and heart. This is the method of penetrating the netherworld.

When the heart is settled, one connects with the netherworld; when the spirit is whole, one aids the dead. At first, one may glimpse only faintly, but in time, nothing remains unseen. The affairs of the netherworld can all be inquired into—only one must not lightly reveal heavenly secrets, lest one incur celestial punishment.

This method truly arises from tranquil sitting. If one’s realm of stillness is not yet pure, the sacred image of the Most High Heavenly Worthy that appears in concentration will be small and indistinct, faint and unreal, shifting and unstable. The realm of sacrificial refinement that manifests will also be narrow and impure, the offerings meager and insipid, and the netherworld’s needs unfulfilled—thus, the aid given is shallow.

If one’s realm of stillness is pure, the sacred image of the Most High Heavenly Worthy that appears in concentration will be towering and vast, increasingly radiant and luminous, increasingly majestic and compassionate. The realm of sacrificial refinement that manifests will also be expansive and pristine, the offerings fragrant and pure, and the netherworld’s needs fully met—thus, the aid given is profound.

With one part stillness, there is one part efficacy; with two parts stillness, two parts efficacy. Three, four, up to ten parts—all follow this principle. Yet this is only to secretly test the depth of one’s inner Dao-power. One must not cling to this idea.

If, in concentration, one vividly witnesses the marvelous realms of sacrificial refinement, one must not cling to joy. When the rite concludes, all must dissolve into nothingness—only then does it accord with the principle of pure emptiness. This is what Master Guan Yin meant when he said: "Like two eyes that see all things under heaven, if they turn their light inward for a moment, all is unseen." If one awakens to this principle, what in concentration could one cling to with joy?

Though people in the ritual arena follow the method correctly, they never witness the affairs of the netherworld and thus cannot trust themselves. They inevitably ask: "Who knows if the ghosts and spirits come or not?" But in the practice of sitting refinement, one personally beholds the realms of ghosts and spirits, sees their liberation, their joy in receiving offerings and undergoing refinement—this leaves no room for doubt.

If one fails to awaken to the principle that "it cannot be seen, heard, or grasped," one will instead fixate on the imagined realms of ghosts and spirits—this is not true deliverance. Doubt, irreverence, attachment, or elation—all are grave obstacles, leading one into heterodox or demonic paths. Be reverent, be reverent.

For beginners in tranquil sitting, the heart is often unsettled, and scattered thoughts arise all at once. One must not hastily seek stillness, for rushing only prevents it. Instead, one should relax and allow stillness to come naturally—like muddy water that clears on its own if left undisturbed, but resists settling if forced.

Thus, the *Scripture on Concentration and Contemplation* warns against binding the heart too tightly. If the heart is unsettled, or evil or distracting realms appear, one should turn the mind inward and dissolve all intentions, silently reciting the sacred name of the Most High Savior from Suffering Heavenly Worthy—naturally, stillness will come. Alternatively, one may practice the method of silently paying homage to the Celestial Emperor.

During the sacrificial refinement, myriad forms arise vividly—one must not be negligent. After the rite concludes, all transformations fall silent—one must not cling to them. Alas, the myriad transformations arise from the heart.

At the very moment of sacrificial refinement, the realms of the netherworld exist solely within the turning of a single thought. With but a single true heart, one returns to the utmost mystery and sincerity—even iron and stone open. How could ghosts and spirits not receive benefit?

The *Scripture on Deliverance* says: "Those who attain the Dao do so through the heart, which does not depend on others." This is a most wondrous saying.

When the heart is true, all things are wondrous; when the heart is false, all things decay. When the heart is upright, the realm is upright; when the heart changes, the realm changes. This resonance is like a shadow following form.

When my fire descends and water rises, all boundless spirits in the netherworld also experience fire descending and water rising, refining their spirits through transformation. When I uphold one precept, all boundless spirits in the netherworld also uphold one precept, and their good hearts manifest. If I am loyal, they are loyal; if I am filial, they are filial. If I do not kill, they do not kill. The Four Precepts, Five Precepts, up to the Nine Precepts—all follow this principle.

The *Nine Netherworlds Sutra* states: Those who uphold the Nine Wondrous True Precepts tread upon blades and walk through swords, yet these transform into lotus flowers. Their names are inscribed in the Golden Register, their ranks recorded in the Jade Clarity. How great are the precepts! Ghosts and spirits gain sustenance, undergo refinement by water and fire, and attain liberation—yet those who do not receive the precepts are like pagodas lacking finials, forever incomplete. Without receiving the precepts, they shall never ascend or be reborn.

By refining my water and fire, I generate life from their stagnation; through my virtue and conduct, I awaken their delusion. If my water and fire do not rise and descend, the dead remain without the qi of rebirth. If my observance of the precepts is imperfect, then among the netherworld’s spirits, not one has a master to receive the precepts. The realm of the netherworld has no fixed form—it is but the transformation of my heart into its environment, and the bodies of the spirits have no true shape to follow. My thoughts manifest as their forms; when my heart is vast, the dharma-food pervades the empty space of the universe. When my heart is pure, the spirits transform into bodies of purity. When I silently ascend to the Mud-Pill Palace, countless millions of souls follow me to be born in heaven. When I fully awaken to the Great Dao, countless millions of souls attain fruition through me. My single heart is the master of the ten thousand transformations of heaven and earth; my single body is the master of the refinement and liberation of netherworld spirits. Ghosts and spirits regard me as their model—how can this be taken lightly?

For the hungry, food is strength; for the poor, wealth is strength. In worldly affairs, merit is strength. Yet in the heavens above and below, across thousands of lives and ten thousand kalpas, in the unseen depths, virtue and conduct are strength. When ghosts and spirits of the two realms witness one of increasing virtue, their radiance grows ever more majestic, their forms ever larger. Should one emit a single good thought, that person becomes like an immortal, like a perfected being, like the sun, like the moon. When they see one utterly devoid of virtue, their light dims, their forms shrink. Should one harbor a single evil thought, that person becomes like a tiger, like a serpent, like dust, like earth—unseen by humans, yet visible to ghosts and spirits. Though the outer form in life may not yet have changed, the heart within has already transformed—how can one not tremble?

To seek to deliver sentient beings without cultivating virtue is like attempting to drag a thousand *jun* of stone with the strength of a single hair. It is like the blind describing the five colors or the deaf explaining the five tones—ultimately, it is all delusion. It is like a pauper vowing to bestow a thousand pieces of gold upon others, yet possessing none. If one cannot even save oneself from hunger and cold, how can one grant others wealth and nobility? Those who perform refinement rites without virtue are of this kind.

The Three Teachings all take the realization of the Dao as their foundation and virtue as their priority. Daoism, out of necessity, transmits methods as well. With full virtue, a single part of the method becomes fully efficacious. Without virtue, even if one seeks to employ the full method, it will not yield even a fraction of its power. All depends on the measure of one’s virtue, which determines the measure of one’s mastery in the various arts of the Dao. The same applies to refinement rites.

Laozi, Guan Yin, Liezi, and Zhuangzi all took the realization of the Dao as their primary concern; next came virtue, and only then did they ever speak of methods. Yet today, people practice every method, firmly believing they have received the direct transmission of some master, wielding talismans and incantations with extraordinary effects, all while neglecting virtue and playing with techniques. They fail to realize that Heaven is impartial, aiding only those with virtue. If one cannot rely on the Dao to be the Dao, how can one rely on methods to be methods? This is a grave error.

From ancient times to the present, all divine immortals have clearly seen the Dao and maintained unblemished virtue. They do not require methods to be efficacious—every word and utterance naturally resonates with heaven and earth. What need have they for methods? Methods are but the dregs of the Dao, devised for the middle and lower grades of worldly people.

Have you not seen how Duke Jing of Song uttered a single good word, and the Fire Star retreated? Huang Chengshi and Wang Ziliang, whose virtue commanded respect, naturally moved heaven, earth, and the gods—yet they never practiced methods. The Most High said: "Better to hold the precepts for a single day, die as a person of the Dao and virtue, than to live a hundred years while violating them." Those who uphold the precepts mend the heavens above and attain liberation through corpse-transcendence to ascend as immortals. Though one may be a lord or even an emperor, if burdened with grave transgressions, it is of no benefit to ghosts and spirits.

In general, those who study the Dao and seek immortality must uphold the precepts and conduct themselves with virtue, like a flawless piece of jade—every movement, stillness, word, and silence aligned with right principle, every thought in accord with the Dao. Laozi said: "Cultivating the Dao is not difficult; upholding the precepts is difficult." Those who enter the Dao through the precepts are revered throughout heaven and earth.

Lust and desire most severely corrupt virtue and deplete the source of spirit. It is best to sever them entirely. One must nurture great harmony to replenish the primordial qi, only then can one refine the yang spirit and deliver the yin souls, allowing the yin souls to find support and radiate light.

First, one must practice loyalty and filial piety to move heaven and earth, and abstain from killing to dissolve enmity. Establish the greater virtues first, so that ghosts and spirits hold one in awe and respect—only then can one serve as their teacher and model. It all depends on hidden merit and virtuous conduct, setting an example for others. Only then can one transform and transcend their spirits. It does not lie in the mere recitation of words during refinement rites.

Otherwise, one merely sets out a bowl of food to summon them to eat, reciting empty words in vain. It is like parents who feed their child but do not teach them, thereby ruining their entire life. Today they eat, tomorrow they eat—what benefit does it bring to their future? The same is true of refinement rites. Today’s refinement rites only provide food for the spirits of the netherworld. Though one may perform such rites, they have never truly received the grace of refinement, liberation, and rebirth.

Those who perform refinement rites with incomplete spiritual power and unprepared virtue, lacking the subtlety of transformative Dao, may offer rites once and then again ten times—yet all they provide is mere sustenance, failing to liberate and elevate the spirits. Some perform rites without sincerity, deeply disappointing the hopes of the departed, who weep in sorrow within the dark yin realms. If they cannot attain liberation, it is because I lack virtue and power.

Other refinement methods, though imperfect, may still summon nearby wandering souls to partake in offerings if performed with utmost sincerity—firm and unshakable. Yet they cannot shatter the hells or call forth bound and condemned spirits; such souls may eat their fill for a moment, only to hunger and thirst again, remaining trapped in the yin realms, never achieving transcendence. Without the wondrous workings of water-and-fire refinement, they cannot ascend to the Southern Palace to receive the grace of rebirth. Without the fire bell piercing the Mud Pill Palace to send them upward, there is no principle by which they may ascend to heaven.

Beyond this method, one merely "feeds ghosts," not "refines and liberates." Thus, refinement rites must employ water-and-fire refinement. In such rites, when summoning ghosts and spirits, one may initially call only those within ten *li* of the yin realms. Extending further, one may reach dozens, hundreds, thousands, or even ten thousand *li*. It is like a village chief who cannot govern a county, a county magistrate who cannot govern a prefecture, a prefect who cannot govern a province, or a provincial governor who cannot govern the realm. In the yang world, jurisdiction is bounded by office; promotion brings higher rank. In the yin realms, one’s sphere is determined by the breadth of one’s heart—with courage and vigor, the Dao expands boundlessly.

Those of shallow Dao-power, though they may summon, cannot draw the spirits near. Those of profound Dao-power reach everywhere, liberating all without exception—how wondrous! If their hearts are narrow and base, they will forever sink into the realm of hungry ghosts. If my own heart is not vast, I cannot unfold the transformations of Dao. With a broad heart, the ten directions are all embraced; with impartiality, yin and yang are no longer divided. Without a heart of universal, great compassion—unhindered and unbounded—one cannot speak of grand refinement rites. Only those of lofty merit may preside over them.

Thus it is said: Those who perform high refinement rites should study this carefully, for then no spirit will remain trapped. I place my hopes in later generations who awaken the great heart of Dao. Anyone wishing to perform such rites—whether they have received the registers or not—may do so. To claim that only those with ritual office may conduct refinement rites is utter folly.

When first undertaking this practice, one should memorialize the Most Compassionate August One and petition the Supreme Ultimate Lord Ge Xian. As for the rites themselves, on the day prior, one need only submit a document to the local City God, who will transmit the sincerity of the plea upward to the August One, requesting an edict be issued to all yin officials for their cooperation. There is no need for further memorials or petitions. Some today cling to the notion that every yin office must be notified, failing to understand that the Most High Heavenly Worthy is the sovereign of liberation for the yin realms. Once a decree is issued, none dare disobey—why persist in endless formalities?

Moreover, with a single-minded focus, one’s perception penetrates the ten directions, swifter than wind or thunder, and all respond without fail. Some versions, like that of Master Dong, include summoning talismans and memorials to the Supreme Heaven of the North Pole, Fengdu, the Three Mao Lords, and other offices—all superfluous. Other methods require transmission from a master and subsequent memorials, yet some who receive transmission never submit them. Refinement rites may be conducted independently, with or without memorials; I myself once performed them without such formalities.

It is like those who establish prisons: they need not report to the magistrate but merely inform the gatekeeper to enter and administer punishment to the convicts without hindrance. Some use merit certificates or precept certificates for the spirits, but these are not comprehensive. During refinement rites, deceased ancestors and parents will arrive first; those already reborn will not return. When first performing the rites, one refines the seven generations of ancestral spirits, all of whom receive liberation and rebirth—this is the great bridge by which filial children and compassionate descendants offer deliverance to their forebears. Those devoted to the Dao, can you not strive to practice this?

With prolonged refinement rites, one extends one’s own lifespan and gains blessings in this life; in the future, one may become a true immortal of the Southern Palace. Those of even greater merit and conduct achieve still more. Yet one must never rely on refinement rites as merit or harbor such thoughts, lest one incur transgression instead.

In the method’s application—reciting incantations, sprinkling water, proclaiming the precious registers, and so on—one first sits in silent meditation for a long while, then acts. One must memorize the sequence of procedures beforehand to enter stillness without distraction, avoiding the need to consult texts mid-rite. Beginners should follow the proper order, focusing intently. Though it may seem cumbersome at first, with practice, the actions become effortless, flowing naturally into order.

Today, people favor empty show over substantive practice, insisting on gathering crowds to chant in unison, believing only grand ceremonies with resounding music constitute merit—how lamentable! Why neglect the inner work, disdaining purification rites, and chase only the corrupt practices of ritual formalism? They seek mere spectacle to please others, forgetting their true purpose, sinking ever lower—yet people delight in it.

I now devote myself entirely to the essential inner work, pouring out my heart to transform others, eschewing ornate displays to please the world. If later generations reject my teachings and fail to practice them, will there be no Yang Xiong among them?

As for grand purification and offering rites, though their procedures differ, they are essentially performed through exposition. Yet their application and effort may not match the precision and subtlety of refinement rites.

Once, there was a man who devoted his entire life to sacrificial refinement rites, achieving no small measure of spiritual resonance. Yet he refused to practice any other method for governing ghosts and spirits. When others urged him to do so, he would say: "Do not teach me to harbor murderous intent and harm ghosts and spirits, for that would damage my single-minded compassion in sacrificial refinement." His words were most profound. Ghosts and spirits, pitying those who possess compassion, would not bear to see them suffer—how much less would they dare to oppose them?

Those who perform ritual methods ultimately set themselves against ghosts and spirits. To set oneself against them is necessarily to harbor malice, yet the great virtue of Heaven and Earth is called "life," and the fundamental heart of the Supreme Lord is love for all living things. If one could preserve their essence and spirit entirely within themselves, accumulating great virtue and merit for all things, then a single utterance would suffice to transform ghosts and spirits, summon clear skies or rain—what need would there be for the practice of various methods? This is like an age of perfect governance, where the Dao is used to transform people, never relying on laws to control them.

For one who spends their life solely in sacrificial refinement, the intent to give life endures without end. Without murderous intent, who could disrupt them? With a single mind deeply concentrated, all beings are delivered, and Heaven, Earth, ghosts, and spirits are transformed to become one with them. If one can uphold this great compassion and apply it to the inner methods of sacrificial refinement, this may be called the highest grade of refinement.

The *Appendix to Dai Jun’s Sacrificial Refinement* states: The Primordial Beginning suspended a single precious pearl, no larger than a millet grain, and the sacred multitudes of the ten directions entered through its opening. In Vimalakīrti’s fragrant kitchen, a single bowl of pure rice sated all buddhas, devas, and bodhisattvas. From this, one may comprehend the meaning of transforming offerings for ghosts: a single thought can gather all souls, a single grain can satisfy all desires—it is merely a matter of skillfully extending one’s intent. Those of great perception and broad vision should not confine themselves to the narrow counts of precious registers. To speak of "so many registers" as if they could deliver "so many souls" is mistaken. With a single thought of vastness, the grace of the Most High shines everywhere without obstruction, and the three paths and six destinies may all be liberated—just as a general amnesty extends to all prisoners in every prefecture and county, not limited to a single pardon. If one clings to rigid methods and fails to grasp the principles of adaptability, then across the four directions and eight reaches of space, and throughout the ages of past and future, how many will remain untransformed? How could registers alone suffice?

Yet if one’s single thought is vast, then the boundless application of one’s benevolence cannot be exhausted. Those of understanding should not measure it by limits—this reasoning is most sound.

It is further said: The "Danyang Talisman," originally named the *Yellow Qi Yang Essence Cavern-Luminous Spirit Talisman*, comes from the *Upper Volume of the Golden Root Collection of Scriptures* in the *Zhou* section of the *Shangqing* canon. It was originally intended for adepts refining their forms and purifying their essences, and later, immortals used it to sacrifice to ghosts. The great Dao is a single qi, undifferentiated and without scattered form. The present text follows the version in the canon.

Among the three talismans and seals, the *Nine Dragons Talisman Command* originates from the *Qingxuan* method; the *Taiyi Compassionate Lord’s Earth-Shattering Hell-Breaking Talisman* and the *Deliverance of Suffering Souls Talisman* come from the *Shenxiao* registers. These talismans and seals originally had no borders. On the precious registers of the Southern Dipper’s six stars, some apply the *Scripture of Mindfulness for Deliverance*, some recite the names and mantras of the Southern Dipper Star Lords, and some focus on the third star, Xu, drawing upon its fiery radiance. However, the original method of sacrificial refinement never included such applications of mantras or markings. These embellishments were later inventions of masters, who treated them as secrets.

Yet they did not understand: emptiness gives rise to life, while fullness leads to death. Emptiness is the image of detachment, corresponding to the south and the element of fire. The Southern Dipper follows this principle, and one should adhere to the original method. All six stars are empty—there is no need to rigidly adhere to recitations, mantras, or markings.

Once the multitude of souls has entered refinement and completed the process, they all appear like infants, ascending with the light and departing upon lotus blossoms. The *Dragon-Tiger Section* of Master Pan’s method also contains discussions, but they are not entirely refined. None of these, however, pertain to the state of supreme tranquility in sacrificial refinement.

I have seen six or seven published versions of combined texts, such as the edition from Yuyang Abbey, which belongs to the lineage of the Perfected Sa. The *Precious Laud of Yuyang* also exists in several variants, and with the passage of time, the secret essentials have been largely lost. There are also various forms of *Hunyuan Sacrificial Refinement*, as well as *Flying Refinement* and *Qi Refinement*, each with multiple versions. As for those who practice refinement by holding their breath, this is most erroneous.

These inner refinement methods are spiritual refinements, far superior to qi refinement. Among the *Qingwei* methods, there are the *Ziyang Sacrificial Refinement* and *Yuyang Sacrificial Refinement*, among others. The *Danyang Talisman*, the *Transforming Offerings Mantra*, the *Water-Fire Refinement and Deliverance Mantra*, the *Five Phases Qi*, and the various talismans differ entirely from the sacrificial refinement methods of the *Zhengyi* tradition. Other texts on sacrificial refinement are sometimes called the *Scripture of Sacrificing to Ghosts and Refining for Deliverance* or simply *Scriptural Methods*—these are merely later attempts to elevate their names.

As for the transmission and instruction of these methods, their variations are innumerable, yet all are indiscriminately attributed to the *Refinement and Deliverance Method of Perfected Ge*. Some focus exclusively on the functions of water and fire, while others do not use water or fire in refinement. Some do not employ precious registers, others omit the *Danyang Talisman*, and some rely solely on the *Jiyouzi*. Still others place sole emphasis on Yama, the Great General—Yama being the Buddhist King of Hell—though this is a gross error. Some focus exclusively on precious registers, others on yellow qi and yang essence, and some on the functions of the sun and moon. Some emphasize other talismans and registers, while others center on the *Taiyi Heavenly Worthy*, the Southern Dipper, or various other methods. Some use only the *Huke* rituals, others rely solely on the *Middle Chapter of the Numinous Book*, the *Nine Heavens’ Chapters on the Generation of Spirits*, or the *Scripture of Salvation from Suffering*, without employing any functional methods.

Some claim that the Immortal Lord employs no other methods, relying solely on the *Danyang Talisman* for refinement and deliverance. Others focus exclusively on the *Danyang Talisman*, using four or five of its variants for ablution, water refinement, fire refinement, and dietary transformation, without employing any other techniques. Some use only the *Forty-Nine Bowls of Lamp Rituals*, while others treat the navel as the Gate of Life in their practices. Some hastily bind the *gudao* to seal the Ghost Gate of the Earth Root, or employ the *Huoluo Dipper*, or manipulate the Eight Gates of *Dunjia*, shifting the Gate of Life and the Gate of Death. Others rely on auspicious clouds to open the Gate of Life and propitious smoke to block the Gate of Death as their primary methods. Some use raw rice for offerings, while others engage in visualization, perceiving a luminous pearl suspended five *zhang* above the ground to gather wandering souls within it for deliverance.

Some conjure the deceased within a circle of light, allowing the entire household—regardless of age—to vividly witness the departed, who are then freed from their shackles and cangues, partake in offerings, undergo refinement, and ascend. Others use the *Qingling Talisman* to grant the ritual’s sponsor extraordinary responses. Though such methods dazzle the common folk and stir awe, they are not the ultimate teachings.

I have witnessed several schools of sacrificial and silent refinement, as well as numerous methods involving precious registers, water and fire refinement, and deliverance—far too many to recall in full. One internal refinement technique requires neither seated meditation nor entry into the true quiescent state; it merely involves visualizing the infant transformed into the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of *Yuanshi*, seated in the Crimson Palace, reciting the *Scripture of Salvation for All*. This is called the *Primordial Heavenly Worthy personally conducting refinement and deliverance*. Yet they fail to realize that it is merely one’s own consciousness reciting—not the original spirit, nor the true Primordial Heavenly Worthy speaking the scripture and expounding the Dao.

All the aforementioned methods fall short of the profound subtlety of silent recitation and contemplation of the Great Void. My internal refinement method was transmitted by the venerable Gao Jun of Yueyue Mountain. This discussion compiles the diverse views from various sources, critically examining and distilling their essentials to guide beginners. If one seeks to distinguish their differences, it cannot be fully expounded by a single person’s words.

Though the branches and leaves are myriad and not easily exhausted, one must first address the root.

Just as Liu Gongquan admonished in his calligraphic remonstrance: "When the heart is upright, the brush is upright." Formerly, Emperor Taizong of Tang showed his prized bow to a bowyer, who said: "If the heartwood is not straight, then the grain will be crooked; if the grain is crooked, the arrow will not fly true." I have also heard that at the farthest reaches beyond the great sea, near where the cascading waters plunge straight into the earth’s depths, there stands a mountain whose very contours and veins grow in inversion. This mountain yields copper, and when mirrors are cast from it, the faces and forms of those who gaze into them appear upside-down. For the mountain’s form follows the downward rush of the sea into the earth, and thus its copper is imbued with the inverted qi of the mountain’s growth. Those who have traveled to Java have seen such mirrors. An old temple on Wudang Mountain also once possessed one.

If even inanimate bows and mirrors are thus, how much more so the sentient beings—humans and spirits? Those who conduct refinement and deliverance must take these two examples as mirrors, often reflecting: "At the utmost extreme of sincerity, Heaven and Earth attend without the slightest gap—how could it depend on external things?"

Once, an official’s carriage moored its boat in a deserted village. After the second watch, he suddenly heard the clamor of a thousand soldiers and ten thousand horses. Startled, he pushed open the cabin and peered out, only to find the moon bright and the wind clear, with no trace of anything amiss. When he asked his companions, none had heard it. As he sat in doubt, he again heard a distant voice in the sky chanting: "The Protector has passed; the Jade Emperor approaches." The words were perfectly clear. Soon after, ethereal celestial music played and faded into the distance. He surmised that some grand ritual must be taking place nearby, drawing such a response. The next day, he inquired and walked half a *li* inland before finding a household—a lone old man. Upon repeated questioning, the man said the area had no wealthy families, nor anyone conducting rituals. The official then asked if there were any scholars in the vicinity. The reply: "A schoolmaster lives one *li* to the east."

Following the winding path, he came upon a thatched hut. Entering the gate, he saw an incense burner with smoke still curling upward, countless pebbles arranged in orderly stacks of six upon the ground. The man inside was indeed the schoolmaster. After recounting the previous night’s events, the schoolmaster’s mother came out to receive him. She went inside to prepare tea, and when it was served, she stood by as he drank. After she excused herself, he asked: "What are these pebbles for?"

The schoolmaster replied: "Thirty years ago, my mother fell gravely ill, and no medicine could cure her. I heard that only the Grand Ritual of the Heavens (*Luotian dajiao*) had the power to move the gods, so I vowed to perform it, and she recovered. Later, wishing to fulfill this vow, I asked throughout the city, but people only laughed at me. Then someone told me that the Grand Ritual required one thousand two hundred portions, costing thousands of strings of cash. When I asked what it entailed, I returned home dejected, burdened with even greater worry. Suddenly, I resolved to repay the ritual with utmost sincerity, using one thousand two hundred pebbles in place of the offerings. In my spare time from teaching, I searched the distant mountains for pebbles. At first, I found three or four a day, but later, as they grew scarce, I searched even more diligently. Each time I found one, I washed it three or four times and placed it in a clean spot, stacking them in groups of six. Except in rain or snow, I never missed a day. It took over a thousand days to gather the full number. With only an incense burner, I bowed one thousand two hundred times, repaying the Grand Ritual of the Heavens with one thousand two hundred pebbles. Last night, I had just finished the final bows when I realized the Jade Emperor and the Protector had descended—yet they did not inspect the pebbles themselves, but the sincerity of my filial devotion. What was the state of my heart after seeking pebbles for over a thousand days? Beyond this single-minded sincerity, what need is there for elaborate memorials, rituals, or ceremonial protocols?

Thus, the efficacy of ritual offerings does not lie in the size of the vessels or the quantity of the goods, but entirely in the vastness of my compassion and the breadth of my resolve to deliver the suffering souls of the netherworld. Naturally, the power of the Dao matures, vast liberation is achieved, and the profound mystery is attained. All beings are liberated, and all becomes vast and pure.

Formerly, when Sima Ziwei was fast asleep, the Celestial Master heard the clear, resonant sound of a youth reciting scriptures from within his brain. Yet Sima Ziwei himself was entirely unaware, for his practice of "sitting in forgetfulness" had reached such purity that his original spirit manifested of its own accord.

The essence of refinement and deliverance must take these two examples as models. Then the transformative power of the Dao lies not in external things, but within oneself.

Once, someone asked a patriarch about the essence of refinement and deliverance. He replied: "Only one who dedicates their entire life to the great Dao, vowing to unfold boundless compassion to save all beings, may practice it. Second, without a decade of self-cultivation, upholding precepts, accumulating essence, and refining the spirit, one cannot perform refinement and deliverance." His words were profound, for he regarded refinement and deliverance as matters of great weight.

If one asks: "The Heaven above and below, the Jasper Terrace of the Jade Capital, the Fengdu Springs and Yellow Springs—are these not all contingent matters, symbolic names, and allegorical teachings? They illustrate that the Dao is greater than Heaven and Earth, while this body is one with them, not some separate external thing." The Most High (*Taishang*) desires only that each person return the creative power of Heaven and Earth to their own nature and life, merging form and spirit, unifying the Three Powers (*sancai*) into one, and thus reverting to the supreme Dao.

Yet if one clings rigidly to appearances or fixed views, they lose their original truth. I know the Most High would never assent to this: though all the creative workings of Heaven and Earth are never apart from this single body, to obstinately insist that this body *is* the creative workings of Heaven and Earth would be a far greater error.

As Liezi said: "Truly, Heaven and Earth and the myriad things do not depart from one another—but to claim possession of them is delusion."

The words are most subtle, yet those who penetrate the subtleties of Heaven and Earth merely perceive the smallness of the single heart—how wondrous is its power to embrace the vastness of Heaven and Earth! The *Liezi* and *Zhuangzi* say: "This body is not yours; it is Heaven and Earth’s entrusted form. Life is not yours; it is Heaven and Earth’s entrusted harmony. Nature and destiny are not yours; they are Heaven and Earth’s entrusted compliance." The inferior scholar clings to externals, the middling scholar clings to internals, while the superior scholar forgets both inner and outer, letting Heaven be Heaven alone. This is the meaning of Laozi’s "transcending the body to preserve it."

Lao Jun further said: "Take emptiness as the body, take nothingness as the heart. The body of no-body, the heart of no-heart—these can guard the spirit. Guarding the spirit, one attains mysterious communion; this is called unity with the Dao." If one reaches this state, one no longer distinguishes between Heaven and Earth, creation and transformation, water and fire, self and other. Naturally, one merges with creation, not by merging with creation but by having no means to measure it. Yet there was never any means to measure it—this is precisely how it is measured.

The *Doctrine of the Mean* says: "Vocal tones and visible forms are but the lesser means of transforming the people; the workings of Supreme Heaven are utterly silent and without scent—this is the highest." In my practice of sacrifice and refinement, I hold the same view. What binds ghosts and spirits from liberation is but a single word: *stagnation*—clinging to nothingness as if it were something. What enables the Most High to deliver beings is but a single word: *transformation*—revolving existence back into nothingness.

During sacrifice and refinement, one must not fall into the dualistic views of being and non-being, nor entertain distinctions between inner and outer, self and other. How could one who practices sacrifice and refinement fail to know that without the great heart of non-heart, there can be no great sacrifice and refinement? Though ghosts and spirits receive my offerings, I offer with the heart of no-heart. Though they receive my refinement, I refine with the heart of no-heart. As for the self that delivers them, I deliver with the heart of no-heart—truly unaware of existence or non-existence, unaware of deliverance or its absence. This is the greatest transformation, not the lesser refinement of deliverance.

If I act with a heart of intention, no matter how I sacrifice, refine, or deliver, self and other will never be transformed. One must forget both self and other, even forget one’s own body and the affairs of ghosts and spirits. Simply devote the heart wholly to sincere sacrifice and refinement, and naturally, ghosts and spirits will attain the great benefit of wordless liberation. It is like the boundless grace of Heaven and Earth, sun and moon, rain and dew—though they give life to the myriad things, none can fathom how they accomplish it. To know it is to be human; not to know is to be Heaven.

The *Book of Changes* says: "The Creative does not speak of its great benefit—how supremely subtle, leaving no trace!" Yet when the Most High transforms people and teaches the Dao, it is like instructing a child to walk: one must proceed step by step, gradually guiding them. To demand great strides at once would surely lead to stumbling. Thus, for beginners in practice and those engaged in sacrifice and refinement, one must work within the body—visualizing, gathering *qi*, and other methods—to embody creation. Without this, one will inevitably cling to externals, scattering one’s spirit and *qi*, disturbing one’s thoughts, and turning them into external things. Without the aid of visualization and refinement to return to oneself, one cannot attain the state of non-doing and naturalness, where self and things are one, Heaven and humanity share a single principle.

The *Sutra of Saving the Suffering* says: "Recite without ceasing, return the heart without pause." Only by returning the heart without pause can one naturally enjoy great blessings in Heaven and silence the cries of suffering in Hell. If you now deliver the sinful yet do not awaken to returning your thoughts to your own heart, I do not know how you can save them from suffering. "Returning the heart" may also be called "returning the spirit"—the meaning is the same.

Guan Yinzi said: "Some recite incantations, some serve spirits, some use talismans, some manipulate fingers—all can command spirits, direct *qi*, and transform the myriad things. Yet those lacking sincerity find it hard to trust themselves and easily trust external things. Thus, they rely on these methods. But if one truly knows sincerity, one need not depend on them to achieve it." Guan Yinzi’s words strike deeply at the truth. The world’s people trust talismans, external objects, and ornate rituals, yet do not trust the heavenly principle within themselves. Is it any wonder they diverge in countless ways, forgetting the root to chase the branches, unwilling to turn back? Only by not clinging to anything and letting the empty room naturally fill with light can one unite with all above and below Heaven, attaining true purity and naturalness.

For beginners in the Dao and its methods, self-trust is difficult, while trust in external things comes easily. One cannot rush them; without gradual guidance, how can they return home? To cross a river, one needs a raft; upon reaching the shore, the raft is no longer needed. This saying is not only beneficial for sacrifice and refinement. All ancient and modern methods, including those of sacrifice and refinement, are inherently neither superior nor inferior—it is people’s differing capacities that make them so. Thus, one cannot but proceed in stages.

Advancing further, one may set out food and water or not, omit talismans, dispense with visualization, and simply focus on deep sitting and prolonged stillness. With single-minded absorption, recite the main text of sacrifice and refinement once in order, humbly providing for their sustenance, receiving refinement and precepts, and enabling them to ascend to Heaven. All transformations—food and drink, refinement by water and fire, the workings of Heaven—arise naturally from the heart’s spiritual responsiveness. There is no need for further visualization or techniques like exhaling and blowing. If employed, they will disturb the deepest recesses of the five viscera, harming one’s true *qi* and causing leakage and damage.

Thus, the highest practice lies in non-doing.

Advancing further still, those who possess enduring great resolve, pure virtue, and abundant spirit—those uniquely adept in true stillness—shall awaken to the great Dao on their own. Void and without manifold distinctions, it cannot be seen at the edges of vision nor heard at the limits of hearing. Within it abides the true body of the Most High Heavenly Worthy. Yet one must never seek it through worldly sounds or smiles, nor conceive of it as existent or non-existent, for both views are gravely mistaken.

One ought only to roam the deepest and most mysterious heavens, directing this single thought toward the vast vow of great deliverance for all beings. Gather them back to the source—neither seeing nor hearing, neither thinking nor imagining—transcending both existence and non-existence, leaving behind self and other. Within the vast emptiness, in the midst of soundlessness and formlessness, gently and slowly, profoundly and obscurely, with intentionless intention, silently recite the vow:

*"Proclaim great amnesty to the ten directions, delve into the deepest hells, universally summon the hidden souls of the five destinies. Let them receive natural bathing in sweet dew, heavenly sustenance, dharma-water, refinement by water and fire, the wondrous precepts of the Nine Perfected, and the jeweled thread to ascend to Heaven."*

This forty-character rite of sacrifice and refinement, conducted in profound obscurity, mobilizes the subtlest sincerity. Without fail, it pervades all, extending even beyond the ten directions. Every transformation, every realm, arises spontaneously and naturally—why cling to visualization or contrived techniques, to any fabricated state, when one’s own naturally tranquil stillness suffices?

This method may be likened to a single drop of true gold, its source profound and transformative, penetrating above and below, the true heart universally pervading. Though called the workings of the Most High Heavenly Worthy, it cannot be said to be one’s own workings, nor can it be affirmed as real. All is the natural operation of the great Dao—what has it to do with me? One must not cling to existence, nor to non-existence, nor even to stillness as something great. Without the extraordinary virtue of one who has embraced the deepest resolve and profoundest stillness, and without the long-standing, sincere vow to deliver all beings, this must not be undertaken lightly or treated as mere literary form. The slightest deviation risks misleading the hidden dead and inviting karmic retribution. Only those of surpassing attainment should recognize this as the most wondrous of methods.

Without deep realization of the ultimate Dao—clear and unmistakable, with unwavering conviction in the heart—how could one dare attempt it? There is no need to visualize ascent or descent, for ascent and descent occur naturally. There is no need to contrive movement, for movement arises from non-doing and spontaneity. To fix it in the eyes is inferior to fixing it in the heart; to fix it in the heart is inferior to fixing it in principle; to fix it in principle is inferior to fixing it in nothingness. Yet who knows what is fixed when nothing is fixed? To fix without fixing—this is the ultimate.

Beyond this point, to seek sacrifice and refinement as mere sacrifice and refinement is impossible, for this is true sacrifice and refinement. If we examine the method from beginning to end, in its coarse and refined aspects, we see that at first, before stillness is attained, one must rely on visualization to focus the mind. In the end, when stillness is dissolved, one must forget visualization to preserve true thought. Both contrived visualization and contrived stillness are false. At its ultimate, it is nothing but the true heart pervading this supreme transformation—what else could there be? Yet these eight characters—*"pure is the true heart pervading this supreme transformation"*—are not what the world ordinarily means by them. One must delve deeply, delve deeply indeed.

Scattered in phenomena, it is called *dharma*; dissolved into Heaven, it is called *Dao*. To aid through dharma is small; to transform through Dao is great. Enslaved by the many, one wanders in the realm of splendor, practicing human-made sacrifice and refinement. Dissolved into oneness, one returns to the root of creation—this is natural sacrifice and refinement. Is it not superior to the human-made?

As the *Sutra of Meditative Observation* states: *"Above the still mind, suddenly there is no covering; below the still mind, emptily there is no foundation."* Thus, one is submissive within the realm of the great Dao, the ears and eyes forget sound and form, the body forgets objects, and the mind forgets the Dao. In this state, sacrifice and refinement arise from non-doing and spontaneity—great indeed is natural sacrifice and refinement!

The *Sutra of Salvation from Suffering* says: *"The natural has a distinct body, originally within the empty and boundless. The empty and boundless leave no trace, yet the entire body is empty space."* Where, then, is there no Most Compassionate Heavenly Worthy? This is how the Most Compassionate Heavenly Worthy saves from suffering.

Yet I fear that those of middling and lesser capacity will not believe, will not awaken, and cannot shed their habitual human contrivances to attain profound purity. Those who focus their minds on sacrifice and refinement must choose between these two paths. Those who have truly attained the Dao may transcend convention in their practice, but this is not the present discussion. For those whose attainment has not yet reached this level, carelessness and haste are unacceptable, for they not only mislead the hidden dead but also incur no small guilt for themselves.

Here, both shallow and deep methods are presented, and it is for each to assess their own insight and capacity in practice. This may suffice. Sacrifice is not easy, refinement is not easy, and deliverance is even less so. Without sincerity, one cannot perform sacrifice. Without profundity, one cannot achieve refinement. Without thorough understanding of nature and destiny, without complete virtue, one cannot effect deliverance. Those with aspiration for the Dao must repeatedly and deeply reflect on this.

The Most High speaks no words; those who follow speak words. Yet the Dao fundamentally has no discourse—all speech arises only from necessity.

Within these teachings, one thus recognizes this method as a direct and simple path—all empty formalities, every trace of superficiality, must be entirely discarded. Do not trust those who falsely claim additions are needed, asserting that some place lacks a wondrous gesture or that another requires some incantation, thereby distorting this true method to serve their private ends as a means to peddle their teachings. Having obtained this inner refinement method, it is indeed a virtuous foundation. Now, I fully disclose all that has been transmitted and learned, compiling it above under the title *The Supreme Ultimate’s Cinnabar Rite of Sacrifice and Refinement*. I dare not conceal even the slightest detail, for to deceive heaven and earth, to mislead later generations, to mislead spirits and ghosts, would mean eternal loss of human form and perpetual descent into hell. If I do not mislead later generations or spirits and ghosts, may this method one day circulate widely, enabling all sentient beings to attain deliverance.

This inner refinement method universally liberates the suffering of the hidden dead, its merit boundless and beyond words. Its subtleties defy description, and only those of profound samādhi may attain them. Without forever severing thoughts of wives and concubines, one cannot enter samādhi; even if one enters, one will inevitably fall into demonic paths—how dreadful, how dreadful! Let this not go unsaid.

Should one awaken the Dao-mind during the Three Primes and Eight Festivals, universally receiving petitions to deliver the named departed, and wish to establish an altar with proper ritual decorum, let those of true Dao-mind preside over the liturgical proceedings. As for myself, I will seclude myself in a quiet chamber, not interfering in the slightest with the jiao rites, sitting in meditation alone. The longer the stillness, the deeper the subtlety. Secretly practicing the inner refinement of sacrifice and refinement, just as in the method above, one will achieve true efficacy within while presenting an admirable spectacle without. Many past patriarchs who established grand Yellow Register rites conducted themselves in this manner. If one insists on outward splendor, this method also satisfies both ends.

Some may say: This rite of sacrifice and refinement strips away all superficiality, laying bare the very core—without unwavering perseverance and utmost sincerity, few may reach this realm. Yet I must not withhold anything; I must fully reveal my heart and speak all. Those who wish to practice this rite of sacrifice and refinement must take solemn vows, set their resolve with great aspiration, and surpass what is now called grand Yellow Register jiao rites a hundred thousandfold. To regard it as a mere ordinary rite of sacrifice and refinement would be to betray me. Do not think it costs nothing—how could it constitute great merit? If so, it is not my rite of sacrifice and refinement. Without a heart dripping blood, a single-minded sincerity, how could one grasp the original intent of my inner method of sacrifice and refinement?

Yet I truly rejoice in this method, for it requires no reliance on others but operates alone within the profound mysteries, penetrating above and below, flowing in harmony with heaven and earth—how wondrous! In recent years, I pledged before the numinous altar, vowing to transform and deliver sentient beings. Reflecting on past practices, I have repeatedly expounded and earnestly exhorted, yet still, they do not believe. If later generations fail to urgently embrace this transformative teaching, I will have no regrets.

Some suggest that this text should be divided into sections with distinct topics, allowing readers to seek by category. Yet within it, some matters are introduced early and elaborated later, some ideas are suppressed before being raised, and others are interwoven throughout, so that from beginning to end, there appear to be connections.

Little do they realize that when divided for discussion, its meaning becomes shallow, but when viewed as a whole, its meaning deepens—if one were to partition it by topic, it would become a rigid doctrine. Long ago, the Divine Lord Ge dwelled in secluded contemplation on Mount Ruoye. One day, he was moved by the celestial Yu Luo Qiao, the radiant light of true concentration, and the wondrous voice of the Three Perfected Ones, who descended from the sky riding phoenixes to bestow upon him the *Dharma Wheel Sutra*. They greatly praised and encouraged his resolve to deliver the hidden immortals. Today, beside the Tongbai Temple on Mount Tiantai, there stands the Falan Temple, the very site where the Divine Lord conducted his ancient rites of refinement. Though the temple bears a stele, I have not seen it. It was through profound contemplation and stillness that he attained the radiance of true concentration, and within that light, he proclaimed his own wondrous voice, thereby beholding the Three Masters of Yu Luo Qiao—this was precisely the marvel born of the Divine Lord’s deep meditation. Many ancient immortals attained the Dao through such concentrated thought. Not only the Han Celestial Master Liu Gen, Bo He, Bo Shanfu, Xiang Left, the Divine Lord Ge, and Wu Jun, but also the *Great Cavern Scripture*, the *Scripture of Concentration and Contemplation*, and the *Guanzi* all discuss the power of focused meditation. Since ancient times, those who study the Dao and perform rituals have all emphasized deep contemplation, declaring: "Refine your thoughts, devote your whole heart, exhaustively investigate the supreme Dao—this is what it means to enter mindfulness through mindfulness, to condense spirit into spirit." Is not concentrated thought the essential gateway to the Dao?

In his *Biography of the Ancestral Master Ge Xuan*, Ge Zhichuan recorded many events, yet he did not include the story of the ritual refinement and its divine response. Instead, he wrote that on the thirteenth day of the eighth month, a great wind arose, and Xuan vanished without a trace. Others claim that a heavenly decree summoned him to ascend on the third day of the third month at the hour of yin. These accounts differ entirely from the details preserved in the records of the refinement rites. Some say that a mighty ghost king knelt in reverence before the Divine Lord, declaring that he had delivered eighty thousand ghosts, all of whom were reborn. Three years later, the Divine Lord attained the rank of Great Immortal. After his ascension, he left the *Ritual for Delivering Ghosts* at the Chongxu Jing Altar. Yet today, none can verify these claims. As for the Divine Lord’s practice of fasting to deliver ghosts, those who have not reached his level of attainment should not rashly imitate him. The Divine Lord’s name was Xuan, and his courtesy name was Xiaoxian. He held the celestial office of Immortal Elder, and it is said that immortals possess such power: once, a divine immortal came to the home of a beggar in the snow and, seeing the beggar nearly frozen to death, took pity. He declared, "I exhale qi to bring spring, that you may be warmed." Suddenly, the room filled with the warmth of deep spring. The beggar’s complexion flushed as if drunk, his body grew warm as in spring, and nearby trees burst into bloom. Such is the nature of immortals—their spirit is so abundant and in such perfect harmony with the Dao that they achieve the impossible. Thus, the Divine Lord’s great work of refinement was an act of boundless kindness, a manifestation of the profound mysteries of creation.

Later generations, however, neglect the root and delight in the branches, falling far short of the Divine Lord’s stature. Though the Divine Lord attained immortality through refinement rites, I lament that I cannot transform the whole world into beings like him—yet people refuse to become like him. How pitiful! Those who study the Dao in future generations should emulate the Divine Lord’s resolve, lest they fail to honor the inner method of refinement.

This discourse on refinement has long resided in my heart. Compiled into the *Essay on Refinement Rites*, it was completed in the year *gengwu*. Whether one follows the Daoist path and learns the Divine Lord’s method of refinement and deliverance, or the Buddhist path and studies Ānanda’s ritual of offering food to the hungry ghosts, as long as there is sincerity of heart, it matters not whether one follows the teachings of the Buddha or the Dao—both serve to deliver the suffering beings of the netherworld. One should enter through what they love, for then their faith will be steadfast, their dedication unwavering, and their efforts focused. Only thus may they hope to persevere, accumulate merit over time, and ultimately attain the Dao.

I began with Confucianism, turned to Daoism in my middle years, and finally embraced Buddhism. I also composed the *Mind Method of the Buddhist Offering Ritual*, along with discourses on almsgiving and auxiliary practices, totaling nearly twenty thousand words. May those who take interest in these matters examine them carefully. For those who wholeheartedly practice the inner method of refinement from beginning to end, I pray that they be forever shielded from disaster. May those who aspire to become immortals swiftly achieve their goal, each ultimately transcending to the supreme Dao. Yet I regret that my virtuous deeds fall short of ordinary people’s, and my empty words offer no benefit to sentient beings. If my teachings are in error, I pray that the gods and spirits swiftly destroy this book, lest it mislead future generations.

Six years later, Zheng Sixiao of Suonan wrote this. In the year of *xinmao*, when Ma Xingzhi was twenty-one, I transmitted to him the inner method of refinement along with the *Essay on Refinement Rites*. I made a covenant with him, saying: "The human form is hard to obtain, and sentient beings are pitiable. Pass this teaching heart to heart, lamp to lamp. Uphold my conduct, swear by my heaven, and may all in the world be transformed into beings like the Divine Lord and ascend as immortals." I place great hope in those who come after. Practice diligently and guard this teaching with single-minded devotion.

On the twenty-first day of the ninth month in the year *bingzi*, the day before my thirty-sixth birthday and the anniversary of my birth in *xinchou*, the Recluse of Suonan wrote this.

When I was eighteen, Shen Zhiwo developed an interest in the Dao and earnestly sought the inner method of refinement. He requested its essentials, so I presented this text to him. Before the existence of the Great Ultimate, there was a single phrase—it was the Primordial Compassionate Venerable, the ancestral master of the Great Ultimate Immortal. If one understands the meaning of bowing one’s head and lifting one’s gaze, and beholds it even once, then even in the absence of refinement rites, the practice will flow freely and unimpeded. Let go of all doubts and universally invite all to examine the annotations of the refinement rites.

The Recluse of Suonan wrote this.

The reason the Dao is the Dao is that it wanders with heaven and earth and the myriad things in a realm beyond questioning. For there has never been anything separate from the Dao, and those who do not use the Dao to benefit the world grasp only its superficial aspects. The Daoist refinement rites are indeed the swiftest path to deliver the suffering beings of the netherworld. Yet if one clings rigidly to visualization and technique without ultimately returning to purity and spontaneity, such an approach is merely the view of the vulgar.

This is not what constitutes the great refinement rites, nor is it the true intent of this Recluse of Suonan. At the outset, one tempers it with method, but in the end, one unifies it with the Dao—this is the mark of one skilled in transforming others. Suonan, though a Confucian, wandered among the teachings of the Buddhists and Daoists, his insights free and untrammeled, his discourses well-founded. This was due to the foundational cultivation of his father, Master Jushan, who thus brought him to such attainment.

Master Jushan, whose given name was Qi and courtesy name Shuqi, was a scholar of the Dao during the Chunyou era. In the autumn of the *xinmao* year, he inscribed a letter upon the cliffs of Yantian Shangzhong, lamenting the vastness of the great kalpa and deeply mourning the suffering of sentient beings in the unseen realms. Once turned by what should be turned, yet unable to comprehend turning where nothing is turned—this is why he vowed to practice the refinement rites. Later, he obtained the inner methods of the refinement rites from Master Zheng of Suonan and sought his detailed explanations through humble inquiry. Though Master Zheng reluctantly and meticulously revised the text for him, this was never his original intent.

Having acquired the method, he began with soaring in spirit to pay homage to the Emperor, proceeded to refine the spirit and deliver the dead, and concluded with returning to illumination and reverting to the source. Vast and boundless, it was as if wandering beyond the six directions. Overjoyed, he reported this to Master Zheng, who then said: "When I once composed a book on refinement rites, it was out of necessity, merely to guide beginners and entice them onto the path. Now, what you consider marvelous as marvelous is but artifice, imagination, and technique—all illusions, not the Dao. What is truly marvelous about that?

The great Dao is non-action; its marvel lies in being marvelous without contrivance. Why resort to deliberate action to achieve it? What you now practice is action, not non-action. If you can still your ears and eyes from seeing and hearing, sever emotional thoughts of ascent and descent, shatter the duality of form and emptiness, and transcend life and death in coming and going—then what is the Dao? And what is the method?"

What is technique? What is imagination? I have none of these—how much less could they exist in that? Only when above, one sees no heaven; below, no earth; within, no self; and without, no things—then the so-called true self, vast and boundless, flows without end. Who is right? Who is wrong? Even heaven and earth, ghosts and spirits cannot depart from it.

Thus, whether called Confucianism or Confucianism, Buddhism or Buddhism, Daoism or Daoism, worldly dharma or worldly dharma, transcendent dharma or transcendent dharma—wherever one goes, one follows it. Different yet not different, the same yet not the same, it adapts to all practices, yet none can fathom why it is so.

Why single out refinement rites in this way? You should strive for this Dao where no further progress seems possible. Only when you shatter the confines of language and the molds of emotional consciousness can it be called true refinement—nothing like the refinement rites of the world. How wondrous the blessings bestowed upon beings and spirits!

Though I am dull-witted, I shall heed these words. I wish to transform like-minded ones to practice together, steadfastly avoiding deception of others or of ghosts and spirits. Thus, I vow to propagate this book on the Master’s behalf, spreading it throughout the ten directions, across the three times, six realms, and four births of all worlds.

Those who regard refinement rites merely as method—how could they ever grasp this? I have recorded here what I personally heard from the Master.
