### **The Upper Dao of the Hall of Light Palace (First Method)**
Enter three inches inward from the angles of the eyebrows along the bone. On the left is the **Crimson Terrace and Azure Chamber**; on the right is the **Yellow Gate and Purple Portal**.

The **Crimson Terrace** is made of red jade, its chamber of azure jade. Within resides a great spirit, clad in azure brocade, wielding a flowing-gold fire-bell. His name is **Zhengxin** ("Rectifying the Heart"), and his style is **Qiefang** ("Cutting Square").

The **Yellow Gate** is made of yellow jade, its chamber of purple jade. Within resides a great spirit, clad in yellow brocade, wielding a flowing-gold fire-bell. His name is **Pingjing** ("Tranquil Equilibrium"), and his style is **Fawang** ("Dharma King").

They exhale clouds of azure, yellow, and purple qi, seated within to bar all demonic and perverse qi. If golden sounds or jade vibrations are heard within the ears, it signifies external matters entering the palace. The two spirits strike golden bells and jade chimes to alert the nine palaces.

**Method:** Rub both hands until warm, cover the ears, and click the teeth nine times. Hold the breath and recite the heart incantation:
> *"The Red Child dwells in the palace, the Nine Palaces in the chamber.
> Hear the numinous command to repel misfortune.
> The Great One flows fire to dispel calamity and disaster."*

When the incantation is complete, if warmth is felt upon the face, it signals the arrival of perverse qi. Immediately visualize the two spirits casting their flowing-gold fire-bells outward from the angles of the eyebrows. After a while, rub the hands together again until warm, cover the ears, and if the head and face feel gently warm, the perverse qi has departed. If a chilling sensation remains, the perverse qi lingers. Click the teeth nine more times, recite the heart incantation thrice, and visualize the two spirits casting their flowing-gold fire-bells throughout the Mud-Pill Palace. The perverse qi will depart at once. Then rest briefly, and recovery will follow.

**One inch inward from the eyebrows is the Hall of Light Palace.** On the left is the **solar emblem**, nine *fen* in diameter, with nine rays of purple light. On the right is the **lunar emblem**, one *cun* in diameter, with ten rays of yellow light. At its center resides the **Spirit Lord of the Luminous Mirror**, whose countenance resembles a newborn infant, clad in green brocade, bearing a flowing-gold fire-bell, and holding a red jade mirror in his mouth, which emits a crimson glow. He is a divine emanation of the Great Emperor of Longevity, titled the **Perfected Lord of the Hall of Light**, named **Siming** ("Fourfold Brightness"), and styled **Zhaojing** ("Illuminating Essence").

To his left is the **Perfected Lord of the Luminous Youth**, resembling the Emperor Lord. He is a divine emanation of the Venerable Lord Han, named **Xuanyang** ("Mysterious Yang"), and styled **Shaoqing** ("Lesser Clarity").

To his right is the **Perfected Maiden of the Luminous Woman**, also resembling the Emperor Lord, named **Xuanyin** ("Mysterious Yin"), and styled **Shaoyuan** ("Lesser Origin").

**Method:** Call their names thrice, click the teeth nine times, and recite the heart incantation:
> *"Purple Portal and Azure Chamber, within dwell great spirits.
> Cutting Square and Dharma King enter next the Hall of Light.
> Mysterious Brightness and Primordial Clarity, Fourfold Brightness Illuminating Essence,
> seated to guard the Hall of Light, mouth holding the jade mirror,
> severing misfortune, flowing-gold fire-bells dispelling calamity and disaster."*

When traveling by night, visualize the Three Lords holding the red jade mirror to illuminate the path, and brightness will follow. When encountering malevolent people, evil ghosts, passing by demonic shrines, or traversing perilous terrain, visualize the Three Lords brandishing the red jade mirror with a sound like thunder. Bandits, evil ghosts, and all adversaries will be struck down and toppled.

When afflicted by pestilential qi or chills and fevers, visualize the Three Lords striking the jade mirror forty-nine times. It will transform into a great fire, scorching the body. After a while, sweat will emerge, warmth will return, and the illness will vanish at once.

When traveling without food or provisions, visualize the Three Lords striking the red jade mirror thirty-six times. The crimson qi within the mirror will transform into a red liquid. Press the tongue against the upper palate, fill the mouth with saliva, and do not swallow. After a moment, the warmth will divide into three swallows, used thrice to instantly dispel hunger and thirst.

If sounds of combing, waving, drumming, or striking are heard in the ears—signs of bodily fatigue leading to grave illness—burn incense in a quiet chamber, lie supine, and visualize the Three Lords striking the jade mirror twenty-four times. Crimson qi will suffuse the body, transforming into a great fire to refine the form until it glows red. After a time, the illness will vanish at once.

If blood unexpectedly appears or a bloody stench is detected—omens of violent misfortune—immediately observe a fast, enter seclusion, and avoid worldly affairs. Seek aid from the Three August Lords of the Three Origins and the Three Lords of the Hall of Light for a full month to transform misfortune into fortune.

When plagued by nightmares, turn the pillow and blanket, press the left hand to the heart, click the teeth twenty-four times, and secretly pray:
> *"Perfected and Mysterious of the Great Cavern, refining the Three Hun,
> obeying the heart’s discipline, swiftly ascend to the Three Origins’ Palace of the Supreme.
> Facing inauspicious dreams, the Seven Po wander as corpse-ghosts to join perverse sources.
> Hasten to summon Peach-Kang to guard life, report above to the Emperor Lord.
> The Five Elders and Nine Perfected all guard the body’s gates.
> The Yellow Gate Divine Master and Purple Portal General,
> wielding halberds and shaking bells, dissolve and grind away evil spirits.
> Reverse misfortune into fortune, severing all ties with death."*

After reciting the prayer thrice, remain still for a long while, then relax the four limbs and take a brief rest—auspicious blessings will surely follow. Practicing this for three years, one will be free of all dreams; if any semblance of dreams arises, they will foretell future fortune or misfortune.

**Second Method: The Way of the Cavern Chamber Palace**
Enter the chamber, burn incense, click the teeth, sit upright, calm the mind, and quiet all thoughts. Visualize the Yellow Elder Emperor Lord within, his mouth emitting purple qi. Draw this qi through the nose and swallow it thirty-five times, thereby governing the Three Realms’ perils of water, fire, and warfare, dispelling the myriad disasters of the human world, extending lifespan, and reversing death into life—following the Dao of the Great Cavern’s revolving winds and primordial fusion. Envision oneself beside the Yellow Elder Emperor Lord, silently reciting the Nine Chapters (eighty-one in total) nine times, completing one full cycle. Then the Three Realms will record your name, the Five Emperors will inscribe your rank, and you will be listed among the Perfected—with the ten thousand spirits all embodied within you. Finally, exhale and inhale the purple qi, bathing the entire body in its radiance.

**Third Method: The Way of the Mud-Pill Palace**
Enter the chamber, burn incense, click the teeth, sit upright, calm the mind, and quiet all thoughts. Visualize the Heavenly Emperor Lord within, appearing as a newborn infant clad in red brocade, seated within the sun. Recite the taboo names of the Three Heavens—this is the divided emanation of the Primordial Beginning. To his left stands the Upper Prime Red Child Emperor Lord, also in the form of a newborn infant, wearing a crimson embroidered robe. His name is *Ningzhao*, his style *Yuanxian*, and he holds the Divine Tiger Talisman. To his right stands the Imperial Minister, likewise in the form of a newborn infant, clad in a crimson patterned robe. His name is *Zhaojing*, his style *Xuansheng*, and he holds the *Great Cavern Perfected Scripture*, with the Seven Stars of the Dipper suspended above, its handle pointing forward. Within the palace, purple qi surges upward for ninety thousand miles.

**Fourth Method: The Way of the Flowing Pearl Palace**
Enter the chamber, burn incense, click the teeth, sit upright, calm the mind, and quiet all thoughts. Visualize the Flowing Pearl Perfected Spirit, an emanation of the Supreme Dao Lord, who governs all affairs and resides in the palace of the herb immortals.

**Fifth Method: The Way of the Mysterious Cinnabar Palace**
Enter the chamber, burn incense, and invoke the Supreme One Central August Emperor Lord of the Purple Tenuity Mysterious Cinnabar Palace, whose taboo name is *Jueguiying* and whose style is *Baihuayuan*. He sits upon a golden bed within a jade canopy, draped in purple brocade, his waist adorned with fire bells to slay evil and extinguish treachery. In his hand he grasps the essence of the stars, and a halo of radiance crowns his head. Seated upright, he exhales qi to obliterate demonic traces and dissipate inauspicious vapors. He feasts with the spirits, harmonizes with the primordial qi of cinnabar, refines the hun and po, and ensures ascension to flight as an immortal. Now, with sincere reverence, I offer this rite for the myriad transformations of creation.

Next, burn incense and visualize within the Northern Dipper a single strand of purple qi like a rope descending from between the brows into the Mysterious Cinnabar Palace. Then envision the Dipper’s mouth emitting a solar image that descends from between the brows straight into the palace, where it soon transforms into a purple mist suffusing the brain like a fiery pearl. After a long while, suddenly behold the Mysterious Cinnabar Lord descending from the Dipper’s mouth, entering the palace through the space between the brows. He sits within the sun, clad in a purple embroidered robe of fine jade, his waist wrapped in a purple patterned skirt, his head crowned with a purple jade morning cap. In his left hand he holds the Dipper’s handle—the *Piaoxing* star—and in his right, the *Xuan’gen*—the star opposite the Dipper’s mouth in the Purple Tenuity Enclosure. The six stars arrayed in order shine brilliantly, with the sixth star prominent. From his mouth pours an effulgent purple qi, and fire bells hang from his waist.

Next, visualize yourself as small as a lotus seed, dressed in blue robes and cap, holding a tablet before the Mysterious Cinnabar Lord. Bow nine times and silently recite: *"Guiying Huayuan."* Call his name thrice and click the teeth nine times. After a long while, the Mysterious Cinnabar Lord and you together ride the crimson qi into the Dipper’s golden terrace and jade hall, where coral curtains drape the jeweled canopy, and golden beds and jade tables stand in state. You and the Mysterious Cinnabar Lord bow three times, then kneel and swallow eighty-one mouthfuls of purple qi. Together, you ride the purple qi back to the Mysterious Cinnabar Palace and sit. You rest before the Mysterious Cinnabar Lord, focusing your intent for a long while, until an extraordinary response arrives. After a moment, stabilize your breath and exit the chamber. Practice this regularly.

At the solar terms—*Lichun* and *Chunfen*—ride the purple qi into the Dipper and reach the *Yangming* star, where you drink nine mouthfuls of green qi. At *Lixia* and *Xiazhi*, reach the *Danyuan* star and drink three mouthfuls of red qi. At *Liqiu* and *Qiufen*, reach the *Yinjing* star and drink seven mouthfuls of white qi. At *Lidong* and *Dongzhi*, reach the *Xuanming* star and drink five mouthfuls of black qi. At the four seasonal transitions, reach the *Tianguan* star and drink twelve mouthfuls of yellow qi. Upon completion, the Supreme One and you together return to your own Mysterious Cinnabar Palace, where you withdraw into your own heart.

Practicing this for eighteen years, a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders will welcome you to ascend at dawn. Its efficacy is most wondrous, repelling the myriad demons—its marvels cannot be fully described. If one follows this Way, there is no need to practice the Three Ones method.

The Esoteric Jade Formula of the Four Feminine Palaces’ True Unity and Inner Spirits

For all who seek the Dao of the Supreme Perfected, without knowing the inner names of the Feminine True Unity, none shall attain immortality. Disciples must first receive the oral transmission from their master before practicing.

The Divine Mother of Jade Clarity, surnamed Lian, named Han, styled Huangyan, stands nine inches and nine fen tall. She wears a sash of dark yellow and plain numinous silk, her hair bound in a topknot adorned with seven strands of pearls and jade. Crowned with the Infinite Wisdom Coronet, she dwells in the Supreme Pearl Palace of the Utmost Ultimate, the Seven Treasures Repository in the Five Numinous Precinct of the Mysterious Origin Hamlet. Below, she governs the Jade Emperor Palace within the adept’s body.

The Perfected Maiden of Supreme Clarity, surnamed Jue, named Hui, styled Bilei, stands six inches and six fen tall. She wears a sash of azure treasure and divine radiance, woven with cloud-brocade in nine colors. Her hair is bound in a topknot of jade and flying clouds, crowned with the Dark Yellow Wisdom Coronet. She dwells in the Supreme Kunlun Palace of the Utmost Darkness atop the Utmost Ultimate, the Bright Hall Repository in the Nine Radiance Precinct of the Great Transformation Hamlet. Below, she governs the Celestial Court Palace within the adept’s body.

The Empress of the Supreme Ultimate, surnamed Xuan, named Xusheng, styled Bowu, stands seven inches and seven fen tall. She wears a sash of dark silk and flowing light, embroidered with five-colored phoenix patterns. Her hair is bound in a topknot of seven treasures and dark clouds, crowned with the Infinite Wisdom Coronet. She dwells in the Palace of the Utmost Mystery atop the Primordial Radiance of the Supreme Clarity, the Jade Chamber Repository in the Three Cinnabar Precinct of the Cinnabar Origin Hamlet. Below, she governs the Palace of the Utmost Perfection within the adept’s body.

The Queen of the Supreme Lord, surnamed Qian, named Hanhai, styled Hexiansheng, stands three inches and three fen tall. She wears a sash of seven treasures, flying essence, dark radiance, cloud-brocade, and frost-silk in nine-colored patterns. Her hair is bound in a topknot of ninefold mystery and jade essence, crowned with the Dark Yellow Infinite Three Treasures Jade Coronet. She dwells in the Palace of the Utmost Perfection atop the Ninefold Mystery of the Supreme Clarity, the Cinnabar Essence Repository in the Cloud Radiance Precinct of the Mysterious Mystery Hamlet. Below, she governs the Supreme August Palace within the adept’s body.

In practicing the Dao of Mysterious Cinnabar and guarding the formula of the Three Ones, one must visualize the spirits of the Four Feminine Palaces’ True Unity—their attire, forms, names, taboo names, precincts, and dwellings.

This is the upper chapter of the Precious Scripture, transmitted only to those who have already attained perfection. Beginners cannot grasp its essentials. It is a secret of the Plain Numinous, not circulated in the world. Though one may master the Three Treasures and divine scriptures, plumbing their mysteries and subtleties, without the method of the Feminine True Unity, nothing shall be achieved. Thus, the Supreme Lord has marked it as a profound prohibition, forbidding its careless disclosure, and has not committed it to paper or ink. Those who possess it must first examine their innermost sincerity before receiving it.

On the first day of the year, the first day of the month, the day of the Great Year-Star, and one’s own birthday, bathe, purify, and fast. Enter the chamber, face east, and visualize the spirits of the Four Feminine Palaces’ True Unity—their precincts, dwellings, names, attire, colors, and heights—according to the method above. Upon completion, knock the teeth thirty-six times and recite the incantation:

*"Supreme Yin spirits, styled Feminine Numinous,
Transforming scenes of ninefold mystery, riding the true and concealed.
Daily they report to the Heavenly Mystery, announcing the fast to Supreme Clarity.
Heart’s念, eye’s gaze—penetrating, discerning spirit and form.
Returning to the palace, guarding the dwelling, jade splendor fills abundantly.
Five colors transform—flowing yellow, purple, azure—
Conveying flying clouds, ascending to the imperial court."*

After the incantation, swallow qi thirty-six times and cease.

Practicing thus for nine years, one’s face shall bloom with jade splendor, golden perfection reflecting light. The spirits shall manifest in bodily form, speaking with the adept. Once the spirits are seen and the heart knows itself, guard this knowledge carefully and do not transmit it recklessly.

These spirits of the Four Feminine Palaces’ True Unity are the primordial yin officials of heaven’s first generation, titled imperial consorts. Their primordial qi is unformed, the five governances unopened, their radiance and light uncommunicated. They are without limit, without void, without above, without below, without exterior, without interior, without left, without right, without front, without back. They are the primordial essence of the Supreme Lord, the wondrous perfection of the Mysterious Beginning, the prior of the Utmost Void. Condensing qi, they congeal, blending and transforming the myriad things. The preservation of heaven and earth depends entirely upon these Four Perfected.

Those who can visualize them with sincere devotion shall transcend a thousand ages in ignorance, dwelling within the prior heaven where the myriad spirits share their longevity.

Here ends the *Secret Formula of the Nine Palaces’ Morning Cultivation in the Great Cavern of Supreme Clarity*.
