### *The Supreme Numinous Treasure Pure Brightness Esoteric Methods, Fascicle One*

#### **Daily Incense-Burning and Ritual Practice**
Each day at the *zi* hour, begin by burning incense. Visualize the Daoist abbey facing west, with the ritual master standing eastward. Strike the teeth thirty-six times, then lower both hands and form the *yin* mudra. Release the mudra, withdraw the hands, and bow once—with each bow, visualize a radiance several *zhang* in diameter illuminating the face. Bow twice more, strike the teeth nine times, and recite the incantation:

*"Dao fragrance, virtue fragrance,
The fragrance of non-action, purity, and spontaneity,
The true fragrance of Numinous Treasure Pure Brightness—
Offered to the Six Sovereigns of the Pure Brightness Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthies,
All Numinous Treasure Lords, Emperor Lords, Heavenly Lords, and Divine Kings.
May the methods I practice swiftly fulfill my heart’s intent.
Above, repay the kindness of sovereign and parents;
Below, relieve the suffering of all beings.
May true *qi* ever fill my body,
And all the hundred spirits be commanded and submit.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law and command!"*

Upon completing the recitation, inhale *qi* once and swallow it.

#### **Talisman for Liberating the Six Kin**
**First Talisman:** To be used on the natal days of parents and the six kin. Inscribe with cinnabar, form the *yin* mudra, and visualize oneself as the Bright King of Filial Dao. Recite the incantation once. The talisman may be either swallowed or worn, while visualizing the Two Emperor Lords holding it and proceeding.

**Second Talisman:** To be used on the day of death for parents and the six kin. Inscribe with cinnabar, form the *mao* mudra, and visualize oneself as the Bright King of Filial Dao. Recite the incantation once, then burn the talisman to ash, mix with clay, and apply to the heart. By this method’s power, the deceased will naturally return to life. While mixing the clay, visualize the Two Emperor Lords holding the talisman to guide the departed.

These two talismans are not limited in number; burn one each day to accumulate merit for the living and the dead. The Two Emperor Lords will hold the talismans to either extend lifespan or deliver the departed—this is the root of filial Dao. Only after achieving merit in this practice may one refine the body’s form.

---

#### **Talisman for Refining the Body’s Form**
Form the *kan* mudra and inscribe with cinnabar. For the first two talismans, on a *jiazi* day, face east, recite the incantation while forming the mudra, and perform the method once each. Inscribe sixty talismans. Consuming one daily will naturally fill the body with true *qi*, granting immortality and the power to command ghosts and spirits. While inscribing, visualize oneself as the Bright King of Filial Dao and the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy, with the Two Emperor Lords standing to the left and right. Only after achieving merit in this may one proceed to the *Lingshu Sanxing* talisman.

---

#### **Talismans for Healing All Illnesses**
For the first two talismans, face north and recite the method once each, maintaining the prior visualization. Roll the talismans into pills, recite the incantation over water, and administer to the afflicted—they will recover. If recovery is not immediate, use the latter two talismans, applying them with focused intent, and the Straight Talisman Emperor Lords will naturally attend. With prolonged practice and many healings, spirits will respond to summons spontaneously.

When reciting the method and inscribing talismans, recite once without interruption. If pausing, recite again without limit to the number. When dispatching a talisman, recite once.

---

#### **Talisman for Binding the Hundred Demons**
For harm caused by altars or temples, face north to inscribe, recite the incantation five times, and draw a mouthful of true *qi* from each of the five directions. Form the Jade Emperor mudra to inscribe. While inscribing, visualize oneself as the Bright King of Filial Dao and the Pure Brightness Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy, with the Two Emperor Lords holding the straight talisman and the Four Saints escorting. Exercise caution in its use; do not employ it recklessly. Once this talisman proves efficacious, over time it need not be sent by a person—the Emperor Lords will wield it and proceed of their own accord.

---

#### **Talisman for Pacifying, Summoning, and Commanding**
When inscribing this talisman, recite the incantation and form the Jade Emperor mudra, drawing a mouthful of *qi* from each of the five directions.

**For summoning rain or snow:** Inscribe in cinnabar on an iron plate five *cun* in length and place it where dragons reside. To strike an object, place it atop for seven days, and it will arrive.

Before employing the *Lingshu Sanxing* talisman, adhere to this method. Once proficient in the *Sanxing* talisman, knowledge will come spontaneously. When dispatching a talisman, recite the incantation and draw *qi* from the talisman’s original abbey.

---

#### **The Primordial Net Flying Step Dharma Treasure Register**
On each *jiazi* day, face east, form the Jade Emperor mudra, and gaze toward the Dipper. Draw a mouthful of *qi* from the Northern Dipper, then another from the eastern direction. With eyes closed, inscribe sixty talismans, recite the incantation seven times, and say:

*"Controller of authority, remover of death’s register,
Eastern Ultimate, name inscribed for rebirth.
The treasure register may be worn or consumed,
Its use transcends the soul and spirit.
The numinous gates of heaven open,
Eyes closed, recite the true method.
Beyond the body lies my true self—
This is the pattern for transcending the mundane.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law and command!"*

Consume one talisman daily with enchanted water; wear the remainder in a blue pouch. On the nights of the Three Primes, Three Assemblies, *gengshen*, and *jiazi*, within a quiet chamber, wear the treasure register inscribed on the *jiazi* day. Form the *mao* mudra with both hands, close the eyes, still the mind, press the tongue to the upper palate, and swallow *qi* once. Perceive a body beyond the body, clad in garments identical to one’s own, standing before you. Ahead lies a star altar, nine *chi* and two *cun* in height, with the sun to the left and moon to the right, the Southern Dipper behind and Northern Dipper before. Flanked by Azure Dragon and White Tiger, fronted and backed by Vermilion Bird and Dark Warrior. Feel a lightness, as if floating, and proceed directly before the altar. Step the *ding* *gang* three times, ascend one tier, and circumambulate the altar to the left, reciting the incantation:

*"The immortal Dao is vast and boundless,
The home of the Primordial Beginning.
I ascend the altar,
Purifying the spirit and transforming thoughts."*

May the Most High bestow upon me the streaming rosy clouds.
The nectar of streaming rosy clouds,
Diffuses *qi* with fragrant radiance.
Having partaken of it,
I may tread the *gang* steps.
The spirit lords of the five viscera,
And the incense officials of the day’s straight hour,
Hearing my secret incantation,
Are each at peace.
Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances.

Upon reciting the incantation, hold the *qi* and enter the earthly gate.
Proceed leftward once more, and recite the incantation:

Supreme Great Luo,
Great Luo of Jade Purity.
The true persons of the Jade Purity Palace who transmit the Dharma,
Hearing my secret incantation,
Deliver my corporeal form.
Take that jade rosy cloud,
To purify my spirit.
Now I tread the *gang* steps,
Journeying to the imperial realm,
To ascend and pay homage to the Jade Emperor.
Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances.

After reciting the incantation, hold the *qi* and enter the heavenly gate, reaching the third tier of the altar.
Upon entering the heavenly gate, as if two immortals, jade lads and jade maidens, incense attendants, and messengers—six in all—appear.
Next, kneel lengthily with eyes closed, as if a divine being, riding a five-colored cloud and clad in Upper Clarity robes, transmits the Jade Emperor’s talisman, its golden script resplendent, calling forth your name.
Then, a lad bearing a jade goblet,
Within which is the nectar of jade rosy clouds.
From the Northern Dipper, a black *qi*;
From the Southern Dipper, a red *qi*;
From the sun, a crimson *qi*;
From the moon, a white radiance;
From the Three Terraces, a five-colored mixed *qi*—
Each flows into the cup.
If you can receive it, bow twice and drink.
Hold the *qi*, release the mudra, and descend the altar.
Recite the two sacred texts,
Ascending into the void as if reaching the heavens,
Flying into the Northern Dipper.
Pass beneath the Three Terraces’ stars,
Treading from the *Kui* star to the *Piao* return.
Enter the Dipper in six steps and exit,
Forming the shape of the Three Terraces,
Then emerge from the Dipper’s mouth.
Circle leftward seventy times, transgressing fire.
Proceed eastward, passing through □□,
Ninety-nine steps to reach the Great Yang,
To pay homage to the ancestral master, the Celestial Emperor.
Then turn right, entering the Western Dipper from the Northern Dipper,
Sixty-four steps to reach the Great Yin,
To pay homage to the ancestral master, the Immortal August Lord.
Turn right and exit,
Then proceed rightward, circling left—
Seven revolutions in all, forming a ring.
This is the realm of primordial color.
Fix your gaze, and behold within the formless realm
All the immortals coming to welcome you.
Thereupon, traverse the ten directions,
Paying homage to the thirty-two Celestial Emperors and the twenty-eight constellations.
Upon seeing each constellation,
Tread the *ding gang* twelve times,
Returning to life within the Dipper’s lodging,
Borrowing the *Ji* constellation’s guiding principle to proceed directly.
Gaze back toward the great *Piao* of the Northern Dipper,
Then circle rightward at the Mountain of Crossing Blades,
Facing south for forty-nine steps to pass,
Re-entering the Palace of the Fire Star.
Passing through the Great Yin,
After thirty-six steps,
Pay homage to the Water Star.
From the water, proceed eastward,
Counting sixty-four steps,
Then turn back, transgressing water.
Borrow the guiding principle to exit the palace,
Passing beside the Great Yin,
Eighty-one steps to complete the Metal Star.
Proceed delicately to the Dipper’s mouth,
Thirty-five steps to enter the Earthly Branch.
From earth, return,
Re-entering the lodgings of Metal, Water, and Wood.
Then gaze directly northward,
Where the golden towers stand majestic—
The abode of the Three Clarities’ Celestial Emperors.
Advance eight steps,
Kneel lengthily and bow twice.
Recite the incantation:

This humble earthbound servant, so-and-so,
By fortunate karmic affinity from past lives,
Has encountered a sagely master,
Who transmitted secret instructions,
Enabling me to pay homage at the celestial gates.
Concentrating the spirit and entering stillness,
The nine *qi* become limpid and bright,
The body beyond the body
Attains flight into the celestial precincts.
I, unworthy, gaze upon the heavens and revere the sagely,
Prostrating myself twice in homage.

Recite another incantation:

Fortunate to receive the mysterious favor,
I have encountered a sagely master.
At midnight, my spirit takes flight,
With wholehearted devotion to pay homage to the Emperor.
Yet this humble servant’s bones are coarse and stubborn,
Difficult to transcend and ascend.
With filial piety and sincerity,
I hope to receive grace.
Through earnest seeking,
I have gained the imperial regard.
May my Dao-heart become steadfast,
My spirit-thoughts pure and clear.
Commanding all spirits,
To fulfill the imperial decree.
I humbly beseech the celestial grace
To grant this servant’s petition.

Bow twice again in prostration,
Then exit the gate.
Behold your original form at the crown of your head.
Recite the incantation:

Serpent-cicada, serpent-cicada,
Shedding and departing the dust.
Now I pay homage to the true,
Ascending to meet the azure clouds.
May the divine beings
Seal and enclose my form.
Lift me away,
By the secret and efficacious instructions.

Suddenly, it enters through the crown of the head—
Only then is the treading of the *gang* complete.
For minor practices,
Three to five steps suffice.
To earnestly seek the method of flight and ascension,
Nothing surpasses this.
Now, the diagrams of the guiding principles for the yellow, white, and black paths
Are appended below.
