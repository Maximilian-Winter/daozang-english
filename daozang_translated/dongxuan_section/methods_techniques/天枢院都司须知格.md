One whose manifest virtues are illustrious.
One who cherishes life and abhors killing.
One who is compassionate, brave, gentle, and prudent.

Deceit, concealment, evil conduct, harboring secrets, obscurity, ignorance, actions unseen by humans or spirits, the Ten Evils, and the Five Heinous Crimes.

**Purple Court True Statutes (紫庭真律格):**
Unsullied and unstained—this is called *Purity* (洁).
Cautious and vigilant—this is called *Diligence* (勤).
Desiring yet not obtaining—this is called *True Desire* (真欲).
Coveting yet not obtaining—this is called *True Greed* (真贪).
To take what should not be taken, to steal what is not theft, to lust what is not lust, to rebel what is not rebellion, to invert compliance and defiance, to confuse good and evil, to repent and cultivate the Dao—this is called *Supreme Goodness* (上善).
Indulging emotions contrary to the Dao—this is called *Great Evil* (大恶).
To give life where it is not life, to kill where it is not killing, to conceal goodness as obstruction, to hide evil as deceit, to kill yet desire life—this is called *Cherishing Life* (好生).

**Purple Court True Statutes (continued):**
To see and desire another’s death—this is called *Cherishing Killing* (好杀).
Those who resent their parents must not live; even if they live, they may be put to death.
Thus, the truly filial do not die; the utmost filial attain immortality.
The Dao of immortality is easy; the path of death is hard.
The constancy of the good is genuine; the goodness of the wicked is false.
Good habits may turn one evil; evil is not inherently evil—reform makes it good.

**Azure Ghost True Statutes (鬼青真律格):**
To reveal sloth and receive the highest reward,
To conceal and yet incur manifest punishment—
This is called *Diligence in Goodness* (勤善), known as *Trustworthiness* (信).
To adorn faults with sincerity is called *Untrustworthiness* (不信).
Yin misfortune is great; yang misfortune is small.
That which arises in the heart yet remains concealed is a crime.
That which manifests outwardly while the heart feels shame may be forgiven.
Those who do not suppress others—yet are themselves unsuppressed—cannot follow the Dao.
Those who seize from others—yet are themselves seized from—may walk the Way.
