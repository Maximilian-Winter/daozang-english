**Preface to *The Orthodox Daoist Method of the Celestial Heart of Supreme Clarity***

Of old, Fuqiu, Wang, and Guo Chong—three sages who embodied the manifestations of the Three Clarities—first revealed their traces upon Huagai Peak, extending to the wondrous realms of Miaogao in the east and west of Jiangnan. Their sacred titles and auspicious signs were clearly transmitted in the *Jade Tablets*, and thus shall not be elaborated here. Their works brought blessings to the world, vast and beyond comprehension.

Later, in the *Book of the Great Clarity’s Subjugation of Demons*, they expounded this teaching precisely in the *jiawu* year of the Lower Epoch’s mortal era. During the reign of the Song Dynasty’s Chongxing Great Dao, on the fifteenth day of the eighth month in the fifth year of Chunhua, a colossal immortal in the flesh beheld upon the mountain’s summit five-colored radiance of precious light piercing the heavens. The following dawn, he traced the source of the light to the ethereal altar of the Three Clarities. There, he dug three feet deep and unearthed a golden casket. Upon opening it, he discovered a set of golden tablets inscribed with jade script—a secret formula of the Celestial Heart, titled *The Orthodox Method*.

Reverent indeed! This *Orthodox Method* is the heart-guard of the Jade Emperor, the true scripture of the Great Clarity, the wondrous Dharma of the Most High, and the numinous writings of the Three Caverns, together forming the fourfold register of scriptures. These are the *Dongxuan*, *Dongshen*, and *Dongzhen* Lingbao texts, originating from the natural inception of the Dao and virtue.

The great adept was the lay scholar Rao, styled Dongtian. Though he obtained the secret texts, he did not yet grasp the essentials of their jade protocols and ritual applications. He then encountered a divine being who directed him to seek instruction from Master Tan, styled Zixiao. From Zixiao, he received the Dao. Zixiao further instructed him to visit the Heavenly Equal Benevolent Sage Emperor of Mount Tai, where he obtained the Perfect Wondrous Jade and petitioned for the aid of yin soldiers.

The great adept became the first patriarch of the Celestial Heart, titled *Orthodox Method Meritorious Minister, Daily Attendant of the Northern Culmen, and Commander of the Demon-Quelling Court*. At his ascension, he transmitted the method to his disciple Zhu Jianguan, styled Zhongsu. Zhongsu then passed it to You Daoshou, who in turn transmitted it to the *Tongzhi Lang* Zou Ze. Zou Ze conveyed it to my own master of talismanic methods, Master Tianxin, and thus it has been transmitted to me, Yougong, to the present day.

Now, Huagai Peak is the ethereal realm of the Three Clarities’ manifestation, where only the Numinous Altar of the Primordial Sovereign exists, devoid of Daoist dwellings. Thus, the name of Huagai was unknown to the people of the time. Here, I present the general origins of the scriptural register.

In the twenty-fifth year of King Zhao of Zhou, on the twenty-eighth day of the twelfth month at noon, the Old Lord transmitted the *Dao* and *Virtue* scriptures to Guan Yin, along with the *Great Clarity’s Nine Elixirs*, the *Hidden Writings of the Eight Heavens*, and the *Western Ascension’s Admonitions*. Yin passed them to the Perfected Du, who then transmitted them to the Lesser Perfected Yin—this marks the natural inception of the Dao and virtue.

By the second year of Guanghe in the Han Dynasty, the Supreme Pole Perfected Xu, on Mount Tiantai, transmitted the *Lingbao* scriptures to the Left Immortal of the Supreme Pole, Weng the Perfected. These are the ancestral texts of the *Dongxuan* and *Dongshen* registers.

Later, in the first year of Han’an during the reign of Emperor Shun of the Later Han, on the first day of the fifth month, the Old Lord descended upon Mount Heming and bestowed upon Heavenly Master Zhang the twenty-four secret registers, seals, and other talismans. At the Jade Bureau Abbey, he transmitted the methods for prolonging life and beheading demons—these are the foundation of the *Zhengyi* Alliance of Might.

From the Zhou, Qin, Han, and Wei dynasties onward, though the Three Scriptures were transmitted in the world, their regulations and ranks remained obscure. In the second year of Xingning during the reign of Emperor Ai of Jin, on the *jiazi* day of the first month—the Day of the First Farmer—the Purple Void Primordial Sovereign, the Lady of Southern Marchmount, first revealed the celestial circumstances to Yang the Perfected, the Eastern Flower’s Assistant Director of Destinies. At that time, the celestial scriptures and precious texts were written in cloud scripts, dragon seal scripts, and the eightfold assembly of characters—beyond the comprehension of the mortal world.

The Perfected One possessed separate talismanic texts and scriptural essentials, which he transformed into clerical script. From then on, their transmission flourished, becoming the origin of the *Shangqing* tradition.

Our *Orthodox Method* alone emerged during the flourishing era of the Great Song. On this mountain, the immortal traces of Qiaoxian Abbey remain evident. Alas! Without the right person, the lineage’s essence gradually faded. I, who uphold this teaching in its latter days, have presumptuously taken up its principles. Grieving the decline of the Dharma, I earnestly received my master’s instructions and personally inherited the secret essentials and talismanic writings of the Fourfold Register of the Most High. How could I dare not refine my thoughts and mobilize my spirit, lest I betray the former sages?

Thus, I have meticulously edited the wondrous Dao I received, compiling *The Orthodox Daoist Method of the Celestial Heart* into two fascicles, upper and lower, still in summary form. The talismans and incantations used by contemporary ritual masters are all those of the Northern Emperor, which I have separately compiled into three fascicles, titled *Talismanic Writings of the Northern Emperor*. These exist outside the *Orthodox Method*, along with the secret registers and charts for cultivating the Three Caverns and Fourfold Registers.

For those who transmit the teachings and cultivate the Dao, the registers they bestow shall deliver and liberate the living, guiding all to return to the Great Dao.

**Fascicle One of *The Orthodox Daoist Method of the Celestial Heart of Supreme Clarity***

The Three Radiant Qi of the Pristine Essence

The Three Radiants are the sun, moon, and stars.

**Solar Qi**
The Solar Lord’s qi is rooted in its essence. When drawing solar qi, one must face its direction. Visualize the solar orb, its radiance like crimson flame.

**Lunar Qi**
The Lunar Lord’s qi is derived from the sun. The sun’s position advances daily at *mao* (5–7 a.m.), shifting between the two palaces every five days. For example, on the first day of the lunar month, begin at *mao* (east), with noon (*wu*) directly at *wu* (south). The second day follows the same pattern. On the third day, after noon, the position retrogrades past *yin* (3–5 a.m.); thus, at noon, begin at *yin* (east-northeast), and when *mao* (east) reaches *si* (south-southeast), noon corresponds to the moon’s presence in *si*. Visualize the lunar palace, its radiance like warm jade or silver.

**Celestial Stem Qi**
The Celestial Stem Star lies approximately three *zhang* from the handle of the Dipper. As the verse states:
*"Each month it ever rests at *xu*,
At every hour, *Po Jun* appears.
To know its true location,
Face or turn—ask the primal cause."*

When the lunar phase has passed the general, apply *xu*; if not yet passed, apply *xuan*. Count the hours to determine the moment for drawing qi, which is where the Celestial Stem establishes *Po Jun*. "Facing or turning" refers to the visualization of yin and yang days.

On yang days, the Celestial Stem moves forward. Visualize its face like blazing fire, clad in a robe of red silk, with three-colored qi—azure, yellow, and red—crowning its head. Its mouth emits flames ten thousand *zhang* long. With the left hand, form the Celestial Stem’s Demon-Slaying Seal (the *Ju Xie* mudra). In the right hand, it holds a precious pearl, which it draws back into its mouth along with the qi. As you visualize, the firelight becomes fine as thread or mist, shimmering with sound, bathing your body.

On yin days, the Celestial Stem moves in reverse. Visualize its face like warm jade, clad in plain silk, with three-colored qi—azure, red, and yellow—rising from its crown. Its mouth emits silver light ten thousand *zhang* long, fine as thread, shimmering with sound. The left hand forms the seal at the waist, while the right wields the Sword of Samādhi Fire. Upon completion, draw the qi into the mouth and employ it as needed. Adhere to this method without fail; do not disclose it lightly. Exercise caution.

**Invoking and Absorbing Solar Qi**
When the sun has risen three *zhang* high, determine its directional position. Face the sun, burn incense, and bow nine times in silence, reciting:
*"Your servant [Name] humbly petitions the Solar Lord, the August Emperor of the Sun, and the divine immortals of the Solar Palace to bestow the radiant true qi of *Yao Guang*, infusing it into my body."*

Next, press the *mao* mudra and silently recite the Solar Lord’s esoteric name, *Yu Yi*, nine times. Upon visualizing the true qi, silently recite the Solar Lord’s Seven Slaying Incantation:
*"Om va [ ] ra [ ] [ ] li svāhā."* (Once.)

**Absorbing Lunar Qi**
When the moon has risen three *zhang* high, determine its directional position. Face the moon, burn incense, and bow nine times in silence, reciting:
*"Your servant [Name] humbly petitions the August Sovereign of the Lunar Palace, the divine immortals of the Lunar Mansion, to bestow the radiant true qi of *Yao Guang*, infusing it into my body."*

Next, press the *you* mudra and silently recite the Lunar Lord’s esoteric name, *Jie Lin*, nine times. Upon visualizing the true qi, silently recite the Lunar Lord’s Seven Slaying Incantation for the Self:
*"Om va miṃ ra jī ra svāha saha."* (Once.)

Inhale the white qi through the nose, swallowing once every nine breaths. Repeat this nine times, ingesting nine mouthfuls of qi. Upon completion, bow in silent gratitude and withdraw.

**Invoking and Absorbing Celestial Stem Qi**
When the sun has risen three *zhang* high, determine the position of the Celestial Stem. Burn incense, press the *chen* mudra, and silently recite the incantation:
*"Spirit of the sun, spirit of the moon, conjoined beneath the Dipper.
The true qi of the Celestial Stem descends to bathe my form.
Expel the perverse, embrace the upright; eternally preserve long life.
Hasten, hasten, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!"* (Thrice.)

Visualize the Celestial Stem, bow nine times in silence, and recite:
*"Your servant [Name] humbly petitions the Great Sage of the Celestial Stem, the Star Lord *Po Jun*, to bestow the radiant true qi of *Yao Guang*, infusing it into my body—heart, five viscera, six bowels, three hundred sixty bones, and eighty-four thousand pores—driving out pathogenic qi and demonic qi."*

Recite the incantation:
*"Yearly calamities, monthly misfortunes, daily disasters, hourly afflictions—
Expel the perverse, banish the foul.
All spirits aid me, my body enters the *Kui Gang*.
Humans take refuge, demons submit.
Hasten, hasten, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!"* (Once.)

Blow upon the left *chen* mudra, form the Sword Mudra with the right hand, and recite the Celestial Stem’s True Qi Incantation:
*"Heavenly Emperor’s sacred decree, girded with the Celestial Stem—
Why do the malevolent ghosts of the five directions not perish?
With a single inhalation of radiant light, ten thousand demons cower in hiding.
Great Sage of the Celestial Stem, slay into the heart of ghosts.
Hasten, hasten, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!"* (Thrice.)

Inhale and swallow the qi three times. Then recite the Celestial Stem’s esoteric name, *Fei Xian*, three times, and draw in three more mouthfuls of qi. Next, silently recite the hidden incantation:
*"Om hūṃ hūṃ nuṃ ta li svāhā."*
Draw in three more mouthfuls of qi, totaling nine. Bow nine times in gratitude and withdraw.

**Concluding Remarks**
If a ritual master can invoke the qi of the Three Lights without negligence day or night, their merit will be perfected in a thousand days. Their complexion will flourish, their body will grow robust and light, and they will be spared from all ailments. Should they persist without weariness for a lifetime, their attainment of immortality and divine power will be beyond description. Even if they only cultivate this for a thousand days, when treating illness, they need not calculate directions or engage in visualization—merely a single thought to project qi, blown upon the afflicted, will naturally restore health, subdue all malevolent forces, and command reverence.

**Treating Illness and Deploying Talismans**
When relieving the suffering of the people, expelling perverse influences, or treating illness, first accept the petition and affix the seal. Then, before the divine generals, pray and invoke the officers. Instruct the afflicted’s household to prepare incense and await your arrival. If the possessing spirit is stubborn, transform your steps into the *Gang* pace. Begin by casting a distant net from the altar, commanding it to enclose the demonic entity. Then dispatch several divine generals, leading spirit soldiers to apprehend it. Only then may you depart. As you leave the altar, strike the table thrice, form the Jade Purity Mudra with both hands, and chant the syllable *ti* seven times, visualizing all divine officers gathered before you. Lead them forth, and upon nearing the afflicted’s home, dismount.

Once the net is cast and commands issued, grasp the Demon-Seizing Mudra with the left hand and the Sword Mudra with the right. Face north, inhale a mouthful of qi, and recite the incantation:
*"I summon the Four Saints to swiftly seize the general—urgently!
Go forth for me, seize the perverse ghost, and let none escape.
Swiftly, swiftly!"*

Form the mudra, visualize the Four Divine Generals leading troops to apprehend the demonic spirit, and blow the mudra toward them. Upon reaching the afflicted’s doorstep, stand in the *ding* stance, press the appropriate mudra, and silently recite:
*"Open the Gate of Heaven—*hai* mudra.
Seal the Door of Earth—*si* mudra.
Leave the Human Gate—*shen* mudra.
Block the Demon’s Path—*yin* mudra.
Lay the Golden Beam horizontally, raise the Jade Pillar vertically—
From *chen* to *sha*.
Gather the *Gang* qi—*chen* mudra.
Press the Dipper Mudra.
Seal with the Dipper Seal.
All spirits conceal themselves, ten thousand demons perish.
Hasten, hasten, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!"*

Next, trace the Dipper, cover your head to conceal your body, and recite while gathering with your hands:
*"Greed, Vastness, Prosperity, Literature, Valor, Destruction—on the left.
[...]—on the right."*

Form the *Tianding* mudra with both hands, pressing the index fingers to the base of the thumbs and the thumbs to the sides of the middle fingers. Visualize the Orthodox Unity Perfected One standing before you.

Next, invoke in meditation:
To my left stands the Azure Emperor of the East, girded with a sword;
To my right stands the White Emperor of the West, girded with a sword;
Before me stands the Vermilion Emperor of the South, girded with a sword;
Behind me stands the Black Emperor of the North, girded with a sword.

Then visualize the divine generals, officers, and soldiers of the courtyard arrayed in formation, encircling you.

If the malevolent spirit is fierce and hurls bricks or stones, reinforce your protection with this incantation:
*"I humbly invoke the Moon Prince of the West,
Dispatch the Five Lords of Iron and the Great Sage Canxian to my side.
By the decree of the Northern Emperor—
Hasten, hasten, swiftly, swiftly!"*

Face west and visualize the Moon Prince’s attendants: five hundred Daoist adepts in white robes, wearing iron crowns and wielding swords. Recite the incantation thrice, draw *qi* three times, and blow it to your left and right.

Then recite:
*"Spirits of the Northern Dipper, shield and protect my body.
Hasten, hasten, by statute and ordinance!"*

Visualize the Northern Dipper hovering above your head—thus, no evil dare assail you.

Next, enter the afflicted’s home. With the *killing* mudra in your left hand and the *sword* mudra in your right, knock on the door three times. Command the door gods to bar all passage to ghosts and malevolent spirits—swiftly, swiftly!

At the door of the patient’s chamber, instruct the patient to prepare incense and tea. Then, step the *Gang* and conceal yourself within the Dipper’s curve. Silently summon the generals, issue commands, and order the local earth god to seize the malevolent spirit. Burn talismans to fumigate the patient’s body. If talismans are not burned, proceed at will to capture the spirit.

The ritual master inhales the patient’s *qi*, then draws a mouthful of water and sprays it onto the patient’s body. Form the *exorcism* mudra with the left hand and the *sword* mudra with the right at the patient’s side. Instruct the patient to close their eyes while fumigating their hands with incense and shouting the command. If the malevolent spirit is male, it will tremble on the left; if female, on the right. If it is a ghost, it will tremble.

*"By the decree of the Supreme Emperor,
Thus performed, the malevolent spirit shall be bound and expelled!"*

Prepare talismanic water and the like for the patient to ingest. Then, recite the purification incantation to cleanse the body. The ritual master closes their eyes, forms the *thunder* mudra thrice to the left and right, and recites the *Dutian Great Thunder Lord* incantation once. Inhale the crimson-red *thunder qi* from the southeast, blow it forth, and visualize it transforming into the flashing lightning of the Five Thunders.

Strike with the *thunder* mudra, visualizing a thunderclap shattering the patient’s home, transmuting it into a divine abode with golden steps and jade halls, its inhabitants all transformed into immortals. Only then may you depart the patient’s home. The efficacy of this method is profound—guard it as a secret.

*Here ends the first scroll of the Orthodox Heavenly Heart True Method.
The second scroll of the Orthodox Heavenly Heart True Method.*

**The Great Transformation of the Divine Spirit Method**

When a ritual master’s practice has not yet spanned many years, how can they achieve union with the divine? They must master the method of refining and transforming the spirit to attain a majestic presence. Generally, those who perform rituals can only alter their spirit through two mudras, but they cannot achieve the great inner transformation. Here, this method is transmitted in full—follow it precisely, and you will never err.

When a ritual master wishes to perform a ritual, they must first pass their hands over the incense, then wield the sword with the left hand at *mao* and the right at *you*. Recite the *Purification of Heaven and Earth* incantation three times, inhale the eastern *qi*, and blow it upon their body to purify it. Next, visualize their body as a withered tree. Then, form the *wu* mudra with the left hand and the *dou* mudra with the right. Clasp the waist, and with the left *wu* mudra, draw the fire of the heart upward from before the heart to the crown. Inhale the southern *qi* and blow it upon the left, visualizing the fire burning the body until it radiates with luminous purity.

Form the mudra with the left hand, and with the right *zi* mudra, draw the Yellow River’s water from the kidneys, guiding it upward to bathe the entire body. Inhale the northern water *qi* and blow it upon the right, visualizing all ashes and impurities washed away. Only the true *qi* remains, gleaming like a luminous pearl, gradually growing brighter. With both hands in the *dou* mudra, recite the *Great Transformation of the Spirit* incantation:

*"I am no mortal body—
My head is like dark clouds,
My hair like scattered stars,
My left eye like the sun,
My right eye like the moon,
My nose like a fire bell,
My ears like golden bells,
My upper lip the Rain Master,
My lower lip the Wind Earl?
My teeth like a forest of swords,
My ten fingers like hooks.
The Merit Officer guards my left side,
The Lord of Min Mountain commands my right.
The Lord of Lu Mountain guards my left foot,
The Left Thunder General guards my right foot.
The Right Thunder General commands my spine,
The Thirty-Six Beasts of Mount Tai and the Twenty-Eight Constellations all respond to my body.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the law!"*

Recite this three times, inhale the northern *qi*, and with both hands in the *dou* mudra, raise them from before the heart to the forehead. Spread the *dou* mudra outward to the left and right, visualizing the self gradually taking the form of an infant, encircled by a sphere of red light, as if seated within a wheel. If the form grows too large, again use both hands in the *dou* mudra, moving them three steps forward from the chest, and recite the incantation:

*"By the command of the Northern Emperor, protect the wheel,
By the reverence of the Northern Emperor, treasure the wheel."*

Recite this three times, then split the *dou* mudra apart before the face, shattering the luminous halo. Visualize the self as the Heavenly Master or the True Warrior of Tianpeng, as desired. The red halo transforms into a radiant aura, enveloping the body. Conclude by knocking the teeth together as prescribed, and proceed with the ritual as needed.

**Stepping the Stars and Walking the Rites**

The method of stepping the stars (*bu gang*) values the power of visualization. As the ancients said: *"The steps of the feet are not as potent as the steps of the hands; the steps of the hands are not as potent as the steps of the heart."* Thus, one must concentrate on the true *qi* of each star and its radiant essence. When the visualization is true, the essence of the Dipper descends to witness the ritual master’s practice. Therefore, when performing rites within the *Kui* and *Cheng* constellations, all ghosts and spirits will submit without exception. The divine generals will heed your commands, and ghosts and spirits will obey your authority.

If one fails to visualize the true *qi* or conceal the Three Hun, it is called *"stepping the stars with an empty corpse"*—not only will the ritual’s power fail, but one may also incur the offense of trampling the sacred. This must be carefully heeded.

When stepping the stars, form the *dou* mudra with both hands, clasp the waist, and recite the *Concealing the Hun* incantation:

*"Three Hun youths,
Seven Po generals,
Follow my steps through the stars,
Pass through the heavenly gates,
Let none err.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the law!"*

Recite this three times, then with both hands in the *dou* mudra, visualize the Three Hun entering beneath the ribs. Recite again:

*"I receive the Heart Treasure Seal of the Heavenly Master,
Wear it naturally,
Ascending from the dark netherworld to the celestial grotto-heavens.
I walk the Yu Steps, attain the Dao, and ascend as an immortal.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the law!"*

Recite this three times, then with both hands in the *dou* mudra, insert them beneath the ribs to conceal the Three Hun. The ritual master visualizes their ancestral master performing the rites before them. The Great Emperor of the Purple Tenuity of the North Star arrives upon purple clouds, leading the Thirty-Six Great Generals, including Tianpeng, to perform the rites with valor. They ride upon purple clouds, covering the ritual master’s body. Visualize the local earth gods and their troops encircling the ritual master.

Next, form the *yu* mudra with the left hand and the sword mudra with the right, clasp the waist, and step the stars, beginning with the *Three Terraces* (*Santai*):

Recite the incantation:

*"First Terrace, one yellow—yellow *qi*,
Dispels misfortune.
Second Terrace, two white—white *qi*,
Protects the body and secures the home.
Third Terrace, three green—green *qi*,
Cures illness and expels spirits.
Where the Terrace Stars arrive,
Great power is bestowed.
Cure illness, avert calamity,
Turn death into life.
Where the celestial talismans reach,
Evil spirits are forever severed.
The true *qi* descends,
Power and efficacy are fulfilled.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the law!"*

Next, step the *Seven Stars* (*Qixing*) and recite the incantation:

*"Mysterious Northern Dipper,
The handle’s foremost star—
Greedy Wolf wields malice,
Black *qi*,
Devours ghosts and consumes spirits.
Mighty Gate shines fiercely,
Black *qi*,
Illuminating the path to clarity.
Wealth Star races through mist,
Green *qi*,
Commands the heavenly troops.
Cloud-Soaring Literary Star,
Green *qi*,
Shines upon the Upright and Chaste.
Green and red *qi*—
Martial Star of power,
The Perfected One’s assisting star.
Red *qi*—
The Great Sage of the Celestial Stem,
The Venerable Star of the Breaking Army.
Fire *qi*—
The Four Heavens are sealed,
Impure *qi* flees in haste.
Wielding axes and halberds,
Grasping the Heavenly Soldiers.
With one inhalation from the south,
Gallbladders shatter, hearts tremble.
The Spirit Lords patrol and inspect,
Listening and seeking out sounds.
The Earth Gods of the Nine Provinces,
Each is called by name.
Execute the wicked,
Protect the innocent—no light offense.
The wicked die,
The kind live.
Heads severed, limbs broken,
Bodies crushed to dust.
Ghosts and demons are swept away,
Humanity rests in peace.
Cure illness, avert calamity,
Where the talisman arrives, obey.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the law!"*

Recite again:

The Five are the Heavenly Eye and Heavenly Appearance,
Pursuing the gaze like thunder and lightning.
Its radiance terrifies the Eight Extremes,
Piercing through inner and outer—nothing does not submit.

Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the law!

When the incantation is complete, proceed in order with silent memorials. Strike the teeth thrice, then act as you will.

This method steps through both the Yin and Yang Dippers, arriving at the *Gang* Star to extract it. Do not immediately turn and retreat; first stand firm. Recite the prayer:

Great Sun Sovereign of the Solar Palace,
Great Lunar Monarch of the Lunar Mansion,
Nine August Emperors of the Northern Dipper,
Star Lords of the Three Terraces and Canopy,
All divine immortals and spirit officials within the Dipper—
I humbly beseech the Perfected Ones to incline toward this great creation.
May you deign to send down the luminous true *qi* of *Yaoguang*,
Infusing my body, heart, and five viscera.
Let me gaze upon evil so that evil collapses,
Gaze upon ghosts so that ghosts perish.
Where commands are issued and upheld,
Swift resonance is attained, the Six Dippers acting as one.

Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the law!

Draw in the *qi* of the Three Lights, combine them, and swallow thrice. Then turn and retreat, returning to the Dipper’s mouth. Stand and recite the Dipper’s Mouth incantation, silently memorializing the Heavenly Gate. To exit the *Gang*, recite the *Gang*-Welcoming Dipper-Exiting incantation:

The Five Phases spur one another,
The *Gang* Sword wields might.
The Six *Jia* assist me,
The Three Terraces ward off wrong.
Heaven revolves, earth turns,
Yin and Yang part.
Attaining life and transcending the world,
Sun and moon shine together.

Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the law!

Upon reciting "Heaven revolves, earth turns," turn your body and exit the Dipper. With both hands, form the Two Dippers’ seal, lifting the *Gang* of the Dipper to enshroud yourself. Lest others tread upon defilement, take strict heed.

**Distant Enshrouding Method**
Above, spread the Heavenly Net to seize mountain specters;
Below, lay the Earthly Web to capture ghostly thieves.
In the four directions and eight bounds,
Deploy troops and array formations.
Seize and capture wayward ghosts—
Let none dare escape or slip through.
They must be apprehended;
No disobedience shall be tolerated.

Swiftly, swiftly, I invoke the Emperor’s decree!

Recite thrice, hands crossed, inhale a mouthful of northern *qi*, and cast it forth as if casting a net. Visualize the divine generals enshrouding all. Another method is called the *Black Wind Universal Heavenly Enshroud*: with both hands, trace the killing script, draw in the northern *qi*, and blow it forth.

The method stirs heaven and earth,
Commands thunder and lightning,
Deploys officers and soldiers,
Shifts mountains and peaks,
Enshrouds ghosts and spirits.
I enact the true law,
Delivering the people from suffering.
If I send you to heaven, ascend straight to the Heavenly Palace.
If I dispatch you to water, descend directly to the Watery Palace.
Within the vast expanse of heaven and earth,
Corresponding to the Six Harmonies above—
You must apprehend the ghosts that bring calamity,
Seize and bind them before the altar,
Interrogate and record their names.

Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the law!

With the left hand in the *Du Jian* seal and the right in the sword seal, inhale three mouthfuls of *qi* from the Heavenly Gate, recite the incantation thrice, and blow it toward the distance. Visualize the black *qi* of the north, dense and swirling, enshrouding all under heaven. Inhale another mouthful of *Gang* *qi* and blow it forth, then shout:

Divine generals, firmly enshroud the ghosts and spirits!

Swiftly!

The Fire-Enshrouding Dharma Name

For celestial marches, terrestrial marches, aquatic marches, and this court’s marches—
Left and right arrayed in formation, encircling all within the vast expanse,
Sealed tight within and without, no leakage permitted—
Swiftly, enshroud with fire!

Swiftly, swiftly, by the decree of the Northern Emperor!

With both hands in the *Wu* seal, recite the incantation once.
First inhale a mouthful of *qi* from the north, then a mouthful from the south.
Blow it forth with the seal.
Visualize the celestial net and earthly snare ablaze, flames surging skyward, sealing all tightly.

Perform thus for three incantations, three breaths, three blows, then shout:
Great General of the Southern Fire Chariot, swiftly dispatch ten thousand fire chariots to enshroud the ghosts and spirits!

Swiftly!

The Proximate Enshrouding Dharma
When the celestial net is cast, it spreads densely in all directions—ghosts cannot escape their forms.
Divine generals, descend swiftly to enshroud the ghosts and spirits!

Swiftly!

Cross both hands, recite the incantation thrice, inhale three mouthfuls of northern *qi*, and cast it forth with the seal.
Visualize the net’s form, envision an iron shroud sealing the household.
Shout:
Divine generals, firmly enshroud the ghosts and spirits!
Let none enter from without, none escape from within.
Deploy troops in formation to guard all eight directions!

Swiftly, swiftly!

The Supreme True General Incantation Dharma
The True Dharma of the Heavenly Heart aids the upright and expels the perverse,
Upholds the imperiled and restores the fallen, delivers the dead and saves the living.
Dispels misfortune and rescues from calamity, serves the state and the people.

Unobstructed and limitless, most divine and sagely.
Gathering *qi* and assembling spirits, penetrating the hidden and reaching the nether realms.
Supremely mysterious and wondrous, most sagely and numinous, commanding all spirits.

Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the law!

*Shangqing Tianxin Zhengfa*, Scroll Three begins.

The Three Talismans of the Orthodox Dharma

Whenever inscribing talismans, first purify the heart and settle the mind, circulate the spirit and deploy qi. Visualize thunderfire scorching the body, transforming the self into the Heavenly Master. Atop the head stands the Vermilion Bird; beneath the feet treads the Eight Trigrams Spirit Turtle. To the left coils the Azure Dragon; to the right crouches the White Tiger. On either side stand youths robed in azure, skirts of vermilion, bearing the seal. Before you stands the Direct Attendant with sword in hand; behind you ranks the Tiger’s Might army, each wielding halberd and axe in guard. Once this visualization is complete, next envision the Transmission Master before you and the Patriarchal Master behind, leading the Heavenly Mugwort Marshal and the thirty-six Heavenly Generals below in attendance.

When inscribing talismans, silently memorialize the Supreme Emperor, invoking the officers within the talisman. Once the prayer and inscription are complete, employ the seal mudra to summon the Six Ding and Six Jia, the Merit Officers and Attendants, who stand guard before and behind. Then recite the incantation:

*"Yang spirits of the Six Jia, come attend at my left, guard the inscription of this talisman.
Yin spirits of the Six Ding, come attend at my right, guard the inscription of this talisman.
Four Direct Merit Officers, come attend before me, guard the inscription of this talisman.
Hasten! As the statutes and decrees command."*

Once the spirits are visualized as assembled, glare fiercely at the vermilion inkstone and recite:

*"Yang essence shines bright, yin ghosts must wither.
Divine vermilion blazes, primordial dew from the Great Subtlety.
Seven qi form ashes, five qi form a terrace.
All hundred evils perish, myriad demons are crushed.
Hasten! As the statutes and decrees command."*

Draw in the qi of the Dipper’s handle and blow it into the vermilion inkstone. Then pass the cinnabar brush over the incense, reciting the following incantation. If holding the brush, tap it thrice and pass it over the incense to fumigate. Visualize it as a divine sword, its blade and edge resplendent. Then recite the General Incantation for the Brush:

*"The sun’s light shines fully, yin ghosts must wither.
Divine vermilion dazzles the eye, nine rosy clouds from the Great Subtlety.
By my command, all myriad ghosts are crushed.
Seven qi form fire, three qi form a terrace.
Two stars shine together, the talisman speeds to pursue.
The brush is a divine sword, the ink a halberd.
By brushwork, illness is cured, all myriad ghosts submit and hide.
Hasten! As the statutes and decrees command."*

Draw in the Dipper’s qi and blow it into the vermilion ink. Then pass the ink stick over the incense and recite:

*"Divine ink, numinous and bright, true essence of the moon.
Inscribe talismans to bind ghosts, evil spirits obliterate their forms.
When the afflicted wear and swallow it, they forever preserve peace and tranquility.
Hasten! As the statutes and decrees command."*

Draw in the Dipper’s qi and blow it onto the ink. Then tap the brush thrice and pass it over the incense, reciting:

*"The brush is a sharp blade, the ink a hundred medicines.
Evil spirits are severed, all hundred specters cast down.
Divine brush, numinous and bright, inscribe talismans to dispatch spirits.
Summon the officers, and the officers arrive; summon the attendants, and the attendants act.
Point to a person, and they live; point to a ghost, and it perishes.
Consign them beneath my Mighty Dipper, ten thousand fathoms into the earth, never to move or act.
Hasten! As the statutes and decrees command.*

*Divine ink, numinous and bright, alters death to life.
With one stroke of the divine brush, all myriad ghosts obliterate their forms.
Hasten! As the Supreme Emperor’s statutes and decrees command."*

Once the incantations for the vermilion ink, brush, and ink are complete, form the Dipper mudra with the left hand and raise the inkstone water over the incense, reciting:

*"Four Brightnesses open and shine, heaven and earth endure.
Three luminaries’ divine water dispels misfortune.
Twin stars guard and stabilize, seven numina communicate their light.
Inscribe talismans to slay ghosts, subdue them beneath my Mighty Dipper.
Evil ghosts submit as guests, all myriad qi harmonize in well-being.
The Most High Lord Lao taught me to slay ghosts, bestowing upon me this divine method.
Above, I call to the Jade Maidens to gather and restrain misfortune.
Ascend as immortals, contract with the Dao, wear and bear the seal.
Hasten! As the Supreme Emperor decrees."*

Next, clasp the Purple Tenuity Seal in the left hand and hold the ink in the right, transforming the self into the Heavenly Master. Grind the ink with the right hand forty-nine turns, then with the left hand forty-two turns. The twelve earthly branches, twenty-eight lunar lodges, sun and moon—turn the right hand seven times. [Text incomplete.]

Draw twice the qi of the yin-yang Dipper stars and blow it into the inkstone. Next, pass the brush over incense, then recite the *Heavenly Emperor’s Mantra of Release* to draw the Dipper’s qi into the brush and inscribe the talisman. **Talisman of the Upright Qi of the Three Luminaries**

Hold the brush with the left Dipper Seal and grasp the brush in the right hand.

The Heavenly Official of the Upper Prime slays spirits,
The Earthly Official of the Middle Prime slays ghosts,
The Water Official of the Lower Prime slays essences.

Draw one breath of qi from the Gate of Heaven and blow it onto the brush, tapping it thrice. Recite the incantation:

I invoke the Great Sage of the Celestial Dipper,
The Venerable Stars of the Northern Dipper,
The Lord of the Sun of Great Yang,
The Lady of the Moon of Great Yin.
Exterminate the fierce and evil,
Erase their traces, dissolve their forms.
Demon kings tremble in fear,
Their gall shatters, their hearts collapse.
Deliver the people from suffering,
Bestow mighty numinous power.
Heal illness, avert calamity,
Reverse death and restore life.
Where the celestial talisman arrives,
All demonic essences are forever severed.
Descend with true qi,
Let sacred might be executed.

Swiftly, swiftly, as the Celestial Emperor decrees!

Draw the radiance of the Three Luminaries and blow it into the talisman. Form the Dipper Mudra and face the sun. Recite the incantation:

The sun rises in the east,
Red and majestic in splendor.
Let [so-and-so] ingest this talisman,
The talisman guards the four directions.
When the divine talisman enters the belly,
It scours the stomach and purges the intestines.
All ailments are cured,
Bones and body grow strong.
A thousand ghosts and ten thousand spirits
Dare not withstand it.
Know the talisman as divine,
Know the Dao as true.

Swiftly, swiftly, as the statutes command!

**Incantation for Dispatching the Talisman**

Today’s Merit Scribes, Generals, and Officers,
Bear the talisman and proceed.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the statutes command!

**Incantation for Swallowing the Round Talisman**
Today’s sun,
The talisman guards my spirit.

Illness finds peace and health.
The divine talisman enters the belly,
Dispelling all afflictions and misfortunes.
Within the five viscera,
Ghostly *qi* vanishes.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the statutes command!

**Black Warrior of the Dark Sovereign Talisman**
Whenever writing this talisman, transform into the Dark Sovereign of the North, the Six *Jia* of the Great Tenuity, the Black Warrior of the Five *Qi*, the Great General of the Primordial Heaven’s Winged Sage.
A hundred feet tall, hair unbound and standing erect,
Feet treading upon the sacred tortoise of the Five *Qi*,
Also called the Soaring Serpent, the Eight Trigrams’ numinous tortoise.
Hands form the Demon-Subduing Seal—
The True Martial Seal.
Eyes emit lightning,
Standing with sword in hand.
The inkstone transforms into dragons and serpents,
The ink into spears of war,
The brush into the Seven-Star Precious Sword.
Then recite the incantation to consecrate the cinnabar brush and grind the ink as before, and write the talisman.

**Incantation:**
Black Warrior’s talismanic envoys,
Greatly display your numinous power.
Relieve the people’s suffering,
Sever and extinguish demonic spirits.
Seize and capture calamities,
Shatter and destroy their true forms.
May the three *hun* souls attach to the body,
The seven *po* souls find peace.
Guard the body, dispel illness,
Eternally preserve longevity.
All spirits stand in awe—
When the decree arrives, obey and act.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the Celestial Emperor’s statutes command!

**Heavenly Stem Talisman**
When writing this talisman, first recite the incantation to the Heavenly Stem Great Sage.

**Incantation:**
I reverently invoke the Heavenly Stem Great Sage,
Venerable Star of the Northern Dipper,
Lord of the Sun, Lady of the Moon.
Slay and annihilate evil,
Erase traces and obliterate forms.
Demon kings tremble in fear,
Their gall shatters, their hearts collapse.
Relieve the people’s suffering,
Bestow great numinous power.
Cure illness, dispel misfortune,
Turn death into life.
Where the celestial talisman arrives,
Demonic spirits are forever severed.
Descend with true *qi*,
Holy might is executed.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the Celestial Emperor decrees.

Visualize and absorb the true *qi* of the Heavenly Stem’s Celestial Discipline Envoy, blow it onto the brush, and with a flick, inscribe the "ghost" character within.

**Talismanic Forms:**
- Decree (*chi*) character form
- Slaying (*sha*) character form
- Ghost (*gui*) character form

**Fire Bell Valiant General’s Flying Swift Talisman**
**Great Unity’s Shooting Star Demon-Seizing Talisman**
When writing these two talismans, first observe where the Heavenly Stem resides.
Use yellow silk: write with ink on yin days, cinnabar on yang days.
Step the Seven-Star Stem,
Absorb the Heavenly Stem’s *qi*,
Left hand in the Purple Tenuity Seal,
Right hand holding the brush.

**Incantation:**
Heavenly Stem of the Seven Stars,
Celestial Soldiers of the Three Heavens,
Earth-Turning Celestial Soldiers,
Three Heavens’ Great Demon Kings,
Jade Clarity’s Attendant Flying Talisman Envoys,
Descend from heaven,
Issue from my Supreme Perfected Brush.
On this day, at this hour,
Follow these divine generals
To [location] to pursue and seize demonic specters.
Today’s Direct Merit Scribe,
Northern Emperor’s Ghost-Slaying Officers and Soldiers,
Attend me on left and right.
Issue one talisman to lead the way.
After holding the talisman, step the Stem at the Celestial Gate,
Point to the Earthly Door to reach the Heavenly Stem,
Turn and re-enter the Dipper’s Maw.
Burn the talisman to ash,
Knock the teeth seven times.
Recite the previous incantation again,
Left hand holding the talisman ash,
Right hand wielding the sword,
Retreat three steps to the Stem, then stand and shout:
“Talismanic envoys and Merit Scribes, hasten to [location]!”
This method reaches the Celestial Gate, the Five Peaks, the Four Waterways, and rivers—
Nowhere is it obstructed.
It may be written on twelve feet of silk,
Though for regular use, this is unnecessary.
For great evils, act swiftly without delay.
With one breath blown and one sword pointed,
It will proceed to any place and halt.
Then spray water once—
The effect is greatly verified.
Without defense, this is paramount—
Guard it well, do not lightly disclose it.

**Mountain-Shaking Talisman**
**Great Dragon-Locking Talisman**
For the above methods, absorb *qi* on the month’s established day,
Step the Dipper accordingly,
Observe where the Heavenly Stem resides.
Absorb *qi*, hold the breath,
Reverse the *qi*’s flow,
Tongue pressed to the upper palate.
Left hand’s middle finger
Must not leave the Dipper’s Maw when writing the talisman.

**Incantation for the Yin Day:**
I, [Name], Master of the Supreme Threefold Purity’s Boundless Great Dao,
Reverently summon the Earthly Officials, Water Palace Envoys,
River Lords, and Mountain Spirits.
You oversee [matter]—
I solemnly decree this.
This talisman flows through the Three Rivers,
Courses through the Five Seas and terrestrial waters.
If demonic beings lurk in the watery abodes,
Rising untimely to harm the people,
I dispatch the Generals of *Dinghai*, *Dingchou*, * Jiaxu*, and *Jiashen*,
Commanding the Earth-Turning Celestial Soldiers,
To follow this divine talisman—
With one descent, all is settled.
Obey my command,
Then knock the teeth twenty-four times.
Begin writing as if shaking mountains.
Use twelve feet of crimson silk,
Inscribe it upon [mountain]—
The peaks will tremble,
Ghosts and spirits flee in haste.
To lock dragons and strange spirits,
Use an iron plaque twelve inches long,
Inscribe the Dragon-Locking Talisman.
Place it on the shore—
Nothing may pass.
Cast it into lakes or pools—
Any dragon or spirit colliding with the talisman dies.
These two talismans wield the gravest prohibitive power,
Their script neither scattered nor clustered.
Now received from an extraordinary master’s transmission—
Do not use them recklessly.

**Highest Clarity’s Spirit-Transforming Talisman**
For this talisman, step the Dipper’s Stem,
Begin from one’s own life star,
Transform into a Highest Clarity Dharma Master,
Then reverse-step within the Dipper’s Maw to the Stem.
Use white silk twelve inches square,
A cinnabar brush.
Again absorb the Stem’s *qi*,
Visualize and blow it onto the brush.
Press the middle finger’s first joint,
Burn incense with blazing fire.

**Incantation:**
I reverently invoke the Three Masters of the Three Celestial Gates,
Prison Officers,
Nine Heavens’ Great Commander of the Celestial Soldiers,
Great Demon King of the Sun and Moon’s True Realm,
Heavenly *Ding* Warriors,
Six *Jia* Battle Array Envoys,
Five Thunder Lords,
Cloud-Soaring Swift and Rapid Envoys.
Hasten, hasten,
Descend from heaven,
Emerge from the earth!

Cast the Heavenly Net, spread the Earthly Snare,
Ignite the chariot of blazing thunder,
Sever and annihilate demonic spirits.
Let them appear before me,
Without delay or hindrance.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the Celestial Decree commands.

When inscribing the talisman, first recite the incantation thrice.
When dispatching it, recite once.
The talisman, fire, and bell fly with swift efficacy—one method applies universally.

**Highest Clarity Talisman for Illuminating and Annihilating Demonic Forms (Yang Talisman)**
**Highest Clarity Talisman for Illuminating and Annihilating Demonic Forms (Yin Talisman)**
These two talismans, regardless of yin or yang, may be employed.
For instance, if *jiazi* serves as the yang talisman’s envoy, *yichou* serves as the yin talisman’s envoy—capable of vanquishing all malevolent forces.
Still, one must step the Dipper’s Stem while bearing the *qi* of the Stem.
Inscribe with cinnabar on yang days, with ink on yin days.
On yang days, absorb the *qi* of the Sun Lord; on yin days, absorb the *qi* of the Moon Lord.
Blow it onto the talisman and recite the incantation:
The Dao of Heaven stretches wide,
Driving yin to hasten toward yang,
The Straight Talisman rushes to my Dipper’s Stem.
With one strike of the Jade Talisman,
Ten thousand demons conceal themselves.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the Decree commands.

When dispatching the talisman, on yang days recite the Sun Lord’s incantation; on yin days, the Moon Lord’s incantation.
Recite the Sun Lord’s mudra once on yang days,
The Moon Lord’s mudra once on yin days.
Infuse the talisman to expel demonic *qi* and malevolent spirits.
Affix the talisman to a mirror’s surface and illuminate it—all demons will be annihilated in form.

**Highest Clarity Talisman for Inverting the Sea to Summon Rain**
To inscribe this talisman for restraining rain, first report to the Nine River Water Emperors and the nearby sources of rivers and springs.
If the heavens are naturally inclined to rain, yin spirits will respond of their own accord.
If the heavens are not inclined to rain, then point toward river sources, deep pools, and caverns, specifying the matter at hand.
Submit a memorial to the Ancestral Master, the Highest Clarity Great Emperor, and the Jade Emperor of the Vast Heaven,
Humbly beseeching an imperial decree to command the officials of the designated river source to await the talisman and immediately stir winds and summon rain,
Dispersing it across the sealed territory to provide the required measure of rainfall.
Humbly entreat the fulfillment of this petition,
And simultaneously report to the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water,
Memorializing the Cloud, Thunder, and Rain Departments,
The Heavenly *Ding* Warriors, and the Dragon Kings, Wind Earls, and Rain Masters to carry out the decree.
Also issue a warrant specifying the water-bearing location for clear execution and awaiting orders.
Upon casting the talisman, verification will follow, and the ritual will proceed immediately.
A ritual arena must be established, prepared over three to five days.
Once the memorial is submitted, the participants may withdraw.
Obtain one tael of cinnabar, grind it finely,
And prepare a pure brush.
Use an iron plaque, twelve inches long and four inches wide.
Step according to the method, absorb the black *qi*,
Reverse-step the Dipper, stand at the lunar station,
And begin inscribing without hesitation or alteration.
Upon completion, seal it with yellow silk,
Stamp it with the Seal of the Great Master of the Universal Dao,
Inscribe the full title of the position,
Omit the signature, and separately write a directive.
Form the Heavenly *Ding* mudra, recite the transformation incantation,
And summon the Heavenly *Ding* Warriors.
For the lakes and marshes of such-and-such a place,
Point and command the immediate descent of rain.
Now dispatch them to follow the talisman,
Cast it into the designated location,
And coordinate with the local departments.
From such-and-such a month, day, and hour,
Great, sweet rain is urgently needed—no delay is permissible.
Upon completing the inscription, face the memorial and issue the command,
Then cast it into the water.
Without fail, thunder and rain will respond in due time.
In dispatching the talisman, ensure no errors in the text,
And stamp it with the Seal of the Great Master of the Universal Dao.
Follow the secret method precisely—naturally, resonance will follow the sound.

**Highest Clarity Talisman for Binding Dragons**
This talisman is inscribed on a wooden or iron plaque, twelve inches long.
First transform into a spirit,
Summon the talisman’s Official Lords and the Straight Talisman’s Three Officials,
And state the matter at hand.
Prepare cinnabar and a pure brush,
Stand at the Heavenly Gate.
Gaze at the Dipper, step backward twice,
Enter the Dipper’s Maw.
Begin inscribing immediately, maintaining silence until completion.
Instruct the Heavenly *Ding* Warriors,
Form the Heavenly *Ding* mudra to summon them.
State the matter concerning rivers, lakes, or deep pools,
Whether to drive away or bind the dragon.
Upon dispatching the talisman,
Memorialize the Ancestral Master, the Highest Clarity Great Emperor, and the Jade Emperor of the Vast Heaven.
As per the petition, the memorial must be clearly opened and executed without error.
Immediately transmit it to the dispatched officials of rivers and seas,
And report to the Nine River Water Emperors.
After stating the matter,
Step again and summon the Heavenly *Ding* to bear the text and dispatch the talisman,
Then release the mudra’s gaze.
When casting the talisman, ensure the bearer departs swiftly,
Lest the thunderous roar and surging waters startle them.
This is the talisman by which the Celestial Emperor punishes dragon spirits—do not employ it lightly. Keep it secret, keep it secret.

These nine talismans are the esoteric scripts of the Highest Clarity’s Infinite Dao.
Their secret principles are profound and not transmitted to the world.
Since the Later Han Dynasty, they have been passed down through generations,
Their emergence spanning vast ages.
Formerly, the Most High transmitted them to Heavenly Master Zhang,
Marking the beginning of their dissemination and the rise of this teaching.
Thereafter, the Heavenly Master’s aides wielded unparalleled power,
Entering Shu to battle demons,
Summoning wind and rain without awaiting celestial talismans—these were the very talismans employed.
Yet, fearing that later generations might recklessly misuse them,
And incur the Celestial Emperor’s punishment,
They were selected and established under a distinct lineage,
Named the *Marrow of the Numinous Scripts*.
Though transmitted through the ages, the world has remained unaware.
Though I have elucidated their principles,
I dare not treat them as trivial.

Thus, I have refined their subtleties, excising the superficial. Whenever employing these talismans, examine each accompanying explanation to determine its suitability. In dispatching or memorializing, one must follow the prescribed order. Only after mastering the forms, appearances, and incantations of the talisman officers and divine generals may one summon them. With prolonged practice, their presence shall manifest before your eyes.

Hereafter are described the forms, attire, and regalia of the talisman emissaries.

The foregoing nine talismanic incantations and their applications, along with the subsequent esoteric discussions, contain not a single extraneous character. All were personally compiled by the Thirtieth Heavenly Master, Master Xujing. This text is of utmost importance, its prohibitions most solemn.

**Recognizing the Nine Talisman Emissaries**

*"Solar Emperor Lord, by the Celestial Emperor’s decree, swiftly seize the ghosts and deliver them beneath the Dipper’s *Kuigang*, plunging ten thousand *zhang* into the earth to meet their death. Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the laws of the Fengdu Great Emperor!"*

Blow northern *qi* onto the brush.

To dispel malevolence, say *"clouds depart the body"*; to affix it, say *"clouds attach to the body"*.

Recite the incantation:
*"Seven Slaughters of the Great Sun, Radiance of the Sun, Southern Dipper General, Northern Dipper *Kuigang*. Mighty Blue-Headed One, seize the ghosts and deliver them to the *Gang*.

**Supreme Lord’s Urgent Birth Talisman**
Whenever inscribing talismans to hasten birth, first recite the *Pure Heaven and Earth Mantra* and the *Purification Mantra*. Then silently invoke the Northern Dipper, the Nine Heavens’ Overseer of Birth, the Nine Heavens’ Guardian of the Womb, and the Nine Heavens’ Child of Deliverance—visualize each as if seen with your own eyes. After silently stating the purpose of the talisman, inhale qi and blow it upon yourself, transforming into the Overseer of Birth: crowned with a *Lishi* helm, clad in golden armor, draped in a full cape, shod in black boots, and standing with sword drawn.

Proceed by using the left hand’s index and middle fingers to press the base of the thumb, the thumb to press the middle finger’s joint, and the remaining fingers to grasp the palm’s center. Take three steps, inhale the pivot’s qi, and blow upon the brush. Hold the breath and inscribe the talisman. Neither women nor the one requesting the talisman may witness this. Observe which hand they use to receive it—left for males, right for females.

**Thunder Talisman for Hastening Birth**
Incantation for the Urgent Birth Talisman.

Hark!

*End of Scroll Three of the Orthodox Methods of the Heavenly Heart*
*Scroll Four of the Orthodox Methods of the Heavenly Heart*
**On Subduing Epileptic and Demonic Possession**

Whenever treating those afflicted with epilepsy, demonic possession, or frenzied wandering—unaware of human affairs, naked and exposed, raving incoherently—if previous attempts at restraint have failed, first have the patient’s family submit a written petition to the altar. Once the judgment is inscribed, the ritual master first casts a distant net, ensuring all is secured. Then, prepare a statement detailing the patient’s condition and submit it to the Court of the Sacred Peak, as well as a memorial to the City God. All written documents must be kept secret. Dispatch divine generals to oversee the proceedings. In a secluded chamber, inscribe the talismans—no one else may witness this.

Select and dispatch generals and soldiers to monitor and pursue the affliction. Summon the deities of the patient’s dwelling—mountains, forests, altars, and temples—as well as the ancestral spirits, the Five Paths Earth Gods, and all relevant deities, both within and without. At the appointed hour, command them to converge and scatter in pursuit. At the patient’s home, all malevolent spirits and demonic entities from the Three Realms that have brought misfortune must be firmly restrained, awaiting the arrival of this court. No unauthorized commands or biased testimony shall be heeded. Any harm inflicted upon the imperial subjects must be verified with certainty.

On the following day—or even the same day—the ritual master arrives at the patient’s home, sword not in hand. First, purify the body and transform into the divine form. Step the Three Terraces and Seven Stars of the Pivot, advancing to the Dipper’s Mouth. Purify body and mind, silently pay homage to the Supreme Emperor, and memorialize the matter. Then, lead the assembly of all the great sage officials and generals of the ritual department in due order. Depart without looking back.

Along the way, recite the *Heavenly Vanguard Mantra* without limit. Upon arrival, cast a close net. Command the divine generals to firmly restrain and capture the demonic entities, declaring: *"The matter is concluded—cease!"* Proceed as in healing rituals, advancing together to the door.

Once the ritual actions are complete, form the Dipper Seal with the left hand and strike the door three times with the right. Then recite the *Closing Door Spell*:
*"By the Supreme’s command, block the door and seize the demonic ghosts.
All vengeful spirits vanish of themselves.
*Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the Supreme’s statutes and ordinances!*"*

Enter the door, form the Mountain Seal with the left hand, inhale a mouthful of Northern qi, and blow it out. Visualize the Four Great Divine Generals lifting mountains to seal the door. Command:
*"Left Door Spirit, Right Door Marshal, and Five Paths Gods—secure the door tightly! Allow no demonic entities to escape. Disobedience will be met with punishment!"*

Inside the door, recite the *Locking Door Spell*:
*"Heaven’s Slayer, Earth’s Slayer, Door’s Slayer—all demonic entities, slain!
By my authority, I command the Door Gods: permit no demonic entities to escape—seize them at once!
*Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!*"*

Clasp the Great Slayer Talisman with both hands, or form the Lock Seal. Upon entering, first lift the left foot’s garment with the left hand, step the right chest three times over the threshold, and recite the *Locking Door Spell*. Then release the garment, face the North-South Dipper, inhale three mouthfuls of Northern qi toward the door, and visualize the lock sealing.

Next, have the patient’s family arrange an altar in the main hall for the divine generals, offering fresh fruits, incense, lamps, tea, paper money, and horses. The ritual master then transforms into the divine form, steps the Pivot, and summons the generals. Recite the personal secret mantras of the court’s generals, visualizing each in their proper form, and command: *"The matter is concluded."*

Then, have the patient brought out. The ritual master forms the Demon-Quelling Seal with the left hand and the Sword Seal with the right. Alternatively, hold the Heavenly Vanguard Ruler—remaining within the Pivot steps. Recite the *Subduing Blade and Sword Mantra*, form the Dipper Seal with the left hand and the Golden Blade Seal with the right, and chant:
*"Qian’s origin flows through Lu’s center,
Sun and Moon illuminate me.
Blade and edge follow my descent—
harm not my body.
By the authority of the Nine Heavens’ statutes and ordinances!"*

Upon completion, shout:
*"Divine Generals—swiftly drag forth the malevolent spirits that have brought misfortune! Hasten!"*

If the possessed patient rushes out, point the Demon-Quelling Seal at them and shout:
*"Four Upright Heavenly Pivot Generals—swiftly bind their hands! Hasten!"*

Then employ the *Capturing, Binding, Canguing, and Pillorying Mantras and Seals*. If the demon refuses to confess, use the *Paper Pellet Inquiry Method*, also called the *Heavenly Pivot’s Fiery Brain Talisman*. Invoke:
*"Heavenly Pivot Divine Kings—clad in purple robes, crowned in gold.
Divine Pivot Divine Kings—clad in vermilion robes, crowned in gold."*

On two pieces of crimson paper, inscribe the two Divine Kings. While writing, visualize them, inhale the Pivot qi, and blow it onto the brush. After inscribing nine pellets, burn them over incense and fumigate the patient’s nose—they will confess.

If they remain unyielding, recite the *Great Divine Fire-Burning Demon Spell*:
*"Great Sage Inverse Fire, flowing to the Southern Realm.
Fire Officials burn—demonic ghosts perish!
*Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!*"*

Inhale the qi of the Sun, blow it onto the brush, and inscribe a single fire character in a circle. Place it in the patient’s nose, recite the previous spell again, inhale another mouthful of solar qi, and blow it onto the patient’s crown. Burn the pellet—recovery will be swift. Through such interrogation, none will fail to submit.

Then, assess the severity and determine the appropriate course of action. Recite the *Spell for Expelling Demonic Entities from the Body*:
*"Heavenly Pivot Great Sages—upright qi flows freely.
The human body is peaceful and auspicious—demonic entities vanish.
Heavenly Pivot’s upright qi—all evil departs the body!
*Swiftly, swiftly, by the authority of the Supreme Emperor’s statutes and ordinances!*"*

Left hand forms the Heavenly Pivot mudra, right hand holds the water vessel, and the spell is recited three times. Face the Heavenly Pivot, draw in qi three times, blow it into the water, and spray it onto the patient, who is also made to drink it—thus awakening them. Then shout: *"Demonic spirits, swiftly depart the body!"* Next, administer talismanic water for the patient to swallow. Then purify the body. Next, dispatch officers to set up an altar in the patient’s home, ensuring continuous incense and lamp offerings until the patient fully recovers. Afterward, offer sacrifices to the generals and soldiers of this court, settle all matters, then issue official documents and send the troops back to the altar.

When treating demonic possession, beware of the patient wielding blades to harm the ritual master. For this subsequent section, if the case is ordinary and does not require the summoning of the ritual officer, proceed as follows:

**Spell:**
*"Reverently invoke Qian Yuan and Lu Zhongheng,
Sun and Moon illuminate me.
Blades fall at my command,
Let no harm come to my body.
I act by the statutes and ordinances of the Nine Heavens!"*

Draw in the qi of the Heavenly Pivot and blow it onto both shoulders. Then, with the thumb, press the *Xuanwen* mark and recite:
*"Rescue, submit, and offer the treasure to the Emperor!
When encountering madness or demonic possession,
If the patient wields blades, do not approach.
Instead, form the Dipper Seal with the left hand
and the Golden Blade Mudra with the right, and recite:
*Qian Yuan Lu Zhongheng,
Sun and Moon illuminate me.
Blades fall at my command,
Let no harm come to my body.
I act by the statutes and ordinances of the Nine Heavens!"*

Draw in the qi of the Heavenly Pivot and blow it toward the patient’s hand. Strike with the right hand’s Golden Blade Mudra—the blade will fall of its own accord.

**Method for Dispersing Qi to Treat Pain:**
The ritual officer stands firm, forming the Dipper Seal with the left hand and the Sword Mudra with the right, pointing directly at the painful area. First, have the patient cough once, then inhale sharply. Seal the pain at the *mao* position on the left, guiding it to the flank as the "Demon’s Well." Recite the spell three times, draw in three mouthfuls of qi from due north, and blow it onto the painful area.
*Swiftly, swiftly!*

**Method for Dispersing the Qi of the Heavenly Pivot to Treat Headaches:**
For all headache treatments, press both Dipper Seals firmly against the temples. Recite the Heavenly Pivot’s true spell three times, draw in three mouthfuls of its qi, and blow it onto the head. Have the patient cough three times, then inhale three mouthfuls of the painful qi and blow it onto the ground, stamping it down with the foot. Repeat this process until the third breath of qi. Then, withdraw the Dipper Seals one hand at a time—first the right, then the left—and ask whether the pain remains. If only half the pain is to be dispelled, hold the Sword Mudra at the center without reciting the spell, first withdrawing one hand. Then, recite the spell and blow away the pain from one side, while the other side’s pain is drawn out. The side from which the hand was first withdrawn will experience greater pain—this must be kept secret.

**Method for Treating Boils and Toxins:**
For all boils and toxins, first write the character *chi* (敕) over the red and swollen area, then draw in the qi of the Heavenly Pivot and blow it onto the painful spot.

**Spell:**
*"Chi! Chi! Sever the poison,
By great power, seize and subdue,
Eradicate the great pain.
Swiftly, swiftly, seize!"*

With the left hand forming the Dipper Seal and the right hand holding the brush, recite the spell over the painful area until the character *chi* is complete. Draw in the qi of the Dipper and, along with the mudra, blow it onto the painful spot. Then, press the Dipper Seal again, recite the spell while tracing over the *chi* character, and when the spell ends, lift the brush. Once more, form the Dipper Seal, draw in the qi of the Heavenly Pivot, and blow it onto the area. With the left hand forming the Thunder Seal, write the character *lei* (雷), recite the spell until complete, draw in the qi of thunder, and along with the mudra, blow it onto the painful spot. Then, press the Thunder Seal and trace over the *lei* character while reciting the spell. When the spell ends, lift the brush, draw in the qi of thunder, and along with the mudra, blow it onto the painful area.

**Talisman for Scorpion and Centipede Stings:**
*"Great Sage of the Heavenly Pivot, ascend straight upward!"*
Draw in the qi of the Heavenly Pivot and blow it onto the affected area—recovery will be swift.

**For All Swelling and Poison from Insect or Creature Bites:**
Draw in the qi of the Northern *Xi* and blow it onto the painful area. Write the spell in full, repeating this nine times, then encircle it to form a talisman. Mix with vinegar and paste it onto the painful area.

**Spell for Jujube to Treat All Illnesses:**
*"Sun’s Three Sands seize,
Moon’s Three Sands seize.
Reverently invoke the divine general Niu Jutong to seize,
Reverently request the Jade Emperor to descend the Fire Dragon to seize!"*

For this method, draw in the qi of the Southern *Wu* position, recite the spell seven times, and blow seven mouthfuls of qi onto the jujube.

**Spell for Jujube to Treat Malaria:**
*"□□ Heavenly Pivot,
Sun and Moon descend their numen.
Enter this jujube,
Expel malaria,
Sweep away demonic dust.
Swiftly, swiftly, by the statutes and ordinances of the Most High Lord Lao!"*

Form the Dipper Seal with the left hand and conceal the jujube, recite the spell seven times, and blow seven mouthfuls of qi onto the jujube.

**Method for Treating Warmth and Cutting Off Epidemics:**
If it is a heavenly epidemic, harmonize and resolve it. If it is a demonic epidemic, drive it away. For all epidemic treatments, first examine and verify carefully. If an entire region, village, or community is afflicted, or if no one has filed a petition, or if someone has, record the details thoroughly. Submit a flying memorial to the Three Pure Ones, the Ancestral Masters, and the Jade Emperor; report to the Eastern Peak; and petition the City God to hold the afflicted accountable for their sins. Alternatively, petition only the local community shrine and the fierce temple deities to drive away the epidemic. Next, issue a warrant to the Master of Epidemic Retreat, commanding the swift removal of the illness. Then, proceed in person, following the methods for treating demonic possession and subduing mountain spirits: transform the spirit, step the Pivot, and silently memorialize the Emperor, presenting the aforementioned details. Next, form the Transformation Mudra, follow the prescribed method to transform, and refine into the Northern Emperor. With the left hand, form the Jade Emperor’s mudra and recite the spell:

*"Om Hum Hum,
All spirits bow their heads,
Demons submit to rectitude.
Those who dare resist,
Be reduced to dust.
Swiftly, swiftly, by the Emperor’s decree!"*

The ritual master then forms the Transformation Mudra again, reverting to the Northern Emperor, and gives thanks. Wielding the Jade Emperor’s decree, accompanied by the Six Ding and Six Jia warriors, the Wind Earl, the Rain Master, and the Five Thunder Envoys, ascend the Celestial Path, riding clouds back to the Demon-Dispelling Court. The ritual officer steps the Pivot again, summoning all the court’s generals and soldiers, who arrive one by one. After reiterating the details, the right hand wheels the Five Thunder Seal and recites:

*"First revolution: Six Spirits concealed—*mao*.*
Second revolution: Four Malevolents vanquished—*yin*.
Third revolution: Pivot and Dipper stirred—*chou*.
Fourth revolution: Thunderfire surges—*center, center*.
Fifth revolution: Thunderclap erupts—*wei*."

The sixth revolution: Mountain demons perish—four fingers at center.
The seventh revolution: All wayless ones are gathered and subdued.
Sever heads, break limbs—fiendish and malevolent ghosts,
hasten beneath my Pivot and Dipper to receive death, and dare not stir.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the Celestial Decree commands.

Form the *zi* seal, complete the Thunder Formation.
The ritual officer, with the Thunder Formation in the left hand, issues its covering strike,
tucks the Thunder Formation beneath the flank, and with the sword in the right hand proceeds—
no need for distance, only the near-covering, sealing, and locking of gates.

Next, at the patient’s door, have incense, lamps, wine, fruit, and offerings for the divine generals prepared.
At the hall’s entrance, the ritual officer transforms into spirit, steps the *Huoluo Dipper* Formation to shield the body,
then the *Three Terraces and Seven Stars* Formation, summoning and commanding the generals.
In accordance with the decree, call forth the King of Wandering Disease Ghosts to listen carefully to the proclamation.

After presenting tea and wine, the ritual officer, with the Thunder Formation in the left hand and sword in the right, swears:
*"I, having received the immortal edict and mandate of Jade Clarity,
practice the true method of the Celestial Heart and wield the numinous scriptures of the Northern Emperor.
Bearing the sacred seal, I command the generals and soldiers,
and by celestial talisman, govern demons and banish evil.
I vow to act as Heaven’s agent in ordering all things,
assisting the state and pacifying the people—this is the present hour.
For the sake of [the patient’s name], I, though unworthy, have presumptuously taken up this duty.
Since your sincerity has drawn near, how dare I neglect this proclamation?
You, as the King of Wandering Disease Ghosts, ought to follow the mysterious statutes,
deploying your malevolent qi only in places of disloyalty and unfiliality.
How can you recklessly spread poisonous qi to harm living beings?
I have already submitted the details of this case on behalf of this household,
flying a memorial to the Three Heavens to confess sins and seek absolution—
and you have been graciously pardoned.
Now, in accordance with my command, depart this instant.
Hasten to withdraw the poisonous qi you have unleashed,
eradicating it completely so that the afflicted may recover at once.
By this command, act swiftly and obey."*

Next, burn the documents, paper money, and horses for dispatching the Ghost King,
but do not yet burn the paper for the divine generals.

The ritual officer recites the *Golden Light Mantra* and the *Great Thunder Duke of All Heaven Mantra*,
then with both hands forms the Thunder Formation, draws in a mouthful of water, and sprays it while shouting: *"Swiftly, swiftly!"*

Next, have each afflicted person sit together on a bench.
The ritual officer burns the *Three Officials’ Exorcism Talisman*, the *Sun Talisman*,
and other talismans for halting pestilence in a bowl of water.
Then, consecrates the ritual water and has them swallow talismans like the *Three Lights Talisman*.
Next, the afflicted’s body is exorcised.

Then, burn the *Fire Bell Valiant General Talisman*, the *Great Unity Racing Star Talisman*,
the *Spirit-Linking Talisman*, and the *Golden Money Cloud Horse* before the patient.
Before the hour passes, use a large fan to waft the ashes so they settle upon each person’s body.

Next, the ritual officer has each person cover themselves with a blanket and sleep.
The ritual officer burns various *Pestilence-Dispelling Talismans* in a brazier,
fumigating all rooms around the house, then pours vinegar over the coals to intensify the smoke.

Next, the ritual officer purifies the house by circling it,
then consecrates more ritual water and sets it down.
Have each person freely ingest talismans.
Next, sink a talisman into the well for them to drink.
Then, place the *Divine Generals’ Merit Talisman* and establish an incense altar in the household,
awaiting the day of full recovery to feast and reward the generals and soldiers before sending them off one by one.
In practicing thus, ten thousand cases will not fail.

**Retreat Pestilence Talisman**
Recite the *Royal Seal Mantra* afterward, with the *Heaven Gate Qi*, and dispatch as before.
Fold repeatedly, write in cinnabar on yellow paper—may be swallowed or affixed.
Also, thread three coins onto one talisman and sink it into the water vat.

**General Talisman Consecration Mantra**
*"The Most High Lord Lao commands:
The Five Directions’ Pestilence Ghosts—Liu Yuanda, Zhong Shiji, Zhao Gongming,
Zhang Yuanbo, Shi Wenye, Fan Juqing, Feng Hunsi, Yao Gongbo, Li Gongzhong—
and all miscellaneous ghosts of the Six Ding, be seized and beheaded without regard to guilt or innocence.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the Law and Decree command!"*

**Dispatch Talisman Mantra**

Om Hūm Hūm,
All spirits bow their heads—demons return to rectitude.
Should any dare resist, they shall be reduced to dust.
By the decree of the Jade Emperor Supreme.

**Marshal Tianpeng’s Pestilence-Taming Talisman**
Boil peach twigs into a decoction and swallow.

**Heavenly Stem Pestilence-Dispelling Sweat-Inducing Talisman**
For the right method:
First recite the *Sun and Moon Together Stand, Yin Rules the Official’s Decline* mantra,
then draw three mouthfuls of *qi* from the Heavenly Stem,
and chant over brush and inkstone.

Recite again:
*"The Celestial Emperor’s Scripture,
borne by the Heavenly Stem.
How dare the malevolent ghosts of the Five Directions not perish?
With a single breath of the Flying Immortal, ten thousand demons hide in submission.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the Law and Decree command!"*

Draw another breath of *qi* from the Heavenly Stem, blow upon the brush, and inscribe the talisman.
Recite the *Celestial Emperor’s Scripture*, visualizing the Heavenly Stem.
Once the talisman is fully inscribed and the mantra complete,
recite the *Celestial Master’s Pestilence-Repelling Spirit Mantra*.

The consecration mantra states:
*"By decree:
Eastern Green Pestilence Ghosts, essence of rotting wood;
Southern Red Pestilence Ghosts, essence of scorching flame;
Western White Pestilence Ghosts, essence of molten metal;
Northern Qi Pestilence Ghosts, essence of dried-up pools;
Central Yellow Pestilence Ghosts, essence of filth and earth.
Born through the transformations of the four seasons and eight solar terms,
spirits failing to nurture within turn outward as demonic essences.
The qi of the Five Pestilences enters the human form,
now cold, now hot—restless and unquiet.
The Nine Ugly Ghosts know your names.
You must depart swiftly, tarry not a moment longer.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the Law and Decree command!"*

Each dose is to be taken facing north after reciting the incantation. Use a needle to scoop sesame oil, burn it over a lamp until it turns to ash, and place it in a clean bowl. Recite the incantation again, then mix with water and consume, abstaining from meat and fish.

**Hun Yuan Water-Fire Two Wheels Talisman**
The Water Wheel dispels heat illnesses; the Fire Wheel dispels cold illnesses. With both hands, curl the four fingers while pressing the thumbs down, forming the Thunder Seal. Facing north, inhale a mouthful of *qi* and say:
*"By decree, I summon the waters of the Eastern Ocean, the Nine Rivers, and the Four Seas—let them all enter this water. I act by the Emperor’s command."*
Next, press the *Wu* (Noon) seal, inhale a mouthful of southern *qi*, and say:
*"By decree, I summon the True Lord of Fire Virtue, the Fire Officials, the Fire Bell Generals, the Revered Fire Spirits—let their true *qi* descend into this fire. Swiftly, swiftly, as the Law and Decree command!"*

**Purple Court Rainbow Talisman for Consumptive Illnesses**
**Talisman Incantation:**
*"Rainbows and serpents, transform into the long arc of heaven.
The Three Corpses bring calamity; the Nine Worms wreak havoc.
They invade the five viscera, roam the bladder,
now red, now white, now green, now yellow.
Swallowed into the belly, they scour the stomach and wash the intestines.
Banish the hundred illnesses; strengthen bones and joints.
Through the Triple Burner and the Four Seas, when this talisman arrives, seize and destroy—dare they not perish?
As the Purple Court Emperor Lord’s Law and Decree commands!"*

Write five talismans. Before and after lighting the lamp, roll them into pills for the patient to swallow, or burn them to ash and mix into clean water or food for the patient’s kin to consume. If worms emerge, fry them in an oil wok. If none appear, administer another talisman, thoroughly expel them from the room, and when the incantation and brushwork are complete, fry the oil wok at the Ghost Gate. First burn incense, pray to the Celestial Stem, and describe the patient’s condition in detail, saying:
*"I offer five bowls of pure water and three lamps to the honored deities of the Five Stars—Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth—the True Persons of the Purple Court, and the Great Sage of the Celestial Stem. At this time, may the talisman’s messengers and all the great sages within the Purple Court Talisman act accordingly."*

All ritual officers form the Thunder Seal, flash lightning thrice, strike the drum six times, and summon thunder to shatter the patient’s affliction. Burn the talisman with thunder fire, then boil a seven-inch peach twig with a pinch of frankincense in water for the patient to drink. Place a lamp beside the patient and have them sleep. If any ghostly worms emerge, fry them immediately. Relatives must not look back, lest the toxic worms in the oil enter their bodies and spread.

For consumptive illnesses transmitted through corpses, first submit a memorial to the heavens, verify the symptoms, then issue talismans to pursue the worms.

**Treating Malarial Fevers**
Shun’an Tang’s *Yi Kui* states: *"Malarial outbreaks arise from the imbalance of yin and yang *qi*. When the Five Phases turn cold and fall out of sequence, they deviate from Heaven and Earth’s perfect harmony. When humans are afflicted, it manifests as alternating chills and fever. If an entire clan or village falls ill, it is due to the pervasive cold *qi*—only the correct *qi* can subdue it. By wielding the true *qi* of the Celestial Stem’s thunder and fire to expel the pathogenic *qi*, natural peace is restored."*

**Divinely Effective Malaria-Dispelling Talisman**
**Method:**
On the day of onset, burn one talisman to ash over a sesame oil lamp at dawn, boil a seven-inch peach twig in water, and consume it while abstaining from meat. This talisman specializes in treating malarial fevers, dispelling epidemics, and addressing seasonal cold damage, measles, and pox. Transmitted by Tang Shun’an, its efficacy is unmatched.

**Restoring the Wandering Soul**
Whenever a person suffers from mental derangement, fearing that ghosts or spirits have seized their living soul—or when a beautiful woman’s soul is stolen by a deity, leaving her unconscious and insensible—how can one immediately capture the malevolent force? First, stabilize the soul and retrieve the spirit, guiding the ethereal and corporeal souls back to the body for natural recovery. If the illness is genuine, or caused by fright or heartbreak with no spirit to blame, pursuing the soul and calming the mind is the best remedy. For those who die suddenly but retain warmth in the chest, act swiftly to retrieve the soul.

**Four Great Generals’ Soul-Restoring Talisman**
**Gathering Form**
**Talisman Incantation**

With reverence, we invoke the exalted perfected sages, the Celestial Sovereign of the Solar Palace, the Lord of the Great Sun, the Seven Luminaries of the Northern Dipper, the Three Perfected Lords Tang, Ge, and Zhou, the Four Great Celestial Marshals, and all the divine hosts of every sacred department—may they descend into this talisman.

Should the afflicted suffer from malevolent spirits’ encroachment, we humbly beseech the vast divine power to seize and subdue them. If these are celestial deities or earthly spirits, or any manner of spectral beings, dispatch them directly to the Nine Heavens. If they are wayward or demonic, send them at once to the Eastern Peak for judgment by celestial law, that retribution be visited upon the patient’s household and swift recovery be granted. Let all be as commanded.

Grasp the Dipper mudra, and blow the qi of the northwest onto the talisman. This talisman calms the heart and stabilizes the soul; it may be burned and ingested by the afflicted. Tang Shun’an once employed this talisman to settle the mind and retrieve the wandering soul, with remarkable efficacy.

**Orthodox Unity Marshal’s Talisman for Dispersing Form**
This talisman is for those whose spirit is depleted and whose ethereal and corporeal souls are scattered. Simply ingest seven doses of this talisman, and naturally the spirit will clear, the qi will flourish, and the souls will be at peace.

**Talisman Incantation**
The true talisman of the Supreme Emperor descends with divine might,
The Nine Heavens pursue and seize, severing demonic forces.
The numinous stem of the Dipper shields the body,
Gathering the three ethereal souls without delay.
Restore them to the afflicted, preserving purity of form;
The three souls hasten back to the ailing body,
The seven spirits hasten back to the celestial spirit.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the living qi’s decree!

If the soul has not yet returned, recite again.

**Summoning Incantation**
Dark clouds gather thickly,
Aiding our celestial marshals.
With shelter and with binding,
With capture and with restraint.
Where the Marshal arrives,
Great might is bestowed.
Retrieve the soul, restore the form,
By sacred authority, let it be done!
Swiftly, swiftly, as the decree commands!

**Incantation for Retrieving the Soul and Restoring the Body**
The three ethereal souls dwell on the left,
The seven corporeal spirits dwell on the right.
Heaven and earth grow dim—
Let the numinous soul descend swiftly!
Swiftly, swiftly, as the decree commands!

**Method**
Imprint the left Dipper seal with the killing qi of the Northern Dipper’s seven stars, and blow it onto the patient’s body. If they remain unconscious, recite the incantation again:

The Nine Celestial Stems of the Northern Dipper,
Great deities of the central heavens,
Ascend to the Golden Gates,
Descend to cover Kunlun.
They regulate the cosmic order,
Governing the cosmos.
Great Dipper, Greedy Wolf,
Giant Gate, Store of Fortune,
Literary Brilliance, Integrity and Purity,
Martial Brilliance, Breaker of Armies.
Supreme Jade Emperor,
Purple Tenuity Emperor Lord,
Encompassing the great celestial realm,
Penetrating the tiniest speck of dust.
What disaster cannot be eradicated?
What blessing cannot be attained?
The primordial qi of the August Emperor
Comes to merge with my body.
Where the Celestial Stem points,
It revolves day and night without cease.
Though humble folk dwell in the mundane,
They seek the Dao and yearn for the numinous.
May they behold your august presence,
And forever preserve longevity.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the decree commands!

Imprint the Dipper seal with the seven stars, recite the incantation, and imbue the seven stars’ qi into water, then spray it onto the patient’s body.

Here ends *Scroll Four of the Orthodox Methods of the Celestial Heart of Highest Clarity*.
*Scroll Five of the Orthodox Methods of the Celestial Heart of Highest Clarity* begins.

To Pursue and Subdue Mountain Demons

Whenever one wishes to pursue and subdue mountain demons, have them submit a written complaint. Clearly state the circumstances within the complaint, then secretly petition the Eastern Peak [Mount Tai] and memorialize the City God, borrowing divine soldiers to assist. On the day of treatment, first purify the body and silently pay homage to the Supreme Emperor. Present the case and its details, then visualize the Northern Emperor ascending his throne from among the star officials. Summon Zhenwu and others, commanding them to seize the sources of evil across the Three Realms. Next, envision Zhenwu receiving the imperial decree and descending to stand before you.

Rise and transform into a divine being, becoming the great general Zhenwu: hair unbound, barefoot, wielding the Samādhi Fire Sword in the right hand while forming the mudrā with the left, treading upon the Dark Warrior. After completing the inner alchemical transformation, proceed to pace the Three Terraces and the Seven Stars of the Dipper’s handle, fulfilling each step in turn. Then summon the officials and generals of the Southern Court, visualizing each one clearly. Once the prayer and declaration are complete, form the Heavenly Ding mudrā with the left hand and the Sword mudrā with the right. Call forth the Heavenly Ding Valiant Soldiers and the Four Duty Divine Generals, envisioning them at your left and right. First, cast the Dipper mudrā, directing the handle’s pointer toward the location of the demonic spirits.

Next, the ritual master prepares the cinnabar, ink, brush, and inkstone according to the talismanic format. Then, arrange the Ding and Jia talismans and inscribe the talisman upon the altar.

**Ding and Jia Talisman**

**Talisman Incantation**
I bear the seal of the Most High,
By imperial decree I enter the household,
Deploying spirits and spreading qi,
Severing demons and expelling evil.
Four Duty Divine Generals,
Six Ding and Six Jia,
Be swiftly summoned by me,
Hasten to the altar’s front.
Here I stand,
Sword planted, awaiting you.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the decree commands!

**This is the method.**

Left, the Demon-Quelling Text; right, the Sword Mudrā. Recite the talisman incantation, draw in the qi of the northwest, and blow it directly north onto the talisman. Then burn the aforementioned talisman, and blow it away as before. Loudly recite the *Talisman Incantation* to its end. With the left hand holding the water vessel and the right hand wielding the sword, point once to draw in water and spray it forth, shouting: "Swiftly!" Upon completing the incantation, envision the Six Ding and Six Jia, the Four Duty Divine Generals, and the talisman spirits hastening to that place.

Next, the ritual master descends, performing the *Far Enclosure* and *Near Enclosure*, *Locking the Door* and *Nailing the Door*, each step identical to the method for treating demonic possession. Arriving at the household, the ritual master undergoes a profound transformation, first stepping the *Huoluo Dipper* to enshroud the body.

**Huoluo Dipper Step**
**Step Incantation**
The Dipper’s mystery lies in the twelve celestial stems,
Riding the radiance of yang, martial might arrays.
Qi drifts like floating clouds,
This transformation moves in accord with Heaven.
Knowing change brings fortune or misfortune,
Enter the Six Pitches to uphold the Jia prohibitions.
Now step into the Dipper’s domain.
Tread upon *Tianying*, mount *Tianren*,
The clear, cold spring may yet sink into land.
Embrace *Tianzhu*, align with *Tianxin*,
Pass through here to cross *Tianqin*.
Flank *Tianfu*, gaze toward *Tianchong*,
Enter *Tiannei*, exit *Tianpeng*.
The Dipper’s Dao flows, harmonizing hard and soft,
Augmenting blessings and emoluments to flow through generations,
Emerging from darkness to endure for ten thousand ages.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the decree commands!

**Great Yu’s Dragon Gate Long Formation Dipper Step**

Upon completing the *Huoluo Dipper* to enshroud the body, step the *Three Terraces and Seven Stars Formation*, summon the generals, and issue commands. Then step the *Great Yu’s Dragon Gate Long Formation Dipper*, ensuring the body’s defenses are thoroughly secured. Recite the incantation:

Within Qian’s origin, Lu’s center flourishes,
Sun and moon illuminate me.
Blades fall where I direct,
None may harm my person.
I act by the decree of the Nine Heavens.

Then shout: "Divine generals, swiftly! For me, restrain and expel the mountain sprites and one-footed ghosts—appear at once!" Immediately burn the Six Ding and Six Jia spirit talismans to fly forth. If they submit and retreat, cease. If they do not submit, and continue to hurl bricks and stones, employ the *Heavenly Heart Pacification Talisman* to subdue raging ghosts, and use the proper method to treat mountain sprites.

For households of any of the five surnames afflicted by all manner of demonic misfortune, where spirits stir and cause disturbances: before proceeding with the dispatch, take a new tile and inscribe the talisman according to the method, placing it face-up at the center of the hearth. Use new bricks and tiles, sealing the hearth’s opening with mud. Inscribe the full official signature, and the Stove God will promptly report, facilitating the dispatch.

If demonic ghosts bewilder a person, causing raving and incoherent speech, write the talisman in cinnabar on white silk and place it in the collar of the afflicted person’s garment—they will recover at once. If a mountain sprite or one-footed ghost guards its location, inscribe a single line in ink, and the ghost will flee immediately. If no Dao-aligned spirits are present, and ghosts set fires, hurl stones, strike doors, or harass livestock, this talisman will permanently sever their influence. Collect the thrown stones or bricks, inscribe a talisman upon them, and cast them back to their origin—they will not return. Should they dare to return and refuse to submit to the dispatch, add the characters "Demon-Quelling" to the talisman, and their traces will be utterly erased.

When inscribing talismans, first recite the *Brush Consecration Incantation*:
Heaven holds myriad forms,
The brush holds myriad hairs.
Inscribed talismans capture and bind,
Consigned to the Heavenly Prison.
Swiftly, by the decree of Fengdu, seize them!

**Heavenly Heart Pacification Talisman**
**Talisman Incantation**
Great Sage of the Heavenly Stem, Heavenly Stem Spirit,
Descend swiftly, seize and bind the *Gongcao* mudrā of the Southern Dipper, above the *Feixiao*.
Haomingda, Lubingnu, Shiyang, lead your retinue—
I know your names, I know your surnames, depart swiftly!
Swiftly, swiftly, as the decree commands!

Recite another incantation, blowing onto the talisman seven times:
*Niqanduoli* □□□□, swiftly, swiftly, as the decree commands!

Next, recite:
Solemnly command the ghosts of the Eastern Wood Emperor to depart swiftly,
Great Sage of the Heavenly Stem, dispatch and seize them.
Blow the eastern qi onto the talisman.

Solemnly command the ghosts of the Western Metal Emperor to depart swiftly,
Great Sage of the Heavenly Stem, restrain and seize them.
Blow the western qi onto the talisman.

Solemnly command the ghosts of the Southern Fire Emperor to depart swiftly,
Great Sage of the Heavenly Stem, dispatch and seize them.
Blow the southern qi onto the talisman.

Solemnly command the ghosts of the Northern Water Emperor to depart swiftly,
Great Sage of the Heavenly Stem, rescue and seize them.
Blow the northern qi onto the talisman.

Solemnly command the ghosts of the Central Earth Emperor,
Great Sage of the Heavenly Stem, rescue and seize them.
Blow the central earth qi onto the talisman.

**Dispatching Generals and Talisman Incantation**
Solemnly invoke the Six Ding spirits and Six Jia generals,
Divine generals, lead your divine soldiers,
Assist my numinous scripture.
Swiftly pursue the Marshal to the east,
Hasten to Xuchang to seize them!

Recite further:
Solemnly invoke Generals Zhao and Guo,
To swiftly seize these lawless demonic spirits and ghostly bandits,
And cast them ten thousand *zhang* and a thousand *chi* into the earth.
Never release them,
No pardon when mercy is granted,
No reprieve when amnesty is declared.
Should they refuse to submit,
Send them to the Fire Wheel Hell for confinement.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the decree commands!

**Talisman Reverse Inscription**
The Numinous Talisman of the Supreme Vermilion Phoenix Emperor commands the Divine Lords of the Northern Emperor.
Above, invoke the Six Heavens’ governance and the underworld’s Northern Emperor,
Whose ghostly palaces are all within my camp,
All under my command—what ghost dares oppose?
Left, gird the *Huoluo*; right, bear the Fire Bell.
Hurl fire for ten thousand *li*, overawing a thousand spirits.
The Earth Officials seize, the Heavenly Warriors advance.
Those who offend are executed,
Those who resist are punished.
The Emperor’s decree is unceasing in its pursuit.
Divine radiance shakes, myriad demons take form.
Ghostly essences are extinguished, humans attain longevity.
Swiftly, swiftly, by the Supreme Emperor’s decree!

Upon casting this talisman, next use a peach branch to inscribe it in cinnabar and affix it to the central courtyard. Then take this inscribed brick and bury it at the center of the courtyard. Finally, employ the proper method to sever mountain sprites’ brick-hurling and tile-flinging: inscribe six talismans in cinnabar and post them at the household’s entrance.

To pacify and affix the talisman, recite the Jade Emperor’s Proclamation.
While inscribing the talisman, form the Jade Emperor’s mudra, draw the qi of the Heavenly Gate, and blow it onto the talisman.

The incantation reads:
*Om hum hum*, all spirits bow their heads,
Evil demons return to rectitude.
Should any dare offend,
They shall be reduced to dust.
Swiftly, swiftly, by the decree of the statutes!

Once the pacifying talisman is affixed and the talismans are fully prepared, distribute them to each person to be placed upon their account registers. Issue talismans for each to wear. Next, provide written charms and commission divine generals for their protection, instructing the recipients to prepare offerings. Await the day of peace to perform the ritual for the divine generals, then return them to the original altar, all in proper form.

**Dissolving Karmic Entanglements**
Ordinary people are often ensnared by karmic debts and entanglements, bound in confrontation, causing the living to suffer calamities. The underworld authorities hold them accountable, and illnesses remain incurable. Those hanged or drowned, along with all karmically entangled vengeful spirits, manifest in turn, harming one another, seeking replacements.

The ritual master, having transformed into a deity and completed the pacing of the stars, faces the *xun* direction and silently petitions the Two Emperors of Divine Radiance. After orally presenting the circumstances, draw the red qi from the southeast and blow it onto the brush. Inscribe the talisman in cinnabar on a wooden board and nail it at the site of the entanglement, or bury it underground—thus achieving tranquility.

If the karmic entanglement causes severe illness, inscribe the talisman in cinnabar on yellow paper and have the afflicted swallow it. Within days, the entanglement will dissolve, and the illness will naturally resolve.

**Talisman for Resolving Karmic Entanglements**
*Charged Talisman and Incantation*

Thunder Lords and Lightning Mothers, hurling fire and molten metal.
With thunderclaps fierce and strange, they behead ghosts and expel spirits.
Those who drowned or hanged themselves—corpse grievances transmit their qi.
By a single decree of Divine Radiance, command them to ascend to heaven.
Disobey my command, and I shall sever your sins and transgressions.
*Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the decree of the Jade Pure True King of Highest Divine Radiance.*

This talisman also remedies ancestral spirits within a household who cause misfortune, unable to receive rebirth and lingering as malevolent forces. Use this talisman along with merit certificates and memorial petitions, burning them as offerings. The ancestral spirits will then attain rebirth, and the afflicted will recover. The incantation for inscribing the talisman reads:

Heaven’s prison, divine and numinous, the Controller of Destiny grants life.
Where the true decree arrives, prisons shatter and heaven is born.
*Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and decrees of the Jade Pure True King of Highest Divine Radiance.*

If treating karmic entanglements with this talisman, inscribe three copies in cinnabar and offer them to the afflicted’s life star. At the third watch, burn them to ash, mix with pure water, and consume while resting in a purified chamber. The qi of karmic entanglement ghosts and worms will naturally depart.

**Expelling Corpse Qi**
When lingering corpse qi causes misfortune, rendering homes restless, it may:
- Lure chickens or toy with dogs,
- Manifest in forms,
- Cause chaotic or nightmarish dreams,
- Induce frequent night terrors.

All such disturbances arise from corpse qi transforming into malevolent spirits. Once confirmed, follow the ancestral method: deploy three talismans of awe-inspiring divine power to expel them, and tranquility will be restored. The third talisman, when buried, carries the gravest authority—use it sparingly, for it utterly annihilates ghostly forms. Apply it judiciously, in accordance with the original method.

Another method for expelling corpse qi from a location is recorded in full detail in the relevant manuals.

**Incantation for the Three Qi Talismans of Awe-Inspiring Divine Power:**
Awe-Inspiring Divine Lords, steadfast through eons,
Shifting mountains and damming seas, even Mount Tai would topple.
Following heaven’s will, they save the myriad people.
Enacting the seal’s law, they align with the celestial heart.
Dispatching thirty thousand troops to enter my altar’s gate,
First capturing wayward ghosts, then beheading demonic spirits.
What disaster cannot be eradicated? What fortune cannot be secured?
Sealed within the talisman, they are forever reduced to dust.
Let those who carry out this command be imbued with true numinosity.
Heaven is summoned, earth is split—when the seal falls upon their door,
Heaven opens, earth cracks, and gods and ghosts tremble.
By the Heavenly Marshal, the Great Sage of Penetrating Numinosity, take charge!
*Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and decrees.*

When inscribing this talisman, recite this incantation, and its efficacy will be manifest.

**Three Qi Talisman of Awe-Inspiring Divine Power**
- **Pasted talisman:** Severs all corpse qi in places of injury or death.
- **Burned talisman:** Severs all ghosts and thieves of injury or death.
- **Buried talisman:** Eradicates all lingering corpse qi.

**Inscription on the reverse of the buried talisman:**
Sever all malevolent hauntings, deaths away from home, and injuries.
Corpse spirits, demonic ghosts, and thieving specters—depart forever to distant lands.
*In accordance with this, proceed. Swiftly, swiftly, by the Emperor’s decree.*

**Incantation of the Dotting Seal by the Ritual Master:**
Oṃ. Mighty Divine Lord, eternally sever all demonic essences.
Spirits and ghosts perish utterly; ten thousand calamities shall not arise.
Resonant with Heaven, responsive to Earth—let no misfortune linger.
*Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and decrees.*

**Alternate Incantation:**
My talisman ascends to Heaven as a celestial talisman, descends to Earth as an earthly talisman.
What spirit crafted this divine talisman?
The Perpetual Artisan of Mount Fang wrought this divine talisman; my original master wrought this divine talisman.
When my talisman alights upon the ground, all spirits hasten to rise.
*Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and decrees.*

**Incantation for the Buried Talisman:**
I am the Heavenly Master, delivering salvation to the myriad people.
By my ritual decree, my command resides in the Celestial Court.
Spirits of the land and the Six Directions, expel all demonic essences from the path.
By the Jade Purity statutes, I invoke the Northern Emperor to take charge.
*Proceed in accordance with this method.*

When deploying the talisman, press the sealing seal downward in a continuous motion—then all spirits and gods, without exception, will flee into concealment.

**Uyang Great General’s Talisman for Curing Illness**
This talisman was inscribed by General Wu, whose courtesy name is Mingda, the Master of the Uyang Cavern of the Southern Quarters under the Heavenly Pivot Institute of Supreme Purity. He commands a hundred thousand fire soldiers, riding a fire dragon, emerging from the fiery clouds of the South to inhale qi and exhale upon the brush as he writes the talisman.

**Incantation:**
Uyang, Uyang, you devour iron, you consume iron.
Feast upon the blood of the crimson phoenix of the South, inhale it into the talisman—
then gods will grieve and ghosts’ skulls will shatter.
*Uyang Talisman*

**Incantation for the Talisman’s Noon Script (Drawing Southern Qi):**
The Perfected One arrives from the South, dragons and tigers roar in fierce embrace.
Yang fire burns yin ghosts; demonic essences scatter in flight.
*Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes of the True Lord of Fire Virtue of the South, by the decree of the Great Emperor of the Vermilion Mound.*

Inscribe this talisman in cinnabar, burn it to ash, and mix it with a decoction of peach twigs for consumption.

**Qi-Character Talisman for Curing Illness**
For this talisman:
- If the pain is in the abdomen, remove one stroke from the bottom.
- If the illness is in the upper body, erase the top.
- If the illness is in the lower body, extend the brushstroke downward.

**Incantation for the Talisman’s Decree:**
I decree this numinous talisman transform into the nine-headed Southern Serpent of the Eastern Sea, devourer of rat spirits.
At dawn, consume three thousand; at dusk, eight hundred.

I invoke the statutes of the Most High. By decree!

**Silkworm-Protecting Rat-Pursuing Talisman**

**Lamp-Lighting for Karmic Response**

Whenever lighting the Dipper Lamp, form the Five-Thunder Mudra with the left hand. Once the mudra is complete, recite the Dipper Lamp Incantation. After reciting, blink the eyes three times, visualizing thunder-light filling the eyes and the house, then cast the Three-Five Thunder Mudra.

**Incantation:**
By the Emperor’s decree, the sacred lamp is lit.
The Seven Kings descend, illuminating and protecting all beings.
Left and right attendants, their majestic power made manifest.
Marshal Tianpeng, commanding the celestial soldiers.
The Five-Thunder Envoys, the Six Jia and Six Ding.
The Great Sage of Dark Warrior, the Three Stars of the Terrace.
Dispelling calamity, averting misfortune, turning death into life.
Greatly descending might, slaying and vanquishing demonic spirits.
Restoring the hun-soul to the body, pacifying the seven po.
Those who defy salvation shall perish; those who heed the decree shall prosper.
With one touch of the Dipper Lamp, the household shines with light.
*Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the Emperor’s statutes and decrees!*

When lighting the lamp, use the Emperor’s Mudra and the Five-Thunder Mudra. Recite the incantation in sequence, visualizing the myriad sages of the Dipper descending from the Heavenly Gate upon black clouds. Sincerity is essential; prayers for blessings and expiation shall be instantly answered.

For each lamp, visualize the Heavenly Ding warriors and soldiers, their attire and colors uniform. The Thirty-Six Generals and the Seven Kings of the Northern Dipper hold jade tablets. Before lighting the Dipper Lamp, perform the Yu Step, aligning the Big Dipper’s handle with *Pojun*. Then recite the names of the Northern Dipper’s Seven Stars and the incantation of the handle spirit. Only then raise the lamp, first lighting the *Ze* star, then the remaining stars. Place it beneath the *Pizi* star’s position to conduct the ritual. Observe the lamp’s brightness: if luminous, the body shall be peaceful and prosperous; if dim, misfortune shall befall. One must then earnestly offer prayers and expiatory rites to discern the auspices.

**Method for Discerning Lamp Brightness and Dimness:**
- **Body Lamp:** Bright is auspicious; dim or forming a wheel-shaped wick is inauspicious.
- **Destiny Lamp:** Bright is auspicious; a short flame forming a wheel is inauspicious.
- **Fortune Lamp:** Bright is auspicious; a long, large flame is greatly auspicious; dim is inauspicious.
- **Office Lamp:** Bright is auspicious; dim or forming three wicks is inauspicious.
- **Longevity Lamp:** Bright with a long flame is auspicious; dim or with a wick head is inauspicious.
- **Lamps for Men and Women:** A long, bright flame is auspicious; a short flame portends harm to household members.
- **Lamp for Wives and Concubines:** A long, bright flame is auspicious; a short or dim flame is inauspicious, indicating misfortune for servants.
- **Determining Lamp Color and Shape:**
  - Blue: Indicates a concealed corpse in the household, a minor inauspicious sign.
  - Red: Indicates legal troubles or bloodshed; if it crackles, there shall be sorrow.
  - White flame: Indicates mourning within the household or externally.
  - Black: Indicates great inauspiciousness.
  - Yellow: Indicates pestilence or household disasters.
  - A yellow flame also portends great misfortune.
  - If the flame forms a wheel and grows large, misfortune shall arrive.
  - A black flame is inauspicious.
  - If the flame flickers between dim and bright, it is inauspicious.
  - If the flame reaches five inches before extinguishing, the household’s master shall suffer corporal punishment or misfortune.
  - If the lamp is lit too large, it is inauspicious.
  - If one wick suddenly splits into two, it portends mourning and is inauspicious.
  - If one wick divides into three, the misfortune shall be severe.

The above method of lighting the stellar lamps may be used to pray for peace or to divine the fortunes of the household, its members, and their lives. The method involves performing the Six Harmonies nightly ritual for lighting, which may also be adapted for households. If one is afflicted by lingering illness, follow the prescribed method to light the Dipper Lamp, identifying the star lord governing one’s life, and perform rites to dispel calamities and discern auspices. If a baleful star afflicts one’s fate, expiatory rites may mitigate it.

**Lamp Diagram:**
For one’s life star, light only the Three Terraces and Seven Stars Lamps, discerning their auspices. The Three Terraces and Seven Stars Lamps are to be lit above the character for "decree."

**Expiatory Altar for Ascending to Heaven**
To construct the Altar for Ascending to Heaven, one may dissolve curses, redeem transgressions, and deliver the nine generations of ancestors. For souls of those who drowned or were wrongfully killed, or ghosts of enemies, creditors, or those owed lives or debts—whose spirits remain trapped in darkness and unable to ascend to heaven, entangling the lives of the living—this altar must be built. Record the names of the afflicted and submit them in a memorial, determining the direction and location for construction. Pray for the Emperor’s decree to command the Four Heavenly Gate Kings, the Eight Great Vajras, the Ten Directional Dharma-Protecting Deva Kings, the Six Ding and Six Jia, the Heavenly Ding warriors, the Five-Thunder Envoys, the Venerable Gods of the Northern Dipper’s Seven Stars, the Nine Luminaries, the Twenty-Eight Constellations, the Four Sage Lords of the North Pole, the Thirty-Six Great Generals, the Sage Emperors of the Five Peaks, the Ten True Lords of the Earthly Courts, the Sage Hosts of the Three Realms, and the Four Direct Merit-Officers. Pray for their divine protection to dissolve enmities, freeing them from darkness, revealing their traces and causes, and allowing them to ascend to heaven according to precedent, sparing them from harm. For good people suffering such grave misfortunes, swift recovery is possible.

The Altar for Ascending to Heaven must be erected in a pure location in the direction of the Flower Canopy. Use pure sand mixed with sweet pine and incense wine to moisten it. Construct three tiers: the top tier eight inches wide, the middle tier one foot wide, and the bottom tier one foot and two inches wide, forming a three-tiered altar. The top tier is to be covered with fine ash. Behind the altar, place a small table with offerings of wine, fruit, and fine incense. Three times daily, submit the details of the matter to the Supreme Emperor of Highest Clarity, praying for the Emperor’s decree to authorize the memorial. Upon completion of the ritual, hold a grand expiatory ceremony to repay the grace of the Three Realms’ true spirits. After the ceremony, place a wooden board behind the table, one foot long and two fingers wide, inscribed with: *"I bow my head to the Supreme Emperor of Highest Clarity."* Use genuine frankincense, lamps, candles, wine, fruit, tea, and other offerings as prescribed. Additionally, burn spirit money, cloud horses, wine, and ritual gifts for the Merit-Officers. Within the chamber, boil *mao* incense water to cleanse the area, ensuring purity, and prevent chickens, dogs, cats, or livestock from entering the altar. For the expiated enemies, prepare sutras and meritorious deeds to be offered before sending them to the Altar for Ascending to Heaven.

All the above procedures must be followed precisely, with the tablet made from peach wood and kneaded salt.

**Submitting Memorials and Presenting Petitions**
When submitting memorials or presenting petitions, first ingest the *Opening the Heart Talisman*, then the *True Talismans of the Three Clarities and Three Realms*, so that spirit and *qi* merge as one, enabling silent audience with the Supreme Emperor. Thus, the secret Dao of self-cultivation speaks of entering the gate of manifold wonders, perceiving all without obstruction—this is the way of submitting memorials and presenting petitions.

The Heavenly Worthy declares: *"Why gaze upward to the exalted sages? Let the spirits attach to me, and I to the spirits, so that the spirit ascends into the Three Heavens, allowing direct audience with the Jade Emperor, face-to-face reverence before the Mysterious Vault, naturally evoking divine response."*

**Opening the Heart Talisman**
**Three Realms Talisman** (written in cinnabar on yellow paper)
**Talisman for Commanding the Spirits Within the Body**

Each talisman is to be written in duplicate: ingest one copy first, then place the other upon the altar. Next, the officiating priest holds the memorial or *qingci* petition, while the Daoist assembly escorts it out for burning. The priest performs the *Crossing Qian and Treading the Dipper*, recites the *Purple Tenuity Incantation*, and steps the *Dipper Rite*.

A poem says:
*Kan doubled, Gen single—step to cross Qian,*
*Zhen above, double flight—Dui likewise.*
*Kun single, Li single—double step to Xun,*
*Returning via the Three Terraces, ascend to audience Heaven.*

Upon completing the *Dipper Rite*, with the *Purple Tenuity Mudra*, transform the self into the Perfected Person of the White Crane, ascending straight to the Heavenly Gate.

**Incantation for Stepping the Dipper:**
*"The image of Qian is the numinous Heaven; Kun bears its motion. Do not transgress the seasons, but cycle endlessly. Heavenly soldiers, receive my divine seal—what spirit would not submit? What ghost dare obstruct? Point to Heaven, and Heaven collapses; point to Earth, and Earth splits; point to mountains, and mountains crumble; point to water, and water ceases; point to clouds, and clouds disperse; point to trees, and trees snap; point to wind, and wind stills; point to ghosts, and ghosts perish. Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the Emperor’s law!"*

Step to Xun, burn the previously prepared talismans, then use the mudra to step the Three Terraces, proceeding directly toward the Heavenly Gate. After some time, visualize the Three Perfected Lords—Tang, Ge, and Zhou—along with attendant true officials, Merit-Officers, and courier messengers, all mounted on carriages and horses, with purple clouds and floral canopies shielding them above.

Once the memorial or petition is recited, ascend to the Heavenly Court upon a crimson *qi*. Though the passage of time seems but a moment, it is as if traversing tens of thousands of miles. The crimson *qi* and mist part on either side, revealing flawless clarity, with jeweled trees rising upward. Suddenly, as if after countless miles, a luminous yellow path appears—the Yellow Path of the Sun and Moon. Cross it, and ahead, after five or six *li*, faint purple clouds emerge. Pass through them, and the Heavenly Gate comes into view. Enter the gate, pause for a few steps, and the guardian spirit-officials also halt. Only the General Zhou and the direct courier Merit-Officer proceed to announce the transmission, heading straight to the gate of the Heavenly Master. Bow twice before the Perfected Person of the Orthodox Unity and the Great Dharma Master of the Three Heavens. Present the details of the matter, and the Heavenly Master grants assent.

Accompany the Heavenly Master to the outer gate of the Phoenix Pavilion, where a jade portal stands. Soon, a transcendent youth in vermilion robes and a dark cap emerges, taking the memorial from the transmitting jade lad and presenting it to the Most High. After a brief interval, the youth leads the officiant inside to audience. The Most High reviews the memorial, then, in accordance with the Supreme Emperor’s will, commands it be placed before the Jade Steps of the Great Clarity for approval. A young transcendent retrieves the memorial, bows at the right steps, and entrusts it to the Merit-Officers of the day. Bow nine times in reverence, then take leave of the Most High and exit the Jade Palace Gate. Bow again to the Heavenly Master, then meet the true officials who jointly submitted the memorial. Leap with joy and return to the altar where the memorial was presented.

Rise and declare the outcome. If submitting a memorial on another’s behalf, proceed only with the memorial couriers, Merit-Officers, and spirit-generals. If submitting a memorial on one’s own cultivation or merits, include the true officials and couriers of the local domain. Thus, the imperial decree is transmitted upward, and the petition is issued below, with responses manifesting immediately. This is the Dao of merging wind and spirit—it must not be spoken of to the unenlightened.

**Rite for Petitioning and Receiving Responses**
When burning the memorial, recite the incantation and visualize it rising. Envision two Heavenly Soldiers bearing the memorial upon clouds, ascending to the Heavenly Realm. To receive the response, step the Dipper and return via the Three Terraces, standing within the Dipper while visualizing the Heavenly Soldiers descending from the void to deliver the response.

For all memorials submitted to the Three Realms or petitions presented, talismanic couriers must be employed for transmission, with protective talismans and incantations used before burning.

By this decree, swiftly act!

*Respectfully executed on an auspicious day, month, and hour of the reigning Tai Sui year.*
*The Celestial Master, the Three Heavens’ Great Sage, the Supreme Minister of Grand Mystery, Zhang Zaitian.*

**Establishing the Prison to Examine Malevolent Spirits**
When establishing the prison, first prepare and submit the memorial, ensuring all is in order. Then select a chamber, determine the directional orientation, and sweep away impure *qi* with a broom of artemisia and fragrant water. Next, use fine, clean, pure ash to construct the prison—do not use hearth ash. Each section should be seven inches wide, with one inner prison positioned beneath *Liánzhēn*. The width should be one foot and two inches. Use nine new bamboo stalks, each four feet and nine inches long. Take nine pieces of white silk, each nine inches long and one inch and two *fen* wide. Measure seven inches down from the top of the bamboo and bind the silk to form the inner prison. For the central bamboo stalk, affix a paper strip inscribed with the Dharma Master’s position and the generals’ positions, measuring seven inches from the bottom upward. Finally, cover the entire structure with a bolt of black silk measuring one *zhang*.

**Prison and Talisman Formats**
When establishing the prison, choose the direction based on the month: the *zǐ* direction in the first, fifth, and ninth months; the *wǔ* direction in the second, sixth, and tenth months; the *mǎo* direction in the third, seventh, and eleventh months; and the *yǒu* direction in the fourth, eighth, and twelfth months. For new illnesses, align the *gang* handle with the monthly branch; for acute illnesses, point it toward the patient’s bedroom door, closing it by day and opening it by night. In all cases, avoid establishing the prison on *Tiānshā* days, and likewise avoid such days when dispatching malevolent spirits.

**Transforming into Divine Form and Treading the *Gang***
**Incantation:**
*"Celestial prison, numinous and divine, by the Emperor’s decree enacted. The law of the Capital of Heaven, sternly executed by writ. Seize and bind the demonic spirits—dare not show leniency! Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law!"*

**Silent Incantation:**
*(To follow)*

**Star Lords Cui, Chen, Cao, Ma, Zhang, and Xiahou.**

**Divination Formula for Verifying Ghostly Traces**
If the ghost is fierce and malevolent, its true form will appear. For yin ghosts in seclusion, their path will be revealed. If the trace resembles a chicken’s footprint, it is a *guest-death ghost*. If the size matches a human foot, it is a *wutong ghost*. If it resembles a dog’s paw print, it is a *mountain spirit ghost*. If it appears as a pair of human-like tracks, it is the *Purple-Crimson Spirit*. Traces of cats, rats, or foxes indicate *mountain spirit ghosts*. A *dragon’s tribute* marks a *earth deity*. Fully human-sized tracks belong to a *tree-dwelling ghost*. Prints of mules, horses, turtles, or snakes signify *mud deities*. Statues in altars, shrines, or temples are *local earth gods*. Goose or duck tracks denote *bloodstained death ghosts*. A rope-like path reveals a *self-hanged ghost*. Blade or axe marks indicate a *murdered ghost*. If a person dies naturally, a pair of tracks will appear beneath their natal star—this is the *Soul-Pursuing Messenger’s* response, and no harm will come to the prison. If such traces appear in this prison, but the plaintiff’s case is flawed, the plaintiff’s body will be implicated and unsettled; divination is advised. For malevolent ghosts and spirits, issue an urgent writ to summon them to the prison and compel their manifestation to await judgment. Prepare the official document and submit it to the prison bureau for execution.

**Closing the Prison Formula**
Transform into the *Demon-Quelling Court Envoy*—this is transmitted orally and mastered through heart-mind instruction. Once the ghosts and spirits have been brought to the Celestial Prison and their true forms revealed, draft the document according to the formula, dispatching divine generals to escort the malevolent ghosts and spirits to the *Mountain Court* for execution. Seal the document’s corners, place fine incense within, and prepare wine, food, paper money, and spirit horses. Reward the divine generals and soldiers, then swiftly extract the malevolent ghosts and spirits from the prison, binding them securely with the loosest restraints for observation. Command the escorting divine officials to take their positions and issue the dispatch documents. Once the prison’s decree is fulfilled, cast all into the waters to depart.

*Scroll Seven of* **Orthodox Methods of the Heavenly Heart of Upper Clarity** *begins*

**Yu Step Method**
Step with both feet in *Kan* and one in *Gen*, crossing into *Qian*;
Step forward with both in *Zhen*, and *Dui* does the same.
Step with one foot in *Kun* and both in *Li*, then into *Xun*;
Returning by the *Three Terraces*, one ascends to face Heaven.
Upon completing the steps, form the *Purple Tenuity Mudra*.
On *Qian*, transform the body and mount the white crane,
Drifting lightly until reaching the Heavenly Gate.
Face the *Imperial Lord*, present the matters of the heart, and petition for a compliant destiny as desired.

Then retrace the steps from the Heavenly Gate back to *Xun*,
Proceeding to the quiet chamber’s powdered altar.
At the *zi* and *wu* hours, first perform the Yu Step before the altar,
Then dishevel the hair and wield the sword, entering the altar’s center from *Qian*.
Sit upright on a stool, close the eyes, and intone the incantation:
*Qian* primordial, beneficial and steadfast,
Sun and moon conceal my form.
Ten thousand calamities cannot assail me,
My lifespan endures with Heaven’s years.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the law commands.

Recite again:
I am the master of the Daoist rites,
Water, fire, blades, and weapons cannot reach me,
Sickness and thieves cannot approach me.
I share the radiance of the sun and moon,
Wherever I go, all affairs prosper.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the law commands.

Then face the *Big Dipper* star and swallow the *Three Luminants Talisman*,
Silently declaring the direction and purpose as the talisman decrees.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the law commands.

Then exit from *Xun*,
At the fifth watch of the day, pay homage to the Dipper,
Draw in the upright *qi* of the Three Luminants, and swallow it into the abdomen.
Form the mudra and recite the incantation:
Supplicate the great sage of the *Heavenly Pivot*, the venerable stars of the sun and moon,
To bestow upright *qi*, infusing it into the five viscera and six bowels of your disciple [Name],
Within the eighty-four thousand pores.
Expel perverse *qi*, expel ghostly *qi*, expel the four hundred and four illnesses.
Let [Name] see perversity and perversity crumble, see ghosts and ghosts vanish, see sickness and sickness heal.
All perversities withdraw their wings,
People return to refuge, ghosts submit to subjugation.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the law commands.

**Exiting the Seal Method**
Use the middle finger to flick it out,
Visualizing the *Five Thunder Envoys*, the *Thirty-Six Generals*, the *Heavenly Ding* warriors, the *Seal-Monitoring Envoys*, their forms, attire, and regalia.
Recite the incantation:
The Heavenly Seal is numinous,
Commanded by the Jade Emperor to circulate,
Overseen by the *Master of Expelling Perversity* and the *Seal-Monitoring Envoys*,
Carried forth by the *Heavenly Ding* warriors.
Perversities hear of it and their gall shatters,
The sick see it and find peace,
Those who bring misfortune perish,
Those who bring blessings thrive.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the law commands.

**Entering the Seal Method**
Use the middle finger to hook it in.
Recite the incantation:

**Talisman Consecration Method**
Hold the talisman in the right hand, while the left hand’s thumb presses down the second, third, and fourth fingers, the thumbnail pressing the base of the little finger, securing the right sleeve. Recite the incantation:
The Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper, great deities of Heaven’s center,
Ascend to the Golden Gates, descend to cover Kunlun.
They govern the cosmic order, regulate Heaven and Earth.
Greedy Wolf, Mighty Gate, Wealth Storage, Literary Brilliance,
Integrity and Martial Brilliance, Ruinous Star and Auxiliary Star,
Encompassing the great celestial sphere, penetrating the tiniest dust.
What disaster cannot be eradicated? What blessing cannot be attained?
The primordial imperial qi descends to shield my body.
The Most High Jade Emperor, the Purple Tenuity Emperor Lord,
The essence of the Great Mystery—if worn, proclaim:
Calm the hun-soul and po-soul, guard and protect the body’s form.
The spirit-lords of the five viscera, each ensure peace.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the law commands.

**Talisman Dispatch Method**
Command [Name] Spirit to heed my words: I act by the Jade Emperor’s decree,
Aiding Heaven’s transformations, assisting the state and saving the people,
Curing illness and expelling perversities, rescuing the imperiled and upholding rectitude.
If I send you to Heaven, go directly to the celestial bureaus.
If I send you to Earth, go directly to the underworld.
If I send you to water, go directly to the watery palaces.
If I send you among humans, go at once to seize perverse demons.
Within the Three Realms, all malevolent ghosts and spirits harming people—
Regardless of rank—seize them for me.
Cure illness and expel perversities, without delay or hesitation.
Clearly receive this command; do not dare disobey.
Upon inspection, execute swiftly—go quickly, return swiftly.
I stand before the altar, sword raised in wait.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the law commands.

**Water Retrieval Method**

**Water Retrieval Method**
On the *chou* day of each month, or on days governed by Heavenly Virtue and Monthly Virtue, when celestial rain descends, collect it in a bottle. Each month, align the bottle beneath the *Huagai* constellation, directing it upward toward the Celestial Pivot. On days of Heavenly Virtue and Monthly Virtue, when the stars and constellations are distinct, present your petition. Offer spirit money and horses to the Great Sage of the Celestial Pivot, Heavenly Virtue, Monthly Virtue, and the Five Thearch Dragon Lords. Visualize the host of sages descending through the celestial gate upon black clouds, transforming and entering the water brush. Employ the mudra of your original master, followed by the mudra of the Supreme Thearch.

Recite the incantation:
*"Heavenly Virtue, Monthly Virtue, Five Thearch Dragon Lords,
Regulators of the celestial order, revered Star of the Breaking Army,
Commanding divine generals, the Six Jia and Six Ding,
Foremost in might, most sacred and efficacious.
By this decree, the divine water descends to deliver all beings.
Inscribe talismans and registers to gather and slay perverse spirits,
Cure illness and expel malevolence, annihilating their forms entirely.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the law commands."*

**Brush Consecration Method**
On *jiazi*, *gengshen*, the Six Ding, and Six Jia days—twelve days in total—bind together twelve brushes. Each brush, with its tip aligned, should measure seven *cun* and one *fen* in length. Use three tufts of purple hare’s hair, corresponding to the Three Terraces. On the *jiazi* night, when the stars and moon are clearly visible, bathe and don fresh robes. Perform the rites, burn incense, and present a memorial. Offer spirit money and horses to the Great Sage of the Celestial Pivot. Beneath the *Huagai* constellation, place twelve cups of wax tea. Form the mudra of your original master, visualize the Six Ding and Six Jia descending, transforming the brushes into twelve divine generals. First, visualize the spirit money for the local earth deity, then the Six Ding and Six Jia.

Recite the incantation:
*"Heavenly Ding warriors, Six Jia and Six Ding,
Wise and upright, wielding power most efficacious.
Demons and malevolent spirits quake in fear,
Perverse ghosts prostrate in dread.
Aid the Dao’s transformations, sweeping away perverse spirits,
Assist my methods to deliver all beings.
By this decree, the divine brush descends with swift potency,
Inscribe talismans to slay ghosts, obliterate traces and forms.
By the command of the Supreme Thearch, swiftly, swiftly, as the law commands."*

**Ink Consecration Method**
Grind two *liang* of light ink with cinnabar. Mix one *fen* each of peach oil, willow oil, and camphor oil soot. Add a small measure of clear wine, then boil with honey locust gum. Prepare this on the fifth day of the fifth month at the hour of *wu*.

Recite the incantation:
*"Six Jia and Six Ding, divine ink most efficacious,
True qi of the Five Elders, born of the Northern Thearch’s transformation,
Root of the Mysterious Origin’s Dao, slaying perverse spirits,
Human spirits purified, demonic perversities obliterated.
Inscribe talismans and present memorials, execute commands with reverence.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the law commands."*

Press the upper joint of the index finger with the thumb.

**Moon Sovereign Mudra**
Press the upper joint of the fourth finger.

**Gongcao Mudra**
From *zi* to *hai*.

**Celestial Prison Method**
For dispatching documents or inscribing talismans, first perform the Spirit-Transformation Mudra, then take three steps along the *ding*-directional *gang*. Visualize two blue-robed youths bearing sword seals standing to your left and right, while you assume the role of the Warden of the Demon-Expelling Bureau. Step through the Seven Stars *gang*, having another person follow your steps to insert bamboo stakes. Then take a left-hand cord and strike each star in turn. Inscribe the Ghost-Pursuit Talisman in cinnabar, burn five hundred strings of cash before the prison gate, and visualize the Ghost-Pursuit Talisman’s envoy in urgent haste. As the fire burns, form the Ghost-Pursuit Mudra by pressing the middle joint of the fourth finger with the thumb, then clamping the second and third fingers with the thumb. Recite the incantation:

*"Celestial Prison, spiritually potent..."*

Upon completing the incantation, form the Supreme Thearch Mudra and the Celestial *Ding* Mudra in succession. Next, inscribe: *"By the command of the Supreme Thearch."* Visualize the silk strip transforming into a swirling black cloud, which coalesces into the Northern Dipper as a dark prison, awaiting the unsheathing of the sword. Form the Unsheathed Sword Mudra. Affix the characters *"Celestial Prison"* above the chamber door. Construct the prison with lime on yang days and with earthen ash on yin days. The eight stars of the Celestial Prison should each span seven *cun*. Erect the prison beneath the *Wuqu* star, with the prison itself measuring one *chi* and two *cun* in width. Use nine green bamboo stalks, each four *chi* and nine *cun* in length. Outline the stars and prison with fine ash, and mark each position with a bamboo stake. Appoint the bamboo as the prison’s straight-standing officers. Prepare nine pieces of black silk, each nine *cun* long and one *chi*, two *cun*, and two *fen* wide. Measure seven *cun* from the bamboo stakes, tie the black silk in place, and inscribe the names of the eight stars in cinnabar upon it. Post proclamations beneath the bamboo stakes, seven *cun* from the ground. Close the prison by day and open it by night to prevent disturbance, and do not use lamps or candles. When treating illness, direct the *gang* toward the patient’s chamber. For other miscellaneous matters, point the *gang* toward the monthly branch. If after two nights no signs manifest in the Celestial Prison, reissue the proclamation to summon the divine generals.

**Living Heavenly Terrace Ritual**
Construct this in the direction of *shengqi*. Offer incense and tea, and affix a paper placard inscribed: *"By the command of the Supreme Perfected Lord of Highest Clarity: the ghosts Manda, Aqini, Niqimo, Aqia, Poloni, Tepoli, and Apiluo."* Also inscribe: *"Om hum hum, all spirits bow in reverence."* Mix sand with water infused with *gansong*, *chenxiang*, *tanxiang*, and *tanxiang* incense, then trace the characters *"Living Heavenly Terrace"* upon it. Offer five fruits and lamps, and thrice present your petition, stating: *"I humbly beseech the Supreme Perfected Lord of Highest Clarity to issue commands and act in accordance with my request."* The base should be two *chi* wide and three *cun* high; the central platform, one *chi* and five *cun* wide and two *cun* high.

The upper platform shall be one *chi* wide and one *cun* high. Place a mirror at its center on the top tier. On the middle tier, position four lamps at the four corners. Before the altar, light the Seven Star Lamps, directing their stems toward the afflicted. Offer five fruits upon a tray before the altar, and place incense and lamps in each of the four directions. Inscribe four *Duzjiang* talismans to suppress the four corners. At the rear, erect a placard three fingers in width and six *chi* in length, planted into the ground, inscribed: *"I bow in reverence to the Supreme Perfected Lord of Highest Clarity."* Additionally, take a bamboo stalk seven *chi* in length and the width of a finger, inserting it seven *cun* into the earth behind the altar. Measure seven *cun* downward from the top and strike it with a seven-*cun* length of black silk. Then, consecrate the boundary with ritual water as customarily employed. Subsequently, cast the Sword Water at the Gate of Heaven while reciting the incantation:

*"Heaven vast and azure,
Earth august and boundless.
Ghosts of lingering corruption,
Dare not lurk in concealment.
Swiftly depart this prison of mine,
Hasten to another realm.
Should any defy this command,
Be severed and cast into boiling depths.
I enact the true Dharma—
How dare evil spirits withstand?
Hasten, hasten, as decreed by law!"*

Thereafter, prepare spirit money, horses, silk offerings, and miscellaneous silks to reward the divine generals. Compose a written petition to dispel and restrain the malevolent ghosts, sending them to the Sacred Peaks for confinement and judgment. Immediately thereafter, dissolve the Heavenly Prison.

**Establishing the Floral Canopy of the Prison**
The so-called *Floral Canopy* is a method transmitted from master to master. In the first month, the *zi* direction; in the second month, the *hai* direction. Follow the ten-day cycle: during the *jiazi* cycle, the *you* direction; *jiaxu*, the *wei*; *jiashen*, the *si*; *jiawu*, the *mao*; *jiachen*, the *chou*; *jiayin*, the *hai*.
