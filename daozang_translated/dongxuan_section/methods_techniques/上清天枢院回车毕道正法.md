### *The Orthodox Methods of the Upper Clarity Heavenly Pivot Institute’s Returning Chariot and Concluding Dao, Volume One*

#### **Seal of the Nine Elders of the Upper Clarity Immortal Capital**
The Seal of the Nine Elders of the Upper Clarity Immortal Capital, when worn into the mountains, subdues wolves, tigers, and spectral beings; when crossing rivers, winds and rains align to aid passage. It commands all grotto-heavens and immortal officials. If one bears this seal, weapons cannot harm, tigers cannot wound, waters cannot drown; in times of great peril, deliverance is assured. For ordinary folk, it prolongs life, suppresses malevolent spirits, and repels all evil. To treat night terrors in children, fright-wind, and all manner of ailments in adults, burn the seal to ash and administer it with frankincense decoction—efficacy is immediate. It hastens childbirth and expels stillborn fetuses; when worn, it stabilizes pregnancy. For women without children, it brings conception. It resolves curses, redresses grievances, sharpens the mind, and fulfills all uses.

The seal measures two *cun* and two *fen* in width, perfectly square, eight *fen* thick. Its inscription consists of eight characters in two lines of stacked seal script.

---

#### **Seal of Governance and Universal Command**
The Seal of Governance and Universal Command serves as a military seal. Its bearer commands all spirits, immortals, officials, territorial deities, city gods, earth temples, and spectral soldiers across the Three Realms, regardless of rank. Worn, it carries the authority of the Celestial Emperor; all ferocious spirits submit. Without this seal, those practicing methods cannot deploy spectral troops. When the seal moves, the troops advance; when it halts, they stop. To move the seal is to move the army. If troops disobey, all—regardless of rank—are executed, as spectral enforcers ensure justice. After execution, a memorial may be submitted to the Celestial Emperor.

Thus, troops follow the seal’s turn, generals obey its commands; violations of orders incur severe penalties.

The seal measures two *cun* and two *fen* in width, perfectly square, eight *fen* thick. Its inscription consists of six characters in two lines of stacked seal script.

---

#### **Seal of the Great Heavenly Thunderfire**
The Seal of the Great Heavenly Thunderfire governs all mountains, rivers, forests, temples, altars, dragons, and *shen* across the world; when the seal stirs, thunder responds. This seal must not be used alongside others. To summon sweet rains, inscribe an iron plaque at a dragon’s abode, seal it with paper, and impress it with this seal. Have someone cast it into water, and the dragon spirit will rise at once. If waters harbor monsters, forests spawn demons, or ancient temples invite disaster, draft a document, affix the seal, and impress it—waterborne creatures will perish, temples collapse, forests wither, or be consumed by celestial fire and lightning.

The seal measures two *cun* and two *fen* in width, perfectly square, eight *fen* thick. Its inscription consists of six characters in two lines of stacked celestial seal script.

---

#### **Seal of the Intendant of City Gods**
The Seal of the Intendant of City Gods confers the office of Intendant of City Gods, acting on Heaven’s behalf. Those appointed must possess this seal; without it, they cannot traverse the world. Wherever the city god travels, yin officials report, and spectral escorts attend. Assigned assistant soldiers and clerics accompany them through mountains, forests, temples, and across rivers or seas. Day and night, subordinate troops remain at their side. All petitions to city gods require this seal for immediate response. If city god troops fail to arrive or disobey, a memorial may be submitted to the Celestial Emperor to demote or relocate them according to law.

The seal measures two *cun* and two *fen* in width, perfectly square, eight *fen* thick. Its inscription consists of six characters in two lines of stacked celestial seal script.

---

#### **Seal of the Upper Clarity Heavenly Pivot Institute**
The Seal of the Upper Clarity Heavenly Pivot Institute serves as the bureau for memorials to the Three Heavenly Gates of Upper Clarity. For mortals practicing methods, submitting memorials to celestial courts, or issuing directives to spirits of the middle and lower realms, this seal is essential. Excluding the Celestial Emperor, memorials may be submitted to all—from the Five Peaks and famous mountains of the middle realm to the gods of Fengdu in the lower realm, regardless of rank. Worn, it dispels evil; ingested, it cures illness. Wherever it travels, all spirits submit, and spectral attendants accompany its bearer.

The seal measures one *cun* and eight *fen* in width, one *cun* and nine *fen* in length. Its inscription consists of six characters in two lines of stacked seal script.

---

#### **Seal of the Great Master of Heavenly Methods**
The Seal of the Great Master of Heavenly Methods commands all spectral beings and the Six Grotto Demon Kings. Wherever malevolent spirits wreak havoc, dragons or *shen* stir calamity, or harm befalls the people, all talismans and registers require this seal. For those wronged by curses, ancestral spirits, or karmic debts of life or wealth, wearing this seal keeps vengeful spirits at bay and wards off evil karma. It dispels nightmares, harmonizes all affairs, cures chronic ailments, prolongs life, prevents poisoning, and averts the Nine Worms.

Ingested regularly, it eradicates long-standing illnesses.

To expel stillborn fetuses or hasten childbirth, burn the seal to ash and ingest it.

The seal measures one *cun* and eight *fen* in width, one *cun* and nine *fen* in length, its inscription consisting of six characters in two lines of stacked seal script.

**Vermilion Luminous Divine Talisman of Supreme Purity**
*Scattered Form* | *Gathered Form*

The Vermilion Luminous Divine Talisman of Supreme Purity is the true *qi* of the Seven Primordial Lords of the Northern Dipper, naturally assuming form. Issued by the Celestial Pivot Bureau of Supreme Purity, it may shatter demonic shrines, expel evil, enter plague-ridden zones, and repel epidemics.

Worn constantly, it shields the body, rendering all malevolence powerless to assail; spirits behold it as a towering mountain of fire.

Regular ingestion sharpens the mind, prevents malignant ailments, neutralizes poisons, and grants fearlessness before blades.

It cures all manner of grave illnesses and alleviates pain. It treats madness, night terrors in children, convulsions, and febrile seizures; ensures safe pregnancies, hastens labor, expels stillborn fetuses, dispels ghostly *qi* and spectral pregnancies, eliminates the Three Corpses, and severs demonic unions. Steeped in decoctions, its efficacy is unfailing.

To inscribe this talisman, form the mudra with the left hand by pressing the *wu* finger upward while reciting the incantation:

*Incantation:*

The Seven Perfected of the Northern Dipper, great deities of the celestial center.
Above, they ascend to the Golden Gates; below, they overspread Kunlun.
They regulate the cosmic net and govern the framework of Heaven and Earth.
Greedy Wolf, Giant Gate, Wealth Storage, Literary Star,
Integrity and Chastity, Martial Star, Breaking Army, and the Auxiliary Star.
They encompass the great celestial realm, penetrating even the tiniest speck of dust.
What disaster do they not eradicate? What blessing do they not bestow?
The primordial imperial *qi* comes to merge with my body.
Wherever the Celestial Pivot points, it revolves day and night without cease.
Those who dwell apart from petty men, who seek the Dao and pursue the Perfected,
shall constantly behold the august countenance and be granted longevity.
The Most High Jade Emperor, the Purple Tenuity Emperor Lord.
The Three Terraces gave me birth, the Three Terraces nurtured me,
the Three Terraces protected me, □□□□□□□.

*Incantation:*
Qian, the Creative, is strong and unswerving.
Sun and moon are my soldiers.
The divine talisman enters the five viscera,
forever preserving peace and tranquility.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the Highest Clarity’s statutes and commands.

**The Divine Talisman of the Nine Prisons of Highest Clarity**
The Divine Talisman of the Nine Prisons of Highest Clarity is employed to remedy spectral and demonic harms afflicting the human realm, where malevolent toxins and inauspicious omens arise.
It governs doors opening and closing, wells and springs surging and boiling, household pots and cauldrons emitting eerie sounds, insects and rodents behaving strangely, and all manner of apparitions manifesting in forms and shadows, driving people to madness, inflicting chronic illness, and confining them to bed, where remedies prove ineffective.
Beneath the dwelling, foul and putrid ghosts and defiling spirits persist unceasingly.
Present a written petition to this court for endorsement.
Inscribe the talisman on an iron plate with raw cinnabar, following the prescribed method, and bury it beneath the dwelling’s ground.
To establish the Fengdu Prisons, use a piece of yellow silk, one foot and two inches in length and seven inches in width, inscribe the talisman upon it, and affix it within the prison.
If water spirits cause mischief, cast the talisman into the water.
For iron plates, larger ones measure two feet and four inches in length and one foot and two inches in width; smaller ones measure one foot and two inches in length and seven inches in width. Inscribe them accordingly.
This talisman must be drawn on a *wu* day; it may not be drawn on other days.
While inscribing, stand in a *ding*-shaped stance, ensuring no one witnesses the process.
Form the mudra with the left hand by pressing the thumb against the middle joint of the middle finger, recite the incantation, and then inscribe the talisman.

*Incantation:*
Spirits of the Nine Prisons, great deities of Fengdu,
Zhang and Ma, the Four Poisons, subdue and capture demonic spirits.
Golden nets and iron webs enclose and seize perverse essences.
By the edict of the Three Heavenly Emperors, the law is strictly enforced.
The earth gods of the nine provinces and the local deities dispatch their troops.
Wind, fire, thunder, and lightning reduce ghosts to dust.
With a hundred thousand, ten thousand, a thousand legions,
black winds and fire bells resound.
The prison is named Great Fire—none escape to be reborn.
Iron lions and bronze dogs devour your forms.
With the first stroke, Heaven and Earth are inscribed;
with the second, essences are extinguished;

*Incantation:*
Spirits of the Nine Prisons of Fengdu,
by the Emperor’s decree, they are dispatched.
Those who dare disobey shall be punished by the soldiers of the Five Peaks.
The Six Ding and Six Jia spirits seize them; the steps of the Dipper and Pivot are merciless.
The edict is entrusted beneath the Pivot Star—no ghost retains its form.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the Highest Clarity’s statutes and commands.

Recite the incantation seven times, spray water seven times upon the talisman, and release the mudra.

**The Divine Talisman of Thunder Duke of Highest Clarity**
The Divine Talisman of Thunder Duke of Highest Clarity is employed to remedy pestilential *qi*, miasmic *qi* from mountains and mists, the five types of *gu* poison, consumptive illnesses, mountain spirits and demonic entities, violent and unrestrained wandering dead, lingering corpses and ancient anomalies, those who drowned, hanged themselves, died in battle, by poison, or in childbirth, as well as wandering spirits of forests and trees that afflict the dwelling’s earth, and deities worshipped by others who have been sent but refuse to depart, or graves that bring forth calamities.
Present a written petition to this court for endorsement, and deliver it to the local earth god before inscribing the talisman on an iron plate.
This talisman consists of five strips, to be buried in the five directions.
Ghosts and spirits will perceive only thunder and fire engulfing the dwelling, leaving them no place to enter, or the afflicted household may dream of their home being consumed by fire.
In households struck by pestilence, the afflicted will see great flames and experience a frenzied state, but upon breaking into a cold sweat, they will immediately recover.
If ancient temples harbor inauspicious omens or forests and trees become instruments of harm to the people, inscribe one talisman and bury it beneath the temple or trees. The temple will crumble on its own, and the forest will wither; otherwise, heavenly fire will consume them.
If water harbors anomalies, inscribe one talisman and cast it into the water. The anomaly will vanish, the ghost will be driven away, and a dragon will arise.
Iron plates must be forged on a *water* day and inscribed on a *fire* day.
The iron plate measures one foot and four inches in length and eight inches in width.
Inscribe it within a purified chamber, stepping the *ding*-Pivot three times. Form the mudra with the left hand by pressing the *fire* day’s palace, using the *chen* position as the seal, recite the incantation, and inscribe the talisman.

*Incantation:*
Thunder Duke of the Capital Heaven, who summons clouds and shakes the winds.
Green thunder with crimson *qi* penetrates the nine palaces.
Crimson thunder with white *qi* ascends to the highest heavens.

The Earl of Wind and the Master of Rain drive lightning and consume winds.
Where the divine talisman arrives, no perverse ghost remains.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the Highest Clarity’s statutes and commands.

After reciting the incantation fourteen times, the talisman is complete. Bury it beneath the dwelling’s ground.

*Incantation:*
Great Thunder Duke of the Capital Heaven,
whose thunderclaps transform the empty void.
Three hundred thousand blades and soldiers scatter in the crimson cavern.
Those who dare disobey shall face the stern decree without mercy.
Entrusted beneath the Pivot Star, they become forever pure and serene winds.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the Highest Clarity’s statutes and commands.

Recite the incantation eighty-one times, spray water nine times upon the talisman, and release the mudra.

**The Divine Talisman of Fire Bells of Highest Clarity**

The **Divine Talisman of Fire Bells of Highest Clarity** addresses women who fail to conceive, suffer unstable pregnancies, or miscarry within three to five months; those whose children do not survive past one or two years; and cases where despite extensive prayers and offerings, no remedy proves effective. Such afflictions are no ordinary matter. They may arise from adverse *fengshui* in the household, malign influences from ancestral graves, lingering *fushi* (buried corpses) in the dwelling, inauspicious wells or stoves, ritual transgressions, baleful stellar deities, marital incompatibility in the couple’s destinies, ancestral wrongdoing, past-life neglect of descendants, or offenses against parents by one’s own forebears—or from uncleanliness within the home.

To ensure robust offspring and longevity, strict abstinence is required: on the new and full moons, the waxing and waning quarters, the four seasons and eight solar terms, the *jiazi* and *gengshen* days, during great winds or rains, extreme cold or heat, after excessive eating or drinking, under the stars and moon, before well and stove deities, amid thunder and lightning, when auspicious clouds appear, or during solar and lunar eclipses—all such times demand restraint from conjugal relations. Adherence to these precepts ensures stable conception, perfect features in the child, and extended blessings of fortune and longevity. Failure to comply, even if the firstborn survives, will result in ugliness, poverty, or premature death.

For such cases, submit a written petition to this institute for endorsement. Inscribe the talisman as prescribed, and have the couple wear it. Within a month, auspicious dreams will herald conception, and a noble child will be born. Even after birth, ensure the child wears this talisman to remain free from illness, enjoy lasting fortune and longevity, and be shielded from malevolent spirits and all harm.

If inscribed on iron or wooden plaques of any size, burned with incense, and venerated, the talisman also repels plagues and fire disasters. Write it in cinnabar, pressing the left thumb to the *yin* position while forming the mudra, and recite the incantation as you inscribe it. Those who wear or venerate it will be protected by celestial envoys and spirit officials.

*Incantation:*
Great Fire Bells of the Void,
overseeing life in the highest heavens.
Holding the registers, wielding the ledgers,
Han Gong, who cherishes life.
The Five Emperors shatter souls,
the Three Terraces bestow fates.
The Seven Primes assist the *po*,
the divine origin upholds the lineage.
Corpse-ghosts disperse and converge,
no ghost shall be left destitute.
They receive human destinies,
slaying evil and banishing traces.
By decree of Heaven, eternally granted,
they dwell in the immortal palace.
The Great Spirit of Emptiness,
severing evil and expelling misfortune.
The Nine Heavens’ Controller of Destinies,
ordains the Primordial Ancestor.
Inscribing life’s roots,
enlightening human transcendence.
Cutting off rebellious ghosts,
slashing away evil trails.
The divine talisman shelters,
its true form in purple clouds.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the Highest Clarity’s statutes and commands.

Recite the incantation twenty-one times to complete the inscription.

*Additional Incantation:*
The Great Fire Bells of the Celestial Circuit,
preserving life and extending years.
The Three Corpses all disperse,
the Numinous Treasure guards eternal life.
They reject the destitute and lawless,
seeking only the perfection of the Dao.
Suppressing the Three Yellow Chapters,
the Five Peaks in azure emptiness.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the Highest Clarity’s statutes and commands.

Recite the incantation thirty-six times, spray water once upon the talisman, and release the mudra.

**The Divine Talisman of Ding and Jia of Highest Clarity**
The **Divine Talisman of Ding and Jia of Highest Clarity** remedies transgressions against the Grand Year (*Taisui*), earth deities, and *tufu* spirits; or when others’ construction projects cause *feitu* (flying earth) to afflict the dwelling. It also addresses burial offenses against mountain spirits, adverse *fengshui*, frequent calamities, genital sores in women, repeated scalds or burns, chronic illness unresponsive to medicine, baleful stars aligning with one’s fate, causing confusion, procrastination, restless dreams, and household unrest. It counters *cixiongsha* (male-female killing stars), funeral processions, curses from others, persistent illness, mental agitation, and family members afflicted by madness. It dispels *fushi* (lingering corpses), malevolent entities, self-inflicted harm, nocturnal apparitions, lanterns lit or fires set by unseen hands, terrorizing of women and children, and inexplicable loss of wealth.

**The Divine Talisman of the Seven Primes of the Northern Dipper of Highest Clarity**
The **Divine Talisman of the Seven Primes of the Northern Dipper of Highest Clarity** remedies the lingering consequences of past evil deeds, ancestral curses, and transmitted consumptive illnesses that spread contagiously, defying all medical treatment, until the body withers and the limbs waste away. If one’s fate is not yet exhausted, the affliction may first pass to descendants, perpetuating an unending cycle of suffering.

Thus did the Celestial Emperor take pity, bestowing this sacred talisman. Have it transcribed in seal script and burned to ashes. Take seven willow twigs, each carved with the character for "child," and steep them in ashless wine. Drink three doses daily, and within ten days the worms shall perish, and the body gradually restore itself. Those afflicted with such conditions must submit a written petition to this institute, where their circumstances shall be recorded and presented to the Celestial Emperor. A memorial shall also be dispatched to the sacred mountains and rivers to seek absolution. Only then may this talisman be transcribed, given to the sufferer, and swallowed according to the prescribed method. Additionally, transcribe twenty-one copies of this talisman, affix them to the four corners of the dwelling, and carry one on the person. Auspicious dreams shall soon follow, and the Perfected Ones of the Highest Clarity shall descend with true qi to guard the body. Wearing this talisman ensures protection of life, defense of the person, averts misfortune, and secures great fortune for the household.

**The Divine Talisman of the Three Terraces of Highest Clarity**

Seven Lords of the Great Primal,
drive misfortune away for me.
True qi receives thunder and fire,
the Old Duke subdues the fire’s glow.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the Highest Clarity’s statutes and commands.

Recite the incantation twenty-one times, spray water once upon the talisman, and release the mudra.

Here ends the first scroll of *The Orthodox Methods of the Highest Clarity’s Celestial Pivot Court’s Returning Chariot Dao*.
Here begins the second scroll of *The Orthodox Methods of the Highest Clarity’s Celestial Pivot Court’s Returning Chariot Dao*.

**Method for Directing Qi**

At a place of utmost sincerity, face the sun and burn incense. Look up and pray:

*"[State your rank and name], reverently addressing the Great Sun Emperor: I, [your name], practice the Orthodox Methods of the Highest Clarity’s Celestial Pivot Court to relieve the suffering of all people and direct qi to pacify spirits. Today, I humbly beseech your compassion, that you bestow true qi into my body. May my Mud-Pill Palace, all joints, the five viscera, and six bowels be filled and brimming with its vastness. In treating all living beings, may there be no failure."*

Conclude with focused devotion. Strike the Heavenly Drum seven times, open your eyes toward the sun, and press the third joint of each middle finger with your thumbs. Draw in a breath of qi from the sun and swallow it. Recite the incantation seven times, then swallow a second breath. Press your right hand again, recite the incantation seven times, and take in a third breath. Cross both hands before your mouth, recite the incantation seven times, then draw in true qi and blow it onto the two mudras. Repeat this cycle three times in full.

The incantation reads:
*"Wind-pain departs with the wind,
qi-pain vanishes with the qi."*

For those afflicted, have them sit in the southeast, facing northwest. The practitioner stands in the northwest, facing southeast, seated opposite. Instruct the patient to press firmly on the painful area without releasing. First, have them cough once, then draw in a breath of qi—do not swallow it yet. Assume the mudra as before, recite the incantation seven times, then have them cough again, swallow the qi, and recite the incantation once more. For mild cases, three to five repetitions suffice; for severe cases, five to seven. Efficacy is certain.

**Method for Enchanting Water**

Purify the mind and focus the intent. Press the center of each palm with the middle fingers and invoke the twenty-eight constellations of the five directions:

*"Reverently summon the true form of the star essence of Horn and Neck in the East, wielding swords and talismans to guard my body.
Reverently summon the true form of the star essence of Well and Ghost in the South, wielding swords and talismans to guard my body.
Reverently summon the true form of the star essence of Straddler and Harvester in the West, wielding swords and talismans to guard my body.
Reverently summon the true form of the star essence of Dipper and Ox in the North, wielding swords and talismans to guard my body.
Reverently summon the true form of the Yellow Essence of the Seven Stars of the Center, wielding swords and talismans to guard my body.
May the true qi of the five directions enter this water."*

This is no ordinary water—it is the natural water of the Highest Clarity’s Boundless Dao, capable of dispelling illness and rescuing from suffering. Wherever a drop of this water falls, all becomes pure. If a true spirit touches it, their divine power expands. If a demonic entity touches it, their body burns as if consumed by fire. This water is formed from the true qi bestowed by the Perfected of the Upper Heavens. What evil would not submit? What ghost would dare appear? Those who oppose me shall die; those who turn away shall perish. Where this divine water arrives, the myriad ghosts hide in submission.

The incantation reads:
*"Kui-Yuan, Qian-Yuan, Li-Zhen, You-Zhen.
Supreme Void, I invoke your decree,
Gate of Kunlun’s Heavenly Portal.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the Highest Clarity’s statutes and commands."*

Recite it twenty-one times. Sprinkle this water to cleanse all defilements; swallow talismans with it, and none will fail to respond. During epidemics, sprinkle it inside and outside dwellings. For the sick, boil it into decoctions or powders—its efficacy is undeniable, and there is no purpose for which it cannot be used.

**Method for Extracting Consumptive Worms**

For those suffering from corpse-transmitted illness within one hundred and twenty days, first earnestly invite a Zhengyi Daoist to perform a three-day jiao ritual. Prepare three talismans and administer them to the patient as follows.

On the fourth day, prepare a cauldron with at least five *jin* of heated oil and a bolt of white silk to bind the patient to a pillar. Use three left-spun silk threads, each four *chi* and four *cun* long. Affix one talisman to each thread on a peachwood stick, and have the patient swallow them with ginseng decoction. One thread is held steady as the talisman draws the thread into the abdomen. Use a ruler to pry open the patient’s mouth, swiftly pull out the talisman, and the worm will be upon it. Repeat this three times to extract three worms, which will shriek as they fall into the oil and fry. Only then is the patient safe. If only one or two worms are extracted, death is certain.

**First Talisman**
Use a half-*cun* square of silk, inscribed in cinnabar. Form the mudra with the left hand on the *wu* position, recite the incantation, and seal it in a wax pill. Administer at the *chou* hour of the first day with frankincense decoction. Recite the incantation three times to complete the inscription.

The incantation reads:
*"Divine spirits of the Three Lights of Heaven,
grant me the mandate of life.
By this decree, I sever you—
the calamity arrives, the method is executed."*

**Second Talisman**
Use a half-*cun* square of silk, inscribed in cinnabar. Form the mudra with the left hand on the *shen* position, recite the incantation, and seal it in a wax pill. Administer at the *wu* hour of the second day with frankincense decoction. Recite the incantation three times to complete the inscription.

The incantation reads:
*"Originally, you harmed me—
now I expel and unite with you.
Like all flying heavens,
you wander as corpse-drinking ghosts."*

**Third Talisman**
Use a half-*cun* square of silk, inscribed in cinnabar. Form the mudra with the left hand on the *hai* position, recite the incantation, and seal it in a wax pill. Administer at the *hai* hour of the third day with frankincense decoction. Recite the incantation three times to complete the inscription.

The incantation reads:
*"Great Lord of the Supreme Dao,
receive my protection of this form.
Auspicious blessings descend with the Heavenly Talisman,
the Great One unites with the Primordial Perfected."*

---

**Method for Treating Illness**

The illness may be treated after seven days of onset. When it flares, press the center of each palm with the middle fingers while observing the patient. Recite the incantation seven times, have the patient cough once, and draw in a breath of qi toward the wall, reciting the incantation three times over it. Instruct the patient to avoid the five pungent foods and toxic substances for seven days.

The incantation reads:
*(Untranslated fragments follow as given in the original:)*
*"Talisman for Pacifying Silkworm Spirits (to be affixed inside the silkworm chamber)
Talisman for Securing the Household
Talisman for Dispersing Swelling and Toxins"*

For swellings and toxins that have reached seventy or eighty percent severity, treatment is still possible. The method: place the finger-tally on the *wu* position of the left hand, press firmly on the painful area, and recite the incantation:

*"You are toxin—how dare you harm human flesh?
I now dispatch you to the Blade Ridge."*

*"Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and command!"*

Recite the incantation seven times, then shift the finger-tally and have the patient cough once. Draw in a breath of *qi* and blow it onto the ground, then extinguish it with the foot.

**Method for Treating Pestilence**
The treatment of pestilence follows established ritual protocols. Upon entering the door, first press the center of each palm with the middle fingers and recite:

*"Seal the Heavenly Eye—let no ghost or spirit see."*

This is the method for deploying *qi* for the patient. Before the patient’s dwelling, declare:

*"Plague Year King, Disease Enforcer:
This child has strayed from the Dao/Way.
Heaven has sent you to patrol.
Now this child repents and returns to the Great Dao/Way.
I have memorialized the Celestial Emperor and filed a petition with the City God.
If this is not by Heaven’s talismanic summons, then swiftly withdraw your medicinal toxins and *qi* toxins.
Do not linger, for Heaven’s pardon is imminent.
Disobedience will not be tolerated.
Swiftly comply!"*

**Method for Treating Ghostly Afflictions**
For the patient’s body, the exact year, month, day, and hour of birth must be obtained. Hold a sword in the right hand, first form the finger-tally, then press the tally on the year position and recite the incantation forty-nine times. Spray a mouthful of water onto the patient’s body.

If the condition lightens, cease treatment. If not, shift the tally to the position of the birth month and recite the incantation forty-nine times, spraying water onto the patient’s body. If the affliction has not fully receded, proceed to the birth day and birth hour, repeating the method in sequence until a response is achieved.

The incantation reads:
*"By Heaven’s amnesty, swiftly sever evil!
Swiftly slay, swiftly bind!"*

If the birth month, day, or hour is unknown, use the *zi* position for those born in the *zi* hour. This is the "Four Heavenly Stabs" method for binding evil. Additionally, administer the Northern Dipper’s Seven Origins Talisman and the Three Terraces Talisman with frankincense decoction.

**Herbal Spirit Elixir Formula for Heart and Blood Afflictions**
Ingredients:
Seven divine peaches, half a *liang* of frankincense, half a *liang* of cinnabar, half a *liang* of sour jujube kernels, half a *liang* of tangkuei, half a *liang* of rehmannia, half a *liang* of realgar.

Grind the seven ingredients into powder, form into pills with wax the size of *wutong* seeds. Take twenty-one pills per dose, along with seven talismans. Select the appropriate talisman at the time and incorporate it into the pill. For children and men, administer with rush pith decoction; for women, with safflower decoction.

**Secret Method for Managing Madness and Severing Ghostly Influences**
Those born in the Lower Era who commit myriad transgressions—arrogance, indulgence in lust and killing, habitual slander, filial impiety, miserliness, and insatiable greed—generate deluded thoughts. Such thoughts disturb the spirit, giving rise to vexation, false imaginings, and bodily suffering. Thus, malevolent entities seize the opportunity to invade, exploiting the vulnerabilities. Essence-corrupting demons, lower ghosts, and a thousand specters assail the form and soul, causing erratic laughter, unsteady moods, disorientation, or singing and dancing, weeping and wailing. Excessive eating, loss of propriety, and disregard for social norms may ensue. These afflictions may also arise from restless graves, careless ancestral rites, inauspicious dwellings, or the calamity of felling sacred trees. One must not remain ignorant of these causes.

By examining the symptoms, the source may be discerned.

Heart afflictions pertain to fire—manifesting as flushed complexion, loud laughter and shouts, frequent anger, and rare joy. Liver afflictions pertain to wood—manifesting as a greenish hue, excessive drinking, and unceasing sorrow. Lung afflictions pertain to metal—manifesting as a pale complexion, brandishing blades to commit violence, and constant talk of fighting and killing. Spleen afflictions pertain to earth—manifesting as a yellowish hue, excessive eating, and incessant boasting. Kidney afflictions pertain to water—manifesting as erratic sorrow, frequent tearing of clothes, hanging head and gnashing teeth, or a shamefaced demeanor. These are the signs of the five viscera assailed by malevolent forces. First, one must perform rituals and administer talismanic remedies. Then, according to the affected viscus, apply medicinal treatment—none shall fail to take effect.

**Identifying Ghostly Malevolence:**
Glaring eyes and gnashing teeth with ferocity—these are ghosts of self-inflicted harm.
Singing, dancing, shouting, and laughing—these are mountain specter ghosts.
Calling upon spirits and ghosts, biting objects—these are wandering deceased ghosts.
Moods shifting between anger and joy—these are shrine and temple ghosts.
Gnashing teeth and wailing, voices as if enduring pain—these are drowned ghosts.
Fearful of living people—these are essence-devouring ghosts.
Averse to daylight and ashamed of brightness—these are ghosts of blood-death or difficult childbirth.
Prone to roaming—these are tree spirits.
Seeking death through self-harm—these are ghosts of grievance and debt.
Inclined to excessive sleep—these are ghosts of prison death.

As for those who recite or read scriptures yet treat them with disdain;
Sighing and groaning, troubled in heart and qi, speaking deceitfully;
Losing resolve and singing or dancing, moods shifting between anger and joy—
these too are signs of ghostly malevolence.

To examine ghostly afflictions, follow this method—none shall prove false. To discern whether one is ill or not, observe the eyes: if they gaze upward, turning green or white, and appear unusually clear, there is no affliction; if they seem normal, it is all deception.

**Treating Madness and Malevolence:**
First, have the afflicted submit a written statement. Next, secure the local deities’ protection, file a petition with the city god of the jurisdiction, and dispatch divine officers and soldiers for defense. Then, enter the Dipper to embody the self, perform the ritual with full dignity, and proceed to examine the afflicted. Follow the prescribed methods strictly, without indulging personal inclinations. When addressing the afflicted, instruct them gently and soothingly, lest their spirit be harmed—this prevents violent outbursts and preserves their inherent nature.

**Secret Ritual for Entering the Dipper and Embodying the Self:**
When treating ghosts of madness and ferocity, one must purify the heart and bathe in ritual purity before proceeding. Upon arrival, remain focused, lest crude and ignorant ghosts, lacking understanding, dare to disobey, leading to a loss of dignity and profaning the mandate of the Supreme Emperor. Though it may take time, they will ultimately be captured—such is the nature of ritual practice.

For each ritual performance, face east and burn incense. Stand upright and centered, using the thumbs to form the Shangqing mudra, tracing from the back of the head to the brow; then separate the hands and lower them straight before the chest, clasping the waist. Silently recite the incantation:

*"Within my body, the Attendant Functionaries, I summon forth the twelve hours of my body, the twenty-four yang breaths, the seventy-two seasonal nodes, the three hun souls on the left, the seven po souls on the right, the twelve thousand spirits of radiant essence, the twenty-two thousand spirits of form and shadow, the thirty-three thousand spirits of the pores, the spirit of the heart, the spirit of the spleen, the spirit of the lungs, the spirit of the liver, the spirit of the kidneys—all arrayed in dignity. Grant me auspicious fortune, bestow upon me the Great Dao, and transform my body into that of the Great Exorcist of the Thirty-Six Caverns of the Mystic Capital of Shangqing, crowned with the Far-Wandering Cap, robed in crimson silk, holding the jade tablet, shod in vermilion. Seated upon the Jade Bureau, may you, divine spirits, guard my left and right. Above, let the red light shield me; below, let auspicious clouds encircle me. Proceed to the home of so-and-so in such-and-such place to investigate malevolent ghosts, cure illness, and eradicate evil, compelling all wicked demons to self-destruct and all ferocity to vanish, cutting away sickness. May the Southern Numinosity protect me, and my form be transformed into the Jade Void."*

*"Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and decrees of Shangqing!"*

After the incantation, face east and spray a mouthful of water over the body. Burn incense again, face south, and click the teeth. State your rank and name, then invoke:

*"Star Lord of the Southern Pole Heavenly Mansion,
Star Lord of the Southern Pole Heavenly Appearance,
Star Lord of the Southern Pole Heavenly Beam,
Star Lord of the Southern Pole Heavenly Union,
Star Lord of the Southern Pole Heavenly Pivot,
Star Lord of the Southern Pole Heavenly Mechanism,
Star Lord of the Southern Pole Myriad Longevities,
Lady of the Three Luminaries of the Southern Pole,
Fire-Bell General of the Southern Pole—*

*Your servant, so-and-so, today observes auspicious fortune and maintains perpetual purification, cultivating boundless practice to deliver beings and save the world, dispelling evil and vanquishing malevolence to establish rectitude. Humbly beseech the Star Lords of the Southern Mansion to bestow divine radiance and guard my form. May three thousand attendants and the Fire-Bell General descend to protect my body, granting me longevity."*

*"Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and decrees of Shangqing!"*

After the incantation, click the teeth and proceed with the ritual steps, reciting the name of one Star Lord with each step of the Dipper:
*"Star Lord of the Heavenly Mansion,
Star Lord of the Heavenly Appearance..."*

Star Lord of the Heavenly Mechanism,
Star Lord of the Heavenly Union,
Star Lord of the Heavenly Pivot,
Star Lord of the Heavenly Beam.

Upon completing the steps, grasp the sword and recite the incantation:
*"Day-Functionary Messenger of [this] day, I dispatch you to ascend to Heaven—swiftly reach the Heavenly Gate.
I dispatch you to enter the Earth—swiftly reach the Earthly Portal.
I dispatch you to enter the Waters—swiftly reach the Watery Mansion.
Now, I do not dispatch you to ascend to Heaven, nor to enter the Earth, nor to enter the Waters.
I dispatch you swiftly to [such-and-such] place, to the household of [so-and-so],
to notify the Controller of Destiny, the Local Earth God, the relevant deities, the *qi* spirits,
along with the city god of this jurisdiction and the soldiers and generals sent forth,
to command them to defend this site and come forth to examine the illness of [so-and-so].
You must be meticulous and strict, allowing no defilement to touch, lest dignity be lost."*

Next recite:
*"Heavenly numen, Earthly numen—Heaven and Earth unite in convergence.
Functionary spirits and generals, you may not tarry.
Go swiftly, return swiftly—I await you before the altar, sword planted in readiness.
Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and decrees of Shangqing!"*

Upon finishing the incantation, plant the sword into the ground, interlock the fingers of both hands, and shout: *"Go!"*

When entering the afflicted person’s home, upon crossing the threshold, remove your headscarf at once upon seeing anyone, proceed directly to the main hall, and sit upright. As you take your seat, press the middle fingers of both hands into your palms to form the mudra, exhale a breath of *qi* to the four directions, and recite:
*"I am the grandson of the Primordial August One, the child of the Most High.
The Northern Dipper is at my command; I tread the Yu Steps, sent forth by the Heavenly Officers.
To my left attends the Azure Dragon, to my right the White Tiger.
The Three Clarities’ Lords secretly deploy true *qi*.
Should any demonic *qi* or perverse ghosts refuse to submit,
the Golden Net and Iron Web shall consign them to Fengdu for execution.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the statutes!"*

Recite this seven times, then draw in a breath from all around and exhale it into your cupped hands. Press the mudra again until it pains, and recite:
*"Heaven is my father, Earth my mother,
the Sun and Moon my brothers, the Seven Stars my friends.
The Generals of the Six Jia wield axes,
the Earthly Jia Generals sternly bear gongs and drums.
The Three Terraces lead the way; the Avian Constellations follow as messengers.
I am Heaven’s servant, sent forth by Heaven’s command.
I sever evil, devour demons, bind malevolence, and capture ghosts.
My pointing and calling are as decrees; I regulate the *qi* of the firm.
By the talismanic command of Highest Heaven, all earth gods must hasten to comply.
Swiftly, swiftly, carry this out!"*

*[East]*

East:
The Azure Emperor and Azure Youth Lord of the East, wielding gongs and striking drums, swiftly bind the demons that stir malevolence, casting them into the Golden Net Prison. Let them suffer punishment without mercy, and swiftly bring the case to judgment. As before, they receive the talismanic command of Heaven. Gaze toward the East and shout: *"Begone!"*

South:
The Vermilion Emperor and Vermilion Youth Lord of the South, wielding thunder and lightning, swiftly bind the demons that stir malevolence, casting them into the Endless Prison. Let them suffer grievous punishment without mercy, and swiftly bring the case to judgment. As before, they receive the talismanic command of Heaven. Gaze toward the South and shout: *"Begone!"*

West:
The White Emperor and White Youth Lord of the West, wielding battle-axes, swiftly bind the demons that stir malevolence, casting them into the Drowning Sea Prison. Let them suffer punishment without mercy, and swiftly bring the case to judgment. As before, they receive the talismanic command of Heaven. Gaze toward the West and shout: *"Begone!"*

North:
The Black Emperor and Black Youth Lord of the North, wielding the Emperor’s Gong, swiftly bind the demons that stir malevolence, casting them into the Inescapable Prison. Let them suffer punishment without mercy, and swiftly bring the case to judgment. As before, they receive the talismanic command of Heaven. Gaze toward the North and shout: *"Begone!"*

Center:
The Yellow Emperor and Yellow Youth Lord of the Center, wielding a golden mallet, swiftly bind the demons that stir malevolence, casting them into the Everlasting Prison. Let them suffer punishment without mercy, and swiftly bring the case to judgment. As before, they receive the talismanic command of Heaven. Gaze toward the heavens and shout: *"Begone!"*

When the afflicted person cries out in distress, command: *"Left and Right Marshal Generals, divine warriors aiding the Dao, seize and bring them forth!"* Then instruct the household to lead the afflicted to the hall below, where they will prostrate themselves.

Recite the incantation as the afflicted emerges, using the Jade Purity Mudra:
*"Heavenly spirit, earthly spirit,
Heaven and Earth conjoin in power.
Officers dispatched by decree,
Show no leniency, spare no mercy.
Seize the demonic thieves,
Swiftly bring them before the steps.
Hasten! As the statutes command."*

Recite the incantation seven times. When the afflicted reaches the steps, command: *"Gaolers of the Day’s Prison, seize the demonic thieves for me!"*

Recite the incantation:
*"By decree of the Supreme Heaven,
Swiftly bind the demonic essence.
Gaolers on duty, show no leniency,
Hasten to obey Heaven’s command,
Examine and subdue their defiance.
Beneath my steps—
Primordial, flourishing, harmonious, steadfast.
Hasten! As the statutes command."*

Recite the incantation three times. The afflicted will then sit of their own accord. Once seated, question them and bid them confess the cause. If they refuse to comply, shout: *"Place them in the cangue!"* Then recite the incantation seven times.

Use the Supreme Purity Mudra.
Recite the incantation:
*"By Heaven’s mandate,
The Radiant Emperor of Jade holds sway.
Demons in the cangue,
Defiant against the Supreme Purity,
Bound by the Mystic Registers of the Nine Heavens,
Show no leniency, spare no mercy.
Hasten! As the statutes command."*

The afflicted will then behave as though bound by the cangue. If they still refuse to confess, form the Jade Emperor Mudra with both hands and shout: *"Bind them for me!"* Then use the Purple Tenuity Seal and recite the incantation seven times.

Recite the incantation:
*"Heavenly spirit, heavenly glory,
I act by decree of the Supreme Purity.
Bind the demonic thieves,
Resistance brings punishment.
The Dipper’s might and the Demon-Quelling Star,
Show no leniency, spare no mercy.
Hasten! As the statutes command."*

The afflicted will stand as though tightly bound. Question them again and bid them confess. If they still refuse, command: *"Beat their feet—both at once!"*

Recite the incantation:
*"Interrogation Mudra of Demons.
By decree of the Supreme Heaven,
The cangue restrains demonic essence.
Gaolers executing punishment,
Show no leniency, spare no mercy.
By Heaven’s talismanic command,
Act in accordance with the decree.
Hasten! As the statutes command."*

If the afflicted cries out but still refuses to confess when questioned, recite the Yellow Wasp Incantation three times: *Interrogation Mudra of Demons.*

*"Great Demon, Great Spirit,
Radiance of the Seven Stars of the Dipper.
True Primal Qi of the Nine Heavens,
Eternally bound by the Supreme Decree.
By command as command,
Act with utmost urgency.
Hasten! As the statutes command."*

If the afflicted still refuses to confess, command: *"Bind them to the bronze pillar and pour molten bronze and iron pellets upon them!"*

Recite the incantation seven times: *Interrogation Mudra of Demons.*
*"Great Tenuity, Great Tenuity,
Molten bronze searing red.
Eternally condemned by the Nine Heavens,
Enduring punishment without reprieve.
Die again and again,
By decree of the Supreme Emperor.
Summon the gaolers,
To feast on ghosts and drink their blood.
Hasten! As the statutes command."*

When the afflicted cries out in suffering, question them again for their confession.

**Method for Beheading the Ghost**
Use the *Mudra for Annihilating Demonic Ghosts*, forming it with both hands. To execute the ghost, declare in accordance with the statutory verification: *"You have incurred this guilt, and your guilt warrants beheading."*

Then command: *"Executioner of this court, behead the ghost for me!"*

Recite the incantation:
*"By stern decree of the Heavenly Emperor,
The executioner receives his charge.
Bearing the Heavenly Talisman’s command,
Show no leniency, spare no mercy.
The divine blade’s twin edges,
Sever evil and cast it away.
Escort them beneath the altar’s steps,
And with a single stroke, execute them.
Hasten! As the statutes command."*

After reciting the incantation seven times, command: *"Drag them forth for dismemberment!"*

Recite the *Ghost Incantation* seven times:
*"By decree of the Heavenly Emperor,
The Heavenly Armored Ones, the Heavenly Soldiers.
The ghost has committed grievous crimes,
Ground to dust, its form shattered.
By the Heavenly Decree’s command,
Enforce the law as ordered.
Hasten! As the statutes command."*

**Incantation for Severing the Ghost** – Use the *Interrogation Mudra of Demons.*
*"By decree of the Heavenly Emperor,
The law is established without mercy.
Under the Three Heavenly Talismans,
The guilty shall receive their punishment.
By the Heavenly Decree’s command,
Enforce the law as ordered.
Hasten! As the statutes command."*

**Incantation for Exiling the Ghost** – Use the *Mudra for Exiling Ghosts.*
*"The ghost has committed vile crimes,
Its heart devoid of mercy.
By the statutes’ command,
Exile it to the Sea Garrison.
By decree of the Supreme Heaven,
Enforce the law as ordered.
Should it resist,
Grind its bones to dust, shatter its form.
Hasten! As the statutes command."*

From the *Incantation for Capturing the Seated Ghost-Thief* to this point, after each recitation, spray a mouthful of water and declare: *"Extinguished!"*

**Method for Distant Treatment of Madness and Malevolence**
For any maiden or woman one does not wish to see, after consecrating the water, have them take a bowl to wash their hands and face, then let the afflicted wash theirs. While washing the hands, form the *Jade Emperor Mudra* with both hands, recite the incantation seven times, and blow seven times into the water.

**Incantation:**
*"Divine hands of the Heavenly Dragon,
A thousand demons flee of their own accord.
Established in the Great Luo,
Chanting the cavern’s hymns in song."*
*Swiftly, swiftly, as the Upper Clarity statutes command.*

Upon completion, flick the mudra into the water.

**Mudra Guide:**
*Upper Clarity Mudra* – two fingers raised; *Interrogation Mudra of Ghosts* – two fingers centered.
*Jade Clarity Mudra* – middle finger raised; *Jade Emperor Mudra* – middle finger centered.
*Thrusting Sword Mudra* – middle finger lowered; *Upper Clarity Mudra* – four fingers centered.
*Purple Tenuity Mudra* – four fingers centered; *Exiling Ghost Mudra* – little finger centered.
*Extinguishing Ghost Mudra* – little finger lowered.

Before proceeding to treat malevolence, first burn the *Pass Permit* and post the *Notice Placard* before the local Earth God, the Controller of Fate, and the Five Roads’ relevant deities. Simultaneously, file a petition to the City God to borrow troops for apprehension and custody. Once used, file another petition to return them. After securing the entity, report the outcome clearly.

**Incantation for Dispersing Qi:**
*"Primordial Heaven’s numen,
Jia Yi Bing Ding.
Wu Ji and the Great Unity,
Ren Gui guard the form.
Vermilion Bird’s shelter,
Longevity and immortal life.
Body’s Attendants,
Generals of Three and Five.
Divine persons left and right,
Auspicious fortune this day.
Attaining the Dao’s subtlety,
Grant me communion with the spirits.
Sweep away foul qi,
Banish malevolence and unrest.
Spirit clear, qi refreshed,
Attain the Dao and cultivate integrity."*
*Swiftly, swiftly, as the Upper Clarity statutes command.*

Here begins the *Lower Scroll of the Upper Clarity Heavenly Pivot Institute’s Returning Chariot and Completing the Dao Orthodox Methods*.

**Verification Form for Stove Inspection**
If someone submits a petition, first burn incense, form the mudra by raising both index fingers to the *Hai* position, clasp the waist, knock the teeth three times, blow a breath toward the ground, knock the teeth three times again, draw a breath from the center and swallow it, then recite:

**Incantation:**
*"Heaven’s numen, Earth’s numen,
Heaven and Earth dispatch their troops.
I act by the Jade Emperor’s decree,
To investigate and restrain malevolent spirits.
Wang Min submits a petition,
With earnest matters to bring.
Attendants of this institute,
Dare not delay.
Swiftly summon the Controller of Fate,
To summon the names of calamity’s ghosts.
Go swiftly, return swiftly,
I stand before the altar, sword drawn, awaiting."*
*Swiftly, swiftly, as the statutes command.*

Shout: *"Go!"*

After reciting the incantation, examine the petition to identify the character upon which the issue hinges, thereby discerning whether malevolent spirits or misfortune are at fault. Assess the circumstances and proceed in accordance with the celestial statutes and decrees. For minor matters, dispatch them to the appropriate authority or entrust them to the household’s attending deities. Whenever summoning ghostly soldiers or divine generals, specify which temple’s forces are being deployed. Affix the seal of the Lord of Universal Dharma upon the signature space, and provide offerings of incense, wine, tea, and fruit. Once the affliction is resolved, burn incense and paper offerings at the temple of origin. The petition requires six sheets of spirit money, twelve paper horses, and incense with candles.

If the divine generals of this institute observe inauspicious signs, do not grant the petition—even if the supplicant appears at ease, their longevity will not endure. Exercise utmost care; never lightly diminish another’s merit and practice. This originates from the First Dragon Han Era, when the Supreme Dao Lord of the Upper Clarity Realm summoned the celestial officials to pursue and interrogate the Stove Lord and Controller of Fate regarding the causes of human calamities and malevolent spirits, delegating their adjudication and remedy to the Celestial Pivot Institute.
