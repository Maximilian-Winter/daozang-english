*The Supreme Clarity Pure Brightness Court’s Supplementary Memorial Bureau of the Great Mystery Capital: Essential Knowledge*

*Transmitted by the Highly Enlightened Grand Master, True Lord of Divine Merit and Wondrous Salvation, Xu Jiyang*

**Essential Knowledge of the Great Mystery Capital’s Supplementary Memorial Bureau of the Supreme Clarity Pure Brightness Court**

The Great Mystery Capital is the exclusive office of the Jade Emperor’s decrees.
Within this office are two ranks of officials: the Literary Grove and the Martial Grove.
The Literary Grove oversees matters of composition, records, and ritual propriety;
The Martial Grove oversees the suppression of evil and the execution of punitive expeditions.
Both ranks are filled by those who practice the Daoist arts, promoted according to merit.
While living, they hold provisional appointments; upon death, they receive formal investiture—this is the standard procedure.
If, however, one possesses extraordinary abilities or exceptional achievements, their name recorded in the Mystic Register, the Perfected and Sages may grant formal investiture directly.
Alternatively, those whose blessings and conduct warrant it may have their souls temporarily assigned to a rank, their judgments rendered in dreams by celestial law.
Those whose past lives are recorded in the registers of spirits and deities, who secretly uphold heavenly statutes, whose hearing and vision are as keen as the heavens, whose minds align with the celestial, and whose spirits commune with the unseen—these are formally commissioned and assigned ranks accordingly.
Annual reviews are conducted, and after one year, they enter the Cavern Spirit Literary Hall.

For dispatched officials, add: "Your subject is presently at [location] and departed for [destination] on [month and day]."

For memorials and petitions, include the subject’s name and title, and seal with the phrase "respectfully and truthfully sealed." Fold the corner, and affix seals at both ends. If no seal is available, sign in full. Do not affix yellow slips to the cover. For external memorials, note only "confidential" or "urgent." For letters, omit titles, names, and years at the beginning. Replace "memorial" with "report," and conclude with "awaiting your decree." Submit directly to the appropriate office without passing through subordinate bureaus.

For urgent documents, use a notice format, omitting the year, partial sheets, and sealing. For minor written matters during silent memorials, face north, proceed with the ritual, and burn the document before the incense burner.

**Format for Memorials of Recommendation** (e.g., for transmitting Daoist teachings):
- List the official’s name and title.
- State: "In accordance with the statutes or regulations, I briefly outline the criteria for recommendation."

- Conclude: "The above memorial is respectfully submitted as stated. [Bureau name] respectfully memorializes."

- List the matters as above.
- Conclude: "Respectfully submitted. Memorialized on [year, month, day]. [Official’s signature and seal]."
- For non-subordinate offices, use this format. For divine memoranda, replace the bureau name with the individual’s name, omitting blank spaces.
- Even for subordinate offices without memorial precedents or equal status, use the above format.
- For offices under jurisdiction without formal memorandum procedures, address the memorandum to "[location/official]" without blank spaces, and conclude with the date and the official’s signature.

**Format for Offices with Separate Jurisdictions but Shared Subordination** (e.g., **Celestial Way Institute’s** memorandum to the **Immortal Registers Section** of the **Heavenly Pivot**):
- Use the standard memorandum format.

**Decree Format**:
- "[Bureau name]: Regarding [matter], etc."
- Conclude: "This decree is issued to [recipient]. Upon receipt, comply accordingly. [Year, month, day]. [Official’s signature and seal]."
