**The Supreme Clarity Scripture of the Eight Primes of the Grand Supreme**

*The Scripture of the Eight Primes of the Hidden Writ of the Grand Supreme* is the Dao of the Jade Emperor of Mystic Clarity. The August Emperor of the Upper Heaven bestowed this scripture upon the Emperor Lord of the Grand Tenuity, the Three Origins Purple Essence Dao Lord, and the True Yang Primordial Elder Lord. After these lords received the scripture and practiced the Dao to perfection, they transmitted it to the Grand Supreme Dao Lord. The Grand Supreme Dao Lord passed it to the Posterior Sage Li Lord of the Golden Watchtower, who then entrusted it to the Great Void Perfected and the Red Lord of the Southern Marchmount, instructing them to transmit it below to those who study the Dao—those whose names are inscribed in gold and jade upon the lofty towers and are destined to become Perfected.

The hidden writ of the Grand Supreme is not transmitted to earthbound immortals, nor can such immortals ever obtain it.

The Grand Supreme said: The Five Stars are the spiritual roots of the sun and moon, the five viscera of the celestial embryo. Thus, the essence of heaven coalesces and entwines to form the Five Stars, upon which heaven and earth rely to harmonize qi, and by which the sun and moon are struck to shine. If the qi of heaven fails to nurture, the Three Conjunctions wane and wax; if the qi of earth fails to nurture, the myriad beings wither and stagnate. Waxing and waning cause heaven to quake and earth to tremble. If the constellations do not hold their positions, the sun and moon suffer eclipse; if the Five Stars disorder their courses, the Two Images lose their light. When heaven and earth are in harmony, the Five Stars gleam with clarity; when the essence of heaven converges, the Five Stars radiate brilliance.

The numinous Dao of the stars corresponds above to Mount Tai, while their virtue and spirit ascend to Jade Clarity, illuminating the Great Void above and illuminating the myriad multitudes below. When the multitudes falter or prosper, the Five Movements err and reverse; when the multitudes are harmonious and auspicious, the celestial currents flow in accord with the Dao, casting light upon fortune and misfortune so that even the finest threads are revealed. The mysterious illumination extends to the most minute details, discerning hidden merits and transgressions.

The Five Thearchs declared this within the Stellar Perfected Sovereign, who then memorialized it to the Jade Lord of the Grand Supreme. Thus, the radiance of the stars revolves like a torch to manifest before the myriad beings, and their errant courses and displaced positions foretell calamity and fortune.

Earth establishes the Five Marchmounts to emulate the Five Phases of the stars; humans establish the spirits of the five viscera to correspond to the functions of the Five Phases. When the Three Qi revolve and converge, heaven and earth array themselves in perfect order.

The essence of the stars communicates above with all essences and below with the luminous fluids. In their exhalation and inhalation, the Three Flowers bathe the myriad spirits in effulgence, extending to the Three and Six, and inwardly nurturing life. Their affairs are profound and subtly boundless; their influence is vast and enduring.

Immortals know only how to fly elixirs and summon frost, to refine cinnabar and distill cloud-rosin and jade-water, to dissolve gold and kindle the nine furnaces to soar in the empyrean. Their toil and suffering are extreme in their pursuits, and their vigilance and labor are exhaustive. Even if they succeed, they ascend bodily to heaven and transcend the Mystic Continent—nothing more. This is merely the way of immortals, who may wander among the Nine Palaces but have not yet entered the gate of the Perfected.

I now possess a Dao that is the method of the Supreme Perfected, surpassing even the Median Perfected. You may summon the Five Stars to share your chariot, ascending with the Three Primes, sitting upon the Eight Effulgences to gaze about, and mounting the Western Wall of the Grand Thearch. You may roam the Great Void, ascending at dawn in broad daylight.

I received this from the Jade Emperor in former times and have practiced it without ceasing for 460,000 years, delighting in the marvels of this Dao and the companionship of the Five Stars. Having attained the power to multiply my form into countless manifestations, to generate clouds and nurture effluence, to roam above in Jade Clarity and gaze below upon the Great Ultimate, I became a Perfected of the Grand Supreme by attaining the essence of the Five Stars.

This arcane and wondrous art is concealed within the cloud pavilions, its numinous instructions embraced as I wander with them. You shall govern the myriad beings as an emperor of the Ten Heavens, your name inscribed in azure upon the jade towers. It is fitting that beginning Perfected receive this secret writ, that you transmit and practice it, and that you find the right person to receive it. This scripture is the secret of the Supreme Perfected and must not be transmitted to earthbound immortals.

At the outset of its transmission, one must await a mysterious resonance and spiritual revelation, whereupon the recipient shall purify themselves, fast, and swear oaths to the Three Heavens. Within seven hundred years, it may be transmitted three times; thereafter, it shall be sealed within the Five Marchmounts and never again brought forth. To divulge the hidden writ of celestial patterns is to invite the judgment of the Heavenly Emperor, who will punish three generations of one’s ancestors, while the Three Officials will sever one’s lifespan. In life, one shall suffer water and fire; in death, one shall become a lowly ghost.

All who study the Perfected and receive this scripture shall have their names recorded by the Grand Emperor in the Western Flower Palace, inscribed upon jade tablets in the Purple Palace. Only those destined to become Perfected may obtain this text. Indeed, five thousand years before your birth, your name was already determined in the mysterious records, and you were fated to encounter this scripture. Do not suppose that receiving this text now is not your predestined portion.

When the Jade Emperor gazes down upon the living and sees one who has obtained this scripture, he informs the Grand Supreme, who dispatches thirty-six Flying Numinous Jade Lads to attend the scripture’s abode. He also commands the Great Ultimate to send thirty-two Jade Maidens of the Southern Mound to guard the names of the Five Star Perfected Lords and their consorts. Moreover, the Jade Lads and Jade Maidens shall protect the person who possesses the scripture.

The scripture is to be kept in a separate case. When opening, perusing, or consulting it, one must face the text, bow twice, and burn incense to either side. The Jade Lads and Jade Maidens observe one’s merits and transgressions, scrutinizing one’s sincerity and devotion. Any transgression or virtue is promptly reported to the Grand Supreme—one must be vigilant.

By cultivating this Dao for five years, the Jade Lads and Jade Maidens will manifest and serve you. After fourteen years of practice, the Dao will be perfected, and you shall ride with the Five Stars to ascend to the Jade Clarity Palace.

The Way of the Supreme Perfected comprises seven scriptures; the Way of the Grand Supreme comprises three; the Way of the Median Perfected comprises six; and the Way of the Lesser Perfected comprises eight.

The seven scriptures of the Supreme Perfected are listed as follows:
First, the *Supreme Grand Darkness’ Text for Rushing to the Sun*;
Second, the *Supreme Grand Net’s Chapter for Rushing to the Moon*;
Third, the *Supreme Eight Simplicities’ Hidden Scripture for Rushing to the Stars*;
Fourth, the *Celestial August Lord of the Grand Tenuity’s Scripture of the Flying Heavenly Net*;
Fifth, the *Lofty Supreme Scripture of the Great Cavern in Thirty-Nine Chapters*;
Sixth, the *Golden Watchtower’s Numinous Writ: Purple Text of the Supreme Scripture*;
Seventh, the *Yellow and Old’s Eight Ways and Nine Perfected’s Median Scripture*.

When these scriptures of the Supreme Perfected are practiced in their entirety, one becomes a Perfected of the Highest Clarity, attended by three thousand Jade Lads and three thousand Jade Maidens, assuming the rank of Emperor among the Celestial Thearchs. In procession, one is preceded by three-colored standards, followed by a host of divine spirits and myriad perfected, with phoenix songs leading the way, the Dark Chime following behind, the White Tiger clearing the path, and flying dragons flanking the chariot.

The three scriptures of the Grand Supreme are listed as follows:
The *Hidden Writ of the Jade Clarity*,
The *Great Talisman of the Divine Tiger*,
The *True Talisman of the Golden Tiger*.

When these scriptures of the Grand Supreme are practiced in their entirety, one attains the Way of the Grand Supreme, attended by two thousand Jade Lads and two thousand Jade Maidens, assuming the rank of Jade August Lord of the Supreme Perfected. In procession, one is preceded by five-colored divine standards, followed by a thousand perfected and a host of immortals, with the Heavenly Chime leading the way, phoenix songs following behind, three perfected attending the chariot, and soaring through the nine heavens.

The six scriptures of the Median Perfected are listed as follows:
The *Hidden Writ of the Grand Cinnabar: Scripture of Audience with the Perfected of the Supreme August*;
The *Divine Talismans of the Jade Emperor*;
The *Orthodox Dharma of the Three Heavens: Phoenix Perfected’s Writ and Nine Perfected’s Scripture of Ascending the Mysterious*;
The *Three Primordials’ Scripture of the Spread: Four Perfected’s Chapters and Supreme Golden Writs*;
The *Supreme Scripture of the Jade Characters of the Moon’s Chamber*;
The *Six Jia’s Numinous Flight*;
The *Mysterious Writ of the Three Sovereigns: Inner Writ of the Celestial Script*;
The *Azure Essentials and Purple Writ: Verses of the Curved Simplicity and the Three-Five Sequential Practice*.

When these scriptures of the Median Perfected are practiced in their entirety, one becomes a Perfected of the Median Way of the Highest Clarity, attended by one thousand Jade Lads and one thousand Jade Maidens, assuming the rank of Preceptor to the Left and Right Ministers of the Highest Clarity. In procession, one is preceded by purple-feathered standards, followed by ten thousand spirits and a thousand perfected, with phoenix flutes leading the way, the Heavenly Chime following behind, the Dark Dragon clearing the path, the Five Thearchs verifying the chariot, and flying through the Grand Void to sport in the Cinnabar Empyrean.

The eight scriptures of the Lesser Perfected are listed as follows:
The *Nine Transformations and Ten Changes: Thirty-Nine Simplicities’ Discourse of the Highest Clarity*;
The *Eight Arts of the Hidden Earth: Essence of the Cinnabar Landscape*;
The *Three Diagrams of the Heavenly Pass: Jade Writ of the Mysterious August*;
The *Cavern Scripture of the Seven Changes and Seven Turns of the Divine Continent*;
The *Mother of the Jade Horse: Stone Essence of the Purple Capital’s Median*;
The *Crimson Record and Yellow Way: Jade Eyes and Dragon Writ of the Multitudinous Texts*;
The *Median Verses of the Plain Memorial: Five Phases’ Secret Talismans*;
The *Five Jade Mysteries: Five Writs of the Supreme Primordial*.

When these scriptures of the Lesser Perfected are practiced in their entirety, one becomes a Perfected of the Lesser Primordial of the Highest Clarity, attended by five hundred Jade Lads and five hundred Jade Maidens, assuming the rank of Grand Master to the Left and Right of the Highest Clarity. In procession, one is preceded by five-colored standards, followed by a host of spirits and jade maidens, with nine phoenixes wailing ahead, eight simurghs singing behind, the White Wyrm clearing the path, the Grand Ultimate verifying the chariot, flying through the inverted landscape, and sporting in the Purple Chamber.

The scriptures for cultivation corresponding to the Perfected of the Highest Clarity, the Perfected of the Median Way, and the Perfected of the Lesser Primordial each have their own catalogues, divided into sections and arranged in order. If one wishes to practice the Way of a single Perfected rank, one must obtain all the scriptures of that rank’s section and practice them together to become a Perfected of the Highest Clarity. If the scriptures obtained are incomplete—whether the superior scriptures, the median chapters, or the lesser texts—and one practices them exclusively while neglecting the rest, one may only become a flying immortal, journeying to the Grand Ultimate and roaming the Five Marchmounts, but not attaining the rank of the Three Perfected of the Highest Clarity.

You must diligently devote yourself to Heaven and Earth, invoke the divine and mysterious, wander to renowned mountains, pray to the thousand spirits, seek the treasure texts, and ensure that your virtue and power are complete. Having cultivated a single section, you may ascend to the Highest Clarity, where the Jade Lads and Jade Maidens attending you will number in the thousands. If you obtain only a single scripture without possessing the complete set, the Jade Lads and Jade Maidens will still be granted according to the limits of the scripture you have received.

Only by cultivating the *Supreme Grand Darkness’ Text for Rushing to the Sun*, the *Grand Net’s Chapter for Rushing to the Moon*, and the *Eight Simplicities’ Hidden Scripture for Rushing to the Stars* may one ascend to the Highest Clarity as a Perfected of the Lesser Primordial, for these do not require the complete cultivation of the Supreme Perfected’s scriptures. For all others, one must practice them in conjunction; only by completing the combined cultivation may one ascend to the Highest Clarity. If one practices all the scriptures of the Three Perfected Ways in their entirety, gains access to the *Hidden Writ of the Jade Clarity*, wears the *Great Talisman of the Divine Tiger*, one ascends to become the Jade August Lord, the Perfected of the Grand Supreme, attended by thirty thousand Jade Lads and Jade Maidens, roaming the lofty palaces of the Supreme, entering and exiting the Jade Clarity’s abode, where the Celestial Emperor, the Lord of the Grand Tenuity, comes to serve the Jade August Lord.

The *Hidden Writ of the Jade Clarity* comprises four scrolls, which the Supreme Jade August Lord once received from the Jade Mysterious Supreme August Lord of the Dao as a forbidden text. It is the most treasured and wondrous possession of the Jade August Lord, who entrusted it to the Four Perfected of the Grand Ultimate to safeguard its secret repository. Within five thousand years, it may be transmitted three times, only to the Jade Perfected of the Highest Clarity. If within a thousand years it is transmitted to more than three individuals, this is also permitted. Once the transmission limit is reached, it may no longer be passed on. Among the myriad people of the mundane world, perhaps one in ten thousand is destined to be granted this text by the Celestial Perfected, for the Supreme Dark Terrace has already inscribed their jade name, predestining them to become a Supreme Perfected.

Those who possess this text, while still dwelling at home, are attended by three hundred Jade Lads and three hundred Jade Maidens. Morning and evening, they summon a host of perfected immortals, spirits, and numinous beings of the renowned mountains to their bedchamber to discourse on the Dao and expound on virtue. This describes the state of those who possess the text while still living in the world, before departing to study the Way.

Seeking the Perfected amidst the mountains and savoring the numinous scriptures, one may command the Six Heavens, dispatch the mountain spirits, and summon the Five Peaks to pay homage. Jade Lads and Jade Maidens will manifest in form, attending the Perfected to burn incense.

The *Divine Tiger Talisman of the Supreme* was bestowed by the Supreme Void Sovereign Dao Lord upon the Supreme. The Supreme Dao Lord then transmitted it to the Three Heavens’ Perfected August Ones, who in turn granted it to the various Perfected and the celestial officials of the Heavenly Thearchs. All those whose true names are recorded in the Upper Clarity and who receive this talisman may wear it. Yet those who possess only this talisman but lack the *Hidden Book of Jade Clarity* may not become Perfected of Upper Clarity, but only Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate.

The *Golden Tiger Talisman of the Heavenly Thearch of Grand Tenuity* was conferred by the Supreme Jade Perfected Preserver August Dao Lord upon the Supreme Heavenly Thearch of Grand Tenuity. Among the thirty-six Heavenly Thearchs, the Heavenly Thearch of Grand Tenuity is the most exalted, and all the Heavenly Thearchs come to receive his commands. Those who receive this talisman command the myriad spirits, dispatch the thousand numina, and are attended by dragon and tiger escorts. They may ride the Threefold Plainness clouds to ascend to the Supreme Ultimate and Upper Clarity, where they are appointed as Left Dukes.

The *Hidden Book of Jade Clarity* is profoundly distant and utterly transcendent. Even the Lesser Perfected and the ranks of flying immortals must rest their aspirations upon this boundless hope. The *Divine Tiger Talisman* and the *Golden Tiger Talisman* are ceaselessly sought by the flying immortals, and some may indeed attain them. Yet without one’s name inscribed in the numinous registers, even if one were to seek without respite, one would never encounter these texts—how much less the Dao of Jade Clarity?

The Supreme has said: "In ancient times, it was said that the Grand Clarity could not be ascended—how much less the Supreme Ultimate? It was said that Upper Clarity could not be heard of—how much less Jade Clarity?" This makes clear that among the Perfected there are ranks of high and low, and within the Mysterious there are gradations of ascent. Beyond this, no further discussion is warranted.

The Lesser Perfected of the Jade Clarity Palace are the Upper Perfected of the Upper Clarity Palace. The Upper Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate Palace are the Lesser Perfected of the Upper Clarity Palace. The Upper Perfected of the Grand Clarity Palace are the Lesser Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate Palace. Below these are the flying immortals of the Nine Palaces in descending order.

When the *Hidden Book of Jade Clarity* is to be transmitted, the Four Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate each hold one scroll and present them to the Four Dao Lords—Supreme August, Most High, Jade August, and Jade Mysterious—who examine the golden registers and jade names to determine who is destined to become a Jade Lord of the Upper Perfected. Only then is the text transmitted. Those who possess it immediately summon a host of Perfected Immortals to their bedchamber. If they cultivate the Dao to completion, the Supreme will no longer test their disposition, for they are certain to be those whose names are predestined in the golden registers and jade tablets to become Upper Perfected.

The *Hidden Book of Jade Clarity* surpasses the *Scripture of the Majestic Radiance* in its Daoic subtlety. Those who possess the *Supreme Scripture of the Majestic Radiance Racing the Sun*, the *Chapter of the Woven Brilliance Racing the Moon*, and the *Eightfold Plainness Scripture of Racing the Stars* and cultivate their methods will not be tested by the Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate. Those who possess the *Perfect Scripture of the Great Cavern* and cultivate its methods will liberate their seven ancestors and parents from their ghostly names, absolve them of the Three Bureaus’ trials and judgments, and enroll them in the immortal registers. Their fetters will be loosened, and they will be sent to the Vermilion Fire Cinnabar Mound Palace to study the immortal Dao. Once the immortal Dao is perfected, they will assist the Five Thearchs and become immortals of the Nine Palaces. This refers to those who fully possess the *Perfect Scripture of the Great Cavern*.

This scripture, in accordance with the statutes of the Four Poles, uniquely ensures the ascension of one’s seven ancestors—unlike other scriptures—and thus must not be left un-cultivated. If one cultivates it but is tested and fails—whether by practicing only one path or abandoning the Way midway—one will be unable even to save oneself, let alone secure immortality for one’s seven generations. Ghosts may study to become immortals, just as humans may study to attain the Dao. By establishing virtue for seven generations, blessings flow to one’s descendants, enabling them to achieve divine transcendence. When one cultivates the Dao and fully masters the *Perfect Scripture of the Great Cavern*, one’s merit extends to seven ancestors, who are thus transformed from their fetal forms into immortal officials.

The Central Yellow Venerable Lord treasured the subtleties of this cavern scripture for its power to bring blessings to seven generations, guarding it as profoundly as the *Scripture of the Majestic Radiance*. The Perfected of Upper Clarity also esteem this path, for its merit extends to seven ancestors and its virtue elevates one’s forebears.

Later, the Sage Lord Li received the *Hidden Book of the Eightfold Plainness Scripture of Racing the Stars* and practiced its methods. Thereupon, the Heavenly Thearch of Grand Tenuity descended to welcome him, the Five Planets shared his chariot, and he rode the resplendent Threefold Plainness clouds to ascend to Jade Clarity, where he received the scriptures and was appointed Emperor Lord of the Golden Gates of Upper Clarity.

The Way of Ascending the Wood Star: The Year Star is the round mirror of wood essence, the darkly luminous eastern expanse of the celestial realm. Within the star are nine gates, from which nine radiant beams emerge, their light extending nine million leagues. Each gate is guarded by a Green Thearch, who attends the Central Green August Perfected Lord.

The Central Green August Perfected Lord of Primordial Yang is named Chenglan, styled Qingning. His consort is named Baorong, styled Feiyun. They reside within the Wood Star, guarding the nine gates and circulating green light through the beams to illuminate the Perfected above and below.

The method for ascending in flight is as follows: Constantly visualize the Year Star. When you see it, align your heart to gaze upon it. With your right hand, press your heart and bow in reverence. Cover both eyes with your left hand, then perform the Ninefold Breath-Holding. Next, knock the teeth twenty-seven times, swallow saliva nine times, and keep your eyes closed beneath your hand. In your heart, invoke the names and styles of the Perfected Lord of the Year Star and his consort three times, then say: "May I, together with the Primordial Yang Green August Perfected Lord and his consort, ride the Eightfold Azure Chariot to ascend to the Supreme Palace."

Upon completing these words, keep your eyes closed beneath your hand and face the star, silently praying: "Heaven and Earth harmonize, essence flows to the East. I gaze upward to the nine gates, where flying auroras scatter their beams. Within the Azure Terrace of Primordial Yang dwells the Green August Lord. Green fangs hang in radiance, illuminating the nine directions. The august consort, styled Feiyun, wears divine brocade, dragon robes and tiger skirts, a phoenix talisman at her waist, and a flowered crown upon her head. She emerges from the formless and enters the void, roaming the Great Primal. Before her, the Green Thearch drives her chariot; behind her, a thousand spirits follow. Come to welcome and receive me, that I may become a flying Perfected and ascend to the Jade Clarity’s lofty chambers."

Having completed the prayer, remove your hand and face the star with eyes open, swallowing the star’s light twenty-seven times. Visualize the star’s nine rays entering your throat until fully absorbed. When finished, strike your teeth together three times.

Practice this for fourteen years, and the Great Lord of the Green Thearch within Jupiter will memorialize the Lofty Jade Clarity Palace, inscribing your name upon the petal-tablets of the Grand Tenuity, bestowing the title of Jade Script and appointing you as an Upper Clarity Flying Perfected. Jupiter has nine gates, each guarded by one of nine Green Thearchs, who serve and attend the Central Green August Lord of the Upper Perfected.

The Green August Lord is the supreme Perfected of the East, the revered spirit of primordial essence. He enters and exits the Jade Clarity, befriending the Most High. The Green Thearchs within the gates may also be styled the Duke of Green Numinosity, the Green Spirit, the Green Essence, or the Lord of the Green Thearch, all of whom serve the Central Green August Lord.

By practicing the secret Dao of the Eight Simplicities, one may summon the descent of the Green August Lord. Those who have mastered the outer methods of the Five Spirits may receive scriptures from the Green Spirit. Thus, the Dao has depths and shallows, and the spirits summoned vary in rank. When the sky lacks stars or is overcast, one may perform this practice facing east within the bedchamber. The subtle workings of the celestial Dao are as fine as a hair’s breadth—one need not always face the star. When stars are visible, one may sit or stand in the courtyard as one pleases.

This is the method of ascending the Eastern Star, the Dao of the Upper Perfected, not to be transmitted to earthbound immortals.

The method for ascending the Fire Star: The Fire Star is a dark mirror of cinnabar essence, its radiance illuminating the southern window. The star has three gates, from which three beams of light extend, each spanning three million leagues. Within each gate resides a Red Thearch, and together the three Red Thearchs guard and serve the Southern Perfected August Lord of the Upper Prime.

At the star’s center dwells the Great Cinnabar Fire August Lord of the Upper Dao, named Weiting, styled Sanyong. His consort is named Huaping, styled Xuanluo. They govern within the Fire Star, guarding its three gates, dispatching red light and flying clouds to illumine the Perfected of the world.

To practice the method of ascending the Fire Star, visualize the Radiant Deluder star, focus your mind upon it, press your left hand to your heart in reverence, and cover your mouth with your right hand. Hold your breath three times, then strike your teeth together twenty-seven times, swallowing saliva nine times. Close your eyes and silently invoke the Radiant Deluder’s True August Lord and his consort by their names three times, concluding with: *"May I, together with the Cinnabar Fire August Lord and his consort, ascend in the eight-scene cinnabar chariot to the Jade Clarity Palace."*

Then face the star and pray softly: *"The dark image flows and reflects, cinnabar light illumines the southern darkness. I gaze upward to the three gates, where vermilion clouds form a crimson city. Within dwells the Cinnabar August Lord, named Weiting; his consort, the inwardly radiant Huaping. They wear robes of cloud-frost, adorned with phoenix blossoms and dragon bells, their waists girded with tiger-script talismans, their heads crowned with flying azure. Emerging from the Primal and entering the Mysterious, they soar through the five cities. Before them, the Red Thearch leads; behind them, the Six Dings follow. Come to welcome and receive me, that I may attain the name of Perfected and ascend to the Mysterious Void, inscribed in gold upon the Jade Clarity."*

Having completed the prayer, remove your hand from your mouth and face the star with eyes open, swallowing its light twenty-seven times. Visualize the star’s three rays entering your throat until fully absorbed. When finished, strike your teeth together three times.

Practice this for fourteen years, and the Great August Lord of the Upper Perfected within the Radiant Deluder will memorialize the Three Origins Palace of the Mysterious Upper Realm, inscribing your name upon the jade-tablets of the Dark Garden, bestowing the title of Gold Script and appointing you as an Upper Clarity Flying Perfected. The Radiant Deluder has three gates, each guarded by one of three Red Thearchs, who serve and attend the Central Red August Lord.

The Red August Lord is the supreme Perfected of the South, the noble spirit of the Cinnabar Palace. He enters and exits the Jade Clarity, befriending the Three Origins August Lords. The Red Thearchs within the star may also be styled the Duke of Red Numinosity, the Red Spirit, the Red Essence, or the Red Thearch, all of whom serve the Central Red August Lord of the Upper Perfected.

By practicing the hidden writings of the Eight Simplicities, one may summon the descent of the Red August Lord. Those who have mastered the outer methods of the Five Spirits may receive scriptures from the Red Spirit. Thus, the Dao has inner and outer aspects, and its texts have secret and manifest dimensions. Therefore, the spirits summoned vary in rank, and the quest for the divine follows an order of precedence. When the sky lacks stars or is overcast, one may perform this practice facing south within the bedchamber. When stars are visible, one may sit or stand in the courtyard as one pleases.

This is the method of hastening to the Southern Star, not to be transmitted to earthbound immortals, lest one incur the sin of leakage and betrayal. Earthbound immortals have their own Eight Simplicities Scripture, which expounds the Dao of ingesting royal qi and exhaling-inhaling. There is also the Nine Simplicities Scripture, which teaches the summoning of ghosts, the dispatch of spirits, and the management of hun and po souls—merely enabling one to wander famous mountains and attain longevity, not true immortality.

Following the Eight Simplicities Scripture is the Heavenly Balance’s Upper Yang Song in nine chapters; after the Nine Simplicities Scripture is the Phoenix’s Cry and Dragon’s Roar Dark Song in eight chapters—these are the secret texts of earthbound immortals. The Eight Simplicities of hastening to the stars, as taught here, pertains to the Dao of the Upper Clarity, not the Eight Simplicities of earthbound immortals. The songs and whistles of earthbound immortals merely await the wanderings of the Upper Clarity’s practitioners.

The method for ascending the Metal Star: The Metal Star is a round mirror of golden essence, its brilliance illuminating the western star. Within the Metal Star are seven gates, from which seven beams of light extend, each spanning seven million leagues. Each gate is guarded by a White Thearch, and together the seven White Thearchs serve and protect the Western Perfected August Lord of the Upper Prime.

At the star’s center dwells the Great Simplicity Lesser Yang White August Lord of the Upper Dao, named Liaoling, styled Zhenxun. His consort is named Biaoying, styled Lingen. They govern within the Metal Star, guarding its seven gates, dispatching white light and flying essence to illumine the Perfected of the Upper Prime.

To ascend the Metal Star, first compose the mind and gaze upon the star. Press the right hand to the heart in reverence, then cover both nostrils with the left hand. Perform the Sevenfold Breath-Holding, strike the teeth twenty-seven times, and swallow saliva nine times. With eyes closed, visualize the True August Lord of the Metal Star and his consort, reciting their names thrice. Conclude with the invocation:

*"May I be granted to ride the Eightfold Simplicity Chariot with the Lesser Yang Lord of Great Simplicity and his consort, ascending to the Jade Clarity Palace."*

Then, facing the star, softly recite:
*"Seven qi soar resplendent, illuminating the western quarter. I gaze upward to the seven gates, where numinous towers gleam with radiant beams. Simplicity’s brilliance shines forth, its virtue marking the Metal Clan. Within dwells the Lesser Yang, styled the White August Lord. His consort, Ling’en, governs the Jade Chamber. Together they don white brocade, their flowing bells adorned with tiger seals. Their headscarves trail the dawn, golden bells at their waists. They emerge from emptiness into the void, treading the Jade Firmament. Preceded by the White Thearchs, followed by the Six Geng, they descend to welcome me, ascending to the Northern Rampart Palace. My name inscribed in the Upper Clarity, I become a Perfected Duke."*

After the incantation, release the hands from the nose, gaze at the star with eyes half-closed, and swallow the star’s twenty-seven beams of light, visualizing all seven rays entering the throat. Once complete, strike the teeth three more times.

Practicing this for fourteen years, the Lesser Yang White August Lord of the Upper Dao within the Metal Star will memorialize the Supreme Thearch of the Jade Emperor’s Palace, inscribing your name upon the Golden Terrace of the Upper Clarity. Your title will be fixed upon the Jade Tablet as Left Perfected Duke of the Upper Clarity, overseeing the Supreme Ultimate.

The Metal Star has seven gates, each guarded by a White Thearch, all serving the Central White August Lord. This White August Lord is the supreme Perfected of the West, the venerable sovereign of Great Simplicity, who roams the Mysterious Clarity and befriends the Primordial August Lord of the Dao. The White Thearchs within the gates may be styled White Numinous Duke, White Spirit, White Essence, or White August Lord, all serving the Central White August Lord of the Upper Perfected.

Mastering the esoteric wonders of the Eight Simplicities will summon the White August Lord’s descent. Practicing the external arts of the Five Spirits will bring the White Spirits to bestow scriptures. Profound and subtle, the Way unfolds in boundless gradations.

When the star is not visible on overcast nights, perform the visualization facing west within your chamber. If the star appears, practice in the courtyard, seated or standing as you prefer. Even secluded Daoist adepts may visualize the true aspects of the Five Stars within their chambers and cultivate them together—all are methods of the Upper Perfected for hastening toward the Western Star, not to be transmitted to earthbound immortals.

Each night, absorb the light of all five stars in sequence. In spring, begin with the eastern star; in summer, the southern star. Follow the ruling month’s star as primary—this is the oral formula. The stars’ movements need not align with cardinal directions; simply face the star’s current position when practicing the oral formula.

Conduct these rites in seclusion, unseen by others. This is the Hidden Way of the Supreme Highest, the so-called "Concealed Scriptures." Concealed yet further concealed, one must still fear that spirits may glimpse their titles—how then could they be lightly transmitted to the unworthy or revealed to the profane? Even the ignorant, though blind to their meaning, must not be shown the scriptures’ titles, for within their bodies dwell seven spirits; exposure would constitute a leak. Utmost caution is required.

Those who practice the Way of Concealed Scriptures yet divulge their names invite the scrutiny of the Three Bureaus and court disaster. Whenever consulting these texts, first dismiss attendants and living creatures such as chickens and dogs. Burn incense, bow twice, and only then proceed.

**The Method for Ascending the Water Star:**
The Water Star is a round mirror of aqueous essence, its luminosity penetrating the northern depths. Within the Water Star are five gates, from which five beams of light extend, each spanning five million leagues. Each gate is guarded by a Black Thearch, and together the five Black Thearchs serve and protect the Northern Perfected August Lord.

At the star’s center dwells the Great Mystery Dark Prime Black August Lord of the Dao, named Qixuan, styled Jingchun. His consort is named Xuanhua, styled Long’e. They govern within the Water Star, guarding its five gates and dispatching dark radiance and flowing luminous qi to illumine the Northern Prime’s court, destined for those who become Perfected.

To ascend the Water Star, compose the mind and gaze upon the star. Press both hands to the heart, then cover both ears. Perform the Fivefold Breath-Holding, strike the teeth twenty-seven times, and swallow saliva nine times. With eyes closed, invoke the True August Lord of the Water Star and his consort by name thrice. Conclude with the invocation:

*"May I be granted to ride the Eightfold Azure Chariot with the Lord and his consort, ascending to the Upper Clarity’s Upper Prime Palace."*

Then, facing the star, softly recite:
*"Five qi soar in dark flight, their light streaming northward. I gaze upward to the five gates, where azure towers stand dense and resplendent. Radiant beams pierce the vista, their numinous glow suffusing the clouds. Within dwells the Black August Lord, styled Jingyuan. Long’e, resplendent in grace, together governs the Mysterious Pass. Clad in azure mantles and purple brocade skirts, tiger talismans at their waists, lotus crowns upon their heads, they emerge to traverse the Nine Voids, entering the resounding Jade Ford. Preceded by the Black Thearchs, followed by the Six Ren, they descend to welcome me, ascending to the Purple Chamber. My name inscribed in the Supreme Highest, I become a Jade Perfected."*

After the incantation, release the hands from the ears, gaze at the star with eyes half-closed, and swallow the star’s twenty-seven beams of light, visualizing all five rays entering the throat. Once complete, strike the teeth three more times.

Practicing this for fourteen years, the Great Mystery August Lord of the Water Star will memorialize the Supreme Palace, inscribing your name upon the Jade Tablet of the Jasper Chamber. Your title will be fixed in the Upper Clarity’s Purple Script as Perfected Duke of the Upper Clarity.

The Water Star has five gates, each guarded by a Black Thearch, with one Thearch overseeing each gate to serve the Central Mysterious August Lord. This Mysterious August Lord is the supreme Perfected of the North, the exalted sovereign of the Great Mystery, who traverses the Upper Void and befriends the Purple Essence Dao Lord. The Black Thearchs guarding the gates may be called Black Numinous Lords, Black Spirits, Black Essences, or Black Thearch Lords, all serving the Central Great Mystery Black Perfected August Lord of the Supreme. By practicing the hidden Way of the Eight Simplicities, one may summon the descent of the Northern August Lord. Having mastered the external methods of the Five Numinosities, one may receive scriptures from the Black Thearch Lords. Rank and hierarchy determine the distinction between the hidden and the manifest in the Dao. On overcast evenings or when no stars are visible, one may practice this within the bedchamber. This is the secret Way of the Supreme Highest, the method for ascending to the Northern Asterism—not something earthbound immortals who walk the land may hear of.

The Nine Palaces of Jade Clarity, Upper Clarity, Great Ultimate, and Great Clarity each have their own officials—dukes, ministers, grandees, marquises, and earls—organized in bureaus of identical structure, mutually overseeing one another and all serving the Supreme. The palaces are arranged in order, similar in form, yet the Dao has its hierarchy of honor, and virtue and merit rise and fall.

The method for ascending to the Earth Star: The Earth Star’s round mirror, the essence of earth, stabilizes the Yellow Path. Within the Earth Star are four gates, each with four radiant beams extending four million leagues. Each gate is guarded by a Yellow Thearch, totaling four Yellow Thearchs, who serve and protect the Central Yellow Perfected Lord of Stabilization. At the star’s center resides the Central Yellow Perfected August Dao Lord, whose taboo name is Cangmu and whose style is Dan’yan. His consort’s taboo name is Kongyao and her style is Feixian. They govern within the Earth Star, overseeing the four gates, circulating the yellow garments and flowing qi, illuminating the Central Origin and shining upon those who study the Perfected. The method for ascending to it: visualize the Earth Star, focus the mind upon it, and press both hands to the heart. Once the heart is settled, raise the left hand to cover the Cavern Chamber, then hold the breath four times. Next, strike the teeth twenty-seven times, swallow saliva nine times, and with eyes half-closed, mentally invoke the Earth Star’s Perfected Lord and his consort by their taboo names and styles three times. Conclude by saying: *"May I, together with the Central August Dao Lord and his consort, ascend in the eight-scene golden chariot to the Upper Clarity Palace."*

Then, facing the star, recite softly: *"The four qi cycle and converge, pouring into the Central Origin. Gazing up at the Nine Poles, observing the four gates from the side, the Yellow Terrace and Purple Chamber ride the beams, scattering radiance. Numinous light billows and spreads, celestial blossoms fall like jade vessels. Within stands the Yellow August Lord, whose style is Dan’yan. His consort’s hidden virtue is called Feixian. They harmonize destiny and qi, guide the mysterious and irrigate the origin. Clad in yellow clouds, dragon-embroidered brocade and tiger-skirt, waist bearing the golden tally, head wrapped in the purple coronet, they emerge to traverse the Mysterious Void, unfolding light at the Golden Gate. Preceded by the Yellow Thearchs, followed by the Six Ji, they descend to welcome me, ascending to the celestial palace. My name inscribed in the Supreme Highest, carved upon the jade slips, I soar through the Great Void to become a Jade Minister."*

After the incantation, release the hands from the Cavern Chamber, gaze at the star with eyes half-closed, and swallow the star’s twenty-seven beams of light, visualizing all four rays entering the throat. Once complete, strike the teeth three more times.

Practicing this for fourteen years, the Central Yellow Perfected August Lord of the Earth Star will memorialize the Supreme Palace, inscribing your name upon the Azure Terrace’s jade slips and fixing your title in the Nine Mysteries’ cinnabar script as Perfected Duke of the Upper Clarity, befriending the Four Poles’ supreme Perfected Ones.

The Earth Star has four gates, each guarded by a Yellow Thearch, with one Thearch overseeing each gate to serve the Central Yellow Perfected August Lord. This Central Yellow Perfected August Lord is the exalted sovereign of the Central Ultimate, who traverses the Supreme Subtlety and befriends the Primordial Dao Lord. The Yellow Thearchs guarding the gates may be called Yellow Numinous Lords, Yellow Spirits, Yellow Essences, or Yellow Thearch Lords, all serving the Central Yellow Perfected Lord. By practicing the secret Way of the Eight Simplicities, one may summon the descent of the Yellow Perfected Dao Lord. Having mastered the external methods of the Five Numinosities, one may receive scriptures from the Yellow Thearchs. On overcast nights or when no stars are visible, practice this within the bedchamber, visualizing the Five Directions in the same manner. The Perfected say: visualizing the stars indoors is no different from seeing them. Do not abandon the practice simply because the stars are not visible. This is the Supreme Highest’s hidden Way, the secret method for ascending to the Asterisms.

When swallowing the star’s radiance, fully visualize the star’s Perfected August Lord and his consort descending within the light, entering the mouth and being swallowed. With eyes half-closed, faintly perceive their forms. This is Master Li’s oral instruction.

Consistently practicing the Supreme Highest’s hidden methods to summon and visualize the Five Stars’ August Lords, within five years, their forms will faintly appear. After seven years, all will manifest, and you will journey with them. After fourteen years, the Five August Lords will unite and descend together, sharing a chariot of mysterious blossoms and three-ply purple clouds. Preceded by the Five Thearchs and followed by ten thousand Perfected, the Five August Lords will take you aboard, ascending in broad daylight to the asterisms, ascending to the Jade Clarity to receive scriptures and be named an Upper Perfected of the Upper Clarity.

On the day the Supreme Highest’s hidden scriptures of the Five August Lords of the Five Stars attain communion, the Supreme Highest keeps this day secret, not revealing it even to the immortals and Perfected of the Nine Palaces. Only those whose names are inscribed in the Golden Pavilion’s Great Mystery Jade Script will know of this day when it arrives. The Five Communions are days when celestial essence opens and flourishes, auspicious gatherings of the supreme Perfected, days of celebration for the myriad spirits and ten thousand immortals.

The dates are:
- Sixth day of the first month at noon,
- First day of the second month at dusk,
- Seventh day of the third month at midnight,
- Ninth day of the fourth month at breakfast,
- Fifteenth day of the fifth month at midnight,
- Third day of the sixth month at noon,
- Seventh day of the seventh month at midnight,
- Fourth day of the eighth month at noon,
- Twentieth day of the ninth month at dawn,
- First day of the tenth month at dawn,
- Sixth day of the eleventh month at midnight,
- Twelfth day of the twelfth month at midnight.

On these twelve days, the Five Stars’ August Perfected Dao Lords of the Supreme ascend to the Upper Clarity and Jade Clarity to meet the Nine Mysteries’ Supreme Highest Dao Lord.

Moreover, the Thousand Perfected and the Thirty-Six Heavenly Emperors, descending to the Flying Immortals of the Great Clarity and above, all gather in celebration at the Supreme Ultimate’s Upper Palace. They deliberate upon the diligence or negligence of those in the world who seek the True, recording the names of those who study the True. These shall be inscribed upon the Golden Pavilion and the verdicts written upon the petal-script tablets. They assess the merits and transgressions of the seven generations of those who seek the True, determining the depth of their offenses and the severity of their punishments, thereby establishing ranks among the Perfected according to their sins.

If one’s seven generations are without fault and one’s own efforts are diligent, all shall be inscribed upon the petal-script tablets and engraved with jade characters, and one shall be appointed as a Left Perfected Lord of the Upper Clarity. If one’s seven generations bear many sins yet one’s own efforts are diligent, one shall still be ranked as a Lesser Perfected. If one’s ancestors have accumulated sins and one’s own transgressions are many, even if one’s efforts are not entirely negligent, one shall only attain the rank of a Lesser Immortal. Sins committed first cannot be erased by merit, nor can grave transgressions be absolved by diligence alone.

These Five Convergences are auspicious gatherings for the dissolution of sins and the erasure of transgressions. If you know these days, there is hope. When the Five Perfected ascend to court, it is called the Five Convergences, for their perception is far-reaching and every minute detail is illuminated. If you wish to beseech on these days for the removal of your seven ancestors’ offenses and your own past transgressions, I shall command the Three Officials to petition for the lifting of your punishments, report directly to the Heavenly Emperor to expunge your records of sin, absolve your servitude, and disperse your books of misfortune, allowing your seven generations to roam freely and joyously. You, having attained the True, shall bring blessings to your forebears—would this not be fitting?

Today, I grant you the means to prostrate yourself once and bring celebration to your seven generations—this is the essential Dao. Should you recklessly reveal that these days are the Five Convergences, your sins shall be increased fourfold, and though you repent a thousand times, it shall be of no avail.

The Perfected One seals his lips and writes in solitude, even in an open field, fearing that the slightest glance of a hundred creatures might violate the prohibition against disclosure. Can you not be deeply cautious? Can you not be deeply cautious?

Master Li says: On these days, enter a quiet chamber in seclusion, burn incense, face north, and bow five times. Silently invoke the names of the August Perfected Lords of the Five Stars and their consorts three times. Afterward, click your teeth five times, then remove your headscarf, kneel at length, and reverently address the August Perfected Lords of the Five Stars, Sun, and Moon, the Highest Perfected Lords and their consorts, the Jade Clarity’s Supreme August Lord of the Upper Clarity, and the Sagely Lord of the Great Dao before their thrones.

Thereupon, confess the myriad sins and transgressions of your seven ancestors, parents, and yourself, from past generations to the present, beseeching deliverance. Petition the Three Officials to report to the Heavenly Emperor, that your names of sin may be severed and released, your black tablets erased. Pray that you may accompany the Perfected of the Five Stars, together ascending to the Radiant Dawn, entering the Upper Clarity, and traversing the Jade Gate.

Recall the roots of your transgressions, enumerate the extent of your offenses, and confess freely, ensuring your words are sincere and exhaustive. On this day, your repentance shall ascend directly to the Supreme August One—this is the Supreme August One’s auspicious gathering, the Heavenly Immortals’ celebration of the August Highest Day. On this day, the Perfected Lords and Emperors present dragon robes, phoenix mantles, tiger belts, and flying garments to the August Highest One, for this day is treasured and grants absolution from punishment. Those who do not know these Five Convergence days shall not be included in the example of absolution.

Those who study the True must practice this constantly and conceal these days, allowing no one to know of them.

Later Sage Master Li says: On these days, contemplate auspicious matters, aspire to become a Flying Immortal, and cast aside all worries, lest your essence and soul be plunged into sorrow. Cultivate virtue, bestow kindness, relieve the destitute, perform meritorious deeds, and spread benevolence. Refrain from exercising authority or punishment—this is the Supreme August One’s auspicious day. On these days, the Supreme August One dispatches Jade Lads and Jade Maidens to secretly observe the sincerity of those who study the Dao. Even the unspoken intentions of your heart—whether good or evil—are known and shall be reported to the August Highest One. On these days, purify yourself, fast, and do good—this is the essential teaching.

Later Sage Master Li, having received the Mysterious Teachings and attained the completion of the Dao, ascended to the Upper Clarity Palace in the carriage of the Eight Effulgences, where he received the scriptures and was appointed as the Golden Watchtower’s Imperial Lord. On the day of his departure, he personally inscribed the names of the August Perfected Lords of the Five Stars’ Central August and their consorts, along with the Supreme August One’s Five Convergence auspicious days. One copy was written on white jade tablets in cinnabar script, sealed in a cloud-petal casket, and stamped with the Three Luminaries’ seal. It was entrusted to the Western Marchmount Hua Yin Mountain, placed within a plain stone coffer, and inscribed upon the coffer with the words: *The Treasure of Heaven and Earth, the Hidden Wonder of the Sacred Mountains.*

Another copy was written on azure jade tablets in yellow jade script, sealed in a phoenix-jade casket, and stamped with the Audience of the Perfected seal. It was entrusted to the Eastern Marchmount Tai Mountain, placed within a green stone coffer, and inscribed upon the coffer with the words: *The Profound Writ of the Ten Heavens, the Secluded Vault of the Supreme Spirits.*

Another copy was written on dark jade tablets in azure jade script, sealed in a jade-steel casket, and stamped with the Great Mystery seal. It was entrusted to the Southern Marchmount Heng Mountain, placed within a yellow stone coffer, and inscribed upon the coffer with the words: *The Lofty Treasure of the Eight Mysteries, the Sacred Enclosure of the Supreme Perfected.*

Another copy was written on golden tablets in azure jade script, sealed in a vermilion-jade casket, and stamped with the August Highest seal. It was entrusted to the Northern Marchmount Heng Mountain, placed within a white stone coffer, and inscribed upon the coffer with the words: *The Supreme Dao of the Seven Spirits, the Exalted Palace of the Supreme Perfected.*

Another copy was written on azure jade tablets in golden script, sealed in a patterned-jade casket, and stamped with the Central Yellow seal. It was entrusted to the Central Marchmount Song Gao Mountain, placed within a dark stone coffer, and inscribed upon the coffer with the words: *The Separate Treasury of the Nine Heavens, the Abyssal Repository of the Five Marchmounts.*

One copy each was entrusted to the Five Marchmounts, to be guarded and preserved by the Lords of the Five Marchmounts.

On the auspicious assembly of the *ren-chen* day, when the Sagely Lord descends, he shall command the summoning of the Five Marchmounts to bring forth these coffered scriptures, entrusting them to the Supreme Minister and the Four Assistants, that they may instruct those of the highest Perfected talent.

Another copy shall be inscribed upon white silk adorned with the eightfold radiance, written in self-generating script. The graded incantations and explanations shall be set forth as the method for attaining Perfection: the practices of exhalation and inhalation, advance and retreat, and the quest for the Way of Ascending the Five Celestial Bodies. Divided into five parts, it shall be titled for the days of absolving transgressions: *The Hidden Writ of the Supreme Lord, the Eightfold Simplicity Perfected Scripture.* It shall be entrusted to the Perfected of the Great Void, the Red Lord of the Southern Marchmount, to transmit below to those who study the Dao, who bear the characters of true gold and jade inscribed within the Golden Pavilion, and who are destined to become Perfected Ones. It must not be transmitted beyond to earthbound immortals.

Those who obtain *The Hidden Writ of the Supreme Lord in Eightfold Simplicity* shall have their names of mystery recorded in the Purple Palace and their jade appellations carved in the Upper Clarity. They shall receive the mandate to become Perfected Ones, and thus shall they obtain it. Among the common folk, in ten thousand times ten thousand, there may be one whom the celestial spirits deign to instruct, thereby obtaining this scripture. Some may receive it yet fail to practice it—all are but couriers of karmic transmission, destined to serve the Perfected Ones above. Have no doubt: even those who receive but do not practice shall become immortals through the corpse-liberation, though they shall not attain the rank of flying immortals or Perfected Ones. After corpse-liberation, they shall gradually traverse the path of the most wondrous, awakening from the delusions of their hearts. Though the years may pass, it is but a brief span before they return to the True and transcend their traces.

Strive on, child! Conceal yourself well!

The Perfected of the Great Void, having received the teaching, descended and proclaimed: "This is the numinous writ of the Supreme Lord, the wondrous Dao of Ascending the Dawn."

The Lord Minister Wang declared: "Within a hundred years, there may be two worthy of transmission. If one receives the resonance of the true numina, they too may be entrusted, but within seven hundred years, only three transmissions are permitted." All must purify themselves for seven days before bestowing this scripture; the recipient must do likewise. They shall further exchange vows and oaths to awaken their resolve.

For those who receive and practice the Way of the Five Stars to attain the Perfected Ones above, they shall offer their master of the scriptures forty feet of white silk and two pairs of silver rings. For those who undertake the cultivation of the Five Penetrations, they shall offer their master of the scriptures thirty-two feet of blue cloth, pledging a lifelong covenant sealed in blood, an unbroken vow of secrecy. Thereupon, the Three Offices shall directly memorialize the Celestial Emperor, who shall request the Jade Maidens to attend the recipient. They shall directly memorialize the Upper Clarity, which shall request the Jade Lads to serve the numinous writ of the *Eightfold Simplicity.* Each shall be attended by thirty-two, who shall record the transgressions and merits of the scripture’s keeper, noting even the slightest infraction to inscribe in the Upper Palace.

Should one who is unworthy receive it, or should it be transmitted beyond its allotted time, or should its hidden words be revealed, its auspicious days disclosed, or its oaths and secret pledges disregarded, all shall violate the *Bright Statutes of the Four Poles* and incur the crime of divulging sealed mysteries. Their three generations of ancestors and parents shall be examined by the Three Offices; their bodies shall become lowly ghosts, lashed with the stones of Mount Meng, bound to the Five Marchmounts, and made to draw the waters of the Dark Sea to irrigate the Four Waterways. Deprived of all hope for immortality, they shall endure the seven trials of the earthly prisons.

At the time of transmission and during the period of cultivation, you must be most meticulous and reverent, ever treasuring and guarding its secrecy. The Supreme Lord’s earnest admonition to Lord Li was precisely to prevent the loss of the Dao.

Moreover, this scripture bears the taboo names and characters of the Five August Perfected Lords of the Dao, the Lords’ Consorts, and the days of the Five Penetrations. These must not be disclosed to the living, lest they compound the burden of its secrecy.

The later Sagely Lord Li said: "If you dwell among the common folk and have not yet cultivated the utmost Dao, and should the hundred evils, thousand demons, and myriad specters assail your spirit and qi, at midnight face the Five Directions, hold your breath five times, and silently recite the inscription from the stone coffer of the Five Marchmounts three times. Begin with the Western Marchmount’s white jade tablets, then inscribe one copy each for the remaining four Marchmounts—though not extending to the white silk chapters—and recite them three times. Upon completing the three recitations, knock your teeth together thirty-six times to dispel the hundred evils, restrain the three hun-souls, and subdue the seven po-souls.

This incantation is not found in the exoteric scriptures of the Dao; it has no fixed verses. Yet the hundred evils, the three hun, and the seven po shall have no fear of it. If the outer titles alone can restrain the hundred evils and regulate the hun and po, how much more potent are the treasures sealed within the stone coffers?

The myriad ghosts and spirits, the thousand evils and myriad demons, all roam the famous mountains, driven as servants by the various numina. Yet upon seeing the inscribed title of the Five Marchmounts’ Lord Li on the stone coffer, they flee in terror, ignorant of what scripture lies within. Daoists should regularly recite this inscribed text, for the ghosts and spirits shall assume one is practicing the scripture within the coffer and thus dare not approach."

**Oral Instructions of the Perfected of the Great Void**

The Perfected of the Great Void said: "My former master taught that on the days of the Five Penetrations, when the sun has risen three or four *zhang*, stand upright and face it with your heart. Visualize the three hun-souls and the sunlight entering your heart together. After a long while, hold your breath for three breaths, swallow your saliva three times, and softly recite:

*‘The radiance of the Great Yang scatters its light,
Purple and azure rays descend.
Enter my hun-souls,
Illumine my fivefold form.
Repel the testing ghosts,
Set my heart aright.
Within, penetrate the nine qi;
Without, connect to the embryo’s destiny.
Fly as an immortal to the Upper Clarity,
The jade register is already fixed.’*

Upon completing the recitation, wipe your eyes fourteen times and knock your teeth fourteen times. This practice shall cause the three hun-souls to congeal and brighten, the cinnabar heart to become upright and true. All the arts of the myriad evils shall be rendered powerless, and the testing of the heart shall cease. This is the essential Dao—practice it constantly.

On the days of the Five Penetrations, face the sun and induce sneezing. If sneezing does not come, use a soft object to gently stimulate the nose while facing the sun, and sneezing shall follow. Upon sneezing, recite..."

The celestial radiance advances,
The six embryos ascend and connect above,
The three hun-souls guard the spirit,
The seven po-souls do not perish.
Receive the sun’s sneeze and chant,
Sharing its light with the sun.
Fly as an immortal to the Upper Clarity,
Attain the rank of Perfected Lord.

Upon completing the recitation, wipe your eyes twenty-seven times. This causes the inner essence to rise and merge with the sunlight, the three hun-souls to shine forth within, opening the heart and liberating the spirit, while the hundred essences flow and circulate through the inner palace. If it is not one of the Five Penetration days, this need not be done.

Moreover, on the days of *yǐ-mǎo* in spring, *bǐng-wǔ* in summer, *gēng-shēn* in autumn, and *rén-zǐ* in winter, at the time of retiring in darkness, first grind cinnabar, realgar, and orpiment in equal parts until fine, then wrap them in silk to form a ball the size of a jujube. At bedtime, insert these into both ears. This is the Dao of dispelling the Three Corpses and refining the seven po-souls—a secret method. Let no one else know of it.

The next day at noon, bathe in east-flowing water. Afterward, renew the bedding and mat, change into freshly laundered clothes, replace your shoes, and wash them as well. Then sweep and purify the area beneath the bed where you sleep, ensuring the entire chamber is immaculate. Reset the pillow, lie facing upward, hold your breath, and clench your fists. After a long while, softly recite:

The Dao of Heaven is constant,
Transforming the old to make it new.
On this auspicious day of the Highest Emperor,
I bathe to become true.
The Three Qi dispel the corpse,
Cinnabar and yellow stabilize the soul.
The precious refinement of the seven po-souls
Draws them near to me.

Upon completing the recitation—this is the supreme method for dispelling corpse impurities and renewing the form, the essential formula for transformation. Perform it once in each of the four seasons.

When transmitting this scripture and imparting its instructions, ensure that the Jade Lads and Jade Maidens above always observe and note the recipient’s conduct and whereabouts, examining the roots of their heart’s secrets to see whether they have fully grasped them. You must understand the intent of this passage. Those who receive these instructions must guard against private dissemination or using them to seek relief from hunger and cold.

Those who violate this shall have their bodies consigned to the Three Bureaus, becoming base and defiled ghosts; the Three Bureaus shall then impose this transgression as a fault upon their three generations of ancestors. This is the covenant oath of the Most High, the sacred pact sealed in blood.

When one enters the famous mountains on the day of ascension to immortality, all such texts must be deposited among the rivers, forests, valleys, and grotto-chambers—or bestowed upon those who dwell as recluses in the mountains. Should one pass through the Great Yin and, at the moment of departure, receive no numinous revelation or response to leave behind instructions, one must carry the texts along. The same applies to those who have received the scriptures. At that time, the Mysterious Center will surely manifest dreams and signs for verification; the Jade Lads of the Upper Clarity shall illuminate the truth of one’s form and words, and naturally make dispositions, carefully determining what is fitting.

Here ends the *Upper Clarity Most High Eightfold Simplicity Perfected Scripture*.
