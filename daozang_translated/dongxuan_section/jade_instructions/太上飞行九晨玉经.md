*The Supreme Jade Scripture of Soaring Through the Nine Mornings*

The *Supreme Jade Scripture of Soaring Through the Nine Mornings*. Its compiler is unknown, though it likely emerged during the Eastern Jin or Southern Dynasties. According to quotations in the *Supreme Secret Essentials*, this scripture was originally a chapter within the *Supreme Scripture of the Ninefold Returning Dao of Soaring Feathered Flight*, later extracted as an independent text. It comprises one scroll. Base text from: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, Dongxuan Section, Jade Instructions Category. Collated with: *Inner Mystery Scripture of the River Chart of Supreme Clarity* and *Golden Simplified Jade Characters of the Heavenly Steps and Earthly Records of the Supreme Clarity Scripture of the Great Tenuity Emperor Lord*.

---

The Supreme Lord of the Great Dao addressed the Perfected Duke of the Northern Pole, saying: "In times past, I roamed the northern heavens, steering my chariot through the Vast Cold, treading upon the Florid Canopy, my hands parting the Nine Origins. I wandered the Cloud Palaces of Leisurely Radiance, sported in the Northern Mystery, roamed the chambers of the Northern Darkness, and beheld the gates of the Cavernous Millennia. Gazing upon the revolving jade pivot, I summoned the turning of kalpas; hastening the conjunction of epochs, I danced the Wheel of Offerings. Sighing at the withering of the myriad beings, I looked down upon the enduring existence of heaven and earth—thus did I perceive the marvels of the Nine Stars and awaken to the supreme numen of the Dipper’s Handle.

The Nine Stars are indeed the spiritual root of the Nine Heavens, the luminous beam of sun and moon, the abyssal origin of the ten thousand kinds. Thus, heaven possesses nine qi, and the Nine Stars are their subtle essence; earth possesses the Nine Provinces, and the Nine Stars are their divine lords; humans possess nine apertures, and the Nine Stars are their life repositories; the Nine Palaces of yin and yang have the Nine Stars as their gates; the Five Peaks and Four Seas have the Nine Stars as their abyssal courts. The Five and Nine arrayed in ranks, their guiding threads endless, they govern the celestial lodges, revolve the Three Luminaries, regulate the Four and Five, ensuring heaven and earth endure—whence the ten thousand kinds take them as their origin, and gods and immortals rely upon them.

If heaven lacked the Nine Stars, it would have no means to attain lofty purity; if earth lacked the Nine Stars, it would have no means to attain supreme numen; if humans lacked the Nine Stars, their nine apertures would remain dim. The Celestial Thearch combines them to commune with the Perfected; gods and immortals rely upon them to attain completion; the Five Phases ride them to achieve transcendence; the myriad beings receive them to attain life.

When heaven is clear and earth tranquil, the Nine Stars shine resplendent; when heaven is agitated and earth obstructed, the Nine Stars darken and dim. The revolving pivot summons the kalpa’s appointed time; the Celestial Pass regulates the qi of the Five Phases. They convey the great axle of the Hollow Void, hastening the responsive conjunctions of the Nine Heavens. Thus does divine radiance revolve and blaze, the Dark Surveillance overseeing the myriad lives. When they traverse positions obliquely, they announce omens of fortune and calamity.

It is by the Nine Stars’ weaving and turning that heaven and earth undergo the great conjunctions of cosmic cycles, and the Hundred and Six respond to their tally. When yin and yang violently clash, the two qi obstruct and agitate, heaven overturns and earth collapses, the Nine Seas merge into darkness, gold and jade dissolve and vanish—yet not even the tip of a hair is lost. All is determined by the revolutions of the Nine Stars and the hastening of the revolving pivot.

To comprehend the workings of heaven and earth and the subtleties of the Dark Net is to attain its mean—whereupon one may tread the hidden steps of the Hollow Constant, conceal one’s radiance and elude form, transform the Three Luminaries, and instantly perfect the myriad beings. The black specks of concealment and submersion bear twenty-five names; their purport is profound and recondite, too secret to transmit below.

Above dwell the Nine Luminous Lords of the Mornings; within reside the Nine August Ladies. Their ethereal souls and numinous spirits are all the majestic deities of the Nine Dippers, exhaling the radiance of the Seven Luminaries, streaming their light through the gates of the Nine Heavens. They illumine the dark and empty, leaving no trace unmanifest.

When their yang rays blaze, they become the Flowing Gold Fire Bells; when their yin rays gleam, they become the Vast and Falling Seven Origins—all are the numinous strategies of the Loftiest, the majestic chapters of the Primordial Beginning. The oral instructions of the Dragon-Soaring Measured Silk are concealed within the unspoken, arrayed beneath the Florid Canopy of the Mornings. When one offers the sheep’s sore to the heavens to summon the Perfected, then the Dark Radiance obliquely illumines the covenant ground, the Nine Mornings descend upon the numinous chamber, the Ladies rejoice upon their couches, and the Dark Dipper records names in the Hidden Writ.

One who knows this Dao, by merely preserving it, may escape the great kalpic conjunctions and traverse the vast calamities of the jia-shen era. Cultivating it for two times seven years, one may don the vast wings of the wild swan and soar aloft, cleaving the Purple Empyrean to ascend the mornings.

This is the supreme Dao of the Jade Clarity—it does not compare to the middling immortals of the Supreme Clarity. The Jade Clarity is the lofty Perfected of the Supreme Clarity; the Supreme Clarity is the lofty spirits of the Grand Clarity; the Grand Clarity is the lofty numina of the Flying Immortals.

Those who practice the Dao of the Jade Clarity, when they emerge, have all the heavens attend their chariots, with jade lads and jade maidens—three thousand each—serving them. They bear the thirty-seven-colored standards, ride the twelve-jeweled wheels of the purple-cloud flying chariot, with phoenix songs leading the way and the Dark Zither following behind. The Six Masters clear the path, and flying dragons flank the shafts. Their rank accords with the High Immortals, arrayed in the charts of the Jade Clarity.

Those who practice the Dao of the Supreme Clarity, when they emerge, have the Five Lodges as their attendants, with jade lads and jade maidens—one thousand five hundred each—serving them. They bear the purple-feathered standards, ride the flying-cloud cinnabar carriage, with phoenixes and simurghs leading the way and the Heavenly Zither played behind. Dark dragons clear the path, and the Five Thearchs attend the chariot. Their rank accords with the left and right ministers of the Supreme Clarity.

Those who practice the Dao of the Grand Clarity, when they emerge, have the Five Thearchs as their attendants, with jade lads and jade maidens—eight hundred each—serving them. They bear the five-colored standards, ride the dragon carriage of flying mist, with nine phoenixes wailing ahead and eight simurghs singing behind. White hornless dragons clear the path, and the Grand Tie attend the chariot.

Thus, among the Perfected there are degrees of loftiness, and within the Mysterious there are gradations of rank. The Dao of the Jade Clarity is profoundly distant and utterly remote—it does not compare to the middling Perfected or the ranks of Flying Immortals.

The Nine Stars’ method of aligning with the Dark Radiance is a Dao I received from the Primordial Beginning. For seven hundred million kalpas, through the formation and dissolution of heaven and earth, the rise and fall of the myriad kinds, this Dao alone has endured. Even now, I cultivate it above the cloudy radiance, yet cannot forget it in due season—so enamored am I of this Dao’s loftiness and marvel, and so delighted in the Ladies’ company.

Moreover, those who in this life first learn the soaring flight of the wild swan, yet know not the hidden art of treading the void—how shall they ever push open the gates of the layered empyreans and witness the beginning and end of heaven and earth?"

Without this Dao, you will remain estranged from the Nine Mornings’ domain, and the Ladies’ transcendent wanderings will forever elude you. Though you may possess an illustrious name in the imperial registers, soaring high and surpassing all, you will only be able to ride cloud-dragons and roam the Five Peaks—merely avoiding death, nothing more. Thus, to tread the Dipper’s handle, circle the Flowery Morn, and ascend through the radiant jade heavens shall remain beyond your reach for ages to come.

You are now tasked with governing the kalpic tides, presiding over the celestial statutes of the Ten Heavens, and adjudicating the records of gods and immortals. It is fitting that you receive this method to guide the myriad lives. I now transmit it to you—guard it well and cultivate it in secret.

The Perfected of the Nine Mornings said: To practice the Dao of flying steps, first bathe and purify yourself a day prior. On the appointed day, lay out the star chart in the central courtyard, aligning it with the Dipper’s monthly station. Kneel facing north, burn incense beneath the Dark Radiance star, and strike your teeth thirty-six times. With eyes closed, visualize the Year Star at your left flank, the Grand White Star at your right flank, the Sparkling Deluder Star above your head, the Chronogram Star below your navel, and the Quelling Star at your heart.

Next, drape your robe over the Nine Stars. First raise your left hand, bending it above your head in the Dipper’s shape. Visualize the Yang Brightness Star in your left palm, the Yin Essence Star at your left elbow, the Perfected Person at your left breast, and the Dark Radiance Star at your navel—hence the incense is burned beneath the Dark Radiance Star, so that your intentions may ascend and resonate with celestial clarity. Visualize the Cinnabar Prime Star at your right thigh, the Northern Culmen Star at your right knee, the Celestial Barrier Star at your right calf, the Auxiliary Star below your navel, and the Corrector Star above your head. When complete, softly recite the incantation:

*"I robe myself in the Celestial Dipper,
don a golden kerchief,
mount the stalwart handle,
enter the Dipper’s gate,
pay homage to the Perfected,
bow to the Flowery Morn.
The twenty-eight lodgings
envelop my body.
Riding the void, stepping the ethereal,
I ascend in flight, weightless."*

When finished, swallow qi nine times and stop.

Next, raise your right hand in the Dipper’s shape above your head. Visualize the Yang Brightness Star returning to your right palm, the Yin Essence Star at your right elbow, the Perfected Person at your right breast, the Dark Radiance Star at your heart, the Cinnabar Prime Star at your left thigh, the Northern Culmen Star at your left knee, the Celestial Barrier Star at your left calf, the Corrector Star at your left brow, and the Auxiliary Star at your right eye. When complete, softly recite the incantation:

*"I ride the celestial stalwart,
step the Nine Origins,
tread the Dipper’s handle,
practice flying immortality,
attain the celestial mind.
The myriad spirits submit,
my form conceals, my radiance hides,
transforming in myriad ways.
Should any dare obstruct,
bind them at the Dipper’s gate,
sweep away misfortune,
rectify the true and luminous.
To my left gleam the fire bells,
to my right shine the numinous banners.
My awe-inspiring radiance spans ten thousand leagues,
my whistle summons all before me.
What the Jade Emperor has decreed
shall unfailingly come to pass."*

When finished, swallow qi sixteen times and stop.

Next, mount the Dipper and circle beyond its stars, stepping the Dipper’s hun and po. From the Celestial Pivot Star, face the Yang Brightness Star. Then ascend to the Celestial Rotation and Celestial Jade Stars, proceeding in order to the Hidden Prime Star. Circle back and forth three times, then upon the Hidden Prime Star, chant the *Three Caverns’ Flying Void Chapter* before ascending to the Yang Brightness Star.

Stand and visualize the Lady’s form as described earlier.

The first star, the Celestial Pivot, is the hun-spirit of the Yang Brightness Star. The Celestial Pivot’s might is unshining, its light unilluminating; it permeates the Great Void, spanning nine hundred and twenty leagues, and faces the northwest gate of the Yang Brightness Star. This star is called the *Palace of the Primordial Dipper’s Stalwart Essence, Supreme Perfected August Lady of the Nine Mornings*. Her surname is Illuminating Pervasion, her taboo name is Dark Mystery, and her true name is Supreme Essence. She wears a flying-cloud flowery topknot, her remaining hair cascading to her waist. She is clad in a three-colored robe of purple, yellow, and azure, girdled with a nine-belled sash. Her mouth constantly exhales a radiance of azure qi, which pours onto the Yang Brightness Star, brightening its brilliance.

When practicing the flying steps, first visualize the Lady’s surname, taboo name, and form. Then recite the incantation, so that her hun-spirit may become serene and upright, the Bright Star rejoice in awe, and the celestial radiance thoroughly illuminate, allowing both hun and shadow to ascend together to the Morn.

Stand with feet together upon the Celestial Pivot Star, facing the Yang Brightness Star. Place your left hand over your heart, point your right hand at the Yang Brightness Star, strike your teeth nine times, swallow saliva nine times, and hold your breath for three cycles. Then softly recite the incantation:

*"Celestial Consorts of the Nine Stars,
congeal qi and refine the true.
The seven luminaries entwine,
styled the Jade Morn.
Above, they erect the flowery canopy;
below, they tread the Dipper’s handle.
Their bodies ride the celestial mechanism,
flying steps upon the jasper carriage.
Hun-essence and po-spirit
unite with form to become immortal.
Preserving the primordial sun and moon,
heaven and earth endure forever.
Transforming with the kalpic tides,
they join the Ladies in unbroken ascent,
rising to the Nine Heavens,
floating radiance naturally follows."*

When finished, hold your breath for three cycles. Then step with your left foot onto the Celestial Rotation Star, advance your right foot to join the left, and circulate qi.

The second star, the Celestial Rotation, is the hun-spirit of the Yin Essence Star. The Celestial Rotation’s radiance is distant yet luminous, shining yet unflickering. It permeates the Great Void, spanning five hundred and fifty leagues, and faces the west gate of the Yin Essence Star. This star is called the *Palace of the Dark Dipper’s Void Essence, Supreme Mysterious August Lady*. Her surname is Mystic Mirror, her taboo name is Seething Brilliance, and her true name is Golden Return. She wears a flying-cloud flowery topknot, her remaining hair cascading to her waist. She is clad in a flying brocade skirt and phoenix-patterned brocade cloak, girdled with a numinous flying purple sash. Her mouth constantly exhales a radiance of black qi, which pours onto the Yin Essence Star, brightening its splendor.

When practicing the flying steps, visualize the Lady’s surname, taboo name, and form. Stand with feet together upon the Celestial Rotation Star, facing the Yin Essence Star. Place your left hand over your heart, point your right hand at the Yin Essence Star, strike your teeth nine times, swallow saliva nine times, and hold your breath for nine cycles. Then softly recite the incantation:

*"Northern Mysterious August Spirit,
the Nine Heavens open to clarity.
Jade splendor subtly illumines,
weaving the Purple Court.
Today I practice flying steps,
the myriad paths shine brightly.
Hun and po become serene and upright,
peacefully attaching to my form.
Let none take flight alone—
together we ascend to the Northern Star.
Above, I inhale the dark essence,
drink the jade spring.
Transforming through the nine subtleties,
I preserve life and celestial numen."*

When finished, hold your breath for three cycles, then advance your left foot to tread upon the Celestial Mechanism Star, followed by your right foot to join it, and release your breath.

The third, the Celestial Mechanism Star, is the po-essence of the Perfected Person Star. The Celestial Mechanism Star is fierce yet not manifest, radiant yet not dazzling, subtly pervading the Great Void, spanning seven hundred and seventy li. It faces the southeast gate of the Perfected Person Star. This star is called the Palace of Supreme Essence, the Spirit Consort Yuanhuang, Lady of Primordial Augustness. Her surname is Everbright, her taboo name is Transforming Cloud, and her true name is Flowing Flame. She wears the Morning Infant Treasure Crown upon her head, a robe of luminous cloud brocade, and a sash of the Six Mountains’ Dawn Flight. Her mouth constantly exhales the essence of yellow qi, directing it upon the Perfected Person Star to illumine the star’s brilliance.

When practicing the flying steps, visualize the Lady’s surname, taboo name, and form. Stand with feet together upon the Celestial Mechanism Star, facing the Perfected Person Star. Place your right hand over your heart, point your left hand at the Perfected Person Star, strike your teeth nine times, swallow saliva nine times, and hold your breath for twelve cycles. Then softly recite the incantation:

*"Primordial August Spirit Consort,
true essence of the Nine Stars,
above you govern the Mechanism’s measure,
overseeing all heavens.
Below you examine the myriad regions,
purple mist swirls in the turning light.
Today is supremely auspicious,
the Yellow Path unfolds.
Moisture flows beyond the nine bounds,
curving to bathe my form.
Flying in Yu’s steps,
I ascend to the Emperor’s Dawn,
sharing the August One’s brow,
eternally enjoying kalpas of years."*

When finished, hold your breath for three cycles, then advance your left foot to tread upon the Celestial Balance Star, followed by your right foot to join it, and release your breath.

The fourth, the Celestial Balance Star, is the po-essence of the Dark Mystery Star. The Celestial Balance Star is faint and concealed, hidden yet subtly luminous, subtly shining through the Great Void, spanning eight hundred li. It faces the east gate of the Dark Mystery Star. This star is called the Palace of Fundamental Extremity, the Supreme Spirit Consort Huahuang, Lady of August Flower. Her surname is Opening Life, her taboo name is Moving Brightness, and her true name is Infant Barrier. She wears a crown of seven measures, a robe of crimson silk with phoenix patterns, and a sash of golden numen and jade light. Her mouth constantly exhales the essence of red qi, directing it upon the Dark Mystery Star to illumine the star’s radiance.

When practicing the flying steps, visualize the Lady’s surname, taboo name, and form. Stand with feet together upon the Celestial Balance Star, facing the Dark Mystery. Place your right hand over your heart, point your left hand at the Dark Mystery, strike your teeth nine times, swallow saliva three times, and hold your breath for three cycles. Then softly recite the prayer:

*"August Spirit Consort,
entitled Lady of Flower,
you pacify and guard the Flowery Canopy,
the Northern Supreme Palace.
To your left attend Jade Maidens,
to your right guard Spirit Lads.
You guide the seven essences,
radiance of the nine luminants.
For me, summon true power,
flying steps upon celestial firmness.
Let my hun and po,
together ascend to the Emperor’s Hall."*

When finished, hold your breath for three cycles, then advance your left foot to tread upon the Jade Balance, followed by your right foot to join it, and release your breath.

The fifth, the Jade Balance Star, is the hun-spirit of the Cinnabar Prime Star. The Jade Balance Star is vast yet silent, surging yet not resplendent, subtly pervading the Great Void, spanning seven hundred and twenty li. It faces the northeast gate of the Cinnabar Prime Star. This star is called the Palace of Recorded Brightness, the Central August Lady of the Golden Canopy in the North. Her surname is Primordial Square, her taboo name is Divine Martiality, and her true name is Sudden. She wears the Purple Dawn Flying Flower Crown upon her head, a robe of nine colors, and a sash of divine tiger jade patterns. Her mouth constantly exhales the light of white qi, directing it upon the Cinnabar Prime Star to illumine the star’s radiance.

When practicing the flying steps, visualize the Lady’s surname, taboo name, and form. Stand with feet together upon the Jade Balance Star, facing the Cinnabar Prime. Place your right hand over your heart, point your left hand at the Cinnabar Prime, strike your teeth three times, swallow saliva three times, and hold your breath for three cycles. Then softly recite the incantation:

*"Central August Consort,
dwelling in the Supreme Prime,
the Nine Ladles pour forth radiance,
essence blazes through the eight limits.
Swirling mist billows,
scattering numinous crimson chambers.
Let my po-spirit,
harmonize with heaven and earth.
Form and hun together ascend,
riding the void with jade reins,
crimson carriage and purple chariot.
Flying northward,
I receive the hidden scriptures."*

When finished, hold your breath for three cycles, then advance your left foot to tread upon the Open Yang Star, followed by your right foot to join it, and release your breath.

The sixth, the Open Yang Star, is the po-spirit of the Northern Culmen Star. The Open Yang Star is bright yet subtly illuminating, radiant yet not resplendent, penetrating the Great Void, spanning seven hundred and seventy li. It faces the lower opening of the Northern Culmen’s northern cavern gate. This star is called the Palace of Purple Culmen, the August Primordial Lady of Morning Flower, Anshang. Her surname is King Prime, her taboo name is Root Flower, and her true name is Dark Convergence. She wears the Jade Dawn Advancing Worthiness Crown upon her head, a robe of flying azure feathers, and a sash of flowing gold fire bells.

Then softly recite the incantation:

*"Emperor of the Nine Heavens,
ancestor of the Yellow Flower,
turning the jade mechanism,
governing the eight directions.
Let my flying steps
tread the celestial net’s records.
Reversing and intertwining,
three and five crosswise,
communing with the eight subtleties,
feathered robe of mysterious yellow.
Dragon carriage and jade light,
flying through the great void,
eternally enjoying long life,
sharing heaven and earth’s merit."*

When finished, hold your breath for five cycles, then advance your left foot to tread upon the Shaking Brilliance Star, followed by your right foot to join it, and release your breath.

The seventh, the Shaking Brilliance Star, is the great brightness of the hun-spirit of the Celestial Pass Star. The Shaking Brilliance Star’s light revolves through the empty void, circling the Celestial Pass. Subtly shining through the Great Void, it spans nine hundred li. Above, it faces the south gate of the Celestial Pass Star; below, it faces the Northern Culmen Star. This star is called the Palace of Heavenly Motion, the Jade Flower Spirit August Lady. Her surname is Measure Prime, her taboo name is Final Convergence, and her true name is Opening Light. She wears a topknot of flying flowers and crumbling clouds, her remaining hair flowing to her waist.

Her mouth only exhales the essence of red qi, directing it upon the Celestial Pass Star to illumine the star’s great light.

To practice the Dao of Flying Steps, one must visualize the surname, taboo name, and form of the Lady. Stand with feet together upon the Light-Spreading Star, facing the Celestial Pass Star. Place the left hand upon the heart and point the right hand toward the Celestial Pass. Knock the teeth nine times, swallow saliva nine times, and hold the breath for three cycles. Then softly intone the incantation:

*"Heaven and Earth revolve,
Seven lights shine brightly,
Nine qi spiral and flow,
Above in accord with Jade Clarity.
Within resides the Lady,
Named Flower Spirit.
Mysteriously reflecting beyond the Nine,
No hairbreadth remains unborn.
This day is most auspicious,
Flying steps ascend the Purple Court.
May my hun and po
Peacefully attach to my form,
Transforming through the empty void,
Exiting darkness, entering obscurity.
Heaven and Earth together revolve,
Unshaken for ten thousand kalpas.
Preserve immortality at Upper Primordial,
Nine Mornings unite in essence."*

Conclude by holding the breath for seven cycles. Then step with the left foot upon the Cavern-Luminous Star, advance the right foot to join it, and circulate qi.

The Eighth, the Cavern-Luminous Star, is the yang-bright essence-soul of the Auxiliary Star. The Cavern-Luminous Star’s light revolves through all heavens, gathering and conveying the upper constellations, flowing smoothly through the Great Void, spanning nine hundred and ninety li. Above, it faces the southwest gate of the Auxiliary Star. It lies upon the upper beam of the Celestial Pass, the yang radiance of the Northern Culmen. This star is called the Palace of Empty Perfection, the Ever-Bright Constant August Lady. Her surname is Dark Ascent, her taboo name is Without Rhyme, and her true name is Empty Transformation. She wears a topknot of flying clouds and crumbling flowers, her remaining hair flowing to her waist. She is clad in a flying gauze patterned robe, girded with a nine-light sash.

Then softly intone the incantation:

*"Three and Five take flight,
Heaven and Earth unfold.
Nine Primordials revolve the net,
Joining and binding the Upper Capital.
Celestial perfected scatter numinous power,
Myriad Ways overflow in prosperity.
The Lady curves her reflection,
This day is most auspicious.
Flying steps tread the Dipper’s soul,
Spiraling along the Jade Net.
Head bears the flowered canopy,
Feet tread the Constant Yang.
Playfully roaming the Three Clarities,
Transforming in ten thousand directions.
Preserve immortality naturally,
Enjoying boundless longevity."*

Conclude by holding the breath for twelve cycles. Then step with the left foot upon the Hidden Primordial Star, advance the right foot to join it, and circulate qi.

The Ninth, the Hidden Primordial Star, is the bright-empty numinous-soul of the Supporting Star. The Hidden Primordial Star conceals its breath beneath the flowered canopy, its subtle light shining within the empty void, spanning nine hundred and ninety li. Above, it faces the southeast gate of the Supporting Star. This star is called the Palace of Primordial Treasure, the Upper August Lady of Empty Mystery and Transformation. Her surname is Dark Pervasion, her taboo name is Myriad First, and her true name is Constant Yang. She wears a seven-tiered jade crown of flying clouds, a green-patterned brocade robe, and a nine-light night-illuminating girdle. Her mouth constantly exhales the essence of black qi, directing it upon the Supporting Star to illumine the hidden and radiant light of the cavernous void.

To practice the Dao of Flying Steps, one must visualize the surname, taboo name, and form of the Lady. Stand with feet together upon the Hidden Primordial Star, facing the Supporting Star. Place the left hand upon the heart and point the right hand toward the Supporting Star. Knock the teeth twelve times, swallow saliva once, and hold the breath for one cycle. Then softly intone the incantation:

*"Step upon the Heavenly Net,
Flying through the Feathered Gate.
Exiting and entering the Three Lives,
Escaping the body, concealed and submerged.
Transforming form and shadow,
A thousand unions, ten thousand divisions.
Spirit pacified, qi settled,
Refining and conveying the immortal soul.
The entire body ascends in flight,
Clad in brocade skirts.
Flowing bells intertwine,
Tiger-patterned pendants adorn the body.
Roaring and shouting at the Five Thearchs,
Wielding the reins to ride the luminous clouds.
Ascend to the Northern Culmen,
Paying homage to the August Lord."*

Conclude by holding the breath for one cycle, then return with feet together upon the Celestial Pivot Star. Perform the single step back and forth three times; no further visualization or incantation is required. The practice of treading the Dipper’s soul is thus complete. Cease visualization and incantation.

Upon first ascending a star, perform this once. After three repetitions back and forth, stand again upon the Celestial Pivot Star, facing the Yang-Bright Star, and sing the *Wandering and Roaming Nine Mornings Feathered Stanzas* three times. Then ascend the Net to the Yang-Bright Star and proceed with the Flying Steps.

The lyrics of the Feathered Stanzas are as follows:

*Cloud Net descends from Heaven’s Discipline,
Nine Dippers in the emerald jade void.
Purple canopy upon layered peaks,
Mysterious essence brightens the Eight Corners.
Above dwell the Nine Morning Guests,
Chanting and reciting hidden texts.
Flying steps roam the Northern Han,
Long life abides in Heaven and Earth.
Reining the Dark Feathered Terrace,
Flying through the Nine Primordials’ realm.
Cavernous void, deep and secluded,
Cloud Net soars through empty space.
Below are the gatherers of perfection,
Gazing upward at the Jade Morning Palace.
Three circuits upon the Yang-Bright,
Nine returns into the cavernous wilds.
High steps ascend the Imperial Honored,
Long songs in the Dragon-Flight tongue.
Jade auroras reflect the Northern Wastes,
Jasper branches with emerald hidden boughs.
Empty birth in the Nine Numinous Terrace,
Radiant essence shines through the Great Distant.
Celestial Pass revolves through layered darkness,
Kalpas and meetings repeatedly pass.
Riding my feathered chariot,
Flying steps weave the Weaving Maid’s River.
Preserve the numinous in empty constancy,
Forever forgetting Heaven and Earth’s excess.*

These three stanzas originate from the Jade Clarity Upper Palace. All the Nine Yang Jade Lads and Nine Flower Jade Maidens perpetually sing them upon the Flowered Morning to harmonize the exchange of form and soul and awaken the numinous perfected at the hidden pass.

In practicing the Dao of Flying Steps through the Seven Primordials and treading the Nine Stars, without these song-stanzas, one must not rashly ascend the Heavenly Net or tread the Dark Dipper. Violating this, the Nine Stars will seize one’s hun and po, confining them beneath the Dipper’s Net. This causes people to become wild and lose their nature, anger and delusion arising recklessly. Within three years, none will escape bodily death. It is not that the Dao does not wish for people to attain immortality, but rather that people cannot fathom the Dao’s profound source. How could one not proceed with care?

The Nine Stars are the roots of the Nine Heavens, the bright essence of Jade Clarity. The Nine Souls are the luminous numina of the Nine Stars. People merely know the wonders of treading the Seven Stars but remain ignorant of the supreme numinosity of the Nine Stars’ hun and po.

It is not that the Seven Stars do not wish to convey people to the Dipper, but rather that the hun, po, and spirit of the human body fear the numinous power of the Dipper’s stars and dare not ascend with them into the void. Those who wish to cultivate the Way of Flying Steps must know the hun and po of the Dipper Stars—the hidden esoteric instructions of the Nine August Ladies’ inner names and the Perpetual Void.

By practicing according to the chart, how could one fail to ascend the Northern Prime and pay homage above to the Radiant Dawn? Yet this Way is lofty and wondrous, a treasured secret of Jade Clarity not readily transmitted; few among the middle immortals have attained it. Those who know its method will see the Nine Stars inwardly illumine, the Ladies descend from their thrones, and the Dipper’s hun rejoice—together they will escort the practitioner into the inner palace of the Nine Primes.

The Yang Bright Star is Heaven’s Grand Commandant, governing transgressions and overseeing all matters. Above, it presides over the perfected of the Nine Heavens; in the middle, it supervises the flying immortals of the Five Peaks; below, it leads the true persons of later learners. The merits and faults of gods and spirits, the weight of their deeds—none are beyond its jurisdiction. The star spans nine hundred and twenty miles, its expanse all lapis lazuli and crystal. Within it stand jade trees bearing azure fruit, where golden-winged ravens roost. Spontaneously growing there are azure essence jade mushrooms; consuming a single mouthful grants a lifespan of ninety thousand years. The star has nine gates, each radiating four beams of light that silently illuminate nine hundred million miles. Above it stands the Azure City Jade Tower, where the Perfected of the Dipper resides, known as the Supreme Palace Azure City Jade Tower Nine Mornings Lord. His surname is Shangyun, his taboo name Fayingrong, and his style Dongdongyang Yaotianchui. He wears a Nine Mornings Jade Crown, robes of azure feathered flight, and holds the Mysterious Chart of the Dipper in his hands, seated within the Jade Tower. There exists a register of esoteric names, the Jade Record; one must know the Nine Mornings Lord’s inner taboo name. Those who know it will see the Jade Dawn inwardly illumine and the Mysterious Star descend in darkness. Cultivating this Way, one may soar through the Great Void and ascend into the Nine Gates.

To practice the Way of Flying Steps, first stand upon the Yang Bright Star. Press the right hand to the heart, point the left hand toward the northeast, hold the breath for nine cycles, click the teeth nine times, swallow saliva three times, and with eyes closed, visualize the Nine Mornings Lord’s surname, taboo name, and form. Remaining upon the Yang Bright Star, softly intone the incantation:

*"Flying Heaven’s Nine Mornings, above you occupy the Mysterious Chief,
Your might shakes the Eight Radiants, governing transgressions and rectifying wrongs.
Today I take the Flying Steps, ten thousand Ways open wide,
Nine Perfected align in splendor, heaven turns and earth revolves.
Ghostly schemes—necks severed; human rebels—crushed and felled.
The Three Bonds seize the wayward, the rebellious shall decline.
Divine spirits attend and guard, bestowing towering fortune.
Gaining Heaven’s heart, bones transform and form takes flight,
Hands grasp the Seven Nets, feet tread the Nine Gates.
Cloud-walking, rain-stepping, ascending to the Supreme Microcosm."*

When finished, turn left upon the Yang Bright Star nine times, then stand facing the Ghost Gate. Hold the breath for three cycles, step with the left foot onto the Yin Essence Star, advance the right foot to join it, and release the breath.

The Yin Essence Star is Heaven’s Grand Minister, governing official rank and destiny. Above, it presides over the celestial lodges; below, it leads the myriad spirits and those who study immortality. The fate and rank of all who cultivate the Way and of the common people—none are beyond its jurisdiction. The star spans five hundred and fifty miles, its expanse also lapis lazuli and crystal. Within it stand jade trees bearing black fruit, where golden-winged ravens roost. Spontaneously growing there are mysterious mushrooms and jade nectar; consuming a single mouthful grants a lifespan of fifty thousand years. The star has five gates, each radiating four beams of light that silently illuminate nine hundred million miles. Above it stands the Five-Colored Jade Tower, where the Perfected of the Dipper’s Handle resides, known as the Middle Prime Palace Five-Colored Jade Tower Northern Supreme Morning Lord. His surname is Yuying, his taboo name Xuan Shangpin, and his style Changyang Wenjimingguang. He wears a Mysterious Essence Jade Crown, robes of dark feathered flight, and holds a five-colored feathered tally in his hands, seated within the Jade Tower. There exists a register of esoteric names, the Vermilion Terrace; one must know the Northern Supreme Lord’s inner taboo name. Those who know it will see the Northern Supreme inwardly illumine and the Yin Essence descend in darkness. Cultivating this Way, one may soar through the Great Void and ascend into the Five Gates.

To practice the Way of Flying Steps, first stand upon the Yin Essence Star. Point the left hand toward your life-destiny star, press the right hand to the heart, hold the breath for five cycles, click the teeth five times, swallow saliva five times, and with eyes closed, visualize the Northern Supreme Morning Lord’s taboo name, style, and form. Remaining upon the Yin Essence Star, softly intone the incantation:

*"Mysterious Morning of the Northern Spirit, quintessence of the Five Qi,
Your form conceals the Six Records, your heart stores the Radiant Star.
Sun and moon flank and illumine, the Three Lights adorn your form.
Today is supremely auspicious, stepping the Nets of the Purple Court.
Above, the Heavenly Gates open, receiving the fortune of the Vermilion Spirit.
Endless blessings and honor, exalted rank and glory,
Ten thousand wishes fulfilled, all directions propitious.
Soaring beneath the Flowery Canopy, roaming the Jade Clarity,
Ascending to the Northern Morning, the Nine Perfected align in procession."*

When finished, turn left upon the Yin Essence Star five times, then stand facing your life-destiny star. Hold the breath for three cycles, step with the left foot onto the Assistant Star, advance the right foot to join it, and release the breath. Do not tread upon the Perfected Person Star—step only upon the Assistant Star.

The Perfected Person Star is Heaven’s Minister of Works, governing divine immortals. Above, it presides over the lofty perfected of the Nine Heavens; in the middle, it supervises the numinous immortals of the Five Peaks; below, it leads those who study the Way and the lineage of true immortals—none are beyond its jurisdiction. The star spans seven hundred and seventy miles, its expanse also lapis lazuli and crystal. Within it stand jade trees bearing yellow fruit, where golden-winged ravens roost. Spontaneously growing there are yellow essence jade mushrooms; consuming a single mouthful grants a lifespan of thirty million years. The star has twelve gates, each radiating four beams of light that brilliantly illuminate nine hundred million miles. Above it stands the Yellow Terrace Jade Tower, where the Perfected resides, known as the True Prime Palace Central Yellow Terrace Jade Tower Lord of the Radiant Dawn. His surname is Guixi, his taboo name Miaoyinguang, and his style Tongdu Yuandu Ningzhi. He wears a Flying Morning Treasure Crown, robes of azure feathered flight, and holds the Azure Register of the Dipper in his hands, seated within the Jade Tower. There exists a register of esoteric names, the Square Cauldron; one must know the Radiant Dawn Lord’s inner taboo name. Those who know it will see the Radiant Dawn inwardly illumine and the Perfected descend in darkness.

To cultivate this Dao is to soar through the Great Void and ascend into the Twelve Registers. In practicing the Dao of Flying Steps, one must not tread upon the star of the Perfected; instead, stand with feet together upon the Adjuvant Star—this is what is called "reclining beneath the Flowering Canopy."

The Northern Elder Perfected Lord said: If you wish to ascend bodily, do not offend the Perfected; if you wish to fly, do not transgress the Celestial Net; if you seek immortality, you must pay homage to the Radiant Dawn. When performing the Dao, avoid the Perfected’s star and stand upon the Adjuvant Star, bow to the Perfected, and pay court to the Radiant Dawn to seek flight through the void.

The Adjuvant Star is called "Void," and the Auxiliary Star is called "Constant." "Constant" is the eternal yang; "Void" is concealment. It bears a taboo name that must not be spoken aloud. It may only be transmitted beneath the Radiant Dawn through the Rite of the Sheep and Crow, pledging upon torn silk. Should one obtain this secret taboo and hold it in the heart while practicing, to leak it lightly would bring the Wind Blade of Punishment upon one’s seven generations of ancestors.

Standing upon the Adjuvant Star, place the right hand over the heart, point the left hand toward the northwest, hold the breath for nine cycles, click the teeth nine times, swallow saliva nine times, and with eyes closed, visualize the Radiant Dawn Lord’s surname, taboo name, and form. Remain standing upon the Perfected’s star and softly recite the incantation:

*"Great Subtlety connects to the True,
Adjuvant aids the Radiant Dawn.
Exhaling the radiance of ninefold essence,
Gathering qi into purple mist,
Flying auroras stream and reflect,
Illuminating the Ten Heavens.
Above, it governs the Primal Balance;
Below, it embraces the divine immortals.
Today, in flying steps,
I pay homage to the Perfected.
First, I seek void-travel;
Second, I beg for concealment of form;
Third, I wish to ascend to the Northern Portal;
Fourth, I desire the Dragon Robe and azure sash,
Broidered mantle and green skirt,
To ride the Eight Effulgences,
Roam the Nine Mysteries,
Enter the celestial lodgings,
And share the Emperor’s chariot."*

When finished, circle the Adjuvant Star seven times to the left, face the Perfected, hold the breath for three cycles, step with the left foot upon the Mysterious Darkness, advance the right foot to join it, and release the breath.

The Mysterious Darkness Star is the Celestial Vanguard, master of punishing rebellion. Above, it commands the ghostly spirits of the Nine Heavens; in the middle, it oversees the Three Offices of the Northern Emperor; below, it surveils the myriad multitudes, punishing rebellion and disobedience. All who harbor malevolent intent are subject to its jurisdiction. The star spans eight hundred miles, its substance like lapis lazuli and crystal. Within it grows a jade tree bearing crimson fruit, where golden-winged birds alight. Spontaneously arising cinnabar mushrooms and flowing jade-essence grant a lifespan of eighty million years upon consuming a single mouthful. The star has three gates, each radiating four beams of light that glow fiercely for nine hundred million miles. Above it stands the Vermilion Terrace Jade Tower, where the Perfected of the Dipper emerges—known as the Vermilion Terrace Jade Tower Dark Prime Flying Canopy Radiant Dawn Lord of the Central Secluded Palace. His surname is Dark Pivot, his taboo name Fixed Proclamation of Awareness, and his style Dharma Brightness Spreading the Celestial Pillar. He wears a Three-Flowered Treasure Dawn Crown, robes of cinnabar brocade flight, and holds the Life-Spirit Staff in his hands, seated within the Jade Tower. Should there be a register of esoteric names, the Jade Tablet, one must know the Flying Canopy Lord’s inner taboo name. Those who know it will see the Flying Canopy inwardly illumine and the Mysterious Darkness descend in darkness. To cultivate this Dao is to soar through the Great Void and ascend into the Three Gates.

When practicing the Dao of Flying Steps, first stand upon the Mysterious Darkness Star, place the right hand over the heart, point the left hand toward the heavens, hold the breath for nine cycles, click the teeth three times, swallow saliva three times, and with eyes closed, visualize the Flying Canopy Lord’s surname, taboo name, and form. Remain standing upon the Mysterious Darkness Star and softly recite the incantation:

*"Celestial Perfected walk the Dao,
Treading upon luminous traces to conceal form.
The Seven Origins gleam and scatter;
The Nine Dawns unite as one.
Hand grasping the Celestial Balance,
Feet treading the Flying Star,
Left, the Fire Marshal assists;
Right, the Vermilion Soldiers command.
Might shakes the Ten Heavens,
Radiance streams into the Highest Clarity.
First, slay the schemers;
Then, punish the demonic essences.
Whoever dares oppose the upright
Shall be severed by the Blade Punishment.
All subject to the Three Principles
Must submit and obey.
Transforming and traversing,
Proceeding to the Flowering Court as the heart desires,
Riding the void in flying steps,
Ascending to the Emperor’s numinous presence."*

When finished, circle three times to the left, face the heavens, hold the breath for three cycles, step with the left foot upon the Cinnabar Prime Star, advance the right foot to join it, and release the breath.

The Cinnabar Prime Star is the Dipper Sovereign of Heaven, master of the Registers of Destiny. Above, it governs the celestial records of the Nine Heavens; in the middle, it oversees the departments of ghosts and spirits; below, it presides over the destiny registers of those who study the True. All in the heavens and upon the earth are subject to its governance. The star spans seven hundred and twenty miles, its substance like lapis lazuli and crystal. Within it grows a crimson tree bearing white fruit, where golden-winged birds alight. Spontaneously arising golden essence and refined elixir grant a lifespan of seventy thousand years upon consuming a single mouthful. The star has seven gates, each radiating four beams of light that glow fiercely for nine hundred million miles. Above it stands the Plain Terrace Golden Tower, where the Perfected of the Treading Cycle resides—known as the Plain Terrace Golden Tower Treading Cycle Perfected of the Principle-Spirit Palace, the Golden Chief of the Seven Dawns. His surname is Supreme Opening, his taboo name Dark Illumination of Light, and his style Vermilion Radiance of Primordial Transformation and Five Paths. He wears a Seven-Treasure Flying Heaven Crown, robes of white brocade flight, and holds the Azure Prime Register in his hands, seated within the Golden Tower. Should there be a register of esoteric names, the Kun Terrace, one must know the Seven Dawns Lord’s inner taboo name. Those who know it will see the Seven Dawns inwardly illumine and the Cinnabar Prime descend in darkness. To cultivate this Dao is to soar through the Great Void and ascend into the Seven Gates.

When practicing the Dao of Flying Steps, first stand upon the Cinnabar Prime Star, place the right hand over the heart, point the left hand toward the Celestial Pass, hold the breath for seven cycles, click the teeth three times, swallow saliva three times, and with eyes closed, visualize the Seven Dawns Lord’s surname, taboo name, and form. Remain standing upon the Cinnabar Prime Star and softly recite the invocation:

*"Flying steps tread the cycle,
Ascending the Cinnabar Prime.
Riding the Chief and falling lodgings,
Summoning the Dipper’s soul,
Erasing death and commanding life,
Separating the azure and white tallies.
The Three Harmonies complete the Dao,
Extending years and destiny,
Enjoying blessings and long life,
Equal to the Radiant Dawn’s bloom.
Flesh flies, bones grow light,
Riding luminous traces and mounting clouds.
Immortal robes and feathered garments,
Tinkling pendants in profusion,
Five colors gleaming and resplendent,
Ascending into the Seven Gates."*

When finished, circle the star seven times, return to face the Celestial Pass, hold the breath for seven cycles, step with the left foot upon the Northern Culmen, advance the right foot to join it, and release the breath.

The Northern Culmen Star is the Grand Standard of Heaven, governing ascent and advancement. Above, it oversees the Perfected of the Nine Heavens; at the center, it commands the Flying Immortals of the Five Peaks; below, it presides over the bodies of scholars. All meritorious efforts and attainments of the Dao, the turning of the wheel and the stages of ascent, are wholly encompassed therein. The star spans seven hundred and seventy *li*, its substance like lapis lazuli and crystal. At its heart stands a black tree with white fruit, where the Golden-Winged One roosts. There grow spontaneously dark mushrooms and water-jade; consuming a single mouthful grants a lifespan of fifty thousand years.

The star has eight gates, each with four rays of light that illumine nine hundred million *li*. Above stands the Dark Terrace and Jade Tower, where the Master of the Step-Net resides, known as the Lord of Flying Radiance of the Dark Terrace and Jade Tower within the Palace of Cyclic Brightness. His surname is Bright Numinous, his personal name is Long Bright Transformation, and his courtesy name is Profound Origin, Origin Prospering, Upper Prime.

He wears a crown of Flying Essence and Radiance, robes of purple brocade with flying skirts, and holds in hand the Nine Dipper Jade Tablet, seated within the Jade Tower. If one possesses a mystic name on the Golden Terrace, one must know the inner name of the Lord of Flying Radiance. Those who know it shall see the Lord of Flying Radiance descend in illumination, the Dark Mystery of the Northern Culmen alighting, and by cultivating this Dao, one may soar through the Great Void and ascend within the Eight Gates.

To practice the Dao of Flying Steps, first stand upon the Northern Culmen Star. With the right hand, press the heart; with the left, point to the Golden Gate. Hold the breath for eight cycles, knock the teeth three times, swallow saliva three times, close the eyes, and visualize the name, personal name, and form of the Lord of Flying Radiance. Knock the teeth, stand upon the Northern Culmen, and softly intone the incantation:

*"The heavens move in threes and fives,
The Middle Prime revolves.
Flying steps beneath the radiant canopy,
Riding the Dipper and mounting the dawn,
Falling into the cycle of three destinies,
Wandering amidst drifting mists.
Today is supremely auspicious,
Ascending to seek the Divine Immortals.
Names inscribed on jade tablets,
Characters engraved in purple script.
Azure skirts and feathered robes,
Crimson sashes and brocade skirts.
The Eight Radiance Cinnabar Chariot
Conveys me to ascend the hall.
Attaining the rank of Immortal Minister,
Lord of the Northern Ascent.
All that is invoked,
Shall be as spoken."*

When finished, circle the star eight times, return to face the west, hold the breath for eight cycles, step with the left foot upon the Celestial Pass, advance the right foot to join it, and release the breath.

The Celestial Pass Star is the Supreme Emperor of Heaven, governing the mechanisms of Heaven and Earth, such as the nurturing of the four seasons, the alternation of Heaven and Earth’s fortune and adversity, and the convergence of kalpas—all are subject to it. The star spans nine hundred *li*, its substance like lapis lazuli and crystal. At its heart stands the Three-Flowered Tree with five-colored fruit, where the Golden-Winged One roosts. There grows spontaneously the Nine-Flavored Mushroom Paste; consuming a single mouthful, the body emits nine-colored light, and one gains a lifespan of ninety thousand years.

The star has one gate, with nine rays of light that govern the qi of the Nine Heavens, illumining nine hundred million *li*. Above stands the Nine-Layered Jade Tower, where the Dragon-Riding Perfected resides, known as the Lord of the Ninefold Cloud Canopy of the Northern Dawn within the Nine-Layered Jade Tower of the Opening Assembly Palace. His surname is Dark Pivot, his personal name is Turning Light, and his courtesy name is Meeting Prime, End Bright, Heavenly Disciple.

He wears a Nine Prime Treasure Crown, robes of nine-colored brocade, and holds in hand the Radiant Spirit’s Seal, seated within the Jade Tower. If one possesses a mystic name on the Jade Register of the Nine Heavens’ Imperial Diagram, one must know the inner name of the Lord of the Northern Canopy. Those who know it shall see the Lord of the Northern Canopy descend in illumination, the Dark Mystery of the Celestial Pass alighting. By cultivating this Dao, one may soar through the Great Void and ascend within the One Gate.

To practice the Dao of Flying Steps, stand upon the Celestial Pass Star. With the left hand, press the heart; with the right, point to the Earthly Door. Hold the breath for one cycle, knock the teeth three times, swallow saliva three times, close the eyes, and visualize the name, personal name, and form of the Lord of the Northern Canopy. Stand upon the Celestial Pass Star and intone the incantation:

*"The Primordial Heaven turns the Pass,
The Earth’s cycle revolves the Pivot.
Nine Numinous cross the degrees,
Threes and fives mutually advance.
The Four Sevens’ banners and lodgings,
The Five Emperors wander.
Receiving the Dark and stepping into the Void,
Ascending to tread the Jade Mechanism.
Clothed in the Dipper, shod in the Dipper,
Flowing pendants radiate majesty.
Those who follow me prosper,
Those who oppose me decline.
I traverse the Heavenly Perfected,
Ten thousand *li* open vast.
The body soars upon the azure disk,
The soul ascends, the form takes flight.
Transcending the kalpa’s convergence,
Ascending into the Supreme Subtlety."*

When finished, circle the star once, return to face the Earthly Door, hold the breath for one cycle, step with the left foot upon the Auxiliary Star, advance the right foot to join it, and release the breath.

The Auxiliary Star is the star of the Heavenly Venerable Jade Emperor, called the Constant. The Constant is the Constant Yang, governing the Flying Immortals. Above, it oversees the Nine Heavens; below, it commands the Nine Earths. The offices of the Divine Immortals of the Five Peaks and Four Marshes all derive from it. The star spans nine hundred and ninety *li*, its substance like lapis lazuli and crystal. At its heart stands the Azure-Flowered Tree, upon which naturally appear characters of nine sounds. Above is the Azure Crow, the Three-Legged Crow, where grows spontaneously lapis lazuli mushroom-jade. Consuming a single mouthful, one attains the same Perfection as the Jade Emperor.

The star has eight gates, through which the eight qi communicate. Each gate has four rays of light that illumine the Nine Heavens. Within stands the Purple Qi Jade Tower, where the Wandering Perfected of the Three Destinies resides, known as the Lord of the Nine Dawns of the Imperial Seat within the Purple Qi Jade Tower of the Palace of the Imperial Mat. His surname is Essence Constant, his personal name is Constant Without Flaw, and his courtesy name is Dark Unraveling, Void Correct, Upper Opening, Prolonging.

He wears a Flying Essence Jade Crown, robes of nine colors, and holds in hand the Fire Pendants, seated within the Jade Tower. If one possesses a mystic name of the Upper Clarity and knows the inner name of the Imperial Venerable, those who know it shall see the Imperial Venerable descend in illumination, the Dark Mystery of the Auxiliary Star alighting. By cultivating this Dao, one may soar through the Great Void and ascend within the Eight Gates.

To practice the Dao of Flying Steps, stand upon the Auxiliary Star. With the right hand, press the heart; with the left, point to the Sparkling Deluder Star. Hold the breath for three cycles, knock the teeth three times, swallow saliva three times, close the eyes, and visualize the name, personal name, and form of the Imperial Venerable. Stand upon the Auxiliary Star and softly intone the incantation:

*"Heaven and Earth interweave,
Three destinies connect the numinous.
Ascending to tread the celestial lodgings,
Soaring through the Nine Stars.
In the left hand, the Hidden Script;
In the right, the Feathered Canon.
Bowing to pay homage to the Imperial Venerable,
Receiving the Emperor’s name.
Attaining to traverse the Radiant Canopy,
Soaring in the Purple Court.
Today, practicing the Dao,
Ten thousand blessings converge.
Receiving boundless fortune,
Forever enjoying long life.
The body transforms into feathers,
Ascending to the Upper Clarity."*

When finished, circle the star three times, then face south again. Hold the breath for three cycles, turn the left foot to tread upon the Auxiliary Star, advance the right foot to join it, and release the breath.

The Auxiliary Star is the true star of the Supreme Thearch, called "Void." Void means ever-hidden and empty, governing boundless transformations. The star spans nine hundred and ninety leagues, formed of lapis lazuli and crystal, with a Three-Florescence Tree growing at its center. Upon it, the Jade Chapters of the Nine Heavens naturally manifest. Atop the tree perches a golden-beaked phoenix, holding a fire-bell in its mouth, from which the radiance of the Seven Luminaries naturally arises. To consume a single breath from it is to attain the same true essence as the Supreme Thearch.

The star has nine gates, interlocking with the Nine Heavens. Each gate emits four rays of light, blazing beyond the Eight Extremes into the endless center. Within stands the Jade Terrace and Purple Palace, where the Three Yang Perfected wander—styled the Supreme Venerable of the Jade Tower and Purple Sash, the True Primordial Dawn Lord of the Imperial Palace. His surname is Dark Void, his personal name Void-Prior-Nothingness, his courtesy name Hidden Primordial Awareness, Radiant Obscure Yang, Boundless Seclusion.

He wears a Flying Heaven Jade Crown, robes of Nine Heavens Dragon Silk, and holds the Imperial Script in hand, seated within the Purple Palace. If one possesses the Mystic Name of the Nine Heavens and knows the inner personal name of the Imperial True One, one may conceal form and hide the body. Practicing this Way, one may ascend within the Nine Gates.

To perform the Flying Steps, stand upon the Auxiliary Star, right hand over the heart, left hand pointing to the Northern Asterism. Hold the breath for five cycles, knock the teeth three times, swallow saliva seven times, close the eyes, and visualize the name, personal name, and form of the True Primordial Dawn Lord. Stand facing backward upon the Auxiliary Star and softly intone the incantation:

*"The Dao harmonizes with the Three Subtleties,
The Mysterious Void uplifts the true.
Exiting the constant, entering the empty,
Escaping form at Heaven’s Pass.
Floating through the Eight Extremes,
Riding the purple mist’s radiance.
Flying steps traverse the Nine Heavens,
Transforming into myriad thousands.
Roaming beneath the Northern Canopy,
Whistling to summon the Sentient Array.
All sought, all wished,
None unfulfilled as spoken.
Longevity matching Heaven and Earth,
Preserving the years of the Florid Dawn."*

When finished, circle the star five times, then face the Northern Asterism. Hold the breath for seven cycles, turn the left foot twice, and stand again upon the Yang Brightness Star. From the Yang Brightness Star, perform the single-step Yu Pace, circling the Nine Stars nine times in nine returns. No further visualization or incantation is needed.

When done, return to the Auxiliary Star and sit upright, reclining beneath the Florid Canopy. Visualize the Nine Dawns’ robes covering you as in the initial method. Close the eyes and imagine your body within crimson clouds, riding the Celestial Net through the void, ascending to the gates of the Nine Heavens. Follow the Net’s revolutions nine times, then sense the body as if falling through empty space, returning to sit upon the star chart. Wipe the eyes nine times with the hands, pinch the two eye-gates nine times, and perform the Great Incantation of the Celestial Cycle. Knock the teeth nine times, then face northwest and intone:

*"Supreme Nine Numinous Ones,
August Florid Sovereign,
Together gazing upon the celestial lodgings,
Revolving the Three Luminaries’ degrees.
Transforming the four seasons,
The Five Agents attain immortality.
Today, practicing the true,
Universally commanding the myriad spirits.
The Five Peaks and Four Floods,
And all numinous mountains,
The officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water,
All guard my chariot.
The sun’s flashing lightning,
The Six Yin’s exhaling clouds,
Fierce beasts driven away,
The myriad spirits scattering in four directions.
Poisonous dragons devour ghosts,
Leveling and extinguishing evil’s source.
Those who plot against me are punished,
Those who offend me are vexed.
Those who delight in me gain longevity,
Those who wish for me attain immortality.
I bear the Numinous Tally,
My body wears the Seven Origins.
Flowing gold and fire-bells
Adorn my body.
Head crowned with the Florid Canopy,
Feet treading radiant clouds.
Mouth holding celestial essence,
Hands grasping Heaven’s Pass.
Void and constant transform,
A thousand unions, ten thousand divisions.
Metal, Wood, Water, Fire,
Instantly become spontaneous.
Flying with the Yu Pace,
Wandering the Nine Gates.
Exiting and entering the Three Clarities,
Heaven and Earth endure forever."*

When finished, knock the teeth three more times and swallow saliva fourteen times. The Way of the Nine Dawns concludes here.

To practice the Way of the Nine Dawns, one must observe the following schedule: during the first, seventh, fourth, and tenth months—the four *meng* months—use the fifth and ninth days of the first decade, exclusively on the first day at dawn. In the second, eighth, fifth, and eleventh months—the four *zhong* months—use the fifteenth and nineteenth days of the middle decade at noon. In the third, ninth, sixth, and twelfth months—the four *ji* months—use the twenty-fifth and twenty-ninth days of the last decade at midnight. Thus, six days are selected from each month, one from each decade, practiced three times monthly, totaling thirty-six times yearly, corresponding to the celestial rotation of the Heavenly Pass and the three hundred sixty degrees of the nine heavens’ qi.

On these appointed days, inscribe the names of the nine heavens while practicing the Way, thereby transcending the *yang* cycle of nine hundred and six kalpas. The body avoids the calamities of the great deluge and the vast kalpic disasters. After nine years, one ascends the net of serene flight, strides upon the void’s纪, and soars beyond the mortal realm.

The *Mysterious Chart of the Nine Dawns* on the golden tablets states: To cultivate the flying steps of the Nine Dawns, one must also adhere to the days of *Stepping the Heavenly Net*, practicing both in tandem to hasten celestial ascent, as the *Mysterious Dipper* repeatedly bears witness. Those who undertake both practices should first perform the Nine Dawns, then proceed to *Stepping the Heavenly Net*. Though these two methods differ in incantations, they originate from the same source.

*Stepping the Heavenly Net* was once transmitted by the Lord Emperor of the Grand Tenuity to the Perfected Sovereign of the Luminous Cavern. *Stepping the Heavenly Net*, flying the earth’s纪, grasping the *Mysterious Dipper*, climbing the stellar *Kui*, connecting with the Nine Perfected, riding the flying dragon, wandering the Three Destinies, floating through the Three Lives, securing the Three Treasures, emerging from the Six Harms, concealing within the Six Yin, entering the Six纪, pacifying *Tianying*, guarding the extended term, preserving the Primordial Auxiliary, treading the Great Assistant, employing the *Flowing Cinnabar Chamber*, ascending to *Wenchang*, revolving through the Nine Paths, and attaining the rank of the Nine Elders. After twenty years of practice, one receives the scriptures and becomes a Perfected of the Highest Clarity.

Ordinary people perceive the Seven Stars as near, unaware that stepping them is profoundly distant. If a Daoist knows the Heavenly Net may be stepped yet fails to ensure the hun and po follow the body, it is not that the body cannot lead the hun and po, but rather that the hun and po fear the might of the Seven Stars and dare not ascend with the body. Thus, the three hun remain uncontrolled, the seven po scatter, and one merely steps the Net with an empty corpse while the spirits do not follow—truly a futile labor.

If you wish to step the Net, purify the heart and still the mind, banish sorrow and care, and relinquish all distracting thoughts. Then, circumambulate three times, ascend the stars, and invoke the spirits, ensuring the hun and po deities together pass the Numinous Pass. Suddenly, the body becomes unbound, and one forgets oneself entirely. With utmost purity, proceed as if treading empty space. After one year, one repels misfortune; after two, one repels weapons; after three, one repels death; after four, one becomes an earthbound immortal. A thousand harms and ten thousand evils—none dare encroach. From this point onward, blessings and fortune arise without end. One commands spirits and employs numinous powers, harnessing flying dragons, receiving the *Taiyi*’s sacred fungus, and being attended by jade lads from the Jade Emperor. After thirty-four years of practice, one becomes a Perfected of the Highest Clarity.

In stepping the Net, do not traverse horizontally across the Net, for the Net is the straight line connecting the boundaries of the stars. To cross the Heavenly Net horizontally is to sever the celestial path—a grave prohibition. Furthermore, do not tread upon the stars of the Perfected—this is a great taboo. Violating either of these requires removing the headscarf, bowing, and making amends to the Net’s image. Prepare a cloth nine feet long and six feet wide, arranging the stellar positions upon it. Use blue ink for the stars and red ink for the Net, storing it in a pure box. Each time before practice, burn incense, retrieve the cloth, and be attended by seven jade maidens to guard the scriptures and seven jade lads to protect the stars. Women stepping the Net should use crimson cloth.

The Lord Emperor of the Grand Tenuity, in transmitting the scripture of *Stepping the Heavenly Net*, strictly followed the methods of the divine Perfected. First, burn incense at the practice site, hold the breath seven times, and circumambulate the Dipper’s stars three times outside, beginning at *Yin Jing* and ending at *Yang Ming*. Only then may one exhale and begin treading the Seven Stars, stepping onto *Yang Ming* with the body. Face *Yang Ming* and hold the breath while silently invoking:

*"Great *Yang Ming*, august *Wenchang* of the mysterious extreme, may my hun and po together wander the Heavenly Net."*

After the invocation, step onto *Yang Ming* with the left foot, then advance the right foot to *Yin Jing*, silently invoking:

*"North Pole of *Yin Jing*, supreme *Xuanji*, may my hun and po together pass the divine ford."*

Next, step onto the North Pole with the left foot, silently invoking:

*"Celestial radiance of the North Pole, revolving to the mysterious celestial time, may my hun and po together reach the Mysterious Pass."*

Then, step onto *Tian Guan* with the right foot, advance the left foot to align with it, and exhale. If the great invocation is not completed before holding the breath, one may exhale above the *Dan Yuan* star and hold the breath again, softly invoking:

*"Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth—
the Five Phases revolve.
The Seven Stars shine resplendently,
the Heavenly Net most mighty.
The Auxiliary Star pacifies abundance,
the Assistant Star repels decline.
The Nine Perfected and the Supreme,
*Taiyi* and *Taiwei*,
the Three Treasuries and Jade Emperor,
the Three Honored Ones repel misfortune.
Heaven turns, Earth revolves,
hun and po follow.
May I become a flying immortal,
true radiance lingering.
My name enters the Golden Chamber,
the Jade Gate opens.
Riding the dragon, ascending the void,
sun and moon shine together.
Wandering the Highest Clarity,
jingling bells and emerald robes.
Left foot treading lightning,
right hand commanding thunder.
Ten thousand evils on earth,
subdued and slain, dare not pursue.
Evil hearts gazing upon me,
be shattered and destroyed.
The Jade Emperor commands jade maidens,
to attend and return with me.
Hun, po, spirit, and soul,
unite in form and ascend in flight."*

For the reverse stepping method, halt at *Tian Guan*, face the North Pole, and softly invoke:

*"Supreme Primordial Time,
Florid Canopy and Purple Numinous,
Jade Chamber of the North Pole,
concealing radiance and transforming essence.
Mysterious Terrace of *Taiwei*,
Jade City of the Nine Perfected,
may I, a flying immortal,
wander the cloud courts.
Reversing the steps of the Heavenly Net,
hun and po both live.
Riding the dragon to the Florid Palace,
attaining the flower of the Way.
Left side bearing jade chimes,
right waist girded with golden bells.
Tiger belt and dragon skirt,
whistling to command celestial soldiers.
Riding the threefold purity,
ascending to the Highest Clarity."*

Upon completing the invocation, hold the breath, lift the left foot to tread upon the North Pole, and the right foot upon *Danyuan*. Next, raise the left foot to tread upon *Xuanming*, then bring the right foot parallel with the left, facing the star of the Perfected One, and regulate the breath. Softly invoke:

*"Supreme Ultimate of the Nine Essences,
High Perfected of the Supreme Sovereign,
emerging to ascend Primordial Clarity,
entering to conceal in Profound Yin.
Nurture me, [name], to love the immortal path.
The Jade Terrace suddenly opens,
the Golden Hall’s eight gates appear.
Grant me the scripture to wear,
crimson dragon and azure skirt,
to assist the Purple Tenuity,
sage ruler of later generations.
Riding ten flying dragons,
dark canopy and radiant numina,
inscribed upon the Profound Chart,
sun and moon conjoined as one."*

After the invocation, hold the breath again, tread the left foot upon the *Bixing* star, advance the right foot to *Yinjing*, then advance the left foot to *Yangming*. Bring the right foot parallel with the left, regulate the breath, and softly invoke:

*"Celestial Pivot of Upright Yang,
the Dipper’s revolving rise and fall.
Advancing, turn the Primordial Mechanism;
retreating, move the Numinous Net.
Subdue the *po* to bring tranquility,
restrain the *hun* to ensure well-being.
Hun, po, and body together
ascend to the Heavenly Hall.
Facing the Golden Gates,
the Highest Supreme Sovereign,
right hand supporting the Immortal Mother,
left hand supporting the Immortal Father.
Purple kingfishers and flying blossoms,
dragon robes and tiger skirts.
Girded with the true scarf and jade,
a halo crowning the head.
Holding divine bells in hand,
golden chimes at the waist.
Chanting the *Dongzhen* scriptures,
the sevenfold wondrous verses.
From the Void and Primordial,
born to be a king,
soaring through the nine paths,
grasping the Dipper and climbing the Net.
Preceded by the Great One,
followed by the Profound Youth,
transmit to me the oral instructions,
sitting in dissolution, standing in vanishing.
The essentials of reverse stepping,
a position as Immortal Minister.
The five viscera self-generated,
welcoming the heavens in harmony.
May wishes as conceived be fulfilled,
may all sought be prosperous.
All malign forces submit and harm,
concealed in distant lands.
Those who hate me—heaven strikes them,
water extinguishes, fire perishes."*

For the reverse stepping method, hold the breath again, circle three times outside the Dipper’s stars, beginning at *Yangming* and ending at *Yangming*. Regulate the breath and invoke:

*"Highest Supreme Perfected,
Seven Luminaries most revered,
reverse stepping to seek life,
ascending to the Heavenly Origin.
May I, a flying immortal,
enter the Purple Gate."*

Then hold the breath once more, tread the left foot upon *Yangming*, the right foot upon *Yinjing*, advance the right foot to *Xuanming*, the left foot to *Danyuan*, then the right foot to the North Pole, the left foot to *Tianguan*. Bring the right foot parallel with the left, regulate the breath, and invoke:

*"Sevenfold reversal and rotation,
ascending the Jade Constellations.
Six Eras assist me,
Three Nets align my steps.
The Jade Emperor glances left,
the Highest Supreme looks right,
teaching me to ride the stars,
soaring to ascend the Profound Path.
Grant the boon of flying immortality,
the blessing of undying destiny.
Roaming the Highest Clarity,
riding the flowery Threefold Purity.
Golden, azure, and kingfisher skirts,
entering and exiting the Nine Abodes.
The Northern Sovereign bows in greeting,
the Southern Perfected offers thanks.
Name inscribed on the Immortal Terrace,
a thousand transformations, myriad changes.
Gaining the friendship of sage lords,
assisting in the Great Peace.
May all wishes follow the heart,
all affairs come to fruition.
Those who harbor malice toward me—
blade punishment, fire entombment."*

Having completed the forward, reverse, and counter-stepping methods of the three paths, lift both feet together upon the *Yangming* star. With the right hand, press the heart; with the left hand, point to the *Xuanming* star. Hold the breath for three cycles, knock the teeth twenty-one times, and swallow saliva twenty-seven times. This is called *Grasping the Dipper*.

Softly invoke:

*"Yangming of the Great Simplicity,
establishing the celestial mansion of the Yellow Chamber.
Within resides a great spirit,
left holding the Supreme Sovereign,
right grasping the High Perfected.
Dragons bearing kingfisher robes,
flying brocade with tiger patterns.
Girded with jade talismans,
crowned with lotus coronets.
Emerging from nothingness, entering the Void,
golden perfection and jade radiance.
Numinous and majestic,
named Yangming.
Treading upon crimson mists,
chanting the *Dongzhang* scriptures.
Grant me the hidden writings,
teach me the steps of the Net.
Contending in threefold circuits,
grasping the Dipper, self-forgetting.
May I, a flying immortal,
transcend the Void and traverse emptiness.
Name inscribed in the Highest Clarity,
riding the dark dragon’s chariot.
Wherever intention leads,
may all desires follow.
The Three Honored Ones unite in harmony,
hun and po inwardly communicate.
Summoning divine officials,
jade maidens and jade lads.
Those who harbor malice toward me—
punished by lightning and wind,
treacherous schemes—tongues severed,
banished to the ten directions."*

Upon completing the invocation, suddenly forget the self within the heart, and after a long while, descend.

The method of *Grasping the Dipper* complete, tread both feet upon the *Yinjing* star. With the left hand, press the heart; with the right hand, point to the star of the Perfected One. Hold the breath for three cycles, knock the teeth three times, and swallow saliva three times. This is called *Climbing the Pivot*.

Entering the *Taiwei* Palace, softly invoke:

*"Within the Profound Simplicity of Yinjing,
the Flowery Gate of the Central Palace arises.
Within resides the Jade Emperor,
the North Pole most majestic.
Phoenix-embroidered collar,
dragon-kingfisher azure skirts.
Tiger-girded with bells,
supporting the vermilion mushroom coronet.
Named Yinjing,
Sovereign of the Supreme.
Grant me the scripture of myriad years,
to step the Primordial Unity,
climb the Pivot and ascend,
roaming the Numinous Pass.
Externally restraining the seven *sa*,
internally governing the three *hun*.
Refining the *po* from worldly burdens,
treasuring the *hun* as the womb spirit.
Hun and po guard the body,
together ascending as immortals,
soaring to the Highest Clarity,
returning with the countenance of an infant.
All intentions fulfilled,
ten thousand desires without difficulty.
Those who harbor malice toward me—
their forms perish, their palaces crumble.
Commanding the Six Heavens,
employing the host of spirits."*

The method of *Climbing the Pivot* complete, tread both feet upon the *Bixing* star. With feet together, face the star of the Perfected One and bow four times. Kneel, hold the breath for four cycles, knock the teeth four times, and swallow saliva four times. This is called *Meeting the Perfected*.

Kneeling, softly invoke:

*"Supreme Ultimate of the Nine Essences,
Luminous Perfected of the Upper Origin.
Holding the balance of the Upright Mechanism,
exhaling and inhaling purple mists.
Golden light and jade radiance,
majesty illuminating the ten heavens.
Governing and guiding the Three Luminaries,
harmonizing yang and balancing yin.
Ordering the origin and bestowing qi,
transforming the old to renew.
Above, governing the Central Constellation,
mystery within the Mysterious Pass.
Golden chambers and jade portals,
the Northern Flank’s convenience.
Emerging to ride the Eight Radiances,
floating and roaming the Great Origin.
Dragon brocade and phoenix robes,
tiger-kingfisher flying skirts.
Crimson banners and green sashes,
purple feathers with sevenfold edges.
Girded with divine talismans,
crowned with supporting coronets.
Above, perching in the Nine Voids,
below, soaring in the Heavenly Abyss.
Self-styled Jade Sovereign,
Ultimate Perfected of the Nine Heavens.
Pitying my love of the Dao,
grant me the hidden scriptures.
Personally ascending the Pivot and Pillar,
paying homage to the Numinous Lord.
Beseeching the cinnabar writings,
the cause of life’s affinity.
Governing the heavens’ Three and Five,
soaring through the Eight Profound.
The five viscera self-generated,
highest grade of flying immortals.
Gaining the wings of the Jade Emperor,
minister to later sages.
Rank of Grand Master,
riding clouds and flying verification.
May all wishes be fulfilled,
all malign forces kept at bay.
Those who harbor malice toward me—
their forms shattered, gates destroyed."*

Having completed the Way of Connecting with the Perfected, one then steps with both feet onto the Star of Profound Darkness. With the right hand placed upon the heart and the left hand pointing to the Star of Cinnabar Prime, hold the breath for three cycles, knock the teeth three times seven, and swallow saliva thrice—this is called "Treading the Dipper."

A whispered invocation follows:
"Radiance of the Grotto-Heaven,
boundless in the Profound Darkness,
qi fills the Great Void,
coming and going without form.
Hidden in heaven, concealed in earth,
pervading and irrigating the unborn,
suddenly ascending the Brazen Sky,
stepping above the Purple Court.
Gazing north to the Thunder Chamber,
gazing south to the Lightning City,
dazzling and confounding the myriad transformations,
no longer in their former shape.
In the flickering flow of light,
touching the hand, they instantly form.
Should you seek to conceal yourself,
know my name.
Empty and primal, haughty and aloof,
ninefold transformations of the Profound Darkness.
Sitting and rising with the Six Jia,
visiting and registering with the Six Ding.
Grant me the hidden scriptures,
to tread the Dipper and traverse the stars.
Looking up, I behold the Supreme Sovereign,
robed in cinnabar and azure,
holding the numinous radiance in hand,
jade bells girded at the waist.
Above, I beseech flight as an immortal,
to be born together with heaven.
My name inscribed in the Grand Tenuity,
floating and transforming in the Highest Clarity.
Below, I beseech transformation,
to conceal my light and record my form.
May all affairs be as wished,
all past grievances smoothed.
Those who harbor malice toward me—
slain by divine soldiers."

The *Golden Root Scripture of the Supreme Ultimate* states:
"When you ascend the Profound Darkness and tread the Dipper to conceal your form,
should you desire transformation,
you must know my name.
Revolving heaven and moving earth,
the myriad things instantly take shape."

When treading the Profound Darkness or desiring concealment, one must hold this name in the heart.

Having completed the Way of Treading the Dipper, one then steps with both feet onto the Star of Cinnabar Prime. With the left hand placed upon the heart and the right hand pointing to the North Star, hold the breath for three cycles, knock the teeth thrice, and swallow saliva thrice—this is called "Treading the Guideline."

A whispered invocation follows:
"Supreme Nine Terraces,
Cinnabar Prime and the Mysterious Guideline,
externally governing the North Star,
internally rectifying the heavenly principle.
Golden Gates shine without,
Jade Court radiates within.
At its center dwells the Most Honored,
styled the Crimson Child,
governing within Cinnabar Prime,
in the Crimson Chamber.
Embroidered clouds of kingfisher hue,
dragon robes and tiger skirts.
In the right hand, the Imperial Register;
in the left, the Handle of the Dipper.
Feet treading upon radiant clouds,
head crowned with purple coronets.
To the right, hanging bells;
to the left, jade pendants.
Grant me the hidden scriptures,
to tread the Guideline and wander.
Above, I beseech flight as an immortal,
riding the dark dragon.
My name inscribed in the Cinnabar Terrace,
in the Jade Hall of the Supreme Ultimate.
Wherever I turn, wherever I seek,
blessings and fortune come to meet me.
Those who harbor malice toward me—
may they be annihilated.
Attended by divine officials,
jade maidens and jade lads."

Having completed the Way of Treading the Guideline, one then steps with both feet onto the North Star. With the right hand placed upon the heart and the left hand pointing to the Celestial Pivot Star, hold the breath for three cycles, knock the teeth thrice, and swallow saliva thrice—this is called "Treading the Net."

A whispered invocation follows:
"Mysterious and supreme Grand Tenuity,
Purple Canopy of the North Star.
Below dwells the Supreme Perfected,
soaring beyond the Nine Exteriors.
Kingfisher skirts in flight,
golden bells and azure sashes.
At the waist, a jade radiance,
dark clouds swirling and gathering.
Grant me the hidden scriptures,
to ascend and traverse the Seven Qi.
Ascending the Clarity to sport in the mist,
the Perfected gather in assembly.
I beseech flight as an immortal,
my name inscribed in the Cinnabar Chamber.
Wherever I turn, may my wishes be fulfilled,
without calamity or harm.
Those who harbor malice toward me—
may they suffer defeat and injury."

Having completed the Way of Treading the Net, one then steps with both feet onto the Celestial Pivot Star. With the right hand placed upon the heart and the left hand pointing to the Celestial Pivot, hold the breath for three cycles, knock the teeth thrice, and swallow saliva thrice—this is called "Riding the Dragon."

A whispered invocation follows:
"Supreme Seven Poles,
Purple Tenuity beyond the stars.
Precious Mystery and Golden Chamber,
without, the Jade Gate.
Revolving through the Nine Palaces,
harmonizing the Celestial Pivot.
At its center dwells the Honored Divinity,
styled the Purple Sovereign.
Grant me the hidden scriptures,
to carry me and ride the dragon.
Above, soaring through the Nine Heavens;
below, flying through the Primal Earth.
Radiant clouds and cinnabar chariots,
dark flowers and kingfisher skirts.
At the waist, a dragon tally;
on the head, tiger-patterned kerchiefs.
Encompassing the birth of the myriad things,
instructing and guiding the flying immortals.
Freeing me from the name of death,
eternally preserved in heaven and earth.
Riding the dragon and treading the Dipper,
wherever I turn, I receive favor.
Those who harbor malice toward me—
wind blades and fire consume them."

Having completed the Way of Riding the Dragon, one then steps with both feet onto the Auxiliary Star, holds the breath for one cycle, knocks the teeth thrice, and swallows saliva once—this is called "Wandering the Three Destinies," revolving and treading the Celestial Flower.

A whispered invocation follows:
"Star of the Supreme Ultimate’s Auxiliary,
its essence residing in the Purple Barrier.
Nurturing life and fostering destiny,
preciously guarding the spirit-soul.
The Golden Chamber opens again,
to behold the Lord of the Auxiliary.
Grant me the hidden scriptures,
to make me wander and revolve.
My name listed with the Sage Sovereign,
flying immortal of the Nine Heavens.
Kerchief of gold and girdle of the Perfected,
entering and exiting the Grotto-Gate."

Having completed Wandering the Three Destinies, one then returns to tread upon the Star of Assistance, stepping with both feet, holding the breath for one cycle, knocking the teeth thrice, and swallowing saliva once—this is called "Pacing the Three Yangs," entering and exiting the Three Lives.

A whispered invocation follows:
"Mud-Pill Palace of the Great Void,
Celestial Honored One of the Purple Palace.
Mysterious Void and True Pivot,
foremost of the Emperor.
In the Dao, the Jade Sovereign;
in the body, the Mud-Pill.
Riding the swift and sudden arising,
qi piercing the Primal Empyrean.
Essence entering the Hall of Light,
strengthening the embryo and benefiting the soul.
The Vermilion Mountain opens again,
to draw near the Numinous Prime.
To the left, gathering the radiance of the sun;
to the right, plucking the root of the moon.
Flowing fire ten thousand fathoms,
golden net and azure skirts.
At the waist, the Celestial Bone;
on the head, the Floral Crown.
Grant me the hidden scriptures,
to traverse the Celestial Pivot.
I beseech flight as an immortal,
to command the myriad spirits.
Wherever I turn, all converges,
fortune and virtue like mountains."

When performing these practices, one faces north, holding the hidden scriptures, and acts accordingly. One may also follow the text while observing the stars, without reciting from memory.

"In spring, stepping the Seven Stars is called 'Treading the Three Principles';
in summer, stepping the Seven Stars is called 'Following the Six Records';
in autumn, stepping the Seven Stars is called 'Walking the Six Harms';
in winter, stepping the Seven Stars is called 'Ascending the Six Terminations.'
