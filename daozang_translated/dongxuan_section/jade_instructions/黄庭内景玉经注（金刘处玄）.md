**Yellow Court Inner Vision Jade Classic Commentary**
*Attributed to the Immortal Liu Changsheng*

**First Chapter: Upper Clarity (Shang Qing)**

Before the Purple Clouds of the Upper Clarity,
Above the Nine Heavens, a scene unlike any other—
Above, the Three Pure Ones; within, the Jade Emperor.
The Most High Dao’s Jade Dawn Lord,
Ascending beyond measure, entering sainthood,
A body beyond the body, where seas turn to mulberry fields,
His jade visage ever renewed.

In leisure, he crafts elixir pearls in seven-character verses—
Rich within the elixir pearl, gold flies from the elbow,
Palace gates reversed, beyond the world, his pure chanting.
Dispersing and transforming the Five Forms, manifesting myriad deities—
*Jia-Yi-Geng-Xin, Bing-Ding-Ren-Gui*—
A thousand transformations, divine powers manifest,
The Five Forms gathering in assembly.

This is the *Yellow Court Inner Vision’s* daily scripture.

The Yellow Court’s Inner Vision gathers all the immortals,
Penetrating the wondrous sea of laws, chanting ten thousand verses.
The heart-strings plucked thrice, the dancing embryo-immortal—
The heart’s lute played within, its melody piercing the Azure Expanse,
The embryo-immortal dances forth, its radiance resplendent and clear.

The Nine Qi shine brightly, emerging from the Celestial Gate—
The Nine Yangs return and circulate, the Seven Reversals harmonize the spirit,
Night-brightness manifests, startling gods and spirits.

The Divine Boy is born beneath a crimson canopy,
Purple mist and crimson light weave into a flowery canopy,
Divine powers drift like illusions, yet the form remains unbroken.
This is the *Jade Scripture*, worthy of profound study.

When all scriptures are exhausted and the Jade Precepts mastered,
The natural Dao’s virtue and true power are realized.
To chant ten thousand times is to ascend to the Three Heavens—
From the Void emerges chanting, the pivot of ten thousand transformations,
Drawing the deluded across the Ten Directions and Three Realms.

A thousand calamities dissolve, a hundred ailments heal—
A single thought without birth, all defilements vanish,
Nature penetrates the boundless, attaining the Void.
Unafraid of tigers and wolves’ ferocity—
Meeting the Sage without ghosts or spirits, embracing the Dao and forgetting form,
Tigers and wolves retreat, beasts grow long-lived.
Thus, old age is repelled, and life is eternally prolonged.
Though the outer form ages and has an end,
Longevity knows no bounds.

**Second Chapter: The Upper Realm**

Above, the soul’s spirit at the Lower Elbow;
The Earth Lock is sealed, the Heavenly Gate ever open,
The soul is pure, the qi exhilarated, the spiritual embryo formed.
To the left, the Minor Yang; to the right, the Major Yin—
Gazing left at the *Jia*-Dragon, right at the *Geng*-Tiger,
Their copulation comes and goes, naturally attaining true delight.
Behind, the Secret Door; before, the Birth Gate—
Behind, gold is hidden; before, jade is concealed,
From the Void emerges the One, wondrously harmonizing the Six.
Breathing in with the sun, exhaling with the moon.

Yang descends, Yin ascends—
Fire emerges, water enters,
Reversed and inverted, first attaining the other.
Where the Original Qi converges, the starry hosts are divided—
Heaven and Earth unite, their wondrous use harmonizing,
Heaven’s clarity shines, ten thousand phenomena manifest.
Purple mist ascends and descends, the Three Subtle Clouds.

Observing the auspicious clouds, the purple mist covers the crown—
A realm beyond saints.
Irrigating the Five Flowers to plant the spiritual root—
Jade dew nourishes jade sprouts, silently gathering white snow,
The toad lacks no moon.
The Seven Liquids flow through the Cavernous Gate—
The Black Tortoise’s golden grain, the Vermilion Bird’s jade nectar,
Offered to the Heavenly Sovereign.
Returning to the Purple, embracing the Yellow, entering the Elixir Field—
Purple mist curls, wondrous wisdom greets it, the spirit refreshed.
The Inner Chamber’s light shines upon the Yang Gate.
To illuminate the divine chamber, within revealing the Yang Gate,
The Western Bundle gathers, beyond the world’s Heaven and Earth.

**Third Chapter: The Mouth**

The mouth is the Jade Pool, the Grand Harmony Official—
The jade cup holds elixir, savoring its taste with refined delight,
Swallowed past the Nine Palaces, only then meeting the True Person.
Rinsing and swallowing the spirit’s essence, disasters cannot touch—
Frequent draughts of jade nectar, the Nine Nines intertwine,
Emerging in rainbow hues, beyond Heaven and Earth’s embrace.
The body generates light and fragrance like orchids—
The spirit’s platform opens wide, the treasure pearl gleams,
Seeking lead and mercury, attaining sagehood.
Dispelling a hundred evils, the jade glaze brightens the face—
In stillness and non-action, the heart like frost and snow,
Round and radiant in the sky, square and luminous below.
If one can truly cultivate, they ascend to Broad Cold—
On Kunlun’s peak, only the pure cold remains,
A single pearl of light, the Dao’s radiance.
Day and night without sleep, one attains true transformation—
Yin exhausted, Yang pure, no slumber, no dreams,
The body like empty space, lead and mercury perfected.
Thunder roars, lightning flashes, the spirit merges—
A single clap of thunder, Heaven and Earth harmonize,
The ultimate spirit manifests, beyond all things.

**Fourth Chapter: The Yellow Court**

Within the Yellow Court, the Inner Person wears brocade robes,
The Central Child in scarlet, his body adorned with six *qian* weights,
Accompanied by wind and moon, neighboring the Void.
Purple flowers fly among the clouds, the qi enfolds—
The Heavenly Book’s purple edict arrives,
Summoning the infant with tender grace,
The Great Net gathers the saints, swiftly binding the clouded waist.
Crimson and verdant, green vines with spirit branches—
Lotus blossoms wrapped in chrysanthemums, wind swaying golden threads,
Within the treasure vase, another branch emerges.
Seven jade locks close the twin gates—
Within the Seven Star Official, the golden doors are always sealed,
On the treasure flower platform, no form or bearing remains.
Double doors and golden locks conceal the pivot—
Nine layers of mysterious gates, jade locks and golden bolts,
Wondrously penetrating ten thousand transformations,
Within, the Three Elixirs are formed.

The Mysterious Spring’s high cavernous gate—
On the Three Peaks’ summit, ten thousand streams gush forth,
The immortal’s treasure abode, strange scenes linked.
Within the Three Fields, the subtle essence is refined—
The steady bow and wooden ox plow through the Three Fields,
Timely nourishment flows, jade herbs sprout with spirit.
A graceful maiden hides beneath the celestial glow—
The Moon Maiden embraces the sun, the flying crow wraps in light,
Their radiance dazzling, forming the Original Beginning.
The Double Hall shines with the Eight Auspicious—
Moonlight on the tower, the Double Hall’s nature as a torch,
Within and without, all is illuminated, the Eight Immortals enjoy blessings.
The Heavenly Court and Earthly Locks display fresh axes—
Embracing the One, a mighty weapon,
Repelling outer demons, the protective deities strike,
The wise axe ever cleaves.
The Spirit Platform’s firm foundation never decays—
The Vermilion Official’s child presents the divine pearl,
Light generates ten thousand rays, dazzling the void.

Within the Central Pool, the spirit wears crimson pearls,

Within the Central Pool, the spirit wears crimson pearls,
The Pool of Radiance is clear and boundless—
Above it soars the flying crow,
Not divine yet divine, its feathers strung like linked pearls.

A crimson brocade cloud-garment bears the tiger talisman,
Fivefold wondrous silks refined to six *qian* weight,
Before the rock it rides the tiger, dispatches demons with flying talismans.

The Crosscurrent Basin, three *cun* deep, houses the sacred essence—
It drains the West River dry, threefold flames of crimson,
Revealing the true spirit, the boundless void of Heaven.

Grinding open the treasure-mirror, white lotuses rise from water,
Their fragrance pure, their leaves fresh and green.

Huayue, the Golden Peak, its divine marvels.
The pathways of passage are ever open—

Brought into China, boundless blessings for the immortals.

The divine brow bears the华盖 (*huàgài*) covering the bright pearl—
Auspicious mists arise, transforming into a treasure-canopy,
Rolling forth divine pearls, the inner sea of law revealed.

The Nine Abysses: sun and moon pierce the void, no trace remains,
Within the Nine Yang Officials, birds and rabbits intermingle their light,
The divine mechanism shifts endlessly—
Heaven and Earth cannot measure its depths.

In this abode dwells the True Constant, clad in crimson,
Eight domains as neighbors, the True Constant’s nature in the void,
Shedding cloud-garments, its radiance blazes forth.
Those who discern it suffer no ill fate.

Crimson mists shine bright—
All maladies vanish, its nature like autumn’s moon,
Its form as boundless as the void.

The crimson pearl’s sacred cluster gathers radiant emotions—
Pearl-light erupts, flames like flying stars,
Ever nourishing mushrooms and grasses, flowers and jade taking shape.

Beneath the tongue lies the *Xuānyīng* (*xuānyīng*), the shore of life and death.

On the tower, immortal robes—
Merits soar, the body adorned, transformed through many forms,
To refine the infant and the aged.

The two *qi*—clearing and entering—radiant in harmony,
Auspicious brilliance without sentiment,
Gold flies, jade scatters, inverted yet clear,
Form and spirit immortal, never decaying.

If one encounters it, they ascend to the Celestial River.

Encounter it naturally—
The jade-nature shines resplendent,
Then ride the crimson phoenix,
Floating beyond the clouds.

The *Ju Ling* truly strange,
Heroically shaking the eight directions,
The jade standard alone trembles,
Meeting blades, light intermingles.

The dragon flag spans the sky, hurling fire bells.
Winds scatter the dragon flag,
Yin demons in tumult,
Yang slays the Yin,
True Hero without end.

It governs all *qi* forces, commanding the Tiger Army,
Divine wisdom and might,
Embracing *One* with firm integrity,
Sword-wielding resplendent,
With strong soldiers following.

Externally responding—eyes of a youth, nose like a pillar,
Heaven’s eye descending light,
Void-luminous jade pillar,
Refining mercury into form,
The utmost spirit encountered.

Hair and brain mutually supporting, both fresh,
The upper *Yang Gate* opens,
Mystically communicating with the jade brain,
Seven orifices bright,
A single thread of light.

Nine-hued brocade robes, green-hued skirts,
Body adorned with six *qian*,
Central sash of silk,
Then riding *Luan-Feng*,
Clouds beyond, paying homage to the True.

Wearing gold belts with jade dragon-tiger patterns,
Jade pendants chime,
Dignified in step,
Formless true visage,
Riding dragons, straddling tigers.

Able to preserve威 and glory, ascending the Auspicious Cloud,
Embracing the Way, forgetting dust,
True nature surpassing all,
Desiring to pay homage to the Golden Gate,
Steadily driving the Auspicious Cloud.

Commanding ten thousand spirits to pay homage to the Three Elements.
Heaven’s Element descends blessings,
Mid-Element pardons sins,
Earth’s Element resolves calamity,
Ten thousand spirits assemble in homage.

**Spleen Chapter Fifteen**
The Spleen, one *chi* long, concealing the *Tai Cang*,
The Five Phases’ Spleen Ancestor,
The earth’s granary, China’s central realm,
One—Emperor of the sovereign.

Within, Laozi governs the Hall of Clarity,
The Central Realm’s sacred teaching,
Cultivating the True in the age,
The primal symbol—
The enlightened Laozi.

Its character: *Ling Yuan*, named *Hun Kang*,
Silent, embracing the Way,
Six-three harmonized,
Virtue returns to the utmost,
The greatest strength named.

It governs a hundred diseases, dissolving the root of grains,
Divine medicine cures,
Delusions of a hundred evils,
Stealing food to satiate hunger,
Coarse cloth barely covering.

Yellow robes, purple sashes, dragon-tiger talismans,
Golden uncle, jade crown,
Yellow matron, purple sash,
Treasure hall’s sacred visage,
Ten thousand spirits bow in homage.

Nourishing essence and prolonging life relies on the sovereign.
Northern Sea’s flying gold,
Southern Mountain’s carved jade,
The Vermilion Emperor’s clarity,
Boundless sacred blessings.

Three invocations of my name—spirits respond,
Scattering yin demons,
Summoning yang spirits,
Spiritual efficacy tenfold,
Then called the Golden True.

The Three Elders seated together, each with companions,
The Three Elders, each with companions,
Left: scripture, right: martial,
Beyond the Extreme in Heaven’s center,
*Luan* welcomes, *Feng* dances.

Some in essence, some in fetus, each holding their method,
Ten directions of clarity,
A single point of luminous spirit,
The fetal immortal nurtured,
Seizing true essence.

Peach-faced infants prolong the life-bloom.
Peach-cheeked infants,
Embracing the Way to prolong life,
Deep roots, firm stems,
Emitting light.

Male and female linger in the Nine—*Tao Kang*.
Daoist male and female,
Worldly scenes lingering,
Before the wind, beneath the moon,
Utmost nature, rare and subtle.

Dao Father and Dao Mother face each other.
Heaven as father,
Earth as mother,
The *Tai Xu* containing forms,
The sage’s subtle delight.

Master Father, Master Mother, in the *Dan-Xuan* realm.
The utmost sage as father,
The utmost Way as mother,
Luminous radiance as child,
Secrets as the path.

May be used in contemplation to ascend the void,
Contemplating the Way,
Eliminating thoughts, erasing the mundane,
Taking and gathering forgotten,
Naturally attaining true blessings.

Divergent paths converge at the ultimate end.
Things and symbols exhausted,
Quieting the mind to return to One,
Establishing virtue if stolen,
The sage’s work complete.

Closing the Three Passes, grasping firm and steady,
Pre-closing the Golden Pass,
Firmly guarding true essence,
*Qi* and spirit meeting,
Obtaining the round completion.

Swallowing gold nectar, consuming jade essence,
On the *Hui Xian Lou*,
Overflowing with golden elixir,
The fetal immortal dances drunk,
Turning back to the immortal realm.

Thus attaining no hunger, the three worms perish,
Jade nectar, golden meals,
Three swallows forget hunger,
Worm corpses scattered,
Nature radiant.

Mind and intent ever harmonious, leading to prosperity.
Mind communicates, intent resolves,
Spirit-*qi* surging and harmonious,
Inner true joy,
Dancing spirits, swaying.

The five mountains’ clouds—*Peng* and *Heng*,
The five mountains’ true forms,
Central *Yu Jing*,
Golden light ten thousand paths,
Purple mists a thousand layers.

Preserving and irrigating the jade hall as recompense,
Heaven descends jade nectar,
Filling the jade vessels,
Drawn to rebirth,
Eight immortals drink together.

The five forms complete and firm, no calamity.

**Upper Vision Chapter Sixteen**
The Upper Vision—three lights like linked pearls,
The Upper Vision, central *Ben Yuan*,
Jade flowers fragrant,
Forming the golden lotus.

Falling light illuminates the nine corners,
Heavenly flowers drifting,
Light pervading *Qian-Kun*,
Void-luminous Yang,
Piercing Kunlun.

Five spirits’ night torches illuminate the eight regions.
Ascending mists, myriad symbols,
The Great Pole contending in light,
Ancient and modern sages,
Ranked in the eight directions.

The child stores the Inner Emperor to play with me,
The child can see the mother,
The Way harmonizes with the true,
The fetal spirit nurtured,
Inner visage ever renewed.

Body clad in phoenix robes, holding tiger talismans,

**Nature’s Essence Chapter Seventeen**
Nature’s Essence **glows with golden clarity**,
Body adorned with clothing and talismans,
Demons and fiends invade the realm,
Heaven sends down tiger talismans.

One moment passes, soon ascending to the void of nothingness.
The heart forgets, the mind vanishes,
I am originally **Great Non-being**,
Divine elixir refined,
Dwelling with the sages.

Within the square inch, deep thoughts are hidden,
Naturally **the true Dao/Way** emerges,
Wondrous insight deeply concealed,
Night-luminous light radiant,
Square inch **pure and crystalline**.

Neither square nor round—**the window of perception is closed**,
Ears hear no false sounds,
Mouth speaks no idle words,
Nose perceives no fragrance,
The Dharma-eye gazes upon Heaven.

Above the nine heavens,
**Non-being, non-dying**.

Verdant branches **stretch ten thousand feet** to shelter and support,
Jade branches **hang with fragrance**,
**Wafting through the heart’s depths**,
Drying the Northern Sea,
**The jade tree bears no shade**.

The three souls **rest in tranquil harmony**, as commanded by the Yellow Emperor.

The soul **faces the Vermilion Emperor**,
Treasure-light like a mirror,
**Governance and peace for the realm**,
The sage’s edicts **strong and commanding**.

**Spiritual Platform Chapter Eighteen**
The Spiritual Platform—**dense with essence and qi**,

Water and fire **harmonized**.

Within the Nine Mysteries, **profound and yin-laden**,
Nine lights **subtle and wondrous**,
Dao/Way-qi **deep and hidden**,
Qi-spirit **pure and refreshing**,
Water **nurtures gold**.

The mouth is the **Heavenly Gate**, the **spiritual mechanism**,
The mouth **as the tongue of clarity**,
The heart **as wisdom’s seat**,
**Supreme mystery beyond speech**,
Revering truth, **free from falsehood**.

The feet are the **Earthly Gate**, the **lifespan’s foundation**,
Golden lotus **supports each step**,
Revealing the **divine infant**,
Penglai **within arm’s reach**,
**Internal rites paid to the luminous teacher**.

The hands are the **Human Gate**, **grasping prosperity and decline**,
Hands **upholding the cosmos**,
Wondrous **duality of existence**,

Who would envy mortal inquiries?

**If Obtained Chapter Nineteen**
If one obtains the Three Palaces **and stores the Primordial Elixir**,
Ascending and descending **without leaving the Three Palaces**,
One **celestial elixir grain**,
Swallowed—**spiritual powers attained**.

The Great Unity **flows as a pearl**, resting in Kunlun,
Divine light **erupts**,
Ten thousand **Primordial Pearls**,
**One point of harmony**,
Body **congruent with the Great Void**.

Twelve **layers of towering palaces**,
Twelve **lofty halls**,
Above **connecting with clouds and mists**,
Luan **welcomes, phoenix blows**,
**Gathering of divine immortals**.

High or low, all are **true immortals**.
True immortals **disgusted with the world**,
**Cloud-walking to the Primordial Source**,
Earth **left for the high heavens**,
Eighty thousand, four thousand.

**Jade Halls and Vermilion Roofs**—all are **Primordial Palaces**,
Great Luo **sages**, each in their **guest abode**,
Phoenix **pavilions, dragon offices**,
Auspicious light **enveloping the mists**.

**Celestial spheres and jade weights** gleam—**the teeth are celestial**,
**Plucking stars from the tower**,
**Exchanging jade at the gate**,
Wisdom **observing the Eight Poles**,
Daily **attending a thousand altars**.

Gazing upon the **boy-child seated in contemplation**,
**Extramundane spirit-child**,
Sitting **in majestic might**,
**Full quiver, arrows drawn**,
Ninefold **iron drums**.

Who is this child **dwelling in my body**?
**Dao-illuminated child**,
**Attaining eternal perfection**,
Sages and immortals **as companions**,
Wind and moon **as neighbors**.

Where does this person **go to enter the Nihuan**?

With me—**Yang-soul**.

The **Three True Ones** support the **Buxu** **at the Palace’s threshold**,
**Non-doing true nature**,
**Manifested false form**,
**Balancing true and false**,
**Together drinking fragrant elixir**.

Five lights **blaze with radiance**—this is the **Seven Mysteries**,
Five **luminous mists**,
Light **piercing the Seven Mysteries**,
Naturally **sage-like and wondrous**,
**Nurturing the fetal immortal**.

**Chapter on Breathing (呼吸章)**

The sun and moon race across the six directions—
Birds fly, hares flee,
Turning the cycles of Heaven and Earth.
Yin and yang inverted,
Serpents devour the fine hairs.
The Vermilion Emperor’s domain—Heaven’s center, Earth’s threshold—
The **Great One** of the Immortals,
**Central Rank**, the **Celestial Emperor**,
The **Sage of True Enlightenment**,
Gathered at **Penglai** in one assembly.
My face holds all souls and spirits intact.

My **soul** penetrates the **Yao-Ming**,
My **spirit** reaches the **Void-Nothingness**.
In the **Non-Doing** clarity shines—
A scripture of the **Worthy and Sage**.

Breathing **Dao/Way**’s **original qi** to seek immortality,
Nurturing the **fetal spirit**—
Not the external breathing of the mundane.
With **wondrous skill**, draw and add,
**Luminous mists** enter and exit.
The **Immortal Officials** and their **heirs** may already come before me—
**True Enlightenment** vast and distant,
Like the **Xingdi** of old.
**No form, no decay**—
They are called **Divine Immortals**.

**Vermilion Birds** expel and contract **White Jade Elixir**,
**Celestial Birds** dance in the streets,
**Jade Springs** surge like flying fountains.
At the **Pine Peaks’** edge,
I chant and laugh, forgetting speech.

**Condensing essence, nourishing the womb, transforming into body**,
**Qi harmonized, spirit steadied**,
**Nature suspended, essence secured**.
The **Seven Treasures** are born,
And the **Great Luo** returns.
If I **preserve the fetus** and **stop the essence**, I may achieve **long life**.

**Faint and hazy**, I guard the fetus,
**Pure spirit**, I preserve the essence.
**Harmonizing and intermingling**,
**Refining qi** into form.
The **Three Qi** wander the **Nine Passages**—
**Heaven’s one qi**, in its use, **immovable**.
**Transcending the Three Realms**,
**Repaying the Four Graces** in secret.
The **One** contains **Hua**—
**Great One**, **enlightened and wondrous**,
**Sphere Elixir** holds the light.
**Spirit** communicates through **strange transformations**,
A thousand **monsters** hide within.
Gazing afar, my **one heart** like the **Luo Star**,
**Void-hearted wisdom**, clear within and without,
**Returning light** radiant and bright—
The moon ascends with three stars.

Beneath the **Golden Chamber**, nothing can be toppled—
**Sea-Hidden Dragon Officials**,
**Embrace the male, hold the female**.
The **Sage of True Enlightenment**,
All **paths** return to him.
Extend my life to **white-haired** rebirth as a child.

Born with **white hair**, my inner form **never decays**.
In the **Non-Doing**, clarity shines—
The **most wondrous** of all.

**Chapter on Jade Chamber (琼室章)**

Within the **Jade Chamber**, the **Eight Substances** gather**,
The **Three Mountains’** halls,
Where the **Eight Immortals** assemble.
Crossing the seas, riding the winds,
Each displays **wondrous transformations**.
The **Lady of the Nihuan** stands at the center—
**Auspicious light** in myriad paths,
**Wisdom-eyes** constantly observing.
**Central Rank’s** bride,
**True joy** within her **inner nature**.

The **Long Valley** and **Mysterious Domain** encircle the **outer suburbs**,
**Spirit** guards the **bold**,
A **Dao/Way**’s **immortal homeland**.
Unleashing **soul-luster**, responding to all things without hindrance,
The **Six Dragons** scatter and fly, hard to distinguish.
**Dragons coil** around the **Kan Palace**,
**Tigers prowl** the **Yin Officials’** halls.
**Jia and Geng** exchange positions—
**Dao/Way** reveals, **spirit** communicates.

**Long life** is most carefully guarded in the **inner chamber**—
**True Precepts** of all things,
**Non-doing** in all things—
**Buxu**’s **soul-symbols**,
**Hares flee, birds fly**.
Why die, making the **spirit weep**?
The **Great Vehicle** of **Sage-Teaching**,
**Broadly liberating** all beings.
If I **abandon Dao/Way’s** command,
I will **forever fall** into **Yao-Ming’s** depths.
Suddenly, the **land of calamity**—
**Three souls** perish.
**Grants** turn to **harms**,
**Nature sinks** into the **land of calamity**.
**Three souls** hard to preserve,
**Seven po** vanish.
Only **drawing in qi** and **recording the child-essence**,
**Qi returns** to the **Original Sea**,
**Secretly guarding** the **true essence**.
**Void-Nothingness**, faint and hazy,
**Transcending the world**—**spirit** communicates.

An **inch-field** and **foot-residence** suffice to **treat life**,
**Ascending** to the **Eight Directions**,
**Central Rank’s** **inch-field**,
**Night-bright** luster radiant—
**Heaven** is vast, **Earth** is narrow.
If I **decide to empty the sea** and **pour it out**,
**Great Sea** humble and **void**,
A hundred **pourings** return to it.
Within the **Three Heavens**, there is **Original Beginning**—
**No shadow**—the **soul-child**,
Always **plucking and breaking**.
**Essence lost, fluids leaked**—
This is **not my true form**.

Within the **Kan Palace**, **refine mercury**,
Within the **Li Palace**, **cook lead**,
**Dan** completed in **nine transformations**,
**Shed the shell** and **ascend as an immortal**.
**Seal and guard** the **essence-chamber**—
**Central Rank’s** sacred domain,
Always **closing the Golden Gate**.
The people **flourish**, the land **prosperous**—
**One** is the **Emperor’s** glory.
**Preserve my Nihuan’s** three **wondrous souls**,
Within the **Nihuan**, **guard my Three Palaces**.
**Mercury refined** into **truth**,
**Cloud-steps** to **Penglai**.
**Serene and tranquil**, **seal the vision**—
**True nature** serene,
**Kan Palace** tightly closed,
**Opening and revealing** in the **center**,
**Dawn-light** illuminating the body.

**No thingness**—
**Natural harmony**—**Yin and Yang** balanced.
**Tigers roar, dragons chant**,
**Slaying evil monsters**.
**Yin and Yang**—
**Square, round, crooked, straight**—
**Highest virtue** clear and **pure**.
**Central Rank’s** **Jia and Yi**—
Why question **Bing and Ding**?
**Reciting the Jade Scripture** into the **Upper Purity**.
**Dragon-scripture, Jade Scripture**—
**Spirit** performs in the **Upper Purity**.
**Venerate the True**, achieve **virtue/power**—
**Heavenly** merit and fame.
**Mind Chapter (念章)**

Constantly **mind** the **Three Palaces**—
**Connected Peaks’** halls,
**Inner hidden Cloud Palaces**,
**Gui and Ding** meet,
Within—**flaming coldness**.
**Perceiving** clearly, **no inner or outer**,
One **round pearl**,
Illuminating **inner and outer**,
**Piercing True Light**—
Forever **unbroken**.

**Preserving and rinsing** the **Five Sprouts**—
No **hunger or thirst**,
The **fetal immortal** bathes in **gold**,
**Rinsing with jade**—
Within, **no hunger or thirst**,
Always **drinking mist and clouds**.

**Spirit-luster** holds the **perfumed towel**—
**Six Yi** come to **pay homage**,
**Spirit** communicates through **hairs and threads**,
**Li’s** daughter presents the **towel**.
**Six Yi** come to **pay homage**,
**Merit** performed for the **Highest True**.

**Guard the essence-chamber**—
Do not **leak prematurely**,
**Embrace the Original**, **guard the Dao/Way**,
**Essence secured**, **spirit wondrous**—
**Non-Doing** generates **Being**,
**True form** appears.
**Seal and preserve**—
I may **long live**.
**Bones firm, marrow solid**,
**Essence exhausted, life gone**.
Most carefully **preserve the True**,
**Increase lifespan**, **lengthen years**.

**Rising from the body**—
**Cloudly Passages** connect with **Sages**,
**Questions** cross no boundaries,
**Heaven and Earth** united within—
**Great Spirit** in one **pinch**.
**Three Palaces** near—
**Easy to conceal and grasp**.
**Palace dusts** of all kinds,
**Spirit’s** wondrous **graspings**,
**Seven Luminaries** communicate with **spirit**,
**Non-Doing**—**greatly achieved**.

**Void-Nothingness**, **stillness**, **emptiness**—
**Substance** in the **Middle**,
**Great Dao/Way** is **not void**,
**Body** the same as **Great Emptiness**.
**Natural wondrousness**—
**Rolling out** the **bright pearl**.
**Make my form** as such—
Do not **defile it**.
My **body** like a **wild crane**,
My **nature** like a **leisurely cloud**,
**Azure Void** outside all things—
**Floating and soaring**, **trusting in True Nature**.

**Deeply probing all things**,
**Forgetting words to grasp intent**—
**Dao/Way’s eye** in **clear nature**,
**Wondrous use**—**Heaven’s** observation.

**Six Palaces** refined and kept as they should be,
**Six Palaces** in **harmony**,
**Law-Body** secure and **at ease**.

**Cosmic Elixir** refined—
**Gold and Mercury**, **Jade and Lead**,
**Soaring effortlessly** into **Heaven’s Path**.

Beyond **Azure Expanse**, **cloudless skies**—
**Luan and Feng** in **soaring flight**.
**True Dao/Way** attained, **Divine Immortal** revealed,
**Morning audience** with **Jade Emperor**.
