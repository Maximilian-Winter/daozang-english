### **Huangting Neijing Yujing Zhu (The Jade Classic of the Inner Yellow Court)**

The *Huangting Neijing Yujing* is also known as the *Taishang Qin Xin Wen* (太上琴心文)—*"qin"* meaning harmony. Reciting it harmonizes the Six Palaces (六府), calms the mind and spirit, and grants immortality.

It is also called the *Dadi Jin Shu* (大帝金书), the sacred scripture recited in the palace of the Great Emperor of Fuxiang (扶桑大帝君), inscribed on golden tablets—hence *"Jin Hui"* (金会).

It is also called the *Shuhua Yupan* (束华玉篇). Donghua (东华) refers to the palaces of the Eastern realm, where the Qingtongjun (青童君) of the Eastern Sea resides. The immortal maidens and sages there recite and practice it, inscribing it on jade—thus *"Yupan"* (玉篇).

One must observe strict purity for ninety days, reciting the text ten thousand times, to harmonize the Three Souls (三魂), refine the Seven Spirits (七魄), eliminate the Three Corpses (三尸), and balance the Six Palaces (六府). The Five Viscera (五藏) will flourish with vitality, the complexion will revert to youth, and no ailment or calamity shall harm the body. Upon completion, one will naturally perceive the spirits of ghosts and gods, internally observe the intestines and stomach, and behold the Five Viscera.

At this time, the Yellow Court True Person (黄庭真人) and the Jade Maiden of Shuhua (束华玉女) will appear to instruct the adept. This is the Way of Immortality. If you possess the marks of the Dao, you have obtained this sacred text.

This scripture maps the divine chambers of the body’s singular form—the abode of the embryonic spirit (胎神). Those who recite it constantly will illuminate the divine chambers, secure the embryonic spirit, circulate the celestial fluids (灵液), harmonize the hundred passages (百关), fill the blood and marrow, balance the intestines and stomach, and cause the Five Viscera to bloom with vitality. Hearing and sight will sharpen, gray hair will darken, and decayed teeth will regrow.

Thus, it repels the chaotic onset of illness, for one has mastered the six arrays of soul and essence (魂精六纬). With the body filled and the spirit at ease, death becomes unattainable—hence the name *Neijing Huangting* (内景黄庭).

The recipient must observe purity for nine days, seven days, or three days before receiving the text. The instructor is the teacher; the recipient must revere them.

「To form a pact and take an oath, one must pledge not to divulge it. In ancient times, oaths were sealed with a black cloud brocade of ninety *chi* in length, a golden tablet with phoenix script wrapped in a silk cloth of forty *chi*, and nine pairs of golden buttons—these replaced the solemn vow of cutting hair and drawing enemy blood without betrayal. Such materials were sacred fabrics from the divine realm (*shénxiāng*), not common goods of the mortal world (*chìxiàn*).

Now, the brocade may be substituted with white gauze (*báishāng*), the silk cloth with blue cloth (*qīngbù*), and the buttons with gold-plated ones (*jīnduàn*), which are still sufficient to bind the oath to the Nine Heavens and to admonish the Three Officials. All must revere the teacher who possesses the scripture; if the oath is broken, the Seven Ancestors will be summoned to the *Tānggǔ* River’s source for judgment, and one’s body will be tormented by the *Fēngdāo* (Wind Blade) as a ghost.

The *Tānggǔ* is the oral transmission of the Middle Mountain King. One who receives the scripture may pass it on to nine others. They must carefully examine the recipient’s *form* and *qi*—only those who are benevolent, loyal, and sincere, and who dwell in Dao/Way and embody truth (*zhuànxuán zhùzhēn*), may be taught without corrupting the true transmission. They should respect and delight in the Immortal Way. Only then may they be entrusted with it. If they lack such virtue, it is a risk of leakage; thus, selecting a worthy recipient is both prudent and difficult.

Moreover, one should first seek signs of resonance and verify the recipient’s purity and subtlety (*xūlíng*) before transmission. When the recipient is deemed worthy, the teacher may also reveal it through dreams, and the timing of the transmission will be intuitively understood.

The penalties for divulgence are severe; those who pass it on must be cautious indeed—how could one with the *Neijing Huangting* scripture not be vigilant?

The *Qīngxū Zhēnkǒu Mìjìng* (Oral Transmission of the Pure and Empty Immortal) states: The *Neijing Huangting* scripture is the golden text of the Great Emperor of the *Dàsāng* (Morning Sun), a secret teaching for refining the True Self (*liànzhēn*). Those who read the *Neijing Huangting Jing* should do so in a secluded chamber, burning incense and purifying their vessels (*jìngshèng*), before taking up the text. All who possess this scripture are protected from a hundred evils (*bǎi xié*).

If one enters mountains, forests, or shadowy places and feels shaken with dread, they should steady their mind, face north, and recite the *Neijing Jing* once. Their spirit will then quiet, and their intent will level—even as if journeying with a thousand others, the fear will cease. If one recites it ten thousand times (*wàn guò*), they will personally perceive the Five Viscera, intestines, and stomach, as well as all ghosts and spirits of the world, subject to their command.

For those afflicted with illness, if they hold the text in mind, even at the brink of death, they will be cured. Generally, one must avoid consuming the Six Livestock (*liùchù*), violent fish (*yúzào*), the Five Pungent herbs (*wǔxīn*), and acts of covering filth (*yǎnwū*). If one has stepped barefoot (*tuōlǚ*), they must bathe, rinse their mouth, burn incense on either side, and recite the scripture once—all maladies will then be dispelled.

The words of the Small Lord (*Xiǎojūn*) say: Before retiring at night, one should first recite the *Huangting Jing* once, then sleep. This allows the soul and spirit (*húnpò*) to self-regulate and refine, achieving three or four recitations (*guò*) being ideal.

The myriad teachings (*wànfǎ*) depend on humanity as their foundation, and humanity relies on the heart as its core. Without humanity, teachings cannot arise; without the heart, the body cannot stand. The heart’s teachings are many, and their application varies; they encompass both existence and nonexistence (*yǒuwú èr tǐ*), responding to circumstances and seizing opportunities.

Thus, there are distinctions between the mundane and the sage, shallow and profound, foolish and wise, true and false—none differ without the discernment of heart and spirit, nor without their proper application. Yet, all teachings of the world, though their paths vary, converge in their destination; all thoughts, though diverse, align in their purpose. From coarse to refined, from expedient to absolute, there are two stages; from falsehood to truth, from error to clarity, they ultimately harmonize in one vision.

Those who hold the *Neijing Huangting Jing* are the guardians of the sacred Dao/Way (*shùhuá*). It is indeed the essential secret for learning the Immortal Way and the foundation for achieving *yùhuà* (transformation into a feathered immortal). Though my practice is still incomplete, my contemplation is coarse, I have yet glimpsed the myriad subtle essences and modeled a singular form.

There are four doctrines (*sì zōng*), and seven key characters (*qìzì*) to grasp; they point to phenomena and elucidate meanings, speaking of both inner and outer realms (*nèiwài liǎng yán*). In the midst of sharp hearing and angry body, during moments of inhaling and exhaling through the throat, or when licking the brush and grinding ink, I will often leave behind the original divinations (*yuánshuài*).»

The Yellow is the color of the central realm. The *Tíng* is the center of the four directions. Externally, it points to affairs: the celestial center, the human center, and the terrestrial center. Internally, it points to affairs: the center of the brain, the center of the heart, and the center of the spleen. Hence, it is called *Huángtíng*.

The Inner is the heart. The *Jǐng* is the form. Externally, the form refers to the phenomena of the sun, moon, stars, clouds, and mists. Internally, the form refers to the phenomena of blood, flesh, sinews, bones, and the viscera. The heart resides within the body, preserving the unity of form and color in observation, hence it is called *Nèijǐng* (Inner Form).

**Chapter One of the Upper Clarity (Shàngqīng Zhāng)**

Before the *Zǐxué Xūhuáng* (Purple Vapor Emperor) of the Upper Clarity, within the realm of the *Sānqīng* (Three Clarities)—comprising *Yùqīng* (Jade Clarity), *Shàngqīng* (Upper Clarity), and *Tàiqīng* (Supreme Clarity)—this is where all the great sages dwell. According to the *Yùwéi Jīng* (Jade Canopy Scripture), the Upper Clarity is governed by the *Xūhuáng Dàdào Jūn* (Emperor of the Great Dao of the Purple Vapor), the domain of the Great Dao that encompasses the Three Clarities. He also presides over the daily rituals in the southwest direction, where the *Tàilíng Xūhuáng Tiānzūn* (Supreme Numinous Purple Vapor Celestial Venerable), known as the original title of *Yuánshǐ* (Primordial Beginning), resides.

The Dao Emperor wished to clarify the seven-word incantation (*qìzì*), thus beginning with the *Zǐxué guān* (Purple Vapor Office), also called the *Zǐqióng guān* (Purple Crystal Office) or the *Zǐchén guān* (Purple Dawn Office). The *Tàishàng Dàdào Yùchén Jūn* (Jade Dawn Lord of the Supreme Dao) is another title for the Supreme Venerable. According to the *Běnxíng Jīng* (Scripture of Original Conduct), this is also the title of the five senior lords of *Yuánshǐ* (Primordial Beginning). The Jade Dawn Lord is one of the titles for the *Huánglǎo* (Imperial Old One).

In leisure, the Dao Emperor resides within the *Yàozhū* (Pill Palace) and delivers the seven-word incantation. The *Bìyào Jīng* (Secret Essentials Scripture) states: Within the immortal court, there is the *Liáoyáng* (Luminous Yang) Hall, the *Yàozhū* (Pill Palace) Gate, and the Seven Reflections Chamber. The Dao Emperor dwells within and teaches the scripture. The human body possesses all these.

**Dispersing and Transforming Five Forms to Change Myriad Gods**
This refers to gathering the limbs, abandoning sharpness and clarity, departing from form and discarding wisdom, aligning with the Great Unity, and progressing from the original to the refined—hence, assuming the guise of gods to manifest their applications.

The gods are those that respond to sensation, thus their number is manifold—how could it be limited to myriad? This is the *Huángtíng Rìnèi Piān* (Yellow Court Inner Form Scripture), deriving its name from the central realm.

**Plucking the Heart in Three Layers, Dancing the Embryo to Achieve the Sage**
Plucking (*qín*) is harmony; layers (*dié*) are accumulation. Preserving the three *dāntián* (elixir fields), making them harmonize and accumulate as one, allows the embryo sage (*tāixiān*) to be attained.

The embryo sage (*tāixiān*) is the sage of embryonic breathing (*tāixī*), akin to the embryo in the womb having breath but no respiration.

**Nine Qi Manifesting and Illuminating, Emerging from the Celestial Questions**
Within the three elixir fields, there are nine radiant *qì* (vital energies). None are without illumination. The *Dàdòng Jīng* (Great Cavern Scripture) states: The three elixir fields, combined with the three *yuán* (primordial essences) and the three *dòngfáng* (cavern chambers), total nine offices (*guān*). Within these offices, the celestial sovereign’s nine *pò* (souls) transform into the nine *yángmò* (yang paths) and become the nine *qì* (vital energies), which further manifest as the nine gods (*shén*).

**The Godly Essence Appears as a Child, Generating Purple Mist**
Through observation and contemplation, the mind assumes the task, borrowing the eyes to perceive.

---

The following text speaks of the eyebrows as a *huágài* (flowery canopy) sheltering the bright pearl (the eyes).
The *huágài* is the **Godly Canopy**, referring to the eyebrows.
The **Bright Pearl** is the **Eye Child** (innocent eye).
The **Purple Mist** is the refined *qi* (vital essence) of the eyes.
This is where the **Jade Scriptures** may be meticulously studied.
The text begins with broad principles, yet focus yields mastery.
A thousand praises ascend to the Three Heavens,
When the essence is complete and the spirit full, one attains the **Three Pure Ones** (上三清).
A thousand calamities vanish, a hundred ailments heal—
When the spirit is perfected and the essence is whole, calamities and diseases dissolve naturally.
No fear of the ferocity of tigers and wolves,
For the **Primordial Essence** is unharmed and the years of age are repelled.
This entire chapter expounds the **Dao of the Yellow Court**.

**Chapter Two: The Upper Soul and Lower Guan**
Above is the **Upper Soul** (上魂), the celestial division.
Below is the **Lower Guan** (下关), the earthly division.
The **Soul and Spirit** (魂灵) cannot be shaped by human laws; they are formed by Heaven and Earth.
The **Left** is **Minor Yang** (少阳), the **Right** is **Major Yin** (太阴).
The **Left** is bound, the **Right** is extinguished.
The **Mao** (卯, 4–6 AM) generates, the **You** (酉, 4–6 PM) kills.

Behind is the **Secret Aperture** (密户), before is the **Life Gate** (生门).
The **Life Gate** faces south, the **Secret Aperture** faces north.
The **Secret Aperture** is the rear two orifices, speaking of concealment.
The **Life Gate** is the front seven orifices, speaking of their role in life.
Together, they form the **Nine Orifices** (九窍).

**Breathing with the Sun and Moon, Preserving the Essence**
The **Sun** and **Moon** are the essences of **Yin** and **Yang**.
**Left** is exhalation, **Right** is inhalation—
The body holds the *qi* of **Yin** and **Yang**.
Between breaths, the mind must be preserved.
The *Shàngqīng Zǐwén* (Upper Clarity Purple Text) says:
Preserve the mind with the **Sun** and **Moon**—
Whether sitting or standing, this is the way.
The **Primordial Qi** (元气) converges with the **Lunar Lodges** (列宿), dividing them.
The **Primordial Qi** is singular—
Uniting the mind with the **Dao/Way**.
Preserve the radiance of the **Sun**, **Moon**, stars, and constellations,
Illuminating and arranging them—
The body becomes distinct, merging with Heaven and Earth.

**Purple Mist Ascending and Descending: The Three Subtle Clouds**
The **Purple Mist** is the *qi* of the eyes.
Within the **Three Elixir Fields** (三丹田), above and below, white *qi* flows,
White *qi* circulating as one body.
Further, it is said:
The **Eye Light** has three colors—**Purple**, **Azure**, and **Black**—
These are the **Three Subtle Clouds** (三素云).
The **Daoist Scriptures** state:
The **Cloud Forest Lady**’s incantation:
*"Eye Child of the Three Clouds, True Lords of the Two Eyes!"*
Irrigate the **Five Palaces** (五华) to cultivate the **Spirit Root** (灵根).
The **Subtle Clouds’** *qi*, when stored in the throat, becomes **Jade Fluid** (玉液).
The **Five Palaces** are the refined essences of the five **Zang Organs** (五脏).
The **Spirit Root** is the **Life Root**, planted and growing.
The **Seven Fluids** (七液) flow through the orifices,
Circulating above and below—
The **Day of Surge** (冲日) flows upward, the **Day of Return** (回日) flows downward.
The **Lú** (庐, forehead) is within the **Bright Hall** (明堂).
The **Returning Purple Mist** embraces the **Yellow** and enters the **Elixir Fields**—
An inner symbol, as revealed.

The **Spleen’s** *qi* is **Yellow**, the **Eye’s** *qi* is **Purple**,
The **Seven Fluids** circulate in unison—
**Embracing Yellow** and **Returning Purple**, inhaling and exhaling,
All converge into the **Elixir Fields**.
The **Elixir Fields** have three abodes—
The **Root of Life and Spirit**.

According to the *Great Cavern Scripture* (《大洞经》):
One *cùn* behind the **brow** is the **Bright Hall Palace** (明堂官),
Left: **True Lord of the Bright Boy** (明童真君),
Right: **True Official of the Bright Girl** (明女真官),
Center: **True Lord of the Mirror** (明镜神君).

Two *cùn* behind the **brow** is the **Cavern Chamber** (洞房),
Left: **True Lord of the Primordial Hero** (元英君),
Right: **True Lord of the White Primordial** (白元君),
Center: **Soul of the Yellow Elder** (黄老魂).

Three *cùn* behind the **brow** is the **Elixir Palace** (丹田官), also called the **Mud Pill Palace** (泥丸官),
Left: **True Lord of the Upper Primordial Red Boy** (上元赤子君),
Right: **True Lord of the Imperial Official** (帝卿君).

Four *cùn* deeper is the **Flowing Pearl Palace** (流珠官),
Where the **True Spirit of the Flowing Pearl** (流珠真神) resides.

Five *cùn* deeper is the **Jade Emperor Palace** (玉帝官),
Where the **Jade Pure Spirit Mother** (玉清神母) resides.

One *cùn* above the **Bright Hall** is the **Celestial Court Palace** (天庭官),
Where the **Upper Pure Spirit Maiden** (上清神女) resides.

One *cùn* above the **Cavern Chamber** is the **Supreme Truth Palace** (极真官),
Where the **Supreme Emperor Consort** (太极帝妃) resides.

One *cùn* above the **Elixir Palace** is the **Elixir Mystery Palace** (丹玄官),
Where the **Central Yellow Supreme Unity Lord** (中黄太一君) resides.

One *cùn* above the **Flowing Pearl Palace** is the **Supreme Sovereign Palace** (太皇官),
Where the **Supreme Lord** (太上君) resides.
The **Hun** (雄一) is for males, the **Yin** (雌一) is for females;
The **Hun-Yin** (雄雌) two spirits—
Both males and females may cultivate them together.

The **Dark Chamber** illuminates the **Bright Hall’s** **Yang Gate** (阳门).
The **Hidden Chamber** holds self-reflection—
The **Mind and Eye** as clear mirrors,
Burning like the **Sun and Moon**.

The **Spirit** is boundless—
The **Mind’s** perception knows no limits;
When stored, it exists; when abandoned, it vanishes.

The **Mouth**—**Third Palace of the Jade Pool, Great Harmony** (玉池太和官)

The **saliva within the mouth** is the **Jade Elixir** (玉液), also called **Lingquan** (醴泉) or **Jade Nectar** (玉浆).
It stores water as a **pool**, softening the hundred joints,
harmonizing the five viscera—
all governed by the **Mouth Palace** (官主).

*One text reads* **Great Harmony Palace** (太和官), but this disrupts the rhyme.

The *Great Cavern Scripture* (大洞经) states:
*"Within the heart, at the stomach’s mouth, there stands a maiden,*
*resembling a young brother, clad in no garments,*
*upright in the stomach’s passage,*
*her mouth open, receiving the soul’s elixir,*
*inhaling the five breaths upward.*
*When the mouth is rinsed full—both inner and outer saliva—*
*swallow it whole; it descends straight into the **Mysterious Lady’s River** (玄女江).*

*After five rinses, strike the teeth three times,*
*and softly chant:*
*'Jade Purity, Most High—*
*nine heavens, nine spirits,*
*transformed in the Mysterious Lady,*
*descend into the Stomach’s Clarity.*

*Gold harmonizes with Jade, reflected—*
*the heart opens, the spirit brightens,*
*consuming daily essence,*
*Gold’s brilliance overflows.*

*Rinsing and swallowing the elixir—*
*disasters cannot touch it.*
*The elixir’s true *qi*—*
*evil cannot invade the upright.*

*The body emits luminous *qi*, fragrant as orchids,*
*abstaining from the five grains,*
*free of filth and dross.*

*Dispelling a hundred evils, Jade refines the face—*
*skin like frost and snow,*
*graceful as a maiden.*
*Those who diligently practice ascend to **Broad Cold** (广寒).*

*Broad Cold*—a name for the **Northern Celestial Palace** (北方仙官),
*also a mountain name, or **Shiguangxia** (尸广霞).*

The *Cavern of the True Scripture* (洞真经) says:
*"On the Winter Solstice,*
*the Moon hides in the **Broad Cold Palace** (广寒之官),*
*when it nurtures the Moon’s essence in the **Broad Cold Pool** (广寒之池).*
*Heavenly beings pluck the **Green Flower’s** (青华) branches,*
*to wipe away the Sun and Moon’s light."*

*Day and night without sleep—true perfection.*
*Diligently cultivate stillness and clarity,*
*and you become a **True Person** (真人).*

*The thunder roars, lightning strikes—*
*the spirit dissolves into stillness.*
*[Note: *Dímín* (泯泯) reads with level tone.]*

*Adjust the spirit, regulate the *qi*—*
*essence and soul serene and joyous.*
*Even amid thunderous claps, no fear takes hold.*

*It is also said:*
*The thunder’s roar and lightning’s strike—*
*this is the **striking of teeth** (叩齿).*
*Striking the teeth while storing thought—*
*this is the **spirit’s function** (神用);*
*do not call it *dímín*.*

---
**Yellow Court Chapter Fourth**
*The Yellow Court’s Inner Person wears **Brocade Robes** (锦衣).*
*The Yellow Court’s Inner Person*—this refers to the **Dao Mother** (道母),
*The Yellow Court True Person*—this refers to the **Dao Father** (道父),
*both inherent within the human body.*

*The Brocade Robes are complete with five colors—*
*the true *qi* of the five viscera,*
*all present within the three courts.*

*The Purple Flower’s flying skirt—*
*cloud-like *qi* entwined,*
*as the *Ten Directions Scripture* (十方经) says:*
*"The Most High Jade Emperor’s robes are adorned with luminous, flying clouds—*
*the attire of the immortals."*

*The cinnabar-green branches, emerald sprigs—*
*five colors of *qi* intertwined,*
*forming branches and tendrils,*
*the adornments of immortal garments."*

**Yellow Court Chapter Fifth**
*The Seven-Luo Jade Key seals the twin gates*—
an external symbol, a teaching.

*The seven orifices open and close by the Dao,*
lest they be opened recklessly.
*Luo*—the adornment of the key.

*Store the spirit, cross the arms, and close the eyes,*
thus called *"sealing the twin gates."*

*The double gates, the golden pass, the hidden pivot.*
*Gold*—taken for its firmness and rigidity.

*Laozi says:*
*"The skilled at sealing shut the primal pass,*
*and it cannot be opened*—
*those who cultivate life guard the spirit well,*
*lest it leak away."*

*The dark spring, the hidden gate, lofty and towering,*
*The dark spring*—the saliva in the mouth,
also called *Liquor of Jade*, or *Jade Dew*,
like a thick drink—
one name *Jade Spring*, one name *Jade Stream*,
one name *Jade Nectar*.

*The space between the brows is the gate courtyard,*
*the space between the kidneys is the hidden gate.*
Like the left and right of a door,
symbolizing the *Wei* center’s gate—
*the Dao.*

*The kidneys lie deep within the body,*
thus called the *hidden gate.*
Though the kidneys are beneath the five viscera,
when spoken of as *high*—
the form is submerged, the spirit stored,
right above the *elixir field*,
hence *high.*

*Within the Three Fields, the vital essence is subtle.*
An inner reference to practice.

*Within the elixir field,*
the spirit-*qi* transforms and responds,
sensing as the heart directs—
neither existence nor nonexistence,
indescribable in form or image.

*From coarse to subtle,*
crossing into mystery—
its ties are bound.
Thus speaking of *qi*,
*qi* takes the heart as master,
establishing its form.
Most refined, most subtle—
beyond counting or seeking.

*The Dao Machine Scripture says:*
*"Heaven has three luminaries—sun, moon, stars—
man has three treasures, three elixir fields.*
*Within the three elixir fields, the qi*
*—left green, right yellow,*
*above white, below black."*

*A graceful maiden, slender and veiled,*
*her radiance dimming the celestial glow.*
*The True Revelations say:*
*"Graceful maiden"*—the name of the ear spirit,
speaking of keen hearing, piercing clarity,
veiling the dark luminosity.

*The double hall shines brightly,*
illuminating the eight *Wei*.
*The double hall*—the throat’s name,
also called *double tower*, *double ring*.
This scripture says:
*"The Vermilion Palace’s double tower,*
*twelve tiers high."*
*The Vermilion Palace*—the heart.
The throat lies above the heart,
thus called *double hall*.
The throat—
the path of saliva,
flowing freely above and below,
nourishing the whole body,
brilliant in all eight directions.
The eight trigrams’ spirits are the *eight Wei*.

*The celestial court, the earthly pass,*
ranked like axes and hatchets,*

Two brows idle as the Celestial Court.
The Lady of *Zǐwēi* blesses:
*"Open the Celestial Court,
grant me eternal life."*

*"Listed axes and hatchets"*—speaking of valor and strength.

The *Lingtai* firm and unwaning.
The heart as *Lingtai*, saying the divine spirit dwells therein.
When still, it guards the One;
when moving, it preserves the spirit.
The spirit settled and secure,
never exhausted.

**Chapter Five: The Central Pool**
Within the Central Pool, the spirit wears a crimson pearl.
The gallbladder is the Central Pool,
the tongue-root the Flower Pool,
the lower abdomen’s sac the Jade Pool—
also the common name for the three pools.

The gallbladder’s region:
*"Dragon flag spreads across the sky,
casting fire-bells."*
The crimson pearl—
the fire-bell’s garment.

Scarlet brocade cloud-robes, bearing tiger talismans,
scarlet brocade embracing—
the hues of heart and lungs.
Above the gallbladder, thus called cloud-robes.
The talisman—
the talisman of fate.
The *Jiǔzhēn Sutra* says:
*"The Venerable Lord of the Yellow carries the black dragon’s tiger talisman,
wearing flowing-gold bells—
all the Daoist Sovereign’s attire."*
The horizontal passage, three inches, where the spirit resides—
an inner reference to matters.

---

The navel lies above the sac, hence it is called the **horizontal ford**.

Three inches below the navel is the **elixir field (dantian)**, where the **true person (zhēnrén)** and **innocent child (chìzǐ)** reside.

**Hidden moss** and **concealed dew** intertwine and mutually support one another—
this refers to the forms of male and female.

**Hidden moss** and **concealed dew** unite in copulation,
the natural Dao/Way.

According to the *Inner and Outer Divine Moss Sutra (Nèiwài Shénzhī Jué)*:
The essences of the five viscera are the **inner moss (nèizhī)**.
The **inner moss**, then, is the **hidden moss**.

Again it says:
**Hidden (yǐn)** means **profound (ào)**.

**Chapter Six of *Celestial Center (Tiānzhōng Zhāng)***:
*"Cultivate with care the **celestial center’s peak (Tiānzhōng zhī yuè)**,
the **celestial center’s peak**—this is the **nose (bí)**,
also called the **celestial terrace (Tiāntái)**.
The *Sutra on Dissolving Demons (Xiāomó Jīng)* says:
*'If one wishes to press the nose’s left and right sides,
it will make the person’s qi even.
This is called **scraping the celestial center’s peak (bì guàn zhōngyuè)**,
also known as **recording the Imperial Register (shūdì lù)**.'*
When the **soul’s dwelling (língzhái)** is purified, the **Jade Emperor (Yùdì)** may roam.
The **face (miàn)** is the **soul’s dwelling**,
also called the **cubit dwelling (chǐzhái)**,
for it is where the eyes, brows, nose, and mouth reside,
hence it is called a dwelling.
If cultivated to be clear and unobstructed, one becomes a **spirit-immortal (shénxiān)**.
The *Sutra on Piercing the Divine (Dòngshén Jīng)* states:
*"The face is the cubit dwelling."*
The character may also be written as **赤泽 (Chìzé)**.
*"The pathways of passage remain ever open, without cease."*
The *Sutra on Great Primordial Elixir Scenery (Tàisù Dānjǐng Jīng)* says:
*"Above one’s face, one should always rub with both hands,
up and down in accordance with the body’s form, without rest—
then the **qi of the ears, eyes, nose, and mouth (qìtún)** will flow freely."*

The **brow (méihào)** is called the **flower canopy (huágài)**,
covering the **bright pearl (míngzhū)**—
the **bright pearl**, this is the **eye (yǎn)**.
*"Nine abysses of sun and moon vanish into empty space."*
The *Five Celestial Bodies Ritual Affairs Sutra (Wǔxīn Xíngshì Jué)* says:
*"One inch directly above the brow is the **jade current (yùdāng)** at the **purple threshold (zǐquè)**,
left for the **sun (rì)**, right for the **moon (yuè)**."*
Again, the *Sutra on Jade Calendar (Yùlì Jīng)* says:
*"Above the **Great Clarity (Tàiqīng)** there are five-colored flower canopies in nine layers,
and so too is the human body—
preserve the **eye-child (yǎn tóng)** as bright as the sun and moon."*

Within the dwelling is the **constant true clothing (zhēncháng yī)**, the **elixir (dān)**.
**True (zhēn)** means the **heart-mind (xīnshén)**, that is, the **child of the Red City (Chìchéng tóngzi)**,
also called **True One (Zhēnyī)**,
also called **Innocent Child (Chìzǐ)**,
also called **Child Elixir (Zǐdān)**,
also called **True Person (Zhēnrén)**.
If the heart is preserved, it is seen;
if the **constant (cháng)** is preserved, it appears before one’s eyes,
responding to the heart.
The **elixir clothing (yīdān)**, symbolizing the **heart-qi’s crimson hue (xīnqì chìsè)**.
If one can perceive it, there will be no illness.
**Lord of the Primordial Yang (Yuánsāng zǐ)** says:
*"If one constantly preserves the heart-mind,
there will be no disease."*

The **crimson pearl’s spirit skirt (língqún)** displays **flowering emotions (huáqíng)**—
the **symbolic hues of the dark abdomen (xuānyīng)**."

The **external** is also explained. Beneath the tongue lies the **Primordial Mysterious (Xuānyīng)**, the shore of life and death.

The **internal** refers to its function. The **Primordial Mysterious** is the shore that governs the passage of **vital fluids (jīnyè)**.

The original scripture states:
*"The Primordial Mysterious is the channel of the brain, receiving the **Essence Palace (Jīngfǔ)**.
The **two pure and two mysterious qi (Qīngxuān èr qì)** radiate forth—
meaning the **exhalation and inhalation of yin and yang qi (tǔnà yīnyáng èr qì)**,
brilliantly manifesting in clarity.
If the **child (Zǐ)** encounters it, they ascend the **Celestial Path (Tiānhàn)**.
Humans who skillfully meet the principles of exhalation and inhalation
will become **Celestial Immortals (Tiānxiān)**.*

From the **Chapter on the Ultimate Dao (Zhìdào zhāng)**, the seventh:
*"The Ultimate Dao does not trouble with calculations—
simply preserve the True and it will come.
Focus the heart-mind, and you reach it.
The **mud pellet (Níhuán)** and the hundred joints all have **spirit (shén)**.
The **spirit** is the wondrous principle that gives voice to all things.
By observing its forms and establishing names, it is as follows:
The **spirit of the hair** is called **Azure Radiance (Cānghuá)**—**Tàiyuán**,
for **white and black** are termed **azure**.
It resides most prominently at the crown,
hence it is called **Tàiyuán**.
The **spirit of the brain** is called **Essence Root (Jīnggēn)**—**Níhuán**,
the official of the **elixir field (Dāntián)**,
the occupant of the **Yellow Court (Huángtíng)**,
the master of the **Chamber of Perfection (Dòngfáng)**,
and the root of **yin and yang**.
The **mud pellet** is the **symbolic form of the brain**.
The **spirit of the eyes** is called **Bright Mysterious (Míngxuān)**—**Yīnghuán**,
for the eyes are the **manifestation of the sun and moon**,
and they lie above the head,
hence it is called **Bright Mysterious**.
**Bright Mysterious** is the **Essence-color of the Child**.
The **internal** refers to its function.

The **spirit of the nose** is called **Jade Mound (Yùlóng)**—**Língjiān**,
for the **Jade Mound’s bone** symbolizes **jade**.
The **spirit-qi** communicates with the heavens,
endlessly entering and exiting,
hence it is called **Língjiān**.
The **spirit of the ears** is called **Void Leisure (Kōngxián)**—**Yōutián**,
for **void and leisure** are **profoundly still**,
and hearing things brings clarity.
The **spirit’s dwelling** is thus called **field**.

The **spirit of the tongue** is called **Direct Harmony (Zhènglún)**—**Tōngmìng**,
for the tongue governs the throat,
and the **nature and life** are preserved through its five flavors,
each with its own **order and principle**.
The **spirit of the teeth** is called **Gleaming Edge (Yìfēng)**—**Luōqiān**,
for the teeth are **firm and sharp**,
like a **sword’s gleaming blade** or a **knife’s edge**,
crushing and consuming all things.

The **spirit of the face** is called **Clan Mud Pellet (Zōngníhuán)**,
the **brain’s elixir field**,
the sovereign of the hundred spirits.
The **mud pellet** has **nine True Ones (Jiǔzhēn)**, each with their own **chamber**:
The **Great Cavern Scripture (Dàdòng jīng)** says:
*"Three Primordials conceal their transformations,
three threes forming nine—
hence there are three elixir fields,
three nines making twenty-seven.
When the **spirit-qi** harmonize,
they form the **three officials**.
There are also three **Chambers of Perfection**,
uniting with the **three Primordials** to form nine officials.
Within them dwell the **nine True Spirit-People (Jiǔzhēn shénrén)**,
to be preserved.
They are also called the **Nine Breaths of the Celestial Emperor (Tiānhuáng jiǔpò)**,
transforming into **nine spirit-gases**,
each residing in one **Chamber of Perfection**.
Here, a square inch holds them—
for each **chamber** is one inch,
hence the brain has **lobes**.
They wear **purple robes** and fly in **silken skirts**.
The **nine True Ones’ attire** all symbolizes **qi-colors**.
**Fly** means **light**.
But think upon **one aspect of longevity** without end—
preserve the **nine True Ones**,
and the **Way of Non-Death** is attained.
They do not reside separately—
all dwell within the **elixir field**.
They sit in ranks, facing outward—
the **spirit** encircles the **elixir field** and extends to the face,
preventing misfortune.
The **Eight Essentials Scripture (Bāsù jīng)** says:
*"The True has nine ranks,
facing outward in their stations.
The **Highest True** faces upward,
the **High True** faces south,
the **Great True** faces east,
the **Spirit True** faces west,
the **Mysterious True** faces north,
the **Immortality True** faces northeast,
the **Heavenly True** faces southeast,
the **Soul True** faces southwest,
and the **Supreme True** faces northwest.
The **True Ones** are those who—
without looking, are clear,
without listening, are keen,
without speaking, are upright,
without moving, comply.
The **heart-mind spirit** is called **Guard the Soul (Shǒulíng)**—**Dānyuán**,
for the **internal** symbolizes its function.
The **heart** is the **primordial organ (yuán)** of the **viscera (zàngfǔ)**,
the **color of the south’s fire (Huǒ)**,
the **dwelling of the spirit**,
hence it is called **Guard the Soul**.

The **spirit of the lungs** is called **Resplendent Radiance (Hàohuá)**—**Xūchéng**,
for the **lungs** are the **radiant canopy (huágài)** of the heart.
**Resplendent** means **white**,
the **color of the west’s metal (Jīn)**,
and the **lungs** are white.
Their **substance** is **light and void**,
hence they are called **Void Completion**.

The **spirit of the liver** is called **Dragon Smoke (Lóngyān)**—**Hánmíng**,
for the **liver** is the **wood organ (Mù)**, bearing the **color of the east’s Azure Dragon (Qīnglóng)**.
It **mastered the eyes**—
when the sun rises in the east,
**wood generates fire**,
hence it is called **Contain the Bright**.
The **veiled and obscured** guide the **smoke**,
mastering **clarity and turbidity**.
**Veiled and obscured** are the **wood symbol**.
When **fire** is obtained, **smoke** arises;
when **yang** is obtained, **qi** is born.
**Clarity** brings **bright eyes**,
**turbidity** brings **dark eyes**.
Some versions omit this sentence.

The **spirit of the kidneys** is called **Deep Darkness (Xuānmíng)**—**Yùyīng**,
for the **kidneys** belong to **water**,
hence they are called **Deep Darkness**.
The **kidney essence** is the **child**,
hence it is called **Nurture the Child**.

The **spirit of the spleen** is called **Constant Dwelling (Chángzhài)**—**Húnzhǐng**,
for the **spleen** is the **central organ (Mù)**,
the **earth position (Tǔ)**,
hence it is called **Constant Dwelling**—
the **Yellow Court’s official**.
The **spleen** grinds and dissolves food,
its **spirit** nourished and its **power** robust,
hence it is called **Soul’s Rest**.

The **spirit of the gallbladder** is called **Dragon’s Luster (Lóngyào)**—**Wēimíng**,
for the **gallbladder’s color** is **greenish-yellow**,
hence it is called **Dragon’s Luster**.
It **mastered courage and defense**,
hence it is called **Wēimíng**.
It takes the **eastern Azure Dragon’s thunderous symbol** from the **external**.

The **six viscera and five organs’ spirit-substances (Shén tǐ jīng)**,
nourishing and safeguarding the **body**,
cannot be neglected—
hence they are called **spirit-substances**.

The **heart, liver, lungs, kidneys, and spleen** are the **five organs**,
while the **gallbladder, stomach, large intestine, small intestine, bladder, and triple burner** are the **six viscera**.
The term **viscera (fǔ)** is akin to **palaces and cities**,
taking the meaning of **receiving things within**.
The **organs (zàng)** are each of a distinct **substance**,
collectively housed in the **body**,
hence they are called **organs**.

Many speak of the **triple burner (Sānjiāo)**,
yet none have clarified its **true nature**.
Indeed, the **upper, middle, and lower systems** of the **three organs (heart, liver, lungs)** are the **triple burner**.
The **Yellow Court Scripture (Zhōnghuáng jīng)** says:
*"The **lungs’ head** is the **triple burner**—
it refers to its **location**.*
According to the **five directions’ colors**,
the **spleen** is the **Yellow Center**,
and should be the **sovereign of the five organs**—
yet now the **heart** is considered the sovereign.
Why is this?

The answer is:
*The **heart** resides among the **organs**,
its **substance** being **void and receptive**.
The **void and formless** are the **body of spirit and awareness**,
the **source of movement and function**,
hence it **oversees all directions** and attains its **sovereign status**.
It **cannot be described by symbolic numbers**,
nor **classified by material forms**.
All are **operated within the heart** by the **Celestial Scripture (Tiānjīng)**—
the **five organs and six viscera** each have their **assigned functions**,
all with their **lawful symbols**.
In harmony with **heaven and earth**,
following **yin and yang**,
they naturally **respond and conform** to the **Dao**,
hence it is called **operating the Celestial Scripture**.
Preserve them day and night,
and **longevity** is naturally attained.

The **five divine essences** align with their respective colors—
preserve them in thought without neglect,
and the **Way of Immortality** is attained.

The **Scripture of the Transcendents** states:
Nurture the **qi of the five organs**,
transforming it into **five-colored clouds**,
ever dwelling atop the crown,
enveloping and shielding the body.
The **sun** abides before you,
the **moon** behind you—
**Azure Dragon** to the left,
**White Tiger** to the right,
**Vermilion Bird** in front,
**Black Tortoise** behind.
This is the **Way to dispel malevolence and attain longevity**.

**Chapter Nine of the Lung Section**
The **Lung’s office** resembles a **flowering canopy**—
a **Metal Official**,
the **Lung** presiding over the five organs above.
Its **four drooping tendrils** form the character *sì* (四).
Beneath it sits a **youth upon a jade gate**,
the youth named **Hàohuá**—
the **Lung’s form** mirrors a canopy.
Thus, the **"jade gate"** below refers to
the **white qi of the kidneys** ascending to connect with the **Lung**.

The **Seven Primordial Sons** govern **qi regulation**;
the **Son of Primordial Yang** declares:
The **Seven Primordial Lords** bear **armor and talismans**,
warding off calamity and dispersing **malevolent qi** through the **seven orifices**,
commanding **clarity of ear and eye**.
The **Seven Primordial** are the **original qi of the seven orifices**.
Externally corresponding to the **Central Peak**—
the **nose** (as **navel**) and **navel** (as **seven-gated portal**).
The **Central Peak** is the **nose**,
also the **navel**—
the **navel** as **Kunlun Mountain**,
the **nose** as the **gate of the seven breaths**.
*Position* here means *command*.

**White silk robes and yellow cloud sash**—
the **white silk robes** are the **Lung’s membrane’s hue**,
the **yellow cloud sash** the **yellow vessels** within the **Lung**,
branching and interlacing like **cloud-like patterns**.
When **breathing is labored**, the body feels unwell—
this occurs at times.
**Swiftly preserve the White Primordial** and **harmonize the six breaths**,
for the **White Primordial Lord** governs the **Lung’s office**.
The *Great Cavern Scripture* states:
The **White Primordial Lord** dwells in the **right chamber of the inner sanctum**.

**Divine beings** who gaze long suffer no calamity—
**malevolence does not assail the upright**.

The **Way** is ever applied—then the form does not stagnate.
To **preserve this Dao** constantly,
the form and **qi** flourish in **virtue** and sincerity—
the work of **spirit**’s response.

**Chapter Ten: The Heart Department**
The **Heart Department’s palace** holds the lotus in bud—
the **Fire Official’s domain**.
The **Heart’s substance** mirrors the unopened lotus.
Beneath, the **Red Primordial’s** young attendant dwells—
the **Heart’s spirit** guards the **Red Primordial** with **numinous stillness**.
The **spirit** abides within the **Heart**, yet is said to "descend"—
this refers to the **Flower Canopy’s** domain.
It governs **harmonized warmth and cold**, **nourishing defense and **sweep**—
**warmth and cold** signify **yin-yang’s** stillness and agitation.
Humans must **harmonize** to **nourish** their bodies.
As *Laozi* says:
*"Agitation overcomes cold, stillness overcomes heat—
**clearing and tranquil** as the **Way’s** rectitude for all."*

**Crimson brocade robes** and **jade net sash**—
mirroring the **Heart’s** hue.
With **Lung’s white breath** like **jade net**.
**Golden bells and vermilion sashes** seated in **ease**—
the **golden bells** symbolize **internal elixirs**.
The **vermilion sashes** symbolize **blood’s song**.
To **sit in ease** is to speak of **spirit’s** tranquility.
*The Nine True Scripture* states:
*"The Yellow-Lao Lord wears flowing gold bells—
**immortal attire**."*

**Regulating blood and vitalizing the body**—
when the **Heart** is at peace and the body harmonized,
there is no sickness or untimely death.

「The external manifestation is in the mouth and tongue, exhaling the five efflorescences.
The Heart governs the mouth and tongue,
**exhaling and inhaling** the **fluids** of the five **viscera**,
**discriminating** the **five phases’** flavors—
thus it is said: *external manifestation*.

When at the brink of death, calling upon it brings revival,
In times of illness and calamity, **invoke the Dan Yuan**—
the **Tongzi** in **crimson robes** and **red cap**—
to **save and protect** it.

Prolonged practice makes one **ascend the Azure Clouds**.
Constantly cultivating this **Dao**,
one may attain **feathered immortality**.

The **Liver Department, Chapter Eleven**:
The **Liver’s** palace is **encased in emerald layers**—
the **Wood Official’s** domain,
where the **Liver’s** hue is **verdant and jade-green**,
mirroring the **stacked layers** of its **power**.

Below sits **Lord Qing Tong**, the **Liver’s** divine child,
bound to the **Square Wood** position,
master of the **blue**—
thus it is said: *the Qing Tong, leftmost, is the divine child*.
The **divine child** is also called **Han Ming**.

Above is the **Flowering Canopy**,
thus it is said: *below*—
it **initiates** all **passages** and **mirrors**,
the **beginning of clarity**.
At this time, it governs **Spring**,
the **blue yang’s** origin,
beginning at the **orifice**, which **controls the eyes**—
the **five phases’** **passages** and **mirrors**—
thus it is said: *the beginning of clarity*.

Wearing **blue brocade robes** and **jade bells** as a sash—
**blue brocade**, the **Liver’s** hue,
**jade bells**, the **pendant of white boar**—
a symbol of **suspension**.
*The Scripture of Ascension to the Mystic* says:
*"The Jade Emperor of the Three Heavens wears a **fire-jade pendant**."*
*The Scripture of the Pure Spirit* says:
*"Lord Ling Yao wears **single-layered blue brocade robes**."*
All are **attire of the immortals**.

**Harmonizing** and **regulating** the **soul**, **spirit**, **essence**, and **body fluids**—
this refers to **internal cultivation**.

Bound to **Spring’s** warmth, it **nurtures** all things to **fulfillment**.
The **Liver’s** position governs the **eyes**,
mirroring the **clarity of the sun and moon**.

All **hundred diseases** are **housed** here—
**left** is called *without heroism*,
as the **Liver’s spirit** resides on the left—
thus it is **preserved**.
There is an **origin** for *without heroism*.
*Without heroism* is the **symbol of vitality’s** **beginning**.

**Unifying** all five **viscera** in **seven days’** practice **fulfills** them.
The five **viscera** are **simultaneously preserved**,
thus it is said: *unified practice*.
Seven days mark **one cycle**.
**One cycle**, **one renewal**—
thus the *Zhou Yi* says: *"Seven days brings restoration."*

At the **brink of death**, **focus on the spirit**—
**dying**, then **reviving**.
**Preserve** the **image** of the **blue-robed divine child**,
as previously described.
**Capturing the soul** and **returning the spirit**—
**eternally steadfast**.

The *Tàiwēi Lingshū* says:

On the **3rd, 13th, and 23rd** of each month at **dusk**,
the **three souls** abandon the body and wander outside.
Those who **capture** them should **recline and sleep**,
remove the pillow and stretch the feet,
cross the hands over the heart,
close the eyes,
and **retain the breath** for three **breaths**,
**knock the teeth** three times,
and **preserve** in the mind a **crimson qi** like a **falcon**,
emerging from within and **passing through the throat**.
The crimson qi **expands**, then **envelops the body** and transforms into **fire**,
which **consumes the body** all around.
When **awareness** arises of a **slight warmth** in the body,
call aloud the names of the three souls: **Shuānglíng, Táiguāng, Yōujīng**,
and then **recite the subtle incantation** as follows:

*"Tàiwēi Xuānguān,
Zhōnghuáng shǐ qīng.
Nèi liàn sān hún,
Táiguāng ānníng.
Shénbǎo yùshì,
Yǔ wǒ jùshēng.
Bùdé wàngdòng,
Jiàn zhě tài líng.
Ruò yù fēixíng,
Nányì zhì shàngqīng.
Ruò yǒu jīkě,
Dé yǐn xuánshuǐ yùjīng."*

Moreover, on the **new moon, full moon, and last day** of each month,
the **seven spirits** drift and **consort with ghosts and demons**.
To **restrain and return** the spirits,
on these **evenings** one should **recline and sleep**, stretch the feet,
cover both ears with the **palms**,
and **join the fingertips** at the **nape**,
**retain the breath** seven times,
**knock the teeth** seven times,
and **preserve** in the mind a **white qi** at the **nostril’s tip**,
like a **mung bean** in size,
gradually **expanding** until it **crowns** the body’s **upper and lower regions** in **nine layers**.
The qi **suddenly transforms** into two **Azure Dragons** in both eyes,
and two **White Tigers** in both nostrils,
all **facing outward**.
The **Vermilion Crow** resides in the heart,
**facing inward**.

The **Azure Tortoise** dwells beneath the left foot;
the **Spiritual Serpent** beneath the right foot.
Two **Jade Maidens** in **brocade robes**,
holding **flames of fire** at the **ear gates**.
Complete, **swallow the saliva seven times**,
and **call aloud the names of the seven spirits**:
**Shīgǒu** (Emaciated Hound), **Fúshǐ** (Supine Arrow), **Qiǎoyīn** (Sparrow Shadow), **TūNZéi** (Devouring Thief), **Fēidú** (Non-Venom), **Chúhuì** (Filth Remover), and **Chòufèi** (Fetid Lung).

Then **chant softly the incantation**:
*"White qi ninefold revolves,
restraining the rogue and malevolent spirits.
The heavens stand guard at the gates,
the maiden holds the pass.
When refinement is smooth and gentle,
let harmony dwell with me.
No reckless movement—
observe the source of form.
If hunger or thirst arise,
listen to drink the **Moon Yellow Pill** on the **Dan Day**."*

**Kidney Department Chapter XII**
The **Kidney Department’s palace** belongs to the **Xuan** (Mysterious) **Gate**,
the **Water Official**.
The **Xuan Gate** is the **Kidney’s form**.
**Xuan**, the color of water.
This is the **Inner Symbolism** doctrine.
Within it lies the **Boy** in **Mysterious Darkness** above,
the **Kidney** as the **Lower Darkness**,
its spirit **Mysterious and Dark**,
named **Yùyīng** (Nurturing Infant).
The **Heart** is the **Upper Darkness**.
The **Upper Darkness** is profound and distant,
its **qi** linked to the **Kidney**,
hence the phrase *"Mysterious Darkness above"*.
It governs all **Six Palaces** and the **Nine Fluids’ source**,
the **Five Skins** and **Six Viscera**,
the **Nine Fluids** intermingling,
a hundred **pores** flowing freely—
if one is lost, all perish.
The **Six Viscera** are as previously stated.
The **Nine Fluids** are the **essences** of the **Nine Orifices**.
Externally, they manifest as **a hundred fluids** at the **ear gates**;
the **Kidney Official** governs the ears—
if its **qi** wanes, deafness follows.
When **yin** and **yang** harmonize,
**blood** and **fluids** flow unimpeded.
**Azure brocade robes** dance with **Dragon banners**.
**Azure brocade** symbolizes the **Kidney’s color**;
**Cloud robes** symbolize the **Kidney’s membrane**;
**Dragon banners** symbolize the **Azure Qi**.
The *Nine True Scripture* states:
*"The Dao Lord wears **Azure Brocade**,
adorned with a **Cloud-Hued Kirtle***.
Ascending to **Luminous Clouds**, **Sun, Moon, and Mist**,
when the **Kidney’s qi** is full,
ears and eyes are sharp,
**yin** and **yang** do not decay.
This is the **Outer Symbolism** doctrine.
A thousand calamities and diseases—
urgently **preserve** this vision.
The **Original Yang Son** declares:
*"Cold and heat interbreed,
male and female complete each other*.
Within the **Kidney**, two spirits always wear **Azure Brocade**—
the **left male** adorned with **Sun**,
the **right female** with **Moon**.
If you **visualize** them,
then **disasters and illnesses** will never arise.
The **Two Water Kings** face the **Gate of Birth**,
the **Kidney’s twin organs**—
hence the term *"two departments"*.
The **Kidney Official** as **Water King**
transforms into the **Red Boy**,
hence the **Gate of Birth**.
This grants **longevity** and **ascension to the Nine Heavens**—
the **Red Boy** becomes the **True Person** and ascends to the **Nine Heavens**.
The **Nine Heavens** refer to the **Nine Azure Qi Heavens**,
whose **qi** governs **life**.

**Liang Qiuzi’s Annotation**

**Spleen Department Chapter XIII**
The **Spleen Department’s palace** belongs to **Wu** and **Ji**,
the **Earth Official**.
**Wu** and **Ji**, the **central hour** of the **Earthly Branches**.

The **Spleen Department Chapter XIII**
Within is the **luminous child** wrapped in **yellow garments**,
the **luminous child** being the **soul at rest**.
The **yellow garments**, the color of **Earth**.
**Dissolving grains and dispersing qi** to **hold the teeth**,
for the **Spleen** is the **pivot of the five viscera**.
The **Spleen grinds and dissolves food**—complete.
The **teeth** act as the **filtering sieve**—hence, **holding the teeth**.
This is the **Great Granary’s two luminous children**,
the **Great Granary**, being the **Spleen Department**.
This **luminous child** refers to the **Spleen Spirit**—**harmony**.
Sitting upon the **Ninefold Golden City Platform**,
through **meditation and contemplation**, the **Spirit’s form** naturally manifests.
A **square inch** within the **Command Gate**.
This is the **center of the Yellow Court**,
the **place of the Elixir Field** also.
It **regulates the hundred grains and five flavors**, their **aroma**—
the **Spleen’s grinding** produces this **taste**.
It **repels empty depletion and prevents illness**—
**internal matters** are thus addressed.
Food **dissolves**—hence the result.
**Externally**, it corresponds to the **measure of the face’s qi** and **fragrant hue**,
the **measure of the face**, being the **cheek**.
**Hunger and satiety, empty depletion**—
these **manifest in the complexion**.
**Radiance and luster** arise to **reveal**,
**demonstrating** **emptiness and fullness**.
**Yellow brocade jade garments** with **tiger talismans**—
the **Spleen governs the center**;
**yellow** refers to the **Yellow Court True Person** wearing **brocade robes**.
*The **Jade Purity Hidden Classic** says*,
the **Highest Dao Sovereign** wears the **Divine Tiger Great Talisman**.
**Meditation** on the **Three Old Ones** ascending lightly—
the **Three Old Ones** being the **Sovereigns of Primordial Old, Mysterious Old, and Yellow Old**.
**Contemplate the True Person** within the **Spleen**,
and **natural transformation** will ensue.
**Child**, meaning **one who receives the Yellow Court’s teachings**.
**Longevity and high immortality**—**distant from death’s calamity**.
**Zhuangzi said**:
*"As life arises, death arises; as death arises, life arises.
As possible, it becomes impossible; as impossible, it becomes possible."*
Through this **discourse**, the **principle is balanced**.
Hence, the **eternally living** do not **die**,
and the **silently extinguished** do not **live**.
**Not dying and not living**—this is **true longevity**;
**not living and not dying**—this is **true silent extinction**,
what **death’s calamity** can reach?

---
**Gallbladder Department Chapter XIV**
Within is the **child of brilliance**, **radiant and mighty**,
*Annotation #2 says*:
the **Gallbladder Spirit** is **Dragon Radiance**, named **Mighty Brilliance**—
**courage and defense**.
**Eightfold thunderous vibrations** exalt the **jade standards**,
**eightfold thunderous vibrations** symbolizing **anger and wrath**.
The **jade standards**, the **color of firm qi**.
**Dragon flags** span the **heavens**, hurling **fire bells**.
The **Gallbladder** bears the **color of the Azure Dragon**;
**standards and flags**, the **tools of valor and battle**.
The **fire bells**, symbolizing the **fleshy pearls** at the **Gallbladder’s edge**.
When **angry**, they **stir and rise**—hence the term **"hurl"**.
They **command all qi and force**, holding the **tiger soldiers**.
**Gallbladder force** is **mutually employed**,
**commanding defense against calamity**—hence, **holding the tiger soldiers**.
**Externally**, they correspond to the **eyelids, nostrils, and upper lip**—
**internal matters** are thus addressed.
**Internal matters** are addressed.

The **Heart’s** joys and angers manifest at the **eyebrows and eyes**—
**Brain and hair** mutually support, their brilliance unyielding.

When **humans** are shaken with rage, their **hair stands on end**—
**Nine-hued brocade robes**, **green Azure Dragon skirts**,
**Azure brocade**, binding the **Nine Directions’ qi** in color.
**Green Azure skirts**, the **Gallbladder membrane’s** form.

**Gilded belts** with **jade Dragon-Tiger patterns**,
**Gallbladder’s** **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power** in adornment.
**Capable of preserving** **virtue/power** and **riding the Regency Cloud**—
**Internal imagery** thus invoked.

**If one steadfastly harbors** the **Gallbladder’s Dao/Way** without fatigue, then **the Way of Immortality** may be **mastered**.

**Employing the Ten Thousand Spirits** to **pay homage to the Three Primordials**—
The **Three Primordials**, **Dao/Way Lords** of the **Three Pure Ones**, to whom all **celestial spirits and immortals** submit in reverence.

**Spleen’s Chapter Fifteen: The Spleen’s Length**
The **Spleen** stretches a **foot**, **covering the Great Granary**—
The **Great Granary**, the **Stomach** also. The *Zhong Huang Jing* states: The **Stomach** is the **Great Granary Lord**.

The **Sun of Primordial Yang** says: The **Spleen** lies **horizontally above the Stomach**.
The **Middle Department’s** **Lord Lao** governs the **Bright Hall**—
The **Spleen**, the **Yellow Court’s** **official**, is **Lord Lao’s** domain.
**Externally**, it **responds to the Bright Hall**, where **eyebrows** meet—**one inch** is its mark.

Its **character** is **Ling Yuan**, named **Hun Kang**—
The **Spleen grinds food**, **consuming and harmonizing** within and without.
The **Large Intestine**, the **Stomach’s son**, **receives and nourishes** in **Hun Yuan’s** **tranquility**.

It **heals all a hundred diseases**, **consuming the roots of grain**—
**Stomach’s** **nourishment and splendor** ensure **no affliction or injury**.
**Yellow robes**, **purple belts** with **Dragon-Tiger patterns**—
The **Spleen**, **residing above the Stomach**, hence its **yellow robes**.
**Purple belts** with **Dragon-Tiger patterns**, the **Stomach’s network’s** form.

**Prolonging vitality** and **benefiting life** **relies on the Lord and King**—
The **Great Granary** and **Hun Kang**, **acting as Lord and King**.

**Threefold invocation** of my name **opens divine communion**—
**Reflecting on the Stomach’s spirit**, the **heart becomes vacant**, its **mirror-like clarity** revealed.

**The Three Elders** sit together, **each with their retinue**—
The **Upper Primordial Elder** **Lord Lao** dwells in the **Upper Yellow Court’s** **officialdom**, with **Nihuan Lord**, **Canghua Lord**, **Qingcheng Lord**, and the **True Person of the Bright Hall**, along with the **sovereigns and ministers** within the **Bright Hall** and the **parents of the Cavern**, as **companions**.

The **Middle Primordial Elder** **Lord Lao** resides in the **Middle Yellow Court’s** **officialdom**, with **Chicheng Child**, **Dantian Lord**, **Haohua Lord**, **Hanming Lord**, **Yingxuan Lord**, and the **True Person of the Dantian** as **companions**.

The **Lower Primordial Elder** **Lord Lao** abides in the **Lower Yellow Court’s** **officialdom**, with **Taiyi Lord**, **Hunting Lord**, **Lingyuan Lord**, **Great Granary Lord**, and the **True Person of the Dantian** as **companions**.

**Constantly nurturing** the **Three Elders’ harmony**, the **Ten Thousand Spirits flow freely**, their **positions guarding and patrolling**—**no deviation or failure**.

**Either vitality or pregnancy**—**each holds fast to their own method**—
The *Yulu Jing* says: The **Lower Dantian**, the **root of human life**, where **spirit and vitality** are **stored**, is the **Primordial Qi’s source**.
**Located three inches below the navel**, it **adheres to the spine**, known as the **Chamber of the Red Infant**.
**Men store their essence**, **women their fetus** there.
It **governs the harmony of the Red Infant**, the **portal of yin and yang**.

Its **qi within the Dantian**, **left green, right yellow**, **above white, below black**.
**Peach Boy** **unites and prolongs**, generating **Luminous Radiance**.

**Peach Boy**, the **Yin-Yang Spirit’s** name, also called **Bo Tao**.
The *Sutra of Immortality* states: Within the **Gate of Life’s** **navel officialdom** resides a **Great Lord**, named **Peach Boy**, with the **character** **He Yan**, clad in **crimson robes**, wearing a **purple Peony Crown**, **preserved at twilight**—the **Six Jia** and **Six Ding** attendants **serve humanity**.
**Luminous Radiance**, the **unwavering qi of yin and yang**.

**Men and women** **revolve ninefold** to **achieve Peach’s Tranquility**—
**Men and women** in **union must preserve the Three Dantian’s** **method**.
**Peach’s Tranquility**, the **Dantian’s lower spirit’s** name, **oversees yin-yang affairs**.
**Revolving three times** makes **nine**—hence **revolve ninefold**.
The *Great Cavern True Sutra* says: The **Three Primordials** **conceal their transformations**, then **become the Three Officials**.
Within the **Three Officials** reside **Nine Spirits**—
**Upper, Middle, Lower Primordials**, **Taiyi**, **Gongzi**, **Baiyuan**, **Wu Ying**, **Siling**, **Peach’s Tranquility**—
Each **holds their own domain**, hence **Peach’s Tranquility**.

**Dao Father and Dao Mother** **face each other**—
**Yin and yang** **combine as one**, hence **facing each other**.
**Master Father and Master Mother** dwell in the **Crimson Mystic Village**—
**Dao/Way** is the **ultimate teacher**, the **master of yin and yang**.
**Crimson Mystic Village**, the **preservation of the Dantian’s** **method**.

**It may be used** in **meditation** to **ascend the Void**—
The **Way of learning immortality**.
**Though paths diverge**, **they unite at the final goal**.
**Combining the Three Fields** as **one**, **dispersing one as three**—this is the **essence of the Way**.
The *Mystic Marvels Inner Canon* says: **To manifest longevity**, **the Three One must be illuminated**.

**Sealing the Three Passes**, **grasping and securing**—
The text says: **The mouth** is the **Heavenly Pass**, the **spirit’s** **mechanism**;
**The hands** are the **Human Pass**, **controlling prosperity and decline**;
**The feet** are the **Earthly Pass**, the **gate of life**.

The **navel below, three inches**, is also called the **Three Passes**—
Speaking of **securing essence** and **protecting qi**, **not recklessly expending or leaking**.

**Rinsing and swallowing** **golden nectar**, **ingesting jade essence**—
**Golden nectar**, **jade essence**, the **saliva within the mouth**.
The *Great Cavern Sutra* says: **To consume the Mystic Root’s** **method**, **store in the heart** a **Stomach’s** **maiden**, in the **form of an infant**, clad in **primordial robes**, standing upright within the **Stomach’s conduit**, **opening her mouth** to **receive the spirit’s fluid**, **inhaling the Five Qi**—when **saliva fills the mouth**, **swallow it internally and externally**, **sending it into the Mystic Woman’s** **mouth**. After the **Five Offenses** are **complete**, **knock the teeth three times**, **swallowing the saliva ninefold**.

**Thus reaching the state of no-death**, the **Three Worms vanish**—
The *Cavern Spirit’s Decision* says: The **Upper Worm** is **white and green**, the **Middle Worm** is **white and yellow**, the **Lower Worm** is **white and black**.
When **humans die**, the **Three Worms exit** as **corpse ghosts**, **each transforming** into **things**, **bringing harm to the form**—**striking and breaking them**. The remaining **myriad worms** all **perish with the corpse**.
Hence, **those who study immortality** must **deplete their essence**, **guard against the Five Emotions’** **qi**, then **consume elixirs** to **banish the Three Worms**.

It also says: The **Upper Corpse** is **Peng Shan**, making **people crave rich flavors**, their **desires congealing and stagnant**;
The **Middle Corpse** is **Peng Zhi**, making **people covet wealth and treasures**, **fond of anger and wrath**;
The **Lower Corpse** is **Peng Jiao**, making **people love fine clothing**, **indulging in young women’s** **charms**.
Also named the **Three Poisons**.

The mind and intent ever harmonious, flourishing in joy—
The **Dao** flows unimpeded.

The **qi** of the Five Peaks rises as **Peng** and **Heng**,
The **qi** of the Five **Zang** organs becomes the Five Peaks’ clouds.
**Peng** and **Heng**—this is the flowing circulation of **Yuan** and **Yong** **qi**.

Nurture and irrigate the **Jade Hall** to repay oneself,
The **Jade Hall**, the **Nose Hall**—when the Three Worms are gone,
True **qi** harmonized, entering and exiting the **Mysterious Female**,
Endlessly unbroken, hence it is said to repay oneself.

The Five Forms complete and firm, free from calamity.
The Five **Forms** and Five **Zang** organs naturally correspond.

**Upper Contemplation**, Chapter Sixteen:
**Upper Contemplation**—the Three **Yuan** like strung pearls,
The Three **Yuan** refers to the **Yuan** of the Three Lights—Sun, Moon, and Stars—
Not the Three **Yuan** of upper, middle, and lower.

Their radiance descends, illuminating the nine quarters,
The Three Lights above, illuminating below to the nine directions.
The nine quarters, the nine regions—
Ever preserving the Sun and Moon, piercingly illuminating the body.

The Five **Lings** at night illuminate the eight regions,
The Five **Lings**, the Five Stars—
Their brilliance arrayed across the body; if preserved,
Then one shares in Heaven’s blessings.

The **Child** abides within, the **Inner Sovereign** plays with me,
The **Dao** without thought—when stirred, it responds.

Clad in **Feng** robes, bearing the **Hu** talisman,
The attire and insignia of the **Xian** officials.

In one breath, soon ascending to the **Xu Yuan**.
One—this is the name for the undivided.
Devotion to the **Dao** in singularity, merging with the **Xu**,
Then the **Shen** and **Xian** may be attained.
As **Zhuangzi** says: *When a man knows the One, all things are complete.*

Within the **one-inch square**, the deep thought is concealed,
The **one-inch square**, the **Lower Close**—below the navel, three inches,
a square inch in circumference, where the male stores his **jing**.
Speaking of its depletion and concealment.

Not square, not round—closing the window and door.

The **square still, the round bright**—immovable yet not still;
Only block and seal, lest it leak unchecked.

The **Three Spirits** return **jing**—old becomes young again,
Returning **qi** and **shen** to the **Three Fields**—thus longevity is prolonged.
**Hun** and **po** guard within, uncompetitive.

*Hun* is **yang**, *po* is **yin**—each attaining its own,
Thus the *Yijing* says: *"One yin, one yang—this is the Dao."*

The **Divine Pearl** is born within the belly, clasped in place,
The belly’s heart illuminated, pearls and jade emitted from the mouth.
According to the *Five Spirits’ Ritual Decisions*:
*"Two brows’ midpoint, straight in one inch—this is the **Jade Current’s Purple Gate**.*
Yet observing the text’s intent, this may not be correct.

The **Soul’s Essence** flows into the **Mysterious Gate**—how could it be lost?
Preserve the **shen**, guard the **One**—no premature decline.

The **Luminous Bamboo** stretches ten thousand *zhang*—an outer symbol.
The **Luminous Bamboo**, the **Jade Tree**; ten thousand *zhang*, a lofty realm.
When the body attends the **True**, the **shen** and **ming** shelter beneath.

The **Three Hun** settle—**Emperor’s Book of Command** is fulfilled.
When the **True Dao** is complete, the **Book of Command** is inscribed.
**Chapter Seventeen: The Soul’s Platform**

The **Soul’s Platform** is dense and shadowed, gazing at the **Yellow Wilds**,
*The **Ling Kui***—the heart—must focus solely on the **Yellow Court**.
The **Yellow Court** is the **Yellow Wilds** itself.

The **Three-Inch Chambers**—each distinct, with their own upper reaches,
The **Three Dan Fields**—upper, middle, lower—each a separate realm,
each a square inch in circumference, hence *"three inches."*
Even now, people still call the heart *"the square inch"*—one place.

Ask of the **Gatekeepers**, the **Ying-Wei**—high and profound.
The **Three Fields** each have their **Gatekeepers**,
**Ying** and **Wei** divided—most exalted, most mysterious.
The heart must receive and store the thought.

The **Cavern Chamber’s Purple Extremes**—**Lingming’s Gate**,
The *Great Cavern Scripture* says:
*"Two brows’ midpoint, straight up three *fen*—this guards the **Double Fields of the Inch**.*
Entering the bone’s edge three *fen*, there is a **Platform and Gate, Bright Hall**.*
Seven *fen* deep, left is the **Green Chamber**, right the **Purple Door**.*
Retreat one *fen*—the **Bright Hall Officials**: left, **True Boy of Brightness**; right, **True Official of Brightness**; center, **Mirror Spirit Official**.*
Retreat two *fen*—the **Cavern Chamber**: left, **Elemental Noble**; right, **White Elemental Official**; center, **Yellow Old Master**.*
Retreat three *fen*—the **Dan Field Officials**, also called the **Nirvana Officials**: left, **Upper Elemental Child**; right, **Imperial Official**.*
Retreat four *fen*—the **Flowing Pearl Officials**, where the **True Spirit of Flowing Pearl** resides.*
Retreat five *fen*—the **Jade Emperor’s Officials**, where the **Upper Pure Goddess** resides.*
Above the **Bright Hall**, one *fen*—the **Heavenly Court Officials**, where the **Upper Pure True Woman** resides.*
Above the **Cavern Chamber**, one *fen*—the **Extreme True Officials**, where the **Great Extremes Empress** resides.*
Above the **Dan Field**, one *fen*—the **Mysterious Dan Officials**, where the **Central Yellow Great One True Official** resides.*
Above the **Flowing Pearl**, one *fen*—the **Supreme Imperial Officials**, where the **Supreme True Official** resides.*
Thus it is called the **Soul’s Gate**.

This was what the **Former Sovereign** told me,
*"I"*—the **Exalted Sovereign of Fuxiang** speaking.
Saying: *"My Dao complete, I received the Yellow Court’s transmission from the Former Dao Sovereign."*
Speaking of this Dao’s proximity—it lies within the **Dan Field**, hence *"the Former."*

Left, the **Divine Child** speaks the **Spirit’s Words**,
According to the *Great Cavern Scripture*, left is **Elemental Noble**.
*"Child"* here is interchangeable.
*"Speaking the Spirit’s Words"*—when the heart is singular, the Dao is taught.

Right, the **White Elemental** stands beside,
For the practitioner’s attendant.

The **Bright Hall’s Golden Case and Jade Chamber**—all **Upper Elemental** officials,
Explicated as follows.

The **Upper Pure True Person** stands before me.
The **Upper Elemental** deities—imagined at the Heavenly Court’s threshold.

The **Yellow Robed Child**’s **dan qi** is frequent and unflagging,
Speaking of the **Midheaven Boy** dwelling in **Red City**.
*"Frequent and unflagging"*—**qi** abundant, never exhausted.
Ask: where is it at the brows’ ends?
Before the **Bright Hall**.

Within, the **Day and Moon** stars arrayed in order,
The *Five Long Ritual Decisions* says:
*"The Supreme True Person summons the Five Celestial Stems to the Cavern Chamber; the Southern Pole Sovereign receives the transmission.*
Each night at midnight, sitting outside, store the **West’s Tai Bai** star in the two-brow midpoint,
straight up one *cun*, entering one *cun*—the **Jade Current’s Purple Gate**, left **Sun**, right **Moon**.*
Next, store the **North’s Chen** star in the **Imperial Village’s Mysterious Officials**,
at the hairline’s edge, five *fen* down, straight in one *cun*.
Next, store the **束方’s Suì** star in the **Cavern Gate’s Vermilion Platform**,
the **Cavern Gate’s Vermilion Platform** behind the eyes, one *cun* straight in.
Next, store the **South’s Ying** star in the **Jade Gate’s Flowery Chamber**,
the **Jade Gate’s Flowery Chamber** between the eyes, five *fen* straight in.
Next, store the **Central’s Zheng** star in the **Golden Case’s Yellow Hall, Changgu**,
the **Yellow Hall, Changgu** at the philtrum, two *fen* straight in.
Store them suspended above.

Complete, then **knock the teeth five times**, swallow the saliva **twenty-five passes**,
whisper the incantation: *"High and Pure, Purple Gate—within are the Five Spirits."*
**Jewelous Radiance** spreads its glow, light bursting through the gate.
**Jing** and **qi** accumulate, transforming into an **Old Man**.

Head wrapped in white, face serene,
green robe, crimson skirt.
Right belt with jingling bells, left pendant with **Hu’s True Seal**.
Holding the **Heavenly Rigidity**, scattering the **Vermilion Morning**,
feet stepping on the **Flowery Canopy**, exhaling **Luminous Dew** to refine the body.
The **Three Scenes** preserved—granting me the **True**.

Nurturing the **hun**, restraining the **po**, ascending the **floating, flying** ranks.
This is the practice.

**Inner Symbols** explained.

The **Seven Luminaries** and **Nine Primordial** crown the **Gate of Birth**.
The **Seven Luminaries**, the seven stars,
are paired with the **seven orifices** of humankind.
The **Nine Primordial**, the nine celestial constellations,
are paired with the **nine orifices** of humankind.
To neglect even one is impermissible—thus the **Gate of Birth** is named.

**Chapter Eighteen on the Three Passes**
Within the **Three Passes**, the **jing** and **qi** are profound.
It refers to the **Middle of the Pass (Guān Yuán)**, where men store their **jing**.
According to the following passage, **mouth, hands, and feet** are the **Three Passes**.
Again, **Old Yang Master** designates **Bright Hall (Míng Táng)**, **Cavern Chamber (Dòng Fáng)**, and **Elixir Field (Dān Tián)** as the **Three Passes**.
Both interpretations may be kept in mind.

Within the **Nine Mysteries** lies the **profound and hidden** realm.
The *Upper Clarity Great Cavern Scripture* states:
*"The Three Primordial conceal their transformations—thus they become the Three Officials,
known as **Supreme Clarity (Tài Qīng)**, **Supreme Purity (Tài Sù)**, and **Supreme Harmony (Tài Hé)**.
Three times three makes nine—thus there are the **Three Elixir Fields**,
and again, the **Three Cavern Chambers**,
combining with the **Three Primordial** to form the **Nine Officials**.
Within the **Nine Mysteries**, the **jing** and **qi** are subtle—
thus it is called **Nine Mysteries**,
speaking of the **profound and hidden**, unseen by ordinary eyes.
The **mouth** is the **Heavenly Pass**, the **spirit mechanism** of **jing**.
Words arise from **emotion**—like the **hinge mechanism** of a gate.
The **feet** are the **Earthly Pass**, the **vitality of life’s undertakings**—
speaking of how one’s body moves and sustains life.
**Vegetation** may also be its **threshold**.
The **hands** are the **Human Pass**, grasping **prosperity and decline**.
One’s actions unfold as they will.

**Chapter Nineteen on Obtaining the Chapter**
If one attains the **Three Officials** and preserves the **Mystery Elixir**,
the **Nine Officials** of the **Three Elixir Fields**—
thus it is called **Three Officials Primordial**, referring to the **heart**.
**Preservation and contemplation** dwell within the heart—
thus it points to a singular abode.
The **Supreme Unity** flows its **pearls** into **Kunlun**,
the **Supreme Unity’s pearls**—that is, the **heart’s jing**.
The *Scripture of Cavern Spirits* states:
*"The head is the **Three Platforms Official**,
also **Kunlun**—pointing to the **upper elixir field**.
It also states:
*"The navel is the **Supreme Unity Official**,
also **Kunlun**—pointing to the **lower elixir field**.
Words of the heart preserving the **Three Fields’ Officials**,
their divine forms clearly manifest before one.
This Scripture states:
*'Son, if you wish to cultivate immortality, refine **Kunlun**.'*
**Kunlun** #12—it is a **mountain’s name**.
Within its **twelve layered towers and pavilions**,
the **Throat Dragon** coils.
Twelve rings stacked upon each other,
resting above the heart.
The heart is the **Vermilion Official**,
with the **symbol of towers and pavilions**.
From high to low, all are **True Persons**.
The **upper and lower elixir fields**,
the **twelve layered towers**,
all house **True Spirits**—
as previously described.
The **Jewel Hall** and **Vermilion Residence** encompass the **Mystery Officials**.
**Gaming Pearls** and **Jade Balance** bear the **color of Orchid Breath**,
the **circular rings of the throatbone**,
symbolizing their **turning and revolving**.
**Orchid Breath**—this is their hue.
Gazing upon the **Youthful Boy** seated upon the **盤桓 (Discourse Platform)**,
preserving the vision of the **Scarlet City Youthful Boy** and **True Person of the Elixir**.
**Seated**—speaking of their **tranquil divine forms**.
Ask: *"Whose child am I within my own body?"*
The **Officials** already possess me.
Where does this **True Person** go?
He enters the **Näihuan (Ní Wán)**,
paired with the **Primordial Officials** above and below.
The *Scripture of Cavern Spirits* states:
*"The brain is the **Näihuan Official**.*
Thousands upon thousands, hundreds upon hundreds—
**divine essence** originates from **One**."*

---

**The Generation of All Things**
One generates Two, Two generates Three,
Three gives birth to all things.
Transformation never leaves body and mind.
Layer upon layer, ten upon ten—like towering mountains.
Preserve the vision of myriad deities, stacked and seated.
Mountains—symbolizing their seated forms.

**Cloud Comely and Jade Flower** at the ear gates,
*Cloud Comely, Jade Flower*—names for the hair at the temples.
Speaking of the ears residing within.
The *Scripture* says: *"Transformed spirit is called Azure Flower."*
All that is called *Flower* means to spread and flourish,
Like the blossoms of grasses and trees.

The **Red Sovereign** and **Yellow Sage** share my soul.
The **Red Sovereign**, lord of the Southern Quarter.
The **Yellow Sage**, the Central Yellow Sage.
Soul is the **yang spirit**, *po* the **yin spirit**—
Yin and yang in correspondence, hence *"share my soul."*

The *Book of Supreme Mystery* states:
*"Man has three souls—
First, the **Luminous Spirit**,
Second, the **Fetal Light**,
Third, the **Mysterious Essence**."
Constantly invoking their names
Prevents the soul from leaving the body.

**The Three True Ones** support each other at the **Chamber of the Room**,
Soul, Red Sovereign, and Yellow Sage as the **Three True Ones**—
Speaking of their mutual resonance, sharing the same breath.

**Five Battles** radiant—these are the **Seven Celestial Worthies**,
The **Five Battles**, the thirteenth star of the Northern Dipper.
Also, the *Scripture of Numinous Treasure* speaks of five directional Battles—
The *Cavern Chamber Precepts* say:
*"Preserve the Nine Worthies and Seven Celestial Worthies,
At the start of sleep, after eating—
Recite softly:
*'Five Stars open the passage,
Six Coalescences in the Purple Chamber,
Returning the Worthies, concealing the Dao,
Unlocking the Seven Stars.'"*

The **Soul’s Begetter** is **Dark Father**,
Transforming One into One.
The **Po’s Begetter** is **Dark Mother**,
Transforming Two to form the body.

**Master of My Sinews and Bones** is the **Prince**,
**Provider of My Vital Essence** is **White Origin**.
Eternal life, prolonged vision,
Ascension to the Ten Heavens.

**Sun and Moon** soar through the Six Coalescences,
The Six Coalescences—heaven and earth within.
Preserve within the body the sun, moon, and stars,
All phenomena, as clear as heaven and earth’s expanse.

**Imperial Domain at the Center of Heaven’s Gate**,
Five *cun* above the brow, one *cun* inward—
Also called the **Imperial Domain**.
The upper **Bright Hall** one *cun* is the **Celestial Court**,
The **Celestial Court** is the **Center of Heaven**.
The nose is the **Earth’s Gate** above.
Store the sun, moon, stars, and all deities—
All must reside at the **Gate**,
Below the brow’s hairline, above the nose.

The **Soul-Spirits of the Face** are all preserved.
Inner and outer heart-spirits correspond naturally.

---
**Chapter Twenty: Breathing**

Seek immortality through breathing the **Primordial Qi**,
Probe the **Flying Root**, probe the **Mysterious Luster**,
Swallow the **Five Fangs**, embrace the **Nine Dews**,
Practice the **Fetal Breath**—all are the **Qi of Heaven and Earth, Four Seasons, Five Phases**.

**The Sage and the Prince** stand before,
This is the *Cavern Chamber Precepts*.
The **Cavern Boat Official**—left is **Lord Without Merit**, also called the **Prince**.
The **Sage** directly points to those studying the **Yellow Court**.
Speaking of studying the **Yellow Court Sage**,
Then practicing the *Cavern Chamber Precepts*,
Preserving the vision of the **Prince**—hence *"stand before."*

**Crimson Crow** extends and retracts at the **White Stone Source**,
*Crimson Crow*—symbol of the tongue.
*White Stone*—symbol of the teeth.
*Extend and retract*—guiding the **saliva-essence**.
Speaking of unbroken flow of yin-yang **Qi**—hence *"Source."*

**Condense essence, nurture the fetus, transform the body**,
From whence you originally came.
Retain the fetus, preserve the essence—for eternal life.

The *True Revelations* say:
*The Mouth Precepts of the Upper Pure True Ones*:
*"Those who study the Dao must calm the heart, nurture the spirit,
Take medicines to treat illness,
Fill the brain chamber, prevent the **Dark Essence** from spilling—
Then one may preserve the spirit, refine the **Qi**,
Breathe the **Two Scenes**.
If one repeatedly engages in intercourse,
Leaking **essence** and **liquids**,
Then **Qi** becomes impure, the spirit perishes,
The **Essence-Spirit** is exhausted.
Even if one recites the *Pure Tower Scrolls*, *Golden Books*, or *Great Ultimate*—
How can they avoid non-existence?

Former masters often warned:
*'Students of the Dao—
Each act of intercourse drains one year’s medicinal power,
Two acts drain two years’ power—
Beyond this, all medicinal power is lost.
Thus, true immortals are ever cautious,
For this is the greatest taboo of life itself.'"*

**Three Qi** circulate the **Nine Passages**,
The **Three Qi**—the **Qi of the Three Elixir Fields**.
*Circulate* speaks of their orderly flow.
Harmonizing yin and yang,
The **Four Passes** and **Nine Orifices** flow freely—
No disease remains.

**Abide in Rectitude, Shelter in Oneness**—then fullness comes,
Preserve the **Rectitude**, guard the **Oneness**—
Spirit and **Qi** flourish, thus filling the Six Coalescences,
Riding phenomena and transforming.

**Gazing afar, a single heart like a star-net**,
Preserve the vision of the **Scarlet City Youthful Boy** dwelling within the city,
Like stars reflected in a star-net.

**Beneath the Golden Chamber, nothing may spill**,
The heart resides below the lungs.
The lungs govern **Metal**, their color white—hence *"Golden Chamber."*
Constantly preserving it brings eternal life.

**Extend my white hair, return to infancy**—
An inner matter.
Speaking of youthful visage, never aging.

---
**Chapter Twenty-One: The Jade Chamber**

Within the **Jade Chamber**, eight **Pure Ones** gather,
The **Upper Pure Worthies of the Jade Chamber**—
Symbolizing the skeletal frame.

**Lady of the Näihuan** stands at the center,
The *Scripture* says: *"Within the Cavern Chamber are Father and Mother,
Mother is the Lady, also called the **Dao Mother**."
*Näihuan, Cavern Chamber*—already explained.

**Long Valley** encircles the **Mysterious Domain**,
*Long Valley*—the nose.
*Mysterious Domain*—the kidneys.
*Domain and Environs*—the five **Zang** and six **Fu**.
Speaking of the **Qi** entering and exiting the nose,
Descending to connect with the kidneys,
Circulating around the **Zang** and **Fu**.

The heart resides in the **Scarlet City**—
Preserve inner and outer visions.
The **Outer Environs** are called the **Domain**.
Thus, a symbolic instruction.

**Six Dragons** scatter and fly—difficult to distinguish.
Speaking of the **Qi** of the six **Fu**,
Subtle and hidden—difficult to discern,
Must be carefully preserved.

**Eternal Life demands utmost caution in the Chamber**—
Loss of **Qi**, leakage of **liquids**,
Exhaustion of the body and brain—
Even if supplemented with **medicinal elixirs**,
Yet drained through the **tail**—
One must be ever vigilant.

Why does death weep the spirit?
Through recklessness in the **Chamber**—
injuring **essence**, losing clarity—
thus the spirit weeps.

Sudden disaster in the **Land of Calamity**—
the **Three Spirits** perish.
The **Land of Calamity**, the realm of death.
The **Three Spirits**, the **Three Souls**—
**Luminous Soul**, **Fetal Light**, **Gloomy Essence**.
The **Lost**, the departed.

Yet one must **inhale** and **retain the child’s essence**,
practice **breathing and exhalation**, **close the Chamber** to preserve **semen**.

The **inch-fields, foot-estates** govern life—
the **Three Dantians’ domains**, each a square inch.
By preserving the **Dantians’ methods**, life is regulated.

The **Scripture** says: *"Inch-fields, foot-estates."*
The **sixteen-foot-estate** refers to the face.
If one **decides to spill the sea** with reckless excess—
**Chamber indulgence**, unaware of restraint—
the leaf falls, the tree withers, losing its verdant hue—
symbolizing death, lifelessness.
**Qi** lost, **fluids** leaked—no longer one’s own form.
The *Sutra of the Immortals* states:
*"Close the Chamber, refine the fluids—
speak not much, spit not far.*
To do otherwise is to perish.

**Exclusively closing** to **ward off the scene** brings eternal peace—
**suppressing desire**, preserving the **sunlight’s service**.
As *Laozi* says:
*"The skilled closer needs no lock—
yet cannot be opened."*

Again, in the *Upper Clarity Purple Text of the Spiritual Scriptures*,
there is the **method of exploring the flying root**—
at dawn, bind and face the sun,
**knock the teeth nine times**,
then in secret, **incant the sun’s soul** with the **Five Emperors’ names of the Sun’s Core**:
*"Sun-Soul, Pearl, Radiance, Illumination, Concealment,
Green Reflection, Crimson Echo, Azure Child, Mysterious Flame, Fleeting Symbol."*
After chanting these sixteen characters,
**close the eyes, grip firmly**,
and **visualize the five-colored flowing clouds** approaching to envelop the body.
Thus, the **sunlight and clouds** enter the mouth—
this is called the **"Sun’s Radiance: Flying Root, Jade Embryo."**
The **Jade Embryo** is the **Water Mother**.
Facing the sun, **swallow the clouds forty-five times**,
then **swallow saliva nine times**.

**Preserve my **Dantian’s** three wondrous spirits**—
the **Dantian**, the **Upper Dantian**.

The *Great Cavern Scripture* says:
*"When the Three Primordials conceal their transformations,
the Three Officials are formed."*

The **Three Qi** circulate through the **Nine Passages**—
the **Three Qi** of the **Three Dantians**.
**Circulating right**, in orderly sequence—
harmonizing **yin** and **yang**,
the **Four Gates** and **Nine Orifices** flow clear,
unobstructed, free of illness.

**Abiding in Oneness, discarding excess**, brings fullness—
**preserving the True**, **nurturing the One**,
spirit and **qi** flourish—
thus filling the **Six Extremes**, transforming with all things.

**Gazing afar**, the **One Heart** like stars through silk—
**visualizing the Vermilion City’s child** residing within,
as stars reflected in a **wheel’s hub**.

Beneath the **Golden Chamber**, nothing may be spilled—
the **heart** resides below the **lungs**.
The **lungs** govern **Metal**, their hue **white**—
thus the **Golden Chamber**.
To always preserve it brings **eternal life**.

**Extend my white hair**, returning to infancy—
an inner affair—
**youthful visage**, never aging.

**Chapter Twenty-One: The Jade Chamber**
Within the **Jade Chamber**, the **Eight Purities** gather—
the **Upper Primordial’s Pure and True Jade Chamber**,
a **bone’s** symbolic form.

The **Dantian Lady** stands at its center.
The **Scripture** says:
*"In the Cavern Chamber are father and mother—*
the **Mother**, the **Lady**, also called the **Dao-Mother**."
The **Dantian**, the **Cavern Chamber**, already explained.

The **Long Valley** encircles the **Mysterious Domain**—
the **Long Valley**, the **nose**.
The **Mysterious Domain**, the **kidneys**.
The **Environs**, the **Five Zang and Six Fu**.
Speaking of the **qi** entering and exiting the nose,
descending to connect with the kidneys,
circulating around the **Zang and Fu**.

The **heart** resides in the **Scarlet City**—
**visualize inner and outer**.
The **Outer Environs** are called the **Domain**.
Thus, a symbolic instruction.

The **Six Dragons** scatter and fly—difficult to distinguish.
Speaking of the **Six Fu’s qi**,
subtle and hidden—difficult to discern,
must be carefully preserved.

**Eternal Life demands utmost caution in the Chamber**—
**Qi** lost, **fluids** leaked,
body and brain exhausted—
even if supplemented with **medicinal elixirs**,
yet drained through the **tail**—
one must be ever vigilant.

Why does death weep the spirit?
Through recklessness in the **Chamber**—
injuring **essence**, losing clarity—
thus the spirit weeps.

Sudden disaster in the **Land of Calamity**—
the **Three Spirits** perish.

「When the sun first rises, always practice the *Nine Strikes of the Teeth* to complete the rite, then recite the **Yin Incantation** to the **Sun-Spirit** with the five characters of **Midday**: *"珠景照韬绿映回霞赤童玄炎"*—the **Sun-Spirit’s** radiant light illuminates the **Scarlet City**, casting emerald reflections and crimson clouds, the **Six Dragons** soaring.

After completing the incantation, close your eyes and hold firm, nurturing the **Five Colored Flows** and **Crimson Clouds** to merge with your body. Then, swallow the sunlight and crimson clouds into your mouth, calling it the **"Sunlight Flying to the Root, the Jade Embryo."** The **Jade Embryo** is the **Water Mother**. Swallow the **Crimson Clouds** forty-five times, then also pass saliva nine times through the throat.

---

**Preserve my *Níwán* (泥丸) and the *Three Strange Spirits* (三奇灵).**
The *Níwán* is the **Upper Elixir Field** (上丹田). The *Da Dòng Jīng* (《大洞经》) states: *"When the Three Primordials (三元) refine in seclusion, they become the Three Officials (三官)."*

The **Three Strange Spirits** (三奇灵) are:
1. The **Spirits of the Three Pure Ones** (太清之中三君),
2. The **Deities of the Three Elixir Fields** (三丹田之神),
3. The **Divine Records’ Spirits** (符籍之神).

**Calmly and quietly, close your eyes to inner illumination**—
this refers to **meditating on the Three Elixir Fields** as previously described.

**Things do not disturb the *Tài* (泰) and remain balanced;**
**practice the true Dao without deviation,**
**and malevolent influences will not intrude.**

**Replete with vitality, no longer old yet youthful again,**
**wild beasts dare not approach,**
**and ravenous crows dare not swoop.**
The **old become strong, the sick regain vigor.**

**Replete with vitality (殷矣), yet not engaging in worldly affairs (匪事),**
**the body remains firm and resilient (老复丁).**

**Refine the *Yùshū* (玉书) into the **Upper Pure Realm** (上清).**
**Concentrate on the inner landscape,**
**and you shall gain the **Way of the Immortal** (仙道).

**Always recite the *Second Twenty-Two* (章第二十二) and**
**meditate on the **Three Chambers** (三房) to achieve mutual penetration.**
The **Three Chambers** are the **Chambers of the Hall of Light (明堂), the Cave Chamber (洞房), and the Elixir Field (丹田).**
They connect with the **Flowing Pearl (流珠), Jade Emperor (玉帝), Celestial Court (天庭), Supreme Truth (极真), Mystic Elixir (玄丹), Níwán (泥丸), and the Great Sovereign (太皇)**—
**all harmonize above, below, left, and right.**

**Understanding the vision sees no distinction between inner and outer;**
**meditating on the Elixir Field (丹田),**
**three times three makes nine (三三如九),**
**uniting into one (合为一),**
**illuminating and penetrating with clarity—**
**no longer any inner or outer.**

**Rinsing and storing the **Five Teeth’s qi** (五牙) prevents hunger and thirst.**
The *Língbǎo* (《灵宝》) contains a method of **serving and refining the Five Teeth’s qi.**
The **Five Teeth’s qi** are the **vital breaths of the Five Phases (五行),**
**aligned with the **original essences of the Zang** (五脏元精).
The **classic** states:
*"On the day of the **Spring Equinox** (立春), when the geese’s cry resounds,*
**enter your chamber facing east, bow nine times,*
**sit upright, and strike your teeth nine times.**
**Meditate on the **Nine Thousand Million Celestial Officials** (九千万人) of **Bùfāng Ānbǎohuálín Qīnglíng Shǐlǎo Dìjūn** (束方安宝华林青灵始老帝君),*
**descending into your room in dense clouds,*
**covering your body as if with mist,*
**entering through your mouth and descending straight to the liver.*
**Incantation:**
*'Nine Breaths of the Celestial Officials of the **Azure Sky’s Primordial Sovereign** (青天元始上精皇老尊神),*
**clad in green feathered robes,*
**commanding the **Celestial Officials** (天官),*
**illuminating the **Year Star** (岁星),*
**scattering brilliance and spreading fragrance,*
**nourishing my form.*
**I consume the **morning dew** (朝霞),*
**refining the **Wood Essence** (木精).*
**I firmly cultivate the **Azure Tooth’s qi** (青牙),*
**preserving and stabilizing the **decaying and withering** (朽零).*
**The liver is filled to capacity,*
**the **Jade Cauldrons** (玉芝) grow spontaneously,*
**prolonging life and halting aging,*
**restoring the complexion to childlike radiance.*
**The Five Breaths blend harmoniously,*
**the heavens and earth merge eternally.'*

**Afterward, draw the **Azure Breath** (青气) nine times through the throat,*
**then refine the **Crimson Scripture of Jade Text** (赤书玉文十二字).**
**The remaining methods for the **Southern, Western, Northern, and Central Directions** (南方、西方、北方、中央)**
**follow the *Língbǎo* (《灵宝》) method of serving and refining the Five Teeth’s qi.**

**The **Divine Light** (神华) holds the **Six Ding** (六丁) in reverence.**
The **Divine Light** (神华), as the *Yù Lì Jīng* (《玉历经》) states,
**is the **Jade Maiden of the Great Yin’s Mystic Light** (太阴玄光玉女),**
**the **Mother of the Dao** (道之母).
**She wears a **Five-Colored Vermilion Robe** (五色朱衣),**
**above the **spleen** (脾腑), beneath the **Yellow Cloud Canopy** (黄云华盖).**

The **Six Ding** (六丁) are the **Six Ding Yin Spirits of the Jade Maiden** (六丁阴神玉女).
The *Lǎojūn Liùjiǎ Fú Tú* (《老君六甲符图》) states:
**The *Dingmǎo* (丁卯) Spirit oversees **Mǎ Qīng** (马卿) and the Jade Maiden, who **controls the sun’s movement** (足日之).**
**The *Dīngchǒu* (丁丑) Spirit oversees **Zhào Zǐ** (赵子) and the Jade Maiden, who **harmonizes the breath** (顺气).**
**The *Dīnghài* (丁亥) Spirit oversees **Zhāng Wéntōng** (张文通) and the Jade Maiden, who **is named *Cáo Piāo* (曹漂) and governs the liver** (之).**
**The *Dīngyǒu* (丁酉) Spirit oversees **Zāng Wén Gōng** (臧文公) and the Jade Maiden, who **brings joy** (得喜).**
**The *Dīngwèi* (丁未) Spirit oversees **Shí Shù** (石叔) and the Jade Maiden, who **lodges in defense** (寄防).**
**The *Dīngjǐ* (丁巳) Spirit oversees **Cuī Jù Gōng** (崔巨卿) and the Jade Maiden, who **opens the heart** (开心之).**

**When the method of refining the **Root’s Flight** (飞根) and**
**storing the **Five Teeth’s qi** (五牙) is perfected,*
**you shall command the **Six Ding Spirits** (六丁之神).**

**Vigilantly guard the **Chamber of Essence** (精室),**
**never leaking recklessly.**

The **Chamber of Essence** (精室) refers to the **Three Elixir Fields** (三丹田).
Above and below, they are **interconnected yet unbroken** (上下资连而不绝),
and their governance lies in the **heart** (心).
The **heart** (心) is the **Middle Elixir Field** (中丹田),
the source of **urgency and calm** (缓急之所由),
and the **root of true and false** (真妄之根本).
To **seal and treasure it** (闭而宝之) is to **prolong life** (可长活).
It is the consequence of **accumulating essence** (积精之所致).
Initially, it arises from within the **form** (形) without broadness (初不阔),
**refining the heart to regulate the qi** (调心使气),
subtle and formless (微妙无形).
The **Three Palaces** (三宫) lie close within the **easy-to-conceal grasp** (易隐括).
That is, the **Three Elixir Fields’ true officials** (三丹田真官) are near the body,
**concealing and gathering essence-qi** (隐括精气),
ever maintaining the **heart as sovereign ruler** (常以心为君主).

The **void and stillness of the Primordial Origin** (虚元寂寂) dwells in the **emptiness of the heavens** (空中素#19),
an **external analogy** (外指事).
"**Void**" (素) has two interpretations:
To **prevent the form from being soiled** (使形如是不当污),
or to **keep the form light and cool** (使形轻冷),
as though **hanging unadorned silk in the sky** (如悬缣素於空中).
It is also said: **within the body, emptiness and stillness are natural** (身中空虚),
making it like **a vessel’s lacquered void** (虚静当然，如器之漆素).
**Soiling** (污) means **having any affairs** (谓有其事).

The **Nine Chambers’ upright void** (九室正虚) is the **abode of the Spirit of Clarity** (神明舍).
The **Nine Chambers** (九室) refer to the **Nine Officials’ Chambers within the head** (头中九官之室)
and the **Nine Orifices of the body** (人之九窍).
To **honor the upper officials** (使上官荣华)
and **upright the Nine Passages** (九康真正) is to **unite all spirits** (则众神之所止合).

The *Tóngshén Jīng* (洞神经) states:
**"Heaven has Nine Stars** (天有九星), two hidden, hence called Nine Heavens (故称九天).
**Earth has Nine Officials** (地有九官), hence called Nine Earths (故称九地).
**Man has Nine Orifices** (人有九窍), hence called Nine Births (故称九生),
speaking of the **origins through which man is born** (言人所由而生)."

**Cultivate and reflect on the hundred thoughts** (存思百念),
**observing the nodes and measures** (视节度):
To **cultivate and reflect within the body on the hundred spirits** (存念身中百神),
**inhale and exhale above and below** (呼吸上下),
just as the methods prescribe (一如科法).
The text says: **"Thousands upon thousands, hundreds upon hundreds like layered mountains** (千千百百似重山),
all are **spirit-forms** (皆神象)."

**Refine the Six Palaces** (六府修治) and **do not let them remain stagnant** (勿令故).
According to the *Tóngshén Jīng* (洞神经):
The **Six Palaces** (六府) are:
The **lung as the Jade Hall Official, Minister of State** (肺为玉堂官尚书府),
the **heart as the Vermilion Official, Palace of Original Yang** (心为绛官元阳府),
the **liver as the Cool and Pure Official, Blue Gallery Palace** (肝为清泠官兰台府),
the **gallbladder as the Purple Darkness Official, Palace of the Boundless** (胆为紫微官无极府),
the **kidneys as the Profound Bright Official, Palace of Great Harmony** (肾为幽昌官太和府),
and the **spleen as the Central Yellow Official, Palace of Great Purity** (脾为中黄官太素府),
**distinct from the common Six Palaces** (异於常六府).

Then **ascend in soaring flight along the Heavenly Path** (行自翱翔入天路).
That is, **to transcend and become immortal** (谓升仙羽化).

**Chapter Twenty-Third: Nurturing Life**
The Dao/Way of nurturing life is simple and unburdened—
**effortless and pure**, **frugal yet steadfast in will**.
Only cultivate the *Dòngxuān* and the *Yùpiān*—
The *Dòngxuān* refers to the *Dòngxuān Língbǎo* (洞玄灵宝).
The *Yùpiān* is the **True Scripture**, that is, the **#20 *Huángtíng*** (黄庭).

**Simultaneously practice the Eight Celestial Sceneries within the form** (兼行形中八景神),
as the *Yùhuì Jīng* (玉讳经) states:
The **five viscera house the Eight Trigrams’ Heavenly Deities and Celestial Guards** (五脏有八卦天神宿卫).
**The Eight Celestial Envoys** (太一八使者) govern the **Eight Solar Nodes** (八节日).
The **Eight Trigrams united with the Celestial Sovereign form the Nine Officials** (八卦合太一为九官).
Beyond the Eight Trigrams lie the **Twelve Towers** (八卦外有十二楼), which are the **throats** (楼谓喉咙也).

The **umbilicus is the Celestial Sovereign’s Lord** (脐中为太一君), presiding over **one’s vital mandate** (主人之命也);
it is also called the **#21 *Tàijí*** (太极), **#21 *Tàiyuān*** (太渊), **#21 *Kūnlún*** (昆仑), and **#22 *Chíqū*** (持躯),
governing the **twelve thousand deities within the body** (主身中万二千神也).
The **Twenty-Four True Ones emerge naturally** (二十四真出自然),
for **Heaven possesses the Twenty-Four True Qi** (天有二#23十四真气), and so too does the human body.
Moreover, the **Three Fields of Elixir** (三丹田) each contain **three groups of Eight, totaling Twenty-Four True Persons** (三八二十四真人),
all manifestations of **the flourishing of the Dao/Way of Nature** (皆自然之道熙也).

**Lofty and effortless, the spirit-soul rests in peace** (高拱无为魂魄安),
practicing **standing forgetfulness and sitting forgetfulness** (行忘坐忘),
**detaching from form and abandoning wisdom** (离形去智).
When **pure and still, the spirit manifests and speaks with me** (清静神见与我言),
then **one can be pure and still, and the heart-spirit naturally manifests** (能清能静，则心神自见).
The **Celestial Sovereign’s True Scripture** (几览无外而与己言) is called the **#21 *Huángtíng Zhēnrén*** (黄庭真人).
It dwells **within the purple chamber and brocade curtain** (安在紫房帏幕间),
the **#21 *Zǐfáng Zhàngmù*** (紫房幛幕), also known as the **#21 *Zǎngguān*** (绛官),
the place where **the Red City’s child** (赤城中童子) resides.
**Retain and ponder the heart-spirit** (存思心神), and its form is as described.
**Stand or sit outside the chamber for three to five breaths** (立坐室外三五玄).

「It is said that the Eight Scenes and the Twenty-Four True Persons’ **qi** (神气) nurture and protect the human body,
then the **Three Fields and Five Viscera’s true qi** (三田五藏真气) will be harmonized and softened,
and there will be no calamity or illness.

Burn incense and extend your hands before the **Jade Flower** (玉华),
the **Jade Flower**, that is, before the **Flower Canopy** (华盖) of the **Celestial Vertex** (天庭),
where the **brow meets the sky** (眉问天庭).
The **origin of the hundred spirits** (百神之宗) and the **True Person’s dwelling** (真人之窟宅)
should be contemplated while gazing upward.

Together enter the **Great Chamber** (太室),
pass through the **Whirling Pivot Gate** (玑门).
The *Tunnel Chamber Scripture* (《洞房经》) states:
The **Celestial Realm** (天) has the **Great Chamber** (太室),
the **Jade Chamber** (玉房), and the **Cloud Court** (云庭).
The **Cloud Court** (云庭) is where the **Central Yellow Sovereign** (中央黄老君) resides.
The **Jade Chamber** (玉房), also called the **Purple Chamber** (紫房) and the **Crimson Official** (绛官),
is commonly named the **Bright Hall** (明堂).
Above it is the **Flower Canopy** (华盖),
binding the **Western Official’s Tunnel** (西官洞) to communicate with the **left and right Yellow Courts** (左右黄庭) within.
The human body possesses these as well, as described above.

The **Whirling Pivot** (漩玑) is the name of the **central pivot** (中枢).
**Highly refine and cultivate serene stillness** (高研恬淡) in the **Dao’s garden** (道之园),
refining essence and cultivating serene stillness (研精恬淡),
so that **true qi may come to play** (真气来游).
**Inwardly gaze into the hidden pathways** (内视密陌),
completely perceiving the **True** (真).
Enter stillness and ponder deeply,
and the hundred spirits will gather in solemn array (百神森森).
The **True Person dwells within you** (真人在己),
do not seek outside neighbors.

The *Jade Calendar Scripture* (《玉历经》) states:
The **Laozi** (老子) is the **"spirit-soul of Heaven and Earth** (天地之魂),
the **"Sovereign of Nature"** (自然之君),
constantly attending the **Dao Sovereign** (道君) at his side.
The human body fully possesses this.
Why seek far for causes and conditions?

The *Laozi* (《老子》) says:
**"Words do not travel far."** (言不远也)
**"The Great Dao is boundless** (大道泛兮),
**and may be found to the left and right."** (其可左右)

*Yellow Court Inner Landscape Jade Classic Annotation, Volume 6, Liangqiuzi’s Annotation* (黄庭内景玉经注卷下 梁丘子注)».

**Hidden Landscape Chapter Twenty-Four**
Hidden Landscape Conceals Form, Distinct from the World
Those who cultivate the Dao/Way contain light and conceal radiance,
Eradicating ambition and concealing their essence.

Nurturing qi and refining essence, their lips like vermilion,
Their flesh like ice and snow, graceful as a maiden.

Bearing the nature of life, guarding the primal void,
In emptiness and stillness, serene and unconcerned, effortless and tranquil.
Their names enter the *Upper Purity Register of the Dead*—exempted,
Earning a place among the True Ones, listed in the *Mysterious Names*.

The joys of the Three Spirits arise from seclusion.
To govern the body without action brings spiritual delight;
To govern the realm without affairs brings peace to the people.

The Three Spirits—these are the spirits of the **#1** *Cinnabar Field*.

Swiftly, they roam without a trace of sorrow—*borrowed* (倏) means swift and sudden.
Below, it reads: *"Driving the swift, they meet the living at the boundless gathering."*
Some say *borrowed* (倏) is the name of a dragon.
Without a trace of sorrow means *suspended resolution* (悬解).

In one complete set of feathered robes, the Eight Winds drive forward—
The Eight Winds are the winds of the Four Directions, scouting and clearing the path ahead.
Feathered robes are the garments of the immortals.
According to *The Precious Texts of Upper Purity*, immortals wear five-colored feathered garments.
Again, in *The Flying Flight Feather Classic*, it is said:
*The True One of the Supreme Unity wears nine-colored flying cloud feathered robes*—
All are the attire of the gods and immortals.

Guiding the three pure [vehicles], they ride the morning mists—
An external reference.
The Three Clouds and Nine Mists are what the gods and immortals ride upon.

The Golden Assembly stands erect, following the Jade Carriage—
*The Primordial Register Scripture* states:
*The Nine Heavenly Dark Gods of Upper Purity, the Eight Saints, verify the driving of the Nine Phoenix Dragon Chariots.*
The Jade Carriage and Golden Pen are the apparel and instruments of the immortals.

Why do you not ascend the mountains to recite my scripture?
The scripture is the *Yellow Court Classic*.

The True Ones’ abode is deep and secluded—
Mountains are profound and hidden.
Entering the mountains is not difficult, yet one hesitates—
Emotions and aspirations are unrefined.
The world’s questions swirl like foul silk.

Swiftly, one must avoid the world’s entanglements.

**Five Phases Chapter Twenty-Five**
The Five Phases cyclically transform and return.

The Five Phases—namely Water, Fire, Metal, Wood, and Earth—
**Cyclic Generation:** Water begets Wood, Wood begets Fire, Fire begets Earth, Earth begets Metal, Metal begets Water, and Water again begets Wood, thus cycling endlessly.
**Mutual Conquest:** Water conquers Fire, Fire conquers Metal, Metal conquers Wood, Wood conquers Earth, Earth conquers Water, and Water again conquers Fire, thus completing the Way of mutual generation and conquest.

**Returning to Unity:** Water is the origin of the Five Phases, the root of all things. *The Laozi* states:
*"The Dao generates the One, the One generates the Two, the Two generates the Three, and the Three generates all things."*
*The Yijing* speaks of the *Taiji*, which gives rise to the Two Complementaries.
The *Taiji* is the One; the Two Complementaries are Heaven and Earth.
Heaven and Earth generate all things, and all things ultimately return to the One.
The One is without duality—all things arise from it, and thus it is said they return to Unity.

**The Triple-Five Convergence:** Three threes combine to form nine nines.
*The Miao Zhen Jing* says:
The Three—heavenly as Sun, Moon, and Stars (the Three Lights); earthly as Pearl, Jade, and Gold (the Three Treasures); human as Ear, Nose, and Mouth (the Three Orifices)—are the essence of life.
Heaven, Earth, and Man each encompass the Five, hence the Triple-Five, their eternal refinement.
Their convergence governs the Nine Officials.
The Triple-Five harmonizes all beings, regulates yin-yang transformation, sustains Heaven and Earth, illuminates the Four Seas, commands wind, rain, thunder, and lightning, and governs the seasons—spring, autumn, winter, summer, cold, heat, warmth, and chill, as well as the clear and turbid *qi*. No living thing can exist without the Triple-Five.
Thus it is said: *"The Dao of Heaven is near; the Triple-Five returns in cycles."*

The Triple-Five are the pivotal axis of Heaven and Earth, the crucial convergence of the Six Extremes, and the rhythmic *qi* of the Nine Officials—eighty-one nines forming a complete cycle.

**Hidden Earth Returning to the Eight Arts:**
Within the Nine Officials lies the method of hidden retreat and transformation—*The Taishang Baxu Benchen Yin Shu* is called the *Eight Branches*.
*The Taimi Baxu Yan* states:
Within the *Taimi* are the Three Lords: the First, the *Taihuang Jun*; the Second, the *Tianhuang Jun*; the Third, the *Huanglao Jun*.
The Three Primordial *qi* coalesce into refined essence, entering and exiting the Upper Purity *Taosu* Palace. By cultivating contemplation (*cunsi*), one attains longevity.

**The Hidden Pass of the Ox and the Mysterious Gate:**
The *Funu* is the symbol of the kidneys.
The kidneys are the Hidden Gate.
*The Zhonghuang Jing* says:
The left kidney is the *Xuanzuo Jun*, the right kidney is the *Xuanyuan Jun*.
The *Luopin Lie* appears through contemplation.

**The Three Clarities Emerge at the Threshold of Life and Death:**
The Three Clarities of Heaven are Sun, Moon, and Stars;
The Three Clarities of Man are Ear, Eye, and Mouth;
The Three Clarities of Earth are Text, Patterns, and Splendor—
These mark the threshold of life and death.
*Jie* means "node."

**The Soul’s Chamber and the Celestial Symbols of the Dipper:**
Contemplate the Three Lights within the Soul’s Chamber.
The Soul’s Chamber and the *Ming Tang* have been explained above.

**The Father is the *Nihuan*, the Mother is the *Ci Yi*:**
Within the *Ming Tang* are Lord and Subject; within the Soul’s Chamber are Husband and Wife; within the *Dantian* are Father and Mother.
*Nihuan* is the name of the brain spirit.
*The Laozi* says: *"Know the male, hold fast to the female."*
The female is the *wuwei* One.

**The Three Clarities Illuminating the Chamber of the One:**

The Three Lights radiantly enter the Chamber of the One.
The Four Clarities spread in all directions.
One who can preserve the Mysterious True Self shall attain all things—
*The Zhuangzi* says: *"Unified in the One, all things are accomplished."*¹

The vital essence of the single body must never be lost.
Ever keep it in mind, not for a single moment.

**Chapter Twenty-Six: High Flight**

High Flight follows the Sun and Moon—my Dao/Way ascends.
I, the Dao/Way, am the Celestial Sovereign.
*The Upper Clarity Purple Text: Method of Swallowing Solar Qi*, also called *The Scripture of the Golden Essence, Azure Elixir, and the Stone’s Mirror of the Mother’s Jade Embryo*.²

Its method is: at dawn, facing east, strike teeth nine times to awaken.
When done, softly chant the names of the Solar Spirit and the Five Emperors within the Sun:
*"Solar Spirit—Jewel, Mirror, Illumination, Concealment, Verdant, Echoing, Crimson, Infant, Mysterious Flame, Fleeting Symbol."*
Having chanted these sixteen characters, close eyes and grasp firmly,
Preserving the five-colored flowing light to envelop the body—
Thus the Sun’s light and the flowing light together enter the mouth.

Again, *The Upper Clarity Purple Text* contains the method of Swallowing Lunar Essence:
At moonrise, facing west, strike teeth ten times,
Softly chant the names of the Lunar Spirit and the Five Ladies within the Moon:
*"Lunar Spirit—Warmth, Gentle Breeze, Fragrance, Luster, Veiled, Graceful, Mysterious, Resplendent, Lingering, Pure, Golden, Clear, Radiant, Jade, Embryo, Azure, Congealed, Court’s Inner Mirror."*
³ Having chanted these twenty-four characters, close eyes and grasp firmly,
Preserving the five-colored essence-light of the Moon to enter the mouth—
And within the light, there is a yellow qi, vast as a child’s head,
Called *Flying Yellow*—the essence of the Moon’s Jade Embryo.

One who practices this Dao/Way shall High Flight with the Sun and Moon and become a transcendent.

**Idyllic Compliance and Auspicious Binding Preserve the Form:**
Idyllic Compliance is the High Flight of the Sun.
Auspicious Binding is the High Flight of the Moon.
Like sounds resonate, like qi seeks—
Thus the two transcendents come to preserve and uphold.

Then one beholds the Venerable of Azure Clarity and the Void Primordial,
Ascending to the Three Clarities’ summit, merging with the Dao/Way.

This can restore youth and replenish the brain’s vitality.
The spirit and shadow return to infancy—
One attains the True Person.

**Mouth Holding the Sacred Flame and the Five Sovereigns,**
The mouth emits five-colored clouds of light,
Radiant in all directions,
And plays with the Five Sovereigns’ Venerable Lord across the Six Extremes.⁴

**Waist Belted with the Tiger’s Scroll and Golden Pendant,**
The attire of the transcendent.
*The Nine True Scripture* says:
The Yellow Sovereign of the Central Peak wears the Dragon’s Mysterious Spirit Tiger’s Scroll,
A waist belt with golden bells,
Holds the purple-haired banner,
And bears the talisman and scroll.

**Riding the Swift to Attend the Birth Feast and Bind the Yellow Cloud.**
Swift, meaning "sudden efficacy"—
To ride the wind-qi and depart in an instant.⁵

「Some say: *Xióngxiào* (倏效) is the name of a dragon.
*Shùméng* (束蒙) refers to the mountain realm of the *Shùhǎi* (束海) Immortals.
The method of *Jiēshēng* (接生) aligns with the vital *qi* of birth—
One attains serene ease and wanders there.

**Chapter Twenty-Seven: Refining the Spirit and Shadow of the Primordial Void**
Refining the spirit and shadow of the Primordial Void,
One uses the refining to attain the One,
The One refined to merge with the One.
The One as a phenomenon is beyond mortal sight—
The One is the designation of the undivided.
With a tranquil mind, one attains it,
Knowing it attained yet unseen.

Only when reaching the utmost truth does one look back upon the world,
Fulfilling the resolve of the True One,
The One returns to its own.
Most forbidden is the *qi* of death and all filth,
Such as gathering *fēidān* (飞丹) elixirs, practicing *shǔqì* (吞霞) inhalation, or engaging in *shìqì* (食气) breathwork—
All these are forbidden from exposure to the dead or unclean burial rites,
A shared taboo among those who uphold *wèishēng* (卫生) health.

Yet the highest Dao is boundless and empty,
Fundamentally free from cold and filth.
Before attaining the True Way,
Cold and filth differ greatly.
Unequal yet distinct,
Then contradictions arise within,
Life and death manifest externally—
Thus, the cold and pure are the birth of vitality,
The turbid and impure are the birth of death.
Hence, these are the things forbidden in nurturing life.

The Six Spirits converge in the Void for a feast of ease.
The Six *Jiǎ* (甲), Six *Dīng* (丁), and Six *Fǔ* (府) deities dwell within the body,
And when the body’s void is tranquil, one attains serene ease and comfort,
Otherwise, sorrow and distress arise.

**Cultivating the Pearl to Nourish the Spirit’s Root**
The Pearl is formed—
Saliva gathered in succession like beads of jade.
Conserve the essence—
Do not wastefully emit.
The Spirit’s Root is the physical form itself.
As the spirit relates to the body,
So the sovereign relates to the state and its people.
The people rely on the sovereign for life,
The sovereign relies on the people as foundation,
Mutually sustaining each other as the vital principle of existence and cultivation.

**Jade Barriers and Golden Keys Ever Complete and Firm**
As *Lǎozǐ* (老子) says:
*"The adept at sealing is unopened even by the mightiest force."*
Keys are the locks of sealing.
Some say, *"Smile"* is also a key.
Bending the tongue to consume *tāijīn* (胎津),
Guiding saliva to nourish the *tāixiān* (胎仙) embryo,
Hence called *tāijīn*—
This enables me to complete the refining and attain *fēixiān* (飞仙) transcendence.
The result of diligent practice and sincere devotion.

**Chapter Twenty-Eight: The Immortal’s Way**
The Immortal’s Daoist path is not inherently divine—
It is attained through cultivation and study.
Accumulating essence and amassing *qi* to forge the True.

*"With foundation, or without"*—this phrase is omitted in the following.

**The Yellow Boy’s Marvelous Sound is Hard to Hear**
The Yellow Boy (黄童), the Yellow Court Sage (黄庭真人), also called the Red City Boy (赤城童子),
Whose marvelous sound refers to the Yellow Court Dao’s (黄庭道) exquisite resonance.
The *Jade Scripture with Crimson Slips* bears the text of the Red Elixir.

The *Yellow Court Scripture* (《黄庭经》), also called *The Golden Scripture of the Supreme Emperor* (《太帝金书》) or *The Jade Chapters of Bundled Splendor* (《束华玉篇》),
Has the inscription: *"True Person’s Perk"* (真人巾) and *"Golden Perk"* (金巾).
The True Person is the Yellow Boy.
Golden is white, located in the West, governing the lungs.
The lungs are white, residing above the heart, hence called *perk* (巾).
The *Nine True Scripture* (《九真经》) states:
The Green Sovereign wears robes of green jade brocade,
A flying skirt of azure clouds,
A crown of *Fúzhī* (扶芝) elixir,
And a *perk* of golden white (金巾).
Again, the *Primordial Yang Sage* (元阳子) says:
The True Person leans upon *Wǔ* (午), the *Jū* (倨) child,
Steps upon *Mǎo* (卯), wears *Yǒu* (酉).
*Yǒu* is gold.
Carrying armor and holding talismans to open the Seven Gates,
The *Lǎozǐ’s Six Jiǎ Threefold Talismans* (《老子六甲三部符》) say:
*Jiǎzǐ* (甲子) deity—*Shénwáng* (神王) Wénqīng (文卿),
*Jiǎxū* (甲戌) deity—*Shénchén* (神辰) Zǐjiāng (子江),
*Jiǎshēn* (甲申) deity—*Shénhù* (神扈) Wéncháng (文长),
*Jiǎwǔ* (甲午) deity—*Shénwèi* (神卫) Shàngqīng (上卿),
*Jiǎchén* (甲辰) deity—*Shénmèng* (神孟) Fēiqīng (非卿),
*Jiǎyín* (甲寅) deity—*Shénmíng* (神明) Wénzhāng (文章).
Preserving the names of the Six *Jiǎ* deities,
The Seven Orifices open freely,
Dispelling all illnesses.

The talismans and diagrams of the Fire Soldiers guard the Spirit Gates.
The *Red Chapter* (《赤章》) and *Severing Heresy Scroll* (《斩邪录》)
Both command the Fire Soldiers of the Three Heavens and Five Phases.
Again, the *Spirit of the Luminous Guard Incantation* (《卫灵神咒》) says:
The Southern Red Heaven (南方丹天), where the Three *Xī* (熙) radiate light,
The *Yíngxīng* (荧星) revolve like torches,
Piercingly illuminating the Great Sun (太阳);
Above, the *Chìjīng* (赤精) *Kāimíng* (开明) *Língtóng* (灵童) presides,
Commanding the Fire Soldiers,
Guarding the Three Officials (三官).
This refers to the Fire Soldiers of the Three Heavens and Five Phases.

Talismans are those that display:
The Eight Pure Ones and Six Spirits,
Yang Essence and Jade Embryo,
Refined Immortal Yin Essence,
Ascending *Fēijǐng* (飞景) Yellow Brilliance,
Inner Transformation of the Central Brilliance,
Piercing Spirit to *Jiànqián* (鉴乾) inspect the Heavenly Stem.

Diagrams include:
*The Three Heavens and Five Phases Mixed Unity Diagram of the Supreme One* (《太一混合三五图》),
*The Upper and Lower Yin-Yang Six Jiǎ Diagrams* (《六甲上下阴阳图》),
*The Six Jiǎ Jade Maiden Communicating with Spirits Diagram* (《六甲玉女通灵图》),
*The Supreme One True Person Diagram* (《太一真人图》),
*The Bundled Well Bathing Diagram* (《束井沐浴图》),
*The Inner Vision of Lǎozǐ Diagram* (《老子内视图》),
*The Eight Histories of Western Ascension Diagram* (《西升八史图》),
*The Nine Transformations Embracing the Brilliance Diagram* (《九变含景图》),
*The Red Realm* (《赤界》), etc.,
All of which can guard and secure the Spirit Gates.

**The Spirit Gates: Forefront Elevated, Hindmost Lowered, High and Low Displayed**
The arrangement of their stations.
Wielding a sword a hundred *zhàng* (丈) long, dancing with the Spirit Banner,
The form of the Spirit Soldiers’ banners and swords.
The Ten Absolute Ones hover in the void, brandishing swirling chaos,
Forming *qi* in the emptiness, majestic and resplendent.
The Fire Bells crown the celestial ranks, descending like mist,
The Golden Essence and Fire Bells,
Ascending to pierce the heavens.
The ranks and formations resemble the gathering of mist and clouds.
Where does one find the Yellow Gate between the brows?
Meditating upon the Fire Soldiers’ *qi* and forms,
All reside in the *Tiāntíng* (天庭).
The *Tiāntíng* is also called the Yellow Gate (黄阙),
Between the brows it is.
This is not a superficial matter—
It is the root of Daoist cultivation.

**Chapter Twenty-Nine: The Purple Clear Emperor’s Grand Dao**
The Purple Clear Emperor (紫清上皇), the Grand Daoist Sovereign (大道君),
Also known as the Jade Dawn Sovereign (玉晨君).
The titles *Tàixuán* (太玄) and *Tàihé* (太和)*,
The noble designations of the True Immortals.
Transforming to generate all things, making me an Immortal—
The merit of Daoist *qi*.
Ascending in ten days to the Ten Heavens, riding the Jade Axis.
Swiftly departing by the *qi* of sudden efficacy.
Day and night, for seven days, meditate without sleep—
Sincerity will evoke the response.
If you can practice this, you may endure eternally,
Extending years through the Immortal’s Dao.
Accumulating merit to complete the refining is not innate—
The Way is achieved through cultivation.
This stems from sincerity and also from focus,
Guarding the One as at the beginning,
Leaving ample attainment of the Dao.
Internally guarding the firm and true—
Not losing the rhythm of discipline.

The Void within, serene and undisturbed, naturally attains the Spirit.
The Spirit receives through the Void.

**Chapter Thirty: The Hundred Grains**
The fruits of the hundred grains are the essence of the land.
Grass fruits are called grains; they belong to the category of *yin*.
The five flavors, though externally alluring, are the temptations of demons and foulness—
Not the pure *qi* of the True Way.
Rank odors disrupt the clarity of the Spirit and dissipate the *tàiqì* (胎气).
The *tàiqì* refers to the flavor of no-flavor, the natural *zhèngqì* (正气).
There are methods of *shòuqì* (服气) that cultivate the *tàixī* (胎息).
Dissipate means to lose.

How then can one reverse aging and return to infancy?
It is not by making the hair turn from white to black or regrowing fallen teeth.
This line should follow *Zìcún Shén* (自存神), for what follows is of a different kind.

The Three Souls (*sānhún*) flutter in agitation, the Corporeal Soul (*pò*) decays and crumbles!
Fluttering means not maintaining serenity.
Decay and crumble mean ruin and decline.

Why not nourish yourself with the *Tàihé* (太和) essence and *qi*?
Advancing the method of refining and ingestion.
Thus, one may attain immortality and enter *Huángníng* (黄宁).
*Huángníng* is the fulfillment of the *Huángtíng* (黄庭) Dao.

**Chapter Thirty-One: The Heart Canon**
The Heart Canon—one body, five viscera as sovereigns.
The Spirit receives through the Void; the Heart is the pivot of the Spirit’s dwelling, hence its sovereignty.
The moral *Dao* of movement and stillness lies in contemplation.
This refers to contemplating the *Dānyuán Tóngzǐ* (丹元童子).
Thought is existence; forgetfulness is non-existence.
Thought stirs the Heart before speech, while forgetfulness extinguishes the Heart and preserves the Spirit—thus the moral *Dao* is realized.
Pure and virtuous *qi* naturally radiates clarity.
This arises from constant contemplation.
Whether seated or rising, we are all pillars of the same structure—
The body is the Spirit’s dwelling, hence the saying of shared pillars.
*Wú* (吾) refers to the *Dānyuán Zǐ* (丹元子).
By day, the sun’s brilliance; at dusk, concealment and retreat.
As *Zhuāngzi* says: When awake, the form expands; when asleep, the Souls converge.
Converge means to close.

Harmonizing the *huá jīng* (华精) smooths *yin* and *yang*.
This refers to the Heart’s Spirit gathering with the moon’s correspondence.
*Huá jīng* is the essence of the eyes.
When the Heart opens, the eyes open; when the Heart closes, the eyes close.
Day is *yang*, evening is *yin*—thus *yin* and *yang* are harmonized.

**Chapter Thirty-Two: The Circulation of the Six Extremes**
Circulating through the Six Extremes—concealing at *mǎo* (卯), emerging at *yǒu* (酉).
The use of the Heart’s gathering governs *yin* and *yang*.
Day is circulation; dusk is concealment.
The Six Extremes are the heavens and earth, the four directions within.
*Yǒu* belongs to the north, the realm of concealment and darkness.
The two Kidneys’ Spirits govern longevity.
The Kidney Spirit is *Xuánmíng* (玄冥), with the epithet *Yùyīng* (育婴).
Associated with the north, it governs night—if one can preserve *jīng* (精), longevity follows.
*Héshànggōng* (河上公) says: The Kidneys store *jīng*.
Descending to *Dǒu* (斗), aligning with the initial *jiǔ* (九).
Nine is the *yang* number.
*Dǒu* is the North Star, which governs *yin*—this is the *yang* descending to unite with *yin*.
The *Yì* says: *Bu* (乾, Heaven) attains *jī* (吉, auspiciousness) through concealment.
Concealment is the meaning of *jiǔ*.
Knowing the male and guarding the female prevents aging.
Guarding the female means adhering to the principle of *jiǔ*.
Seeing white and knowing black—urgently sit and guard.
As *Lǎozǐ* says: Know the male, guard the female; know the white, guard the black.
All are the meaning of *jiǔ*.

**Chapter Thirty-Three: The Liver’s Qi**
The Liver’s *qi* is suppressed yet surging, clear and enduring.
The Liver occupies the east, the realm of wood, the origin of vital *qi*.
Clear and enduring are the manifestations of its *qi*.
Arranged in the Six Palaces, it generates the Three Lights.
Visualizing vital *qi* illuminates the five viscera and six bowels,
Like the radiance of the sun, moon, and stars.
With focused intent, the inner Spirit remains unshaken—
This is the power of the One.
Above, it unites with the Three Burners; below, it becomes the Jade Nectar.
The Liver’s *qi* ascending unites with the Three Burners’ *qi*; descending, it becomes the saliva in the mouth.
Just as *yin* ascending becomes clouds, descending becomes rain,
Rain nourishes all things; the Jade Nectar nourishes the hundred bones and nine orifices.
The Mysterious Fluid (*Xuányè*) flows, dispelling foul odors and emitting fragrance.
True *qi* circulating eliminates disease.
It cleanses the teeth, refines the five viscera.
Clouds move, rain descends—nothing is blocked.
The five viscera are refined.
Drawing the *jīn* (津) from the *Xuán yīng* (玄膺) into the *Míngtáng* (明堂),
The method of swallowing saliva descends from the *Xuán yīng* to the throat.
The throat is also called *Chónglóu* (重楼).
Below *Chónglóu* is the *Míngtáng*; below *Míngtáng* is the *Dòngfáng* (洞房); below *Dòngfáng* is the *Dāntián*.
This is the middle region.
Descending to irrigate the throat, the Spirit becomes luminous.
Life depends on *jīnqì* (津气).

Seated beneath the *Huágài* (华盖), wandering the *Guìjīng* (贵京),
*Huágài* is the Lung; the Liver lies beneath it.
*Guìjīng* is the *Dāntián*.
Floating and dancing upon the Three Emperors’ platform, pure and cold,
The Three Emperors are the *Sāndān* (三丹)—the Daoist Lords of the *Dāntián*, also called True Persons.
The Liver’s *qi* drifts, circulating through the Three *Dāntián*.
The Liver’s *qi* is the essence of the eyes, hence the cold, clear platform.
Five-colored clouds swirl in verdant splendor.
The Liver’s *qi* mingles with the five viscera, ascending as five-colored clouds.
Closing the eyes, internally gazing—self-reflection reveals them.
Command the Heart’s Spirits to return and mutually revere one another.
The *Chéngchéng Tóngzǐ* (赤城童子) and the five viscera’s True Persons merge in harmony and mutual respect.
The Seven Mysterious Flowers bloom, opening the *Mìngmén* (命门).
The seven orifices flow freely, with no obstruction.
Harmonizing the Heavenly Way preserves the Mysterious Root.
The body is the foundation of life.
Even at one hundred and twenty years, one may still return.
Hurry to cultivate—time must not be wasted.
Beyond this, guarding the Dao in sincerity becomes truly difficult.
Death draws near.
Only await the *Jiǔ Zhuàn Bā Qiōng Dān* (九转八琼丹),
The Nine-Turned Elixir of Eight Precious Stones—white, ascending to Heaven by day.
As *Bàopúzǐ* says in *Jiǔ Dān Lùn* (九丹论):
*"Examining the books on nurturing life and collecting methods for longevity,
I have perused thousands of volumes, yet all emphasize the elixir of gold and liquid as the essence.
Again, the *Huángdì Jiǔ Dǐng Shéndān Jīng* (黄帝九鼎神丹经) states:
The Emperor took it and ascended to immortality, aligning with Heaven and Earth,
Riding clouds and dragons, entering and exiting *Tàiqīng* (太清)."*
The Eight Precious Stones are cinnabar, realgar, orpiment, malachite, sulfur, mica, saltpeter, and salt.

To restore vitality, one must carefully cultivate the Seven Elements—
Even with elixirs of divine potency, one must also practice the *Huángtíng* Dao.

The Seven Elements refer to the seven stars and the true spirits of the seven orifices.
Moreover, the Five Sovereigns’ Elemental Lords and the White Elemental Lord, the Elemental Lord of Splendor, are also the Seven Elemental Dao Lords.

*The Dòngfáng Mèi* states:
*"To cultivate the Seven Elements, the incantation is:
*'Return the Elements to concealment, dispel the seven luminaries.'*
This is the Seven Elements."*

The radiance of the sun and moon rescues aging decay—
The left eye governs the sun, the right eye governs the moon.
The eyes govern the liver, corresponding to the east’s wood phase.
Wood belongs to spring, spring is the breath of life—thus it rescues aging decay.
The liver’s *qi* circulates endlessly without cessation.

As *Zhuāngzǐ* says:
*"When the finger’s fire burns out, the flame passes to the kindling—
Life endures through nourishment, and thus the breath continues."*

**Chapter Thirty-Four on the Lungs**
The lungs’ *qi* originates from the Triple Burner.
*The Zhōnghuáng Jīng* states:
*"The lungs’ apex governs the Triple Burner."*
The lungs’ *qi* refers to *qìsòu* (气嗽), which arises from the Triple Burner—
Thus it is said the Triple Burner gives rise to it.

Many explanations of the Triple Burner lack precision;
Now it is understood as the five viscera’s upper conduits.

*"Jiao"* means heat—
Speaking of the liver, heart, and lungs’ apexes, it conveys the sense of scorching heat.

To perceive the unseen, listen to the child within—
The child is the heart-spirit, the one in *Chìchéng* (赤城).

**Chapter Thirty-Four on the Lungs** (continued)

**Elemental Yangzi** says:
*"Observe the separation and preserve the child within—
The child is the *mùtóng* (目童, 'eyeball child').*
To know of life and death,
one must press the hand’s fingers against the eye’s outer corner—
wait for its glow.
If light appears, life remains;
if no light, death is near.*

*Nurture the five *huá* (华, *qi of the viscera*) to let essence flourish in the teeth,*
*The Five Huá* are the *qi* of the five viscera.
*The Immortal Scriptures* say:
*"Hair should be combed often,
teeth should be struck often."*

*Thirty-six gulps of saliva into the Jade Pool,*
*The mouth is the Jade Pool, also called the Huá Pool (华池).*
*The gallbladder is the Central Pool.*
*The uterus is the Jade Spring (玉泉).*
*The Huá Pool’s saliva descends into the Elixir Field,*
*thus watering the sacred root.*

*Begin by unblocking the hundred vessels of blood and vital fluids.*
*The body’s blood and vital fluids originate from the mouth as their source.*

*Complexion radiates with golden, jade-like luster—
all joints unblocked.*
*Teeth remain firm, hair black as if unaware of whitening,*
*reverting to youth from old age.*
*Preserve this true spirit without letting it scatter,*
*concentrate sincerity and it will not fall.*
*Remember this palace has its seat and resting place,*
*This palace refers to the Lung Organ.*
*The seat and resting place are where the spirit dwells.*
*The Zhōnghuáng Jīng* states:
*"The lungs’ apex governs the Triple Burner,
where the Lord of Mysterious Age (玄老君) resides."*

*The myriad spirits gather and transform, seeking one another,*
*The myriad true essences converge,
yet fear the intrusion of malevolent *qì*."*

「Begin with the hidden *羽盖* [feathered canopy] gazing upon the celestial abode—
this illuminates the affairs of the **Spleen Organ**.

The Spleen is the **Dan Tian** [Elixir Field] and **Huang Ting** [Yellow Court],
the central **Wù-Jǐ** [pentagon hexagram],
the realm of Earth’s cycle.
Above, it oversees the Liver and Lungs,
like a canopy and dwelling.

Morning reverence to the **Tai Yang** [Great Yang] Lord, joyously summoning the spirits—
this refers to the **hun** [ethereal soul] and spirits gathering with the myriad Daoists.
The *Sù Líng Jīng* [Scripture of the Primordial Soul] states:
*"The Supreme Daoists possess the Tai Yang Lord, Shao Yang Lord, Tai Xu Lord, and Hao Su Lord—
the myriad sages follow the Dao’s joyous harmony."*

The **Ming Shen** [Illuminated Spirit] employs the **Eight Threats** to repel malevolence,
the **Eight Threats** being the Eight **Ling Shen** [Spiritual Essences].
The *Zhēn Yǔ* [True Speech] states:
*"The Northern Emperor’s Ghost-Slaying Incantation reads:
Seven Rectitudes, Eight Spirits, Supreme Celestial, Radiant and Malevolent, Long Lu, and the Great Numbers—
handling the Emperor’s Bell, the Primordial *Sù* [unrefined essence], and the Three Divine Threat-Swords,
the God-King’s Protective Law,
the Dao of repelling malevolence.*

The Spleen’s spirit returns to its **Wei Jia** [Stomach Family].
Guarding the **female** while preserving the **male**, tilting toward the **Three Lights** [Sun, Moon, and Stars]—
the Spleen’s spirit is named **Cháng Zài** [Constant Presence],
its character **Hun Tíng** [Soul’s Rest].
The Spleen grinds and dissolves food,
while the Stomach, as the *Lǎo Zǐ* [Old Master] says:
*"Know its male, guard its female.
The female pertains to household matters."*
The *Zhōnghuáng Jīng* [Scripture of the Central Yellow] states:
*"The Stomach is the Great Female;
it is soft and yielding."*
The **Three Lights** are Sun, Moon, and Stars.

The **Tai Cāng** [Great Granary]—
the Spleen’s **府** [storehouse]—
has the **external square and internal round** [form], with spirit dwelling within.
Nurture the **Ling Gēn** [Spiritual Root] without letting it wither—
the **external square and internal round** are the symbols of the **Ming Tang** [Illuminated Hall].
The Spleen is the **Huang Ting** [Yellow Court],
the foundation of human life.
If the **Heart** concentrates in nourishing it,
the blood vessels will flow unimpeded,
the Five **Zàng** [solid organs] will flourish,
and longevity as a Daoist Immortal will be attained.

Seal the **Ming Men** [Life Gate], preserving the **Yu Du** [Jade Metropolis]—
the **Yuan Yang Zi** [Primordial Yang Master] says:
*"The Ming Men is the lower Dan Tian,
where refined essence and qi enter the spirit."*
Nurture the **Tóng** [child] below, protecting its master—
the **master** refers to the **body**.」

The body is the **Jade Metropolis**, where the spirit gathers—
like a capital city.
The myriad spirits reward longevity with abundance,
for the myriad spirits repay with nourishment—
thus, life is prolonged.

This is called the **Spleen established in the Central Palace**.
The Spleen, as **Middle Official** [#11], embodies **Earth virtue**.
The Five **Zàng** [solid organs] and Six **Fǔ** [hollow organs], divine and sovereign,
take the Spleen as their master.

Above, it aligns with the **Heavenly Gate** to enter the **Ming Tang** [Illuminated Hall],
preserving the **qi** of the Five **Zàng** and Six **Fǔ**—
the **Heavenly Gate** lies between the brows, that is, the **Heavenly Court**.
One inch inward from the **brow junction** is the **Ming Tang**.

Guard the **feminine**, preserve the **masculine**, and incline the **Three Lights** [Sun, Moon, Stars].
As *Laozi* says: *"Know the masculine, guard the feminine."*
**Feminine**—the **vulnerable** [yīn];
**gently yielding** also.
The **Three Lights**—the Sun, Moon, and Stars.
**External square and internal round**, with spirit dwelling within.
**External square and internal round**—the symbols of the **Ming Tang**.
Unimpeded flow of blood vessels and flourishing of the Five **Zàng**,
with spirit serene and heart tranquil.

Bones turn **verdant**, sinews **crimson**, marrow like frost—
the **hundred vessels** and **nine orifices** are all truly authentic.
The Spleen rescues the **seven orifices**, banishing misfortune,
grinding food and aiding digestion—
ears sharp, eyes bright.

The Sun and Moon are arranged, setting **yīn** and **yáng** in order.
The Sun is **yáng**, the Moon is **yīn**—
the Sun is male, the Moon is female.
The two spirits unite, transforming into **Jade Nectar**—
male and female **yīn-yáng**, the natural **essence-fluid**.

Faint and flavorless, the root of **Heaven and Man**,
though spirits unite, one must savor the **flavorless**.

The **True Person of the Child Dan** advances **refined qi**—
**Child Dan**—the **True Person** advances the **true qi** of the **Dan Tian**.
The Spleen, as **Central Yellow**, grinds and digests food.
Thus, it is called **Ling Gāo** [Luminous Paste] and **Yù Shuāng** [Jade Frost]—
the colors of **essence-fluid** and refined **qi**.

The **Taoist Sovereign** conceals the **Eight Pure** [substances] in the **Encircled Pearl**—
referring to the **Twelve-Layered Vermilion Palace** [throat], the **reed pipe** [larynx].
Within are the **Eight Pure** elixirs.
They nourish the **Eight Fluids**, and the **Kidneys** receive the **essence**.

Hidden in the **Great Yīn** [Chamber of Mystery], I behold its form—
**Great Yīn**, the **Cavern Chamber**—
witnessing the form of the **Jade Fluids**.

The **Wind of Exaltation** stirs the **Three Mysteries**, emerging as **Emerald**.
**Emerald Wind**—transformed by sensation.
**Yīn** and **yáng** **qi**, along with the **Harmonious Qi**, make three—
three gives birth to the myriad things, the subtle origin of life—
thus, it is said the **Three Mysteries** emerge as **Emerald**.
Speaking of all things born in **verdant** hue.

*The Taiping Jing* says: *"Accumulating essence yields verdancy."*

In a fleeting moment, it reaches **purity and clarity**—
the **yīn-yáng** vital breath, most subtle and wondrous.

At the **Playground Terrace**, I see the **Red** born,
The **Harmonious Qi** refined becomes the **Red Child**.
The **Red Child**, the **True Person**.
The **Playground Terrace**, the **Piercing Wind Terrace**, where immortals gather and play.

In the **Free Realm**, the **True Qi** nurtures **Flourishing Virtue**,
Beyond the world, the **True Qi** naturally sustains life.
Within, gazing silently, refining the **Five Forms**,
Observing the body inwardly, preserving the **spirit-qi** eternally.

The **Three Qi** hover, attaining **Divine Clarity**—
The **Three Dantian’s qi** also.

Hidden **Dragon**, eluding **Chí** in **Clouded Lingying**,
*The Daoist Scripture* says: The **Liver and Gallbladder** are the **Green Dragon**, hence "Hidden Dragon."
The **Five Viscera, Nine Orifices, and Eight Palaces** are the **Inner Chí**, hence "Eluding Chí."
**Clouded Lingying**—the **Spleen’s** **Jīn-yè** fluids.
They can satiate hunger, commanding all spirits.

Above, the **Mysterious-Mysterious** canopy; below, the **Tiger Seal**,
The **apparel of immortals**.
*The Yuanlu Scripture* says: Immortals have the **Mysterious Feathered Umbrella** and the **Divine Tiger Jade Seal**.

**Chapter Thirty-Six: Bathing in Ritual Purity**
Bathing in splendor, discarding **fat** and **pungent** scents,
*Splendor*—ancient *lěng* (cold).
**Fat**—fish, meat.
**Pungent**—the five **spicy** aromas.

Entering the chamber, binding oneself toward reciting the **Jade Texts**,
For the **Supreme Emperor** resides in the East.

Strictly observing ten thousand repetitions, its meaning becomes fresh—
Without leaving the body.

**Chapter Thirty-Six (continued): Bathing in Ritual Purity**

**Loosening the Hair Without Desire for Longevity**
Loosening the hair, free of **desire**, to prolong existence.
*The Scripture of the Immortals* states: "Before taking the **Nine Clouds of the Lingying Bell***, one must loose the hair."

Again, the **Fetal Breathing Method** instructs:
Lie on your back, loosen the hair, and raise your pillow two and a half inches.
Curl both hands, gripping the **Great Mother Finger** (thumb) firmly,
Close your eyes, extend both arms five inches from the body,
Then **gargle** and fill your mouth.
Hold the **Middle Saliva** (saliva collected in the mouth) and swallow it three times.
Slowly draw in **qi** through the nose,
Inhale **five to six breaths** before exhaling.
One exhalation and one inhalation constitute one **breath**.
When you reach ten exhalations, you may reduce the frequency.
Upon completion, repeat the process.
Filling four times nine (36 times) marks one **session** complete.

Upon examining the text’s meaning,
This "loosening the hair" is not exclusive to this **Dao** alone.
It embodies the **Way** of **wuwei** (non-action), attaining effortless **virtue** through naturalness—
Free from external **emotional desires**.

All five **flavors** return to **Zheng-qi** (pure/true **qi**), merging into one.
This is the **Dao** of nature.

Calm the **heart**, still the **mind**—do not disturb the **Yuan** (source).
**Question**—serenity.
Silent and tranquil stillness.
*The Dao Scripture* says: "Its governance is **questioning**, its people are **pure**."

Having counted the repetitions, the **body’s** **shen** (spirit) and **jing** (essence) are refined,
Focusing the **jing** where it is directed.

The Yellow Flowered Jade Maiden reveals the **Zi’s** (child’s) **emotion**,
The **Dan-tian** (Elixir Field) **yin** (dark) **shen** (spirit) speaks to oneself.

When the **Zhen-ren** (True Person) arrives, he summons the Six **Ding** (heavenly officials),
The **Zhen-ren** refers to the scholar’s **body**.
**Arrival** means **jing** (essence) has reached its peak.
The Six **Ding** are as previously described.

Then he imparts the *Great Scripture of the Hidden Immortality*—
The **Hidden Immortality** refers to the recluse.
He likens the **sage** to the **Zhi-ying** (herb/plant’s flower).

After ten recitations and four bows to the **Taoist Sovereign**,
The *Jade Essence True Scripture* states:
*"The Eastern Jade Scripture"* is to be read aloud ten times and bowed to four times.
The **Jade Scripture** refers to this text.

First, one pays homage to the **Taoist Emperor**,
Then faces north—
The **Taoist Emperor** resides in the **Shu** (constellation), and the **Seven Yuan** (primordial stars) dwell in the north.

The *Yellow Court Inner Scripture* and **Jade Book** are now freely expounded.
The **Dao** of the **sage** is thus perfected.

The instructor’s words are solemn, the recipient’s oath is binding—
This text must be revered, hence the vow.
*"Cloud brocade, phoenix-patterned robes, and golden clasps"* are tokens of faith,
Used in place of cutting the hair or drawing blood to pledge sincerity.

With clasped hands, ascending the mountain to oppose the **Ye** (darkness) **liquid** (elixir),
One who receives and practices the **Yellow Court Dao** must renew the oath before instruction.

Only then may the **Golden Book** and **Jade Scripture** be revealed.
Trust is established before transmission.

Upon attaining it, one may pass it to the **Three Officials**—
The **Three Officials**, namely Heaven, Earth, and Water.
But let not the **Seven Ancestors** suffer **Ming** (dark/obscure) **hui** (calamity),
For transmission to the unworthy brings misfortune upon one’s forebears.

**息**—read as *huan* (return/restore).
The **Supreme Dao’s** subtle words lead to immortality—
Worthy of reverence, worthy of esteem.
This is the true text of the **Way of Non-Death**.

With a single heart, hold it in respect and practice accordingly.
