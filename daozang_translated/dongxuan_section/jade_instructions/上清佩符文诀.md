### **The Writs of the Azure Tallies for Upper Clarity**

**The Primordial Record of the Nine Heavens’ True Writs, Inscribed by the Originator to Examine the Earth**
The Three Origins’ Mystic Terrace Jade Tallies and Purple Writs—also called *The Primordial Record of the Nine Heavens’ True Writs, Inscribed by the Originator to Examine the Earth*, or *The Three Origins’ Tiger Writs*, or *The Flying Heavenly Perfected’s Proclamation to the Essences of the Six Heavens and Myriad Spirits*—govern mountains and rivers, inspect the spirits of the Nine Lands, and command ninety Jade Maidens. Through this, one may welcome the Sagely Lord in the Palace of Upper Clarity during the Great Peace. The recipient must transcribe it with a yellow brush upon azure silk and offer it in sacrifice at the sacred peak of their natal destiny. They shall then wear it for nine years. If they have not yet ascended to heaven, they must transcribe another copy, burn it, and scatter the ashes into the azure mist of the clouds. They shall transcribe yet another copy and bury it at the sacred peak of their natal destiny, tread the sources of the rivers, govern the earth’s spirits, and command the myriad gods. After nine years, they will ride the chariot of the Three Origins and ascend to the Palace of the Three Origins. If one defiles it with impurity, offends the celestial perfected, or carelessly reveals its proclamations, their seven generations will bear blame, their body will perish, and they will lose immortality.
*From the* Scripture of the Three Origins’ Jade Tallies.

**The Jade Clarity’s Floating-Radiance Canopy of the Flowering Heavenly Mystery, the Hidden Writ of the Golden Mystery’s Inner Text**
The Three Primordials of the Grand Simplicity received it from the Celestial King of the Primordial Beginning and transmitted it to the Jade Maiden of the Great Harmony.

It shall summon the immortal officials of the Northwest Realm of Blessed Virtue and the World of Extending Worthies. After twelve years, the Jade Maidens of the Upper Palace shall descend to the adept’s bedchamber to transmit the Dao of divine perfection. Furthermore, inscribe it in purple upon yellow silk and wear it while traveling to the Northwest Realm of Extending Worthies; then, the myriad spirits shall gird themselves in submission, and demon kings shall bow their heads in reverence. One shall ride a flying cloud and feathered canopy to roam the Jade Clarity Palace.

**The Northern Emperor’s Vast Numinous Demon-Slaying Ghost-Killing Jade Writ**
Received from the Highest Three Heavens, guarded by twenty-six Jade Maidens of the Great Mystery, it is also called the *Mighty Divine Jade Strategy*, worn by the Demon-Quelling King of Jade Clarity. To slay ghosts of Ren and Gui days, inscribe it in green upon yellow silk, twelve inches long and three inches and two *fen* wide. On Ren days, place it upon the central Wu; on Gui days, place it upon Ji. Hold the breath for twelve cycles, knock the teeth thirty-six times, and recite the incantation:
*"Heaven topples, earth surges; the four seasons seize their light. The five phases hasten their reckoning, inspecting and fixing the ten directions. The Celestial Emperor ascends his throne; the August Elder emerges from his chamber. By the command of the Highest, the sound severs without refuge. First execute the ghostly wretches, then sever the multitude of malevolence. A thousand demons, ten thousand trials—none shall not submit and descend. All shall conform to the Jade Writ. The flowing bells of the eight thoroughfares, the vast-falling stars cast in exchange, mountains and peaks collapse and crumble. Obey Heaven and follow the mandate; the Earls and Scribes shall share in the merit."*
Conclude by drawing in the breath twelve times and swallowing it. Practicing this for twelve days, the demonic kind shall be extinguished, and the multitude of malevolent spirits shall lose their essence. Inscribe it in green upon yellow silk and wear it while traveling the world; myriad ghosts shall flee of themselves, and a thousand demons shall conceal their traces. After twelve years, one shall naturally gain the service of nine Jade Maidens of the Azure Waist.
This talisman is from the *Scripture of the Jade Clarity’s Hidden Writ*.
