**The Supreme Clarity Hidden Annotations of the Jade Canon’s Precious Formulas**

The Most High’s profound subtleties, the primal origin of the Three Caverns—words of utmost mystery, obscure and rarely heard. Vast and boundless, they crown the unseen, encompassing all beings. Lofty and majestic, the supreme virtue, the abode of ultimate perfection, the gate of all wonders, the origin of divine immortals—gathered and formed into scripture.

Through recitation, one ascends the void; spurring dragons to ride the clouds. Only through faith and devotion, restraining emotions to focus the mind. Thus, those of resolute aspiration seek this canon afar, revering their masters, bowing in the hall of virtue, earnestly inquiring and consulting, to receive the precious scripture. Without transgression or doubt, with true faith in the correct Dao, divine immortality may be attained.

Exhale the old, inhale the new; draw in the essence of sacred mushrooms. The void summons the void—flight to immortality comes in time. The Dharma Wheel settles enlightenment; penetrating vision surveys the nine realms. How distant and wondrous the formulas—how could middling immortals fathom them?

Therefore, disciples of true learning, if you can meditate alone before the vision, align your intent with the cinnabar elixir, refine and test your perceptions of form, endure hunger and cold without weariness; eat at noon, unperturbed by slander, unmoved by praise; cultivate virtue within, indifferent to the crowd’s gaze; bathe in green angelica, preserving the fetal qi unharmed; enter the chamber for purification, burning true sandalwood incense—then don your ritual robes and headdress, arrange your sacred garments, set offerings below, and surrender your life to the Supreme Perfected. Bow thrice before the canon.

Unseal the eight-hued treasury, display the supreme precious repository. Hold and recite the *Great Cavern’s Wondrous Scripture*, the *Venerable Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue*, the *Hidden Chapters of the Eight Simplicities*, the *Golden Perfected and Jade Radiance*, dispelling demons and dispersing spirits; summon immortals with the *Step Through the Void*, soar with the *Feathered Flight Scripture*. Pure tones resound through the heavens—ten thousand perfected descend to the courtyard.

The Most High commands his chariot; together we ride the cloud-carriage. Lush and dense, merging with the distant and obscure. The Three Simplicities align with the light; a halo of perfect clarity rests upon the nape. The body is clad in gauze robes, jade pendants and fire-bells at the waist. Solemn and lofty, the perfected soar afar. Jade splendor lends its wings—together we ascend to the Supreme Clarity.

Regardless of noble or base, success lies in utmost sincerity. The Three Realms offer tribute; demon kings submit in welcome. Endless years stretch beyond measure—who knows the span of kalpas? Here, in this freedom, may my fortune and integrity endure forever.

**The Hidden Annotations of the Jade Canon state:** *Method for Transmitting the Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue.*

The master faces north, the scripture placed upon the table. The disciple prostrates to the left; the master holds the scripture, the disciple presents the ritual offering. The master knocks his teeth thirty-six times, visualizing the Three Palaces—Mud Pill, Cinnabar Field, and Crimson Palace—where the Three Ones emerge, a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders guarding the master. Then he intones:

*"Vast and drifting, the Great Void’s ridge,
Streaming light dwells in the Supreme Mystery.
The scripture begins before kalpas end,
Long preserving heaven, earth, and humanity.
Worldly rulers learn to emulate Yao;
Daoists recite to attain immortality.
Worthy ones now receive it,
Transmitting it according to the law.
In times without the utmost virtuous,
Guard its secrecy—do not recklessly reveal.
Uphold it to ascend the Great Clarity;
Discard it to fall into the Nine Springs.
I speak of the effortless Dao,
Pure stillness—virtue’s natural state."*

Finished, the disciple bows thrice to receive the scripture. If the disciple is female, she prostrates to the right. All scriptures follow this same method.

---

**The Hidden Annotations of the Jade Canon state:** *Method for Transmitting the True Scripture of the Great Cavern.*

The master faces north, the scripture placed upon the table. The master holds the scripture, the disciple presents the ritual offering. The master knocks his teeth thirty-six times, visualizing the Jade Emperor of the Most High, commanding the light of sun and moon to illuminate the bodies of master and disciple. Then he intones:

*"How distant and subtle, the Great Tenuity!
Perfected beings weave life from the void.
The empty ford’s natural Dao
Gathers into the Great Cavern Scripture.
True worthies present ritual offerings,
Riding destiny through the Yellow Court.
The Most High erases the register of death;
The Director of Destinies inscribes their immortal names.
Guard its secrecy through kalpas of years;
Reckless disclosure binds you to hell’s torments.
Calamities and trials reach seven generations—
The wind-knife will sever your form."*

Finished, the disciple bows thrice to receive the scripture.

---

**The Hidden Annotations of the Jade Canon state:** *Method for Transmitting the Most High Numinous Treasure’s Wondrous Scripture of the Great Cavern.*

The master faces north, the scripture placed upon the table. The master holds the scripture, the disciple presents the ritual offering. The master knocks his teeth thirty-six times, visualizing the colors of the Five Viscera, fully arrayed to form a canopy of precious clouds, enveloping master and disciple. Then he intones:

*"Heaven’s writ is not cumbersome;
The Dao and virtue are self-sufficient.
Cultivate them—immortality is certain.
What more could one desire?
Radiance shines between the Great Void,
Resplendent and profoundly dense.
Transmit it strictly according to the law;
Reckless disclosure casts you into hell."*

Finished, the disciple bows thrice to receive the scripture, then turns to bow once to each of the ten directions, beginning in the north and circling eastward. Visualize the true forms of the Most High in the ten directions, as if present in image.

---

**The Hidden Annotations of the Jade Canon state:** *Method for Transmitting the Most High Three Sovereigns’ Celestial Writ.*

The master faces north, the scripture placed upon the table. The master holds the scripture, the disciple presents the ritual offering. The master knocks his teeth twenty-four times, visualizing the Three Palaces, each with a perfected being in the form of an infant, unclothed, mouths emitting purple qi to bathe master and disciple. Then he intones:

*"The Most High’s celestial writ,
Transmitted since heaven and earth’s beginning.
The Sovereigns proclaimed the mysterious intent—
This is the scripture of utmost perfection.
Worthy ones now receive it,
Aspiring to ascend the Great Void."*

Finished, the disciple bows twice to receive the scripture.

---

**The Hidden Annotations of the Jade Canon state:** *For transmitting the Upper Clarity’s ranked scriptures and talismans, all face north. Middle-ranked texts, with their external writings of practice, the master faces east. Registers of immortal sage descendants—when transmitting scriptures, the master faces south. Male disciples prostrate to the left, female disciples to the right. Ritual offerings, vows, and oaths follow the master’s method.*

The Hidden Annotations of the Jade Canon state: When opening the treasury of the *Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue*, first burn incense, arrange the ritual vestments, and perform obeisance according to the initial method, then intone:

*"The profoundest Dao’s ancestral school,
Supreme virtue embodies the Vast Origin.
Though celestial perfected ones dwell in distant mystery,
They draw near through the Lord of the Mud-Pill Palace.
Palaces and chambers are all of seven treasures,
Windows and doors part by nature’s own design.
Through purity and quiescence, ever summon the real;
Mount the light and ride the purple clouds.
Sun and moon illumine left and right,
Ascending as immortals, preserving eternal years.
Seven generations of ancestors ascend to heaven,
And the world becomes a gate of Dao and virtue."*

Thereupon, the scripture may be read.

The Hidden Annotations of the Jade Canon state: When opening the treasury of the *Scripture of Cavernous Perfection*, first burn incense, arrange the ritual vestments, and perform obeisance according to the method, then intone:

*"The subtle and wondrous gate of the Mysterious School,
Radiant and resplendent, it pierces the empty cavern.
The supreme Dao arises from stillness and silence—
Then behold the Three Luminous Palaces.
Here the Great Dao is accomplished,
Riding the light upon cloud-dragons.
Left and right attend the scripture-immortals,
Jade maidens and jade lads.
The body crosses the elixir of deathlessness,
Loosening the net to follow the numinous wind.
Seven generations of ancestors return to womb-birth,
And the world becomes a lineage of divine immortals."*

The Hidden Annotations of the Jade Canon state: When opening the treasury of the *Scripture of Cavernous Mystery*, first burn incense, arrange the ritual vestments, and perform obeisance according to the method, then intone:

*"The quiescent and utterly non-being school,
Vastly towering through kalpas and peaks.
The wondrous and open scripture of Cavernous Mystery—
Who can fathom its secluded depths?"*

Entering the Great Vehicle’s path,
who reckons the kalpas’ span?
Neither born nor dying—
to be born, rely on the lotus.
Transcending the three realms’ roads,
a compassionate heart unravels the world’s net.
The Perfected holds supreme virtue,
and generation after generation becomes a lineage of immortals.

The Hidden Annotations of the Jade Canon state: When opening the treasury of the *Three Sovereigns’ Celestial Writ*, first burn incense, arrange the ritual vestments, perform obeisance as in the method above, then intone:

*"The Supreme’s talisman of settled spirit,
inscribed with the wisdom of heaven and earth.
At the mere sound of its name, chariots need not wait—
the ten thousand immortals gather in an instant.
Summoning the numinous, great or small,
how much less the defiled and impure?
Purify the fast, sever worldly affairs,
and in subtle solitude face the divine.
Ascend to the Jade Clarity Palace,
to roam and feast beyond the nine distant realms."*

The Hidden Annotations of the Jade Canon state: When reading the *Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue*, knock the teeth thirty-six times, swallow saliva thirty-six times, and first visualize in the mind: the Azure Dragon to the left, the White Tiger to the right, the Vermilion Bird before, the Dark Warrior behind, the Eight Trigrams and thirty-six divine tortoises beneath the feet, a lion crouching ahead, the Seven Stars upon the headcloth, the five viscera generating the five qi, and the net of scriptural patterns covering the body. The Three Ones attend the scripture, each accompanied by a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, while heaven and earth each have eighteen thousand jade maidens and jade lads to guard them.

The Hidden Annotations of the Jade Canon state: When reading the *Scripture of Cavernous Perfection*, knock the teeth thirty-six times, swallow saliva thirty-six times, and first visualize the Hundred Spirits and Ten Thousand Perfected of the Revolving Wind’s primordial unity, then chant the Cavernous Scripture.

The Hidden Annotations of the Jade Canon state: When reading the *Scripture of Cavernous Mystery*, knock the teeth thirty-six times in the *huoluo* manner, swallow saliva thirty-six times, and visualize the five viscera’s five-colored qi ascending to infuse the essence of the Five Stars, then read the scripture.

The Hidden Annotations of the Jade Canon state: When reciting the *Jade Chapters of the Supreme’s Cavernous Mystery Step-in-Void Scripture*, first knock the teeth three times, swallow saliva three times, and visualize the sun and moon above one’s face entering the Cavern Chamber’s Golden Flower Palace through the nostrils, their radiance emerging from behind the neck to form a resplendent nine-colored orb. It thins into the Jade Pillow, penetrating and illuminating the ten directions, following the distant scripture in a revolving path. The sun enters through the left nostril, the moon through the right; when finished, knock the teeth again as in the initial method.

The Hidden Annotations of the Jade Canon state: When reading the *Scriptures of Ascension to Immortality*, first knock the teeth twelve times, swallow saliva twelve times, and chant each section three times, knocking the teeth each time. Each scripture scroll has its own method; where no method is recorded, follow this formula.

The Hidden Annotations of the Jade Canon state: If the Daoist scriptures are not received from a master, the spirits will not respond. Should there be no master in the world, nor anyone to transmit the registers, present the ritual pledge to a secluded retreat, or secretly face the Mystic Master Lord Lao toward the north, bow three times, then offer alms to the hungry and needy with impartial sincerity before using the scriptures. If a master is present in the world, this method need not be followed.

The Hidden Annotations of the Jade Canon state: When reciting scriptures, sit upon a small dais five feet high, equal in length and breadth, wearing only a kerchief and robe—no coarse hempen garments are needed.

The vestments of the Perfected when reading scriptures: a nine-light brocade robe of *liluo*, a cinnabar-silk headcloth adorned with precious luminosity, and slippers bearing lion patterns. Today’s Daoist priests, diligent in ritual affairs, wear rough robes, but on the day they attain the Dao, the Heavenly Thearch will bestow upon them the nine-light *liluo* robe, the celestial treasure tassels, and the flying immortal’s ritual vestments to repay their past virtue. Do not covet the world’s crowns and coronets and abandon the Daoist’s humble garb. Though worldly attire brings immediate glory, it cannot escape death, whereas the Daoist’s coarse robes and ritual vestments lead to ascension as an immortal, clad in celestial raiment. Wearing the celestial robe enables one to fly as an immortal and ride the void.

The Hidden Annotations of the Jade Canon state: The method of reading scriptures follows the sounds of the Central Land—this is the true tone of the Nine Heavens. The *Sixty-Four Great Brahma Laudation Scriptures*, when chanted with regulated voice, are also true tones. The sounds of scripture reading should model these true tones.

The Immortal Duke said: When Laozi transformed the Western Barbarians, he taught them to read scriptures in the tones of the Great Brahma Heaven—whatever pleases the Daoist is fitting.

The Hidden Annotations of the Jade Canon state: After reading five hundred characters, knock the teeth three times, lick the upper and lower lips with the tongue, and swallow saliva three times to prevent exhaustion and preserve a clear voice over time. Without this method, one harms the qi and wearies the spirit.

The Perfected said: Brew a strong infusion of bamboo leaves to drink while reading scriptures and engaging in visualization—this benefits essence, unites with the spirit, and harmonizes the qi’s flow.

The Hidden Annotations of the Jade Canon state: The Supreme’s *Nine Great Hidden Talismans*—when dissolved in water at noon and ingested for a thousand days—enable one to pass through all barriers at will, appearing and vanishing as desired, becoming an immortal. Wearing the *Five Talismans of Numinous Treasure* upon the body allows one to ride dragons and command qi, traverse water and fire, with the Five Thearchs as escorts, soaring far and high—this too makes one an immortal. Wearing the *True Forms of the Five Peaks* or the *Great Talismans of the Three Caverns*, one must not approach the bedchamber or engage in yin defilement; death will surely follow, and the hope of immortality will be forever lost—how can one not be cautious?

The Hidden Annotations of the Jade Canon state: When a Daoist enters seclusion to fast and recites the *Jade Chapters of the Supreme’s Step-in-Void* or the *Flying Feather Writs*, they can gallop upon nine dragons while cloud-chariots come to welcome them—these two matters should be kept secret.

The Hidden Annotations of the Jade Canon state: Constantly recite the *Five Thousand Characters* ten thousand times, and the Supreme’s cloud-dragons will descend to welcome you. If after completing ten thousand recitations you have not departed, read it three times a month until the cloud-chariot arrives, and you will ascend as an immortal.

The Hidden Annotations of the Jade Canon state: Constantly recite the *Inner Radiance of the Yellow Court Scripture*, and you will not die. Constantly ingest primordial qi—this too is the Way of not dying.

The Hidden Annotations of the Jade Canon state: Constantly visualize the head as upright and blue-green like jasper, the two hands as cinnabar, and the two feet as snow.

Through such focused meditation upon the scriptures and the practice of these wondrous arts, one draws near to immortality. Constantly strike the teeth twelve times—twelve times by day and night, once each hour—and the body shall not die, for the spirits will ever be present to guard it.

The Hidden Annotations of the Jade Canon state: Striking the teeth is also called "Heavenly Drum," summoning the body’s spirits, calling down celestial perfected ones, and assembling the host of immortals. Striking the left teeth is called "Ringing the Heavenly Bell," while striking the right teeth is called "Striking the Heavenly Chime." Should a Daoist fear the approach of malevolent ghosts or thieves, ringing the bell and striking the chime twenty-four times each will cause evil spirits to dare not advance, while heavenly demons will guard the body, and a hundred blessings will arrive together.

The Hidden Annotations of the Jade Canon state: The *Dao and Virtue Scripture* of Laozi says: "Seen, it cannot be perceived as *Yi*; heard, it cannot be perceived as *Xi*; grasped, it cannot be held as *Wei*—these are the titles of the Three Primordials, the Venerable Lords." It further says: "These three cannot be exhaustively questioned, thus they blend into one." These Three Purities unite to form the Primordial Unity Lord, the mysterious father and primordial mother of the womb’s honor. Recite this scripture, and the Three Venerable Lords will appear to you; when you see them, the Dao of immortality is achieved. The Dao is fully contained herein, yet writing cannot exhaust its words, nor words exhaust its meaning. Of all profound principles, none surpasses this text. Though it may be called "understood," none can truly know it.

The Hidden Annotations of the Jade Canon state: Kunlun, Penglai, Mount Zhong, Mount Songgao, and Mount Wangwu—these are also fully recorded in the *Upper Clarity Scriptures*. The Hidden Annotations of the Jade Canon state: The land of Yanna Luo Wei, the Kunlun Mountain of Men and Birds—this is a separate domain of the Primordial Heavenly King, with seven-jeweled palaces and lofty terraces piercing the heavens. The Queen Mother of the West first studied the Dao upon this mountain. All three caverns’ scriptures are complete there, written upon the void with each character a full *zhang* in size. The mountain’s true form chart is most weighty; wearing or carrying it grants one the mysterious perfection of the Three Caverns. On this mountain, all beasts can fly and never die—how much more so for humans! All wondrous things emerge from here. The multitude of sages on this mountain recite scriptures in the great Brahma Heaven’s tone, neither mournful nor sorrowful, neither slow nor hurried, vast and elegant, essential and wondrous. Those who hear it are dissolved in harmony. The immortals of Kunlun Mountain often appear in the Middle Lands, chanting and singing across the Nine Heavens, their distant echoes desolate and far-reaching, their pure tones crystalline and bright. Those who listen are transported beyond the clouds, their passions forgotten. When the host of immortals gathers, they sing the *Cavern Mystery*, reciting and chanting in unison. Their fresh voices resound sharply, their distant melodies heard afar, their ornate phrases soaring through the empty void. The strings of the void are plucked, and the Jade Clarity is moved to joy. Thus, reciting scriptures is what the perfected above hold in highest esteem.

The *Inscription of the Lofty Terrace* says: "If you wish to ride the void and soar through emptiness, recite my *Step Mystery* and *Feathered Scriptures*." Yet none among the immortals comprehend these words. The *Step Mystery* and *Feathered Scriptures*—these two texts—the *Supreme Mystery Scripture* does not transmit even to middle immortals.

The Perfected One of the Great Ultimate says: The *Step Void Scripture* is the recitation of the *Numinous Treasure* purification rite. The *Feathered Scripture* is the chant of the *Cavern Perfection*.

The Hidden Annotations of the Jade Canon state: Those who study the Dao at home should receive the *Five Thousand Characters*. On the first and fifteenth days of the month, one’s natal day, the eight solar terms, at noon and midnight, recite it once each time. If the disciple cannot read it, they should ask a master to recite it for them. The disciple must personally attend to the incense and fire, listen wholeheartedly to the scripture’s meaning, and resolve to practice its wondrous arts. On the day the form is entrusted to the Great Yin, the Heavenly Emperor’s cloud-chariot will welcome the body’s spirit, sparing it from the trials of Mount Tai, the Three Officials, and the earthly hells. Above, one is reborn before the Heavenly Emperor in heaven; below, one is reborn in the household of a marquis or king. One’s appearance will be complete and radiant, their spirit’s countenance resplendent. Those who behold them will be filled with joy, desiring only to see and hear them. Even women will be transformed into men, forming karmic bonds with the Upper Clarity, and the Dao of immortality will naturally be attained. This scripture is transmitted to all ranks, without distinction of great or small. Whatever one seeks, there will be no hindrance. It sends off the dead and nurtures the living—there is nothing for which it is not fitting. It can also pacify the nation and calm the people, subdue border barbarians, and cause all to follow the Dao. This scripture is wondrous indeed—none surpasses it.

The Hidden Annotations of the Jade Canon state: Though a scholar may cultivate good deeds, if they are afflicted by karmic retribution from past lives—suffering illness, disaster, or frequent exhaustion—Daoist masters should maintain purification rites, recite the *Five Thousand Characters*, and the *Jade Clarity Golden Perfection Scripture of Wisdom for Dispelling Demons* from the middle rank. Their numinous power will protect and guard the sick, for this is what is meant by "receiving aid in times of distress." There is no method of salvation more urgent than this turning of the Dharma wheel.

The Hidden Annotations of the Jade Canon state: When receiving the Three Caverns’ scriptures, one must sever worldly affairs to practice them. The Three Caverns together are called the *Supreme Cavern Unity*—the most exalted of scriptures. If these words are transmitted to three people, one will not ascend as an immortal. Be cautious, be most cautious.

The Hidden Annotations of the Jade Canon state: When receiving scriptures, compare each character three times. A single miswritten character will shorten one’s lifespan by a year; beyond this, the penalty increases accordingly. Adding or omitting a character will also cost a year of life. If one recklessly damages scriptures, in later lives they will suffer the trials of wind blades and bodily dissolution. Those who receive scriptures without revering their master will gain no merit from their practice, and in later lives will be reborn among the sickly or as livestock. Of all evils under heaven, none surpasses treachery. If one conspires in such conduct while practicing the Dao, they will surely face karmic retribution in this life: deafness, blindness, mental confusion, nasal congestion, blocked stomach fluids, bodily infestations, and death, falling into hell to endure all manner of suffering—blade mountains, sword trees, boiling cauldrons, fire swallowing, festering orifices—longing for death yet unable to attain it. Finally, they will be reborn among swine and dogs, only to be slaughtered. This is what is meant by the "three evils."

The Hidden Annotations of the Jade Canon state: When transmitting middle-rank scriptures and below, face east and strike the teeth twelve times, then pray: "Solemn and reverent, the virtue of the perfected above—erasing traces, abiding in tranquil emptiness."

The radiance ascends to the Great Primordial, coming and going without a bridge or ford. With intention, one naturally responds; without devotion to the Dao, it remains distant. Passing it on through successive transmissions, one forges karmic bonds in the unseen. Master and disciple, though unrelated by kinship, become as kin. Revering the scriptures and practicing myriad virtues, ever as if standing at the edge of a deep abyss. Outwardly to rescue from disaster and illness, inwardly to protect and deliver the self.

Upon completion, bow and receive the transmission of the scriptures.

The original practice of immortals likewise employs these incantations and methods.

The Hidden Annotations of the Jade Canon state: The Great Cavern Scripture of Perfection, also called the Scripture of the Great Perfection Dao, or the Supreme Clarity Upper Dao’s *Observing Heaven’s Inner Scripture*, Upper Grade, comprises ten scrolls. The *Scripture of the Golden Elixir of Supreme Clarity* consists of seven scrolls. Its most exalted and wondrous, the *Great Elixir Dispelling Demons and Wisdom Great Cavern Scripture of Perfection*, contains thirty-nine chapters.

The Hidden Annotations of the Jade Canon state: The lofty purport of Supreme Clarity, the subtle words of the Ultimate Perfected, the wondrous scriptures of flying immortals. The *Scriptures of Numinous Treasure*, also called *Cavern of Mystery*, or the *Supreme Ascending Mystery Scripture*, are all upper-grade scriptures of the highest immortals, the utmost perfection of the Void, the profound treasures of the Great Dao. The *Three Sovereigns’ Celestial Writings*, also called *Cavern of Spirit*, or *Cavern of Immortals*, or *Supreme Jade Strategies*—these Three Cavern scriptures and talismans are the warp and weft of the Dao, the mysterious origin of the Great Void, the foremost scriptures of the highest perfected. How could they be heard by middling immortals?

The Hidden Annotations of the Jade Canon state: The precious oral instructions are the ancestors of all scriptures. The Supreme Lord commanded their transmission to the lords, kings, counts, and ministers of the Great Ultimate among the immortals. Without receiving this charge, they are not to be transmitted. Daoists who encounter these writings are all destined to become lords among immortals; their names are predestined in the mysterious registers. The method of transmission requires a token of sincerity: five taels of gold, ninety feet of white silk, and three hundred sheets of paper equal in length to the scripture. These are presented to the master, who then ascertains the seeker’s utmost sincerity in pursuing the cinnabar of the Dao before imparting these precious oral instructions.

Master and disciple first observe a pure fast for nine days—or seven, five, or three days—concluding at noon on the final day to receive the scriptures. At the time of transmission, the master faces north in a quiet chamber. With the left hand, the master invites the scripture and holds it, while the disciple, with the right hand, receives the covenant of faith, vowing not to recklessly disclose it to the vulgar. The written pledge states: With the Seven Ancestors as witnesses, I pledge to uphold the heart of benevolence, filial piety, and great compassion, aspiring only to ascend as a flying immortal to the Void, that the Seven Ancestors may escape suffering and torment, and together be reborn in heaven.

When the master finishes reading the pledge, they recite this incantation to the disciple:

The Great Simplicity is originally without substance,
The sages call it the Mysterious.
The Two Modes arise from beginning and end,
The utmost abyss of the myriad things.
The Dao’s transformations span countless kalpas,
Its revolutions like a wheel’s round.
Profound principles return to non-forgetting,
Dark contemplation responds to predestined bonds.
The Great Awakening’s supreme wisdom—
None surpasses this Dharma-wheel.
Devoted to the Dao, emulating the model, sincere in faith,
When sincerity is complete, the master shall proclaim.

If no worthy and discerning person exists in the world,
Seal it within a famous mountain.
To transmit it carelessly for mere compliance
Is to clutch a stone while crossing the Nine Springs.
You are a lord of the Great Ultimate,
Exalted above, commanding me to transmit.
The Three Realms shall memorialize this,
And the news will be heard at once in the Mysterious Capital.

Upon completion, bow six times and receive it with both hands. When receiving these ritual objects, the master must prepare a scriptural fast and purification, distributing alms to the destitute and distressed in the world with an impartial heart, without partiality.

These scriptures are always attended by thirty jade maidens and thirty jade lads, who observe the Daoist’s conduct and virtue, reporting to the Supreme Lord. How can one not be cautious? How can one not be cautious?

When transmitting the scriptures, visualize the Three Primordial Lords in the Muddy Pellet Palace. The master strikes the teeth thirty-six times, then recites the incantation. The hidden annotations of the Daoist scriptures conclude here.

The Perfected of the Great Ultimate states: The various perfected ones, according to their cultivation, receive their oral instructions separately, not all at once. Thus, immortals each obtain the transmission of one matter. For partial transmissions, the token of sincerity requires one tael of gold and one hundred sheets of paper; white silk is not needed. The visualization and incantation follow the method above.

The Perfected of the Great Ultimate states: The original practice of immortals, called the *Scripture of the Dao’s Traces*, must be received from a master. Face west, using the same covenant tokens as for other scriptures, with ten feet of cinnabar-red silk to demonstrate utmost sincerity. For the *Scripture of the Dao’s Traces of the Upper Immortals*, visualize ten jade maidens and ten jade lads; for the middle immortals, five; and for the lower immortals, three. They constantly attend the transmission, burning incense to protect the disciple’s body and safeguard their household.

One must always be loyal and filial, revering the master, practicing the Four Immeasurables, enduring insults with diligence, giving alms and tolerating wrongs, avoiding contention and idle speech. Guard the will, contemplate the Dao with constant aspiration, soaring to the Great Clarity, flying to the Supreme Mystery, guided by the highest immortals—the essential ford of learning the Dao.

If one can receive the Supreme Lord’s hidden oral instructions and practice the *Great Cavern Scripture*, one is called a Great Master of the Supreme Lord. Having received the Three Cavern Scriptures, one is titled a Great Master of the Supreme Mystery Scripture. The master may then transmit the *Scriptures of the Dao’s Traces of the Various Immortals*. If one does not receive the *Scripture of the Dao’s Traces* from a master, the jade maidens will not protect them, and their practice will bring no benefit to the self.

When afflicted by illness, suffering, or demonic disturbances, one may fast and recite the *Scripture of the Dao’s Traces* in a quiet place. The hundred ghosts, specters, and misfortunes will scatter and vanish at the sound. The jade maidens and jade lads will sing praises, their voices reaching the Nine Mysteries. This delights the immortals, who come to deliver you.

The Perfected of the Great Ultimate states: Since the beginning of the kalpa, Red Pine, Wang Qiao, Xianmen, the Yellow Emperor, and Master Yin all received the five-thousand-character hidden oral instructions, diligently practicing the Great Dao. They became the foremost among the perfected. Truly, the subtlety of these annotations is essential.

By the time of Emperor Wen of Han, who delighted in and practiced the Dao with utmost sincerity and emptiness, the Supreme Perfected descended by the riverside to transform him.

The Perfected would recite the scriptures at times, yet the Emperor had not yet grasped the profound and subtle principles of the Dao’s meaning. As his heart thirsted for it, upon hearing of an extraordinary person, he leapt with joy, personally driving his chariot to bow in reverence, inquiring after their well-being, and earnestly seeking the truth of the Dao. The Perfected composed verses for him, elucidating one corner to unravel his obstructions.

The profundity of this scripture is indeed difficult to fathom—thus it is said one cannot discuss it through mere thought. Yet it was sufficient to enable Emperor Wen to ascend through the dark void, safeguard his luminous form, and ride the clouds, loosing the reins of flying dragons to ascend directly to the Celestial Hall of Golden Splendor. There, he joined the ranks of the heavenly beings in reciting and expounding the scriptures—this, too, is a stage of the immortal’s path. How joyous!

Emperor Wen practiced the scripture of the Dao and virtue, attaining such towering heights. Emperor Wu, though diligent in his pursuit of immortality, was of a rigid nature and thus only ranked among the lesser heavenly beings. The foundation of studying the Dao lies in gentleness and sincerity.

When one recites a single chapter of the *Riverbank Perfected*, it resonates through the Jade Capital of the Supreme, and all the immortals of the heavens clasp their hands in praise, their voices echoing across the Three Realms. The Demon Kings pay homage in the hall, while the lords of Fengdu bow in reverence, prostrating before the Dharma Master. The *Riverbank Perfected* is the Dharma Master of the *Dao and Its Virtue*, and thus his verses are held in the highest esteem.

The secret Dao of cultivating the body must not be shown to the vulgar, for they often mock this scripture as empty and fantastical, claiming it cannot lead to transcendence or deliver the world. Yet each person’s fate is bound by their past karma, and it cannot be forcibly taught. If the teaching fails, both teacher and student incur fault—thus it must be deeply guarded and kept secret.

The Perfected of the Great Ultimate states: When paying homage to this scripture, focus your heart on the Supreme Lord Lao, bow three times, then invoke Master Yin and the *Riverbank Perfected* as the Dharma Masters of the Mystic Realm, bowing three times more, all while facing the scripture. Thirty-six thousand jade lads and jade maidens constantly attend the scripture, burning incense and scattering flowers to summon the host of immortals, beseeching for your undying life and the Dao of ascending to heaven in broad daylight.

The Perfected of the Great Ultimate states: When a Daoist refines the Golden Elixir, reciting this scripture day and night delights the Great One, who will come to your chamber. It repels ghosts and averts inauspicious omens, ensuring all your endeavors succeed.

The Perfected of the Great Ultimate states: The foundation of studying the Dao lies in fasting and abstinence. One must fast when reciting scriptures, collating scriptures, transcribing scriptures, writing talismans, compounding medicines, refining the Golden Elixir, engaging in profound contemplation, seeking instruction from a master, performing rites, receiving scriptures, healing illnesses, dispelling misfortune, or summoning the Perfected. Fasting is revered by the Supreme, cherished by Lord Lao, and relied upon by all the sages. There are many methods of fasting, and it is for the practitioner to choose and uphold them.

The Perfected of the Great Ultimate states: Long ago, when I studied the Dao, I received this teaching from the Supreme Perfected and practiced it faithfully. Now I transmit it to you. Guard it well and cultivate it in secret, discreetly teaching it to those of later generations who possess the karmic destiny to ascend as immortals. Is this not fitting?

The Perfected of the Great Ultimate states: Those who are born into the gate of immortals and sages, delighting in the Dao and scriptures, with gentle natures and compassionate hearts—all have met their destined karmic conditions in this life. Their path to transcendence is near, and they should diligently engage in the Dharma practices to surely ascend as immortals.

The Perfected of the Great Ultimate states: One who possesses the auspicious marks of an immortal must cultivate a compassionate heart toward all things to perfect those marks—only then can they attain transcendence. If one cannot restrain their nature and tolerate others’ faults, their immortal marks will be ruined. This saying is true. Be cautious, reflect upon it, and uphold it—these words are of utmost importance.

The Perfected of the Great Ultimate states: I possess the *Nine Heavens Yellow Plain Hidden Instructions*, which I transmit to others. It may also be called *The Cavern-Real Majestic Rites*, *The Fundamental Canon of the Dharma Wheel’s Supreme Hidden Instructions*, *The Supreme Jade Purity Inner Teachings*, *The Supreme Three Caverns Majestic Rites Canon*, or *The Supreme Jade Canon’s Great Ultimate Hidden Annotations*. These are transmitted only to those destined by past karma to become Supreme Jade Capital’s Mystic Capital’s Great Non-Being’s Great Ultimate Immortal Lords, Immortal Kings, Immortal Earls, and Immortal Ministers. They are not imparted to beginning Daoist students. If one in the world encounters a master of this scripture, it is because their name is already inscribed in gold in the Mystic Capital. The Perfected of the Great Ultimate states: When a Daoist upholds the Supreme Canon, should their heart and mouth align? They must regard others as themselves, revere their master as a father, crave the scriptures as one parched, contemplate relieving hardship, admonish and encourage goodness, harmonize and tolerate faults, cherish those of the Dao, distance themselves from fondness for mountains and waters, and constantly practice a compassionate heart. A Daoist who remains humble in honor, endures hardship without wavering in resolve—such a one may be spoken to of the Dao. To them, the hidden annotations should be revealed. If one adorns themselves with elegance while heart and mouth diverge, the precious instructions should be concealed and forever secluded. Three years after receiving the scripture, their conduct may be observed, and their worthiness discerned. Thus, this canon may be hidden from those destined for lesser transcendence, and rarely seen even by middling immortals. If one’s past-life merits were insufficient to uphold the great Dharma, their name is not recorded in the Supreme Jade Capital’s Mystic Capital, and they will never encounter a master of this scripture. Should one recklessly show the instructions to another, they will fail to ascend as an immortal, die as a lowly ghost, and suffer torment in the Three Bureaus’ earthly hells. In later lives, they will be reborn among the six afflictions, endlessly cycling through retribution. The offense is most grave—hence it is hidden, and thus called *Hidden Annotations*.

The Perfected of the Great Ultimate states: When one purifies through fasting, abides in stillness, refines their essence in profound contemplation, recites scriptures to repent sins, burns incense, and prostrates in worship, they will behold flying transcendents. Immortal youths and jade maidens will descend into their chamber. Perhaps they will hear praise within the room, or radiant light illumine their body, or the sounds of gold and jade, the eight timbres of music—all signs that their Dao is nearing completion. Be diligent, be diligent! The Supreme will not fail you. The concern is that you may not persevere, may not exhaust the ultimate scriptures—this is why the Dao of transcendence is difficult. Always remember these words.

The Perfected of the Great Ultimate states: When I first attained transcendence, I received the *Supreme Lord’s Canon of Great Wisdom* from the Great Dao Lord. I recited it seven times, knocked my teeth thrice, swallowed saliva thrice, and visualized the Three Primordial Sovereigns in the Golden Flower Palace, like infants, chanting this text. The original *Canon of Wisdom* contains thirty-one thousand words. The Supreme Sages extracted this chapter for those destined to become Supreme Jade Capital’s Great Ultimate Immortal Lords and Daoist adepts. Now I shall reveal it to you—how could you not wish to hear it?

**Hymn to the Supreme Canon of Wisdom**

The Supreme’s Mystic Void is its foundation,
The great Dao exalts its canon.
Through reverence and reflection, one attains transcendence,
Enduring kalpas without number.
Majestic is the Perfected’s virtue,
Serene, for it arises from non-being.
Celestial radiance weaves empty structures,
Riding the void, naturally journeying.
Sun and moon blaze brightly,
In peace and harmony, joy unending.
The transcendent severs ornate thoughts,
Each念 accumulates in succession.
Coming and going disturb my spirit,
Restless, it cannot endure.
Extinguish念, dwell in tranquil emptiness,
Whispering, enter stillness.
Seek the canon as one starving or parched,
Hold fast to your resolve like metal or stone.
Preserve your flight on the mystic path,
The Five Numinous Ones bestow talismanic registers.
They ferry me through the Six Perfections,
Thus dissolving the Three Nets.
Purify through fasting, worship the Primordial Simplicity,
Exhale and inhale to nurture cloud-teeth.
Wander within the Golden Gates,
The Jade Capital is my home.
Naturally, the Seven Treasures arise,
Each person seated upon a lotus.
Above, they chew the Mystic Capital’s jujubes,
Below, they savor the hollow melons.
Their countenance outshines ten suns,
What matter the kalpas’ multitude?
The Dharma drum summons celestial transcendents,
The tolling bell subdues great demons.
A divine wind fans fragrant blossoms,
Resplendent, unfurling lush robes.
The Perfected strum cloud zithers,
The assembled transcendents pluck numinous lutes.
Refined songs resound in the Three Heavens,
Dispersing wisdom in the Jade Flower Grove.
Seven generations ascend the Hall of Blessings,
Thus treading the mystic tones.
If past-life virtue was insufficient,
This canon remains distant and hard to find.
If faith in the Dao is not wholehearted,
Aspiring to flight, one sinks instead.
The Supreme’s non-action is the Dao,
Its vastness resides in the heart’s portents.
To learn the Dao, trust in cinnabar sincerity,
Revere your master as kin.
Suppress desires, embrace emptiness,
Diligently renew yourself each day.
Until all beings are delivered,
I shall not deliver myself.
Great vows merit profound recompense,
Mystic virtue is surely thus.
Hidden evils incur deep sins,
Their retribution turns like a wheel.
Learning the Dao is arduous,
Morning and night, cultivate the field of blessings.
Planting virtue is like planting trees—
Deep roots yield abundant fruit.
If you can delight in the profound,
Swiftly you will ascend to the pure heavens.
Cultivate this non-action Dao,
And you will form bonds with goodness.
The Supreme expounds the ultimate Dao,
Inscribing it as the *Chapter of Wisdom*.
To relieve suffering, one must possess great talent,
Transcending the mundane to attain the real.
Their numinous bearing is rare in the world,
Resplendent as a lotus in the abyss.
Each person’s conduct has its roots,
All stem from past-life merits.
Establish virtue while time permits,
Make vows—none will go unanswered.
Good and evil both await retribution,
Their interdependence is unfathomable.
The worthy uphold the Dharma’s words,
Virtue and Dao reside in forgetting both.
To comprehend this is great wisdom,
Ascending as a Great Ultimate Lord.
A jeweled canopy connects to the jade chariot,
Commanding a carriage drawn by nine dragons.
Golden Flower holds the Cavern Canon,
Immortal youths bear incense.
Whistling and singing, they pierce the Mystic Capital,
Jade chimes strike the jasper bells.
They rise, soaring through the Great Clarity,
Transcending radiance, roaming the Purple Empyrean.
Upholding the Dharma’s net,
They wander the mystic ultimate in freedom.
Ten thousand kalpas are like last night,
A thousand springs like dawn.
Towering, they shade the cloud blossoms,
Their hands cradle the branches of the Treasure Grove.
Incense smoke arises naturally,
The mystic stairs ascend in whirlwinds.
Spiritual banners disperse with the wind,
Excessive thoughts vanish in due time.

Extinguishing wisdom, they magnify the great undifferentiated,
In non-action they chant the pure hymn.
The Supreme Clarity’s *Hidden Annotations to the Jade Canon of the Great Ultimate* concludes.
