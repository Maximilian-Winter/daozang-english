**The Supreme Clarity Scripture of the Cinnabar Prime and Jade Perfection Emperor Sovereign’s Ascension to Immortality**

The Dao of the Supreme Clarity’s Cinnabar Prime and Jade Perfection Emperor Sovereign, the method of the Wondrous Spirit of Rosy Terrace and the Jade Consort’s ambrosial nourishment, was concealed within the Supreme Clarity’s Palace of the Rosy Terrace and Imperial Ultimate. Inscribed upon jade tablets, it was bestowed upon those destined to become perfected persons. To practice this Dao, one must purify the body and withdraw to distant peaks, cleanse the heart and retreat into secluded groves. With spirit and qi merged as one, observe a pure fast for thirty days, and only then proceed. After fifteen years of such practice, the Dao is accomplished, and one becomes a Perfected Person of Supreme Clarity.

Furthermore, one must refine gold and craft cinnabar offerings to present to the scripture master, demonstrating the covenant of secrecy. Only then may one follow the instructions to cultivate and refine, thereby inducing the descent of purple qi, the Jade Consort’s ascent to one’s chamber, the radiant clarity of the five viscera, the golden fortification of the hundred limbs, the embrace of the body by rosy clouds, the reception of the Jade Emperor’s scripture, and the flight to ascend to Supreme Clarity.

Each dawn, at sunrise, go to the courtyard, burn incense, and arrange the mat. Strike the teeth twenty-four times, then perform nine bows to assume the position. Press the hands upon the knees, wait for the qi to settle and the mind to stabilize, and intensely visualize the sun’s center emitting flowing light and rosy mist stretching nine million *zhang*, descending from the sun to illuminate one’s body. After a long while, draw in the essence of the rosy mist, swallowing it forty-nine times into the abdomen. Perceive the five viscera fusing and reflecting light, the inner and outer body aglow, the spirit beholding purple mist connecting endlessly with the heavens. Then strike the teeth nine times and pray with the heart:

*"O Great Spirit of Primordial Essence,
Purple mist arises in profusion,
Golden light coils and revolves,
Bathing and refining my form.
The dust of the corpse dissolves,
Uniting with the Dao in spirit.
Grant me penetrating insight,
To ascend to the Great Veil of Supreme Clarity."*

Next, visualize at the root of the sun’s descending purple mist and flowing light a female figure like an infant, her head adorned with a three-cornered cloud-topped bun, wearing a cinnabar kerchief. She is clad in a brocade robe of splendor, jade pendants at her waist, and holds the Jade Perfection Purple Mist Talisman of the Sun Emperor. She flies upon the mist, stepping toward you. Focus the mind intensely, allowing no lapse, and secretly pray:

*"Supreme Clarity’s Cinnabar Prime, Wondrous Spirit of Rosy Terrace, Jade Consort of Rosy Splendor,
Whose taboo name is Yu Dongzhu,
Whose style is Jing Mingying."*

Repeat this thrice, then say:

*"May my body ride the purple mist,
Ascend to the Sun Palace,
Feast upon the Jade Clarity,
And share the Dao’s eternal age."*

Next, visualize the Jade Consort taking your left hand with her right, lifting your form to fly upon the purple mist and flowing light, soaring into the sun. After a long while, sense a slight warmth in your body and perceive your form within the sun’s gathered light. Then behold the Supreme Clarity’s Cinnabar Prime and Jade Perfection Emperor Sovereign seated upon purple clouds within the sun, his form like an infant’s. He wears a red brocade robe adorned with jade, a belt of five luminous moon pearls, and holds a crimson sun in his mouth. The sun emits nine rays, each ray purple in hue, with a jade essence suspended from each, shaped like a chicken’s egg and the size of a pellet. The radiant rays extend downward, about nine *cun* in length. The jade essences display nine colors: purple, cinnabar, azure, white, yellow, jasper, green, dark blue, and dark green. The jade essences revolve, their luminous qi swirling.

Next, visualize the Jade Consort to the Emperor Sovereign’s right, your form kneeling before him. Perform nine bows with the heart and pray:

*"Supreme Clarity’s Cinnabar Prime and Jade Perfection Emperor Sovereign, Supreme Perfected Lord of the Dao,
Whose taboo name is Long Jingteng,
Whose style is Jiang Xilu."*

Repeat this thrice. Then visualize yourself tilting your head back to receive the jade essences with your mouth. Begin with the dark green jade, drawing its essence into your mouth, sensing a slight warmth, and visualize swallowing it into the lower cinnabar field. Next, visualize the dark blue jade’s essence entering the cinnabar field, the green jade’s essence settling in the Hall of Light, and the jasper jade’s essence entering the Grotto Chamber. Visualize these four jade essences suspended in their positions, glowing brightly like the sun. Then let the purple essence enter the left kidney (for women, the right kidney), the cinnabar essence enter the heart, the azure essence enter the liver, the white essence enter the lungs, and the yellow essence enter the spleen. Let them enter your five viscera, the jade light intermingling, unifying form and spirit.

Strike the teeth nine times, visualize your form before the Emperor Sovereign, and pray:

*"Mysterious transformation of numinous rays,
Nine jade spirit essences,
Sun Perfected Emperor Sovereign,
King of the Supreme Dao.
Purple mist surges and pours,
Hall of Light and Grotto Chamber,
Refining my five viscera,
Spontaneously generating jade chimes.
Precious marrow and cinnabar liquid,
Clouds soar on high."*

Suddenly, forget your form, merging into one within the sun. After a long while, the practice concludes, and you become unaware of your seat, returning to the state as if in the sun.

At noon, sit facing south within the chamber. Press the hands upon the knees and visualize the sun’s center emitting cinnabar mist stretching nine hundred *chi*, flowing from the sun’s edge to connect with your body, its light resplendent. Visualize the Jade Consort of Rosy Splendor holding a purple jade jar, stepping upon the mist to descend before you. Then visualize and pray, reciting her taboo name and style as before, repeating thrice.

Next, see the Jade Consort place the jade jar to your mouth. Visualize the jar containing yellow jade ambrosia and drink it, stopping after nine mouthfuls. Visualize the jade ambrosia surging like clouds, suffusing the five viscera, and your entire body emanating crimson light. Then pray:

*"Lofty Perfected of Rosy Splendor,
Spirit of the Sun Emperor,
Wielding wondrous transformations,
Guiding and riding the sun’s spirits.
Jade jar of yellow ambrosia,
Feasting upon the sun’s numen.
Blossoming within the five viscera,
Prolonging distant age and renewing the jar.
My form dwells in the Rosy Terrace,
Eternally conjoined with qi."*

Next, visualize the Jade Consort bowing and lifting your form to ascend together upon the cinnabar mist, entering the sun. Clearly perceive within the sun a cinnabar jade terrace, towering and vast with a thousand layers, and a golden bed at its center. Lie upon it, the Jade Consort at your head facing south, your form facing north. Then forget your form and abide within the Rosy Terrace.

At midnight, rise and stand upon your bed, facing the moon’s location. Bow five times in your heart, and visualize within the moon a white radiance of seven million *zhang*, descending to connect with your body. Amidst the radiance stands a woman wearing a kingfisher-feathered lotus crown, clad in yellow brocade, holding a golden tray in which rests a spirit-pearl bright as the moon. Slowly she descends and stands before you.

Knock your teeth six times, then pray:

*"Golden Perfected of the Moon,
Divine Mother of the Upper Clarity,
Whose hidden name is Yue Wuting,
Whose style is Wei Niyan.
Thus thrice repeated,*
take the pearl and swallow it into your heart, allowing its light and *qi* to suffuse you entirely. Then pray:

*"Essence of gold, primal simplicity,
Spirit-pearl of utmost perfection,
Its luminous radiance secretly illumines,
Sweeping clean the dust of the heart.
The hundred spirits refine and transmute,
My *qi* merges with its brightness.
May I, with the Most High,
Dwell in form upon the Upper Clarity."*

Next, visualize the Golden Perfected Divine Mother concealing her form, becoming one with the light and radiance, while you, too, forget your form, expanding into boundless emptiness.

The *Purple Radiance Talisman of the Sun Emperor and Jade Perfected*, written in cinnabar on green silk, is placed within a crimson pouch and worn. Additionally, craft a smaller talisman, inscribed on green bamboo slips. On the first, third, fifth, seventh, ninth, thirteenth, fifteenth, seventeenth, nineteenth, twenty-third, twenty-fifth, twenty-seventh, and twenty-ninth days of the lunar month, consume one each, bowing twice toward the east before swallowing, then send it off with dark spring water.

*The Natural Writ of Jade Clarity*
Daoists who practice this Way must utterly avoid defilement, impurity, and lack of refinement.

After fifteen years of diligent practice, one receives the scriptures and becomes an Upper Clarity Perfected, gaining the ability to ride flying dragons and, accompanied by a thousand jade lads, traverse the Great Ultimate. Following the Way of the Jade Perfected Emperor and August Sovereign to ingest the jade essence within the sun, the Jade Consort drinks the golden perfection of the sun’s yellow nectar.

The method of consuming divine pearls culminates in attainment: the nine jade solar essences transform into nine elixirs, generating the adept’s spirit-qi. After fifteen years, the nine jade essences metamorphose into nine-colored divine dragons, while the essence of the divine pearl becomes a chariot of radiant light, lifting the adept’s body to ascend to Upper Clarity.

The Western Wall’s Supreme Perfected King transmitted this to the Great Mystery Perfected, Lord Mao, and the True Person of Wen River, Lord Cai, who concealed it within the Crimson Terrace of Upper Clarity’s Imperial Ultimate Palace—this is the regimen of the Emperor and August Jade Consort for refining immortality.

*The Upper Clarity Scripture of the Cinnabar Prime and Jade Perfected Emperor’s Flight to Immortality* concludes.
