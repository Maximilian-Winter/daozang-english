**The Supreme Cavern Mystery Numinous Treasure Collection of Memorial Tablets**
Compiled by Master of Simplicity Lu Xiujing

Those who receive the Numinous Treasure registers and covenants must first ascend the steps of initiation; those who submit memorial tablets and perform repentance must follow the proper sequence. For the Middle Covenant and the Great Covenant, one must cast dragon tablets. Thereafter, on the eight nodal *jiazi* days, one separately submits the Three Primordials Jade Tablets. Only then may one ascend the mountains in the four seasons to practice the affairs of the true scriptures.

The *Luminous True Jade Instructions* provides detailed explanations, yet later learners, indolent and dull, with shallow aspirations and limited understanding, encounter a single ritual and fail to study it diligently. They apply it carelessly, leading to errors—losing the beginning and end, never realizing their mistakes. Such individuals are a constant source of sorrow. Witnessing their sinking and drowning, I fear the harm to the compassionate teachings. Thus, in accordance with ancient canons, I have compiled the sequence for submitting memorial tablets, arranging them in order and annotating the methods and standards, to enlighten the ignorant and establish a model for my disciples. How could this be casually offered to the careless?

The *Instructions on the Scripture of the True One and the Natural* states: After receiving the scripture, the disciple casts ten golden rings, making an oath to the ten directions as a pledge of secrecy. These ten rings are offered to the master, and a golden dragon is released into the limpid abyss to seek the token of transcendence.

This ritual pertains to the initial reception of the *Numinous Treasure Register of the Palace of the Natural*, which, upon completion of the fivefold verification and repeated bows, is followed by the presentation of the yellow silk-wrapped scripture, called the Middle Covenant. One should cast a single dragon tablet, forging the dragon with ten rings, binding the tablet with blue silk, and submitting it to the limpid abyss. The text of the tablet follows the *Jade Instructions*, notifying the Water Officials. The ritual text is as follows.

The *Luminous True Rituals* states: Upon receiving the Ten Sections of Wondrous Scriptures of the True Writ of the Numinous Treasure from the Three Heavens, one casts three golden dragons into the water palaces, the numinous mountains, and the dwelling places—three locations in total—as a token of the pursuit of transcendence. Without this submission, the Three Officials will bind one’s life register, and petitions will not reach them.

This ritual pertains to the Great Covenant upon ascending the altar, when one wears the True Writ of the Red Script and holds the two rings and the staff. On that day, one must cast three golden dragons and twenty-seven golden rings into the three locations of mountains, waters, and dwelling places, notifying and pledging to the Three Officials. The text of the tablet follows the *Jade Instructions* as below.

The *Jade Instructions* state: On the *jiazi* days of the eight nodes, one submits the Three Primordials Jade Tablets to erase the records of past sins, reporting one’s name to Heaven. Each matter is performed three times. The Three Officials of the various heavens mutually entrust and record, distinguishing the right in the heavens above. All spirits respect and protect, and the myriad demons do not interfere.

This ritual follows the Great Covenant, submitting to the three locations of mountains, waters, and dwelling places, with three submissions per location. The first submission uses one dragon and nine rings; the subsequent two submissions use only dragons without rings. In total, nine tablets, nine dragons, and twenty-seven pairs of rings are used.

The scripture states: The mention of the eight nodal *jiazi* days is a general reference. The submission of these tablets must occur on an auspicious day and cannot be performed on other days. If the eight nodes are not encountered, another *jiazi* day may be used.

The texts of the Three Primordials Jade Tablets are as follows:
For the Middle Covenant’s casting of the dragon tablet, use this Water Tablet text. For the Great Covenant’s casting of the three dragons to pledge to the Three Officials, use all three tablet texts.

**Method for the Supreme Numinous Treasure’s Notification to the Water Emperor to Erase Sins**

The Numinous Treasure [Title] Emperor Master [or Lady] of the Clouds, Daoist So-and-so, aged [number] years, born in the [ordinal] month, aspires to the divine and to transcendence, to live forever without death, and to preserve the Three Primordials. To the Nine Palaces’ Water Emperors, the Twelve River Sources, the Jiang, Hai, Huai, and Ji rivers, and the great spirits of the netherworld, I beseech the erasure of my sinful name, that it may be reported to the Nine Heavens. I request to proceed to the Water Palace, conveyed by the golden dragon courier.

Submitted on the [day] of the [month] of the [year] at [location].

Write this in red on a silver-wood tablet, wrap the tablet in blue paper, bind it with blue silk, and let the golden dragon bear the tablet. Cast it into the abyss of the Three Rivers. For the first submission, use nine golden rings attached to the tablet; for subsequent submissions, no further rings are needed, and the three submissions are complete.

The submission should take place in the limpid abyss. First, face east, knock the teeth three times, and light the incense in the burner.

Invoke the Supreme Three Heavens’ Primordial Qi, the Most High Lord Lao: Summon forth the Three and Five Merit Officers within my body, the left and right official messengers, the left and right incense-bearers, the dragon courier riders, the jade lads attending the incense, the jade maidens transmitting words, and the thirty-six attendants of the Five Thearchs’ direct talismans. Emerge and report to the true officials of the land in the four directions here. I now burn incense and report: May the qi of the true and correct in the ten directions descend into my body, allowing my report to ascend directly to the presence of the Most High, the Perfectly True, the Great Sage, the August Thearch, and the Jade Emperor.

Next, turn to face north, knock the teeth three times, and read the Water Tablet text to its conclusion. Then recite the incantation:

The Primordial Five Elders, the August Highest Honored Ones,
The Perfectly True of the Ten Directions, the Numinous Transcendents of Mount Taihua.
The Red Script issues commands, penetrating even the hidden.
Ascending to the Nine Heavens, I request the descent of the Jade Writ.
The sun, moon, and Five Stars, the Seven Primes of the Northern Dipper.
I report to the Five Marchmounts and the numinous mountains of the four directions.
Below, I report to the rivers and seas, the Twelve Water Sources.
The Nine Palaces’ Water Emperors, the great spirits of the netherworld.
Today, I make this report above, unfolding myriad wishes.
I request the casting of the Jade Tablet to beseech the erasure of my sinful name.
My thousand ancestors and myriad forebears, the nine clans and all kin,
Whose sins have been transmitted and tainted, extending even to my body—
May all be universally erased, their roots severed.
Record my name in the Water Palace and report it before the Emperor on High.
May my seven generations of ancestors and parents depart from the Eight Difficulties,
Ascend to the Nine Heavens, and be clothed and fed by the natural.
May all sins be released and dispersed, heard by the myriad spirits.
I request the golden rings to seal the pledge with the Water Officials.
May my request be conveyed as stated, by the golden dragon courier.

Then, offer incense three times and replenish the burner.

O Fragrant Official Messengers, Lords of the Left and Right Dragons and Tigers, Bearers of the Fragrant Offering: May the naturally born golden liquid, cinnabar essence, and myriad numinous mushrooms of this very hall converge before this incense burner. May I attain the Dao and achieve transcendence, my entire household receive blessings, and the world be graced with kindness. May the jade lads and jade maidens of the ten directions attend the fragrant smoke, transmitting my words directly to the presence of the Most High, the Jade Emperor before the Golden Gates of the Jade Capital.

The Primordial Numinous Treasure announces to the Five Marchmounts and Sacred Mountains the Rite for Removing Sins and Seeking Transcendence:

Numinous Treasure [So-and-So], Emperor-Master of [Such-and-Such], your servant [Name], aged [X] years, born in the [X] month, provisionally assigned to the Red Emperor and named for the removal of Mount Huo—wishing for divine transcendence, long life, deliverance from the world, and flight to the Upper Clarity; the Perfected of the Five Marchmounts, most divine and numinous—entreat that my name be stricken from the registers of sin and inscribed in the Nine Heavens. I request to present myself at the Sacred Mountain, conveyed by the golden dragon courier.

On the [X] day of the [X] year, month, and hour, submit this document at [Such-and-Such] Marchmount. (If not at a Marchmount, state: [Such-and-Such] prefecture, county, and mountain.)

Inscribe the above in cinnabar on a silver-wood tablet, wrap it in blue paper, bind it with blue silk, affix nine golden rings and one golden dragon, and bury it at the Marchmount of one’s natal destiny, all in accordance with the above method.

Next, at the Marchmount of one’s natal destiny, face east, knock the teeth, and kindle the incense burner as prescribed.

Then knock the teeth nine times, recite the tablet to its end, and intone the incantation:

Darkly above, the Luminous opens;
The Primordial oversees the Perfected.
The Five Elders of the Lord,
Crimson script of the Vermilion Text—
Heaven and Earth’s origin,
Governor of the Three Primes.
Gathering qi and summoning assembly,
Hastening the ascent of transcendents.

I request the golden rings
To seal the pledge with the Perfected Officials.

By the golden dragon courier.

Next, offer incense three times and replenish the burner as above.

The Primordial Numinous Treasure announces to the Nine Earths and Earth Sovereigns the Rite for Extinguishing Sins and Seeking Transcendence:

Numinous Treasure, Red Emperor-Master, your servant [Name], aged [X] years, born on the [X] day of the [X] month, now registered under the Nine Heavens and governed by the Southern Dipper. (This document refers to the Red Emperor for those born in the hours of *si* or *wu*; those whose destiny number is nine are born in the first or second month; "governed by the Southern Dipper" refers to the direction of one’s natal destiny. Others born in different months follow this model.)

Wishing for divine transcendence, long life, deliverance from the world, and flight to the Upper Clarity; the Central August One of the Nine Earths, the Yellow Spirit of *wu* and *ji*, the Five Emperors of the Earth Palace—entreat that my record of sins be stricken and inscribed in the Supreme Mystery. I request to present myself at the Central Palace, deposit the tablet, and record my name, with golden rings as tokens of faith, conveyed by the golden dragon courier.

On the [X] day of the [X] month and year, submit this document at [Such-and-Such] prefecture, county, village, and hamlet.

Inscribe the above in cinnabar on a silver-wood tablet, wrap it in blue paper, bind it with blue silk, affix nine golden rings and one golden dragon, and bury it at the central palace of one’s residence, all in accordance with the above method.

Next, in the central courtyard, knock the teeth, kindle the incense burner, and face the [direction of the] king as prescribed.

Then knock the teeth twelve times, recite the tablet to its end, and intone the incantation:

Heaven unfolds, Earth extends,
Nine qi divide the numinous.
Three Primes in unison,
Ten Directions in Mysterious Clarity.
The Five Elder Lords,
Open the Perfected and govern life.
Vermilion script of the Crimson Text,
Primordial essence above.
Universally proclaimed below,
Nine Earths’ august spirits.
Today’s supplication,
Destined for transcendence by all immortals.
May I attain transcendence,
I request to deposit my jade name.
Great Sovereign of the Earth Palace,
Strike out my sentence of sin.
Present the tablet to the Upper Palace,
Inscribe it in the resplendent register.
Swiftly attain flight,
Spiritual in harmony with Heaven and Earth.
Nine clans and all kin,
Rotten bones renewed in glory.
Souls ascend to the Southern Palace,
Transformed in the transcendent courts.
Today’s proclamation,
Heard by all spirits.
I request the golden rings
To manifest the sincerity of this pledge.
May my request be conveyed as stated,
By the golden dragon courier.

Next, offer incense and replenish the burner as above.

For all who receive the Two Pledges of the Numinous Treasure and thereafter compose jade tablets, a total of seventy-four golden rings and thirteen golden dragons are required. Only after completing these rites may one proceed to compose the talismanic texts of the Vermilion Script for the Eight Nodal Days.

**Method for Presenting the Five Directions’ Perfected Texts on Tallies**

On each respective day, inscribe the tallies in the five colors, following the method above. Then ascend the mountain, first facing east and knocking the teeth, reciting the incense incantation and kindling the censer, all as in the method above.

Next, knock the teeth twelve times and recite the incantation:

O Mystic Loftiness, Exalted Spirit,
Primal Beginning, Venerable Divinity.
Great Sage meandering,
Myriad Perfected descending to the hall.
Three luminaries spread their radiance,
Auspicious clouds arrayed on four sides.
Above, report to the Inspector of Charts,
Who reckons and computes the Nine Heavens.

Presenting my tally to the numinous mountain.
Cinnabar-script in vermilion characters,
The spontaneous Perfected Text.
Above, I report to the Five Thearchs,
Recording my name in the Jade Register.

Mysteriously illumine my body.
Three Officials and Nine Bureaus,
The great gods of the Five Marchmounts.
Universally proclaim without end,
Eradicating the roots of transgression.

Receive blessings as a matter of course.

Forever parted from the Eight Perils.
May I join the Three Luminaries,
Together shining in the Purple Dawn,
The Wheel of Rebirth unceasing,
My body attaining flight as an immortal.

When the recitation of the tally is complete, cast it into the abyss of the sheer cliff, then scatter incense upon the numinous mountain. Next, knock the teeth three times and face your natal direction, reciting the incantation:

The Primal Beginning bears witness,
My immortal name already inscribed.
Three Officials and Nine Bureaus,
No transgression remains unabsolved.
Scatter incense to the Five Thearchs,
Proclaiming to the luminous Great Void.
As I have petitioned,
May I endure for ten thousand kalpas.

Then swallow the nine breaths of qi. Next, recite the incense incantation and kindle the censer as in the method above.

On the Eight Nodal Days, *jiazi* days, and one’s natal day, when performing the rites for the five directions, employ this single method.

Here ends the *Scriptures of Tallies of the Most High Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure*.
