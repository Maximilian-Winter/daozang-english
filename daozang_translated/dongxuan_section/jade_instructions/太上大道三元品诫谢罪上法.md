The *Highest Daoist Rite of the Three Primordials’ Precepts for Repentance and Expiation of Sins*
**Scripture Title:** *The Supreme Daoist Rite of the Three Primordials’ Precepts for Repentance and Expiation of Sins*

The Heavenly Worthy speaks: For all who cultivate this supreme rite, on the fifteenth day of the first, seventh, and tenth months, at the three hours of dawn, noon, and midnight, bathe the body and purify it with the five fragrances. When washing, face the southwest, and with a golden ladle, pour the fragrant water thirty-two times in a leftward circle toward the southeast. Close the eyes and visualize the sunlight above the left eye, moonlight above the right eye, the five stars entwined upon the head, and five-colored clouds swirling around the body. The Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, and Dark Warrior stand in attendance, along with lions, white cranes, immortal youths holding towels, jade maidens scattering blossoms, and flying immortals riding mounts, all guarding the body.

Then strike the teeth twenty-one times and recite the incantation:
*"The heavens are limpid, the qi is pure, the five hues resplendent.
Sun and moon radiate their brilliance, bathing my form.
Divine essences inwardly cleanse, fragrance refines my essence.
Light and radiance illumine, shining upon the Supreme Clarity.
Qi admits no dust; the five palaces receive the numinous.
Sins vanish from the Three Paths, calamities dissolve in the Nine Darknesses.
Evil roots are severed, blessings arise of themselves.
Today I make my great vow, proclaiming this covenant to all.
May my body receive deliverance and ascend to the Imperial Court."*

When finished, swallow thirty-two times while looking upward. Thus are the five spirits bathed.

After bathing, don the cap, sash, and robes. Strike the teeth twelve times and recite the incantation:
*"The Five Turbidities are now clear, the Eight Effulgences now bright.
Today I undergo refinement; sins perish and blessings arise.
Ever shall I fast with the Five Emperors, the perfected and supreme numina."*

Then exit and enter the chamber to perform the Dao according to the rite. Upon entering, face east, burn incense, strike the teeth thirty-two times, and pray:
*"Most High Three Heavens, Mysterious Primordial Three Qi, Supreme Lord Lao, summon forth from within my body the Three and Five Merit Officials, the left and right attending messengers, the left and right incense-bearing dragon-riding couriers, the jade lads who tend the incense, the jade maidens who transmit words, the Five Emperors’ direct talismans, and the incense officials of the day—thirty-two of each—to emerge. Let those who emerge don their regalia, and let the true officials and divine spirits of this land and domain be awakened. I now burn incense and perform the Dao, presenting my supplications. May I receive the qi of the ten directions’ true perfected ones into my body, that my entreaties swiftly ascend and be heard before the boundless Heavenly Worthies, the Supreme Dao, and the Most Perfect Imperial Lords."*

*"I, so-and-so, a disciple of the Most High Cavernous Mystery and Numinous Treasure, by karmic affinity of past lives, was born into the transformation of the Dao. Through the guidance of my master, the Three Caverns’ Dharma Teacher so-and-so, I was uplifted and delivered, my decayed remains refined, and the scriptures’ teachings imparted. The grace of this surpassing kindness is truly boundless. Yet I was raised in the mundane world, where my five spirits contended, and my sins and impurities ran deep, never self-aware. Growing with my transgressions, they accumulated like mountains and seas. From past lives to the present, I know not their origin, spanning countless kalpas to this day. My sins are recorded in the ledgers of heaven and earth, seized by the Three Officials, bound and consigned to earthly servitude. Though I have striven to cultivate myself, my efforts have not moved the divine; true spirits do not descend, and demonic forces assail me. My thoughts scatter, and my five spirits flee. I constantly fear that one day I shall return to the dark abyss, enmeshed for ten thousand kalpas, forever beyond deliverance. Humbly, on this auspicious day of the Three Primordials’ great celebration, I purify myself, burn incense, and first repent for the transgressions of my past lives and present deeds—sins unforgiven by heaven, unabsolved by earth, unmoved by spirits, and unrelieved by ghosts—my myriad crimes and countless faults, which violate the Three Primordials’ one hundred eighty precepts, the Three Officials’ nine bureaus and one hundred twenty offices, and the judgments of the yin-yang, water-fire, and central palace examiners. Today, I burn incense, surrendering my body, spirit, and life to the boundless Heavenly Worthy, the Supreme Dao Lord, the Thirty-Two Heavens’ Emperors, the ten directions’ great sagely hosts, the perfected lords and venerable ones, the flying heavenly kings, the heavenly, flying, divine, and earthly immortals, the true persons and jade maidens of the Five Marchmounts, the celestial bodies of the heavens, the jade pivot and balance, and all the boundless numinous officials of the ten directions, the Three Realms’ Five Emperors, the Three Officials’ nine bureaus and one hundred twenty offices, the spirits of the Three Rivers, Four Seas, Nine Rivers, and Eight Poles—beseeching your great mercy to absolve all my past and present sins. By the merit of this incense offering, may my sinful roots be eradicated. I pray that my name be stricken from the earthly registers and the black ledgers of the Right Bureau, and inscribed in the Register of Longevity in the Left Bureau of the Southern Palace, to be delivered as an immortal and enjoy boundless existence. After attaining the Dao, may I ascend into formlessness and unite with the true."*

First, bow nine times facing east and, kneeling, declare:
*"I, so-and-so, now surrender my life to the boundless Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the East, the great sagely hosts who have attained the Dao, the perfected and venerable divinities, the Supreme Clarity’s Mysterious Primordial, the boundless Three Heavens’ Supreme Dao, the Heavenly Mysterious Elder, the Supreme Lord Lao, the Supreme Venerable One, the August Supreme Lord, the August Venerable One, the Azure Numinous Perfected, the lords of the various heavens, the emperors and venerable ones of the heavens, the Supreme Emperor Lord, the Supreme Emperor Venerable One, the Nine Elders of the Immortal Capital, the Venerable One of the Nine Qi, and the myriad layers of Dao qi, the one thousand two hundred officials. Before the Jade Steps of the Supreme Clarity, the Eastern Pole Elder, the Great Azure Spirit, the Prime Minister Sima, the Azure Lad, the Golden Watchtower’s Sagely Emperor of the Latter Age, the True Yang’s Primordial Azure Divine Person, the Nine Immortals of the Numinous Treasure, the Azure Harmony Jade Maidens, the Jade Lords of the Immortal Hosts, and all the divine spirits of the Eastern Boundless Realm."*

I humbly beseech Your boundless compassion to bestow the grace of absolution. From all my past lives to this present incarnation, I have committed offenses—failing in reverence above toward the august sagely deities of the myriad heavens, all divine spirits of the Eastern Boundless Realm, the sun, moon, and stellar lodges, the four seasons and five phases, wind and rain, thunder and lightning, clouds and mists in their due seasons; failing in reverence below toward my masters and elders, the perfected ones of the Five Marchmounts, Four Seas, Three Rivers, Nine Jiang, and Eight Poles, the jade maidens and divine immortals, the numinous officials of the Eastern Realm, the earth deities of the Three Realms, and all divine spirits of the Three Bureaus and Nine Offices.

I have deceived my masters and betrayed the Dao, defiled the celestial scriptures, stolen sacred texts, altered divine sounds, disseminated the supreme Dharma for personal gain, privately transmitted teachings without sanction, broken covenants with the Five Thearchs, plotted rebellion, acted without loyalty, compassion, filial piety, kindness, or benevolence; rebelled against sovereign and father, slaughtered living beings, seized others’ possessions, violated others’ wives, committed incest, colluded with clansmen, envied those superior to me, contended for fame and rank, harbored deceit in speech, slandered the worthy, consumed wine and meat, polluted the five spirits, uttered curses and imprecations, acted without cause, disrupted fasts on auspicious days with capricious joy and anger, disdained the orphaned and widowed, abandoned the elderly, oppressed the poor, and fawned upon the powerful.

Such transgressions are beyond count, accumulated over lifetimes, deeply entrenched and unresolved. Today, as I burn incense and submit my fate to the East, I beseech Your boundless compassion to absolve all sins committed from past kalpas to this present life, as enumerated above. Grant me a new beginning, that I may reform from this day forth, adhere to the precepts, and dare not transgress again.

I beseech the erasure of my name from the Three Bureaus’ registers of sin, the Black Ledgers of the Right Palace, and the roots of karmic retribution, and its inscription in the Azure Records of the Left Mansion. On this day of great celebration, I lay forth ten thousand vows, humbly confessing and repenting, submitting my fate to the Heavenly Worthy. I pray to the divine spirits and immortals to unite with me in a shared destiny, fostering auspicious affinities, that in life after life without end, I may eternally partake of the natural blessings.

This done, I remove my headscarf, kowtow, and strike my breast, each ninety times, ceasing thereafter.

Having rendered thanks to the East, I rise, turn left, and bow once toward the southeast, kneeling to declare:
I, [Name], now submit my fate to the Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Southeastern Boundless Realm, the great sagely hosts who have attained the Dao, the perfected and august deities, the Southern Elder Lord, the Cinnabar Numinous Elder, the Southern Pole’s Upper Prime Perfected of Everlasting Life, the Controller of Salvation Sima, the Lords of Life and Destiny, the Life-Preserving Lord Han, the Great Sage Divine King of Resurrecting the Dead and Restoring the Spirit through Bone Refinement, the Lord of Myriad Blessings, the Venerable One of Myriad Blessings, the Jade Maidens of Supreme Harmony, and all divine spirits of the Southeastern Boundless Realm.
I beseech grace and render thanks as in the Eastern rite.
This done, I kowtow and strike my breast, each twelve times, ceasing thereafter.

Having rendered thanks to the Southeast, I rise, turn left, and bow thrice toward the South, kneeling to declare:

I beseech grace and render thanks as in the preceding rite.
This done, I kowtow and strike my breast, each twelve times, ceasing thereafter.

Having rendered thanks to the Southwest, I rise, turn left, and bow seven times toward the West, kneeling to declare:
I, [Name], now submit my fate to the Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Western Boundless Realm, the great sagely hosts who have attained the Dao, the perfected and august deities, the Supreme Thearch of the Western Florescence and Supreme Mystery of the Boundless Dao, the True Mother of Golden Hall and Jade Immortals, the Sagely Emperor Lord of the Golden Watchtower’s Latter Age, the Primordial Heavenly Master, the Lord of Myriad Sages and Dao, the Perfected of the Four Poles, the jade maidens and divine immortals, and all divine spirits of the Western Boundless Realm.
I beseech grace and render thanks as in the preceding rite.

I humbly beseech forgiveness for the transgressions and debts accrued since my birth—offenses that have offended the celestial radiance, bringing karmic retribution in life and death.

May I be absolved and pardoned.

The thanks are offered in accordance with the rites for the Eastern Marchmount."*

The ritual concluded, the merits of the rites are declared. All officials simultaneously turn east, kneel upright, and click their teeth twenty-four times. They recite their received titles in full, prostrate themselves twice, and make their report:
*"To the Most High, Boundless, and Supreme Dao; the Most High Lord of the Dao; the Most High Lord Lao; the Most High Venerable One; the Supreme Mysterious Elder; the Boundless Dao of the Ten Directions; the Heavenly Worthies of the Dao and Virtue; the Most Perfect and Great Emperor; the Celestial Emperor; the Heavenly Master Lord; and the Great Dharma Master of the Numinous Treasure who Oversees the Retreat—
We, your humble servants, though base and unworthy, have loved the Dao and delighted in immortality. By error, we have received the duties of this office and ascended to the Nine Mysteries, yet our aspirations are feeble and our abilities meager. Still, we offer ourselves wholly, joining hands to fulfill our roles.
On this day of [date] at [hour], in the [prefecture], [county], [township], and [village], we have established the retreat, burned incense, recited scriptures, meditated upon the deities, and contemplated the Perfected Ones. For [number] days and nights, at [hour], we have performed the rites of repentance and thanksgiving.
The rites now complete, we report to the Flying Immortals, Heavenly Immortals, Earthly Immortals, and the celestial cavalry of the Five Directions; to the jade lads and maidens who attend the scriptures and incense; to the officials of the Numinous Treasure; to the Perfected Ones who oversee the retreat; and to the divine immortals who monitor the Five Marchmounts, Four Waterways, and Four Directions. May they return to their true palaces, ascend in rank among the immortals, receive imperial titles commensurate with their stations, and be appointed as Perfected Ones according to their merits, in accordance with the rites of the Great Perfected."*

May we, your servants, seek the Dao and attain the Dao, seek immortality and attain immortality. May we divide our forms and transform in seventy-four directions, with the Three Primes descending to summon green chariots, soaring through the Upper Clarity, ascending the radiance of the Nine Heavens, sharing splendor with the sun and moon, and aligning the wheels of the Three Treasures.

We humbly beseech the Most Sacred to oversee our cinnabar sincerity. Yet our study of the Dao remains incomplete, and the rites of fasting and purification are difficult to perfect. We fail to conform to the proper forms, transgressing in our conduct and violating the statutes, thus incurring the scrutiny of the Four Offices, the jurisdiction of the Five Emperors, and accumulating a thousand transgressions and ten thousand sins. We beg for your forgiveness and pardon.

Alas, we were ignorant and unaware, blind to our offenses and punishments. May the Five Body Perfected Officials within us ascend to the Mysterious Capital in accordance with their merits, complete their duties, and return to our bodies, ascending with us to soar through the Great Void. We respectfully report this and await your decree. With utmost reverence and trepidation, we bow twice in prostration.

The rites concluded, we proceed leftward to the west, then face east to offer incense thrice, reciting the incantation:

*"Incense Officials and Messengers, Lords of the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger, Courier Dragon Riders bearing incense: may our quiet chamber and fasting hall generate spontaneous golden liquid, cinnabar essence of the hundred spirits, and intermingling mushroom blossoms before this incense flame. May we attain the Dao and achieve divine immortality, our entire household receiving blessings, all above and below granted grace. May the jade lads and maidens of the ten directions attend the incense smoke, conveying our petition directly to the presence of the Boundless Supreme Great Dao."*

The Heavenly Worthy declared: *"This Three Primes Sincere Repentance Rite is the supreme method. Within the Three Primes’ palaces, conceal your form and spirit, refine the roots of transgression, and cultivate the Dao to ascend as immortals. Scholars should perform this thrice yearly. In its practice, let the cinnabar of the heart and the intent be exhausted, spirit and form enduring together without weariness or fatigue. Thus shall you move the myriad heavens, the Three Primes erase your sins from the Black Register, the Northern Emperor remove death and grant life, the Three Offices endorse your merit, and the Supreme Mystery record you among the immortals.*

*Those who seek the Dao must endure hardship to penetrate the depths, cultivate cinnabar to move the spirits, persevere to achieve, accumulate merit to attain, uphold resolve to prevail, and dedicate the heart to succeed. Let the body labor at the outset so the spirit may rejoice in the end, ultimately attaining non-action and entering spontaneity.*

*Yet those stained by sin covet treasures and worldly pleasures, indulging in fleeting glory, unaware of their inevitable end—returning to suffering, mired in the Three Offices, forever sinking through ten thousand kalpas, with no hope of return. Thus do the wise and foolish differ in their aspirations. The foolish value beginnings, while the wise esteem endings. The divergence between wisdom and folly—how can it be described?"*

The Heavenly Worthy continued: *"For scholars, on the most auspicious days of the Three Primes, refine yourselves with fragrant waters, bathe the Five Spirits, so that qi becomes serene and form upright, spirit refreshed and truth conjoined. The body shall not receive filth, qi shall not gather dust, the Three Passes shall be purified and emptied, and no evil shall intrude. The Three Fields and Eight Sceneries shall be luminous within the body. Through ingestion, guiding, and leading, the Five Palaces shall be suffused, filling inner and outer, all attaining immortality. The superior shall soar, riding radiance and clouds; the middling shall conceal and transform, sitting in stillness or standing in dissolution; the inferior shall transcend mortality, becoming Wheel-Turning Sage Kings, extinguished yet enduring, ultimately achieving divine immortality. This method is lofty and wondrous, subtle and difficult to surpass. I now reveal it to you—apply it with diligence."*

The Dao Lord bowed and reverently received these essential words.

The Heavenly Worthy declared: *"Those who have accumulated study yet failed to attain the Dao are burdened by their own karmic debts, reported by the Three Offices, detained by the Nine Bureaus, and examined by the one hundred twenty left and right investigating officials. Their evil roots unsevered, demonic forces assail them, causing the Five Spirits to contend, the body to unwittingly transgress, sins and impurities to accumulate daily, and the divine immortals to depart. Though they encounter myriad methods, their karmic roots remain uncut, their efforts in vain, and they gain nothing until death.*

*Now, on the great auspicious day of the Three Primes’ celebration, as the chariots of the myriad heavens return and the host of sages assemble, the records of life and death, merit and transgression are reviewed. The Dao’s universal compassion nurtures all beings. Those whose names enter the register of death are bound for kalpas, forever entangled, with no hope of liberation. To study without benefit—how grievous!*

*Thus, I open the Purple Yang Jade Case and reveal the Three Primes Sincere Repentance Rite to deliver scholars, perfect their merit, and proclaim the celestial statutes. For those who have not yet attained the Dao, regardless of the measure of their merit or transgression, let all with sincerity receive this great method, erase their names from the sin registers, and inscribe them in the immortal rolls. From this day forth, I universally proclaim to the myriad heavens: without distinction of high or low, deep or distant, great or small, boundless or limitless, hidden or obscure, silent or resounding, in the profound and mysterious communion of the Great Wisdom Origin, the Three Offices, Nine Bureaus, one hundred twenty investigating officials, and all divine spirits shall comply and obey."*

Thereupon, the host of great sages of the myriad heavens, the boundless honored deities, and the Supreme Dao Lord all rose as one, raising their hands to address the assembly, snapping their fingers in approval.

At that moment, the Heavenly Worthy opened the great mercy of universal pardon. All male and female beginners among the heavenly hosts reverently practiced the great method, immediately receiving deliverance, their bodies attaining divine immortality, ascending in broad daylight to the imperial palaces. Those of virtuous heart and devout faith who respectfully followed this method were all delivered, transcending the wheel of life and death without undergoing earthly trials. With merit perfected and virtue fulfilled, they attained the Dao of immortality, their ranks equal to the flying heavens, roaming the ten directions.

The Heavenly Worthy declared: *"On the most auspicious days of the Three Primes, practicing the Three Primes Sincere Repentance Rite will prompt the Three Offices and Nine Bureaus to separately record your names, the Five Emperors to endorse your merit, and your names to be listed among the heavens. The host of immortals shall rejoice, the myriad spirits shall grant pardon, karmic debts shall be dispersed, sinful roots universally dissolved, and the Three Assemblies moved. The Three Offices, Nine Bureaus, and one hundred twenty investigating officials shall erase your names from the Black Registers, sever karmic roots, inscribe your names in the Left Contract and Azure Record, with the myriad spirits in attendance, the Three Realms’ officials in welcome, demonic forces subdued, a thousand calamities averted, and the Dao’s truth naturally arising—thus attaining divine immortality."*

The Supreme Great Dao’s Three Primes Precepts Repentance Rite of Supreme Merit is here concluded.
