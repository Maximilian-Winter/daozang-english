**The Upper Clarity Scripture of Resolving Transgressions**

**First: The Eight Seasonal Days of Repentance by the Perfected Lord Pei of Pure Numinosity**

The Perfected Lord Pei of Pure Numinosity said: The Perfected Lord of the Great Ultimate regularly gathers with immortals at the Palace of the Great Ultimate on the noon of the *Lichun* (Beginning of Spring) day to inscribe jade tablets with the names of immortals.

On the midnight of that same evening, facing due north and gazing toward the North Star, one bows twice, prostrates, and confesses the number of one’s transgressions, seeking absolution. After stating one’s intent, one bows twice again and ceases.

On the noon of the *Chunfen* (Spring Equinox) day, the Perfected Lords of the Jade Terrace of Kunlun and the Great Simplicity gather with all immortal officials to establish the true scriptures.

On the noon of the *Lixia* (Beginning of Summer) day, the Five Emperors of the Upper Clarity convene with all immortals at the Purple Tenuity Palace to meet the Four Perfected Lords and deliberate the merits and transgressions of those seeking the Dao.

On the noon of the *Xiazhi* (Summer Solstice) day, the Three Officials of Heaven gather with the Controller of Destinies and the River Marquis to assess the sins and blessings of all people, adding or subtracting years from their lifespans.

On the noon of the *Liqiu* (Beginning of Autumn) day, the Perfected Lords of the Five Marchmounts visit the Yellow Elder Lord at the Yellow Chamber Cloud Court Mountain to convene with immortal officials at noon and determine the divine charts and numinous medicines of the world.

On the noon of the *Qiufen* (Autumn Equinox) day, the Supreme August Emperor ascends the Upper Clarity Numinous Watchtower of the Great Tenuity Palace to meet with the Three Elder Lords of the Most High, the Perfected Lords of the Northern Culmen, the Great Spirits of the Eight Seas, the Venerable Immortal Officials of the Five Marchmounts, and the myriad immortals. Together, they deliberate the sins and blessings of all beings under heaven, recording the diligence or negligence of Dao-seekers, itemizing each detail, and submitting them to the Controller of Destinies.

On the noon of the *Lidong* (Beginning of Winter) day, the Perfected Lord of the Yang Terrace gathers with immortal officials and jade maidens to newly determine and register the names of those who have just attained the Dao and entered the ranks of immortals.

On the noon of the *Dongzhi* (Winter Solstice) day, all the Perfected and Immortals proceed to the Eastern Flower Palace of the Square Cauldron to visit the Azure Lad of the Eastern Sea and inscribe the names of all immortals in the golden register of the immortal roster.

Regularly, on the evenings, midnights, and noons of the eight seasonal days, one repents for the sins of one’s seven generations of ancestors and parents, as well as one’s own transgressions. By doing so, the names of these transgressions are erased. With prolonged practice, one becomes an immortal who does not die.

On the days of the Autumn and Spring Equinoxes, the Most High and the Perfected observe and deliberate the affairs of the myriad immortals. Those who are not truly upright must not lightly use these days for repentance.

The Perfected and Immortal Officials gather at noon on the eight seasonal days, and absolution is granted only after three days. Those who wish to cultivate the Dao must first purify themselves through fasting and not neglect this practice.

The fifth instruction received by Ziyuan from Master Jiang teaches that on the eight seasonal days, one should meditate and confess the number of transgressions committed since one’s birth, sincerely presenting one’s case in the hope that the Heavenly August and the Perfected will record one’s protection, enabling one to reform and return to goodness, thereby seeking long life and immortality.

The Autumn Equinox is a day when qi resides in pure emptiness, the true day of Great Harmony. On this day, all the Perfected and Immortals hear petitions.

Moreover, the immortal officials of the Earthly Bureau of Censorious Clerks and the various departments impeach and report the merits and transgressions of Daoists in their respective regions, as well as the sins and life-and-death matters of all people.

*The True Record of Immortal Taboos* states:
*"If you wish to ascend to heaven, be cautious on the Autumn Equinox;
Sins great and small are all heard above.
Seeking immortality with sins is most difficult—
Thus, those who study the Dao grow cold at heart."*

These are the essential words of Master Zhongyang of the Vermilion Fire Cinnabar Mound.

On the Autumn Equinox, qi is harmonized at noon, aligning with Heaven and Earth. The great fiery qi is subdued by the withering force, while the dark water envelops the essence, nurtured within the palace of metal’s birth. Thus, the radiance of the Great Yang shifts to the Lesser Yang, storing and nourishing Heaven and Earth. At this juncture, the boundaries of hardness and softness are determined, the sequences of the two images are united, and luminous brilliance is manifested. The three luminaries of yin and yang are distinguished, marking the standard days of the eight seasons and the essential ladder for seeking the Dao.

Each time this day arrives at noon, the Jade August Emperor, the Supreme August Emperor, ascends the Vast Cold Upper Clarity Numinous Abode, the Crimson City Purple Terrace of the Celestial Watchtower in the Great Void, where the multitudes of Perfected gather at the Terrace of the Great Tenuity. Above, they open the gates of the Nine Heavens to summon the Perfected August Ones of the Nine Heavens; in the middle, they invite the Three Elder Lords of the Most High and the Perfected Lords of the Northern Culmen; and below, they command the Perfected of the Five Marchmounts and the famous mountains who have attained immortality. The myriad numinous and august ones convene at the Palace of the Vast Yang to collectively deliberate and determine the sins and blessings of all people under heaven, recording the diligence or negligence of those who study the Dao and seek immortality. They itemize the days of transgressions, the measures of good and evil in cultivation, the forms of rewards and punishments, and the conditions of life and death, each according to their respective departments and origins, and submit them to the Controller of Destinies. These are inscribed in the August Register, where sins and blessings, no matter how minute, are carved into the registers of the Crimson City. Hidden crimes and secret virtues, no matter how slight, are all distinctly known.

On the midnight of that evening, one should go to the central courtyard, face north, gaze toward the North Star, remove one’s headscarf, bow twice, prostrate, and kneel to reverently address the Most High, the August Emperor of the Northern Culmen. One secretly repents for the sins of one’s seven generations of ancestors and parents, and confesses the number of transgressions committed since one’s birth, beseeching pardon and vowing from this day forward to reform past wrongs and cultivate future goodness. One’s words must be sincere, one’s oaths engraved in the cinnabar heart, and one’s pledges sworn before Heaven and Earth, never daring to commit evil deeds again.

One should express these words with utmost sincerity. With prolonged practice, one becomes an immortal who does not die.

Upon completion, one says:
*"May the Most High Emperor erase my name from the record of sins and transfer the document to the Three Officials, allowing my name to be inscribed in the jade roster of immortals, attaining long life, eternal vision, communion with the Perfected, and penetration to the numinous."*

Upon completion, one kowtows four times, bows again, and returns to the quiet chamber, deeply reproaching oneself while visualizing the spirits of the Three Origins, causing them to ascend and report to the Most High. Doing this thrice inscribes one’s name in the register of immortals and erases all sins and transgressions.

The Three Origins refer to the spirits of the Mud-Pill Palace, Crimson Palace, and Cinnabar Field. By visualizing the Three Origins and their spirits, one petitions the Heavenly Worthy, beseeching mercy and aid in ensuring one’s words ascend and are heard. After three petitions on the Autumn Equinox, the register of life is fixed, and the name of death is removed.

This method derives from the *Scripture of the Azure Chart*, a secret art of longevity. Though common folk may favor the Dao, they remain entangled in the human realm, where transgressions abound and violations are manifold. Thus, the Autumn Equinox method of confessing faults may not yet be applicable. Only by entering the mountains and forests, distancing oneself from worldly affairs, dwelling in solitude, and refraining from harming all things may one perform it. Having sworn oaths of repentance and vows of reform, one’s words have reached the hearing of the Most High—one must take care never again to commit deeds that violate life and transgress the Dao. Should one repeat offenses tenfold, Heaven and Earth will not forgive, and death shall serve as proof; no further amendment or remedy will be possible. Seeking the Dao in this manner will yield nothing. Nurturing life is like the interplay of water and fire: gaining its benefit leads to ascension in broad daylight, while violating its precepts results in descent into the Three Springs.

This day holds particular weight among the seven nodal days, for it is what Master Zhao Boxuan called the "gateway of life and death." The *Three-Nine Plain Discourse* states: "On the day of autumnal judgment, high and low assemble, for it is the day of life and death." The ancients regarded the Autumn Equinox as the day of autumnal judgment. The reason lies in this: on the Autumn Equinox, the Perfected, immortals, and spirits of the Nine Heavens, Eight Lands, and Supreme August Thearch gather for three days and nights to determine the fate of all people. The matters deliberated are many, and the assembled deities are of the highest rank.

On each of the eight nodal days, the celestial and terrestrial Perfected officials convene in succession, remaining for three days and nights before returning to their respective domains. This is the oral instruction of Master Zhi Gongzi, distinct from the regulations of the seven nodal days.

The *Golden Root Scripture* of the Night-Watching Divine Youth states: "On the eight nodal days, the assemblies for seeking immortality reach their peak, as the Mandate of Heaven summons all Perfected to gather. One day before the node, the myriad spirits approach the palace; at noon on the nodal day, high and low enter to pay homage; one day after the node, sins and blessings are distinguished. For three days and nights, celestial affairs are concluded. Beware of transgressions, strive to accumulate merit, and your name may ascend to the Perfected, inscribed in the Great Ultimate. I do not speak falsely—those who understand must keep this deeply secret. Hasten to confess your faults, and guard this teaching with care." This, too, was an oral transmission from Master Zhi Gong, passed down to Master Pei.

**Second Method: Confessing Faults on the Eight Nodal Days (by Master Xu)**
Master Xu’s oral instruction states: On the eight nodal days, after midnight, sit upright facing north, visualize your form and spirit until they appear manifest. Upon completion, cross your hands above your head and knock your head on the ground thirty-six times—thus sins and transgressions are erased, and form and spirit attain union.

**Third Method: Confessing Faults for Ancestors on the Five Penetrating Days (by Master Xu)**
On the Five Penetrating Days, face north and beseech the exile of one’s three generations of ancestors and five generations of forebears, thereby dissolving the sins and transgressions of one’s forebears. The Five Penetrating Days are the first day of the tenth month and the first day of the second month. Without resolving the burdens of one’s ancestors, one’s pursuit of immortality will remain distant.

**Fourth Method: Confessing Faults for Ancestors and Oneself on the Five Pervading Days (by Master Xu)**
On the Five Pervading Days, face north and bow five times, calling aloud the names of the August Lords and their consorts three times:
- The True August of Jupiter: Yu Can, Yu Can, Yu Can; Lady Flying Cloud, Flying Cloud, Flying Cloud.
- The True August of Mars: Wei Ting, Wei Ting, Wei Ting; Lady Hua Ping, Hua Ping, Hua Ping.
- The True August of Saturn: Dan Yan, Dan Yan, Dan Yan; Lady Fei Xian, Fei Xian, Fei Xian.
- The True August of Venus: De Biao, De Biao, De Biao; Lady Ling En, Ling En, Ling En.
- The True August of Mercury: Jing Yuan, Jing Yuan, Jing Yuan; Lady Long E, Long E, Long E.

The personal names of the Five August Consorts have no prior textual source; these are the separate oral instructions of Lady Zhaoling. Afterward, knock the teeth together five times, remove the headscarf, and kneel lengthily. Reverently address the August Lords of the Five Stars and the Moon, the High Perfected of the Dao, the Ladies of the Dao, the Most High of Jade Purity, the Supreme August Thearch of Highest Clarity, and the Sagely Lord of the Great Dao before them, confessing the myriad sins and transgressions of one’s seven generations of ancestors and parents down to oneself, beseeching liberation. Petition the Three Officials to report to the Heavenly Thearch, that one’s name may be severed from guilt and erased from the cinnabar tablets. Pray to join the Perfected of the Five Stars, together ascending to the radiant dawn, entering Highest Clarity, and traversing the Jade Towers.

On the sixth day of the first month at noon...

On the first day of the second month at the evening meal hour, the seventh day of the third month at midnight, the ninth day of the fourth month at breakfast hour, the fifteenth day of the fifth month at midnight, the third day of the sixth month at noon, the seventh day of the seventh month at midnight, the fourth day of the eighth month at noon, the second day of the ninth month at dawn, the first day of the tenth month at dawn, the sixth day of the eleventh month at midnight, and the twelfth day of the twelfth month at midnight—these are the five propitious days of convergence.

The Most High concealed the days of the Five Penetrations within the Jade Bamboo Shoots of the Five Marchmounts, hiding the Way of Returning to the Origin within the Palace of the Nine Dawns. Having cultivated the Five Penetrations, one must practice the Return to the Origin. The Five Penetrations open at the Emperor’s Beginning, while the Return to the Origin opens at the Mysterious End. Thus, those who cultivate the Five Penetrations and practice the Seven Origins’ Way of Return must abstain from consuming bloody or foul substances and avoid all corpses and impurities. Violators shall face the trials of the Great Mystery.

The Five Penetrations are the Most High’s days of auspicious assembly; the Return to the Origin is the Most High’s day of renewal. Without knowing the Five Penetrations, one cannot dissolve sins or erase transgressions; without knowing the hidden Way of the Return to the Origin, one’s name cannot be inscribed among the Perfected. On these days, one should meditate upon auspicious matters, first repenting the sins and transgressions within one’s body—this is what is meant by liberating seven generations and severing oneself from penal bonds. Failure to do so will bar one from the immortals of the Nine Palaces.

**The Primordial One’s Method for Repenting and Dissolving Sins at Midnight and Noon (Fifth)**
The Primordial One states: If you have sins and transgressions and wish to repent and seek their dissolution, at midnight or noon, enter a chamber, close the door, sit upright, and face north. Visualize the Imperial Lord within your Purple Chamber, as described above. Then visualize yourself within the Purple Chamber, prostrating before the Imperial Lord, inwardly confessing your faults. Hold your breath for a long while until your entire body is drenched in sweat, your clothes soaked through. Repeat this three times, and the sins you dissolve will naturally disperse.

When your whole body is bathed in sweat, recite the following prayer:
*"So-and-so has sinned, his transgressions known to the hundred spirits. I beseech deliverance from the seventy-two perils of water and fire. Guardian of Destiny, Primordial One, I implore the Imperial Lord for salvation. My sweat flows through my body, my Three Hun tremble in fear. I humbly entreat the Most High to forever remove my afflictions."*

Afterward, call the Imperial Lord’s name three times. The Imperial Lord’s taboo name is *Lingfan*, his style *Lǚchānglíng*; he is also called *Seven Spirits* or *Divine Elder*. He constantly resides in the Purple Chamber of the Great Ultimate, seated in perfect uprightness, his countenance like that of an infant. A purple qi ever shrouds his divine form; he wears a robe of five-colored radiance and a crown adorned with the sun and moon. Upon his left ear rests a sun nine inches in diameter; upon his right, a moon one foot across. Once the visualization is complete, open your eyes. This is called the *Imperial Lord’s Way of Dissolving Transgressions*, an inner repentance to the Five Spirits, with sweating as its sign.

The worldly method of repentance involves kowtowing and striking one’s cheeks, but this is an external practice. Those who cultivate the Three Ones and guard the Grotto Chamber, serving the Imperial Lord and revering the Primordial One, must never kowtow or strike their cheeks. Kowtowing startles the Three Hun, disturbs the Mud-Pill Palace, agitates the Purple Chamber, and troubles the Imperial Lord. Striking one’s cheeks hardens the womb-knot, strains the Eastern Po’s sinews, grieves the Primordial One, and causes the Five Spirits to depart—this is a grave taboo. If, in thought or deed, one merely *visualizes* kowtowing or striking the cheeks, the repentance is inwardly accomplished. The immortals bow in their hearts alone, their forms unbending; this, I say, is fitting.

**Master Liu’s Method for Repenting on Behalf of One’s Family on Chen-Si Days of the Five Virtues (Sixth)**
Master Liu records: People accumulate many sins, and though the Heavenly Net is wide, none escape its mesh. The unseen shortens one’s allotted years, thus cutting life short. Though the Way of life resides within the body, without repentance, one suffers illness, sorrow, and misfortune. This text is drawn from the *Twenty-Third Scroll of the Inner Chapters of the Taiwei Wenchang Hetu*.

When a household experiences misfortune, decline, or failure in endeavors; when descendants do not flourish; when an official’s rank does not advance; when livestock perish; or when sudden disasters strike—all arise from the weight of transgressions. If one washes away filth, purifies the heart, refrains from excess and envy, avoids unprincipled conduct, cultivates compassion and empathy, shares others’ sorrows and joys, regards others’ losses as one’s own and others’ gains as one’s own; if one does not slander, does not sow discord, practices charity, and rescues those in distress—then life will lengthen daily, and one’s wishes will be fulfilled.

On *chen-si* days at dusk, sweep and purify the ground of Heavenly Virtue (referring to the earth of *jia, geng, bing, xin,* and *ren*). Burn incense, and with the whole household facing north, remove your headscarves and kowtow dozens of times without speaking. Inwardly, pray: *"May the sins and transgressions committed by our household be dissolved."* Thus may one attain peace and longevity. If wrongdoing continues unabated, even frequent repentance will be of no benefit. But if one commits no further transgressions and regularly practices this method of repentance, one shall forever be free from sorrow and misfortune.

The *jia-chen*, *bing-chen*, *wu-chen*, *geng-chen*, *ren-chen*, *ji-si*, *xin-si*, *gui-si*, *yi-si*, and *ding-si* days.
*(Listed above: the Five Virtue Days.)*

**The Seventh Method of Repentance on the Five Dao-Returning Days for Dissolving the Register of Sins in the Hidden Dao of the Supreme Return**

The *Inner Chapter on Dissolving the Register of Sins in the Hidden Dao of the Supreme Return* states: The Supreme Jade Perfected Concealed Origin’s Inner Contemplation employs the *ding* days of the six *ding*. At this time, the Celestial Origin unfolds its array; the primordial matrix is doubly secured. The seven *po* ascend to report, and the three *hun* record transgressions. Offenses bind seven generations of ancestors, and accumulated punishments weigh upon the Three Yin. Thus, there exists this method of dissolution to absolve entanglements and calamities.

Those who practice this Dao are truly the greatest among seekers of immortality. Reflect upon the Seven Origins, contemplate the Dao of the Nine Mornings. The sleeping mats and bedding must not be shared with others, nor should clothing. If men and women share a bed, their names are inscribed in the Register of Northern Darkness. Those who violate defilement will have their misfortunes recorded in the earthly prisons. Even masters and kin sharing a resting place commit an offense.

The *Five Penetrations* are the auspicious assembly days of the Supreme. The *Returning Origin* is the day of renewal for the Supreme. Without knowledge of the *Five Penetrations*, one cannot dissolve sins or erase transgressions. Without knowledge of the Hidden Dao of the Returning Origin, one cannot have their name inscribed among the Perfected. On these days, one should reflect upon auspicious matters and first repent the sins within one’s body—this is what is meant by "dissolving the bonds of seven generations and escaping the records of punishment." One must not reveal this to the immortals of the Nine Palaces.

The Supreme conceals the *Five Penetration* days, sealing them within the Jade Bamboo of the Five Peaks. The Hidden Dao of the Returning Origin is concealed within the Palace of the Nine Mornings. Having cultivated the *Five Penetrations*, one should practice the Returning Origin. The *Five Penetrations* are linked to the Imperial Beginning; the Returning Origin opens at the Mysterious End. Thus, those who cultivate the *Five Penetrations* and practice the Dao of the Seven Origins’ Return must not consume blood or meat, nor witness corpses or defilement. Violators will face the trials of the Supreme Mystery.

For those who cultivate matters of the Purple Chamber in the Grotto Chamber and contemplate the Nine Mornings and Seven Origins: at the initial moment of sleep, the inception of the hexagram, before eating, and after meals, first recite this subtle invocation:

*"Five Emperors, Five Penetrations,
Six Harmonies, Purple Chamber,
Returning Origin, Hidden Dao,
Vast and Lofty Seven Perfected,
The soul’s begetter is the Mysterious Father—
the Father transforms into the One, becoming spirit.
The po’s begetter is the Mysterious Mother—
the Mother transforms into the Two, giving birth to the body.
The gatherer of my sinews and bones is the Duke’s Son;
the steward of my essence and qi is White Origin.
Long life and enduring vision,
ascend as an immortal to the Ten Heavens."*

Upon completion, ensure no one hears the invocation. This is the Supreme’s hidden prayer, used to dispel evil qi, summon spirit, and ensure one remains untroubled by obscurity throughout life.

**The Eighth: Dissolving the Eight Trials of the Seven Generations’ Parents on the Six Jia Days, Six Ding Days, Month’s End Evenings, and Six Jia Days**

Regularly, during the *jia-zi* cycle, on the *ding-mao* day at midnight, sit upright on the bed, face north, clasp hands, and knock the teeth seven times. Then, gaze upward and visualize the Seven Stars, making them radiant in the north. After a long while, recite this subtle invocation:

*"First, the Supreme Star: Mysterious Pivot, Yang Brightness, Celestial Pivot, Soul Spirit, Supreme Mystery’s Nine Lords."*

Call upon them seven times. Then recite again:

*"May the yang sins and yang transgressions of my seven generations, down to my own body, all be dissolved. May all I undertake be as I wish, all matters align with my heart. May I traverse the Seven Origins, harmonize with Heaven, have my name inscribed in the Morning Dipper, and extend my lifespan by billions and thousands."*

Upon completion, visualize the Northern Dipper’s seven stars descending from the heavens, flying into your mouth, and entering your heart. Visualize the heart’s light, making inner and outer radiantly clear. Focus intently. Then, face north and bow twice. After bowing, swallow saliva eighteen times, or rise and bow. This is called *Dissolving the Morning’s Entangled Net and Illuminating the Inner Dao*.

During the *jia-xu* cycle, on the *ding-chou* day at midnight, sit upright on the bed, face north, clasp hands, and knock the teeth seven times. Then, gaze upward and visualize the Seven Stars, making them radiant in the north. After a long while, recite this subtle invocation:

*"Second, the Origin Star: Northern Terrace, Yin Essence, Celestial Vertical, Soul Spirit, Supreme King’s Nine Lords."*

Call upon them seven times. Then recite again:

*"May the yin sins and yin transgressions of my seven generations, down to my own body, all be dissolved. May the Six Qi be full, the Four Spirits equally numinous. May I traverse the Seven Origins, have my name inscribed in the Jade Book, ascend to the Purple Clarity, ride the mysterious chariot, and move freely with auspicious correctness, in harmony with Heaven."*

Upon completion, visualize the Northern Dipper’s seven stars descending from the heavens, flying into your mouth, and entering your spleen. Make them illuminate inner and outer, the five viscera distinct. As the stars enter your mouth, let your eyes perceive their radiance scattering and filling your mouth, a slight warmth in the mouth signifying the stars’ essence has entered. Then, face north and bow twice. After bowing, swallow saliva eighteen times, or rise and bow.

During the *jia-shen* cycle, on the *ding-hai* day at midnight, sit upright on the bed, face north, clasp hands, and knock the teeth seven times. Then, gaze upward and visualize the Seven Stars, making them radiant in the north. After a long while, recite this subtle invocation:

*"Third, the Perfected Star: Nine Ultimates, Supreme Perfected, Supreme Origin’s Lady, Celestial Mechanism, Po Essence, Supreme Simplicity’s Nine Lords."*

Call upon them seven times. Then recite:

*"May the death sins and death transgressions of my seven generations, down to my own body—accumulated evils, private concealments, and violations of the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water—all be dissolved. May my eyes see clearly, penetrating even the obscure. May I traverse the Seven Origins, have my name inscribed in the Upper Clarity, command the myriad spirits, ascend to the Jade Court, ride the luminous chariot through the void, and harmonize with Heaven."*

Upon completion, visualize the Northern Dipper’s seven stars descending from the heavens, flying into your mouth, and entering your liver. Make their light illuminate the five viscera, inner and outer radiantly clear. Then, face north and bow twice. After bowing, swallow saliva eighteen times, or rise and bow.

On the *jia-wu*旬 (ten-day period) and *ding-you* day, at midnight, sit upright on your bed, face north, clasp your hands, and knock your teeth seven times. Then, gaze upward and visualize the seven stars shining brightly in the north. After a long while, softly recite:

*"The Fourth Pivot Star, Rotating Root of the Dark and Mysterious Heaven, drives forth the Essence of the Hun to the Nine Lords of the Upper Void."*

Recite this seven times. Then, recite again:

*"May the ungrateful and unvirtuous deeds of my seven generations—down to my own body—my lack of benevolence and filial piety, and the countless hidden evils, all be dissolved. May I ingest essence and absorb vitality, daily growing in strength. May I ascend through the Seven Origins, have my name inscribed in the Great Mystery, be listed among the Jade Emperor’s court, ride the swift winds of the Nine Heavens, command spirits and guide numinous beings, and renew with the sun and moon."*

Upon completion, visualize the Northern Dipper’s seven stars descending from the heavens, flying into your mouth, and entering your spleen. Let their light illuminate and penetrate the five viscera. Then, face north and bow twice. After bowing, swallow saliva eighteen times, or rise and bow.

On the *jia-chen*旬 and *ding-wei* day, at midnight, sit upright on your bed, face north, clasp your hands, and knock your teeth seven times. Then, gaze upward and visualize the seven stars shining brightly in the north. After a long while, softly recite:

*"The Fifth Principle Star, Heavenly Balance of the Cinnabar Origin and Jade Pivot, drives forth the Numinous Hun to the Nine Lords of the Upper Primordium."*

Recite this seven times. Then, recite again:

*"May the inner and outer defilements of my seven generations—down to my own body—my hidden and manifest transgressions, countless as the sands, recorded in the dark prisons, all be dissolved. May my body be filled and my qi abundant, the Yellow Court governing my stomach. May the Upper and Middle harmonize with the Lower, the Primordial Simplicity casting its radiance. May my name be inscribed in the Purple Palace, attended on the right by Jade Maidens and on the left by Jade Lads. May I shine with the sun and moon, and be enthroned as a Perfected King."*

Upon completion, visualize the Northern Dipper’s seven stars descending from the heavens, flying into your mouth, and entering your stomach. Let their light brightly illuminate and distinguish the five viscera. Then, face north and bow twice. After bowing, swallow saliva eighteen times, or rise and bow.

On the *jia-yin*旬 and *ding-si* day, at midnight, sit upright on your bed, face north, clasp your hands, and knock your teeth seven times. Then, gaze upward and visualize the seven stars shining brightly in the north. After a long while, softly recite:

*"The Sixth Chronicle Star, Life’s Mechanism of the Northern Culmen, drives forth the Numinous Hun of the Radiant Yang to the Nine Lords of the Cinnabar Void and August Sovereign."*

Recite this seven times. Then, recite again:

*"May the thieving and malevolent sins of my seven generations—down to my own body—my treacherous, rebellious, and reckless transgressions, recorded in the imperial archives, all be dissolved. May the hundred diseases be cured, my body and qi flourish in uprightness. May my name be inscribed on the Immortal Terrace, carved in gold in the Upper Clarity. May I command the myriad spirits and traverse the Nine Luminaries."*

Upon completion, visualize the Northern Dipper’s seven stars descending from the heavens, flying into your mouth, and entering your kidneys. Let their light brightly illuminate and distinguish the five viscera. Then, face north and bow twice. After bowing, swallow saliva eighteen times, or rise and bow.

On yang days, visualize the stars entering the left kidney; on yin days, the right kidney. The first day is yang, the second yin.

This practice strictly forbids exposure to blood, filth, or foul odors, as well as the consumption of meat or pungent foods. Violations will bring misfortune upon the seven ancestors and calamity upon oneself, leading to death as a lowly ghost and expulsion from the imperial gates.

On the evening of the last day of the lunar month, before the next day’s dawn (the first day of the new moon), before the crow of the rooster, sit upright on your bed in your chamber, face east, clasp your hands, and knock your teeth seven times. Then, gaze upward and visualize the seven stars of the north shining brightly to your left. After a long while, softly recite:

*"The Seventh Barrier Star, Dark Yang of the Heavenly Gate, Shaking Radiance of the Great Luminous, Supreme Jade Emperor and Dao Lord."*

Recite this seven times. Then, recite again:

*"May the hidden and obscure sins of my seven generations—down to my own body—my violations of the Five Punishments and the spirits within, countless as the sands, recorded in the Ghost Officials of the Northern Emperor, all be dissolved. May my spirit and essence flow freely, granting me the power to sit or stand at will. May my ears hear beyond sound, my eyes emit purple light. May my name be inscribed in the Jade Simplicity, my vision penetrating the forms of ghosts. May my name be recorded by the Imperial Lord, my fate equal to the Two Luminaries. May I traverse the Seven Origins and repose in the Purple Court."*

Upon completion, visualize the Northern Dipper’s seven stars descending from the heavens, flying into your pupils, illuminating both eyes, and allowing inner and outer vision. Visualize the five viscera distinctly.

On yang days, visualize the stars entering the left pupil; on yin days, the right pupil. Then, face north and bow twice. After bowing, swallow saliva eighteen times, or rise and bow.

On the six *jia* days, at midnight—the time when generative qi arises—lie or sit on your bed in your chamber, your head facing any direction. Clench your fists, hold your breath, and settle your spirit. After a long while, knock your teeth nine times. Then, visualize the nine stars of the Northern Dipper shining brightly above your crown, their radiance intermingling. Softly recite:

*"The Eighth Imperial Star, Lofty Jade Emperor and Spirit of the Eight Effulgences; the Ninth Revered Star, Supreme Jade Emperor of the Great Tenuity and the Seven Dawns of Primordial Simplicity."*

Recite this nine times. Then, recite again:

*"May the great and small sins of my nine generations of ancestors—down to my own body—my transgressions in hills, mountains, and water sources, those recorded in the Registers of the Dead, my hidden evils, concealed treacheries, and deceits, countless as the sands, listed in the Ghost Emperor’s archives on Mount Feng, the offenses under the statutes of death, recorded in the Black Registers of the Nine Primordials of the Northern Uppermost and the Great Ultimate Perfected Ones—be beseeched before the Nine Primordials, the Supreme Emperor, the Revered Jade Mystery Lord, to be dissolved in every instance. May I traverse the Seven Paths, ascend to the Jade Clarity, wander the Great Void, ride the radiance of dawn’s birth, repose in the Eight Simplicities of the North, harmonize with the sun, collectively attend the August Consort, and govern the myriad spirits."*

Then, visualize the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper descending from heaven and entering directly into the Purple Chamber of my Mud-Palace, causing its radiance to illuminate the Mud-Palace thoroughly and extend its luminous brilliance to permeate my entire body and the five viscera, so that inner and outer are suffused with purple-cloud qi, dense and luxuriant. Hold this vision steadfastly.

When the visualization is complete, bow twice in the heart, then swallow saliva twenty-seven times.
