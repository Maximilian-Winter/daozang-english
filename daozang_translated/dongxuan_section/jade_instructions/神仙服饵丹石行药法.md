**The Divine Immortals’ Methods for Ingesting Elixirs, Minerals, and Medicinal Substances**
*By Master Jingli*

### **The Yellow Emperor’s Method for Ingesting Single-Substance Elixirs**
Take one *jin* of fine cinnabar. For a single-substance elixir, first purify yourself for seven days in a clean and secluded place. On a high mountain, avoid the shady side, and gather cinnabar according to the following method. Pound it thoroughly, then place it in a copper tray. Add nine *sheng* of pure, aged wine, mixing the cinnabar within. Do not let others witness this, lest the spirits fail to enter.

Enter the altar beginning from the eastern gate, then the southern gate, then the western gate, and finally the northern gate. Present the medicine at the center. Stir it for three days, then again from three to five, and once more on the seventh day. From seven to nine, return to stirring from three, then to five as before.

After twenty days, when the medicine is dry enough to form pills, roll it into pellets. If not yet dry, repeat the previous method. In case of overcast or rainy weather, keep the copper tray covered until the pills are properly formed. Shape them like small beans, and swallow three daily. After fifty days, your wisdom and perception will sharpen. After nine years of continuous ingestion, you will commune with Heaven and Earth. After three thousand four hundred and twenty-four days, the Dao will be perfected, and all your desires will be fulfilled.

This *Zhuguang Divine Elixir* is the essence of cinnabar. Avoid moxibustion, acupuncture, and passing by households with newborns, lest its spiritual efficacy be lost.

### **The Divine Immortals’ Method for Ingesting Cinnabar**
Take high-quality, unyielding cinnabar and grain kernels—just these two substances. The amount of cinnabar may vary; pound it thoroughly. Extract juice from the grain, mix it with the cinnabar to form a paste, and place it in a copper cylinder, sealing it tightly. Invert a ceramic bowl over it and set it in a steamer. Pack dry silkworm droppings around the cylinder within the steamer, pressing firmly to a depth of no more than four *cun*. Cover the top with dry earth until full. Place the steamer over a cauldron, seal the joints with white clay, and steam over a fierce fire for three days and nights. Remove the medicine when it becomes viscous.

Break it into pieces the size of large beans. Place one in your mouth, and it will dissolve instantly. Take three doses daily. After one year, your body will become light, your vision clear, and all illnesses will vanish. After two years, ghosts and spirits will pay homage. After three years, you will commune with the essence of the sun and moon.

One who regularly consumes this will hear parrots singing in the clouds and dogs barking in the heavens. The grain kernels must be purely red and white.

**Three-Ingredient Elixir of Cinnabar for Lightening the Body and Augmenting Qi**
One *jin* of cinnabar the size of sesame seeds, one *dou* of fine large jujubes, and one *dou* of pure clear wine. For these three ingredients, grind the cinnabar to a fine powder, sift it through silk, and place the wine in a copper vessel. Add the cinnabar and stir until well blended. Position it over charcoal, keeping it three to four *cun* from the fire, and bring to a boil, stirring frequently to prevent settling. Take the jujubes, boil them in two *dou* of water, then strain to remove skins and pits, retaining only the juice. Gradually add this to the cinnabar mixture, ensuring the liquid never runs dry, until it thickens like malt sugar. Remove and store in a jar. Each evening, swallow a pill the size of a jujube. After twenty days, one will perceive the effects. After thirty days, illnesses will be cured, the body will feel light, the hair will darken, lost teeth will regrow, and black hair will flourish with vitality.

**Three-Ingredient Elixir of the Immortals**
Three *jin* of cinnabar, three *jin* of lead, and nine *sheng* of grain juice. For these three ingredients, divide the grain juice, using six *sheng* to grind the cinnabar until exhausted. Then add the lead and grind until the lead is no longer visible. Mix with the remaining three *sheng* of grain juice, place in a copper vessel, cover with a ceramic bowl, and set in a steamer. Steam over mulberry firewood for three days and nights. The lead will revert to cinnabar, drawn forth by the elixir. Roll into pills the size of small beans. Take three pills daily. After twenty days, effects will manifest. After three years, one will ascend to heaven. When grinding cinnabar and lead, place them over a bright fire in sunlight to ensure proper refinement.

**Four-Ingredient Elixir of the Immortals**
Five *jin* of cinnabar, three *sheng* of fine honey, purely red paper mulberry fruit, and clear wine. Grind the four ingredients, extract juice from the paper mulberry fruit, and soak the cinnabar in it. Dry in the sun, then soak again, repeating until fully saturated. Place in a large bamboo cylinder and steam beneath the cinnabar for three days and nights. Remove and transfer to a copper cylinder, simmer in hot water, then soak in pure clear wine until saturated. Add honey and simmer for three days and nights until it resembles malt sugar and does not soil the hands. Consume pills the size of jujubes, taking two daily. After one hundred days, immortals will come to greet you. After one year, jade maidens will welcome you, and you will become a Perfected One.

**Refined Elixir of Cinnabar for the Perfected One**
Grind one *jin* of cinnabar into fine powder, sift through double-layered silk until impalpably fine. Moisten with pure wine containing no water, stirring until it resembles sealing clay. Place in a copper tray, set in a high location, and ensure no woman sees it. Expose to sunlight, stirring occasionally to prevent drying, and remoisten as needed to maintain a clay-like consistency. If rain or strong winds arise, cover and conceal it in a secluded place; when the weather clears, resume sun-drying. Repeat until three *dou* of wine are exhausted, then sun-dry for thirty days until it turns purple. When it can be grasped without soiling the hands and stretches like malt sugar, it is ready. If it sticks to the hands, further refinement is needed. Typically, three *jin* of cinnabar are refined to last three years. For three *jin* of cinnabar, use nine *dou* of wine and dry in a large tray.

Before refining, bathe with orchid and angelica, observe a seven-day fast, and ensure no women approach the medicine. Before consumption, fast for five days, bathe, and then take the elixir. The pills should be the size of sesame seeds. Swallow three at dawn daily. After one day, the Three Worms will emerge. After five or six days, all illnesses of the heart and abdomen will manifest and depart. After one year, white eyebrows will turn black. Increase the dosage by one pill each year, up to nine pills. After three years, divine beings will arrive. A woman clad in purple silk, bearing a tray of food, will appear—accept and eat it without fear. All things will come to serve you, and spirits will obey your commands. This is called "Supreme," also known as "Possible," or "Necessary." These three names empower all things, and all things may be summoned. One may enter metal, wood, water, fire, and earth, and these five phases will assume their forms as needed, like left and right hands. There is nothing it cannot accomplish.

To summon spirits, abstain from the five pungent vegetables, raw greens, raw fish, and dog meat. Avoid sexual intimacy and stay clear of sunrise and midday sun. After one year of this regimen, divine clarity will reveal all within a thousand *li*. After three years, you will perceive beyond three thousand *li*, your lifespan will extend, and you will see from without to within, from the eastern wall to the western. Then you shall become a *zhenren*.

This method was transmitted by Yongren’s Wang Ji, who received it from Shu’s Ma Mingsheng. Ma Mingsheng received it from Wang Ziqiao, who received it from Chisongzi, who received it from Xianmen Zigao, who received it from Ma Zuoshi. This method is secret and must not be carelessly transmitted. Qin Zixu practiced it and found it effective. Orchid and angelica are used for their fragrance.

The so-called "metal, wood, water, fire, and earth" mean that when placed upon wood, it becomes wood; when placed upon metal, it becomes metal.

**Another Elixir: Cinnabar**
Take one *jin* of cinnabar. Pound it thoroughly, then mix with three *sheng* of pure bitter wine and two *sheng* of refined lacquer. Simmer over a gentle flame until it can be formed into pills the size of sesame seeds. Take two pills twice daily. After forty days, all ailments of the abdomen will be cured, and the Three Corpses will depart. After one hundred days, the body will grow firm and strong. After one thousand days, the Controller of Destinies will erase your name from the register of death, and you will be preserved as heaven is preserved, gazing upon the sun and moon. Your form will transform, your appearance will shift, and you will change without constancy, casting no shadow at noon.

**Another Elixir: True Cinnabar**
Take one *jin* of true cinnabar and six *liang* of rhubarb. Steam the rhubarb in a cauldron until it has undergone two cycles, then grind it finely. Combine with the cinnabar, seal in a bamboo tube, and thin the tube’s walls. Use two cauldrons to steam it through two more cycles until the medicine is complete. Remove and place in a mortar, pounding it a thousand times. Take half a *qian* three times daily, always before meals. It is highly effective for treating *zheng* diseases, dispelling malign black fluids, and curing all ailments of the heart and abdomen. It also remedies consumptive exhaustion. Pounding it two thousand times is even better. For illnesses of three years’ duration, a full dose will bring cure. Adjust the dosage according to the severity of the illness.

The use of two cauldrons ensures the decoction remains clear. Bamboo, whether fresh or dried, may be used.

**Han Zhong’s Elixir**
Take ten *jin* of cinnabar and refine it. Extract juice from fully ripe paper mulberry fruit and knead it into the cinnabar—more juice yields better results. Place in a bamboo tube and steam the cinnabar beneath it for three days and nights. Remove and place in a bronze vessel, simmering in broth until the fat and essence are clear, with just enough wine. Add three *sheng* of honey and simmer for three days and nights until it resembles malt sugar, leaving no residue on the hands. Consume portions the size of a jujube pit twice daily. After one year, a jade maiden will come to welcome you, and you shall become a *zhenren*. When the *zhenren* and immortals consume this elixir to completion, and their merit is fulfilled after nine years, the time will come for them to ascend. Their spiritual powers will be complete, and they shall ascend to the Golden Gates and Jade Capital.

**Nine Radiant Knife-Points of Divine Elixir**
Take ten *liang* of divine cinnabar refined into true vermilion and ten *liang* of mercury, placing both in a bronze vessel. In a larger bronze vessel, melt one *jin* each of lead and tin. Place the vessel containing the cinnabar and mercury over the molten lead and tin, applying gentle heat above and stronger heat below. When the tin and lead have melted and blended with the mercury, the cinnabar will transform into the elixir. Take the prepared elixir at dawn, facing the sun, and consume one knife-point with well-water once daily. You may then ascend in flight or descend into the earth. After one thousand days of this regimen, a jade maiden will arrive, and a cloud chariot will come to welcome you. The Grand Unity will converse with you.

Beware of women—do not engage in intimacy. Avoid defilement by the impure, such as those in mourning, women who have given birth, or those who have died. Do not even touch them with your hands, for contact defiles the spirit. Defilement of the spirit prevents longevity, and the Dao of immortality will be lost.

**Flowing Elixir**
The flowing elixir is cinnabar. Grind it in a bronze mortar until thoroughly refined. Use three *jin* per dose. After one hundred days, the effects will be excellent.

Five *dou* of clear wine are used to steep one *sheng* each of large and small peppercorns; strain immediately and discard the dregs. Mix the liquid with flowing pearls until it resembles hot water. Store in a bronze vessel, place over a fire, and stir frequently until the liquid evaporates. Add more wine and elixir pearls, and the substance may extend several *chi*, resembling silk threads—thus the medicine is complete. At dawn, face the sun and consume a pill the size of a small red bean, three times daily. Take before meals; after one hundred days, all illnesses will vanish, and your lifespan will equal that of heaven and earth. The "large peppercorn" refers to Sichuan pepper, while the "small peppercorn" is Qin pepper. This remedy is also highly effective for treating severe wind disorders.

**Consuming Yue Elixir**
Grind one *jin* of true Yue elixir with pure clear wine until thoroughly blended, then simmer over boiling water for three days and nights, stirring without pause until it can be drawn into strands. Form into pills the size of soybeans. Take one pill twice daily to eliminate all diseases, pacify the spirit within the abdomen, and prolong life with long-term use.

**Another Yue Elixir Method**
Grind one *jin* of Yue elixir finely and place it in a bronze vessel with three *dou* of pure clear wine. Continuously pour and stir the wine while simmering over boiling water, always stirring counterclockwise. After three days and nights, when it can be drawn into strands, form into pills the size of soybeans. Take one pill twice daily to restore jade-like luster to the skin, turn white hair black, regrow fallen teeth, and smooth facial wrinkles.

**Consuming Sun-Exposed Elixir**
Use refined cinnabar in any quantity, grind it finely, and place it in a bronze vessel. Mix with white honey to form a paste, seal the vessel tightly, and lacquer the seams to ensure airtightness. Unseal it on the same day the following year, expose the contents to the sun to dry, then mix with honey and form into pills the size of soybeans. Take one pill twice daily to cure all diseases. Long-term use grants longevity and immortality.

**Consuming Waist-and-Abdomen Elixir**
Grind three *jin* of cinnabar into fine powder, place it in a double-layered silk pouch, and insert it into the abdomen of a pig. Sew the abdomen closed, steam it over glutinous millet, and cook with mulberry firewood for three days and nights. Remove the elixir, form into pills with white honey the size of soybeans, and take two pills three times daily to eliminate all illnesses and attain immortality with extended use.

**Parrot Elixir**
Select pure white male and female parrots, raise them separately, and obtain their eggs. Remove the yolk and white, mix with finely ground cinnabar, and return the mixture to the eggshell. Seal the opening tightly with wax and let the white parrot incubate the egg. When the chick hatches, the medicine is complete. Mix with honey and form into pills the size of soybeans. Take two pills three times daily; long-term use grants longevity and immortality.

**Divine Immortal’s Refined Consumable Returned Elixir**
Take one *liang* of cinnabar and one *jin* of Qin silver. Place the Qin silver in a bronze tray and expose it to the sun during the fifth or sixth month. Sprinkle the finely ground cinnabar over the silver and stir continuously with a large knife from breakfast until dusk, until the silver transforms entirely into elixir. Place the elixir in a Danyang bronze vessel, cover it, and coat the vessel with dog-hair clay to a thickness of two *cun*. Dry it in the sun, then heat it with horse-dung fire for nine days and nights. Remove the elixir, store it in a white silk pouch, and place it inside a crow’s abdomen. Sew the crow shut, boil it until cooked, then remove the elixir and form it into pills the size of sesame seeds. At dawn, face the sun and swallow one pill with well-water, three times daily. After one hundred days, divine spirits will appear in your hair. After two hundred days, your body will become light, and all ailments will be cured.

After three hundred days, you will be able to ascend above the clouds—this is called the *Jiuliu Pearl*.

**Divine Immortal’s Elixir of Rhubarb**
Take twelve *liang* of rhubarb elixir and two *jin* four *liang* of mercury. Mix these two ingredients with pure wine until thoroughly saturated, then stir them well. On a summer day at the *si* hour, place them in a bronze vessel and expose them to the sun. When the sunlight fills the chamber, stir until the mixture resembles two *dou* of cooked rice, and it will soon transform into elixir. Soak it in pure wine, blend it evenly, and stir again—it will revert to silver. Expose it to the sun until it resembles two *dou* of cooked rice, and it will soon transform back into elixir. Mix it with wine and expose it as before, and it will turn to silver again. Repeat the process until, after three transformations into silver and four into elixir, it becomes divine elixir. Always prepare it on a *wangxiang* day at the quiet hour when the sun is directly overhead, facing south while stirring. Thus it is said: "The mother gives birth to yang; stand in the noon direction." It is called *Chuhuang*, also known as the essence of *liuzhu*, or *liuhuang*. When transformed into divine elixir, it is also called *red salt*. This is the essence of all things, granting immortality. After one year of ingestion, the body will be full within and radiant without, the face and eyes will glow, white hair will turn black, and fallen teeth will regrow. After two years, you will enter the celestial gates and glimpse divine beings. After three years, you will ride clouds and mount dragons, becoming a *zhenren*.

**Divine Immortal’s Elixir of Ba**
Take one *jin* of *Ba* elixir and six *liang* of *rong* salt, grind them together, and place them in a bronze vessel. Cover it for three days, then soak in half a *dou* of pure wine for one night. Decant the clear liquid, and if the saltiness remains, soak again in half a *dou* of wine for another night until the salt is fully dissolved. Mix with white honey and steam with three *dou* of polished rice, cooking it in the center for three days and nights until the medicine is ready. Ingest a pill the size of a small bean, facing the sun, and swallow it with well-water. You will remain youthful for years without aging.

**Mountain Recluse’s Elixir**
First, dig a pit three *chi* deep and line it with yellow clay, plastering the exterior to a thickness of three *cun*, ensuring it is firm and dry without cracks. Place a one-*dan* iron cauldron inside and plaster it as well. Pour six or seven *dou* of water into the cauldron, then place a three-*dou* earthenware pot atop it to hold one *jin* of refined elixir. Mix the elixir with five *sheng* of mulberry root juice until well combined, then cover it with another earthenware pot. Seal the edges of both pots and the iron cauldron with yellow clay, ensuring no qi escapes. Heat with mulberry firewood, regulating the flame to prevent boiling over, and replenish the water in the cauldron to prevent the juice from drying out. Once done, coat it with honey and repeat the process for three days and nights. Then, open the upper pot, pour five *sheng* of clear wine into the medicine, and stir well. Seal it again and repeat for another three days and nights. Remove the elixir, place it in a bronze vessel, add five *sheng* of white honey, and stir until well mixed. Float the bronze vessel in the cauldron’s hot water and simmer over a low flame for three days and nights, stirring until it can be formed into pills. After nine days and nights, the medicine is complete. Take two pills the size of sesame seeds, twice daily. Increase by one pill each day until reaching ten, then return to two pills as before. After thirty days, the body will feel light; after sixty days, hearing and vision will sharpen; after a hundred days, all illnesses will be cured; after two hundred days, the mind will long to fly. After three years, you will become immortal, enduring as long as heaven and earth.

**Divine Immortal’s Elixir for Curing Illness, Prolonging Life, and Reversing Aging**
Take one *jin* of cinnabar, finely ground and refined. Add two *sheng* of pure lacquer, one *sheng* of white honey, and three *sheng* of good bitter wine. Combine these four ingredients in a bronze vessel and simmer over a low flame, stirring frequently until fragrant and pliable enough to form pills. Ingest one pill the size of a sesame seed—after forty days, the body will become strong, and all illnesses will vanish. After a hundred days, the *sanshi* parasites will depart. After a thousand days, no evil will assail you, and you will gain the power of flight and transformation, moving effortlessly wherever you go. You will alter your appearance at will, passing unseen, and at noon, cast no shadow. This is the most secret elixir of the immortals, not to be transmitted lightly. Avoid consuming pork, raw fish, and all sour or pungent foods while taking this medicine. To prepare it, seek solitude and quiet, and do not let more than two people witness the process, lest the medicine fail.

**Divine Immortal’s Elixir of Realgar**
The treasure of heaven and earth, hidden in the central pole, is called *cihuang*. After a thousand years, *cihuang* transforms into realgar; after another thousand years, realgar becomes gold. Ingesting gold makes one a *zhenren*. Yet the method for consuming gold is subtle and difficult to perfect. Nothing surpasses realgar for lightening the body and replenishing qi. To prepare realgar, take one *jin* of the finest quality, grind it to powder, and mix it with three *sheng* of pure wine in a bronze vessel. Simmer over white charcoal on a low flame, keeping it slightly boiling without overcooking, until it resembles glue. Add two *sheng* of good lacquer, strain out the dregs, and stir into the mixture until well combined. Form into pills the size of soybeans. Before meals, soak one pill and swallow its juice, three times daily. After ten days, all illnesses will be cured. After twenty days, the skin will darken from head to toe, and you will walk as a *zhenren*, warm in cold and cool in heat. After a hundred days, the intestines will grow thick, the skin firm, the sinews strong, the bones resilient, and the ears and eyes sharp. All afflictions will vanish. After three hundred days, take pills the size of millet, three times daily, as a regular practice. The best realgar comes from Wudu, selected for its yang color—bright and pure. Take one *jin* and grind it to an extremely fine powder. Add half a *jin* of mercury and six *liang* of mica, both ground to a fine powder.

Combine three *sheng* of white honey with the mixture and store in a bamboo tube, thinning its walls by shaving. Seal the mouth with a wooden plug, then place it beneath millet grains. After five days and nights, remove and immerse in water, drawing it out like silk—thus it will not soil the hands nor cling to grass or earth. Swallow one pill the size of a soybean daily as a regular practice, and you will be preserved with Heaven and Earth; do not recklessly transmit this.

For true yang realgar, select the brightest and purest red. Use as much as desired, place in a cauldron, and cover with another cauldron, sealing the edges to prevent leakage. First, use dog’s hair as a substitute, then mix with talc and red halloysite, applying a water-based coating three *fen* thick. Once dry, the upper cauldron need not be sealed. Fashion an iron fork to suspend the cauldron five *cun* above the ground, and heat with reed firewood. Shape three clay pellets and place them atop the cauldron; dry them, then add another pellet, repeating until all three are used. When cold, brush the substance with a parrot feather. Insert the medicine into the fatty intestines of a pig, tie both ends, place in a bronze vessel, cover, and nestle in a jar filled with yellow earth. Steam for one day and night, then add another intestine; after three days and nights, using three intestines in total, it may be drawn out. Form into pills the size of a crossbow pellet, and swallowing one will allow you to drink the Jade Nectar.

Another method for consuming realgar as an immortal’s elixir:
The *zhenren*’s realgar elixir is worth a thousand gold; consuming it grants boundless union with Heaven and Earth. It may be drawn out to a length of three *chi*. The method: take one *jin* of fine realgar, place in a bamboo tube, and cover with a larger tube. Add six *liang* of white honey, five *liang* of mica powder, and eight and a half *liang* of mercury. Seal tightly to prevent leakage, place amid millet grains, and steam for five days and nights. Remove and rinse in water until it resembles silk—thus the elixir is complete. Consume one pill the size of a crossbow pellet daily.

Another method for consuming realgar to cure illness, repel toxins, and prolong life:
Take one *jin* of realgar, grind to a powder with two and a half *sheng* of rice, and add six *liang* of mica, also ground. Mix with three *sheng* of white honey, store in a bamboo tube, thin its walls by shaving, and seal the mouth with a wooden plug. Steam amid millet grains for five days and nights, then immerse in water, drawing it out like silk—thus it will not soil the hands nor cling to grass or earth. Consume one pill the size of a soybean daily as a regular practice, and you will endure with Heaven and Earth, attain immortality, transcend the world, commune with the divine, ascend as an emissary of the Great One, and subdue all spirits at will.

The Great One’s elixir of two substances—mercury and realgar:
Take one *jin* each of realgar and mercury. First, refine the realgar and steam it in rice for three days and nights. Then combine with mercury, grinding until thoroughly mixed, and place in a bronze vessel. Set within rice, covering with five *dou* of millet, and heat with mulberry firewood until the vapor ceases. Repeat the process fifteen times, after which it will liquefy. Remove and melt over charcoal until it becomes water, then place on warm earth. Return to the charcoal fire; the medicine will turn purple. Take one *daogui* of powder and mix with one *jin* of lead—thus the substance is obtained. To consume, blend with white honey into pills the size of millet grains, swallowing one daily.

After ten days of consumption, damp earth will no longer harm you, and no ghost will dare approach. After twenty days, you will commune with the divine, and the Dao will be fulfilled. After a hundred days, you will become an emissary of the Great One. After three years, you will achieve boundless union with Heaven and Earth, command ghosts and spirits, ascend the clouds with lightness, traverse the vast and limitless, leap through the skies, and ascend to pay homage to the Heavenly Sovereign, joining the ranks of immortals. This is transmitted among *zhenren*; fools are deluded by it.

Dongfang Shuo’s method for consuming realgar.

How much to use is at your discretion. Mince finely, remove the entrails from a plump duck, and place realgar inside its belly. Steam for three days and three nights, then bury it in sand. Consume pieces the size of a jujube pit, twice daily—this is especially effective.

**Immortals’ Method for Consuming Realgar with Parrot Eggs**
Take one *jin* of realgar and grind it to powder. Mix with the yolk and white of fresh parrot eggs, place in a copper vessel, and cover with another vessel, sealing the edges. Warm over a gentle fire, just enough to touch without burning, and heat continuously for three days and nights without letting the fire go out. Once cooled, open it and skim off the dross; the clear substance below will surge like mercury, hardening when cold and softening when exposed to human *qi*. From one *jin*, you will obtain ten *liang*. Store in a bamboo tube, shielding it from wind. Consume pieces the size of sesame seeds to make the skin lustrous as jade, warm in winter, cool in summer, and ward off all cold *qi*.

**Immortals’ Single-Ingredient Realgar Elixir for Longevity**
Take three *jin* of realgar. Prepare a single-ingredient elixir by placing it in a cauldron, sealing the lid with dog hair and mud to prevent leaks, ensuring an even thickness of half a *cun* and letting it dry. Place it among millet grains and steam with reed firewood. Form a mud pellet and place it on top as an indicator; when the pellet dries, the elixir is ready. Sweep off the residue from the top. Fill a pig’s large intestine with the elixir, tie both ends, and place it among the steaming millet for one day. Coat another intestine with fine lard, wrap it around the elixir, and repeat for three days and three nights, using three intestines in total. The elixir will turn white. To consume, stretch it into strands and form pills the size of a bullet; swallowing one will grant ageless longevity.

**Immortals’ Realgar Elixir to Summon Jade Maidens**
Select realgar the color of a parrot’s crest, pound it finely, and mix with refined pine resin. Consume one pill the size of a bullet daily. After ten days, the three corpse-worms in your abdomen will be expelled, and your complexion will clear. After twenty days, all illnesses will vanish, and your hearing and vision will sharpen. Store the elixir and consume two small bean-sized pills daily. After a hundred days, the Everlasting Yang Maiden will appear. After two hundred days, the Azure-Waisted Jade Maiden, her form like jade, will come adorned with yellow ornaments the size of large millet grains on her nose or philtrum—this is the true Jade Maiden. If you wish to take her as a wife, do not marry another. She will say, "I see you consume the divine elixir, your essence and *qi* ascending to penetrate the Cavern-Heavens. Heaven has sent me to be your bride." You may ask her, "I have heard of the celestial Flower Pool wine and Orchid Spring nectar—might I taste them?" The Jade Maiden will fetch them for you to drink, and you may then take her as your wife. From then on, you will forever accompany her, riding a feathered chariot through the Nine Heavens and roaming the Six Directions. Continue the elixir without cease to preserve yourself alongside Heaven and Earth. Beware: do not lend your clothing or sandals to others, for the elixir’s essence is volatile. Prepare this elixir in seclusion for a hundred days.

**Immortals’ Wine-Refined Realgar**
Take one *jin* of realgar and pound it finely. Soak in five *sheng* of clear wine in a vessel, then face east and arrange the setup. Place the vessel in a cauldron, seal it lightly, and set a copper tray on top with water three to four *cun* deep. Seal the edges with red clay to prevent leaks. Steam with mulberry firewood, replenishing the water as it evaporates. When the elixir’s liquid is exhausted, add five *sheng* of wine five times, totaling two *dou* and five *sheng*. Adjust the fire until the elixir can be formed into pills, then stop. Do not use too fierce a fire, or the realgar will scatter and the elixir will fail. Before compounding, observe a seven-day fast in a clean, secluded place, allowing no one to witness the process. Once complete, consume two pills the size of small beans daily, washing them down with water. After a hundred days, the elixir will enter your marrow, expelling the three corpse-worms, sharpening your mind and vision, and granting you martial presence. It will repel dragons and serpents in water, tigers and wolves in the mountains, and all weapons in battle. Those who consume realgar will be invincible.

**Immortals’ Refined White Realgar Elixir**
First construct a double-layered earthen furnace, five *cun* wide and one *chi* long, with a chimney. Fill the center with charcoal, place the realgar at the opening (five to six *jin* as needed), and position a wooden basin filled with Dark Dragon Juice beneath to catch the elixir. Seal the setup with mud to a height of one *chi* and five to six *cun*. Heat with a fierce fire, adding charcoal as needed. Soon, the realgar will melt and drip into the trough, turning pure white like rice grains. Over time, it will harden completely and can be processed. Form into honeyed pills the size of small beans, and swallow one daily while facing the sun to repel all malevolent spirits and misfortunes. This elixir offers tenfold benefits, enhancing spiritual clarity.

**Immortals’ Longevity Elixir: Refined White Realgar to Preserve Spirit, Control the Hun and Po, and Ward Off All Illnesses**
Take fifty *jin* of realgar and place it in an iron cylinder two *chi* and two *cun* long, four *cun* in diameter at the center, three and a half *cun* wide at the base, and five *fen* thick. Mix saltpeter with water and coat the inside of the cylinder to a thickness of three *fen*, then let it dry. Crush the realgar and place it inside. Fashion an iron sieve with over a hundred holes, like a fumigation strainer, to cover the cylinder’s opening. Fill an iron tray with sesame oil and bury it halfway in the ground, leaving a small hole in the center. Place the tray’s lid over the hole, invert the cylinder onto it, and seal the edges with Six-One Mud to ensure stability. Heat with charcoal in a small, round furnace, positioning the charcoal seven to eight *cun* from the cylinder. When the cylinder glows purple-yellow, the realgar will melt and drip into the oil, forming strands one *chi* long or shorter, around seven to eight *cun*. Collect and process them as before.

For every fifty cycles above and below, when the substance turns a pure red-white like jade, dry it, grind it to powder, and store it in a cylinder. Remove the oil and replace it with clear wine, then alternate as in the method above. Repeat fifty cycles above and below, then grind it to powder again. Combine with one *dou* of *Taiyi* yuliang, mixing thoroughly, and alternate as before. Remove the wine and replace it with rendered honey, alternating as before. After thirty cycles above and below with honey, the medicine will become pure white, firm as a cake. Take daily a dose the size of a parasol-seed, five pellets. After ten days of consumption, the Three Worms will dissolve. After a month of scattered doses, the hun and po will be inwardly secured. After a hundred days, all illnesses will vanish, and the body will feel light and agile. After a year, the skin will shed like a snake’s, cold and heat will be unable to harm you, and malevolent spirits will bring no misfortune. With prolonged use, the dose may gradually be reduced, eventually to a single pellet.

The former master said: To prepare this medicine, first purify yourself through fasting and abstinence, ensuring no woman sees it, for fear of menstrual pollution, which would violate the taboo. This prohibition is most urgent and must not be neglected.

The *Divine Immortals’ Methods of Ingesting and Consuming Stones*, transmitted by Master White Stone from the Eastern Flower Realized One’s technique of boiling stones, enables one to attain immortality and transform the body in myriad ways. Those who consume stones find all illnesses cured, scars and blemishes erased, the intestines thickened and fragrant, the six viscera harmonized, the bones strengthened and qi rectified, the complexion lustrous as jade, the hun and po refined, and the Three Corpses obliterated. Stones are, after all, the parents of gold and jade. They serve to stabilize the marrow and consolidate the blood vessels, and they are also of the same kind as *qiongyao*. They can strengthen the teeth, brighten the eyes, and reverse white hair to black. The essence of gold, jade, and stone is like sesame oil, or the fat of *jusheng*. *Qiongyao* is the congealed sap of gold and jade, just as peach resin is the flowing liquid of the peach tree.

The ancients consumed *jusheng* and swiftly attained longevity. Drinking sesame oil is no less effective than taking *jusheng* powder. Peach bark yields resin, which the immortals refined, though its effects are slower than powdered forms. All things possess inherent efficacy and subtlety, though their wonders are difficult to grasp. Is the method of boiling stones for jade consumption not akin to this?

Few who practice the Way of consuming stones fail to achieve success. The Way of consuming jade is esteemed yet difficult to perfect. The reason is this: rare medicines are hard to obtain, and what is hard to obtain cannot be used consistently. Inconsistency leads to brevity, and rarity leads to lack of focus. Success or failure often hinges on this. How can it compare to consuming stones, which are found everywhere upon the earth? Or to using medicines, when even the great marshes teem with common herbs?

Thus, the method of consuming stones is straightforward and easily pursued, while the formula for *shuiyu* is rare and difficult to procure. Few in the East attain cinnabar immortality—why? The cinnabar method requires *rongguan* and *zengxian*, two substances not native to the eastern lands. Without them, the method is incomplete, the medicine unmade, and thus no cinnabar immortals arise. It is not that there are no cinnabar immortals at all, but those who benefit from cinnabar are few.

Few in the North attain stone immortality—why? The method of boiling stones requires *diyu* and *wuqie*, two substances not native to the northern lands. Their absence makes them difficult to obtain, and without them, stones cannot be consumed, hence the scarcity of stone immortals in the North.

Thus, when Yin Gongdu heard Meng Chuozi and Dong Shizhou conversing, he heard them say: "Better a handful of *wuqie* than a cartload of gold and jade. Better a *jin* of *diyu* than luminous moon pearls." These two had attained immortality through consuming stones and constantly lamented the unavailability of these two substances, hence their dismissal of gold, jade, and pearls.

Gongdu, hearing their words, secretly pondered their meaning and inquired persistently about the use of these substances. After much time, they finally revealed the method of boiling stones to him. It is also called *Dingtanzi*. They said: "If you wish not to die, consume *Dingtanzi*. If you wish to be free of cares, wear *diyu* ash." Gongdu then resolutely gathered his fellow students and disciples—dozens of people in his household—to diligently seek and purchase these medicines, boiling and consuming the stones together. All attained the immortal Way.

Later, they entered the Taihe Mountains of Nanyang together, for the region abounded in fine stones. Thus, Gongdu composed a prophecy: "Gold salt and jade札, cinnabar swallowed—thousands of autumns, ten thousand years as a celestial immortal. Why sit idly and turn to dust? The cinnabar swallowed is *Dingtanzi*." This saying alludes to hidden meanings.

*Wuqie* is also called the mother of gold salt. *Diyu* is also called the father of jade札. The Qiang people of the North call *chi* "札," so it should be called jade *chi*. Only gold salt and jade *chi* can be used to boil *Dingtanzi*.

Thus, when Emperor Shun ascended Mount Cangwu, he said: "Those fragrant herbs of gold and jade—I use them to rest and uphold the true Way." These were *wuqie* and *diyu*.

The Perfected One of Western City, Wang Chang of Mount Wangwu, said: "How to sustain longevity? Why not consume stones and store the mother of gold salt? How to attain long life? Why not consume stones and use the father of jade *chi*?" This, too, is a method of boiling stones.

Now, *wuqie* is the essence of the star of the Five Chariots of Heaven. It corresponds to gold in the Five Lakes, to the Five Virtues in humans, to the Five Directions in position, and to the Five Affairs in things. Thus, when blue essence enters the stem, it yields the liquid of the eastern direction. When white qi enters the node, it yields the sap of the western direction. When red qi enters the flower, it yields the radiance of the southern direction. When dark essence enters the root, it yields the dregs of the northern direction. When yellow mist enters the bark, it yields the numen of *wuji*. The Five Spirits govern life, nurturing and completing it. Those who use it become true immortals; those who consume it revert to infancy.

Ru Dinggong’s mother, Lady Shan, consumed *wuqie* wine and thereby attained immortality.

When the hermit feigned death to depart from the world of yang, none of his contemporaries understood. Zhang Zisheng, styled Zhongyang, and Wang Shucai, styled Shiyan, of Jianshi, consumed the wine and maintained their chambers, living three hundred years and fathering twenty sons. Generations of those who took the powdered *wuqie* wine to extend their years and escape death were too numerous to count—how much more so if combined with the consumption of stones.

In the north, the two elixirs are absent, and mountains rich in stones are few. Only Lühun, Baodu, Qingtian, and Beimu possess white stone, while the rest are vast slabs of rock, towering peaks piled high, impossible to swiftly break apart. Their taste is unpalatable, like eating earth—these are what are called "earth-stones." Consuming them only wards off hunger, with no further benefit. Generally, when consuming stones, one should seek those with fine, dense veins, naturally whole and without cracks or flaws. The five-colored stone pellets are exquisite, sweet as meat. Purple-green stones resemble dried venison; white stones taste like rice; yellow stones like taro; azure stones are slightly pungent; green stones like pickled vegetables. True persons prize them, using them for feasts and storing them as provisions. Each of the five colors has its own unique flavor—truly marvelous.

*Diyu* (burnet) possesses the virtue of minor yin within and receives the qi of grand yang without. Below, it is governed by the spirit of *wuji*; above, it absorbs the essence of Mars. Its fruit is black as fermented beans, embodying the image of yin. Its leaves are red as banners, akin to yang. Though mist and dew settle upon it, its fruit remains dry, for the qi of grand yang is abundant. It thrives in level marshes and blooms in clusters, nourished by moisture. Within and without, it nurtures the two qi of yin and yang, enveloping the supreme virtues of water and fire. Thus, it can melt jade and crumble stone, overcoming hardness and surmounting difficulty. The people of Yue sometimes call it "fermented-bean mother." They roast its black seeds in stone to season food, imparting fragrance. Its roots may also be boiled into a drink, similar to tea. The juice from its roots, when brewed into wine, effectively treats the eight winds and damp impediment. Slicing the stems of *wuqie*, boiling them to extract the juice, and mixing it with glutinous rice to ferment into wine yields a fine brew. Regular consumption cures all diseases, prevents aging, keeps hair from whitening, and strengthens the center. Selecting its roots for brewing is also possible, differing little from the stems—though the roots may be superior.

The roots and bark of *wuqie* can also be powdered to dispel illness and halt aging, though the afflicted often cannot sustain long-term consumption. For *wuqie* roots, ten *jin* should be harvested on the seventh day of the seventh month, or alternatively the ninth day. Days such as *gengwu*, *renwu*, the seventeenth, nineteenth, *jiaxu*, or *jiashen* are also suitable. Digging toward the sun to obtain southward-growing roots or those extending straight downward yields the best results. The digger should fast for a day and night beforehand, bathe, burn incense, and avoid speaking to others about digging the medicine or stepping on any filth. Once collected, dry the roots in the shade for a hundred days, then store them in a cloth bag. Wash them clean before placing them in the bag to dry again. Keep them away from women, birds, and dogs—do not let these see them.

For *diyu* roots, ten *jin* should be harvested on the seventh or ninth day of the seventh month. Days such as *dingmao*, *guimao*, *jimao*, or the ninth day are also favorable. Dig away from sunlight to obtain southward-growing or straight-downward roots. The digger should observe the same fasting and purification as for *wuqie*. Dry the roots in the shade for a hundred days, avoiding all filth.

These two substances may also be placed separately in earthen cauldrons and burned to ash. When needed, take a square-inch spoonful of each. If these two are unavailable, use abundant *su* (perilla) and fragrant leaves, or southward-growing roots, to boil stones. The two medicines need only be of equal proportion, filling the earthen cauldron sufficiently—ten *jin* of roots are not necessary. Dry them in the shade for a hundred days; after two hundred days, they are no longer usable.

Use two earthen cauldrons, lining them with *puli* (a type of rush) and *mao* (hair or fiber), mixed with white clay. Sift the white clay to ensure fineness, then blend it with bitter wine to form a paste. Coat the inside and outside of the cauldrons with this paste multiple times: the outer layer should be one *cun* and three *fen* thick, the inner layer seven *fen* thick. Seal any cracks tightly. Cut the *wuqie* and *diyu* roots into pieces roughly four to five *fen* in size, as thick as bamboo slips. Mix them in equal proportions, then cover the cauldrons and seal the seams with mud. Dry them in the shade for nine days, then reseal any cracks with mud.

Place the cauldrons on a stand and burn firewood beneath them for seven days and nights, requiring three hundred bundles of kindling. The wood must be dry and clean—do not use old firewood. After seven days, let them cool for three days before opening to inspect. If the ash has turned purple-green, the medicine is ready. If not, continue firing for another seven days, day and night. After the second seven days, cool them for three more days—failure is impossible. The fire should surround the cauldrons on all sides. Begin with a gentle flame; if the seven days are not yet complete and the firewood is exhausted, add more. If the seven days conclude and firewood remains, burn it all. Each bundle should be half the circumference of a man’s embrace and five *chi* long, measured by the standard of *yinshang*. The firing may also be done indoors.

Unless they share the same aspiration, do not let others witness the process or learn the name of this numinous medicine.

The ash is named "purple ash." The medicine, when properly refined, is pure white; pound it ten thousand times and store it in a separate vessel. If the color is red, it cannot be used. For *pin gui* that proves effective upon testing, pound it while observing for fine cracks, then seal the cracks with mud to prevent further splitting. Burn it with firewood for seven days and nights; if upon inspection the color is entirely green, it is ready. If not yet green, reseal it with mud and burn for another seven days, then cool for one day. If upon inspection it remains ungreen, repeat the burning as before, taking the green color as the sign of success. Store each in separate vessels.

Take fine, pure-white *ming yao*, in whatever quantity desired, pound it a thousand times, and soak it in mica-infused water until it becomes muddy. Mix these three substances evenly, and store each in separate vessels. When ready to use, take white pebbles from flowing water, the size of peaches or plums, and strike them to break into very fine pieces. For one *dou* of pebbles, place them in a cooking vessel and cover with water, leaving three to four *cun* of water above. Take one *fangcun bi* of each of the three medicines, add them to the vessel, and stir. Boil vigorously, frequently piercing with an implement to check the pebbles; when the water is nearly gone, replenish it. When fully cooked, the pebbles will be easily pierced, resembling boiled taro. Eat to satiety as a substitute for grain. Onions, salted beans, or meat may be added as desired for enhanced flavor.

Master Zhang Taixuan, with over twenty disciples, consumed this in the Luhun Mountains for more than thirty years, all growing robust. They emerged only when the world was at peace. If no red-clay cauldrons are available, red-glazed jars or red bottles may be used. All must first purify themselves for twenty-one days, kindle the fire in a secluded place, and avoid defilement only during the cooking process.

Another method: simply take the roots of *wu qie di yu*, dry them in the shade, and burn them in a cauldron as described above. Once the ash is ready, use three *fangcun bi* to cook one *dou* of pebbles until done—no *ming yao* or mica-infused water is needed.

For cooking stones: on the seventh day of the seventh month, gather *di yu* roots in any quantity, dry them in the shade for a hundred days, and burn them to ash. Then take fresh roots, pound them together with the ash—three parts ash to one part fresh root—and combine. To prepare two or three *dou* of stones, soak them in water with three *cun* of water above, stir in the medicinal powder, and boil until bubbling. When tender like rice cakes, they may be eaten to satiety. They may also be cooked with onions and salted beans like meat—this is the "immortal’s stone-taro stew."

For the Realized One’s method of consuming stones: take stones the size of pigeon eggs, fine and lustrous like jade, ten in number, place them in a bronze vessel, and soak in one *dou* of juice. Add *di yu* ash the size of pigeon eggs, and cook with one *shi* of rice until done. Pound *mu yu* the size of goose eggs, then boil again. Cook with one *shi* of rice until done, piercing with chopsticks; when tender like taro, they may be eaten. The *di yu* roots and leaves are burned to ash for use with *mu yu*, which is cinnamon—or some call it *tong mu gui*.

To enter the mountains and consume stones while fasting: take three types of stones, round and the size of sparrow eggs, twenty-one in total. When ready to consume, first warm the body. At dawn, swallow seven green stones; at midday, seven red stones; at dusk, seven white stones. After ten days of fasting, prepare mallow-seed broth, strain out the dregs, and drink half a *sheng* of the liquid. Soon the stones will descend. Wash the stones, and consume them again the next day. First prepare a thin rice porridge and drink the clear liquid for two days before eating. Wash the used stones and consume them again, then fast for fifteen days. Prepare mallow broth to induce their descent as before, then drink the porridge’s clear liquid for five days. Wash the used stones and consume them again, fasting for a hundred days. Prepare mallow broth once more to induce their descent, then drink the porridge’s clear liquid for ten days. Consume the used stones again, and one may fast for a year. After a year, one may extend this to ten thousand days. Continuously wash and consume the used stones, quenching thirst with water and eating nothing else. After two years of consuming stones, one may walk six hundred *li* in a day, one’s complexion will improve, and one will commune with the divine.

To ascend as an immortal: place stone powder in cold water; after a short while, the water will grow hot as broth and may be drunk. Like drinking jade powder, regular consumption enables one to become weightless, traverse water and mountains, and depart. Where stone powder resides, its *qi* rises uniquely. When the sky rains, the area above remains dry; when the sky is arid, the area above remains warm—this is the celestial counterpart of worldly immortality.

The *Classic* states: "Stones with jade-like whiteness, found in the *qi* of mountains, marshes, or earth, must have a source of fine springs. Drinking this spring water all connects one to the divine."

For consuming stalactites: stalactites are sweet in flavor, non-toxic, and warming. Also called *kong gong ru*, they brighten the eyes, descend *qi*, and replenish essence. To consume, pound them, sift, and take freely, washing them down with wine or water if no wine is available. After a hundred days, one will commune with the divine. With prolonged consumption, all illnesses are dispelled, and one becomes resistant to cold and hunger. When consuming stalactites, one should obtain those with stalactite tips two *cun* in height; those less than one *cun* that break upon touch are superior. Their chambers are called *kong gong nie*, but these are inferior to the stalactite tips.

For consuming red halloysite: red halloysite is sour in flavor and non-toxic. White halloysite is sweet, non-toxic, and neutral. Black halloysite is salty, non-toxic, and neutral. Yellow halloysite is bitter, non-toxic, and neutral. Green halloysite is sour, non-toxic, and neutral. All are medicines for nourishing life and prolonging years.

To refine the five halloysites: pound them into powder, place in water, and grind until fine like sand, with the sediment settling below. Collect the upper portion. Repeat this process fifteen times, then dry.

Daily consumption of three *ge* will eliminate the need for grains, stave off hunger, lighten the body, augment *qi*, and fortify against wind and cold. When taking this medicine, one must fast with utmost sincerity and purity; without such fasting, it must not be taken lightly. If the medicine does not dissolve, it will harm the person. To resolve this, boil hemp seeds to obtain five *sheng* of their juice, which will facilitate its descent. If hemp seeds are unavailable, simmer one *jin* of rich mutton fat and consume it—this is also effective. The five minerals are difficult to obtain; one must handle them with great care.

**Immortals’ Consumption of Purple Fluorite**
Purple fluorite is pungent in flavor, warm, and non-toxic. Consuming purple fluorite bestows a lifespan of three hundred years, and holding it in the mouth prevents hunger and thirst.
