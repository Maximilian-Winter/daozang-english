The *Shangqing Huoluo Qiyuan Fu* (Supreme Clarity Talismans of the Seven Luminaries of Expansive Liberation): This single talisman is to be inscribed in seal script and worn on the person. It originally takes the sun, moon, and five planets as the Seven Luminaries, with an additional six talismans that appear to be those from the *Xiaomo Jing* (Scripture of Dispelling Demons). However, the *Xiaomo Jing* contains forty-nine talismans, all placed in blank spaces of varying sizes within the text. Here, only several are shown, while the rest have been lost.

There is also one yellow talisman, traditionally said to derive from the *Zhengao* (Declarations of the Perfected). The talisman of the Supreme Ultimate Perfected One’s edict to the Northern Emperor of Fengdu, as found in the *Yuma Jing* (Scripture of the Jade Horse), remains unverified.

For the Seven Luminaries Talismans, the secular scriptures provide rough methods of application, though the present use is for wearing. Since the original text offers no explanation, it is deemed appropriate to follow the *Zhengao*: inscribe them in mixed colors upon multicolored silk, receive them, and wear them.

As for the edict talisman to Fengdu, the *Zhengao* states it should be encased in a double-layered purple pouch and worn upon the head.
