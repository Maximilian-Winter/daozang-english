**The Supreme Method of the Golden Mother of Highest Clarity for Seeking Immortality**
*Expounded by* Li Xuanzhen of Mount Lu

The Queen Mother of Highest Clarity addressed the Supreme Lord of the Dao, saying: "I humbly inquire—within the *Scripture of Numinous Treasure*, there exist talismanic diagrams and written texts. Their script is arcane and concealed, and I have not yet received their instruction. Day and night, I revere and gaze upon them, yet dare not presume to approach the numinous countenance.

Though I am unworthy and dwell in the office of Governing Perfection, I have not yet discerned the talismanic formulae. Might they be transmitted to me now? If I could be enlightened in what I have not yet heard, it would be as though I were lifted from obscurity, and my destiny would unfold naturally."

The Lord of the Dao replied: "The texts of the *Numinous Treasure* originated in the Dragon Han era and have endured to this day, passing through kalpas as numerous as grains of sand. The talismanic diagrams are treasured and secret, their script profound and obscure. In ancient times, the Primordial Beginning refined the true script with fire, causing it to gleam and radiate. Once the script became manifest, I came to understand it.

The Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning then commanded the Five Elders to assist in guarding the talismanic formulae of the Five True Scripts, which were concealed within the Golden Tower. None but those who attain the Dao and achieve perfection may come to know them fully.

In former times, the Primordial Heavenly King, upon the Golden Lattice and Jade Terrace, bestowed the talismanic sounds and formulae, permitting their transmission to those of the Dao. It was foretold that in the span of one kalpa, a distant age would produce a sage of lofty virtue, one of the White Emperor’s Western Numinous essence, who would seek these texts.

Now that you have inquired, the sign is already clear. I shall not conceal them but shall expound and proclaim them. You should treasure and record them, taking care not to disseminate them lightly. Should one obtain them, the immortal Dao is thereby attained.

Herein, I have transcribed them into a single scroll. First, the true talismans are drawn, and their sounds are explained. There are nineteen talismans of the Great Simplicity and Yang Generation, their script sealed and secret. Within the great and lesser kalpas, their destined time of emergence may yet be awaited.

Now, I transmit to you the true talismans as revealed in the *Numinous Treasure*, with their sounds explained as follows. The talismans within this scroll are all inscribed in vermilion."

Master Youxuan of Beiyue, from the Chongxuan Lodge of Mount Lu, and Li Xuanzhen of Liaodong, respectfully address fellow Dharma-practitioners and Daoist adepts:

Together we uphold Heaven’s righteousness, jointly revering the supreme enterprise, rescuing from the Three Evils, opening the ford of the Five Paths, guiding the world to flourishing fortune, and shaping the myriad things.

Now, the Three Caverns govern the turning of the kalpas, arising from the Dragon-Han. The great scriptures of the hidden treasuries remain undisclosed in their full manifestation. The essential decisions of the Lingbao One Vehicle’s talisman-diagrams have yet to be fully revealed to the world. In this latter age, those who rely on and receive them grow ever fewer, while errors and omissions multiply. The texts and meanings are rife with discrepancies, deviating from the ancient forms. With few enlightened masters, there is no means to seek or obtain them.

Surveying the scriptures and diagrams revered by fellow practitioners, errors and distortions abound. Though some have concentrated their true essence and steadfastly preserved them, the texts remain largely spurious. The vulgar and competitive crowd, recklessly grasping at scriptures and methods, all claim that by forming covenants with the Five Thearchs and binding themselves to the Dao’s Primordial Beginning, wielding numinous talismans and wearing the insignia of immortal offices, they may rely on their lofty positions to ascend as immortals. Some conceal their forms in secluded peaks, ingesting arts for years on end, their aspirations aligned with herding sheep, their grasp reaching the source of the Dao.

Yet I observe that among fellow practitioners in the world, many bury themselves in remote regions. Advancing, they find no enlightened masters to emulate; retreating, they lack the teachings of the Three Perfected of the Ge lineage. Presumptuously claiming transcendence, they in truth remain mired in emptiness. Upon earnestly examining the principles, it is not that transformation is inherently difficult—rather, it is due to the shallow knowledge of masters and companions, the incomplete transmission of the heritage. Desiring to fathom the luminous mechanism, they are hindered by vast distances and obstacles. Hoping to cross the vast waves, they lack the boat and oars. Their lives pass in sorrow, the path of seeking severed, their years spent in vain, with no awakening or realization.

I, in my humble and lowly state, have fortunately encountered this era. Formerly, I was molded by my teacher’s Perfected guidance, gradually undergoing transformation. Unworthily, I have been extended and supported for over seventy years, yet I have not been able to refine the returning elixir or sustain myself through ingestion and control. Gazing upward at the supreme texts, I have truly forgotten the frost and summer. Studying and perusing the secret records, I have roughly sought to encompass them, yet what I have pursued remains unseen, and I have gathered but a handful.

On the eighth day of the third month in the *gengwu* year, at the lecture seat, I commanded my disciple Wang Yanzhen to open the treasure terrace of my late teacher. Suddenly, from within a brocade-woven bundle, this single scroll was discovered. The assembled disciples gazed in astonishment, their joy and felicity profound. From birth to maturity, they had never heard of or witnessed its transmission.

Thereupon, I offered three taels of gold into the limpid depths of the abyss, reverently receiving the instruction of the Mysterious Master and accepting this text. By the *bingzi* year, seven years had passed, and I transmitted this text to fifty-eight disciples.

The Dao is magnified through people; the supreme transformation should be equitably shared. Now, I dispatch my disciple Wang Yanzhen to proclaim what has not yet been heard. If you have not yet formed an altar covenant, you may receive the decision at the altar. If you have already received the covenant, you may transcribe this scroll onto plain silk, purifying yourself for seven days—or five days or three days—then reverently open and commence the fast.

If transmitting to a new covenant, cease at the former pledge. Receiving this scroll alone may be done with one-third of the original pledge. The Heavenly Perfected treasure their worth; they cannot be summoned in vain. People possess inherent conduct; affairs arise from the heart’s resolve. Do not coerce or entice others to comply with their wishes.

Guard this well; keep it secret.
