**The Supreme Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure Great Compendium Exegesis**
**Recorded by Master Xuan Dong, Lüqiu Fangyuan**

When the Great Dao first divided, it separated into the Five Phases and flowed through the Five Kalpas. At the end of each kalpa and the beginning of the next, a Great Sage would appear in the world, bestowing teachings and expounding scriptures to deliver gods and humans.

The Five Kalpas are as follows: the Wood Kalpa of Dragon Han, the Fire Kalpa of Crimson Brightness, the Metal Kalpa of Extended Prosperity, the Water Kalpa of Open Augustness, and the Earth Kalpa of Supreme Augustness. These cycle endlessly, unfolding into the sun, moon, and stars, the calculations of yin and yang, and the reckoning of time. Below, they manifest as the mountains and marshes, rivers and springs, seas and oceans, as well as the people, birds, and beasts—each governed by its own overseer, all of whom receive their qi and life from the Heavenly Worthy and Great Sage.

At the beginning of the Dragon Han Kalpa, the Heavenly Worthy descended from the Azure Vault Heaven to the Great Floating Li Kingdom in the eastern lands of the great earth, where he preached the Dharma and revealed the *Five Chapters of True Writ* of the *Numinous Treasure Natural Celestial Scriptures*. By the time of the Yellow Emperor Xuanyuan, the Perfected of Heavenly Truth—who had attained perfection in a prior kalpa—transmitted to him in a cavern on Mount Emei the method of guarding the Three Ones, along with the *Crimson Writ of the Yellow Emperor*, all of which were ancient celestial seal-scripts within the Numinous Treasure corpus. After the Yellow Emperor attained the Dao, he sealed these teachings within Mount Zhong in the northwest, then ascended to heaven from Mount Xiandu.

During the reign of Emperor Yao, Gun, father of Yu, was tasked with regulating the waters, but his efforts failed. Yao then entrusted governance to Shun, who executed Gun at Feather Mountain in eastern Yizhou, and appointed Yu to regulate the waters. Grieving that his predecessor’s work had gone unfinished and resulted in execution, Yu wept day and night until a divine emissary in embroidered robes appeared and told him: “The Yellow Emperor, having attained the Dao, sealed the *Five Numinous Talismans* in a recess of Mount Zhong. Take them, and your work in regulating the waters will succeed.” Yu then journeyed to Mount Zhong, where he purified his heart and prayed fervently. Moved by his devotion, the Perfected Duke of Mount Zhong transmitted to him the *Five Numinous Methods* in their entirety. With these, Yu completed his work in regulating the waters. He convened his ministers at Mount Kuaiji, where he further expounded the *Five Talismans* and revealed the names and taboo characters of the Five Thearchs, compiling them into three copies.

One copy was concealed in the Grotto of Dongting’s Baoshan—now known as the Forest Chamber Grotto in Wu County. Later, the King of Wu commanded the Dragon Might Elder to retrieve it, after which it was burned and returned to heaven. Another copy was hidden in Mount Laoshen in the Eastern Sea, but it too was later retrieved by the King of Wu. The third copy was concealed in Stone Grotto Mountain, where it will remain for ten thousand years before emerging to be bestowed upon the Earl of the East, who will once more regulate the floodwaters. Before the Dragon Auspice Abbey on Mount Kuaiji stands Stone Grotto Mountain, which belongs to the Kuaiji region.

During the Wu dynasty, the Left Perfected of Supreme Ultimate, at the age of thirteen, entered a stone cavern on the southern slope of Mount Kuaiji to cultivate with focused intent. By eighteen, he had attained spiritual resonance. Later, on Mount Tiantai, the Three Perfected of Supreme Ultimate and the Supreme Ultimate Dharma Master Xu Laile once more transmitted to him the various methods of the Numinous Treasure, whereupon he synthesized them into the *Sevenfold Regulations of Precepts, Rituals, and Purification Rites*. On the fifteenth day of the eighth month in the second year of the Chiwu era of the Wu, the Perfected ascended to heaven in broad daylight. The Emperor of Wu, Sun Quan, composed his hagiography.

By the reigns of Emperors Wen and Ming of the Liu Song, Master Lu Xiujing of Tranquil Simplicity further expanded and refined these teachings, establishing complete ritual protocols. Thus, the teachings of the Numinous Treasure flourished in the world. From their inception with Xuanyuan to their culmination with Master Lu, the Dharma teachings became perfectly comprehensive, allowing later generations to behold the celestial rites and transmit and practice them without doubt. Those who attained perfection through this teaching are beyond count. Those who inherited and transmitted this lineage, serving as imperial preceptors, have appeared in every generation.

The immortal Han Zhong transmitted the Numinous Treasure methods to Le Zichang, from whom this lineage flows. Zichang cultivated the Dao and attained perfection with nine disciples. The Le Perfected Abbey in Hailing County stands on the site of his former residence. The King of Wu dispatched an envoy bearing the *Five Talismans* to consult Confucius. Without opening the case, Confucius recited a children’s rhyme: *“The Dragon Might Elder, named Hidden Dweller, / Alone entered Baoshan to steal Yu’s writ.”*

During the Kaiyuan era, Emperor Xuanzong obtained a stone talisman in Taolin County, the former residence of Perfected Yin, which was later renamed Lingbao County. A Numinous Treasure Abbey was established south of the city, and a Numinous Talisman Hall was built within the palace—all vestiges of the Numinous Treasure methods.

Many in the world doubt the *Scripture of Salvation for Humanity*. The Heavenly Worthy’s exposition of scriptures differs from worldly texts and talismans, giving rise to confusion. The entire corpus comprises fifty-eight fascicles, with the essential purport contained in the *Scripture of Salvation*. The remaining fifty-seven fascicles expound the origins of ritual protocols, purification rites, and precepts, all rooted in the *Natural Celestial Scriptures*.

In recent times, reciting and chanting this scripture has elicited countless responses. In leisure moments, I have gathered the origins and transmission of these scriptural methods to dispel the doubts of the world and clarify what is true and correct. Before the Han dynasty, texts were written on silk; only after the reign of Emperor Shun of Han were they transcribed on paper and bound into scrolls.
