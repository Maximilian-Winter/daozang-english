**The Supreme Clarity Mirror of Contained Images and Sword Diagram**
Recorded by Sima Chengzhen of White Clouds, Tiantai

The method of the Four Compasses relies solely upon divine arts; the marvel of a thousand years is sought only in the shadow of the crow. Though its radiance captures form and one may behold its appearance, its numinous resonance with images is rarely preserved in its design.

The marvel of the mirror lies in this: its steadfast essence congeals within, serene and still; its limpid brilliance gleams without, and gazing upon it, one attains comprehension. It responds yet does not conceal—thus the heart of the perfected one grows ever more manifest. It illumines and verifies the shadow, and the form of refined transformation is thereby restored.

This is what is called the Dao of steadfast clarity, the rectitude of the divine and numinous. No treasure for reverent contemplation surpasses this instrument, for it allows one to see oneself and also to examine other things.

This mirror is thus round without and square within, taking the image of Heaven and Earth. At its center are arrayed the trigrams, fully manifesting yin and yang. The essence of Great Yang is *Li*, the sun; the essence of Great Yin is *Kan*, the moon. The stellar weft and Five Phases communicate with the Seven Luminaries. Thunder and lightning reside in *Mao*, for *Zhen* is thunder; the celestial abyss lies in *You*, for *Dui* is the marsh. Clouds divide the Eight Trigrams, regulating the four seasons—this expresses the pattern of Heaven.

Its square circulates as water, purging the four twilights. Within is placed the *Lianshan*, to signal the Five Peaks. Mountains and marshes exchange qi, and the ten thousand things abide therein—this establishes the pattern of Earth.

The four-line inscription accords with the principle of the Three Powers. By classifying and extending them, one may grasp their meaning—this entrusts words to clarify the pattern of humanity.

Thus it is called the *Mirror of Contained Images*, for it encompasses their significance. Engraved upon its case, one may examine in detail the image of its craftsmanship.

**The Green-Ground Golden Tortoise**
**Preface to the *Jingzhen* Sword**

The essence of yang is manifest in its name as *jing*; the qi of yin is expressed as *zhen*. Thus it is named *Jingzhen*, perfectly embodying the meaning of refined qi.

It is known that when steadfast essence and qi harmonize, their images resonate. In its operation, the mechanism of its power elicits numinous response. The principle of wielding the divine to supplant form has already been glimpsed in the true compass, yet the art of gathering ghosts and crushing evil has not been heard of in extraordinary craftsmanship. This is why the sword’s surface unites yin and yang, its engraved images modeling Heaven and Earth. *Qian* takes the *kuigang* as its tip; *Kun* positions thunder and lightning at its edge.

Where the *tiangang* descends, what thing does not submit? Where thunder and lightning rage, what thing does not shatter? Worn upon the body, it provides inner and outer defense; applied to things, it serves the uses of humans and ghosts alike.

**Imperial Rescript and Poem by Emperor Xuanzong of Tang**

Having received the presented *Luminous Radiance Treasure Sword* and others, which contain the brilliance of the Two Luminaries and bear the images of the Eight Trigrams, they are sufficient to extend radiance and prolong life, to dispel shadows like the treasures of Fengcheng. Their adornment is rich with sentiment; I humbly compose four verses in response.

The treasure illumines, containing Heaven and Earth;
The divine sword unites yin and yang.
Sun and moon adorn its light and shadow,
Stars and constellations carve its patterns.
The mirror reflects, revealing form and substance;
Worn at the waist, it guards the body.
From this moment of appreciation,
May virtue forever preserve longevity.

**Memorial Presenting the *Mirror of Contained Images* Cast by Master Sima the Celestial Master**

Your servant has heard that when mountains and rivers encounter their time, they may yet display auspicious signs; when plants and trees respond to the turning of the ages, they may still present omens. How much more so for your servant, who was born in an era of flourishing rule and has long dwelled beneath the same roof as the wise? If there be any extraordinary object, it is fitting to present it to the enlightened court.

Your servant previously obtained a *Mirror of Contained Images* cast by the Tang Celestial Master Sima for Emperor Xuanzong, passed down through generations in my family and kept secret for many years. This mirror is round without, modeling Heaven, and square within, emulating Earth. It pairs *Kan* and *Li* with the sun and moon, arranges clouds and qi over mountains and rivers. To the right, it fixes the position of the celestial abyss; to the left, it displays the might of thunder and lightning. The Eight Trigrams are all arrayed; the four twilights are perfectly encircled. It encompasses the Dao within *Qian* and *Kun*, and its efficacy shakes evil spirits.

Thus it is named *Contained Images*, to correspond to the Most Exalted. Its diagram is preserved in the secret teachings; its account is clearly recorded in the *Daoist Canon*.

Your servant, of humble woodcutter-fisherman lineage, is but a coarse and unworthy timber, yet I have presumptuously partaken of the customs of Zou and Lu, and been favored by the transformative influence of the Tang. This mirror is thus difficult to conceal and fitting to make manifest. I respectfully submit it with this memorial, though I fear my tardiness may have offended the imperial ear.

Your servant is overwhelmed with trepidation, prostrate and awaiting your edict.

In the tenth month of the second year of *Jingde*, your servant Wu Ji respectfully submits this memorial on the methods for forging sword-mirrors and the requisite elixirs.

For the forging of sword-mirrors, one must obtain hundredfold-refined true iron. Only when the iron is wrought to perfection, and augmented with cinnabar and silver-infused iron, may it be called a refined sword. Thus, the divine mirrors and sacred swords of high antiquity—from the Yellow Emperor, who received the method from the Divine Minister Shenxu, to its transmission through Zuo Qiuzi, Jing Ye, Gan Jiang, and the marvelous Master Qixiao of Wu and Yue—all converged in the arts of spirit-discerning mirrors and numinous swords.

If later generations fail to obtain cinnabar and silver-infused iron to refine the metal, the forging cannot be accomplished. Now, one must first fire-refine cinnabar into silver, then refine the iron and blend it with the infusion. Selecting the proper year, month, day, and hour, the sword-mirror is cast according to the previously illustrated method. Separate templates for dimensions are also made, as each size follows its own regulated proportions.

**Method for Refining Cinnabar into Silver:**
Take half a *jin* of high-grade silver from mountain marshes, half a *jin* of cinnabar, half a *jin* of lead powder, and half a *jin* of mercury. Grind these evenly and place them in a porcelain vessel, sealing the surface with a three-finger-thick layer. Set it in a sand steamer and steam for seven days. Once cooled, remove it to obtain high-grade silver. Then, seal it tightly in a crucible and place it in an ash pit, nurturing the fire for fourteen days. When the time is complete, apply a five-*jin* fire for forging. Remove it, cover with salt, and temper it—immediately, a supreme treasure is achieved.

The *Shangqing Contained-Image Mirror and Sword Diagrams* are hereby concluded.
