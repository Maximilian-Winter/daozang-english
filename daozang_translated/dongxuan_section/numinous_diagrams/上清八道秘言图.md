**The Esoteric Diagrams of the Eight Dao of Supreme Purity**

**First Dao Secret Saying:**
On the day of *Lichun* (Beginning of Spring), during the *jia-yi* days of the first month, at dawn, gaze northward. If clouds of purple, green, and white appear, these are the Three Primordial Lords of the Supreme Purity, riding the Three Pure Flying Clouds. At that time, the Three Primordials ascend in the Eight-Chariot Wheel to visit the Heavenly August Emperor. Should you witness these three-colored clouds, concentrate your mind, knock your head to the ground, and strike your cheeks in reverence. With focused intent, bow four times and declare: *"Your humble descendant [your name] has from youth cherished the Dao and its virtue, cultivated the Nine Perfected, and bathed the Five Spirits. I have been recorded by the Heavenly Emperor and his Lords. Today, I am fortunate to encounter the procession of the Three Primordials. I humbly beseech to attend and serve at the wheel hub, that my prayers may be granted as I wish."* Should you witness the chariot of the Primordial Lords thrice, you shall ascend to immortality in broad daylight. Prostrate yourself, meditate deeply, and perform a thousand or ten thousand acts of devotion. The prayers and prostrations for the Eight Dao follow this same method—these are the so-called *Eight Dao Secret Sayings*. Those not destined for immortal records shall not hear them.

**Attire:** Azure-green crown, pale green mantle, red ascending robe, red banner, five-colored clouds. Attendants should dress appropriately.

On the day of *Chunfen* (Spring Equinox) and during the *yin-mao* days, at midnight, gaze northeast. If clouds of dark green and yellow appear, these are the Three Pure Clouds of the Heavenly Emperor of the Grand Tenuity. At that time, the Heavenly Emperor of the Grand Tenuity ascends in the Eight Radiant Chariot to visit the Highest Jade Sovereign. Upon witnessing this, concentrate your mind and prostrate yourself as described above. Should you see the Emperor’s chariot four times, you shall be greeted in broad daylight by a dragon-drawn carriage with a feathered canopy, ascending to heaven.

The Eight Dao Secret Sayings are now complete. Upon witnessing these signs, concentrate your mind, knock your head to the ground, strike your cheeks four times, bow twice, and make your declaration as described above. You should first bathe, burn incense, and await the appointed time. Gaze outward for the duration of a meal, then return to your chamber. The Three Pure Clouds each have their own colors, their qi rising and falling in layers, accumulating in accordance with the order of your prayers.

Should you witness the Three Lights and Three Pure Clouds at the advent of the *Li Chun* solar term, the purple cloud shall appear above, the green cloud beneath it, and the white cloud at the lowest tier, all overlapping in layers. Observe them with utmost care. The "early ten-day period" refers to the ten days following the first *jiazi* day after the new moon, which must itself be a *jiazi* day. Even if these clouds appear on days or at times not prescribed, you should still bow in reverence, pray devoutly, and place your faith in them, for you shall behold them on the appointed day. Those who practice the affairs of the Nine Perfected and the Controller of the Eight Dao shall have their forms guarded by heavenly beings, and the True Sovereign shall protect their life and bones. Without one’s name recorded in the jade registers of immortality, this scripture must not be shown to them; even if they seek it earnestly, they shall never witness its signs.

In practicing this Dao, ensure no one treads upon your shoes or touches your headscarf and coarse garments. Keep your footwear pristine and your clothing immaculate. This path abounds with prohibitions: the residual *qi* of the seven *po* souls transforms into dragons and tigers, guarding the earthly thresholds beneath your shoes, while the residual spirits of the three *hun* souls manifest as the Five Numinous Clouds, hovering above your headscarf. Should these be violated, your heart shall tremble and your intent falter; you may suddenly lose yourself, leading to the depletion of spirit, the scattering of the *hun*, and the dimming of your vital radiance. Remain ever vigilant—no soil, filth, or foul earth may linger beneath your shoes. Keep the interior and exterior of your clothing chest free from grime, for the taint of impurity must not defile it.

Seventeen Highest Jade Lads and seventeen Jade Maidens attend the scripture, ensuring that those who possess this text establish merit, amend transgressions, and ward off inauspicious omens. The noble one who studies this scripture must retire to a secluded chamber, burn incense to left and right. When transmitting the text, it may only be done in the presence of a fast; the method of transmission requires both parties to fast in stillness, purifying their hearts and unifying their intent, so that spirits and gods may scrutinize their sincerity. The *Lingbao* scriptures encompass the affairs of the Nine Perfected and the names of the twenty-four spirits; in reciting invocations and prayers, speak directly to the celestial will. Thus, the transmission begins with a fast, and an oath is sworn against divulgence. The two parties shall fast together for twenty-four days, with an additional day of fasting before and after. Once the scripture is handed to the disciple, they shall copy it in full, then cut a lock of hair and bind it as a token of sincerity to present to the master. For the oath, use nine *zhang* of white silk as a substitute for the blood-sealing pledge. White silk represents the *qi* of the Great Simplicity, and nine *zhang* corresponds to the number of the Nine Perfected. After receiving the scripture, one must not disclose it, boast of virtue, slander the upright, prattle idly, or act improperly, lest the true Dao be defiled. Those who honor and cultivate this scripture shall ascend at dawn in broad daylight.
