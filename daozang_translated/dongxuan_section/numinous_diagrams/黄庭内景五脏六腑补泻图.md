**Illustrated Diagram of the Inner Yellow Court: The Five Zàng-Organs, Six Fǔ-Organs, and Methods of Tonification and Drainage**
*Preface by Master Hu Jiāshù of the Pure Essence Sect, seen at Mount Tàibái*

The Celestial is dominated by **Yáng**—it nourishes mortals with the **Five Qi** (五氣);
The Terrestrial is dominated by **Yīn**—it nourishes mortals with the **Five Flavors** (五味).
When **Qi** and flavors interact, they coalesce into the **Five Zàng-Organs** (五臟).
The **Qi** of the Five Zàng-Organs disperses into the four limbs, sixteen segments (十六部),
and the three hundred and sixty joints (三百六十關節),
while forming the sinews and vessels (筋脈),
the **jīn-yè** (津液) and blood marrow (血髓),
and nurturing the Six Fǔ-Organs (六腑),
the Three Burners (三焦),
and the Twelve Channels (十二經),
all converging to permeate the nine orifices (九竅).

Thus, the Five Zàng-Organs are the foundation of human form.
If one organ is damaged, illness arises;
If all five are impaired, the spirit perishes.
Hence, the Five Zàng-Organs are the dwelling of **shén** (神), **míng** (明), **hún** (魂), **pò** (魄), **zhì** (志), and **jīng** (精),
each organ presiding over its own aspect.
Therefore:
The **Heart** (心) governs **shén**,
The **Lungs** (肺) govern **pò**,
The **Liver** (肝) governs **hún**,
The **Spleen** (脾) governs **yì** (意),
The **Kidneys** (腎) govern **zhì**.

When these energies manifest externally,
they correspond above to the **Five Stars** (五星),
and below to the **Five Sacred Mountains** (五嶽).
All are patterned after the **Dao** of Heaven and Earth,
embodying the **symbols** of the Sun and Moon,
touching upon categories and drawing analogies—
too vast to fully articulate.

If one can cultivate the spirit (存神),
nourish the **Qi** (修養),
restrain oneself (克己),
and strengthen resolve (勵志),
then the **Dao** is achieved.

When the Five Zàng-Organs are firm and robust,
they resist the intrusion of **xīng-fǔ** (腥腐) toxins within,
and external diseases and **Qi** cannot harm them.
Clarity and insight are pure,
aging is reversed and life prolonged,
ambition soars toward the **Immortal Way** (神仙),
the body knows no fatigue or constraint,
while the **luminous essences** of the Sun and Moon (日月精光) come to adhere to my form,
and the **Six Qi** (六氣) of the four seasons merge harmoniously with my body.
Entering the **path of transformation** (變化之道),
penetrating the **principles of the spirit** (神明之理),
grasp the interplay of **Yīn** and **Yáng** (把握陰陽),
and breathe in the **refined spirit** (呼吸精神).
The **Creator** (造物者) will be turned to my own dominion.

At this stage,
no need for **elixirs of gold and jade** (金丹玉液),
or the **Great Return** (琅牙大還).
Naturally, the spirit ascends to **emptiness** (神化沖虚),
**Qi** harmonizes with **Tàihé** (氣合太和),
and one ascends to the **Celestial River** (升雲漢).
The **Qi** of the Five Zàng-Organs coalesces into **Five Clouds** (五雲) and enters the heavens,
left calling forth the **Yáng-spirit** (陽神) of the **Six Jiǎ** (六甲),
right invoking the **Yīn-spirit** (陰神) of the **Six Dīng** (六丁),
through myriad transformations,
riding the **flying clouds and winds** (驭飛輸) at will.

Thus, those who fail to awaken
toil and seek externally,
truly unaware of the **Dao of Life** (知生之道).

Therefore, the **Tàishàng** (太上) says:
*"Essence is my spirit, Qi is my Dao.
Nurture the essence to preserve the Qi,
maintain firm and steadfast integrity,
and let Yīn and Yáng converge
to establish my form."*

Alas, my innate nature is dull,
yet from youth I have aspired to the **Mystic Gate** (玄門),
refining my resolve to **non-action** (無為),
dwelling my heart in **tranquility** (澹泊).
Studying the profound **Dao** of the *Yellow Court*,
exhausting the remnants of the *Blue Scroll*,
with burning focus and meticulous effort,
I have spent many years.
When I encountered the old diagram’s hidden depths,
its **passages** (津路) were profound and obscure,
its words and principles esoteric—
few dared to follow its traces.

Some merely pointed to its **colors and symbols** (色象)
or vaguely noted the names of the spirits (神名),
leading later generations astray,
while sectarian compilers introduced erroneous doctrines.
Thus, disciples of later years rarely found its true path,
and even slight deviations led to vast errors.

Now, I dare to compile what I have observed,
to exhaust all I have heard,
cross-referencing the **scriptures** (經),
and creating new diagrams.

First, I clarify the Zàng and Fǔ-organs,
then expound upon cultivation methods,
and further trace the origins of diseases,
expelling and absorbing **Qi** to dispel afflictions.
Additionally, I gather **pharmacological principles** (藥理),
**guided movements** (導引) and **flexible extensions** (屈伸),
**diagnostic coloration** (察色) and **evidence-seeking** (尋證),
as well as **monthly dietary restrictions and prohibitions** (月禁食忌),
so that future scholars,
upon unfolding the diagram, may discern the **Six Emotions** (六情),
and opening the **scriptures**, may reveal all **myriad truths** (萬品).

Written in the **year Wùchén of the Dàzhōng era** (大中二年戊辰).

**Master Sūn Sīmiào’s Commentary** states:
*"Mortals receive their life from Heaven and Earth,
thus within they possess the Five Zàng-Organs, Six Fǔ-Organs,
**jīng** and **Qi** (精氣),
bones and marrow (骨髓),
sinews and vessels (筋脈),
and externally, the four limbs and nine orifices (四肢九竅),
skin, fur, claws, and teeth (皮毛爪齿),
throat, esophagus, lips, and tongue (喉咽唇舌),
anus, and the **pāngnáng** (胖囊)—
all these combine to form the body.

Thus, when **rest and activity** (將息) are regulated properly,
the hundred limbs are in perfect harmony,
but when **labor and exertion** (役用) are misapplied,
they lead to the **Five Strains, Seven Injuries, and Six Extremities** (五勞七傷六極).
If there is a method to heal, even illness has no other cause;
if no method can be relied upon, one’s fate is sealed.

Therefore, this diagram comprehensively describes
the Five Zàng-Organs, Six Fǔ-Organs,
the **roots and sources of blood and vessels** (血脈根源),
their **circulation and interconnection** (循環連注),
and the **convergence with the nine orifices** (九竅應會處所).
If one can **retain the mind** (留心),
examine and practice accordingly,
then all internal and external maladies have no refuge.

As for cultivation:
The hair should be **frequently combed** (發宜多栉),
the teeth **often struck** (齿宜數叩),
the **jīn-yè** (津液) **must be swallowed** (液宜常咽),
the **Qi** **must be refined** (氣宜清煉),
and the hands **should rest upon the face** (手宜在面).
These five principles are what is meant by:
*'A son who wishes not to die must cultivate Mount Kūnlún.'*

From this arises the **refinement of elixirs** (煉丹) to fortify the body,
**rejecting grains** (卻粒) to lighten it,
discarding **earthly talismans** (土符),
and inscribing **golden patterns** (金格).
One **faces Heaven and absorbs the Sun’s essence** (朝天吸日),
**commands the Qi** (驭氣) to attain **emptiness** (沖虚)—
these are the arts of the **adept** (術士).

The *Yuānshǐ Tàixuān Jīng* (元始太玄經) states:
*"Excessive joy and anger harm one’s nature,
and even slight indulgence in pleasure harms the spirit.
If the nature is impaired, life is endangered;
If the spirit is harmed, the body is threatened.
Thus, one must **nourish the nature** (養性) to preserve the **Qi**,
and **protect the spirit** (保神) to calm the heart.
When the **Qi** is complete, the body is balanced;
When the heart is tranquil, the spirit is free—
this is the **mystic key** (妙訣) to preserving life."*

**Diagram of the Lung-Zàng (肺臟圖)**
*"To treat the Lungs, one must **swallow** (咽).
**Swallowing** (咽) is **drainage** (泻),
**absorbing** (吸) is **tonification** (補).
The Lungs are the **Metal** (金) **Lung-Zàng** (商肺),
the **canopy** (華蓋) of the Five Zàng-Organs,
rooted above in the chest.
They have six lobes, their color like **unbleached silk** (色如缟) tinged with red.

In general, when a man reaches eighty,
his **Lung-Qi** (肺氣) weakens,
and his **pò** (魄) scatters and dissipates.
Their weight is **three cātyīn, three liǎng** (重三斤三兩).
The **West** (西方) is associated with **white** (白色),
which permeates the Lungs,
opens the orifices at the **nose** (鼻),
and manifests externally as **skin and fur** (皮毛).
The Lung vessels emerge at the **Lesser Commercial** point (少商).
The Lungs are the **source of the hundred breaths** (長氣),
the **foundation of all Qi** (本氣),
and thus all **Qi** belongs to them.
Prolonged **lying down** (久臥) harms the **Qi**.

The **Heavenly Qi** (天氣) circulates through the Lungs,
for they are the **precise origin** (精源) of **breathing** (呼吸),
the **office of transmission and delivery** (傳送之官).
They are also the **Gate of the pò** (魄門),
the **Upper Jade Hall** (上玉堂)."

The Lungs are the **office of reception and transmission** (相傳之官),
their **liquid** (於液) manifests as **nasal mucus** (涕).
**Nasal mucus** (涕) is the Lung’s **vital essence** (津液);
when **Kidney evils** (腎邪) invade the Lungs, **nasal mucus** becomes excessive.

The Lungs originate on the **right** (右),
they govern **wheezing and coughing** (喘咳).
Among the **Six Fu** (六腑), the **Large Intestine** (大腸) is the Lung’s **granary** (府),
joined with the Lungs as the **office of transmission, discharge, and guidance** (傳泻行導之府).
Of the **Five Senses** (五官), the **nose** (鼻) is the Lung’s **orifice** (官);
when the Lung-**Qi** (肺氣) flows freely, the nose discerns **fragrance and stench** (香臭).
If the Lungs are diseased, the nose fails to perceive **fragrance and stench**.

The Lungs connect with **skin** (皮), nourishing **hair and fur** (毛).
When **skin hardens** (皮聚) and **hair falls out** (毛落), the Lungs are the first to die.

The Lungs belong to the **West** (西方), the **Jue/Metal** (兑金) phase.
Metal receives **Qi** at the **Yin Hour** (寅),
generates it at the **Si Hour** (巳),
reigns at the **You Hour** (酉),
falls ill at the **Hai Hour** (亥),
dies at the **Wu Hour** (午),
is buried at the **Chou Hour** (丑),
and corresponds to **Autumn** (秋日),
the **Geng/Xin/Regent days** (庚辛辰),
the **Shen/You days** (申酉),
and the **Metal element** (金).
Their **tone** (聲) is **Shang** (商),
their **color** (色) is **white** (白),
their **taste** (味) is **spicy** (辛),
and their **odor** (臭) is **rancid** (腥).
When **Heart evils** (心邪) enter the Lungs, one loathes **rancid odors**.

Their **nature** (性) is **righteous** (義),
their **emotion** (情) is **anger** (怒).
Externally, they respond to **Mount Tai** (西岳),
ascending to **Tàibái** (太白) and receiving its **refined essence** (精).
They unite with the **Large Intestine** (大腸),
and govern above the **nose** (鼻).

Thus, when **Lung-Wind** (肺風) afflicts a person, it causes **nasal congestion** (鼻塞).
When a person’s **complexion is withered** (容色枯), the Lungs are **dry** (乾).
When a person’s **nose itches** (鼻痒), the Lungs harbor **parasites** (虫).
When a person is **prone to fright** (多怖), the **pò** (魄) has departed the Lungs.
When a person’s **body is dark and dull** (體黨黯), the Lung-**Qi** is **weak** (微).
When a person is **excessively breathy** (多氣), the Lungs are **abundant** (盛).
When a person **cannot endure cold** (不耐寒), the Lungs are **exhausted** (勞).
When a person **favors spicy foods** (好食辛味), the Lungs are **deficient** (不足).
When a person’s **intestines rumble** (肠呜), the Lung-**Qi** is **obstructed** (壅).
When a person’s **complexion is fresh and white** (颜色鮮白), the Lungs harbor no **evils** (無惡).
If **Lung evils** (肺邪) enter from within, one tends to **weep excessively**.

Since the Lungs govern **Shang** (商), when they fall ill, one must use **coughing** (咽).
**Coughing** (咽) is the Lung’s **Qi** (氣).
Their **righteous Qi** (義氣) can **draw out Lung evils** (抽肺之疾),
thus when a person’s **chest is filled with resentment** (怨氣), causing **oppression** (填塞胸臆),
they must **cough deeply** (長咽) and **discharge it** (泄之),
for this is the **natural principle** (自然之理).
If one fails to **cough**, the **evils** will surely **injure and defeat** (傷敗),
relying on **coughing** (咽) to **preserve wholeness** (獲全).
Thus, for Lung **illnesses** (疾), one must **cough and discharge** (用咽泄之).
If a person **coughs without distress** (無苦而咽), this is **ominous**.

**Cultivation Methods** (修養法):
In the **three months of Autumn** (秋三月), at the **beginning or end of the month** (朔望) and **dawn** (旭旦),
face the **West** (西), sit upright,
**cough seven times** (鼓七) to the **Heavenly Qi** (天氣),
**drink three mouthfuls** (玉泉三) from the **Jade Spring** (玉泉),
then close the eyes, steady the mind,
and **inhale the white Jue-Qi** (吸兑宫白氣) from the **West** (入口),
swallowing it **seven times** (七吞),
and **retain the breath for seventy breaths** (閉氣七十息).
This is to **harmonize and supplement the spirit** (調補神氣),
and **settle the wandering pò** (息靈魄之所致).

**Diagnosing Lung Diseases** (相肺脏病法):
If the Lung is **hot** (熱), the **right cheek** (右頬) turns **red** (赤).
If the Lung is diseased, the **complexion is pale** (色曰) and **hair withered** (毛槁),
with **wheezing and coughing** (喘咳逆),
**discomfort and pain in the chest, back, and limbs** (胸背及四肢煩疼),
or dreams of **beautiful women suddenly arriving to be intimate** (美人乍來親近).
If the Lungs are **empty** (虛), one has **shortness of breath** (少氣) and **cannot exhale fully** (不能報息).
If the Lungs are **dry** (燥), the **throat is parched** (喉乾).
If **Lung-Wind** (風) afflicts, one **sweats profusely** (多汗) and **fears the wind** (畏風),
with **frequent coughing** (時欲咳) like **breathing difficulties** (氣喘),
better in the **morning** (日一則善),
worse in the **evening** (暮則甚).
If **Lung-Qi** (肺氣) **rises in reverse** (上逆), one must **consume bitter foods** (急食苦) to **discharge it** (泄之).
It is also said:
When the Lungs are diseased and **tend to collapse** (欲收), one must **consume sour foods** (食酸以收之),
use **spicy** (辛) to **supplement** (補之),
and **bitter** (苦) to **discharge** (泻之).
**Avoid cold foods**, for the Lungs **detest cold**.

If the Lungs are diseased, the **nose is congested** (鼻塞不通),
**cannot perceive fragrance or stench** (不聞香臭),
or **polypi** (瘟肉) form,
or **sores** (疮) arise,
with **itchy skin** (皮膚癢痒),
**loathsome sores and scabies** (惡疮疥癬),
**rising Lung-Qi** (上氣) causing **coughing** (咳嗽),
and **nasal mucus mixed with pus and blood** (涕唾脓血),
one should **administer the Pái Fēng Sǎn prescription** (宜服排風散方):

**Ren Shen** (人參) – seven parts
**Fáng Fēng** (防風) – eight parts
**Qiāng Huó** (羌活) – eight parts
**Shā Shēn** (沙參) – five parts
**Tiān Xióng** (天雄) – eight parts
**Shǔ Pián** (薯苹) – ten parts
**Dān Shēn** (丹參) – seven parts
**Kǔ Shēn** (苦參) – eight parts
**Qín Huāng** (秦荒) – eight parts
**Shān Zhū Yú** (山茱萸) – eight parts
**Xuán Shēn** (玄參) – seven parts
**Pound into powder** (右捣篩為末),
**take on an empty stomach** (空腹) with **Fáng Fēng broth** (防風湯),
**three qián, one sháo** (下三錢一匕).

**Method for Regulating the Six Lung-Qi** (治肺六氣法):
Use **coughing and inhaling** (吐納用咽法),
with **gentle nasal inhalation** (以鼻微長引氣),
and **swallowing through the mouth** (以口咽之),
**ensuring the ears do not hear** (勿令耳聞).
First, **adjust the Qi** (調氣) and **order it** (令和),
then **swallow** (咽之).
For Lung **illnesses** (病), use **deep coughing thirty times** (大咽三十遍),
and **gentle swallowing thirty times** (細咽三十遍),
to **eliminate Lung evils** (去肺家勞),
**rising heat** (熱上氣), **coughing** (咳嗽),
**itchy skin** (皮膚癢痒),
**limb fatigue and discomfort** (四肢勞煩),
and **nasal coldness** (鼻寒) with **chest and back pain** (胸背疼痛).
Follow the method; when the **illness abates** (疾差), cease.
**Overdoing it** (過度) will **harm** (损).

**Monthly Dietary Restrictions** (月禁食忌法):
In the **seventh month** (七月), **avoid eating Shan Zhu Yu** (勿食茱萸),
for consuming it causes **bloody dysentery** (血痢).
In the **eighth and ninth months** (八月、九月),
**avoid eating too much raw ginger** (勿多食生姜),
for it **aggravates Liver, Heart, and Lung diseases** (並肝心肺之病).
It is fitting to **consume millet and peaches** (宜食黍桃),
and **forbid bitter tastes**.

**Lung Organ Guidance Method** (肺脏导引法):
Perform in the **seventh, eighth, and ninth months** (七月八月九月行之).
Sit upright,
place both hands on the ground,
**curl the body** (縮身) and **bend the spine** (曲脊),
**lift upward three times** (向上三舉) to **remove Lung evils** (去肺家風邪积勞).
**Pound the fists against the upper back** (反拳槌背上),
**three to five times on each side** (左右各三五度),
to **expel chest and diaphragm Wind evils** (去胸臆问風毒),
and **retain the breath** (閉氣為之).
Upon completion, **close the eyes for a long while** (良久閉目),
**swallow three times** (三咽掖),
**knock the teeth together three times** (三叩齿),
and **rest**.

The Heart’s correspondences lie with the **pulse**, its **honor** being its color.
When the Heart’s pulse is **depleted and scant**, failing to nourish the **zàng-fu organs**, the Heart dies first.

It governs the **south**, the **summer season**, the **celestial stems** *bing* and *ding*, the **earthly branches** *chen* and *wu*, **fire**, the **zhi voice**, the **red hue**, the **bitter taste**, its **odor** is **burnt**, its **virtue** is **propriety**, its **emotion** is **joy**.
Externally, it corresponds to **Southern Mount**, ascending to commune with the **precise essence of Mars**.
The Heart merges with the **small intestine**, governing its **blood and pulse**, ascending to govern the **tongue**.
Thus, when a person’s **Heart Wind** arises, the **tongue retracts** and speech is lost.
When **blood stagnates**, the **Heart is startled**.
When the **tongue discerns no flavors**, the **Heart is vacuous**.
When one **forgets much**, the **Heart’s spirit is detached**.
When speech is **repetitive**, the **Heart is disordered**.
When one is **excessively sorrowful**, the **Heart is injured**.
When one **cravs bitter tastes**, the **Heart is deficient**.
When the **face is green-black**, the **Heart is frozen**.
When the **complexion is ruddy and fair**, the **Heart harbors no vice**.

When **Lung evils invade the Heart**, speech becomes **prolific**.
The Heart governs the **zhi voice**; when the Heart is diseased, one must use the **method of exhalation (he)**.
**Exhalation (he)** is the Heart’s **qi**; its **virtue** is propriety.
Exhalation can **calm the Heart** and **harmonize the spirit**.
Thus, those in **confusion and disorder** often exhale—
this is the **natural breath of Heaven**.
Hence, when the Heart is diseased, exhalation must be employed to **drain it**.

---
**Cultivation Method**:
In the **fourth and fifth months**, at the **new moon’s dawn**, face south and sit upright.
**Strike the Golden Beam nine times** (叩金梁),
**rinse the Jade Spring three times** (漱玉泉),
and **meditate quietly**, inhaling the **crimson qi of the *Li Gong*** through the mouth,
swallowing it **three times**.
Hold the breath for **thirty breaths** to **restore the loss from exhalation**.

---
**Diagnosing Heart Organ Diseases**:
When the Heart is **hot**, the **complexion is red** and the **pulse overflows**.
When the Heart is diseased, the **face first reddens**, **ulcers form in the mouth** and rot,
pain radiates through the **chest, shoulders, ribs, back, and inner arms**.
Some dream of **a red-clad figure wielding a red blade and fire** to terrify them.
When the Heart is **vacuous**, pain **draws the chest, abdomen, and waist together**.

It is also said:
When the Heart is diseased, it **yearns for moisture**—
urgently consume **salty foods to moisten it**,
use **bitter** to **supplement it**,
use **sweet** to **drain it**.
Avoid **damp garments and hot foods**; the Heart **abhors heat and water**.

When the Heart is diseased, **dynamic qi** appears **above the navel**.
Pressing it feels **firm and painful**; the patient is **agitated and restless**.
When the Heart is diseased, the **palms and soles are hot**.

If the Heart is diseased:
The **mouth is dry**, the **tongue stiff**, the **throat and mouth painful**,
swallowing is **difficult**, **ulcers form in the mouth**,
one **forgets what came before and after**, and dreams of **furnaces and forges**.
**Five-Parameter Pill** is indicated:
**Xinjiang Aster (秦艽)** – 7 parts
**Ginseng (人参)** – 7 parts
**Salvia Root (丹参)** – 7 parts
**Scrophularia (玄参)** – 10 parts
**Dried Ginger (干姜)** – 10 parts
**Glutinous Millet (沙参)** – 5 parts
**Ziziphus Spines (酸枣仁)** – 8 parts
**Kudzu Root Powder (苦参粉)** – 8 parts
**Pulverize and sift**, mix into pills the size of **Chinese catalpa seeds**.
Take **20 pills** in **empty stomach with ginseng decoction**, twice daily.

---
**Six Qi Method**:
To treat Heart diseases, use the **exhalation (he) method**:
Gradually draw breath through the **nose**, then exhale through the **mouth**,
adjusting the **qi** as above—**do not let the sound reach the ears**—
then exhale forcefully.

When the Heart is diseased, perform **three deep exhalations**, followed by **ten gentle exhalations**,
to **dispel Heart labor-heat and all agitation**.
When the illness abates, **stop**; overuse **harms**.

---
**Taboos During Lunar Eclipses**:
In the **fourth month**, avoid **garlic**—
it **prematurely whitens hair** and causes **hair loss**.
In the **fifth month**, avoid **leeks**—
they **injure Heart qi** and are **toxic**; also avoid **Heart and Kidney foods**.

When the Heart **aches**, consume **wheat, barley, and lotus seeds**; avoid **salty foods**.

---
**Heart Organ Guidance Method** (to be practiced in the **fourth and fifth months**):
Sit upright, clench both hands into **fists**, and **pound the chest** **five to six times** on each side.
Alternatively, sit upright and **raise one arm upward**, striking the air as if **lifting a heavy stone**.
Then, **clasp both hands tightly** and **stomp on them with the feet**, **five to six times**.
This **expels Wind evils from the Heart and chest**.
Hold the breath during the exercise.
Upon completion, **close the eyes for a long while**, **swallow saliva three times**, and **knock the teeth together three times** before resting.

---
**Liver Organ Diagram**:
To treat the Liver, use the **inhale-exhale (xū) method**—
**exhalation (xū)** drains, **inhalation** supplements.

The Liver is the **Wood Palace**, residing **left-lower and near the Heart**, with **three lobes on the left** and **four on the right**, its hue like **white silk, patterned like tongs**.
By age **sixty**, a man’s **Liver qi declines**, the **lobes thin**, the **gallbladder fades**, and **vision dims**.

Weighing **four *liang* and four *two-liang*** (十二两),
its **bundle-direction** is **east**, its **color green**, penetrating the **Liver**, opening at the **eyes**, manifesting in the body as **sinews**.
The Liver’s pulse emerges from **Mù** (木),
its color **green and lustrous**, symbolizing **superimposed large and small**.
The Liver is the **source of exhaustion**, the **dwelling of the soul (hun)**.
Its **fluid** is **tears**; when **Kidney evils invade the Liver**, **tears flow excessively**.

The **gallbladder**, a **fu organ**, is the Liver’s **storehouse**, merging with it.
The **eyes** are the Liver’s **official**.
When **Liver qi flows**, the **five colors are discerned**; when the Liver is **replete**, the **eyes turn red-yellow**.

The Liver merges with the **pulse**, its **honor being the nails**.
When the Liver’s **sinews relax** and the **pulse cannot sustain itself**, the Liver dies first.

It governs the **east**, the **spring season**, the **celestial stems** *jia* and *yi*, the **earthly branches** *yin* and *mao*, **wood**, the **jiao voice**, the **green hue**, the **sour taste**, its **odor** is **turbulent**.
When **Heart evils invade the Liver**, **irritability arises**.

Externally, it corresponds to **Eastern Mount**, ascending to commune with the **precise essence of Jupiter**.
In **spring’s third month**, **store the green qi of Jupiter** within the Liver.

The Liver merges with the **gallbladder**, ascending to govern the **eyes** and also the **sinews**.
Thus, when a person’s **Liver is vacuous**, the **sinews contract**.
When the **skin is withered**, the **Liver is hot**.
When **muscles bear dark patches**, it is **Liver Wind**.
When a person’s **complexion is green**, the **Liver is盛 (shèng)**.
When one **cravs sour tastes**, the **Liver is deficient**.
When **hair withers**, the **Liver is injured**.
When the **hands and feet sweat profusely**, the **Liver is undiseased**.

When **Lung evils invade the Liver**, one **laughs excessively**.
The Liver governs the **sinews**; when the Liver is diseased, one must use the **inhale-exhale (xū) method**.

「嘘者，肝之气，其气仁能除毁痛，皆自然之理也。
**Xū** is the **Liver’s qi**; its **qi** is gentle and can dispel destructive heat—all are natural principles.

修养法 以春三月朔旦，束面平坐，叩齿三通，闭气九息，吸震宫青气，入口九吞之，以补嘘之损，享青龙之杞。
**Cultivation Method**: On the first day of the **third month of spring**, bind the face and sit upright, strike the teeth three times, hold the breath for nine inhalations, and draw in **Jupiter’s green qi** from the **Shèn Palace**. Swallow it nine times to replenish what **xū** has depleted, thus nourishing the **Green Dragon’s virtue**.

相肝脏病法 肝热者，左颊赤。
**Diagnosing Liver Organ Diseases**: When the **Liver is hot**, the left cheek is red.

肝病者，目夺而胁下痛引小腹，令人喜怒。

When the **Spleen is diseased**, there is **moving *qi* near the navel**; pressing reveals **tightness**, accompanied by **painful counterflow of *qi***, **acute small intestine pain**, **diarrhea**, and **heaviness in the feet from cold**. The **Spleen’s disease** manifests as **flanks distended with fullness**, **indigestion**, **frequent regurgitation**, **inability to swallow food**, **heaviness in the back and shoulders**, ***qi* distension surging to the heart**, and **limb vacuity-swelling**. **Ingest the Hèlìlè Pill**:

**Six *Qi* Method** – To treat the **Spleen**, use **exhalation**. Gradually draw *qi* through the **nose** and exhale through the **mouth**. For **Spleen disease**, perform **30 deep exhalations** and **10 shallow exhalations**; this dispels all **Spleen *lingqi*** and **robust heat**. For **cholera, undigested food, hemiplegia, and Spleen masses**, exhale repeatedly—**without pause** until symptoms abate. **Overuse harms**.

**Taboos During Lunar Eclipses** – In the **sixth month**, do not eat **Chinese wolfberry**, lest one suffer **bloody or white dysentery**. In all seasons, avoid **Spleen and Liver meats, mutton, and lamb’s blood**.

For **Spleen disease**, consume **glutinous rice, dates, and hemp seeds**; **avoid sour flavors**.

**Spleen-Guiding Method** (to be practiced in the **sixth month and all seasons**) – Extend one leg fully, then **pull backward with both hands**, repeating **3–5 times**. Alternatively, kneel and **push against the ground with both hands**, arching backward with **fierce gaze**, repeating **3–5 times**. This dispels **Spleen accumulations, wind evils, and toxic *qi***.

---
**Kidney Diagram** – To treat the **Kidney**, use **blowing** (to **drain**), **inhaling** (to **supplement**). The **Kidney** is the **Water Official**. The **left Kidney** aligns with the **right Mingmen**; it faces the **navel**, resting against the **lumbar spine**, its hue **pale yellow tinged with violet**. By **sixty**, a man’s **Kidney *qi* wanes**, his hair thins with his teeth; by **seventy**, his form fully decays; by **ninety**, his **Kidney *qi* withers**, his **meridians empty**.

The **Kidney** is to the body as **roots to a tree**. Weighing **1.2 liang**, it governs the **north**, the **black**, and **opens at the two orifices**. Prolonged standing **injures bones and Kidneys**. Its **pulse emerges at the Spring Fountain (Yong Quan)**.

The **Kidney** is the **foundation of the sealed organs**, the **abode of essence**. Its **meridian ascends to the upper *zang***, **nourishes the middle *zang***, and **defends the lower *zang***. The **Kidney’s ailment** causes **groaning** or **yawns**; both stem from **Kidney evils**. Its **fluid manifests as saliva**; **Kidney pathology** increases spitting.

The **six bowels**—the **bladder**—are the **Kidney’s repository**, storing **essence and fluids**. The **ear**, its **sense organ**, hears **five tones** when **Kidney *qi* flows**; **Kidney disease** brings **deafness and bone atrophy**. The **Kidney merges with bones**, its **honor in the beard**; **bone atrophy** rendering one **unable to rise** signals **Kidney death**.

The **Kidney governs the north**, **winter**, **Ren-Yi days**, **the hours of *hai* and *zi***, **water**, the **羽 (yǔ) tone**, **black**, **salt**, and **rotten odors**. **Heart evils invading the Kidney** cause **aversion to decay**.

The **Kidney’s external correspondence** is **North Mountain**; it **communicates with the *Chén* star’s essence**. In **winter’s third month**, store **black *qi*** from the *Chén* star within the **Kidney**.

The **Kidney merges with bones**, governing **teeth above**. **Toothache** signals **Kidney injury**. It also governs the **ear**; **deafness** betrays **Kidney depletion**. **Bone pain** stems from **Kidney vacuity**; **multiple decayed teeth** from **Kidney weakness**; **loose teeth** from **Kidney Wind**; **ear pain** from **Kidney *qi* stagnation**; **frequent yawning** from **Kidney evils**; **rigid waist** from **Kidney deficiency**; **black complexion** from **Kidney decay**; **purplish luster** from **Kidney’s lack of suffering**. **Bone groaning** marks **Kidney exhaustion**. **Lung evils invading the Kidney** induce **excessive groaning**.

The **Kidney governs the *yǔ* (羽) tone**; thus, its **ailments require blowing**. **Blowing** harnesses the **Kidney’s *qi***—**clever and penetrating**—to **extract Kidney disease**. When **accumulated *qi* surges to the diaphragm**, **forceful blowing** dispels it. For **stagnant Kidney *qi***, **repeated blowing** gradually **unblocks it**.

**Cultivation Method** – In **winter’s third month**, face **north** and sit upright. **Groan the Golden Beam (Jin Liang) seven times**, **drink from the Jade Spring (Yu Quan) three times**, **inhale the black *qi* of the Mysterious Official (Xuan Guan)**, and **swallow it five times** to **supplement the loss from blowing**.

**Diagnosing Kidney Disease** – When the **Kidney is hot**, the **chin reddens**. **Kidney disease** presents as **blackened complexion and brittle teeth**, **distended abdomen and heaviness**, **wheezing and coughing**, **sweating and wind aversion**. When the **Kidney is vacuous**, the **lumbar region aches**. **Kidney Wind** manifests as **neck stiffness**, **excessive sweating**, **wind aversion**, **desire for downward food but esophageal blockage**, **preference for fullness**, **abdominal distension upon undressing**, and **diarrhea from cold foods**. **Diagnose by its form**: **black, emaciated, with a distended abdomen**.

The **Kidney abhors dryness**; in **urgency**, consume **pungent to moisten it**. It is also said: When the **Kidney is diseased**, to **firm**, eat **salty**; to **drain**, use **bitter**; to **supplement**, use **salty**. **Avoid hot foods and warm clothing**, for the **Kidney abhors dryness**.

When the **Kidney is diseased**, there is **moving *qi* below the navel**; pressing reveals **tightness**, accompanied by **painful fullness**, **indigestion**, **heaviness**, **joint pain**, and **desire for external stimuli**. **Kidney disease** causes **lumbar, hip, and bladder *lingqi* pain**, **leg pain or paralysis**, **dribbling urine**, **hernia**, and **testicular torsion**. **Ingest the Kidney *Qi* Pill**:
- **Dried Rehmannia (Shu Di Huang)** – 10 parts
- **Tuckahoe (Fu Ling)** – 10 parts
- **Moutan Bark (Mu Dan Pi)** – 7 parts
- **Alisma (Ze Xie)** – 8 parts
- **Chinese Wolfberry (Shan Zhu Yu)** – 9 parts
- **Poria (Fu Shen)** – 6 parts
- **Cinnamon Twig (Gui Zhi)** – 6 parts
- **Prepared Aconite (Fu Zi)** – 4 parts

---

**Preparation and Dosage:**
Pound and sift [the ingredients], form into honey-coated pills the size of *wutong* seeds (Paulownia seeds). Take thirty pills on an empty stomach with wine, twice daily.

**Six Qi Method (for Kidney):**
To treat the **Kidney**, use the **blowing method** for exhalation and inhalation. Gradually draw in *qi* through the nose, then exhale forcefully through the mouth.

For **Kidney disease**, perform **large blowing** thirty times and **fine blowing** ten times. This can eliminate all **Kidney *lingqi* afflictions**.

When there is **lumbar pain and knee *lingqi***, **heaviness in the waist and legs** preventing prolonged standing, **weakened yang channel**, **ear buzzing like insects**, and **mouth ulcers**, these are all **Kidney disorders**. All **heat-related distress** will be dispelled. Practice blowing frequently, sequentially without interruption. Cease only when the ailment improves; overuse will cause harm.

**Monthly Dietary Taboos:**
In the **tenth month**, avoid pepper—it causes dry mouth and **bloody or white dysentery**.
In the **eleventh and twelfth months**, avoid **scaly or armored foods**, as well as **Kidney- and Spleen-strengthening foods**.

For **Kidney disease**, consume **yellow soybeans and *chú* (a type of millet)**.
Avoid **sweet foods**.

**Kidney Organ-Guiding Method (to be practiced in the winter months):**
Sit upright, place both hands on the hips, and stretch the ribs three to five times. Alternatively, place hands on knees and twist the elbows left and right, three to five times each. Stretch the body three to five times, or alternately stamp the feet forward and backward, left and right, tens of times each. This dispels **wind pathogens accumulated in the Kidney, Bladder, and lumbar region**.

---

**Gallbladder (Bile Vessel) Diagram:**
The **Gallbladder** is treated with **xū (a sharp exhalation)**—**xū** for drainage, **absorption** for supplementation.

The **Gallbladder** is adjacent to the **Liver**, its color like **white silk tinged with green**, weighing **three *liang* and three *chǐn*** (≈13.5g).

The **Gallbladder** connects to the **Bladder**, governing **hair and nails**.
Thus, if a person’s hair is **withered**, their **Gallbladder is depleted**.
If their **nails are brittle**, their **Gallbladder is deficient**.
If their **hair is dry and brittle**, their **Gallbladder has wind**.
If a person **cravs bitter flavors**, their **Gallbladder is insufficient**.
If a person’s **complexion is greenish or ashen**, their **Gallbladder is healthy**.

**Cultivation Method:**
In the **winter months**, sit quietly and meditate, inhaling the **black *qi* of the Northern Celestial Palace (Xuangong)** through the nose, swallowing it three times to **supplement the deficiency of *xū*** and **nourish Gallbladder fluids**.

**Diagnosing Gallbladder Disorders:**
When the **Gallbladder is diseased**, there is **bitter breath, vomiting of old bile**, and **fearfulness in the heart**—these signs warrant supplementation.

If the **Gallbladder is full**, the **spirit becomes ungrounded**, manifesting as **restlessness and aimlessness**. If **empty**, it leads to **fear of cold**, **dizziness**, and **terror**.

When **deficient**, the **nails and hair wither**, **eyes protrude**, and **pain radiates from the Bladder to the lumbar and lower abdomen**.

Since the **Gallbladder shares a channel with the Liver**, its disorders are treated alongside **Liver ailments**.

**Gallbladder Organ-Guiding Method:**
Sit upright, press the soles together, lift the head, and grasp the ankles with both hands, shaking them three to five times. Alternatively, sit wide-legged, place hands on the ground, lift the torso, and arch the back three to five times. This dispels **wind toxins and pathogenic *qi* from the Gallbladder**.

**Gallbladder Breathwork (Using *Xū*):**
Gradually draw in *qi* through the nose, then exhale sharply through the mouth to **treat Gallbladder disorders** and **eliminate all *lingqi* afflictions of the Yin organs**.

For **night sweats, spontaneous sweating, pale complexion, distended small intestine, umbilical *lingqi* pain, dry mouth, and a stiff tongue**, practice **repeated *xū***—the ailment will then resolve.
