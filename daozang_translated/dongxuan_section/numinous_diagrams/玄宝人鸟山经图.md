The Most High said: Among the boundless heavens, each realm possesses a Human-Bird Mountain, where human forms and avian shapes converge. Its peaks and cliffs rise in towering majesty, beyond all description. Within its mystic terraces and jeweled palaces dwell the august deities. Forests and streams teem with birds and beasts; trees and stones bear fragrant blossoms. Mushrooms and myriad herbs flourish, yielding the elixir of deathlessness and the fluid of eternal life—yet to enumerate them would profit the seeker nothing. The scholar must delve deeply, for to grasp one is to know ten thousand, and all shall be clearly understood. Since instruction requires guidance, this text offers but a brief outline: the characters formed by numinous qi, inscribed by sacred craft, are transmitted to advanced disciples, never to be revealed to the mediocre.

The characters of numinous qi are the very visage of the mountain. Their outward signs are extraordinary; their traces, unique in form—all transformations wrought by that same numinous qi. Through profound insight, one may close the eyes and behold them. Having surveyed all in contemplation, one may then practice with certainty of verification. Once the numinous qi descends, the fleshly body may take flight. Through prolonged refinement, the gross flesh departs, and the numinous fills the being. Soaring like a bird, one roams beyond the Three Realms; as a perfected divine person, one enters the feasts of the Three Clarities. This is collectively called the Human-Bird.

The seeker ascends the mountain, and by the mountain attains the Dao, forever preserving eternal existence. Yet without utmost sincerity, one must not rashly seek this path.

The Most High said: The form and substance of the Human-Bird Mountain are the root of Heaven, Earth, and Humanity, the origin of primordial qi, and the instrument of wondrous transformation. Sages and perfected beings seek its domain; immortals and spirits revere its divinity. One must honor and serve it, meditate upon and invoke it, receive and perform rites for it, transcribe and wear it, practice it with precision, and harmonize it in secrecy. Without slackening over time, when the Three Qi are balanced and aligned, one’s body and offspring shall become seed-people of the Dao, moving freely in the world to propagate its teachings. Entering the mountains to refine methods, one shall act with autonomy, and no demon shall dare oppose. Thus may one command the Five Peaks at dawn, dispatch the Eight Seas, follow the Lords of the Three Heavens, and gird oneself with the essence of sun and moon. To know it is to be deathless; to practice it is to live forever. To contemplate it is to merge with wisdom; to master it is to unite with the divine.

At the mountain’s summit dwells the Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning; at its base reside the host of sacred perfected immortals. The mountain’s qi generates waters of five colors, called *Returning Soul*, whose flowing essence congeals into fat, known as *Thunder Sandalwood Incense*. When the Queen Mother of the West first sought the Dao, she journeyed to the Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning. After three thousand years, her virtue perfected, she was summoned to return to Kunlun Mountain. As she took leave of the Celestial Venerable, together they inscribed a record upon the void of the Human-Bird Mountain, crafting characters a *zhang* in size, suspended in the air to guide later seekers—still extant today.

The Nine Elder Immortal Lords of the Grotto-Heaven and the Nine Qi Venerable Ones depicted the mountain’s form and wore it upon their arms. The Heavenly Emperor transcribed the celestial script and affixed it to the body of the Human-Bird. Once every hundred years, it is revealed to transmit to the perfected. A Daoist who possesses this mountain’s form and the complete script shall attain transcendence and wander in feast upon Kunlun. One who recites this scripture ten thousand times and practices without betraying its words shall be met by the Heavenly Emperor’s envoys, arriving in cloud chariots with feathered canopies. No need for alchemical elixirs, no labor of guiding and stretching—persist in refinement without cease, and one shall ascend to Heaven of one’s own accord.

The Most High said: Whoever can purify and fast for three months, practicing in seclusion, shall be visited by immortals, who will personally impart these words. Receive them in secrecy and follow diligently, and swiftly shall you become a true sage. The Daoist who wears this shall command the myriad spirits.

In the first month, on the day of *jiazi*; in the second, on *renshen*; in the third, on *wuzi*—within a year, select but one day to perform the rite of offering to the mountain’s form upon a golden mirror. Transmit the oral instructions with care, and never recklessly disclose the scripture’s text. If the year lacks these three days, or if they are missed by chance, hasten to use *jiazi* instead, performing three offerings in a year. During the rite, maintain purity, strict discipline, and abstinence.

On a night of bright moonlight, expose the altar in the central courtyard. No need for elaborate altars or adornments, and let no others know. Secretly sweep clean and lay out a pure mat. Face south to arrange a separate seat, then face north to perform the rites. First, place a nine-inch mirror at the center of the seat, covering it with a purple-veined canopy. Encase the mountain chart in a purple brocade pouch and set it properly upon the mirror. Place three bowls of clear wine before the chart, with fragrant meats, dates, and fruits arranged in a circle around the mirror.

Pour half a bowl of wine to rinse the mouth, then take incense and assume position. Close the eyes, click the teeth three times, and visualize as usual. Sound the drum and kindle the incense burner, following the standard method. Take incense three more times, and with eyes closed, behold the Most High Great Dao, the Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions, the Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning, the Qi-Generated Spirits of the Human-Bird Mountain, and the Heavenly Emperor—cloud chariots arrayed, filling the void, all turning toward the seat. After a long while, their forms become distinct.

Then secretly recite their names and titles, along with your own name, and invoke: *"I humbly offer fragrant incense and present utmost sincerity, beseeching the descent of the Most High Great Dao, the Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions, the Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning, the Qi-Generated Spirits of the Human-Bird Mountain, the Heavenly Emperor, and all divine officials, on this auspicious hour and propitious moment."* Bow and prostrate yourself, performing three bows. Lie prone with eyes closed, visualizing the deities descending to the seat. After a long while, rise.

Take wine three more times, kneel, and recite your name and title, addressing the Most High Great Dao, the Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions, the Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning, the Qi-Generated Spirits of the Human-Bird Mountain, the Heavenly Emperor, and all divine beings: *"By your grace, I have been deemed worthy to behold and attend upon the august deities today. Joy and awe intermingle. I pray for your great compassion, that what is begun may be fulfilled, enabling me to study the Dao and attain the Dao, seek transcendence and attain transcendence, gain spiritual freedom, and forever preserve eternal existence."*

This humble and unworthy servant dares not speak at length, overwhelmed as I am with joy and trepidation. Respectfully bowing and prostrating myself, I perform three bows. Upon completion, I take wine three times, and having done so, I make another address as before. Three times I take wine, three times I address. When finished, I offer incense three times, rise, and stand to send off the deities. Stating my name and title, I address the Most High Great Dao, the Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions, the Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning, the Qi-Generated Spirits of the Human-Bird Mountain, the Heavenly Emperor, and all divine officials: *"By your grace, I humbly request that you turn your cloud-borne chariots and return to ascend the Three Clarities. Though I am filled with longing and reverence, I pray for your great compassion to bestow your vast blessings. May I attain the Dao and behold the Celestial Palace. Should I make further entreaties, I humbly beseech your return."*

I, your servant, bow and prostrate myself, performing three bows. Upon rising, I restore the incense burner. Once the incense is restored, I hold a bowl of wine and pour it to immerse the four directions. When finished, I gather the offerings in order. Those of like mind shall return to their chambers to partake of the sacrificial meat; it must not be recklessly shared with those who do not follow the Dao. Husbands and wives attending together shall observe the same rites; those who do not shall not engage in union. This prohibition is most solemn—all must take heed.

After a thousand days of pure fasting, inscribe the mountain’s form on thin paper, three to five *cun* in size, and swallow it with the waters of the Jade Pool. One dose grants eternal life; two doses allow flight as a transcendent; three doses elevate one to a revered rank, merging with the Dao. After purifying oneself and creating the talisman, wear it for two years, reciting the scripture morning and evening. On auspicious days, perform the rites, maintaining vigilance to the end as at the beginning. When the thousand-day period is complete, you may wander mountains and marshes, commanding the Five Peaks, the Three Rivers, the Four Seas, the Eight Abysses, and the Nine Lands. All spirits shall bow in reverence, and your merit shall spread far. Within five to seven years, no more than nine, you shall ascend beyond the Three Clarities.

*The True Form Chart of the Human-Bird Mountain*
The Most High Jade Dawn Lord of the Great Dao states: The Human-Bird Mountain has many names—sometimes called Mount Sumeru, sometimes the Dark Garden Mountain, sometimes the Great Earth Metal-Root Mountain, sometimes the Primordial Wondrous Mystery Mountain, sometimes the Mountain of the Treasure Cavern of Primordial Qi, sometimes the Mountain of the Seven Transformations and Seven Turnings for Observing Heaven. Though it bears seven names, its essence is called the *Xuanlan* (Mystic Contemplation). Free from flaws and impurities, vast and clear, its height is boundless, its majesty equal to the Dao. Though its manifestations have limits, its peaks soar into the mysterious void, its foundations extending three hundred sixty billion myriad *li*. Its surface has two million four hundred thousand gates, and within and without stand palaces of the seven treasures, where divine transcendents wander and perfected beings dwell.

The Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning governs atop the mountain, above which lie the Heavenly Emperor’s Palace and the Supreme Emperor’s Chamber. The Perfected of the Highest Clarity gaze upon one another in endless succession. Within the mountain naturally exists the Golden Elixir of Return, also called the Seven-Named Sacred Incense. This incense does not burn but perpetually emits wondrous fragrance, perceptible against the wind even seven thousand *li* away. The incense of the immortals—whoever obtains it shall not die. There grow sacred trees of *chun* wood, golden and jade trees, their radiance outshining the sun, their essence piercing the void. When they sway, they emit sounds that form the eight tones. Golden-winged phoenixes, roc birds, vermilion sparrows, divine dragons, qilin, lions with bronze heads and iron brows, apotropaic beasts with chisel teeth—great spiritual birds and beasts roam its sacred groves, while giant fish and scaled creatures glide beneath its Jade Pools. Marvels and auspicious omens defy full description; these few words merely outline its grandeur.

Within the mountain naturally exist eleven characters, their secrets held in the mouth. The text is transmitted through esoteric instruction: the *Gonglong* spirit is invoked to dispel misfortune, and the mountain repels inauspicious forces, rendering the outer world void. The characters number one hundred twenty-four when facing left, one hundred twenty when facing right, totaling two hundred forty-four. They are recited in the heart, their secrets passed by the master’s lips.
