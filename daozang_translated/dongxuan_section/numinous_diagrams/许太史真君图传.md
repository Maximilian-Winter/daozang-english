**Fascicle One of *The Illustrated Hagiography of the Perfected Lord Xu the Grand Historian***

On the first day of the eighth month in the second year of Ningkang of Emperor Xiaowu of the Jin, the year *jiaxu*, clouds and banners descended from heaven. Two immortals, riding a chariot with a grand procession, alighted in the courtyard of the Perfected Lord. The Perfected Lord descended the steps to receive them with bows.

The two immortals declared: "By the command of the Jade Emperor, we bestow upon you this edict."
The Perfected Lord prostrated himself to listen.

The edict proclaimed:
*"The Supreme Edict is addressed to the youthful immortal Xu Xun: In countless kalpas past, you have cultivated the utmost Dao with tireless diligence, mastering its profound intricacies. Of the ten thousand methods and thousand gates, none have you not traversed as a disciple. You have rescued the afflicted, delivered the distressed, eradicated harm, and dispelled demons. Your merit has succored the living, and your name is exalted in the Jade Register. The host of immortals reveres and recommends you; thus, you are deemed worthy of promotion. You are hereby appointed Grand Historian of the Immortal Realm of the Nine Provinces and Eminent Envoy of Lofty Brilliance. We bestow upon you a purple robe of feathered splendor, a banner of jade and treasures, a casket of jade unguent, and a measure of golden elixir. Upon receipt of this edict, you shall comply and act accordingly."*
The Perfected Lord bowed twice more and ascended the steps to receive the edict.

One immortal said: "I am Cui Ziwen, the Jade Perfected Duke Above."
The other said: "I am Xiaqiu Zhong, the Great Minister of Primordial Perfection."
Having spoken, they bowed to the Perfected Lord and sat to inform him of the day of his ascension. Then they departed in a cloud chariot.

**The Second Edict from the Jade Steps**
On the fifteenth day of the eighth month in the second year of Ningkang of Emperor Xiaowu of the Jin, the year *jiaxu*, at noon, the people of the world heard from afar the sound of celestial music. Auspicious clouds filled the sky, swiftly gathering in the courtyard of the Perfected Lord. A canopy of feathers and a dragon chariot arrived, accompanied by an escort of immortal officials and guards. Immortal youths and maidens led the procession before and behind. Crimson clouds and purple qi unfurled and encircled the scene. The two edict-bearers returned once more. The Perfected Lord descended the steps to receive them with bows.

The two immortals again proclaimed the edict:
*"The Supreme Edict is addressed to the youthful immortal Xu Xun: We absolve you of the sins of your past life—greed, killing, concealment, and neglect of ancestral rites. We record your present-life merits: measuring waters, wielding talismans, healing the sick, punishing evil, and subduing venomous creatures. The Controller of Destiny of Mount Qian has been commanded to transmit the golden elixir to the mortal realm. Seal your debts, enclose your form, and return your person, household, kitchen, dwelling, and all possessions to the Three Heavens. Purify the impure swiftly, turn from earth, and ascend through the void. The Mighty Celestial Guardians of the Left and the Great Generals of Flowing Metal and Fire Bells on the Right shall illuminate and defend the Central Yellow. Let there be no negligence. Upon receipt of this edict, you shall comply and act accordingly. Furthermore, your distant ancestor You is posthumously appointed Minister of the Jade Void. Your great-grandfather Min is appointed Great Guardian of the Celestial Soldiers of the Grand Tenuity. Your grandfather Yu is appointed Keeper of the Records of Merit in the Supreme Ultimate. Your father Su is appointed Immortal Official of the Central Marchmount. Your dwelling shall henceforth be named the Left Office of the Immortal Court."*

Decree from the Divine Envoy: "Among your disciples, only six are fit to ascend with the Dragon Chariot at the same time." With these words, they too ascended into heaven and departed.

**Sacred Edict of the Perfected Lord**

We bow to the Primordial Ancestor of the Undifferentiated, from whose singular qi the true ones were divided. In kalpas long past, you accumulated cultivation of the utmost Dao, enduring hardships with meticulous devotion, your understanding of the warp and weft of the Way growing ever profound. Of the ten thousand methods and thousand gates, none did you fail to master as a teacher. You rescued from disaster and delivered from peril, eradicated harm and quelled demons. Your merit aided living beings, and your name stood high in the Jade Registers. The host of perfected ones deferred to you, and thus your elevation was fitting.

Great in compassion, great in vows, great in filial piety, great in benevolence—you are the Celestial Historian of the Nine Provinces, the Illustrious Great Envoy, the Thunderbolt Minister of the Supreme Bureau of Heaven’s Pivot, the Chief Exorcist of Demons. Your Dao is profoundly responsive, your divine efficacy wondrously efficacious. You hold office as the Controller of the Nine Heavens, the Perfected Lord of the Supreme Ultimate who decrees life and records destiny. Inspector-General of the Three Heavens, Chief Examiner, Grand Remonstrator, Celestial Physician Emperor, Patriarch of Salvation, Most Pure and Illuminating Heavenly Worthy. Celestial Historian of the Nine Provinces, Illustrious Great Envoy, Perfected Lord of Profound Response and Wondrous Efficacy.

Your surname is Xu, given name Xun, courtesy name Jingzhi. Your great-grandfather was Yan, your grandfather Yu, and your father Su, all of whom were natives of Xuchang. Of lofty integrity, you never served in office, for you are a descendant of the Yingyang You clan. During the late Han, your father relocated to Nanchang in Yuzhang to avoid turmoil, and there your family settled.

Initially, your mother, the Lady, dreamed of a golden phoenix holding a pearl in its beak, which fell into her palm. She played with it and swallowed it, and upon waking, felt movement in her womb. Thus she conceived, and the Perfected Lord was born—on the twenty-eighth day of the first month, in the second year of the Red Crow reign of Sun Quan.

From birth, the Perfected Lord was keenly intelligent, and from childhood, he was perceptive and unassuming. Once, while hunting, he shot a doe, and its fawn fell from her. The mother doe still turned to lick it, but before she could finish, she died. Moved by this, he was suddenly enlightened, cast aside his bow and arrows, and devoted himself to the study of the Dao.

The Perfected Lord applied himself diligently to learning, mastering the classics and histories, as well as astronomy, geography, music, the five phases, and the books of the warp and weft. He was especially fond of the arts of divine transcendence and self-cultivation. He sought out and studied under various masters, exhaustively investigating the profound and subtle.

The Perfected Lord heard that Wu Shiyun of Xi’an had obtained the divine prescriptions of the perfected one Ding Yi, that Bao Jing of Nanhai possessed secret methods, and that the Heaven-Sent White Cloud Talisman had descended. He thus went to study under them. Shiyun, moved by a mysterious resonance as if by a predestined affinity, entrusted him with all the essential secrets. The present-day *Wish-Fulfilling Great Elixir* handed down to the world is one of Ding Yi’s divine prescriptions.

Xi’an is now Ningzhou. Shiyun served the state of Wu as the magistrate of Xi’an and settled there. Sixty *li* from the prefectural seat stands the Xiping Jingwu Immortal Abbey, which was his former residence.

The Perfected Lord and Guo Pu sought out famous mountains as places to dwell in truth. They found the Jin family estate on Xiaoyao Mountain and deemed it perfectly suited for transcendence. Together, they paid their respects to Lord Jin. Guo Pu said, "Master Xu wishes to establish a dwelling here as a place for cultivation. Thus we come to pay our respects."

Lord Jin replied, "If Master Xu is truly sincere, I shall provide both the estate and its lands to support his sustenance."

The Perfected Lord said, "Though I am deeply honored by your kindness, to accept would be without proper cause. I would rather hear what you require, and the amount shall be as you command."

Lord Jin said, "When a true man’s word aligns with the Dao, he would pledge even his life—how much more so mere external things?" He then took a large coin, split it in half, and each kept one piece as a contract.

The Perfected Lord resided in the Jin family estate, devoting himself daily to cultivation and seeking neither fame nor advancement. The villagers were transformed by his filial piety and fraternity, and his associates admired his virtue and righteousness. If anyone offered him gifts, he would not accept even the smallest thing unless it was proper.

One evening, a merchant brought an iron lampstand for sale. When he lit the lamp that night, he noticed that where the lacquer had peeled away, the exposed metal was in fact gold. The next day, he sought out the original owner and returned it.

As the Perfected Lord’s reputation for Daoist attainment grew ever more renowned, the commandery nominated him as Filial and Incorrupt—but he declined. The imperial court repeatedly extended honors and appointments, and though he could not refuse entirely, he only accepted the post of Magistrate of Jingyang in Shu Commandery in the first year of the Taikang reign of the Jin, at the age of forty-two.

Upon assuming office, he first admonished the clerks and runners to abandon greed and vulgarity, to eliminate vexatious regulations, and to release prisoners from their fetters, instructing them all in the Way. The officials and people were delighted and submitted willingly, all wishing to reform themselves. In teaching the people, he placed loyalty, filial piety, kindness, benevolence, forbearance, prudence, diligence, and reverence above all else. He appointed scholars and men of virtue and esteem to lead by example, so that contentiousness gradually faded until lawsuits ceased entirely. At that time, two clerks, Hu and Zhan, assisted him in managing documents and adjudicating governance. To this day, they are venerated as deities in the temple.

Before the Perfected Lord took office, a year of famine had left the people unable to pay their taxes. The commandery and county enforced the law strictly, driving many to flee their homes. When he arrived to assume his duties, he used an elixir to transmute tiles and pebbles into gold, which he secretly buried in the garden behind the county office. One day, he summoned all those who had not yet paid their taxes to the courtyard and ordered the clerks to demand payment. He then had the people perform labor in the rear garden. As they dug, they uncovered the gold and used it to pay their taxes, thus sparing them the fear of flight. Refugees from neighboring regions, drawn by his virtue and benevolence, flocked to settle there in great numbers. Soon, the county’s households multiplied, and its people prospered.

That year, a great plague ravaged the commandery, killing seven or eight out of every ten people. The Perfected Lord employed the divine remedies he had obtained to heal them. All who received his talismans and incantations recovered instantly, and even those suffering from chronic or severe illnesses were cured without exception. After the plague-stricken people of the commandery were saved, word of his methods spread to other regions, and the sick came in droves, numbering in the thousands each day. He marked a bamboo outside the city walls, ten *li* along the river, and placed a talisman within it, so that those who drank from the water beneath the bamboo were healed. For the elderly, infirm, or gravely ill who could not come themselves, drawing and drinking the water also brought recovery. Thus, the people of Shu composed a song:

*No theft or robbery,*
*No officials’ deceit.*
*Our lord revives the people,*
*Sickness flees his might.*

After serving as Magistrate of Jingyang for many years, the Perfected Lord foresaw the coming chaos of the Jin dynasty and resigned his post to return east. The people of Shu, moved by his transformative virtue, could not bear to see him go. They erected living shrines in his honor wherever he had been, displayed his portrait in their homes, and revered him as a divine being. On the day of his departure, those who followed him, carrying provisions, filled the fields. Some accompanied him for a thousand *li* before turning back, while others followed him to his home, offering to serve him for life without returning. He allowed them to settle on vacant land east of his residence, where they built thatched huts in formation like a military camp. They all changed their surnames to match his, and to this day, the place is called Xu Family Camp—a testament to the depth of his enduring love for the people.

Once, the Perfected Lord traveled to Xinwu and rested in a cypress grove. Suddenly, five maidens appeared, each bearing a precious sword, which they presented to him. He accepted them with curiosity, and afterward, they accompanied him to his residence. There, they amused themselves daily by sparring with the swords, their skill unfathomable to others. The Perfected Lord recognized them as sword immortals and treated them with great courtesy. In time, he mastered the divine use of the swords. After his ascension, the five maidens concealed themselves beneath the cypress trees he had planted, and they came to be known as the Cypress Tree Immortals. The Cypress Grove Abbey still stands in Xinwu today.

The Perfected Lord and Perfected Lord Wu traveled to Songyang, where they heard of a female master in Danyang County of Jinling named Mistress Chen, who possessed many Daoist arts. Together, they went to study under her. The mistress said, “Long ago, the Filial and Fraternal King descended from the Upper Clarity to the home of Lan Gong in Qufu County, Yanzhou, leaving behind the Golden Elixir and Precious Scriptures, along with bronze talismans and iron charters. He instructed Lan Gong, saying, ‘In a later age of the Jin, a divine immortal named Xu Sun will appear. Transmit this Way to him.’ He commanded Lan Gong to pass it to me so that I might safeguard it until your arrival. Many years have passed, and now the time has come to bestow it upon you.” She then ascended the altar, performed the rites of covenant, and transmitted the teachings, including the Orthodox Unity methods for slaying demons, the arts of the Three and Five, and the techniques of flying steps. She imparted all of these to them.

After the two Perfected Lords received Mistress Chen’s teachings and paid their respects, they took their leave. The Perfected Lord resolved to visit her every year, but she perceived his intention and said, “Do not come again, for I shall soon return to the Emperor’s realm.” She then took—

She took a single blade of fragrant grass, cast it southward, and said, “Go home. Where this blade falls, establish my shrine, and come once each autumn—this will suffice.” The two Perfected Lords returned and first sought the place where the flying blade had landed. Forty *li* south of their dwelling, they found it—already grown into a thicket. There they built a shrine, naming it the Yellow Hall. Today it is called the Hall of Flourishing Dao, the Huangtang Longdao Abbey. Each year on the third day of mid-autumn, they would journey there to pay their respects.

The Perfected Lord, returning from Songyang, retraced the path of Mistress Chen’s flying blade. Passing by the roadside, he chanced upon a clear pond and rested there for a while. Today, the village of Qingpo preserves the site as the Restful Perfected Retreat. He also saw villagers preparing lavish feasts of slaughtered animals to sacrifice to the gods, remarking to one another, “If our offerings are meager, the gods will grow angry and bring disaster.” The Perfected Lord said, “How dare such malevolent spirits presume this?” That night, he lodged at an inn and summoned fierce winds and swift thunder to strike them, uprooting the grove of trees. The next day, he told the villagers, “The demonic shrine has been destroyed—no more sacrifices are needed.” Today, the site lies in ruins, and the villagers no longer make offerings.

As the Perfected Lord continued his search for the place where the blade had fallen, he passed through lands where villagers filled the roads, carrying buckets to fetch water from distant sources. Seeing the toil of the old and young, he struck the dry marsh before the shrine with his staff, and a spring gushed forth to aid them, never failing even in drought. Today, the village of Daze preserves this as the Purple Yang Retreat’s stone well.

Once, the Perfected Lord ascended the summit of Dragon City Mountain. Pointing to a fissure in the mountainside spring, he said, “Something strange must lie hidden within—later, it will become a demonic scourge to harm the people.” He then planted his sword, performed the rites, and established an altar to suppress it. Each year when the immortals’ chariots come to pay homage to Mistress Chen, they rest here, and the site is now called Dragon City Abbey.

The Perfected Lord crossed the Xiao Shu River—today’s Huanghu Port. Arriving at a riverside inn, he was received by its owner, a man named Zhu, who, though poor, welcomed him with utmost courtesy. In jest, the Perfected Lord drew a pine tree on the wall before departing. From that day on, the family’s business prospered, its profits doubling.

Later, when the river swelled and breached its dike, the market stalls and houses were all swept away—only the wall bearing the pine remained unharmed. Today, the place is called Pine Lake Market, and a shrine to the Zhu family still receives offerings there.

The Perfected Lord once refined divine elixirs on Yellow Dragon Mountain in Aicheng. In the mountain’s deep pool, a flood dragon and its minions gathered, plotting to unleash a deluge to wash away his elixir chamber. The Perfected Lord dispatched spirit soldiers to capture it and pinned it to a stone cliff. The nail-studded rock where the dragon was bound remains to this day.

After completing the divine elixir, the Perfected Lord offered it in sacrifice at the stone chamber of Immortal Ge on Mofu Mountain. Arriving at Xiuchuan, he admired the swift current and the firmness of its waters, then drew his sacred sword to whet it upon a stone by the stream. The site is now called Plum Mountain Jingyang Abbey.

Crossing the water, the Perfected Lord ascended秀峰 to establish an altar. At its summit, he performed the jiao rites to give thanks to the Celestial Emperor, then consumed the immortal elixir. The mountain is now called Jingyang Shan. To the south of the stream stands Wu Immortal Abbey, the former residence of Perfected Lord Wu.

When the Perfected Lord visited Perfected Lord Wu’s dwelling, he passed through Xi’an County—today’s Ningzhou. The local earth god came forth to greet him and was asked if any demonic forces were harming the people, but the deity concealed the truth and said nothing. As the Perfected Lord walked past a small shrine, five spirit figures emerged to welcome him, saying: “This land has long been plagued by a flood dragon’s poison, and knowing of your arrival, it fled to Ezhu to hide. It will return later—we beseech you to rid the people of this scourge.” The shrine deities were five brothers of the Mao clan. Today, the temple is called Xieyou Shrine, located four hundred paces east of the prefectural seat.

Following the shrine gods’ words, the Perfected Lord tracked the dragon’s trail to Ezhu. Along the way, he encountered three elders who, when asked about the dragon’s lair, pointed and said: “It now hides beneath the bridge ahead.” The Perfected Lord reached the bridge, brandished his sword, and rebuked it. Startled, the dragon fled into the great river and concealed itself in the abyss. He then commanded his spirit soldiers to drive it out, and the dragon burst forth from the upper reaches—whereupon he slew it. The three elders were the Three Kings of Universal Response, who receive offerings at their temple there. The bridge is now called Fuyong Bridge, its upper and lower ends shaped like dragon mouths.

Enraged that the Xi’an earth god had concealed the dragon and failed in his duty, the Perfected Lord sealed the gates of its temple, halting its sacrifices, and ordered the people to worship instead at the small shrine of the Mao clan. Today, the main gate of Ningzhou’s City God Temple remains perpetually closed, and its opening foretells disaster for the county. The Xieyou Shrine, however, thrives with offerings.

Upon returning to the prefectural city, the Perfected Lord remarked: “This place is a vital hub of water and land routes, teeming with people—surely there must be those destined for immortality among them.” To test this, he mixed several grains of his divine elixir with other medicines and sold them, allowing buyers to take them on faith. Yet not a single person recognized the elixir, and the Perfected Lord sighed at the rarity of true immortal talent.

Hearing that a flood dragon was wreaking havoc in Xinwu, the Perfected Lord took up his sacred sword to hunt it down. Passing through what is now the site of Xianyou Abbey, the dragon, in terror, fled into a mountain stream—today’s Cangxi. The Perfected Lord inscribed talismans on a massive boulder and composed a text to suppress the dragon, which remains to this day in the courtyard of Yanzhen Abbey, ten li west of Fengxin County.

In the upper reaches of Haihun, a colossal serpent dwelled in a mountain cave, exhaling clouds of qi that stretched forty li, devouring people and livestock, and bringing great harm to the people.

Hearing of this, the Perfected Lord ascended the northern ridge—today’s Meeting Immortals Peak—to verify the report. Indeed, he saw the poisonous qi blanketing the sky. Gathering his disciples, he prepared to slay the serpent. As they first entered its territory, villagers from near and far, numbering in the hundreds, came forward to plead their case. The Perfected Lord, moved, declared: “The cycles of the world turn, and this is an age of calamity. What wrong have these people committed to suffer such disaster? I have come precisely for this purpose. I swear I shall not share this earth with this serpent—I will eradicate it for you.”

Once his disciples had assembled, they too urged him to slay the beast. The Perfected Lord replied, “The time must be ripe.” He planted his sword in the earth and silently prayed to heaven. After a long while, a spring gushed forth, and soon a red crow flew past. The Perfected Lord said, “The hour is at hand.” The site was later named Hour-Waiting Abbey, then renamed Red Crow Longevity Sage Abbey, and is today known as Broad Blessing Abbey.

Arriving at the serpent’s lair, the villagers gathered, beating drums and shouting as they pressed forward to witness. The Perfected Lord planted his sword, deployed his qi, and sent forth flying talismans, summoning the local deities of Haihun and Nanchang to join forces in driving the serpent from its den. Where the talismans fell, an abbey was built, named Talisman Fall. This is today’s Great Harmony Abbey, south of Nanchang Prefecture.

The serpent emerged from its cave, rearing its head over ten yards high and spewing venom skyward. The Perfected Lord whistled, commanding wind and thunder, and summoned his divine soldiers. He ordered Wu Jun to stride forward and cleave its head with his sword, while Shi Cen, Gan Zhan, and others hacked open its belly. A smaller serpent, several yards long, slithered out from within. Gan Jun moved to strike it, but the Perfected Lord said, “It has done no harm—do not slay it without cause.” The young serpent fled seven li, but upon hearing the drums and clamor, it turned to glance back at its mother. The disciples urged pursuit, but the Perfected Lord said, “If this serpent brings harm to the people five hundred years hence, I shall return to slay it. You may know it by the pine and parasol trees before my altar sweeping the ground as a sign.”

He continued, “One thousand two hundred and forty years after my departure as an immortal, within the borders of Yuzhang and the Five Mounds, eight hundred earthbound immortals shall emerge. Their master will arise in Yuzhang, greatly propagating my teachings. When the sandbar in the heart of the prefectural river grows to cover the mouth of the Sand Well, if this young serpent becomes a menace, those eight hundred shall slay it. If it brings no harm, it must not be killed.” The serpent’s offspring thus escaped into the inlet. Today, in Jianchang, there remains Serpent’s Offspring Inlet and Seven Li Listen, while in Xinjian stands Wu City Temple.

After slaying the colossal python, the Perfected Lord’s sword was stained with its foul blood. He ground and washed it, then tested its edge on whetstone. To this day, in Jianchang Prefecture, Cold Water Terrace, Sword-Grinding Pool, and Testing Sword Stone remain.

The Perfected Lord addressed his disciples: “Though the great serpent is destroyed, the flood dragon’s essence yet lingers. That creature is cunning—it must know of my intent to eradicate harm. I fear it may seize an opportunity to breach the prefectural city. Let us return to the prefecture.” Gan Zhan and Shi Cen’s two sons followed him. This occurred in the sixth year of Yongjia.

The Perfected Lord’s Daoist arts were sublime, his renown spreading far and wide. Those seeking to become his disciples numbered in the thousands, and though he declined them, they would not depart. Thus, he transformed charcoal into a beautiful woman and scattered her among the disciples’ quarters by night to test them. At dawn, he examined them—only ten remained unstained by her allure. These were the very disciples who would later attend him in ascent, the foremost among his followers. Thereafter, whenever he journeyed across rivers and lakes to slay flood dragons and serpents, none but these ten accompanied him. The rest, shamed, departed of their own accord. To this day, west of Jianchang Prefecture, the ford is called Charcoal Woman’s Market, and the shrine erected there is named Wondrous Luminance—this is the very site.

*End of Scroll One of The Illustrated Transmission of the Perfected Lord Xu, Grand Scribe*

---

The Perfected Lord returned to the prefecture with Lords Gan and Shi, surveying the city and its precincts. There, a youth of refined bearing and splendid attire approached, presenting himself as surnamed Shen. His manners were earnest, his responses quick and apt, yet he soon took his leave. The Perfected Lord turned to his disciples and said: “That was no man—it was the essence of an ancient flood dragon, come to test me. Though his form was human, a rank wind clung to him. I feigned ignorance to draw out his foul kin.”

Knowing the youth to be the flood dragon’s essence, the Perfected Lord traced his path to the clear river, where it had transformed into a yellow ox, lying upon the sandy shore. This is the present-day Yellow Ox Shoal. He then cut paper and shaped it into a black ox, sending it to engage the creature. Meanwhile, he ordered Shi Cen to conceal himself with a sword and, when the battle grew fierce, strike. The blade found its mark on the left thigh. The ox bolted into a well south of the city—now located at the southeast corner of Upper Blue Temple—and the well has since been called the Flood Dragon’s Well. The Perfected Lord dispatched a talismanic officer to pursue the essence to Changsha, where it entered the well of Jia Yi and emerged in human form, lodging in the household of Jia Yu. Earlier, Jia Yu’s wife had taken a concubine, who bore two sons over several years. Each spring and summer, she would depart by boat, returning in autumn with a heavily laden vessel.

At that moment, the concubine suddenly returned, deceiving Jia Yu by claiming she had been robbed and wounded in the thigh. Jia Yu summoned a physician, and the Perfected Lord disguised himself as a healer to visit him. When summoned, the concubine refused to emerge, so the Perfected Lord ascended the hall and rebuked her, saying: "The creatures of the rivers and lakes are not few, but I have traced your tracks here—how dare you flee? Appear at once!" She then revealed her true form, and he struck her down with his blade. He spat upon her two sons, transforming them into young flood dragons, while the concubine nearly completed her shift into a serpentine form. Only after her parents pleaded for mercy was she spared.

The Perfected Lord then addressed Jia Yu: "The flood dragon’s dwelling lies beneath your home, its depth no more than a few feet—yet it could unleash vast waves. You must relocate swiftly, lest you drown in your own ruin." Jia Yu, terrified, moved his entire household to higher ground. Before long, the site collapsed into an abyss, its depths unfathomable. This is the present-day Zhaotan in Changsha.

The Perfected Lord then returned to Yuzhang, where the flood dragon’s remaining allies thrived. Fearing his retribution, they grew restless and, transforming into humans, scattered through the city. There, they sought out the Perfected Lord’s disciples under false pretenses, saying: "I hail from Chang’an, where my family has long upheld virtue. I have heard of your master, Lord Xu, and his divine sword—might I learn of its power?" The disciple replied: "Our master’s sword can split the heavens with a point, cleave the earth with a gesture. It disrupts the stars’ courses and reverses the rivers’ flow. No evil can withstand it—it is a treasure of the gods." The visitor then asked: "Is there nothing it cannot harm?" The disciple answered: "Only winter melons and gourds remain unscathed."

Taking this as truth, the flood dragons transformed their entire kin into winter melons and gourds, their vines sprawling and intertwining as they floated upon the river, drifting toward the border. At dawn, the Perfected Lord sensed the surge of malevolent qi. Gazing upon the river, he saw the flood dragons’ disguises and handed his sword to Shi Cen, commanding him to tread the waters and strike. Their ranks were annihilated without exception, the river’s current stained by their demise.

The Perfected Lord then addressed his disciples and the elders of the city: "This land is Fuzhou, a den of flood dragons. Without a means to suppress them, they will resurface to wreak havoc, and none will be able to restrain them." He thus commanded spirits and gods to labor at the well south of the yamen, forging an iron pillar as a permanent measure to subdue the land. Once the pillar was cast, he allowed it to rise several feet above the well, its base secured with eight chains to anchor the earth’s veins.

The Perfected Lord invoked: "If this iron pillar tilts, should the demons rise again, I shall return. If it stands true, their evil shall be eradicated forever." From then on, the water demons vanished, and the city knew peace. Yet fearing that future tyrants might stir trouble, he inscribed upon the pillar:

*"Where the land is strong, the people’s hearts respond with goodness—no treachery shall arise.
Even if schemers emerge, their ambitions shall never reach fruition."*

Such was the depth of his foresight for posterity.

The Perfected Lord, concerned that some of the flood dragons and water spirits had scattered into the regions of Poyang and Xunyang, feared their return. He traversed the rivers and lakes, eradicating them with divine treasures. Upon reaching the summit of Mount Tiaoshao, he found three dragon lakes, their caverns piercing through to the great river and connecting to Rao and Xin. There he slew the dragon demons, establishing the Jade Yang Prefecture to civilize and pacify the land, and the Great City Prefecture to secure its tranquility. He cast an iron talisman to seal the mouth of Poyang Lake, blocking their path of entry. Today, it remains above Lakekou County, where a bell-shaped stone stands in the river. He also forged an iron cover to shroud the Dark Abyss of Luling, suppressing their lair, and pressed it with an iron talisman, anchoring it with a sacred sword. Now, the Flying Talisman Ridge and the Chongzhen Temple stand in its place.

General Wang Dun raised an army to march inward and encamped by the lake. The Perfected Lord, along with Master Wu and Guo Pu, went to pay him a visit. During the feast, Wang Dun said, "I dreamed of a tree splitting the sky—what does this portend?" The Perfected Lord replied, "It is no auspicious omen." Master Wu added, "A tree splitting the sky above forms the character *wei* (未, 'not yet')." Guo Pu divined and declared, "It shall not succeed." Wang Dun asked, "How long is my lifespan?" Guo Pu answered, "If you advance, calamity will come swiftly. If you return to Wuchang, your years may yet be immeasurable." Enraged, Wang Dun demanded, "How long is *your* lifespan?" Guo Pu replied, "It ends at noon today." Wang Dun immediately ordered his guards to seize Guo Pu and behead him. The Perfected Lord cast his cup, which transformed into a wagtail circling the beams. When Wang Dun looked up, the two masters had vanished.

The Perfected Lord and Master Wu traveled to Jinling, intending to hire a boat to return to Yuzhang. The boatman, however, claimed no one was available to steer. The Perfected Lord said, "Simply close your eyes and sit calmly—do not peek. I shall steer for you." The boatmen agreed. The Perfected Lord summoned two dragons to bear the vessel forward. Passing through Chiyang, he pressed his seal into the western cliff of the riverbank, parting the water spirits to clear their path. The imprint remains to this day. Permitting Master Wu to join him, they rode a dragon boat soaring through the air. Soon they passed the summit of Mount Lu, arriving at Purple Cloud Peak and the Golden Palace Grotto. Wishing to explore the cave, the Perfected Lord lowered the boat slightly, grazing the treetops with a grating sound. The boatmen could not resist and stole a glance. The dragons immediately abandoned the vessel upon a towering peak, snapping the mast into a deep ravine below. The Perfected Lord addressed the boatmen: "You disobeyed my words—where shall you now return?" The boatmen knelt and begged for deliverance. The Perfected Lord taught them the art of consuming sacred herbs to attain immortality, and they spent their days in seclusion upon the mountain. Today, Iron Boat Peak stands there, its mast turned to stone, fallen in the ravine.

Returning to his former retreat, the Perfected Lord spent decades without concern for worldly affairs. Daily, he discoursed on the profound mysteries of the Dao with his disciples, refining his cultivation of the supreme Way. He composed the *"Drunken Thoughts of an Immortal"* song and wrote the *"Eight Treasures Teachings"*, which declared:

*"Loyalty and filial piety, integrity and caution,
Generosity, tolerance, and forbearance.
Loyalty precludes deceit; filial piety averts rebellion.
Integrity curbs greed; caution prevents loss.
Generosity wins the multitude; abundance ensures sufficiency.
Tolerance embraces all; forbearance brings ease."*

The villages and towns were transformed by his teachings, turning toward goodness and shunning wrongdoing, with filial piety and brotherly love flourishing. In his daily life, he moved with the times, responding to circumstances no differently than an ordinary man. Yet wherever he dwelled, cranes cried and soared, and auspicious clouds swirled about him.

In the second year of the Ningkang era (374 CE), on the *jiaxu* day of his one hundred and thirty-sixth year, clouds and banners descended from the heavens as two immortals arrived in a chariot, their retinue grand and majestic. The Perfected Lord bowed in welcome. The immortals declared, "By decree of the Jade Emperor, we bestow upon you this edict, appointing you as the Celestial Historian of the Nine Provinces and the Illustrious Grand Envoy. We grant you a purple feathered robe, a jar of jade elixir, and a measure of golden cinnabar." The Perfected Lord bowed in reverence and received the gifts. One immortal said, "I am Cui Ziwen, the Jade Perfected Lord of the Upper Palace." The other said, "I am Xiaqiu Zhong, the Primordial Perfected Lord of the Grand Ministry." They informed the Perfected Lord of his ascension day before mounting their cloud chariot and departing.

The Perfected Lord gathered his disciples and the elders of his homeland, announcing the time of his ascension. A grand assembly was held in his courtyard, where a farewell feast was prepared. He exhorted them to perform good deeds and establish merit to attain the realm of immortals, leaving behind works such as the *"Master of the Sacred Sword"* and other texts. He composed ten five-character, two-line poems of admonition for his eleven disciples, bestowing them upon the world—these are the *"One Hundred Twenty Sacred Lots"* known today. He also transmitted the *"Great Merit Elixir of Wish-Fulfillment"* to his disciples who would not ascend with him, a formula still circulating in the world. Every year, the Yellow Center Fast is still observed. On the fifteenth day of the eighth month, a grand fast is held, summoning all villagers, young and old, to gather. At noon, auspicious clouds filled the sky, and celestial music resounded. Feathered canopies and dragon chariots descended, accompanied by an escort of divine soldiers.

Celestial youths and maidens led the way as the two envoys, Cui and Xia, descended once more. They proclaimed the Jade Emperor’s decree:

*"It has been commanded that the Controller of Destiny of Mount Qian transmit the Golden Elixir to the mortal realm. Seal your karmic debts and conceal your forms, that you, your kin, your household, your dwelling, and all your possessions may return to the Three Heavens. Purify your impurities at once and ascend beyond the earth. The Mighty Celestial Guards of the Left, bearing molten-gold fire bells, shall illuminate the Central Yellow to guide you—let none grow lax or negligent."*

The Perfected Lord bowed in reverent acceptance.

Following the decree and the words of the Jade Messenger, the Most Exalted Lord of Jade Truth, the Perfected Lord declared that though his disciples were many, only six were fit to accompany him. The rest each had their own appointed day of transcendence and could not join the ascent. Then he mounted the dragon chariot, ordering Chen Xun and Shi He to bear the registers and lead the way, while Zhou Guang and Hui Heng drove the team. Huang Renlan, with his father’s clan, attended as retainers; Xu Lie, with his mother’s household, followed in escort. Forty-two members of his immortal kin, together with his entire residence, ascended at once—even the chickens and dogs soared in their wake. The villagers, clinging in sorrow, prostrated themselves and wailed, unable to bear parting. The Perfected Lord then left behind a cultivation bell and a stone casket as tokens for future generations.

Among his servants was Xu Da, who, learning of the impending ascent, desperately begged to follow. The Perfected Lord, citing the decree’s fixed number of attendants, refused his plea. Instead, he instructed Xu and his wife to transport rice over the western ridge. By the time they heard of the ascent and rushed back in distress, overturning their rice cart in haste, the Perfected Lord had already departed. Beating their breasts, they gazed into the sky and wept. Taking pity, the Perfected Lord bestowed upon them the arts of earthly immortality, and the couple concealed themselves in the western mountains. The spilled rice took root and grew anew. Wishing to remain unknown, they changed their surname to Wu, and later to Wu Jian. Their shrine was established at the Market of Living Rice.

At Turning-Cart Ridge, some claimed to have glimpsed them, for they appeared and vanished unpredictably. As the Perfected Lord’s immortal procession soared into the heavens, a mortar and a chariot hub fell to earth, followed by a chicken coop some ten *li* southeast of his dwelling. Several mice also tumbled down, their intestines dragging yet still alive—it was said they had stolen and consumed the elixir. Later, those who witnessed such omens deemed them auspicious signs.

After the ascent, rosy clouds and propitious mists filled the valleys.

Within a hundred *li*, rare fragrances lingered for months without dissipating. When the Perfected Lord first returned from Jingyang, he presented Sichuan brocade as a token of trust to Mistress Chen, who fashioned it into temple drapes. On this day, the brocade suddenly flew back, circling above his former dwelling for an entire day before ascending once more into the clouds.

The Perfected Lord had once sought the Dao alongside Guo Pu, exploring sacred sites and scenic wonders. Passing through Qichu Mountain in Yichun, they were warmly received by Wang Shu, the son of the Prefectural Clerk. The Perfected Lord imparted immortal arts to him, adding, "This place faces a grotto-heaven ahead and overlooks the Yuan River below—it is fitting for a Daoist abbey." Wang Shu followed his counsel, inscribing the character *jing* (serenity) upon the wall before departing. When the Perfected Lord ascended, his cloud-borne carriage passed overhead, and he dispatched two azure-clad attendants to bid farewell. Wang Shu and his household pleaded for transcendence. The Perfected Lord replied, "Your bones are not yet ripe for immortality," and bestowed a single stalk of celestial maidenhair, instructing him to plant it. Consumed over time, it would grant longevity. Later, the Wang clan each lived a century. Today, at the Jade Void Abbey in Linjiang, the celestial maidenhair remains.

The Divine Martyr of the Dark Capital, the Wu Immortal Perfected Lord, named Meng and styled Shiyun, was a native of Puyang. Of utmost filial piety, he practiced the Dao and its arts in Wu, where he was consulted by the masses. Once, he crossed the Yuzhang River by day, fanning its waters with a feathered fan.
