**The Seven Realms of Daoist Cultivation and Realization Chart**

During the Yellow Emperor’s leisure in his palace, he ascended the Terrace of the Morning Star, where six sages attended him: Tian Lao, Li Mu, Da Hong, Tai Shan, Qi Xi, and Peng Zhang. They spoke to him of the Dao of non-action and the essentials of long life and cultivation.

The Yellow Emperor said: "When I sought audience with the Purple Mansion Lord on Green Mound, Master Ning on Mount Qingcheng, the Grand Harmony Lord on Flaming Isle, and the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign on Mount Emei, I inquired into the principles of the Five Teeth and Three Ones, as well as the wondrous methods of ascending to immortality. Yet in practice, I have not fully grasped them.

Moreover, man receives life as a mere aggregation of form, bones, blood, and flesh—a tangible existence. The Dao, in its function, is empty, tranquil, and formless—an intangible void. How can one with such corporeal obstacles realize the formless Dao?"

Tian Lao replied: "Heaven and earth, the myriad things—all follow the transformations of the Dao, arising from nothing into being. Humanity and all creatures, in their attainment of the Dao, return from being to nothingness—this is as effortless as turning one’s palm.

If one cultivates and grasps the essentials of the Dao, refining essence into spirit, spirit into qi, until qi merges with the Dao, then even the obstacles of form, bones, and flesh, or the vastness of mountains, rivers, and seas, can be transcended, transformed, and mastered—nothing is impossible, nothing unattainable."

Tian Lao said to the Yellow Emperor: "The people of the world are children of the Dao, born by receiving qi and assuming form to govern their lives. Heaven bestows spirit, earth bestows essence, and the Dao bestows qi—when these three converge, man is born.

Having received this body, one must preserve qi, cherish essence, and nurture spirit. When these three harmonize, long life is attainable. Yet the people of the world, unaware that their bodies arise from the Dao, abandon the root to chase the branches, courting death—how deeply deluded they are!

The method of cultivating the Dao progresses from the mundane to the sacred, ascending and descending through seven realms. Each realm encompasses fourteen thousand practices, and within the seven realms lie ninety-eight thousand gates to cultivation and paths to transcendence. All depend on diligence and perseverance, through which one may ascend to heaven."

The Most High Dao Lord’s *Silent Dao* states: "Those who study the Dao face nine afflictions—all grave maladies of humanity. If one discerns these afflictions, immortality may be attained.

The nine afflictions are:
1. Having the aspiration but lacking the opportunity;
2. Having the opportunity but lacking companions;
3. Having companions but lacking the aspiration;
4. Having the aspiration but lacking a teacher;
5. Having a teacher but failing to study;
6. Studying but lacking diligence;
7. Being diligent but unable to uphold the Dao;
8. Upholding the Dao but lacking steadfast resolve;
9. Resolving steadfastly but lacking perseverance.

Thus, among a thousand ordinary people, one may know the Dao; among a thousand who know the Dao, one may cultivate it; among a thousand cultivators, one may specialize with precision; among a thousand specialists, one may persevere with diligence. Through cultivation and perseverance, the Dao may be attained.

If one embraces the Dao in youth, unwavering in resolve, neither water nor fire can daunt the heart, nor can glory and splendor sway the will—cultivating truth with purity and constancy—then in time, a teacher will appear. One need not fear their absence. Thus, one may achieve success without companions and progress without external influence. These are the broad essentials of immortal study. Let those who cultivate the Dao reflect and apply themselves diligently."

The rewards of cultivation and realization are categorized as follows:

The Dao Lord said: "The wonders of the immortal Dao all have their methods. Mastery of these enables one to become a Perfected of the Nine Palaces—not merely ascending as an immortal.

Yet the Dao’s methods are manifold; when fully prepared, one may comprehend them.

Those born into the world who do not know the Dao differ not from plants and trees, nor from birds and beasts—they are called ordinary people. Among them, some awaken with clarity, recognizing the Great Dao, and resolve to cultivate and seek liberation from the world. These are called Daoists, or practitioners."

**First Fruition: Cavern Palace Immortals**
The Seventeen Net-Heavens’ Palaces.
Among those who study the Dao, the initial cultivation is the lower-grade *Nine Cycles of Cavern Palace Immortal Conduct*:

3. Delivering beings,
4. Encouraging and aiding,
5. Bestowing alms,
6. Making great vows,

If one cultivates these nine practices without deficiency, while observing the one hundred eighty precepts, accumulating one thousand two hundred meritorious deeds, and concurrently studying the *Taiqing* scriptural ranks, one becomes a *Cavern Palace Immortal* of the renowned mountains. They are attended by one hundred twenty jade lads and jade maidens. Their abode lies within the Ten Caverns beneath the earth, the Thirty-Six Caverns, and the grotto-palaces of the Five Marchmounts, where the essence of sun and moon is divided, and golden towers and jade halls with their immortal officials are all fully arrayed.

They are attended by five hundred jade lads and jade maidens. Their palaces and towers reside in the mysterious void above the Five Marchmounts, where congealed clouds and structured qi transform into palatial structures, with all offices and administrations fully established.

They are bestowed a nine-colored staff, ride a threefold-purity cloud, with ten thousand spirits as escorts, dragons and tigers harnessed to their carriage, and a purple cloud flying chariot with twelve jade wheels. They are attended by ninety thousand jade lads and jade maidens. Having attained the loftiest and most venerable rank, they stand equal with all sages, beyond the reach of words or images, merging their bodies with the Dao, penetrating into spontaneity. When they dissolve, they become qi; when they rest, they become human.

**Postscript:**
The Heavenly Worthy’s love for life is profound; the Dao Lord’s teachings are vast; Lord Lao’s deliverance of beings is utmost.
The Three Sages rotate their transformations, rescuing the benighted, all desiring to preserve the flesh-and-blood form, comparing it to the permanence of metal and stone, extending the lifespan of ephemeral fungi to match the great *chun* tree’s years. From mortal to immortal, from immortal to Perfected, from Perfected to Sage, they gallop in dragon-drawn chariots, roaming the Great Void, lifting nine generations from the dark yin, and enjoying boundless longevity through kalpas.
Yet the people of the world, endowed with the qi of the Dao and born from the Dao, spurn the pure, tranquil, and serene origin, pursuing toil, labor, and the realm of splendor. Like oxen and horses pulling heavy loads into the mire, they cannot extricate themselves, sinking ever deeper—how grievous!

The aspiration is that superior practitioners diligently cultivate, seeking abundant blessings for themselves.
