**The Supreme Cavern Mystery Numinous Treasure Scripture for the Protection of All Children**

The Dao speaks: The Father and Mother of Heaven and Earth, the sun, moon, and five planets revolve by their own nature. All people dwelling in the world have their lives bound to the Northern Dipper. The Seven Stars, Three Terraces, Auxiliary Stars, Canopy Star, Star Officials of One’s Original Destiny, True Lords of the Yuanchen, the Twenty-Eight Constellations, the Southern Dipper and Northern Dipper, Eastern Dipper and Western Dipper, all stellar officials and their retinues, the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water, the Weaving Maid of the River, the multitudes of stars in the Celestial River, and all the immortals—when men and women of the world establish themselves in this defiled realm, passing through gates and thresholds, they collide with the Celestial Dog, the Celestial River, baleful stars, and inauspicious constellations, thereby incurring harm and conflict. The Three Sha and Six Harms bring misfortune in unbroken succession, and who knows where their fate tends? If one can pray and recite with sincere devotion, invoking blessings and flowing grace, then all men and women—whether seeking descendants or preserving long life—may universally repay the multitude of spirits, and all wishes shall be thus fulfilled. The Seven Injuries and Six Harms within the body, the Yuanchen of gestation, and all impending calamities may be averted. The good children of the ten directions shall bestow their mighty radiance, dispelling adversity and preserving life to extend longevity.

The Dao speaks: The Dao is capable of creation and nurturance. The Seven Divine Children are the essence and qi of the Seven Stars of the Central Heaven’s Northern Dipper. When a person is sheltered in the womb, in the seventh month, they descend into the body, illuminating the nine orifices, recording the name, and thus coming under their jurisdiction. The first is called Heavenly Peril, the second Heavenly Interior, the third Heavenly Assault, the fourth Heavenly Auxiliary, the fifth Heavenly Quail, the sixth Heavenly Heart, and the seventh Heavenly Pillar.

The Dao speaks: The various good children each ride the Seven Radiant Chariots of Flying Clouds, clad in garments of five colors, accompanied by the divine soldiers and cavalry of the ten directions, numbering seventy million. They constantly dwell among humanity, multiplying their forms and transformations, now tall, now short, now male, now female, wielding talismans and registers, inspecting and recording the causes and conditions of sins and blessings, the length of men’s and women’s lives. Those who know this shall not die and shall attain long life.

If the men and women of the world, whose lives are separated by stellar rivers and who dwell in lofty chambers, encounter difficulties of separation, where bridges are impassable and they are stranded on the banks of the thirty-six stellar rivers—at dusk blocked by the Celestial Dog, at dawn crossed by the Earthly Dog—then their families sigh in sorrow, anxious and without recourse. They should but earnestly burn incense and recite the scripture, reverently invoking the Seven True Qi Children of the Primordial Essence to flow grace and descend blessings, to deliver them from calamity and release men and women, allowing them to cross the stellar rivers. Solitary spirits shall not afflict children, and the River Mother shall not encroach upon the young. Men and women shall mature, their lives extended, the Southern Dipper adding to their tally of years, the Northern Dipper erasing the characters of death from their registers. Parents shall be at peace, each preserving good fortune and prosperity.

First, invoke the Nine Qi Heavenly Nine Divine Children of the East to deliver all men and women from the illnesses, Three Punishments, Four Executions, Seven Injuries, Eight Difficulties, and the afflictions of the River Spirits that arise in the three months of spring, causing all to dissipate.

Second, invoke the Three Qi Heavenly Three Divine Children of the South to deliver all men and women from the illnesses, Three Punishments, Four Executions, Seven Injuries, Eight Difficulties, and the afflictions of the River Spirits that arise in the three months of summer, causing all to dissipate.

Third, invoke the Seven Qi Heavenly Seven Divine Children of the West to deliver all men and women from the illnesses, Three Punishments, Four Executions, Seven Injuries, Eight Difficulties, and the afflictions of the River Spirits that arise in the three months of autumn, causing all to dissipate.

Fourth, invoke the Five Qi Heavenly Five Divine Children of the North to deliver all men and women from the illnesses, Three Punishments, Four Executions, Seven Injuries, Eight Difficulties, and the afflictions of the River Spirits that arise in the three months of winter, causing all to dissipate.

Fifth, invoke the One Qi Heavenly One Divine Child of the Center to deliver all men and women from the illnesses, stellar river encroachments, Three Calamities, and Nine Adversities that arise within the four seasons, causing all to be resolved and dispelled.

The Dao speaks: You good men and good women, if you but read and recite this scripture, the Five Divine Children and the sagely multitudes of the ten directions shall immediately come to protect you, descending blessings and dispelling calamities, eradicating sins and transgressions. Then is proclaimed the following ode:

All is fundamentally empty and void,
All first receive the revolving qi.
What is known is not true knowing,
Without retention, there is no stagnation.
Names and forms abound among the many,
Confusedly accumulated over the years.
The immortal deliverance is most distant,
Attaining the One, returning to true principle.
Wandering the scriptures without fixed direction,
Provisionally responding, not of one form.
All is obtained through this scripture,
Through kalpas, naturally purified.
Taking refuge in the Supreme Scripture,
Longevity’s tally is long preserved.
Officers and soldiers ever protect,
Misfortune departs, blessings arrive.

At that time, the Seven Star Children of the Northern Dipper, the Five Divine Children, and the good children of the ten directions, their number like grains of sand, gathered their qi and amassed merit. Coming to the Five Defiled Worlds, the Seven Injuries and Six Harms naturally return to the correct aim. The qi of Heaven and Earth, yin and yang, revolve in endless cycles. Nurturing the people, the Controller of Destinies establishes the decree of life. The myriad spirits chant their reverent assent, and there is no longer any delay. Men shall be wise and intelligent, women shall be upright and kind. Malevolent afflictions cannot arise, and to the end of their days, they shall preserve blessed descendants. Thus, with utmost sincerity and devotion, take refuge in the Supreme Scripture.
