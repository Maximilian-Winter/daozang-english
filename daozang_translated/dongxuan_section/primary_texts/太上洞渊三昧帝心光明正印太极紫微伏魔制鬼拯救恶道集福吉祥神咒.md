At that time, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy and the Heavenly Worthy of Majestic Virtue and Self-Mastery together proclaimed again *The Great Ultimate and Purple Tenuity Subduing Demons, Conquering Ghosts, Delivering from Evil Realms, Dispelling Disasters, and Gathering Blessings Auspicious Divine Incantation*.

The Six Heavens trembled, demonic mountains crumbled.
Grudges and descendants severed at the root, earth’s foundations cut at the stem.
Ghostly destinies extinguished, all transformed into good spirits.

At that time, the immeasurable flying immortals in the assembly,
The pure and harmonious jade maidens, the water scribes and true consorts,
The fragrant blossom jade maidens, the hundreds of thousands of millions of beings,
Rained eight-colored heavenly flowers, swirling and drifting down,
Fragrant winds and black aromas, harmonious qi suffusing all.

The Primordial Heavenly King addressed the Perfected of Settled Unity and the Perfected of Verdant Net:
"This divine incantation’s jade script is the Samādhi Emperor’s Heart,
The Luminous True Seal, the wondrous root of the Great Ultimate,
The Perfected of Purple Tenuity.
It can shatter the hearts of vengeful demons,
Deliver from the sufferings of ghostly destinies,
Dispel the ten thousand disasters,
And gather the ten thousand blessings.
Its merit is boundless, beyond conception.
Today, for your sakes, I proclaim again the jade text,
Adorning the incantation’s heart, perfecting the wondrous practice.
May you, holding this incantation and seal,
Benefit humans and heavens,
Ferry all sentient beings,
And together ascend to sagely fruition.

Now, I proclaim the jade decree, entrusting the two perfected ones:
You, receiving the mandate, shall carry it out,
Universally saving, universally ferrying."

The Heavenly Worthy of Majestic Virtue and Self-Mastery exhorted the two perfected ones, Dingyi and the others:
"Fill the ten directions,
Hold my luminous wheel.
The Samādhi Great Seal,
The Emperor’s Heart enacting the great heart.
Subdue the six cavernous demons,
Destroy the myriad ghostly droughts.
Release the twelve grudges,
Their nets all dissolved and pacified.
Ghostly destinies’ evil roots severed,
Fierce demons transformed into good spirits.
My Dao’s qi surges,
Pure harmony’s transforming winds.
From those ghostly and obscure,
Directly transcend to the Three Goodnesses.
The Emperor’s Heart becomes the great heart,
The true qi eternally harmonious and fused.
Cultivating immortality, practicing the Great Vehicle,
Wondrous practices manifesting mysterious merit.
Attaining realization, ascending as immortal dukes,
Enabling the Cavernous Abyss’s heart,
Mysteriously controlling the three dragons.
Transforming and uniting the hearts of all beings,
Luminous clarity pervading the ten penetrations."

Within the chambers of the Great Perfection’s abode,
Roaming freely upon Radiant Flower Peak,
Joyfully dwelling in the Golden Portal’s court,
Jade radiance shared between self and other.
Qi communes with the Primordial Beginning,
Auspicious signs manifesting great merit.

Thereupon, the Most Mysterious Dao Father,
Venerable Heavenly Worthy of Majestic Virtue and Self-Mastery,
Perfected One of Unwavering Singularity,
Perfected One of Verdant Canopy,
Flying Immortals and Jade Maidens,
Pure Harmony Jade Maidens,
Aquatic Scribe Perfected Consorts,
Fragrant Flower Jade Gatherers,
and the assembled host of celestial immortals—
with myriad mouths yet a single light,
in unison voicing one sound,
spontaneously and harmoniously extolled in praise:

*"The Purple Tenuity Emperor’s Heart Mantra of the Great Ultimate,
Ten Penetrations’ auspicious sandalwood-flame hook.
We, with our six senses, offer this laudation,
Only wishing for compassion to witness our deliverance.
The mantra’s flame illumines boundlessly, pervading the Dharma Realm,
Great light, great clarity, wheel of the Three Luminaries.
Brighter than sun, moon, and celestial radiance,
Its luminance shines upon dark paths, universally dispelling gloom.
The mantra’s sound resounds endlessly, permeating the Dharma Realm,
Divine thunder, celestial drums, jade tones transmitted.
Vibrant splendor of Dharma rhythm echoes as numinous sound,
Awakening all beings to perfect wisdom.
The mantra’s fragrance suffuses boundlessly, filling the Dharma Realm,
Neither waxing nor waning, the wind of supreme harmony.
Scattered as Dharma rain, rising as clouds,
Its dew moistens all beings, universally purifying.
The mantra’s savor pervades boundlessly, encompassing the Dharma Realm,
Supreme harmony, Supreme Oneness, source of myriad virtues.
Externally as divine water, internally as the Flower Pool,
Nourishing all beings to enduring longevity.
The mantra’s forms manifest infinite transformations,
True and responsive Dharma bodies like grains of sand.
Golden flesh, jade bones, myriad Dao perfections,
Indestructible vajra forms, imperishable.
The mantra’s heart, with ten penetrations, fills the Dharma Realm,
Neither high nor low, universally enlightening.
A single dragon’s radiance emerges from Central Mountain,
Illuminating humans and heavens, all awaken.
The mantra’s might is immeasurable, its divine powers vast,
Its power surpassing Nāya and the Ancient Venerable.
Subduing the great demonic armies of the Six Caverns,
Severing ghostly blades to rectify the immortal Dao.
The mantra’s blessings are boundless, perfectly complete,
Surpassing even the wealth and nobility of kings.
Like the Heavenly Worthy’s great Wish-Fulfilling Pearl,
Its light shines endlessly, treasury of merit and virtue.
The mantra’s virtue is immeasurable, its great compassion boundless,
From kalpa to kalpa, extending benevolence.
Majestic among the Three Qi, honored within the Dao,
Universally aiding humans and heavens to perfection."*

Having praised with their six senses,
They planted the Mysterious Root beyond the body.
The Mysterious Root flourishes eternally, filling humans and heavens,
Equal in the One Vehicle’s true and wondrous practice.

At that time, the Most Mysterious Dao Father,
Venerable Heavenly Worthy of Majestic Virtue and Self-Mastery,
Perfected One of Unwavering Singularity,
Perfected One of Verdant Canopy,
and the assembled Perfected Ones, divine immortals,
Heavenly Emperors, divine kings,
Immortal officials, immortal kings,
Flying Immortals, Jade Maidens,
Aquatic Scribe Perfected Consorts,
Fragrant Flower Jade Gatherers, and others—
having extolled in praise,
bowed their heads to the Heavenly Worthy,
took their leave, and withdrew.
