### **The Dharma Candle**

**Dharma** refers to rules and standards, collectively termed "Dharma." The compass draws circles, the square marks angles—all things attain correctness through them.

**Candle** denotes an object that emits light, assisting the moon and continuing the sun, dispelling darkness and illuminating obscurity. By its brightness, one gains vision.

Crookedness lacks Dharma and thus cannot rectify itself; applying Dharma without clarity fails to reveal gains and losses. To rectify, one cannot be without Dharma; to apply Dharma, one cannot be without illumination. To stabilize oneself, one must purify; purification cannot proceed without encountering this sutra. This sutra thus serves as the candle of Dharma. Holding fast to it and traversing the Daoist canon, one attains true realization.

The Dao declares: Among all things, humans are most noble; among humans, life is most precious. Life depends on nothing but spirit and qi. Spirit and qi within the body govern the vitality of the four limbs. One cannot be without qi for even a moment, nor lose spirit in movement or stillness. Losing spirit causes the five viscera to decay; losing qi leads to collapse and death. Qi and spirit always move in tandem—spirit and qi rely on each other to strengthen. When spirit departs, qi perishes; when qi severs, the body is lost.

All know to fear death and delight in life, yet fail to recognize that the work of living lies in spirit and qi. Instead, they repeatedly harm their minds, violate their qi, indulge their spirits, and carve away their lives. They do not cherish stillness or preserve their true nature, thus inviting ruin and decay.

How can one not treasure essence and guard qi to seek prolonged vision? Harmonizing and nurturing all things brings the blessings of branches and leaves.

The sages, seeing the common people rushing after the five desires and unable to stabilize themselves, established purification rites. Through addressing affairs, they ceased affairs; through precepts, they restrained inner bandits; through dignity, they guarded against external thieves. Chanting and recitation engage body and speech, guiding movement back to stillness. Meditating on the spirit engages the mind, steering existence toward emptiness. In stillness and emptiness, one merges with the Dao—like reining in the hooves of a swift steed to align the chariot of returning to truth.

Yan Zun said: "Empty the heart to trace the origins of Dao and virtue; still the qi to await the numinous brightness." This is the meaning.

Yet in the degenerate age, scholars value ornament over substance. Blessings lie in stillness, yet they seek them in motion; life rests within, yet they abandon the self for external things. Such people, though eager to practice purification, do not understand its methods. Or they understand the methods but not its essence; or grasp its essence but not its meaning; or comprehend its meaning but not its intent. Confused and disordered, they act without restraint, drifting astray and losing their foundation, forever unaware. Like sailing against a gale while following a swift current, they do not know to turn back to the source, thus sinking forever in the sea of suffering. How can this not be lamentable? How can it not be grievous?

Therefore, this sutra expounds ten chapters to be applied during purification rites, titled *The Dharma Candle*. One chapter on preliminary invocation, six chapters on the six periods of ritual practice, and three chapters on the three periods of spirit meditation. If the Dharma master illuminates these while conducting purification and presiding over the altar, and the assembly receives them with empty minds and solemn vows, then their vision and hearing will be clear, and they may glimpse the gate of the Great Dao.

The Dao declares: **Dao** is the name for the ultimate principle. **Virtue** is acting in accordance with principle. **Sutra** is the path of passage.

Dao is like a road; virtue is good virtue; sutra is like a measured path; practice is like walking; Dharma is like a model. Those who study the Dao must rely on Dharma to seek the sutra, practice goodness to cultivate virtue, and thus attain the Dao. Without performing meritorious deeds but merely holding to one thing without deviation, one will never achieve the Dao—like sitting at home without walking, how can one reach the destination?

The Dao is completed through the union of three to form virtue. If virtue is not fulfilled by three, nothing can be accomplished. The three are: Dao, virtue, and the person. The person is one; practicing meritorious deeds is two; virtue sufficient to complete the Dao is three. Only when these three unite does one attain the Dao.

If one merely performs meritorious deeds but does not understand the Dao, one will not attain it. If one merely understands the Dao but lacks meritorious deeds, one will not attain it. If there is Dao and Dharma but no person, then the ultimate principle is obscured and returns to nothingness—like planting grain, sowing seeds in the earth without water to moisten them, how can they grow? With ruler and minister but no people, how can governance proceed? With heaven and earth but no beings, how can nurturance be fulfilled? Thus it is said: "The three generate the myriad things."

The Dao declares: Those who wish to govern others must first govern themselves; those who wish to rectify others must first rectify themselves. To govern the body and rectify the heart, nothing precedes purification and uprightness.

**Purification** means alignment—aligning the uneven conduct of people. **Uprightness** means rectification—rectifying the hearts of people entering the Dao. Pure thoughts and tranquil spirit are the meaning of purification.

The purpose of purification is that human life is burdened by the four great afflictions. When hungry, one worries about food; when cold, one worries about clothing. Once clothing and food are sufficient, one worries about accumulation. The poor desire wealth; the lowly desire nobility. Thus, cravings for flavors, sounds, and sights multiply. Before attainment, one worries about failure; after attainment, one worries about loss. The mind has no moment of stability, and one toils in anxiety throughout life.

In restless striving and competitive action, affairs accumulate in turmoil. Right and wrong, gain and loss, sorrow and joy, anger and delight, thoughts and anxieties swirl in confusion. The body labors, the spirit suffers, the Dao’s qi distances itself, the hun and po depart, the body becomes an empty city, and malevolent forces daily encroach. Illness and misfortune befall, life is cut short, and the body perishes, suffering the punishments of the three paths, with calamities flowing into future generations.

Thus, the sage establishes purification through fasting and stillness, casting aside worldly toil, summoning back the hun and po, and resting the spirit. One must be utterly sincere, reverent, and solemn, refraining from speech and ceasing idle chatter, avoiding jest and laughter, and any cause for reproach. Banish stray thoughts and chaotic notions; let the eyes not gaze upon forms, nor witness right and wrong. Let the ears not listen to sounds, nor hear of ill or auspicious omens. With detachment as the heart’s disposition and emptiness as its intent, harmony as its guiding principle and moderation in food as its foundation, one contemplates the Dao and preserves the spirit. Then, heaven and humanity resonate, disasters vanish, blessings descend, and one attains the nature of life.

Thus it is said: *Stillness is the rectitude of all under heaven.*

The Dao declares: *In fasting, merely cultivate correctness. Heaven and earth become serene. Cut off thoughts utterly, and with a single thought, union is achieved.* The qi of the Dao flows freely, entering the human path. The generals, officials, and soldiers one receives will guard and protect, heeding one’s commands, fulfilling every wish.

If one cannot maintain stillness but instead is restless and overburdened with cares, violating harmony and defying the natural order, offending the hidden laws, lacking good conduct, and refusing to amend an evil heart, then the officials and soldiers will abandon and no longer serve. One’s requests will go unfulfilled, and misfortunes will converge.

Thus it is said: *One governs all under heaven by acting without contrivance.*

The Dao declares: *Fasting may be called the ordering of a hundred practices, the establishment of ten thousand virtues.* One must be able to endure humiliation, to be yielding and gentle, to be compassionate and loving, to be benevolent and giving, to accumulate hidden merits, to be loyal and filial, to be utterly sincere, to be cautious and trustworthy, to be vigilant and reverent. Only after mastering these ten abilities may one engage in fasting and tranquil reflection, turning inward to listen and gaze within, returning awareness to the body’s form. The mouth does not speak idly, the body does not move recklessly.

Thus, the formless is perceived as form, the soundless is heard as sound, the tasteless is savored as sweetness, and the wordless is answered in kind. The divine descends, blessings converge, and one attains a heart transformed and a mind sanctified. Auspicious dreams and visions appear, one discerns omens of what is yet to come, and no wish goes unfulfilled—this is the proof.

If outwardly one fails to uphold dignified conduct and inwardly neglects the precepts, with no deeds worth recording and no merits worth manifesting, lacking sincerity and wavering in doubt, with inner and outer in discord, words and heart at odds, temperament hasty and nature perverse, given to duplicity and double-tongued speech, harboring secret curses and envy, thoughts misaligned with the self, spirit dissipated in excess and desire, coveting wealth and lusting after beauty, unable to master body and mind—then, though one may fast, one will gain no blessing throughout life.

Why is this so? Because the mind does not abide within, the hun and po are labored and scattered without, and harmonious qi departs. Thus, nothing can be moved to resonance.

Thus it is said: *Eliminate desire to attain stillness, and all under heaven will be rectified.*

The Dao declares: *In practicing the Dao through fasting, one must uphold the precepts and broadly deliver all without limit.* The subtle and wondrous prohibitions restrain and gather the mind’s impulses, subduing the heart to attain purity. Calamities and defilements vanish. One employs the expedient means of wisdom, extricating oneself from the difficulties of birth and death, cutting off all thoughts, and entering the realm of non-action. Observe deeply the arising, examine closely the ceasing, discern the afflictions, and heal them with the medicine of kindness.

If one sees forms of profit, cover the eyes with admonition. If one hears resentful or hateful words, block the ears with admonition. If one tastes sweet and fragrant delicacies, restrain the mouth with admonition. If one craves wealth and treasures, indulging in love and desire, curb the heart with admonition. If one intends to commit transgressions or pursue evil deeds, break the feet with admonition. Having grasped the essentials, if the body does not transgress the precepts, one transcends the snares of the world and does not enter its dust.

Amidst the throng of worldly attachments, the heart abides in the treasury of the Dao’s precepts. In the dwelling of sorrow and adversity, the heart rests in the hall of benevolent deliverance. In the chamber of darkness, the heart stands at the threshold of extinction. Beneath the unstable roof, the heart dwells at the gate of expedient means. Upon the ground of serpents and vipers, the heart treads the path of renunciation. In the lair of tigers and leopards, the heart resides in the abode of blessings and virtue. Aboard a perilous floating vessel, the heart is steadfast on the way to self-deliverance. Near the blazing forest, the heart focuses on the essentials of quenching. In the thorny garden, the heart stands behind the shield of vigilance. This is how I uphold the precepts and employ the expedient means of wisdom.

Thus it is said: *Blunt the sharpness, untangle the knots.*

The Dao declares: *The way of humanity is founded upon three dependencies and five regulators.*

What are the three dependencies? The first is spirit, the second is qi, and the third is form. Spirit stands through qi, qi moves through spirit, form exists through spirit, and spirit is stored through form. When spirit departs, qi scatters; when qi scatters, form perishes. Thus, the sage first nurtures the spirit, then nurtures qi, and then nurtures form. When these three are harmonized and mutually attuned, one may attain longevity.

What are the five regulators? The first is essence, which governs the perception of the five colors; the second is spirit, which governs the hearing of the five sounds; the third is the hun, which governs the discernment of good and evil; the fourth is the po, which governs the examination of purity and turbidity; the fifth is qi, which governs the recognition of pain and itching.

Thus, the body is the dwelling of spirit and hun. The five viscera are the chambers of essence and hun. The nine orifices are the doors and windows of spirit and qi. When a person’s eyes see, ears hear, nose breathes, mouth speaks, and body senses pain and itching, all these are the workings of spirit, essence, hun, po, and qi. If one of these is absent, one becomes foolish; if two are absent, one becomes confused; if three are absent, one declines and weakens; if four are absent, a hundred illnesses arise; if five are absent, one dies.

In death, the eyes can no longer see, the ears can no longer hear, the nose can no longer breathe, the mouth can no longer speak, and the body no longer senses pain or itching. Is this because the eyes, ears, nose, mouth, and body no longer exist? It is simply that spirit, essence, hun, po, and qi have departed.

Thus, joy and anger scatter essence so that it is not stored; sorrow and worry obstruct the spirit so that it does not flow; fright and terror cause the hun and po to fly away; excessive eating and drinking stagnate the form and block the qi.

Thus, the sage observes: those who lose their spirit die young; those who lose their essence go mad; those who lose their hun weep in sorrow; those who lose their po grow pallid; those who lose their will become disordered; those who lose their intent become listless.

Therefore, empty the heart and dispel desires, blunt sharpness and resolve entanglements. Do not let fondness for beauty and excess harm the essence; do not let thoughts of love and hatred harm the spirit; do not let joy and pleasure in unrestrained postures harm the hun; do not let fury and rage in vehement outbursts harm the po; do not let immoderate eating and drinking harm the form; do not let extreme sorrow and lamentation harm the qi.

Instead, dwell in tranquility and seclusion, harmonize with the qi of Heaven and Earth, preserve it within the body, follow the four seasons, adapt to cold and heat, regulate yin and yang, balance joy and anger, moderate food and drink, adjust sorrow and suffering, avoid mist and dew, escape wind and rain. Treasure qi and replenish essence, nourish the hun with the spirit of the valley. Inwardly, see as though blind; reverse hearing as though deaf. Be empty and indifferent, unattached to east or west. Within, preserve the five viscera, distinguishing their colors and forms.

Preserving the heart augments essence; preserving the liver augments clarity; preserving the lungs makes the body radiant; preserving the spleen makes the body light; preserving the kidneys lengthens the qi. When spirit and qi are guarded within, where can illness arise?

Thus it is said: "The spirit of the valley never dies."

The Dao teaches: humans receive the five viscera, endowed by the five phases. Externally, they form the body; internally, they shape temperament. Bones belong to Wood; blood to Water; flesh to Earth; teeth to Metal; warmth of qi to Fire. The liver embodies benevolence; the lungs, righteousness; the heart, propriety; the kidneys, trust; the spleen, wisdom. The nature of Wood is strong and upright; Fire, fierce and intense; Earth, kind and harmonious; Metal, stern and keen; Water, modest and retiring.

Moreover, at the inception of endowment, each possesses purity or turbidity, hardness or softness. Those endowed with pure qi are wise, sagely, and enlightened. Those with soft qi are gentle, harmonious, compassionate, sincere, and honest. Those with hard qi are lofty, stern, and heroic. Those with turbid qi are foolish, cruel, and violent. Each follows its endowment to determine temperament.

Temperament is destiny. The foolish indulge it and shorten their lives; the wise deeply perceive and restrain their nature. They rectify the heart and conduct, reverently contemplate the supreme Dao, examine and perceive the original heart, and ensure all actions accord with the Dao. Where nothing is possessed and nothing is discordant, they use the laws of Heaven to restrain and sever their fundamental nature, transform their temperament, subdue their hearts, follow the teachings of their masters, and submit their lives to the venerable masters, never daring to slacken. Thus, heavenly spirits respect them, earthly deities protect them, the malevolent and rebellious fear them, venerable masters aid them, the Controller of Destiny records them, inscribing their names in the left register. The Southern Dipper records their names in the register of life; the Northern Dipper erases them from the ledger of death. They become perfected beings.

Subduing nature and bearing destiny—this is what it means.

Thus it is said: "Returning to destiny is called constancy. Not knowing constancy, reckless action brings misfortune."

The Dao teaches: to guard the Dao and meditate in stillness, first sit upright, close the gates of ears and eyes, and return the radiance of spirit to the Crimson Palace. Sever all thoughts; do not forcefully fix the gaze or allow wandering thoughts. Gradually, the breath becomes subtle. Continuing thus, one naturally ceases to be aware of breathing. Unaware of breath, one no longer perceives the body. To forget the body is to attain stability, the gateway to the Dao.

At such a time, the spirit resides in the emptiness of Heaven, gazing left and right without seeing anything—this is the proof.

Thus it is said: "Block the openings, close the gates. Use its light, return to its radiance."

The Dao teaches: within the human body are the Three Ones—spirit, hun, and po. The central One is the spirit, the essence of harmony, its qi upright. The left One is the hun, the essence of pure yang, its qi clear. The right One is the po, the essence of pure yin, its qi turbid. The central One is my spirit, the child of the Dao. The left and right Ones each assist my spirit. Their qi, clear or turbid, determines whether their actions are good or evil.

The left One daily urges me toward goodness; its merits grow daily, and I attain the true Dao. The right One daily teaches me evil, drawing me into wickedness. My evil deepens, and I sink into the city of depravity. Those who practice the Dao, desiring to understand these Three Ones, awaken to good and evil, and distinguish right from wrong, must still the body and quiet the mind, diligently study the scriptures, and reflect inwardly. Then wisdom arises naturally. They subdue the five desires, cleanse the six emotions, cultivate goodness, and accumulate merit. Thus, the right One—demons, ghosts, and all evil—will be subdued and unable to disturb them.

With focused and upright thoughts, resonance is swiftly achieved. If one does not discern right from wrong, lacks good deeds, and forcibly closes the ears and eyes to contemplate the spirit and practice the Dao, then all manner of evil will assail them, generating wicked thoughts. As one thought fades, another arises, endlessly following one after another, without respite. Thus confused and deluded, they remain unsettled for ten thousand kalpas.

Thus it is said: "Embrace the One, cleanse the mysterious mirror."

The Dao teaches: humans possess spirit, essence, hun, and po, their bodies distinct from common creatures. Their nobility aligns with Heaven and Earth in the Dao; their worth unites with the divine in virtue; their clarity connects with the sun and moon in perception. If they can still the form and settle the mind, purify with sincerity and observe the fast, revere the Three Treasures, and deeply recognize the positions of the celestial officials and soldiers, they may return their radiance to inwardly observe the palaces within the body, preserve the dwelling places of the divine luminaries, and constantly seek the true in emptiness, the existent in nothingness. Then, the heights of the nine heavens may be illuminated, the depths of the nine earths may be seen, the mysterious essence may descend, and the Primordial Beginning may be received.

The Most High is most honored and manifests through utmost sincerity; the Dao of life is most weighty and responds to utmost sincerity. Thus, those who seek life arise from within the abdomen. Within a single form, one knows the body of Heaven and Earth, encompassing eighty-one domains, containing the four seas and five peaks. Clouds rise and rain falls through exhalation; moisture and fluids gather through inhalation. The form remains while the spirit travels, swift as pointing to the palm.

Seated in cultivation within the chamber of the heart and breast, one may yet attain blessings beyond the eight extremities. When spirit harmonizes and mist gathers, it arises from unwavering purity. In a single moment, calamities dissolve and longevity is attained—everlasting life lies within oneself.

Thus it is said:
Without gazing through the window, one sees the Dao of Heaven.
Without stepping beyond the door, one knows all under Heaven.
