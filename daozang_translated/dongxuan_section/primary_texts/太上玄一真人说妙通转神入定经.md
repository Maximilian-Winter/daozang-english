# 太上玄一真人说妙通转神入定经

The Supreme Perfected of the Mysterious Unity, the Most High, expounds *The Sutra of Wondrous Communication and Turning the Spirit to Enter Samādhi* #1

The Dao speaks: Those who revolve through the cycle of rebirth without perishing may return to be born among humans, endowed with keen intelligence, a harmonious heart, and a gentle disposition. If they are devoted to the Three Treasures, aspire to the immortals, and contemplate meritorious deeds, they should broadly cultivate the field of blessings. When merit is complete and virtue perfected, they may practice wondrous communication, turn the spirit, and enter samādhi, thereby attaining the utmost perfection.

If the practice of the Dao is incomplete, immortality will not be achieved. Since time immemorial, across countless kalpas, those who have accumulated learning and become perfected immortals and the natural Daoists of the ten directions have all attained this through their deeds and conduct. By restraining the mind, steadfast in resolve, sitting in contemplation of the subtle, every movement and stillness becomes an act of turning the spirit—thus attaining the rank of high immortals.

Their thoughts are most subtle, their contemplations most vast, boundless and immeasurable. When conduct is perfected and samādhi entered, they attain the immortals’ way. You must diligently practice, for it will surely accord with the heart of the Dao.

The Dao speaks: If you study the immortals’ way, let your thoughts be boundless, and you will universally attain long life. Your body and my spirit will enter samādhi and wondrous communication.

The verse of boundless wondrous communion and turning the spirit says:
Wondrous communion turns my spirit,
Vast and universal, boundless merit.
The Dao completes the kalpas of heaven and earth,
Its wheel of transformation unfolds the nine heavens.
Extinction and rebirth, life and death,
Each has its cause and condition, each its origin.
Who awakens to the reasons for going and coming?
Form and soul have no beginning or end.
Accumulated blessings rest upon the foundation of fortune,
The body escapes the peak of five perils.
Freed from the three evil destinies,
One enters the serene void, light and free.
Thoughts ferry boundless realms,
Settled contemplation evokes spiritual communion.
The Dharma is conveyed to the three degrees’ field,
Transforming into a lofty immortal lord.
I turn my steps of the great *chun* tree,
Soaring to the Palace of the Supreme Ultimate.

The Dao says: The *Scripture on Boundless Wondrous Communion and Turning the Spirit to Samādhi* entirely governs the practice of the Dao. A single thought unites form and spirit, universally entering the utmost truth. It was received by the Highest Lord of the Dao, the August Jade Emperor. The supreme sages and perfected ones of the ten directions who have attained the immortal Dao all cultivate this method to broadly deliver the boundless. Its blessings are vast and universal, bestowing grace without exception. Its merit equals heaven and earth, its achievements shine like the sun and moon. Those who study without this method lack sufficient Dao-practice; how then can they achieve immortality? Yet what the Highest Lord values is not practiced in the world, and few possess its text. Should one obtain it, the immortal Dao is spontaneously achieved. All should present offerings of gold and silk as tokens of sincerity, approach a master to request transmission, for the Dao treasures its methods, and without sincerity, they cannot be practiced. To transmit lightly is to treat them as worthless; to cultivate emptily is to debase the Dao. Both incur the judgment of the wind-blade; be warned and take heed.

The Dao says: My *Scripture of the Wondrous Wheel of the Dao* comes from the immeasurable. Even kalpas as numerous as the sands of the Ganges cannot compare. The formation and dissolution of heaven and earth cannot be reckoned; all scriptures may perish, but my scripture will not. It turns with the cycles, its transformations ever more flourishing, delivering the boundless. Among scriptures, it is supreme, like the heavens opening to transformation. Without this scripture, the Dharma cannot spread. As all teachings unfold, this scripture is their origin. As all stars shine universally, this scripture is like the moon at its brightest, most luminous, illuminating the ten directions. As the three realms lie in dark obscurity, this scripture is like the rising sun, universally illuminating all heavens, none left unbrightened. As the myriad rivers flow, this scripture is like the abyss of Tanggu, the source of the great sea, to which all return. As Kunlun is lofty, this scripture is like the Jade Capital Mountain, encompassing all. This scripture is subtle and wondrous, enduring with heaven and earth. The primordial kings of the heavens, the lofty immortals and perfected ones—numberless beyond reckoning—all receive its command.

Thus it universally saves sentient beings. Whether they study or not, it instructs the three vehicles, broadly opening the Dharma-gates. Above, it orders the Three Luminaries; in the middle, it harmonizes yin and yang; below, it unfolds the myriad lives. All receive its sheltering shade, their seven generations delivered, their destitute souls turned and liberated. Birth and death, injury and ruin—none fail to be perfected. Its wheel turns without ceasing, like a boat ferrying people.

Those who cultivate this scripture with unwavering devotion swiftly summon the dragon-chariot, ascending in broad daylight, dwelling in peace and sitting in uprightness. Those who contemplate this scripture see their households flourish, a hundred blessings like mountains. Their sons and daughters are talented and wise; wealth and honor grow daily. Kings, lords, and nobles who venerate this scripture attain limitless rank, producing generations of worthy and enlightened rulers. Women in seclusion who contemplate this scripture transform their bodies into men. Those in dark obscurity who contemplate this scripture immediately find release, clearly beholding the Eight Clarities. Those who lodge alone in fear who contemplate this scripture see demons and goblins vanish, as if ten thousand people shared the room. Those who encounter venomous beasts in desolate mountains who contemplate this scripture see the beasts retreat in hiding, unharmed. Those who cross great rivers and meet wind and waves who contemplate this scripture see rivers and seas grow still, dragons emerging to welcome them. Those who enter fire who contemplate this scripture remain unburned, the flames extinguishing themselves. Those who enter epidemics and the midst of ten thousand ghosts who contemplate this scripture see ghosts and toxins vanish, the sick restored to health. Those afflicted with dire illness who contemplate this scripture cast off calamity, forever preserving long life. Those in destitution and starvation who contemplate this scripture swallow qi and partake of its nourishment, becoming sated. Those imprisoned in dungeons and heavy fetters who contemplate this scripture see their bonds released, spared from punishment. Those seized by officials and clerks who contemplate this scripture see their shackles undone, the clerks rejoicing. Those with enemies who contemplate this scripture find their hearts gladdened and resentment dissolved, becoming closest kin. Those who meet bandits and blades who contemplate this scripture see the bandits retreat, blades kept at bay.

This scripture is the refuge of the three realms, delivering sentient beings from peril and distress, liberating them from the three evil destinies and the eight difficulties. In the midst of the five sufferings, none are endured. Its sheltering shade extends without limit; its blessings are beyond measure. Those who honor this scripture may be called the gate to the boundless.

The Most High Mysterious Unity Perfected One addressed the Immortal Duke, saying: "I have received the command of the Most High to transmit to you the *Exhortation Scripture of Wondrous Teachings*, expounding the Dharma and proclaiming the doctrine—its subtlety reaches its utmost. Its text has been kept secret in the Most High’s Purple Tenuity Palace; unless one bears the office of Immortal Duke, its text cannot be seen. Today I reveal its precepts to perfect your immortality. You should treasure and guard them in secrecy, diligently practice the Dao to achieve perfection, and you shall be welcomed into the Palace of the Great Ultimate."

The Immortal Duke bowed his head, received the precepts, and departed in reverence.
