At that time, the Most High Lord of Salvation from Suffering, moved by great compassion, sought to eradicate all karmic offenses for the multitude of sentient beings, deliver them from sinking into suffering, and thus commanded them to perform purification rites, make offerings, and widely establish merit. They were to cultivate vast fields of blessings, summoning the celestial dragons, earthly deities, the Four Brahmā Heavenly Kings, the Asura Kings, the lords of all heavens, the Prince of Yama, the Lord of Mount Tai, the Overseers of Life and Records, the Five Paths’ mighty spirits, and the wardens of the prisons. Each reverently paid homage, bowing their heads to the ground, and addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying:

"By reason of the karmic retributions endured by the sentient beings of this world, all are bound to the ledgers of sin overseen by the Great Demon King. In the lands of Jambudvīpa, those who commit the Ten Evils and Five Heinous Crimes, who disrespect their parents, violate fasts and precepts, slaughter pigs, sheep, cattle, horses, and the six livestock, as well as flying birds and running beasts—all such sinners, upon the dissolution of their bodies, descend into the Nine Dark Hells, suffering day and night without hope of liberation. Even if they amass merit through purification rites and offerings, enduring aeons of torture, beatings, and imprisonment, they shall not attain rebirth in heaven."

Then the Heavenly Worthy declared: "All you sentient beings, heed my words. When fathers, mothers, or kinfolk pass away, you should establish a Daoist sanctuary, perform purification rites, distribute alms, and cultivate merit for the Netherworld’s courts. Invoke the following lords on these days:

- **First Seven Days:** Great King Qin Guang, the Most Refined and Wondrously Vast Perfected Lord of Primordial Simplicity
- **Second Seven Days:** Great King Chu Jiang, the Perfected Lord of Hidden Virtue and Settled Rest
- **Third Seven Days:** Great King Song Di, the Perfected Lord of Penetrating Clarity and Universal Stillness
- **Fourth Seven Days:** Great King of the Five Offices, the Perfected Lord of Mysterious Virtue and Fivefold Numinosity
- **Fifth Seven Days:** Great King Yama, the Most Victorious and Radiant Perfected Lord
- **Sixth Seven Days:** Great King Bian Cheng, the Perfected Lord of Treasure Orchid and Illustrious Accomplishment
- **Seventh Seven Days:** Lord of Mount Tai, the Perfected Lord of Mysterious Virtue and Wondrous Life
- **Hundredth Day:** Great King of Equality, the Supreme and Rightly Delivering Perfected Lord
- **First Anniversary:** Great King of the Capital City, the Perfected Lord of Flying Demons and Manifested Felicity
- **Second Anniversary:** Great King of the Turning Wheel, the Perfected Lord of Fivefold Transformations and Majestic Numinosity."

Then the Heavenly Worthy declared: "All you sentient beings, when your people die and sink into hell, through this meritorious assembly, they shall all attain transcendence and natural rebirth. The hells shall be emptied, sins eradicated, and suffering and bitterness ended."

The Heavenly Worthy then commanded the Left Minister of the Yang Bureau and the Right Minister of the Yin Bureau to assess their merit. He ordered the twenty-four wardens and scribes of the Fengdu Hells to release all suffering, wandering souls and lost spirits. They were to be led into the Pool of Fire Refinement, each grasping a talisman of the Elixir Realm’s transformative power, thereby securing the causes of rebirth and returning together to the shore of the Dao.

The Heavenly Worthy said: "All you suffering sinners, through this deliverance, shall attain transcendence and rebirth. All you sentient beings, listen carefully, for I shall now recite a verse for you:

*In Fengdu’s night abyss, light suddenly shines,*
*Illuminating lost souls, who come to feast on fragrant gruel.*
*Refined by talismans and fire, their hundred bones take flight,*
*Witnessing the Dharma assembly, they know the immortal path to return.*

And again:

*An encounter rare in ten thousand kalpas, this merit is sublime.*
*To open the dark realms, rely wholly on the true wind.*
*A bridge and ferry to the other shore, boundless grace is bestowed.*
*With each thought of rebirth’s cause, they ride the radiance and soar through space.*

At that time, all those assembled, having heard the verses, were liberated. Each bowed their heads in reverence and departed.
