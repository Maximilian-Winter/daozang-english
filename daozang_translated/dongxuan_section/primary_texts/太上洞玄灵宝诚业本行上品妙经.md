The Dao spoke: In former times, upon the Jade Terrace within the Cavern of Luminous Cinnabar Heavens, I received the supreme grade of the Wheel of the Golden Perfection’s Precepts of Karmic Origins and Fundamental Practices. Thereby was I bestowed the title of Supreme Highest Cavernous Luminous Great Dharma King, ever presiding over the Great Enclosure of the Jade Clarity’s Highest Heaven, where the Flying Celestials gather.

The merit of the Wheel’s original precepts of karma unfolds the realm of the myriad existences’ birth and death, the roots of heavenly and human transgressions and blessings. It conveys the Three Vehicles, ascending to the Upper Clarity, where the Tenfold Perfected attain transcendence. Its radiance illumines the darkest nights, vast and boundless across the ten directions. It severs the roots of the ten evils, guiding all to practice the ten virtues, that they may swiftly ascend to the Heaven of Immeasurable Great Enclosure. Those who follow shall attain the Perfection of the Dao.

The Dao spoke: I ever descend with the turning of the kalpas to the Great Hall of Primordial Life and Blessing in the Flying Heavens of the ten directions, within the Cavern of Luminous Treasure Courts. There I unfold this Wheel of Dharma, the ten gates of virtue, causing all ten evils to transform by the Law. Through this Wheel’s turning, they ascend to the heavens, all attaining wondrous communion and the vast illumination of fundamental practices.

By the karmic conditions of past lives, I observe heaven and earth, yet few indeed are those who, lacking supreme virtue, can uphold this teaching.

The Dao spoke: The precepts of karma and the highest practices belong to the far-reaching virtue of the exalted. The fundamental practices of the Golden Perfection are the enduring source. When virtue aligns with right mindfulness, demons dare not speak. Sever all delusions and confusions, and the myriad heavens shall pay homage to the Perfected. As for those who generate evil, do not follow them. Their roots of sin run deep. Should they enter my Wheel of Dharma, the calamities they provoke—do not contend with them. To fall into the Three Evil Realms is to find return most arduous. Those who obstruct the Dao are shrouded in ignorance; those who envy others inflict punishment upon themselves. Those who slander others first emerge from the paths of beasts. Those who delight in lust and sensuality—from their past karma, the roots of the six domestic animals remain unsevered. The greedy and cruel harm themselves; the gluttonous swallow poison. Such are the origins of suffering—one must distance oneself from them.

The Dao spoke: When the Primordial Heavenly Worthy was to expound these precepts of karmic origins and fundamental practices, the Heavenly Worthy pointed a finger toward the ten directions of empty space, summoning the Flying Heavenly Thearchs, the Perfected Sovereigns, the Flying Heavenly Boundless Divine Kings, the Perfected of Wondrous Practices, the Supreme Jade Emperor, the Boundless Great Sage and Venerable Spirits, the Thirty-Six Heavenly Emperors, the Perfected of the Myriad Heavens, the Perfected of the Nine Palaces, the Five Elders of the Upper Perfected, the Heavenly Perfected and Earthly Immortals, the Jade Maidens of the Boundless Worlds, the Immeasurable Great Sage Assemblies, the Spiritual Officials of the Three Realms, the Enforcing Officials of the Three Primes, and their innumerable hosts. All at once, they rode the void and came, ascending to the Fourfold Radiance of the Jade Capital’s Heavenly Light, beneath the Purple Canopy that revolves the heavens. Their majestic spirits surged, streaming through the ten directions, illuminating the myriad heavens. They burned incense, scattered flowers, and circumambulated thrice in the Flying Mystery Step, then returned to their places. Bowing in reverence, they paid homage to the Perfected and together ascended the fields of the Golden Perfection’s Wheel of Dharma. Gazing upward to the Dharma’s sound, none were not filled with joy, all praising its goodness.

The Dao spoke: The supreme sincere karma of the Golden Perfection universally exalts the foundation of practice in the ten thousand enclosures. Few indeed are those who grasp the wondrous essence of Heaven’s principle—only the Upper Perfected practice it.

Yet the heavenly beings of the ten directions, dwelling in the treasuries of calamity, devise myriad schemes, releasing all manner of evil. The key lies in the heart. Establish the Daoist sanctuary, universally turn the Wheel of Dharma, illumine the Six Paths, and deliver the heavenly beings, the lonely souls, and the suffering spirits, that all may ascend to the Heaven of Blessing, ever rejoicing, enduring through kalpas, forever preserved. Henceforth, all shall be by the grace of the Wheel’s supreme grade.

At that time, the innumerable hosts of the Great Sages of the Myriad Heavens all praised its goodness, circumambulated thrice to the left, clasped their hands in reverence, and prostrated to receive the precepts.

The Heavenly Worthy addressed the assembly of heavenly sages: "I unfold the Wheel of the Golden Perfection, transforming the causes of all. Yet nothing is more difficult than the form.

The body of utmost virtue is also the domain of a single state. Profit invites calamity—it is the heart’s creation. Thus, the realm of containment and concealment is entered through the gate of good and evil. Only the Perfected are awakened, attaining the Dao through non-action. If one can follow this, receive it sincerely, and never forget—"

The Heavenly Worthy addressed the assembly of heavenly sages: "The primordial qi is subtle and insubstantial, its movement and guidance impure. Fundamental karma is easily created, yet may lead to the loss of one’s body. From the five hearts arise the ten evils, long drowning in the blades of poison—can none awaken? They suffer their own pain!

I turn the Wheel to deliver the heavenly beings of the ten directions from the sources of birth and death. When the ten virtues are fully established and one awakens to all karmic conditions of future lives, submitting to the precepts of karma, one attains the Perfection of the Dao."

The Heavenly Worthy addressed the Dao Lord: "I unfold the supreme grade of the Wheel of Dharma, the Golden Perfection’s precepts of karma, the ten virtues as the root, the gate of myriad practices. If you follow them, all must submit and listen."

Thereupon, the Dao Lord bowed with clasped hands and prostrated to receive the precept text.

The Precepts state:

**First Grade:** Right contemplation of the wondrous origin of the multitude—all attain the karma of spiritual penetration.
**Second Grade:** Right hearing of the wondrous sound—spiritual penetration knows the ten directions.
**Third Grade:** Right knowledge of the entry of fragrant light—spiritual penetration abides in the numinous qi.
**Fourth Grade:** Right sound opens the wondrous gate—spiritual penetration brings boundless fruits of benefit.
**Fifth Grade:** Right mindfulness of the precepts of Dharma and practice—spiritual penetration descends the Perfection of the Dao.
**Sixth Grade:** Right mindfulness of the suffering of sentient beings—spiritual penetration manifests radiant retribution.
**Seventh Grade:** Right contemplation of non-dual delusion—spiritual penetration enters the realm of the true Dao.
**Eighth Grade:** Right practice of the great compassionate karma—spiritual penetration attains the supreme Perfection.
**Ninth Grade:** Right stabilization of form and shadow, unmoved by the multitude of practices—spiritual penetration awakens to the wondrous.
**Tenth Grade:** Right embodiment of form and spirit, steadfast and luminous in rectitude—spiritual penetration is profoundly mysterious.

The Heavenly Worthy spoke: The Ten Right Spiritual Penetrations of the Golden Perfection’s Supreme Grade are the foremost of the ten thousand practices, the foundation of rectitude throughout the ten directions, and the root of boundless subtle penetrations. I now turn the Wheel of Dharma to expound this text, that all may transcend kalpa-disaster and the obstructions of birth and death, turning from these to ascend to eternal abiding. The Perfection of the Dao is thereby accomplished, and one shall never encounter the gates of the ten evils throughout life.

The Heavenly Worthy spoke: The Ten Grades of the Golden Perfection’s fundamental practice are the supreme merits of the highest good.

**First Grade:** Sever the causes of craving for the five colors, and right vision shall not stray into perverse gazing.
**Second Grade:** Sever the sounds of the five tones and six defilements, so that no perverse hearing arises within or without.
**Third Grade:** Sever the causes of the six contacts, and perverse qi shall not enter.
**Fourth Grade:** Sever empty chatter and false discourse, so that perverse speech and frivolous words do not arise.
**Fifth Grade:** Sever the harms of manifold calamities, so that no multitude of perversities may invade.
**Sixth Grade:** Sever the contemplation of the five aggregates, so that perverse evil does not encroach.
**Seventh Grade:** Sever actions that are improper or contrived, so that perverse disasters do not arise.
**Eighth Grade:** Sever all deluded confusions, so that no multitude of perversities may assail any being.
**Ninth Grade:** Sever aimless conduct, and perverse illnesses shall naturally dissolve.
**Tenth Grade:** Sever the karma of the ten evils, and ever hold the Dharma Wheel in mind. Then the myriad demonic and perverse spirits shall retreat of themselves, none daring to oppose you.

The Heavenly Worthy addressed the Dao Lord, saying: These are the supreme grades of the Golden Perfection’s fundamental practice. By refining the true in the clarity of emptiness and quiescence, one is called a practitioner of the supreme practice. Those who can thus abide may attain the Golden Perfection. I observe that among the hosts of heaven and humanity, not one in ten thousand—unless they be perfected beings—can follow this path.

The Heavenly Worthy spoke: Those who constantly uphold the Ten Grades of the Golden Perfection’s contemplative practice shall perfect the ten thousand virtues.

**First Grade:** Seeing the five colors without craving—licentious winds shall not arise.
**Second Grade:** Hearing the five tones without listening—demonic winds shall naturally disperse.
**Third Grade:** Encountering manifold fragrant qi without delight—the six viscera shall not be harmed, and perverse winds shall retreat of themselves.
**Fourth Grade:** Seeing the five flavors without craving sweetness or excess—no multitude of defilements shall stain the body.
**Fifth Grade:** Hearing manifold pleasures without observing them—external defilements and perverse winds shall not disturb.
**Sixth Grade:** Abiding in oneness without false imaginings—one shall remain unstained throughout life, and perverse qi shall not arise.
**Seventh Grade:** In all actions, riding the precepts and fundamental practice—all defilements shall dissolve of themselves, and one’s form and countenance shall radiate purity.
**Eighth Grade:** Seeing treasures and goods without seizing what is not rightfully obtained—myriad virtues shall come to fruition, and one shall abide in peace throughout life.
**Ninth Grade:** Harmonizing one’s nature without envy or jealousy, and not being provoked by events—myriad blessings shall descend upon the true, and numinous demons shall pay homage.
**Tenth Grade:** Abiding in tranquility and serene contemplation, cherishing compassionate thoughts for all past lives—guardians from the ten directions shall protect the body. One shall present merits on high and attain the Golden Perfection.

The Heavenly Worthy addressed the Dao Lord, saying: I now reveal the origin of the Wheel of Dharma’s precepts and fundamental practice of the Golden Perfection’s Supreme Grade. If the heavenly and human beings of the ten directions can thus abide, they shall equal the merits of the Ten Sages and enter the Dharma-realm of eternal abiding. They shall attain the Dao naturally, their lives suffused with luminosity. For kalpas unnumbered as the Ganges’ sands, they shall share in rejoicing, their blessings flowing through ten thousand generations, ever abiding with the Dharma Wheel without cessation.

The Heavenly Worthy spoke: I now turn the Wheel of Dharma in the assembly of the Ten Sages. With each grade of turning penetration:

**First Grade:** One immediately knows the weight of matters in a single direction and discerns the ranks of the sages.
**Second Grade:** One knows the existence or non-existence of auspicious and inauspicious matters in the world, and attains the rank of awakened sage.
**Third Grade:** One thoroughly understands the causes of sin and blessing, the comings and goings of all past lives, their destinations, and the fruits of karmic retribution, and attains the rank of rightly awakened sage.
**Fourth Grade:** One can perceive the minds of sentient beings with the mind, reverse-illuminating future events and the hidden matters of fortune and misfortune, and attains the rank of penetratingly awakened sage.
**Fifth Grade:** One universally knows the conditions, movements, causes, and fortunes of all inexhaustible worlds in the ten directions, and attains the rank of greatly awakened sage.
**Sixth Grade:** Through penetrating observation, one knows the abodes of all sages in the realms of the ten directions as clearly as pointing to the palm of one’s hand. One can divide form and disperse shadow without hindrance in the void, and attains the rank of wondrously awakened sage.
**Seventh Grade:** One universally knows the movements and mechanisms of heaven and earth, their existence or non-existence, far or near, all without obstruction, and attains the rank of penetratingly awakened sage.
**Eighth Grade:** Abiding in forgetfulness while standing, one’s form is like a shadow at noon. All is seen through, and one attains the rank of observantly awakened sage.
**Ninth Grade:** One universally illumines and radiates the precious light from within the body, universally illuminating the ten directions. All is universally seen, and there is nothing above or below that is not thoroughly understood. One attains the rank of universally luminous, greatly awakened sage.
**Tenth Grade:** Universally observing, universally examining, universally illuminating, universally shining—nothing is hidden or dark. One thoroughly knows heaven and earth, and the light manifests throughout the ten directions, abiding in silent profundity. One attains the rank of penetratingly luminous, greatly awakened, perfected, and supreme sage.

The practices and merits of these grades all turn through the Wheel of Dharma. The eighty penetrations of the great sages are of lofty and wondrous virtue. Without the power of the Dharma Wheel, none could attain them. The fruition of the Ten Sages arises from kalpas as numerous as the Ganges’ sands, wherein they have cultivated merit and spread virtue, filling heaven and earth and pervading the ten directions. Thus they attain their ranks and enter the merits of the Ten Sages, wondrously penetrating the Supreme Grade. If the heavenly and human beings of the ten directions can thus abide, the Perfection of the Dao is accomplished.

Then the Heavenly Worthy commanded the Supreme, Most High, Penetratingly Luminous Great Dharma King, saying: You shall recite the Jade Chapters of the Turning Ranks of the Wondrous Penetrations of the Precepts and Fundamental Practice of the Supreme Golden Perfection’s Dharma Wheel. The Supreme, Most High, Penetratingly Luminous Great Dharma King rose, made obeisance, and circumambulated the True One thrice to the left.

He recited the Jade Chapters of the Precepts and Fundamental Practice of the Dharma Wheel, saying:

In the profound quiescence, the merit of Dharma’s sincerity,
Contemplation and practice reach the Great Vehicle’s utmost.
The Golden Perfection’s manifold wondrous excellences,
Rightly ranked, are the court of all heavens.
The Dharma Wheel’s supreme virtue,
All turns to the supreme Perfection.
Beyond the six perfections, spiritual penetrations,
Are the flying immortals, the greatly blessed.
Opening and delivering the great Brahmā immortals,
The Ten Grades all attain the Perfection.
Majestic is the natural Dao,
Carefree in the Great Radiant Heaven.
Through kalpas as the Ganges’ sands,
All conditions are observed.
Without the supreme-grade practice,
How could the roots of suffering be eradicated?

The Jade Chapters of the Supreme-Grade Fundamental Practice of the Dharma Wheel say:

In penetrating contemplation of the Ten Fundamental Sources, luminous and clear, they congeal into the Real.
Severing the realms of the Ten Evils, one’s conduct enters the Dharma Wheel.
Inner and outer fragrance and radiance arise,
Swiftly ascending to the Golden Perfection.
Once risen to the Cloud-Luminous Palace,
Majestic radiance illumines all heavens.
All proceeds from the Fundamental Practice.
Bowing in reverence, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy.

The Jade Chapters on Contemplation and Practice of the Dharma Wheel say:
Gazing upward at the Golden Perfection’s conduct,
Its surpassing splendor is free of all dust.
Its form and bearing bear the Seven Treasures’ marks,
Cloud-luminous, illuminating all heavens.
Soaring in the Great Vehicle’s realm,
Flying immortals turn the Dharma Wheel.
Myriad blessings unite in one celebration,
Turning to deliver those in the Ten Sufferings.
The body ascends above the Jade Pool,
Bathing and refining to become an immortal.
In the Ten Directions, no lonely souls remain,
Universally opening the Ganges’ sands of grace.
Wondrously penetrating the Perfection’s virtue,
They bow their heads before the Heavenly Treasure.

The Jade Chapters on the Dharma Wheel’s Turning and Penetrating the Ten Sagely Luminous Realms say:
The Supreme unfolds wondrous transformation,
Its merit in motion, all dawn in unison.
The Dharma Wheel’s Ten Grades’ realms,
The Great Canopy’s manifold Dharma gates.
Collectively called the Great Radiance Grade,
The Ten Sages and Highest Perfected.
Wondrous virtue turns the Ten Penetrations,
Serene are the Ten Flying Immortals.
Peaceful and joyful, unending bliss,
Universally illuminating past karmic conditions.
Life harmonizes with eternal longevity,
Luminous awakening responds to the natural.
Subtle and peerless, none can compare,
In the six periods, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy.

The Heavenly Worthy addressed the Dao Lord, saying:
These four Jade Chapters are the foremost of the Supreme Golden Perfection’s precepts and karma, the source of the Dharma Wheel’s turning and wondrous awakening’s Fundamental Practice. This text is sealed within the Supreme Jade Capital’s Flowing Luminosity Palace, guarded and cherished by the Golden Perfection’s Primordial Lady. The Golden Spirit Youths and eight thousand four hundred Perfected constantly recite its chapters, their voices resounding through the Ten Directions, echoing brightly through all heavens. The host of Perfected join hands in praise, the Utmost Perfected pay homage, and the Highest then opens the Supreme Grade of the Dharma Wheel, turning to deliver the multitudes of great sagely beings in the Ten Directions who have attained the Dao, thereby ascending to the Supreme Golden Perfection.

If any among heaven and humankind know these chapters, receive and uphold them with devotion, observe purification rites, and reverently recite this sacred text, their numinous tones will ascend to penetrate the Ten Directions. The Nine Heavens rejoice, the Highest praise and extol, immediately opening the grades of the Dharma Wheel to turn and deliver such persons, enabling them to ascend to the Supreme Perfected’s manifold realms. This Dao is lofty and wondrous; unless the Great Radiance unfolds to pervade the Ten Directions, none could hear of it.

The Heavenly Worthy said: I open the Dharma Wheel’s Ten Virtues’ manifold realms. The first grade is compassion and filial piety toward all beings, with all conduct harmonized in one mind. The second grade is cherishing and caring for all sentient beings as one’s own self. The third grade is faithfully turning toward the scriptural precepts, the source from which transgressions and blessings arise. The fourth grade is being able to relinquish treasures and wealth, bestowing alms upon the immeasurable multitudes of the destitute and suffering in the world. The fifth grade is being able to extensively establish merit and virtue, constructing Daoist sanctuaries, thereby creating blessings for ten thousand generations. The sixth grade is being able to uphold goodness unto death, enduring humiliation, refraining from killing and stealing. The seventh grade is being able to rescue and relieve all in dire distress, preserving the lives of immeasurable sentient beings, releasing and liberating without end, all thereby preserving their fundamental lives. The eighth grade is being able to make offerings to the Three Treasures, morning and evening paying homage and reciting scriptures, upholding precepts and observing purification, ever without weariness. The ninth grade is constantly being able to transform and enlighten heaven and humankind, cherishing and caring for the sovereign, ensuring the longevity of their reign, perpetually using wealth and resources to benefit the poor, orphaned, elderly, and immeasurable suffering beings, ever without greed or stinginess. The tenth grade is conduct that is perpetually thus, neither advancing nor retreating, single-mindedly practicing goodness.

If any among heaven and humankind can be thus, they may be called the merit of the Ten Virtues, the foundation of the myriad practices’ united celebration. These are all the source of the Ten Directions’ Flying Immortals’ boundless Utmost Perfected Sovereigns’ supreme precepts and Fundamental Practice. If any among heaven and humankind can follow them, they will thereby equal the merit of the Ten Directions’ Flying Immortals’ boundless Utmost Perfected.

The Jade Chapters on the Supreme Flying Immortals’ Dharma Wheel Turning the Ten Virtues’ Wondrous Penetration say:
The Flowing Luminosity’s Great Model Grade,
Opens the Dao’s immeasurable merit.
Turning to deliver the Ten Virtues’ conduct,
Brahmā’s splendor, the Flying Immortals’ hall.
Carefree in the Seven Treasures’ palace,
Gazing upward at the Dharma Wheel’s King.
Numinous countenance surpassingly wondrous,
Constantly descending to the Ten Dao Realms.
In unison, they ride the Three Treasures’ vehicle,
Conveying all heaven and humankind.
Swiftly, cloud radiance arises,
All forms bearing golden countenances.
All proceeds from this blessing,
Receiving the rank of Highest Perfected.
Roaming and resting on the Heavenly Treasure Terrace,
Celebrating this kalpic cycle’s return.
Thrice circling, they pay homage to the Dao’s Master,
Bowing their heads in reverence to the Heavenly Worthy.

The Heavenly Worthy addressed the Dao Lord, saying: This Jade Chapter is one of the Ten Directions’ Supreme Golden Radiance Youths, each with ten Perfected, stationed within the Flying Immortals’ Dharma Wheel’s Heavenly Treasure Palace, guarding and cherishing the sacred text. They constantly follow the Dharma Wheel’s Ten Virtues’ grades, turning the Dharma Wheel, reciting its chapters to deliver the Ten Directions’ heavens’ multitudes of practitioners of immeasurable goodness. Urging them to ride the Three Vehicles’ treasure conveyance, they chant and recite its tones, the host of Perfected joining in praise, their voices shaking the Ten Directions. All heavens perform rites, none without reverent hearts, opening the ford to the Three Realms. The Three Perfected welcome them with incense, flowers, music, and dance, escorting the virtuous directly to ascend to the Dharma Wheel’s manifold realms.

The Heavenly Worthy addressed the Dao Lord, saying: I open the Supreme Grade of the Dharma Wheel’s Ten Virtues, universally enabling all heaven and humankind in the Ten Directions to abandon the Ten Evils’ manifold realms. If any practice these Ten Evils, you must not follow their conduct. Among them, those who proclaim joy and happiness, you should avoid their words. If any seek to harm you, you need only single-mindedly contemplate the precepts and karma, preserving the Real while enduring their killing. In principle, they will be unable to harm your body, thereby transforming into the Supreme Utmost Perfected. Such persons will naturally receive the karmic retribution of killing. If any sagely and worthy beings emerge, you should seek them out, drawing near to their numinous countenance, thereby perpetually receiving their power for ten thousand kalpas.

The principle is most subtle, thus the Ten Blessings’ Hall of the Upper Heavens is set against the Ten Evils’ realms below.

The Heavenly Worthy said: The Dharma Wheel opens to deliver the Ten Evils’ manifold realms. The first grade is failing to practice the Dao of compassion and filial piety, lacking propriety between high and low, perpetually without harmonious and compliant hearts toward one another. The second grade is failing to practice cherishing and caring for sentient beings, perpetually harboring malevolence. The third grade is lacking faith and devotion, following the impulses of their emotions, committing manifold evil deeds, rebelling against the sovereign.

The fourth grade is failing to practice love of goodness, refusing to relinquish or bestow, constantly damaging others’ possessions, claiming satisfaction for themselves, devoid of all compassion. The fifth grade is lacking the mind to establish merit and virtue, delighting only in creating misfortune and calamity. The sixth grade is failing to practice forbearance, constantly deceiving and lying to others, utterly devoid of trustworthiness in myriad ways. The seventh grade is lacking the mind to rescue and relieve those in dire straits, perpetually harboring obstinate attachments, constantly wishing others to fall into evil destinies. The eighth grade is lacking the mind of reverence for scriptures and precepts, constantly slandering and defaming the Heavenly Perfected, entering into heterodox doctrines, harming living beings through sacrifices. The ninth grade is lacking the mind of benefiting others, constantly using wealth and profit to exploit the poor, the orphaned, and the elderly, selfishly enriching their own bodies. The tenth grade is constantly killing and harming boundless sentient beings, indulging in unbridled lust, amassing every evil, wavering in advance and retreat, perpetually acting thus—these may be called the Ten Evils.

Such actions are neither of Heaven nor of Earth, but arise solely from the mind. Those of supreme virtue and perfected persons take the Ten Goodnesses as their merit, constantly making their own minds the flying heavens’ Hall of Blessings for the ten directions, directly entering the Dharma Wheel as their causal condition. They uphold and maintain sincere deeds, tracing back to the subtlety of their original conduct, thereby attaining the virtue of the fruit-report of the Upper Perfected. Thus, they do not undergo the Ten Sufferings, do not enter the Eight Difficulties, do not encounter afflictions, and do not tread the Three Wretched Paths.

As for the inferior persons of the lower realms, they constantly make their own minds the office of execution and slaughter, directly seeking the cyclic retributions of hell, turning their backs on the Ten Goodnesses and facing the Ten Evils, practicing the Ten Sufferings. They cast their own bodies into the Eight Difficulties, proceeding to grasp the roots of affliction, their forms treading the gates of the Three Wretched Paths. Daily they sink and drown, enduring eons of endless suffering in the mire and ashes, ever more distant from blessings.

I now open the Dharma Wheel to universally deliver all people.

The Jade Chapter Hymn of the Supreme Flying Heaven’s Dharma Wheel, Turning the Ten Evils into the Wondrous and Penetrating Upper Grade, proclaims:

Lush and resplendent, Jade Clarity,
Supremely Non-Being, naturally so,
Shading and reflecting the ten directions,
Opening the ford of the Dharma Wheel,
Delivering from the Eight Difficulties,
Turning all blessed heavens,
Radiant light as crown and sash,
Dissolving the stagnant roots of the womb,
Accumulated corpses undergo refinement,
Evil extinguished, the Perfected attained,
The Jade Emperor commands and summons,
The Ten Goodnesses all restored,
All heavens rejoice,
The Five Elders attend the dawn,
The Thearch holds the tally,
Together they escort before the Dao,
The great park of the Flying Heavens,
Boundlessly delivering people,
Kalpa after kalpa receiving transformation,
Conveying the Three Vehicles,
The Dharma King’s ranked positions,
Supreme and Perfected,
The Three Primes eliminate evil,
The Nine Nights shine brightly,
Binding the body with heavenly treasures,
Form ascends to eternal abiding,
Wondrous virtue, lofty and supreme,
Penetrating and illuminating the Golden Perfected.

The Heavenly Worthy addressed the Dao Lord, saying: This Jade Chapter is enshrined in the right palace of the Flying Heaven’s Dharma Wheel. In each of the ten directions, ten jade lads and ten jade maidens, each a true guardian, receive the numinous text, constantly accompanying the Dharma Wheel’s upper grade as it turns the realms of the Ten Evils, transporting and delivering the suffering souls of heaven-dwellers and mortals in the cycle of birth and death, ensuring that kalpa after kalpa they undergo transformation, ever in affinity with the Dharma Wheel.

If heaven-dwellers and mortals know this chapter and perform purification rites, burn incense, and reverently recite it, the Dharma King will descend in truth, and their attainment of the Dao will not be long in coming.

The Heavenly Worthy addressed the Dao Lord, saying: I open the Dharma Wheel to turn the realms of the Ten Evils. The blessings of the upper grade are boundless in merit. To still the mind and extinguish thoughts—this is the virtue of the highest. To hear music and not hear it, to see floating splendor and beautiful forms—these are the roots of the Ten Evils. The form is not eternally possessed, wealth does not eternally remain; the Dao and the Perfected are supreme. Thus, I open the Dharma Wheel.

In the world, those who seek the true and abandon the mundane through causal conditions must preserve and secure their original qi, congealing their pure and natural essence. When demons come to oppose, guard your mouth and do not speak, lest evil arise and delusion begin. In the end, they will enter the Dharma Wheel. Those who obstruct the Dao suffer; in later lives, it will be the same.

The Heavenly Worthy said: The Dharma Wheel opens to deliver the realms of the Ten Sufferings. The first grade is treading the suffering of the Mountain of Knives. The second grade is ascending the suffering of the Tree of Swords. The third grade is entering the suffering of the Cauldron of Boiling Water. The fourth grade is embracing the suffering of the Bronze Pillar. The fifth grade is lying on the suffering of the Iron Bed. The sixth grade is the suffering of the Fire Cart carrying one into the Frigid Pool. The seventh grade is the suffering of having one’s head restrained and tongue pulled out. The eighth grade is the suffering of swallowing fire and eating coals. The ninth grade is the suffering of the Three Officials’ shackles and fetters, penal servitude, and the torment of the golden hammer and iron staff. The tenth grade is the suffering of being shackled in life, afflictions of form and killing.

In these ten directions, such Ten Sufferings all arise from the causes accumulated in former lives. I observe these sufferings—words cannot describe their misery in the mire and ashes. Thus, I open the Dharma Wheel to universally deliver all heavens, bringing joy to the ten directions, pardoning and absolving them. The Six Paths shine brightly, the Dharma Bridge’s path is open, all rejoice together, and the Dao and the Perfected descend.

The Jade Chapter Hymn of the Supreme Flying Heaven’s Dharma Wheel, Turning and Delivering the Ten Sufferings, proclaims:

Surveying the ten directions,
Boundless roots of sin,
Dragged through the Ten Sufferings,
Bodies scorched and rotting,
Great and small entangled,
Eons in the mire and ashes,
Toxic blades wound the body,
Sinking into the Nine Nights,
Longing to return is most difficult,
Only then do they think of the Ten Goodnesses,
Reflecting on these causal conditions,
Grasping the pain and urgency,
Wind and blade come and go,
Swallowing darkness, consuming poison,
Hun and spirit have no respite,
Gazing upward to the Supreme,
The Flying Heaven’s Dharma Wheel,
Opening to deliver the upper grade,
Turning all to ascend and be promoted,
Adorning the body in the Jade Court,
Wondrously penetrating the Ten Heavens,
The boundless worlds,
Penetrating and recognizing all conditions,
Cultivating sincere deeds,
Bowing in reverence before the Dao.

The Heavenly Worthy addressed the Dao Lord, saying: This Jade Chapter is enshrined in the central palace of the Flying Heaven’s Dharma Wheel. In each of the ten directions, ten cinnabar-spirit lads, each a true guardian, receive the numinous text, constantly accompanying the Dharma Wheel’s upper grade as it turns and delivers the realms of the Ten Sufferings, opening the path to deliver heaven-dwellers and mortals from birth and death, all attaining affinity with the Dharma. If heaven-dwellers and mortals recite this chapter, it ascends to be heard in the Nine Heavens, and the Dharma King commands the Perfected to come and deliver them.

The Heavenly Worthy addressed the Dao Lord, saying: I open the Dharma Wheel to turn the realms of the Eight Difficulties. The merit of the upper grade encompasses boundless Dharma gates. When a person’s mind is pure, the Ten Goodnesses descend. When one gives rise to the evil of covetous karma, the mind toward things is impure. If others harbor evil, you should make them good. The Three Primes’ enforcers of the law are close at hand within your own body. Secret transgressions are all recorded, reported above to the heavens. The investigating officials swiftly arrive, and one is afflicted with illness and harm.

Should one practice the superior scripture, goodness will naturally follow—let no perverted views be heard, for without affinity, the true form and spirit remain intact. Morning and evening, with reverent heart, the Perfected of the Dao descend to deliver you to the heavens of blessings.

The Heavenly Worthy said: The Dharma Wheel opens to deliver the realms of the Eight Difficulties. The first grade is reborn beyond the frontier barbarians; the second grade is reborn as a slave or servant; the third grade is reborn as a destitute, lonely, and lowly person; the fourth grade is reborn with the six chronic illnesses; the fifth grade is reborn with foolishness and incomplete faculties; the sixth grade is reborn in shackles, afflicted by the toils of karmic bondage; the seventh grade is reborn into a life of unfilial impiety or bereavement; the eighth grade is reborn in a lawless kingdom. These Eight Difficulties all arise from past deeds and emerge from the Ten Sufferings, only to be reborn within the Eight Difficulties.

Yet those of supreme virtue and perfected persons constantly cultivate the Ten Goodnesses in preparation for the future, to be reborn in the boundless halls of blessings across the ten directions. Those who cling to deluded and perverted views invariably take the Ten Evils as their foundation, thus forsaking the Ten Goodnesses. They cycle through birth and death, enduring eons of suffering, forever reborn into the Eight Difficulties to receive their retribution. I now open the Dharma Wheel to deliver such beings.

The *Jade Chapter Hymn of the Supreme Flying Heaven Dharma Wheel* for the upper grade of the Eight Difficulties proclaims:

Behold the Eight Gates, the Wheel turning the field of sins,
Receiving all sufferings, where form and soul find no respite.
Without prior deeds of sincerity, one’s life ends in the Eight Difficulties,
Countless gates of transgression, cycling through birth and death.
The Ten Evils return again, plunging into darkness,
Receiving endless sinking and drowning.
Yet the Great Amnesty of the Flying Heaven universally turns the Dharma Wheel,
The lofty Eight Visions open the Jade City,
Palaces of the Seven Treasures, borne on chariots to welcome,
Clouds of radiance illuminating the great courts of the ten directions.
A golden countenance of unmatched beauty, twin lights spontaneously arising,
Urging dragons and riding phoenixes, they roam the Jade Capital.
Jeweled forests arrayed, light shining from within the body,
The Three Fetters dissolve, the Eight Difficulties simultaneously resolved.

The Heavenly Worthy addressed the Dao Lord, saying: This Jade Chapter is enshrined upon the right Mystery Terrace of the Flying Heaven Dharma Wheel. The Jade Lads and Jade Maidens of the ten directions, each bearing the *Ten Perfected Treasured Writ of Reward*, constantly follow the upper-grade Dharma Wheel, reciting this chapter to turn and deliver the realms of the Eight Difficulties, gladdening the souls of heaven-dwellers and mortals in the cycle of birth and death, that all may attain radiance and universally perceive the affinity of the Dharma.

If heaven-dwellers and mortals know this chapter and recite it with sincerity, they will deliver both the living and the dead from lingering suffering. The heavens will descend, and the destinies of their lives and deaths will be transferred to the halls of eternal blessings.

The Heavenly Worthy addressed the Dao Lord, saying: I open the Dharma Wheel to turn the realms of the Three Evil Paths. The blessings of the upper grade are boundless, and all beings are enabled to be delivered to the halls of blessings across the ten directions, transforming to be reborn in heaven. These profound evils arise from past lives, where countless beings were harmed, leading to rebirth in those paths as retribution for former causes. Cycling through birth and death, the karmic consequences of their deeds now turn all bodies to universally enter the roots of goodness. Through self-awakening, they are reborn, and all karmic conditions of birth and death receive grace, none failing to rejoice.

The Heavenly Worthy said: The Dharma Wheel opens to deliver the realms of the Three Evil Paths. The first grade is the hells of dark confinement and scorching torment; the second grade is the hungry ghosts who devour one another in the suffering of affliction; the third grade is the beasts who strike one another in mutual enmity and poison. Such beings, if they reverse their ways, are reborn into the Three Evil Paths: the first grade as insects, the second as crows, and the third as beasts. The deeds of their past lives were fundamentally rebellious, their sins heavy, thus incurring such evils. Gathering over eons, they receive this retribution. I now open the boundless Dharma Wheel of the upper grade to universally deliver these evils and return them to the gates of blessings.

The *Jade Chapter Hymn of the Supreme Flying Heaven Dharma Wheel* for the upper grade of the Three Evil Paths proclaims:

Surveying the ten directions within,
The boundless worlds of men—
The powerful and noble fear no transgression,
Indulging in the slaughter of beings.
They raise armies to rebel against rulers,
Heedless of future retribution.
When sins fill the Nine Rivers,
Their forms tread the courts of Knife Mountain.
Hands brushing the Sword Trees,
Blood flows like falling stars.
Seated to await boiling in cauldrons,
Iron awls piercing their bodies.
Turning, they enter the realm of hungry ghosts,
Hearing only wails of sorrow.
Heads raised to see the iron net,
Feet standing in the courtyard of flowing fire.
Beasts tearing at one another,
Retribution for past lives.
Yet behold the Ten Blessed Heavens,
Riding the light, bearing the full moon.
Roaming beyond the Three Realms,
Only then do they recall the scriptures of the Three Treasures.
The Dharma King’s myriad good deeds
Universally open boundless merit.
Turning to deliver the Three Evil Paths,
They undergo refinement as the Ten Heavenly Immortals.
Bodies emitting five-colored light,
Awakening to the wondrous causes of all evils.
In one leap, they transcend the Three Paths,
Dwelling leisurely in the Ten Flying Heavens.

The Heavenly Worthy addressed the Dao Lord, saying: This Jade Chapter is enshrined within the Jade City of the upper-grade Flying Heaven Dharma Wheel. The Jade Lads and Jade Maidens of the Dharma Wheels of the ten directions, each bearing the *Ten Perfected Treasured Writ of Reward*, constantly follow the supreme upper-grade Dharma Wheel, reciting this chapter to turn and deliver the realms of the Three Evil Paths of suffering, refining the stagnant corpses and suffering bones, that all may attain radiance and universally ascend to the halls of blessings in the Ten Heavens. If heaven-dwellers and mortals know this chapter and recite it with sincerity on the day their lives end, their souls will not pass through the Three Evil Paths but will directly ascend to the Dharma Wheel of the ten directions, entering its ranks.

The Heavenly Worthy addressed the Dao Lord, saying: I open the Dharma Wheel to turn the realms of the Ten Deviant and Unorthodox Paths, the practices of the upper grade. Beings, insatiable in their myriad desires, cast their bodies and lives into the Ten Evils, entangling their forms in suffering and self-inflicting the punishments of their transgressions. Their offenses fill heaven and earth, their names and forms becoming paths, falsely generating unrighteousness, licentiousness, and deviant qi. Born without virtuous teachings, they inevitably face severe judgment in death, their bodies enduring eons of dismemberment, cycling through birth and death, forever dwelling in blind paths. Their lives end in perverse speech, illness, and suffering, ultimately returning to the Eight Gates. I now open the Dharma gates to universally turn them back to the Perfected of the Dao.

The Heavenly Worthy spoke: When the Dharma Wheel opens to deliver the beings in the realms of the Ten Deviant and Evil Paths, those of the first grade turn their backs on the true and enter the ghostly path, their entire lives born into perverse demonic influences, forever afflicted by manifold illnesses and sufferings, receiving retribution without end. Those of the second grade lightly defile the Dao and its Dharma, entering deviant paths, believing and following perverse speech, slandering the Dao and deceiving their masters. Those of the third grade do not believe in the true Dao, casting aside their bodies to become ghostly specters. Those of the fourth grade, deluded by ignorance and inverted views, beings constantly harbor the Five Turbidities, clinging to demonic influences, falsely claiming sacred names to disrupt the true Dao. Those of the fifth grade constantly engage in killing and harming, offering licentious sacrifices to ghosts and demons, fraudulently claiming to be divine and true, gluttonously craving rich flavors, committing boundless transgressions. Those of the sixth grade exploit others’ fortunes and misfortunes, falsely claiming to be true deities, making demands of heavenly and mortal beings, insatiably receiving and devouring without restraint. Those of the seventh grade, demonically possessed beings roaming the world, sometimes singing perverse songs or speaking ghostly tongues, falsely claiming to be Dao deities, lying in wait for others’ misfortunes to recklessly speak of divination and omens. Those of the eighth grade, beings who encounter the Dharma yet cling to deviant views, wholeheartedly turn their backs on the true to embrace the false, serving the forms and images of ghosts and spirits, following the ways of shamans and sorcerers. Those of the ninth grade engage in licentious acts with clan kin, harboring perverse and suffering thoughts, practicing unorthodox Dharma. Those of the tenth grade abandon the true Dharma, entering demonic paths and deviant ways, colluding to deceive and lure heavenly and mortal beings, falsely claiming to be sages and saints, indulging in lawless debauchery, concealing their perverse and rebellious acts, cursing and swearing at others, casting hexes and praying to harm kings, pointing to heaven and drawing on earth, killing and harming beings, making no distinction between true and false, yet claiming to be heavenly and true. Such beings bring upon themselves the Ten Sufferings and Eight Calamities, accumulating causes for evil, born amidst afflictions, mired in the Nine Dark Realms, enduring punishments without end.

I now open the boundless mercy of the Flying Heaven, universally liberating all karmic causes of birth and death, enabling all to escape the roots of the Ten Deviant and Evil Paths, universally ascending the Ten Directions, eternally abiding in the Heaven of Blessings, their bodies receiving majestic radiance, forever transcending the Dharma Wheel.

The Jade Hymn of the Supreme Flying Heaven Dharma Wheel Turning the Ten Deviant and Evil Paths, Upper Grade, proclaims:

Vast and distant, the Flying Heaven’s hall,
Resplendent and radiant, illuminating the Supreme Clarity.
The King of Scenery descends in a precious chariot,
Guiding the ten Dharma realms.
Yet all see the deviant paths,
Plunging into hell’s abyss.
Molten bronze poured into mouths,
Naked bodies upon sword-tree peaks.
Giant heavenly flying blades sever,
Iron awls pierce hearts and livers.
Hungry, they feast on flowing fire’s essence,
Bearing stones, they tread upon knife mountains.
No sight of blessed joy,
Only the cries of torment and filth.
Gazing upward at the Ten True Paths,
Their forms radiant with perfect clarity.
Seated serenely within jeweled groves,
Wondrous marks naturally arise.
On high, the Dharma Wheel turns,
Universally delivering all deviant forms.
Opening the ford of the Five Paths’ realms,
Transcending to the Southern Mound’s court.
Their bodies refine in the Jade Pool,
Precious radiance born within.
Soaring through the Great Void,
Thrice circling to venerate the true scriptures.

The Heavenly Worthy addressed the Dao Lord: This Jade Hymn is enshrined in the Flying Heaven’s Cloud Radiance Upper Palace of the Ten Directions. Ten Perfected Youths and Jade Maidens of each direction guard and reward the numinous text, constantly following the Dharma Wheel’s turning to recite this hymn, delivering the beings in the realms of the Ten Deviant Paths, thereby dissolving the accumulated sufferings of heavenly and mortal beings, universally guiding them into the Dharma gates. If heavenly and mortal beings know this hymn, contemplating the sufferings of life and death, fasting and reciting it, their suffering souls shall immediately transcend to the divine realms of the Ten Directions.

The Heavenly Worthy addressed the Dao Lord: I now open the Dharma Wheel of the Ten True Paths’ realms, the foremost of the upper grade’s fundamental practices. Though the profound is made manifest, it is by the power of karma. Yet to clarify the true is exceedingly difficult; beings do not purely receive the teachings, and those who concentrate their essence to attain the mysterious symbols of the supreme Dao are rare. Those who harmonize with the Dao and respond to the true—its principle is subtle and refined, verily called natural. Once in ninety thousand kalpas it descends; ponder this deeply. I now open the true treasure, turning the Dharma Wheel, so that kalpic disasters remain unmoved and heaven and earth endure.

The Heavenly Worthy spoke: When the Dharma Wheel opens the realms of the Ten True Paths, those of the first grade distance themselves from evil and depart from deviant ways, observing and practicing non-action, establishing blessed causes, maintaining a luminous and resolute mind, refraining from hidden malice. Those of the second grade seek the true and pursue the Dao, believing in and turning toward the great scriptures, upholding precepts and entering the Dharma, universally practicing hidden virtues. Those of the third grade are neither deviant nor false, constantly practicing the true Dharma, wholeheartedly guarding the Dao. Those of the fourth grade cherish and care for all beings, constantly attaining peace and abiding together within the Dharma Wheel. Those of the fifth grade compassionately regard the myriad things, revering the king, universally flourishing the heavens, broadly propagating the Three Treasures. Those of the sixth grade cultivate and study the supreme Dao, relinquishing the body and abandoning the world, utterly without false thoughts or stagnant delusions. Those of the seventh grade arise and act in accordance with precepts, their words devoid of falsehood. Those of the eighth grade guide heavenly and mortal beings, flowing and spreading the Dharma’s sound, broadly proclaiming the Dao’s teachings, infinitely expanding them. Those of the ninth grade universally rectify the myriad models, broadly propagating the Ten Directions, compassionately benefiting all. Those of the tenth grade, as the Dharma Wheel opens and expands, universally deliver heavenly and mortal beings, all rejoicing together, entering the true path, their minds resolute and luminous.

Such are the upper grades of the Ten True Paths, which only those of the highest virtue and utmost personhood can practice. I now open the boundless Dharma gates of the Ten Directions, universally and impartially delivering all. Once entering the true path, deviance daily recedes, the supreme truth of the Dao unmatched. Those who form affinities with the Dharma, thus it is.

The Jade Hymn of the Supreme Flying Heaven Dharma Wheel Opening the Ten True Paths, Upper Grade, proclaims:

Within the purple void’s surging mist,
There stands a mysterious terrace.
Flowing radiance and jade towers,
Seven treasures naturally arise.
Resplendent and radiant in the Ten Directions,
Pervading and covering all heavens.
The supreme Dharma Wheel,
Turns to deliver the Ten Directions.
The true path clearly opens,
The Primordial Sovereign’s mandate aligns.
The Flying Heaven’s perfected,
Float in the void, extolling goodness.
Jade Thearchs attend their forms,
Golden youths to left and right.
Surveying all conditions,
The great workings of mysterious transformation,
All equal before the true Dao.

The Heavenly Worthy addressed the Dao Lord: This Jade Hymn is enshrined in the Supreme Golden Perfection Mysterious Palace. Ten Golden Youths and Mystic Maidens of each direction guard and reward the numinous text, constantly following the great turning of the Ten Directions’ true Dharma Wheel, reciting this hymn, its sound pervading the Ten Directions. The Primordial Sovereign of the Nine Heavens clasps hands in celebration, the Supreme Jade Thearch bows in reverence. Thus is the Great Radiance Dharma Gate, delivering all heavens, the boundless worlds, and the myriad multitudes of all beings, enabling all to ascend the Blessed Hall of the Ten True Paths, universally harmonizing with the true Dao.

The great sages and perfected beings of all heavens who know this hymn, perform purification rites and recite it, may all deliver beings from manifold sufferings, and also preserve the kalpa from disruption, firmly securing their numinous root.

The Heavenly Worthy addressed the Dao Lord: In my turning of the Dharma Wheel through ten revolutions across all realms, the supreme and boundless foundation of the perfected beings’ original karma cannot be set in motion without the Dharma Wheel. Those who preserve truth and uphold the Dao, awaiting this assembly—from the beginning of this kalpa to the present—all who attain the Dao enter the Dharma Gate, cultivate and study the highest virtue, and ascend to the rank of the utmost perfected. Never have I seen one who, clinging to ease and arrogantly guarding wealth, yet hopes to be reborn in heaven.

I observe that beings throughout the Ten Directions are deeply entangled in attachments. Though wealth and treasures are esteemed, they ultimately cannot enable one to attain the Dao. Hoarding precious treasures will surely bring lingering misfortune, while embracing poverty and delighting in the Dao—this is the true treasure. On the day the Dao is accomplished, the Lord of the Dao will manifest signs.

Clad in a nine-rayed treasure mantle and a seven-hued flying silk skirt, wearing a Heaven-piercing treasure crown upon the head and jade-embroidered lion slippers upon the feet, with twin flames of celestial light upon the neck, a canopy of flowing luminous treasure above, ascending a seven-jeweled palanquin, riding a golden dragon—thus do they transcend the supreme Dao realms. Resplendent in feathered regalia, their majestic radiance and fragrant adornments pervade the void. With heavenly perfected ones to left and right, they grasp the Ten Absolute Spirit Banners. All heavens offer up spontaneous celestial music, burning incense and scattering flowers, suffusing the Ten Directions. The host of perfected beings descends to welcome the signs, receiving the rank of Heavenly Treasure in the Jade Clarity Realm, eternally abiding in Golden Perfection.

At that time, true joy is theirs. Such persons are those who embraced poverty and upheld the Dao, thereby attaining this state. How could the fleeting glory of worldly prosperity be worth coveting?

Those who serve the ten evils shall see their wealth scatter—even vast fortunes of hundreds of millions become but a gateway to poison.

I now turn the Wheel of the Dharma, proclaiming to the ten directions. Flying immortals and perfected beings open the path to salvation across the ten directions, in boundless worlds, for all sentient beings, that they may perfect the merit of the Tenfold Cyclic Fast and attain the rank of True Persons of the Tenth Transformation.

The Heavenly Worthy declares: When the Wheel of the Dharma opens the realms of the Tenfold Cyclic Perfected, those who receive and uphold the precepts in the first rank become Earth Immortals. Those who cultivate the precepts and practices, advancing to the second rank, become Wandering Immortals. Those who double their resolve and rectify their minds, advancing to the third rank, become Immortals. Those who uphold the precepts and their karmic duties, advancing to the fourth rank, become Flying Immortals. Those who constantly follow the scriptures and precepts, transgressing no conduct, advancing to the fifth rank, become Spirit Immortals. Those who abstain from gluttony, maintain perpetual fasting, and steadfastly uphold the precepts, advancing to the sixth rank, become Divine Immortals. Those who renounce sensual desire, practice equanimity in all meritorious deeds, and embrace purity with an unclinging heart, advancing to the seventh rank, become True Immortals. Those who set their minds on broadly contemplating the ten directions, constantly aiding those in distress, speak no wrongful words, and relieve beings without partiality, advancing to the eighth rank, become Flying Heavenly True Persons. Those who guard the One without wavering, perform myriad good deeds, revere the precepts as if facing the gods, advancing to the ninth rank, become Supreme True Persons. Those who perpetually consume the radiance and drink the qi, endure austerities in Daoist cultivation, recite scriptures and burn incense, enlighten the ten directions, universally save boundless beings, and bestow blessings upon heaven and earth without weariness, advancing to the tenth rank, become Supreme Shangqing True Persons.

All things are inherently without intent; those who practice the Eight Precepts may yet achieve the merit of the flying immortals of the ten directions—how much more so those who uphold the Ten Precepts and their fundamental practices! Yet in this final kalpa, beings only break the precepts; who among them can truly cultivate? Mortals, steeped in the Five Turbidities, commit countless coarse deeds. When they receive and uphold the precepts, they treat them as lifelong treasures, while the coarse-minded seize them in hopes of worldly exaltation. They destroy the practice of the Ten Good Deeds, turning instead to the path of the Ten Evils. It is not the Dao that fails humanity, but humanity that fails the Dao. Never has one with true intent sought and not attained.

The *Jade Hymn of the Supreme Golden Perfection Wheel of the Tenfold Cyclic Upper Rank* proclaims:

The Great Garden unfolds transformation,
Above lies a jeweled city,
Governed by the Mysterious Void,
Illumined by the Primal Unity.
Jade trees of the eight directions,
Seven treasures arrayed in birth,
Spirit winds attune to the seasons,
All sounds harmonize in voice.
Within stands the Wheel of the Dharma,
Called the Dharma King,
Cherished by the Most High,
Exalted by the Jade Emperor.
Golden Perfection’s wondrous virtue
Descends with the flying immortals,
Surveying the ten directions,
Countless karmic causes of sin.
Transforming the upper ranks,
Delivering from all苦缘,
The body escapes the ten evils,
Enters the Dharma gate,
The form eludes the blade’s edge,
Joyfully attains True Immortality.
Tenfold cyclic, supreme,
Wondrously penetrating the natural,
In the realms of the Perfected,
Eternally abiding in the Dao’s truth.

The *Jade Hymn of the Supreme Golden Perfection Precepts and Practices, Surveying the Ten Directions and Penetrating the Mysteries* proclaims:

Roaming the heavens,
Within lie the Three Nets,
Iron webs in eightfold array,
Flaming chariots and flying blades,
Scourging whips and lashes,
Myriad pains conjoined.
Heads split asunder,
Woe! Self-inflicted wounds.
One birth, one death,
Revolving in evil realms,
Tears and blood flowing,
No longer human in form.
Mired in suffering for kalpas,
Unknowing of life’s root,
Lives face one another,
Entangled in myriad ways.
The Ten Good Deeds, serene and still,
Desolate the ten heavens.
Clothed in the layered Non-Action,
They save the hopeless.
Golden Perfection opens the Dharma,
Universally radiating majestic light,
Flowing through heaven and earth,
Illumining the ten directions.
Expounding sincerity to deliver beings,
The power of karmic merit is vast.
The ten sufferings dissolve,
Bathed in the golden countenance.
Awakening to the fundamental practice,
The Three Nets part and clear.
Advancing in the supreme ranks,
The body ascends to the jeweled palace,
To pay homage to the Lord of the Dao,
Bowing thrice in reverence.

The *Jade Hymn of the Supreme Golden Perfection Precepts, Practices, and Fundamental Conduct of the Upper Rank* proclaims:

Clouds luminous and lush,
Radiant across the ten directions,
Golden dawn’s glow arises,
Shading the jade halls.
Seven treasures congeal,
Eight assemblies purify the spirit,
The Mysterious covers the Three Images,
Naturally limpid and clear.
Heavenly light shines brightly,
Universally illuminating all forms.
The Primal Beginning’s myriad practices,
Take the precepts and deeds as their foundation.
Grasping the Wheel of the Dharma,
Vastly transforming all merits,
Boundless fundamental conduct,
Myriad models of karmic conditions.
The Perfected universally named,
The spiritual root of all dharmas.
Riding the void, treading the empty,
Communing with the ford.
The Primal August’s supreme treasure,
Thus establishes the Wheel of the Dharma.
Opening the Dao of the Three Realms,
Mounting the purple mist,
Feathered canopies draped in cover,
Ascending to meet the Heavenly Worthy.

The Heavenly Worthy addressed the Lord of the Dao, saying: These three jade hymns are enshrined in the Supreme Great Possession’s Jade Capital. The twelve thousand Perfected Guardians of the Supreme Golden Perfection Youths eternally follow the kalpic revolutions, turning the Wheel of the Tenfold Cyclic True Persons of the Upper Rank across the ten directions of all heavens.

Wherever these hymns are recited, their numinous tones resound with clarity. In the boundless worlds of the ten directions, the exalted perfected of all heavens simultaneously perform obeisance. The Supreme Perfected praise their excellence. The Dharma King proclaims the opening of the Dharma gates, bestowing ranks to deliver myriad beings, that all may attain the truth of the Dao.

If the great sages and perfected beings of all heavens know these hymns and recite them with fasting, the perfected of the ten directions will descend, paying homage six times daily. Myriad karmic obstructions dissolve, and soon the Dao is perfected.

The Heavenly Worthy addressed the Lord of the Dao, saying: I now open the Supreme Golden Perfection Wheel of the Dharma, the fundamental practices of the precepts, and the twelve boundless upper-rank karmic conditions. Revolving through the wondrously penetrating realms of the Perfected, this scripture’s supreme merit is universally efficacious. As the Wheel of the Dharma, it pours the consecrated waters upon the abysses of beings, turning across the ten directions to open salvation for boundless beings mired in sin, guiding them into the fields of blessings.

The precepts and practices of Golden Perfection ensure eternal abiding. Their Dao is lofty and wondrous, universally saving without end. The supreme treasure of the flying immortals is not transmitted to ordinary immortals. It naturally responds to the kalpic revolutions, its text resplendently luminous, universally efficacious.

The revolutions of Heaven and Earth all proceed through the Wheel of the Dharma; its merit is supreme, and none but those of utmost virtue and perfected persons may uphold it. The exalted sages ascend in rank to become lofty Perfected Ones, all through its scripture. The myriad evils turn to goodness, obstructions dissolve, suffering is uprooted, sins are eradicated, and blessings descend—all through this sutra. It broadly saves the ten directions, propagates the teachings across the heavens; its virtue is greatly penetrating, its Dao universally true. It drives the three vehicles to ferry boundless beings. I expound this sutra to entrust you with its observance. Once in nine kalpas it descends to the Jade Court of the Flying Immortals, where beings are opened and delivered according to their ranks—this is no difficult task.

The Heavenly Worthy addressed the Dao Lord, saying: I open the supreme Wheel of the Flying Immortals’ upper-rank realms to counter the five turbid kalpas. The first rank: the ten directions’ boundless worlds beset by calamities of war, slaughter, and turbidity. The second rank: the kalpic cycle shortened, the sun and moon waning and waxing in turbidity. The third rank: yin and yang in inversion and disorder, the stellar lodges losing their degrees, the myriad things failing to grow in turbidity. The fourth rank: the five directions’ demonic armies converging, slaughtering and harming boundless heavenly and human beings in turbidity of life and death. The fifth rank: the governance of nations in chaos, heavenly and human beings in turmoil, weapons and afflictions in turbidity.

When you witness these five turbid ages, you should rightly rely on the ranks of the Wheel of the Dharma to open, deliver, and revolve, securing and stabilizing the myriad ranks. Thus shall Heaven and Earth, the sun and moon, and the stellar lodges each return to their proper positions, pacifying and settling the myriad nations, all of which shall abide.

The Heavenly Worthy addressed the Dao Lord, saying: I open the supreme Wheel of the Flying Immortals’ upper-rank realms to counter the three calamitous kalpas, delivering the ten directions’ boundless worlds and myriad beings, all of whom shall be spared from kalpic tribulations. Thus do I employ the three vehicles’ treasure store to ferry them. The first rank: the kalpic fire flowing through the Three Realms. The second rank: the deluge surging and overflowing, the eight poles merging into one, waves surging to the heavens. The third rank: the violent winds raging for kalpas, shattering and piercing the heavens, the ten directions sinking, not one spared.

These are the great revolutions responding to the kalpic cycles, called the Three Calamities. At such times, you must diligently apply your mind to turn the Wheel of the Dharma, opening the three vehicles’ upper ranks to deliver heavenly and human beings from calamity, ensuring all abide in peace and behold the Great Perfected.

The Heavenly Worthy addressed the Dao Lord, saying: The six dusts of concealment and manifestation, the mysterious roots touched by sight and hearing, the demonic qi of forms and colors, the emptiness arising in listeners—cloud gates at dawn and dusk, evening veils upon body and mind, the failure to preserve thoughts of things—these are the most bitter harbingers of misfortune. The divine youths who know remain unmoved; those evils harm themselves. What is not of the Dharma is practiced, deceit and cunning alike. A single abandonment of the myriad virtues is irrecoverable for a lifetime. Harming one repays tenfold; for ten thousand kalpas, there is no rebirth. To kill with the hand or with thought—how much more so to take a life? The upper-rank precepts and karmic practices of Golden Perfection must be rightly followed. The ten thousand praises all arise from conduct as their foundation.

The Heavenly Worthy addressed the Dao Lord, saying: To turn the Wheel of the Dharma and open the upper ranks for deliverance, one must use ten golden dragons, each weighing one tael, to stabilize the ten directions. The patterned silks should correspond to each direction: nine feet of azure-patterned silk for the east, three feet of crimson-patterned silk for the south, seven feet of white-patterned silk for the west, five feet of black-patterned silk for the north, eight feet of purple-patterned silk for each of the four corners, twelve feet of blue-patterned silk for the upper direction, and fourteen feet of yellow-patterned silk for the lower direction. Ten incense tables and ten incense burners are placed in the ten directions.

The altar is constructed according to the Three Primes’ method of smearing ashes. The rites of repentance and thanksgiving follow the Three Primes’ method for removing sins. Lamps are lit in three tiers: ten lamps on each side of the outer altar, eight lamps on each side of the middle altar, and nine lamps on each side of the upper altar, all according to the ritual ranks. The Three Treasures stabilize the altar. For three days and three nights, the Dharma assembly burns incense, recites the sutra, confesses and repents, and turns the Wheel of the Flying Immortals’ luminous statutes to open and deliver the ten directions’ myriad beings from the roots of sin, obstructions, and suffering. The ten evils and all realms are thus enabled to advance into the ten directions’ Flying Immortals’ boundless halls of blessings.

The Heavenly Worthy addressed the Dao Lord, saying: When heavenly and human beings cultivate the supreme Dao and the Way of Perfection, they may rely on this Dharma to establish and practice it. This Dharma opens and delivers the ten directions’ vast and obscure suffering souls in the cycle of life and death, as well as the sins of ancestors, all of whom shall be turned and delivered to the halls of the ten blessings. When you witness the revolutions of Heaven and Earth, you should establish this great merit. When you witness the sun and moon waning and waxing, you should perform this fast. When the stellar lodges lose their degrees, you should perform this fast. When the lands of the heavens and nations are unsettled, you should perform this fast. When demonic armies arise in the world, myriad deaths occur, and yin and yang are disharmonious, you should perform this fast. When master and disciple face crises or the day of passing, you should perform this fast.

This upper-rank fast of the Wheel of the Dharma’s merit is boundless. All who attain the Dao in the ten directions do so through it, thereby reaching the realms of the utmost Perfected. The exalted sages who cultivate this merit ascend in rank to become Golden Perfected. The heavens’ Perfected Ones who establish this fast naturally open and deliver the myriad beings, universally propagating the Dharma gate. The causes and conditions of life and death all proceed through the Wheel of the Dharma. Its Dharma is lofty and wondrous, treasured beyond all else. Once in nine kalpas it revolves, illuminating Heaven and Earth. The boundless cycles of life and death all attain blessings and felicity, their light shining across the ten directions, universally abiding in perpetuity.

When heavenly and human beings of utmost virtue and perfected persons know this Dharma, receive, uphold, and propagate its gate of transformation, and cultivate this merit, they shall surely accomplish the Dao and attain Perfection.

The Heavenly Worthy said: The upper-rank Wheel of the Dharma carries the ten directions, the supreme, utmost Perfected, wondrous Dharma of precepts and practices. It universally gathers the boundless, awakens all to the mysterious, and perceives the boundless foundational practices and the myriad karmic conditions. It penetrates and observes Heaven and Earth, universally entering the Dharma gate. Those whose karmic and bodily actions are evil, sinking into the nine nights—when I turn the Wheel of the Dharma, all shall attain immortality. Beings reverse their transformations to be reborn in the heavens and among humans. The Wheel of the Dharma revolves the Dao; once in ninety thousand kalpas it is transmitted. None but the exalted companions of the Jade Emperor may descend as Perfected Ones. I now tell you this, sealing it in the Central Palace. Receive and uphold it faithfully. When kalpic calamities approach, rely on the upper-rank Dharma to turn and deliver the heavens, the ten directions’ boundless worlds, and all myriad beings, all of whom shall share in the Dharma’s conditions, universally beholding the great light that opens the revolutions, awakening and perceiving the Perfected Dao.

Its merit broadly illuminates, magnifying the Dao of the Three Vehicles—the Mother of all dharmas, the Most Perfect and Exalted—universally serving as the radiance and reflection of the ten directions, the宗 of all the myriad Dao of heaven and earth. Its blessings are supreme, abiding in serene constancy; when the great kalpa descends, all shall behold the Perfected Dao, universally delivering beings, all of whom ascend to the ten directions, eternally dwelling in the Heaven of Blessings.

You, who receive the supreme position of Dharma King, must apply your mind with diligence.

Thereupon, the Dao Lord arose, clasped his hands in reverence, and received the Golden Perfected Dharma Wheel’s *Precepts of Karmic and Bodily Actions, Upper Rank*. When the affair was concluded, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy commanded the assembly of great sages to harness their chariots and depart; the hosts of heaven returned to their positions, enduring for a hundred million kalpas.

The Dao declared: I receive the supreme *Golden Perfected Dharma Wheel’s Precepts of Karmic and Bodily Actions, Upper Rank*, eternally abiding in the highest grade, boundless in karmic conditions. Since the dawn of the kalpic beginning, when the Wheel was set in motion, I have delivered the boundless worlds of the ten directions and the measureless, innumerable beings—suffering souls in the cycle of birth and death—reversing the ten evils, extracting the roots of all sins, untying the nets and freeing the obstructed, liberating them from the fields of affliction. All alike proceed to the Jade Pool to refine their forms, donning jeweled robes and luminous crowns, dwelling in the Hall of Ten Abodes of Blessing. Its merit turns with the revolutions; none but those of profound awakening may descend to it. The texts of the ancient canon, the *Ten Thousand Dao of Power*, are now complete. The Dao shall proceed forth, its morning radiance gathering in eight assemblies—this shall be the time when cloud-brightness descends to preserve against kalpic calamities. The lands of blessed virtue shall first attain the Perfected Dao.

Thus concludes the *Supreme Wondrous Scripture of the Upper Rank Precepts of Karmic and Bodily Actions from the Numinous Treasure of the Highest Cavern-Mystery*.
