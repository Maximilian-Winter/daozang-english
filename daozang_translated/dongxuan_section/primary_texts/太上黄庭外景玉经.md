### **The Supreme Yellow Court Outer Radiance Jade Scripture, Part One**

The Supreme One, in leisurely retreat, composed these seven-character verses,
Expounding the body’s form and the various spirits.
Above lies the Yellow Court, below the Pass of Origin;
Behind, the Dark Gate, and before, the Gate of Life.

Inhaling and exhaling through the Chamber of Lu, entering the Cinnabar Field,
The Jade Pool’s pure water irrigates the numinous root.
Those who can cultivate this may abide long.

The person within the Yellow Court wears vermilion robes;
The Pass Gate’s sturdy bolts seal its double doors.
The Dark Gate flanks it, towering and majestic,
While within the Cinnabar Field, essence is subtle and obscure.

The Jade Pool’s pure water generates fat above,
The numinous root stands firm, never aging nor decaying.
Within the Central Pool dwells a person clad in red,
Three inches below the field, where the spirit resides.

Inner and outer are distant, doubly sealed—
Within the Spirit Chamber, one must cultivate and order.
The Dark Throat’s black conduit receives the essence talisman;
Hasten to secure your essence to sustain yourself.

Within the dwelling is a person ever clad in crimson.
If you can perceive them, you shall know no illness.
They stand transversely, a foot in length, binding above—
If you can guard this, you shall suffer no harm.

Inhaling and exhaling through the Chamber of Lu to repay yourself,
Preserve and fortify it, and the body shall receive blessings.
Within the square inch, guard and conceal with care,
And spirit and essence shall return, old age restored to youth.

Flanking the Dark Gate, the flow descends to its end,
Nurturing the Jade Tree to flourish and grow strong.

The supreme Dao is not burdensome, without haste;
The Numinous Terrace connects to heaven, overlooking the central wilds.
Within the square inch, at the Pass below,
Within the Jade Chamber, the spirit’s gate and door—
All these were taught to me by the Noble Scion.

The Hall of Light extends in four directions, following the source of the Dharma Sea.
The Perfected One, Zidan, stands before me.
Within the Three Passes, essence and qi run deep—
If you wish not to die, cultivate Kunlun.

The Crimson Palace’s layered towers rise twelve stories high;
Within its chambers, the Five Blacks gather.
The Scarlet City’s scion stands in the Central Pool,
Below lies the Long Wall, its hue the dark valley’s shade.

The essential subtleties of long life lie in the chamber’s urgency:
Cast aside lust and desire, focus solely on preserving essence.
The inch-field and foot-dwelling can govern life—
Tether your heart, and peace shall long endure.

Observe the will, let the spirit wander among the Three Marvels;
In leisure, without affairs, the heart is at great peace.
Constantly preserve the Jade Chamber, and the spirit shall attain clarity;
At times, contemplate the Great Granary, and hunger and thirst shall cease.
Command the Six Dings and the divine maidens to attend—
Seal the path of essence, and you may live long.

Within the central chamber dwells the spirit;
Wash and order the body, allowing no defilement.
Survey the five viscera, inspect their measures;
The six bowels, cultivated and cleansed, become pure as silk.
Emptiness and spontaneity are the Dao’s principle.

Things have their nature, affairs need not be burdensome.
Recline in effortless non-action, and the body shall be at ease.
The dwelling of emptiness lies within the curtains—
Silent and vast, the mouth utters no word.
Serene and desireless, wandering the Garden of Virtue,
Pure and fragrant, the Jade Maiden abides.
Cultivate virtue, attain clarity—this is the Dao’s gate.

### **The Supreme Yellow Court Outer Radiance Jade Scripture, Part Two**

Cultivating the Dao in carefree seclusion, dwelling in profound solitude,
Nurturing life and destiny, guarding emptiness and non-being.
Serene and desireless, pondering what concerns,
Once the wings are fully grown, they spread in proper order—
Long life and enduring vision, then one soars away.

The Five Phases, uneven yet sharing the same root and node,
The Three and Five unite in qi, their essence fundamentally one.
Who shall contend with them, vying with sun and moon?
Embrace jade, hold pearls, harmonizing the chamber with the child.

If you can know this, all affairs are complete;
Hold fast to what you possess, and never lose it—
Then you shall not die, entering the Golden Chamber.

Exiting with the sun, entering with the moon—this is my Dao.
Heaven’s seven and earth’s three cycle in mutual guardianship.
Ascending and descending, advancing and retreating, only then is union enduring.
Jade and stone, resplendent—these are my treasures.
You possess them yourself; why not guard them?

The heart understands the root and nurtures the flower’s splendor;
Serve heaven, follow earth, and harmonize with stored essence.
The Ninefold Mound’s mountain—how lofty it stands!
Within dwells the Perfected One, whom you may command.

The Three Yangs within may grant long life;
On the fifth of seven days, they cycle in union.
The Kunlun mountain—do not lose your way!
Shielded by the Purple Palace and the Crimson City’s towers,
Flanked by sun and moon like linked pearls,
For ten thousand years, radiant and boundless, without term.

The Three Yangs of the outer root come of themselves;
Nurturing the Three Yins within may grant long life.
The hun longs for heaven, the po enters the spring—
Returning the hun, restoring the po, is the Dao’s nature.

### **The Supreme Yellow Court Outer Radiance Jade Scripture, Part Three**

The turning mechanism suspends pearls in endless rings;
The swift mare’s golden key remains ever whole and firm.
Bearing earth, suspending heaven, it encircles Qian and Kun.
Its form follows the four seasons, red as cinnabar.
Before, reverent; behind, humble—each has its distinct gate.
Escort it with returning cinnabar and dark spring,
Like the tortoise drawing black to the numinous root.

Within dwells a Perfected One, head bound in golden cloth,
Armor-clad, talisman in hand, opening the seven gates.
This is no branch or leaf—it is the true root.
Meditate on it day and night, and you may abide long.

The weary Daoist is no spirit—
It is the accumulation of essence that grants longevity.
All people eat grains and the five flavors,
Yet only I consume the Great Harmony of yin and yang qi,
Thus able to avoid death, for heaven’s decree is so.

Let me speak of the five viscera, each with its direction:
The heart is the lord of the state, master of the five viscera.
Within the mind, movement and stillness—qi flows as it should,
The Dao naturally sustains me, the spirit’s radiance shining.

By day, radiant and bright; by night, self-guarding.
Thirsty, I drink nectar; hungry, I am sated.
Traversing the six bowels, storing at mao and you,
Turning yang into yin, concealing within the nine—
Constantly practicing this, one shall not age.

The liver’s qi, cultivated and long,
Arranges the five viscera, giving rise to the Three Lights.
Above, it harmonizes with the Triple Burner, drinking nectar.
The essence awaits heaven and earth—this is the Dao of long life.
My spirit, hun, and po reside at the center.

Essence and fluid flow like springs, their fragrance issuing from the nose.
Standing at the Dark Throat, embracing the Hall of Light,
They connect my flowery essence, regulating yin and yang.

**End of The Supreme Yellow Court Outer Radiance Jade Scripture**

Bowing at the Mysterious Gate, awaiting the Heavenly Dao,
It draws near within my body, yet guards itself.
Pure now and non-acting, spirit lingers and abides,
Essence and qi ascend and descend, their barriers and patterns distinct.

The seven apertures now open, and one knows not aging.
Returning to sit at Heaven’s Gate, awaiting yin and yang,
Descending through the throat to commune with spirit’s radiance,
Passing beneath the Floral Canopy, clear and cool.

Entering the Pure Void Abyss, beholding my form,
When the cyclical elixir is complete, long life may be attained.
Returning past the Floral Pool, stirring kidney essence,
Gazing upon the Hall of Light, nearing the Cinnabar Field,
It summons all spirits to open the Gate of Life,
Unobstructing the Heavenly Dao, concealing the numinous root.

Yin and yang arrayed like streaming stars,
The liver’s qi like a ring, endless and without end.
The lung’s virtue arises with the Triple Burner,
Bowing at Heaven’s Gate, awaiting the ancient Dao.

Pure fluid and sweet springs flow through the six bowels,
Following the nose up and down, opening the two ears.
Gazing upon heaven and earth, preserving the youthful lad,
Harmonizing essence and flower, ordering hair and teeth.

Complexion luminous and lustrous, never whitening with age,
Descending through the throat, how vast and boundless!
All spirits gather, seeking one another,
Entering the Crimson Palace, its hue like purple blossoms.

Concealed beneath the Floral Canopy, communing with the Spirit Hut,
Devotedly guarding the heart’s spirit, transmitting mutual calls.
Beholding my spirits, repelling and dispelling evil,
The spleen’s spirit returns to rely on the great house,
Nurturing the numinous root, never to wither again.
Reaching the stomach’s conduit, penetrating the Void,
Sealing the Gate of Life like a jade capital,
Lifespan transmitted for ten thousand years and more.

The spirit within the spleen roams the Central Palace,
Morning assembly with the five spirits, harmonizing the Three Lights.
Above, it joins the Heavenly Dao and the Hall of Light,
Unobstructing the six bowels, regulating the five phases.

Metal, wood, water, fire, earth as sovereigns,
Unobstructing blood and vessels, sweat as nectar.
The two spirits unite, descending with Jade Essence,
Above, receiving primordial qi, years ever lengthening.

Patrolling and protecting the seven apertures, dispelling misfortune,
Sun and moon arrayed, unfolding yin and yang.
Bowing at Great Yin, completing its form,
Of the five viscera’s lords, the kidney is essence.

Exiting and entering the two qi, entering the Yellow Court,
Breathing the Void, beholding my form,
Strengthening my sinews and bones, completing blood and vessels.

In the indistinct and unseen, passing through pure numinosity,
Sitting beneath the hut, observing the youthful lad,
Day and night abiding in spirit’s radiant light,
Exiting through no gate, entering through no door.

Serene and desireless, nurturing the flower’s root,
Ingesting the mysterious qi, one may attain immortality.
Returning through the seven gates, drinking from the Great Abyss,
Passing through my throat, traversing pure numinosity,
Inquiring of the immortal’s path and wondrous arts,
Ingesting numinous mushrooms and Jade Essence.

Head crowned with white silk, feet at the Cinnabar Field,
Bathing in the Floral Pool, irrigating the numinous root.
The three palaces in harmony, opening the Gate of Life,
The five flavors all arriving, good virtue returning.

The great Dao vast and boundless, the heart untroubled,
With unbound hair, practicing this, one may long endure.
My words are complete—do not recklessly transmit them.
