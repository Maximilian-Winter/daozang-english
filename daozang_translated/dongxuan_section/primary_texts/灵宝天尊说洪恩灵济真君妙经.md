**Imperially Composed Preface to *The Marvelous Scripture of the Vast Grace Numinous Salvation True Lords, Spoken by the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy***

We reflect upon the Dao as teaching, which unfolds the profound mysteries of the primal chaos and the void, possessing the wondrous subtleties of the Boundless and the spontaneous. Dim and obscure, silent and still—gazing upon it, one sees no form; listening to it, one hears no sound. Above, it shades and assists the imperial rule; below, it benefits and succors all beings. Its merit and power are so vast they defy description.

Consider the True Lords of Vast Grace: the Golden Portal of the Nine Heavens, Illuminating Dao and Manifesting Virtue, Great Immortal of Resplendent Numinosity and Universal Salvation, Pure and Subtle, Cavernous and Mysterious, Void and Wondrous, Compassionate and Benevolent, Protector of the State and Shelter of the People—Hong’en True Lord Jiang Wang; and the Jade Portal of the Nine Heavens, Proclaiming Transformation and Upholding the Teaching, Supreme Immortal of Radiant Numinosity and Vast Salvation, Lofty and Bright, Vast and Tranquil, Profound and Serene, Wondrously Responsive, Benevolent and Kind, Assistant to the State and Guardian of the People—Hong’en True Lord Rao Wang. Concentrating the essence of the numinous and the excellence of heaven, they were born as heroes among men. Broad in kindness and compassion, they cherished the people and loved all things. Loyal to their lord and filial to their parents, they revered the Three Treasures, devoted themselves to goodness, and practiced with unwavering diligence. Having perfected their merit and fulfilled their conduct, they were moved by heaven to receive titles, their ranks established among the immortals. They assist and illuminate the mechanisms of transformation, guiding beings from darkness into light, warding off disasters and averting calamities, dispelling misfortune and summoning blessings, spreading protection over the earth and benefiting all living things.

Recently, they have magnified their numinous efficacy, shielding and guarding Our person, supporting and sheltering Us, bringing about peace and tranquility. Thereafter, they manifested talismans and medicines, widely bestowing them upon the realm, with the aim of enabling people to dispel illness and suffering and to flourish with descendants. Their great virtue and profound grace are equal to heaven and earth. Moved by the favor of the spirits, We have never forgotten it, day or night. Amidst the myriad affairs of state, We chanced upon *The Marvelous Scripture of the Vast Grace Numinous Salvation True Lords, Spoken by the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy*, which reveals the subtle and profound, whose divine transformations are unfathomable, whose expedient benefits and deliverance span kalpas. Truly, it is the sun and moon illuminating the dark, the boat and oar crossing the sea. Thus, We have had it carved and printed to widely disseminate it, in repayment of the spirits’ blessings.

If devout and faithful persons can purify themselves through repentance, revere the Three Treasures, be utterly loyal and filial, practice benevolence and righteousness, and earnestly vow to receive, uphold, recite, and chant this scripture, then their households will enjoy good fortune, their destinies will flow smoothly, their descendants will flourish, disasters will be averted, calamities will be transcended, blessings will increase, and life will be prolonged, extending even to their nine generations, all attaining liberation and ascent. But if one slanders, belittles, or disdains the Three Treasures, is disloyal or unfilial, unkind or unrighteous, and fails to reverently believe and uphold this scripture, then one will incur evil karma, one’s household will decline, one’s descendants will weaken, one’s years will be cut short, and one’s nine generations will be burdened, forever sinking into darkness. Looking back at the past, there is clear evidence of this.

Alas! Good and ill fortune, virtue and evil—all are created by the mind. Doing good brings blessings; doing evil brings misfortune. This is the natural principle. Thus it is said: “The family that accumulates goodness will surely have abundant blessings; the family that accumulates evil will surely have abundant misfortune.” It is also said: “Only the Supreme Lord is not constant: those who do good are bestowed with a hundred blessings; those who do evil are visited with a hundred misfortunes.” Therefore, those who contemplate this—how can they not be exhorted? How can they not be exhorted?

Written on the first day of the first lunar month in the eighteenth year of the Yongle reign.

**The Marvelous Scripture of the Vast Grace Numinous Salvation True Lords, Spoken by the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy**

At that time, the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy was in the Palace of Fivefold Clarity in the Great Brahma Heaven, seated by a table. Bells and chimes sounded of themselves as the assembly of star hosts of the Five Celestial Granaries gathered. The Heavenly Worthy expounded the wondrous Dao of the Supreme, the Boundless, and the Utmost Real.

Then, the two envoys of the Central Granary of the Dipper—Ministers of Water—stood before the throne, the left holding a green tally, the right wielding a yellow axe. They bowed their heads, prostrated themselves twice, knelt, and addressed the Heavenly Worthy: “By good fortune in past lives, we have been counted among the heavenly and human realms. Looking down upon the beings of the Desire Realm, we see that they are neither loyal nor filial, neither righteous nor benevolent. They commit many evil deeds without shame or remorse, and their allotted span has come to an end. Now, in this final kalpa, they have lost the celestial charts, the cosmic net is torn, and the cords of order are broken. Warfare and fire rage unchecked, jade and stone alike are burned and destroyed. Some suffer from floods, others from famine. Punishments and taxes are harsh and oppressive; plagues and poisons spread unchecked. They endure all manner of suffering yet do not awaken, their vitality nearly extinguished, the human Dao on the verge of collapse. By what causes and conditions may they be saved? We beseech Your compassion to open the gate of expedient means.”

The Heavenly Worthy said: “Excellent, excellent. The beings of the final kalpa are like newborn infants. Since you have generated such a mind and made such a vow, follow Our teachings and widely expound the causes and conditions to all beings, enabling them to awaken their natures without doubt or hesitation. Loyalty and filial piety, benevolence and righteousness—cultivate even one of these four, and you will always dwell in good fortune.”

The ministers, having received these words, dared not fail to carry them out. Thus, in the year of *jiachen* during the *bingwu* cycle, they descended into the human realm, dividing their bodies to teach and transform. Their merit was accomplished in the Eastern Sea, and their traces were manifested in the Southern Region. After a full cycle of sixty years, they returned to their duties. In one region, incense and offerings continued for many years. When the time of their transformation came, they renewed their vows as before, advancing in the ranks of immortals and receiving the title of True Lord. The Heavenly Worthy praised and pitied them, embodying the Supreme’s virtue of cherishing life, so that all good men and women might know that body, nature, and life all depend on the Dao to generate loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, and righteousness, and to understand these causes.

On the Three Primes, the Eight Festivals, the Three Assemblies, the Five Fasts, the days of *gengshen* and *jiazi*, and one’s own life-day, one should burn incense, observe purification, and make offerings according to the proper rites. With a tranquil mind, face north, bow the head, and reverently recite the names:

*Nine Heavens Golden Portal, Illuminating Dao and Manifesting Virtue, Great Immortal of Resplendent Numinosity and Universal Salvation, Pure and Subtle, Cavernous and Mysterious, Void and Wondrous, Compassionate and Benevolent, Protector of the State and Shelter of the People—Hong’en True Lord Jiang Wang;*

*Nine Heavens Jade Portal, Proclaiming Transformation and Upholding the Teaching, Supreme Immortal of Radiant Numinosity and Vast Salvation, Lofty and Bright, Vast and Tranquil, Profound and Serene, Wondrously Responsive, Benevolent and Kind, Assistant to the State and Guardian of the People—Hong’en True Lord Rao Wang.*

With reverence before the sacred compassion, we repent in accordance with the scriptures, never transgressing the vows of the True Lords, each establishing ourselves through loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, and righteousness. Within, this may augment blessings and prolong life; without, it may dispel calamities and deliver from adversity. Above, it may enable the souls of ancestors to ascend and transcend; below, it may bring peace and tranquility to the household and kin. Universally, we wish all beings to partake in benefit and joy.

Thereupon, the Heavenly Worthy expounded further for the True Lords and proclaimed in verse:

*True Lords of Numinous Salvation,*
*Cultivated the Real and attained the Dao.*
*They wander and feast in the Immortal Capital,*
*Where the Heavenly Worthy bestowed their titles.*
*The Northern Dipper sent down its spirit,*
*Flowing abundantly to the left.*
*Below, it oversees the Three Realms;*
*Above, it pays homage to the Five Elders.*
*Blessing the state and pacifying the home,*
*Their merit is vast and boundless.*
*No wish goes unfulfilled,*
*Silently aligning with all prayers.*
*Loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, and righteousness,*
*Forever treasured as the essence of being.*
*Used as the cause and condition,*
*Never transgressing the sacred vow.*

*All good and evil*
*Arise from the heart’s creation.*
*Those who do good reap blessings;*
*Those who do evil incur misfortune.*

*Hasten, hasten, in accordance with the decree of the Heavenly Worthy!*

Thus concludes the *Marvelous Sutra of the Numinous Salvation True Lords of Vast Grace*, spoken by the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy.
