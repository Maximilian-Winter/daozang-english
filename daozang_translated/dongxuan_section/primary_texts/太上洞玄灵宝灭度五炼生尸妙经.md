**The Supreme Cavern Mystery Numinous Treasure Scripture on Extinguishing Karma and Refining the Corpse to Restore Life, Scroll One**

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy was in the Fragrant Grove Garden of the Ever-Joyful Abode, instructing seven thousand two hundred and forty youths. When the Dharma rites were roughly complete, the youths of superior wisdom and the Wheel-Turning Celestial Youths advanced, made obeisance, and addressed the Heavenly Worthy: "Today, as we attend your seat, our joy is beyond measure. The heavens have opened their grace, and all is radiant with light. The dark prisons of hell, the frozen realms of eternal night, the three paths and five sufferings of hungry ghosts and deceased spirits—all have been liberated and restored to blessedness. The Three Offices have ceased their accusations, and the living and the dead rejoice together.

Yet the souls of the departed, though freed, have not yet entered the Wheel of Rebirth. Their corporeal spirits scatter and fall, their rotting bones devoid of moisture, sinking into the ninefold earth, strewn across the subterranean bureaus. Their wandering souls drift in anguish, unable to return. The Earthly Offices press for reckoning, their bodily forms restless, enduring renewed sorrow and oppression, gazing upward to implore the heavens.

Now that grace has been extended and all is made anew, the August Dao flows freely, its blessings reaching the ten directions. We have heard that the Heavenly Worthy has bestowed great compassion; we pray that the August Mercy be universally applied. Grant that those who should be delivered be delivered, those who should be born be born, those who should be transformed be transformed, and those who should return be returned. If their karmic bonds are not yet severed and they cannot return, their bodily forms remain in their former abodes, concealed in the nine springs. Harassed by myriad spirits, they find no refuge, their wandering souls adrift, returning to afflict their descendants.

Since the Great Transformation has arisen, it is fitting that all be universally absolved. We do not know if there are further essential methods within the Dharma that may be proclaimed, to be announced to the Earthly Offices, so that they may pacify, console, and shelter them, allowing all to find peace. Let the nine bureaus be duly distinguished, and their bodies guarded and tended. If you deign to show compassion, then all under heaven will rejoice in harmony, the living and the dead bearing no resentment, and blessings will flow for a hundred million kalpas, endless through the ages."

Thereupon, the Heavenly Worthy universally commanded the Heavenly Thearchs, the Limitless Supreme Great Dao Lords, the Great Sage Assemblies of the Ten Directions, the Perfected Lords and Venerable Ones, the Flying Celestial Divine Kings, the Five Elder Thearchs, the Southern Supreme Life-Nurturing and World-Delivering Sima, the Recorders of Deeds and Lords of Destiny, the Perfected Ones of Longevity, the Jade Maidens of Mystic Harmony, the various Perfected Ones, and the innumerable hosts—all to resume their seats. "Now I shall further expound the Dharma gates for the youths of superior wisdom, clarifying the ancient canons of the Dragon Han and Mystic Capital, the *Jade Casket of the Nine Dark Realms* and the *Scripture of the Maiden of Azure Jade*, to deliver the dark prisons of hell, the frozen realms of eternal night, the three paths and five sufferings of hungry ghosts and deceased spirits, that all may behold the light.

Proclaim to the heavens, that each may elucidate the spontaneous jade scripts of their celestial names. Universally announce to the celestial and terrestrial water bureaus, the sun, moon, and stellar lodges, the Jade Armillary and Jade Balance, the Three Realms and Five Thearchs, the sacred mountains of the Five Peaks, the earthly officials of the nine lands, the Caverns of Primordial, Abyssal, Void, Numinous, and Non-Being, the Limitless and Boundless, the measureless heights and depths, the formless and colorless, the soundless and silent, the immeasurably vast and minute—all spirits and numina, each according to their appointed tasks.

Now, for those under your jurisdiction—those souls condemned for past transgressions—record their good and evil deeds, merits and faults, years, months, and days. Itemize each matter, distinguish their former abodes and the whereabouts of their bodily forms, and according to their respective domains, console and shelter them. Let the earthly deities guard and protect them, tend and provide for them, allowing no disturbance, so that they may achieve fruition according to their merits. Let those who should be transferred be transferred, those who should be delivered be delivered, those who should be transformed be transformed, and those who should be born be born. Let the records of the fallen be reviewed, the vows of the waters absolved, the celestial decrees of punishment erased, and all be made manifest."

Thereupon, the assembly of the fourfold host and the youths of superior wisdom rejoiced, made obeisance, and simultaneously raised their hands, snapping their fingers in praise.

At that moment, the Thirty-Two Heavenly Thearchs took their seats and commanded the Flying Celestial Divine Beings to unfurl the Purple Yang Jade Terrace, open the Luminous True Jade Casket, and retrieve the celestial, spontaneously arisen jade scriptures of the *Infinite Cavern Chapters* from the Heavenly Center. These were entrusted to the Earthly Offices to deliver all beings, pacify the corpse, guard the numen, and preserve the soul and spirit.

By the Black Thearch’s *Great Mystery Maiden of Azure Jade Talisman*, they are proclaimed to the nine bureaus of the Northern Earthly Offices, to deliver all deceased souls of the North, pacify and guard their bodily forms, tend and console them, allowing no harassment or disturbance by the Earthly Offices, all in accordance with the *Maiden of Azure Jade Scripture* and the *Golden Dragon Courier’s Edicts*.

The Supreme Supreme Supreme One Qi One Qi, the Supreme Supreme Supreme Limitless Peakless Colorless, the Heaven of the Great Net’s Natural Jade Script, governs the Central Yellow Primordial Heavenly Lord. By the Yellow Thearch’s *Great Mystery Maiden of Azure Jade Talisman*, they are proclaimed to the nine bureaus of the Central Earthly Offices, to deliver all deceased souls of the Center, pacify and guard their bodily forms, tend and console them, allowing no harassment or disturbance by the Earthly Offices, all in accordance with the *Maiden of Azure Jade Scripture* and the *Golden Dragon Courier’s Transmissions*.

Each heaven dispatches its Flying Heavenly Divine Kings, who, with the *Heavenly Center’s Numinous Sound Natural Jade Script Maiden of Azure Jade Talisman*, jointly proclaim to the Earthly Offices of the Five Directions, Five Thearchs, and Five Marchmounts. They each comply with the talismanic commands, reverently upholding the Great Dao.

The August Dao now made manifest, the heavens cleared and the qi settled; the Three Luminaries halted their wheels, the stellar lodges shone resplendently, the celestial pivots ceased their motion, rivers and seas stilled in silence, mountains and peaks swallowed their mists. The seasons harmonized, the qi purified, golden winds brushed away the dust, the heavens held no drifting veils, sun and moon bathed in radiance. The Five Sufferings dissolved, the long night’s souls awakened, withered trees blossomed anew, the dead regained their forms, unicorns danced and phoenixes soared, their joyful cries filling the air. The heavens leapt in exultation, scattering flowers and chanting praises.

The Heavenly Worthy, filled with delight, intoned this hymn:

The Crimson Clarity returns to transformation,
Merging with you yet dividing.
Yin and yang refine and change,
Their Dao naturally so.
The Mysterious Chart turns sevenfold,
To nine it still returns.
The Primordial Mandate’s numinous script,
Boundless are its cavernous chapters.
The ranks of the impermanent,
Their qi unites the Nine Mornings.
Yang’s light stealthily stirs,
Bright effulgences ride the mist.
Three revolutions, five refinements,
Harmonized with the Seven Streams.
Following their hues, they flourish and shine,
Each returning to their original spirits.
The Great Dao simplifies deliverance,
Withered bones regain their forms.
Treasure my wondrous Dao,
Ascend to the rank of Upper Perfected.
Return to the Five Refinements,
The supreme Dao’s highest numen.
Illuminating sun and moon,
Pervading the Nine Clarities.
The heavens open their grace,
The dark night’s mystery clears.
Withered bones transcend their steps,
Refined transformations arise of themselves.
Inhaling and exhaling the numinous harmony,
Piercing the dark to enter the hidden.
Spirits wondrously transform ten thousandfold,
Flying souls return to their forms.
Riding the mist and mounting the void,
They ascend to the August Court.
The Jade Script proclaims the mandate,
The Earthly Offices attain great peace.
All who receive deliverance
Universally enter the light.
Possessing my precious script,
Generation after generation, they transform and live.
Careless leaks and wanton disclosures
Will meet the wind’s blade in punishment.
The Jade Chapters’ numinous script births vermilion light,
The Five Numinous coalesce their essence, illuminating the ten directions.
The four eights divide their positions, uniting the Five Phases,
The stellar lodges, sun, moon, yin, and yang flow in communion.
Establishing the Heavenly Perfected to protect the Supreme August,
Opening the Dharma-gate to unify all.
The Great Thousand of the Maitreya Dao flourishes,
The golden throne’s joy cannot be constant.
The heavens leap in exultation, offering numinous hymns,
Opening my wondrous Dao to enlighten the young.
May you, through kalpas without end, live without limit,
Ninefold refined into Perfected, enthroned as Immortal Kings.
Guard this within your breast, take care not to divulge it.

The Heavenly Worthy finished his hymn. The Heavenly Thearchs, the Limitless Supreme Great Dao Lords, the Ten Directions’ Limitless Perfected Great Sages, the Flying Heavenly Divine Kings, the Five Venerable Thearch Lords, the Southern Supreme Life-Nurturing and World-Delivering Sima, the Recorders and Life-Mandate Officers, the Upper Numinous Immortals, the Mysterious Harmony Jade Maidens, the various Primordial Lords and Numinous Consorts, the Perfected Ones, and the innumerable hosts—seven thousand two hundred and forty youths—all rose as one. Pinching incense and scattering flowers, they circumambulated thrice to the left, then turned northward to bow, raising their hands and snapping their fingers.

The thirty-two heavens’ sun, moon, and stellar lodges all shone brightly at once. The Nine Dark Abysses of the netherworld’s limitless caverns were pervaded by luminous mystery, no longer shrouded in darkness, their hidden depths universally revealed. The Earth Treasury released its stores, gold and jade revealed their forms, mountains and rivers, streams and ravines, all leveled in vast evenness. White bones received qi, withered corpses regained their souls, the Nine Lands attained purity and peace, the Earthly Offices found tranquility, all beings received universal deliverance, none left unenlightened.

The Great Dao flowed and transformed, the August Way unfolded. Universally proclaimed to the heavens’ sun, moon, and stellar lodges, the celestial pivots and jade balances, the Southern and Northern Dippers, the Life-Mandate and Record Officers, Han Jun the Master Recorder, the Southern Prosperity Upper Palace, all earthly and aquatic realms, the Five Marchmounts’ numinous mountains, the Three Offices and Nine Bureaus, the Twelve River Sources, the Long Night’s Bureau within the Nine Darks, the Four Controllers and Five Thearchs—all numinous beings, each obeying the Great Dao, universally rejoiced as one, taking this day as new. Without above or below, without limit or end, without depth or distance, without darkness or concealment, without bounds or edges, without great or small, without beginning or end—all spirits, with a snap of their fingers, received the mandate and complied, reverently following.

Now, the Supreme Clarity’s faithful disciple So-and-So, having extinguished the Five Immortals, entrusts their corpse to the Great Yin.

Abiding ever in radiance, demons dare not intrude; all numinous spirits attend and guard in peace, precisely as decreed in the ancient *Nüqing* scriptures of the Primordial Beginning’s covenant with the perfected. This text is inscribed in black upon green stone, and the master, having prostrated and presented the yellow silk memorial, buries it in the easternmost boundary of the tomb where the deceased’s bodily form lies. At the moment of burial, the master performs the Nine-Step Yu Pace, advancing to the site, faces east, and recites the large characters and the text in full. He then strikes his teeth twenty-four times, swallows qi nine times, and intones the incantation:

By the talismanic command of the Primordial Beginning, a universal proclamation is issued to the Earthly Offices and divine realms of the Eastern Limitless World, to the Nine Qi General Controller of the Cavernous Void, the Cavernous Non-Being, the Cavernous Profound, and the Cavernous Primordial, and to all netherworld spirits and boundless divine kings of the Three Realms. Today is a day of great celebration: the Azure Heaven’s first yang arises, the exalted chariot assumes its rightful place, and the myriad Dao open forth. So-and-So receives deliverance, entrusts their corpse to the Mysterious Chamber, and as a faithful disciple of the Supreme Clarity, their soul ascends in response. The Five Immortals bathe, their garments are brushed and adorned, their form sheltered in the numinous prison, the earth itself parting to make way. Jade maidens are invoked to pacify and guard the divine palace; all attendants and guardians provide sustenance naturally. When the soul returns to the body, the Celestial Thearch will welcome it—all shall proceed as in the ancient statutes of the Illuminated Perfected.

Upon completion, the text is buried in the earth.

In accordance with the statutes of Illuminated Perfection, the Son of Heaven and kings shall offer five *liang* of gold to honor the Five Emperors and pacify the Five Directions. Commoners shall use fifty *jin* of iron. This token of faith in the karmic conditions of life, death, and deliverance brings boundless merit. Proclaim this to all beings under Heaven, that all may hear.

The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign declares: The scriptures for delivering and redeeming sinful souls from past transgressions, and for securing the bodily form and dwelling of the deceased, originate from the era before the Dragon Han. The Heavenly Worthy commanded the revelation of this great Dharma to instruct the divine youths. The great deities of the heavens unveiled the profound mysteries of the Dragon Han, expounding the esoteric texts of the Cavernous Mystery. They liberated those confined in the Long Night’s abode, allowing the Nine Nether Hells to bask in the light of the Great Sun. Lonely spirits may thus return, and decayed remains find connection, so that the Hall of Blessings may be attained. Clothing and sustenance arise naturally, and the Flying Celestials may be encountered in fellowship, escorting one as a guest of the Most High. This Dharma is lofty and wondrous, beyond all praise. Let all assembled—great multitudes and divine youths—cherish it well.

Thereupon, the four assemblies simultaneously prostrated, touching their heads to the ground, extolling its virtue before withdrawing.

The Most High Wondrous Scripture of the Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure on the Five Refining Methods to Restore the Corpse, Lower Scroll

**The Yellow Chapter Rite of the Numinous Treasure’s Five Transmutations for Pacifying the Spirit and Securing the Divine**

The Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure’s Red Emperor, Perfected Master of the Utmost Truth, your servant Wang Jia, bows his head and respectfully addresses: Above, above, above—one qi, one qi; above, above, above—boundless, without summit, without color, without light, the vast and true Great Dao, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Origin, the Thirty-Two Heavenly Emperors, and the Jade Sovereign of the Most High Great Dao.

Your servant, entrusted with the great transformation of the Primordial Origin, has witnessed the heavens open the dark prisons of the earthly hells, liberating the three paths, the five sufferings, and the hungry ghosts and dead souls from the Long Night, all bathed in radiant light. The imperial Dao having refined them, the decayed remains return to humanity; the Three Realms are purified, and the Earthly Bureau attains peace. Yet those who have perished, whose corpses are entrusted to the Great Yin and whose forms are lodged in the Earthly Palace—whose merit is slight and virtue meager, and who have not yet been granted return—shall all, in accordance with the talismanic commands of the Lady of Blue, be led by their respective overseers, consoled, sustained, and protected, so that none may be disturbed, and all may be restored to rebirth among humankind.

At that moment, the great sagely hosts of the heavens, the Boundless Most High Great Dao Sovereign, the Five Venerable Thearchs, the Flying Celestial Kings, the Southern Prosperity Upper Palace, the Longevity Marshal, the True Lord of Compassionate Life, the various Primordial Ladies and Numinous Consorts, the Jade Maidens of Mystic Harmony, the various Perfected Ones, and the seven thousand two hundred and forty divine youths simultaneously snapped their fingers, universally proclaiming to all heavens, earths, and waters; the sun, moon, and stellar lodges; the jade pivot and celestial balance; the Five Thearchs and Five Marchmounts; the various numinous mountains and earthly bureaus; the Three Offices and Nine Bureaus; the twelve river sources; the Cavernous Ultimate and Cavernous Abyss; all without height or depth, near or far, boundary or limit, great or small, end or extremity—every spirit was made to hear and know.

The golden tally and jade writ were entrusted to the Jade Maidens of Mystic Harmony, with the charge that henceforth all would be renewed, reverently upholding the great Dharma without partiality. Though the great cycles of heaven and earth have turned, the orthodox writ remains luminously clear. Now, in accordance with the ancient canon of the Upper Palace of the Lady of Blue, the sagely Dao is reaffirmed.

For the pure and faithful disciple, male or female, of such-and-such a prefecture, county, village, and hamlet, named Wang Jia, aged so-and-so years, whose natal destiny is bing-wu, whose register is held by the Red Emperor, who received qi in the seventh month, and who is endowed with yang from the Cinnabar Heaven—though his prior merit remains unfulfilled, and he dwells in this defiled world, tainted by its impurities—he is fated to perish, his life entrusted to the Great Yin, his form lodged in the Earthly Bureau. Now, in the central heaven, within such-and-such a village and hamlet, a chamber has been established in the Pacifying Palace as his dwelling. Yet his merit is slight and virtue meager, and he cannot return of his own accord. Now, driven and pressed by the Earthly Bureau, he finds no peace; his hun-soul flees, his po-soul scatters, and his corpse knows no rest.

Respectfully following the golden tally and jade writ of the Illuminated Perfection’s great Dharma, we now reverently invoke the natural jade writ talismanic commands of the Lady of Blue, petitioning them to descend and instruct the numinous officials of the nine earths within such-and-such a heaven to pacify and secure Wang Jia’s bodily form and earthly abode.

We invoke the descent of the Nine Qi Azure Heaven’s Granary Numinous Life-Spirit Perfected Ones, accompanied by the immortals of the Eastern Marchmount, riding nine thousand myriad chariots of Granary Dragons, bearing the Nine Qi celestial writ talismanic commands of the Azure Emperor and Lady of Blue. They descend to the numinous officials of the nine earths of the eastern region, opening the Long Night’s abode and the Nine Nether Hells, to extricate Wang Jia’s hun-soul and spirit, returning them to his former abode. Those who should be transformed shall be transformed; those who should be delivered shall be delivered; those who should be reborn shall be reborn; those who should return shall return. Those not yet reborn shall have their corporeal forms pacified and illuminated, sustained and protected, so that none may be disturbed.

In accordance with the writ of the Lady of Blue, offer azure-textured silk ninety feet, or nine feet, to the Nine Qi Heavenly Lords as a token of deliverance.

We further invoke the descent of the Three Qi Cinnabar Heaven’s Vermilion Numinous Life-Spirit Perfected Ones, accompanied by the immortals of the Southern Marchmount, riding three thousand myriad chariots of Vermilion Dragons, bearing the Three Qi celestial writ talismanic commands of the Red Emperor and Lady of Blue. They descend to the numinous officials of the nine earths of the southern region, opening the Long Night’s abode and the Nine Nether Hells, to extricate Wang Jia’s hun-soul and spirit, returning them to his former abode. Those who should be transformed shall be transformed; those who should be delivered shall be delivered; those who should be reborn shall be reborn; those who should return shall return. Those not yet reborn shall have their corporeal forms pacified and illuminated, sustained and protected, so that none may be disturbed.

As in the *Scripture of Lady Blue*,
with crimson-scripted silk eighty feet in length—or eight feet—offered to the Lords of the Three Qi,
as a token of deliverance.
Again, invoke the descent of the Yellow Numinous Life-Spirit Perfected Sovereign of the One Qi, Yellow Heaven,
accompanied by the immortals of the Central Marchmount,
riding twelve thousand chariots of Yellow Dragons,
bearing the One Qi celestial writ talismanic commands of the Yellow Emperor and Lady Blue.
They descend to the limitless, boundless, measureless, depthless, fathomless, endless Earthly Bureau of the Central Realm and all its numinous officials,
opening the Long Night’s abode and the Nine Nether Hells,
to rescue Wang Jia’s hun-soul and spirit,
returning them to his former abode.
Those who should be transformed shall be transformed;
those who should be delivered shall be delivered;
those who should be reborn shall be reborn;
those who should return shall return.
Those not yet reborn shall have their corporeal forms pacified and illuminated,
sustained and protected,
so that none may be disturbed.

As in the *Scripture of Lady Blue*,
with yellow-scripted silk one hundred twenty feet in length—or twelve feet—offered to the Lord of the One Qi,
as a token of deliverance.
Again, invoke the descent of the White Numinous Life-Spirit Perfected Ones of the Seven Qi, White Heaven,
accompanied by the immortals of the Western Marchmount,
riding seventy million chariots of White Dragons,
bearing the Seven Qi celestial writ talismanic commands of the White Emperor and Lady Blue.
They descend to the numinous officials of the nine earths of the western region,
opening the Long Night’s abode and the Nine Nether Hells,
to extricate Wang Jia’s hun-soul and spirit,
returning them to his former abode.
Those who should be transformed shall be transformed;
those who should be delivered shall be delivered;
those who should be reborn shall be reborn;
those who should return shall return.
Those not yet reborn shall have their corporeal forms pacified and illuminated,
sustained and protected,
so that none may be disturbed.

As in the *Scripture of Lady Blue*,
with black-scripted silk fifty feet in length—or five feet—offered to the Lords of the Five Qi,
as a token of deliverance.
Again, invoke the descent of the Dark Numinous Life-Spirit Perfected Ones of the Five Qi, Dark Heaven,
accompanied by the immortals of the Northern Marchmount,
riding fifty million chariots of Dark Dragons,
bearing the Five Qi celestial writ talismanic commands of the Black Emperor and Lady Blue.
They descend to the numinous officials of the nine earths of the northern region,
opening the Long Night’s abode and the Nine Nether Hells,
to extricate Wang Jia’s hun-soul and spirit,
returning them to his former abode.
Those who should be transformed shall be transformed;
those who should be delivered shall be delivered;
those who should be reborn shall be reborn;
those who should return shall return.
Those not yet reborn shall have their corporeal forms pacified and illuminated,
sustained and protected,
so that none may be disturbed.

Further, with five taels of gold—or fifty catties of iron—offered to the Five Emperors,
to pacify and secure the Five Directions.
Wang Jia now falls within the precedent of deliverance:
the earthly officials of the nine lands shall each attend to their jurisdictions,
providing sustenance and protection,
ensuring the stability of his form and the guardianship of his spirit,
so that his po-soul shall not scatter.
They shall await the completion of the ritual,
when he shall return to his former abode,
cross the ford and be reborn.
May the Five Emperors nourish him with the sweetness of Grand Harmony’s primordial essence,
guide his qi and nurture his spirit,
imbue him with the Three Luminaries,
infuse him with the dark flow of the vast source,
so that jade mushrooms spontaneously flourish within him,
his radiance soon gleams,
his sweet dew soon fragrances,
his hun-soul ascends to the Upper Clarity,
his clothing and sustenance arise naturally,
and he descends to dwell in his palace,
united with the light,
never again parted from it,
together receiving transformation and rebirth.

Today is a day of great celebration,
when the deliverance of beings is measureless.
All within the Earthly Bureau shall comply,
reverently upholding the ancient statutes,
and inscribing their merit across the heavens.
Those who defy the *Scripture of Lady Blue*
shall have their offices abolished and their forms punished,
as clearly stipulated in the old regulations,
with golden dragons hastening the decree.

Respectfully submitted for your consideration,
awaiting your response.
Your servant, Wang Jia, prostrates himself in awe and dread,
bowing twice in reverence to report.
Your servant, [Name], of [Prefecture], [County], [Township], [Village].

Supreme, supreme, supreme—One Qi, One Qi!
Supreme, supreme, supreme—boundless, without summit,
without color, without light,
vast and transcendent, the Perfected of the Great Dao,
the Primordial Celestial Worthy,
the Thirty-Two Emperors,
the Most High Lord of the Great Dao,
His August Jade Majesty of the Grand Clarity.

In the year [X] of the Great Era, the [X] month, the first day of the [X] month, at the [X] hour,
at [Prefecture], [County], [Township], [Village],
a memorial on yellow silk,
presented via golden dragon.

According to the ancient canons of *Lady Blue*,
this text is inscribed in vermilion on yellow silk.
The master, at the place where the deceased lies,
at the hour of the rat, facing north,
burns five incense fires,
performs the Five Pacifications,
and presents the yellow silk memorial.
The text is exposed to the open air for one night;
at dawn the following day,
it is buried in the corresponding direction,
to pacify the spirits and stabilize the form.

For those who perform this rite,
the *Scripture of Lady Blue* states:
the nine generations of ancestral souls in the Long Night
shall all emerge into the light,
their names recorded in the Heavenly Register,
their offenses expunged by the Three Officials,
and after thirty-two years,
they shall regain their former forms and be reborn.
For those not yet reborn,
their remains in the former abode shall be guarded by the Five Emperors,
protected by the earthly deities,
comforted and sustained,
so that none may be disturbed.
Within a hundred years,
none shall fail to be transformed and restored to the human realm.

The ledgers of the Three Realms are most precise:
the wise discern their profound principles,
examining good and evil,
karma and retribution,
knowing these words are not empty.
The foolish submit to fate,
denying their truth—
how pitiable their suffering in the Three Officials’ burning charcoal!

The Perfected of the Celestial Truth said:
In the era of Red Clarity,
there was a Daoist named Zheng Ren’an,
whose merit was incomplete when he died in the northern wastes of Mount Chang.
His son, Zhongming,
studied under Master Xuanhe
and used this text to pacify Ren’an’s remains in his palace for thirty years.
Ren’an was delivered and destined to return to the human realm,
but his body was burned by barbarians.
His form arose in dark majesty,
and he now serves as the Elder Lord of the Southern Palace.
The traces of his attainment are inscribed in the Southern Pavilion of the Supreme Ultimate,
most clearly recorded.

The Perfected of the Celestial Truth said:
In the kingdom of Shànrěn,
there was a Daoist named Xian Xinran,
who studied under the Eternal Youth
and received the transmission of the *Lingbao Scripture of Extinction and Ascension*.
His merit incomplete,
he died in the Heaven of Azure Origin,
his remains interred in the Land of Flowing Life.
The Eternal Youth used this text to pacify his form,
and after a hundred years,
when a great flood swept it away,
he was transformed and reborn.
He now bears the title of Elder Lord of Primordial Numinosity.

In the Southern Palace, his Daoist traces are recorded in the Purple Tenuity’s Hall.

The Perfected of the Celestial Truth said:
In the world of Abandoned Worthiness, there was a Daoist surnamed Hào, styled Fūmíng. From youth, he loved mountains and rivers, abandoned his home to study afar, but his merit unfulfilled, he died beneath the Earth-Mirror Mountain. His son, Shàoxìn, sought the Northern Outer Master and received this text to pacify the form of Fūmíng’s corpse. After seven hundred years of refinement by water and fire, he was restored to life among men. Later, he studied under Master Black Text and received the transmission of ascension to heaven. He now serves as the Elder Lord of the Mysterious.

In the Southern Palace, his Daoist traces are recorded in the Northern Origin’s Mysterious Window.

The Perfected of the Celestial Truth said:
In the Southern Pear World of the Middle Origin Heaven, there was a Daoist surnamed Wáng, styled Dùmíng. From youth, he traveled to study and received from Master Tú the True the transmission of the *Five Chapters on Ascending as an Immortal*. His merit incomplete, he died in the eastern mountains’ broad and numinous vale. His son, Jǐngxiù, sought Master Dài Zhòngjūn and received this text to pacify his corpse. After ninety years, when the eastern mountains suffered great famine and people dug the earth for food, they unearthed his corpse, and he was immediately transformed and reborn. Later, his Dao perfected, he ascended to heaven and became the Perfected of the Scenic Empyrean.

The Perfected of the Celestial Truth said:
All these gentlemen accumulated learning and neared extinction, their Daoist work nearly complete, when they received this text and were restored to life among men. All transcended the void, stepped through the emptiness, ascended to the Golden Gates, and received titles by nature.

Their deeds stretch far into the distant past, beyond the understanding of common men. Examining those closer to our time: Master Yǎnmén studied under Night Radiance, Master Gāoqiū studied under Master Stone, and Master Hóngyá studied under the Metal Mother. All received the *Lingbao Scripture of Extinction and the Five Refinements* and the transmission of ascension to heaven.

Master Yǎnmén died in Chángqiū Mountain of Lù County in Yúyáng. Master Gāoqiū died in Gāofù Mountain of Wénxǐ County in Zhōngshān. Master Hóngyá died in Làng Mountain of Gūzāng County in Wǔwēi. All received this text to pacify their tombs.

After several decades, Master Yǎnmén’s tomb collapsed, and his form transformed. Later, he entered the Golden Court of the Great Cavern of Mount Méng and received the scriptures, becoming a Minister of Immortals. After seventy-two years, Master Gāoqiū’s tomb collapsed and was opened by men. His coffin was raised, and his form took flight. He now serves as the Perfected of the Central Marchmount. After one hundred twenty years, Master Hóngyá’s tomb opened, and his corpse’s form soared aloft. He received the scriptures and became the Perfected of Green City.

All these worthies received the method of extinction, the transmission of ascension, and the Dao of pacifying the numinous. Thus, they ascended the lofty void, soared through the high clouds, roamed in leisure through the Purple Tenuity, and received the title of Perfected.

These recent events are no longer distant transmissions. The Heavenly King of the Primordial Beginning now reveals the treasure store of the Primordial Beginning to the Supreme Ultimate’s Transcendents. Those who encounter it will transcend ten thousand kalpas of past lives, their names recorded in the Upper Clarity, and they shall attain the Dao of immortality.

O men and women of the heavens, how can you fail to heed the decree of the *Nüqīng*? Treasure and guard it in secret.
