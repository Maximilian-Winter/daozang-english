**The Supreme Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure Scripture on the Natural Wondrous Rotation of Heaven and Earth**

**Scripture Title:** *The Supreme Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure Scripture on the Natural Wondrous Rotation of Heaven and Earth*. Author unknown, likely composed during the Northern and Southern Dynasties. Not recorded in the *Catalogue of Numinous Treasure Scriptures*. One scroll. Base text from the *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, Cavernous Mystery Division, *Original Texts* category.

The Dao speaks: The Supreme Numinous Treasure existed before heaven and earth, and only thereafter did heaven and earth come into being. Numbers arise from one, stand upon three, are completed in five, flourish in seven, and reach their limit in nine. Thus, heaven is ninety thousand *li* from earth, accumulating yang qi. The Dao’s yin forms spread across Kunlun, serving as the earth’s pillar. Where qi ascends to Kunlun is the center of the earth. Kunlun extends eastward one hundred million six thousand five hundred *li*, westward one hundred million six thousand five hundred *li*, southward one hundred million six thousand five hundred *li*, and northward one hundred million six thousand seven hundred fifty *li*. The earth’s circumference traverses four directions, totaling four hundred million two thousand six hundred twenty-five *li*.

The Dao speaks: The sun and moon each span a thousand *li* in diameter and three thousand *li* in circumference, traversing eighty-one domains in their rotation, alternating between obscurity and darkness. The nine stars of the Northern Dipper—two yin stars unseen—are separated by ninety thousand *li*, sinking and moistening eighty-one provinces and eight hundred ten domains. The Northern Dipper hovers above Kunlun, embracing it, and its qi circulates throughout the world: in spring and summer as dew, in autumn and winter as frost and snow. Humans are akin to heaven and earth. Beyond the eight directions of heaven and earth, the myriad beings receive their natures, all harboring sorrow and suffering, constantly harming the people. Those with blood and breath, wriggling and moving, cannot attain freedom; they contend with heaven and earth for their fate, all destined for death. Bones decay and enter the earth; spirits soar and wander, revolving through the five destinies. Those who do good ascend to heaven; those who do evil sink into the abyss. All the good and evil deeds of a person’s life follow their spirit, soul, and ethereal soul in accordance with their blessings and misfortunes. Only by studying the Dao and seeking life, comprehending the ultimate rotation and deliverance, can one attain long-lasting existence and restore the yang of the ninefold rotation.

The Dao speaks: Human life begins in the womb, enduring ten months. Death arrives like a great wind, sudden and without warning, striking at any time. One must contend with the heart, doing good without hesitation. Thus, this scripture urges and encourages scholars: what the eye does not see, what the ear does not hear, and rare treasures—what benefit do they bring to the self? All who pursue the Dao must trust the scripture’s sincerity, uphold goodness unto death, and avoid evil in life. The Dao must not be lost; virtue must not be violated. To violate the Dao and lose virtue is like a child born without a mother, like a fish cast from the deep. If one aspires to study, revolving through death and life is like a silkworm in its cocoon, muddled and confused. Thus, when form and fate suddenly transform, the Dao is achieved in subtlety. Prolonged fasting and scripture recitation are the roots of virtue. Naturally, one attains profound comprehension of rotation and deliverance, transcending divine methods, and receives the veneration of the Supreme Jade Capital.

Thus, a hymn is composed:
*In my declining years, a hundred ailments assail me.*
*Ice melts and fire arises; calamities strike, dissolving my form.*
*A hundred bones separate; the great kalpa is about to collapse.*
*I fear this pain and seek the Dao, longing for eternal life.*
*Leaving behind the burdens of this dusty world,*
*I join that realm of ultimate stillness and purity.*
*Lofty conduct aspires to the Great Vehicle;*
*naturally, the study of the Dao is perfected.*
*Revolving with unsurpassed virtue,*
*I forget the self and thus remain nameless.*
*Serene wisdom crosses the eight difficulties;*
*carefree, what else is there to seek?*

The Dao speaks: Of all beings, humans alone are noble. Having received life, one should nurture and fulfill it. Yet, greed for wealth and stinginess prevent generosity. Serving teachers and treasures to seek ascension and deliverance—who reflects upon this? This body is not one’s own; wealth and treasures are not one’s own. Official ranks and salaries are heavy burdens—what benefit do they bring to the self? Old age, illness, and death cannot be averted. Unable to extricate oneself for the Dao, one adorns the self with vanity, believing life is sufficient. This is like a land bird cherishing its tail, only to be captured by the archer. Scholars must diligently align their hearts with the highest, knowing that none of these follow the spirit and soul in death—vainly enduring hardship. One must contemplate the root of deliverance, sever the paths of the three evils, and enter the three paths of goodness: first, no aging; second, no illness; third, no death. Attaining long life and deliverance from the world, escaping calamities, and encountering the rotation, one becomes a guest of the Supreme. Thus, a hymn is composed:
*Reflecting on old age and illness, the great afflictions of the three realms,*
*blessings exhausted, life nearing its end, breath ceases, and one enters the coffin.*
*Darkly becoming dust and ash, spirit and soul find no moment’s peace.*
*I fear this fate and study the Dao, free from premature decay.*
*Gathering the mind to preserve true purity,*
*cultivating the heart, surely it is worthy of contemplation.*
*Delighting in the garden of the Three Treasures,*
*I naturally subdue demonic officials.*
*Thus, I offer my body in alms,*
*my resolve transcending the shore of life and death.*
*In utter freedom, without dependence,*
*I eternally preserve joy for countless ages.*

The Dao speaks: Those who cultivate long life aspire to ascension and deliverance, seeking the Dao of non-action, transcending the dust and filth, and leaving no trace among the multitudes. They must first understand the great cycle of heaven and earth’s rotation, the disasters of the yang nine and six, and escape calamities to attain peace. If one does not act accordingly, even if one seeks the Dao year after year, hoping for ascension, the effort will be in vain—ultimately, it will be futile labor. Now, I reveal to you the periods of kalpas and rotations, the divisions of expansion and contraction. Preserve the body, seek life, and attain long life—not merely for this single body, but also to return the seven ancestors to the womb.

The Perfected Immortal says: Those who study the Dao with precision and comprehend the rotation and deliverance of the yang nine and six will surely attain deliverance from the world without peril. The essentials lie in prolonged fasting, deep contemplation, distancing oneself from worldly affairs, and forgetting both thoughts and burdens. Only then can one hope for the ascension of the flesh.

If even a single flaw remains, one cannot be called eternal. Seek the Ten Admonitions of the Supreme Pole Perfected One:

Red writ emerges from earth’s governance,
Gold and jade return as husband and wife.
At the Blue Dragon’s jia-shen conjunction,
Who can foresee its sudden arrival?
Though adorned with celestial water script,
The treasure awaits the Prince’s appointed hour.
At the hour of chen, colors shall transform—
First glimpsed in the eyes of Hu children.

Kun-yuan reaches its fullness,
Jishi remains untamed.
O learned scholars who rise aloft,
In the era after Heaven, serve Heaven’s time.
Blessings do not pass in a single dawn—
Seven generations lay the foundation of goodness.
When peace aligns at Meng Ford,
How joyous and radiant it shall be!

At the Metal Horse’s end of the Dark Cycle,
The Ancient Moon invades the Divine Continent.
On land, no sons remain;
Brothers wander in turn.
The sons of River and Luo are spent,
Yan and Zhao become vast floods.
Jingyang’s willows follow in order,
At the hour of si, the Central Peak’s talisman appears.
When the awned grain perishes in ten years,
The Eastern Sea’s mulberry fields become a realm of roaming.

First enter the blessed land,
Refine the body with the Eight Stones.
Liu City is the land of rebirth—
The Hidden Dragon need not fret.
Jade shoots draw near the world,
Paulownia and cypress are easily sought.
Ding-hai is not far—
The Eight Lords gather as one.

Darkness gives birth to floating purple clouds,
Instructing the Ninefold Numinous Child.
Before the decree can avert calamity’s fullness,
Thunder and lightning cannot be halted.
It arises in the years of shen and you,
Pervading and lingering for ten epochs.
When the Water Dragon’s time arrives,
The Immortal Lords shall at last rise.

Eighteen bow-mouthed youths,
Chanting in harmonious order.
A hundred officials stand in solemn ranks,
All reverent and foremost in virtue.
Diligently emulate Song and Qiao—
When the kalpa ends, you shall have delivered yourself.
In peaceful days, wander belt-loosed,
Each thread recording your robes’ folds.

Master Fangping records the Great Bird,
Which shall soar to the southeast in days to come.
The foolish see not what is to come,
While the wise unfold the divine prescriptions.
The outskirts drown at summer’s beginning,
Venus loses its constant measure.
Clouds and mists all transform—
Fish and turtles swim in boundless seas.
All at once, the Eastern Sea is submerged,
Never again shall the descendants of Zi and Shang rise.

At the Ren-wu Southern Peak,
Yin is made into yang.
In Yangzhou, one may transcend the world—
Recite the *Life-Generating Chapters* in due time.
The Zhang clan’s crane cries,
Discerning the weft at the Metal Horse’s end.
White turns to harm within,
Scholars never loosen their sashes.
Officials and soldiers all flee,
Bandits grow daily more fierce.
Though the Ninefold Palace is clad in robes,
Its palace walls crumble in time.
Thorns grow in the courtyard,
Princes and lords perish to barbarian raiders.
Wives and daughters vanish to foreign lands,
Servitude knows no respite.
Their plight is truly lamentable—
Across a thousand years, shall they ever reunite?

Far better to study the Dao early,
Dwelling in the mists of the empyrean.
Cultivate learning under the Libationers,
And practice the methods with diligence.
If one is not vigilant in the one hundred and eighty days,
When the time comes, it will be like being scorched by fire.
Soon in the Jin clan’s era,
This must be spoken of.
Blades and swords converge from four directions—
Not a single day can be delayed.
Then the great calamity shall arrive,
Vast and boundless as the heavens.
Corpses wander with none to behold them—
The sages know this to be true.

First study and awaken to the Mystic Capital,
Then meet the famous mountains in your heart.
In the sacred land of gathered hems,
The Supreme Dao is the numinous ancestor.
At Pingdu, brush and ink are expounded—
The blessed land is surely worth journeying to.
In geng-chen, Qiang and Hu stir;
In ren-wu, rare rewards await.
First dwell in the land of blessings,
Chanting loftily to nurture oneself.
Gazing a myriad leagues, no smoke is seen—
Yet ren-chen’s misfortunes are not yet dispelled.
When the Immortal Lords govern in peace,
The eight directions’ nets are stilled.
As with my Jade Axe’s grace,
Forever parting from the dust of the world.

Why covet glory and rank?
Here, cast aside all dark thoughts.
Confucius bequeathed the *Luminous Treasury*,
Wood and earth seem to share a cause.
Mount Zeng is a place to wander,
The Nine Yi brush away light dust.
In a humble hut, guard emptiness and stillness,
Profound silence steeped in dark mystery.
Springs surge without replenishing their source—
Mao Metal harms no one.
Curved blades bring no pain—
Yet in this world, they wound your body.

One may visit Mount Taihe,
Yanmen reveals its luminous truth.
The Deer Hall is truly precious—
Harmony prevails until ren-chen.
When the Eighteen come to govern,
The children shall unite with the luminous truth.
The land of Wu abounds in immortals,
While Jing and Xiang suffer the deepest poverty.
How can Liu Valley be relied upon?
Threefold the merit of Yao’s era.
Only then shall you know hardship—
When the Sage Emperor emerges to govern.
This begins in ren-chen,
When the bright star shines upon the jellyfish.
After shen, ten epochs linger—
The Great Bird gathers in the southeast.

Blood fills the city gates,
Swarming rats climb lofty trees.
The multitude cannot be stopped—
Women enter the palace and court.
Dragons and clouds have no equal—
The foolish say it is not so,
While the wise stand firm in their own right.

The Dao speaks: The Numinous Treasure naturally operates in cycles—there are the Great Yang-Nine and Great Hundred-Six, the Lesser Yang-Nine and Lesser Hundred-Six. Three thousand three hundred years form the Lesser Yang-Nine and Lesser Hundred-Six; nine thousand nine hundred years form the Great Yang-Nine and Great Hundred-Six. Heaven’s adversity is called Yang-Nine, Earth’s depletion is called Hundred-Six. By the time of the Jin clan, in the jia-shen year, these are the cycles of fortune and misfortune through which Heaven and Earth pass. The Yang-Nine will converge, and when that time comes, the Dao and its virtue shall be made manifest, calamities and evils shall be swiftly eradicated, and the Sage Sovereign shall assume his mandate in the ren-chen year.

These are the ten discourses of the Supreme Pole Perfected One—divine subtleties flow smoothly, profound principles shine in the void. The reckoning of cyclical destiny and the essentials of departure and arrival may be called thorough; they may be called exhaustive.

The Dao speaks: If one can constantly recite and meditate upon its hidden rhythms, one shall traverse the great disasters of the Yang-Nine and receive office in the ding-hai year. This requires first observing a prolonged fast in stillness, silently cutting off the clamor of worldly entanglements. Only then may one seek the subtle purport of liberation, uttering pure sounds from the lips. Thus shall the seven ancestors return to the womb, one’s own body endure forever, pass unharmed through the revolutions of the ages, and ascend as an immortal.

Wondrous and subtle indeed—beyond what words can express! Should you encounter this, you shall ascend to roam the Jade Capital, serving as the Sage Emperor’s shepherd to govern and order the people.

The Dao speaks: The protocols for transmission, as I have cited from ancient scriptures, require a twenty-four-day purification fast, along with the separate offering of five taels of refined gold and a hundred feet of cinnabar-ground brocade as a covenant. The recipient must uphold and practice this. Should one recklessly transmit it without following the protocols, the Wind Blade shall mete out punishment. Let the recipient take diligent care and act with utmost caution.
