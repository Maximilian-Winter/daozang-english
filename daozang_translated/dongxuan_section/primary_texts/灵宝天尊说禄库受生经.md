At that time, the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy was in the Pure Bright Land of the Floating Gauze World, beneath the Seven Treasures Tree on Mount Good Accumulation, expounding the wondrous Dharma to an immeasurable assembly of flying heavenly deities and hosts of immortals and sages. Suddenly, nine-colored radiant light emanated, universally illuminating the karmic retributions of good and evil among all beings across the ten directions—some noble, some base, some wealthy, some impoverished.

The great assembly, harboring doubts about these beings and their respective fruits, dared not inquire. Then, the Perfected One of Radiant and Wondrous Sound arose from his seat, adjusted his robes and cap, prostrated, and knelt with reverence, addressing the Heavenly Worthy: "Just now, I witnessed your awe-inspiring light illuminating the ten directions. Beings—whether male or female, rich or poor, noble or lowly—experience suffering and joy differently. What distinct causes do these beings possess? I humbly beseech your sagely compassion to grant us the decisive teaching in response to this plea."

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "Excellent, excellent. Return to your seat, compose your spirit in silence, and listen single-mindedly."

The Heavenly Worthy declared: "All beings across the ten directions belong to the celestial bureaus in life and are subject to the earthly hells in death. On the day they attain human form, they once borrowed 'life-receiving money' from the underworld treasuries governed by the dark offices. Their wealth and nobility are recorded in the ledgers of destiny. Those who are poor and lowly, however, have been indebted to the dark offices from kalpa to kalpa, their blessings seized for repayment. In the world, they suffer privation, for the dark officials have deducted their yang blessings to settle their yin debts. Thus, nobility and baseness, wealth and poverty, suffering and joy differ—you should reflect and understand this."

The Heavenly Worthy continued: "Long ago, I bestowed a single Jeweled Tree upon the Northern Emperor of Fengdu, planting it in the nether capital to clearly observe the karmic retributions of all beings. I also granted three divine arrows and three spirit bows to men and women who attain human rebirth. They take up these bows and arrows and shoot at the Jeweled Tree. Those who strike the eastern branch attain official rank and long life. Those who strike the southern branch attain extended years and robust health. Those who strike the western branch attain wealth, nobility, and splendor. Those who strike the northern branch attain poverty, hardship, and suffering. This Jeweled Tree is the condition of karmic retribution.

"If, in life, one reveres the Three Treasures, practices expedient generosity, establishes vegetarian feasts, recites scriptures, cultivates various good conditions, and—following my teachings—recites this scripture and burns repayment for the 'life-receiving money,' one will attain a male body for three lifetimes. Even upon death, one will not pass through hell but will regain human form. If Fengdu were to use the bows and arrows to shoot at the Jeweled Tree, I would employ my divine power to support them, preventing them from striking the northern branch, so they may again attain a noble and prosperous body.

"If, however, one is miserly, greedy, and deluded in life, disbelieves in the scriptures and Dharma, defaults on debts, harbors jealousy, neglects good causes, and only cultivates evil, their name will be recorded in the ledgers of sin. The celestial bureaus will reduce their lifespan, and they will default on the 'life-receiving money' owed to the dark offices. If they do not repay in life but instead deceive and falsify, upon death they will enter hell, and only after ten thousand kalpas will they be reborn as beasts, cycling through karmic retribution. Even if they regain human form, they will again take up the divine bow and sacred arrows, and their natural karmic retribution will strike the northern branch. Though born human, they will be poor, lowly, and disbelieve in the retribution of good causes."

The Perfected One again addressed the Heavenly Worthy: "I have not yet understood from which dark bureau and treasury one borrows the 'life-receiving money' at birth, nor to which treasury one repays it in life. Though you have enlightened us, this cause remains obscure. I humbly beseech your compassionate presence to distinguish it for the assembly."

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "At the moment of human birth, there are twelve yearly palaces, each governed by an official who oversees the treasuries of destiny. I shall now reveal to you the names and affiliations of the twelve bureau officials.

- Those born in the *zi* year owe 13,000 strings of cash, belonging to the First Treasury, governed by the official surnamed Li.
- Those born in the *chou* year owe 280,000 strings of cash, belonging to the Second Treasury, governed by the official surnamed Tian.
- Those born in the *yin* year owe 80,000 strings of cash, belonging to the Third Treasury, governed by the official surnamed Lei.
- Those born in the *mao* year owe 80,000 strings of cash, belonging to the Fourth Treasury, governed by the official surnamed Liu.
- Those born in the *chen* year owe 50,000 strings of cash, belonging to the Fifth Treasury, governed by the official surnamed Yuan.
- Those born in the *si* year owe 70,000 strings of cash, belonging to the Sixth Treasury, governed by the official surnamed Ji.
- Those born in the *wu* year owe 260,000 strings of cash, belonging to the Seventh Treasury, governed by the official surnamed Xu.
- Those born in the *wei* year owe 100,000 strings of cash, belonging to the Eighth Treasury, governed by the official surnamed Zhu.
- Those born in the *shen* year owe 40,000 strings of cash, belonging to the Ninth Treasury, governed by the official surnamed Che.
- Those born in the *you* year owe 50,000 strings of cash, belonging to the Tenth Treasury, governed by the official surnamed Zheng.
- Those born in the *xu* year owe 25,000 strings of cash, belonging to the Eleventh Treasury, governed by the official surnamed Cheng.
- Those born in the *hai* year owe 9,000 strings of cash, belonging to the Twelfth Treasury, governed by the official surnamed Kang."

The Heavenly Worthy further stated: "The twelve bureau officials of the preceding palaces each oversee the 'life-receiving money' borrowed by those born under their jurisdiction. Upon attaining human form, one pledges the money of their original destiny, petitioning to have it recorded in the ledgers of the Treasury of Life-Receiving Destiny, which aligns with the registers of the dark offices."

The Perfected One said: "I have not yet understood the names, positions, and amounts of money associated with these original destinies. I again beseech your compassion to fully expound upon them."

The Heavenly Worthy smiled and replied: "Excellent. You should strive to act for the sake of all beings. I shall now further expound upon the names and amounts of money for the twelve original destinies."

Those born in the *zi* hour have as their original destiny Liu Wenzhen; upon attaining human form, they pledge 7,000 strings of cash. Those born in the *chou* hour have as their original destiny Meng Hou; upon attaining human form, they pledge 9,000 strings of cash. Those born in the *yin* hour have as their original destiny Zhong Yuan; upon attaining human form, they pledge 6,000 strings of cash. Those born in the *mao* hour have as their original destiny Hao Yuan; upon attaining human form, they pledge 10,000 strings of cash. Those born in the *chen* hour have as their original destiny Li Wenliang; upon attaining human form, they pledge 5,400 strings of cash. Those born in the *si* hour have as their original destiny Cao Jiao; upon attaining human form, they pledge 1,000 strings of cash. Those born in the *wu* hour have as their original destiny Zhang Si; upon attaining human form, they pledge 9,000 strings of cash. Those born in the *wei* hour have as their original destiny Sun Gong; upon attaining human form, they pledge 4,000 strings of cash. Those born in the *shen* hour have as their original destiny Du Zhun; upon attaining human form, they pledge 8,000 strings of cash. Those born in the *you* hour have as their original destiny Tian Jiaoyou; upon attaining human form, they pledge 5,000 strings of cash. Those born in the *xu* hour have as their original destiny Cui Jianjin; upon attaining human form, they pledge 5,000 strings of cash. Those born in the *hai* hour have as their original destiny Wang Shuang; upon attaining human form, they pledge 6,000 strings of cash.

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy addressed the fourfold assembly, saying: "If there are faithful men and women who delight in the scriptural Dharma, and who, in accordance with this sutra, establish ritual precincts, prepare incense and flowers, adorn with lamps and candles, and make offerings to the Three Treasures of the Great Dao and the Perfected Sages, performing the six periods of ritual circumambulation, reciting the sutra ten times, observing fasts and holding jiao rites—if they duly prepare the full amount of their 'life-receiving money' and the pledged wealth of their original destiny, clearly itemizing each, and present a memorial petition to burn and return it to their respective treasury, they shall in this very life obtain blessings, honor, and noble karmic rewards, and in future lives forever be free from suffering and hardship. If there are beings who disbelieve in these karmic conditions and instead generate evil karma, once they descend into the Nine Springs, if they do not fully confess, they shall endure the retributions of suffering and joy in the cycle of birth and death. You, great assembly, should each reflect and take heed."

Then, the Perfected One of Resplendent and Wondrous Sound, together with the assembled immortals, the North Emperor of Fengdu, the Underworld Officials of Yama, the clerks of the Treasury of Life-Receiving Destiny, the original destinies of each, and all present in the assembly, bowed their heads in reverence, gazed upon the honored countenance, prostrated, and withdrew.

Thereupon, the Perfected One of Resplendent and Wondrous Sound transmitted the teaching to the world, delivering the living and the deceased, praising and propagating it with joy. All received and upheld it with faith.

*The Sutra of the Treasury of Life-Receiving Destiny, Spoken by the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy, is now complete.*
