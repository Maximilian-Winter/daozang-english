The Dao spoke: Long ago, upon ascending Mount Kunlun, there dwelt an old woman alone, her origins unknown. At that time, the Perfected One of Wondrous Conduct addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: "This old woman—who is she, dwelling alone in these mountains without fear?"

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "This old woman is called the Mother of Kindling Fire. She ascends to commune with the celestial realms and descends to govern the Five Phases, penetrating the numinous and observing the two *qi*. In heaven, she is the Celestial Emperor; among humans, she is the Controller of Destiny. She also serves as the Messenger of the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper, overseeing the length of human life, wealth and poverty, honor and lowliness, and the distribution of official emoluments. Moreover, she is the Stove Lord of the Five Emperors, presiding over human dwellings. Through the twelve double-hours, she knows all affairs of the mortal world. On the first day of each month, she records the good and evil deeds of people, weighing their merits and transgressions. At midnight, she submits her report to the celestial bureaus, where the registers are determined—all by this mother.

Every household stove has its prohibitions. If these are not observed, this mother can bring misfortune, which cannot be avoided."

The Perfected One of Wondrous Conduct said: "What prohibitions exist for household stoves? I venture to ask this question, hoping for your instruction. I see that sentient beings, unaware of these matters, wish to inform the men and women of the impure world, that all may observe them and attain peace and stability."

The Heavenly Worthy said: "Listen carefully. In household stoves, one must not use chicken feathers, dog bones, human hair, unclean firewood, or defiled objects, lest the Stove Deity be offended. This will bring unrest to men and women, futile prayers, illnesses and sores, madness and miasmic plagues, dimmed vision, disordered dreams, failed harvests and silkworm crops, depletion of livestock, fearless malevolent spirits invading the home, strange occurrences with chickens and dogs, theft and encroachment, groundless quarrels, bewitchment of men and women, official imprisonment, and the ruin of family fortunes—all caused by such offenses.

If such calamities arise, one must swiftly make amends. Invoke the Stove Lords of the Five Directions: the Azure Emperor of the East, the Vermilion Emperor of the South, the White Emperor of the West, the Black Emperor of the North, and the Yellow Emperor of the Center; the consorts of the Five Stove Lords of the Five Directions; the Numinous Stove of the Celestial Kitchen and the Divine Stove of the Earthly Kitchen; the Heavenly Emperor’s favored sons and daughters; the Hearth Child; the boys and girls of the stove; the ancestral stoves and former stoves; the Stove Lord and Stove Lady; the Stove Husband and Stove Wife; the Stove Sons and Stove Grandsons; the household stoves and outer stoves; the great stoves and small stoves; the long stoves and short stoves; the new stoves and old stoves; the Stove Lords who roam the Five Directions; the Left and Right Generals; the Divine Maidens of the Cooking Waves; the Front and Rear Attendants; the Stove Lord’s minor messengers; the Mother of Advancing Fire; the Fire-Roaming Boys; the Stove Housewife; her sisters and daughters-in-law; the seventy-two stove attendants; the divine assembly and disciples; and all members of your household, great and small.

As ordinary people unaware of prohibitions, you have often offended. Without self-awareness, you may have built stoves facing east or west, north or south; pointed knives at the stove, disturbing the honored deities; raised your voices while drunk, uttering reckless and lewd words; poked the fire with your feet; exposed your bodies; defiled the stove with men and women; cooked foul and rank meats; sung in the kitchen; shouted before the stove. This has caused the three disasters to arise, a hundred spirits to manifest, wealth to dissipate, illnesses to linger, silkworm crops to fail, official ranks to stagnate, trade to yield no profit, homes to decline, evil people to plot harm, livestock to fail to breed, dreams to become disordered, and prayers to go unanswered.

You must now sincerely repent and offer atonement."

The Heavenly Worthy said: "If you recite this with such devotion, misfortune will surely be dispelled. For the sake of sentient beings in the latter age, I shall summon this mother to descend with great numinous efficacy, pardoning transgressions and bestowing blessings. Your households will thrive, free from calamity for years to come. The Azure Dragon will flourish, the White Tiger will resound, the Vermilion Bird will blaze, and the Dark Warrior will stand majestic. Grudges will be subdued, thieves will hide, fires will sink into the earth, and all spirits will vanish."

Upon hearing the Heavenly Worthy’s discourse on this old woman—known as the Celestial Emperor and Controller of Destiny, who oversees the fortunes and misfortunes of humanity—the Perfected One of Wondrous Conduct composed a hymn for all beings:

The Celestial Emperor assumes his throne,
The Controller of Destiny, the Stove Lord.
When the world’s people revere him,
Fortune and emolument converge.
Disasters and plagues flee,
As we heed his teachings,
And all attain peace.

The Heavenly Worthy further instructed the Perfected One: "In the latter age, men and women who offend the Stove Lord will encounter misfortune and suffering. They must purify themselves, sweep clean, light lamps, burn incense, and invite Daoist priests to recite sutras. Call upon the names of the Stove Lord’s retinue, present offerings of money and food, and act for the benefit of others. What you receive in return—heed this well."

The Perfected One of Wondrous Conduct bowed deeply, accepting the command with faith and vowing to practice it.
