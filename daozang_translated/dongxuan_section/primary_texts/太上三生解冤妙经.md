**The Marvelous Sutra of the Most High on Resolving Karmic Grievances Across Three Lifetimes**

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy Who Rescues from Suffering in Response to Cries, accompanied by his retinue, traversed the worlds of the ten directions, transforming and delivering sentient beings, leading them out of the sea of suffering, guiding them to the true Dao, and preventing them from entering heterodox sects.

He observed that within the Western Lands there was a kingdom named Pure Brahman. The people of this land were given to lust and killing, performed few good deeds, and many sank into hell or lost their human forms. Moved by compassion for these beings, he instantly transformed his body and descended.

That night, the king dreamed of a divine messenger who announced: "Tomorrow, a celestial perfected one shall arrive from the east. Why not go forth to welcome him?" The king, unable to sleep, sat awaiting dawn. At daybreak, he assembled his ministers, consorts, imperial relatives, and all the citizens, leaving the palace to welcome the Heavenly Worthy.

Upon reaching the western outskirts of the city, they came to a great garden where pavilions stood in perfect order and flowers bloomed in profusion. There, the Heavenly Worthy sat upon a golden dragon throne within a seven-jeweled hall, attended by celestial youths. The king, his ministers, consorts, imperial relatives, and all the citizens gathered around below, gazing and listening as he expounded the wondrous Dharma of the Orthodox Unity.

Suddenly, auspicious vapors filled the garden, and heavenly flowers rained down. The assembly was filled with awe and inexpressible joy.

Then the queen and her noble consorts burned incense, prostrated themselves, and knelt to speak: "Our humble kingdom is a land of fools, where we have never before heard such a profound and wondrous Dao. Today, we have encountered it, and we count ourselves deeply fortunate. We have a small matter to present before you and humbly beseech your great compassion to grant us permission."

The Heavenly Worthy said: "Speak whatever is in your heart."

The queen replied: "The king is now advanced in years, yet we have no heir. Previously, I conceived, but within a few months, the child was lost. Even when the months were fulfilled and a child was born—whether boy or girl—some died at one or two years, others at three or five, all perishing prematurely. We know not what sins of past lives or this present existence have brought such misfortune. If you would take pity on us, we would reverently receive your instructions."

The Heavenly Worthy said: "In your past life, you were careless during pregnancy and caused the fetus to be lost. The children’s hearts harbored resentment, and thus you receive such retribution in this life. If you do not believe me, I shall summon these aggrieved spirits for you to question yourself."

The Heavenly Worthy pointed, and the queen looked to see a yaksha with a face like indigo leaves and eyes like baleful stars. It pointed at the queen and said: "In a past life, I was destined by karmic decree to be born as your child. But you were young and heedless, acting recklessly, and through carelessness, you caused my death. Now I seek to repay you. Yet because in your past life you dwelled in the Central Kingdom, revered Heaven and Earth, the sun, moon, and stars, diligently served your parents-in-law, honored your father and mother, venerated the Three Treasures, were deeply devoted to good deeds, sculpted images, commissioned sutras, spared no expense, built halls, and erected altars, exhausting your strength in acts of charity, taking pity on the distressed, and aiding the poor, you accumulated such merit that in this life you have become the queen of a small kingdom. Were it not for this good fortune, I would have killed you long ago."

Hearing this, the queen trembled with fear. Shaking, she prostrated herself before the Heavenly Worthy and said: "In a past life, I committed such deeds. Though I know it now, what use is regret? I humbly beseech the Heavenly Worthy to show me a way to resolve this, even if it means giving away all my wealth in acts of charity."

The Heavenly Worthy said: "Excellent, excellent! Though in past lives you established great merit and widely cultivated fields of blessings, you never repented or resolved the karmic knots within your body. Formerly, from the Heavenly Worthy of the Orthodox Unity, I received *The Marvelous Sutra of Resolving Karmic Grievances Across Three Lifetimes*. You should recite it with utmost sincerity, and your karmic grievances will naturally dissolve.

"Human beings are born through the union of Heaven and Earth, formed by the convergence of yin and yang. After three months, the distinction of male and female arises. They must be protected, not harmed; nurtured, not injured. Their lives are no different from those of adults. To harm or lose them is to incur a karmic debt. A single day of creating grievance brings retribution across three lifetimes—how can this not be terrifying?

"Deluded beings, relying on their youth and strength, are careless during pregnancy. They act recklessly, climbing high, leaping down, carrying heavy loads, rushing about, riding strenuously, engaging in improper relations, or suffering blows, falls, pinching, pressing, striking, or kneading. Some take harmful medicines, receive acupuncture injuries, consume poisonous fish or spoiled meat, or eat hard foods and cold drinks. Such actions often harm the fetus. Whether one inflicts this oneself or instructs others to do so, the causes of harm cannot be fully recounted. The deeds of past lives bring retribution in this present one.

"Thus, pregnancy is often plagued by illness, lingering pain, loss of appetite, difficulty in standing or walking, skin swelling and breaking, and waist pain as if pierced by an awl. Day and night pass like a year. After enduring such suffering, when the time of birth arrives, there may be many complications: days of obstructed labor, transverse or breech presentations. Relatives are terrified, and family members are filled with anxiety. At such times, the aggrieved spirits come to inflict harm, bringing extraordinary pain. Sometimes the mother lives and the child dies, or the child lives and the mother dies, or both perish, becoming spirits of untimely death. If reborn, they suffer as before; if not, they entangle and harm their relatives. But if one encounters this sutra and recites it with sincere devotion, all karmic obstructions will be completely dissolved."

Then he spoke the incantation:

*"At dawn and dusk, the turning wheel shines,
Illumining past and present."*

All beings receive their endowment of qi and take form through its transformation. Yet karmic grievances and defilements assail them across three lifetimes. The primordial unity of qi dissolves and liberates the aggrieved spirits. Upon hearing this, they scatter; upon listening, they disperse. The celestial soldiers and divine warriors uphold and protect without fail. Swiftly born, swiftly freed, each attains peace and tranquility. By the mandate of the Primordial Sovereign, this power endures without cease. Hasten, hasten, as in the statutes and decrees!

At that moment, having recited the sutra seven times, the yaksha prostrated before the Heavenly Worthy, giving thanks: "By this merit, I shall now proceed directly to the Middle Kingdom and be reborn into a family of wealth and nobility." With this, he bowed in gratitude and departed. All who heard this rejoiced greatly.

The Heavenly Worthy said: "This sutra does not merely resolve the grievances of one individual. If each of you cultivates sincere devotion and recites it a hundred times, all grievances within a nation—whether already arisen or yet to arise, regardless of the weight of their transgressions—shall be completely dissolved."

As the assembly spoke in unison, reciting the sutra together, upon reaching a hundred repetitions, they suddenly beheld dark clouds spreading in all directions. Amidst the black mist, auspicious qi descended from the heavens, and countless beings prostrated themselves, declaring: "Through the compassion of Heaven, this sutra and its teachings have been bestowed upon us. All grievances within our nation—whether of the living or the unborn, regardless of the gravity of their sins—have been wholly dissolved."

In an instant, the clouds dispersed and the mist cleared. The sky became bright and serene, and the people rejoiced, praising and giving thanks for the grace of Heaven.

The assembly then said: "By the power of the Dao, all have been universally delivered. Though we may have no grievances at present, we fear those that may arise in the future. What preemptive merit should we cultivate to forever escape this suffering?"

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "I now proclaim this *Wondrous Sutra for Resolving Grievances Across Three Lifetimes*. If there are good men and good women who burn incense and recite this sutra three times daily, all grievances bound to their persons shall be entirely eradicated. Should one copy this sutra with devotion and share it with others, their entire household shall partake in its blessings and grace. If someone suffers from weak fetal qi, frequent miscarriages, or instability, turning to this sutra in reverence will bring stability and ensure the birth of wise and virtuous children. If in dreams one often sees deceased sons or daughters, this signifies karmic grievances awaiting their return. With devotion, burn incense and pay homage to this sutra morning and evening; the aggrieved spirits will retreat, and all terrors shall cease. If someone faces great difficulty in childbirth, before the month of peril arrives, invite a Zhengyi Daoist master to burn incense and recite this sutra before the sacred images of the Three Pure Ones. Thereby, benevolent spirits will be moved to protect and assist, ensuring a smooth and natural birth, free from grievous calamities. Mother and child shall both be safe, each preserving their allotted lifespan. If one recites this sutra with utmost sincerity while walking, standing, sitting, or lying down, in future lives they shall be reborn as persons of wealth and nobility, endowed with wisdom, comely in appearance, their descendants prosperous, and their blessings boundless."

Moved by these causes and conditions, he composed a verse:

*"Beings accumulate many grievances,
Deep grievances are hard to untie.
A grievance formed in a single day
Demands repayment across three lifetimes.
I now transmit this wondrous sutra,
To dissolve all karmic grievances.
Hear and recite it with sincere devotion,
And grievances shall vanish of themselves."*

When the Heavenly Worthy had finished expounding the sutra, the immortals and great sages came to welcome him, and he journeyed to other realms to deliver all beings. Again, he addressed the king and queen: "Henceforth, if you uphold the true Dao, you shall give birth to filial and wise sons. I now bestow upon you three sacred talismans, to be written in cinnabar and swallowed. One talisman preserves the body, one repels aggrieved spirits, and one hastens a swift birth. You may teach the people of the world to revere and practice this."
