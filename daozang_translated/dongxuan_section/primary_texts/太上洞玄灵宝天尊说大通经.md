### *The Great Permeation Scripture Spoken by the Most High Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy*

#### **Chapter on True Emptiness**
It arises before Heaven yet is born without form;
It abides after Heaven yet exists without substance.
Yet without substance, it has never truly abided.
Thus is it called inconceivable.

#### **Chapter on Profound Principle**
Stillness is its nature, and the heart-mind dwells within it;
Activity is its heart-mind, and nature dwells within it.
When the heart-mind arises, nature vanishes; when the heart-mind ceases, nature appears.
Like space, it is without form—serene, perfect, and complete.

#### **Chapter on Profound Mystery**
The Great Dao is without image, thus it inwardly gathers the manifest;
True nature is without action, thus it outwardly does not generate the heart-mind.
Abiding in suchness, it is naturally boundless.
Facing circumstances yet forgetting them, it does not sink into the demons of the six thieves;
Dwelling in the dust yet transcending it, it does not fall into the transformations of the ten thousand conditions.
In perfect stillness, it does not move; in perfect harmony, it does not shift.
Its wisdom illumines the ten directions, its emptiness transforms without action.

**Verse:**
With form, one awakens to the formless;
Without cultivation, one dissolves cultivation.
Embracing the bodies of the ten thousand images,
Not a single thread is clung to.
