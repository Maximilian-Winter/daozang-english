**Scripture Title:** *The Wondrous Scripture of the Divine Treasure Elixir-Water Flying Technique for Delivering the Minor Kalpa*. Author unknown, approximately dated to the Northern and Southern Dynasties. Not recorded in the *Catalogue of Divine Treasure Scriptures*. One fascicle. Base text from the *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Wondrous Section*, *Textual Category*.

---

The Most High Lord of the Great Dao proclaimed: The Primordial Heavenly Worthy spoke, saying that when the radiance and light of the vast celestial realm exhaust their kalpic destiny, their brilliance shall be without bound, their illumination without depth, and none may abide therein. The sun and moon shall be unable to shine, the constellations unable to mark time; there shall be neither above nor below, no place to rely upon or reach, and their reckoning shall be unfathomable.

The Dao declared: Without above or below, it pervades and revolves through the cosmic cycles, lightly extending into the boundless, sinking into the profound void. These two share a single designation, their contemplation vast and still; revolving, they return to unity, ultimately merging into the mysterious and perfect. Above, they chime at the absolute summit; below, they enter the minute dust. To the left, they reach the azure vastness; to the right, they flow through the myriad rivers. The canopy of the Great Net spreads forth, the Dipper’s extremity joins the darkness; the Mysterious Capital’s Primordial Lord, in numinous motion, whirls and vanishes. Towering peaks and rocky valleys suddenly dissolve and merge.

Having cultivated the Six Perfections and dwelt in the dual practice of Brahman conduct, one ascends the celestial passes, where the celestial traces stretch boundlessly, and the root of quiescent emptiness abides. The minor cycle flows and encircles; the kalpic deliverance unfolds the primordial. The myriad heavens revolve, the fiery kalpas converge at their appointed time, and the earthly realms respond in accord, all lightly overturning. The heavens rise without limit into the abyssal origin.

The heavens are upheld by the *qian*-tree, serving as the net’s guiding principle; the earth is inhabited by humans and birds, dwelling amidst the fiery mists. When the minor kalpa’s destiny arrives, it ascends to the lofty heavens. From the heavens’ revolving deliverance, the Dark Gate is unceasing. Thereupon, the assembled spirits record and inscribe this as the "Intersection of Heaven and Earth’s Reckoning," for the minor kalpa has now converged.

The Primordial Heavenly Worthy delivered this revolving, intersecting reckoning for thirty-six myriad kalpas, a period termed the "Minor Celestial Wind’s Deliverance," the convergence of the minor kalpa. The Great Heaven encompasses three thousand nine hundred and sixty heavens, enclosing the ten directions’ myriad lesser heavens. Each heaven is governed by Perfected Ones, each with ten directional Perfected Ones. Every three hundred years, they traverse the *qian*-tree and the Human-Bird Mountain, completing what is called the "Minor Celestial Deliverance’s Convergence with the Minor Kalpa’s Cycle."

The Perfected Ones emerge from the present heaven into the Great Heaven. The Great Heaven endures three thousand nine hundred and sixty great kalpas. When the Radiant Perfected Ones have completed their rites in this heaven, it is termed the "Cycle of the Minor Kalpa’s Deliverance."

The Primordial spoke to the Radiant Perfected Ones: There are a hundred million Great Heavens, and a hundred million Grotto-Heavens on earth. One heaven endures three hundred sixty myriad kalpas, its years simultaneously exhausting—this is called the Minor Heaven. Within it dwell the Perfected Ones of the Great Grotto Realm.

When the cycle of the minor kalpa’s deliverance is complete, they reestablish their standing. The *gang*-asterism’s Five Dippers and the Seven Registers [lacuna] are first formed; the sun and moon shine brightly, and the celestial origin is newly governed. At that time, the Mysterious Deliverance emerges to transform, the scriptural Dao flows in response. The Supreme Numinous Purple Prime Lady emerges from the Numinous Radiance Heaven, accompanied by ten or so female flying celestial beings, seeking the Mysterious Deliverance from afar.

At that time, he resided upon the Five Marchmounts, suppressing the fiery mists, sweeping away calamities, and subduing all malevolence. The celestial beings, beholding the Mysterious Deliverance, paid homage amidst the Ten Absolute Void Spaces.

The Lady declared: In the distant past, before the ancient kalpic destiny had converged, the Heavenly Worthy and the Supreme Perfected Ones had already foreseen this. The Mysterious One descended with his teachings, expounding the ancient *Divine Treasure Scripture*’s sections and fascicles, which were concealed within the Great Grotto’s Mysterious Realm. Only those with immortal bones could behold its scriptural text.

Later, there was the Supreme Ultimate Perfected One, who, before attaining the Dao, dwelt amidst the world, wandering mountains to gather herbs. From the age of seven to ninety, he refrained from harming living beings, constantly cultivating the world’s various scriptures. The *Scriptures of the Lao Lord’s Dao and Virtue* were his vocation, and he delved into the subtle and probed the inner mysteries. His spirit and perfection were fully realized; wherever he wandered—be it secluded mountains, deep valleys, dense forests, or precipitous cliffs—he inquired not of the terrain. Later, within the cavern of the Martial Man Mountain, he encountered the Primordial Lord and obtained the traces of the attained Dao: the *Wondrous Scripture of the Eightfold Plain Interwoven True Texts* and the *Wondrous Scripture of the Supreme’s Divine Treasure Minor Kalpa’s Reckoning*.

He instructed his disciples, saying: You must now receive these teachings so that the reckoning of heaven and earth’s revolutions may converge, and the hundred million cycles exhaust. The Mysterious Deliverance shall descend again. Fearing the great reckoning’s approach, how could one let it pass? The minor kalpa is now manifest.

The Primordial Heavenly Worthy spoke to the Mysterious Deliverance Perfected One: The reckoning follows the hundred and six, arising in the final kalpa. At that time, those with immortal bones—these men I myself shall instruct in the methods of delivering the body.

Disciples should constantly seek to transcend the fiery calamities and deliver themselves from the perils of the mists. They ought to study the wondrous scriptures of the Three Caverns and establish the *Divine Treasure* purification rites. If dwelling amidst the world, they should erect a lofty dais with a jeweled canopy, floral lamps, and incense implements, paying homage six times daily and partaking of one meal at noon. If one has renounced worldly affairs and dwells in secluded mountains or deep valleys, practicing purification rites in solitude, they should maintain a perpetual fast, swallowing qi and elixir-water, standing or sitting constantly, with the left hand turning toward the Northern Culmen.

One should say: On such-and-such an auspicious day and hour, I, [Name], firmly establish my field of merit, beseeching the Supreme of the Northern Culmen to deliver my form. Holding the breath, one exhales thrice, practicing this six times daily, and shall thereby attain the Perfected Dao.

When the celestial destiny of the minor kalpa converges, the Mysterious Deliverance Perfected One shall deliver them with these nine secret talismans. The Primordial declared: The nine talismans are the Nine Chapters, corresponding to the Supreme’s Nine Strategies. Receiving the *Divine Treasure* and wearing these nine talismanic water-texts—these are the *Wondrous Scripture’s Divine Chapters*. One recites and chants them while wearing them upon the body. The cinnabar-written plain registers and revolving talismans are placed in a pouch and worn, to avert the convergence of the minor kalpa. These are to be kept secret.

The Primordial Heavenly Worthy expounded the Supreme’s *Wondrous Scripture’s Ninefold Talismanic Chapters*:
1. The First: Expounding the Supreme’s *Wondrous Scripture Talisman*
2. The Second: Expounding the Supreme’s *Mysterious Scripture Talisman*
3. The Third: Expounding the Supreme’s *Numinous Scripture Talisman*

The Primordial expounded the Supreme’s *Treasure Scripture Talisman* as the Fourth, the Supreme’s *Jade Scripture Talisman* as the Fifth, the Supreme’s *Ninefold Golden Tone Talisman* as the Sixth, the Supreme’s *Thirty-Nine Jade Tone Talismans* as the Seventh, the Supreme’s *Spirit-Generating Scripture Talisman* as the Eighth, and the Supreme’s *Ninefold Transformation Concealment Scripture Talisman* as the Ninth. These secret talismanic texts are the Supreme’s *Cavernous Mystery Concealed Strategies*. Scholars wear them upon the body and constantly chant the ninefold tones, and the true Dao naturally descends.

The Primordial Heavenly Worthy declared: The Three Simplicities are the Purple Simplicity, the Yellow Simplicity, and the White Simplicity. Now, each becomes a Supreme *Cavernous Mystery Numinous* Perfected One. The Three Simplicities unite to form the Three Perfected Ones, who perpetually govern the present administration.

The Scripture states: When a *Numinous Treasure* Dharma Master establishes a retreat and dons ritual vestments, the ritual skirt is made of yellow cloth, with inner garments of *Mud-Pellet Silk*. The *Mud-Pellet Silk* is adorned with a horizontal green sash as a mantle, and a yellow silk kerchief. Through cold and heat, this attire remains unchanged as the ritual vestment, and divine boys and jade maidens constantly guard it.

The Scripture states: For ritual vestments, if one dwells in secluded mountains and forests to establish retreat practices, the skirt, coarse cloth, kerchief, and cloak are all made of deer hide. However, one must not share the retreat with worldly people. If a scholar resides in the world, they must follow the scriptural instructions and not wear mountain-dwelling ritual vestments when venturing among people, nor bring worldly garments into the mountains. Such actions violate the scriptures and breach the precepts. The Great Perfected of the myriad heavens observe one’s demeanor and loss of proper form, becoming objects of mockery for demon kings. The orthodox spirits do not respond, and the mysterious Perfected do not attend.

In ancient times, before the Supreme Wondrous Heavenly Perfected One attained the Dao, he practiced the *Numinous Treasure* Dharma but did not adhere to the ritual protocols. Wearing mountain-dwelling ritual vestments, he ventured among people. Just as the true Dao was about to be accomplished, he attended a retreat at a royal household, where his ritual vestments violated the precepts and ruined his true Dao. Later, he became a Perfected One of the Five Peaks and remains in the world to this day. When the minor kalpas of heaven and earth reach their end, this Perfected One will ascend one kalpa’s height. Due to this transgression, he has incurred nine offenses against heaven and earth, exhausting ten minor kalpa cycles. As the cycle nears completion, the Perfected One roams the numinous peaks but has yet to ascend the Ten Absolute Realms. This stems from his failure to follow the ritual regulations for vestments. Scholars, take heed!

When the minor kalpa cycles of heaven complete ten rotations, this Perfected One will once again become a concealed Perfected One among the ten directions.

The Scripture states: There was once a Dharma Master who studied the *Cavernous Mystery* retreat practices but had not yet severed worldly ties. He resided in the world, revering the precious scriptures, upholding the precepts, and cultivating the Dao, having accumulated much time in practice. Yet he mistakenly wore worldly ritual vestments into the mountains and thus failed to attain the Dao.

At that time, three jade maidens appeared, clad in nine-layered embroidered robes, with purple silk sashes. Their hair was styled in three coiled buns, adorned with orchid-embroidered kerchiefs. Their feet bore shoes with intertwined dragons and nine patterns, and in their hands, they held *Revolving Salvation* numinous banners, burning nine-colored harmonized incense. Playfully laughing, they said: "The heavenly kalpa is nearing its end—who can resolve this?"

An ancient immortal, seeing these jade maidens were no ordinary beings, bowed in reverence. The maidens initially ignored him, then said: "You are an ancient worthy sovereign—why do you suddenly bow to us?" The maidens rose, restless and uneasy. Soon, two more jade maidens arrived, each holding a scroll of wondrous scripture. They said: "The Purple Tenuity Lady sent us bearing these eight precepts, issued from the midst of heaven, not to be shared with worldly people. The scriptural texts are secret and must not leave this place."

The Radiant Light Perfected One discussed the great and minor kalpas of heaven and earth, fearing that afterward, no remnant people would remain. Thus, he devised the minor kalpa salvation cycles, declaring that those who cultivate and keep these secrets may transcend. The eight solar terms are for presenting jade tablets.

The Radiant Light Perfected One composed the *Ode on Salvation for the Remnant People Across Kalpas*:
Circling, traversing the cycle complete,
Rites touch the emptiness of non-action.
Above to the Numinous Clouds’ abode,
Below into the Abyssal Mystery Palace.
Dwelling round, square, level, and high,
Contemplating the precious chamber’s realm.
The salvations are not many,
Yet heaven’s cycles are distant in plain speech.
When times flourish in the Primordial Accomplishment Palace,
The eight poles constantly come and go.
The three unite in one covenant—
Why is the transformative rite so late in coming?
The six directions arrive and depart,
The world’s destiny grows lofty and great.
The golden horse’s radiant essence flourishes,
Its words portend prosperous cycles.
Who treads the path of wisdom?
Reflecting on the primordial within and without.
When the net’s discipline is exhausted at once,
The hundred-six numbers converge.
Circulating, the Three Simplicities appear—
Revered by the Heavenly Thearch.
If the past did not preserve the remnant,
Heaven and earth’s cycles would overturn.
How to transcend this?
Gazing upward, recall the *Numinous Treasure’s* words.
Responsive resonance may avert calamity,
Grasping the tally and chanting the jade scriptures.

During the salvation cycle, the Radiant Light Perfected One recited this ode, then summoned the Wind Earl and the lesser heavenly Perfected to assemble. As the kalpa’s cycle neared its end, he established the various minor heavens anew. Now, the Perfected One divides his form to become the Ten Heavenly Great Heavenly Worthies, surveying the Five Turbidities and the *Numinous Treasure* Ten Poles Perfected Ones. Those who now uphold the orthodox teachings and scriptures to attain the true Dao shall become these Ten Directional Perfected Ones. Though the texts have not yet been obtained, after witnessing the Dharma, one may ascend in broad daylight, transform the wheel, and become a minor heavenly Perfected One.

The Primordial Heavenly Worthy declared: The minor kalpa occurs when the Perfected Ones complete three celestial cycles, the heavenly numbers converge with earth, and the earthly numbers universally unite—this is called the minor kalpa salvation cycle. At that time, the sun, moon, and stars of the various heavens extinguish themselves, and the earth’s beams and frameworks lose their roots and origins. The Three Radiance Perfected Lords then transform and save the lesser sages who have not yet attained the true Dao, fearing the present cycle’s completion.

It is said that in former times, there was one *Mysterious Salvation* who emerged from the Ninefold Hidden Cavernous Mystery, self-generated and transformed. His radiant countenance resembled a youth’s. Holding the *Supreme Primordial Cavernous Clarity Numinous Treasure Twofold Simplicity True Scripture* in eight sections, he descended to inform the Five Peaks, suppressing disasters and calamities. Arriving at the stable and fiery lands, he sat and expounded the Eight Trigrams, establishing records to transmit to the Supreme Ultimate Perfected One.

The opening of the Three Worthies’ playful contemplation marks the means by which the kalpic passage is thus traversed. A jade maiden held a scroll of *Small Kalpa Jade Script for Suppressing Fire and Weeping Rivers*, stating it was bestowed upon the celestial of the Morning Land, Xia Yu. This was to be used when the teachings of the heavens faced great disasters, to pass through them.

Ancient immortals now serve as the Supreme Ultimate, recording the names and traces of those who attain transcendence. The scripture states: Before the era of Wu Yao, Perfected Ones received from the Jade Maiden of the Heavy Net Heaven the *Wondrous Scripture for Suppressing Fire and Annotating Smoke in the Small Kalpa*, which remains the method for transforming and delivering the body.

Within this scripture:
The flowing cycles revolve, the guiding principles perish,
Mountains and seas conceal, numinous power arrives.
Departing and returning, sun and moon are eclipsed,
The *Kui* transforms—now it has come.

The Primordial Celestial Venerable said: The Great Mystery holds six *wu* earthly branches, vast and purifying in their workings, responding to the endless wheel of kalpas. Contemplating the distant and empty, ascending the lofty and towering, craggy and boundless, the Ten Absolutes stand ungrounded. Vast and empty, the dark kalpa shifts and passes. The five stars are incomplete, constellations invert and the Big Dipper overturns. The kalpic cycle nears its end, sun and moon lose their light, yang’s moisture fails to harmonize, seasons lose their qi. Heaven and earth leak and dissipate, the Five Peaks sink and vanish, blessed lands float as ridges. Those who pass through find cool shade, gathering into the past.

The Three Realms take flight, and at that time, the people are utterly annihilated. The great perfected of the heavens refine and pass through, their bones merging with the Dao, their names inscribed on yellow silk. Thus the kalpic reckoning exhausts the empty and cavernous, the cavernous merging into emptiness to establish the Great Land, turning toward the Ten Absolutes’ boundlessness.

The great kalpic reckoning of the past and future North Pole converges into the great reckoning, entering the empty and征-space. The reckoning of emptiness creates the void—its name is unfathomable.

The Perfected of the Great Net said: The Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao. What is recorded as a name may also not be a name—it may be called hidden. The three below return to the void; the great enter vast expanse; the subtle reach the unseen. Moving in concealment within the empty land, resplendent within the cavernous palace, the Four Waterways serve as cavernous gates. The past abode is the great land for refining transcendents.

The Primordial Supreme Ultimate Perfected One and the Perfected of Mysterious Salvation expounded at the cavernous gate of the Small Kalpa the Dao of the kalpic cycle’s exhaustion, recording the cavernous lands and mountains. Mountains hold cavern-heavens, and cavern-heavens have four gates—these are the great cavernous gates. Upon reaching this gate, learners pass through by their own attainment.

The Most High Great Dao Lord said: The Primordial Celestial Venerable declared that as the great and small kalpic cycles near their end and the kalpic passage approaches, the Dao Lord himself spoke of the divergence of names and streams, the clash of kinds. The lofty dwell above, the low return to the depths. The great reverse and return to stillness; the One Origin forms its circle. The small settle into subtlety, the origin residing within. Forms divide and arise—some dwell high or low, some are born within the great or small, some take root and grow, some gestate in the womb, some renew with the new moon, some transform and arise naturally, some exist in the formless and qi-less void. Initially unseen in form or shadow, born in hidden depths—all such kinds possess karmic responses, all arising from transformation, each following its original cause.

When the reckoning is exhausted, those with greater karmic response do not perish but follow their kind to begin anew. Those who take root and grow enhance their brilliance and beauty. With the register of the Seven Treasures’ trees, they are born in the Seven Treasures Forest of the Numinous Treasure Realm, where multitudes of transcendents and great sages often visit to observe. When the great and small kalpas end and the cycle renews, they attain human form. Cultivating the scriptural teachings, they behold the assembled perfected. The radiance of the Numinous Treasure shines universally, illuminating ten people.

Those born from the womb, having accumulated heavy blessings in past lives, gain form and body in gestation, their souls and spirits conjoining with the numinous, naturally reciting the verses of the Supreme August. The Primordial Celestial Venerable and the Most High Lord Lao, in the Jade Capital’s Lesser Chamber of the Mysterious Capital’s Upper Land, expounded the *Thirty-Six Sections of the Supreme Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure Wondrous Scripture*.

At that time, the Most High Lord Lao possessed the reckoning of the Primordial Void’s lifespan and the boundless kalpic count. Before the Supreme August era, as the kalpic wheel turned and the mandate neared its transition, Yu Yi succeeded and departed, Jie Lin revolved and moved. Ascending to the kalpic peak, stars shattered and constellations renewed. The Five Peaks transformed, their directional guardians exchanged; the Four Waterways were swept away, seas became mountains, waters turned to colossal stones. Worms flew and insects stirred—all beings, formed in an instant, passed like the thirty-two myriad kinds of people.

The Primordial Lord Lao expounded the *Five Thousand Characters of the Scripture on the Dao and Virtue*, the *Three Cavernous True Writings*, and the *Essential Wondrous Scriptures*, teaching and transforming later learners. Its verses say:

The White Stone Elder, of empty surname,
On Bird Mountain, received and studied the Dharma in four hundred thousand words.
Dwelling there, he established fasts and upright conduct,
Ate plain vegetarian meals, repented of sins and contemplated blessings,
Opened the path to deliver all, seeking escape from the troubled world,
To behold the Great Peace.
He paid homage to the heavens, bowed to the ten directions,
Gazed in gratitude to the Mysterious Perfected,
The Brahma multitudes of the heavens,
The eight kinds of voices.
Burning incense, lighting lamps,
Reciting and circumambulating, practicing the Ten Poles’ mindfulness,
Reflecting to dispel floating illusions,
Discoursing on the most wondrous,
Accumulating study for six hundred years,
Returning to the Mysterious Capital’s Warrior Man Mountain’s northern chamber.
Again studying for two hundred years,
On the twenty-fourth day of the fifth month in the *jiawu* year of the Great Year,
The Numinous Treasure manifested.
Suddenly, twelve flying celestial beings of the Seven Treasures,
Riding cloud-borne chariots,
Descended from the Ninefold Mystery Terrace,
Addressed and welcomed the Primordial Void Perfected Lord,
The White Stone Empty Cavern Perfected One,
Who soared aloft,
Ascending to the Ninefold Radiance,
Teaching and transforming the assembled transcendents,
Studying the arts and methods of true transcendence.
In the first year of the Supreme August era, on the tenth day of the ninth month,
The Lady of Tortoise Mountain received the *Eightfold Register of the Eight Lives’ Primordial Scripture*.
On the fifth day of the tenth month of that year,
Red Pine Master received the *Thirty-Six Sections of the Great Cavernous Treasure Chapters*,
The *Three Cavernous True Regulations*,
And the *Essential Precepts of the Dao and Virtue*
In the Mysterious Capital’s Treasure Citadel Mountain.
Breaking gold to cast fish,
Dragons and serpents formed hooks,
Ascending the altar to fulfill a precious pledge.

To transmit its texts, they employed:
A hundred feet of flying-cloud brocade,
Two jade tablets,
Two golden dragons,
A pair of fish,
Twenty-four swords,
Forty feet of white silk,
And the Five Directions’ luminous mirrors.

At that time, the assembly of Brahma and the multitudes of heavens intoned the Eight Kinds of Celestial Sounds, chanting the Three Contractual Hymns. Through this study, they attained the Dao of true transcendence. They expounded upon the profound Cavernous Palace of Eon’s Height, naming it the abode of the Empty Cavern Primordial Unity Lord, the Supreme Radiance Lord, the Old Lord, and the Supreme Unity Lord—dwelling in villages beyond bounds, beyond abysses, in the subtle images of Mara’s realm. Across the Great Thousand’s Three Caverns, the Primordial Simplicity True Regulations and the Numinous Robe Treasure Regulations existed in utmost subtlety.

First: the *True Guardians of the Empty Cavern*,
The *Great Cavern Purification Rites*,
And the *Hymns of Simplicity and Numinosity* as odes.
They performed the *Mysterious Sound Cavern Purification of the Brahma-Heaven Net*,
The *Jade Capital Mountain Scripture’s Pace-the-Void Hymns*,
The *Brahma-Heaven Sound Cavern Spirit Purification*,
The *Eight Simplicities Yin-Yang Scripture*,
And the *Central Lands’ Great Cavern Purification*.
They withdrew from worldly traces, secluding far from mortals,
Practicing perpetual purification, ingesting and absorbing qi,
Refusing to partake in worldly affairs.
Those who did not maintain such purification and ingestion could not join the discourse.

The Ten Directions’ Supreme Sage Heavenly Worthies observed human good and evil, calling this the *Loftiest and Most Mysterious Purification Rite of the Supreme Perfected*. The independent Dao of establishing purification: the Primordial Void Lady, on Black Crow Mountain, received the *Supreme Cavernous Mysterious Brahma-Heaven Dignity Rituals and the Brahma-Heaven Net Great Precepts*. She repented and offered gratitude for the karmic fortunes and transgressions of her ancestors—seven generations of parents—bound in the cycles of birth, death, and rebirth, aspiring to dwell perpetually in non-action. She burned incense and lit lamps, eating once at midday, repenting and offering gratitude day and night in six periods for her primordial ancestors, that all might ascend to the heavenly halls, transform and be reborn across the Ten Directions, and walk alongside the Mysterious Capital.

As they recited the Three Caverns’ true texts, at that moment, the Numinous Treasure Perfected Ones descended in cloud-light. Ten Poles’ flying transcendents, divine youths, and jade maidens—each in tens—alongside Brahma’s multitudes, resounded in seven-jeweled radiance, illuminating the Jade Capital as they chanted the Three Contractual Brahma-Heaven Hymns. The Ten Poles’ Perfected Ones each intoned one contract, while Brahma’s hymns and the flying transcendents, divine youths, and jade maidens together offered a poem. The Primordial Void Lady descended from her seat to bow before the Heavenly Worthy, then received the poem, which read:

*"The chapter’s numinous, wondrous, and lofty,
The Primordial Lady deems it supreme."*

The Primordial Void Lady responded from the Mysterious Center with a poem of her own, and suddenly, all vanished. The assembled Perfected Ones turned their gaze—White Stone Master had attained the truth.

**Three Contractual Hymns of the Supreme Perfected Ones of the Brahma-Heaven Net**

**I.**
The Six Perfections trace Brahma’s path,
The utmost Perfected emerges from the Void’s mystery.
The Empty Cavern faces the Numinous Empyrean,
Gazing up at the Ten Poles’ guests.
Forms receive wondrous and marvelous appearances,
Vast and boundless, ascending to sagacity.
Holding the staff, they attend the sacred branches,
Clad in coarse cloth at the Numinous Treasure’s dawn.
Unraveling the flying clouds’ knots,
Their radiance illuminates the Brahma-Heaven Net.
Their bodies become golden,
Necks adorned with seven-jeweled circles.
Feet treading lotus steps,
They wander and inquire across the Ten Poles.
The Jade Capital’s village in the Mysterious Capital,
Naturally inscribed with vermilion characters.
Jade tokens sound uncommon tones,
The Dharma-wheel is the true speech.
Wondrous indeed, the Supreme Teaching,
The Dao established in the Five Thousand Characters.
All scriptures return to this chief and eye,
Vast and open, the Cavernous Mystery’s truth.
Virtue aligns, transcending beyond,
Worldly dust left far behind.

**II.**
Lush and verdant, the Empty Cavern’s land,
Towering, the Heavenly Treasure Terrace.
Flowing and clear, the assembled Perfected descend,
Ten thousand kalpas as one epoch.
Embracing the Jade Perfected Scripture,
Chanting through the Three Calamities.
The Five Sufferings burst forth at once,
Seven generations transform into non-action.
Ascending to the Purple Tenuity Palace,
The Primordial Registers held as treasures.
The Primordial Void is not distant,
Refining and expelling doubts of the perverse.
The body’s essence, turbid and worn,
Pay homage to the Supreme Master.

**III.**
The Mysterious Cavern departs into the Void,
Empty and vast, without direction.
The Brahma-Heaven Net births the Cavern’s abode,
Ten Sages together in purification’s splendor.
The Five Peaks secure peace,
The Four Waterways receive wisdom’s image.
Again flying, they universally bear nothing,
All creatures, innumerable, equal.
The Nine Perfected’s Returned Elixir Record,
Flying to the Jade Capital.
Ten thousand kalpas in an instant,
Countless eons in a moment.
Transcending the roots of the multitude’s difficulties,
Riding rosy clouds to ascend Menglong’s ridges.

**IV.**
The Dao that is not the Dao is not the constant Dao,
The name that is not the name is not the constant name.
The Void that is not the Void is not the constant Void,
The Mystery that is not the Mystery is not the constant Mystery.
Thus, know the Dao, the Mystery, the Void—
Names are inherently wondrous.
Encompassing and cleansing the utmost,
Vast and boundless, without end.
Above, embracing the Great Net in boundlessness,
Below, entering the abyssal in subtlety,
Also observing Mara’s images across the Great Thousand—
Mara finds the Great Net difficult to fathom.

The Treasure True Speech expounds the Supreme Teaching,
The assembled Perfected exhort and transform.
The *Heavenly Numinous Treasure Mysterious Scripture*,
The utmost secret texts,
Liberate thirty-two myriad kinds of beings.
The Three Ones sweep away,
The Hundred Officials open the path,
Elaborating the true texts
To transform the benighted.
Upholding prohibitions and taboos,
They naturally attain liberation.
Without such qualities,
They still avoid hell’s calamities.

The Dao has the *Five Thousand Characters*,
The utmost Perfected’s wondrous scripture—this is one text.
The *Great Cavern’s Thirty-Nine Chapters*—this is one text.
The *Jade Characters of the Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure True Texts of the Brahma-Heaven Net*—this is one text.
The *Three Sovereigns’ Inner Sounds*—this is one text.
The *Nine Dragons’ Flight*—this is the trace of attaining the Dao.
Scholars must study thoroughly the *Five Thousand Characters*,
The *Cavernous Mystery True Texts*,
And the *Great Cavern’s Thirty-Nine Chapters*.

This scripture, since the Primordial Beginning, was hidden in the Golden Portal. By the Upper Prime, when the Dao’s scriptures were to spread, they swept away purity and turbidity, admonishing people on sin and fortune, enlightening the worldly, and revealing that the utmost Dao is not distant—it abides in the Great Void.

The *Great Cavern’s Thirty-Nine Chapters* originally consisted of thirty-nine words. The Supreme Old Lord elaborated them into thirty-nine chapters, bestowing them upon the Primordial Simplicity’s Primordial Void Lady as the *Empty Cavern True Texts*. After studying for one thousand six hundred twenty-four days, the assembled transcendents revered them, and the true Dao was accomplished. The Empty Cavern Perfected One, gazing upon the Six Perfections, further expounded the *Great Kalpa* in one scroll, teaching and transforming the assembled transcendents. The scripture’s loftiness and subtlety return to their origin.

The *Supreme Perfection’s True Regulations*, the *Highest Regulations and Methods*, the *Great Simplicity’s True Regulations*, the *Primordial Void Lady’s Empty Cavern True Secrets*, the *Numinous Treasure Jade Scripts*, and the *Great Cavern’s True Texts*—these thirty-nine chapters first emerged, while the Jade Scripts expounded thirty-six divisions of wondrous scriptures. Their profound and subtle texts arose from the Dao’s own words, and all the Heavenly Perfected revered the Vermilion Writ, gazing upon the traces of the Brahma-realm.

Thus the Perfected One declared: To cultivate the Great Vehicle’s practice, one must venerate the Jade Scripts and the *Great Cavern’s True Texts*, thereby attaining the rank of Highest Perfected. Their names are inscribed in the Brahma-register, and the Ten Poles’ True Immortals progressively ascend through verification, all rooted in the Empty Cavern. The Perfected One also serves as the Ten Directions’ Perfected, assisting in the governance of the Ten Heavens. The Brahma-Heaven’s name for them is the Ten Poles’ True Immortals, and the True Net Heaven’s sound is called the Dao.

**Hymn of the Eastern Infinite Realm’s Void-within-Void Wondrous Form Perfected One, Precious Radiance Realm, for the Liberation of All in the Void (One Contract)**
Lofty peaks beyond the darkest ridge,
Midway lies wondrous speech.
The Empty Cavern’s Net Heaven’s chapters,
Soaring to ascend the Nine Mysteries.
Feet treading the cloud-net’s path,
Gazing down upon the Supreme August Perfected.
Upholding precepts to ascend the Void-Nothing,
Chanting the *Numinous Treasure’s* verses.

**Hymn of the Southern Infinite Realm’s Void-within-Void Supreme Perfected One, Numinous Radiance Realm, for the Liberation of All in the Void (One Contract)**
The Void-True is the Mysterious True,
The utmost Dao reveres non-action.
Primal qi abides in emptiness and stillness,
Dragons inverted, vermilion phoenixes soaring.
Only pluck the lush jade mushrooms,
Uphold precepts to enter the Cloud Gate.
Soaring nets play with dragons and tigers,
Vowing to bind past-life karmic threads.

Hands clasped toward Brahma-Heaven,
Attaining sight of the *Infinite’s* chapters.

**Hymn of the Northern Infinite Realm’s Nonbeing-within-Nonbeing Mysterious Record Perfected One, Mysterious Radiance Realm, for the Liberation of All in the Nonbeing (One Contract)**
Numinous brilliance faces the void,
How could the lofty and wondrous be distant?
The Jade Dawn is no material vessel,
Calamities thus reverse and retreat.

**The Scripture of the Five Sufferings of the Golden Gate,**
Severed forever through womb-refinement.
Flowing pearls ascend to the Upper Palaces—
How could aeons be called late?

**Hymn of the Perfected One of the Upper Village of Mysterious Province, Northeastern Infinite Realm, for the Liberation of All in the Upper Village of the Infinite (One Contract)**
Verdant forests in solemn stillness,
Fragrant, ascending to the Great Rosy Clouds.
Jade pendants chime beneath Heaven’s shade,
Cloudy vapors dense and towering.
The red realm’s host of Daoists—brows arched—
Attain long life to ward off evil.
Chanting the *Yellow Court Register*,
They achieve the Dao and return to ferry their kin.

**Hymn of the Perfected One of Eon’s End, Southeastern Infinite Realm, for the Liberation of All in the Pure Net Heaven (One Contract)**
Gazing upward to the land of kalpas’ height,
The Jade Capital lies void within the Mysterious.
Majestic, the Red Pine Master
Ascends as if to the Great Rosy Clouds.
Wandering and sinking past all beings,
The Great One rides the cloud-chariot.
Delighting in the lofty and noble Dao,
Seven ancestors are born in celestial dwellings.

**Hymn of the Boundless Perfected One, Southwestern Infinite Realm, for the Liberation of All in the Luxuriant Net (One Contract)**
Radiant light emerges from the Great Cavern—
Why do true spirits linger in hesitation?
Left, the dragon holds the reins in its jaws;
Right, the tiger bares its might.
Crimson phoenixes gather in mutual regard,
Serpent-spirits ascend the Great Chief.
The Nine Palaces generate the Eight Trigrams,
The Ten Poles roam the Grand Tenuity.

**Hymn of the Transformative Birth Perfected One, Northwestern Infinite Realm, for the Liberation of All in the Radiant Pāramitā (One Contract)**
Treading the flying steps of the Upper Offices,
The Seven Primes’ path of long life.
Yearning for the people of this world,
They soar to escape suffering and affliction.
Erasing the hundredfold sins of past lives,
They circle back to the Five Elders.
Inscribed in the *Jade Tablet* of fixed names,
All vow to preserve themselves forever.

**Hymn of the Supreme August Perfected One of Myriad Aeons, Upper Infinite Realm, for the Liberation of All in the Primordial Center of the Ninefold Radiant Numinous Treasure (One Contract)**
Gazing at the Great Rosy Clouds’ subtle traces,
Beyond the peaks of the secluded central ridge.
Caverns intersect in the Mysterious Province,
Where the host of immortals assembles.
Wandering past three revolutions,
Further refining to transform their luminous forms.
Awaiting the Perfected Ones of the Ten Poles,
They ascend in clouds to the Jade Capital.

**Hymn of the Longevity-Cultivating Perfected One of Countless Calculations, Lower Infinite Realm, for the Liberation of All in the Golden Radiance of the Great One (One Contract)**
Returning to the wondrous truth within the Dao,
The Brahma-Heaven holds the numinous scripture.
The void expounds the jade characters,
To instruct later worthies.

The Perfected One leaves no visible form,
Harmonizing light and qi to permeate the dust.
Presenting jade tablets to the Supreme August,
Beseeching the bestowal of essential texts.

**Ten Chapters by the Ten Directions’ Perfected Ones for Offering Rituals, Burning Incense, Expressing Gratitude, Pacing the Void, Chanting Hymns, and Illuminating Lamps—Separately Extracted from the Host of Scriptures**

In the fifth year of the Void Sovereign’s reign, on the seventh day of the seventh month, the Primordial Lady of the Great Void descended to sport among the myriad heavens. Observing the good and evil therein, she beheld legions of demonic spirits and malevolent ghosts rampaging across the world, wantonly harming the innocent and violently severing lives. Though the Most High remained distant and the Three Clarities vast, countless demons and myriad evils masqueraded as true and upright. Wind and rain, drought and flood, no longer aligned with the hexagrams’ seasons. The Primordial Lady manifested upon Mount Reniao, where she expounded the *Wondrous Scripture of the Jade Formula of the Cavernous Mystery’s True Text*, dividing it into thirty-six scrolls. With its majestic rites and models, it pacified the Five Peaks to oversee the numinous spirits of heaven.

Now, ten hexagrams are composed upon Mount Reniao, within the vast Cavernous Great Realm’s Mysterious Cavern Chamber. Amidst the teachings of the Mysterious Venerable’s supreme treasure, those with immortal bones shall behold its text. Concealing themselves to study and contemplate, they uphold its precepts. The world’s offerings and alternate methods, as recorded in the thirty-six sections of the wondrous scriptures, were received by the Perfected One of White Stone Kongdong as thirty-six myriad characters, originally comprising thirty-six scrolls—entitled the *Thirty-Six Sections of the Venerable Scriptures*—whose words and graphs remain unbounded. The scrolls’ opening titles derive from the *Great Cavern’s Scripture of the Fundamental Karma of Great and Small Kalpas*.

Within these characters lie the celestial sounds and the inner names of the hundred spirits. Now, the methods for study and cultivation emerge as the Primordial Lady of the Great Void expounds the *Middle-Grade Wondrous Scripture*.

The Primordial Lady of the Great Void declared: To behold the scripture of the Dao, the scholar must refine their essence and stir profound devotion. The Ten Ranks of Perfected Ones shall dispatch flying immortals to bestow the texts anew each day. Through diligent cultivation, one attains the true Dao.

**Hymn of the Flying Heavenly Men and Jade Maidens:**
Vast and clear, the azure expanse adorned,
Boundless, the Mysterious Origin’s embrace.
Sinking into the records of spontaneity,
Wondrously traversing the nine heavens’ net.
Leaving no trace, the spirit of empty qi,
Even a thousand kalpas would not be too long.
Radiant brilliance universally gleams,
Penetrating and illuminating the singular body.
The August Jade Sovereign descends in majesty,
Dissolving a hundredfold layers of sorrow.

**Hymn of the Supreme Disciple, the Perfected One of the Great Void’s Cavernous Emptiness:**
Resplendent, without limit or trace,
Vast and open, the realm of emptiness and stillness.
Gazing down upon the Purple Tenuity’s terrace,
Entangled in the karmic forms of the vulgar.
Holding the texts of the Cavernous Chapters,
Sporting together amidst the jade radiance.
The Heavenly Venerable ascends in flight,
Dissolving and casting off the world’s snares.

The Perfected One declared: The Dao possesses the *Supreme Clarity’s Pure and Primordial Cavernous True Text of Jade Characters Wondrous Scripture*, the *Supreme Clarity’s Pure and Primordial Cavernous Jade Formula*, the *Wondrous Scripture of the Luminous Hosts’ Sounds*, the *Pure Clarity’s Flying Ninefold Cavernous Wondrous Scripture*, the *Pure Clarity’s Flying Sevenfold Transformations and Salvations of the Primordial Cavernous Wondrous Scripture*, the *Upper Scripture of the Pure and Primordial Cavernous Numinous Chapters*, the *Upper Scripture of the Pure and Primordial Cavernous Wheel-Turning of the Five Paths*, the *Upper Scripture of the Pure and Primordial Cavernous Mysterious Wheel*, the *True Scripture of the Pure and Primordial Cavernous Thirty-Six Ramparts’ Hosts of Sounds*, the *Wondrous Scripture of the Pure and Primordial Cavernous Phoenix’s Cessation and Wondrous Records of the Dao’s Traces*, the *Wondrous Scripture of the Pure and Cinnabar Waters’ Flying Techniques in Hu Language*, and the *Secret Scripture of Jade Texts’ Majestic Rites*.

The Great Salvation Perfected One, the Boundless Venerable, expounded the *Method of the Flying Cinnabar Waters* in the Kalpa-Measuring Realm on the sun’s day, bestowing it upon the Lady of the Purple Tenuity. The Lady received it with reverence.

The Perfected Ones of the Ten Directions, together enveloped by the *Great Numinous Chapters of the Cavernous Emptiness of the Ultimate Void* and the *Thirty-Six Sections of the Heavenly Dao’s True Texts in Brahma Sounds*, completed the catalog of titles. The Perfected Ones faithfully received and upheld them.

**The Flying Cinnabar Waters Method’s Twelve Medicinal Ingredients:**
1. **Crimson Mound Pearl** – Oral formula: cinnabar.
2. **Black Horse’s Mysterious Passage** – Oral formula: stalactite.
3. **Mysterious Subtlety’s Permeating Body** – Oral formula: white quartz.
4. **Purple Ascent’s Blazing Radiance** – Oral formula: purple quartz.
5. **Yellow Minister’s Penetrating Body** – Oral formula: sulfur.
6. **Mysterious Life’s Prolonging Calculation** – Oral formula: Taiyi’s leftover jade.
7. **Flowing Bloom’s Moon Essence** – Oral formula: mica powder.
8. **Green Warrior’s Returning Essence** – Oral formula: white atractylodes.
9. **Repelling Poison’s Warming Body** – Oral formula: asarum.
10. **Withered Dao’s Winter Blossom** – Oral formula: poria.
11. **Cinnabar Attendant** – Oral formula: sesame.
12. **Prolonging Years and Extending Life** – Oral formula: polygonatum.

Each of the above, twenty-four *jin* in weight. The twelve superior medicines each govern their own functions. The ingredients must be of the finest quality. The practitioner must first undertake a fast of one hundred twenty-four days, avoiding inquiries from others. Pound the ingredients in a bronze mortar: fifty thousand pestles for herbal medicines, one hundred thousand for mineral medicines. Once refined, combine them, first mixing with white honey in a bronze mortar for one hundred twenty thousand pestles. When the medicine is half-completed, place twelve *shi* of mercury into a bronze cauldron, sealing it with a bronze lid. Use white quartz to prepare the mud, sealing the cauldron’s seams. Construct two openings in the cauldron, covering it with a roof to prevent vulgar persons, birds, fowl, chickens, or dogs from seeing it. Use cypress leaves for fuel, replenishing until the mercury is entirely sublimated. Once the medicine is complete, dry it in the shade for one hundred days. Upon opening, store it in vessels of gold, silver, or jade.

When taking the medicine, fast and consume twelve pills, each the size of a sesame seed. One shall then float aloft, ascending myriad stages. The Perfected Ones of the Ten Directions and the host of heavenly Perfected Ones attain truth through the *Flying Cinnabar Waters Technique*.

The Supreme Lord Lao observed the transformations of life across the Ten Directions, perceiving the foolish and admonishing the obstinate. He expounded wondrous texts to instruct the Great Salvation Perfected Ones of the Myriad Heavens and the Dharma Masters of the Net of Brahma. The Mysterious Ultimate’s Supreme Perfected One manifested the textual methods to illuminate the Ten Directions’ numinous voids. In the twenty-third year of the Jiaping era, on the ninth day of the ninth month, the Perfected One wandered the Kalpa-Measuring Mysterious Capital, ascending to behold the jade radiance of Mount Reniao. Paying homage to the Supreme Ultimate, he presented himself before the Great Salvation Perfected One.

Upon completion, he addressed those seeking the Dharma among the benighted, entangled in defilement and impurity, who dared not ascend to make their case. From the inception of the withered bones’ primordial essence, through the wheel-turning of womb transformations, they erred into the human realm, their putrid flesh and bones. Yet, by the grace of the numinous descent’s mysterious favor, those with hearts were awakened and uplifted. The numinous and exalted Venerable nurtures and educates all beings, universally delivering all.

Here the profound mystery is fathomed—even the crawling insects and wriggling creatures all escape the Three Evil Paths. Yet the numinous and exalted Venerable has not bestowed the true scripture upon these withered bones. We long to behold its purport.

Thereupon, they rose and made obeisance, pacing through the seven heavens for what seemed an age. The Great Salvation Perfected One remained still and silent, offering no response. Suddenly, the Lady of Mount Tortoise emerged from the Palace of Purple Radiance, attended by some ten jade maidens, and arrived at the Kalpa-Measuring Mysterious Capital.

The Lady smiled and said: “What request could so confound a Perfected One?” The Dao possesses the *Supreme Eulogy of the Mysterious True: The Wondrous Scripture of the Flying Arts of Cinnabar Waters* in eight sections—its profound records and essential texts encompass the true and correct Way in full.

The Lady then smeared her face with ashes and prostrated herself, earnestly entreating the jade maidens to join her plea. In an instant, the Perfected One produced the scripture and conferred it upon these Perfected Ones of the Ten Directions, who thereby also received the text. Through cultivation and study, they have now attained the rank of Perfected Ones of the Numinous Treasure of the Ten Directions.

Thus concludes the *Wondrous Scripture of the Flying Arts of Cinnabar Waters for Deliverance Through the Lesser Kalpa of the Cavernous Mystery and Numinous Treasure*.
