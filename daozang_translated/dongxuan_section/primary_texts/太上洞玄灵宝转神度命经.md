**The Supreme Cavern Mystery Numinous Treasure Scripture on Transforming the Spirit and Delivering the Destined Life**

The Supreme Dao Lord addressed the Southern Culmen Deliverer of Destined Lives, saying: When a person nears the end of life and their vital qi still lingers, arrange scriptures and images, invite Daoist masters, perform repentance and receive precepts, and distribute alms and possessions. Clothing, bedding, playthings, utensils, carriages, camels, horses, fields, estates, gardens, attendants, servants, cushions, curtains, tables, staffs, basins, sandals, rings, pendants, caps, headbands, belts, swords, ceremonial shoes, jade tablets, pendants, pearls, gold, silver, patterned silks, embroidered fabrics, painted and colored decorations, felt mats, and wooden couches—whatever is available should be offered in charity. Commissioning statues, transcribing scriptures, and dedicating all meritorious deeds, including banners, flowers, canopies, incense burners, bells, chimes, and supporting Daoist masters—whether dwelling in mountains, suffering poverty or illness—by performing rituals, bowing in worship, lecturing, hosting feasts, burning incense, reciting invocations, scattering flowers, lighting lamps, releasing living beings, ransoming lives, establishing temples, delivering people, pardoning prisoners, freeing servants and slaves, allowing them to enter the Dao, and making offerings to the Heavenly Worthy—all these acts benefit both the living and the deceased, their merit unfathomable. Among these, dispelling calamities, averting misfortune, and aiding the sick yield the deepest blessings, truly foremost in merit.

The Supreme Dao Lord said: Today, men and women whose destined lives are ending should universally proclaim to the ten directions, bearing witness to their repentance. From the beginningless past to this present body, through the three karmic actions and six senses, they have committed countless transgressions. All present must act with utmost sincerity so that all past offenses may be eradicated. Once eradicated, the precepts shall be expounded.

The first precept: Do not kill. Those who uphold this shall be reborn in a long-lived body. Guard the mind and do not transgress.

The second precept: Do not engage in illicit sexual conduct. Those who uphold this shall be reborn in a pure and noble body. Guard the mind and do not transgress.

The third precept: Do not steal. Those who uphold this shall be reborn in a wealthy and honored body. Guard the mind and do not transgress.

The fourth precept: Do not deceive. Those who uphold this shall be reborn in a respected and trusted body. Guard the mind and do not transgress.

The fifth precept: Do not consume intoxicants. Those who uphold this shall be reborn in a wise and enlightened body. Guard the mind and do not transgress.

The Supreme Dao Lord said: Today, men and women who have received these precepts shall hold fast to their roots, transform the spirit, and enter the wondrous realm, being reborn in a pure land, seated upon a great lotus, hearing the Dharma’s sound, never regressing, and attaining the true Dao.

The Supreme Dao Lord said: For all men and women, whether living or deceased, bow in worship to the ten directions, sincerely repenting with devoted hearts.

The Most High Lord of the Dao addressed the Perfected One of the Southern Culmen, who delivers lives: "From the beginning, the Primordial Beginning has spread transformation throughout the ten directions, filling the five hundred million heavens and the three thousand Dao realms. Dividing his body and scattering his shadow, his true, responsive, and transformative Dharma takes form in response to conditions, expounding the Dharma to deliver beings, rescuing and aiding all, teaching and transforming men and women, and accomplishing the multitude of beings. In each realm, there are Heavenly Worthies who are lords, the Most High Lord Lao, true teachers, jade maidens and jade lads, immortals, perfected beings, sacred ranks, generals and warriors, vajra spirit-kings, twenty-four thousand spirit-offices, one hundred twenty bureaus and departments, star palaces and cloud halls, water residences and immortal palaces—all have officials in charge, examining and assessing sins and blessings. They hold banners and establish standards, grasp registers and wield talismans, soar through the void, recite scriptures, and perform the Dao. They increase blessings and repay evil, avert misfortune and dispel calamities, patrolling day and night to inspect gains and losses, all in accordance with the Primordial Beginning, assembling in the Great Luo. Though kalpas shift and change, the established Dharma remains unaltered. The ten directions and three realms share a single system; the Three Caverns divide their gates, adapting to the capacities of those who receive them. Confessing transgressions and seeking blessings proceed from the low to the high; repenting sins and seeking grace proceed from the heart to enter the Dao. To violate this decree is to follow heretical teachings. Therefore, I proclaim that one should first approach the ten directions, where spiritual resonance and response will naturally bring about numinous efficacy."

The Most High Lord of the Dao addressed all men and women of the three realms: "Each should apply their mind, follow these instructions, and comply with them."

The Most High Lord of the Dao said: "When a person dies, their transformation follows their past karma. They may be reborn in the household of a wealthy and noble king, in a family of upright and virtuous character, in a body of wisdom and intelligence, in a body of complete purity, in a body of longevity and joy, in the body of a poor and lowly servant, in a body of ugliness and malice, in a body of delusion and dullness, in a body of decay and filth, in a body of premature death and affliction, in a body of illness and suffering, in a body of borderland barbarians subject to killing, in the body of a pig or dog, in the body of a bird or beast, in the body of a fish, turtle, insect, or ant, in the body of a ghost, spirit, demon, or evil being, or in the long night of the Nine Dark Realms—all are received according to their original karma. The past and future are no different from the present; what one receives in this life comes from past karma. What one sows in this life becomes past karma. The common people, being foolish, see the clear retribution of sins and blessings in this world yet do not believe in the causes and conditions of past lives. It is like eating the five grains without knowing where they were sown. The verification of sins and blessings is like an echo and shadow. Diligence in repentance prevents sins from arising; diligence in cultivating goodness ensures blessings remain."

The Most High Lord of the Dao said: "When a person first dies, from the first to the hundredth day, set up an image, invite Daoist priests to perform rituals and recitations, tirelessly day and night. Thus, the soul may be born in a good place and not fall into the Three Wretched Realms."

If on the first day, lamps are lit, banners are made, scriptures are copied, and images are cast—each act of deliverance reaching a hundred in number—the deceased shall immediately be reborn in the Pure Lands of the Ten Directions, the realms of bliss, where worldly blessings and prosperity abound, free from all calamities and misfortunes.

The Most High Lord of the Dao said: "At the time of parting, invite Daoist priests to burn incense on the left side of the road, recite scriptures, and perform acts of almsgiving and life-release along the way. Thus, the Celestial Officers shall not detain the departed soul, nor shall flying corpses or vengeful ghosts afflict the living.

If incense is burned and scriptures are recited to the left of the grave, the Earthly Deities and True Officers shall pacify the departed soul, the household shall remain undisturbed, and malevolent spirits or murderous ghosts shall not trouble the descendants.

The Perfected One of the Southern Culmen and all the sagely hosts, hearing the virtuous sounds, bow in reverence and carry out the rites."
