At that time, the August Jade Emperor of the Vast Heavenly Expanse was within the Jade Void Palace of the Kalpa Heavenly Palace, expounding the *Scripture of the Incantation for Commanding Demonic Spirits with the Yu Step, Opening Heaven’s Wind and Thunder* to the hosts of heaven and earth, the sun, moon, and stellar lodges, the flying heavenly spirit-kings, the great bodhisattvas, and the celestial beings.

Then the Jade Emperor addressed the Great Emperor of Fusang of the Watery Palaces, saying: "You govern the qi of earth and water below. I observe that within the Watery Palaces dwell many demonic dragons, jiao-serpents, and shen-monsters, wantonly stirring winds and rains, sweeping across the lands and peoples. Tigers, wolves, insects, snakes, and wild beasts—having lived for countless years—transform into spectral beings, refusing to return to the true teaching. Following their base natures, they falsely seek licentious sacrifices, bewildering the people to demand bloody offerings. Some are violent demons or malevolent ghosts, wantonly slaughtering sentient beings. Pity their plight; you must deliver them."

Thereupon, the Great Emperor of Fusang of the Watery Palaces ascended to address the Heavenly Emperor, saying: "This humble servant, charged with the governance of the two bureaus, knows not by what method to deliver these sentient beings."

The Supreme Emperor replied: "In times past, I relinquished the royal throne, forsaking its wealth and honor. For eight hundred kalpas I cultivated the Way, suddenly awakening to the Great Vehicle, and by its fruit attained purity, naturally becoming the Awakened King. The Tathāgata taught the bodhisattvas, and thus I passed through kalpas as numerous as raindrops. By the mandate of the Primordial Beginning, I realized the Jade Void Emperor of the Vast Kalpa Heavenly Palace, presiding over the opening of heaven and the ordering of earth.

At that time, the sun and moon suffered eclipse, the stars lost their proper courses, each devouring the other, contending over their allotted domains. I summoned the Eight Thunder Gods of Heaven to subdue the myriad stars. Through my numinous power I refined them, restraining the demonic kings and stellar spirits, their divine transformations beyond measure. I could command a single thunder god to lift Mount Tai in hand and transport it elsewhere. I could command a single thunder god to swallow the waters of the Four Great Seas, leaving not a single drop. I could command a single thunder god to leap a hundred and eight yojanas into the sky, devouring the sun and moon and consuming the stellar spirits. I could command a single thunder god to spew fierce fire throughout the worlds, burning away the demonic and returning all to the true Dao. Thus, the sun, moon, and stars were restored to their proper places, each guarding its domain, the stars shining brightly, and day and night were first distinguished.

Now, I entrust to you the scriptural threads of the Three Caverns. You may transmit them in the mortal world to those who cultivate the Way. All thunder gods, in accordance with their precious registers, shall heed the talismanic commands, swiftly manifesting in secret to demonstrate their power—shaking heaven and earth, displaying the efficacy of slaying demons and vanquishing specters. Those who receive and uphold these scriptural threads must constantly recite this incantation, augmenting the majestic radiance of the thunder gods, bestowing it upon them to align with the true Dao and accord with this mind."

Thereupon, the Jade Emperor proclaimed the *Incantation for Opening Heaven and Restraining Demons*:

*"The Five Thunders’ mighty spirits,
Born with the Emperor’s same essence.
Receiving the Jade Emperor’s charge,
They subdue the host of stars.
Fierce officials in ten thousand ranks,
Yakṣas in a thousand legions.
Seven heads and a hundred arms,
Vast mouths and golden essence.
Bodies ten thousand leagues in height,
Devouring demonic spirits.
Where they walk, wind and rain arise;
Where they sit, thunder resounds.
The Thunder Duke’s thunderclap,
The Lightning Mother’s true numen.
Wind and thunder roar and blare,
Heaven and earth stand in awe.
Slaying dragons, beheading specters,
Day and night without cease.
A thousand gods bow in submission,
Ten thousand spirits all obey.
The Five Peaks and Five Emperors,
The Four Waterways’ Source Lords.
The Yangzi, Yellow, Huai, and Ji,
The Twelve Streams’ true spirits.
Beneath the Nine Earths,
In the springs’ curves and dark depths.
The Northern Capital of Fengdu,
The Abyssal Caverns of the Vast Deep.
Above the Nine Heavens,
The sun, moon, and stars.
The flying heavenly spirit-kings,
Each and all heed the command.
The earthly bureaus and watery palaces,
Where ghostly encampments are known.
Ever executing the true mandate,
Nurturing and fostering all beings.
Should any dare transgress,
The talismanic command shall summon them.
Thunder and lightning, obeying the decree,
Shall execute, slay, burn, and incinerate.
Their might is irresistible,
Their punishment inescapable.
Arrayed in the Nine Heavens,
The Jade Emperor chants the hymn.
Divine power blazes forth,
Wrathful and majestic.
Beheading demons, slaying specters,
Thunder, lightning, and stars fly.
Bala’s might shakes,
Dali’s radiance blazes.
Revealed through Chen Ji,
Beholding the scarlet robes.
The drum’s subtle flow,
Nanlu casts his garment.
Entrusted to Yan Shi,
Night’s might in the Dipper’s midst.
Xu Ying, the Great King,
Anu speaks above.
The drum’s thousand harmonies,
Chenzhu’s wrathful halt.
Shu Fu’s bright longevity,
Kui’s distant retreat.
The hymn’s true ease,
Thunder’s hidden subtlety.
Recite it ten thousand times,
In accord with the spirits.
Radiant as sun and moon,
Majestic power fully arrayed.
On ren, gui, hai, and zi days,
Constantly recite this scripture.
Divine spirits lend their aid,
Uniting with the Dao in truth.
The Supreme Emperor’s divine incantation—
Do not transmit it to the unworthy.
To lightly disclose or profane it
Brings calamity upon descendants.
Recite it with utmost sincerity,
And command thunder and lightning.
Above, ascend to the imperial court;
Below, deliver the dark depths.
Should you follow my teaching,
The heavens shall chant your name.
Thunder and lightning shall guard and protect you,
And you shall be called a True Person.
Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with
The Jade Emperor’s statutes and decrees!"*

Thereupon, the Great Emperor of Fusang of the Watery Palaces, together with the hosts of heaven and earth, the sun, moon, and stars, the flying heavenly spirit-kings, the great bodhisattvas, and the celestial beings, all rejoiced greatly, faithfully receiving and practicing the teaching.

Then the Great Emperor of Fusang made this vow: "Your servant shall widely transmit and propagate this teaching among those who deliver the world below."

At that time, the Jade Emperor further addressed the Great Emperor of Fusang, saying: "Without these scriptures and registers, the people of the mortal world cannot restrain demonic forces or command thunder and lightning. You must widely transmit and confer them in the world, but do not reveal them to the unworthy, that they may deliver the people of heaven."

"I shall dispatch the Three Officials to record with brush and ink, examining merits and transgressions with flawless precision. Those of merit shall receive heavenly talismans, summoned to the Golden Palace. According to the depth and weight of their merit, they shall ascend to the ranks of immortals."

Thereupon, the Great Emperor of Fusang presented the sacred decree, bowing in gratitude for the heavenly grace, and took his leave to depart.

Thus concludes the *Sutra of the Three Caverns’ Numinous Writs for Opening Heaven, Commanding Wind and Thunder, and the Yu Pace to Restrain Demonic Spirits*.
