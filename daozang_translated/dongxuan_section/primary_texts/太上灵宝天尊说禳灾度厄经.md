**The Scripture of the Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy on Dispelling Disasters and Delivering from Calamities**

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy was in the land of Chanli, accompanied by countless great Daoist perfected immortals, myriad Heavenly Worthies, and all the celestial dragons, ghosts, and spirits, who gathered in assembly to receive his commandments.

Should there be any good men or good women in the world who suddenly encounter yearly disasters, monthly calamities, the perils of wandering red rats in the city, the snares of heaven’s net and earth’s web, the exhaustion of fate and the depletion of life’s reckoning, lingering illnesses, the dangers of drowning in waves, the threats of tigers, wolves, vipers, and serpents, the harms of water, fire, bandits, blades, warfare, and childbirth, the afflictions of mountains, forests, trees, and altars of the soil and grain, the hazards of earth, stones, and bridges, or the curses of poison and incantations—may they now face the Jade Emperor Heavenly Worthy and the great Daoist perfected sages, repenting and dispelling these calamities, delivering and liberating themselves from all disasters. May each be dissolved and dispersed, never to remain as obstacles. May the Heavenly Worthy command all the divine kings of heaven, descending their sacred power and the power of the Dao, upholding the merit of this scripture and the grace of its blessings, to guard and protect the disciples.

After receiving and reciting this scripture, one shall be delivered from the disasters of the ninefold yang cycle, the three declines and nine misfortunes, the eight difficulties and five sufferings. All wishes shall be fulfilled, all steps taken in peace. In going out and coming in, in action and repose, one shall always be blessed with good fortune. All undertakings shall be beneficial, and all desires shall follow the heart’s intent.

Thereupon, all those assembled, having heard this scripture, rejoiced greatly, believing, accepting, and practicing it.
