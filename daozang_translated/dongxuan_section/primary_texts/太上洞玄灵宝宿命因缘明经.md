At that time, the Supreme Dao Lord was seated in repose atop the Great Rosy Clouds, addressing the assembled perfected beings:

"The great virtue of Heaven and Earth is called the Primordial Dao. The precious virtue of Heaven and Earth is called the Originating Dao. The connecting virtue of Heaven and Earth is called the Human Dao. When these Three Daos unite in virtue, the treasures of transformation lie hidden and preserved within the primordial void, preceding the imperial transformations.

Nüwa had the body of a serpent; Fuxi, the form of a scaled being. Yin and Yang were in chaos, and the workings of creation had not yet divided. The Three Sages succeeded one another; the Five Emperors initiated the beginnings. The Dao was accomplished, virtue was established, and the divisions of fortune and misfortune were set.

As radiant transformations spread and flowed, karmic causes and conditions gradually arose. The tokens of good and evil shifted and moved, already manifest. In the Great Antiquity, simplicity and purity prevailed, and moral teachings were easily followed. By the Middle Antiquity, falsity gradually arose, and harm and treachery flooded the world. Oaths and trust were no longer upheld, and the root of the Dao was abandoned.

Yu’s virtue governed with clarity. He was famed for his merit in overseeing the waters, was recommended by Shun, and labored to regulate the mountains and rivers. He dredged and opened the Four Great Rivers, delivering and saving the myriad people. During his life, he received the abdication; after his death, he was entombed on Mount Zhong. As the Lord of the Palace of Great Yin and the Illuminating Overseer of the Water Officials, he was bestowed with the celestial talisman, and thus his drowning was averted.

The teachings of the Three Treasures ascended and transformed at this time. Excellent! Excellent! Thus was the Dao proclaimed."

The Dao Lord said: "My Dao is lofty and wondrous, easily traversing the hidden and the manifest. It transforms in accordance with goodness and descends to bestow precious scriptures. Yet later generations have turned to evil, stubbornly lacking trustworthy words. They drift and stagnate together, deeply misleading their descendants, who suffer the Three Paths and Five Pains in death, enduring agonies beyond description.

I ever deeply ponder this: good and evil must be distinguished. If one does not cultivate virtuous power, one will unjustly incur transgressions and resentment. You must diligently perform purification rites and forever seek liberation, passing through all calamities in body and long preserving joy. By following the teachings and transformations, prosperity and peace may be attained."

The Dao Lord said: "I grieve for the future, for the karmic entanglements of life and death, sin and blessing. Only through the accumulation of goodness does one receive felicity, for the rewards of fortune arise naturally. Those who attain the essence of the Dao may also ascend as immortals."

Yin-sheng bowed his head and said: "Excellent! Excellent! Now that I have received the precepts, may they be proclaimed and disseminated without end.

When Yao existed, there were Shun and Yu—what karmic causes, what conditions, led them to be born with sagely wisdom, to enjoy long-lasting reigns, and to labor in regulating the waters, their merits manifest in the world? Why do I suffer hardship and distress? Why do I endure such bitterness and sorrow, afflicted with pain and without joy? What profound virtue have I possessed to become a celestial being? What hidden merit have I accumulated to stabilize my ascent as a flying immortal, to avoid the Eight Difficulties, and to protect and deliver my descendants?

Now, with my head bowed and tears flowing, I beseech you to reveal these causes and conditions."

The Dao Lord said: "Excellent! Excellent! Your question is most fitting. You may fully expound the precepts for future generations.

My precepts on karmic causes and conditions, on life and death, sin and blessing, are resplendently clear. I only wish that later generations will clearly inherit the teachings and transformations. The Dao of Heaven is impartial, yet it bestows its favor upon the good.

Be cautious! Be cautious! Speak as I have spoken."

The Dao Lord said: "The supreme and unexcelled Dao of the Three Realms transforms all through the numinous, striving to deliver the multitudes and universally save sentient beings. To attain liberation from the Five Turbidities—can such merit be spoken of?

Now, as the Five Poisons arise, driving out the rebellious and wicked throughout the world, distinguishing the worthy from the good, I fear you may fall into evil and be reborn among beasts. For this, I grieve and sorrow—what can be done?

The Dao Lord said: At that time, rulers and ministers will contend, with no distinction between good and evil, great and small, noble and base, teacher and friend. All will suffer violent misfortune, perishing in body and name, not one in ten thousand spared. Those who cultivate no virtue in life will meet such calamity. Harboring jealousy within, lacking kindness and compliance, slandering one another, their gazes confused and deluded—such people will fall into hells and hungry ghost realms.

Seeking fleeting glory, they neglect to cultivate blessings, failing to guard against future lives of foul stench, humiliation, and torment—can such suffering be spoken of?

Yin-sheng asked: "For those in future generations who face the misfortunes of kalpas, by what method may they be instructed?"

Truly, I pity all beings. Those who receive good retribution do so by virtue of great merit, attaining favorable conditions. In death, they escape the Three Wretched Realms and Five Sufferings, ascending forever to halls of fortune where clothing and food arise naturally. This may indeed be called excellent! Excellent!

Yin-sheng said: "As Your Sagely Lordship has spoken, I ask: by what causes and conditions does one attain birth as an immortal of noble rank—something most desirable and joyful? By what causes and conditions is one born among ordinary mortals? By what causes and conditions does one fall into the earthly prisons, where suffering defies description? By what causes and conditions is one born among slaves and servants, despised by others, afflicted and joyless? By what causes and conditions is one born among the virtuous and steadfast, their body and speech fragrant and pure, revered by all? By what causes and conditions is one born among the coarse and ugly, constantly enduring scorn and humiliation, their conduct unwholesome? By what causes and conditions is one born in ease and leisure, esteemed by others, constantly receiving offerings, their wishes fulfilled?

I only wish to be enlightened regarding the source of liberation, to attain deliverance, to forever enjoy blessings and treasures, and to dwell in such prosperity that suffering and heat never touch me."

The Dao Lord said: "Listen carefully to my precepts and ponder my earnest words. Now, for your sake, I shall fully expound the essential and wondrous.

The response to virtue manifests in six matters:
First, a compassionate heart that does not kill living beings, nurturing all things and universally delivering them to safety.
Second, cherishing the worthy and good, refraining from thievery, desiring only to give alms and relieve the destitute.
Third, maintaining a chaste and pure heart, single-mindedly advancing with diligence, forsaking sensual pleasures, and never violating the precepts.
Fourth, sincerity and integrity, never deceiving others, guarding one’s speech to avoid transgressions, and refraining from greed and impurity.
Fifth, never indulging in drunkenness, which defiles the pure and worthy.
Sixth, revering and believing in the Dao with awe.

Practicing these six matters, one is born among the celestials, roaming freely as a flying immortal, with clothing, food, and attendants provided. Revered by others, one becomes a teacher and friend. At such a time of blessing, the Dao ever praises:

*By not killing, one attains longevity,*
*Free from pain, ever apart from suffering.*
*All ascend to heavenly ranks,*
*Body at peace, finding refuge.*

*By not stealing, one remains noble and pure,*
*Wealth and treasures naturally gather.*
*Palaces of seven jewels arise,*
*Joy and ease abide in tranquility.*

*By not engaging in licentiousness, one avoids disorder,*
*The body remains perpetually pure.*
*One’s births are upright and proper,*
*Cultivating virtue, naturally wise.*

*By not deceiving, one’s breath is fragrant,*
*Speech ever loyal and true.*
*Words emerge from the primordial Dao,*
*Discourse brings accomplishment.*

*By not drinking to excess, one avoids errors,*
*Ever wishing to behold flowers and fruit,*
*Attended by celestials.*
*At life’s end, ascending to heaven,*
*The twenty-five spirits welcome.*
*Myriad blessings descend of themselves,*
*Radiance ever resplendent.*

The Dao Lord said: "Next, six further matters lead to birth among humans.

What are these six?
First, giving alms to relieve the destitute, ever mindful of the suffering of the poor.
Second, upholding the precepts with diligence, never committing the Ten Evils.
Third, enduring insults with forbearance, never speaking recklessly.
Fourth, exhorting the foolish and obstinate, urging them to reverence and caution.
Fifth, wholeheartedly serving the Dao, practicing kindness and loyalty to the utmost.
Sixth, loving life and hating killing, never acting wrongfully.

Practicing these six matters, one is born among humans, ever prosperous and noble, their wishes fulfilled wherever they turn. Through vast generosity, one is reborn as a human king, revered by all nations. Such virtue is praised by the Dao:

*By giving alms, one attains great fortune,*
*Wealth and treasures naturally come.*
*One’s births are ever noble,*
*Transmitting joy through generations.*

*By upholding precepts, one remains reverent,*
*Receiving the nine honored ones.*
*With diligence, never committing evil,*
*One preserves the body’s longevity.*

*By enduring insults, humbling oneself,*
*Anger never shapes the mouth.*
*Though reviled, one bears it in silence,*
*Blessings and longevity ever natural.*

*By advancing diligently, never lax,*
*Mindful of the Dao, one attains truth.*
*Conduct aligning with the Dao,*
*At life’s end, one becomes a celestial.*

*By mindful truth, never retreating,*
*Loyal and true, never deceitful,*
*Honoring all virtuous ones,*
*One’s births know no hardship.*

*Practicing these six virtues,*
*One is born as a human,*
*Countenance upright and proper,*
*Naturally becoming noble.*

The Dao Lord said: "Further, there are seven vile karmic conditions that, upon death, cast one into hell, where one is tortured for kalpas without end.

What are these seven?
First, disloyalty and unfiliality, reviling the honored Dao, dying prematurely or maimed, falling into hell to be tortured for tens of thousands of years.
Second, falsely invoking spirits and gods, cursing the good, suffering calamities and torments too grievous to speak of.
Third, destroying sacred halls, disrespecting the Three Honored Ones, enduring severe punishment, agony clinging to the body.
Fourth, skepticism and lack of faith, denying spirits and gods, perversely defiling the Three Luminaries, suffering myriad illnesses, ever bound in heavenly prisons. Moving amidst a hundred evils, their children are born crippled or maimed, falling prematurely into hell to endure ten thousand years of suffering."

Fifth, those whose bones and blood share no true kinship, whose closest kin betray and harm one another, who slander and defame spirits and gods, who are filthy and insolent, never pure or clean, who cruelly reject the truth at their core—these suffer premature death, never reaching their allotted years, and fall into hell, where myriad torments cling to them.

Sixth, those who rebel and defy the law, who shackle and imprison their fathers or lords, who show no reverence or love for elders, whose mouths spew wickedness first, whose bodies are flayed and butchered, who die young without atoning for their transgressions, and whose later lives are torn by tigers—calamity flows to their descendants.

Seventh, those afflicted with jealousy and malice, who are perverse and domineering, whose faults and evils never leave them, who encounter misfortune and disaster, and who die to enter hell, where they fall into cauldrons of boiling liquid for ten thousand kalpas.

Such are these evil deeds. The Dao intones:

Stingy and greedy, refusing to give,
Stealing in secret, neglecting kin.
Hoarding wealth, craving false honor,
Never aiding the aged or poor.
Wife and children, servants below,
Left unclothed, starving in cold.
Sitting idle, guarding their gold,
They die to become starving ghosts, maimed.
Never sated, their bodies break out in sores,
Begging in vain, their clans all perish.
Gossiping, stirring strife with their tongues,
In life and death, flayed and torn.
Molten bronze poured down their throats,
Tongues ripped out, half their bodies long.
Forced to swallow, burning their mouths,
Their guts and stomachs rot within.
Never thinking of good in life,
In death, they sink into ash and flame.
Malicious, belittling others,
Tortured for tens of thousands of years.
When their sins are exhausted, they emerge,
Only to be born as the lowliest of men.
The utterly wicked, delighting in slaughter,
Thieves and robbers, violent and cruel—
Maimed, they enter hell,
For ten thousand kalpas, plagued by disaster.

The Dao Lord says: There are also five evils that cause one to be reborn among beasts.
First, breaking precepts and stealing, refusing to repay debts.
Second, lusting after close kin, showing no reverence for Heaven and Earth.
Third, wrongfully harming the innocent, swearing false oaths without regard for the law.
Fourth, seeing goodness and not rejoicing, hearing of evil and following it—such ones suffer brutal torture in life, and calamity flows to their descendants.
Fifth, deceiving superiors and deluding subordinates, serving their lords without loyalty, abusing their positions and power, framing the loyal and good, delighting in butchery, flaying oxen and sheep alive—pain and torment unbearable, their hearts like jackals and wolves.

For these five deeds, one falls into the hells of the Five Peaks, reborn among beasts, tormented by the five poisons. Wise and foolish alike share this fate. Such is the retribution. The Dao intones:

Ever harboring thieving thoughts,
Refusing to repay debts.
Killing for sport, hunting without restraint,
Engaging in unlawful worldly ties.
Acting without sincerity or faith,
Flying into rage at the slightest word.
Unaware of their own sins,
Preferring evil, disbelieving truth.
Later, they fall among beasts,
As oxen, sheep, donkeys, or horses.
Stinking and foul, forever burdened,
Tormented thus for ten thousand kalpas.
Lusting after kin, committing heinous crimes,
Struck down by lightning and thunder.
Dead, they sink into hell,
Hung upside down, roasted by fire.
Gossiping, slandering the true Dao,
Later, enduring extreme suffering.
Molten bronze poured down their throats,
Forever hungry and cold.

The Dao Lord says: There are also five virtues that lead to noble birth, earning the respect of all, upheld throughout the world, the heart’s desire of all people.
What are these five virtues?
First, giving without stinginess, bestowing kindness universally, aiding the poor and desperate in their time of need, their merit spreading to the eight directions.
Second, reverently serving the supreme Dao, honoring the Three Treasures.
Third, focusing the mind on fasting and purification, cultivating stillness, gentleness, humility, and deference to others.
Enduring humiliation without seeking redress, reflecting on oneself in the Dao—such ones ascend to immortality in name.
Fifth, delighting in refining Dao and qi, firmly believing in celestial patterns, entrusting the heart to the Dao, the Dao ever present within, penetrating the nine palaces, attaining earthly immortality. The foolish masses of the world dismiss this as untrue. Yet the proof is thus. The Dao intones:

Giving freely, never stingy,
Aiding all, bringing peace.
In this life, receiving purity and nobility,
In the world, witnessing ascent to immortality.
Revering the virtuous and the Dao,
Fasting to see true spirits.
Still in thought, unwavering in heart,
Seven generations ascend to heaven.
Enduring insults without anger,
In life, ever upright and true.
Studying, delighting in virtue and the Dao,
Becoming the most honored among men.
Cultivating a gentle and yielding heart,
Humble and modest toward others.
Rescuing the desperate, saving the imperiled,
Attaining long life.
Reverently upholding the Precepts of the Numinous Treasure,
Clearly refining the Dao of the Nine Palaces.
Entrusting the heart to emptiness and non-being,
Living as long as Heaven itself.

The Dao Lord says: There are also five evils that cause one to be born as a lowly person, a slave or servant.
What are these five evils?
First, arrogance and disrespect toward parents.
Second, stubbornness and defiance, lacking reverence and deference.
Third, dissipation and disregard for the Three Treasures.
Fourth, self-will and theft.
Fifth, fleeing to evade debts, refusing to repay.

These five deeds cause one to be born as a lowly person, a slave or servant, beaten and humiliated, forever hungry and cold, never satisfied in life. The Dao intones:

There are those foolish and ignorant,
Arrogant and disrespectful to parents.
Lacking reverence and deference,
Later born as lowly people.
Seeing treasures and showing no respect,
Defiant toward elders.
Acting without kindness or filial piety,
Later born as slaves or servants.
Clothing and food dependent on others,
Driven and beaten day and night.
Born to endless suffering,
In death, never escaping torment.
Dissolute, delighting in lust,
Utterly disbelieving in spirits and gods.
Later, suffering hunger and cold,
All their deeds meet with hardship.
Refusing to repay debts, cursing instead,
Poor and wretched, reviling ancestors.
Later, born as oxen or sheep,
Tormented and oppressed by others.

The Dao Lord says: There are also five virtuous deeds that ensure one encounters good conditions, is born among humans, with fragrant breath and a pure body, ever at peace in heart and mind, respected and honored by all.
What are these five virtues?
First, wholeheartedly believing in truth, never deceiving others in life.
Second, reciting scriptures and practicing the Dao, single-minded and unwavering.
Third, diligently fasting and purifying, delighting in the immortal Dao.

Fourth, teaching others to do good, never committing wrong or evil.
Fifth, being sincere and compassionate, aiding those in urgent need, steadfast in faith and free from doubt.
These five virtues ensure birth among the noble, with fragrant breath and no reckless transgressions, ever at peace in heart and mind, revered and followed by all. Throughout life, they remain free from poverty. With long accumulation of merit, they gradually attain the rank of celestial immortals.

Such are the rewards of virtue. The Dao proclaims in verse:
Devoted to faith, embracing the Way of life,
A compassionate heart ever mourns for the suffering.
With pure meals and a spotless body,
They ascend to the celestial mechanism after transformation.
Reverent toward the Three Treasures,
Never arrogant toward parents.
Utterly sincere, never deceitful,
Such is the person of loyalty and filial piety.
Guarding the mouth from reckless speech,
The mind’s actions encompass all.
Exhorting others to shun sinful sights,
Mindful of the Dharma, never transgressing.
Aiding the destitute and rescuing the desperate,
Their merit and virtue are profoundly great.
They lengthen their lifespan and increase their years,
Enjoying lifelong joy and peace.
Forming friendships with magnanimous righteousness,
Respecting one another as parents.
Suppressing evil and extolling virtuous power,
Filial piety and brotherly love move the gods and spirits.

The Dao Lord says: There are also six inauspicious deeds. Those who practice them lack the Way, their bodies steeped in filth and defilement, their forms base and emaciated, ever meeting with hunger and cold.
What are these six evils?
First, deceitful and lacking sincerity.
Second, utterly disbelieving in the true Dao, seeking to destroy the Dharma upon hearing it, inherently devoid of goodness, constantly subjected to slander.
Third, disregarding virtuous precepts, mocking the perfected.
Fourth, defiling and humiliating elders, their conduct erratic.
Fifth, harboring malicious and rebellious hearts, slandering the virtuous.
Sixth, minds ever fixed on evil, prone to groundless rage.
Born among the lowly, they endure constant hunger and cold, driven by others day and night without respite. Their bodies reek, and they never know joy.

The Dao proclaims in verse:
Deceitful, fond of reckless speech,
Ever lacking in true sincerity.
Heart and mouth at odds,
Their forms ever steeped in filth and disgrace.
Rebellious and evil, delighting in slander,
They fall into hell upon death.
Molten bronze poured into their mouths,
Enduring bitter torment in eternal darkness.
Addicted to wine and fond of cursing,
Disbelieving in spirits and gods.
Iron hooks seize their tongues,
Their agony beyond words.
If they are reborn among humans,
Their breath is ever foul and rank.
Hated and despised by others,
Beset by misfortunes on all sides.
Evil thoughts constantly befall them,
Every direction meets with punishment.
Entangled in unexpected calamities,
No torment they do not endure.
Upon death, they return to hell,
Later reborn as beasts.
Trapped in the cycle of the five poisons,
Their lives filled with sorrow, shame, and humiliation.

The Dao Lord says: There are also five virtues that ensure one is born in favorable conditions, ever abiding in the Dao and its teachings, respected by all, their words always heeded. With five hundred merits accumulated, they later encounter immortal lords.
In their next life, they become Daoist practitioners, learned and enlightened.
The five supreme virtues align with the subtle and imperceptible:
First, delighting in the immortal truth, reverently serving the Three Treasures, chanting scriptures and performing the Dharma Wheel, wandering through kalpas, offering incense and abiding in emptiness, ascending to transcend suffering.
Second, journeying with immortal sages, their merit and virtue safeguarding their bodies.
Third, wishing to be born among humans, refining the Dao of the Three Origins.
Fourth, reciting the Shangqing scriptures, satiated without eating.
Fifth, roaming the void, their karmic obstructions overturned in an instant.

Such are the rewards of virtue. The Dao proclaims in verse:
Reverently embracing the Three Virtues,
Proclaiming and exhorting good deeds.
Wishing to meet immortal sages,
Ever to be visited by perfected beings.
Wishing to nurture all the worthy,
Equal to oneself without distinction.
My heart purified and serene,
Radiant with the Dao’s hundred sincerities.
Day and night diligently cultivating and learning,
Wisdom makes them celestial beings.
Yin Sheng transformed in the western lands,
Universally guiding all to know the true Dao.
Devoted to contemplating the immortal truth,
Their accumulated thoughts never differ.
First wishing to ascend and roam the void,
Communing with the subtle and imperceptible.
Accumulating goodness without tiring,
Bestowing kindness without stinginess.
Their merit and virtue move the immortal sages,
Who naturally bestow the elixir.
The Dao Lord says: Practicing this Dharma in the world,
One transcends the Three Realms.
The foremost Dharma is the Shangqing,
Soaring transformations in harmony with the Cavern Realms.
Next, through countless kalpas,
They manifest as Tathāgatas, their roots the same but teachings slightly varied.
Later, their teachings reach the farthest barbarians.
The ten directions and China,
The hardest to transform are those in the west.
I, the Dao, was Laozi,
Guiding Yin Sheng at the time,
Uttering the Five Thousand Words,
Refining the womb for ten years,
Circulating the heavens thrice,
Completing the foundation of perfect fortune.
Only my Dao practices goodness,
Seeing this, deeply take heed.
