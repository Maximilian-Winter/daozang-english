The Most High Lord of the Great Dao said: The Void Constant is the hun-soul and po-soul of Heaven and Earth, the majestic brilliance of yin and yang. The Void is the hun-essence of the Nine Heavens; the Constant is the po-spirit of the Nine Earths. Their two qi congeal to form the great spirit of the Imperial Honored One, whose radiance aids and illuminates. The Void Constant, with its aiding brilliance as its gaze, commands the movement of celestial light, surveys the ten thousand directions, records the celestial lodges, revolves the Five Constants, summons and directs gatherings, and hastens the turning of mechanisms. When Heaven is at rest and Earth at peace, the Void Constant conceals itself; when Heaven is in decline and Earth in turmoil, the Void Constant shines forth. Fortune and misfortune, omens and portents—it instantly reports all inauspicious signs. The transformations of the myriad qi, the alterations of yin and yang, the succession of the four seasons—none occur without its agency. Thus, the two stars are revered and noble, hidden within the splendor of dawn, their wondrous subtlety belonging to the Void Constant, rarely to be glimpsed. Those who behold the two stars gain boundless longevity; those who cultivate and preserve this Dao ascend in flight to the Hall of Splendor. This is the secret teaching of the Highest Perfected.

The Prime Minister, the Azure Lad, respectfully inquired: The Dao of the Void Constant is spiritually resonant and wondrously noble—may it be heard?

The Most High Lord of the Great Dao said: The Void Constant is the supreme name of Heaven and Earth, yet it is called the Nameless. Blended into one, it becomes the Named. However, the Nine Heavens guard its spiritual resonance, which does not circulate in scriptural texts. Since it employs its aiding brilliance for seeing and hearing, relying on light and shadow to communicate with the real, the Imperial Honored One receives it to govern, and scholars wield it to attain immortality. It causes those with intention to seek it in the unfathomable, and thus it is again named the Named. Though named, it is not transmitted to the reckless; none can fathom it. Those who esteem it yet fail to attain its truth—how could this serve as the foundation for encouraging study? Yet the Nine Heavens have decreed that only those destined to possess the Dark Chart and Jade Characters, inscribed on the Fangzhu and bamboo slips, and those born to unite with the real, may partake of its hidden name. You shall oversee the myriad regions, examine the ten thousand immortals, settle the subtle and obscure, and deliver the countless people. You must not rashly disclose it in violation of the prohibitions—guard it well.

Thereupon, the Azure Lad ascended to the Vermilion Chamber of the Cinnabar Spirit above the clouds, purified himself for three months, tore silk to invoke the spirits, and with golden sheep and silver geese, paid homage to Heaven to receive the real. The Lord of the Dao declared: The Nine Heavens have strictures—according to the rules, it is transmitted once in ten thousand kalpas. Now, as the cycles intersect and qi returns to Supreme Clarity, the Dao is to be practiced in this era. Follow the dark statutes: within seven hundred years, there may be one who hears the three transmissions. If none are worthy, seal it and return it to the Nine Heavens, or entrust it to the chambers of the Nine Caves in the famous mountains. To lightly divulge or neglect it brings retribution upon the seven generations: drawing from the dark waves to irrigate the Four Rivers, bearing the weight of the mountains to fill the seas and oceans. This karmic response of fortune and misfortune leaves no room for error. You must clearly heed these words and act with caution.

Whenever one wishes to tread the Void Constant, flying the net to escape form and transform appearance, and soaring into the Jade Clarity, one should practice this seven times in a month. On the Eight Nodes and the Six Ding days, one may also perform this Dao. On the appointed day, enter the chamber, burn incense to the left and right, arrange the mat and diagram, face south, and knock the teeth twenty-four times. Close the eyes and visualize the Five Stars shining brilliantly in the five directions. After a long while, let them descend and enter the five viscera within one’s body: the Metal Star into the Lung Palace, the Earth Star into the Spleen Palace, the Fire Star into the Heart Palace, the Wood Star into the Liver Palace, and the Water Star into the Kidney Palace. The Five Stars’ radiance illuminates the five viscera, and one feels the body suffused with warmth. Then visualize the Five August Ladies of the Stars and the Twenty-Five Celestial Lords of the Void Constant’s Dawn, recalling their surnames, personal names, and attire, each in their respective direction.

When all is complete, softly recite the prayer:
*Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth—*
*Together they govern the Four Origins.*
*The dark essence flows and reflects,*
*Illuminating the Five Gates.*
*Within reside the Five August Ladies and Spirit Lords,*
*The Twenty-Five Celestial Lords of the Void Constant,*
*Transforming shapes and shadows,*
*Uniting in thousands, dividing in myriad ways.*
*Descend into the five viscera,*
*Congeal to form Jade Immortals.*
*Refine my seven po,*
*Nurture my three hun.*
*Raise my form to ascend,*
*Fly into the Dipper’s Gate.*
*Roam and play in the Upper Capital,*
*The Five Stars gathered as one.*
*Today, in this dark celebration,*
*I request that all be as recited.*

Afterward, draw in the star-light qi twenty-five times and swallow it. Then rise and ascend the net.

Standing with feet together upon the Star of Great White, hold the breath for seven cycles, then face west and softly recite the prayer:

*Seven Gates of the West,*
*White qi flies in radiance.*
*Above dwells the Luminous Emperor,*
*the Bright August of Lesser Yin.*
*His name is Golden Supreme Essence,*
*robed in feathered garments.*
*Resplendent essence flows and reflects,*
*illuminating the Golden Palace.*
*Named the Five Points,*
*ancestral of the Void Constant,*
*he bears the talisman and raises the standard,*
*summoning yin and seizing yang,*
*transforming water and fire across seventy-four directions.*
*Grant me flying steps,*
*concealing my form to enter the void,*
*driving the white chariot,*
*roaming the cloud chambers.*
*May heaven and earth endure,*
*eternally without end.*

Afterward, tilt the head back and swallow the star-light qi seven times. Then take twelve steps with feet together, standing upon the Star of Quelling, hold the breath for twelve cycles, face southwest, look to the heavens, and softly recite the prayer:

*Four Qi of the Central August,*
*overseeing the Eight Spirits,*
*within the Jade Terrace and Purple Chamber,*
*divine points give rise to transformation.*
*There resides the Primordial August,*
*the Five Emperors’ hidden names,*
*styled the Stepping Constant,*
*serene within the Yellow Court.*
*Clothed in flying clouds,*
*crowned with radiant essence,*
*holding the register and talisman,*
*adorned with falling fire bells,*
*grant me flying steps,*
*reveal to me the divine names.*
*Descend into the spleen palace,*
*quelling the spirits and settling the essence.*
*Ascend to heaven and enter the clouds,*
*concealing my shadow and eluding my form,*
*transforming the myriad things,*
*roaming the Jade Clarity.*
*May I, with the August Lord,*
*together preserve the Great Luminance.*

Afterward, draw in the star-light qi twelve times and swallow it. Then take three steps with feet together, standing upon the Star of Blazing Deluder, hold the breath for three cycles, face south, and softly recite the prayer:

*Three Gates gleam resplendent,*
*cinnabar light flows with essence.*
*Mysterious qi surges and billows,*
*illuminating the Southern Darkness.*
*Above dwells the Crimson August,*
*the Five Emperors’ bright spirits.*
*His name is Wandering Radiance,*
*clothed in brocade and patterned essence,*
*crowned with a treasure diadem,*
*girded with jade bells.*
*He enters and exits the Vermilion Palace,*
*the Purple Chamber and Crimson Citadel.*
*Preserve my life’s record,*
*inscribed in the Southern Palace.*
*Grant me flying steps,*
*transforming my qi and concealing my form.*
*On an auspicious day, walk the Dao,*
*universally purifying heaven and earth.*
*May my heart-spirit congeal in true perfection,*
*the five hun gleam with clarity,*
*aligning with the three qi,*
*merging with the Fire Star’s radiance.*

Afterward, draw in the star-light qi three times and swallow it. Then take nine steps with feet together, standing upon the Star of Jupiter, hold the breath for nine cycles, face east, and softly recite the prayer:

*Nine Qi of the East,*
*Azure Heaven’s Jade Gate.*
*Within dwells the Azure Morning,*
*the Lord of the Mystic Above.*
*Flowing azure surges and billows,*
*this is the Celestial Hun.*
*His name is Great Luminance,*
*exalted of heaven and earth,*
*clothed in phoenix robes,*
*striped skirts of the tiger.*

*Preserve my life’s record,*
*guard my liver’s gate.*
*Externally radiant, internally luminous,*
*the liver palace congeals into immortals.*
*Welcome my ascent,*
*to audience with the Imperial Morning.*

Afterward, draw in the star-light qi nine times and swallow it. Then take five steps with feet together, standing upon the Star of Mercury, hold the breath for five cycles, face north, and softly recite the prayer:

*Five Qi of the Northern Mystery,*
*the Mystic Gate gleams with spirit.*
*The Northern Morning flows and reflects,*
*the Great Culmen of Jade Clarity.*
*Within dwells the Supreme August,*
*the Five Constants’ exalted name.*
*His name is Yin’s Primordial Stillness,*
*robed in mysterious clarity,*
*crowned with a jade diadem,*
*girded with flowing bells,*
*golden seals and jade standards,*
*jade pendants gleaming resplendent.*
*Wandering the radiant morning,*
*gazing beside the Eight Darknesses,*

*Preserve the five spirits’ record,*
*the viscera flourishing in brilliance.*
*Internally and externally replete,*

The Dao of the Eternal Void concludes here.

The Most High practices the Dao of the Eternal Void. On each appointed day, they purify themselves, burn incense, and seclude in a separate chamber, free from worldly affairs, performing the rites in secrecy. Calming the mind and settling the intent, they visualize the divine perfected, with stars arrayed in orderly ranks, each distinct and clear. They proceed slowly, stepping through the celestial net.

Within five years, the Imperial Lord and the August Consort descend without fail; the Primordial August Five Stars cast their radiance without omission. The inner form becomes luminously clear, and the myriad spirits undergo transformation. After seven years of practice, one may divide their form into a myriad manifestations and conceal their traces within the Nine Voids. After fourteen years, they soar through the Great Void, ascending to the Dipper’s dawn.

If constrained by worldly duties or circumstances, should one obtain this scripture but be unable to perform the stepping ritual, simply burn incense, hold the scripture, face north toward the stars, and visualize the divine perfected, praying for transcendence. Thus, all calamities are averted, misfortunes dispelled, the spirit brightens, the body purifies, and one regains youthful countenance. Practicing thus for fourteen years extends life by seven hundred years.

Impurity, negligence, or leakage of secrets brings ruin upon the entire household, with punishment extending to the seven generations of ancestors. The correspondence of sin and fortune is most evident. From here, proceed with seven steps to ascend upon the Metal Star and recite one invocation. From the Metal Star, take twelve steps to ascend upon the Earth Star and recite another invocation. From the Earth Star, take three steps to ascend upon the Fire Star and recite another invocation. From the Fire Star, take nine steps to ascend upon the Wood Star and recite another invocation. From the Wood Star, take five steps to ascend upon the Water Star and recite another invocation. When the Five Stars are completed, recite one final invocation. Then, beginning again from the Metal Star, repeat the sequence fifteen times in reverse, stepping without invocation. Thus, the Dao is fulfilled.

After completing the steps of the Five Stars, proceed from the outer path with seven steps to ascend upon the Earth Gate of the Nine Constants, then proceed through the Five Constants in sequence. Return to the Metal Star and recite one invocation, then take twelve steps to ascend upon the Upper Constant and proceed through the Five Constants in sequence. Return to the Earth Star and recite one invocation, then take three steps to ascend upon the Void Constant and proceed through the Five Constants in sequence. Return to the Fire Star and recite one invocation, then take nine steps to ascend upon the Nine Constants and proceed through the Five Constants in sequence. Return to the Wood Star and recite one invocation, then take five steps to ascend upon the Yin Constant and proceed through the Five Constants in sequence. Finally, return to the Water Star and recite one invocation.

The seven stars above are all the majestic deities of the Nine Essences Emperor Dawn of the Nine Heavens, governing the palaces of the seven stars, revolving the celestial radiance, summoning and hastening kalpic destinies, transforming the myriad things, and merging heaven and earth. Knowing their inner names extends life by seven thousand years. Cultivating for fourteen years ascends one to the dawn in broad daylight.

After seven years, they may divide radiance and disperse form, transform the myriad things, merge the hidden and obscure, and soar through the Great Void, ascending to Jade Clarity.

The five True August Emperor Lords of the Five Star Palaces conceal their hidden names, which the Supreme One has secreted within the Nine Numinous Upper Palace of the Purple Chamber. They are not transmitted to beginners. Those who obtain them must have borne the mysterious chart and inscribed tablets, their true names having been inscribed in reverse across ninety thousand kalpas prior, destined to receive these texts. They shall become ministers to the future sages, Jade Clarity Perfected Ones.

Within the Eastern Yang Primordial Palace resides the True August Emperor Lord’s August Consort, surnamed Opening Constancy, with the taboo name Treasure Countenance, styled Soaring Cloud, and the true name [ ], who wears a blue-green brocade mantle and a green-feathered flying skirt, her hair coiled in a cascading cloud chignon.

The Five Star Consorts’ inner yin hidden names are concealed by the Supreme One within the Purple Canopy Palace of the Dark Dipper. These five consorts revolve heaven and turn earth, expand and contract the Three Luminaries, transform mountains and rivers, alter the Five Phases, shift the myriad things, and conceal the hidden and obscure. Those who know their Dao shall no longer tread upon the earth’s gates, their souls passing beyond Mount Tai. They shall become the Perfected of Jade Clarity, emerging once every ten thousand kalpas in accordance with the statutes.

To cultivate the Way of the Nine Dawns and Five Stars, one should enter the chamber at midnight on the eight solar terms and one’s own life-destiny day, face north, and click the teeth nine times. Closing the eyes, visualize the Nine Stars, their radiance shining brilliantly upon the northern direction. Further visualize the Five Stars, their luminosity illuminating the five directions, their light cascading to illuminate one’s body, sensing oneself within a crimson glow, inwardly and outwardly obscure. After a long while, visualize the Nine Stars’ and Five Stars’ Imperial Lords, the August Lords and their consorts, the Nine Stars’ inner consorts—their surnames, taboo names, styles, and attire—each within their stellar palaces, all made distinct.

After a moment, the assembled deities reverently coalesce into a single infant, appearing as one newly born, named the Eternal Youth, styled the Divine King of Transformations. In his hands he holds the Nine Stars and Five Stars, their tassels adorning his entire body, bearing the sun and moon in his sash and mouth. The youth bathes your form in the radiance of sun, moon, and stars, your body enveloped in crimson light, inwardly and outwardly luminous and transparent—this is the Dao of the Myriad Transformations in Unity. Then, raising your head, swallow qi nine times and recite the incantation:

*"Great spirits of the celestial circuit,
Titled August Emperors,
Revolving the Nine Paths,
Essence blazing through the eight directions,
Luminous radiance streaming through the heavens,
Shooting forth rays and scattering light,
Concealed and dissolved in the profound,
Revolving to unite in the Purple Chamber,
Transforming myriad forms,
Congealing into the numinous youth,
Flowing within and without,
Jade Perfected of the four cardinals,
Left wielding the Fire Bell of Destiny,
Right striking the lightning’s flash,
Clouds and mists surging,
Resplendent patterns soaring,
Divine transformations of the Great One,
Brocade mantle and luminous robes,
Holding the sun and wearing the moon,
Adorned with celestial insignia,
Soaring through the Five Mornings,
Urging the turning of the Dipper’s net,
Following the heart’s desire,
Wherever the will extends,
Ascending to heaven, entering the obscure,
Transforming in a hundred ways,
Preserving and nurturing my body,
Heaven and earth sharing the merit,
My body sprouting feathered raiment,
Ascending to fly in the imperial palace."*

When finished, raise your head and swallow qi nine times to conclude. Profoundly meditate upon the Dao of the Nine Perfected and Five Mornings, concealed within the eight obscurities—this is the ultimate attainment of the practice.

To practice the Dao of the Void and Constant Transformations, regularly enter the chamber at noon on the eight solar terms and one’s own life-destiny day, face south, and click the teeth twelve times. Closing the eyes, visualize the Two Spirits of Void and Constant, along with the twenty-five Points’ Constants—their hidden names and attire—each in their respective directions, distinctly arrayed within the stellar palaces, their radiance streaming and luminous, mysteriously illuminating your body. After a long while, they suddenly transform into two beasts, the phoenix and the dark turtle, descending from the midst of heaven. The phoenix rides the crimson qi’s radiance, alighting upon your head; the dark turtle rides the white qi’s radiance, descending beneath your feet. The phoenix enters through your mud-pill, the dark turtle through your life-gate, the red and white qi intertwining throughout your body. You sense your form transforming into a phoenix, standing atop the dark turtle, enveloped in the red and white qi. Then, click the teeth twenty-five times, swallow qi twenty-five times, and raise your head to recite the incantation:

*"Heaven’s essence and earth’s spirit,
Titled Void and Constant,
Northward entering the Five Qi,
Southward governing the Three Yangs,
Wood generating flowing fire,
Seven Qi breaking harm,
Water irrigating the Nine Shocks,
Central Yuan ceasing its course,
Earth reigning to nurture metal,
Wood Qi concealed and stored,
Golden talismans commanding spirits,
The Great Emperor aiding and welcoming,
Six Wù fleeing Six Jǐ,
Concealed in the shadowy nether realms,
The Great One guarding the lungs,
Metal anchoring the kidneys and bowels,
Upper Yuan assisting the heart,
Refining the immortal’s liver palace,
Inwardly fresh and outwardly flourishing,
Jade Perfected filling the four cardinals,
Transforming myriad scenes,
Merging the two lights,
Numinous phoenix and dark turtle,
Divine beasts coming to welcome,
Profoundly entering the subtle,
Form and soul soaring together,
A thousand transformations, ten thousand changes,
Following the will’s intent,
East, west, south, north,
None fail to aid and support,
Eternally preserving heaven and earth,
Enjoying boundless blessings,
Attaining to wander with the Radiant Emperor,
In the Upper Capital."*

When finished, draw in the qi and swallow twice, then stop.
This is the Dao of the Ever-Concealed, the profound and subtle principle of wondrous workings, wherein all matters culminate.
Herein lies the myriad transformations, the body generating water and fire, merging with heaven and earth in perfect accord, fulfilling every intent and desire.
Those who attain this shall ascend to the rank of Immortal Duke, their names inscribed by the Northern Asterism, their records kept in the Southern Palace.
The Five Stars shall descend, ten thousand spirits shall serve as guards, and blessings and virtue shall arise naturally, requiring no external aid.
After nine years of cultivation, one shall attain flight, ascend to the celestial lodgings, and wander in revelry through the Jade Purity.
Without this method, all distant aspirations shall be cut off, and the spirit shall suffer no rest by night or day.

This is a celestial forbidden scripture. To lightly disclose or profane it brings guilt upon nine generations of ancestors and parents, while the offender’s own body shall perish abruptly, forever confined to the ghostly bureaus.

**The Hidden Essentials of the Dragon’s Flight on Nine-Path Silk**

The Most High Lord of the Great Dao, in the first year of the Supreme August Emperor’s reign, on the first day of the second month (a *jiǎzǐ* day), proclaimed an oath in the Heaven of Infinite Vastness, transmitting the *Feathered Scripture of Flight and the Ever-Concealed Transformations* to the Perfected Lord of the Northern Culmen.
At that time, the Nine Heavens’ Celestial Emperor, the Lofty Immortals, and the Great Sages all attended the oath ceremony. The Five Emperors wore sashes, ten thousand spirits stood in attendance, the sun and moon radiated their splendor, the host of stars arrayed their essence, the Seven Origins opened the gates, the Yellow Path ceased its motion, heaven and earth paused their mechanisms, and the Three Realms grew solemn and clear.
Crimson clouds cast their shade, purple mists soared on all sides, the time was harmonious, the day auspicious, and the Eight Sceneries unfolded in full.
Beneath the radiant dawn, the Lord of the Dao tore the silk and imparted the secret within his golden mouth. His words resounded through the Nine Heavens, and from afar he intoned the sacred name.
The Celestial Emperor rejoiced, the Heavenly Perfected bowed their heads, the demon kings restrained their forms, and they pledged to uphold the Mysterious Void. Thus, the Perfected Lord ascended to the Jade Purity.

The Five Elders were commanded to oversee the trial, the Four Directors to assist the Perfected, and the attending immortals to the left and right to divide the oath and proclaim it to the spirits.
Following the prescribed form of reverence, they faced north and intoned:
*"It is not for common ascent that we gather. By the mandate of the Nine Spirits, the revolutions shift ceaselessly, the sun and moon never halt. At this dawn hour, with sincere hearts and unbound forms, we hold the blade in the Southern Palace, inhale the cinnabar in the Cold Court.
The golden ram and silver crow are offered in homage to the Supreme Purity. The silk is torn to divide the scripture, and the oath is sworn before heaven. We beseech the Four Poles: let this be transmitted but once in ten thousand kalpas.
Should any betray these words, calamity shall strike the Seven Mysteries. Should any violate this covenant, their form shall be extinguished, their life and death forfeit, and they shall be eternally confined to the dark nether realms."*

When finished, the silk was torn to transmit the scripture, and the secret words were imparted orally.
The Heavenly Perfected descended, the Five Emperors guarded the spirit, the Nine Dawns bestowed nine hundred golden dawn lads and jade maidens, the Nine August Ones bestowed seven hundred jade flower maidens, and the Five August Ones further bestowed five hundred jade maidens each from the Five Emperors.
The Five Elders commanded their chariots, the Four Directors wielded their banners, twelve jade chariots of purple clouds flew in tandem, phoenix songs led the way, and celestial chimes followed behind.
The Six Masters cleared the path, nine dragons flanked the carriage, and thus they welcomed the Perfected Lord.
Ascending to the Northern Asterism’s Upper Palace of Jade Purity, he roamed and feasted among the Seven Origins, circled the Five Lodgings, traversed the Celestial Passes, and attained the rank of Supreme Immortal, governing the Palace of Vast Spirit in the Northern Culmen.
In the Supreme August Era, the text was transmitted to the Great Lord of the Eastern Florescence, the Azure Lad, to be passed on once in ten thousand kalpas according to the prescribed form.

The Dao of the Dragon’s Flight on Silk emerges from the Nine Heavens’ Celestial Emperor, bearing the names of the Nine Dawns, Five Stars, and the Ever-Concealed of heaven and earth.
As the precious, secret, numinous sound, it serves as the oath text. Unless one’s name was inscribed in the Mysterious Register of the Supreme Purity in a former life—having reversed the flow of ninety thousand kalpas—one shall not glimpse its passages or fathom its hidden tones.
Those who behold this text shall achieve immortality in life or death. Those who cultivate its Dao shall radiate divine light, and the Celestial Emperor shall descend. After seven years of concealment, they shall transform in a hundred ways, traversing the nether realms and floating through the Nine Void Heavens.
After fourteen years, they shall ascend at dawn and fly to the Jade Purity.
This is the great scripture of the ancestral lineage. By merely paying homage to the divine Perfected, one shall attain longevity, prolong life without end, repel a thousand calamities, and avert ten thousand misfortunes. Weapons shall be stilled, and all endeavors shall prosper.
When one goes forth, the Nine August Ones shall respond, a halo shall encircle their neck, and the Five Emperors shall provide guard. Wherever they turn, the directors shall welcome them, enabling them to serve the Sage Lord in the Palace of Supreme Purity.
This Dao existed coevally with the Primordial Beginning. The Nine Origins’ Void Sovereign transmitted it to the Most High Lord of the Great Dao, who passed it to the Later Sage, the Golden Portal Emperor Lord, as well as the Supreme Emperor Lord, the Celestial Emperor of the Grand Tenuity, and the Perfected Lord of the Northern Culmen, who entrusted it to the Great Lord of the Eastern Florescence, the Azure Lad.
According to the prescribed form, it is transmitted once in ten thousand kalpas to those among later learners who attain the Dao.

The method of transmission requires the recipient to be sincere and steadfast, offering ninety feet of crimson silk and fifty feet each of five-colored silk. They must seek a master who possesses the scripture and observe a hundred-day retreat—or seventy days, or seven days.
Upon a secluded altar on the Mysterious Peak, they shall face north to divide the oath and transmit the secret.
Five taels of golden ram are offered to the Five Stars, and nine taels of silver crow to the Nine Dawns. These two offerings are presented to heaven upon receiving the scripture, and the disciple pledges devotion to the master.
At the *zǐ* hour, the offerings are exposed upon the altar: the ram wrapped in crimson silk placed to the east, the crow wrapped in white silk placed to the west.
They swear the oath before the Nine Heavens, divide the silk, and orally transmit the secret names. At the moment of transmission, they follow the same prayer as above.
This is the precious Dao of the noble Perfected, an oath never to be betrayed. Without such an oath, any careless transmission shall bring the master and disciple alike to annihilation, their seven generations of ancestors condemned, and their souls unredeemed for ten thousand kalpas.
The prohibitions of heaven demand careful consideration.

When ascending the altar, the disciple holds the ram and crow, faces north, and bows nine times. Then, they bow once to each of the five directions, beginning in the west, circling to the south, and ending in the west, prostrating to the east and placing the ram and crow to the master’s left and right.
The master stands at the center, faces north, and knocks his teeth nine times, declaring:
*"I, the Perfected Minister of [Name] Peak, [Personal Name], dare, at this auspicious time of triple conjunction, ascend the imperial altar, bare my form and sincere heart, purify my fast, and partake of cinnabar. I array this oath before heaven."*

May the Most High deign to cast its radiance upon this humble servant, turning its gaze to the Minister of [Name] Peak, [Personal Name], whom the Northern Emperor has exalted. May the blessings of past lives extend deeply into future rebirths, the wheel of fortune turning without cease across the Nine Heavens. Inscribed upon the mystic registers of destiny, this day I am granted the vision to behold the arcane scriptures and the voice to chant the hymns of the Imperial Unity. Envious of the immortals and yearning for divine communion, I now, within the midst of [Name] Heaven, receive the rites of transcendence—the esoteric formulas of feathered flight through empty space.

I hereby supplicate the Ten Thousand Emperors, the Supreme Primal Sovereign, the Lofty Immortals and Great Saints, the Boundless Lords of the Dao, beseeching them to turn their luminous gaze and graciously oversee this sacred covenant. May the qi of the Perfected Immortals of the Jade Pure Upper Palace attend and guard my person. I invoke the Five Emperors, the Five Peaks, the myriad spirits, the river and sea deities—all to bear witness to this oath and to transmit the teachings in accordance with the established protocols.

The left half of the silk writ shall be inscribed on two *chi* of white silk, with one half on each *chi*, the two halves joined by a central talisman. The recipient shall inscribe the master’s taboo name in purple ink, and the text and talisman in vermilion. Once the master’s transmission of the taboo name is complete, the Jade Lads and Jade Maidens shall attend the recipient’s person. The central talisman shall then be split, each half to be worn upon the body: the left for men, the right for women. The writ shall be encased in a cinnabar-silk pouch and worn over the heart.

Beware the veils of life and death—three transgressions shall scatter the celestial lodgings, and the Five Emperors shall weep in lament. The soul’s essence shall dissipate, the spirit wander astray, and the hun and po be lost, bringing death within the year. The prohibitions of the Nine Heavens are absolute: observe them, and the numinous radiance of heaven shall descend, divine immortals shall alight, the body shall command water and fire, and the myriad transformations shall submit of their own accord.

**The Jade Talisman of the White-Feathered, Black-Quilled Numinous Flight**

The Primordial Father of the Nine Heavens and the Celestial Mother, the Supreme Perfected Lord, together ascended the resplendent dragon chariot, accompanied by the thousand immortals and ten thousand riders of the Mulberry Grove. The flying immortals harnessed this celestial wheel, swift as lightning and fleeting as mist, their bodies moving in harmony with the cosmos. They chanted sacred hymns, wandering the caverns of the Mystic Mound, resting by the limpid waves, roaming the purple void’s embrace, and halting at the timeless edge of the ageless realm.

At that moment, the celestial origin shone brilliantly, the five dawns turned their light, and the three pure clouds wove purple mists, exhaling fragrant blossoms that encircled the sun, their fragrance dispersing into the Great Void. Radiant splendor intertwined, the three torches merged their brilliance, congealing the true essence in perfect union. They chewed the root of the sun, imbibed the mysterious and infused the void, unfurled the resplendent golden scriptures, and intoned the nine subtleties in a resonant chant. The numinous chariot soared, their wondrous thoughts stirring the Great Silence, their inner contemplation awakening the Spontaneous.

On the third day of the third month of the first year of the *Above Emperor* era, at the dawn of the Primordial’s revelation, the Mystic Numinous descended in a chariot drawn by white simurghs, black-quilled phoenixes bearing in their beaks the silk writ of the *Feathered Flight through Empty Space*. The jade essence of the flying immortals guided the mist, the host of spirits guarded the numinous, their luminous presence suffusing the Nine Empyreans, resplendent in the courtyard of the Jade Void. They descended upon the Mystic Mound of the Supreme Perfected to transmit the precious scriptures.

On that day, as the Supreme Perfected Lord completed his fast in the Upper Clarity, the Celestial Emperor of the Great Thearch, the Three Pure Primordial Ladies of the Purple Tenuity, the Heavenly Emperor, the Celestial Emperor of the Supreme Tenuity, and the august guests of the Lofty Jade Sovereign all descended together. They kindled incense of a hundred harmonies, arrayed the floating banners of the five-colored spirit officials, and took their jade seats in the Purple Palace. The assembled immortals circumambulated the scriptures thrice, whereupon the Three Pure Primordial Ladies rose, faced west, and intoned in a voice of mystic clarity the *Ode of Celebration for the Feathered Writ*, extolling the divine scriptures. Their words began:

*"The vapors gather in the halls of the Great Void,
A numinous wind scatters rare fragrance..."*

The mystic radiance soars aloft in the void,
A gentle breeze bears the sun on its wings.
The white simurgh swiftly follows the phoenix,
Its beak holding the divine *Feathered Writ*.
Beating their pinions, they shake the nine heavens,
Their mournful cries illumine the dark beams.
Arcane incantations issue forth through the air,
The pure governance of the Dao knows no end.
The assembled immortals join in celebration,
Bowing their heads in homage to the Jade Sovereign.

When the recitation concluded, the Celestial Emperor of the Great Thearch rose again, facing north, and intoned:

*"The dark phoenix darts on cloud-wings,
The white simurgh rejoices in its stride.
Flying fragrance blends with fragrant blossoms,
Meteors gleam along the clouded thoroughfares.
A mighty rainbow reins the long bridle,
Flying immortals support one another.
The ten thousand perfected celebrate this felicitous fortune,
Joyous phoenixes roam the empty midst.
The Primal Beginning leaves no trace,
Yet the mystic resonance seeks itself.
Beating their wings without awaiting a chariot,
They drift lightly upon the mists of affinity.
The treasure scripture weaves the dark warp,
The five bodies command the numinous talismans.
In celebration they bow before the Court of Blessings,
Circumambulating the incense thrice."*

When this recitation ended, the Heavenly Emperor rose, facing east, and intoned:

*"White feathers and dark wings flutter,
Riding the floating mists in cyclic return.
Flowing fragrance overflows the ten heavens,
Fragrant fungi flourish in the Supreme Tenuity.
The numinous scripture unlocks the hidden mechanism,
The *Feathered Writ* shines with mystic splendor.
The supreme Dao is fundamentally without obscurity,
Holding fast to the true, the radiant scene soars white."*

When this too concluded, the Venerable Lord of the Great Perfected donned his ritual vestments: a crown of the Infinite Three Treasures of Heaven, a robe of seamless nine-colored flying clouds adorned with luminous feathered script, a tinkling bell at his left, and the Seven Primes at his right. Facing due south, he prostrated himself. The Celestial Emperor of the Supreme Tenuity then commanded the Feathered Immortal Attendant to raise a golden table, bearing the scripture as he stood facing north, and presented it to the Great Perfected. All the immortals voiced their approval, and the Great Perfected rose to receive the scripture. A golden light emanated from his countenance, and the five agents of his body spontaneously generated the *Numinous Flying Jade Talismans*. Ascending with the assembled perfected, they boarded the white simurgh’s chariot, drawn by black-winged phoenixes, to feast in the verdant groves and azure waters of the Eastern Expanse of Eternal Yang, the precincts of Fusang, the mouth of the Nine Springs. They journeyed west to the dark-feathered plain of the White Wilderness by the banks of the Mengsi, south to the Crimson Mound and the essence of extreme flame in the southern lands of Xia, north to the frigid halls of the Northern Darkness and the abode of the Cold Waters, and circled the ten absolute peaks of the Yellow Qi and the Yang Essence in the Great Mysterious Jade Capital, the Golden Terrace, the Jade Chamber, and the Cinnabar Palace. They roamed the ten heavens and the eight domains of the Grotto Clarity, governing the countless perfected. No heaven was beyond their reach, no hidden realm beyond their purview, no *qi* beyond their command, no immortal beyond their charge. They universally governed the host of spirits, and from heaven downward, none failed to model their virtue upon the Great Perfected or revere the *Feathered Writ*.

Thereupon, the Celestial Lords each ascended their dark palanquins, and after seven thousand kalpas, transmitted the scripture to the Most High Lord of the Great Dao. The *Upper Numinous Flying Jade Talisman of the Dark Immortal Feathered Essence* is worn for seven years, enabling one to ride the void and ascend to the Seven Primes. Those who cultivate the *Feathered Writ’s* flying paces without this talisman cannot ascend the void to the dark mysteries. The recipient pledges to heaven with ninety feet of azure brocade. On the day of ascetic practice, inscribing the talisman upon the left palm allows one to grasp the azure radiance and take flight. Inscribing nine inches of azure silk and wearing it on the left elbow summons the Six Jia and Twelve Spirits, with twelve *Numinous Flying Jade Maidens* attending at the left.

The *Lower Numinous Flying Jade Talisman of the Primal Feathered Essence of Dark Jade* is worn for seven years, enabling one to ride the void and ascend to the Five Stars. Those who practice the flying paces to ascend the dark mysteries without this talisman cannot traverse the void. The recipient pledges to heaven with sixty feet of white brocade. On the day of ascetic practice, inscribing the talisman upon the right palm allows one to grasp the white radiance and take flight. Inscribing nine inches of white silk and wearing it on the right elbow summons the Six Jia and Twelve Spirits, with twelve *Numinous Flying Jade Maidens* attending at the right.

The *Left Numinous Flying Jade Talisman of the Dark Qi’s Primal Essence and White Feathered Writ* is worn for nine years, enabling one to ride the void and ascend to the Five Stars. Those who practice the flying paces to ascend the dark mysteries without this talisman cannot tread the clouds to ascend the dark mysteries. The recipient pledges to heaven with eighty feet of cinnabar brocade. On the day of ascetic practice, inscribing the talisman upon the sole of the left foot allows one to tread the void and take flight. Inscribing nine inches of crimson silk and wearing it on the left elbow summons the Six Jia and Twelve Spirits, with twelve *Numinous Flying Jade Maidens* attending at the front.

The *Right Numinous Flying Jade Talisman of the Primal Qi’s Essence and Ascending Dark Feathered Writ* is worn for nine years, enabling one to ride the flying clouds and traverse the Jade Clarity. Those who cultivate the flying paces without this talisman cannot tread the Seven Primes to ascend the void. The recipient pledges to heaven with fifty feet of dark brocade. On the day of ascetic practice, inscribing the talisman upon the sole of the right foot allows one to tread the dark and take flight. Inscribing nine inches of black silk and wearing it on the right elbow summons the Six Jia and Twelve Spirits, with twelve *Numinous Flying Jade Maidens* attending at the rear.

The *Great Numinous Flying Jade Talisman of the Yang Qi’s Yellow Essence and Flying Feathered Writ* is worn for nine years, causing a golden light to emanate from the face, enabling one to vanish while sitting or standing and to fly through the great void. Those who cultivate the flying paces without this talisman cannot ascend to the stellar pivots or transcend the Nine Darks. The recipient pledges to heaven with twelve feet of yellow brocade. On the day of ascetic practice, inscribing the talisman before the heart allows one to exhale *qi* as clouds and ride them in flight. Inscribing nine inches of yellow silk and wearing it on the left elbow summons the Six Jia and Twelve Spirits, with twelve *Numinous Flying Jade Maidens* attending the body.

In all practices of meditative visualization upon the Seven Stars, one must first ingest the five talismans before inscribing them. When inscribing or ingesting the talismans, face east, click the teeth twelve times, and pray aloud:

*"Dark Void and Purple Clarity,
Flying *Feathered Writ*,
Above you illumine the cloud palaces,
Below you command the thousand spirits.
You govern the Six Jia,
Transport my bodily form,
Traverse the celestial warp,
Ascend to grasp the Dipper’s essence.
Congeal the hun and solidify the po,
Internally secure and fill the self.
Exiting the void and entering the dark,
Ever abide with the qi."*

Upon completion, ingest the talisman and inscribe it upon the five centers, then proceed with the practice. After nine years of such cultivation, one may ride the void and command the clouds, flying through the Great Clarity. The *Left* and *Right Numinous Flying Jade Talismans* emerge from the *qi* of spontaneity, transmitted by the Great Perfected to ascend the void, tread the celestial warp, entwine the Seven Primes, and ascend to the Jade Clarity, perfecting the *Flying Feathered Writ*.

Those who attain it become divine immortals; those who wear it become perfected beings. Those who cultivate it summon the white-luan chariot and the black-winged phoenix to welcome their bodies, ascending to the Jade Clarity Palace to roam and feast in the Eternal Yang. The Most High Lord of the Great Dao transmitted it to the Supreme Prime Lord of Grand Simplicity and the Celestial Emperor of the Grand Tenuity. When the Dao is practiced to completion, it is concealed within the Numinous Capital of the Most High. According to the regulations, it is transmitted once every three thousand years, and must not be lightly divulged or revealed to celestial perfected ones. Those who violate the covenant and betray their oaths will have their bodies consigned to the offices of ghosts, their misfortune extending to nine generations, bound in the Dark Springs.

*The Flying Feathered Writ: Nine Perfected Ascending to the Primordial Upper Record*
The Most High Lord of the Great Dao once received *The Flying Feathered Writ: Nine Perfected Ascending to the Primordial Upper Record*, its treasured words inscribed in purple script and green-gold characters, the Dao of traversing the void and treading the empty sky upon floating radiance, bestowed by the Highest Lord of the Dao in the Jade Clarity Upper Palace. Thereupon, the Most High Lord of the Great Dao transmitted its essentials to the Jade Emperor of the Highest Clarity. The Jade Emperor of the Highest Clarity transmitted it to the Supreme Prime Lord of Grand Simplicity, who in turn transmitted it to the Celestial Emperor of the Grand Tenuity. The Celestial Emperor of the Grand Tenuity practiced its true secrets and transmitted it to the Yellow Radiance Lord of the Central Dawn. The Yellow Radiance Lord of the Central Dawn transmitted it to the Purple Numinosity Lord of the Primordial Beginning, who transmitted it to the Yellow Elder Lord of the Center. The Yellow Elder Lord of the Center transmitted it to the Jade Guardian King of the Nine Subtleties, the Great Minister of Fate, the High Dawn Master, the Azure Lad, and the Great Lord Fanmei, instructing them to teach this text to those worthy of becoming perfected beings. All who possess the *Crimson Record of Grand Simplicity* or whose names are inscribed in the Golden Portal shall be permitted to behold this text. Those unworthy shall not encounter it. Should one wish to transmit it, one must first attain perfect resonance and response before bestowing it. They shall swear an unbreakable oath, pledging inviolable secrecy.

Those who possess this scripture shall be attended by twenty-four Jade Lads and twenty-four Jade Maidens sent by the Three Primordial Lords of Grand Simplicity, who shall stand to the left and right of the scripture, correcting and restraining transgressions of carelessness and disclosure, guarding and protecting the bearer. This is the Dao of the central perfected, not of the ordinary ranks of immortals. It is the central perfection of harmony, aligned with the registers of the Three Primes, its name recorded in Grand Simplicity. In action, it is marked by purple-feathered standards; in travel, it is borne by the eight-radiance cloud chariot. Ten thousand spirits lead the way, a thousand perfected follow behind. Nine phoenixes cry in unison, celestial zithers play their strings. Divine dragons open the path, the Five Emperors’ banners flutter. They traverse the Great Void, roaming and feasting in the Cinnabar Empyrean, attaining the rank of Master of the Jade Ministers among the Perfected of the Highest Clarity.

All who possess *The Flying Feathered Writ of the Most High: Ascending to the Primordial Nine Perfected* shall observe the rule of six transmissions in three thousand years. If a worthy recipient is found, it may be bestowed in a single day. If none are found when the three-thousand-year limit expires, six copies shall be inscribed in red on plain silk, sealed within the Golden Terrace Chamber of Mount Emei. Beyond this, it shall not be transmitted again. To transmit it to the unworthy is to divulge the Dao of the perfected. To receive it without upholding the regulations is to violate the oath of the perfected. The transmitter is the scripture master; the recipient is their disciple. Those who defy the scripture, disregard its precepts, or reveal its treasured words shall have their seven generations of ancestors brought before the Dark Capital to endure the trials of the Wind Blade. Their bodies shall become lowly ghosts, submerged in the River of Eternal Night.

To receive the *Flying Feathered Writ*, scatter gold as an oath. To know the taboos of immortality, offer a silk kerchief as a pledge. Once you comprehend the feathered scripture, heaven and earth become as one. Having heard these mysterious words, you shall transcend and ride the auspicious clouds—this is what it means.

*Inscribed on the stone stele of the Terrace of Committed Feathers.*

The Three Primordial Lords of Grand Simplicity have said: Immortals first know the Dao of concealing themselves beneath the Dipper’s stars, yet do not know the method by which perfected beings conceal the Dipper’s stars. The Nine Dipper stars are the true canopy of the Celestial Pivot, the radiant treasure of the Mysterious Axis, the mechanism that binds the eight directions, the hub that revolves the nine measures. They turn and shade the square and round, governing and harmonizing the qi, regulating yin and yang, presiding over all without exception.

The Dipper’s stars—brilliant and luminous—veil the night. The turning jade mechanism sets them in motion. The Four Symbols flow and descend from them. Mysterious brightness shines resplendently, their majestic radiance blazing. The Supreme Lord of the Great Void has said: Immortals merely know how to chew yin and yang, to exhale and inhale the two qi, yet do not know that the Dipper’s stars are the root and repository of yin and yang, the mysterious warp of the two images. They toil arduously at the waves’ ends, failing to recognize the ease of tending to the source. They shelter beneath its branches and leaves, yet lose the root and foundation. Why not conceal the Nine Dipper, refining and forging the supreme image?

Practice this for fourteen years, and the Most High shall welcome you with a jade wheel. You shall traverse the void and tread the empty sky, ascending to the Highest Clarity, ranked among the supreme perfected. Your spirit shall return, your countenance rejuvenated, and all spirits shall attend your chariot. The Azure Lad has said: Immortals merely know the great majesty of the turning jade mechanism, its brilliance startling the myriad stars. They behold the flowing radiance of the nine paths, delight in its circular motion to gather the spirit, sheltering beneath it to seek great attainment, employing it to seek divine immortality. Yet they still do not know how to turn the nine lights inward to illuminate, to conceal the bright Dipper within the muddy pellet. Thereby, the hun is congealed and the po refined, virtue and cloud-mist harmonized. Those who master this Dao ascend to the Highest Clarity; those who attain it become supreme perfected.

Thus, the perfected embrace the great image to conceal the radiance, enclose the Dipper’s essence to hide the self. My former master therefore rode upon green clouds to the left, reined the crimson dawn to the right, ascending to Grand Simplicity, traversing the void and treading the empty sky. Visualize the Dipper’s stars as purple, its warp as red. Sense the purple qi as warm and gentle. Envision the stars’ sizes as you practice. This is the oral instruction of the Azure Lad.

Formerly, Master Wucheng, Master Guxi, Master Guangcheng, and Master Qingzhen together visualized the qi of the Dipper’s stars, merging it with their bodies to enter the lotus seed. Suddenly, they beheld within the lotus a golden pond a thousand leagues wide, jade mountains ten thousand qing in expanse. Palaces, terraces, chambers, and halls stretched unbroken into the clouds. Vermilion trees bore fruit, purple blossoms bloomed in gardens. Azure carriages and mysterious yellow banners, the Three Simplicities and Eight Wheels—wondrous sights beyond naming.

The four masters roamed for some time, then turned their gaze in leisurely contemplation and returned. At that moment, they were unaware of the lotus seed’s center—such is the principle of the great entering the small, transformation without trace, the utmost resonance of stellar visualization, the essence of vastness and constriction. Thus may the tip of a hair become the Eight Extremes; how could the lotus seed not be wondrous?

On the first, third, or fifth day of the lunar month, at midday or midnight—these are the appointed times. Enter the hall, sit upright, face north, and clasp your hands. Regulate the breath, close the eyes, and then visualize the nine stars of the Northern Dipper descending into the head’s Mud-Pill Palace, with the Dipper’s handle pointing forward and its bowl tilted upward. After a long while, suddenly behold within the Dipper’s bowl a great divine figure, whose robes and name accord with the invocation’s words. After a great while, the head should grow slightly warm, gently so. This is the true qi of the Nine Essences of the Upper Prime entering the head, thus the unusual warmth—a sign of response to the verification of resonance.

Then swallow saliva fifty times and click the teeth nine times. With the left hand’s third finger, press between the brows and softly recite the prayer:

“Supreme Purple Radiance, honored of the Nine Paths,
Canopy of sevenfold splendor, revolving brilliance of ten thousand dawns,
Moving, you command the lofty spirits; still, you harmonize with the luminous clouds.
Yin and yang flow and irrigate, the single qi divides at the center,
Roaming and aiding beyond all bounds, illuminating and brightening the host of heavens.
This month, this day, this hour, ascend to the Mud-Pill Palace.
The primal essence gathers and resonates, transforming into a great spirit,
Named Marvelous Pivot, whose child is the Numinous Net,
Seated upright within the Dipper, roaming my Bright Hall.
Feathered phoenix cloak of purple, tiger-embroidered cinnabar robes,
Left side girded with jade pendants, right waist hung with golden bells,
Holding a flowing tassel, head crowned with dawn’s light.
Exhaling qi to bathe the essence, the Mud-Pill Palace is made sound,
Hun and po congeal in harmony, planting the flowering pillars and beams.
Let me become a flying immortal, traversing the void and treading the empty sky,
Ascend to the Upper Clarity, rein the tiger and command the dragon,
Pay court to the Jade Emperor in the north, the Jasper-Limned Upper Palace,
And in the west, prostrate before the Great Simplicity, bowing to the Three Primes.”

When the prayer is finished, swallow saliva thirty times and click the teeth nine times. Recite the prayer again as before, then rise, face north, and bow twice; face west, and bow twice. No longer close the eyes; the practice is complete. This may also be performed on the bed in a quiet chamber, without descending to the ground for the bows.

The true practitioner values stability in what is inherently stable, honoring the wondrous and subtle while avoiding convoluted deviations that disrupt the natural order of rest and repose. The essential Dao is unburdened—thus transcending all comparison. The subsequent three invocations all follow and emulate this method, differing only in their prayers and the orientation of the visualized stars.

The key lies in performing this within a secluded chamber, ensuring no one witnesses the visualization. For during this practice, jade youths and jade maidens stand beside you as overseers. One must not approach mourning rites, encounter corpses, or come into contact with impurities. Clothing, bedding, headscarves, and footwear must not be misused or lent to those of a different kind. What is this "different kind"? Those whose aspirations do not align with yours. Those not of like mind should not share your mat, nor should those not of your covenant share your vessel. Daoists and laypeople differ: those who revere the Six Heavens or serve mountain and river demons must not be entertained in your chamber, nor should you partake of their food, wear their garments, or don their headscarves. This is to avoid the foul qi of their corpse-like impurity and to block the passage of their perverse winds. Such is the true Dao of the true Dao, the essence of the most refined essence.

If one can embody this refinement, one attains the true Dao; by shunning impurity, one gains renewal. But those who dwell in chaos, mingling the foul with the fragrant in the same vessel, failing to distinguish the divine, neglecting to refine their qi, cohabiting with the licentious while sharing space with the upright, allowing perverse winds to unsettle the heart or treading in dust without aspiring to transcendence—such seekers will find no truth. As the radiant pearl does not emerge from a cesspit, nor does mediocre talent flourish in exalted ranks, so too is this principle.

When essence and resonance align, the numinous responds with subtle efficacy. Jade blossoms manifest as signs, and divine radiance shines forth as verification. Unless they are your teacher, do not speak of this lightly.

The great spirits within the Dipper are the essences of the Nine Stars, born suddenly through resonant transformation. When practicing this method, first visualize their names and forms, then conclude with the invocation. After the invocation, the spirits will appear—visualize them again as before. If the star spirit of the Mud-Pill Palace is to be constantly visualized, let it reside within. Model all practices after this example.

Visualize the Dipper’s stars descending until, through intense focus, you suddenly feel them within your form. If at first they do not come, persist in visualization until they seem to dwell within—this is sufficient to evoke resonance. With time, one naturally enters the wondrous.

On the seventh, ninth, and thirteenth days of the lunar month, at the hour of *yu zhong* or midnight, enter your chamber, sit upright, clasp your hands, regulate your breath, and close your eyes. Then visualize the Nine Stars of the Northern Dipper descending into your heart, with the handle of the Dipper pointing upward toward your throat and the *kui* (the Dipper’s bowl) facing outward. After a long while, you will suddenly see within the *kui* a great spirit, clad and named as described in the invocation. Eventually, you will feel warmth in your heart as true qi enters.

Then swallow saliva fifty times and click your teeth nine times. Raise your right hand’s second finger to press your heart, and softly recite the incantation:

*"Supreme Purple Perfection, spirit of the Nine Qi,
Encompassing the myriad measures, the radiant turning jade,
Flying auroras stream with luminous brilliance,
Illuminating the Jade Clarity,
Dark canopy of all dawns,
Yin and Yang divide and unite,
The Four Harmonies descend in exchange,
The Seven Wefts align in sequence,
On this auspicious lunar day,
Come to shine within my heart’s court,
Flying light and boundless radiance,
Filling the Central Palace,
The Six Palaces open their gates,
Flowing essence levels all,
Hun and po refined and tempered,
Attaining the essence of the true,
Resonant transformation at touch,
Myriad transformations instantly complete,
Suddenly the great spirit appears,
Seated steadfast in my heart’s chamber,
Regulating breath and gathering fluids,
A hundred joints flow unobstructed,
Grasping the Dipper and seizing the *kui*,
Gazing afar in all directions,
Named *Xuan Du*,
Styled *Su Kang*,
Crimson-feathered mantle,
Dragon belt and tiger robe,
Body born of jeweled radiance,
Neck bearing a halo of light,
Headscarf of flying dawn,
Crown of heroes rising and falling,
Grant me flight as an immortal,
Soaring through the great void,
Ascending to the Purple Palace,
Paying court to the Jade Emperor in the north,
Commanding the myriad spirits,
All numinous beings in attendance,
Blossoms blooming above my heart,
Auspicious clouds eternal,
Phoenixes cry with tinkling clarity,
Luan-birds sing with resonant chime."*

When the incantation is finished, swallow saliva thirty times and click your teeth nine times. Recite the incantation again as before, then rise, face south, and bow twice. The practice is complete; open your eyes.

On the fifteenth, nineteenth, and twenty-third days of the lunar month, at the hour of *yu zhong* or midnight, enter your chamber, sit upright, clasp your hands, regulate your breath, and close your eyes. Then visualize the Nine Stars of the Northern Dipper descending into the Lower Palace, three inches below the navel, with the Dipper’s handle pointing upward toward the heart and the *kui* facing outward. After a long while, you will suddenly see within the *kui* a great spirit, clad and named as described in the invocation. You will also feel warmth in your navel as true qi arrives.

Then swallow saliva sixty times and click your teeth nine times. Raise your left hand’s third finger to press the *ren zhong* point below your nose, and softly recite the incantation:

*"Supreme Purple Emperor,
Radiant and resplendent at the central pivot,
Nine Wefts gleaming in luster,
Light surpassing the great aurora,
Myriad spirits look up in reverence,
A thousand dawns plant their roots,
Seven Degrees employed in brightness,
Nine Mists blooming in fragrance,
Governing Yang to manifest obedience,
Grasping Yin to achieve harmony,
True radiance opens the array,
Dark roots encompass all,
On this auspicious lunar day,
Come to shine within my navel,
Purple qi rising to the heavens,
Flying light descending in streams,
Refining my hun and po,
Flourishing essence and vital fluids,
Suddenly the great spirit appears,
Noble and divine in the Upper Palace,
Named *Zhu Meng*,
Styled *Liu Yu*,
Seated upright within the navel,
Riding the Nine Qi of the Dipper,
Exhaling and inhaling numinous fluids,
Balancing blood and regulating the stomach,
Yellow phoenix-feathered mantle,
Dragon robe and tiger belt,
Hands unlocking the sun’s root,
Head crowned with green hibiscus,
Waist ablaze with flowing fire,
Lightning’s brilliance illuminating the boundless,
Grant me flight as an immortal,
Treading the void and soaring aloft,
Ascending to the Jade Chamber,
Bearing the canopy of the celestial void,
Commanding the myriad spirits,
Heaven and Earth in shared repose."*

Upon concluding the invocation, swallow the saliva thirty times and click the teeth nine times. Repeat the invocation as before, and when finished, rise to face one’s life-star and bow twice. After bowing, open the eyes.

The practice of the Lower Prime’s Dao is now complete.

If the hands are raised with fingers interlaced, this occurs during the invocation; once the invocation ends, return the hands to their original position.

On the eight seasonal nodes at midnight, enter the chamber and sit upright. Interlace the hands, settle the qi, close the eyes, and inwardly visualize the entire body rising gently, ascending to fly into the Dipper’s *Kui* asterism. Persist in this visualization until sensing one’s form already within the Dipper. Focus intently, and when warmth is felt throughout the body, this is the true qi uniting with virtue.

Next, visualize the names, appearances, and colors of the Nine Essences and Three Spirits, their forms like newborn infants. The Three Spirits sit facing me, and I bow to them in my heart. Concentrate the vision until the body seems to dissolve into faintness, inducing a state of profound absorption.

Then swallow the saliva eighty times and click the teeth nine times. Raise the left hand to rest upon the heart and softly invoke:

*"Supreme Cinnabar Numinous,
Mysterious radiance blazing like a whirlwind,
Nine jades unlock the celestial pivot,
Luminous qi diffuses in clarity,
Purple dawn illumines the hidden,
Seven luminaries gleam resplendent,
Dual effulgences proclaim brightness,
Yin and Yang divide in harmony,
Four measures flourish in use,
Numinous fluids return in reflux,
Eight nodes awaken qi,
Ascending to the Nine Origins,
Grasping the Dipper’s handle,
I present myself to the Three Spirits.
They ask why I linger,
Why I have not yet ascended as an immortal.
I bow my head in awe before the Emperor,
Then grow majestic in might,
Mouth holding the sun’s root,
Left shattering the Six Heavens,
Right overseeing Mount Feng,
Flowing bells blaze above,
Ten thousand demons shatter and scatter.
Thus they know my po,
Strengthen my three hun,
Conceal the Dipper’s inner radiance within,
Nine Essences abide in the heart,
Purple auroras glow in mutual reflection,
Flying light spans ten thousand fathoms.
Harmonizing the hun and restraining the po,
Six wombs refine in balance,
Essence responds in transformation,
The Jade Consort suddenly appears,
Seated within my heart,
Gazing down and up in mutual regard.
Her name is *Mihua*,
Styled *Linqian*,
Exhaling and inhaling the dual qi,
Pacifying the hundred meridians.
Her body wears a mantle of refined light,
Phoenix radiance and simurgh skirts,
Tiger-scribed belt at the waist,
Dragon patterns in jade script,
Hands holding moon’s essence,
Head crowned with purple coronet.
Leaping into the Great Empyrean,
Riding the canopy of light,
Inscribed in the *Tai Su*,
I attain flight as an immortal,
Transcending the empty vastness,
Mounting the Jade Prime,
Ascending to the Crimson Chamber,
Commanding the myriad spirits,
Balancing the Two Measures,
Returning to infant visage.
The Northern Emperor’s lightning,
The Southern Emperor’s fire array,
The Azure Emperor’s kindled torch,
Dazzling thunder and lightning,
Western currents double-striking,
Resonant tones chanting in harmony,
Fourfold leaps propel me upward,
Recommending me to the Jade Perfected.
Thereupon I ride the Eight Effulgences,
Roaming and feasting amidst the Nine Mists."*

Upon concluding the invocation, swallow the saliva thirty times and click the teeth nine times. Repeat the invocation as before, then rise to face the northwest and bow twice. After bowing, open the eyes.

The practice of the Eight Nodes’ Perfection is now complete.

This Dao is the secret wonder of transcending emptiness, the marvelous method of the Nine Perfected. The practice is divided into three stages, with nine days of monthly cultivation—hence it is called the *Nine Perfected Ascending the Mysterious Writ*. It is a treasured text among the esoteric scriptures of the Supreme Perfected, the essential formula for attaining perfection.

When transmitting this to a worthy recipient, the receiver must first undergo a purification fast for one hundred days, or thirty days, or ten days, according to their capacity. Additionally, they should observe a one-day fast beforehand to cleanse their sincere heart. The transmitter must also fast in the same manner as the receiver. On the day of transmission, both parties shall first draw blood to consecrate the altar, cut their hair, and swear an oath of secrecy. Later sages, however, deemed blood sacrifice harmful to the vitality of living beings and hair-cutting a violation of bodily integrity. Thus, they substituted three taels of yellow gold for the blood oath and thirty-two feet of green silk for the hair-cutting pledge.

The master and disciple must not treat these oath objects as private possessions or misuse them; instead, they should be offered to reclusive Daoists dwelling in lofty mountains or to solitary, impoverished practitioners. If one has ascended to walk the void, the objects may be cast into mountain chambers or scattered upon sacred peaks. This is done to demonstrate that heavenly trust is profound and the Dao’s essence is prized above material wealth.

Those who violate these precepts will cause their seven generations of ancestors to suffer the trials of the Wind Blade in the Dark Capital, while their own souls shall become lowly ghosts. The transmission period, the method of bestowal, and all procedures must adhere strictly to the above regulations, with oath objects of the finest quality. The recipient’s heart must be pure and refined, their sincerity unwavering, and their devotion complete.

The transmitter is the master and guide, while the receiver is the disciple. Those who hear the Dao should look to the master as their model; those who seek life should dwell near the realm of life. Those who fail to uphold these teachings, who neglect or disrespect them, will cause their three generations of ancestors to be punished by the Fire Bureau, while they themselves shall be afflicted with lifelong ailments.

The Yellow Emperor once studied under the Master of Mount Jing, who knew only the method of refining stones—no other wonders—and was hardly superior to the Yellow Emperor. Yet because the Yellow Emperor inquired about the art of refining stones, he became his disciple. The Master of Mount Jing was a descendant of Lord You of Ji and now resides on Mount Weiyu. He can refine stones into water, boil water into jade, and grind jade into powder, which he consumes with stone water. Those who master this art may endure as long as heaven itself, yet they cannot soar through the empty void or grasp the morning mist in their hands. Though the art of refining stones is marvelous, it remains but a minor technique.

Here ends the *Supreme Perfected’s Scripture of Soaring on Wings: The Upper Record of the Nine Perfected Ascending the Mysterious*. The following section is the *Central Scripture of the Nine Perfected of the Supreme Perfected*. Though it contains an upper and lower sequence, its methods and applications differ and do not intersect.

The Central Yellow Lord of the Dao transmitted this to the Perfected of the Great Void, alongside the *Eight Esoteric Sayings*. The *Central Scripture of the Nine Perfected* is practiced among humans and includes oral instructions, though the main text is too sacred to be written. Now, the prescribed methods are as follows:

**First Perfected Method**: To be practiced on the 5th, 15th, 25th, 27th, and 29th days of the fifth month—five times in a month, all at dawn.

**Second Perfected Method**: To be practiced on the 8th, 11th, 14th, 19th, 23rd, and 27th days of the eighth month—six times in a month, all at the hour of *chen* (7–9 AM).

**Third Perfected Method**: To be practiced on the 6th, 7th, 17th, 18th, 25th, and 26th days of the sixth month—six times in a month, all at the hour of *si* (9–11 AM).

**Fourth Perfected Method**: To be practiced on the 2nd, 8th, 14th, 18th, 19th, and 28th days of the first month—six times in a month, all at noon.

**Fifth Perfected Method**: To be practiced on the 3rd, 8th, 13th, 20th, and 26th days of the third month—five times in a month, all at the hour of *wei* (1–3 PM).

**Sixth Perfected Method**: To be practiced on the 7th, 11th, 14th, 18th, 23rd, 25th, and 28th days of the seventh month—seven times in a month, all at the hour of *shen* (3–5 PM).

**Seventh Perfected Method**: To be practiced on the 2nd, 6th, 9th, 13th, 16th, 19th, 23rd, and 27th days of the eleventh month—eight times in a month, all at the hour of *you* (5–7 PM).

**Eighth Perfected Method**: To be practiced on the 2nd, 7th, 9th, 15th, 18th, 19th, and 27th days of the second month—seven times in a month, all at the hour of *xu* or *hai* (7–11 PM).

**Ninth Perfected Method**: To be practiced on the 3rd, 9th, 17th, 19th, 26th, and 29th days of the twelfth month—six times in a month, all at midnight.

Here end the oral instructions of the *Central Scripture of the Nine Perfected*. These days and hours are when the qi of life converges and the essence of the Perfected aligns, making it most auspicious for visualization and readily invoking the mysterious response. If one dwells in seclusion atop lofty peaks, hidden among cloud-wreathed cliffs, severs all worldly ties, purifies the intestines by abstaining from grains, joins hands to rectify the heart, and meditates upon the morning’s essence, they should practice daily as prescribed in the original scripture.

However, as most people in the world are occupied with affairs and cannot cultivate in daily tranquility, the above schedule is provided. Practicing for fourteen years is sufficient to transcend the empty void, master life and death, pass through water and fire, ascend to the Supreme Clarity, cause the five viscera to blossom, and commune with heaven.

The *Upper Scroll of the Scripture of Ascending the Mysterious on Wings* requires three repetitions in a month, totaling nine days—this is due to the world’s lack of perfect stillness. If one maintains long fasts, embraces solitude, gazes upon the empty vastness, and focuses the heart beyond worldly matters, they should practice on these days in sequence.

A monthly practice of nine repetitions is merely for those still dwelling among worldly concerns. At the eight solar nodes, one should meditate upon the Dipper’s midst, and suddenly perceive the Jade Consort seated before them. The Jade Consort exhales purple mist into one’s mouth, and after a long while, her robes appear as invoked at the eight nodes. This woman is the yin spirit of the Nine Essences, the Supreme Clarity’s foremost consort.

This is the oral transmission of the Azure Lad.

Here ends the *Scripture of the Five Constants of the Supreme Clarity: Transformations and Myriad Changes in the Murky Depths*. #1 The character *nai* 乃 was originally written as *ji* 及.
