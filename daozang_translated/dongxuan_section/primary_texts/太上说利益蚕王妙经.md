*The Marvelous Scripture on Benefiting the Silkworm King* Spoken by the Most High

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy of Numinous Treasure was upon Horse Hoof Mountain in the Land of Pure Brightness, accompanied by hosts of immortals and perfected beings—hundreds of thousands in number—who followed him to the Palace of Crimson Clarity, where a great assembly was convened to expound the Dao.

Then, from among the multitude, a perfected one named Pure Sun and Moon arose from his seat, straightened his tablet, stepped forward, and addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: "Now I see that in the world below, the people suffer from unequal fortune, lacking even clothing. By what means may they be delivered?"

Moved by his plea, the Heavenly Worthy dispatched the Perfected One of Mysterious Name to transform into a silkworm moth. From its mouth it spun silk, which it bestowed upon humanity, teaching them the warp and weft of weaving, the cutting and sewing of garments. He further affixed divine talismans to ward off demonic influences.

The perfected one again addressed the Heavenly Worthy: "What karmic recompense awaits those who raise silkworms?"

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "After this body undergoes its transformations and many years have passed, it shall return to its original form, soaring freely through the empty sky."

Thereupon, the Perfected One of Mysterious Name declared to the people of the world: "The silkworm moth is my transformed body. Moved by compassion for the suffering of sentient beings—oppressed by hunger and cold—I have come to deliver you. You must cultivate sincere reverence and not treat me with disdain or cast me aside. If you act with contempt, you shall again fall into hardship. But if you honor me with devotion, you shall attain great wealth and nobility. Raise many, and you shall reap abundantly; raise few, and you shall still gather much. With wholehearted faith and reverence, all shall rejoice."

When this scripture was spoken, the perfected immortals and the assembled multitude bowed their heads to the Heavenly Worthy, took their leave, and departed.
