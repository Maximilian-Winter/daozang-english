In ancient times, the crown prince of the King of Anren, named Taixu, styled Haikong, was steadfast in his resolve and vows, leaving the secular world to cultivate the Dao. His father, the king, pitying his unwavering sincerity and uprightness—unable to dissuade him—summoned the supreme perfected one, the Peerless Realized Person, from within the celestial palace.

The prince prostrated himself, crawling forward on his knees, kowtowing and knocking his head to the ground, entreating grace: "Taixu is fortunate beyond measure across a thousand ages to encounter a true master. I bow in shame before Heaven and Earth and all the divine spirits, overwhelmed with joy and trepidation, not knowing how to express my gratitude."

"I, your disciple, have heard of the great Dharma of the Numinous Treasure, the True Scriptures of the Three Primes, the Purple Writings of Supreme Clarity, the golden tablets and jade registers—each character a zhang in size, their radiant patterns resplendent. With utmost sincerity, I humbly seek to receive their profound mysteries. I pray you expound them to console my worldly heart."

The Peerless Realized Person joyfully replied: "Excellent, excellent! Your earnest seeking of the Dao, your prostrations in reverence—such devotion has truly been unseen across kalpas. I have heard that my true scriptures descend to the world to deliver all celestial and human beings. Their precepts are solemn, their numinous texts treasured and secret, the mysteries of the supreme Dao beyond the comprehension of even the immortals of the middle heavens. Though you are a noble heir to the throne, purifying your heart to yearn for the Dharma, the foul impurities of the worldly defilement prevent me from lightly transmitting them."

Thereupon, the prince prostrated himself fully, crawling forward against the wind, and entreated the Realized Person: "In this fleeting, illusory world, nothing is truly real. Birth, aging, sickness, and death follow one another without cease across kalpas. Though one’s station may be exalted, who can preserve it forever? Like sparks from struck stone, flowing water, floating bubbles, or lightning—there is no fitting metaphor. Though the supreme Dharma is lofty and secret, and I am unworthy to glimpse even its titles, I humbly pray for your vast compassion to bestow its revelation."

Taixu then petitioned to renounce his princely status and dwell in secluded forests. His father, the king, moved by his sincerity, granted his earnest wish.

The Realized Person, recognizing Taixu’s sincerity as worthy of record and his attainment of the true Dao as imminent, opened the purple-sunned jade coffer and cloud-brocaded satchel. Following the proper ritual statutes, he swore an oath to Heaven and transmitted the true texts of the Numinous Treasure—the precepts of the Three Primes.

Taixu then kowtowed, striking his cheeks in reverence, and bowed in gratitude for this boundless grace. After receiving the true scriptures, he firmly declined his father’s entreaties and entered the Renwu Mountains, where he purified himself in fasting and contemplation. For twelve years, the Five Elder Thearchs bestowed upon Taixu the sacred writ, and he attained the rank of Realized Person.

On the day of the Middle Prime, within the palace’s central hall—adorned with purity and solemnity, divine banners and jeweled canopies, rare fruits and fragrant flowers, all the kingdom’s treasures and precious offerings, finest incense and rare jewels, a hundred delicacies and pure, refined foods—he established a mountain altar. Offerings were arranged in all directions, and the reverberating fragrance of incense ascended directly to the Nine Heavens, reaching the celestial palace.

At that time, the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning observed that Taixu was ripe for transformation and deliverance. Accompanied by flying immortals, the thearchs of all heavens, jade lads and jade maidens, vajra spirit-kings, and celestial warriors, he descended from the northwest of the sky, filling the void as he alighted upon the seat. In that moment, the celestial palace was filled with assembled sages, yet none felt constrained.

In an instant, the Celestial Worthy emitted from his mouth a five-colored, wondrous radiance, illuminating all the heavens of the three thousand great thousand worlds, perceiving them as clearly as if beholding his own palm, without obstruction or hindrance—an inconceivable sight.

The Celestial Worthy addressed the four assemblies: "I have heard that the people of this kingdom—men and women alike—across kalpas have been unable to purify themselves, indulging in arrogance and excess, entangled in afflictions. Their lifespans are brief, and they have no means of liberation. I now open the gate of expedient means for all sentient beings, to uproot their sufferings, universally bestow peace and joy, guide them to the virtuous Dao, and together hasten toward the mysterious ford."

At that time, the four assemblies raised their offerings and reverently listened to the Dharma sound.

The Celestial Worthy declared: "The karmic deeds of sentient beings are not of a single source. Good and evil, suffering and emptiness pervade all dharma realms. The retributions for miscellaneous evils are boundless. For the sake of all sentient beings, I shall briefly outline the essentials, expounding the twenty-four preceptual gates to guide those lost on the path, ultimately reaching the bodhimanda, attaining fruits according to their capacities, wielding the sword that severs afflictions, and kindling the Dharma lamp that illuminates the four delusions. Within, they shall still the dust of worldly toil; without, they shall sever the bonds of entanglement. All faculties shall be purified, ascending the gate of right contemplation, enabling all sentient beings to reach the land of liberation."

Thereupon, the Peerless Realized Person and all the immortals received the precepts and instructions, bowing in reverence and vowing to practice them.

At that time, among the assembly was a Realized Person named Xianwei, who, witnessing this wondrous gathering—beyond all comparison—was filled with boundless joy. He ascended and inquired of the Heavenly Thearch: "I have heard of great assemblies where the Dharma is expounded, their majestic radiance resplendent. Never did I imagine that today I would personally encounter such an occasion, where all the heavens and all the sages speak with a single Dharma sound. This land and other realms are as clear as if seen in the palm of one’s hand. The Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning, his majestic radiance blazing, astonishes gods and spirits. To his left stand the immortal ministers; to his right, the perfected lords. Vermilion phoenixes and dark turtles, azure dragons and white tigers, celestial youths and celestial maidens—an innumerable host fills the void, overwhelmingly opening the treasure storehouse."

"At this time, the assembly advanced to higher ranks of immortality, and even the newest learners ascended the immortal stages. I have heard that the sentient beings of the lower realms are stained by the three evils, lacking compassion and filial piety, devoid of love and benevolence, bound by the Three Officials without means of liberation. To what should they turn, and how may they obtain absolution? What practices should they cultivate to receive pardon?"

The Celestial Worthy replied: "You should listen carefully. I shall now reveal to you what you have never heard, dispelling afflictions and severing delusive obstacles. I shall open the jade tablets of the true texts of the Celestial Worthy’s divine names from the realm of Mysterious Capital, awakening sentient beings. With utmost sincerity, they should return to the command of the supreme, purify themselves in fasting, burn incense, light lamps, and with devout faith, revere the divine names of the Primordial Celestial Worthy, the treasured and secret numinous texts, and all the immortals. By bowing in worship and vowing to recite them, they shall erase the records of the Nine Dark Realms from the jade caskets of the long night, attain rebirth among humans and gods, escape suffering and attain liberation, dissolve the sins of as many as the sands of the Ganges, and acquire the good affinities of dust-mote numbers."

If the common people, men and women, wholeheartedly and universally revere these compassionate responsive names of the Celestial Worthies, they shall immediately obtain the jade caskets of the numinous offices of the boundless world, and the records of Fengdu’s various evil hells shall be reviewed.

May all such sins be wholly extinguished, the three paths of suffering dissolved, the five destinies purified and at peace. May they forever depart the dark night and be reborn in heaven, roaming freely in non-action, with clothing and sustenance naturally provided.

Having revered the Three Treasures, we next wholeheartedly confess and repent:
We disciples, from kalpas without measure until this day, have committed transgressions through the deeds of body, mouth, and mind, our evils as numerous as the grains of sand, beyond reckoning. Some, in the prime of youth, indulged in dissipation, pursuing a hundred distractions, engaging in theft and harm, following every whim, delighting in cruelty, heedless of peril, failing in loyalty to superiors and filial piety to parents, practicing ruthless oppression, harboring malicious schemes, encroaching upon the innocent, fostering envy and strife, causing the people to live in fear, and incurring the hatred of all. For such transgressions, we now sincerely repent.

Some, in the three spring months, set fires to burn and kill insects and serpents, hunted and trapped, harming countless lives—those born from wombs, eggs, moisture, or transformation, whether in water or on land, flying or submerged, hiding in every refuge—all subjected to slaughter, our hearts rejoicing in the spectacle, without remorse. For such transgressions, we now sincerely repent.

Some, with frivolous words and ornate speech, slandered the virtuous, sowed discord among kin and friends, and incited neighbors to strife, causing inner and outer circles to harbor resentment, near and far to grow distant, breeding enmity and fostering schemes of harm. For such transgressions, we now sincerely repent.

Some, insatiably hoarding worldly wealth, devising means to exploit, cheating others to their faces, enriching themselves at others’ expense, harming others to benefit themselves, refusing to aid the poor and suffering, and wallowing in stinginess. For such transgressions, we now sincerely repent.

Some, upon receiving the teachings and precepts, practiced them neither diligently nor earnestly, coveting profit to sustain themselves, devoid of thoughts of kindness. They devised expedient means to deceive and delude both humans and gods, appropriating offerings meant for merit and virtue, using them for private gain, without shame or remorse, heedless of future consequences. For such transgressions, we now raise our utmost sincerity, seek mercy, and repent. We take refuge and pay homage to the Three Treasures.

With utmost sincerity, we make our vows:
May we, from this day of repentance onward, dedicate all merits cultivated to the aspiration that, life after life, we forever depart from stinginess and greed, abandon thoughts of deceit and plunder, constantly practice generosity and kindness, and arouse the heart of compassion. May we widely construct bridges and ferries, deliver all beings, ensure the people’s sufficiency, and harmonize the realms above and below. May the fruits of our blessings and virtues adorn our lives in every age, granting us longevity and fulfillment.

May we, together with all beings of the four modes of birth and six realms of existence, encounter auspicious conditions, together realize the wondrous gate, and attain the supreme Dao.

Our vows now made, we take refuge and pay homage to the Three Treasures.

These three caverns of precious scriptures, formed in primordial chaos and accumulated in profound radiance, divide into two aspects—yin and yang—operating in hidden transformation. Heaven and Earth unfold in their covering and bearing, the Three and Five initiate their threads, and the Eight Assemblies compose their texts. Some are inscribed in golden books of phoenix seal-script, some are wrought in jade characters of dragon calligraphy, their cavernous governance gleaming and fresh, their purple groves embroidered and resplendent. Some appear in Floating Black as eight-cornered rays descending, some manifest in the Great Void as five luminous chapters shining brilliantly, their radiance illuminating the Three Realms, their brilliance illuminating the Nine Netherworlds. Divided by their degrees, they expound the teachings to the various heavens, each heaven possessing one division, together forming thirty-six divisions, placed and settled upon the jade terrace and mysterious seat within the Seven Treasures Repository. Nine-colored brocade clouds hang suspended above the scriptures, golden lads stand to the left bearing incense, jade maidens stand to the right scattering flowers in offering. Sometimes they emerge once every forty thousand kalpas, sometimes they are transmitted once every three thousand years. Thus do the Heavenly Perfected uphold them to ascend in purity, Earth Immortals receive them to attain tranquil serenity, the sun and moon polish them to heighten their brilliance, the Five Peaks hold them aloft to stabilize their numinosity. The Son of Heaven venerates them to achieve sagely transformation, dukes and kings revere them to attain Great Peace, scholars and commoners honor them to receive blessings and protection, and students cultivate them to attain longevity. If one can intone and chant them with reverence, blessings will pervade without limit. Therefore, with utmost sincerity, we take refuge and bow in reverence.

Next, we reverently bow to all the perfected immortals and sages who have attained the Dao in the ten directions:
We reverently bow to the Perfected Immortal Ma Ming-Sheng.

We reverently bow to the Perfected Immortal Rong Chenggong.
We reverently bow to the Perfected Immortal Ling Shouguang.
We reverently bow to the Perfected Immortal Bu Kenlaizi.

Having paid homage to the Three Treasures, we next wholeheartedly confess our transgressions:
From limitless kalpas past until this very day, we disciples have been deluded in body and mind, unaware of causes and conditions, our evil karma multiplying endlessly, devoid of knowledge and awareness. Lost in confusion, deaf and blind in our inverted views, our faults are too numerous to recount. Today, before the Three Treasures in this Dao altar, we beseechingly repent. We humbly pray that the Heavenly Worthies of the ten directions in this merciful Dao altar, the Dharma Masters within the thirty-six divisions of venerated scriptures, all perfected immortals, the sacred hosts of empty space, those with heavenly ears, those with heavenly eyes—may they deign to know and hear, to bear witness as we repent of all our karmic roots of sin, praying that they may all be extinguished.

We repenting disciples, from countless lives past until this very day, have at times turned against the spirits and forsaken the Dao, unafraid of the radiant numina, committing coarse deeds and uttering wicked words, slandering the true teachings. Beholding sacred images and hearing scriptures, we lacked reverent hearts, mocked others’ cultivation of merit, and ridiculed those who practiced good causes. Never have we reformed or repented, devoid of all sense of shame. Today, with utmost sincerity, we repent of all these transgressions.

Next, we repent of our ignorance of cause and effect, and of our parents’ kindness. We have committed wrongful acts, relying on our lineage, defiant and coarse in conduct. Toward those of high and low station, while our parents lived in their halls, we indulged in sweet delicacies yet never visited them in life; when they died in the wilderness, we failed to offer sacrifices or memorials for endless kalpas. Thus, the spirits of the departed suffer the calamity of interrogation, while in the human world, no good fortune or blessings respond. For sins such as these, boundless and immeasurable, we now repent with utmost sincerity.

Next, we repent of the sin of robbery and theft. The scriptures declare: if an object belongs to another, guarded and protected by them, not even a thread or a hair should be taken without permission—how much less should one steal? Yet sentient beings, failing to awaken, conceive the intent to plunder, acting with reckless abandon, thereby ensuring that in the future they will suffer myriad torments and interrogations. For any such transgressions, we now confess and beg forgiveness.

Furthermore, the scriptures state that ordinary beings, in committing sins, descend upon death into the dark realms of Avīci Hell. This Avīci Hell spans eighty thousand *yojanas* in length and breadth, enclosed by seven layers of iron walls. Above the ground stretch seven layers of iron nets, while below lie eighteen compartments, each encircled by seven layers, all filled with forests of blades. Within the sevenfold walls stand forests of swords, beneath which lie another eighteen compartments. Each compartment contains eighty-four thousand layers. At the four corners stand four great copper dogs, their bodies towering four thousand *yojanas* high. Their eyes flash like lightning, their fangs resemble sword trees, their teeth are like mountains of blades, their tongues like iron hooks, their claws like iron forks, and their tails like iron pythons. From each tail emanates a fierce and vast radiance, its smoke and stench so vile that nothing compares. At the four gates of this hell, eighteen wardens stand guard, each resembling a *rakṣasa*, their heads crowned with eighteen horns, wielding iron forks with which they impale sinners through the heart, piercing them from back to front. At each compartment’s gate lie eighty-four thousand iron pythons and great serpents, spewing poisonous fire that fills the entire city, their roars resounding like thunderstorms and gales. Great iron pellets also fill the city, making its torments unbearable. Beyond the four gates, in each direction, raging fires blaze—east, south, west, and north—intersecting and penetrating one another, encircled by iron walls and covered by iron nets. Fire from above reaches below, fire from below reaches above, and from all four directions and above and below, suffering arises simultaneously in full force.

For those who, as described above, violate the precepts and commit the five heinous crimes, or who slander merit and virtue, if they repent according to the scriptures yet feel no remorse, upon the end of their lives, they will surely endure these torments. Those who belittle the Three Treasures, steal the pure wealth of the monastic community, or defile others’ monastic conduct will not escape this hell. When sinners suffer, fierce fire enters their hearts, causing them to faint and die. In a single day and night, they die and are reborn ten thousand times, enduring all manner of agony. Having emerged from Avīci Hell, due to the causes of broken precepts and falsely claiming the offerings of the faithful, they fall into the eighteen lesser hells: the Hell of Freezing Ice, the Hell of Black Darkness, the Hell of Scorching Flames, the Hell of Blade Wheels, the Hell of Sword Wheels, the Hell of Fire Chariots, the Hell of Boiling Cauldrons, the Hell of Sword Forests, the Hell of Iron Beds, the Hell of Copper Pillars, the Hell of Iron Machines, the Hell of Iron Wheels, the Hell of Iron Pellets, the Hell of Jagged Rocks, the Hell of Molten Copper Drink—each lasting eight million years. Only then may they emerge, yet they are reborn in lowly states. For five hundred kalpas, they fail to recognize the Three Treasures or encounter good spiritual friends, and thus cannot arouse the unsurpassed mind of the Dao. Without such encounters, they have no hope of liberation.

Therefore, we disciples, having fortunately encountered good conditions in the past and now hearing the scriptural teachings, rejoice in body and mind, devoting ourselves wholeheartedly with utmost sincerity. We repent and wash away past transgressions, vowing to cultivate new virtues. May our nine generations of ancestors down to our present kin never hear or see such evil conditions, and may they forever escape these sufferings.

Having repented, we prostrate ourselves and pay homage to the Three Treasures.

With utmost sincerity, we make our vows:
May we disciples, by virtue of the merit cultivated through this repentance, in life after life avoid the three evil destinies and constantly practice the ten good deeds. May the adornments of cause and effect be complete, and may all blessings and virtues be perfected. May a thousand calamities be cast aside, and ten thousand joys naturally arrive. May wondrous wisdom nourish body and mind, and may sacred merit increase our lifespan. May our departed ancestors of nine generations bathe in the grace of the Dao, their spirits cleansed by the divine stream, wandering the shores of the Dao, carefree in the true realm, unbound and at ease. May all sentient beings with karmic affinity be liberated from suffering.

Having made our vows, we prostrate ourselves and pay homage.

Thus, we take refuge and repent before all the Three Treasures throughout the boundless emptiness and the pervading Dharma-realm. From beginningless kalpas until this very day—whether in past lives or the present—we, your disciples, have failed to recognize karmic conditions, acted contrary to circumstances, and conducted ourselves in delusion. We have mingled with the dust of the world, lacking equanimity of mind. Among ordinary folk, we have engaged in perverse and deviant behavior, distanced ourselves from our clans, and favored others. We have falsely assumed names and titles, feigning heroism; indulged in lust and desire; been miserly and greedy beyond our station; intimidated and plundered the ignorant; encroached upon virtuous governance; belittled the elderly and infirm; and oppressed the orphaned and widowed.

At home, we have day and night humiliated and driven our servants and maidservants, unjustly flogging them. We have ridden horses and driven oxen without regard for their hunger and exhaustion. Our minds harbored malicious thoughts, our mouths uttered reckless words. We have offended deities, cursed the wind and rain, and wantonly cast spells, heaping transgressions upon others. In this life and the next, we have borne the weight of these calamities. Such sins are measureless and boundless; today, with utmost sincerity, we repent of them all.

We, your disciples, have been afflicted by obstructions and vexations, our every action marred by transgressions. We have become drunk and violent, disrupting the order of high and low. We have spoken deceptive and absurd words, indulging in falsehood without restraint. We have sought out the faults of others, flattered and schemed, betrayed the twofold grace, and constantly engaged in deceit. We have carelessly placed scriptures and images, neglecting incense and offerings. With unclean hands, we have unfolded sacred texts; with defiled bodies, we have approached the Dharma seat. We have taken precepts but failed to practice almsgiving; received offerings yet felt no shame. We have borrowed and defaulted on debts, lent money at usurious interest. Such sins are measureless and boundless; today, with utmost sincerity, we repent of them all.

We, your disciples, bound by the conditions of life and death, are but ordinary beings, our minds obscured by ignorance. We have failed to recognize compassion and forbearance, our natures inclined toward harm. We have made offerings to perverse spirits and ghosts, flattered and entertained guests. At weddings and betrothals, during festivals and seasonal rites, we have lavishly prepared kitchens, wantonly slaughtering and cooking flesh and blood to sate our appetites. The fat and marrow have fueled lamps through the night, inviting endless karmic retribution, impossible to reckon. Creditors and adversaries in the unseen realm have ceaselessly pursued us, dragging us through the cycles of birth and death. Thus, our souls are imprisoned for nine nights, our spirits bound to the Three Wretched Realms, with no means of expiation, no path to plead for mercy.

We now earnestly establish vegetarian feasts, commission images, and lay bare our sincere hearts. May the merit and good conditions thus accrued be dedicated to our past adversaries and karmic debts. By the power of this blessing, may we be sheltered in the realms of humans and gods, forever forsaking evil conditions, no longer bound by enmity. May we, across the Four Modes of Birth and Six Realms of Existence, widely bestow compassion. When we witness others in peril, distress, or tormented by suffering, may we skillfully deliver them, enabling their liberation. Thereafter, may we expound the subtle and wondrous true Dharma, revealing the conditions of awakening, so that upon seeing our form or shadow, hearing our name or voice, all fear is dispelled, and all afflictions dissolved. Attaining this, we shall ultimately abide in peace and bliss.

Having repented, we take refuge and bow before the Three Treasures.

With utmost sincerity, we make this vow:
May we, your disciples, and our departed kin, by virtue of this repentance and the merit thus established, life after life, forever depart from the Three Wretched Realms, forever bid farewell to the Eight Sufferings. May we not be seized by adversaries, nor confronted by evil omens. May we wander freely in the realm of liberation, roam the boundless realm of non-action, delight in the offerings of humans and gods, and ever hear the refined sounds of celestial music. In this world, may we dwell in peace and harmony, untouched by afflictions. May our gates be graced with auspicious signs, our homes abundant and prosperous. May fortune and blessings renew themselves, while calamities and misfortunes vanish.

Having made this vow, we take refuge and bow before the Three Treasures.

Here ends *The Supreme Numinous Treasure Scripture of the Image for Eliminating Sins and Invoking Vast Blessings*.
