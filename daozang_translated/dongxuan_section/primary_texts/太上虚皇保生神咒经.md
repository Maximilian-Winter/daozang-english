**The Supreme Void Sovereign’s Scripture of Divine Incantations for Protecting Life**

The Supreme Void Sovereign,
Opens and disperses the Jade Court,
Golden chambers radiant,
Emerald terraces lush and verdant.

I establish the Three Ways,
To vanquish demons and quicken life.
I transcend death,
And likewise transcend birth.

Attaining longevity and freedom,
Reversing age to return to infancy,
The hun and po are refined,
The Five Spirits find peace.

The whirlwind chariot’s wheels turn,
Northward to pay homage to the Jade Clarity,
Ascending into the Great Void,
Merging brilliance with the sun.

Thus one becomes a Perfected,
Uniting with the Five Thearchs,
Proclaimed by the Three Primes,
All spirits heed the decree.

The Cavern Mystery Samadhi,
Boundless true numina,
Legions of immortals attend and guard,
Their names inscribed in the Jade Clarity.

The Cavern Truth and Jade Void,
The Void within the Void,
The Dao within the Dao,
Spirit transforms in an instant.

The Cavern Spirit’s numinous response,
Manifests in dharmic signs and deeds,
Driving away evil and eradicating wickedness,
Revolving the celestial sphere.

**East:** Protecting life,
The Azure Youth’s divine spirit,
The Orthodox Unity guards the hun,
Ensuring longevity and prosperity.

**South:** Protecting life,
Consolidating qi with the Vermilion Spirit,
Myriad spirits untransgressed,
Granting me enduring tranquility.

**West:** Protecting life,
The White Spirit attends the po,
Dispelling malevolent qi,
Bringing me good fortune and success.

**North:** Protecting life,
Facilitating the primordial essence,
The Five Qi’s true talisman,
Ensures my eternal flourishing.

**Center:** Protecting life,
Governing my bodily form,
Soaring freely,
Heaven and Earth unite as one.

Roaming and observing the Great Void,
Ascending to pay homage to the Jade Capital,
Below, expelling demonic influences,
Bestowing blessings upon all beings.

**Here ends *The Supreme Void Sovereign’s Scripture of Divine Incantations for Protecting Life*.**
