The *Supreme Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure Scripture of Unfolding the Secret Treasury*

This scripture, titled *The Supreme Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure Scripture of Unfolding the Secret Treasury*, originated in the Tang dynasty. Originally part of *Volume Nine of the Scripture of the Fundamental Principle*, it was later separated into an independent text. It comprises one fascicle. The base text is derived from the *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, Cavernous Mystery Division, *Benwen* Category.

---

On the fifth day of the tenth month in the first year of the Shanghuang era, the Supreme Great Dao Lord, together with countless celestial perfected beings and divine persons of wondrous conduct, arrived at the abode of the Lord Emperor of the Grand Tenuity—above the radiant clouds, within the jade towers, in the chambers of golden splendor. Before the purified altar of the Dao, they circumambulated in step with the void, chanting sacred hymns in accordance with the three vehicles’ forms of reverence. They struck the ritual drums, summoning the assembly of all perfected beings. At this moment, none among the host of sages failed to gather, expounding upon the profound and wondrous, elucidating the Dao and its virtue. The sacred assembly took their places, the four quarters arrayed in solemn order.

The Lord Emperor of the Grand Tenuity rose from his seat and bowed deeply to the Dao Lord, saying: "Today is a day of great celebration, the dawn of teaching and admonition. Though the sagely honored one has condescended to descend to this humble hall, your boundless compassion has deigned to cast a glance upon us, overwhelming us with profound grace. This humble servant and petty disciple has rarely encountered such a felicitous gathering, and the joy of the assembled perfected beings is unparalleled. I humbly beseech your mercy to enlighten what we have yet to awaken to. I dare not presume to know: of the wondrous bodies attained by the Celestial Worthies of the three times and ten directions, by what means are they formed? Are they of one and the same essence, or do they differ from one another? I implore your compassion to fully expound upon this, that all sentient beings and those who study the Dao in future ages may have something to rely upon. With this entreaty, I prostrate myself in reverence, trembling with awe."

Then the Supreme Dao Lord commanded the Golden Mother of the Western Terrace, and the thirty-two heavens joined their voices in harmony, singing numinous melodies. Celestial musicians played their instruments, manifesting auspicious signs that shook heaven and earth with their wondrous and extraordinary splendor. After a long while, the Dao Lord spoke: "Profound indeed, subtle indeed—you now seek to inquire into the secret treasury of the true Dao. Since I attained the Dao, I have never before expounded upon these hidden and arcane matters. Yet since you have made this request, I shall transgress the prohibitions and transmit them. Listen carefully and receive these essential words; do not recklessly divulge them."

At that time, the assembly prostrated themselves to receive the crucial teachings.

The Supreme Lord declared: "The ultimate truth of the wondrous principle is quiescent, formless, pure, and serene, beyond all description or designation. For the sake of guiding and transforming beings, I shall briefly outline two paths: first, the quiescent essence of the Dao-body, which is emptiness and non-being; second, the birth-body, which is conceived and born in physical form.

The Dao-body transcends all characteristics. Perfect wisdom is fulfilled, delusive falsehoods are eradicated, and one merges obscurely with the profound origin, becoming one with the Dao. It is neither extinguished nor born, neither comes nor goes. The path of speech is severed, and the workings of thought are forever stilled.

The birth-body, on the other hand, accords with worldly dharmas. It arises dependent upon father and mother, the harmonization of qi and destiny. The jade womb and numinous palace are like empty space, manifesting as circumstances permit, with varying durations of gestation. Some are born from the armpit or back, reared in secluded palaces; some are born with white hair, while others eternally retain a youthful countenance. Their adorned forms and wondrous natures are revered by both gods and humans."

The Lord Emperor bowed and asked: "Is the Dao-body itself the quiescent origin, or is there another principle that may be called the origin?"

The Supreme Lord replied: "The Dao is the sacred origin; the origin is the root of the Dao. Though they are of one essence, there are not two separate sources. The Dao is named as independent, its essence inherently numinous and unobstructed. It is self-sufficient, transcending all dependence, vanishing into the distance, and ceasing all activity. The origin is spoken of in contrast to the end, a provisional name given in dependence upon conditions. It is called the beginning of things, involved in the capacity to give rise to them. It also serves as the fixed origin, with activity and quiescence differing in function. Emergence and submergence mutually manifest, while speech and silence complement one another."

The Lord Emperor further inquired: "If this origin-body is capable of giving rise to the myriad things, and is thus the primordial beginning of all things, how does it differ from the spiritual origin?"

The Supreme Lord answered: "In their true essence, there is no duality. Why is this so? Because both are ultimately so, without beginning or end, and thus inexpressible. Yet through skillful means, one may also speak of their distinction.

The so-called spiritual origin is the inception of deluded thought, the initial mind-moment that serves as the root of all birth and death. From this initial mind, thought follows thought in succession, and the karmic fruits of sentient beings revolve endlessly. This is called the inception of consciousness, also known as the spiritual origin.

The origin-body, however, is the sentiment of the Dao, the pure mind that serves as the root of all worldly and transcendent dharmas. Thus, it is called the origin. This true nature is neither mind nor non-mind, neither form nor non-form. It is not bound by conditions, nor is it impermanent—hence it is said to be non-mind. Yet it gives rise to mind and knows all things—thus it is also called mind. It is unimpeded—hence it is called non-form. Yet it gives rise to form, and the Dao-eye perceives it—thus it is also called form.

This pure mind is replete with all boundless virtues and perfections of wisdom. It abides eternally in self-mastery, serene and blissful. Yet because it is obscured by afflictions, it has not been fully revealed—hence it is called nature. If one cultivates skillful means to sever all afflictions, and the obstructive dharmas are exhausted, it becomes manifest and luminous—hence it is called the origin-body. Such a body is inherently present in the origin-body, not newly created—thus it is called the origin. The origin is not of any nature, nor is it encompassed by the three times. Yet for the sake of expediency, it is spoken of as not not belonging to the three times. Because it has always existed, it is called the past. Because all sentient beings will inevitably attain it, it is called the future. Because the great sages of the ten directions have already attained it, it is called the present. Though it is spoken of as having distinctions within the three times, its essence is unmoving and eternally unchanging."

The Lord Emperor again asked: "If the origin-body is inherently replete with all qualities, how can afflictions obscure it? If it is inherently complete yet becomes obscured, then all divine worthies who have attained the Dao should also eventually lose it. Why is this so? Because their essence is one and the same."

The Most High replied: "Though the essence is one, its meanings are two. Because expedient means are insufficient, and because expedient means are complete—this is why I say all dharmas take emptiness as their nature. To transform sentient beings, I employ skillful expedient means, expounding as circumstances require. The nature of such verbal expression is like empty space, without discrimination. The original essence-body and the original nature are both characterized by emptiness, attaining what is unattainable—thus there is nothing to lose. Because there is something attained, there is something to lose. Therefore, ordinary beings are called those who lose, while the divine worthies of the ten directions are called those of constant virtue."

The Lord Emperor again asked: "If the dharmas of birth and death are beginningless and endless, and their original nature is pure, why are they not called the fruit of the Dao?"

The Most High replied: "The dharmas of birth and death have causes and effects, and thus are impermanent—they are not called the fruit of the Dao. The essence of the constant Dao is not of causes and effects, and thus is eternal. Because its essence is the fruit, it is called the fruit of the Dao."

The Lord Emperor again asked: "Is this original essence-body entirely shared by all, or is it one body possessed individually, with countless bodies? If it is one, then when one person attains it, it should obstruct others. If it is many manifestations, it is not the Great Oneness and cannot be called eternal."

The Most High said: "Have I not said that all dharmas are like empty space? The nature of empty space is neither one nor many, neither obstructive nor unobstructive. The original essence-body is likewise so—its essence is neither one nor many, and its nature is unobstructed."

The Supreme Lord of the Grand Tenuity bowed and said: "I humbly receive your teaching. Yet I remain unclear: how do the two terms 'birth' and 'manifestation' differ in the scriptural teachings? I venture to inquire and hope for your compassionate elucidation."

The Most High replied: "In truth, there is no duality—yet according to meaning, they are named differently. The 'birth-body' reveals form, each instance resembling others, yet without fixed appearance or constant order. Whatever manifests the original is called the 'manifestation-body.'"

The Lord Emperor again asked: "Are the birth-body and manifestation-body responsive?"

The Most High replied: "Just so. 'Birth' and 'manifestation' are both termed 'conditions,' and as their benefits are undifferentiated, they are called 'responsive.' Their essence is without distinction; their names differ according to meaning."

The Lord Emperor again asked: "Is the manifestation-body a dharma of existence or non-existence?"

The Most High replied: "Have I not said that all dharmas are inherently without possession—how could the manifestation-body be a dharma of existence? If provisionally named, it is both existent and non-existent. Because it does not depart from the original, it is called non-existent. Because sentient beings perceive it, it is called existent. Because it is not a separate essence, it is called non-existent. Because it truly benefits, it is called existent. It is like a bright mirror that reflects forms and images, clearly and distinctly, in various differences. The images in the mirror cannot be definitively said to be existent or non-existent, yet one may also say there are images in the mirror. Because the mind-mirror of all sentient beings is bright, they see the image of the true Dao. It is also like still water, without waves, where the reflections of the sun, moon, stars, and flying birds appear. The sun, moon, stars, and birds are all seen at the water’s bottom; all things also see their own reflections, clearly and distinctly. These objects in the water and their reflections are neither truly real—one cannot say they exist, nor can one say they do not exist. When the mind-water of all sentient beings is clear, the reflection of the Dao-body is seen likewise. Its essence is the true Dao, and thus it is not existent; yet because it is not unseen, it cannot be called non-existent. It is like one who pursues the departed by following their tracks and thus finds them—the tracks and the person are neither identical nor different. The manifestation-body is likewise. Those of clear understanding use the manifestation to enter awakening, see the true Dao-body, and know the boundless dharmas—thus it is called one. Yet it is not without relying on the manifestation that they gradually attain understanding, establish the field of merit—thus it is called different. Such meaning belongs to the realm of the Dao and cannot be comprehended by ordinary beings or lesser sages."

Thereupon, the Dao Lord, wishing to clarify this meaning, spoke again in verse:

The Dao-body neither arises nor ceases,
Following principle, it naturally pervades.
Serene and ever pure,
It stands alone, though called empty.

Beyond names, without opposition,
It forgets even the work of creation.
Profoundly still, its functions cease,
In tranquil emptiness it abides.

The original body is the beginning of all things,
Establishing the three realms.
Its mysterious workings are unfathomable,
Yet its perfect illumination follows each thought.

It is the wondrous root of manifestations,
Appearing in countless forms.
Spirit neither arises nor ceases,
Its marvelous work knows no coming or going.

The birth-body relies on father and mother,
Temporarily endowed with wisdom, it appears ordinary.
The jade womb is not of worldly conception,
Its transformations adapt to what is fitting.

Majestic and dignified, it inspires admiration,
Dispelling delusion and greed even in old age.
It is not a body of flesh and bone,
But extends according to the vow.

The provisional manifestation has no fixed place,
Yet its seen body endures long.
It appears in the five destinies’ forms,
Its countenance conforming to beauty or ugliness.

Following the original’s descent,
Its benefits know no preference.
Sometimes it arises through transformation,
At times through father and mother.

The Supreme Lord of the Grand Tenuity bowed again and said: "I venture to ask: does the Dao-body arise from causes, or is it without cause? If it arises from causes, like worldly dharmas, it is produced by conditions and thus impermanent. If it arises without cause, it falls into heterodox views, the doctrine of other paths. If the Dao-body does not arise from causes but exists naturally, then all sentient beings who do not cultivate the Dao should also attain the Dao. How can these two meanings be resolved? I humbly hope for your compassionate and expansive instruction."

The Dao Lord replied: "Supreme Lord of the Grand Tenuity, you have indeed brought forth such profound and subtle meanings. The true Dao is the mark of reality, which cannot be expressed by words. What is now called the Dao borrows words to reveal it, enabling awakening and entry. Understanding transcends words; forget the trap and grasp the intent—do not cling to the text. The Dao that is spoken of is unobstructed, like empty space—neither existent nor non-existent, neither foolish nor wise, neither cause nor effect, neither ordinary nor sagely, neither form nor mind, neither mark nor non-mark, and not even all dharmas, for it is not attached to anything."

"Why is this so? The nature of all dharmas is precisely non-nature; the nature of dharmas and the nature of the Dao are both ultimately empty. This emptiness is also empty; the emptiness of emptiness is also empty. Emptiness is without distinction, for distinctions are empty—thus it is without distinction. Moreover, all is empty, for emptiness is non-dual; hence it is said to be identical.

Yet sentient beings, unable to comprehend this meaning, generate notions of dharma where there is no dharma, and conceive of emptiness where there is no emptiness. Through such inverted thoughts, they become attached to views, harboring the four inversions. They falsely construct dharmas, clinging to self and things, and thus are bound to birth and death, failing to attain the Dao-body.

The Heavenly Worthy, the Great Sage, fully realizes this true nature—ultimately without nature—penetrating the source of the Dao, merging with its undifferentiated essence. This is called attaining the Dao. When body and Dao become one, it is called the Dao-body.

Cultivating this right contemplation is termed the cause; yet there is nothing to cultivate, hence it is called non-cause. Therefore, the true Dao does not arise from causes, nor is it causeless. Its essence is not a result, nor is it non-result; it is neither eternal nor non-eternal, neither ceasing nor non-ceasing.

Such profound and secret meanings can only be understood by the nature and the Dao. Even the highest sages and perfected immortals do not fully comprehend them; through the power of faith, they may vaguely grasp them.

This body dwells without abiding, yet abides nowhere it does not—this is the true and real body of the right Dao."

The Supreme Lord of the Grand Tenuity further inquired: "May I ask how the Heavenly Worthy’s birth-body and karmic marks are constituted?"

The Most High replied: "What is called birth is non-birth, unborn, apart from all birth. Why? The Heavenly Worthies of the ten directions have exhausted all birth; defilements and ignorance are forever purified, hence there is no birth. Yet to benefit sentient beings, they manifest in accordance with worldly dharmas—thus there appears to be birth.

Why? If I were to say that the qi of the Dao is lofty and remote, quiescent and unborn, beings would assume it cannot be cultivated, losing the mind of aspiration and failing to practice good deeds. Therefore, it is said that all sages possess a birth-fruit; yet they are not born due to karmic bonds or in accordance with vows.

If further explained, their birth in the heavens or among humans arises from superior karma as its cause, for among these, it is the foremost—this is the distinguishing mark of the birth-body."

The Supreme Lord of the Grand Tenuity bowed his head in reverence and said: "Excellent! The Dao Lord has expounded such profound and subtle meanings—never before have I heard such a wondrous sutra. It is like a person of meager fortune and heavy sins, born deaf and blind, who cannot perceive the five colors—blue, yellow, red, white, or black—or hear the five notes of the scale. A great physician of luminous skill imparts a wondrous art, opening their ears and eyes, so that all colors and sounds become perceptible.

I, too, am like this: through this sutra, I have come to hear and see the two kinds of body. Know that this sutra is the ear and eye of the Dharma; those who attain it can perceive the two Dharma-bodies of the right Dao—the provisional and the real.

The great physician of luminous skill is none other than the Dao Lord, who has bestowed this wondrous sutra upon me like eyes and ears. Those who receive this teaching attain the right Dao and its subtle body. Having attained the Dao-body, they can then conform and manifest the birth-body.

Since this sutra gives birth to the two bodies, it is called the Mother of Dharma. Why? This profound and wondrous teaching enables all to generate the true Dharma-body, just as a worldly mother gives birth to a child. The most filial of children constantly remember the kindness of nurture and embrace, desiring to repay it without end.

We, too, through this right teaching, have generated the untainted body. Therefore, we must always repay this debt with offerings: establishing halls and palaces, adorning them with the seven treasures, with incense, flowers, lamps, and candles, with music, banners, and canopies, worshiping morning and evening as if attending our own parents."

The Most High Dao Lord replied to the Supreme Lord: "So it is, so it is—just as you have said. From of old, I have never expounded such a teaching to others. Why? Because the capacity of learners was not yet sufficient. It is not that we, the Heavenly Worthies of the ten directions, conceal or withhold anything. All teachings expounded point to the one Dao—one flavor, one mark. Yet sentient beings each awaken to it in their own way, with differences in depth and attainment according to their understanding; this is called the distinct teaching. Yet it points to one mark, hence it is called the same return—there is no other sutra.

It is like the sky sending down a single sweet rain: the great rivers and seas receive it differently, and thus it is called different waters, though the rain is truly one. The great sages of the ten directions send down the one Dharma-rain, and according to the vessels of the three vehicles, the benefits differ—hence it is called the three teachings. The body-marks shown are likewise.

To those who have not awakened, it is as if it has not been spoken; to those who have understood, it is always complete and perfect. Therefore, we hold nothing in secret."

At that time, the Supreme Lord of the Grand Tenuity and the great assembly, hearing this Dharma-sound, marveled at what they had never before encountered. In the empty sky, celestial wondrous flowers rained down, and heavenly music resounded as they made offerings to the Dao Lord. Together, they spoke in unison, praising in verse:

We take refuge in the Most High Worthy,
Unsurpassed and supreme true Dharma King.
Skillfully expounding the two subtle bodies,
Like the equal descent of sweet dew and rain.
The three vehicles awaken with differences,
Yet all the Dao Lord’s words are all-embracing.
Beings float upon this Dharma-boat,
Crossing the great river of birth-and-death’s suffering.
Partaking of this pure and good Dharma-medicine,
The filth and sickness of body and mind are all cured.
Each receives the Dharma-benefit, joy pervading—
Thus we bow in gratitude to our compassionate father.

Then the Supreme Lord of the Grand Tenuity and the great assembly, having spoken this verse, addressed the Most High: "If all the teachings spoken by the divine worthies equally express the one Dao, without distinction of depth or shallowness, how then do the complete and the incomplete teachings arise, with their differing paths?"

The Dao Lord replied: "Whatever the great sages say is all right contemplation, the mind of omniscience—nothing is not ultimate, all is the definitive meaning. Yet because of sentient beings, there are differences between the partial and the complete."

For those of dull faculties, at times the teaching speaks of existence, at times of emptiness, at times of permanence, at times of impermanence—this is called the "two halves." As the teachings differ from before to after, they cannot be given all at once. Following the illness, a single remedy is prescribed, biased toward one truth—this is called "partial." Once the former illness is cured, another medicine is revealed. Since the treatment is complete, it is called "fulfilled." Having understood the two halves, one enters the Middle Way—only then is it called "complete" and "perfect."

For those of profound wisdom, hearing one side of the teaching, they immediately comprehend: conditioned designations are the true Middle Way. What is called "middle" is to be free from all attachments, yet without abandoning anything; not clinging to either extreme—hence it is called "middle." It can guide sentient beings to the noble abode, reaching the city of liberation—thus it is called "middle." One who understands this Middle Way is called "right contemplation." It is the foremost vehicle, capable of conveying practitioners beyond the three realms, transcending the two kinds of birth-and-death, realizing the true nature of dharmas, and attaining the supreme Dao.

Therefore, this sutra can shatter the boundless dark chamber of ignorance, allowing one to see the precious treasure of the supreme true Dharma. Like a bright lamp dispelling all darkness, it enables those with eyes to see all treasures, using them freely as they wish, delighting the heart with joy.

Now the Supreme Lord of the Grand Tenuity bowed and said to the Most High: "If this is so, then only a correct understanding of the essential Middle Way is needed to attain the Dao. Why must one further study other scriptures and precepts, which only bring weariness?"

The Most High replied: "If practitioners delve into the roots of the aggregates and virtue, fully comprehending the true emptiness and Middle Way, then they are already complete—there is no need to cultivate other methods. However, for the multitudes of sentient beings in the Five Defilements who have not yet grasped the profound and wondrous purport of this sutra, other teachings are first shown to tame their minds, cutting off the four mara-bandits of afflictions. Just as a king, though possessing boundless treasures and pleasures, still requires city walls, moats, and fortifications to guard against thieves and block all obstacles, so too does right contemplation. When the mind-king first awakens, it dwells in the city of the Middle Way, using precepts and wisdom as its walls and moats, firmly adorning itself and preparing for all mara-trials. Thus, the Heavenly Worthies of the ten directions expound the scriptures and precepts, broadly opening the Dharma-gates."

The Supreme Lord of the Grand Tenuity bowed his head and asked: "I venture to inquire of the Dao Lord: what are the ultimate distinctions of 'ultimate' and 'consummate'? I humbly request your instruction."

The Most High said: "'Ultimate' means decisive; 'consummate' means fixed. The Dharma I speak is decisively non-dual. As I say: the world is impermanent, like emptiness, empty of self, pure. The fruit of the Dao is eternally attained, blissful, free, truly pure. If other scholars come to question these meanings, they will never cause me to waver. All the divine worthies of the three times speak thus—this is the meaning of 'decisive' and 'ultimate.'

Furthermore, 'ultimate' means thorough; 'consummate' means true. When the Dao Lords speak of all dharmas, they say their original nature is pure, like the nature of empty space, provisionally existing through causes and conditions, yet not truly real in substance. The principle of the Middle Way is free from inversion—it is the mark of quiescence. Those who speak thus do so with thorough truthfulness, without falsehood. Hence, it is also called the meaning of 'ultimate.'

Moreover, 'ultimate' means to penetrate; 'consummate' means to comprehend. When the great sages of the ten directions sit at the seat of enlightenment, they realize profound right wisdom. In a single thought, they illuminate all dharmas and their true nature, penetrating and comprehending without error. This wisdom is perfect, corresponding to the true mark of dharmas, penetrating and comprehending without omission—hence it is called 'ultimate.'

As for 'consummate,' 'consummate' means to reach; 'consummate' means the limit. The divine worthies of the ten directions attain omniscience, reaching the limit of the Dharma—this is called 'consummate.'

Furthermore, 'consummate' means to sever; 'consummate' means to exhaust. All divine worthies, with the wisdom of true mark, sever and exhaust all afflictions and habits, attaining complete liberation—this clarifies 'consummate.'

Moreover, 'consummate' means to cross; 'consummate' means to have arrived. The great sages and perfected ones who have attained the Dao cross the sea of birth-and-death, having reached the other shore—hence it is called 'consummate.' Such are the distinctions of 'ultimate' and 'consummate.'

The Supreme Lord again asked: "What should this sutra be called, and what are the required methods for its transmission? I humbly request your full instruction."

The Most High said: "This sutra is called *Revealing the Secret Treasury*. Why? This sutra clarifies the meaning of the secret and wondrous bodies of the divine worthies of the three times and ten directions who have attained the Dao. Like us, the supreme Dharma-kings, who emerge in the Five Defilements to transform sentient beings, manifesting the three karmas, employing skillful means—our intentions are subtle and hidden, difficult to comprehend.

The reason is this: the bodies attained by the Heavenly Worthies of the ten directions are the true marks of the Dao, inherently harmonizing with nature, formless and nameless, not fabricated dharmas, like the mark of empty space. Having realized this Dharma for countless kalpas, they share one nature and mark, equal and non-dual. Yet they can manifest various Dharma-bodies, displaying cultivation, retribution, and responsive transformations without limit. In the realms of humans, gods, and evil destinies, they appear according to the types they encounter, conforming to their karmic actions and practices. Some appear surpassingly noble, transcending the world, supremely rare, unmatched and fearless, with awe-inspiring transformations and unimaginable freedom—this is called *Revealing the Secret Treasury of the Body.*

Within the true nature of the right Dao, though wordless and unspeakable, in the mark of quiescence, they skillfully employ causes and conditions to distinguish and reveal, teaching endlessly according to what is fitting. Their words and sequences are profound and recondite in meaning and flavor."

Should they expound the One Vehicle or the Three Vehicles, elucidating the karmic fruits of humans and gods, gradually guiding all to converge upon the true and singular right Dao—this is called *Revealing the Secret Treasury of the Mouth.*

Though free from thought and deliberation, beyond discriminative conceptions, with omniscience they penetrate the gate of emptiness, attaining right understanding and right contemplation, exhausting the bounds of principle to become one with the true reality. With knowledge of all modes, they illumine the dharmas of the world: form yet not form, mind yet not mind. The five destinies of humans and gods, the four great elements and six realms, the thoughts of sentient beings, and the karmic fruits of causes and conditions—all are clearly and unimpededly comprehended in a single thought. Skillfully discerning the roots and natures of beings, they act in accord with what is fitting, thoroughly penetrating and exhausting the secret dharmas of both the mundane and transcendent—this is called *Revealing the Secret Treasury of the Mind.*

Through these three kinds of secret Dharma, the true Dao-body is perfected, which neither ordinary beings nor even the highest sages can fathom or know. In this sutra, I have fully disclosed this meaning, clearly expounding the marks of the body and opening the gate of expedient means, guiding all learners to enter the profound mystery. Therefore, this sutra is named *Revealing the Profound Secret Treasury.*

Thus should it be received and upheld. This sutra is the most sublime among all Mahayana sutras. If there be one of utmost sincerity, capable of understanding and expounding its meaning, having ascertained such a person, bow in reverence and transmit it—no oath of secrecy is required. Why? Because those who have received other sutras already know their hearts, and this is also a matter of equality, without discrimination.

The Most August Lord of the Grand Tenuity bowed and said: "Excellent! O Dao-Lord, in expounding such profound and recondite meaning, today I have first come to know that the Divine Honored One is truly the father and mother of all beings. Through the power of great compassion and great mercy, within the markless you reveal the true Dharma-mark, proclaiming these three kinds of subtle and secret purports, enabling all future beings to awaken to the One Vehicle, attain the wondrous Dharma-body, and realize supreme enlightenment. They will themselves comprehend the secret treasury and, in turn, be able to reveal for all beings the three kinds of profound secrets.

Only now do I truly understand that the supreme Mahayana, the equal and right Dharma, makes no distinction of purity or defilement, bestowing only upon those capable of practice. Those with the heart to receive it shall transmit it forthwith, that this wondrous teaching may widely circulate, universally opening the Dharma-eye for all, continuing the unsurpassed position of the Dao-Lord, and ensuring the Wheel of the Three Jewels turns without cease, radiating its light unbroken."

The Most High addressed him, saying: "Excellent! O Emperor-Lord, that you are able to resolve to propagate this Dharma. Future men and women who receive this blessing shall all behold the right Dao and attain the pure Dharma-body. Know this, Emperor-Lord: if other sutras were not to circulate, there would be no profound harm to the world; but should even a single verse of this sutra be lost, it would give rise to all manner of calamities and misfortunes. Why? Because this sutra clearly reveals the true Dao-body, which is the ultimate refuge and dwelling of all beings. If this sutra is lost, they will forever remain orphaned and exposed, drifting in the three evil destinies and five paths, submerged in endless suffering, with no means of liberation. Why? Because they will have lost their root-source and have nowhere to return."

Thus, Emperor-Lord, you must ever single-mindedly propagate and proclaim this Dharma, ensuring its unbroken circulation. I once received it from the Supreme Emperor, who received it from the Five Emperors and the Most High Jade Sovereign; the Jade Sovereign received it from the Jade Clarity Emperor-Lord and the Great King Who Subdues Demons; the Great King received it from the August Emperor-Lord of the Eight Heavens. Thus it was transmitted mouth to mouth, without reliance on written text. Now, Emperor-Lord, you may commit it to writing and record it, that it may circulate among future beings. I shall guard this sutra with my divine power, and wherever it abides, all shall be auspicious. When the great kalpa comes full cycle and all other Ways perish, this sutra alone shall endure, returning to the Great Luo Heaven, descending again to the world in accord with conditions, to deliver gods and humans.

Thereupon, the Emperor-Lord of the Grand Tenuity carved jade into tablets and engraved gold into characters, binding them with silver, and compiled this sutra. He placed it in a casket of purple jade, sealed it upon a seven-jeweled dais, while immortal youths and jade maidens scattered flowers and burned incense in offering to the sacred text. When the great assembly had received the sutra, the Most High Dao-Lord returned to Jade Capital, and all who had gathered bowed in reverence and departed.

Thus concludes the *Most High Cavernous Mystery Divine Treasure: The Sutra of Unfolding the Secret Treasury*.
