# 洞玄灵宝道要经

**The Essential Dao of the Cavernous Mystery and Numinous Treasure Sutra**

Thus says the Dao:

The Great Dao is profound and void,
serene and nameless.
Filial piety arises from the unborn and unconditioned,
taking form through the law of filiality.
Nameless, it is called the Dao.
Abiding in the supreme,
it responds without descending.
Its name and conduct are lofty and far-reaching,
its benefits vast and boundless,
its spiritual penetration unhindered,
without end or beginning—
thus it is named the Dao of Filial Piety.

All that has form
is not born without the Dao,
nor perfected without filial piety.
Thus the Great Dao generates primordial qi,
primordial qi generates the Supreme Ultimate,
the Supreme Ultimate generates Heaven and Earth,
and Heaven and Earth generate the myriad things.
Among the myriad kinds,
humankind holds the foremost place.
Among the ten thousand spirits,
the Great Dao is most revered.
Revering the Dao with benevolence and filial piety—
thus it is named the Dao of Filial Piety.

The Dao is the father of the myriad things,
also called the mother of the myriad things.
It is also said:
The Dao generates the One,
the One generates the Two,
the Two generate the Three,
and the Three generate the myriad things.
The myriad things flourish when they attain the Dao,
and perish when they lose it.

Subtle, yielding, and gentle,
enduring humiliation with compassion and filial piety—
advancing in cultivation along the Middle Way,
the heart knows no weariness.
Nurturing oneself with filial piety,
one repays the primordial grace.
The mysterious father and mysterious mother—
the great kindness of the two parents.
The great kindness of the two parents—
thus it is named practicing filial piety,
practicing the Dao of Filial Piety.

The heart emerges from emptiness,
the Dao enters into nothingness.
Emptiness and nothingness resonate,
responding without movement.
In response, the Dao is accomplished—
the Dao of Filial Piety is perfected.
Thus, with an empty heart, one awaits all things,
and all things, with empty hearts, await in return.
Only when both await each other
does spirit commune.
First, the spirit is penetrated,
then the body.
When both body and spirit are penetrated,
the Dao of Filial Piety is accomplished.

Emerging from being and entering non-being,
dividing its form into a hundred million,
it dwells without limitation.
In Heaven, it is the numinous spirits;
on Earth, it is the earthly deities.
The numinous spirits of Heaven and the deities of Earth—
these are the root essence of the Two Radiant Ones.
From dawn to dusk, they radiate and nourish,
fostering all that lives.
In the East, they govern the Nine Yi;
in the South, the Eight Man;
in the West, the Six Rong;
in the North, the Five Di;
and in the Center, the Three Tai.
Though the borderlands teem with diverse kinds,
and the races of water and land, moving and still,
all rely on the Dao to receive life.

The mother nurtures with compassion,
the child lives through filial piety.
On the day of birth and completion,
there is the certainty of returning nourishment.
Even the hearts of insects and birds
know to repay kindness.
Those who commit the Five Rebellions
are inferior to birds and beasts.
Failing to practice the Dao of Filial Piety,
turning against the primordial grace—
these are called evil men,
not true gentlemen.
They are not called Daoists,
but truly sinful ghosts.

Among all human relations,
those who do not practice the Dao of Filial Piety,
who see goodness yet do not follow,
who hear the Dao yet do not believe—
the Dao, like a compassionate grace,
never abandons the multitudes.
Through expedient means, it manifests,
displaying manifold spiritual transformations
and subtle confirmations.
Those who cannot employ it
are called "decaying corpses."
The corpse of decay—
like a withered soul.
The essence that guards the corpse
dwells within the body.

At that time, the Radiant and August True King spoke a verse:

Do not say filial piety is not real,
do not say the Dao is not divine.
Practicing filial piety illumines the world,
clearly shining upon your heart.
A deluded heart, dark and unenlightened,
hesitates and loses the path of life.
At the auspicious gathering, merit is examined—
without merit, one is never delivered.
Heaven’s halls are silent and joyless,
Hell’s realms are cold and frozen.
I tell you, O disciples of the Hall of Rites,
diligently tread the steps of immortals and perfected ones.
Do not follow the foolish, dead multitude,
whose bodies turn to ash and gather with ants.
Once fallen as a wandering ghost,
for ten thousand kalpas, the path of life is forgotten.
The torments of boiling cauldrons and scorching coals are endless—
vague and desolate, they guard the tombs.

When the True King had spoken this verse,
he snapped his fingers,
and the sound reached the eighteen hells of boiling cauldrons and scorching coals,
and the six gates of suffering.
He then spoke a verse of woe:

Heaven’s halls are never closed,
Hell’s gates have never opened.
Suffering knows no rest,
as sinful ghosts gather in throngs.
Thirsty, they drink boiling broth;
hungry, they eat hot ashes.
Why did they lose the Dao of Filial Piety?
Wealth and lust brought calamity.
Strong and vigorous, they did not practice the Dao—
only at life’s end did they seek to turn back.
Hearing of filial piety, they mocked and scorned—
now in boiling cauldrons and fire, they grieve forever.

Thereupon, the True King completed this verse.
He released the radiance of filial piety,
illuminating the world with penetrating clarity.
The light transformed into lamps,
shining upon the eighteen great hells of accumulated darkness.
The True King’s compassionate qi
transformed into five-colored immortal clouds,
pervading the ten directions and boundless worlds.
All the sinful ghosts
were simultaneously pardoned.
Bathed in the mysterious stream,
they ascended the Phoenix Stairs.
Bowing in repentance for their transgressions,
they rejoiced in peace and prosperity,
and sang:

The six gates have removed the records of sin,
the nine darknesses hold no opposing souls.
The heavenly lamps brighten the dark chambers—
we bow our heads and worship the Mysterious Gate.
The Three Officials no longer accept petitions,
forever returning to the One Revered by the Emperor.

When the sinful ghosts had sung this song,
before they could receive rebirth,
they returned to the tombs.
Night after night, they appeared in dreams,
speaking to their descendants:
"If you wish for the living and the dead to attain their desires,
hasten to burn the incense of the Nine Darknesses,
establish pure abodes,
and abundantly provide beds and seats.
With a sincere heart, practice the Dao,
compassionately saving the myriad things.
Through incense, lamps, vows, and mindfulness,
repay the kindness of the two parents,
repay the grace of the Great Dao.
Recite and transmit the scriptural teachings,
assist the nation and sustain life.
Rescue the orphaned and endangered,
heal illnesses and epidemics.
Abide in the One and establish merit,
exhorting others to do good."

At that time, when ordinary people were moved by these dreams, they awoke with a start from their sleep. Each saw in their courtyards the celestial lamps illuminating brightly, their radiance piercing the heart, and all awakened in profound understanding. They practiced filial piety and upheld the Dao for eighteen years, attaining the six spiritual penetrations. Their deceased ancestors, transformed in the Southern Palace, were all reborn in blessed realms, where they beheld the Dao and heard the Dharma, ascending together to immortal ranks.

The Dao declares: The virtue of the Dao is vast and great, and filial piety bridges the unseen and the manifest. Sinful ghosts, pardoned, practiced the Dao; descendants, awakened in darkness, practiced filial piety. Those who serve Our Dao must first practice filial piety and only then cultivate the Dao—thus it is called the Filial Dao. In the past, there were those who first cultivated the Dao and only afterward practiced filial piety. The Dao is without birth or extinction, but humans have a beginning and an end. If one cultivates the Dao yet the Dao remains unfulfilled, and one wishes to be filial, their parents may not wait. Because they did not wait, there arises the grief of unending sorrow. This harms harmony and depletes qi, and cannot be called an easy exchange. When one passes forty, signs of decline appear. The practice of abiding in the One is abandoned, and the mourning of the heart is never completed. By sixty, their corpse lies in the tomb. After three years have passed, form and spirit do not disperse. Divine birds spread their wings to cover them, and fierce beasts stand guard in protection.

On the seventh day of the seventh month, the autumnal equinox festival, the Supreme Heavenly Worthy looked down in compassion. By the autumn equinox, he dispatched a celestial messenger bearing divine cinnabar to descend and rescue them. Upon entering the mouth, they revived as if waking from sleep. The Eight Kings of the Western Palace bestowed upon them a whirlwind chariot. Ascending to the Heavenly Treasury, they were named Filial Immortals. To this day, they endure for ninety thousand great kalpas, their forms like gold and jade, their complexion resembling clouds. Passing from death to life, they abide eternally without end.

When the Filial Immortals first began, they endured the hardships of mud and ashes, unchanging through wind and frost, unaltered by hunger and distress. The Dao values the perfection of cinnabar; one must uphold lofty aspirations. Embracing purity and holding fast to integrity, only then may one attain fruition. Seated in a cloud chariot, they soar and float to the upper realms. Even now, in practicing filial piety, they recall their parents, whose boundless great kindness enabled their attainment of the Dao—an inconceivable debt.

In a past kalpa, there was one who first practiced utmost filial piety. Both parents lived to one hundred and thirty-seven years, while the child had already reached one hundred and five. Skilled in medicines and elixirs, he regularly consumed the radiance of cinnabar. Parents and child alike retained their vigor, their sinews unweakened. Thus, the filial son donned embroidered robes. Proficient in music, he performed songs and dances twice daily to entertain them. When his parents passed away one day, it was as if they had fallen asleep—no pain or distress, their minds undisturbed. The filial son prepared their tomb and interred his parents. Birds and beasts gathered in clouds to assist, carrying soil in their beaks. After three years, the mound rose a hundred feet high.

Thereupon, the filial son built a hut and dwelled there for nine years, practicing filial piety and cultivating the Dao. Divine candles illuminated his heart throughout the land. Fragrant officials encircled the tomb, bearing witness to his devotion. Heaven and Earth, his parents, moved by his sincerity, bestowed upon him the intertwined pears. Ascending to the Western Palace, he was granted the title *Golden Radiance Filial Son, Luminous Jade Perfected Youth*. Though he attained the Dao in old age, he reverted to youthfulness. Even as a perfected being, he did not forget the Filial Dao.

How much more so for ordinary mortals who forget kindness and betray righteousness, who abandon benevolence and virtue—how do they differ from corpses? They rebel against Heaven and Earth, indulging in lust and wine. Greedy and unrighteous, they profit at the expense of others. They devour fish and meat, their mouths stained with fat and blood. Their entire bodies reek of foulness, and they trust in demonic deceptions. Some leave home for profit, falsely claiming to uphold the Dao. They damage merit and virtue, embezzle sacred wealth, and trade in wine and lust, never knowing contentment. When death approaches, they beg for mercy, but their sins are already recorded, and their spirit does not abide. Their minds are confused, their qi scattered, their complexion altered. Though they may repent, the Dao does not pardon. Their hun and po disperse, suffering torment in every realm. Their flesh becomes food for ants, their bones and flesh mingling with the earth. Their five viscera rot away, leaving no trace of human form.

I tell you: if you wish to practice the Filial Dao in your next life, diligently recite the scriptures and admonitions, contemplate your body and mind, and sever all attachments. Once attachments are cut off, afflictions cease. Afflictions arise from craving; if craving is severed, the bonds of birth and death are forever broken without remainder, and body and mind attain bliss. The mind of the Dao expands boundlessly; seven generations of ancestors receive blessings—how could only one’s own self attain the Dao?

The divine power of the Filial Dao is like that of Heaven and Earth. All that Heaven and Earth generate arises without seed. Only one’s parents cannot be counterfeited. One ought to practice filial piety to repay their great kindness. One ought to cultivate the Dao, observe precepts, and perform deliverance rites, burn incense and light lamps to relieve suffering and peril. When seven generations of ancestors are in distress, they place their hope in their descendants, invoking the divine power of the Dao in hopes of liberation. Like a prisoner shackled in chains, they long for an imperial pardon to wash away their sins, to attain joy and freedom, their hearts free from sorrow.

The records of sins in the unseen and manifest realms differ only in degree. To have sins and receive pardon is not as good as having no sins at all. Though sins may be forgiven, their mark remains. Having lost even one virtue, one’s integrity is forever compromised. Thus, life must not be squandered, nor the Dao forgotten. To forget the Dao and lose life is to be called a sinful ghost, not a human.

To forget the Dao and lose life is to drift with circumstances, endlessly turning without cease. Like drifting on a vast sea, unaware of its boundaries, longing to return to familiar shores, one is tossed by wind and waves, forever losing the way back. Those who lose the Dao of life are likewise lost. While still strong and healthy, with difficult tasks yet to accomplish, why not practice filial piety and cultivate the supreme Dao, forever severing the causes of birth, death, and affliction?

The Dao says: Those who hear my Dao are worthy; those who practice my Dao are perfected beings.

At that time, the Immortal King composed a verse:
*To know the Filial Dao’s grandeur,*
*Every hall is filled with maidens fair.*
*In the Western Palace’s chambers bright,*
*They await their turn to serve as kings and lords.*
*When my Dao prevails,*
*Heavenly lamps shine everywhere.*
*Divine incense illumines clear awareness,*
*Auspicious clouds arise o’er hills and plains.*
*Hostile nations lay down their arms,*
*The four seas cease their wars.*
*Those who uphold the Filial Dao’s precepts*
*Shall soon behold the Great Peace.*

The Dao says: The Dao does not cultivate people; people must cultivate the Dao. The Dao is fundamentally natural; it does not cultivate the human Dao. Humans are not natural; thus, they must strive with diligence. In cultivating the natural Dao, among the thirty-six thousand essential teachings, the Filial Dao is the foundation. None who are unkind and unfilial, who rebel against parents or murder their lords, have ever attained the Dao. Those who are disloyal and unfilial are called the Ten Evil Ones. In life, they violate royal law; in death, they enter hell. They endure trials in life and death without hope of release, falling into the realm of hungry ghosts.

The Dao says: Utmost filial piety in cultivating the Dao is cultivating the Filial Dao. The Dao resides in utmost filial piety; unfiliality is not the Dao. Why is this so? Filial piety engenders compassion, filial piety fosters forbearance, filial piety inspires diligence, filial piety endures hardship, filial piety upholds firm integrity, filial piety subdues all demonic affairs. Wealth, sex, wine, meat, fame, and glory—these are the snares of the world.

Those who contend through plunder and strife, who engage in armed conflict and slaughter—
the truly filial remain unmoved, their hearts at peace.
Abiding in oneness without wavering, all demonic affairs naturally subside.
Filial devotion forges an iron barrier, sealing the path of death;
thus, all demonic bridges and crossings are severed.
Within and without, all is still—devoted solely to the Way of Filial Piety.
No internal strife arises, no external foes lie in ambush.
The Way of Filial Piety is formless, beyond all grasping at appearances.
The Way of Filial Piety is vast and boundless, beyond all abandonment of form.
To grasp or abandon form is to lack true responsiveness;
only in non-grasping and non-abandonment does the inexhaustible treasury manifest.
For the inexhaustible treasury admits neither grasping nor abandoning;
to grasp or abandon is to invite exhaustion and weariness.
Exhaustion is not the Dao; weariness is not filial piety.
Neither exhausted nor weary—this is the true Way of Filial Piety.
Filial piety is like breath: qi must not cease.
To cease qi is to perish; to cease filial piety is to fail the Dao.
With each breath, each thought—whether in movement, stillness, or recollection—
every moment must dwell in the heart, never to be forsaken.
To forsake it is to fail the Dao; thus, it must never be abandoned.

The Dao says: Those who wish to bear sons and daughters and seek the Way of Filial Piety
must not seek it for profit, nor seek it for desire.
Profit gives rise to deluded greed; deluded greed is not the Dao.
Desire gives rise to jealousy and envy, the roots of all suffering,
which flourish through desire.
Jealousy is not virtue; suffering is not the Dao.
To seek the Dao through desire is to fail in attaining it.
The Dao is not found in sacrifices, nor in wine and meat.
The pursuit of the Dao is inherently pure; it cannot be defiled by negligence.
The Way of Filial Piety is sought without attachment, not through worldly wisdom.
The Great Dao is formless; it cannot be sought through appearances.
Those who seek the Dao should do so with a mind of non-attainment.
Neither seek with the mind of the past, nor with the mind of the future.
Seek with a mind neither arising nor ceasing,
with a mind of secrecy,
with a mind of vastness,
with a mind of sincerity,
with a mind of forbearance and diligence,
with a mind of stillness and gentleness,
with a mind of compassion and utmost filial piety.
These are but brief outlines of the Dao’s essentials; by analogy, the rest may be inferred.
In time, clarity will come of itself.

Then, the True King briefly expounded the essentials of the Dao for all beings,
disseminating and venerating its teachings.
Those who attain it recite and contemplate it day and night,
cultivating its practices with diligence.
Thus, their hearts attain the Dao in ways beyond conception.
