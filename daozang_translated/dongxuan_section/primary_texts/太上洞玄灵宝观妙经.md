*The Supreme Cavern Mystery Numinous Treasure Scripture on Contemplating the Wondrous*

If one desires to contemplate the wondrous and attain perfection, one must first abandon perverse and deviant conduct. Sever all external affairs, then settle and still the mind, allowing thoughts to gradually cease. With prolonged practice, the mind becomes increasingly tranquil.

Extinguish only the moving mind, not the still mind;
Congeal only the empty mind, not the mind of existence.

Above the still mind, all is suddenly unbounded;
Below the still mind, all is utterly unburdened.

Whether engaged in affairs or not, remain as if without mind;
In stillness or activity, let the will be singular.

If one binds the mind too tightly, illness may arise,
Manifesting as madness or delusion—these are its signs.

If the mind remains unmoving, one must also allow it freedom,
Ever adjusting and harmonizing, lest it become stagnant.

To engage in affairs without malice, to encounter matters without vexation—
This is true stillness.

Yet do not, on account of being unvexed by affairs, seek excessive discernment.

With prolonged stillness, spirit congeals, and celestial radiance arises of itself.
Do not hasten or force it, lest it contravene the natural.

Within the realm of stillness, perceive without grasping;
If one grasps at anything, the false disrupts the true.

With sustained practice, the Dao is naturally attained.

Those who attain the Dao pass through five stages of the mind and seven signs of the body.

**Five Stages of the Mind:**
1. The mind is more often moving than still;
2. The mind is equally moving and still;
3. The mind is more often still than moving;
4. The mind is still when unoccupied, yet moves when engaged;
5. The mind constantly merges with the Dao, untroubled even by contact.

**Seven Signs of the Body:**
1. The mind attains true stability, untainted by clamor or dust;
2. Long-standing ailments vanish, body and mind become clear and refreshed;
3. Deficiencies are replenished, life is restored, and years are renewed;
4. Lifespan is extended beyond the worldly, and one is called an *immortal*;
5. The form is refined into *qi*, and one is called a *perfected person*;
6. *Qi* is refined into spirit, and one is called a *spiritual person*;
7. Spirit is refined to merge with the Dao, and one is called a *supreme person*.

One’s power of discernment grows ever clearer with each sign.

If, after long study of stilling the mind, not a single sign appears,
And only when the impure body perishes does emptiness arise—
To attain the true Dao in such a case has never been heard of.
