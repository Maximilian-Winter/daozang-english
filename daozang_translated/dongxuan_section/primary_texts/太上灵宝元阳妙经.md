### **The Supreme Numinous Treasure Primordial Yang Wondrous Scripture, Volume 1**
**The Sagely Conduct Chapter, Part One**

At that time, the Perfected One of Primordial Yang, Radiant Wondrous Sound, heard that the Heavenly Worthy was in the Jeweled Palace of the Mysterious Capital, the Supreme Purple Tenuity Palace, the Wondrous Joy Realm, and the Primordial Yang World, expounding the Mahāyāna scriptural teachings to the assembled host of celestial great sages and flying spirit-kings. For the retinues of divine immortals, he elucidated the profound meanings, the subtle and wondrous scriptures, the divine transformations, and the inconceivable manifestations.

Having heard this, Wondrous Sound was filled with joy. He then led his eighty-four thousand disciples, saying: "I have now heard of a sagely honored one, whose majestic virtue is resplendent beyond compare. You must prepare precious incense and rare treasures, banners and canopies, palanquins and carriages, musical instruments and performances—all the requisites for offering. Tomorrow at noon, we shall seek out this luminous master."

Upon hearing these words, the disciples were each astonished and doubtful, marveling at what they had never before encountered. They swiftly prepared their journey, adorning themselves with coral and amber, luminous pearls and jeweled banners, fragrant flowers and the rarest treasures of the world. Their attendants and followers rode upon clouds and dragons, soaring through the void.

Upon arriving at the abode of the Heavenly Worthy, Wondrous Sound and his retinue trembled with awe, their movements unsettled. From among the assembly, a perfected one named Worthy Wisdom proclaimed in a loud voice: "We, your disciples, now adjust our robes and crowns, purify our sight and hearing, and set up a table in the empty space with hundred-fold blended incense. We array banners, jeweled canopies, and musical instruments, surrounding the honored one on all sides, filling the void."

Worthy Wisdom, clad in proper attire, held an incense burner, lowered his brows, gathered his knees, softened his breath, and harmonized his voice. Bowing his head in reverence, he advanced to make obeisance, inquiring after the celestial countenance and the honored one’s well-being. He then proclaimed the Dharma teachings, ensuring that virtue remained unharmed and harmony undisturbed.

Worthy Wisdom, by virtue of past causes, had fortunately been favored by the exalted perfected ones. Through the turning of karmic conditions, he had encountered the Dao’s dispensation. His joy in compassion was boundless, yet lingering obstructions from past lives still left him with deep doubts. Long immersed in delusion, he had no means to awaken. Now, hearing that the Heavenly Worthy had extended great merciful grace, opening the path of compassion, he had become a great vessel, a great ladder, a great enlightened master, and the supreme lord of the Dao for all the people—men and women, ordinary beings, and sentient beings.

Worthy Wisdom dared to rely upon the radiant majesty and this wondrous power to venture a humble inquiry into the doubts that weighed upon his heart. He prostrated himself, entreating the great master to take pity on the foolish and ignorant and deign to bestow his enlightening answers.

The Heavenly Worthy remained silent for a long while. Then, his face suffused with five-colored light, the three luminaries shone brilliantly, his seventy-two marks and eighty excellences illuminated the ten directions and the worlds as numerous as the sands of the Ganges. He emitted a great Dharma sound, resounding through the lands.

"Excellent! Excellent! Your questions are profound indeed. In accordance with what you have asked, I shall now resolve them."

Worthy Wisdom addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: "Since you have deigned to enlighten and awaken sentient beings, I venture to ask—what practices and vows must one cultivate to attain the fruit of the Dao?"

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "If one seeks to cultivate the wondrous natural Dao, one must first eliminate the six corrupting deeds."

The Perfected Worthy Wisdom then asked: "By what causes and conditions are these called the six corrupting deeds?"

The Heavenly Worthy answered: "The first is miserly greed; the second, breaking precepts; the third, anger and hatred; the fourth, laziness and sloth; the fifth, distraction and disorder; the sixth, ignorance and delusion. Those who cultivate the natural Dao must eliminate these six corrupting deeds—only then may the true Dao be attained.

"Furthermore, there are five contemplations of the body. What are these five? The first is contemplating the body as impure; the second, contemplating the body as suffering and affliction; the third, contemplating the body as impermanent; the fourth, contemplating all dharmas as without self; the fifth, contemplating the body as empty and quiescent, possessing nothing whatsoever. Good son, Perfected Ones and Daoists must constantly cultivate these five contemplations.

"Moreover, there is one practice—the Heavenly Worthy’s *Supreme Wondrous Scripture of Primordial Yang*. What is the sacred practice cultivated by the Perfected One? When a Perfected One or Daoist first hears this great scripture from the Heavenly Worthy, their heart arises in reverence and faith. Having revered and believed in the Dharma, they should cultivate the following reflection: There exists the supreme Dao, the great and correct Dharma, the scriptures of Primordial Yang. I now reflect that, for the sake of seeking what is most essential, I must relinquish my beloved wife and children, parents and siblings, the six relations and kin, my dwelling and abode, gold and silver, jewels and treasures, servants and slaves. I must further think thus: Dwelling at home is constricting, like being bound in fetters—all roots of transgression arise from it. Leaving the household is serene and free, like empty space—all causes of goodness and benefit depend upon it. If I remain at home, I cannot recite the scriptures of Primordial Yang, nor cultivate wisdom. I must now renounce love and attachment and leave the household to study the Dao.

"I must further resolve: I shall now decisively sever attachment and cultivate the supreme, correct, and natural fruit. When a Perfected One or Daoist desires to leave the household, various heavenly demons and malevolent spirits will arise to disturb and vex them—they must then engage in great struggle with me.

"Good son, how does such a Perfected One contend with others in struggle? At that time, the Perfected One or Daoist proceeds to the Palace of Primordial Yang. There, beholding the Heavenly Worthy and his disciples—whose majestic bearing is complete, whose faculties are pure, whose hearts are gentle and yielding, serene and free from action—they approach and seek to leave the household, casting aside secular robes and donning the vestments of the Dharma. Having left the household, they uphold the precepts of the Dharma, their majestic bearing unblemished, their conduct composed and dignified. They commit no transgressions, not even minor faults, and dare not entertain them in their hearts. They guard the precepts of the Dharma as a child guards its life.

"It is like a person carrying a gourd to cross a vast sea. A sea deity then appears and begs for the gourd. Hearing this, the person thinks: *If I give it to you, I will surely drown.* They reply to the sea deity: *You may kill me, but the gourd cannot be yours.* The sea deity persists: *If you cannot give it all to me, then give me half.* The person still refuses. The sea deity says: *If you cannot give me half, then a third.* The person again refuses. The sea deity then says: *Give me a piece the size of your hand.* The person still refuses. The sea deity pleads: *I am starving and freezing, suffering greatly—grant me even a thread’s worth.* The person still refuses, saying: *What you ask is not much, but I am now crossing the sea, uncertain of its bounds or how far the shore lies. Why should I give it to you? If I perish in the sea, what regret will avail me?*

"Good son, the Perfected One or Daoist who guards the precepts of the Dharma is likewise thus—like one crossing the sea, cherishing the gourd. When the Perfected One guards the precepts of the Dharma, the sea deities of affliction and evil constantly say to them: *Believe in me—I will not deceive you. Merely break the five precepts and uphold the Dharma—by this cause and condition, you will be secure and attain the immortal ranks of Primordial Yang.* At that time, they should reply: *I would rather uphold these precepts and fall into the hell of dark sands than break the precepts, violate the Dharma, and be reborn in heaven.*

"The sea deity of affliction then says: *If you cannot break the five precepts, then eat human flesh—by this cause and condition, you will be secure and attain the immortal ranks of Primordial Yang.* The Perfected One does not heed their words. The sea deity says: *If you cannot eat human flesh, then commit theft and robbery—by this cause and condition, you will be secure and attain the immortal ranks of Primordial Yang.* The Perfected One still does not comply. The sea deity says: *If you cannot commit theft and robbery, then commit the five heinous crimes—by this cause and condition, you may be secure and enter the immortal ranks of Primordial Yang.* The Perfected One again refuses. The sea deity says: *If you cannot commit the five heinous crimes, then enter the chamber of lust—by this cause and condition, you will be secure and attain the immortal ranks of Primordial Yang.* The Perfected One still does not comply. The sea deity says: *If you will not enter the chamber of lust, then break the four alliance precepts—by this cause and condition, you may be secure and enter the immortal ranks of Primordial Yang.*

"At that time, the Perfected One reflects in their heart: *If I break the four alliance precepts and do not confess and repent, I will be unable to cross the shore of birth and death and attain the immortal ranks of Primordial Yang.* Thus, the Perfected One or Daoist guards even the most minor precepts with unyielding resolve, their heart like adamant."

The Perfected One and Daoist masters uphold the one hundred and eighty precepts and the supreme wisdom precepts, honoring and revering them equally without distinction. If the Perfected One can firmly uphold these, they will be complete in the true Dao, dedicating their precepts to the Primordial Correct and True Dao.

At that time, the wise and virtuous Perfected One further observes the Five Register Precepts: first, not to kill living beings; second, not to steal others’ property; third, not to engage in illicit relations with others’ wives; fourth, not to speak harsh or false words; fifth, not to consume alcohol or meat. If the Perfected One cultivates these Five Register Precepts, they will never commit evil and will enter the joy of the unconditioned and truly eternal.

Furthermore, good man, there are two kinds of precepts: first, the precept of purifying the mind; second, the precept of ceasing worldly entanglements. The precept of purifying the mind means conducting oneself without the slightest defilement, with a resolve that does not transgress wrongdoing. The precept of ceasing worldly entanglements means: not engaging in the trade of treasures to seek blessings and joy; not borrowing others’ power and influence to elevate oneself; not seeking worldly meat flavors to sate hunger and emptiness; not delighting in ornate and luxurious clothing for adornment; not delighting in lofty and spacious dwellings, beds, mats, screens, curtains, felt blankets, brocade, and other such things. If one can sever all such matters, good man, this is called the precept of ceasing worldly entanglements. The Perfected One and Daoist masters uphold these prohibitive precepts equally without distinction.

Good man, when the Perfected One and Daoist masters receive and uphold such dharma precepts, they make this vow: *I would rather cast this body into fierce fire and deep pits than break the dharma precepts established by the Primordial Heavenly Worthy and act impurely like the common multitude of beings.*

Furthermore, good man, the Perfected One and Daoist masters make this vow: *I would rather have molten iron poured over my body than dare break the dharma and accept the clothing of faithful and virtuous ones.*

Furthermore, good man, the Perfected One and Daoist masters make this vow: *I would rather have this mouth swallow molten iron than dare break the dharma and consume the food and drink of faithful and virtuous ones.*

Furthermore, good man, the Perfected One and Daoist masters make this vow: *I would rather have this body lie upon a bed of hot iron than dare break the dharma and accept the bedding and furnishings of faithful and virtuous ones.*

Furthermore, good man, the Perfected One and Daoist masters make this vow: *I would rather have this body suffer from grave illness than dare break the dharma and accept the medicine of faithful and virtuous ones.*

Furthermore, good man, the Perfected One and Daoist masters make this vow: *I would rather cast this body into a cauldron of boiling iron than dare break the dharma and accept the houses and dwellings of faithful and virtuous ones.*

Furthermore, good man, the Perfected One and Daoist masters make this vow: *I would rather have an iron rod shatter this body than break the dharma and accept the reverence and bows of faithful and virtuous ones.*

Furthermore, good man, the Perfected One and Daoist masters make this vow: *I would rather have iron hooks gouge out my eyes than harbor impure thoughts and indulge in others’ beauty.*

Furthermore, good man, the Perfected One and Daoist masters make this vow: *I would rather have iron awls pierce my ears than harbor defiled thoughts and listen to pleasant sounds.*

Furthermore, good man, the Perfected One and Daoist masters make this vow: *I would rather have a sharp blade cut off my nose than harbor defiled thoughts and covet various fragrances.*

Furthermore, good man, the Perfected One and Daoist masters make this vow: *I would rather have a sharp blade sever my tongue than harbor defiled thoughts and crave various flavors.*

Furthermore, good man, the Perfected One and Daoist masters make this vow: *I would rather have an axe hew my body than harbor defiled thoughts and covet various tactile sensations.*

Why is this? For this reason: they vow that all beings may uphold the dharma precepts and attain the pure dharma.

Good man, when the Perfected One and Daoist masters cultivate such pure dharma, they immediately abide in the Unmoving Ground. What is the Unmoving Ground? The Perfected One abiding in this Unmoving Ground is unshaken and does not fall, does not retreat and does not scatter.

Good man, for example, the fierce winds of the Jade Capital Mountain cannot shake it; the Perfected One and Daoist masters abiding in this ground are likewise unmoved by forms, sounds, and flavors, nor scattered by perverse views and the winds of lust.

Good man and woman, *unmoving* means not being disturbed by greed, hatred, or delusion. *Not falling* means not falling into the three evil destinies. *Not retreating* means not retreating from the dharma and returning to the household life. *Not scattering* means not being scattered and destroyed by the retrogressive *Primordial Yang* scriptures.

Furthermore, the Perfected One and Daoist masters are also unmoved by the demon kings of afflictions, unshaken by evil spirits, and even when sitting beneath the bodhi tree in the grove of *Kan* trees, though demon kings may be present, they cannot cause them to retreat from the supreme, correct, and true great Dao, nor are they disturbed by the demon of death. This is called the Perfected One cultivating true practice.

Good man, what is *true practice*? True practice is what the Heavenly Worthy and all immortals practice, hence it is called true practice. For what reason are the Heavenly Worthy and Perfected Ones called *sages*? Such beings possess the dharma of sages and constantly contemplate the quiescent nature of all dharmas; for this reason, they are called Perfected Ones. Possessing the dharma of sages, they are called Perfected Ones. Possessing concentration and wisdom, they are called Perfected Ones. Possessing the seven true treasures—faith, dharma, shame, dread, extensive learning, wisdom, and renunciation—they are called Perfected Ones. For these reasons, it is also called true practice.

Furthermore, good man, the true practice of the Perfected One and Daoist masters is to observe that this body is impure, a temporary aggregation of causes and conditions. How does it arise, sit, stand, walk, bend, stretch, look, blink, breathe, weep, laugh, or rejoice? There is no master within—who causes it to be thus? Having asked this question, all the immortals in the assembly suddenly vanished.

The Perfected One further reflected: "Perhaps consciousness is the self, and thus the sages do not act on my behalf." Yet upon observing this consciousness, he saw it arise and cease in succession, like flowing water—this too was not the self.

He then thought: "If consciousness does not exist, perhaps the exhalation and inhalation of breath could be the self." But again he considered: "Exhalation and inhalation are merely the nature of wind, and wind is but one of the Four Great Elements. Among the Four Great Elements, which is truly real? The nature of earth is not real; the natures of water, fire, and wind are likewise unreal."

He further reflected: "This body in its entirety possesses no true reality. Only the mind and wind, through the convergence of causes and conditions, manifest in various forms. All its activities are like illusions conjured by spells, or like the sound of a bell, resonating as the mind wills. Thus, this body is impure, a mingled aggregation of causes and conditions—where in it could desire arise? If reviled, where in it could anger take root?

This body of mine, with its hundred impure apertures and six foul sense faculties—where in it could endure the reviler’s words? Upon hearing insults, one should contemplate: by what sound is one reviled? No single sound can constitute an insult; if one alone cannot, then many are likewise powerless. For what reason, then, should anger arise?

If another’s touch provokes, one should likewise reflect: from what does such contact arise? One then realizes: it arises from the mind’s action, which in turn affects this body—thus it is called ‘touch.’ Why should I unjustly resent another? It is this body itself that incurs the fault, for it is through the five aggregates that I experience it.

Just as a target gives rise to arrows, so too does this body. With body comes contact; if I cannot endure it, the mind becomes scattered. When the mind is scattered, right mindfulness is lost. Losing right mindfulness, one cannot discern what is real and what is not. Unable to discern reality, one commits evil deeds. Through the causes of evil deeds, one falls into the three evil destinies and the ten hells of unwholesome realms.

Having thus observed, the Perfected One attained the Four Foundations of Mindfulness. Having attained them, he could abide in the realm of forbearance. The Perfected One and Daoist master, dwelling in this realm, could endure desire and anger, as well as cold and heat, hunger and thirst, all manner of painful contacts, various diseases and epidemics, harsh words and curses, whippings and beatings, and all afflictions of body and mind—this is what it means to abide in the realm of forbearance.

The Perfected One Yuan Yang, Xianzhi, addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: "Daoist masters who have not yet attained the unshakable realm, while purely upholding the precepts, may under certain conditions commit transgressions against the Dharma."

"Good man," replied the Perfected One, "those who have not yet attained the unshakable realm may, under certain conditions, transgress the Dharma."

The Perfected One said: "Indeed."

"Heavenly Worthy, what are these conditions?"

The Heavenly Worthy told the Perfected One Xianzhi: "If a Perfected One or Daoist master knows the conditions for transgressing the Dharma, he can thereby enable others to receive, uphold, and delight in the Yuan Yang scriptures. He can also enable them to receive, uphold, recite, and master the words and phrases, to copy the scriptures, and to expound them widely to others. With unwavering resolve, he guides them toward the supreme, correct, and natural Great Dao. For this reason, transgression of the Dharma is permissible."

At that time, the Perfected One should reflect thus: "I would rather fall into the dark sand hells and endure suffering than allow this person to regress from the supreme, correct, and natural Great Dao."

Then, the Perfected Ones Yuan Yang, Xianfu, Zilin, and others addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: "If a Perfected One gathers and protects such a person, ensuring their unwavering resolve in the natural mind, it would be impossible for this to constitute a transgression of the Dharma or lead to a fall into the dark sand hells."

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy praised the Perfected One Xianzhi, saying: "Excellent! Excellent! As you have said, I recall that in the past, in the Jambudvīpa realm, I was a great king named Shoujian. I cherished and revered the Yuan Yang scriptures with a pure and virtuous heart, free from defilements such as jealousy, stinginess, and greed. My speech was always gentle, and my mind constantly protected the poor and orphaned. I practiced generosity and diligence without rest.

At a time when no sages existed in the world, I delighted in the supreme Mahāyāna scriptures of the Yuan Yang. For nine years, I served Daoist masters as my teachers, providing for all their needs. After nine years, having completed my offerings, I said: 'Masters, you should now arouse the mind for the supreme, correct, and natural Dharma.'

The Daoist masters replied: 'Great King, the nature of the natural is non-existent; the teachings of the Yuan Yang are likewise so. Great King, how can you wish to make others equal to emptiness?'

Good man, at that time, my delight in the wondrous Yuan Yang scriptures and my reverent recitation of them brought forth immeasurable merit.

Furthermore, good man, those who cultivate the sagely practice should know that conditioned dharmas involve two aspects: cause and effect. Unconditioned dharmas also involve two aspects: cause and effect. The effect of conditioned dharmas is called suffering; the cause of conditioned dharmas is called accumulation. The effect of unconditioned dharmas is called cessation; the cause of unconditioned dharmas is called the Dharma.

Moreover, good man, the Perfected One and Daoist master experience eight kinds of suffering: birth, aging, sickness, death, love, aversion, separation, and parting. That which gives rise to these eight sufferings is called accumulation. Where these eight do not exist is called cessation.

Good man, birth has five manifestations: first emergence, reaching completion, growth, emergence from the womb, and birth by kind. What is aging?"

Old age has two kinds: first, moment-to-moment aging; second, lifelong aging. Furthermore, there are two other kinds: first, aging through growth; second, aging through decay and dissolution. These are called old age.

For what reason is it called sickness? It is like venomous snakes within the body, each finding no comfort in the other. For this reason, there are also two kinds of sickness: first, bodily sickness; second, sickness of the mind.

Bodily sickness has five types. What are the five? First, sickness caused by water; second, sickness caused by wind; third, sickness caused by heat; fourth, sickness caused by mixed malign influences; fifth, sickness from external factors as guest afflictions.

Among these guest afflictions, there are four further kinds: first, sickness from forced actions against one’s will; second, sickness from forgetfulness or accidental falls; third, sickness from weapons, tiles, or stones; fourth, sickness from possession by demons or malevolent spirits.

Among sicknesses of the mind, there are also four kinds: first, the mind leaping with perverse excitement; second, the mind generating terror; third, the mind filled with sorrow; fourth, the mind’s nature being foolish and deluded.

Moreover, good man, the sicknesses of the mind and nature of Perfected Ones and Daoist masters have three further kinds. For what reason are they called three? First, the body and mind commit offenses and receive karmic retribution; second, one fails to distance oneself from all evil adversities and offenses; third, the four seasons alternate and decline. For these reasons, they are called discriminating sicknesses. All sicknesses are named as such when the mind and intent become confused and disordered. This is called sickness.

What is death? Death is the abandonment of the body one has received. The abandonment of the received body has two distinctions: first, death when lifespan is exhausted; second, death from contingent causes.

Death when lifespan is exhausted has two further conditions: first, lifespan is exhausted but merit is not; second, merit is exhausted but lifespan is not.

Death from contingent causes has two further meanings. What are the two meanings? First, self-inflicted death beyond one’s allotted portion; second, death from being harmed by others.

There are also three kinds of death: first, death from dissipation; second, death from destroying the Dharma; third, death from ruining life.

What is death from dissipation? If one slanders the supreme Mahāyāna scriptures of the Primordial Yang, this is called death from dissipation.

What is death from destroying the Dharma? Slandering the laws and precepts established by all the sages of the past, future, and present is called death from destroying the Dharma.

What is death from ruining life? Abandoning the five aggregates is called death from ruining life. Such deaths are called great suffering.

What is the suffering of separation from the beloved? The beloved objects are destroyed and scattered. This suffering of separation has two distinctions. What are the two? First, the intermediate state in the human realm; second, the intermediate state in the heavenly realm. The intermediate states experienced by humans and gods have countless varieties when differentiated and enumerated. This is called the suffering of love.

What is the suffering of encountering the despised? The accumulations have three kinds: first, hell; second, hungry ghosts; third, animals. These three destinies, when differentiated in number, are countless. Such is called the suffering of encountering the despised.

What is the suffering of not obtaining what is sought? There are two kinds: first, having aspirations but finding them difficult to attain; second, expending much effort yet gaining no merit. Such matters are called the suffering of not obtaining what is sought.

What is the suffering of the five aggregates? The suffering of the five aggregates comprises birth, old age, sickness, death, love, aversion, separation, and parting—these are the roots of affliction.

Good man, you should know that among the eight sufferings, the body is the greatest affliction. If one can blunt sharp desires, restrain emotions, and single-mindedly cultivate and venerate the supreme Mahāyāna scriptures of the Primordial Yang, one may escape these eight afflictions and the eight kinds of suffering and sorrow.

At that time, the Primordial Celestial Venerable addressed the Worthy and Wise Perfected One, saying: "All ordinary beings, with inverted and deluded minds, cling to the appearance of birth and detest separation from old age and sickness. I am not like this. Observing the moment of birth, I already see the afflictions of sickness.

Perfected One, there was once a woman named Good Faith who entered the house of a elder in the world of Pulin. This woman was upright, her countenance beautiful, adorned in worldly brocades, patterned silks, and fine garments. The elder, upon seeing her, immediately asked: 'What is your name? From where have you come?'"

The woman replied, "I am the great wealth-master of merit in this present world."

The elder asked, "What benefit do you bring to the places you visit?"

The woman said, "Wherever I go, I generate all manner of sweet fruits and delicacies, gold, silver, copper, iron, brocades, patterned silks, cattle, horses, carriages, male and female servants, and young attendants."

Upon hearing this, the elder rejoiced in his heart: "By past karmic conditions, I have encountered a good spiritual friend, for great benefit!" He then paid reverent homage, burned incense, scattered flowers, and bowed with utmost sincerity, wishing for compassion.

At that moment, outside the gate stood another woman, her form hideous, her garments foul and filthy. Seeing her, the elder asked, "Where do you come from?"

The woman replied, "I am called Black Karma."

The elder said, "For what reason are you called Black Karma?"

The woman answered, "Wherever I travel, I cause the decline and depletion of that household’s wealth."

Hearing this, the elder immediately took up a sharp blade and chased her away, saying, "If you linger, I will take your life."

Black Karma replied, "Do not be foolish, devoid of good heart."

The elder asked, "Why do you call me foolish, devoid of good heart?"

Black Karma answered, "The woman in your house named Good Faith is my elder sister. We always travel together. If you chase me away, you must also drive out my sister."

The elder returned inside and asked Good Faith, "Is the woman outside your younger sister?"

Good Faith replied, "She is indeed my sister. We sisters travel everywhere together, never parting, wherever we tread. I always do good, while she always does evil; I perform good karma, while she performs evil karma. Since you love me, you must also show compassion to her."

The elder replied, "If this is so, I want neither of you." He then hastily drove them away, urging them not to delay.

The two women then departed and returned to their dwelling. At that time, the elder’s heart was filled with joy, his delight boundless.

The two women then went together to a poor household. Seeing them, the poor man’s heart leapt with joy, and he invited them, saying, "From now on, may the two of you always stay in my home."

The women replied, "We have already been driven away by others. Why do you now wish to keep us both here?"

The poor man answered, "You think of me, and I think of you. That is why I invite you both to stay in my home."

Worthy and Wise Perfected One, it is likewise with you: you do not wish to be born in heaven, for birth entails old age, sickness, and death. Thus, you abandon both, having no attachment.

Ordinary beings, unaware of old age, sickness, and death, constantly cling to and crave the dual karma of birth and death.

Furthermore, Perfected One and Daoist, suppose a youth of wondrous wisdom, pressed by hunger, sees fruits in filth and excrement and immediately takes them. A wise person, seeing this, rebukes him: "You, a youth of wondrous wisdom, of pure and noble nature—why do you take these fruits from filth?"

Hearing this, the youth of wondrous wisdom felt deep shame and replied, "I do not truly intend to eat them. I only wished to wash them clean and then discard them."

The wise person said, "You are greatly foolish and benighted. If you discard them, you should not have taken them in the first place."

Good son, Perfected One and Daoist, it is likewise with you: in this life, you neither take nor discard, just as the wise person rebuked the youth of wondrous wisdom.

Ordinary beings rejoice in birth and detest death, like that youth of wondrous wisdom who took the fruit only to discard it.

Furthermore, Worthy and Wise Perfected One, it is like a man at a crossroads who carries a vessel of fine food to sell. A traveler, weary and hungry from a long journey, sees the fine food and asks, "What is this?"

The food merchant replies, "This food is fragrant and delicious. If you eat it, it will relieve hunger and thirst, and you will behold the immortals. It has but one flaw: it brings the end of life."

Hearing this, the man thought, "I have no use for immortals, nor do I wish to die." He then said, "If eating this food will end my life, why do you sell it?"

The food merchant replied, "Those with wisdom will not buy it. Only the foolish, unaware of this matter, pay me much and greedily consume the food."

Perfected One and Daoist, it is likewise with you: you do not wish to be born in heaven, but only to escape affliction. Why is this?

For they cannot escape the manifold sufferings. Ordinary beings, wherever they are born, greedily cling to all sensations, for they do not see old age, sickness, and death.

Furthermore, good son, just as the sap of a poisonous tree’s root can kill a man, so too does the true person and Daoist, in the place of rebirth, receive the five thieving aggregates of form—all of which can kill. Furthermore, good son, just as excrement stinks whether much or little, so too is birth for the true person and Daoist: whether one lives a thousand years or as few as ten, suffering is inescapable.

Furthermore, wise and true person, it is like a perilous place where grass overhangs the bank, beneath which lies abundant sweet dew. If one eats it, one will live a thousand years, forever free from illness, secure and joyful. Ordinary beings, craving its taste, do not know that a deep pit lies below. They advance to take it, unaware, and fall into the pit, losing their lives. The wise, knowing this, abandon and keep far away.

The true person and Daoist are likewise: they do not even wish to receive the wondrous foods of the heavens, let alone those of the human realm. How could ordinary beings, who in hell gulp down molten iron, refrain from eating the fine delicacies of humans and gods? Through such parables—and countless others beyond measure—the true person and Daoist come to know that birth is great suffering.

The true person and Daoist, called the sage, abide in the Primordial Yang World, reciting the profound and subtle scriptures of the Great Vehicle, contemplating the suffering of birth.

How does the sage in the Primordial Yang World contemplate the suffering of old age? It brings coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath; it steals the vigor of memory, the strength of youth, and the freedom of joyful abandon. Then comes the suffering of old age: flesh and skin wither, the body grows foul and stinking, and one is despised by others.

True person and Daoist, it is like a lotus in a pond, radiant in color, fresh and fragrant, beloved—until suddenly hail falls, and all at once it is scattered and ruined. Old age is likewise: it utterly destroys the beauty and strength of youth.

Furthermore, wise and true person, it is like a kingdom with a loyal minister, skilled in warfare. When another kingdom resists and refuses to submit to the king’s authority, the king sends the loyal minister to subdue it. He captures and binds the rebels and brings them before the king. Old age is likewise: it seizes the strength and beauty of youth and delivers them to the king.

Furthermore, good son, it is like a broken wheel, no longer of any use. The approach of old age is the same.

Furthermore, good son, it is like a great wealthy household, abundant in treasures, clothing, and bedding. Bandits break in, plunder the family’s wealth, and leave it utterly empty. The prime of youth and beauty is likewise: it is constantly plundered by the thief of old age.

Furthermore, good son, it is like a poor man who covets fine clothing but, though he longs for it, cannot obtain it. Old age is likewise: though one may still crave wealth and pleasure, one cannot attain them.

Furthermore, good son, it is like a land tortoise longing for water. The true person and Daoist, when dried up by the thief of decay, likewise long for the wealth and pleasures of their youth.

Furthermore, true person and Daoist, it is like the lotuses of autumn, once beloved, which wither and fade, so that people no longer wish to see them. The beauty and strength of youth are likewise: once cherished, when old age arrives, they are despised and scorned.

Furthermore, true person and Daoist, it is like sugarcane: once pressed, it loses its sweetness. The beauty of youth is likewise: once crushed by the thief of old age, it loses the flavor of the Dao, the taste of diligent study and recitation in renunciation.

Furthermore, good son, it is like the full moon in its brightest splendor, which yet does not shine by day. Old age is likewise: in youth, one is upright, one’s appearance fresh and pure; in old age, one becomes gaunt, one’s countenance withered and emaciated.

Furthermore, good son, it is like a king who rules his kingdom with true Dharma, governing the people without injustice. When enemy kingdoms invade, he is driven into exile, fleeing far into foreign lands. The people of those lands, seeing him, pity him and say, “Great king, you once ruled with true Dharma and did not oppress your subjects. How is it that in a single day you have been driven into exile, reduced to this?” A person is likewise: once ravaged by old age, they constantly recall the deeds of their youth.

Furthermore, good son, it is like a lamp’s wick, which depends entirely on oil. When the oil is exhausted, the flame cannot last long. Old age is likewise: it depends on the brightness of oil, but when the oil is gone, how can the wick of decay remain bright?

Furthermore, true person and Daoist, it is like a dried-up pond, which can no longer nourish people, non-humans, birds, or beasts. Old age is likewise: dried up by decay, it can no longer benefit the activities of life.

Furthermore, true person and Daoist, it is like a tree on a riverbank at the edge of a cliff. If a strong wind blows, it will surely fall. Old age is likewise: at the perilous bank of old age, a gust of wind arises, and the momentum of a lifetime cannot hold it back.

Furthermore, true person and Daoist, it is like a cart without wheels, unfit for carrying loads. Old age is likewise: it cannot receive the natural Dharma.

Furthermore, true person and Daoist, it is like an infant, despised by others. Old age is likewise: it is constantly scorned and belittled by all things.

Through these causes and parables—and countless others beyond measure and conception—such is the suffering of old age, truly a great affliction.

Noble son, this is called the true person and Daoist cultivating the *Primordial Yang Supreme Great Vehicle Scripture*, contemplating the suffering of old age.

At that time, the wise and virtuous true person asked: How does the noble son cultivate the *Primordial Yang Supreme Great Vehicle Wondrous Scripture*, contemplating the suffering of illness?

It is said that all illnesses can destroy every joyful affair, just as hail ruins the sprouts and grain, damaging the harvest. Furthermore, true person and Daoist, it is like a person with a grudge, constantly sorrowful and perpetually fearful. Noble son, all sentient beings and ordinary people are likewise: they are ever anxious about the suffering of illness, their hearts filled with sorrow.

Furthermore, true person and Daoist, it is like a person of upright appearance, favored by the king’s consort, desired and summoned by her messenger to consort with her. When the king learns of this, he gouges out one of the person’s eyes, cuts off one ear, severs one hand, and hacks off one foot. At that time, the person’s form and bearing are altered, and they are scorned by others. Noble son, illness is likewise: though one was once upright with all six senses intact, once afflicted by the suffering of illness, one is despised in the hearts of others.

Furthermore, true person and Daoist, it is like the plantain and the mule that bear offspring, only to be pressed by death. Noble son, illness is likewise: where there is illness, there is death.

Furthermore, true person and Daoist, it is like the Wheel-Turning King, whose generals and ministers always lead the way, with the king following behind; or like the four kinds of animal kings, with merchants leading the way, and all others following without exception. Noble son, the death Wheel-Turning King is likewise: he always has ministers of illness who do not abandon him, and the four kinds of merchants are likewise, perpetually pursued by the hosts of death.

True person and Daoist, the causes and conditions of illness are such: sorrow, fear, anxiety, and dread for body and mind; or being harassed by the enmity of thieves, shattering the floating gourd, piercing the ladder and steps, able to deceive and seize the root of right mindfulness, and to destroy beauty and angry countenance, scorching the body and damaging the skin. From these and other parables, know that the suffering of illness is a great thief.

Noble son, this is called the true person and Daoist who can practice the *Primordial Yang Great Vehicle Subtle and Wondrous Scripture*, contemplating the suffering of illness.

At that time, the wise and virtuous true person asked: How does the noble son cultivate and recite the *Primordial Yang Supreme Great Vehicle Scripture*, contemplating the suffering of death?

It is said that the suffering of death can destroy all things. True person and Daoist, it is like the arising of the kalpa fire, which can burn everything. Noble son, the fire of death is likewise: it can burn everything, except for the true person and Daoist abiding in the Primordial Yang world, for the power of the Heavenly Worthy does not reach them.

Furthermore, true person and Daoist, it is like the arising of a flood, which sweeps everything away, except for the three immortals, for its power does not reach them. Noble son, the water of death is likewise: it sweeps everything away, except for the true person abiding in the Primordial Yang realm of the Great Vehicle world.

Furthermore, true person and Daoist, it is like the arising of a wind disaster, which can shake and destroy all things, except for the four immortals, for its power does not reach them. Noble son, when the wind of death arrives, it can blow away all that exists, except for the true person and Daoist abiding in the Primordial Yang realm of the Great Vehicle world.

The wise and virtuous true person addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: By what cause and condition are the four immortals not consumed by fire, not drowned by water, and not shaken by wind?

The Heavenly Worthy replied to the wise and virtuous true person: The power of the four immortals lies in their being free from all faults. Noble son, the first immortal’s fault lies in internal observation, while externally there is the fire disaster; the second immortal’s fault lies in internal joy, while externally there is the water disaster; the third immortal’s fault lies in internal panting, while externally there is the wind disaster. Noble son, those four immortals have no leaks in their internal and external faults, and thus the disasters cannot reach them.

Noble son, the true person and Daoist are likewise: abiding in the Primordial Yang realm of the Great Vehicle world, they have completely eliminated all internal and external faults, and thus death cannot reach them.

Furthermore, true person and Daoist, it is like the golden-winged bird that can devour and digest all birds, fish, gold, silver, and other things, except for the vajra, which it cannot swallow. True person and Daoist, the golden-winged bird of death is likewise: it can devour all sentient beings, except it cannot consume the true person and Daoist abiding in the Primordial Yang realm of the Great Vehicle world.

Furthermore, wise and virtuous true person, it is like the trees on a perilous bank, all swept away by the rising floodwaters and carried into the great sea, except for the willow tree, because it is supple. Noble son, all sentient beings are likewise: they all flow into the sea of death, except for the true person and Daoist abiding in the Primordial Yang realm of the Great Vehicle world.

Furthermore, wise and virtuous true person, it is like the celestial warrior who can subdue all demons and ghosts, except for the great wind. Why? Because it is unimpeded. Noble son, the celestial warrior of death is likewise: it can subdue all ordinary sentient beings, except for the true person and Daoist abiding in the Primordial Yang realm of the Great Vehicle world. For what reason? Because they are unimpeded.

Furthermore, wise and virtuous true person, there are those who, amidst enmity and hatred, falsely feign kindness and constantly follow their foe, like an echo following sound, awaiting an opportunity to kill them. Yet the enemy remains vigilant, steadfast in self-defense, thus preventing harm. Noble son, the enmity of death is likewise: it lies in wait for all ordinary sentient beings, seeking to kill them, yet it cannot slay the true person and Daoist abiding in the Primordial Yang realm of the Great Vehicle world. Why? Because such true persons do not wander in heedlessness.

Furthermore, wise and virtuous true person, it is like a sudden torrential rain that destroys mountains, forests, trees, earth, stones, and gravel—all things—yet cannot harm the vajra jewel. Noble son, the vajra of death is likewise: it can annihilate all ordinary sentient beings, except for the vajra-like true person and Daoist abiding in the Primordial Yang realm of the Great Vehicle world.

Furthermore, wise and virtuous true person, it is like the golden-winged bird that can spy dragons and fish yet cannot devour the masters of the Three Caverns. Noble son, the golden-winged bird of death is likewise: it can consume countless sentient beings, all living creatures, except for the true person and Daoist who abide in the Three Caverns. What are the Three Caverns? They are the marks of emptiness and nothingness.

Furthermore, wise and virtuous true person, it is like a venomous serpent that releases its poison to sting a person. Though there may be potent incantations and worldly herbs, none can counter it—only the sacred ambrosial medicine of a sage can neutralize its venom. Noble son, the harm of death’s poison is likewise: all remedies are powerless against it, except for the true person abiding in the Primordial Yang realm of the Great Vehicle world.

Furthermore, wise and virtuous true person, it is like a man who has incurred the wrath of an official. If he humbles himself with soft words, offers apologies, and repays with treasures, he may yet escape. Noble son, the coercion of the official of death is not so: though one may offer soft words and treasures, death cannot be evaded. Noble son, death is this: in perilous and desolate places, without sustenance, far from others and without companions, the heart is filled with affliction, not knowing where to turn. It is deep, dark, and lightless, entering without a door yet having a place, though wracked with pain, it cannot be healed. There is no barrier to halt it; once gone, there is no return, and nothing is destroyed. Those who witness it grieve, though it is not an evil sight, it inspires terror. It spreads upon the body, yet cannot be perceived. Wise and virtuous true person, know that these similes describe death as the greatest suffering.

Moreover, wise one, this is how the true person and Daoist cultivate the supreme scriptures of the Primordial Yang Great Vehicle, contemplating the suffering of death. Then the wise and virtuous true person asked: How does the true person and Daoist, in cultivating the supreme scriptures of the Primordial Yang Great Vehicle, regard the suffering of parting from love? For it is the root of all suffering for ordinary beings. From this arises sorrow, and from sorrow, sentient beings grow old. The suffering of parting from love is the end of life. Noble son, through separation, all manner of suffering arises, and all manner of subtle afflictions. Now I shall explain each in detail.

Noble son, in a past age, human lifespans were long. After immeasurable kalpas, there was a king named Receptive Vision. When he was still a crown prince and later ascended the throne, his lifespan was forty thousand years. Upon the king’s head grew a fleshy topknot, soft as fine cotton, gradually growing without causing distress. After a full year, the topknot opened, and a boy was born, his form and countenance unmatched in the world, his beauty and bearing peerless among men. The king rejoiced and named him Adorned. King Receptive Vision then entrusted the affairs of state to him.

Adorned abandoned the kingdom’s treasures, his wives, children, and retinue, and entered the wondrous Joyous Mountain in the Pulin world to study the supreme scriptures of the Primordial Yang Great Vehicle. After a thousand years, Adorned, in the space of a month, stood upon a high terrace, bathed, donned his crown and robes, and received the precepts. Then, from the eastern direction, in the Land of Great Blessing of the Nasana world, a golden wheel-treasure chariot appeared, its hub and axle complete, naturally resplendent without need of craftsmanship, coming to him in response. King Adorned thought: *In a past kalpa, I heard a sage of the six penetrations say that if a universal monarch, in the space of a month, stands upon a high terrace, bathes, and receives the precepts, and if a golden wheel-treasure chariot, its hub and axle complete, naturally resplendent without craftsmanship, comes in response, then that king shall become a sage emperor of humans and gods.*

He then thought: *I shall test this.* Taking the wheel-treasure in his left hand and a censer in his right, he knelt, bowed in reverence, and made this vow: *If this wheel-treasure is true and not false, may it follow the path of the sage emperors of humans and gods of the past.* Having made this vow, the wheel-treasure soared into the sky, filling the ten directions, then returned to rest in Adorned’s left hand. Overjoyed, Adorned exclaimed: *Now I shall surely become a sage emperor of humans and gods.*

Soon after, a golden treasure appeared, its form majestic, like the petals of a lotus, its seven branches resting upon the earth. Seeing this, Adorned thought: *In a past kalpa, I heard a sage of the six penetrations say that if a sage emperor of humans and gods, in the space of a month, stands upon a high terrace, bathes, and receives the precepts, and if a golden elephant, its form majestic like the petals of a lotus, its seven branches resting upon the earth, comes in response, then that king is indeed a sage emperor of humans and gods.*

Again he thought: *Now I shall put this to the test.* Holding an incense burner in his left hand, he knelt on his right knee and made this vow: *If this golden treasure-elephant is true and not false, let it follow the Way as the sage emperors of humans and gods did in the past.*

Having made this vow, the golden treasure-elephant, from dawn until dusk, traversed the ten directions, reaching even the farthest shores of the great ocean, before returning to its original place. Then King Adorned, his heart filled with joy, leapt with boundless delight and declared: *Now I am surely a sage emperor of humans and gods.*

Soon after, a silver treasure-horse appeared, its form majestic, its mane and tail golden. Seeing this, Adorned thought: *In the past, I heard a sage of the six penetrations say that if a sage emperor of humans and gods, within a month, stands upon a high terrace, bathes, and receives the precepts, and if a silver treasure-horse, its color resplendent, its mane and tail golden, comes in response, then that king is indeed a sage emperor.*

Again he thought: *Now I shall put this to the test.* Holding an incense burner, he knelt in reverence and made this vow: *If this treasure-horse is true and not false, let it follow the Way as the sage emperors of humans and gods did in the past.*

Having made this vow, the treasure-horse galloped from dawn until dusk, traversing the ten directions, reaching even the farthest shores of the great ocean, before returning to its original place. Then Adorned, his heart leaping with joy, was filled with boundless delight and declared: *Now I am surely a sage emperor of humans and gods.*

Soon after, a woman of exquisite beauty appeared, her bearing radiant as jade, her countenance unmatched. From every pore of her body emanated rare fragrances; her breath was pure and sweet. Her eyes could see for ten *yojanas*, her ears, nose, and mind were keen and wise, and she possessed great wisdom. To all beings, she spoke gentle words. When her hand touched the king’s robe, she knew whether his future would be peaceful or troubled, and she discerned the thoughts of his heart.

Then Adorned thought: *If a woman can know the king’s heart, she is indeed the treasure of women.*

Soon after, within the king’s palace, a precious jewel appeared of its own accord—a great luminous pearl that could illuminate an entire world in darkness. If demon-kings or evil spirits sought to disturb the world’s ordinary beings, this pearl’s light would reveal them, and the demons could not draw near.

Then Adorned thought: *If a sage emperor of humans and gods obtains this treasure-pearl, he is surely a sage emperor.*

Soon after, a wise minister of the treasury appeared spontaneously, increasing the store of treasures until the royal vaults were filled to abundance, with nothing lacking. His eyes could perceive all hidden treasures throughout the ten directions of the world, and whatever the king desired would appear at the thought of it.

Then Adorned wished to test him. Boarding a ship, he sailed upon the great ocean and said to the treasury minister: *Now I shall follow you into the sea. Whatever I seek, I wish to obtain precious treasures.* Hearing the king’s words, the minister stirred the seawater with his hand, and from his fingertips emerged treasures, which he offered to the sage king, saying: *Great king, whatever you desire, I shall provide according to your will.*

Then Adorned, his heart filled with great joy, thought: *Now I am surely a sage emperor of humans and gods.*

Soon after, a minister of military wisdom appeared, a natural counselor, foremost in courage and strength, unmatched in wisdom. Skilled in strategy and well-versed in military arts, he could subdue any unruly kingdom and defend those already subdued.

Then Adorned thought: *If a sage emperor of humans and gods has such a minister to guard him, he is indeed a sage emperor.*

Then Adorned, the sage emperor of humans and gods, addressed his ministers and counselors: *Know this: in this Jambudvīpa world, peace and blessed happiness are now mine. My treasures are complete, and I lack nothing.*

The ministers replied: *The great world of the Eastern Hall of Fortune has not yet submitted to your virtue. Let the great king go personally to teach and transform that land.*

Then the sage king Adorned, taking with him the seven treasures, rare objects, and his retinue, went to that land. The people rejoiced and all submitted to his rule. Again he addressed his ministers: *Now my kingdom is at peace, my people prosperous, the seven treasures abundant, and my ministers and subjects complete. What more is there to do?*

The ministers replied: *The flourishing world of the West has not yet submitted.*

Then the sage king Adorned, again taking the seven treasures, rare objects, and his retinue, went to that land. The people rejoiced and all submitted. Again he addressed his ministers: *Now my kingdom is at peace, my people prosperous, the seven treasures abundant, and my ministers and subjects complete. What more is there to do?*

The ministers replied: *The pure world of the North has not yet submitted to your rule.*

Then the sage king Adorned, again taking the seven treasures, rare objects, and his retinue, went to that land. The people rejoiced and all submitted. Again he addressed his ministers: *Now my kingdom is at peace, my people prosperous, the seven treasures abundant, and my ministers and subjects complete. What more is there to do?*

The ministers replied: *The world of the Southern Abandoned Worthies has not yet submitted to your transformation.*

Then the sage king Adorned, again taking the seven treasures, rare objects, and his retinue, went to that land. The people rejoiced and all submitted. Again he addressed his ministers: *Now my kingdom is at peace, my people prosperous, the seven treasures abundant, and my ministers and subjects complete. What more is there to do?*

The ministers replied: *The Thirty-Two Heavens enjoy long life, peace, and bliss. Their celestial forms are majestic and unmatched, their dwellings adorned with precious treasures. Relying on their blessed happiness, they have not yet come to submit. Now you should go and make them submit.*

Then the sage king Adorned, again taking the seven treasures, rare objects, and his retinue, soared through the empty sky and ascended to the world of the Thirty-Two Heavens. There he saw a tree with lush branches and leaves, its fruits abundant. The sage king, upon seeing it, asked the Heavenly Lord, Divine Treasure Heavenly King: *What kind of tree is this?*

The Divine Treasure Heavenly King replied: *This is called the Qian Tree. The gods and immortals of the heavens gather beneath it in all seasons and months, delighting in joy and pleasure.*

Again, he saw clouds of a hue like purple qi and asked the Divine Treasure Heavenly King: *What is that color?*

He replied: *That is the Hall of Good Fortune. The celestial immortals and sages constantly gather there to discuss the affairs of humans and heavens.*

Thereupon, the Divine Treasure Heavenly King, recognizing the great power and virtue of King Adorned, ascended with him to the Hall of Good Fortune, where they sat upon separate seats. At that time, the two kings’ forms and appearances were equal, without difference.

Then the sage king thought to himself: *If I were to yield my throne to him and remain here, would I become the Heavenly King?*

O perfected ones and Daoists, at that time the Divine Treasure Heavenly King, through reciting and upholding the supreme, subtle scriptures of Primordial Yang, mastered their profound meanings and expounded their causes and conditions for others with great eloquence. By virtue of this recitation and teaching, he possessed great power and virtue.

Good son, King Adorned, harboring ill will toward the Divine Treasure Heavenly King, immediately fell from the heavens and returned to the world of Jambudvīpa. There, separated from what he loved and cherished, he was overcome by great suffering and affliction. Stricken by grave illness, he soon died.

At that time, the Most High Lord of the Dao declared: *I am that sage king of humans and heavens.*

Good son, know that the suffering of separation from what one loves is an extreme affliction.

Good son, if even perfected ones recall such past events—the suffering of separation from love—how much more should perfected ones dwelling in the land of Primordial Yang, the Mahāyāna world, observe the suffering of separation in the present age?

Good son, how do perfected ones and Daoists, cultivating the supreme Mahāyāna scriptures of Primordial Yang, contemplate the suffering of meeting what one hates?

Good son, these perfected ones and Daoists observe that in the heavens, the human realm, hells, the animal realm, and the realm of hungry ghosts, all beings experience the suffering of meeting what they hate—just as one might observe prisoners bound in shackles and fetters, weighed down by sorrow and suffering. So too do perfected ones and Daoists observe that all beings in the six destinies are bound in the meeting of hatred, enduring great suffering.

Furthermore, good son, it is like one who constantly fears an enemy and abandons parents, wife, children, property, and possessions to flee far away.

Good son, so too do perfected ones and Daoists, fearing the cycle of birth and death, cultivate the six perfections in full, seeking the supreme fruit of the Dao.

Good son, this is how perfected ones and Daoists, cultivating the supreme Mahāyāna scriptures of Primordial Yang, contemplate the suffering of meeting what one hates.

Good son, how do perfected ones cultivate the supreme Mahāyāna scriptures of Primordial Yang to contemplate the suffering of not obtaining what one seeks?

All beings seek without obtaining. This "seeking without obtaining" has two meanings: first, seeking wholesome dharmas without success; second, seeking unwholesome dharmas without fulfillment. Failing to escape the suffering of evil dharmas—this is a brief explanation of the intense suffering of the five aggregates.

Good son, this is what perfected ones and Daoists call the suffering of not obtaining what one seeks.

Then the wise and virtuous perfected one addressed the Heavenly Worthy: *As the Heavenly Worthy has said, the intense suffering of the five aggregates is not so. Why? As the Heavenly Worthy once told Fuzi Yuan: If form were suffering, ordinary beings would not seek it; if they did seek it, how could it be called suffering?*

As the Heavenly Worthy taught the Daoists: *There is suffering in sensation, joy in sensation, and neither suffering nor joy in sensation.*

As the Heavenly Worthy previously explained to the Daoist women, good sons, and good daughters: *One who cultivates wholesome dharmas attains joy.*

And as the Heavenly Worthy said: *In the path of goodness, the six defilements bring joy. The eye delights in forms—this is joy; the ear delights in sounds—this is joy; the nose delights in fragrances—this is joy; the tongue delights in flavors—this is joy; the body delights in smoothness—this is joy; the mind delights in glory—this is joy. The six senses’ delight in pleasant dharmas is all suffering.*

Then the Heavenly Worthy spoke this verse:

*Upholding precepts brings joy,
the body free from manifold suffering.
Reciting the Primordial Yang scriptures,
one enters the gate of immortality.
Hearing the scriptures, the suffering of meeting hatred
is cured as illness vanishes.
Cherishing the Dharma, love is like a floating gourd—
demons and ghosts cannot corrupt it.
Expounding the teachings, one becomes a sage king,
a compassionate father through causes and conditions.
Beware of harboring evil thoughts,
for evil topples even heavenly lords.
If one pities all beings,
using the Dharma as pillar and beam,
day and night ever reverent,
one may escape the Three Bureaus’ judgment.
Perfected ones and Daoists,
strike the Dharma drum with devotion.
Awakening to the six destinies,
ever keep the Dharma as your companion.
The Mahāyāna is the world,
heavenly realms its pure land.
All roots of sin are exhausted,
all by my rule and measure.*

When the Heavenly Worthy had finished speaking this verse, the meaning of these matters was as expounded in the scriptures. The wise and virtuous perfected ones, having heard this teaching, understood it clearly, bowed in reverence, and withdrew.

Thus concludes the first scroll of *The Supreme Numinous Treasure Scripture of Primordial Yang*.

Then the Most High Jade Clarity Heavenly Worthy addressed the Primordial Yang Settled Light Perfected One, saying: I observe all dharmas to be impermanent, their natures and characteristics unfixed. Any dharma arising from causes is thereby impermanent. All these immortals possess nothing that does not arise from conditions.

Good man, the nature of the Dao is neither hidden nor manifest, neither generated nor extinguished, neither departing nor arriving. It is not present, not future, not past; it is not produced by causes nor born of conditions. Therefore it is called eternal.

Good man, the nature of the Dao is the Heavenly Worthy; the Heavenly Worthy is the Dharma; the Dharma is the eternal. Good man, the eternal is the Heavenly Worthy; the Heavenly Worthy is the Perfected One; the Perfected One is the eternal; the nature of the Dao is the eternal. For this reason, dharmas arising from causes are not called eternal. Among the lesser immortals, nothing exists that does not arise from causes.

Good man, these lesser immortals do not perceive the nature of the Dao, the wondrous Dharma of the Heavenly Worthy. Therefore, all that lesser immortals discuss is delusion, devoid of truth. All beings first see clothing, bedding, carriages, elephants, horses, cities, and villages; later, seeing similar things, they claim these are eternal. Know that in truth they are not eternal!

Good man, all conditioned dharmas are impermanent. The unconditioned void is therefore eternal. The nature of the Dao is unconditioned, therefore eternal. The void is the nature of the Dao; the nature of the Dao is the Heavenly Worthy; the Heavenly Worthy is the unconditioned; the unconditioned is eternal bliss; eternal bliss is the Dharma; the Dharma is the unconditioned; the unconditioned is eternal bliss.

Good man, conditioned dharmas are of two kinds: first, form-dharmas; second, non-form-dharmas. Non-form-dharmas are mind and mental factors; form-dharmas are earth, water, fire, and wind.

Good man, mind is called impermanent. Why? Its nature is that of grasping and conditioning, requiring differentiation. Good man, the nature of eye-consciousness differs, even to the nature of mind-consciousness differing—therefore it is impermanent. Good man, the realm of form differs, even to the realm of dharmas differing—therefore it is impermanent. Good man, the correspondence of the eye-faculty differs, even to the correspondence of the mind-faculty and consciousness differing—therefore it is impermanent.

Good man, if mind were eternal, the eye-faculty would cognize all dharmas alone. Good man, if the eye-faculty’s cognition differs from the mind-faculty’s cognition, know that it is impermanent. Through the similarity of dharmas, arising and ceasing moment to moment, the common person, seeing this, calculates it as eternal.

Good man, all conditioned phenomena are destructible, hence also called impermanent. That is to say, eye-consciousness arises from the causes of eye, form, light, clarity, and contemplation. When ear-consciousness arises, its causes differ, not those of eye-consciousness. Even to mind-consciousness, it is likewise.

Furthermore, Settled Light Perfected One, good men who harbor conditioned actions—mind is therefore called impermanent. That is to say, the mind cultivating impermanence differs; the mind cultivating suffering, emptiness, and non-self differs. If mind were eternal, it would constantly cultivate impermanence, yet still not perceive suffering, emptiness, and non-self—how much less would it perceive the bliss of true eternity! For this reason, the teachings of lesser immortals cannot encompass the bliss of true eternity.

Good man, know that the mind-dharma is certainly impermanent. Furthermore, good man, the nature of mind differs, hence it is called impermanent. That is to say, those of perverse views and doubts have minds of differing natures: they do not believe in the true Dharma, do not revere true Perfected Ones, do not honor those with the Dao, and harbor evil thoughts.

Good man, know that the function of mind has three kinds: first, the mind of one who has left the household; second, the mind of one who remains in the household; third, the mind of one who has departed from the household in violation. The mind corresponding to joy differs; the mind corresponding to suffering differs; the mind corresponding to neither suffering nor joy differs; the mind corresponding to greed differs; the mind corresponding to anger differs; the mind corresponding to delusion differs; the mind corresponding to all perverse views and demonic influences also differs.

That is to say, the mind corresponding to delusion differs; the mind corresponding to doubt differs; the mind corresponding to perverse views differs. In movement and stillness, action and conduct, the mind also differs. Good man, if mind were truly eternal, it could not differentiate various forms—such as dark and light, vermilion and purple, red and white.

Good man, if mind were eternal, it would not forget the dharmas it recalls. Good man, if mind were eternal, what one studies and recites would not increase. Furthermore, good man, if mind were eternal, one would not speak of what has been done and what is being done. If there is what has been done and what is being done, know that this mind is certainly impermanent.

Good man, if mind were eternal, there would be no enmity or kinship, neither enmity nor kinship. If mind were true, one would not speak of "my things" and "others' things," of arising and ceasing. If mind were true, though it had done something, it would not endure. Good man, for this reason, know that the nature of mind differs in each case. Because of these differences, know that there is no truth.

Good man, I have now expounded the absence of truth in non-form-dharmas, and its meaning is manifest. I shall further explain to you the absence of truth in form. Form is without truth, originally without arising; once arisen, it ceases—hence know it is without truth. The ignorant common person calculates it as true. For this reason, it is called without truth. If without truth, it is without suffering; if without suffering, it is not impure.

Good man, in the primordial movement of the Dao, I first inquired into this matter and thereby attained clear understanding.

Furthermore, good man, all dharmas are without self. In all matters—whether form or non-form—form is not the self. Why? Because it can be destroyed, extinguished, broken, or damaged, and because it arises and grows. The self, however, cannot be destroyed, extinguished, broken, or damaged, nor can it grow. For this reason, know that form is not the self. Non-form dharmas are also not the self. Why? Because they arise from conditions.

Good man, if those of perverse views, through single-minded concentration, know there is a self, the nature of single-minded concentration is not truly the self. If single-minded concentration were the self, its nature—being a past phenomenon—would entail forgetfulness. Since there is forgetfulness, know decisively that there is no self.

Good man, if those of perverse views, through recollection, know there is a self, then without recollection, know decisively that there is no self. As when one sees a person with six fingers and asks, "Where did I first meet you?" If there were a self, one would not need to ask. Because one asks, know decisively that there is no self.

Good man, if those of perverse views, through negation, know there is a self—good man, because there is negation, know decisively that there is no self. As when one says "child," it is the same with me. If it were truly the self, it would never be negated. Because it is negated, know decisively that there is no self. If negation were the means to know there is a self, then when you do not negate, there should decisively be no self.

Good man, if those of perverse views, through companionship or lack thereof, know there is a self, then because there is no companion, there should be no self. The dharma without companionship is called the Heavenly Venerable; the empty and void nature of the Dao is also thus—truly without companionship. For this reason, know decisively that there is no self.

Furthermore, good man, if those of perverse views, through the fixation of names, know there is a self, then in the dharma without self, there is also the name of self—like a poor and lowly person named "Noble and Wealthy." As when one says, "I die," if there were a self, it would kill me, yet the self cannot truly be killed; it is only nominally said to be killed. It is also like a seated person called a "great elder." For this reason, know decisively that there is no self.

Furthermore, good man, if those of perverse views, through a newborn seeking milk, know there is a self—good man, if there were a self, no infant would grasp impurity. For this reason, know decisively that there is no self.

Furthermore, good man, all beings possess equal wisdom in three matters: sexual misconduct, eating, and fear. Therefore, there is no self.

If those of perverse views, through appearance, know there is a self, then because of appearance there is no self, and because of no appearance there is also no self. When a person sleeps, they cannot move forward or stop, look up or down, see or blink, nor know suffering or joy—there should be no self. If through moving forward or stopping, looking up or down, seeing or blinking, one knows there is a self, then wooden puppets should also have a self.

Good man, neither moving nor stopping, neither looking up nor down, neither seeing nor blinking, neither suffering nor joy, neither greed nor anger, neither delusion nor action—such is the true Dao. The true self exists thus. If beings of perverse views, upon seeing others eat fruit, inevitably feel envy in their mouths, and thereby know there is a self—good man, because of recollection, seeing gives rise to envy. Envy is not the self, nor is the self envy; it is neither joy nor pleasure. For this reason, know decisively that there is no self.

Good man, such beings are as ignorant as infants. They lack wisdom and skillful means, unable to comprehend the constant and the inconstant, suffering and non-suffering, joy and non-joy, purity and impurity, self and no-self, lifespan and non-lifespan, beings and non-beings. In the dharma of the Dao, they grasp a small, illusory portion and calculate it as true and constant joy, yet truly do not know true and constant joy.

Like a person born blind who does not recognize the color of milk and asks another, "What is the color of milk like?" The other replies, "The color of milk is as white as a shell." The blind person asks again, "Is the color of milk like the sound of a shell?" The reply is, "No." The blind person asks further, "What is a shell like?" The reply is, "Like the taste of rice." The blind person asks again, "Is the color of milk as soft as the taste of rice? And what is the taste of rice like?" The reply is, "Like snow." The blind person asks again, "Is the taste of rice as cold as snow? And what is snow like?" The reply is, "Like a white crane." Though the blind person hears such analogies, they ultimately cannot recognize the true color of milk.

Such are beings of perverse views—they ultimately cannot recognize true and constant joy. For this reason, in my dharma of the Dao, there is the meaning of true constancy, not in perverse views.

Then the Perfected One, Radiant Light, addressed the Heavenly Venerable, saying: "Rare is the Great Master, who in the present and past turns the unsurpassed Dharma-wheel, making such distinctions."

The True and Constant Heavenly Venerable said to the Perfected One, Radiant Light: "Why do you now conceive of the Great Master as past? Good man, the Great Master is truly constant, unchanging and not passing away. If one calculates a self, this dharma becomes the supreme, correct, and true Great Dao.

I am the dharma, the dharma is my body;
I am the Dao, the Dao is my body;
I am the Great Master, the Great Master is my body;
I am the true immortal, the true immortal is my body.

I can expound the dharma, causing others to listen and receive; I turn the Dharma-wheel, which others cannot. The Great Master never makes such calculations, therefore the Great Master does not turn the Dharma-wheel."

If one entertains such deluded calculations as "I am the eye, the eye is me," the same applies to body, mouth, intent, ear, and nose. "I am form, form is my body," and so on up to the true Dharma, all follow this pattern. "I am earth, earth is my body," and likewise for water, fire, and wind.

If one claims, "I am speech, speech is my body; I am erudition, erudition is my body; I am generosity, generosity is my body; I am discipline, discipline is my body; I am forbearance, forbearance is my body; I am stillness, stillness is my body; I am diligence, diligence is my body; I am wisdom, wisdom is my body; I am the six recollections, the six recollections are my body"—the four right exertions, the four bases of miraculous power, the five pure mental states, and the eightfold noble path all follow this pattern.

Good man, the Great Master never makes such calculations, therefore the Great Master does not turn the Dharma-wheel. If one speaks of constancy, without change or alteration, how can it be said that the Great Master turns the Dharma-wheel? Thus, you should not now declare that the Great Master is turning the supreme Dharma-wheel.

Good man, it is like the eye depending on form, light, and contemplation; when conditions converge, visual consciousness arises. The eye does not think, "I generate consciousness," nor does contemplation think, "I produce visual consciousness," nor does it think, "I generate myself." Such phenomena, when conditions converge, are called "seeing."

Good man, the Heavenly Venerable is likewise: through the six perfections and the sevenfold Dharma, comprehending all phenomena, and further through the throat, lips, teeth, tongue, speech, and sound, the teaching begins—this is called "turning the Dharma-wheel." For this reason, the Heavenly Venerable is not said to turn the Dharma-wheel.

Good man, if there is no turning, this is called the Dharma; the Dharma is the Great Master.

Good man, it is like fire arising from the fire-drill, the hand, and dry grass: the drill does not say, "I generate fire," nor do the hand or grass say, "I generate fire," nor does the fire say, "I generate myself." The Heavenly Venerable is likewise: through the six perfections, up to being called "turning the Dharma-wheel," the Heavenly Venerable does not think, "I turn the Dharma-wheel."

Good man, if there is no such thought, this is called "turning the true Dharma-wheel"; this turning of the Dharma-wheel is the Heavenly Venerable, the Great Master.

Good man, it is like butter being churned from curds, water, the churn, the vessel, the rope, and human effort: the curds do not think, "I produce butter," nor do the water, churn, vessel, rope, or hand think, "I produce butter," nor does the butter say, "I generate myself." When conditions converge, butter is produced. The Heavenly Venerable is likewise, never thinking, "I turn the Dharma-wheel."

Good man, if there is no production, this is called "turning the true Dharma-wheel"; this turning of the Dharma-wheel is the Heavenly Venerable.

Good man, it is like a sprout arising from a seed, earth, water, fire, wind, fertile soil, season, and human labor: the seed does not say, "I generate the sprout," nor do the earth, water, fire, wind, soil, season, or labor say, "I generate the sprout," nor does the sprout say, "I generate myself." The Heavenly Venerable is likewise, never thinking, "I turn the Dharma-wheel."

Good man, if there is no such action, this is called "turning the Dharma-wheel"; this turning of the Dharma-wheel is the Heavenly Venerable.

Good man, it is like sound arising from a drum, space, skin, and human effort; when conditions converge, sound is produced. The drum does not think, "I produce sound," nor do the other conditions, nor does the sound say, "I generate myself." The Heavenly Venerable is likewise, never thinking, "I turn the Dharma-wheel."

Good man, one who turns the Dharma-wheel is called "one who does not act"; this is the Heavenly Venerable.

Good man, one who turns the Dharma-wheel is the Great Master of all immortals, a realm beyond the comprehension of disciples.

Good man, empty space is neither generated nor produced, neither created nor made, nor is it a conditioned phenomenon. The Heavenly Venerable is likewise: neither generated nor produced, neither created nor made, nor a conditioned phenomenon. The nature of the Great Master and the nature of the Dao are also thus: neither generated nor produced, neither created nor made, nor conditioned phenomena.

Good man, the teachings of the Great Masters of the immortals have two meanings: one is worldly speech, the other is transcendent speech. The Heavenly Venerable speaks worldly language to disciples and transcendent language to perfected ones.

Good man, among this great assembly, there are two kinds: those who seek the lesser vehicle and those who seek the greater vehicle. In the past, in the Primordial Yang World, I turned the Dharma-wheel for the immortal disciples; now, for the first time in the City of Ambrosia, I turn the great Dharma-wheel for the perfected ones.

Furthermore, good man, there are two types of people: those of middling roots and those of superior roots. For those of middling roots, I turned the Dharma-wheel in the Primordial Yang World; for those of superior roots, such as the Dharma King, Radiant Light, and others, I now turn the great Dharma-wheel in the City of Ambrosia, widely raising the banner of the Dharma for those of great faculties.

Good man, for those of the lowest roots, the Heavenly Venerable never turns the Dharma-wheel. Those of the lowest roots are the deluded followers of demons.

Furthermore, good man, those who seek the supreme Dao are of two kinds: one is single-minded in diligence, the other is supremely mindful in diligence. In the *Primordial Yang Sutra*, for those most diligent, I turn the Dharma-wheel.

Now in this city, for those supremely mindful in diligence, I turn the great Dharma-wheel.

Furthermore, good man, in the past, when I first turned the Dharma-wheel in that City of Ambrosia, eighty thousand perfected beings attained the natural fruit of the Dao. Now in this city, eighty thousand myriads of koṭis of people, their minds unwavering, all attain purity in the true and correct Dao.

Furthermore, good man, in the City of Ambrosia, Primordial Yang Perfected One bowed his head and entreated me to turn the Dharma-wheel. Now in this city, Radiant Light Perfected One bows his head and entreats me to turn the Dharma-wheel again.

Furthermore, good man, in the past when I turned the Dharma-wheel in that City of Ambrosia, I expounded on impermanence, suffering, emptiness, permanence, and bliss. Now in this city, when I turn the Dharma-wheel, I truly expound on the bliss of the everlasting.

Furthermore, good man, in the past when I turned the Dharma-wheel in that City of Ambrosia, the sound of my voice reached the Heavenly Venerables above in the Great Luo Heaven. Now again in this city, when I turn the Dharma-wheel, the sound of my voice pervades all the lands of the Empty Song Realm, the Nine Heavens, and the Ganges Worlds—east, west, south, north, the four intermediate directions, above, and below, all are likewise filled.

Good man, whatever the heavenly perfected beings say is all called turning the Dharma-wheel. Good man, it is like a king who is haughty and does not generate faith and reverence; those not yet subdued, he is able to subdue

The Dao can divide one body into many bodies at will, and then merge many bodies back into one, yet without attachment to such transformations, like a precious flower.

Good man, when perfected beings and Daoists attain entry into this true Dao, the Dharma King, they abide in the realm of freedom. Dwelling in this realm of freedom, they gain the power of autonomy, and wherever they wish to be born, they are born accordingly.

Good man, it is like a sagely king who rules the four heavens and goes wherever he pleases without obstruction. Perfected beings and Daoists are likewise: in all places of rebirth, if they wish to be born there, they go as they will.

Good man, if perfected beings and Daoists see beings in hell who can be taught and guided to dwell in wholesome roots, the perfected ones will immediately be born among them. Though they are born there, it is not due to their own karmic retribution; rather, dwelling in the realm of freedom, they are born there for karmic conditions’ sake.

Good man, though perfected beings and Daoists enter hell, they do not suffer its torments.

Good man, the wholesome roots that perfected beings and Daoists accomplish are boundless and immeasurable, beyond reckoning even by the Ganges’ sands. How much more so are the inconceivable merit, virtue, and power of the Heavenly Venerable’s majestic deeds and fields of blessing?

At that time, among the assembly was a perfected one named Worthy Wisdom, possessed of great majesty and virtue, accomplished in spiritual penetrations, master of the Great Total Retention, perfect in dharma marks, and fearless. Rising from his seat, he came forward, made obeisance, knelt with joined palms, and said: “As the Heavenly Venerable has expounded, the merit and wisdom accomplished by perfected beings and Daoists are boundless and immeasurable, beyond hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis, truly beyond expression. Yet in my mind, I still think they do not compare to the *Primordial Yang Scripture*.

Why? Because it is by the power of this *Primordial Yang Mahāyāna Sūtra* that all the Heavenly Venerables’ supreme, correct, and true Great Dao is brought forth.”

Then the Heavenly Venerable praised him, saying: “Profound indeed! Inconceivable! Good man, it is just as you say. Though these scriptures of the great sages are replete with boundless merit and virtue, to compare them to this sūtra would be no comparison at all—hundredfold, thousandfold, boundless and immeasurable, beyond the sands of the Ganges, beyond all analogy.

Good man, it is like milk drawn from a cow, from which curds are made; from curds comes butter; from butter, the sweet and exquisite flavor of ghee. Whoever partakes of it is cured of all illnesses, and all medicines are subsumed within it.

Good man, the Heavenly Venerable is likewise: from the Heavenly Venerable comes the wondrous *Primordial Yang Sūtra*; from the *Primordial Yang Sūtra* comes the Great Dao Dharma; from the Great Dao Dharma comes the Dharma of diligence; from the Dharma of diligence comes the Dharma of forbearance and precepts; from forbearance and precepts comes the natural Dao fruit. The natural Dao fruit is the sweet and exquisite flavor of the Dharma. What is called the sweet and exquisite flavor of the Dharma is an analogy for the Dao-nature. The Dao-nature is the Heavenly Venerable.

Good man, for this reason it is said that the Heavenly Venerable’s wholesome roots are beyond reckoning, like the sands of the Ganges.”

Worthy Wisdom Perfected One said to the Heavenly Venerable: “As the Heavenly Venerable has said, the *Primordial Yang Sūtra* is like the sweet and exquisite flavor of the Dharma, most wondrous. If ordinary beings partake of it, their illnesses are cured of themselves, and all medicines are subsumed within it. Having heard this, I privately reflect: if there are those who cannot listen to and receive this sūtra, they must be greatly foolish, devoid of wholesome minds.

Heavenly Venerable, from this day forth, I will wholeheartedly transcribe this *Primordial Yang Sūtra*, receive, uphold, read, and recite it, ensuring its profound benefit. Thereafter, I will widely expound its meaning to others.

Heavenly Venerable, if there are beings attached to wealth and possessions, I will first offer them wealth, then urge them to read this *Primordial Yang Sūtra*. If they are noble and esteemed, I will first speak gently, aligning with their minds, then gradually urge them to read this *Primordial Yang Sūtra*. If they are ordinary and foolish, I will compel them with authority to read it. If they are arrogant and haughty, I will serve them as a servant, aligning with their minds to bring them joy, then teach them with the *Primordial Yang Sūtra*. If there are those who slander the Mahāyāna sūtras, I will subdue them with power, and once subdued, urge them to read and recite the *Primordial Yang Sūtra*. If there are those who delight in the true Dao sūtras, I will personally go to them with reverence, make offerings, honor them, and snap my fingers in praise.

Then the Heavenly Venerable praised Worthy Wisdom Perfected One, saying: “Excellent, excellent! You now cherish and long for the true Dao scriptures, delight in and believe in the true Dao scriptures, receive, uphold, make offerings to, and bow in worship to them.

Good man, by this wholesome mind and karmic condition, you will transcend boundless and immeasurable realms, beyond the sands of the Ganges. You will accomplish the supreme, correct, true, and natural fruit of the perfected being and Daoist, and before long, you too will be like me. You will widely expound this *Primordial Yang Sūtra*, the Heavenly Venerable’s secret treasury, to the great assembly.

Good man, even before the Heavenly Venerable of the past appeared, I was then practicing diligence, cultivating the Heavenly King, and perfecting the practices of the perfected ones. I was able to comprehend all the scriptures and treatises of the immortals. I practiced the true and constant conduct, was replete in majestic deportment, my mind pure, untainted by heterodox views. I was able to be born wherever desire arose, extinguishing the fires of anger and delusion. I received and upheld the bliss of karmic merit and the true and constant. I sought throughout the Great Vehicle’s wondrous scriptures, yet never even heard the name of the *Primordial Yang Sūtra*.

At that time, I dwelt on the Mountain of Wondrous Bliss. That mountain was pure, with flowing springs, ponds, and pools. Trees bore sweet fruits, filling the land in abundance. Among the cliffs and rocks flowed clear streams. Many fragrant flowers covered the entire region. Birds and beasts, wondrous and rare, could not all be named. Sweet fruits flourished, and myriad fragrances filled the air. There were also boundless fragrant roots.”

At that time, I dwelt alone amidst these surroundings, subsisting only on fruits and fragrant roots. After eating, I struck my breast and reflected upon the practices of diligence, endurance, and forbearance. For countless ages, I never even heard the name of the Heavenly Worthy’s most wondrous scriptures.

Good man, as I cultivated such arduous practices, the gods and devas were greatly astonished. They gathered together and spoke to one another in verse:

*"The Heavenly Worthy expounds the supreme canon,
Unfolding the Dao and revealing the primordial essence.
Proclaimed as the Father of all beings,
The King adorned with virtue and majesty.
Severing the paths of greed and delusion,
Dispelling the madness of ignorance.
On the pure and wondrous Mountain of Bliss,
A carefree realm of sweet dew."*

Then, among the assembly, a Heavenly King named Universal Wisdom spoke in verse:

*"Among all such perfected ones,
You are foremost in purity.
Profoundly understanding the Great Vehicle’s meaning,
Deeply comprehending the secret and mysterious.
If one seeks the supreme Way,
One must abandon mental indolence,
Realize the practices of suffering and emptiness,
And forever be free from the illness of afflictions."*

Thereupon, another immortal, named Radiant Stillness, spoke in verse:

*"The supreme Dharma’s essence is profound and wondrous,
Its quiescent principle difficult to fathom.
Unless one possesses the power of total retention,
Who could grasp the rites of the Primordial Beginning?
Now that we have heard this teaching,
We may establish a noble standard,
Sever all evil karma,
And freely enter and abide in the unconditioned."*

After these verses were spoken, the perfected ones and Heavenly Kings said: "We now praise and speak in verse, entreating the Heavenly Worthy on behalf of this worthy man and all beings—not for his own sake, but to benefit all ordinary beings—who cultivates myriad and boundless ascetic practices.

Such a person, perceiving the faults within birth and death, would not generate desire or delight even if rare treasures filled the earth, all mountains, and seas, regarding them as filth and excrement.

This worthy man, abandoning jewels and treasures, forsaking beloved wives and children, flesh and blood, marrow and brain, limbs and digits, dwellings and homes, cattle, horses, and carriages, does not even wish to be born in the heavens. He only wishes that all beings may attain joy, as I understand it.

Such a worthy man, pure and unstained, with all fetters forever extinguished, desires only to seek the supreme, correct, and true fruit of the natural Great Dao."

They further declared: "As you have said, this person is one who gathers beneath the Tree of the Way, able to eradicate afflictions and slander. If all beings abide in the cool shade of this Tree of the Way, all afflictions and karmic deeds will be extinguished. If in future worlds one becomes a Tathāgata, we shall all attain the extinction of boundless afflictions. Yet such matters are truly difficult to believe. Why is this so?"

All beings who arouse the natural intention of the Dao, upon perceiving the slightest conditions, immediately waver within their natural resolve—like the moon in water, which sways when the water moves. Just as a painted image is difficult to complete yet easy to ruin, so too is the natural intention of the Dao: difficult to arouse yet easy to destroy. For instance, when many men, clad in armor and helmets, prepare to march against bandits, if at the moment of battle their hearts fill with terror, they will turn and flee. All beings are likewise: though they arouse the natural intention of the Dao and fortify themselves, upon seeing the perils of birth and death, their hearts grow anxious and fearful, and they immediately retreat in regret. Having observed how all beings, after arousing such resolve, become unsettled, I now, though I see this man single-mindedly practicing austerities, free from affliction and vexation, abiding in the Dao with pure conduct, still cannot believe it. I must go myself to test him, to know whether he is truly capable of bearing the weighty eaves of the supreme, correct, and true fruit of the natural Great Dao. Just as a cart with two wheels can bear a load, or a bird with two wings can take flight, so too must one who practices austerities be thus. Though I see him steadfastly upholding the precepts, I do not yet know whether he possesses wisdom. If he has wisdom, then he will be able to bear the weight of the supreme, correct, and true fruit of the natural Dao. It is like a fish with many eggs—few come to maturity. Or like a fruit tree—many blossoms, few fruits. Though beings arouse the intention to seek the true and boundless, in the end, few are worthy of mention.

"True One, let us go together to test him, just as true gold is tested in three ways—by fire, hammering, and polishing—so too shall we test this ascetic. Then, O Primal Yang True One, you transformed your body into a fierce beast, terrifying in form, descending near the Mountain of Wondrous Joy, standing not far from him. At that time, the fierce beast, fearless and mighty, unmatched in eloquence, with a voice pure and refined, proclaimed the teachings once spoken by the Heavenly Venerable of the Past, reciting these verses:

*All conditioned things are non-action,
Such is the law of arising and ceasing.
The wheel of rebirth turns through causes and conditions,
Though cast aside, they reunite.*

*With focused mind, purify the three karmas,
The true Dao may be attained in due time,
To deliver the destitute from poverty.*

After reciting these verses, the beast stood before him in its fearsome form, glancing left and right, surveying the four directions. The ascetic, upon hearing these verses, rejoiced in his heart—like a traveler lost in perilous lands at night, separated from his companions, filled with dread and anxiety, who suddenly encounters a fellow wayfarer and rejoices immeasurably. Or like one long afflicted with illness who, without meeting a skilled physician, suddenly finds a wondrous medicine in an instant, his ailment cured, and his heart overflows with joy. Like a drowning man who finds a boat and crosses to the far shore, his heart filled with delight. Or like one parched with thirst who suddenly comes upon a sweet spring, drinking his fill and quenching his thirst, his heart rejoicing. Like one pursued by enemies who suddenly escapes, free from all afflictions, his heart filled with joy. Or like a prisoner led to the marketplace who suddenly hears a pardon and is set free, his heart rejoicing. Like a farmer suffering drought who suddenly receives rain, his seedlings growing, his grains ripening in abundance, his heart filled with joy. Or like one on a distant journey who suddenly returns home, his heart rejoicing.

"Good man, when I heard these verses at that time, my heart likewise rejoiced. I rose from my seat, looked in all four directions, and said: 'Who spoke the verses I just heard?' I looked around but saw nothing else—only the fierce beast. I then said: 'Who has opened this profound and wondrous gate? Who thunders with such subtle and marvelous sound? Who, in the slumber of birth and death, can yet awaken? Who can, in this place, guide the hungry beings of birth and death to the supreme flavor of the Dao? All beings are lost in the bitter sea of suffering—who can serve as the great helmsman within it? All beings are constantly entangled in the sickness of afflictions—who can be the skilled physician among them?'

After reciting these verses, they awakened my heart like the waxing moon gradually revealing its light. Good man, at that time, I saw nothing else—only the fierce beast. I thought: 'Could this beast have spoken these verses?' My heart grew doubtful, for it seemed unlikely. Why? Its form was so terrifying that had anyone heard these verses, all fear and ugliness would have vanished—how could such a creature bear this form? One who could speak such verses should not be like a night-glowing fungus sprouting in fire.

"Good man, I then thought: 'I lack wisdom, but perhaps this beast has encountered the immortals of the past and heard these verses from the Heavenly Venerable.' I decided to ask it and approached the beast, saying: 'Excellent! Excellent! Where did you encounter the verses spoken by the fearless one of the past? Where did you attain the meaning of these luminous jewel-verses? They are the true and correct Dao of the Primal Heavenly Venerable of the past, future, and present—boundless and immeasurable throughout all the worlds. Ordinary beings are forever shrouded in the net of doubt, and in their entire lives, they cannot hear such profound teachings as those spoken by the Heavenly Venerables of the ten directions.'"

"Good man, upon hearing this, I immediately replied, saying: 'Great true one, you should not ask me about this matter. Why? I have not eaten for many days, and despite searching in every way, I have found nothing. Hunger and suffering have confused my mind, and my words are deluded—not what my original heart truly knows. Though I now possess the power to fly through the void and seek food everywhere, I still cannot obtain it. For this reason, I spoke these words.'

Good man, I then said to the beast: 'If you can recite these verses in full for me, I will become your disciple for life. What you have spoken is neither complete in name nor exhaustive in meaning. For what reason do you refuse to recite them? Offerings of wealth and treasures may be exhausted, but the causes and conditions of Dharma-giving cannot be depleted. The gift of Dharma is inexhaustible and brings great benefit. Now that I have heard these verses, my heart is filled with doubt. If you would kindly dispel it for me by reciting them in full, I will become your disciple for life.'

The beast replied: 'Your wisdom exceeds all things, yet you care only for yourself and show no concern for my present state. Pressed by hunger and suffering, I truly cannot recite them.'

I then asked: 'What do you eat?'

The beast answered: 'You need not ask me. If I tell you, it will inspire terror.'

I replied: 'This place is perilous, and there is no one else here. I do not fear you. Why will you not speak?'

The beast answered: 'What I eat is only the warm flesh of humans, and what I drink is only their hot blood. My sustenance is human flesh alone. Though I search everywhere, I cannot obtain it. Most people in the world possess good fortune and are protected by the gods and benevolent spirits. Powerless, I cannot kill them.'

Good man, I then said to the beast: 'If you recite these verses in full, once I have heard them, I will offer this body of mine as an offering to you. Even if my life ends, this body of mine is of no use—it will only be devoured by vile insects and yield no merit. Now, in seeking the fruit of the supreme, correct, and true Great Dao, I abandon this impure body to exchange it for a pure one.'

The beast replied: 'Who would believe such words of yours—that for the sake of the true Dao, you would abandon your beloved body?'

Good man, I then answered: 'You are greatly lacking in wisdom. It is like someone who gives away a common vessel to obtain a true treasure. I, too, abandon this unworthy body to gain a steadfast one. As for your question of who would believe me, I now have witnesses: the countless Heavenly Kings all attest to this. Moreover, the true ones and Daoist masters with the Heavenly Eye, who cultivate and uphold the Mahāyāna scriptures for the benefit of all beings, and who possess the Four Immeasurables and the Six Perfections, can also bear witness. The Heavenly Venerables of the ten directions, who benefit all beings, can likewise confirm that I abandon this body for the true Dao.'

The beast then said: 'If you are truly able to abandon your life in this way, focus your mind attentively, and I will explain the verses for you in detail.'

Good man, upon hearing these words, my heart rejoiced. I immediately removed the clothes I was wearing and spread them out as a Dharma-seat for the beast, saying: 'True one, I pray you ascend this seat.'

I then knelt before it, joined my hands, and said: 'I only pray that the true one will expound the verses for me, that I may hear them in full.'

The beast then recited the verses:

*When arising and ceasing are extinguished,*
*Quiescent extinction is constant bliss.*
*Roaming the seven-jeweled terrace,*
*Wandering the fourfold luminous pavilion.*
*All defilements have been extinguished,*
*Pure and undefiled by evil.*
*Abandoning life to receive the true body,*
*Good causes without attachment.*

When the beast had finished reciting these verses, it said: 'Divine immortals and assembly, you have now heard the verses in full. Your wish is entirely fulfilled. If you truly seek to benefit all beings, you may offer me your body.'

At that time, I deeply pondered this meaning. Then, I wrote down the verses in various ways and tied them to my clothes, fearing that after death, my body would be exposed. I then climbed a great tree.

The tree spirit then asked me: 'Alas! What is the matter with you, good one?'

I answered: 'I wish to abandon my body in repayment for the verses.'

The spirit said: 'What benefit do these verses bring?'

I replied: 'These verses were expounded by the Primal Heavenly Venerable. For the sake of this Dharma, I abandon my life—not for fame, profit, or material gain, but only to benefit the countless ordinary beings.' Thus, I abandoned my body.

Good man, as I was about to abandon my body, I thought: 'May all miserly and greedy people see me relinquish this body. If there are those who cling to it, may they also see me abandon my life for a single verse, as if discarding filth.'

When I had spoken these words, I immediately cast aside my life and threw myself from the tree. Before I reached the ground, a hundred kinds of sounds arose in the empty sky.

At that moment, the beast also abandoned its body in midair, caught mine, and gently placed it on the ground. The Perfected of Primordial Yang, along with the assembly of divine immortals, bowed and paid homage before my seat, praising: 'Excellent! Truly wise and virtuous, you bring great benefit to all beings, desiring to kindle the great Dharma-fire within ignorance. For cherishing the wondrous Dharma of the Heavenly Venerable, you have endured such affliction. I only pray that the great virtue will permit me to repent and confess my transgressions. In the future, you will surely attain the natural fruit of the supreme, correct, and true Great Dao. May you be saved and delivered.'"

At that moment, the Perfected and the great assembly took their leave and suddenly vanished.

*The Upper Scripture of the Numinous Treasure’s Primordial Yang Wondrous Canon, Scroll Two concludes.*

*The Upper Scripture of the Numinous Treasure’s Primordial Yang Wondrous Canon, Scroll Three*
**The Chapter on Compassionate Conduct**

Then, the Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning addressed Wondrous Joy Perfected in the Nine-Bend Chamber of the Purple Tenuity Jeweled Palace, within the Golden Radiance Jade Hall of the Primordial Yang Realm: "You now cultivate compassion, joy, and loving-kindness in this land, abiding in the realm of cherishing love as one cherishes an only child."

Wondrous Joy Perfected bowed and paid homage, then addressed the Celestial Venerable: "By what cause and condition is this called the realm of cherishing love as one cherishes an only child?"

The Celestial Venerable replied: "Just as parents raise their child in peace and their hearts fill with joy. Good man, abiding in this realm is likewise: you regard all beings as sharing one ground. Seeing those who cultivate goodness, you feel great delight. Therefore, this realm is called *cherishing love*. Just as parents, seeing their child afflicted by illness, feel sorrow and distress yet never abandon them, good man, abiding in this realm is likewise: seeing all ordinary beings entangled by the sickness of afflictions, your heart fills with sorrow and compassion, as if blood flowed from every pore of your child. Thus, this realm is called *the realm of the only child*.

"Just as when a child is small, they pick up filth and place it in their mouth, and the parents, seeing this, feel dread and fear, anxious for harm to come, so they rinse with water and remove the filth. Good man, abiding in this realm is likewise: seeing all ordinary beings whose bodily, verbal, and mental actions are mostly unwholesome, the Perfected, seeing this, uses the hand of wisdom to pluck it out, pitying the ordinary beings, not wishing them to wander in birth and death and suffer afflictions. Thus, this realm is called *the only child*.

"Just as parents, thinking of their beloved child, suddenly encounter illness, and in an instant, the child perishes, the parents weep in grief, wishing to share the same fate. The Perfected likewise sees all beings falling into the three evil destinies and wishes to descend with them into hell. Why? When all beings suffer, if even for a single thought they generate the intention to repent, I then teach them the methods of cultivating goodness. In that single thought, they plant the roots of goodness. Thus, this realm is again called *the only child*.

"Just as parents who have only one child, whether walking, standing, or lying down, constantly cherish and think of them, and if the child commits faults, they speak with gentle words, skillfully comforting and guiding, never adding to their wrongdoing, the Perfected and Daoists likewise, seeing all ordinary beings falling into the three evil destinies, feel compassion and pity, never generating anger or adding harm to them. Thus, this realm is again called *the only child*."

Wondrous Joy Perfected addressed the Celestial Venerable: "As the Venerable has spoken, these words are profound and hidden. My wisdom is shallow—how can I comprehend them? If all Perfected abide in the realm of the only child and can do so, why did the Celestial Venerable, when formerly the King of Sweet Dew, practice the conduct of a Perfected yet sever the life of the Dharma Dragon Elder? If one attains this realm, one should generate a heart of love for ordinary beings. If one does not attain it, what cause and condition prevent falling into the three evil destinies? If one pities all beings, regarding them equally as an only child, with no partiality in the heart, how do these words not contradict in meaning?

"When the Celestial Venerable abides in the realm of emptiness and wishes to seek alms for food, you must observe people. If anyone harbors jealousy toward you, you do not proceed, even if extremely hungry. Why? The Perfected and Daoists constantly think thus: *I recall that in a past kalpa, at a field of merit, I generated a single evil thought. Due to this cause and condition, I fell into hell and suffered afflictions. Now, though I am extremely hungry, I will not beg for food, lest I cause them to doubt me and fall into hell, suffering afflictions.*

"Further, they think: *If any ordinary being doubts that I stand, I will sit upright all day. If any ordinary being doubts that I sit, I will stand all day without lying down.* Such is the heart of the Perfected and Daoists in protecting and thinking of beings—how much more so the great sage, spiritually penetrative! If one attains the realm of the only child, why would the Celestial Venerable utter such words, causing ordinary beings to generate grave evil?"

The Celestial Venerable addressed Wondrous Joy Perfected: "You should not pose such difficult questions. I create the causes and conditions of afflictions for ordinary beings. Even if I had the power to exhaust the waters of the sea, I would never become the root of afflictions for all ordinary beings. Even if heaven and earth were entirely transformed into non-form, water into solidity, fire into water, and wind into pouring, I would never become the root of afflictions for all ordinary beings. Even if one violated the four alliance prohibitions and a single ordinary being slandered the true Dharma, attaining the ten fearless powers of a sage in this very life, I would never become the root of afflictions for all ordinary beings. Even if the disciples of lesser immortals and a single heretic held unchanging views, I would never become the root of afflictions for all ordinary beings. Even if all Perfected violated the four alliance precepts and engaged in slandering the true and correct teaching, I would never become the root of afflictions for all ordinary beings. Even if all immeasurable beings severed their Dao-nature, I would never become the root of afflictions for all ordinary beings. Even if a thrown rope could bind the wind, and blowing fierce fires could burn stone mountains, I would never become the root of afflictions for all ordinary beings. I would rather dwell with venomous snakes and fierce tigers than utter words that make the sage the root of afflictions for all ordinary beings."

"Good son, the Heavenly Worthy truly can sever afflictions for all ordinary beings, and never becomes the root of afflictions for them.

Perfected One of Wondrous Joy, as you have said, in a past kalpa the Heavenly Worthy killed the Dharma Dragon Elder.

Good son, even the tiniest insects and ants I would not kill—how much less the Dharma Dragon Elder! He was a virtuous man, always employing skillful means to bestow blessings upon beings, granting them immeasurable lifespans. To give food is to give life. When Perfected Ones and Daoists practice generosity, they constantly bestow upon all beings immeasurable vital existence.

Good son, practicing the precept of non-killing leads to long life. When Perfected Ones and Daoists uphold the precepts, they thereby grant all ordinary beings immeasurable lifespans.

Good son, guarding the mouth from evil yields long life. When Perfected Ones and Daoists practice forbearance, they constantly exhort all ordinary beings not to harbor resentment, to ascribe rightness to others and faults to themselves, to be free from anger, and thus attain long life. Therefore, when Perfected Ones practice forbearance, they have already bestowed upon all ordinary beings immeasurable destinies.

Good son, single-mindedly cultivating goodness leads to long life. When Perfected Ones and Daoists practice diligence, they constantly exhort all ordinary beings to cultivate wholesome dharmas. When ordinary beings practice thus, they obtain long life. Therefore, when Perfected Ones and Daoists practice diligence, they have already bestowed upon all ordinary beings immeasurable destinies.

Good son, cultivating the dharma of collected mind leads to long life. When Perfected Ones and Daoists practice meditative concentration, they observe all ordinary beings cultivating the mind of equanimity. When ordinary beings practice thus, they obtain long life. Therefore, when Perfected Ones practice meditative concentration, they have already bestowed upon all ordinary beings immeasurable destinies.

Good son, not being heedless regarding all dharmas leads to long life. When Perfected Ones and Daoists cultivate wisdom, they exhort all ordinary beings not to be heedless regarding wholesome dharmas. When ordinary beings practice thus, by this cause and condition they obtain long life. Therefore, when Perfected Ones cultivate wisdom, they have already bestowed upon all ordinary beings immeasurable destinies.

Good son, for these reasons, Perfected Ones and Daoists never abandon any ordinary being.

Perfected One of Wondrous Joy, regarding your earlier question about the killing of the Dharma Dragon Elder—did he attain this state at that time?

Good son, at that time I had already attained loving-kindness, and thus severed his life-root, not out of malice. Good son, it is like parents who cherish their only child. If that child violates the law, the parents, out of fear, may either cast him out or kill him. Though they cast him out or kill him, they do so without malice. Perfected Ones and Daoists, in upholding the good Dao, are likewise.

If any ordinary being slanders the *Yuanyang Sutra*, they may be disciplined with whips and staves, or even have their life taken, in order to turn them from evil and cultivate the good Dao. The mind of the Perfected One constantly contemplates thus: By what means can ordinary beings be caused to generate wholesome minds? Whatever skillful means are necessary must be employed.

After the Dharma Dragon Elder’s life ended, he was born in the Northern Prison of Black Sand. There he had three thoughts: First, he wondered, ‘From where have I come?’ Immediately he became aware that he had come from the human realm. Second, he wondered, ‘Where am I now born?’ Immediately he became aware that he was in the Northern Prison of Black Sand. Third, he wondered, ‘By what karmic conditions have I come here?’ Immediately he became aware that it was due to slandering the *Yuanyang Sutra*, not believing in causes and conditions, and being killed by the king that he had come to be born here. Having realized this, he generated reverence for the *Yuanyang Sutra*. Soon after, his life ended, and he was born in a world of bliss and sovereignty, where he obtained a complete lifespan.

Good son, for these reasons, in a past kalpa I merely shared a lifespan with this person—how can this be called killing?

Good son, if a good person digs the earth, cuts grass, chops trees, severs a corpse, or utters curses and imprecations—by these causes and conditions, do they fall into hell?"

Perfected One of Wondrous Joy said to the Heavenly Worthy, "As I understand the meaning of the sagely teaching, they should fall into hell. Why? As the Heavenly Worthy once preached to those of heterodox views, ‘You, my disciples, must not harm grasses and trees without malice. Why? It leads to the evil destinies.’"

Then the Heavenly Worthy praised the Perfected One of Wondrous Joy: "Excellent! Excellent! As you have said, it should be well received and upheld.

Good son, if one falls into evil destinies due to malice, then Perfected Ones at that time were truly without malice. Why? Perfected Ones and Daoists, regarding all ordinary beings—even insects and ants—all generate minds of compassion and benefit. Why is this? Because they skillfully understand causes, conditions, and all expedient means. By the power of expedient means, they wish to lead all ordinary beings to perform meritorious deeds.

Good son, for these reasons, at that time, though I took his life, it was through skillful means and not out of malice.

Good son, if one kills insects and ants by the hundreds of millions, there is but slight karmic retribution. Tigers, wolves, poisonous snakes, mosquitoes, fleas, lice, bears, and wildcats—anything that harms all ordinary beings—if one severs their lives, there is but slight karmic retribution. If one kills a violent and harmful evil person, there is karmic retribution. If, after killing, one does not repent, one falls into the three evil destinies. If one can repent and confess openly, fasting for three days, the transgression is immediately extinguished, leaving no residue.

If one harms a good person, a virtuous and practicing Daoist, one’s parents, a woman, or a cow, one falls into hell for immeasurable kalpas."

Good son, the Realized Ones and I recognize three kinds of killing. What are these three? They are: the low, the middle, and the high.

The low refers to ants and all other animals, excepting only those in whom a Realized One manifests a birth. When a Realized One or Daoist, by the power of their vow, manifests as an animal, this is called low killing. Through the cause of low killing, one falls into the three evil destinies of hell, where all sufferings are fully endured. Why is this? Because these animals possess subtle roots of goodness, and thus the killer fully receives the karmic retribution. This is called low killing.

Middle killing refers to ordinary beings up to those in the initial stages of learning. This is called middle killing. Through this karmic cause, one falls into the three evils, fully enduring middle sufferings. This is called middle killing.

High killing refers to plotting against the ruler of a state, one’s parents, respected elders, Realized Ones, or good people. This is called high killing. Through this cause, one falls into the evil destinies of the three paths of hell, fully enduring the highest sufferings. This is called high killing.

If one kills those who commit the ten evils or the five heinous crimes, one does not fall into these three kinds of evil destinies. Good son, all such violent people are foolish, like digging the earth, cutting grass, chopping trees, scolding, or whipping—there is no karmic retribution. Killing a single violent and heinous person is likewise without karmic retribution. Why is this? Such violent and heinous ones lack faith and the like, and bring no benefit to beings. Thus, though one kills them, there is no karmic retribution.

Good son, you should not have asked why the Heavenly Worthy cursed and called the karma-receiving great adept a fool who eats spittle. Why is this? The words uttered by the Heavenly Worthy cannot be likened to anything.

Good son, there are those whose words are true and loved by others, yet spoken at the wrong time and contrary to the Dharma, bringing no benefit—such speech I ultimately do not believe. Good son, there are also those who utter harsh, perverse, flattering, or deceitful words, spoken at the wrong time and contrary to the Dharma, which are disliked by listeners and bring no benefit—I likewise do not believe them. Good son, if there are sounds, though harsh, that are true and without error, spoken at the right time and in accord with the Dharma, capable of benefiting all ordinary beings, even if they are not believed when heard, I must still speak them. Why is this? The Heavenly Worthy’s divine penetrations and wisdom power pervade all skillful means.

Good son, as I once traveled through mountains and forests, villages and towns, beneath a tree there was a great ghost named Jingchang, who fed solely on flesh and blood, killing many beings, and in his gathering, devoured one person each day. Good son, at that time, I expounded the marks of the Dharma to that great ghost, yet in his ignorance, he refused to accept the teachings. I then transformed my body into a mighty spirit, toppled his palace, and made it uninhabitable. The ghost, at that moment, led his retinue out of his palace, intending to resist and strike. When the great ghost saw me, he was seized by terror and confusion, collapsing to the ground like a dead man. With a mind of compassion, I stroked his body with my hand, and he immediately rose and sat up, saying: “Great indeed! Fortunate am I to have my life restored. This is the power of a great spirit, endowed with majestic dignity, a mind of mercy that pardons my offenses.” He then generated reverence and faith before me. I then resumed the form of the Heavenly Worthy and further expounded the true essential Dharma, causing that ghost and his spirits to receive the precept against killing. On that very day, in the village or town, there was an elder named Falong who was next to die, and his family had already delivered him to the ghost. The ghost, having received him, offered him to me. After accepting him, I gave the elder a new name, calling him Rushou.

At that time, the ghost addressed me, saying: “Now this retinue of mine relies solely on blood and flesh to sustain their lives. Having received the Dharma, how shall we provide for the Heavenly Worthy?” I replied: “From this day forward, have all perfected ones and Daoists, wherever they practice their methods and conduct their affairs, universally offer them food and drink.” Good son, for this reason, such a rule was established for all immortals and Daoists. From now on, you must always offer food to that ghost, Jingchang. If there are places where this is not done, know that those are not my disciples—they are companions of the heavenly demons.

Good son, the Heavenly Worthy demonstrates such skillful means to tame and subdue all ordinary beings, not intending to instill fear in them. Good son, I have struck guardian ghosts with wood, and at another time, pushed a great ghost’s body from a mountaintop, causing him to fall below, and also pierced the body of the Jianmao ghost with needles. Though I acted thus, I did not cause those ghosts and spirits to be destroyed; I merely wished to establish them in the true Dharma, demonstrating such skillful means.

Good son, in the past, I have never reviled those of perverse views or doubts with abusive words; nor have I been foolish, consuming others’ nasal mucus and spittle; nor have I been born in the evil destinies, the three woeful realms of hell, enduring manifold sufferings; nor have I slandered Daoists or learners of the Way; nor have I violated the four covenantal transgressions, slandering the primordial Yang true Dharma, the esoteric scriptures, nor am I one of those latecomers to learning; nor am I of the lesser immortals. Good son, the lesser immortals and late learners are not within the realm of perverse views or demonic influences—only the sages fully comprehend this.

Good son, therefore, you should not have asked why the Heavenly Worthy became angry and reproached the late-learning immortals. You should not harbor such doubts regarding the realms of all the heavens.

The Perfected One of Wondrous Joy addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: “It is like sugarcane—when chewed in the mouth, one obtains its sweetness. Likewise, from the assembly of sages, hearing the scriptures, I have gained the flavors of the Dharma: the flavor of the Dao, the flavor of the Dharma, the flavor of wisdom, the flavor of thorough understanding.”

“The Heavenly Worthy is like true gold: the more it is smelted and refined, the more its brilliance increases, becoming malleable and soft, its luster pure and fair, its value immeasurable—only then does it become a treasure for humans and gods. The Heavenly Worthy, the sage, is also thus: through earnest inquiry, one comes to understand the profound and subtle meanings, enabling one to receive and uphold them, awakening to the boundless.”

“When ordinary beings generate the natural intention of the Dao, they then become revered by all humans and gods.”

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy praised the Perfected One of Wondrous Joy, saying: “Excellent, excellent! Perfected ones and Daoists, for the sake of benefiting all ordinary beings, have thus inquired of the Heavenly Worthy regarding such wondrous Dharma. Good son, for this reason, in accordance with your wishes, I expound this primordial Yang, great vehicle, subtle and wondrous scripture—one that is compassionate, like the love for an only child.”

The Perfected One of Wondrous Joy addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: “If perfected ones and Daoists cultivate the minds of kindness, compassion, joy, and obtain the state of an only child, when they cultivate the mind of equanimity, what state do they then attain?”

The Heavenly Worthy said: “Good son, you know well the proper time, and when I have something to say, you then inquire. When perfected ones and Daoists cultivate the mind of equanimity, they abide in the Dharma-ground of the empty and equal. Good son, when perfected ones and Daoists abide in this empty and equal Dharma-ground, they do not perceive the six kinds of relatives or the center of enmity and hatred. Good son, just as empty space has no six kinds of relatives, nor even enmity and hatred, all dharmas are likewise without relatives. All the outflows—when perfected ones and Daoists see all dharmas—their minds are equal, like empty space.”

“Why is this so? Because they are skillfully able to contemplate and transcend all the Dharma-gates of emptiness.”

The Wondrous Joy Perfected One again addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: “What is called emptiness?”

The Heavenly Worthy replied: “Good son, this emptiness is what is called internal emptiness, external emptiness, emptiness of the unconditioned, emptiness of the conditioned, and all dharmas are entirely empty.

Good son, what is meant by contemplating internal emptiness? When perfected ones and Daoists contemplate the emptiness of internal dharmas, this emptiness of internal dharmas is without relatives or the center of enmity and hatred. The true and constant joy of the Heavenly Worthy’s Dharma-disciples, and all their possessions, exist within these internal dharmas. Though they possess the Dao-nature, this Dao-nature is neither internal nor external. Why is this so? The Dao-nature abides constantly, without change or movement. This is called the perfected ones and Daoists’ contemplation of internal emptiness. What is called external emptiness is likewise so. There being no internal dharmas, the emptiness of both internal and external is likewise so.

Good son, only the Heavenly Worthy’s Dharma-disciples’ Dao-nature does not reside within the two emptinesses of internal and external. Why is this so? Such dharmas as true and constant joy are the reason the Dao-Dharma is not called empty. This is called the emptiness of both internal and external.

Good son, what is the emptiness of the conditioned? All conditioned dharmas are entirely empty, namely the internal emptiness and external emptiness. Internal emptiness is true and constant joy. The Heavenly Worthy’s Dharma-disciples’ supreme emptiness of the ultimate meaning is the Middle Way-nature, not a conditioned dharma. Therefore, the Dao-nature is not the emptiness of conditioned dharmas.

Good son, how do perfected ones and Daoists contemplate the emptiness of the unconditioned? All unconditioned dharmas are entirely empty, namely impermanence, suffering, joy, non-self, the aggregates, realms, and entrances, the marks of sentient beings, and the outflows of the conditioned. Within internal dharmas, external dharmas, and unconditioned dharmas, there is one dharma that is equal, neither conditioned nor unconditioned, neither possessing the nature of the conditioned nor the nature of the unconditioned. This is called the constant abiding. Neither internal nor external, this is called the perfected ones’ contemplation of the emptiness of the unconditioned.

How do perfected ones and Daoists contemplate beginningless emptiness? These perfected ones and Daoists see that arising and ceasing are without beginning and are entirely empty and quiescent. What is called emptiness—true and constant joy—is entirely empty and quiescent, without change. The marks of sentient beings’ lives, the Dharma-nature of the Three Treasures, and the unconditioned dharmas—this is called the perfected ones’ contemplation of beginningless emptiness.

How do perfected ones contemplate the emptiness of dharmas? These perfected ones and Daoists contemplate all dharmas as empty in their original nature, namely the aggregates, realms, and entrances as constant or inconstant, suffering or non-suffering, joyful or non-joyful, pure or impure. Contemplating all such dharmas, they do not perceive their original nature. This is called the perfected ones and Daoists’ contemplation of the emptiness of nature.

How do perfected ones and Daoists contemplate the emptiness of non-possession? Just as a person without a child says their dwelling is empty, when they thoroughly contemplate emptiness, there is no attachment to love. Foolish people say the ten directions are all empty, and impoverished people say everything is empty. Such calculations may be empty or not empty. When perfected ones contemplate, like impoverished people, everything is empty. This is called the perfected ones and Daoists’ contemplation of the emptiness of non-possession.

How do perfected ones and Daoists contemplate all as empty within the supreme Dharma? Good son, when perfected ones and Daoists contemplate the supreme state, it arises from the eye, but from where does it come? And when it ceases, where does it go? Formerly non-existent, now existent; originally existent, now non-existent. Examining its true nature, there is no eye, no master. All dharmas are likewise so.

What is called the supreme meaning? Dharmas have karma and retribution, yet no agent is seen. Such empty dharmas are called the emptiness of the supreme Dharma. This is called the perfected ones and Daoists’ contemplation of the supreme Dharma’s emptiness.

How do perfected ones and Daoists contemplate the emptiness of emptiness? Emptiness within emptiness is where lesser immortals and disciples become deluded and lost. Good son, being and non-being—this is called emptiness; emptiness being affirmation and negation—this is called the emptiness of emptiness. Good son, even the perfected ones of the three times only partially comprehend this, like a mote of dust. Good son, such emptiness of dharmas is also not the same as the emptiness of emptiness attained by lesser immortals and disciples. This is called the perfected ones and Daoists’ contemplation of the Dharma of the emptiness of emptiness.

Good son, how do perfected ones and Daoists contemplate great emptiness? Good son, this great emptiness refers to the wisdom of the heavenly eye. This is called great emptiness. Good son, when perfected ones and Daoists attain such wondrous emptiness, they abide in the Dharma-ground of the empty and equal.

Now, as I broadly expound the meanings of all emptiness in this great assembly, there are measureless and boundless perfected ones and Daoists who immediately attain abiding in the Dharma-ground of the empty and equal. Good son, when perfected ones and Daoists abide in this ground, they are without obstruction, bondage, or attachment in all dharmas, and their minds are without confusion or distress. For this reason, it is called the Dharma-ground of emptiness.

Good son, just as empty space does not generate attachment in regard to lovable forms, nor joy or anger in regard to unloved forms, so too do perfected ones and Daoists abiding in this ground remain without attachment in regard to beautiful forms.

Good son, just as empty space is vast and can contain all things, so too do perfected ones and Daoists abiding in this ground. The vast empty space can contain all dharmas. For this reason, it is also called the Dharma-ground of emptiness.

Good son, when perfected ones and Daoists abide in this vast Dharma-ground of emptiness, they see and know all wondrous dharmas—whether practices or conditions, natures or marks, causes or effects, the minds of ordinary beings, roots or origins, good-knowing advisors, good conditions, good Dharma-precepts, good acts of giving, good regulations, and all such dharmas—they know and see them all.”

Good son, perfected ones and Daoists abiding in this ground know but do not see. What is meant by *knowing*? They know of self-mortifying practices—casting oneself into water or fire, falling into deep pits, standing on one leg for long periods, enduring the five fires or covering oneself with ashes, dwelling in filth among thorns, trees, noxious grasses, or cow dung, wearing coarse cloth, eating only vegetables and grasses, begging for food and limiting themselves to one household, departing if the host says there is none, and never turning back even if called again; they know of abstaining from meat and the five worldly flavors, and of all such practices that are entirely renounced. Yet there is no instance where these can become the cause of supreme liberation—this is called *knowing*. What is meant by *not seeing*? Perfected ones and Daoists do not see anyone who practices such methods attaining true liberation—this is called *not seeing*.

Good son, perfected ones and Daoists also know what constitutes *seeing*: they see that all ordinary beings who practice such perverse methods will surely fall into hell—this is called *seeing*. What is meant by *knowing*? They know that when ordinary beings are reborn from hell into the human realm, if they cultivate the practice of giving and fulfill all the diligent practices, they will certainly enter true liberation—this is called *knowing*.

Good son, perfected ones and Daoists also both see and know. What is meant by *seeing*? They see what is constant and what is inconstant, what is suffering and what is not, what is bliss and what is not, what is pure and what is not, what is self and what is not—this is called *seeing*. What is meant by *knowing*? They know that the realization of the noble ones is never ultimately extinguished; they know that the bodies of the noble ones are indestructible like vajra, not formed by defilements, nor are they foul, decaying bodies. They also know that all beings possess the nature of the Dao—this is called *knowing*.

Good son, perfected ones and Daoists also both know and see. What is meant by *knowing*? They know which beings seek the wondrous Dharma, who is flowing with the current, who is flowing against it, and who abides in the correct place; they know which beings have reached the other shore. Those flowing with the current are ordinary people. Those flowing against it range from those who have attained non-action to all the immortals. Those who abide correctly are perfected ones and Daoists who have reached the other shore—namely, the divine penetrations and wisdom-eye of the Heavenly Worthy, the Thus-Come One of universal knowledge—this is called *knowing*. What is meant by *seeing*? Perfected ones and Daoists, abiding in the Primordial Yang world and cultivating the wondrous practices of the Great Vehicle, with the pure heavenly eye of their wondrous practice, see all ordinary beings creating unwholesome karma through body, speech, and mind, and due to these three unvirtuous acts, falling into the dark prisons of hell; they see beings who cultivate wholesome karma, who at the end of life will be reborn in the heavens or among humans; they see ordinary beings moving from darkness to darkness, from darkness to light, from light to darkness, and from light to light—this is called *knowing and seeing*.

Good son, perfected ones and Daoists also both know and see. They know that when ordinary beings cultivate bodily discipline, practice, Dharma, precepts, concentration, and wisdom, if in this life their evil karma is mature, whether due to greed, hatred, or delusion, such karma will inevitably lead to retribution in the three evil destinies. Yet through cultivating bodily discipline, practice, Dharma, precepts, concentration, and wisdom, these beings experience only minor suffering in this life and do not fall into the three evil destinies. How can such karma be met with karmic retribution in accordance with principle? By openly confessing and repenting all past karma, and after repentance, never daring to repeat it, establishing shame and remorse, making offerings to the Three Treasures, and constantly reproaching oneself—due to these causes and conditions, they do not fall into the three evil destinies but instead experience retribution in this life. Such retribution includes various illnesses, ailments, encounters with deadly misfortunes, hunger and hardship, bodily pain and suffering—these are the minor retributions experienced in this life. This is called *knowing*. What is meant by *seeing*? Perfected ones and Daoists see that those who fail to cultivate bodily discipline, Dharma, precepts, concentration, and wisdom, and commit even minor evil, due to this karmic cause, will face karmic retribution; if such a person does not repent, does not reflect or reproach themselves, feels no shame or fear, their evil karma will increase, and they will suffer retribution in the dark prisons—this is called *seeing*.

There are also cases of knowing but not seeing. What is meant by *knowing but not seeing*? They know that all ordinary beings possess the Dharma-nature, yet it is obscured by defilements and cannot be seen—this is called *knowing but not seeing*. There are also cases of knowing but seeing little. Perfected ones and Daoists know that all ordinary beings possess the Dharma-nature, yet their vision is unclear, like seeing indistinctly in the dark of night.

There are also cases of both seeing and knowing. The heavenly sages both see and know. There are also cases of both seeing and knowing, yet not seeing and not knowing. What is meant by *both seeing and knowing*? This refers to worldly matters such as written language, clothing, bedding, mats, screens, food and the five flavors, worldly treasures, and the signs of living beings—this is called *both seeing and knowing*. What is meant by *not seeing and not knowing*? The profound and wondrous meanings possessed by the sages, which are free from notions of male and female, and even gardens—this is called *not seeing and not knowing*.

There are also cases of knowing but not seeing. They know what has been given, what has been offered, who the recipients are, and the karmic fruits of cause and effect—this is called *knowing*. What is meant by *not seeing*? They do not see the acts of giving, offering, the recipients, or their karmic fruits—this is called *not seeing*.

Perfected ones and Daoists possess eight kinds of knowledge, which are known through the divine penetrations and wisdom-eye of the Primordial Heavenly Worthy. Miao Le the Perfected One addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: "What benefits do perfected ones and Daoists gain from knowing in this way?"

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "Good son, perfected ones and Daoists who know in this way attain the four unimpeded powers: unimpeded dharma, unimpeded meaning, unimpeded wisdom, and unimpeded insight.

Unimpeded dharma means knowing all dharmas and their names. Unimpeded meaning means knowing all meanings inherent in the dharmas and being able to assign meanings to the names established for each dharma. Unimpeded wisdom means being able to analyze the profound principles found in sutras and treatises. Unimpeded insight means that whenever perfected ones and Daoists expound upon matters about which immortals have doubts, there are no obstructions, and they can clarify all dharma characteristics.

Good son, this is what it means for perfected ones to know and see in this way, thereby attaining these four unimpeded dharmas.

Good son, unimpeded dharma means that perfected ones and Daoists comprehensively know the profound dharmas of the wondrous sutras of divine immortals and great beings. Unimpeded meaning means that although there are the Three Vehicles, they know they all return to the One, and there are ultimately no differences or distinctions. Unimpeded wisdom means that perfected ones and Daoists can express a single dharma in myriad names, expounding upon it through infinite kalpas across heaven and earth without exhaustion—lesser immortals and disciples cannot do this. Unimpeded insight means that perfected ones and Daoists, over infinite kalpas, expound upon the dharmas to all ordinary beings and sentient beings, whether in names or meanings, employing skillful means and varied explanations that cannot be exhausted.

Good son, unimpeded dharma means that although perfected ones and Daoists know all dharmas, they do not cling to them. Unimpeded meaning means that although they know all meanings, they do not cling to them. Unimpeded wisdom means that although they know names, they do not cling to them. Unimpeded insight means that although they know such supreme insight, they do not cling to it. Why is this? If they were to cling, they would not be called perfected ones."

Miao Le the Perfected One again addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: "If they do not cling, then they do not know the dharma; if they know the dharma, then they are clinging. If they do not know clinging, then they know nothing—how then can the Heavenly Worthy say they know the dharma yet do not cling?"

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "Clinging is not called unimpeded; only without clinging is it called unimpeded. Good son, all perfected ones who cling are not unimpeded. Those without unimpededness are not called perfected ones—they should be known as foolish. Why is clinging called foolish? All foolish beings cling to form, and even cling to consciousness because of their clinging to form. Thus, they generate greed. Because they generate greed, they are struck and defiled by form, and even by consciousness. Because they are struck and defiled, they cannot escape birth, old age, sickness, death, sorrow, affliction, great suffering, and all afflictions. Therefore, clinging is called foolish. For this reason, all foolish beings lack the four unimpeded dharmas.

Good son, perfected ones and Daoists have known and seen the characteristics of dharmas for as many kalpas as the sands of the Ganges. Because they know and see, they understand their meanings. Because they see the characteristics of dharmas and know their meanings, they do not generate clinging to form, and it is likewise with consciousness. Because they are undefiled, perfected ones do not generate clinging to form, nor do they generate clinging to consciousness. Because they are without clinging, they are not struck or defiled by form, nor are they defiled by consciousness. Thus, they can escape birth, old age, sickness, death, sorrow, great suffering, and all karmic afflictions. For this reason, all perfected ones attain unimpeded dharma.

Good son, for this reason, in the *Yuanyang Sutra* I taught my disciples that being struck and defiled is called perverse attachment, while being undefiled means liberation from perverse attachment. It is like a guilty ordinary person being bound by officials, while an innocent person cannot be seized. Perfected ones and Daoists are likewise: those with clinging and defilement are seized by perversity, while those without defilement cannot be seized by perversity. For this reason, perfected ones and Daoists are without defilement.

Good son, unimpeded dharma means that perfected ones and Daoists skillfully know expedient means without false loss. What are expedient means? They are like earth, like mountains, like eyes, like clouds, like people, like mothers—all dharmas are likewise.

Unimpeded meaning means that although perfected ones know the names of all dharmas, they do not know their meanings but attain unimpeded meaning and can understand their intent. How do they know meaning? It is like the earth, which can give rise to all grasses and trees—ordinary beings, for this reason, are called like earth.

Good son, as for being like mountains: perfected ones and Daoists cultivate and study the Dao and its dharmas, contemplating their meanings to ensure they are unshakable—for this reason, they are called like mountains. As for being like eyes: they possess various lights that illuminate and reveal all meanings—for this reason, they are called like eyes. As for being like clouds: they can provide shade and moisture to benefit all things—for this reason, they are called like clouds. As for being like people: they uphold all the wondrous meanings of the dharmas and serve as good physicians for the world, healing all illnesses—for this reason, they are called like people. As for being like mothers: they lovingly nurture their elder brothers' children with an impartial heart—for this reason, they are called like mothers.

Good son, perfected ones and Daoists know the profound meanings of all dharmas, and they are likewise.

Unimpeded expression means that perfected ones and Daoists, using the wondrous terms of the great vehicle from the *Yuanyang Sutra*, can expound upon a single phrase without doubt or difficulty, and without any fixed meaning—just as all dwellings, grasses, and trees have names.

Good son, why is there no fixed meaning? Such meanings belong to the realm of perfected ones, Daoists, and the sagely beings of heaven."

Expressions belong to the realm of ordinary beings, for they know their meanings—this is why it is called "unimpeded expression."

Unimpeded wisdom means that perfected ones and Daoists, knowing the meanings of the dharmas, can expound upon their savor for as many kalpas as the grains of sand in the Ganges, yet their principle remains inexhaustible—this is called "unimpeded wisdom."

Good son, perfected ones and Daoists cultivated the supreme-meaning dharma for kalpas long past, thus attaining the unimpeded meaning. They also cultivated the *Lingbao Dadong Zhenjing* for kalpas long past, thus attaining the unimpeded dharma. They likewise cultivated the wondrous Three Clarities for kalpas long past, gaining wisdom without doubt or difficulty.

Good son, it is impossible for any of the immortals' disciples to possess these four unimpeded powers. As I have stated in this *Yuanyang Sutra*, though the immortals' disciples are said to possess the four unimpeded powers, in truth they do not. For this reason, perfected ones and Daoists possess these four unimpeded powers to deliver ordinary beings. The immortals' disciples practice the lesser arts of immortality, aspiring to the ranks of immortals but not yet ascending to the wondrous fruit—this is why the immortals' disciples are said to possess the four unimpeded powers.

Then Miaole the Perfected and others rose from their seats, knelt with hands clasped, and addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: "Today we have heard the proclamation and fully understood the source of the Dao." At that time, all the assembled deities bowed their heads in reverence and returned to their seats.

Thus concludes *The Wondrous Yuanyang Sutra of the Numinous Treasure*, Scroll Three.

*The Wondrous Yuanyang Sutra of the Numinous Treasure*, Scroll Four
"Questions on Practice"

The disciples then rose and addressed their Master, saying: "All beings possess their respective karmic capacities, as do the various great bodhisattvas, male and female officials. As we, your disciples, reflect: though the present Sage is not the Sage-Teacher of the past, he expounds the sequential teachings, unfolding the Great Dharma of Primordial Yang’s Ascension to Immortality and elucidating the Sutra of Profound Meaning. All dharma-assemblies of holy ones—male and female officials, those bound by external affinity and those by internal affinity—we, among the male and female immortals of the past, attained great adornment, divine penetrations, and luminous clarity. We once beheld this auspicious sign, this radiant illumination, and thus the Great Dharma was proclaimed. Therefore, we now recognize that the Master manifests transformations and broadly expounds the teachings—this is the second [aspect] of divine penetration. All dharmas are likewise; thus do we disciples come to hear and know of them. For those in the world who find it difficult to believe, this auspicious sign is manifested.

Among the male and female officials, in a past kalpa—boundless, immeasurable, and inconceivable—there was a king named Great Form-Lamp, the Pure Dharma King, who transformed and manifested eighty-four thousand lands. Those lands were level and joyous, abundant with people, free of mountains, rivers, sands, stones, ravines, or pits. Their cities, with earthen mounds and hills, were walled in gold, with pools of mercury, chambers of true pearls, and sleeping quarters adorned with agate. Extending over four hundred *li*, the people were kind and virtuous.

There was a disciple named Great Dharma Grove, widely learned in all dharmas, possessed of perfect wisdom and intelligence. He transcended and ascended to the supreme state, transforming and guiding gods and humans. His teachings were unadulterated, his voice exquisite and wondrous, fully clear and complete, endowed with the marks of the five penetrations. Expounding the Dharma for benefit, he liberated and delivered beings, realizing the emptiness of all dharmas. He became a Perfected One, and together with the Six Spirit Kings, he next attained the Dao, becoming a Second-Rank Perfected One of Primordial Yang’s Upper Grade, capable of perfecting all Dao-wisdom.

Next, there was another disciple named Constant Progress and Conduct, a great bodhisattva known as Luminous and Everlasting Form. This person had been born twenty-two times in the Palace of Literary Brilliance, owing to the roots of virtue planted in past lives. His numinous wisdom was celestial, inheriting the mysterious wind of transformation. Feasting on the teachings of the wondrous Dharma, he accumulated blessings and fulfilled all merits, attaining the fruit of the Nine Heavens. Rejoicing in the blessings to come, he received the shade of the Grand Clarity, concentrating his spirit in the Celestial Palace. His merit was vast, and the numinous peaks of the true palaces bestowed their favor. The immortals’ officials extended their hands to him. Among his studies and delights was the *Purple Yang Immortal Duke’s Diagram of the Grand Clarity*, and he was designated the Seventh.

Before leaving the household life, there was a great bodhisattva, fully endowed with wisdom, whose ancestral teachings followed Purple Yang as his master. He diligently studied the Primordial Yang of divine immortals, aspiring to the ranks of immortals in the celestial charts. He could discern the initial, middle, and lesser immortals; the initial, middle, and later virtues. His understanding was profound and far-reaching in the end.

Before the immortal Perfected One left the household life, he had eight attendant disciples: the first named Radiant Grove, the second named Treasure Grove, the third named Intent Grove, the fourth named Manifest Grove, the fifth named Good Grove, the sixth named Joyful Grove, the seventh named Jeweled Grove, and the eighth named Doubt-Dispelling Grove. These individuals were renowned in the Celestial Palace as Upper-Grade Perfected Ones of Primordial Yang, fully endowed with wisdom and conduct, possessing the five divine penetrations, majestic virtue, and self-mastery, each leading gods and humans.

When he first left the household life, he meditated beneath a tree, relinquishing his high station and arousing the mind of great compassion. Resolutely, he departed. Constantly cultivating the true practice, he became an immortal elder. After ten thousand years, all the virtues he had planted came to fruition. At midnight, during the *zi* hour, he observed the Northern Dipper’s handle and the Purple Tenuity of Literary Brilliance within the Dipper’s bowl. Suddenly, it opened, and he beheld the Most High Lord Lao descending upon a blue-green dragon—below, it was a blue-green horse. He addressed the person, saying: "Who is this true worthy?"

At that time, Lord Lao replied: "I am the Little Lad Li Yuan, a Perfected One of the Eastern Sea. At the celestial assembly’s celebration, I was sent down to transform you, Grove Bodhisattva. Later, you will expound the *Sutra of Boundless Meaning*, unfolding the second [teaching] of Primordial Yang’s divine immortals. Heavenly flowers rained upon him, universally transforming the world with manifold tremors."

At that time, among the assembly was a Perfected One, twelve years of age, who rose and addressed the Master, saying: "As for our great assembly, we have never before seen such joy and delight. Kneeling with focused mind, we behold the teachings expounded by the Master—excellent words, exquisite and wondrous, skillful in analogy and expedient means. Radiant illumination shines universally, illuminating all, enabling this assembly to awaken and become enlightened. The cause and condition of this illumination reveal the Upper Grade of Primordial Yang, the Great Rank of Immortals and Sages, the realm of gods and humans. That land is pure, never before seen. Thus, for hundreds of thousands of years, beings will forever abide in great blessings."

Perfected One Serene Grove of the Dharma said: "Since my Master expounded the Upper Grade of Primordial Yang, sixty minor kalpas have passed without his rising from his seat. Now, he wishes to gather responses and return to his origin. On the seventh day of the first month, he will return to the Celestial Palace to celebrate with the gods and humans. If, after my departure, there are one or two, or even ten among you who can propagate the wondrous Dharma and exhort beings, all shall be reborn in the ranks of Primordial Yang. Do not grow weary or indolent. For sixty minor kalpas, gods and humans shall share the same rank, receiving the prediction with one mind."

He then addressed the great bodhisattvas, saying: "Having received the words of Perfected One Serene Grove of the Dharma, we shall now celebrate with the gods and humans." After his departure, Wondrous Grove of Primordial Yang and Radiant Grove of Light attained the five penetrations and the wisdom of a divine immortal with vast knowledge. Skillful and sharp in scriptural predictions, they gained pure wisdom, awakened beings, and were named Pure Wisdom. When Perfected One Deliverance bestowed the prediction, on the seventh day of the first month in the *renchen* year, he suddenly departed.

Perfected One Grove of Primordial Yang’s Pure Wisdom was born in the palace of the Profound and Wondrous King. His ancestors had accumulated practices, diligently cultivating reverent mindfulness, delighting in the study of true scriptures, and constantly practicing the records of immortals. His ancestral teachings followed the Primordial One’s Celestial Palace. He studied the *Eight Hundred Scrolls of the Primordial One’s Immortal Canon*, which broadly expounded the teachings and transformed and delivered beings."

Mystic Grove expounded the *Eight Thousand Scrolls of the Immortal Records*, remaining seated without rising for eighty minor kalpas, discoursing for others. He had eight disciples: the first named Radiant Grove, the second named Mystic Grove, the third named Teaching Grove, the fourth named Unshakable Grove, the fifth named Lamp-Incense Grove, the sixth named Joyful Grove, the seventh named Deliverance Grove, and the eighth named Transformation Grove. These eight disciples all possessed luminous conduct and were the third-rank disciples of the Upper Grade of Primordial Yang. They dwelled beneath terraces, pavilions, gardens, fields, vast groves, and trees.

Among those who attained the rank of immortality was one named Perfected One Ancestral Sovereign, who sought to remain at his side, reciting scriptures with fluency, broadly expounding the various sutras, and proclaiming the supreme ranks. In the past, amidst a great assembly spanning sixty minor kalpas, his followers revered and respected him as he expounded the teachings to deliver countless beings, guiding them into the Upper Grade of Primordial Yang.

When he first left the household life, he had three disciples who beheld the divine and greatly sagely ones, with all immortals following in attendance. They expounded the boundless varieties of meaning within this sutra. The immortals and devas of all heavens were to broadly distinguish them. At that moment when I spoke, I was seated in the void of the heavens above, observing from on high for eighty minor kalpas as you broadly discoursed, ascending into the boundless ranks.

Celestial incense and jeweled canopies, dragon immortals and deva-kings made offerings among humans. All the immortals of the world adorned and purified the land, which was smooth as fat, with many jeweled trees. It was named the Palace of the Lion and Elephant Kings. At that moment, the various celestial and human divine sounds shook Perfected One Deliverance of Pure Wisdom, who emitted the light of spiritual penetrations. He beheld all the rare and wondrous signs and saw all the people of that land.

That land was pure, with mother-of-pearl for earth, yellow gold for its walls, white silver for its ramparts, lapis lazuli for its chambers, and yellow, azure, and crimson cords interwoven throughout. Agate bordered its sides, crystal formed its palaces, and white jade its towers. Everywhere were walking trees, gardens, groves, terraces, pavilions, and pure lotus ponds, with luxuriant flowers and fruits. All beings reveled in bliss within it. Extending continuously for over four thousand *li*, celestial light universally illumined it. Adorned with manifold treasures, lapis lazuli and glass were radiant within and without, not relying on the sun or moon.

The immortals prepared offerings of delicacies and food, with natural celestial kitchens and utensils. There, the foremost in purity among the devas emerged riding cloud chariots, drawn by dragon spirits and divine tigers, with soaring phoenixes singing. Bells hung on all four sides, and blessings were bestowed in the eight directions. Natural music arose, and their bodies shone with light like golden treasure mountains, majestic and wondrous as pure lapis lazuli, perfect within and without.

Next was a great being named Perfected One Discerning Wisdom Who Delivers from Calamity. All his disciples ascended to the heavens and the palaces of the Primordial One, delivering countless beings. Through my light, they flew with self-mastery, beholding all the immortals of the great assembly, the mountain-forest *mahāsattvas* of diligent progress, those who upheld the precepts in accord with the tally, and the wondrous numinous ranks of immortals, like bright pearls.

One disciple was named Serene Mystic Grove. He constantly cultivated practice in the mountains and forests, diligently upholding the precepts, with pure conduct, generosity, forbearance, and the immortal ranks of Primordial Yang. Another disciple was named Great Treasury of Wisdom, who entered the profound and wondrous samādhi, with body and mind quiescent and extinguished, possessing vast wisdom, samādhi, and insight.

The next disciple was named Mystic Brahma Grove, whose wisdom and dharma were profoundly vast and quiescent, with unmoving spiritual wisdom. Each discoursed on the supreme ranks in their respective lands. The next disciple was named Great Brahma Grove, who manifested great spiritual penetrations, his mind filled with joy. The four groups of disciples broadly expounded the teachings, each inquiring of one another about the immortal ranks of Primordial Yang.

The next disciple was named Contemplative Brahma Grove, who delighted in the supreme Dao and was revered by devas and humans, foremost in the three realms, able to praise all immortals as rare in the world. The next disciple was named True Mystic Sound, who broadly knew all things. Devas and humans turned toward him, taking refuge and placing trust in his great practices, able to uphold the supreme undertaking.

The next disciple was named Treasure Mystery Grove, whose mysterious wisdom was like empty space, illuminating the immortal records. He often praised yin and yang, broadly expounding the teachings, celebrating the assembly of devas and humans, and wondrously delivering the world. The next disciple was named Profound Wisdom, who possessed the five spiritual penetrations. After eighty minor kalpas, he could open the world’s teachings without rising from his seat. What he discoursed was of the supreme rank, subtle and unfathomable, and he was named Moonlight Supreme Immortal Master.

The next disciple was named Treasure Mystic Grove, who delighted both devas and humans. The true characteristics of all dharmas have already been expounded to you, including their length and brevity. On the fifth day of the tenth month, I shall return to the celestial palace. He addressed his disciples, saying: "You must single-mindedly cultivate diligent progress and ascend to the celestial palaces, where you shall be named the Heavenly People of Grand Purity."

All these disciples were of the immortal ranks of Primordial Yang, with unhindered spiritual penetrations. When Perfected One Deliverance of Pure Wisdom had finished speaking, he addressed his disciples, saying: "Since I and you have severed the immortal records, what barrier remains to the celestial palace of celebration?"

On the fifth day of the tenth month, I shall return to the celestial palace. The celestial command is most urgent, and this auspicious assembly is extraordinary. Thereupon, on the fifteenth day of this month at noon, the Perfected One, together with all the immortals, departed in cloud chariots and feathered canopies, attended by eighty million people, flying immortals, and celestial immortals—boundless holy multitudes—riding away.

The Heavenly People of Primordial Yang Deliverance of Grand Purity arose from the Palace of the Unattached King, traversing the three worlds in peace and tranquility. He addressed his disciples, saying: "I have received the profoundly deep wisdom of the Perfected Ones, boundless wisdom, and the gate of wisdom that sees arising. The five spirits are resplendent and bright, and the faculties are keen, benefiting all beings.

All the world finds it difficult to comprehend, difficult to fathom, and difficult to enter—something devas and humans cannot attain. Why is this so? I have personally drawn near to hundreds of thousands of myriads of billions of countless Perfected Ones and great beings, fully practicing the boundless great Dao, with courageous and diligent progress. My fame is universally heard, and my accomplishments are most profound. I have attained the rare dharma. The immortal officials of the Celestial Charts of Mount Ling bestowed the dharma, descending to transform the three realms, guiding and instructing as appropriate."

Since attaining the rank of Perfected One, through manifold causes and conditions, manifold analogies, I have broadly expounded the teachings in countless skillful means, guiding beings to depart from all attachments. Why is this so? My skillful means and insight are profound and far-reaching, all fully equipping the people of the world.

My Most High Former Master’s wisdom is vast, deep, and boundless, fearless and unobstructed. With a settled mind and liberation, he deeply entered the secret treasury, his insight without limit. He accomplished all unprecedented dharmas, ascending to the Celestial Palace as a Great Perfected One of the Supreme Primordial Yang, foremost among the sublime immortal charts. The precious scriptures, in manifold forms, distinguish and expound the dharmas with skillful speech, their words gentle and pleasing to the hearts of all. The people of the world, taking the essential teachings I have spoken, without limit, and upholding what I have taught, all attain accomplishment—unthinkable and inconceivable.

You need not speak further of this. Why? What I have accomplished is subtly wondrous and foremost, its meaning and purport difficult to comprehend. Only my supreme master can discern it. The profound mysteries of all dharmas cannot be fully fathomed.

I now possess such marks, such nature, such essence, such power, such activity, such conditions, such causes, such effects, such retributions, such origins and conclusions—all perfectly and ultimately realized.

At that time, the devas bestowed prediction upon faithful men and women of good conduct, causing all to hear and know, and all to awaken.

Then the youngest son of the Heavenly Elder, Mysterious Purity King, who first emerged from the Palace of Comforting Fields, took the Great Treasure as supreme in his ancestral teachings. What he cultivated were the eight thousand scrolls of the *Taiqing* scriptures. He could broadly expound the teachings for sixty minor kalpas without rising from his seat. Originally from countless [practices], he fulfilled all conduct—profound, wondrous, difficult to perceive, difficult to comprehend.

He had three chief disciples: the first named Mysterious Wonder Perfected One, the second named Proof of Fruit Perfected One, and the third named Luminous Wisdom Perfected One. These disciples possessed great sagely conduct and could expound the Primordial Yang immortal ranks for a thousand days and nights without rising from their seats.

Another disciple, named True Brahmā Grove, had keen faculties, profound subtlety, and practiced these ranks to attain fruition. I fully know such great fruition and the merits of Primordial Yang.

Another disciple, named Great Brahmā Grove, through manifold skillful means, could transform and instruct all beings of the ten directions, awakening those in darkness.

Another disciple, named True Purity Grove, possessed wisdom and unshakable faith. All these disciples, their afflictions exhausted, abided in their final state and ascended to the Celestial Palace of the Most High, each dwelling in their proper rank.

Thus concludes Scroll Four of the *Most High Numinous Treasure Primordial Yang Wondrous Scripture*.

---

**Scroll Five of the *Most High Numinous Treasure Primordial Yang Wondrous Scripture*: The Chapter on Contemplation and Practice (Part One)**

At that time, the Most August Heavenly Worthy of Jade Treasure of the Eastern Quarter, in the Pure Land of the Empty Song Realm, together with his divine immortals and retinue, flying celestial spirit-kings, perfected and greatly sagely hosts—eighty-four thousand companions in all—assembled amidst the fragrant groves and seven-jeweled trees. There he expounded the *Supreme Wondrous Scripture of Primordial Yang on Contemplation and Practice*, creating a vast field of merit for all future beings, dispelling deep doubts and enabling them to know the wondrous Dao.

“Good man, you should arouse the mind of aspiration and vow, and follow the four kinds of practices for cultivation.”

When these words were spoken, from among the assembly there arose a perfected one named Numinous Flower. Adjusting his robes and cap, he held a censer in hand and, kneeling at length, addressed the Heavenly Worthy: “By past causes, I have been fortunate to encounter your majestic radiance, and my joy surpasses all bounds—yet I am truly ashamed and awestruck. Now, having heard the profound and secret treasury of Primordial Yang expounded, its meaning runs so deep as to be inconceivable. How is this so?”

The Heavenly Worthy replied: “Good man, the four kinds of practices for cultivation are these: first, to follow a teacher and receive the scriptures of Primordial Yang; second, to seek out good spiritual friends to resolve deep doubts; third, to contemplate the profound meaning and attain the dharma of suffering and emptiness; fourth, to cultivate practice with diligence and aspire to realize the Dao.

“Good man, you should know that these four practices involve drawing near to an enlightened teacher, seeking out spiritual friends, requesting the explanation of profound meaning, and resolving doubts. Perfected One, you should understand these four kinds of practices for cultivation.

“Furthermore, good man, the actions of body, speech, and mind give rise to four kinds of delusion. What are these four? First, delusion of greed; second, delusion of ignorance; third, delusion of lust; fourth, delusion of deceit.

“Good man, those who study the Mahāyāna scriptures and seek the natural fruit should abandon these four kinds of delusive practices. What is the delusion of greed? It refers to coveting, beyond one’s proper share, worldly glory, fine clothing, rare treasures, and all manner of scheming and calculation—killing living beings, harming their lives, indulging one’s desires, and gluttonously devouring. Such things are called the delusion of greed.

“What is the delusion of ignorance? It refers to the transgressions of body, speech, and mind—failing to avoid the Three Luminaries (sun, moon, and stars), disrespecting the Three Treasures, and when encountering those who follow the Dao, hearing of their good deeds yet seeking to undermine them, spreading slander, scheming against elders and teachers, and when summoned, evading and refusing to comply. Such things are called the delusion of ignorance.

“What is the delusion of lust? It refers to delighting in feminine beauty without regard for kinship or propriety, seducing the wives and concubines of others, harboring secret schemes, covertly luring and enticing, separating people from their kin, and indulging without restraint. Such things are called the delusion of lust.

“What is the delusion of deceit? It refers to harboring false and flattering intentions, weaving countless deceptions, exploiting public office for private gain, covertly wielding power, posing as a renunciate while deceiving beings, seizing others’ wealth under the pretense of possessing the Dao, and lacking any true reality. Such things are called the delusion of deceit.

“Good man, if you earnestly seek the supreme natural fruit, Perfected One, you should know that these four evil delusions must all be severed.

“Furthermore, good man, there are two kinds of faith: first, faith of the utmost sincerity; second, faith lacking sincerity. Perfected One, you should know that sincere faith is good, while insincere faith is not called good.

“Moreover, faith has two aspects: first, constantly attending the Dharma seat; second, not attending the Dharma seat. Perfected One, you should know that those who constantly attend the Dharma seat are good, while those who do not are not called good.

“Among those who attend the Dharma seat, there are two kinds: first, those who pay homage; second, those who do not pay homage. Perfected One, you should know that those who pay homage are good, while those who do not are not called good.

“Among those who pay homage, there are two kinds: first, those who listen to the Dharma with utmost sincerity; second, those who do not listen with utmost sincerity. Perfected One, you should know that those who listen with utmost sincerity are good, while those who do not are not called good.

“Perfected One, you should know that among those who listen to the Dharma with utmost sincerity, there are two kinds: first, those who contemplate and seek its meaning; second, those who do not contemplate and seek its meaning. Perfected One, you should know that those who contemplate and seek its meaning are good, while those who do not are not called good.

“Among those who contemplate and seek its meaning, there are two kinds: first, those who practice as taught; second, those who do not practice as taught. Practicing as taught is good, while not practicing as taught is not called good.

“Among those who practice as taught, there are two kinds: first, those who possess great wisdom and can benefit all beings; second, those who possess great wisdom yet cannot benefit all beings. Those who can benefit all beings are good, while those who cannot are not called good.

“Perfected Youth, you should know that benefiting beings brings peace, joy, and the natural fruition of karmic reward.

“Good man, among all treasures, the luminous moon-pearl is the most sublime; among all flavors, the sweet dew nectar is the most sublime. Perfected One, if you can expound the meaning of the Primordial Yang scripture among humans and devas, benefiting all beings, this is the most sublime—beyond all comparison.

“Good man, this is called the Perfected Youth abiding in the nine dharmas of the Mahāyāna, the pure and unconditioned. Perfected Youth, abiding in these nine virtues, you will truly attain contemplation and practice.

“Furthermore, good man, the mind of contemplation and practice consists of the four immeasurables: kindness, compassion, joy, and equanimity.”

The Perfected One Numinous Flower knelt at length and addressed the Heavenly Worthy: “If abundant kindness can sever anger, and cultivating compassion can also sever anger, why then speak of the four immeasurable minds? Logically, it should be three.”

The Heavenly Worthy replied: “Kindness has three conditions: first, conditioned by beings; second, conditioned by the Dharma; third, unconditioned.”

Compassion, joy, and equanimity are likewise the same. If one examines their intent, there should logically be only one, not four.

That which is conditioned by beings is conditioned by the five aggregates, wishing to bestow happiness upon them—this is called the Dharma conditioned by beings. The so-called conditioning here means providing all the necessities that beings require—this is called the Dharma-conditioned.

The unconditioned is conditioned by the Heavenly Worthy—this is called the unconditioned.

Kindness is often conditioned. For impoverished beings, the Heavenly Worthy, the Great Master, forever severs their poverty and grants them the foremost joy. If conditioned by beings, one does not condition by the Dao; the same applies to the Dharma. For this reason, that which is conditioned by the Heavenly Worthy is called the unconditioned Heavenly Worthy.

The objects of kindness are all beings, such as parents, siblings, spouses, and kin—hence it is called the being-conditioned. The Dharma-conditioned does not perceive parents, siblings, spouses, or kin, but sees all beings as arising from conditions—this is called the Dharma-conditioned. The unconditioned does not abide in the marks of Dharma or beings—this is called the unconditioned. Compassion, joy, and equanimity are likewise the same. Thus, there should be three, not four.

The Heavenly Worthy said: “People are of two kinds: those who act from insight and those who act from attachment. Those who act from insight often cultivate kindness and compassion; those who act from attachment often cultivate joy and equanimity. Thus, there should be two, not four.”

The Heavenly Worthy said: “The immeasurable is called boundless because its bounds cannot be reached. If it is called immeasurable, it should be one, not four. If there are four, how can it be immeasurable? Thus, it should be one, not four.”

The Heavenly Worthy addressed Perfected Youth Numinous Flower: “Good man, when the sages of the heavens expound the essential Dharma for beings, their words are profound and secret—only you may understand. Sometimes they speak of one condition, such as all conditioned dharmas. Good man, sometimes they speak of two: cause and effect; or three: afflictions, karma, and suffering; or four: ignorance, volitional formations, birth, and old age; or five: feeling, grasping, existence, birth, and so on; or six: the causes and effects of the three times; or seven: consciousness, name-and-form, the six sense bases, contact, feeling, craving, and grasping; or eight: origin, clarity, volition, birth, old age, death, and the other eight matters; or nine: birth, old age, sickness, and death.

“Good man, for the sake of beings, these causes and conditions are variously distinguished. The immeasurable minds are likewise the same. Good man, for this reason, you should not doubt the profound and secret practices of the Heavenly Worthies. Good man, the Heavenly Worthy possesses great skillful means, teaching and transforming beings with meticulous care, enabling all to deeply comprehend the nature of the Dharma, dispel doubts, speak of suffering where there is no suffering, speak of joy where there is no joy, speak of cause where there is no cause, speak of effect where there is no effect, speak of the real where there is no real, expound the Dharma where there is no Dharma, speak of immortals where there are no immortals, and discourse on the Dao where there is no Dao.

“Good man, does the Heavenly Worthy employ such boundless skillful means to tame and transform beings in vain? Good man, if there are beings attached to wealth and treasure, I manifest myself to them as a wealthy elder, supplying all their needs for countless eons before teaching and transforming them, enabling them to awaken to the supreme, correct, and true Great Dao. If there are beings attached to the five desires, for countless eons I fulfill their desires before exhorting them to abide in the unconditioned realm, awakening them to the supreme, correct, and true Great Dao. If there are beings who pride themselves on their nobility, for countless eons I serve as their attendant, running errands and waiting upon them until their hearts are won over, then exhorting them to abide in the unconditioned realm, illuminating the supreme, correct, and true Great Dao.

“If there are ordinary beings whose minds are cruel and who commit evil deeds, requiring admonishment, for countless eons I teach, admonish, and console them, pacifying their hearts before exhorting them to enter the pure realm, awakening their understanding of the supreme, correct, and true Great Dao. Good man, does the Heavenly Worthy employ such boundless skillful means over countless eons to guide beings into the pure realm and cultivate the supreme, correct, and true Great Dao in vain? Though the sages dwell in defilement, they remain unstained, like a bright pearl in the sand or a lotus in muddy water.

“Good man, you should understand that the meaning of the four immeasurables is the immeasurable mind. As you said, kindness severs anger, and compassion also severs anger. Why is this? Good man, suffering is of two kinds: one that takes life, and one that inflicts lashes. Cultivating kindness severs the former; cultivating compassion removes the latter. Good man, for this reason, is it not the severing of anger?

“Furthermore, anger is of two kinds: anger toward beings and anger toward non-beings. Cultivating kindness severs anger toward beings; cultivating compassion severs anger toward non-beings. Furthermore, anger is of two kinds: that with a cause and that without a cause. Cultivating kindness severs anger with a cause; cultivating compassion severs anger without a cause. Furthermore, anger is of two kinds: that accumulated long in the past and that newly accumulated in the present. Cultivating kindness severs the past; cultivating compassion severs the present.”

Furthermore, anger is of two kinds: anger toward sages and anger toward ordinary beings. Cultivating kindness severs anger toward sages; cultivating compassion severs anger toward ordinary beings. Furthermore, anger is of two kinds: that which is superior and that which is middling. Cultivating kindness severs the superior; cultivating compassion severs the middling. Good man, for this reason, it is called the Four. Why is it difficult to speak of? It should be three, not four—this is why. The Perfected One of Numinous Flower is of boundless mind, and by analogy and contrast, distinguishes them as four. Moreover, by the nature of the vessel, it should be called the Four. If there were only kindness, there could be no compassion, joy, or equanimity—thus, it must be four and not fewer.

Good man, by the distinction of practice, there should be four. When practicing kindness, there is no compassion, joy, or equanimity—this is why. Good man, by its boundlessness, it is also called the Four Immeasurables. The Four Immeasurables are of four kinds: boundless mind with an object but not mastery; boundless mind with mastery but not an object; boundless mind with both object and mastery; and boundless mind with neither object nor mastery.

What is the boundless mind with an object but not mastery? When one contemplates boundless, limitless beings but cannot attain mastery, though one may partially realize the true and be tainted by dharmas, one may or may not succeed. What is the boundless mind with mastery but not an object? Such as when one contemplates parents, siblings, sisters, wives, and children, desiring to bring them boundless happiness. What is the boundless mind with both object and mastery? It refers to the sages and deities. What is the boundless mind with neither object nor mastery? Late learners of the Dharma, unable to broadly contemplate boundless beings, also lack mastery.

Good man, for this reason, it is called the Four Immeasurables. This is not known by late learners of the Dharma but is the realm of sages and deities. Good man, in these four matters, though late learners of the Dharma may call them boundless, they are too few to speak of; only sages and deities can truly be called boundless and limitless.

The Perfected One of Numinous Flower addressed the Heavenly Venerable: "So it is, so it is. Truly, as the Sage has said, the realm of sages and deities is beyond the reach of late learners of the Dharma. Heavenly Venerable, are there Perfected Ones abiding in the *Great Vehicle Primordial Yang Sutra* who attain the mind of kindness and compassion but not the mind of great kindness and great compassion?"

The Heavenly Venerable replied: "There are. Good man, if a Perfected One among the multitude distinguishes three grades: first, the beloved; second, the hostile; and third, the neutral. Among the beloved, there are further three grades: superior, middling, and inferior—and the same for the hostile. The Perfected One, as a novice, grants the highest joy to the superior beloved, equal joy to the middling and inferior beloved, and the highest joy to the superior hostile. To the middling hostile, they grant middling joy; to the inferior hostile, they grant the highest joy.

The Perfected One thus transforms hostility, practicing to grant middling joy to the superior hostile and equal highest joy to the middling and inferior hostile. Further practicing, they grant the highest joy equally to the superior and middling. When they grant the highest joy to the superior hostile, they are then called 'kindness' and have attained the Perfected One’s accomplishment. At that time, their mind toward good parents and the superior hostile becomes equal, without distinction.

Good man, this is called attaining kindness and compassion—great kindness. Heavenly Venerable, why does the Perfected One attain such kindness yet still not merit the name of great kindness and great compassion?"

"Good man, because it is difficult to perfect, it is not called great kindness. Why? In the past, over countless eons, they accumulated afflictions and did not cultivate wholesome dharmas, so they cannot, in a single day, subdue their mind, attain steadfastness, and be free from slackening. Good man, the mind of affliction is stubborn and hard to remove; the mind of the true Dao is light and easily lost. Like a household dog that fears no one, or a wild deer in the mountains that flees in terror at the sight of humans: anger is hard to remove, like a guard dog; kindness is easily lost, like a wild deer. Thus, this mind is difficult to subdue. For this reason, it is not called great kindness.

Furthermore, good man, it is like painting on stone—its marks endure; painting on water vanishes instantly, impossible to retain. Anger is hard to remove, like painting on stone; wholesome roots are easily lost, like painting on water. Thus, this mind is difficult to subdue. Like a great fire that burns long and bright, while lightning’s brilliance is fleeting: the fire of anger endures, while kindness is like lightning. Thus, this mind is difficult to subdue. For this reason, it is not called great kindness.

Good man, when a Perfected One novice abides in the true ground, it is called great kindness. Why? Good man, the most extreme evil is called wrong view. When one first abides in the true ground and cultivates great kindness, even when entertaining wrong views, the mind remains undifferentiated, seeing no fault and generating no anger. For this reason, it is called great kindness. Good man, removing what is unbeneficial for the foolish multitude is called great kindness. Desiring to bring boundless benefit and happiness to the foolish multitude is called great compassion. Rejoicing in the hearts of the foolish multitude is called great joy. Being without attachment is called great equanimity. Seeing no distinction between self, dharmas, and others, perceiving all dharmas as equal and undivided—this is called great joy. Forsaking self and others, delighting in giving to others—this is called great joy and equanimity.

Good man, only the Four Immeasurables enable a Perfected One to grow, perfecting the four deportments; other practices cannot necessarily do so. Good man, a Perfected One novice first attains the Four Immeasurable Minds, then arouses the mind of the unsurpassed, correct, and true great Dao, and only then, in due order, attains the supramundane."

Good man, through the immeasurable of the world one attains the supramundane; because of this meaning, it is called the Great Immeasurable.

The Perfected One of Numinous Flower addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: "Apart from those who confer no benefit and those who confer benefit and happiness, there is truly nothing to be done. To contemplate thus is but an empty observation, devoid of true benefit.

Heavenly Worthy, it is like when a Daoist contemplates impurity: seeing the garments one wears as all being of skin, yet in truth not skin; seeing what one eats as all being of worms, yet in truth not worms. Observing fine and beautiful broth as excrement and filthy liquid, yet in truth not excrement; observing the milk and cheese one eats as marrow and brains, yet not marrow and brains; observing crushed grain as powder, yet in truth not powder.

The Four Immeasurable Minds are likewise. If they cannot truly benefit sentient beings and enable them to attain happiness, though one may speak of conferring happiness upon sentient beings, in truth they do not attain it. Is not such contemplation false and deceptive?

Heavenly Worthy, if it were not false and illusory, and truly conferred happiness, why then do all sentient beings not, by the power of the devas and sages, receive happiness in all things? If it is truly real yet they do not attain happiness, as the Heavenly Worthy has said: 'I recall in the past, having cultivated only the Sutra of the Mind of Compassion, this kalpa’s world has undergone a hundred cycles of formation and destruction, and I have not been reborn here. When the world is formed, I am born in the Dragon-Transformed Brahmā Heaven; when the world is destroyed, I am born in the Heaven of the Great Ultimate and Equal Nurturance.'

If there are sentient beings who can arouse the mind of the Dao toward me and cultivate only compassion, they too may attain such human and heavenly rewards. If this were not real, how could it accord with this meaning?"

The Heavenly Worthy said: "Excellent, excellent! Good man, you are truly courageous and fearless." Then, for the Perfected One of Numinous Flower, he spoke these verses:

"One who can clearly discern the marks of dharmas,
And does not arouse the mind of the three poisons,
Whose actions are equal and impartial—
Such a one can proclaim the wondrous sound.

All the men and women of the world
Should do so with a pure and divine mind.
This is called the Chapter on Contemplation and Practice,
Attaining the fruit and meeting in the Forest of Fragrance.

At dawn, all Daoists,
Proficient in the precepts and skilled in profound mysteries,
Gracefully ascend the Purple Tenuity,
The serene peaks of the Jade Capital.

If one can embody the true and real,
One must seek the profound meaning.
At the six hours, constantly recite,
At the eight festivals, ever chant and sing.

Common folk and sentient beings,
Should cease killing, stealing, and sexual misconduct.
When the karma of body, speech, and mind is exhausted,
Evil spirits cannot invade.

All good causes and effects
Arise from the reverence of vows.
I now speak these verses
To awaken those sunk in delusion.

The ambrosial flavor of the sages,
The wondrous nectar poured at will.
The immortal’s intent serves the Dharma-robe,
The jade maidens adorn the divine hairpin.

The esoteric verses of Primordial Yang,
Like the five-stringed lute in harmony.
If you can discern the essential,
Your body will be purified as yellow gold."

"Good man, those who cultivate great compassion do so not in vain imagination, for this is the true and real principle. If it is a lesser immortal or a beginner in learning, it is called false and illusory; the devas and sages are true and not false.

How is this known? Good man, when a Perfected One novice cultivates this Supreme Vehicle Sutra of Primordial Yang, observing earth as gold, gold as earth; earth as the appearance of water, water as the appearance of earth; water as the appearance of fire, fire as the appearance of water; earth as the appearance of wind, wind as the appearance of earth; the conditioned as the unconditioned, the true as the provisional; the real as emptiness—whatever the mind conceives is without falsehood.

Observing sentient beings as not being sentient beings, observing non-sentient beings as true sentient beings—whatever the mind conceives is without falsehood.

Good man, you should know that the Four Immeasurable Minds of a Perfected One novice are both true and real, and not true and real.

Furthermore, good man, what is called true and subtle contemplation? It means being able to sever the net of doubt and still all afflictions. Good man, one who cultivates the mind of compassion can sever craving; one who cultivates the mind of悲 can sever hatred; one who cultivates the mind of joy can sever discontent; one who cultivates the mind of equanimity can sever craving, hatred, and the marks of sentient beings. For this reason, it is called the true and real meaning.

Furthermore, good man, when a Perfected One cultivates the Four Immeasurable Minds, they become the root of all good qualities.

Good man, if a Perfected One novice does not see impoverished sentient beings, there is no cause to arouse compassion; without compassion, one cannot arouse the mind of generous giving. Through this cause and condition, one enables all ordinary beings to attain peace and happiness—such as food and drink, vehicles, clothing, incense and flowers, beds and seats, sleeping mats, various treasures and playthings, various sweet fruits, various patterned silks, and various brocades.

When giving thus, the mind is without regret or stinginess, without arising attachment, and one definitely dedicates it to the unsurpassed, correct, and true great Dao. At that time, the mind has no reliance, delusive thoughts are forever severed, and one does not act for fear, fame, profit, or the pleasures received in the human and heavenly realms. One does not give rise to arrogance, nor expect repayment. Not deceiving others, one practices giving; not seeking reward, when giving, one does not see a recipient.

Whether upholding or transgressing the Dharma, whether by this or not—this is a good spiritual friend. When giving thus, one does not select days or choose times, but gives with a straightforward mind, without regret or remorse. One does not consider whether the recipient is hungry or full, poor or prosperous, nor sees cause and effect. This is an ordinary being, this is not an ordinary being; this is merit, this is not merit.

Though one does not see the giver, the recipient, or the clothing and goods—even to the point of not seeing severance or karmic reward—one constantly practices giving without interruption.

Good man, if a Perfected One sees upholding or transgressing the Dharma, or even karmic reward, they will be unable to give. If one does not relinquish and let go, one will not perfect the natural fruit; if one does not perfect the natural fruit, one cannot accomplish the unsurpassed, correct, and true great Dao."

Good man, it is like a man struck by a poisoned arrow. His kin, wishing him well and to remove the poison, summon a skilled physician to extract the arrow. Yet the man says, "Wait, do not remove it. I must first observe from which direction this poisoned arrow came, who shot it, whether it was an enemy or a malevolent spirit, or if it arose naturally." Such a foolish man, unable to know these things, soon dies.

Good man, the Perfected One is likewise: if, when practicing giving, one discriminates the recipient—whether they uphold or transgress the Dharma, or even karmic reward—one will be unable to give. If one cannot give, one will not perfect the natural fruit; if one does not perfect the natural fruit, one cannot accomplish the unsurpassed, correct, and true great Dao.

Furthermore, when the Perfected One’s youth practices giving and scattering, toward all ordinary beings, he maintains a mind of compassion and equality, regarding them as his own children. When giving, he arouses thoughts of loving-kindness toward all ordinary beings. Just as parents gaze upon their sick child, when he practices giving and scattering, his mind rejoices. Like parents seeing their child’s illness cured, after giving and scattering, his mind relinquishes. Like parents seeing their child grown and able to sustain himself, such is the mind of the Perfected One’s youth.

When practicing giving with a mind of compassion, offering food, he constantly thinks: "What I now give, I share with all ordinary beings." For this reason, he enables all ordinary beings to obtain the food of great wisdom, diligently dedicating it to the unsurpassed Mahāyāna *Yuanyang Sublime Sutra*. May all ordinary beings and all sentient beings, with a single thought of equality, obtain the food of good wisdom, not seeking to beg from the noble, wealthy, or prosperous. May all ordinary beings obtain my food, not seeking other food. May all ordinary beings and all sentient beings attain natural food, all becoming satiated, unimpeded in their uptake, and increasing in good roots. May all ordinary beings and all sentient beings comprehend the emptiness of characteristics, attain an unimpeded body like empty space. May all ordinary beings and all sentient beings always be recipients, cherishing all, serving as fields of merit.

Good man, when the Perfected One’s youth cultivates a mind of compassion, for all food he gives, he should firmly generate such vows of the unsurpassed, correct, and true equality.

Furthermore, good man, when the Perfected One’s youth practices giving with a mind of compassion, offering drink, he constantly makes this vow: "What I now give, I share with all ordinary beings." For this reason, he enables all ordinary beings to enter the river of the Mahāyāna, drink the eight kinds of flavored water, swiftly awaken to the unsurpassed, correct, and true Dao, leave behind all doubts and obstructions, sever afflictive karma, thirst for the flavor of the Dharma, delight in the Mahāyāna *Yuanyang* scriptures, perfect the Dharma-body, attain the treasury of all dharmas, and enter the profound ocean of wisdom. May all ordinary beings and all sentient beings obtain the water of ambrosia, drink the flavor of sweet springs, and with the arising of the true Dao, all attain purity in such dharmas. May all ordinary beings and all sentient beings perfect the immeasurable hundreds of thousands of Dharma-flavors; having perfected the Dharma-flavors, may they see the nature of the Dao; having seen the nature of the Dao, may they rain the rain of the Dharma; having rained the rain of the Dharma, may the Dao and Dharma pervade all, like empty space. May the remaining immeasurable sentient beings attain the single flavor of the Dharma—the Mahāyāna—not the flavors of heterodox views. The various kinds of sentient beings differ, not the flavor of goodness.

Good man, when the Perfected One’s youth practices giving with a mind of compassion, offering drink, he should firmly generate such natural vows.

Furthermore, good man, when the Perfected One’s youth practices giving with a mind of compassion, offering fine clothing, brocades, vehicles, and bedding, he constantly makes this vow: "What I now give, I share with all ordinary beings." Through this cause and condition, may all ordinary beings accomplish, abide in, never retreat from, and remain unshaken in the fruit of the Mahāyāna *Yuanyang*. Good man, when practicing giving with a mind of compassion, offering fine clothing, brocades, vehicles, and bedding, he should always firmly generate such vows.

Furthermore, good man, when the Perfected One’s youth practices giving with a mind of compassion, offering clothing, he constantly makes this vow: "What I now give, I share with all ordinary beings." Through this cause and condition, may all ordinary beings and all sentient beings obtain the clothing of shame and modesty, their bodies covered by the Dharma-realm, tearing apart heterodox views, their clothing leaving their bodies, attaining pure bodies. May all that they receive be purely good and unimpeded, their complexions warm and moist, their skin soft, perpetually radiant and without color. May all ordinary beings and all sentient beings attain bodies without color, transcending all colored realms, and enter the secret treasury of the great Mahāyāna without color.

Good man, when the Perfected One’s youth practices giving with a mind of compassion, offering clothing, he should think thus and firmly generate such natural vows.

Furthermore, good man, when the Perfected One’s youth practices giving with a mind of compassion, offering fragrant incense of a hundred harmonies, he constantly makes this vow: "What I now give, I share with all ordinary beings." Through this cause and condition, may all ordinary beings and all sentient beings, upon smelling its fragrance, all awaken to the Dao. May all ordinary beings and all sentient beings become like the bright moon, all that they see being supremely subtle and wondrous. May all ordinary beings and all sentient beings attain all the myriad adornments of goodness.

May all ordinary beings and all sentient beings see whatever pleasing forms they desire.
May all ordinary beings and all sentient beings always encounter noble friends, obtain unobstructed fragrance, and be free from all foul odors.
May all ordinary beings and all sentient beings possess all virtuous deeds and the supreme, precious treasure.
May all ordinary beings and all sentient beings know harmony and joy, be free from sorrow and affliction, all awaken to the suffering and emptiness of existence, and have no attachments of love.
May all ordinary beings and all sentient beings uphold the unobstructed Dharma, their fragrance pure and pervasive, filling the entire world.
May all ordinary beings and all sentient beings attain the steadfast Dharma, the Dharma free from regret, all precepts of the Dharma, be free from all broken precepts, all attain the Dharma without attachment, the unprecedented Dharma, the Dharma without a teacher, the uncontrived Dharma, the unstained Dharma, the untainted Dharma, the ultimate Dharma, the ultimate Dharma, the Dharma of equality, transcending good and evil, equal and without partiality or attachment.
May all ordinary beings and all sentient beings attain the supreme Dharma, the Dharma of the Great Vehicle, not the Dharma of the Lesser Vehicle.
May all ordinary beings and all sentient beings fully realize the natural fruition of the Dao, just as the Perfected One did when first attaining the Dharma.
May all ordinary beings and all sentient beings all engage in giving, uphold the precepts, practice forbearance, diligence, and spiritual wonder, perfumed and cultivated by fragrant flowers.
May all ordinary beings and all sentient beings all accomplish the supreme, subtle, and wondrous treasure fragrance of primordial yang, its fragrance pervading empty space.
May all ordinary beings and all sentient beings partake purely of the supreme, Great Vehicle fragrance of primordial yang, like bees gathering from flowers, taking their fragrance and essence.

Good man, when the Perfected One’s youth practices giving with a mind of compassion, offering fragrant incense, he should constantly and firmly generate such natural vows.

Furthermore, good man, when the Perfected One’s youth practices giving with a mind of compassion, offering bedding and seats, he constantly makes this vow: "What I now give, I share with all sentient beings." Through this cause and condition, may all ordinary beings obtain the celestial beds on which they recline, gain great wisdom, sit in the four states of bliss, and rest upon the Perfected One’s bed, never lying upon the beds of demonic or unwholesome Dharma.
May all ordinary beings rest in peace, free from the bed of birth and death, and attain the natural lion’s bed of repose.
May all ordinary beings, having sat upon this bed, further manifest spiritual powers for the sake of countless other ordinary beings, possessing great wisdom and strength.
May all ordinary beings dwell in this palace of primordial yang and expound the Dharma for all ordinary beings.
May all ordinary beings sit upon the supreme bed, never subdued by worldly Dharma.
May all ordinary beings attain the bed of forbearance, free from birth and death, hunger, and hardship.
May all ordinary beings attain the bed of fearlessness, forever free from afflictions and all hostile foes.
May all ordinary beings attain the pure bed, devoted solely to the supreme, true, and correct Dao.
May all ordinary beings attain the bed of virtuous Dharma, always protected by good friends.
May all ordinary beings attain the bed of reclining on the left side, in accordance with the practices of the sages.

Good man, when the Perfected One’s youth practices giving with a mind of compassion, offering bedding and seats, he should constantly and firmly generate such vows.

Furthermore, good man, when the Perfected One’s youth practices giving with a mind of compassion, offering dwellings, he constantly makes this vow: "What I now give, I share with all ordinary beings." Through this cause and condition, may all ordinary beings dwell in the Great Vehicle’s abode, cultivate the practices of good friends, the practice of great compassion, the practice of sublime liberation, and the practices of the celestial Perfected Ones—boundless and vast as empty space.
May all ordinary beings all attain right mindfulness, far removed from evil thoughts.
May all ordinary beings all dwell in peace, abiding in constant joy and purity, forever free from the four inclinations.
May all ordinary beings all uphold the subtle and wondrous scriptures.
May all ordinary beings all become the supreme abode of omniscience.
May all ordinary beings all enter the abode of the joyful Dharma of sweet dew.
May the minds of all ordinary beings, in the beginning, middle, and end, always enter the pure palace of primordial yang.
May all ordinary beings, in future lives, always dwell in the palaces where the Perfected Ones reside.

Good man, when the Perfected One’s youth practices giving with a mind of compassion, offering dwellings, he should constantly and firmly generate such vows.

Furthermore, good man, when the Perfected One’s youth practices giving with a mind of compassion, offering lamp-light, he should make this vow: "What I now give, I share with all ordinary beings." Through this cause and condition, may all ordinary beings attain boundless illumination and abide in the Dharma.
May all ordinary beings always be bright and clear.
May all ordinary beings attain radiant and lustrous forms, supremely subtle and wondrous.
May all ordinary beings have pure eyes, free from obstructions and veils.
May all ordinary beings attain the great torch of wisdom, fully understanding non-self, without the marks of ordinary beings, without person or life.
May all ordinary beings all clearly perceive the pure Dharma-nature, like empty space.
May the eyes of all ordinary beings be bright and clear, seeing afar the worlds of the ten directions like the Ganges’ sands.
May all ordinary beings attain the illumination of the Dharma, pervading the infinite lands of the ten directions.
May all ordinary beings attain unobstructed light, all clearly perceiving the pure Dharma-nature.
May all ordinary beings attain the great illumination of wisdom, dispelling all darkness and demonic influences.
May all ordinary beings attain boundless illumination, universally shining upon the infinite celestial worlds.
May all ordinary beings kindle the lamp of the Great Vehicle Dharma, free from the views of the Lesser Vehicle.
May the illumination attained by all ordinary beings extinguish the darkness of ignorance, surpassing the light of a thousand suns.
May all ordinary beings attain great illumination, pervading the three-thousandfold world, all hidden darkness fully dispelled.

May all ordinary beings attain the five eyes in full, awaken to the marks of the Dharma, and become supreme masters.

May all ordinary beings perceive no ignorance.

May all ordinary beings attain the primordial yang’s subtle and wondrous illumination of the Great Vehicle, revealing and awakening ordinary beings to the true nature of the Real Person and the true Dharma.

Good man, when the Real Person Youth offers lamp-light within the heart of compassion, he should always firmly generate such vows.

Good man, the celestial Real Person Youths take compassion as their root; cultivating the heart of compassion, they give rise to such boundless meritorious deeds—
what is called impurity, exhalation and inhalation, impermanence and arising-and-ceasing, the four noble fruits, the five kinds of virtuous deeds, the three attainments of insight, the eight kinds of merit, all entering emptiness, without form or appearance.
They know the wisdom of others and all the wisdom of spiritual penetrations, the wisdom of the primordial beginning, the wisdom of the immortals, the wisdom of the youth, the wisdom of the Real Person, the wisdom of the Heavenly Worthy.

Good man, such Dharmas take compassion as their root.
For this reason, compassion is true and real, not false or delusive.

Good man, one who can act with goodness is called “true and subtle contemplation”; true and subtle contemplation is called compassion.
Compassion is the Heavenly Worthy; compassion is the Great Vehicle; the Great Vehicle is compassion; compassion is the Heavenly Worthy.

Good man, compassion is the natural; compassion is the true Dao; the true Dao is compassion; compassion is the Heavenly Worthy.

Good man, compassion is the immortal; the immortal is compassion; compassion is the Heavenly Worthy.

Good man, compassion serves as father and mother to ordinary beings and all sentient beings; father and mother are compassion; compassion is the Heavenly Worthy.

Good man, compassion is the inconceivable realm of all Dharmas; the inconceivable realm of all Dharmas is compassion.
You should know that compassion is the Heavenly Worthy.

Good man, compassion is the Dharma-nature of ordinary beings; this Dharma-nature has long been obscured by afflictions, causing ordinary beings to be unable to perceive it.
Dharma-nature is compassion; compassion is the Heavenly Worthy.

Good man, compassion is the great void; the great void is compassion; compassion is the Heavenly Worthy.

Good man, compassion is empty space; empty space is compassion; compassion is the Heavenly Worthy.

Good man, compassion is the eternal; the eternal is the true; the true is the Dao; the Dao is compassion; compassion is the Heavenly Worthy.

Good man, compassion is joy; joy is the immortal; the immortal is the Dharma; the Dharma is compassion; compassion is the Heavenly Worthy.

Good man, compassion is purity; purity is clarity; clarity is the Dao; the Dao is the Dharma; the Dharma is compassion; compassion is the Heavenly Worthy.

Good man, compassion is the self; the self is the Dao; the Dao is the Dharma; the Dharma is the noble one; the noble one is compassion; compassion is the Heavenly Worthy.

Good man, compassion is the sweet dew; the sweet dew is compassion; compassion is Dharma-nature; Dharma-nature is the Dao; the Dao is the noble one; the noble one is compassion; compassion is the Heavenly Worthy.

Good man, compassion is the supreme Dao of the Real Person; the Dao is compassion; compassion is the Heavenly Worthy.

Good man, compassion is the boundless worlds of the celestial sages; the boundless worlds are compassion.
You should know that this compassion is the Heavenly Worthy.

Good man, if compassion were to have existence or non-existence, neither existence nor non-existence—there is no such compassion that inferior immortals or beginners could fathom.

Good man, if compassion is inconceivable, the Dharma is inconceivable, Dharma-nature is inconceivable, and the Heavenly Worthy is also inconceivable.

Good man, the Real Person Youth abiding in the wondrous garden of the Great Vehicle cultivates such compassion—though resting in sleep, he does not sleep, for he is diligent and vigorous.
Though ever clear, he is not clear, for he is without slumber.
In his sleep, though the celestials protect him, there is no protector, for he does not commit evil.
He does not dream evil dreams, nor does he have unwholesome thoughts, though he sleeps.
After the end of his life, though he is born in heaven, there is no birth, for he attains mastery.

Good man, cultivating compassion can accomplish such boundless and infinite merits.
Good man, this supreme and subtle scripture of the Primordial Yang can also accomplish such boundless and infinite merits; the celestial Real Persons also attain such boundless and infinite merits.

The Real Person of Numinous Flower addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: “All the subtle contemplations of the Real Person Youths are true and real; those of inferior immortals and late learners are not true.”

“Why do all sentient beings not receive joy equal to the power of the Real Person Youths?
If sentient beings truly do not attain joy, then the compassion cultivated by the Real Persons would be without benefit.”

The Heavenly Worthy said: “Good man, the compassion of the Real Persons is not without benefit for sentient beings.
All ordinary beings either must suffer or may not suffer. If there are sentient beings who must suffer, then the compassion of the Real Persons would be without benefit.
But if ordinary beings may or may not suffer, then the compassion of the Real Persons becomes beneficial, enabling those sentient beings to all receive joy.

Good man, it is like a person who, seeing fierce beasts and poisonous creatures from afar, naturally feels dread and fear; walking at night and seeing ghosts, he also feels terror.
Good man, such people naturally experience fear.
Sentient beings, upon seeing one who cultivates compassion, naturally receive joy.

Good man, for this reason, the compassion cultivated by the Real Person is true and subtle contemplation, not without benefit for all sentient beings.
One should wholeheartedly make offerings, recite, and contemplate the *Supreme Subtle Scripture of Primordial Yang’s Contemplation and Practice*, deeply understanding the heart of compassion, joy, equanimity, and renunciation—all attaining liberation and ascending to the fruit of the supreme, natural, and great Dao.”

Good men, you must not slight or scorn, harbor doubts or perverse thoughts, disbelieve the scriptural teachings, or slander the sacred texts. If one’s heart gives rise to disbelief, one shall fall into the three evil destinies and receive the retribution of being reborn as an animal.

Thereupon, the numinous Radiant Flower Real Person, the divine immortals and their retinues, and the good men, having gained clarity and harboring no lingering doubts, all paid reverent homage, circumambulated three times to the left, prostrated, and departed.

The Fifth Scroll of the *Supreme Numinous Treasure Scripture of Primordial Yang* concludes.
*(Note: “议” should read “卷” [Scroll].)*

The Sixth Scroll of the *Supreme Numinous Treasure Scripture of Primordial Yang*
The Middle Chapter on Contemplation and Practice

At that time, the Primordial Yang Wondrous Joy Real Person, together with the great assemblies of the heavens, the divine immortals and their retinues, and eighty-four thousand youths, gathered in the Primordial Yang realm. They prepared a great high seat, adorned with incense, flowers, music, banners, canopies, and myriad treasures, filling the entire void of space.

All at once, they expounded the mysterious and subtle, the secret treasury of Primordial Yang, enabling those who would be reborn as men and women to universally hear the sacred teachings.

The Heavenly Worthy, moved by great compassion, manifested various radiant signs and expounded the profound and esoteric scriptures, awakening sentient beings: “What is known in the world, I too know; what is unknown in the world, I too fully know. What does this mean?

Good men, all in the world do not know, do not see, do not awaken to the nature of the Dao. If there are those who know, see, and awaken to the nature of the Dao, they are not called worldly beings but are named Real Persons. Worldly ordinary beings also do not know, do not see, do not awaken to the thirty-six revered scriptures, the thirty-six kinds of causes and conditions, or the meaning of the supreme-grade contemplation and practice of Primordial Yang. If one can know, see, and awaken to these, one is not called a worldly being but is named a Real Person.

Good men, this is what is meant by the world’s not knowing, not seeing, and not awakening.

What then is the world’s knowing, seeing, and awakening? It refers to the Lord of Creation’s dharmas, the beginning and end of the world, the two views of annihilation and permanence, and the discourse that begins with the initial mind and extends to the Neither-Perception-Nor-Non-Perception realm, calling this the true Dao.

Good men, this is what is meant by the world’s knowing, seeing, and awakening.

Real Persons and youths know, see, and awaken to such matters. If Real Persons, having thus known, seen, and awakened, claim not to know, not to see, and not to awaken, this is falsehood. The dharma of falsehood is sin, and because of this sin, one falls into hell.

Whether man or woman, if one declares there is no Dao, know that such persons are kin to external demons and are named slanderers of the Dao and its dharma. Those who slander the dharma slander the Heavenly Worthy. Such persons shall fall into the three evil destinies, become non-human kinds, and receive manifold苦 retributions.”

Thereupon, the Wondrous Joy Real Person and all the dharma assemblies, having heard these words, praised them in verse:

“Out of loving-kindness for sentient beings,
You expound Primordial Yang to me.
Skillfully extracting the poisoned arrows,
Thus You are called the Great Physician King.
The world’s physicians, though they heal,
Bring harm again once cured.
Those treated by the Heavenly Worthy
Ultimately attain freedom from calamity.”

The sagely ambrosial medicine is the wondrous nectar of all gods.
Once sentient beings partake of it,
They neither die nor perish.
Now the Heavenly Worthy expounds,
Dissecting the hidden and secret chapters.
Having heard this treasury of mysteries,
Beings ascend to the realm of self-mastery.

After the Wondrous Joy Real Person recited this verse, he addressed the Heavenly Worthy: “As You have said, in all the world, none know, see, or awaken to the Primordial Yang Youth. If the Primordial Yang Youth were of this world, You could not say that the world does not know, see, or awaken, while only the Primordial Yang Youth knows, sees, and awakens. If not of this world, what distinguishing marks does he bear?”

The Heavenly Worthy replied: “Good son, the true person youth is both of this world and not of this world. Those who do not know, see, or awaken are called ‘of this world’; those who know, see, and awaken are not called ‘of this world.’ You ask what distinguishes them—I shall now explain.

Good son, whether man or woman, if upon first hearing this *Supreme Contemplation of Primordial Yang Sublime Scripture*, one generates reverence and faith, and arouses the mind set on the supreme, correct, and true Great Dao, such a one is called a ‘youth of this world.’ All the world does not know, see, or awaken, and such a youth likewise does not know, see, or awaken. Yet having heard this scripture, the youth knows there is something the world does not know, see, or awaken to—this should be what the youth knows, sees, and awakens to. Knowing this, the youth reflects: ‘By what means shall I cultivate to attain knowing, seeing, and awakening?’ Again and again, he thinks: ‘Only by wholeheartedly upholding the dharma precepts.’

Good son and good daughter, for this reason, in future lives in every place, they will remain free from arrogance, perverse views, and the net of doubt. They will never speak of the Heavenly Worthy in vain, and will ultimately enter the profound and wondrous. This is called a true person. Having upheld the precepts and purified their conduct, they next cultivate the true dharma, so that wherever they are born, their right mindfulness never falters.

That is to say, all sentient beings possess the Dao-nature; the thirty-six divisions of the Heavenly Worthy’s scriptures, the Heavenly Worthies and true persons, constantly delight in the self and the pure—all true person youths see the Dao-nature. Remembering such matters without forgetfulness, through cultivating concentration they attain the twelve emptinesses. This is called a true person youth.

Having perfected the pure dharma precepts, they next cultivate pure wisdom. Through cultivating pure wisdom, the precepts they uphold become firm and unshakable. Good son, it is like Mount Jade Capital, which is not shaken by the four winds. The true person youth is likewise not swayed by the four inversions.

Good son, when the true person knows, sees, and awakens, the precepts they uphold remain unshaken. This is called the knowing, seeing, and awakening of the true person—not of this world. Good son, when the true person’s upheld precepts are firm and unshakable, their mind is free from regret. Being free from regret, their mind attains joy. Attaining joy, their mind attains delight. Attaining delight, their mind attains tranquility. Attaining tranquility, they attain the unshakable concentration. Attaining the unshakable concentration, they attain true knowing and seeing. Attaining true knowing and seeing, they become weary of birth and death. Becoming weary of birth and death, they attain self-mastery. Attaining self-mastery, they clearly perceive the Dao-nature. This is called the knowing, seeing, and awakening of the true person—not of this world.

Good son, this is what is meant by the world not knowing, seeing, or awakening, while the true person knows, sees, and awakens.”

The Wondrous Joy Real Person again asked: “How does the Primordial Yang Youth uphold the dharma precepts without regret, and ultimately clearly perceive the dharma-nature?”

The Heavenly Worthy replied: “Good son, the precepts of this world are not called pure. Why? The precepts of this world are for the sake of existence, their nature is unstable, they are not ultimate, and they cannot broadly benefit all sentient beings. For these reasons, they are called impure. Being impure, they give rise to regret. With regret, the mind lacks joy. Lacking joy, there is no delight. Lacking delight, there is no tranquility. Lacking tranquility, there is no unshakable concentration. Lacking unshakable concentration, there is no true knowing and seeing. Lacking true knowing and seeing, there is no weariness of birth and death. Lacking weariness, there is no liberation. Lacking liberation, the dharma-nature is not seen. Not seeing the dharma-nature, one ultimately cannot attain the fruit of the supreme Great Dao. This is called the impurity of the world’s dharma.

Good son, the pure dharma of the true person youth is not dharma for the sake of non-dharma, not for the sake of existence, its nature is stable and ultimate, and it is for the sake of sentient beings. This is called the purity of the true person’s dharma.

Good son, though the true person youth does not intend to generate a mind free from regret within the dharma precepts, such a mind arises naturally. Good son, it is like someone holding a bright mirror, not expecting to see their face, yet their reflection appears of itself. It is like a farmer sowing seeds in fertile soil, not expecting sprouts to grow, yet sprouts arise of themselves. It is like lighting a lamp, not expecting darkness to vanish, yet darkness vanishes of itself. Good son, when the true person youth upholds the dharma precepts, a mind free from regret arises naturally—it is likewise so.

Through the purity of the dharma, the mind attains joy. Good son, it is like a person of fine appearance seeing their own face and feeling joy. One who upholds the dharma precepts is likewise so. Good son, one who violates the dharma precepts, seeing the impurity of the precepts, feels no joy—like one with a crippled or ugly form seeing their own reflection and feeling no delight. One who violates the dharma precepts is likewise so.

Good son, it is like two cowherds, one carrying a jar of cream and the other a jar of whey, both going to market to sell their wares. On the way, they stumble, and both jars break. One feels joy, the other sorrow.”

Upholding the precepts and violating the dharma are likewise so. One who applies the mind with reverence to uphold the pure dharma precepts feels joy in the heart; because of this joy in the heart, one then contemplates that in the scriptures of the Heavenly Venerable, it is said that those who uphold the pure dharma precepts attain the true Dao. "I now cultivate such dharma precepts and should likewise attain it." Through this causal condition, the heart feels delight.

The Perfected of Primordial Yang again asked: "What is the difference between joy and delight?"
Good son, when one does not commit evil, this is called joy; when the mind upholds the dharma precepts, this is called delight. Good son, observing birth and death is called joy; seeing the marks of the dharma is called delight. The lower is called joy, the higher is called delight. Departing from the shared dharma is called joy; attaining the unshared dharma is called delight. Because your precepts are pure, your form and bearing become light and gentle, and your speech is free from coarse faults. Perfected Youth, at that time, whether seeing or hearing, all evil is absent; because evil is absent, the mind attains peace. Because of this peace, one attains stillness and concentration. Attaining stillness and concentration, one gains true knowledge and vision. Gaining true knowledge and vision, one becomes weary of birth and death. Becoming weary of birth and death, one attains freedom. Attaining freedom, one sees the dharma-nature. Seeing the dharma-nature, one attains the true Dao. This is called the Perfected Youth purely upholding the dharma precepts—precepts that are not of the worldly kind.

Why is this so? Good son, the pure dharma precepts one receives and upholds are assisted by five dharmas. What are the five assisting dharmas? First is faith, second is shame, third is remorse, fourth is good spiritual companions, and fifth is reverence for the true dharma. Because the five hindrances are departed from, what is seen is pure; because the five views are departed from, the mind is free from doubt and obstruction. What are the five doubts? First is doubt of the Dao, second is doubt of the dharma, third is doubt of the true, fourth is doubt of the precepts, and fifth is doubt of non-negligence.

At that time, the Perfected attains the five roots—namely, faith, mindfulness, vigor, concentration, and wisdom. Because of the five roots, one attains the five kinds of true dharma: form-freedom, and so on up to consciousness-freedom. This is called the Perfected Youth purely upholding the precepts—precepts that are not of the world. Good son, this is what the world does not know, see, or perceive, but what the Perfected knows, sees, and perceives.

Good son, if among my disciples there are those who receive, uphold, recite, or transcribe the *Upper Grade Scripture of Primordial Yang*, and there are those who break the precepts, others may reproach, belittle, disparage, or humiliate them, saying: "If the profound treasury of the *Mahāyāna Sūtra of Primordial Yang* possesses power, why do you now slander and violate the dharma precepts you have received? If one receives and upholds the wondrous scripture of Primordial Yang yet violates the precepts, know that this scripture is without power. If it is without power, though one recites it, there is no benefit. Because of such disparagement of the *Scripture of Primordial Yang*, countless beings will fall into hell. Those who receive and uphold this scripture yet violate the precepts are great evil companions to beings, not my disciples, but followers of demonic forces. Such persons, I do not permit to receive the subtle and wondrous scriptures, nor to receive, uphold, and cultivate them while slandering the dharma by violating the precepts."

Good sons and daughters, if among my disciples there are those who diligently receive, uphold, recite, transcribe, or expound the *Mahāyāna Treasury of the Profound Primordial Yang*, they should rectify body and mind, taking care not to engage in frivolity or restless movement. Frivolous speech is called restless movement of the mind; seeking existence is called restlessness, and bodily actions are called frivolity. If among my disciples there are those who seek existence and create karma, they should not receive and uphold the subtle and wondrous meanings of this *Scripture of Primordial Yang*. If those who receive and uphold the scripture seek existence and create karma, others may reproach them, saying: "If the profound treasury of the Heavenly Venerable’s *Mahāyāna* possesses power, why do you seek existence and create karma? If those who receive and uphold the scripture seek existence and create karma, know that this scripture is without power. If it is without power, though one receives and recites it, there is no benefit. Because of such disdain for the *Scripture of Primordial Yang*, countless beings will fall into the three evil destinies of hell. Those who receive, uphold, and recite this scripture while seeking existence and creating karma are great evil companions to beings, not my disciples, but kin to demonic forces."

Furthermore, good son, if among my disciples there are those who recite, transcribe, or expound the meaning of the *Mahāyāna* scriptures, they should not speak at improper times, nor speak contrary to the dharma, nor speak impurely, nor speak with a frivolous mind, nor speak in a way that extinguishes the Dao, nor speak with worldly dharma ablaze. Good son, if among my disciples there are those who receive and uphold this scripture yet speak at improper times, or up to speaking with worldly dharma ablaze, others may reproach them, saying: "If the *Mahāyāna Treasury of the Profound Primordial Yang* possesses power, why do you speak at improper times, or up to speaking with worldly dharma ablaze? If those who uphold the scripture speak in this way, know that this scripture is without power. If it is without power, though one recites it, there is no benefit. Because of such disdain for the *Mahāyāna* scripture, countless beings will fall into hell. Those who receive and uphold this scripture yet speak at improper times, or up to speaking with worldly dharma ablaze, are great evil companions to beings, not my disciples, but followers of demonic forces."

Good son, if one wishes to receive, uphold, and recite, or expound the *Great Scripture of Primordial Yang*, speak of the dharma-nature, expound the *Mahāyāna Profound Treasury*, speak of the scriptures of immortals, speak of the youth attaining the Dao, speak of freedom and liberation, or see the dharma-nature, one should first purify the body. Because it is pure, there will be no reproach; because there is no reproach, countless people will generate a pure mind toward the *Scripture of Primordial Yang*, reverently reciting, receiving, and upholding this scripture.

If one hears even a single verse, a single phrase, or a single character, sighs with admiration and rejoices, and expounds it to others to awaken beings, thereby attaining the mind of the supreme, correct, and true Great Dao, know that such a person is a true good companion to beings, my disciple, not a follower of external demonic forces, and is called a true person.

Good son, good daughter, this is what the world does not know, does not see, does not awaken to, yet the true person knows, sees, and awakens to.

Furthermore, good son, what is meant by "what the entire world does not know, see, or awaken to, yet the true person knows, sees, and awakens to"? It is the six recollections. What are the six? First, recollection of the Heavenly Venerable; second, recollection of the true person; third, recollection of the youth; fourth, recollection of the dharma precepts; fifth, recollection of the Daoist; sixth, recollection of compassion.

Good son, what is recollection of the Heavenly Venerable? The sage is one who is rightly and universally knowing, whose luminous conduct is complete, who is a goodly passage through the world, who understands the unsurpassed one, who tames and guides the teacher of gods and humans, who is eternally unchanging; fully possessed of majestic power, fearless in body, ultimately pure, having reached the other shore; without one who can surpass, without one who can topple, without fear or dread, unstartled and unafraid, without companion or teacher, self-awakened and swiftly knowing; of great wisdom, sharp wisdom, profound wisdom, liberating wisdom, having accomplished the king of humans, the tamer and guide of gods and humans, the great benefactor, the great dharma master. Because he knows the dharma, he is called the great dharma master. Because he knows the meaning, he is called the great dharma master. Because he knows the time, he is called the great dharma master. Because he knows contentment, he is called the great dharma master. Because he knows the self, he is called the great dharma master. Because he knows the various natures of beings, he is called the great dharma master. Because he knows the keen, dull, and middling faculties of all beings, he is called the great dharma master. Because he expounds the wondrous Dao of Primordial Yang, he is called the great dharma master.

Furthermore, the Wondrous Joy True Person addressed the Heavenly Venerable, saying: What is meant by "one who responds"? The Heavenly Venerable replied: The dharmas of the world are all called enemies, for the dharma responds by harming, hence it is called "responding." The four demons are such. Good son, when the Heavenly Venerable was a good son, he was able to destroy the four demons with wisdom, hence he is called "one who responds." Furthermore, "responding" means to be far removed. When he was a good son, he was to be far removed from countless afflictions, hence he is called "one who responds." Furthermore, "responding" means joy. In the past, when the Heavenly Venerable was a good son, though he endured countless afflictions for the sake of beings over immeasurable kalpas, he was never without joy, but always rejoiced. The Heavenly Venerable is also thus, hence he is called "one who responds." Moreover, "responding" means that all humans and gods should make offerings of various fragrant flowers, music, and entertainments to him, hence he is called "one who responds."

What is "rightly and universally knowing"? "Right" means not inverted; "universally knowing" means being thoroughly penetrating amid inversion. Moreover, "right" means ascetic practice; "universally knowing" means knowing that through ascetic practice, there is certainly a bitter fruit. Moreover, "right" means within the world; "universally knowing" means definitively knowing that through cultivating the Middle Way, one attains the fruit of the supreme, correct, and true. Moreover, "right" means that which can be counted and measured; "universally knowing" means that which cannot be counted or measured. Therefore, the Heavenly Venerable is called "rightly and universally knowing." Good son, even if one of the true vehicle were to contemplate a single form for immeasurable kalpas without removing it, one could not exhaustively know it. For this reason, there is no universal knowing.

What is "whose luminous conduct is complete"? "Luminous" means attaining immeasurable good fruits; "conduct" means the foot; "complete" means the good fruit of the supreme, correct, and true Dao. Therefore, it is called "whose luminous conduct is complete." Moreover, "luminous" means incantation; "conduct" means auspicious; "complete" means, good son, the meaning in the world. "Incantation" means liberation; "auspicious" means the fruit of the supreme, correct, and true. Therefore, it is called "whose luminous conduct is complete." Moreover, "luminous" means light; "conduct" means karma; "complete" means, good son, the meaning in the world. "Light" means non-negligence; "karma" means attaining the fruit of self-mastery. Moreover, "luminous" means the three luminosities. What are the three luminosities? First, the luminosity of the true person; second, the luminosity of the Heavenly Venerable; third, the luminosity of ignorance. The luminosity of the true person is the natural fruit. The luminosity of the Heavenly Venerable is the wisdom eye. The luminosity of ignorance is ultimate emptiness. "Conduct" means cultivating various good karmas for the sake of beings over immeasurable kalpas. "Complete" means clearly seeing the dharma-nature. For this reason, it is called "whose luminous conduct is complete."

What is "a goodly passage"? "Good" means lofty; "passage" means not lofty. Good son, this is the meaning in the world. "Lofty" means the supreme, correct, and true Great Dao; "not lofty" means the mind of the Heavenly Venerable. Good son, if the mind were lofty, it would not be called the Heavenly Venerable. Therefore, the Heavenly Venerable is called "a goodly passage." Moreover, "good" means a good companion. Good son, this is the meaning in the world of a good companion. A good companion is the initial arousal of the mind, and its fruit is the Heavenly Venerable of the highest grade of Primordial Yang. Not abandoning the initial arousal of the mind, one attains the great wondrous scripture. Therefore, the Heavenly Venerable is called "a goodly passage." Good son, this meaning in the world is called seeing the dharma-nature and attaining the profound wondrous principle. Good son, the true nature of the Dao is truly not existent, but the Heavenly Venerable, because of the world, speaks of it as existent. Good son, it is like someone who in truth has no one, in truth has no child, yet falsely claims to have someone; in truth has no virtue or Dao, yet falsely speaks of having virtue and Dao.

The true Dharma is likewise: because of the world, it is falsely spoken of as existent. The Perfected One accomplishes the supreme Dao, hence is called the "Goodly Passage." What is meant by "Supreme Man"? The term "superior man" denotes severance. One who severs nothing is called the "Supreme Man." The Heavenly Venerable, the Perfected One, is without afflictions, hence has nothing to sever—therefore, the Heavenly Venerable is titled the "Supreme Man." Moreover, the "superior man" is named for contention; the "Supreme Man" is without contention. The Sage is without contention—thus, the Heavenly Venerable is titled the "Supreme Man." Furthermore, the "superior man" is named for speech that may be refuted; the "Supreme Man" has speech that cannot be refuted. The words of the Heavenly Venerable cannot be refuted by any being—therefore, the Heavenly Venerable is titled the "Supreme Man." Also, the "superior man" is named for a high seat; the "Supreme Man" is without a superior seat. No Sage of the three times surpasses him—therefore, the Heavenly Venerable is titled the "Supreme Man."

At that time, the Wondrous Joy Perfected One, his mind still harboring doubt, inquired of the Heavenly Venerable: "What is meant by 'Tamer and Guide, Great Man, Teacher of Gods and Humans'?" The Heavenly Venerable replied: "All Perfected Ones and youths who cultivate four dharmas are called 'Great Men, Teachers of Gods and Humans.' What are the four? First, relying on good companions, they cultivate and study the true Dharma. Second, their minds are able to listen to the Dharma and fathom its wondrous meaning. Third, they contemplate the profound principle without doubt or difficulty. Fourth, they uphold the precepts of the Dharma and conduct that subdues beings. Good son, possessing these four dharmas, one is called a 'Great Man'; without them, one is not called a 'Great Man.' Why? Though the body may be that of a great man, if the mind harbors deceit and crookedness, and the intent is tainted with depravity, one cannot be called a 'Great Man.' The majestic power of the Heavenly Venerable tames and subdues beings, enabling them to know the true Dharma—thus, he is titled 'Tamer and Guide, Great Man, Teacher of Gods and Humans.'"

Again, the good son inquired of the Heavenly Master: "What is meant by 'Tamer and Guide, Teacher of Gods and Humans'?" The Heavenly Venerable said: "There are two kinds of teachers: one who teaches good, and one who teaches evil. I now teach all beings with the good Dharma. What is the good Dharma? It is the goodness of body, speech, and mind. I now teach all beings to speak thus: 'Good son, you should distance yourself from unwholesome bodily deeds. Why? Because unwholesome bodily deeds can be distanced from, and one thereby attains freedom. Therefore, I teach you this Dharma. If these unwholesome deeds could not be distanced from to attain freedom, I would never teach you to distance yourself from them. If beings distance themselves from unwholesome deeds, there is no possibility of falling into the three evil destinies. By distancing oneself, one accomplishes the fruit of supreme, correct, and true enlightenment—thus, I constantly teach this Dharma to transform beings. The same applies to speech and mind—therefore, I am called the Teacher of Gods and Humans.'"

Moreover, before attaining the Dao, one was deluded; now, having awakened, one expounds the Dao attained to beings. From the beginning, one had not cultivated good conduct; now, having completed the cultivation, one teaches what was cultivated to beings. Having shattered one’s own ignorance, one shatters the ignorance of beings. Having attained the pure eye, one shatters the blindness of beings, enabling them to attain the pure eye. Knowing the two wisdoms, one expounds the two wisdoms. Having oneself awakened, one expounds the Dharma of awakening to beings. Having crossed the boundless, limitless sea of birth and death, one enables all beings to cross over. Having attained fearlessness, one teaches beings to be without dread. Having attained the supreme, correct, and true Dao, one expounds the supreme, correct, and true Dao to beings—therefore, the Heavenly Venerable is titled the "Tamer and Guide, Teacher of Gods and Humans."

Again, the good son’s mind harbored further doubt, and he ventured to inquire: "What is meant by 'Heavenly'?" The reply: "'Heavenly' means day—day is long, night is short—hence it is called 'Heavenly.' Moreover, 'Heavenly' means without sorrow or affliction, constantly receiving joy—hence it is called 'Heavenly.' Also, 'Heavenly' means lamp and light, able to shatter darkness and become great illumination—hence it is called 'Heavenly.' It also shatters the darkness of unwholesome deeds, attains wholesome deeds, and is born in heaven—hence it is called 'Heavenly.' Furthermore, 'Heavenly' means auspicious—because of auspicious omens, it is named 'Heavenly.' Also, 'Heavenly' is named for the sun—the sun has light—hence the sun is called 'Heavenly.' For these reasons, it is called 'Heavenly.'"

"'Human' means capable, abundant in kindness and righteousness. Moreover, 'human' means the body and speech are pure and fragrant. Also, 'human' means having arrogance. Furthermore, 'human' means able to shatter arrogance. Good son, though I am now the supreme Tamer and Guide for all beings, the scripture calls me the 'Teacher of Gods and Humans.' Why? Good son, among all beings, only gods and humans can arouse the natural intent for the Dao, cultivate the ten good deeds, and attain the fruit of the supreme, correct, and true great Dao—therefore, I am titled the 'Teacher of Gods and Humans.'"

Again, the good son inquired of the Heavenly Venerable: "My doubts are not yet exhausted; I have further questions. What is meant by the 'Great Dao'?" The Heavenly Venerable replied: "The Dao is called 'pervasive'—it pervades and understands itself and enables others to pervade. Good son, it is like someone who, knowing there are thieves, renders the thieves powerless. The Perfected One and youth can pervade all boundless afflictions; having pervaded them, they render afflictions powerless—hence the Dao is called 'pervasive.' Because of this pervasiveness, one is not born, does not age, does not fall ill, does not die—this is the true Dao. Good son, you should know that within my Dharma, there are great officials and soldiers, heavenly escorts, armored troops, and heavenly warriors who can capture demonic and evil spirits, and all afflictions are completely subdued. They can also accomplish all good dharmas, possess great majestic power that pervades the ten directions, and can perform various great acts of generosity. Moreover, they remain uncorrupted through boundless kalpas—hence it is called the 'Great Dao.'"

"Good son, whether man or woman, if one can thus contemplate the Dao—whether walking or standing, sitting or lying, by day or night, in light or darkness—one will constantly remain inseparable, beholding all true Dao.

Good son, why is it called the 'True Dao, the Properly Enlightened One Who Pervades All Knowledge,' and why does the Perfected One and youth possess such boundless meritorious virtues and great renown? Good son, in countless kalpas past, the Perfected One revered parents and teachers, constantly practiced generosity for the sake of all beings, firmly upheld precepts, cultivated forbearance, diligently practiced vigor, true concentration, and wisdom, and embodied great compassion. Thus, today, he attains the seventy-two marks, eighty excellences, and a body like true gold.

Moreover, in countless kalpas past, the Perfected One and youth cultivated faith and resolve, advanced the roots of concentration and wisdom, made offerings and paid homage to all teachers, and always acted for the benefit of the Dharma, never for harm. If the Perfected One and youth uphold, read, recite, expound, or teach the thirty-six revered sutras, they constantly enable beings to attain freedom, liberation, and unconditioned peace, secure and joyful, never acting for themselves. Why? The Perfected One constantly cultivates a supramundane mind, a mind without grasping or rejecting, without bondage, without birth or death, without doubt, without greed, without anger, without delusion, without arrogance. Having cultivated such a mind, all becomes pure; one deeply comprehends the source of the Dao, free from defilement, free from affliction, free from suffering, boundless, vast, empty, and void, without worldly intent, constantly at ease, constantly liberated, without retribution, without ill will, with good will, without verbal intent, with gentle intent, without abiding, without regression, without impermanence, with upright intent, without crookedness, with pure and good intent. Having such intent, one attains fearlessness, constant joy, self-mastery, and purity. Thus, one cultivates the mind of the unsurpassed, proper, and true Great Dao—this is the fruit of the Perfected One and youth.

How does the Perfected One and youth contemplate the Dharma? Good son, one reflects on all dharmas, the most sublime and supreme teachings. Through this Dharma, beings can attain the present fruit. Only this true Dharma is timeless, seen by heavenly illumination, not by the fleshly eye, yet it cannot be likened to any analogy. It is unborn and unproduced, unabiding and unceasing, without beginning or end, without going or coming, unmoving and unturning, neither long nor short. It eternally severs all pleasures yet abides in secure joy, ultimately subtle. It is not form yet severs form while also being form; up to not consciousness yet severs consciousness while also being consciousness; not karma yet severs karma while also being karma; not fetters yet severs fetters while also being fetters; not realms yet severs realms while also being realms; not existence yet severs existence while also being existence; not emergence yet severs emergence while also being emergence; not entry yet severs entry while also being entry; not cause yet severs cause while also being cause; not fruit yet severs fruit while also being fruit; not truth yet severs truth while also being truth. Through such contemplation and practice, one directly realizes suffering and emptiness, accomplishing the sublime Dao.

Furthermore, it is neither false nor real, severing all reality while also being real; neither arising nor ceasing, eternally severing arising and ceasing while also being cessation; neither marked nor unmarked, severing all marks while also being the one mark; neither teaching nor non-teaching yet also being teaching; neither fear nor fearlessness, severing all fear while also being fear; neither forbearance nor non-forbearance, eternally severing all forbearance while also being forbearance. All such dharmas eternally remove all afflictions, eternally pacify, are pure and markless, eternally sever all marks. Countless beings ultimately abide therein, able to sever all birth and death. It is the radiant abode where the Heavenly Venerable dwells, constantly unchanging. This is the contemplation of the Dharma by the Perfected One and youth.

How does one contemplate the Dharma? All heavenly Perfected Ones abide in the Dharma, unbreakable, unassailable, inconceivable. For all beings, they are bridges and fields of merit. Though fields of merit, they receive nothing, pure and undefiled, without ill intent, harmonious and equanimous, single-minded without duality, constantly unchanging, without disturbance. This is contemplation of the Dharma.

How does one contemplate the precepts? The Perfected One and youth reflect on the precepts as unbroken, unviolated, uncorrupted, and unmixed. Though without form or color, they can be upheld; though without contact, through skillful practice, they can be perfected without fault. The Perfected One and youth praise them, and all attain boundless, sublime causes. Good son, if one can cultivate and uphold the pure realm, all thieves and robbers dare not disturb, fire cannot burn, water cannot sweep away. If one cultivates these precepts, one attains the natural fruit, the mind of the unsurpassed, proper, and true Great Dao. One should broadly expound the sublime Dharma for all beings as their refuge and protection. This is the Perfected One’s contemplation of the precepts.

How does one contemplate generosity? The Perfected One deeply observes that generosity is the cause of the unsurpassed, proper, and true Great Dao. Good sons, if one draws near and cultivates such generosity, I too draw near and cultivate it. Without bestowing alms, one cannot adorn and make offerings to the fourfold assembly. Though generosity cannot ultimately sever fetters, it can remove present afflictions. Through the causes of generosity, one is constantly praised by beings in the ten directions, as numerous as the sands of the Ganges in countless worlds. Good son, to give beings food is to give them life. Through this karmic retribution, when attaining the Dao, one remains constantly unchanging."

Through the causes of joyful giving, when attaining the Dao, one obtains bliss. When a youth gives alms, seeking in accordance with the Dharma without encroaching upon one offering for another, thus attaining the Dao, one obtains the fruit of purity. When a Perfected One gives alms, enabling all beings to gain without seeking, thus attaining the Dao, one obtains the natural fruit. Through the causes of giving, I empower others, thus attaining the Dao and obtaining the twofold karmic conditions of generosity. Enabling others to gain speech, thus attaining the Dao, one obtains the threefold roots of goodness. Perfected Ones and youths who cultivate this generosity do so as the supreme cause. I too cultivate generosity as the true and good cause. This is the contemplation of generosity.

How does one contemplate the heavens? There are nine heavens where divine immortals dwell, extending even to the realm of neither perception nor non-perception. Through learning, generosity, and wisdom, one attains the nine heavens of divine immortals, even reaching the realm of neither perception nor non-perception. I too have a share in this, yet it is not my desire. Why? The nine heavens of divine immortals, even the realm of neither perception nor non-perception, are all impermanent. Due to impermanence, there arise birth, aging, sickness, and death. For this reason, it is not my desire. It is like an illusion deceiving the foolish; the wise are not deluded by it. The nine heavens of divine immortals, even the realm of neither perception nor non-perception, are like illusions. The foolish are all ordinary beings; I am not like these foolish ordinary beings. I have heard of the Heaven of the Supreme Meaning, where Perfected Ones and youths remain constantly unchanging. Due to their purity and eternal abiding, they are neither born nor perish, neither age nor sicken nor die. For the sake of beings, I diligently aspire to seek the Heaven of the Supreme Meaning. Why? The Heaven of the Supreme Meaning can enable beings to sever afflictions, like a wish-fulfilling tree. If I have faith, even wisdom, I can attain this Heaven of the Supreme Meaning. This is the Perfected One’s contemplation of the heavens.

Good sons, this is the Perfected One’s transcendence of the worldly. It is unknown and unseen by the worldly, yet known and seen by the Perfected One. Good sons, if my disciples are said to uphold, recite, transcribe, expound, and elucidate the *Supreme Yang’s Exalted, Subtle, and Secret Treasury Sutra*, or to uphold, recite, transcribe, propagate, explain, and expound the Mahayana teachings without distinction, this is not so. Why? Good sons, the *Supreme Yang Sutra* is the profound and secret treasury of all heavenly Perfected Ones and divine immortals. This profound and secret treasury of the heavenly Perfected Ones is supreme. Good sons, for this reason, the *Supreme Yang’s Wondrous Sutra* is most rare and subtle, beyond thought and conception.

The Wondrous Joy Perfected One addressed the Heavenly Venerable, saying: "I now also know that the *Supreme Yang’s Wondrous Sutra* is most rare and subtle, beyond thought and conception. The Dao’s Dharma is lofty and exalted, beyond thought and conception. The Perfected Ones and youths are also beyond thought and conception." For what reason is it said again that the Perfected One is beyond thought and conception? Good sons, without a teacher, one can spontaneously arouse the unsurpassed mind for the Dao. Having aroused this mind, one diligently cultivates and advances, even if a great fire burns one’s body and head, never seeking rescue, never abandoning the mind intent on the Dharma. Why? The Perfected One and youth constantly reflect: "In countless kalpas, I have been in the three wretched destinies—hells, animal realms—heaven and human realms, burned by the fires of kalpas. I have never once attained a decisive Dharma. This decisive Dharma is the cause of the unsurpassed, proper, and true Great Dao. I never guarded or cherished body, mind, or life. Now, for the unsurpassed, proper, and true Great Dao, even if my body is shattered like dust motes, I will never abandon diligent cultivation and advancement. Why? The mind of diligent advancement is the cause of the unsurpassed, proper, and true Great Dao."

Good sons, such a Perfected One, having not yet seen the unsurpassed, proper, and true Great Dao, can already be so ungrudging of body and life. How much more so after having seen it? This Perfected One is beyond thought and conception. Furthermore, the Perfected One and youth see that the sufferings of birth and death are boundless and limitless, with countless evil faults, beyond the reach of all demonic forces. Though knowing the boundless and limitless sufferings and evil faults of birth and death, for the sake of beings, they endure suffering within it without generating weariness or aversion. Thus, they are again called beyond thought and conception. The Perfected One and youth, for the sake of beings, though enduring all sufferings in hell, manifest traces like ordinary beings. Thus, they are called enduring suffering beyond thought and conception.

Good sons, it is like a elder whose house catches fire. Seeing this, the elder escapes from the house, but the children remain inside, not yet free from the fire’s peril. The elder, knowing the danger of the fire, returns to rescue the children, undeterred by the peril. The Perfected One and youth, in saving and protecting beings, are likewise. Though knowing the many faults of birth and death, for the sake of beings, they abide within it without weariness. Thus, they are again called beyond thought and conception.

Good sons, when countless and boundless beings spontaneously arouse the mind for the Dao, seeing the many faults in birth and death, their minds retreat in regret. They restrain the six senses, sever the five desires, cultivate the wondrous Dao, and contemplate the true sutras. Thus, they are again called beyond thought and conception.

Good sons, if someone claims, "I can float and cross the great sea," is such a statement beyond thought and conception or not? The Heavenly Venerable said: Such a statement may be thought and conceived or beyond thought and conception. Why? If one truly crosses, it is beyond thought and conception. If one falsely claims to cross, it is thought and conceived. Good sons, what I now speak is true and accurate, without falsehood or error.

The Heavenly Venerable said: Among humans, there are those who may be thought and conceived, and those who are beyond thought and conception.

The Heavenly Venerable said: Humans are of two kinds—first, the sagely; second, the ordinary. The ordinary person is beyond thought and conception; the worthy and sagely person may be thought and conceived.

Good sons, I speak of the ordinary person, not the sage.

The Heavenly Venerable said: If the ordinary person is truly beyond thought and conception—good sons, the ordinary person truly cannot cross the great sea of water, yet the true person truly can cross the great sea of birth and death. Thus, they are again called beyond thought and conception.

Good sons, if someone claims they can drag a lotus fiber to suspend Mount Jade Capital, is this thought and conceived or not?

The Heavenly Venerable said: Good sons, in a single thought-moment, they can weigh all of birth and death. Thus, they are again called beyond thought and conception.

Good sons, through countless kalpas, I have always observed the impermanence, suffering, and impurity of birth and death, yet for the sake of beings, I distinguish and expound the eternal, blissful, self, and pure. Though I speak thus, it is not a false view. Thus, they are again called beyond thought and conception.

Good sons, like one who enters water yet is not drowned, or enters raging fire yet is not burned—such matters are beyond thought and conception. The true person and immortal youth are likewise: though dwelling in birth and death, they are not afflicted by birth and death. Thus, they are again called beyond thought and conception.

Good sons, humans are of three grades: upper, middle, and lower.

What are the upper, middle, and lower?

The lower-grade person, upon first entering the womb, thinks: "I am now in a privy, where all filth gathers, among corpses, in a thicket of thorns, in profound darkness." When first emerging from the womb, they again think: "I now exit the privy, the place of filth and evil, even emerging from profound darkness."

The middle-grade person thinks: "I now enter a grove of fruit trees, a pure river, a secluded palace." When emerging, it is likewise.

The upper-grade person thinks: "I ascend a palace hall, dwell among kalpa trees, ride a fine steed, and climb a lofty mountain." When emerging, it is likewise.

The true person and immortal youth, when first entering and dwelling in the womb, know their dwelling; when emerging, they know their emergence. They do not arouse minds of greed, anger, or delusion, yet have not attained the first dwelling-ground. Thus, they are again called beyond thought and conception.

Good sons, the supreme secret treasury of primordial yang is truly beyond thought and conception—it cannot be compared by analogy.

Good sons, the mind also cannot be compared or measured by analogy.

The true person and immortal youth, though without teachers or masters to receive and study from, can attain the profound meaning of this supreme primordial yang. Having obtained this Dharma, their minds are free from stinginess and constantly expound it for beings. Thus, they are called beyond thought and conception.

Good sons, some depart through the body, not the mouth; some depart through the mouth, not the body; some depart neither through body nor mouth.

Departing through the body refers to killing, stealing, and lust—this is called departing through the body, not the mouth.

Departing through the mouth refers to refraining from false speech, slanderous talk of sutras and treatises, harsh words, divisive speech, flattery, and slander—this is called departing through the mouth, not the body.

Neither body nor mouth yet able to depart refers to departing from greed, jealousy, malice, anger, and false views.

Good sons, this is called departing neither through body nor mouth.

Good sons, not seeing any dharma as body or karma, yet able to depart from all faults—these are all evil karmas—thus, they are again called beyond thought and conception. The mouth is likewise.

Good sons, departing from the body through the body, from the mouth through the mouth, from evil through evil, from karma through karma—neither body nor mouth yet able to purify all—this is called departing.

Good sons, there is no dharma that can destroy or create. The nature of conditioned dharmas is to arise and perish differently. Thus, this wisdom cannot depart.

Good sons, wisdom cannot be broken, fire cannot burn it, water cannot drown it, wind cannot move it, earth cannot bear it, birth cannot give rise to it, aging cannot age it, dwelling cannot dwell in it, destruction cannot destroy it, greed cannot greed it, anger cannot anger it, delusion cannot delude it. Because the nature of conditioned dharmas is to arise and perish easily, the true person and immortal youth never think: "I use this wisdom to destroy afflictions." Though they say, "I destroy afflictions," it is not false. Thus, they are again called beyond thought and conception.

Wondrous Joy True Person addressed the Heavenly Venerable: Now I first understand that the true person and immortal youth deeply comprehend the treasury of Dharma, which is beyond thought and conception. The subtle and wondrous Dao Dharma, the treasury of primordial yang, and those who receive and uphold it, who analyze and elucidate its principles—such meritorious virtues are profound and weighty, beyond thought and conception.

The Heavenly Venerable said: The supreme Dao dwells near humanity—how long until it perishes?

Good sons, the supreme secret essentials of primordial yang have four kinds of contemplative practices. What are the four?

First, contemplating the body as eternally pure, unstained by filth or evil.

Second, contemplating the mind as eternally settled, without deviant thoughts.

Third, contemplating that among all dharmas, there is no self.

Fourth, contemplating all phenomena with a single, equal perception.

These are the four contemplative practices.

If my disciples can receive, uphold, read, recite, transcribe, and expound their meaning, and are revered, honored, and praised by all beings, receiving various offerings—know then that the conditions for the Dao have not perished.

Good sons, when the scriptures of primordial yang are fully circulated, at that time, many of my disciples will violate precepts, commit numerous transgressions, and fail to respect and believe in such subtle and wondrous scriptures. Due to their lack of faith, they will be unable to receive, uphold, read, recite, transcribe, or explain their meaning, nor will they be revered by others or receive offerings.

Those who see others upholding these teachings yet scorn, slander, and revile them commit the sin of arrogance toward the Dharma and are not my disciples. Know that such persons will soon face annihilation.

Miaole the Perfected again addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: "I personally received these scriptural teachings from the Sage. How can it be that merely slandering the Dao and its Dharma through arrogance leads to immediate destruction?"

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "Sages conceal their forms and entrust their traces, appearing and vanishing without fixed manner. How could mere arrogance toward the Dharma destroy them? Would they perish for such a reason? If this were the principle, how could it be justified? If they did not exist, how could one speak of the Sages as having passed away?"

"Good sons, I shall now expound this meaning again. Listen carefully with single-minded attention. There are two kinds of Dharma. What are these two? The first is worldly Dharma, and the second is the Dharma of the Supreme Meaning. Worldly Dharma may be sought, but the Dharma of the Supreme Meaning cannot be sought.

"Furthermore, there are two kinds. What are these two? The first is impermanent, without self, without joy, and without purity; the second is permanent, joyful, with self, and pure. The impermanent, without self, without joy, and without purity may manifest or conceal; the permanent, joyful, with self, and pure has no manifestation or concealment.

"Furthermore, there are two kinds of Dharma. What are these two? The first is external, and the second is internal. External Dharma may be manifested, but internal Dharma cannot be manifested.

"Furthermore, there are two kinds. What are these two? The first is conditioned, and the second is unconditioned. Conditioned Dharma may be attained, but unconditioned Dharma cannot be attained.

"Furthermore, there are two kinds. What are these two called? The first is attainable, and the second is unattainable. Attainable Dharma has a beginning and an end; unattainable Dharma has no beginning or end.

"Good sons, if my disciples receive, uphold, read, recite, transcribe, and expound the Primordial Yang scriptures, reverently make offerings, honor and praise them, worship morning and evening, and contemplate the immortals, know then that the Dao and its Dharma will flourish without end.

"Good sons, have you heard that the Perfected Youth among the Realized Ones possesses this scripture?

"Good sons, the Primordial Yang scriptures are the secret treasury of all Sages. Why is this? Although the Heavenly Worthy expounds such scriptures, he does not speak of the nature of Dharma, nor does he speak of the Heavenly Worthy’s permanence, joy, self, and purity. All Perfected Ones have not fully fathomed the subtleties of the Dao. Therefore, these scriptures are called the *Thirty-Six Revered Scriptures of the Primordial Yang’s Secret Treasury*. Because they are not expounded, they are called a treasury, just as a person’s seven treasures are not used externally and are thus called a treasury.

"Good sons, people accumulate and store treasures for future contingencies. What are these future contingencies? They include storing grain for famine years, preparing for bandits invading the borders, encountering evil leaders, ransoming lives, and alleviating hardships on difficult roads. When the time comes, they distribute their wealth to provide relief.

"Good sons, the secret treasury of the Heavenly Worthies is likewise. In future ages, when evil Daoists accumulate impure things and teach the four assemblies that the Heavenly Worthy is ultimately impermanent and that offerings are in vain, when they disrespect the scriptures—when such evils appear in the world—the Heavenly Worthy, wishing to eradicate these evils and lead beings far from perverse views, will expound these scriptures for those who make offerings to the Heavenly Worthy. When the secret treasury of these scriptures is revealed without exception, the Dao and its Dharma will flourish.

"Good sons, the Primordial Yang scriptures are eternally unchanging. Why is this difficult to comprehend? Did these scriptures exist at the time of the Primordial Beginning?

"Good sons, at the time of the Primordial Beginning, all people were pure and good, abundant in wisdom. Though their natures had not yet awakened to the true Dao, their bodies and minds were pure, gentle, and easily transformed. They possessed great virtue and unshakable retention.

"Good sons, the beings of this present age are burdened with heavy greed and desire, beset by manifold afflictions. They are foolish, forgetful, lacking in wisdom, entangled in doubts, and their roots of faith are not established. The world is impure. All beings claim that the Sages are impermanent and subject to change, ultimately entering the true Dao. Therefore, the Heavenly Worthy expounds these scriptures.

"Good sons, the Dharma of the Sages is truly inexhaustible. Why is this? Because it is eternally unchanging."

"Good sons, if there are beings who perceive a self where there is no self, and perceive no self where there is a self; who perceive permanence where there is impermanence, and impermanence where there is permanence; who perceive joy where there is no joy, and no joy where there is joy; who perceive purity where there is impurity, and impurity where there is purity; who perceive truth where there is no truth, and no truth where there is truth; who perceive the Dao where there is no Dao, and no Dao where there is Dao; who perceive arising where there is no arising, and no arising where there is arising; who perceive cessation where there is no cessation, and no cessation where there is cessation—such deluded speech about the Dao is called demonic speech. Those who take such demonic speech to be true speech, with all its cunning and manifold deceptions, should know that such people will fall into the three evil destinies, never beholding good causes, submerged for ten thousand kalpas without hope of rebirth.

"Good sons, it would be better to say that one could bind the fierce wind with a rope than to dare say that the true Dao is obscured; better to say that great lotuses bloom in the midst of a raging fire than to dare say that the true Dao is obscured; better to say that the moon can be made hot and the sun made cold than to dare say that the true Dao is obscured.

"Good sons, when a true person first emerges and attains the fruit of the primordial yang’s subtle, wondrous, supreme, and perfectly true great Dao, yet has no disciples who comprehend its profound meaning, though the sage may conceal his form and transform his appearance, know that this Dharma will long abide in the world.

"Furthermore, good sons, when a true person first attains the fruit of the great Dao and already has disciples who comprehend its profound meaning, though the sage may transform his appearance, know that this Dharma will long abide in the world.

"Furthermore, good sons, when a true person first emerges and attains the fruit of the great Dao, though he has disciples who comprehend its profound meaning, yet there are no steadfast laypeople of pure faith who revere the Dao and its Dharma, the sage will pass away—know that this Dharma will long abide in the world.

"Furthermore, good sons, when a true person first emerges and attains the fruit of the Dao, and already has disciples who comprehend its profound meaning, and there are many steadfast laypeople who revere the Dao and its Dharma, the sage will pass away—know that the true Dao will long abide in the world.

"Furthermore, good sons, when a true person first emerges and attains the fruit of the great Dao, and already has disciples who comprehend its profound meaning, and though there are steadfast laypeople who revere the Dao and its Dharma, when those disciples expound the scriptures, they do so out of greed for profit—though this is so, they will ultimately pass away, and know that this Dharma will long abide in the world.

"Furthermore, good sons, when a true person first emerges and attains the fruit of the great Dao, and already has disciples who comprehend its profound meaning, and there are faithful laypeople who revere the Dao and its Dharma, and those disciples, in all their teachings, are not greedy for profit but deliver beings and guide them to the true Dharma—though this is so, they will ultimately serve as guides, and know that this Dharma will long abide in the world.

"Furthermore, good sons, when a true person first attains the fruit of the Dao, though he has disciples who comprehend its profound meaning, and there are faithful laypeople of pure faith who revere the immortals and contemplate the Dao in their hearts, yet those disciples often engage in disputes, mutually faulting one another, the sage will pass away—know that such people will not long abide in the world.

"Furthermore, good sons, when a true person first emerges and attains the wondrous fruit, and has disciples who comprehend its profound meaning, and there are reverent laypeople who honor the Dao and its Dharma, and those disciples cultivate harmony and respect, never faulting one another but mutually cherishing and honoring each other, though the sage may pass away, know that this Dharma will long and unceasingly abide.

"Furthermore, good sons, when a true person first attains the fruit of the Dao, though he has disciples who comprehend its profound meaning, and there are reverent laypeople who honor the wondrous Dharma, and those disciples, in expounding the primordial yang’s wondrous Dharma for all beings, mutually respect one another and never engage in disputes, yet they cast aside all impure things and boast, saying, ‘I am certain to attain the fruit of the Dao’—though the sage may pass away, know that this Dharma will always abide in the world.

"Good sons, when a true person first attains the fruit of the perfectly true Dao, and already has disciples who comprehend its profound meaning, and there are moderately faithful laypeople who cherish the Dao and its Dharma, and those disciples can expound the primordial yang’s secret and profound scriptural Dharma, skillfully cultivating harmony and mutual respect, never casting aside all impure things, nor claiming that they must attain the wondrous fruit—though the sage may pass away, know that this Dharma will long abide in the world.

"Good sons, you should know: all dharmas have no fixed form, they cannot be measured or fathomed. Why is this?"

"According to the sharpness or dullness of beings’ inherent natures, the roots of their karma, and the faculties of their consciousness, some are coarse, some are subtle.

"Good sons, I now compassionately regard all beings without partiality or favoritism toward high or low, without attachment to self or others. Therefore, I now abide in the equality of the one mark, without duality or division.

"Good sons, it is like a skilled physician who administers medicine according to the root of the illness, prescribing remedies suited to the disease. The Heavenly Venerable observes the roots of beings’ afflictions and teaches them expediently, enabling them to know the scriptures and precepts and cultivate the true Dharma.

"I now save and deliver beings, removing their karmic afflictions, so that they may attain purity without remainder.

"You should now know: the sage’s abiding long in the world is not a passing away, nor does it ever cease.

"At that time, in the Primordial Yang world, the divine immortals and their retinues all attained clarity, without doubt or obstruction.

"Having attained the *dhāraṇī* of total retention and deeply comprehended the wondrous principle, the Wondrous Joy Perfected One rejoiced, praised, and reverently bowed in worship. Circumambulating seven times to the left, he spoke these verses:

The great Dao’s essence is mysterious and wondrous,
Its supreme principle most profound and subtle.
It lodges in the mark of true reality,
Adapting to the times to manifest its radiance.

Liberating all beings,
It is called the Teacher of Heaven and Humankind.
It alone compounds the wondrous medicine,
Serving as the world’s skilled physician.

Expounding the Primordial Yang’s teaching,
Its secret truth is truly worthy of reflection.
Eighty thousand disciples
All partake of its luminous majesty.

The three evil destinies are all liberated,
The five sufferings forever cease their sorrow.
Sinful spirits all return,
Hungry ghosts are fully sated.

Divine immortals now intermingle,
Jewels and jades naturally shine upon one another.
Spurring the phoenix, they journey to the Dark Capital,
Riding the simurgh, they ascend to the Purple Tenuity.

Beings, now awakened,
May hope to trust in non-action.
Today, having received this grace and love,
Their blessed fortune endures, lofty and majestic.

All the heavens rejoice in unison,
Bowing their heads in reverence before departing."

Thus concludes *The Wondrous Scripture of the Primordial Yang of the Numinous Treasure*, Scroll Six.

*The Wondrous Scripture of the Primordial Yang of the Numinous Treasure*, Scroll Seven
"Contemplation and Practice, Part Two"

At that time, the Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning was amidst the Jeweled Canopy Grove of the Primordial Yang Realm, about to withdraw from the world. He saw a king named Good Seed lying senseless upon the ground and addressed the great assembly: "I shall now remain in the world for this king, enduring countless kalpas without entering the true Dao."

Thereupon, the Third Perfected One of Primordial Yang, named Following Karma, bowed his head and respectfully addressed the Celestial Venerable: "If you remain in the world for the sake of all beings and do not enter the true Dao, why do so solely for King Good Seed?"

The Celestial Venerable replied: "Good son, among this great assembly, not one believes I shall surely enter the true Dao. King Good Seed alone is certain that I shall ultimately and eternally perish, and thus he flails and throws himself to the ground in despair. Good son, as I have declared, I remain in the world for King Good Seed and do not enter the true Dao—such is the profound and subtle meaning you have yet to comprehend. Why is this so? When I speak of remaining, it is for all ordinary beings who commit the five heinous transgressions, and again, it is for all conditioned beings. I shall never remain in the world for the sake of unconditioned beings. Why? Because the unconditioned are not beings."

King Good Seed is one replete with afflictions. Moreover, I remain in the world for those who do not perceive the nature of the Dao. Were they to perceive the nature of the Dao, I would never remain long in the world. Why is this so? Those who perceive the nature of the Dao are no longer ordinary beings. King Good Seed has yet to arouse the mind set upon the supreme, correct, and true great Dao. Furthermore, I remain for those called the nature of the Dao; King Good Seed is called the unborn, and thus does not perceive the nature of the Dao. Because he is unborn of afflictions, he perceives the nature of the Dao; by perceiving the nature of the Dao, he abides in the correct and true Dao—this is called the unborn.

Good son, the esoteric words of the Celestial Venerable are inconceivable; the mysterious and wondrous Dharma of the Dao is inconceivable; the purity of the Perfected is inconceivable; the Primordial Yang scriptures are inconceivable.

At that time, the Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning emitted the radiance of his body, adorned with eighty excellences and seventy-two marks, his light universally illuminating the realm, rendering the land cool and serene. The Primordial Yang Perfected and the great assembly of divine immortals and their retinues said to one another: "We are base and coarse, our impurities not yet exhausted—by what karmic cause do we encounter such an auspicious sign? The light emitted by the Celestial Venerable is fundamentally without origin, yet how does it suddenly arise? It is neither form nor formless, neither mark nor markless, neither non-existent nor not non-existent, neither existent nor not existent, neither white nor black, neither blue nor yellow. It is not for the sake of delivering beings that this auspicious sign appears, making visible what has form, what can be spoken of as hot or cold, blue or yellow, red or white. Though this light is thus, it truly cannot be described—by what cause does he emit this radiance?"

Then, among the assembly, a fourth Perfected named Immovable Grove replied: "This auspicious sign portends that King Good Seed’s body suffers from grave illness. He declares that in this world there are no skilled physicians to heal his body and mind, and thus the light is emitted first to heal the king’s body, then his mind."

The king said: "Perfected, does the Celestial Venerable also show partiality?"

The Perfected replied: "It is like a man with seven sons. Among these seven, one falls ill. The parents’ hearts are not unequal, yet toward the sick child, their love becomes partial. Great King, the Celestial Venerable is likewise: toward all beings, his heart is not unequal, yet toward the sinful, his love becomes partial; toward those who wander astray, he generates compassionate thoughts, while those who do not wander astray, his heart releases. Who are those who do not wander astray? They are the Celestial Venerable, the Perfected, the divine immortals, and their retinues. Among all beings, he does not regard their lineage as lowly or servile, nor their persons as base—he only regards whether beings possess a good heart. If they have a good heart, then he generates compassionate thoughts.

Great King, you should know that such an auspicious sign is the manifestation of the Celestial Venerable’s majestic virtue, which can remove the heat of afflictions from beings. Great King, you should know that the sweet dew of the Dharma is likewise. The true Dao beloved by all beings is called the sweet dew of the Dharma. It washes body and mind, enabling realization of the true Dao—this is called the skilled physician."

King Good Seed asked the fourth Perfected, Primordial Yang: "I have heard that the Celestial Venerable does not share the same abode, sit, rise, speak, laugh, or converse with evil persons, just as the great sea does not harbor corpses, and as the azure simurgh and crimson phoenix do not perch upon common trees. I observe that the Celestial Venerable is likewise. How then may we approach and see him? If we were to see him, would our bodies not sink into the earth? I observe that the Celestial Venerable would sooner draw near to tigers, wolves, lions, fierce beasts, or places of dreadful fire than approach those who commit the four or five heinous transgressions. Thus, what thoughts should I arouse in my mind to go and see the Celestial Venerable?"

The fourth Perfected, Immovable Grove, replied: "Great King, it is like one who, hungry and thirsty, seeks food and drink; like one who, ill, seeks a skilled physician; like one who, afflicted, seeks deliverance. Great King, in your quest for the fruit of the Dao, you should be likewise. Great King, the Celestial Venerable expounds the esoteric treasury of Primordial Yang even for those of perverse doubt—how much more so for you, who are not of perverse doubt, that he would not compassionately deliver you?"

The king said: "Perfected, I once heard that there are those of perverse doubt who neither believe nor listen, who cannot contemplate or grasp the meaning—why does the Celestial Venerable expound the Dharma for them?"

The Perfected replied: "Great King, it is like one who suffers from grave illness. In the night, this person dreams that his teeth and hair fall out, that he lies naked and exposed in filth, that he walks, stands, sits, and rises with the dead, hand in hand, eating and drinking, and that he passes through a road filled with venomous snakes. Upon awakening from the dream, his heart is afflicted, and because of this affliction, his bodily illness worsens. Due to the worsening illness, his family sends a messenger to summon a physician. Being poor and destitute, with no one to send, his body is stunted, his six senses incomplete, and he tells the skilled physician: 'Hurry, follow me.'

At that time, the skilled physician thinks to himself: 'Seeing this messenger, his appearance is inauspicious—I know this patient will be difficult to cure.' He further thinks: 'Though the messenger is inauspicious, I should divine whether the illness can be treated.' Thus, he observes the day, the stars, and the constellations—all are inauspicious, and so the patient will be difficult to cure. He further thinks: 'Though the day, stars, and constellations are inauspicious, I should observe the season—autumn, winter, sunset, or midnight—all are inauspicious. I know this illness will be difficult to cure.' Having thought thus, and seeing that all signs are inauspicious, though they may be uncertain, he considers the patient: if the patient has good fortune, he can be cured; if he lacks good fortune, even if the signs are auspicious, he cannot be treated. Having reflected on these matters, he immediately sets out with the messenger.

He further thinks: 'If that patient has the marks of long life, then he can be cured; if he lacks the marks of long life, then he cannot be treated.'"

Having thought thus, along the way he encountered two boys quarreling and cursing, their heads and faces streaming with blood. He saw someone carrying a great torch that suddenly extinguished itself. He saw men felling trees, or tigers and wolves and other fierce beasts. Having witnessed these things, he thought again: "All the signs I have seen are inauspicious. I know the patient will be difficult to save."

He further thought: "If I do not go, I am no true physician. Yet if I go, I cannot save him." Then he thought again: "Though all these signs are inauspicious, I am a good physician and must go to save him." Having resolved this, he heard ahead on the road the sound of wailing—people beating their breasts and striking the earth—along with the howling of dogs, the cries of birds, the roars of wild beasts, and all manner of clamorous noises shaking the land. Having heard these things, he thought again: "I know the patient will be difficult to cure."

Upon arriving at the patient’s home, he examined the illness: now cold, now hot, the head and face swollen, the body foul and putrid, the bowels and bladder obstructed, the voice gasping and labored, sleep restless. Seeing this, the physician asked the attendants: "How was the patient’s breath yesterday?" They replied: "Great master, this person was once devout and unwavering in reverence for the Three Treasures. Now, his devotion has faltered. He was once generous, but now he hoards. He once ate sparingly, but now he overindulges. He was once gentle, but now he is cruel. He was once filial and loving toward his parents, but now he shows them no respect." Hearing this, the physician knew that all signs were inauspicious and determined without doubt that the patient would die.

He said to the attendants: "I shall return for now. Tomorrow I will come again. Provide whatever the patient needs without restraint." The next day, he sent a messenger ahead, but then delayed, saying: "My affairs are not yet settled, and I have not prepared the medicine." The wise should know that such a patient will surely die.

Great King, the Heavenly Honored One is likewise: though one harbors perverse doubt, he discerns the nature of their roots and preaches the Dharma. Why? If he did not preach, all ordinary beings would say the Heavenly Honored One lacks great compassion. One with compassion is called wise. If he lacked compassion, how could he be called omniscient? The Heavenly Honored One preaches the wondrous Dharma for the sake of one perverse doubter. Great King, you should know that the Heavenly Honored One, seeing all who are ill, constantly offers wondrous medicine. If the patient does not take it, it is not that the Heavenly Honored One lacks kindness and love.

Great King, you should know that those with perverse doubt are of two kinds: those who attain good roots in the present life, and those who attain them in future lives. The Heavenly Honored One, knowing one harbors perverse doubt, preaches the Dharma for those who can attain good roots in the present, and also for those who will attain them in the future. Though it may bring no benefit now, it plants the cause for the future.

Thus, the Heavenly Honored One expounds the *Primal Yang Wondrous Sutra* for one perverse doubter, and there are two kinds: those of sharp faculties and those of middling faculties. Those of sharp faculties can attain good roots in the present life. Those of middling faculties will attain them in future lives when they encounter the Dharma.

Great King, it is like a man who has fallen into a filthy cesspit—how can he escape? A good man sees him and takes pity, seizing him by the hair and pulling him out, thus purifying him through the good man’s aid. The Heavenly Honored One’s grace and salvation are likewise: all beings have fallen into the Three Evil Paths, and he skillfully saves them, enabling them to escape the Three Evil Paths. Thus, the Heavenly Honored One expounds the *Primal Yang Treasure Repository* for one perverse doubter in the same way.

Then King Good-Seed asked the Fourth Perfected One, Impartial Grove: "If the Heavenly Honored One is truly thus, then one should choose an auspicious time and day before going." The Perfected One replied to the King: "Within the Dao’s teachings, there is no choosing of auspicious times and days. Great King, consider a gravely ill person: they do not select auspicious days or times, good or ill—they only seek a good physician. Now that your illness is grave, you seek the Heavenly Honored One, the good physician. You should not choose an auspicious time or day.

Great King, you should know that fire within wood and fire within bamboo both burn the same, with no difference. Auspicious days and inauspicious days are likewise. If one contemplates the Dao and reflects on truth, both can dissolve all karmic offenses. I only wish that you, Great King, would go swiftly today."

Then the Great King commanded a minister named Auspicious Blessing, saying: "Great minister, know that I now wish to go to the Heavenly Honored One in the Primal Yang realm. Quickly prepare all the offerings and necessities, ensuring everything is complete." The minister replied: "Great King, you wish to go to the Primal Yang realm to consult the true Dao—excellent, excellent! All the offerings and necessities are ready."

Thereupon, King Good-Seed, together with his retinue, ministers, and high officials, each adorned in pure and clean garments and with various offerings—golden-saddled steeds, all manner of carriages, banners and canopies, incense and flowers, music and entertainment, and all kinds of precious objects, nothing lacking—led a procession of tens of thousands of mounted attendants to the abode of the Heavenly Honored One in the Primal Yang realm, seeking the true Dao and wondrous medicine.

Then the Heavenly Honored One addressed the great assembly: "All ordinary beings who seek the supreme, correct, and true great Dao have no causes and conditions, nor prior good friends. Why? If King Good-Seed does not follow the Perfected One’s teachings, he will surely die within the coming month and fall into the Three Evil Paths. Therefore, to eliminate the illnesses of body and mind, nothing is better than good friends, a good physician, and wondrous medicine, which can eradicate the heavy karmic afflictions of illness."

"Great King, you should know that the *Supreme Wondrous Sutra of Primal Yang* is the excellent medicine and marvelous art for all beings. You must revere it with devotion, bow in worship, and recite it morning and evening without ceasing for years—then you shall surely attain the fruit of spontaneity."

Then the Heavenly Honored One of Primordial Beginning addressed the great assembly: "King Good-Seed still harbors doubt; I shall now resolve his mind."

At that time, among the assembly, the Sixth Perfected One of Primal Yang, named Pure Virtue, said to the Heavenly Honored One: "As previously stated, all dharmas are without fixed form—so-called form has no fixed form, so-called emptiness has no fixed form, so-called dharma has no fixed form, so-called truth has no fixed form, even the great Dao of the Unbounded has no fixed form. Why then does the Heavenly Honored One now speak of resolving King Good-Seed’s mind?"

The Heavenly Honored One replied: "Excellent, excellent! Good son, I now firmly resolve King Good-Seed’s mind. Why? If the king’s doubt can be shattered, know that all dharmas are without fixed form. Therefore, I resolve his mind—know that this mind is fixed. Good son, if the king’s mind is resolved, how can his transgressions be undone? Since there is no fixed form, his offenses may be shattered. Thus, I resolve King Good-Seed’s mind."

Then King Good-Seed proceeded to the fragrant grove beneath the towering *qian* trees and approached the Heavenly Honored One, gazing upon his majestic radiance and wondrous marks. Thereupon, the Heavenly Honored One emitted eight kinds of voices and addressed the king.

King Good-Seed looked to his left and right, asking the assembly: "Who among you is the great king? I, burdened by transgressions and devoid of merit, should not be called a king by the Heavenly Honored One."

Then the Heavenly Honored One again called out: "King Good-Seed." Upon hearing this, the king’s heart swelled with joy, and he declared: "Today, the Heavenly Honored One, out of compassion for all beings, bestows great mercy and boundless compassion, equal and without distinction."

King Good-Seed then stepped forward and said to the Heavenly Honored One: "My former doubts are now dispelled. I firmly know that the Heavenly Honored One is the supreme teacher of all beings."

At that time, the Sixth Perfected One of Primal Yang, Pure Virtue, said to the assembly: "The Heavenly Honored One has resolved King Good-Seed’s mind, allowing him to attain the natural karmic reward. His deep doubts are awakened, and his long-standing obstructions are cleared." Then, with the banners, canopies, incense, flowers, music, and offerings he held, he bowed his head in reverence, circumambulated three times to the left, and withdrew to one side.

Then the Heavenly Honored One of Primordial Beginning addressed King Good-Seed: "I shall now expound for you the wondrous method of contemplation and practice from the *Supreme Sutra of Primal Yang*, its subtle and profound meaning. You must collect your thoughts and listen attentively as I proclaim it.

All ordinary beings should constantly observe and examine their conduct in twenty matters:
First, this body and mind of mine are hollow and empty, never full.
Second, devoid of good roots, they cannot be awakened.
Third, this cycle of birth and death has not yet attained harmony."

Fourth, I have fallen into a deep pit, with no place free from fear.
Fifth, by what expedient means may I behold the true Dao?
Sixth, how should I cultivate concentration to behold the Heavenly Honored One?
Seventh, birth and death are ever suffering; there is no constancy, no self, no purity.
Eighth, the eight difficulties are hard to escape.
Ninth, I am constantly pursued by enemies.
Tenth, there is not a single good deed that can shield me from all evils.
Eleventh, I have not yet liberated myself from the three evil destinies.
Twelfth, I am replete with all manner of wicked and perverse views.
Thirteenth, I have not yet established the means to cross the ford of the five heinous transgressions.
Fourteenth, the cycle of birth and death is boundless; I have not yet attained the true path.
Fifteenth, if I do not perform deeds, I will not receive their retribution.
Sixteenth, if there is no self that acts, others will bear the fruit.
Seventeenth, without planting good causes, there will ultimately be no good effects.
Eighteenth, if one commits deeds, their fruit will never be lost.
Nineteenth, birth arises from ignorance, and death likewise follows from it.
Twentieth, in past, future, and present, I constantly act with reckless abandon.

Great King, though you are foremost among men, you should always contemplate these twenty matters regarding this body. Having made such contemplations, body and mind become pure, free from defilement, and one attains right observation. Progressing through these contemplations, observe the marks of arising, abiding, and ceasing. Likewise, observe the mind’s marks of arising, abiding, and ceasing. With mind settled, wisdom advances, and the precepts are likewise upheld. Having observed arising, abiding, and ceasing, you will know the marks of the mind and even the marks of the precepts, and will never commit evils, nor fear death or the three evil destinies.

If one does not contemplate these twenty matters with focused mind, the mind becomes reckless, and no evil remains uncommited.

King Good-Seed said: "As I understand the meaning expounded by the Heavenly Honored One, I have never before contemplated these twenty matters. Thus, I have committed many evils. Having committed evils, I now fear death and the three evil destinies. If I were to contemplate them, I would surely fall into the three wretched destinies."

The Heavenly Honored One addressed King Good-Seed: "All dharmas are by nature impermanent in their characteristics; nothing is fixed or certain. How then can you say you will surely fall into the three wretched destinies?"

King Good-Seed bowed his head and said to the Heavenly Honored One: "If all dharmas are without fixed characteristics, then my sin of killing should also be unfixed. If killing were fixed, then all dharmas would not be unfixed."

The Heavenly Honored One said: "Excellent, excellent! All true ones say that all dharmas are without fixed characteristics, and you too have understood that killing is likewise unfixed. Therefore, know that killing has no fixed characteristic.

Great King, as you have said, your father was wrongfully harmed without cause. But what is this 'father'? It is merely a provisional name for the five aggregates of sentient beings, falsely conceived as a father within the twelve dhatus and eighteen realms. What then is the father? If form is the father, the other four aggregates should not be. If the other four are the father, then form should also be. If form and the other four together constitute the father, this is impossible. Why? Because form and the non-form aggregates are by nature uncombined.

Great King, ordinary beings falsely conceive of form as a father. Yet even this form should not be harmed. Why? Form has ten aspects. Among these ten, only one aspect of form is visible and tangible, measurable, movable, and bindable. Though it may be seen and bound, its nature does not abide. Because it does not abide, it cannot be seen, grasped, measured, moved, or bound. If form is thus, how can it be killed? If form were killable, and one incurred karmic retribution for it, the other nine aspects should not be. If the other nine are not, then there should be no sin.

Great King, know that form has three phases: past, future, and present. Past and future forms cannot be harmed. Why? Because they perish in each instant. Thus, a single form may be killable or unkillable. With killing and non-killing, form is not fixed. If form is not fixed, killing is not fixed. If killing is not fixed, its retribution is not fixed. How then can you say you are destined for hell?

Great King, know that all the sins committed by sentient beings are of two kinds: light and heavy. If committed by mind and speech, they are light. If committed by body, mind, and speech, they are heavy. Great King, your thoughts and words did not involve bodily action; thus, the retribution you incur is light. In the past, you did not command killing with your words; you merely spoke of cutting off a foot without true intent. Moreover, you did not issue an edict—how then could you be fully culpable? Even the true ones should be culpable. Why? Great King, your noble birth arises from the good roots you planted in the past, born imbued with the qi of the Dao. Thus, you now occupy the royal throne. If you had not been born from good karma, you would not be a king. If you were not a king, you could not have brought harm to the kingdom. If your killing of the king-father incurs sin, then these true ones should also incur sin. If the true ones are without sin, how then can you alone be guilty?

Great King, in the past, you harbored an evil mind while hunting in the mountains. You roamed the vast wilderness but caught nothing. You saw only a perfected one, endowed with the five supernatural powers. Upon seeing him, you grew angry and resentful, thinking, 'I have hunted in vain because of this man. Drive him away!' You then ordered your attendants to kill him. As he faced death, he generated a mind of anger and hatred, lost his supernatural powers, and made this vow: 'I am innocent, yet you have wantonly slaughtered me with mind and speech. In a future life, I shall likewise harm your life with mind and speech.' Upon hearing this, you generated remorse and made offerings to his corpse."

Great King, even in such a case as this, one may incur only light retribution and not fall into hell—how much less should you, who are not like this, suffer hellish karmic consequences? The deed was first done by you, and the retribution is borne by you alone. How then can you alone incur the sin of killing?

As you say, your father the king was innocent—how then can you claim he was without fault? If one has transgressions, there is karmic retribution; if one has no evil deeds, there is no karmic retribution. If your father the former king had no transgressions, how could there be retribution? Even in the present life, Great King, you have experienced both good and evil fruits. Thus, the former king’s fate was likewise uncertain. Because it was uncertain, the act of killing was also uncertain. Since the killing was uncertain, how can you speak with certainty of falling into hell?

Great King, you should know that beings in delusion manifest four kinds of madness: first, the madness of greed, coveting all wealth and possessions; second, the madness of desire, seeking sensual pleasures to gratify the body; third, the madness of curses, harboring resentment and suspicion; fourth, the madness of karmic conditions, greedily pursuing wealth and possessions.

Great King, you should know that among my disciples are those afflicted with these four kinds of madness. Though they commit many evils, I never pronounce their fate. If one breaks the precepts under such madness, the transgression is not counted against them. If they later regain their senses, they are not said to have committed an offense.

You, Great King, were originally covetous of the kingdom and thus instigated this treasonous harm. How can such an act, born of the madness of greed, incur sin?

Great King, it is like a man who, drunk with wine, harms his own mother. Once sober, he feels remorse and regret. Know that such an act does not incur karmic retribution. You, Great King, were drunk with greed and acted against your true nature. If it was not your true nature, how can it incur sin?

It is like an illusionist at a crossroads who conjures various garments, ornaments, men and women, carriages and horses, necklaces, and robes. The foolish believe them to be real, while the wise know they are not truly existent. Killing is likewise: the common person believes it to be real, but the enlightened, with the eye of wisdom, know it is not.

Great King, you should know that it is like the echo in a mountain valley. The foolish believe it to be a real sound, while the wise know it is not. Killing is likewise: the common person believes it to be real, but the perfected ones know it is not.

Great King, it is like an enemy who feigns friendship. The foolish believe it to be genuine, while the wise discern its deceit. Killing is likewise: the common person believes it to be real, but the perfected ones know it is not.

Great King, it is like a man who sees his reflection in a mirror. The foolish believe it to be his true face, while the wise know it is not. Killing is likewise: the common person believes it to be real, but the perfected ones know it is not.

Great King, it is like a mirage in the heat. The foolish believe it to be water, while the wise know it is not. Killing is likewise: the common person believes it to be real, but the perfected ones know it is not.

Great King, it is like a city of treasures rising from the earth. The foolish believe it to be real, while the wise know it is not. Killing is likewise: the common person believes it to be real, but the perfected ones know it is not.

Great King, it is like a man who dreams of enjoying the five desires. The foolish believe it to be real, while the wise know it is not. Killing is likewise.

Great King, you should know that I fully comprehend the nature of killing, the karma of killing, its fruits, and liberation from it—thus, there is no sin. Though you know of killing, how can there be sin?

Great King, it is like a master of ceremonies who knows the properties of wine. Though he knows it, if he does not drink, he does not become drunk. Though he knows of fire, it does not burn him. You, Great King, are likewise: though you know of killing, how can there be sin?

Great King, there are beings who commit various sins when the sun rises, and when the moon rises, they engage in robbery. When the sun and moon do not rise, they commit no sins. Though the sun and moon cause them to commit sins, the sun and moon themselves incur no sin. Killing is likewise: though it arises through you, Great King, you yourself incur no sin.

Great King, you should know that in your palace, you regularly order the slaughter of sheep, yet your heart feels no fear. Why then do you feel such dread when it comes to your father, the former king? Though there is a distinction between humans and animals in status, their love of life and fear of death are no different. Why then do you treat the sheep with such lightness and indifference, while your father, the former king, fills you with deep sorrow and suffering?

Great King, the people of the world are enslaved by their attachments to servants and possessions. Driven by love, they commit acts of killing. If there is karmic retribution, it is the sin of attachment. You, Great King, are not free—how then can you be at fault?

Great King, it is like the *Sublime Scripture of Primordial Yang*: it is neither existent nor non-existent, yet it is also existent. Killing is likewise: though it is neither existent nor non-existent, it is also existent. For those with shame and remorse, it is as if non-existent; for those without shame and remorse, it is as if existent. Those who experience karmic retribution are said to be in the realm of existence.

For those with the view of emptiness, it is as if non-existent; for those with the view of existence, it is as if existent. Those with the view of existence are also said to be in the realm of existence. Why? Because those with the view of existence experience karmic consequences, while those without the view of existence do not. Those with the view of permanence are as if non-existent; those with the view of impermanence are as if existent. Those with the view of permanence cannot be said to be non-existent. Why? Because those with the view of permanence incur evil karmic retribution. Thus, those with the view of permanence cannot be said to be non-existent. For this reason, though killing is neither existent nor non-existent, it is also existent.

Great King, you should know that all beings are defined by the inhalation and exhalation of breath. To sever the inhalation and exhalation is called killing. The sages, following worldly convention, also speak of it as killing.

Great King, form is impermanent; the causes and conditions of form are also impermanent. Form arises from impermanent causes. How then can it be permanent? Even consciousness is impermanent. The causes and conditions of consciousness are also impermanent. Consciousness arises from impermanent causes.

How can the permanent arise from the impermanent, thus suffering, thus empty, thus marked by emptiness, thus devoid of self? If it is impermanent, suffering, empty, and devoid of self, then what is being killed? Through the impermanent, one attains the permanent; the sage kills suffering to obtain joy, kills emptiness to obtain reality, kills the formless to obtain the true form.

Great King, you should know that if one kills the impermanent, the suffering, the empty, and the formless, then one becomes identical with them. The act itself is like killing, yet it is impermanent, suffering, empty, and formless—thus one does not fall into hell. How then do you enter?

At that time, King Shanzhong said: As the Heavenly Venerable has expounded, contemplating form up to contemplating consciousness—having performed this contemplation, he addressed the Heavenly Venerable, saying: Now I have only just realized that form is impermanent, and that consciousness is impermanent. Had I been able to contemplate thus from the beginning, I would not have committed these transgressions.

He then bowed his head reverently and respectfully addressed the Heavenly Venerable: I once heard that sages always act as parents to all beings. Though I had heard these words, I did not fully comprehend them. Now I know with certainty that the Heavenly Venerable is truly the parent of all beings.

I also once heard that the Jade Capital Mountain is composed of four treasures—gold, silver, lapis lazuli, and agate—and that if there are many horses gathered there, they all take on the same color. Though I had heard this, I did not fully grasp its truth. Now that I have come to Jade Capital Mountain and seen that all things here share the same color, I have come to understand that the Dharma is impermanent, suffering, empty, and formless. Having performed this contemplation, I see that all dharmas are entirely impermanent. All dharmas are without root; I did not initially understand that being without root means not believing in the true Dao. Now, by good fortune, I have met the Heavenly Venerable, who has revealed profound mysteries and elucidated the true scripture. The merit thus attained can destroy the afflictions and evil minds of all beings.

The Heavenly Venerable said: Great King, excellent, excellent! Now I know that you will surely be able to dispel the evil minds of beings and break the bonds of their afflictions.

The Great King again addressed the Heavenly Venerable: If I can truly understand and destroy the evil minds of all beings, then even if I were to endure great suffering for immeasurable kalpas in the twenty-four hells of Mount Tai for the sake of all beings, I would not regard it as suffering.

At that time, there were countless worldly beings who did not believe in the true Dao and were constantly beset by perverse doubts. Upon hearing these words, foolish people all aroused the mind aspiring to the supreme, correct, and true Great Dao. Because of the boundless compassion of these innumerable people who aroused the great mind of loving-kindness, the grave transgressions of King Shanzhong were immediately diminished.

The king, his queen, and the ladies of the palace, seeing the king’s clear understanding of the marks of the Dharma and his purity of body and mind, all together aroused the mind aspiring to the supreme, natural Dao.

Then King Shanzhong addressed the Heavenly Venerable: Though I have not yet died, I have already gained deep understanding of the true essence. I have abandoned a short lifespan to attain longevity, and forsaken an impermanent body to obtain a truly permanent body. By inspiring all beings to arouse the mind aspiring to the supreme, correct, and true Dao, they attain a long lifespan and a truly permanent body, becoming true and eternal disciples of the Heavenly Venerable.

Having spoken these words, he offered the Heavenly Venerable various jeweled banners, canopies, incense, flowers, music, and all manner of exquisite treasures, garments, and adornments. He further praised the Heavenly Venerable in verse, saying:

The Heavenly Venerable’s body is profound and wondrous,
Virtue and power crown the Great Clarity.
Carefree, he strides through the Golden Gates,
At ease, he roams the Jade Capital.

Expounding the primal yang’s meaning,
The ultimate principle is most majestic.
This is called the nectar medicine,
Also named the Mahāyāna sutra.

Whether one believes or not,
Receiving and upholding it, sins naturally vanish.
Compassion saves from suffering,
Cherishing all beings with kindness.

If one can fathom its deep meaning,
One will meet in the Mystic Capital’s court.
The formless lodges in form,
The shapeless lodges in shape.

All good spiritual friends,
Must be utterly sincere.
Dwell on a single verse,
Gather the mind, sever worldly attachments.

Having parted from the bonds of affliction,
The Dao-nature naturally becomes clear.
Immortals will protect you,
Carefree, the body becomes light.

At that time, King Shanzhong, having received the Heavenly Venerable’s earnest instruction and enlightenment, together with his retinue, all awakened to the esoteric scripture of the primal yang. Deeply understanding cause and effect, they praised in verse and expressed gratitude to the Heavenly Venerable. Having paid their respects and circumambulated three times, they took their leave and returned each to their own kingdom.

Thus concludes *Scroll Seven of the Supreme Numinous Treasure Primal Yang Wondrous Scripture*.

*Scroll Eight of the Supreme Numinous Treasure Primal Yang Wondrous Scripture: The Chapter on Virtuous Conduct*

At that time, the Noble Perfected One of Supreme Virtuous Conduct of the Primal Yang, Yin Miaolin, together with his disciples and retinue—the foremost of the Eight Kinds of Wisdom—and an immeasurable assembly, gathered beneath the fragrant trees of the Qianshu Grove. Bowing their heads in reverence, they circumambulated three times, then knelt on one knee, holding tablets, and inquired of the Primordial Heavenly Venerable: "By fortune’s turn, we have encountered the Sagely Venerable. We dare to present the doubts that linger in our hearts, humbly beseeching your divine countenance to grant us instruction."

The Heavenly Venerable smiled and said, "Excellent, excellent! Profound indeed is your question. I shall resolve it as you ask."

Miaolin respectfully inquired: "Do ordinary beings who commit transgressions and grave offenses possess the Dao-nature? If such persons exist, why do they fall into hell? If they do possess the Dao-nature, why is it said there is no true and eternal bliss? If one who severs good roots is called an ordinary being, when good roots are severed, how is it that the Dao-nature is not also severed? If it is severed, why is it still said there is true and eternal bliss? If it is not severed, why is such a one called an ordinary being?"

The Heavenly Venerable replied: "Those who violate the Four Illuminated Precepts are called ‘indeterminate.’ Those who slander the *Primal Yang Sutra*, commit the Ten Evil Acts, or become ordinary beings are all termed ‘indeterminate.’ If such persons were determinate, by what cause and condition could they attain the supreme, correct, and spontaneous Great Dao, achieve the fruition of the Nine Immortals, or even become Enlightened Perfected Ones? They are also ‘indeterminate.’ If the fruition of the Nine Immortals or the state of Enlightened Perfected Ones were determinate, they would not attain the supreme, correct, and spontaneous Great Dao. If the Heavenly Venerable were to violate the Four Covenants and be ‘indeterminate,’ then the ranks of the Nine Immortals and the Enlightened Perfected Ones would also be ‘indeterminate.’ Thus, all heavenly and sagely beings would likewise be ‘indeterminate.’ If the Heavenly Venerable is ‘indeterminate,’ then the Dharma-nature of the Primal Yang—and indeed all dharmas—would also be ‘indeterminate.’ Why are they ‘indeterminate’? If an ordinary being, upon ceasing to be an ordinary being, attains the true Dao, then all heavenly and sagely beings should be the same. Having entered the ranks of the Primal Yang, they should also be able to depart from them. If this were so, the nature of the Primal Yang would be ‘indeterminate.’ Because it is ‘indeterminate,’ it should be understood that there is no true and eternal bliss. How then can it be said that ordinary beings may enter the ranks of immortals?"

At that time, the Formless Heavenly Venerable addressed the Noble Perfected One of Supreme Virtuous Conduct, Yin Miaolin: "Excellent, excellent! Good man, you ask this to benefit immeasurable ordinary beings and all sentient beings, that they may attain joy, and out of compassion and loving-kindness for all beings. You seek to nurture the spontaneous arising of the mind in all Perfected Ones and Daoists, and thus pose such questions. Good man, you have long drawn near to the Eight Kinds of Perfected Ones of the Primal Yang and have performed many meritorious deeds within the Dharma of the Heavenly Venerable. You have already attained the true Dao, and your virtues have subdued demonic adversaries, causing them to retreat. You have guided immeasurable beings to ascend to the ranks of Primal Yang immortals and comprehend the profound and wondrous scriptures of the Great Vehicle. You have inquired of the heavenly and sagely beings across as many kalpas as the sands of the Ganges. Such profound meanings I have never seen—neither in the world nor among gods or humans—even among beginning disciples who might question the Heavenly Venerable on these matters. Now, listen attentively, and I shall explain each point in detail.

"Good man, an ordinary being is also ‘indeterminate.’ If one were determinate, such an ordinary being would never attain the spontaneous Dao. Because they are ‘indeterminate,’ the Dao-nature is not severed, as you have said. How is it that an ordinary being severs good roots? Perfected One and Daoist, good roots are of two kinds: the inner Dao-nature and the outer Dao-nature. Neither inner nor outer, for this reason the Dao-nature is not severed. There are also two kinds: the defiled and the undefiled. The Dao-nature is neither defiled nor undefiled, and thus it is not severed. There are two kinds: the constant and the inconstant. The Dao-nature is neither constant nor inconstant, and thus it is not severed. If it were severed, it should be recoverable. If it cannot be recovered, it is not severed. If, once severed, it is recovered, one is called an ordinary being.

"Those who violate the Four Covenants are also ‘indeterminate.’ If they were determinate, violators of the Four Precepts would never attain the supreme, correct, and spontaneous Great Dao. Those who slander the Great Vehicle scriptures of the Primal Yang and the Three Radiant Dharma Masters are also ‘indeterminate.’ If they were determinate, slanderers of the true Dharma would never attain the wondrous spontaneous Dao. Those who commit the Ten Evil Acts are also ‘indeterminate.’ If they were determinate, evildoers would never attain the correct and true Dao.

"Form and appearance are both ‘indeterminate.’ Fragrance, taste, touch, birth, ignorance, the aggregates, sense-fields, and realms—all appearances are entirely ‘indeterminate.’

"Good man, it is like a master of illusions who, amidst a great assembly, conjures various transformations—mountains, forests, trees, cities, and villages. Among the crowd, some ordinary beings, lacking wisdom, see these and believe them to be real. The wise among them know them to be deceptive, mere illusions that delude the eyes. Good man, all ordinary beings, even the disciples of immortals and Enlightened Perfected Ones, perceive all dharmas as real in just this way. The Perfected Ones and Immortals do not see the true aspect of all dharmas.

"Good man, it is like a child in the scorching heat of summer seeing a mirage and calling it water. A wise person, seeing this heat, would never conceive of it as real water. It is but a deceptive illusion, not true water. All ordinary beings and disciples of immortals perceive dharmas in this way, believing them to be real."

The Perfected Ones of the heavens do not perceive the true aspect of all dharmas. Good man, it is like the echo in a mountain valley—ordinary beings hear it and believe it to be a real sound, while the wise understand there is no fixed reality, only the sound’s appearance deluding the ear’s perception. Good man, all ordinary beings and disciples of immortals perceive all dharmas in this way, seeing them as having true aspects. The Perfected Ones of the heavens clearly understand that all dharmas are without true aspect, perceiving the marks of impermanence, emptiness, and quiescence, without marks of arising or cessation. For this reason, the Perfected Ones and Daoist adepts see all dharmas as impermanent.

Good man, there is also a fixed aspect—what is this fixed aspect? The true and constant bliss—where does it reside? It is said to be within the primordial yang dharma. Good man, the natural fruit is also not fixed. Because it is not determined, after a hundred thousand kalpas, one attains the natural mind of the supreme great Dao. Yet even this Dao-fruit is not real, for it is not fixed in reality. After eighty thousand kalpas, one attains the natural mind of the true and perfect great Dao. The fruit of the Perfected One is also not real, for it is not fixed in reality; after sixty thousand kalpas, one attains the supreme mind of the Dao. The fruit of the immortal is also not real, for it is not fixed in reality; after forty thousand kalpas, one attains the supreme mind of the Dao. The fruit of the enlightened Perfected One is also not real, for it is not fixed in reality; after twenty thousand kalpas, one attains the supreme mind of the Dao.

Good man, the Heavenly Venerable now, beneath the azure forest trees of the Sweet Dew Great City, manifests awe-inspiring virtue, divine powers, and wisdom, causing the disciples of immortals and all ordinary beings to wholeheartedly uphold the dharma, sincerely submit to the truth, and recite the profound and mysterious meanings of the supreme Mahāyāna scriptures of primordial yang. Thus they attain the supreme, true, and natural great Dao, cultivate the sagely practices, and never regress.

Good man, ordinary beings who do not properly restrain the six senses will have leaks and be led by evil to unwholesome places. Good man, it is like a fierce and unruly horse that brings its rider to perilous places. Those who do not properly restrain the six senses through evil karma are likewise led far from the wondrous Dao of primordial yang to evil destinations. It is like an untamed mad elephant—if someone rides it, it will not go where intended, but instead strays far from good towns to dangerous places. Those who do not properly restrain the six senses through evil karma are likewise led far from the good towns of primordial yang into the perilous wilderness of birth and death.

Good man, it is like a treacherous minister who teaches the king to do evil—the six senses, like treacherous ministers, constantly lead beings to commit boundless evils. Good man, it is like a stubborn child who ignores the teachings of parents and teachers and commits all manner of evil. Those who do not discipline the six senses are likewise unwilling to accept the good instructions of parents and teachers, committing every kind of evil.

Good man, ordinary beings who do not restrain the six senses are constantly harmed by hell-dwellers, animals, and hungry ghosts, just as enemies and thieves harm the good. Ordinary beings who do not restrain the six senses gallop through the six dusts like a careless cowherd whose cattle trample others’ crops. Ordinary beings who do not guard the six senses constantly remain in the cycle of existence, suffering manifold afflictions.

Good man, when Perfected Ones and Daoist adepts cultivate the sagely practices of the supreme Mahāyāna of primordial yang, they constantly and skillfully discipline and guard the six senses, fearing greed, anger, jealousy, and arrogance, all for the sake of attaining all dharmas. Good man, if one can guard the six senses, one can guard the mind; if one can guard the mind, one guards the six senses. It is like someone who protects the king and defends the kingdom—guarding the kingdom means guarding the king. Perfected Ones and Daoist adepts are likewise: if they can hear the supreme Mahāyāna scriptures of primordial yang, they attain wisdom; having attained wisdom, they can then strictly guard the six senses.

Good man, it is like a good cowherd—if the cattle stray and eat others’ crops, he can stop them and prevent them from damaging things. Perfected Ones and Daoist adepts are likewise: through the causes and conditions of mindfulness and wisdom, they guard the six senses and do not allow them to run wild. Perfected Ones and Daoist adepts who possess mindfulness and wisdom do not perceive the mark of self, the mark of sentient beings, or the mark of what is enjoyed; they see all dharmas as sharing the same dharma-nature. They perceive the forms of mountains, grasses, trees, tiles, and pebbles as like houses—arising from causes and conditions, without fixed nature. Seeing all ordinary beings and sentient beings as constituted by the four great elements, they discern there is no fixed nature. Because there is no fixed nature, the Perfected Ones do not generate attachment. Ordinary beings, seeing sentient beings, thus give rise to afflictions. Perfected Ones and Daoist adepts who cultivate the scriptures of primordial yang, possessing mindfulness and wisdom, do not generate attachment to sentient beings.

Again, Perfected Ones and Daoist adepts who cultivate the scriptures of primordial yang do not cling to the marks of sentient beings or create various dharmas. Good man, it is like a painter who, using various colors, depicts cows, horses, men, and women—ordinary beings without wisdom see them and conceive the marks of men and women, but the painter knows there are no marks of men, women, cows, or horses. Perfected Ones and Daoist adepts are likewise: observing the different marks of dharmas as one mark, they never conceive the thought of sentient beings. Why? Because they possess mindfulness and wisdom.

Perfected Ones and Daoist adepts who cultivate the supreme Mahāyāna scriptures of primordial yang, when they sometimes behold beautiful women, never generate a mind of attachment. Why? Because they skillfully observe marks. Good man, Perfected Ones and Daoist adepts know the marks of the five desires—there is no joy in them, no lasting abiding. They are like a dog gnawing a dry bone, like a man carrying fire against the wind, like bubbles on water or drawings on its surface, like woven threads or paintings, like a prisoner going to the market, like borrowed power that cannot bring lasting joy. The desires are likewise, full of manifold faults.

Furthermore, Perfected Ones and Daoist adepts observe that all ordinary beings and sentient beings, on account of form, fragrance, flavor, and touch, have endured suffering and affliction for kalpas without measure. For each sentient being, the bones accumulated in a single kalpa would tower as high as Mount Sumeru; the milk they have drunk would equal the waters of the four seas; and the blood they have shed would be even greater. Among their six kinds of kin and relatives, when one dies and they weep, the tears they shed would surpass the four great seas. Even if all the grasses and trees on earth were made into counting rods, they could not tally the number of one’s parents. For kalpas uncountable, some have languished in the Three Wretched Realms or the dark prisons of hell, enduring sufferings beyond reckoning.

Perfected Ones and Daoist adepts, contemplating all sentient beings so profoundly, see that on account of desire they suffer boundlessly. Thus, in the cycle of birth and death, Perfected Ones practice goodness without losing mindfulness and wisdom. Good man, it is like a great assembly filling an area of thirty *li*, where a king named Majestic commands a minister named Wealthy Grove to carry a large basin of oil through the crowd without spilling a single drop, on pain of execution. He also dispatches another minister named Forest Governor to follow behind with drawn sword, keeping watch. The minister carrying the oil, having received the king’s command, holds it with utmost care. Though he passes through the crowd and sees beautiful women, he dares not look at them. His heart trembles with fear: if he were to grow lax and become attached to that perverse desire, he would drop what he carries and fail to preserve his life. Such is his terror that he does not dare spill even a single drop of oil.

Perfected Ones and Daoist adepts, firmly upholding the precepts, are likewise: in the cycle of birth and death, they do not lose mindfulness and wisdom. Because they do not lose this cause, though they see the five desires, their minds do not cling to them. When they see pure forms, they do not generate the mark of form; they only observe the mark of suffering. Likewise with the mark of perception and the other marks: they do not create the mark of arising, nor the mark of ceasing, nor the mark of cause, nor the mark of condition. They observe all dharmas as the mark of harmony.

At that time, because the six senses of Perfected Ones and Daoist adepts are pure, their precepts are complete. All ordinary beings, whose six senses are not at peace, cannot restrain and uphold them—they are called “leaky roots.” Perfected Ones and Daoist adepts forever sever all leaks, and thus are without leakage. The Heavenly Worthy pulls them out, forever removing the karmic roots of the senses, and they attain purity.

Then the Perfected One, Exquisite Grove, having heard this, rejoiced in his heart and spoke these verses:

Ordinary beings and all sentient beings,
Not knowing the purport of the Mahāyāna,
Sink in the river of birth and death,
Treading the steps of affliction again and again.
Thought after thought, they commit evils;
Mind after mind, they arouse doubt and awakening.
Māras and demons assail them with expedient means,
And adversaries bring forth litigation.
They receive retribution and descend to hell,
Imprisoned in dark cells, bound fast.
All their karmic offenses
Cannot be likened even with counting rods.
One should bear in mind the Primordial Yang Sutra,
Receive and uphold the precepts and the Dharma.
Transgressions may thus be dissolved,
And blessings and virtues pour down like rain.
Liberation is the gate of the Mahāyāna;
The path is pure and non-active.
Heavenly immortals constantly guide them,
And earth spirits ever protect them.
If one recites such verses day after day,
Through kalpas they will be free from sorrow,
And throughout the year, no decay or harm.
In perilous and difficult places,
They will have no fear.
Receive sincerely the verses of the Five Penetrations,
And firmly uphold the Six Perfections.
Today I speak this hymn,
Which may serve as a rhapsody of eternal joy.

The Perfected One, Exquisite Grove, having spoken these verses, continued:

Furthermore, good man, there are those who have departed from leakage—Perfected Ones and Daoist adepts who, for the sake of the unsurpassed ambrosial Dharma-realm, leave behind all evil leaks. For what reason is it called “departing”? If one can practice the supreme Mahāyāna scriptures of primordial yang, receive, uphold, read, and recite them, and contemplate their meaning, this is called “departing.” Why? Good man, I do not see among the thirty-six revered scriptures any that can remove evil leaks like this Mahāyāna sutra.

Good man, it is like a good teacher instructing disciples: among them, those who receive the teaching do not create transgressions. Perfected Ones and Daoist adepts who cultivate the supreme Mahāyāna scriptures of primordial yang are likewise—they do not create transgressions. Good man, it is like in the world there are spells and incantations: if there is a poisonous snake, it cannot harm them. All ordinary beings who read and recite this sutra, even until the end of their lives, will have no transgressions. Good man, this great Primordial Yang Sutra is likewise.

If there are sentient beings who hear even once such a sutra as this, they will not fall into evil destinies. If there are those who copy, praise, read, recite, explain, or analyze its subtle wonders, they will attain the unsurpassed, correct, and natural Great Dao, together with the Dharma-mark of its embodiment, just as the sages attain the ambrosial flavor of the Dharma. Good man, the majestic power of this great Primordial Yang—through cultivation, reading, and recitation—brings forth such fruition of the Way.

Good man, if there are faithful disciples who wholeheartedly copy, read, and recite this sutra, explain its meaning, and for others expound and teach it to transform sentient beings, know that such a person is truly my disciple. They know the Dharma-teaching well, instruct and admonish ordinary beings, and attain the Dharma of the Way. They are those I see, those I pity—such a person truly knows the Primordial Yang scriptures I speak.

Wherever such a person dwells—whether in mountains, forests, open wilderness, cities, villages, houses, or palaces—I too am there, constantly abiding without change. I always accept offerings from this person, sometimes appearing as a Daoist adept or a female Daoist. Good man, good woman, you should let such people know that the Heavenly Worthy accepts their offerings of wealth and treasure.

Good man, if such a person, while sleeping, dreams of the Heavenly Worthy’s sacred form, or sees the images of Perfected Ones, the form of a Wheel-Turning Sage King, or mountains, rivers, great seas, the sun, moon, and stars, or gold, silver, and precious jewels, clothing, and bedding, know then that it is the Heavenly Worthy accepting their offerings.

Upon awakening from such dreams, one attains great joy and bliss, soon obtaining all manner of needed things. No transgressions arise, and one’s aspirations remain truly good. The Primordial Yang fully accomplishes such boundless merits, inconceivable in their vastness.

Good man, you must now receive and uphold the subtle teachings of the Dharma: If any good man practices wholesome deeds, reveres me, aligns with the marks of the Dharma, and upholds its essentials—thereby shattering the evil demons of impermanence, suffering, non-self, and impurity—desiring the carefree joy of heaven or the human realm, then upon seeing one who receives, upholds, copies, recites, or explains the meaning of the Primordial Yang scriptures, you should draw near, reverently bow, praise and honor them, and provide for their needs, ensuring nothing is lacking. This scripture is profound and wondrous, beyond all comparison. You must serve it with wholehearted devotion, without retreat or weariness, and you shall attain the natural fruit of the Dao.

Good man, I recall in the past, across kalpas as numerous as the sands of the Ganges, there was a world called Pure Clarity. There lived a sage named Wenshi Heavenly One, whose divine powers and wisdom were unmatched, and whose celestial eye was supreme. He expounded the *Primordial Yang Upper Grade Mahāyāna Sūtra* to the great assembly. At that time, I followed him.

Good man, when I heard that this sage would reveal the supreme flavor of the unsurpassed meaning to the assembly, my heart rejoiced, and I wished to make an offering. Yet my family was poor, possessing nothing, so I resolved to sell myself. But I feared my strength would fail, and no one would buy me. In that moment, I encountered a man on the road and said to him, “I wish to sell myself. Would you buy me?” The man replied, “In my household, there is labor no one can perform. If you are capable, I shall buy you.” I then asked, “What labor is it that no one can perform?” He answered, “I suffer from a grave illness. A skilled physician prescribed medicine requiring two ounces of human flesh daily. If you can provide an ounce of your flesh each day, I shall pay you ten coins of gold.” Upon hearing this, my heart filled with joy. I said to him, “Grant me the coins, and after five days, when my affairs are settled, I will come to you.” He replied, “Five days is too long. Let it be one day.”

Good man, at that time, I took the coins and went to the Heavenly Worthy’s abode. I bowed in reverence and offered all my family’s possessions. Then, with wholehearted devotion, I listened to the recitation of the scripture. Though my mind was dull, upon hearing it, I vowed to uphold these verses:

*The Heavenly Worthy speaks the essential,*
*Called the Primordial Yang Sūtra.*
*It liberates from the karma of birth and death,*
*And illumines the depths of darkness.*
*Those with wholehearted devotion*
*Shall attain a radiant, enlightened mind.*
*Their hearts gain supreme bliss,*
*And they tread the courts of the Mystic Capital.*
*Carefree, they follow the path of feathered transcendence,*
*Ascending and descending through the clouded gates.*
*In the turning wheel, they meet emptiness and stillness,*
*And in an instant, behold the true form.*
*The Southern Elixir ascends to its celestial abode,*
*While the Northern Dipper dispels the star of death.*
*Knowing I am moved by the wondrous Dao,*
*Through kalpas, I shall not sink into obscurity.*

After receiving and upholding these verses, my heart gained understanding. I then returned to the sick man’s home. Good man, though I daily provided two ounces of my flesh, through reciting the verses, I felt no suffering. Good man, by this cause and condition, his illness was cured, and I, too, was restored—my body’s skin and flesh fully intact, without wounds, scars, or foulness. I then aroused the unsurpassed, correct, and natural mind of the Dao.

The power of these verses is thus mighty. How much more so, then, is the *Primordial Yang Mahāyāna Sūtra* expounded by the Heavenly Worthy, the Great Sage? One who fully receives and upholds it, reciting it with wholehearted devotion, shall gain such benefits. Witnessing the merits of this scripture, I resolved to redouble my recitation, vowing that in the past, future, and present, I would attain the natural fruit of the Dao.

Good man, by the cause and condition of these verses, I now proclaim the wondrous *Primordial Yang Sūtra* to all disciples in this assembly. Good man, by this cause and condition, the great Primordial Yang is inconceivable, accomplishing boundless true and wholesome conditions—it is the esoteric treasury of all heavenly sages. For this reason, those who receive, uphold, read, and recite it sever all evil defilements.

What are these evils? The mad elephant, the vicious horse, the fierce ox, the savage dog, perilous cliffs and treacherous valleys, poisonous insects and ferocious beasts, raging rivers and cascading torrents, and wicked companions. If such evils become the cause of defilement, the Perfected One departs from them at once. If they do not, then he does not distance himself. If defilements increase, he leaves them; if they do not, he remains. If evil deeds arise, he abandons them; if good deeds are done, he does not depart. He constantly protects himself with wisdom, cultivating wholesome deeds and forsaking evil.

The Perfected One and Daoist adept observe their own bodies, seeing them as a great mass of suffering, the root of all evil karma. Though the body is impure, the Perfected One still examines and regards it. Why? Not out of attachment to the body, but for the sake of wholesome dharmas, for the Primordial Yang, not for birth and death, for true and constant bliss, not for impermanence and non-self. For the sake of the pure and the Dao, not for the absence of the Dao; for the One Vehicle, not for the Three Vehicles.

Good man, the Perfected One and Daoist adept must always protect their bodies. Why? If the body is not protected, life is not preserved. If life is not preserved, one cannot read, recite, copy, uphold, or make offerings to the *Primordial Yang Upper Grade Mahāyāna Sūtra*, nor explain its meaning to others or contemplate its truths. Therefore, the Perfected One and Daoist adept must diligently protect their bodies. By this principle, the Perfected One is freed from all evil defilements.

Good man, just as one who wishes to cross water must carefully protect their boat, raft, or vessel, and just as a traveler on the road must carefully guard their mount, or as a farmer sowing seeds must mindfully tend to manure and filth—so too must the Perfected One and Daoist adept, though they see this body as replete with boundless impurities, refrain from slackness or weariness in wholesome deeds for the sake of upholding the *Primordial Yang Sūtra*.

The Perfected One and Daoist adept regard the mad elephant and the wicked person as no different—why? Because both destroy the body. Yet while the Perfected One feels no fear near the mad elephant, they cultivate dread and caution toward evil companions—why? The mad elephant can only harm the body, not the mind, whereas the wicked can destroy both. The mad elephant ruins but a single impure body, while the wicked ruin countless virtuous bodies and minds. The mad elephant harms only the defiled body, but the wicked shatter the pure body and pure mind. The mad elephant destroys the physical form, while the wicked break the Dharma-body. The slaying by a mad elephant does not lead to the three destinies, but the killing by the wicked assuredly does. Thus, the mad elephant is but an enemy to the body, while the wicked are foes to wholesome dharmas.

Therefore, the Perfected One must always shun all unwholesome companions and the wicked. Ordinary people, unable to distance themselves from mad elephants or the wicked, thus generate defilements; but the Perfected One and Daoist adept, by keeping far from them, do not.

If even the Perfected One remains free from defilements, how could the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, possessed of great majesty and numinous power, bear any? For what reason would one draw near to defilements? All ordinary beings, in seeking clothing, food, bedding, medicine, and fine flavors for the pleasure of body and mind, pursue such things and thereby commit transgressions. Unaware of the flavor of Dharma, they revolve through the three destinies—this is what constitutes defilement. The Perfected One and Daoist adept, perceiving such transgressions, thus keep far from them.

When they require clothing or food, they accept it not for the body’s sake but for the sake of Dharma. They do not grow arrogant or careless but maintain a gentle and humble mind, not for ostentation but for modesty. Though they partake of food and drink, their minds remain free from attachment, not for the body’s sake but always for the sake of the true Dharma. Not for the flesh but for sentient beings. Not out of arrogance but to sustain their strength. Not to cause harm but to remedy hunger and thirst. Even when they obtain the finest flavors, their hearts remain free from craving. The same applies to the acceptance of clothing.

They do not allow the fetters of greed and pride to dwell in their minds, seeking not longevity but the eternal life of Dharma. Good man, they reflect thus: *If I do not accept such offerings, my body will waste away and lack strength. Without strength, I cannot endure hardship; without endurance, I cannot cultivate the true Way. But if I endure hardship, I can cultivate the true Way and attain boundless virtue. If I cannot bear these sufferings, I will give rise to anger amid hardship, to craving amid pleasure, and to ignorance when pleasure is unobtainable. Thus do ordinary beings generate defilements from offerings.*

The Perfected One and Daoist adept, through profound contemplation, do not generate defilements—hence they are called "undefiled." For what reason would the Heavenly Worthy be called "defiled"? Therefore, the sage is not called "defiled."

Good man, though all ordinary beings may be said to protect body and mind, they still give rise to evil thoughts. For this reason, even if they sever afflictions and attain the state of neither perception nor non-perception, they ultimately fall into the three evil destinies. Good man, it is like one who, crossing a vast sea, seeks the far shore but drowns at the brink of arrival. So too do the foolish: on the verge of exhausting the three realms of existence, they fall back into hell. Why? Because they lack wholesome wisdom.

What is wholesome wisdom? It is what is called the six recollections. Ordinary beings possess a feeble and inferior good mind, while their unwholesome impulses rage fiercely. Because their good mind is feeble and inferior, their wisdom is slight and scant. And because their wisdom is scant, they increase all defilements.

The Perfected One and Daoist adept, with pure wisdom-eye, perceive all faults and harms—these manifest in manifold ways, ever opposing all ordinary beings as adversaries of the Three Vehicles. For this reason, they cause ordinary beings to fail in seeing the marks of the Dharma, and for kalpas as numerous as the sands of the Ganges, to generate inverted thoughts, claiming that the gods and sages possess no true constancy or bliss, that only purity exists, and that the Heavenly Worthy is ultimately void and empty.

All ordinary beings, being impermanent, devoid of bliss, impure, and without self, yet with inverted minds, assert the existence of true bliss. The Perfected One and Daoist adept should contemplate thus: all Perfected Ones, at times due to certain conditions, ought to arouse vigilance, just as a person of uprightness, purity, and cleanliness does not accept filth and defilement, like one who grasps an iron pellet—none would receive it.

Good man, those who wholeheartedly devote themselves to the Dao are likewise bound by such conditions. The Perfected One and Daoist adept reflect: all ordinary beings know me as a vast field of blessings. How then could I accept such evil? If I were to accept evil dharmas, I would be unworthy of serving as a field of blessings for all ordinary beings. Though I myself do not claim to be a good field of blessings, all ordinary beings, upon seeing my appearance, would say that I have generated such evil thoughts, thereby deceiving all ordinary beings. At the time of the Dharma, due to this deception, I would wander in the cycle of birth and death for kalpas as numerous as the sands of the Ganges, falling into hell.

If I harbor evil thoughts and accept offerings made in reliance upon me, all sages would bear witness to this. If I entertain evil thoughts and accept offerings made in reliance upon me, I may cause the donor’s karmic retribution to become meager or even nonexistent. If I am evil and accept offerings made in reliance upon me, I become a great enemy to the donor.

All ordinary beings constantly direct good thoughts and recollections toward me. How then could I deceive them and generate evil thoughts? For what reason? It may cause the donor to fail in accruing meritorious karma or to receive scant retribution. I constantly proclaim myself a Daoist adept. A Daoist adept ought not to generate evil; if one does, one is no Daoist adept. The essence of the Daoist adept lies in the harmony of body and speech. If they are not in harmony, one is no Daoist adept.

I have abandoned affection, family, companions, and kin to leave the household life and study the Dao, cultivating right mindfulness and gathering wholesome thoughts—this is not the time to gather unwholesome thoughts. It is like one who crosses the sea in search of treasure but forsakes the true pearl to take mere gold dust; or like one who abandons exquisite music to listen to harsh sounds.

As one who abandons the main chamber to love a mere concubine; as one who forsakes golden vessels to take clay bowls; as one who discards the sweet dew of the Dharma’s flavor to consume poisonous fare; as one who leaves good men to befriend evil companions; as one who rejects a skilled physician to trust in shamans and spirits; as one who abandons the sweet Dharma-food of the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning to partake of the varied bitter flavors of demonic enmity—

I have now encountered the pure and luminous Dharma-treasure of Primordial Yang, so rarely seen or heard, as a blind turtle chances upon a great floating log. Human life is perilous and fragile, like an autumn leaf; having attained deliverance today, how could I know when enlightenment will dawn?

How then could I indulge the six senses and commit evil deeds? Youth and vigor pass in but a moment. How could I allow arrogance to arise? Like a demon lying in wait for human faults, or the four great malevolent spirits shaking the sovereign of the body, so too do they ever seek my transgressions. How could I permit evil thoughts to arise?

Like a crumbling wall, my life too stands on the verge of collapse. How could I give rise to evil karma? I am called a Daoist adept, one who ought to comprehend all things—how then do I commit unwholesome deeds? How can I still be called a Daoist adept? I am called one who has left the household life; one who leaves the household life is called one who cultivates the good Dao—how then do I commit evil? How can I be called one who has left the household?

I am called a true person; the essence of a true person is to shatter afflictions—yet I do not shatter evil thoughts and afflictions. How then can I be called a true person? The world possesses six roots, which are difficult to perfect; I have now perfected them. How could I allow evil thoughts to dwell in my mind? What are these six?

The six are: first, the great Dao is difficult to encounter; second, the true Dharma is difficult to behold; third, the arising of a good mind is difficult; fourth, birth in the central land is difficult; fifth, encountering the human realm is difficult; sixth, the faculties of the body are difficult to complete. These six roots are difficult to perfect, yet I have perfected them—therefore, I ought not to give rise to evil thoughts.

When a true person cultivates the *Primordial Yang Sutra* in this manner, they must constantly observe all evil thoughts. Ordinary beings do not see the faults and harms of such evil thoughts and thus incur the defilements. The true person, having seen them, does not accept or become stained by them; therefore, the true person is free from defilements. How then could one say the Celestial Worthy is defiled? For this reason, all sages are not defiled.

Thereupon, the celestial perfected ones, immortals, and Daoist adepts, having heard this matter, rejoiced, paid homage, and with reverence spoke these verses:

We, this great assembly,
Have heard the subtle and profound meaning,
Each awakening to the nature of suffering and emptiness,
Deeply comprehending the wisdom of Primordial Yang.

Were we not scholars of the utmost learning,
How could we discern truth from falsehood?
We sever all afflictions,
Dispelling anger and hatred.

Men and ordinary beings,
Listen carefully to this true and good analogy,
Wash clean the illnesses of body and mind,
The filth, evil, and defilements.

All the divine immortals
Bow their heads in praise of this auspicious teaching.

Thus concludes *The Wondrous Sutra of the Numinous Treasure of Primordial Yang*, Scroll the Eighth.
*The Wondrous Sutra of the Numinous Treasure of Primordial Yang*, Scroll the Ninth.

At that time, the Most High Lord of the Primordial Beginning addressed the Perfected One of Primordial Yang, saying: "Good sons and good daughters, if there are those who cultivate and make offerings to *The Wondrous Sutra of the Numinous Treasure of Primordial Yang*, they shall attain ten kinds of virtue and power—unfathomable, astonishing to those who hear of them.

Neither hidden nor manifest, neither departing nor arriving, neither arising nor ceasing, neither difficult nor easy, neither form nor non-form, such are the characteristics of this Dharma. It has no shape or appearance, and is absent from the world.

What are the ten kinds of virtue and power? First, there are five. What are these five?

1. What was unheard before can now be heard.
2. Having heard the profound and wondrous, one can bring benefit.
3. One can sever all doubts and embody the ultimate principle.
4. The mind of wisdom is upright and without crookedness.
5. One deeply knows the secret treasury of Primordial Yang.

These are the five matters.

What is meant by 'what was unheard before can now be heard'? It refers to the most profound and wondrous meaning: all sentient beings possess the nature of the Dao, and all scriptures and Dharmas are without distinction. If good sons and good daughters, with sincere aspiration, dedicate themselves to the ultimate realization of the Dharma, they shall enter the supreme, correct, and true Dao—abiding without change, ever without retreat.

Neither conditioned nor unconditioned, neither defiled nor undefiled, neither form nor formless, neither empty nor non-empty, neither named nor unnamed, neither characterized nor uncharacterized, neither existent nor non-existent, neither cause nor non-cause, neither fruit nor non-fruit, neither luminous nor non-luminous, neither dark nor non-dark, neither emerging nor non-emerging, neither impermanent nor non-impermanent, neither severed nor non-severed, neither past nor non-past, neither future nor non-future, neither dependent origination nor non-dependent origination. Such Dharmas are most profound, most wondrous, most mysterious, most abstruse—what was unheard before is now heard, what was unseen before is now seen.

All scriptures, all methods, all arts and skills, all disciplines and precepts—such teachings, never heard before, are now fully comprehended through this sutra. Furthermore, the secret essentials of the Three Clarities and the divine charts of the Seven Divisions—such profound and abstruse meanings are now known through this sutra.

Good sons and good daughters, this is what is meant by 'what was unheard before can now be heard.' Having heard it, this is the great benefit. If one can recite, uphold, and embody the natural intent of the Dao, one will fully comprehend all methods and the profound meaning of the Mahayana scriptures.

It is like a person gazing into a bright mirror, seeing their reflection clearly without obstruction. The precious mirror of Primordial Yang is likewise: when the Perfected One holds it, they behold the profound and abstruse meaning of the Primordial Yang scriptures. It is also like a person in a dark room holding a great torch, seeing all things clearly. The torch of the Primordial Yang Dharma is likewise: when the Perfected One holds it, they behold the profound mysteries of Primordial Yang.

It is also like the sun rising from the Valley of Light, radiating great illumination, fully illuminating all, enabling one to see far into the empty sky. The pure sun of wisdom of the Great Primordial Yang is likewise: it illuminates the deepest and most obscure places, enabling all sentient beings to see the true Dao from afar. Why is this so? By listening to and receiving this supreme and wondrous sutra of Primordial Yang, all attain the supreme fruit of the Dao.

Good sons, if one wholeheartedly recites the subtle and wondrous scriptures of Primordial Yang, one will know the names of all Dharmas, penetrate their profound meanings, and expound them widely to others, awakening ordinary beings and enabling them to understand the ultimate principles of the Primordial Yang Dharmas. Good sons, those who listen may know the words of the Primordial Yang scriptures but not their profound meaning. If one copies, upholds, recites, and expounds them to others, guiding the deluded to understand their meaning, then one will know their meaning—this is the great benefit, increasing the bridge of the Dharma.

Furthermore, good sons, those who listen to this sutra may hear of the Dao and its methods but not yet see them. With sincere aspiration, they shall attain comprehension. By copying, reciting, and expounding it to others, contemplating its meaning, they shall come to see it. Those who listen to the Primordial Yang sutra may hear of divine powers but not yet see them. With aspiration and longing for immortality, after forming such thoughts, they shall know the Dharma, embody the intent of the Dao, and penetrate its source. In places feared by heavenly demons, evil spirits, tigers, wolves, and poisonous beasts, they shall be without fear. They shall elucidate and distinguish jade tablets and golden texts, cinnabar chapters and purple characters, expounding their meaning without error. Without hearing from others, they shall know for themselves the intent of the supreme, correct, and true Dao. This is what is meant by 'having heard the profound and wondrous, one can bring benefit.'

Furthermore, in severing doubts, there are two kinds: doubt regarding names and doubt regarding meanings. Those who listen to this sutra sever their doubting minds. Those who contemplate its meaning sever their doubt regarding its meaning.

Moreover, good sons, there are five kinds of doubt:
1. Doubt whether the Dao’s emptiness has a definite referent.
2. Doubt whether the Dao’s elusive nature is truly eternal.
3. Doubt whether the Dao’s secrecy is truly blissful.
4. Doubt whether the Dao’s profundity is truly pure.
5. Doubt whether the Dao’s manifestation or concealment is its true meaning.

Those who listen to this sutra shall forever sever their doubting minds. By copying, reciting, expounding it to others, and contemplating its meaning, the five doubts shall be forever severed.

Furthermore, good sons, there are three kinds of doubt:
1. Doubt whether the supreme, correct, and true Dao is conditioned or unconditioned.
2. Doubt whether the thirty-six revered scriptures are conditioned or unconditioned.
3. Doubt whether all wondrous Dharmas are conditioned or unconditioned."

Those who hear this sutra shall forever extinguish these three doubts without remainder. By copying, reciting, expounding it widely to others, and contemplating its meaning, they shall come to understand that all sentient beings possess the Dharma-nature.

Furthermore, good sons, if there are sentient beings who have not heard this *Primordial Yang* scripture, their doubts shall be manifold—doubting whether things are eternal or not eternal, blissful or not blissful, pure or not pure, possess a self or not, possess a lifespan or not, are ordinary beings or not, are ultimate or not ultimate, pertain to the future or not, exist or not, are suffering or not, are bliss or not, are the Dao or not, are cessation or not, are Dharma or not, are real or not. Those who hear this sutra shall sever all such delusions.

Furthermore, good sons, if there are those who have not heard this sutra, there are also various sentient beings beset by many doubts: Is form the self? Do sensation, perception, mental formations, and consciousness arise interdependently? Is form the self? Is the eye the seer, or am I the seer? ... Is consciousness the knower, or am I the knower? Does form receive retribution, or do I receive retribution? ... Does consciousness receive retribution, or do I? Does form reach other realms, or do I? ... And so too with consciousness. Does the cycle of birth and death have a beginning and an end, or is it beginningless and endless? Those who hear this sutra shall forever sever all such doubts.

There are also those who doubt: Do those who hold wrong views, violate the Four Pledges, commit the Five Heinous Crimes, or slander the Dao and its scriptures possess the Dharma-nature or not? Those who hear this sutra shall forever sever all such doubts.

There are also those who doubt: Does the world have boundaries or not? Does the ten-directional Dharma-realm exist or not? Those who hear this sutra shall also sever all such doubts. This is called severing the mind of doubt and delusion.

Furthermore, good sons, those with wisdom and upright minds free from perversity—if their minds harbor doubt, their vision shall not be correct. All sentient beings, if they do not hear this *Primordial Yang* supreme and wondrous scripture, shall perceive with perverse doubt, even the lowest immortals who awaken to the Dao shall still harbor perversity.

What is meant by the perverse views of all sentient beings? Seeing permanence, bliss, self, and purity within the defiled; seeing impermanence, suffering, impurity, and non-self in the Heavenly Worthy; seeing the lifespans of ordinary beings as long or short; seeing neither existence nor non-existence as the abode of the Primordial Yang’s palace; believing in the Eightfold Holy Dao as having existence or annihilation—such views are called perverse.

Good sons and good daughters, if they hear this Mahāyāna scripture and cultivate the holy Dao, they shall sever all such perversity. What is meant by all perversity? If one copies, recites, expounds it to others, and thoroughly understands its meaning, one shall attain uprightness, free from perverse views.

Good sons, those who cultivate this supreme *Primordial Yang* scripture, knowing its subtlety, shall from immeasurable kalpas past have cultivated it with sincere devotion, aspiring morning and night, and shall enter the supreme, correct, and true Dao.

Furthermore, good sons, those who understand the profound and esoteric meaning of this supreme *Primordial Yang* scripture and expound it to others, awakening sentient beings, shall enable all to know the Dao, eradicate the mind that slanders the Dharma, and exhaust all heinous transgressions—thereafter attaining the fruit of the supreme, correct, and true Dao. This is called the profound and secret meaning.

Furthermore, good sons, what is meant by the profound meaning? Though knowing that sentient beings truly have no self, they shall not lose the fruition of karma in the future. Though knowing that the six senses perish here, the karma of good and evil shall never perish. Though there are karmic roots, there is no doer. Though there are wondrous realms, there is no one who departs. Though there are attachments and fetters, there is no one bound.

Though there is the defilement of kalpas, it shall never perish—this is called the profound and secret meaning of the noble and exalted virtue of *Primordial Yang*.

At that time, the *Primordial Yang* Perfected One respectfully addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: "As for the meaning of 'hearing what is not heard' just mentioned, this cannot be so. Why? If the Dao exists, it must exist definitively; if it does not exist, it must definitively not exist. The non-existent cannot give rise to the existent, nor can the existent be extinguished into the non-existent. As I have heard, what is heard is heard, and what is not heard is not heard—how then can one speak of 'hearing what is not heard'? If the Heavenly Worthy cannot be heard, this is not hearing; if one has already heard, then it is no longer hearing. Why? Because one has already heard the Dao. How then can one speak of 'hearing what has not been heard' or 'seeing what has not been seen'? It is like one who departs: upon arriving, they do not depart, and in departing, they do not arrive. It is also like being born: once born, one is no longer born. It is also like hearing: once heard, one no longer hears. If the Heavenly Worthy does not hear what is heard, then all sentient beings who have not yet awakened the mind of the Dao should possess it, those who have not attained liberation through *shijie* should attain it, and those who have not seen the *Dharma-nature* should see it. Why then do you say that though the Perfected One possesses the *Dharma-nature*, they have not yet attained clarity? If the Heavenly Worthy is not heard, from whom did the Perfected One of the past awaken and receive hearing? If you say they received hearing, why does the Perfected One now say before the Heavenly Worthy that they have not heard? If they have not heard, how has the Perfected One received the title of *Primordial Yang*? If this is so, would all sentient beings who do not hear the scriptures also receive the title of *Primordial Yang*? If the Perfected One, without hearing such scriptures, can see the supreme Dao, would all sentient beings who do not hear these scriptures also see the supreme, correct, and true Dao?"

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "Form may be visible or invisible; sound is likewise—sometimes audible, sometimes inaudible. This great transformation is neither form nor sound—how then can one speak of seeing or hearing it?"

Thereupon, the *Primordial Yang* Perfected One suddenly awakened in astonishment, saying: "What has perished in the past cannot be heard; what has not yet arrived in the future also cannot be heard. At the moment of listening, it is not called hearing; once heard, the sound perishes and can no longer be heard. It is neither past, future, nor present. If it is not of the three times, it cannot be spoken of; if it cannot be spoken of, it cannot be heard. How then can one say that the Perfected One, cultivating this wondrous *Primordial Yang* scripture, hears what is not heard?"

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy rejoiced and praised the *Primordial Yang* Perfected One and the great assembly, saying: "Excellent! Excellent! You now deeply comprehend the wondrous principle and thoroughly penetrate the subtle and mysterious. All dharmas are like illusions, like transformations, like wind, like lightning, like bubbles, like foam, like the plantain tree—empty and without substance, neither life nor self, devoid of true form."

In that moment, a great radiance suddenly illuminated the entire realm, neither blue nor yellow, neither white nor black. When the great assembly encountered this light, their bodies and minds were filled with bliss, as if they had newly attained the fruit of the Dao.

Then the *Primordial Yang* Perfected One addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: "From whence does this radiance arise?" The Heavenly Worthy remained silent and did not answer. The *Primordial Yang* Perfected One, trembling with awe, hesitated in unease, prostrated himself, and gazed upon the divine countenance, daring to inquire of the Heavenly Worthy: "By what cause and condition does this radiance illuminate the great assembly?" The Heavenly Worthy remained silent and did not answer.

At that time, the innumerable multitude of floating immortals in the void said to one another: "To whom does this radiance belong?" The Heavenly Worthy again remained silent. The *Minglü* Immortal and the assembly of *Dharani* masters again addressed the Heavenly Worthy: "By what cause and condition does this brilliant light pervade the void without obstruction?" Thus, the great assembly questioned one another, yet none could comprehend.

Then the *Primordial Yang* Perfected One, with utmost sincerity and reverence, pressed his head to the ground, weeping and entreating with a trembling voice, humbling his heart and lowering his intent, gazing upon the Heavenly Worthy’s countenance and beseeching instruction to awaken future generations.

Thereupon, the Heavenly Worthy smiled and addressed the *Primordial Yang* Perfected One, saying: "This radiance is called *wisdom*; wisdom is the true Dao. The Dharma of the true Dao does not arise from causes and conditions—how then can there be a question? By what cause and condition does this radiance arise? This radiance is called the wondrous Dharma of *Primordial Yang*; the wondrous Dharma of *Primordial Yang* is the true Dao. The Dharma of the true Dao does not arise from causes and conditions—why then do you, Immortal, question the cause and condition of this radiance? This radiance is the *primordial wisdom*; primordial wisdom is the Dharma of the true Dao. It does not arise from causes and conditions—why then do you, Daoist, question its cause and condition? This radiance is called *great compassion*; great compassion is the true Dao of *Primordial Yang*. The Dharma of the true Dao of *Primordial Yang* does not arise from causes and conditions—why then do you, Immortal, question its arising from causes and conditions? This radiance is the contemplation of the true and the mindfulness of the Dao; the contemplation of the true and the mindfulness of the Dao is the Dharma of the true Dao. It does not arise from causes and conditions—why then do you, Immortal, question its cause and condition? This radiance is the method by which all cultivators of the Dao swallow essence, imbibe qi, exhale and inhale, and practice ingestion—this is called the true Dao. The Dharma of the true Dao does not arise from causes and conditions—why then do you, Immortal, question its cause and condition? This radiance is the supreme lamp of the *Primordial Yang* Dharma."

The Heavenly Worthy said: "Perfected One, do not enter the coarse and defiled meaning of the dharmas. Now, in this eastern *Ganges* world called the *Immovable Realm*, the land is vast and level, without deserts or sands. The earth is adorned with the seven treasures, without ditches or pits. The trees are lush with flowers and fruits, ever-abundant. If sentient beings inhale their fragrance, their bodies and minds become pure, awakening to the *Great Vehicle*, like immortals attaining the fruit of the Dao."

There is also a great river whose waters are fragrant and sweet, possessing the eight flavors in full. If sentient beings bathe therein, they all become pure and clearly awaken to the Dao. The river abounds with manifold flowers and manifold fragrances; all sentient beings who inhale their scent attain clarity, awakening to the Dao with ease.

Moreover, there are countless tigers, wolves, lions, and all manner of fierce birds and beasts, yet when their gazes meet, they regard one another as tenderly as infants. In that world, no sentient being commits transgressions or betrayals, nor do they slander the Dao and Dharma or incur sins of evil and rebellion. The land is harmonious, free from pestilence, afflictions, greed, desire, jealousy, or envy. There is no sun or moon, no day or night, no seasons—it is as the era of *Dragon Han*. The people of that land are wise and upright, without arrogance or pride. All sentient beings awaken to the Dao, possessing great merit and virtue. Their minds all revere the true Dharma, cultivating the Great Vehicle, delighting in the Great Vehicle, contemplating the Great Vehicle, cherishing the Great Vehicle. Through the perfection of their practices, they attain the *Great Total Retention*, their hearts ever compassionate toward all sentient beings.

There is also the *Perfected One of Penetrating Understanding*, *Radiant Wondrous Sound*, deeply versed in the true teaching of *Primordial Yang*, the *Tamer and Teacher of Gods and Humans*. Wherever he goes, he proclaims the Dharma, and all sentient beings hear it without fail. For the assembly of the ten directions’ supreme and true great sages, he expounds such Great Vehicle sutras.

Good sons and their retinues, if they cultivate the *Wondrous Sutra of Primordial Yang of the Great Vehicle*, even what they have never heard before, they will come to hear the supreme essential Dao.

Twenty *Ganges*-sands of lands to the west lies a world called the *Great Hall Realm*, filled with mountains, hills, ridges, sands, and thorns, covering all. The people there constantly suffer hunger and thirst, enduring hardship in all four seasons, never knowing joy or peace. Through their ignorance, they fail to revere and seek the true Dao, clinging instead to unwholesome conditions. Within these unwholesome conditions, they practice perverse teachings, disbelieving in the true Dao. Their lifespans are short, and they constantly engage in deceit, governed by the king’s law. Though the king rules the land, he is never satisfied with what others possess, giving rise to greed and avarice. He raises armies to invade, causing many to die unjustly. As the king perpetuates such unwholesome acts, the gods and deities are displeased, sending down disasters of drought. The five grains fail to ripen, the people starve, and disease spreads. The land knows no peace.

The *Perfected One of Penetrating Understanding*, *Radiant Wondrous Sound*, the *Tamer and Teacher of Gods and Humans*, moved by compassion for sentient beings, traverses the worlds. In that land, he manifests a fragrant forest of the seven treasures, adorned with manifold splendor, manifold divine transformations, and manifold marvels. Together with the *Great Total Retention* sages and the *Peerless Immortals*, he expounds the *Wondrous Sutra of Primordial Yang of the Supreme Grade*, awakening sentient beings and enabling them to comprehend wisdom, so they may take refuge in the supreme, true, and perfect Dao.

Upon hearing this sutra, the people of that land are each astonished and doubtful, sighing in wonder: "By what cause and condition have we suddenly heard the subtle and wondrous scripture of a sage? From whence has it come? Now we rejoice, having encountered the true Dao."

Then the *Perfected One of Penetrating Understanding*, *Radiant Wondrous Sound*, together with seventy-four hundred *Perfected Immortals* of his retinue, bearing banners and canopies, flowers and incense, manifold music, and manifold adornments—all the implements of offering—arrived amidst the jeweled trees of the *Kan* grove in the *Land of Ultimate Bliss*. With the offerings they bore, they made offerings to the *Primordial Heavenly Worthy*, prostrating in reverence, circumambulating three times to the left. Having completed their homage, they withdrew to one side.

The Heavenly Worthy asked the *Perfected One of Penetrating Understanding*, *Radiant Wondrous Sound*, and all the good sons: "Have you come, or have you not come?"

The *Perfected One Radiant Wondrous Sound* addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: "To come is not to come; not to come is also not to come. As I observe this principle, there is truly no coming at all."

The Heavenly Worthy said: "If all conditioned things are eternal, there is also no coming; if they are impermanent, there is also no coming. If one perceives the nature of sentient beings as real, then there is coming and not coming. But I do not see the fixed nature of sentient beings—how then can one speak of coming or not coming? Those who are arrogant perceive going and coming; those without arrogance perceive no going or coming. Those who grasp at actions perceive going and coming; those who do not grasp perceive no going or coming. If one sees the *Perfected One* as the ultimately supreme Dao, then there is going and coming; if one does not see the *Perfected One* as the ultimately supreme Dao, then there is no going or coming. Those who do not hear the nature of the Dao perceive going and coming; those who hear the nature of the Dao perceive no going or coming. If one sees the doubtful and inferior immortals, then there is going and coming; if one does not see the doubtful and inferior immortals, then there is no going or coming. If one sees the *Perfected One* as impermanent, blissful, self, and pure, then there is going and coming; if one sees the *Perfected One* as eternal, blissful, self, and pure, then there is no going or coming."

The Heavenly Worthy said: "Let us set this matter aside for now. If you have questions, I shall grant you leave to ask. May you receive my compassion and permission."

The Heavenly Worthy said: "Good son, ask as you will. Now is the proper time. I shall explain each point in order, resolving all your doubts one by one. Why is this so? The Dharma is difficult to perceive. Through a thousand kalpas of causes and conditions, one may encounter the sacred texts of the *Three Clarities* and the *Seven Divisions*—how rare is such a sight! You should diligently apply yourselves and listen with single-minded attention."

Then the *Perfected One of Penetrating Understanding*, *Radiant Wondrous Sound*, the *Perfected One of Primordial Yang*, and the others, having received permission and been admonished, addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: "How is it that the *Perfected One* is able to cultivate the *Supreme Grade of Primordial Yang* and hear what they have never heard before?"

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "Excellent, excellent! Good son, you now uphold the *Wondrous Sutra of Primordial Yang* and have also encountered me, who can expound it well. You have doubts—yet I am the *Great Physician King*, and I shall dissect and resolve your deep uncertainties. You have not yet fully understood the nature of the Dao, but I possess the lamp of the Dharma that can illuminate it for you."

"Now you wish to cross the great river of afflictions—I can be your boat and oars for you. Regard me as your father and mother, and I shall regard you with the heart of a loving parent. Your mind now clings to the treasure of the true Dharma. Listen carefully, listen carefully, and reflect well upon it. I shall unfold it for you step by step, leaving no doubts unresolved.

Perfected Ones, good sons, those who wish to hear the Dharma—now is the very time. If you hear the Dharma, you should cultivate reverence, recite it with utmost sincerity, and honor the true Dharma. In regard to the Dharma, do not seek its faults, nor entertain thoughts of greed, anger, or ignorance. Do not observe the Dharma-teacher and indulge in wicked conduct. Having heard the sutra, do not become arrogant or dismissive. Do not pursue fame, reputation, or material gain. Instead, regard it as the nectar-medicine of the Dharma for liberating the world. Do not give rise to aversion or attachment, nor harbor doubts.

After hearing the Dharma, first liberate yourself, then liberate others. First awaken yourself, then awaken others. First bring peace to yourself, then bring peace to others. Within the Dharma of the Dao, you should cultivate the thought of its constancy. Within the cycle of birth and death, you should cultivate the thought of its great suffering. Within the Dharma of the Dao, you should cultivate the thought of eternal bliss, true self, and purity. Strive for the Great Vehicle; do not cling to narrow views. In regard to all dharmas, you should abide in non-abiding and not fixate on the characteristics of any dharma. In all dharmas, do not give rise to thoughts of greed; instead, constantly cultivate the thought of knowing and perceiving the Dharma.

Good sons, you must diligently recite and study such scriptures, for then you will forever emerge from the苦海 of birth and death and ascend to the shore of compassion and goodness. You should follow these teachings and not give rise to doubts."

Then *Radiant Wondrous Sound*, the *Perfected One of Penetrating Understanding*, bowed his head and respectfully asked the *Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning*: "Regarding conditioned dharmas—if there is birth, is it permanent or impermanent? If birth is permanent, then conditioned dharmas would have no arising. If birth is impermanent, then conditioned dharmas would be permanent.

Heavenly Worthy, if birth arises from itself, then birth has no inherent nature. If it can give rise to others, then by what cause and condition does it not give rise to the unconditioned? Heavenly Worthy, if birth exists before it arises, then why is it called 'birth' now? If birth does not exist before it arises, then why not say that emptiness is birth?"

Thereupon, the Heavenly Worthy addressed the great assembly: "Excellent, excellent! Good son, you have profoundly penetrated the characteristics of dharmas and fully understood the source of the Dao. The unborn cannot be spoken of as birth, nor can birth be spoken of as birth, nor can the unborn be spoken of as unborn. Why is this? Because it is attained through cultivating the Dao.

Why can birth not be spoken of? Because birth does not exist. Why can the unborn not be spoken of? Because there is attainment. Why is there cause? Because there are causes and conditions. It can also be said that the ten causes and conditions serve as the cause of birth. For this reason, it can also be spoken of.

Good son, do not now enter the profound samādhi of emptiness. Why? Because the assembly is dull-witted. Good son, in conditioned dharmas, birth is also permanent, for abiding is impermanent; birth is also impermanent, for abiding is permanent. Because birth arises from birth, abiding is also impermanent. Because what originally did not exist now perishes, it is also impermanent.

Good son, by nature, all that arises is permanent, but because it perishes moment by moment, it cannot be called permanent. The true and correct Dao can extinguish it, hence it is called impermanent. Good son, in conditioned dharmas, before they arise, the nature of birth already exists, so birth can give rise to birth. In unconditioned dharmas, the nature of birth does not originally exist, so birth cannot give rise to birth.

It is like fire, which has an inherent nature and ignites when conditions meet. The eye has the nature to see, and through form, it becomes clear—thus it sees all sentient beings. Birth is also like this: because it has a nature, when conditions of karmic resonance meet, and parents unite, then birth occurs."

At that time, *Radiant Wondrous Sound*, the *Perfected One of Penetrating Understanding*, *Primordial Yang Perfected One*, and the assembly of seventy-four million, having heard this sutra, were filled with joy. With reverence and devotion, they bowed their heads, held jade tablets, and respectfully asked the *Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning*: "Now that we have received your teachings and your clear exposition, the secret treasury of Primordial Yang has been revealed to us. We have heard what we had never heard before, and this assembly of seventy-four million has deeply understood the non-arising of all dharmas.

Heavenly Worthy, we have now resolved all our doubts. Among this assembly, there is a Perfected One named *True Radiant Light* who wishes to ask further questions. We humbly request your permission."

Thereupon, the Heavenly Worthy addressed *True Radiant Light*: "Good son, ask whatever you wish, and I shall explain and resolve it for you."

Then *True Radiant Light* and his retinue rose from their seats, adjusted their robes, knelt down, bowed their heads, and addressed the Heavenly Worthy: "What karmic deeds must the sentient beings of this world cultivate to be born in the *Immovable World*? How do the Perfected Ones of that land attain wisdom, become the most honored among humans, possess great virtue, perfect all practices, and swiftly comprehend upon hearing?"

Thereupon, the Heavenly Worthy spoke these verses:

All sentient beings
Contain the nature of the supreme Dao.
If they receive the wondrous sutra,
They will ascend to eternal bliss and purity.

Give generously and liberate beings,
Rescue the poor and the sick.
Cut off the mind of doubt,
And harmonize the mirror of consciousness.

Contemplate the *Sutra of Primordial Yang*,
Chant it day and night.
With ease, ascend the Nine Heavens,
And freely enter the Eightfold Right Path.

Good spirits will protect you,
Heavenly Perfected Ones will shine upon you.
Having escaped the Three Calamities,
You will also transcend the Nine Adversities.

Copy and uphold it,
And diligently practice.
Have compassion for good men and women,
Enabling them to fulfill their lifespans,
And through cyclic existence, become lofty Perfected Ones,
Meeting with sages through karmic conditions.

Today, attain the understanding of suffering and emptiness,
And forever cease all striving."

After the Heavenly Worthy spoke these verses, all in the assembly awakened fully, with no more doubts.

At that time, Perfected One Zhen Dingguang of Primordial Yang addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: "Now I have understood the karmic causes of my actions and have attained rebirth in that realm, the noble and exalted rank of Primordial Yang. I pity all sentient beings. As for the questions I have previously asked, the Heavenly Worthy has expounded this wondrous Dharma, which can bring benefit and peace to humans and gods."

Then the Heavenly Worthy addressed Perfected One Primordial Yang, saying: "Excellent, excellent! Good man, you should now listen with utmost sincerity as I distinguish and explain each point in detail. There are causes and conditions for what has not yet come to be and does not come to be; there are causes and conditions for what does not come to be yet comes to be; and there are causes and conditions for what comes to be.

Good man, that which does not come to be yet comes to be is the noble and exalted rank of Primordial Yang. Ordinary beings do not attain it because they possess greed, hatred, and delusion; because their bodily, verbal, and mental actions are impure; because they accept all impure things; and because they commit the five grave offenses and slander the true and good Dharma. For these reasons, it is called what has not yet come to be and does not come to be.

Good man, that which does not come to be yet comes to be is free from greed, hatred, and delusion; free from evil in body, speech, and mind; does not accept all impure things; does not commit the four grave offenses; does not slander the supreme Dao; does not harbor perverse doubts; and does not commit the five grave offenses. For these causes and conditions, it is called what comes to be yet does not come to be.

Good man, for what causes and conditions is it called what comes to be yet does not come to be? That which comes to be is called the twenty-five states of existence. All sentient beings are constantly obscured by countless afflictions and fetters, ceaselessly transmigrating like a turning wheel—this is called coming to be. To save and deliver all sentient beings, one manifests in the present—this is also called coming to be.

Good man, for what causes and conditions is it called what comes to be and comes to be? That which comes to be is the twenty-five states of existence. Because of the causes and conditions of afflictions in all ordinary beings, it is called what comes to be and comes to be.

Good man, it is the same with what has not been heard. There is what has not been heard yet is heard; there is what has not been heard; and there is what has been heard and is heard. What is what has not been heard yet is heard? Good man, what has not been heard is the rank of Primordial Yang. Why has it not been heard? Because it is not conditioned, not of sound, and inexpressible. How then is it also heard? Because it is named as such—what is called *constant bliss, true self, and purity*. For this reason, it is called what has not been heard yet is heard."

At that time, Perfected One Primordial Yang and all in the assembly bowed their heads, knelt, and addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: "As the Heavenly Worthy has said, the noble and secret meaning of Primordial Yang cannot be heard. How then can it be said that *constant bliss, true self, and purity* can be heard? Why is this?"

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "One who severs afflictions is called the noble rank of Primordial Yang. One who has not severed them is called one who does not attain it. For this reason, the noble rank of Primordial Yang is originally non-existent yet now exists. If worldly dharmas are originally non-existent yet now exist, they are called impermanent. For example, you all were originally non-existent, now exist, and will again become non-existent—thus they are called impermanent. If the noble rank of Primordial Yang is like this, how can it be said to be *constant bliss, true self, and purity*?

Furthermore, Heavenly Worthy, all that is accomplished through adornment is called impermanent. If the noble rank of Primordial Yang is like this, it should also be impermanent. What are the causes and conditions? The thirty-six revered scriptures, the Three Pure Ones’ secret treasury, the seven books of true teachings—all such Dharmas are the causes and conditions for accomplishing everything, and thus are called impermanent.

Furthermore, Heavenly Worthy, that which is named is impermanent. If the noble rank of Primordial Yang exists, it should also be impermanent. As the Heavenly Worthy once said before the Primordial Beginning, all wondrous scriptures undergo transformation. For this reason, they are called impermanent.

Furthermore, Heavenly Worthy, what is visible is called impermanent. As previously stated, the noble rank of Primordial Yang severs all afflictions.

Furthermore, Heavenly Worthy, for example, space is unhindered for all sentient beings and is thus called constant. If the noble rank of Primordial Yang is constant, why do some sentient beings attain it and others not? If the noble rank of Primordial Yang is unequal among sentient beings, it cannot be called constant.

Heavenly Worthy, for example, if a hundred people share a common enemy and that enemy is harmed, many will receive joy. If the noble rank of Primordial Yang is an equal Dharma, when one attains it, many should attain it; when one severs fetters, many should also sever them. If it is not like this, how can it be called constant?

For example, if someone reveres the Three Treasures, makes offerings to scriptures, respects and praises them, and does so diligently day and night, kings, princes, parents, and teachers will receive benefit and nourishment—this is not called constant. The noble rank of Primordial Yang is also like this and is not called constant. Why? As the Heavenly Worthy once said during the Primordial Beginning’s dispensation, expounding this scripture to Perfected One Primordial Yang: 'If someone can reverently recite this scripture, they will sever fetters and receive boundless joy.' For this reason, it is not called constant.

Heavenly Worthy, if within Primordial Yang there is what is called *constant bliss, true self, and purity*, it is not called constant. If it does not exist, how can it be spoken of?"

Then the Heavenly Worthy addressed Perfected One Da Jie, saying: "The essence of Primordial Yang is not originally non-existent yet now exists. If the essence of Primordial Yang were originally non-existent yet now exists, it would not be the unconditioned, eternally abiding Dharma. Whether there is the Dao or not, its nature and characteristics are eternally abiding. Because sentient beings are obscured by afflictions and do not study the true Dao, they mistakenly believe Primordial Yang does not exist. When a perfected one diligently cultivates the mind with precepts, concentration, and wisdom, and severs afflictions, they then perceive it. You should know that the true Dao is the eternally abiding Dharma, not originally non-existent yet now exists—thus it is constant.

Good man, for example, in a dark room filled with various treasures, people know they exist but cannot see them because of the darkness."

Those of wisdom, knowing skillful means, kindle the great bright lamp and carry it to illuminate all, thereby perceiving the treasures—yet never do they conceive the thought that these treasures were originally non-existent and now exist. The true Dao is likewise: it has always existed, not beginning only now. Because of the darkness of afflictions, sentient beings do not see it. The greatly wise true person, employing skillful means, kindles the lamp of wisdom, enabling all to perceive the true Dao—constant, blissful, self, and pure. Therefore, the wise should not declare of this true Dao that it was originally non-existent and now exists.

Thus, great assembly, your claim that the true Dao becomes impermanent due to adornment is also incorrect. Why? Great assembly, the essence of the true Dao is neither born nor produced, neither substantial nor empty, neither generated by karmic action nor a conditioned, defiled dharma. It is neither heard nor seen, neither subject to birth-and-death nor possessing distinct or identical characteristics. It neither goes nor returns, neither cause nor effect. For these reasons, the true Dao is constant, eternally unchanging. Therefore, through cultivating wholesome dharmas over countless kalpas to adorn oneself, one comes to perceive it clearly.

Great assembly, for example, the earth contains waters of eight flavors, yet all sentient beings cannot obtain them. Those of wisdom apply effort to dig and drill, and thus obtain the water. The true Dao is likewise. Just as a blind person does not behold the sun and moon, yet a skilled physician restores their sight so they may see—so too the sun and moon are not newly existent. The true Dao is likewise: it has existed from of old, not only now.

Good man, it is like a person imprisoned for crimes, who after long confinement is released and returns home to see their six relations. The true Dao is likewise.

Thus, great assembly, your claim that the dharma of the true Dao is impermanent due to causes and conditions is also incorrect. Why? Good man, there are five kinds of causes. What are the five? First, the cause of arising; second, the cause of harmony; third, the cause of abiding; fourth, the cause of growth; and fifth, the distant cause.

What is the cause of arising? The cause of arising consists of various afflictions, various doubts, and the seeds of grasses and trees—this is called the cause of arising.

What is the cause of harmony? When wholesome minds harmonize with wholesomeness, unwholesome minds with unwholesomeness, and indeterminate minds with indeterminacy—this is called the cause of harmony.

What is the cause of abiding? Just as a house does not collapse when its foundation abides below, and mountains, rivers, and trees stand firm due to the great earth—so too the four great elements and boundless afflictions enable sentient beings to abide. This is called the cause of abiding.

What is the cause of growth? Through conditions such as clothing, ornaments, food, and other necessities, sentient beings grow. Just as seeds unburned by fire and uneaten by birds grow; as male and female disciples of the four assemblies, relying on true persons and those who nurture their abilities, grow; as children grow through their parents—this is called the cause of growth.

What is the distant cause? For example, when the Heavenly Venerable expounded this sutra in past kalpas, it became a great causal condition for future beings, washing away all doubts and obstructions—this is called the distant cause. Or, as the blood and qi of parents are a distant cause for sentient beings; or as seasons and the like are called distant causes.

Good man, the essence of the true Dao is not constituted by these five causes. How then can one claim it is an impermanent cause?

Furthermore, good man, there are two other causes: the cause of production and the cause of realization.

What is the cause of production? As the potter’s wheel and cord are the cause of production. What is the cause of realization? As a lamp illuminating objects in the dark is called the cause of realization.

Good man, the *Sublime Primordial Yang Scripture* does not arise from the cause of production but only from the cause of realization. The cause of realization is the clarification of the profound and subtle meanings of the supreme Primordial Yang, serving as a great vessel, a great bridge, a great causal condition, and a great field of merit for future beings, enabling all in this age to attain the fruit of the supreme, correct, and true Dao.

Then, the Radiant Voice of Primordial Yang, Perfected One of Penetrating Understanding, bowed his luminous head and respectfully addressed the Primordial Heavenly Venerable: "Having received your instruction, you have guided sentient beings with various skillful means, expounded in manifold ways, taught with meticulous care, and praised in exhaustive detail—my joy surpasses all measure. Yet, due to long-standing obstructions, doubts remain. Disdaining not my lowliness, I venture to touch your sacred countenance. Bowing my head, I humbly inquire further:

Heavenly Venerable, may I ask: what meritorious deeds must all sentient beings cultivate to escape sorrow and grief? What almsgiving brings wealth and abundance? What field of merit yields plenitude?"

What vows must one make to attain the true Dao?"

The Heavenly Venerable replied: "It is like a man planting a tree to gain shade, flowers, fruit, or timber. If one cultivates the Way with single-minded devotion, silently contemplating and profoundly reflecting, one naturally accumulates vast merit. By bestowing alms upon the destitute and impoverished, cherishing all beings with compassion, and loving all things without begrudging treasures, one’s endeavors align with the Dharma. Practicing thus, one deeply comprehends the wondrous Dharma, fulfills the true Dao, and severs the karmic obstructions of all beings.

Good man, it is like one who falls into the great ocean and clings to a corpse to cross to the other shore. When a perfected one cultivates the supreme Dao and practices almsgiving, it is likewise as that corpse.

Good man, it is like one imprisoned in a deep dungeon with doors and gates firmly secured, where only the privy hole offers passage to an unobstructed place. When a perfected one cultivates the supreme Dao and practices almsgiving, it is likewise so.

Good man, it is like a noble in dire peril, with no refuge, who vows to recite the *Primordial Yang Sutra* and thereby attains peace and safety. When a perfected one cultivates the supreme Dao and practices almsgiving, it is likewise so.

Good man and all present assemblies, you should know that the secret treasury of Primordial Yang is none other than the supreme, correct, and true Dao. If one follows the sutra in cultivation, vowing and contemplating morning and evening, setting aside a pure chamber of one *zhang* square within the household to burn incense and make offerings, persisting year after year without retreat—through such sincerity, all shall naturally attain its fruit, and in this life be freed from sorrow, peril, and the afflictions of vexation."

Then, the Radiant Voice of Primordial Yang, Perfected One of Penetrating Understanding, along with the great assembly of divine immortals and their retinues—seventy-four million in all—simultaneously exclaimed in praise and recited these verses:

The true Dao’s essence is numinous and wondrous,
The supreme Dharma most profound and mysterious.
Its secret traces lie in the Purple Tenuity Palace,
Its radiant light illumines the Great Luo Heaven.
Scholars of the Dark Capital’s highest learning,
Ever pure and naturally so,
Guide the crane to roam the azure vastness,
Urge the phoenix to soar through blue mist.
At the Golden Portals, they worship the Great Sage,
At the Jade Gates, they gather the lofty and wise.
The four assemblies of Primordial Yang’s time
Encounter this great karmic condition.
The Three Clarities have unveiled their mysteries,
The Seven Divisions have been transmitted in turn.
Obstructions of doubt are dispelled and explored,
Past sorrows and vexations now understood.
All good men
Attain the field of pure body,
Roam the Four Correct Ways,
Wander freely atop the Nine Floral Peaks.
Flute notes rise beyond the clouds,
Brahma’s voice traverses the wind’s forefront.
By chance, they meet the era of the Primordial Beginning,
Unfading as the age of the Supreme Sovereign.
The Tamer, Teacher of Heaven and Humankind,
Severs the bonds of love and attachment,
Diminishes and cuts away the nets of doubt,
Anger and delusion are thus cast aside.
The four assemblies bow their heads in joy,
Taking leave of the great divine immortals.
Today, we receive your guidance and deliverance,
And pray you bestow your great compassion to the end.

Then, the Radiant Voice of Primordial Yang, Perfected One, and all present assemblies concluded their hymns of praise, bowed in reverence, and departed.

Here ends Scroll Nine of the *Supreme Pervasive Treasure Primordial Yang Wondrous Sutra*.
Scroll Ten of the *Supreme Pervasive Treasure Primordial Yang Wondrous Sutra* begins.

**The Ascent to Great Luo Chapter**

Thus have I heard. At one time, the Heavenly Worthy was in the land of Pulín, beneath the Fan Hua Tree, within the Palace of Primordial Yang, surrounded by a multitude of a million—great sagely perfected ones, great immortal Daoists, and male and female officials—all encircling him before and behind.

At that time, on the seventh day of the seventh month, the Heavenly Worthy ascended to the Upper Palace of Great Luo. Entering samādhi, he beheld his majestic divine power, emitting a great radiance of variegated hues—azure, yellow, red, and white—pervading the three thousand great thousand worlds and extending to the very edges of the ten directions’ empty space, all likewise illuminated. Of the six destinies’ sentient beings within, those who encountered this light found all the defilements of the four afflictions utterly dissolved.

Upon seeing and hearing this, those multitudes were overcome with great sorrow. With one voice, they raised their lamentations, saying to one another: *"Let each of us restrain ourselves; let us not be overwhelmed with grief. Rather, let us swiftly go together to the Palace of Primordial Yang."* Arriving before the Heavenly Worthy, they prostrated, their heads touching the ground, and entreated him, bowing and beseeching: *"May the Heavenly Worthy not ascend to Great Luo. Abide here in Primordial Yang for a hundred years, or a thousand ages!"* Clasping one another’s hands, they spoke again: *"The world is hollow and empty; the good fortune of beings is exhausted. Unwholesome karmic deeds increase. We must hasten now, for the Heavenly Worthy will soon depart."* And again they said: *"The world is but empty space. From this day forth, we shall have no refuge, no object of reverence—poor, orphaned, and exposed. Once the Supreme Heavenly Worthy departs, if doubts arise, to whom shall we turn?"*

Then, there were immeasurable great sages, hosts of perfected ones, great immortal Daoists, male and female officials, and all the pure-minded laymen and laywomen who had encountered the Heavenly Worthy’s light. Their bodies trembled violently, unable to contain themselves. Their minds grew dim and confused, disoriented and restless.

At that time, there were also the Perfected Ones Song Ling, Guang Miao, and Yu Luo, along with hundreds of thousands of others whose minds had attained mastery, whose tasks were accomplished, who had left behind all afflictions and subdued their faculties. Like great dragon kings of immense virtue, they had realized the wisdom of emptiness, attained their own benefit, and were surrounded by sandalwood as a sandalwood grove, or as a lion king encircled by lions. They had accomplished such boundless merits, all through the Heavenly Worthy.

Each disciple, at the first light of dawn, left their usual abode, holding incense burners. When they encountered the Heavenly Worthy’s radiance, they said to one another: *"We should swiftly purify ourselves."* Having spoken thus, their entire bodies bristled with hair, unable to contain themselves. Tears filled their eyes, and they were overcome with great sorrow. For the sake of benefiting and bringing peace to beings, accomplishing the foremost emptiness-practice of the Great Vehicle, manifesting the great Dao, and expounding the esoteric teachings through skillful means—to ensure the uninterrupted proclamation of the Dharma in all its forms, and to subdue the causes and conditions of beings—they swiftly came before the Heavenly Worthy. Bowing at his feet, they circumambulated him a hundred times, prostrated in reverence, and withdrew to sit to one side.

At that time, there were also Daoists, male and female officials, male and female functionaries of the twenty-four offices, leading their retinues of hundreds of thousands. Their outflows exhausted, their minds attained mastery, their tasks accomplished, they had left behind all afflictions and subdued their faculties. Like great dragon kings of immense virtue, they had realized the wisdom of emptiness. At the first light of dawn, their entire bodies bristled with hair, tears filled their eyes, and they were overcome with great sorrow. Likewise, for the sake of benefiting and bringing peace to beings, accomplishing the foremost emptiness-practice of the Great Vehicle, manifesting the great Dao, and expounding the esoteric teachings through skillful means—to ensure the uninterrupted proclamation of the Dharma in all its forms, and to subdue the causes and conditions of beings—they swiftly came before the Heavenly Worthy. Bowing at his feet, they circumambulated him hundreds of thousands of times, prostrated in reverence, and withdrew to sit to one side.

Among the dragons of humanity, those who had attained the ten stages and abided in immovability, manifesting themselves through skillful means, were named the Perfected Ones Great King, Na Shan, Jue Li, Most Victorious, Wondrous Thought, and Great Wisdom, who served as their leaders. Their minds all revered the Great Vehicle, abided in the Great Vehicle, deeply understood the Great Vehicle, delighted in the Great Vehicle, and guarded the Great Vehicle. They were skillful in accord with all the world. They made this vow: *"Those who have not yet crossed over, we shall cause to cross over."* In countless eons past, they had upheld pure precepts, maintained their practices, and explained what was unexplained. They perpetuated the lineage of the Three Treasures, ensuring its continuity into the future. They would turn the Wheel of the Dharma, adorning themselves with great splendor, accomplishing boundless merits such as these. They regarded all beings as they would an only child. At the first light of dawn, when they encountered the Heavenly Worthy’s radiance, their entire bodies bristled with hair, tears filled their eyes, and they were overcome with great sorrow. Likewise, for the sake of benefiting and bringing peace to beings, accomplishing the foremost emptiness-practice of the Great Vehicle, manifesting the great Dao, and expounding the esoteric teachings through skillful means—to ensure the uninterrupted proclamation of the Dharma in all its forms, and to subdue the causes and conditions of beings—they swiftly came before the Heavenly Worthy. Bowing at his feet, they circumambulated him hundreds of thousands of times, prostrated in reverence, and withdrew to sit to one side.

At that time, there were also immeasurable pure-minded laymen and laywomen who upheld the Five Precepts with perfect decorum. Their leaders were named Wei De, Gan Ji, Yuan You, Dong Shuang Cheng, Xu Fei Qiong, and Wan Ling Hua. They took deep delight in examining the gates of counteractive practices—such as suffering and joy, permanence and impermanence, self and no-self, reality and unreality, refuge and non-refuge, beings and non-beings, eternity and non-eternity, peace and non-peace, action and non-action, severance and non-severance, constancy and inconstancy—and suchlike gates of counteractive practices. They also delighted in hearing the supreme Great Vehicle. Having heard it, they were able to expound it to others. They upheld pure precepts, yearned for the Great Vehicle, and having fulfilled themselves, they also fulfilled others who yearned likewise.

Skilled in gathering the supreme wisdom, they cherished and delighted in the Great Vehicle, guarding and upholding it. They were well able to accord with all in the world, liberating those not yet liberated, enlightening those not yet enlightened, and perpetuating the lineage of the Three Jewels to ensure its continuity in future ages. They would turn the Wheel of the Dao, adorning themselves with great majesty, their minds ever steeped in the savor of pure precept-observance, and thus accomplished all such merits. Toward all beings, they generated a great compassionate heart, equal and undivided, as if regarding an only child.

At the break of dawn, when the first rays of the sun emerged, desiring to adorn the teachings of the Dao, each person gathered ten thousand bundles of fragrant woods—sandalwood, aloeswood, ox-head sandalwood, celestial wood, and the like. Each piece of wood, with its grain and knots, radiated the subtle luminosity of the seven treasures, resembling intricate multicolored paintings. By the power of the Dao, these woods bore wondrous hues of blue, yellow, red, and white, delighting the eyes of all beings. The woods were anointed with various fragrances—turmeric, aloeswood, resin incense—and adorned with jeweled lotus blossoms. From each fragrant wood hung five-colored banners, soft and exquisite, like celestial silks embroidered with brocade and damask. These fragrant woods were loaded onto jeweled chariots, each chariot emanating multicolored light—blue, yellow, red, and white—with shafts and wheels inlaid with the seven treasures. Each chariot was drawn by a team of four horses, swift as the wind, and before each chariot stood fifty-seven jeweled standards, their golden nets of real gold draped overhead. Each chariot bore fifty exquisite jeweled canopies, and atop them rested various flowers—blue lotuses, white lotuses, red lotuses, golden lotuses, and dark-blue lotuses—each blossom with petals of pure gold and a vajra pedestal. Within the hearts of these flowers gathered many black bees, frolicking and rejoicing, emitting wondrous sounds: the truths of impermanence, suffering, emptiness, and no-self. From these sounds arose the path originally trodden by the true ones. There were also various songs, dances, and musical performances—zithers, flutes, harps, pipes, drums, and horns. From the music emerged these words: *"Alas! Alas! The world is but emptiness!"*

Before each chariot, a virtuous man bore a four-jeweled tray laden with various flowers, turmeric and other incenses, and the finest perfumes. Devout men and women, young and old alike, each set their minds to preparing food for the Heavenly Worthy and his disciples, complete in every variety, all cooked with sandalwood, aloeswood, fragrant fuel, and eight-flavored water, sweet and delectable. There were six flavors: bitter, sour, sweet, pungent, salty, and bland. And three virtues: lightness and softness, purity and cleanliness, and accordance with the Dao. Having made such adornments, they arrived at the Palace of Primordial Yang, where the ground was entirely spread with gold, and silken fabrics, jeweled canopies, and coverings were laid upon it. Throughout the palace, for the Heavenly Worthy and his disciples, they arranged seven-jeweled lion thrones, as lofty and vast as Mount Jade Capital. Upon each throne hung jeweled curtains and garlands, with various exquisite banners and canopies suspended, the thrones anointed with fine fragrances and scattered with myriad blossoms.

The devout men and women each thought: *"May all beings receive whatever they need—food, clothing, heads, eyes, limbs, and bodies."* As they made these offerings, they were free from desire, anger, defilement, and poisonous thoughts, harboring no residual wishes for worldly blessings or happiness, but aspiring solely to the supreme, pure precepts of the Dao. These devout men and women, abiding in the path of the true ones, further thought: *"Once the Heavenly Worthy has accepted our offerings, he will ascend to the Great Luo Upper Realm, leaving us behind."* At this thought, their body hairs stood on end, tears filled their eyes, and great sorrow arose within them. Each bore their offerings—fragrant woods, banners, jeweled canopies, and food—loaded onto jeweled chariots, and proceeded to the Heavenly Worthy’s presence. Bowing at his feet, they presented their offerings, circumambulating him a hundred times, raising their voices in lamentation, their sorrow shaking heaven and earth, tears falling like rain. They said to one another: *"Alas, O Benevolent One! The world is but emptiness!"* Then, casting themselves before the Heavenly Worthy, they addressed him: *"We beseech the Heavenly Worthy, with great compassion and great mercy, to accept our offerings, receive our repentance, and eradicate our past transgressions. From beginningless kalpas through hundreds of thousands of eons to this very day, we have passed through countless births and deaths, bound by the fetters of the six desires and the five aggregates, ensnared by greed, stinginess, and attachment, knowing only how to commit sins and unaware of the Great Vehicle. Now, by the power of the Heavenly Worthy’s Great Vehicle and its luminous karma, we each reproach ourselves. We observe our own bodies as if they were four poisonous snakes. This body is constantly devoured by countless worms. This body is foul and filthy, imprisoned by the dungeon of desire. This body is loathsome, like a dead dog. This body is impure, its nine orifices ever flowing. This body is like a city, its walls of skin enclosing blood, flesh, sinews, and bones, its hands and feet like battlements and watchtowers, its eyes like spy-holes, its head like a palace hall, its heart the ruling king within. Such a bodily city is abandoned by all true immortals, yet foolish and deluded beings cling to it, dwelling within it with greed, lust, anger, and ignorance—rakshasas all. It is as unsubstantial as reeds, e lan trees, water bubbles, or plantain trunks. This body is impermanent, ceasing in every instant, like lightning, a mirage, a phantom flame, or painted water that vanishes as soon as it is drawn."*

This body is fragile, like a tree perched on a sheer riverbank. Before long, this body shall become food for foxes, wolves, owls, vultures, crows, and starving dogs. Only the wise may delight in such a body—yet even to speak of it fully would be as futile as trying to hold the ocean in a cow’s hoofprint.

This body is impermanent, impure, and foul; even if the vast earth were reduced to the size of a jujube, then gradually diminished to the size of a *tingli* seed, or even to a speck of dust, its flaws could still not be fully described. This body is rife with afflictions; thus, it should be abandoned like spittle cast aside.

For these reasons, all men and women should constantly cultivate their minds with the Dharma of emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness. They should seek joy in studying and receiving the Mahāyāna sutras, and having heard them, expound them to others. They must uphold their original vows, revile this body, and deeply loathe its impermanence and instability. By constantly cultivating such right contemplation, they will shatter the boundless wheel of birth and death. Thirsting for the Mahāyāna, they will first fulfill themselves and then fulfill others who likewise thirst. They will take profound delight in the Mahāyāna, safeguard the Mahāyāna, and though they appear in this body, they are in truth of the same kind as the true immortals.

They will skillfully follow the ways of the world, liberating those not yet liberated, enlightening those not yet enlightened, and perpetuating the lineage of the Three Jewels to ensure it does not vanish in future ages. They will turn the Wheel of Dharma, adorning themselves with great majesty, steadfastly upholding the precepts, and accomplishing all such merits. Toward all beings, they will generate great compassion, equal and undivided, as if regarding an only child.

They will all make this vow: *"We beseech the Heavenly Worthy to accept our offerings and allow our repentance, to abide long in the lower realms, to liberate beings, to bestow the scriptures of deliverance, to grant the blessings of the Dharma, and not to forsake us for the upper realms. For just as parents, before their children are fully reared, would never suddenly depart—leaving their offspring orphaned, destitute, and bereft of shelter—so too, if the Heavenly Worthy returns to the upper realms and abandons us, it would be the same. We implore the Heavenly Worthy to remain in the world, to perfect all Dharma, and to shelter us."*

With such entreaties, they choked with sobs, overcome by grief. The great assembly wept, tears filling their eyes, unable to restrain themselves. Then the Heavenly Worthy emitted from his face manifold rays of light, which illumined the assembly. Upon witnessing this radiance, they understood its significance and relayed the news to one another: *"The Heavenly Worthy now manifests these auspicious signs; soon he will surely return to the upper realms. All offerings should be presented to the Heavenly Worthy and the great assembly."*

The Pine Spirit Immortal and the assembly, knowing that the Heavenly Worthy’s emission of such light was not without cause, remained silent for a long while. The Heavenly Worthy then addressed the Pine Spirit Immortal: *"The time is now right for you to make offerings to the Heavenly Worthy and the assembly. I am about to return to the upper realms."* A second and third time, he spoke likewise.

Upon hearing these words, the Pine Spirit Immortal and the great assembly raised their voices in wailing, choking with sorrow, and cried: *"Alas! Alas! The world is as empty as the void!"* They addressed the assembly: *"Now, let us all prostrate ourselves together, five limbs to the ground, and with one voice entreat the Heavenly Worthy to remain in the lower realms, to shelter us, and not to abandon us for the upper realms."*

Then the Heavenly Worthy said to the Pine Spirit and the others: *"Do not weep so bitterly and disturb yourselves. Each of you should contemplate this body as being like a plantain tree, a mirage in the heat, a water bubble, an illusion, a *gandharva* city, a fragile vessel, lightning, painted water, a prisoner facing execution, ripe fruit, camel flesh, or a pestle rising and falling in a mortar. Contemplate all conditioned things as akin to food mixed with poison, for the Dharma of conditioned existence is fraught with manifold afflictions."*

Thereupon, the Pine Spirit Immortal again addressed the Heavenly Worthy: *"If you do not remain long in the lower realms, how can we not weep? Alas! Alas! The world is as empty as the void! We only beseech the Heavenly Worthy to take pity on us and all beings, to abide long in the lower realms, and not to return to the upper realms."*

The Heavenly Worthy replied to the Pine Spirit Immortal: *"You should not lament so piteously, urging me to remain long in the lower realms. It is out of pity for you and all beings that I now intend to return to the upper realms. Why? Because such is the nature of all noble Dharma, and so too is it with conditioned existence."* Then the Heavenly Worthy spoke these verses:

*"All conditioned things
are by nature impermanent.
Once arisen, they do not abide;
extinction alone is bliss."*

*"Pine Spirit Immortal, you should now contemplate all conditioned things as ever-new, all dharmas as devoid of self, impermanent and unabiding. This body is rife with boundless afflictions, like a water bubble. Therefore, you should not weep."*

Then the Pine Spirit again addressed the Heavenly Worthy: *"So it is, so it is! Truly, as you teach. Though we know the Heavenly Worthy manifests skillful means in returning to the upper realms and leaving us, we cannot help but feel sorrow. Yet upon reflection, we also rejoice."*

The Heavenly Worthy praised the Pine Spirit: *"Excellent! Excellent! You understand that the Heavenly Worthy’s coming and going, like all dharmas, are but illusory appearances. The Great Sage abides within them, employing skillful means without attachment. Why? Because all teachings are adapted to the needs of beings, aiming to liberate them from the sufferings of birth, old age, sickness, and death, so that all may attain the unshakable fruit of rebirth and constantly enjoy bliss. Why? Because I am the true field of merit for all beings. If you also wish to be a field of merit for all beings, swiftly prepare your offerings and do not delay."*

Then the Pine Spirit, for the sake of liberating all beings, bowed his head, tears streaming, and addressed the Heavenly Worthy: *"Excellent! Excellent! If I am capable of being a field of merit, then I will fully understand whether the Heavenly Worthy truly returns to the upper realms or not."*

Now we and all the perfected ones and immortals are like mosquitoes and gnats—truly unable to fathom whether the Heavenly Worthy returns to the upper realms or not.

Then the Perfected Pine Spirit and his followers, sorrowful and weeping, circled the Heavenly Worthy, burning incense and scattering flowers, serving him with utmost devotion. Soon after, they rose from their seats with the assembly of perfected ones and departed to prepare food offerings.

After the Pine Spirit left, the divine continent of Jambudvīpa, both within and beyond the Three Realms, trembled violently. All beings who saw or heard this knew that the Heavenly Worthy was returning to the upper realms, and thus the earth quaked greatly.

At that time, all beings within and beyond the Three Realms, upon hearing these words, stood with hair on end, weeping in unison as they recited this verse:

We bow to the Master of Discipline,
We now beseech and implore:
Parting from humans and immortals,
We shall forever lack refuge.
If you now return to the upper realms,
We shall sink into the sea of suffering.
Grieving and longing, filled with sorrow,
Like a calf bereft of its mother,
Poor and without salvation.
Like one afflicted by illness,
Without a physician, left to their own devices,
Consuming what they should not.
The afflictions of beings are sicknesses,
Constantly harmed by wrong views,
Far from the King of Dharma Physicians,
They ingest poisonous medicines.
Therefore, Great Sage,
You should not abandon us.
As a land without a ruler
Suffers famine among its people,
So too are we—
Deprived of shelter and the flavor of the Dao.
If you return to the upper realms,
Our minds will be lost in confusion,
Like the great earth trembling,
Disoriented in all directions.
Great Immortal ascending to the upper realm,
How can we not grieve today?
Abandoned by the Heavenly Worthy,
Like spittle cast aside.
For example, when the sun first rises,
Its radiance blazes brightly,
Not only illuminating itself
But also dispelling all darkness.
The Heavenly Worthy’s divine light of spiritual power
Can eradicate our suffering and sorrow.
Abiding among the great assembly,
Like Mount Jade Capital.
The Heavenly Worthy said: It is like a king who raises his children with constant love, teaching them benevolence, righteousness, loyalty, and filial piety, ensuring they fully understand. Only then does he allow them freedom, yet unexpectedly, the children turn to unwholesome ways, and the king abandons them.

The Heavenly Worthy addressed the Pine Spirit: Now, for the sake of the Dao, I have instructed you all, ensuring you possess right view. Do not abandon this path. If you do, you will be like those princes.

Heavenly Worthy, it is like one who has mastered many treatises yet still feels fear toward them.

The Heavenly Worthy is likewise—though he has penetrated all dharmas, he still feels fear toward them. If the Heavenly Worthy were to remain in the world for a long time, expounding the flavor of ambrosia to fulfill all, then beings would no longer fear falling into hell.

Heavenly Worthy, it is like one who, newly employed, is seized by officials and imprisoned. When asked, “What have you endured?” they reply, “I now suffer great sorrow. If I escape, I will find peace.”

The Heavenly Worthy is the same—he has undertaken many ascetic practices for our sake. Yet we have not yet escaped the suffering of birth and death. How then can the Heavenly Worthy enjoy peace?

Heavenly Worthy, it is like a master physician skilled in remedies who secretly teaches his own son but not other external students.

The Heavenly Worthy is the same—he has privately taught the profound and secret treasury only to Laozi, abandoning the rest of us without compassion.

The Heavenly Worthy should not be stingy with the Dao, like that physician who taught only his son and not the other students. That physician’s reluctance to teach stemmed from a mind clinging to superiority and inferiority, hence his secrecy. But the Heavenly Worthy’s mind is free from such distinctions—why then does he not instruct us?

We only wish you would remain long in this world and not ascend to the upper realms.

Heavenly Worthy, it is like the old, the young, and the sick who, forsaking distant and safe paths, traverse perilous roads. The perilous road is fraught with hardships, and they endure countless sufferings. Then a compassionate person takes pity and shows them a smooth, good path.

Heavenly Worthy, we are the same.
The “young” are those whose Dharma-body has not yet grown;
The “old” are those burdened by heavy afflictions;
The “sick” are those not yet freed from birth and death;
The “perilous road” is the twenty-five states of existence.
We beseech the Heavenly Worthy to guide us onto the ambrosial right path, to remain long in this world, and not to depart for the upper realms.

Then the Heavenly Worthy addressed the assembly: You should not, like ordinary beings or the gods, grieve and weep. Instead, strive diligently and focus your minds on right mindfulness.

Upon hearing the Heavenly Worthy’s words, the gods and the great assembly ceased their weeping, like one who, having buried a beloved child, restrains their tears.

Then the Heavenly Worthy spoke this verse to the great assembly:

Open your minds,
Do not grieve so deeply.
The great Dao is always thus—
Therefore, remain silent.
Delight in the practice of non-negligence,
Guard your minds with right mindfulness,
Stay far from unwholesome dharmas,
Console yourselves and rejoice.

Furthermore, if the Pine Spirit and others have any doubts, they should now ask. Whether it concerns emptiness or non-emptiness, permanence or impermanence, suffering or non-suffering, dependence or non-dependence, departure or non-departure, return or non-return, constancy or inconstancy, cessation or non-cessation, beings or non-beings, existence or non-existence, reality or unreality, truth or untruth, extinction or non-extinction, secrecy or non-secrecy, duality or non-duality—if there are any doubts regarding such matters, ask now. I will, in accordance with your needs, resolve them for you. I will first expound the ambrosia of the Dao, and only then will I return to the upper realms.

All you great assemblies, the Heavenly Worthy has appeared in the world, praising the rarity of obtaining a human body. Encountering the Dao and generating faith—this too is rare.

To endure—this too is difficult. To perfect the precepts, fulfill them without flaw, and attain the supreme fruit of the Dao—this too is difficult. It is as rare as seeking gold, jade, or wondrous treasures and flowers. To escape the eight difficulties and obtain a human body is difficult. Having encountered me, you must not let this opportunity pass in vain.

In the past, I underwent countless austerities to attain this supreme expedient means. For your sake, across immeasurable kalpas, I relinquished my body, hands and feet, head and eyes, marrow and brain. Therefore, you must not be negligent.

All you great assemblies, how do you adorn the true Dharma, the treasure city replete with all virtues, the precious gems of precepts, concentration, and wisdom as its walls and moats? Now that you have encountered this treasure city of the Dao, you must not cling to these false and worthless things. It is like a merchant who, upon finding a true treasure city, gathers mere shards and tiles before returning home—just so have you, having encountered the treasure city, taken up worthless things.

All you great assemblies, do not let a lowly mind breed contentment. Though you have now left the household life, you do not yet yearn for this Great Vehicle. Though your bodies wear the dyed robes of yellow and brown, your minds remain unstained by the pure Dharma of the Great Vehicle. Though you beg for alms, traversing many places, you have never sought the nourishment of the Great Vehicle’s Dharma.

All you great assemblies, though you are vast in number, you have not yet, for the sake of the true Dharma, severed the bonds that bind you. Now I truly command you: I am still present, and the assembly is gathered. The true nature of Dharma is unshaken. Therefore, you must be diligent, gather your minds with courage, and shatter the bonds that fetter you. Once the sun of wisdom in the ten directions has set, you will be shrouded in ignorance.

All you assemblies of Dharma, just as the earth’s mountains and herbs serve the needs of beings, so too does my Dharma give rise to the wondrous, sweet ambrosia of the Dharma, the sovereign remedy for the afflictions of all beings. Now I shall establish all beings—and my fourfold assembly of disciples—within the secret treasury. I too shall abide therein before ascending to the upper realms.

What is this secret treasury? It is like the three times—past, present, and future—unbroken in their continuity. Why? The past does not depart, the present does not abide, the future does not arrive. Arrival has no source, departure no destination. The upper, middle, and lower are likewise: the upper is not above, the middle is not within, the lower is not below; there is no going, no staying. All Dharmas are thus. The three times are distinct, yet they do not point toward the upper realms. You must contemplate them in this way. When the time comes, I shall return to the upper realms.

Then, hearing the Heavenly Worthy’s resolve to ascend, all the assemblies of Dharma were filled with sorrow. Their hair stood on end, tears streamed down their faces, and they bowed at his feet, circumambulating him countless times before addressing the Heavenly Worthy:

“Heavenly Worthy, your wondrous teaching on impermanence, suffering, emptiness, and non-self—among all thoughts, the perception of impermanence is supreme, just as the bird’s footprint is the finest among all tracks. If one diligently cultivates this perception, it can eradicate all craving in the desire realm, attachment to form and the formless, ignorance, arrogance, and the perception of impermanence itself.

Heavenly Worthy, Great Sage, if you were free from the perception of impermanence, you would not now be preparing to ascend. Yet if you have not yet transcended it, how can you say that cultivating the perception of impermanence severs the three realms’ craving, ignorance, arrogance, and the perception of impermanence?

Heavenly Worthy, it is like a farmer who, in autumn, deeply plows the earth to uproot weeds. The perception of impermanence is likewise—it eradicates all craving in the desire realm, attachment to form and the formless, ignorance, arrogance, and the perception of impermanence itself. Just as autumn plowing is supreme among all tilling, and the bird’s footprint is finest among all tracks, so too is the perception of impermanence foremost among all thoughts.

Heavenly Worthy, it is like a king who, knowing his end is near, pardons all prisoners in his realm, releasing them from their bonds before he departs. Heavenly Worthy, you should do the same: liberate all beings from ignorance and delusion, freeing them from their fetters before ascending.

Yet we have not yet been liberated—how can you now abandon us and ascend to the upper realms?

Heavenly Worthy, it is like one possessed by a ghost, who, upon encountering a skilled exorcist, is freed by the power of incantations. So too do you, Heavenly Worthy, dispel the ghost of ignorance for all assemblies of Dharma, enabling them to abide in the great merit of goodness.

It is like a fragrant bird bound by humans—though a skilled master may be present, it cannot be restrained until its bonds are severed, and it flies away at will. We have not yet broken free from the fifty-seven fetters of affliction—how can you now abandon us and ascend?

Heavenly Worthy, it is like one afflicted by malaria, who, upon meeting a skilled physician, is cured of suffering. We too suffer from many afflictions—the illnesses of perverse cold and heat—yet though we have encountered you, our maladies remain unhealed. We have not attained the supreme, secure, and eternal bliss—how can you now abandon us and ascend?

Heavenly Worthy, it is like a drunkard who, unaware of himself, fails to recognize kin or strangers, mother or daughter, elder or younger sister, and wanders in confusion, indulging in reckless speech and lewdness, lying in filth. Then a skilled physician gives him medicine to induce vomiting, and upon regaining sobriety, he recalls his actions with shame, reproaching himself: ‘Wine is evil, the root of all wrongs. If I can sever it, I will distance myself from all transgressions.’

Heavenly Worthy, we too have been intoxicated by the cycle of birth and death, drunk on the passions of the senses, mistaking non-mothers for mothers, non-sisters for sisters, non-daughters for daughters, and non-beings for beings. Thus we revolve in suffering, like the drunkard lying in filth.”

Heavenly Worthy, now bestow upon me the medicinal Dharma, that I may vomit forth the afflictive wine of defilements. Yet I have not yet awakened—why does the Heavenly Worthy now intend to abandon us and ascend to the Upper Realm?

Heavenly Worthy, it is like one who praises the plantain tree, believing it to be solid and firm—there is no such truth in it. Heavenly Worthy, so too are sentient beings: if one extols the self, person, sentient being, or lifespan, nurturing perceptions of knowing, acting, and receiving, claiming these to be real—there is no such truth in it. We, like this, cultivate the thought of no-self.

Heavenly Worthy, as dregs of fermented drink are of no further use, so too is this body—without self, without master. Heavenly Worthy, as the seven-leafed flower has no fragrance, so too is this body—without self, without master. We, like this, constantly cultivate the thought of no-self.

As the Venerable One has said, all dharmas are without the thought of self, and you, the assembly of dharmas, ought to cultivate thus. Having cultivated in this way, you will dispel the arrogance of self; having parted from the arrogance of self, you will ascend to the Upper Realm.

Heavenly Worthy, it is like a bird’s track appearing in the sky—there is no such truth in it. If one cultivates the thought of no-self, yet clings to various views—there is no such truth in it.

Thereupon, the Heavenly Worthy praised the assembly of dharmas: Excellent, excellent! You have skillfully cultivated the thought of no-self.

Then the assembly of dharmas addressed the Heavenly Worthy: We do not merely cultivate the thought of no-self, but further cultivate other thoughts as well—namely, the thoughts of suffering, impermanence, and no-self.

Heavenly Worthy, it is like a drunkard whose mind is dizzy and confused, seeing mountains and rivers, cities and palaces, the sun, moon, and stars all whirling about. Heavenly Worthy, those who do not cultivate the thoughts of suffering, impermanence, no-self, and the like—such persons cannot be called noble. They are full of heedlessness and drift through the cycle of birth and death. Heavenly Worthy, for this reason, we diligently cultivate these thoughts.

Thereupon, the Heavenly Worthy addressed the great assembly: Listen carefully, listen carefully. The drunkard analogy you have just cited grasps only the words, not their meaning. What, then, is the meaning?

It is like the drunkard who sees the sun and moon above and, though they do not actually revolve, conceives them as revolving. So too are sentient beings: covered by the defilements of ignorance, they generate inverted thoughts—conceiving no-self as self, impermanence as permanence, impurity as purity, and suffering as happiness. Though they generate these thoughts, they do not grasp their meaning, like the drunkard who, where there is no turning, conceives a turning.

The *self* is the meaning of the Dao; *permanence* is the meaning of the Dharma-body; *happiness* is the meaning of the Upper Realm; *purity* is the meaning of the Dharma.

Why, O assembly of dharmas, do you say that those who cling to the thought of self are haughty, quarrelsome, and drift through the cycle of birth and death? If you cultivate the thoughts of impermanence, suffering, and no-self as I have taught, these three kinds of cultivation are without precious meaning. I shall now expound a cultivation superior to these three.

To conceive suffering as happiness, happiness as suffering—this is inverted Dharma. To conceive impermanence as permanence, permanence as impermanence—this is inverted Dharma. To conceive no-self as self, self as no-self—this is inverted Dharma. To conceive impurity as purity, purity as impurity—this is inverted Dharma. These are the four inverted dharmas. Those who do not know the correct cultivation of dharmas are like this.

You, the assembly of dharmas, in the midst of suffering generate the thought of happiness; in the midst of impermanence, the thought of permanence; in the midst of no-self, the thought of self; in the midst of impurity, the thought of purity. In the world, there is permanence, happiness, self, and purity; in the supramundane, there is also permanence, happiness, self, and purity. The worldly Dharma has words but no meaning; the supramundane has both words and meaning.

Why is this? The worldly Dharma has the four inversions, and thus does not know the meaning. Why? There is the inversion of thought, the inversion of mind, and the inversion of view. Due to these three inversions, worldly people see suffering in happiness, impermanence in permanence, no-self in self, and impurity in purity—this is called inversion. Due to inversion, worldly people know the words but not the meaning.

What, then, is the meaning? *No-self* is birth-and-death. *Self* is the Heavenly Worthy. *Impermanence* is the teaching of the Voice-Hearers and Conditioned. *Permanence* is the Dharma-body of the Heavenly Worthy. *Suffering* is all external paths. *Happiness* is the Upper Realm. *Impurity* is conditioned dharmas. *Purity* is the true Dharma possessed by all Heavenly Worthies and Perfected Ones. This is called non-inversion. Due to non-inversion, one knows both the words and the meaning.

If you wish to be far removed from the four inversions, you should know thus: permanence, happiness, self, and purity.

Then the assembly of dharmas again addressed the Heavenly Worthy: As the Heavenly Worthy has said, those who part from the four inversions come to know permanence, happiness, self, and purity. The Heavenly Worthy is now forever free from the four inversions and has already realized permanence, happiness, self, and purity. If you have realized permanence, happiness, self, and purity, why do you not remain for half an eon or a full eon to teach and guide us, enabling us to part from the four inversions, rather than abandoning us to ascend to the Upper Realm?

If the Heavenly Worthy would but deign to look upon us with compassion and instruct us, we would wholeheartedly receive and cultivate your teachings. If the Heavenly Worthy is to ascend to the Upper Realm, how can we remain here with these poisonous bodies, cultivating the pure practice? We too shall follow the Heavenly Worthy to the Upper Realm.

Thereupon, the Heavenly Worthy addressed the assembly of dharmas: You ought not speak thus. I have now entrusted all my supreme true Dharma to the Venerable Lord Lao. This Lord Lao shall serve as your great refuge, just as the Heavenly Worthy serves as the refuge for all sentient beings. Lord Lao shall likewise be your refuge.

It is like a great king who rules over many lands. When he travels abroad, he entrusts all state affairs to his ministers.

The Heavenly Worthy is likewise: all true Dharma has been entrusted to Lord Lao. You ought to know that the impermanent and suffering notions you previously cultivated are not real. It is like in spring, when many people bathe in a great pond and play upon boats, and one loses a beryl jewel, which sinks into the deep water. All then enter the water to seek the jewel, each grasping at tiles, stones, grass, and sand, each claiming to have found the beryl jewel and joyfully bringing it out—only to discover it is not real. The jewel remains in the water, and by its power, the water becomes perfectly clear. The assembly then sees the jewel still beneath the water, as if gazing up at the moon in the empty sky. Among them, one wise person employs skillful means, enters the water calmly, and at once obtains the jewel.

You, the assembly of dharmas, ought not cultivate notions of impermanence, suffering, no-self, and impurity as if they were true, just as those people mistook tiles, stones, grass, and sand for the jewel. You should instead diligently study skillful means, cultivating in every place and at all times the notions of self, permanence, bliss, and purity.

You ought further to know that the four marks you previously cultivated are all inverted. To truly cultivate these notions, you must be like that wise person who skillfully retrieved the jewel—namely, the notions of self, permanence, bliss, and purity.

Thereupon, the assembly of dharmas addressed the Heavenly Worthy: "As the Heavenly Worthy previously taught, all dharmas are without self, and you instructed us to cultivate this. Having cultivated it, one abandons the notion of self; having abandoned the notion of self, one abandons arrogance; having abandoned arrogance, one attains the Upper Realm. How is this to be understood?"

The Heavenly Worthy replied to the assembly of dharmas: "Excellent, excellent! You now skillfully inquire into this meaning to resolve your own doubts. It is like a king who is dull-witted and lacking in discernment, who employs a physician of stubborn ignorance. The king, unable to distinguish, grants him generous emoluments. This physician treats all illnesses with milk alone, unaware of the root causes of disease. Though he knows of milk as a remedy, he does not properly understand illnesses of wind, cold, or heat, and prescribes milk for all ailments. The king, unable to discern the physician’s competence or the quality of the milk, simply accepts it.

Then a skilled physician, versed in the eight branches of medicine and proficient in treating all diseases, arrives from afar. The former physician, failing to seek instruction, instead harbors resentment and contempt. The skilled physician then humbly attaches himself, requesting to become a disciple, and seeks the secret methods of medicine, saying to the former physician: 'I now beseech you to be my teacher. I only wish that you would expound and clarify the teachings.' The former physician replies: 'If you can serve me for forty-eight years, only then will I teach you the medical arts.' The skilled physician immediately accepts his instruction: 'I shall do as you say. I shall do as you say. I shall serve you to the best of my ability.'

Thereupon, the former physician leads the visiting physician to see the king. The visiting physician then explains to the king various medical methods and other arts, saying: 'Great King, you ought to discern carefully: this method may be used to govern the state, and this method may be used to treat illness.' Upon hearing this, the king at last recognizes the former physician’s foolishness and ignorance, immediately banishes him from the kingdom, and thereafter doubles his reverence for the visiting physician.

The visiting physician then thinks: 'Now is the time to instruct the king.' He addresses the king: 'If the Great King truly cherishes me, grant me one wish.' The king replies: 'From my right arm to the rest of my body, I shall grant you whatever you desire.' The visiting physician says: 'Though the king offers me his entire body, I dare not ask for much. My sole request is that the king issue a decree forbidding all within the kingdom from consuming the former physician’s milk remedies from this day forward. Why? Because this medicine is poisonous and causes great harm.'"

"If any still consume it, their heads shall be struck off." Having thus severed the use of milk remedies, there were no longer those who died untimely deaths, and all dwelt in peace and happiness—this was the wish he sought. The king replied: "What you ask is but a trifling matter." He immediately issued a decree throughout the kingdom that no sick person was to use milk as medicine, and if any did so, their heads would be struck off.

At that time, the visiting physician compounded various medicines—pungent, bitter, salty, sweet, and intoxicating flavors—to treat all manner of illnesses, and none failed to recover. Before long, the king fell ill again and summoned the physician: "I am gravely ill now. How should I be treated?" The physician diagnosed the king’s condition and determined that milk medicine was required. He promptly addressed the king: "For Your Majesty’s ailment, milk should be taken. My earlier prohibition of milk was not truthful. If taken now, it would most effectively cure the illness. Your Majesty suffers from heat, and milk is precisely what should be consumed."

The king said to the physician: "Are you now mad or feverish? How can you say that milk will cure this illness? You first called it poison, and now you say it should be taken—are you trying to deceive me? The former physician praised it, and you called it poison, driving him away. Now you say it is good and most effective in curing illness. By your words, my former physician was surely superior to you."

The visiting physician then said to the king: "Your Majesty should not speak thus. Just as worms eating wood may by chance form characters, yet the worms themselves do not know whether they are words or not, and a wise person seeing this would never claim the worms understand writing, nor would they be astonished. Your Majesty should know that the former physician was like this: he did not distinguish between illnesses and prescribed milk for all, just as the worm’s path happened to form characters. The former physician did not understand the good or bad, the wholesome or harmful qualities of milk medicine."

The king asked: "How did he not understand?" The physician replied: "Milk medicine is both poison and ambrosia. Why is milk also called ambrosia? If the cow does not eat distillers’ grains, smooth grass, or wheat chaff; if its calf is well-tempered; if its grazing ground is neither high nor low and damp; if it drinks clear water; if it is not made to run; if it is not kept with the calf in the same herd; if its diet and rest are properly regulated—then such milk can cure all illnesses and is called ambrosial medicine. Apart from this, all other milk is poison."

Upon hearing this, the king praised him: "Great physician, excellent! Excellent! Only today have I come to know the good and bad, the wholesome and harmful qualities of milk medicine." He then consumed it, and his illness was cured. Immediately, he issued a decree throughout the kingdom that from that day forward, milk medicine was to be taken. When the people heard this, they were filled with anger and resentment, saying to one another: "The king is now possessed by a demon or has gone mad with delusion, ordering us to consume milk again." All the people, harboring anger, gathered before the king.

The king said: "You should not be so resentful toward me. Whether milk medicine is taken or not is entirely the physician’s instruction, not my fault." Then the king and all the people leapt for joy, doubling their reverence and offerings to the physician. All who were ill consumed milk medicine.
