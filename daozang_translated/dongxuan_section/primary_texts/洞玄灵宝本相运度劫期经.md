*The Scripture on the Original Forms and Cyclical Salvation Through Kalpas of the Cavern Mystery and Numinous Treasure*

Once, the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy, dwelling in the Cavern-Floating Mountains, addressed the Daoist Yanming, saying: "How long have you resided in these mountains?"

Yanming replied: "Your disciple has dwelt in this realm for three million kalpas."

The Heavenly Worthy said: "You have lived in this realm for three million kalpas—have you encountered any wondrous chapters or rare and marvelous beings?"

Yanming answered: "Since dwelling in this land for three million kalpas, the orchid groves have never withered, nor have the phoenixes ever died. The leaves of the trees in these groves bear the celestial script of the Great Primal Chaos, and nine-colored phoenixes perpetually feed upon them. These birds, in the six periods of day and night, emit extraordinary sounds. When they sing, all men and women in the kingdom turn toward their voices in reverence. Every man and woman in the land bears a golden countenance, and their lifespans extend to three hundred and sixty thousand years, with none meeting an untimely end.

Within this kingdom lies a pool refined by fire, its waters surging and frothing, swirling in patterns resembling the celestial script of the Great Primal Chaos. Once every three years, the men and women of the kingdom visit this fiery pool to bathe their forms, though they know not the cause or origin of this practice.

The people of this land do not know the Three Treasures to be revered, nor do they commit evil deeds. They follow the transformations of nature, living as freely as birds or deer. I only beseech the Heavenly Worthy to reveal the cause and origin of these things, that all in the kingdom may hear and understand."

The Heavenly Worthy replied:

This land’s men and women are innocent, their lifespans long and free from untimely death. In the first year of the Red Clarity era, I composed here the celestial script of the Great Primal Chaos, refining its characters with fire and channeling their essence into the pool, whence the script’s forms arose. Every three years, the kingdom’s men and women visit the fiery pool to bathe their bodies and drink its waters, which regulate their inner harmony for three years—thus their lives are prolonged, all by virtue of this celestial script of the Great Primal Chaos. At that time, fragrant grasses swept the ground, and the Dao transformed into orchid groves, their leaves bearing the script’s original forms. The leaves bore celestial patterns, and the phoenixes and birds that fed upon them gained long life and voices of refined beauty. Do you understand?

From this day forth, the celestial cycle shall hasten, and the true script will be reclaimed to the Purple Tenuity Palace in the Supreme Vastness’ upper capital. Thereafter, human lifespans will grow short, the Five Turbidities will stir with restless strife, and wild heterodoxies will surge forth to disrupt and harm. Rulers will turn rapacious and violent, wars will erupt without cause, and pestilence will spread, amplifying their cruelty. The people will sicken and die in chaos, their fates—whether man or woman—left to chance, without reason or principle.

Moved by pity, I composed the celestial script of the Great Primal Chaos and traversed the lands to expound the Dao, delivering the lost through the Law. If there are good men and good women who cultivate virtue and the Way, they may forever escape this evil age and attain the blessings of the future’s realm of non-action.

Flame Clarity replied: This matter is ancient and profound, beyond the discernment of those with shallow wisdom or foolish hearts. To hear this teaching today and learn the origin of these things is a fortune unmatched in a lifetime.

The Heavenly Worthy said: The celestial cycle hastens, and the true script is withdrawn beyond the Great Veil to the Jade Vastness’ Mystic Terrace in the Purple Tenuity Palace. The Five Turbidities will surge with restless strife, human lifespans will grow ever shorter, and wild heterodoxies will rush forth to afflict and harm. The people will sicken and die in chaos. In such suffering, there is none to blame—only through reverence, incense offerings, and prayers to escape this evil age and seek the boundless blessings of the future may one endure. By such deeds, one may balance their fate; with further merit, they may escape calamity and later attain great fortune.

The answer states: The Three Treasures are the origin of the Dao and the foundation of salvation across the world. The Three Actions are the pathways of divine perfected beings and the routes by which all sages proceed. Perpetual fasting is the supreme practice of true immortals and the beginning of severing karmic knots. Almsgiving is the boundless Dao-field where the Seven Treasures naturally abide. As for the Five Precepts, they bring peace without endless suffering, ensuring the continuity of the human path. The Forty-Five Contemplations are the radiant practice of great compassion, distinguishing the Three Evils from beginning to end. Building dwellings brings immeasurable tranquility, with palaces ever following one’s steps. Offerings ensure that in movement and stillness, one is never hungry or wanting, for the celestial kitchens are ever naturally present. Aiding those parched and destitute brings constant safety in going and staying, free from all other suffering. Constructing bridges to ferry others across ensures that in times of peril, one does not perceive peril, for heavenly spirits ever lend their support. Bestowing alms brings joy to the gods in the empty sky, and Daoists manifest their profound sincerity. Chanting the Dao brings constant fulfillment in coming and going, and in life and death, one attains a human lord. In all such practices, there is none that does not bring fulfillment. Those who act accordingly find every intention realized; what the heart dwells upon, the mouth speaks, and in hesitation, the feet hasten. When heart, mouth, and action align, harmonious light pervades, and the spirit is complete. If emotions oppose and conflict, even a hundred attempts find no one to aid; though one may temporarily gain slight favor, Heaven will surely reclaim it. To practice learning without intent is like straying from the path and falling into a pit; restraining desires is perilous within, while indulging them casts one into the vast sea. When dust-like thoughts arise, burning and vexing, only the solitary true thought remains. One must not be agitated by external disturbances, nor allow the slightest defilement to take hold. Even the slightest attachment can seize a person, obscuring the original resolve of the heart. A hundred afflictions open through the slightest gaps, yet all may receive the supreme Dharma. Use it when needed, and set it aside when not; what is born is born, and what is not born remains unborn. If scholars do not reflect carefully, demonic desires will arise without doubt. Entrusting actions to wise discernment, the path becomes smooth and level. From beginning to end, there is no decay, and the spirit delights in aiding the Dao. With merit established and affairs accomplished, the Dao King rejoices. One receives the prophecy of the supreme realm, profound and boundless in wisdom, forever parting from the hundred afflictions, sharing the divine wisdom of the myriad perfected beings.

Yanming asked: In the future, should the Five Turbidities of the evil age arise, with wild heterodoxies and all manner of calamities disturbing the good and upright, bringing illness and death without reason—how then?

The Heavenly Worthy replied: By cultivating all meritorious deeds and practicing the Dao’s methods, with merit universally perfected, one may deliver all beings from the evil age. Yet if one is pressed by official duties, oppressed from above and burdened below, suffering and afflicting all beings, unable to advance in merit or retreat from death, with official matters and illnesses vying to torment—how can one escape such dire straits?

The sagely ones, in their great compassion, respond to the world’s suffering. How could they not urge us? How could they not urge us?

The Heavenly Worthy declared: Excellent is your question, most essential and wondrous. Listen carefully, listen carefully, as I tell you the methods to relieve suffering and deliver from distress.

In the first year of the Red Brightness era, on the first *yin* day of the first month, the celestial light shone brilliantly, the sun and moon radiated their splendor, a numinous wind swept away the dust, and the mountains and peaks concealed the clouds. At that time, this Dharma was revealed, foreseeing the coming end of the kalpa’s final age, when warfare and illness would spread, and human lifespans would grow short. Thus, the method of extending life and delivering the world from death was opened in the Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace, the Dao of relieving distress, saving from suffering, and rescuing from peril. Therefore, the *Scripture of Divine Incantations* in ten scrolls was expounded to save all beings from suffering and distress. If any being encounters illness, official matters, imprisonment, or any calamity, and can recite, sincerely uphold, copy, and make offerings to this scripture, they will in the future be reborn in *Tushita*, and in time, all will emerge together, able to witness the present world, forever ending in health and fortune.

If any being, beset by suffering and distress, cannot access the *Scripture of Divine Incantations* in ten scrolls, the *Vows of Demons* and *Incantations Against Evil* in two scrolls are indispensable. Even if one’s strength is insufficient, a single scroll can still deliver from distress and peril, bringing peace in this life. Why is this so? These two scrolls can summon the thirty-five great demon kings, the thirty-six great evil ghosts of the world, and subdue all the ghostly spirits of the Six Heavens. If any do not comply with the divine incantations’ methods, the demon kings can be cast into the abyss, into fire, or beheaded ten thousand times, their heads shattered into ten thousand pieces, without remorse.

Furthermore, there are the Medicine Kings and Medicine Lords, who annually gather herbs from the Snow Mountains, compounding and refining them to save all from illness and suffering. If any being, amidst illness and distress, cannot obtain medicine, they need only single-mindedly contemplate the two medicines, and the perfected ones will prepare excellent remedies to heal the people, all recovering and growing well. One must maintain right thought and right mindfulness, and illness can be cured; if the mind wanders and right mindfulness is absent, recovery is impossible.

Moreover, there are the seven perfected beings of the Upper Primordial Yang, the six divine immortals, and the names of the thirteen perfected beings who attained the Dao in past ages. When facing peril that cannot be escaped, one need only sincerely invoke their names, and the thirteen perfected beings will immediately respond to rescue and protect, ensuring complete peace. Without sincerity, even calling ten thousand times will not summon the divine perfected beings.

This Upper Primordial Yang’s supreme method delivers people from distress and rescues all suffering beings in the world. If any being is without sons or daughters, and can sincerely uphold, copy, recite, and contemplate this scripture, all their wishes will be fulfilled. Furthermore, the *Supreme Numinous Treasure for Delivering All Beings* can be copied, recited, and chanted in purification rites, and all wishes will be fulfilled without exception. Why is this so? This scripture contains the hidden sounds of the heavens, most revered and wondrous beyond all thought. If any being suffers from illness, death, official matters, or imprisonment, and can establish a purification rite and recite it ten times, the deceased will depart from the dark sufferings, ascend to heaven, and receive blessings naturally.

If one encounters distress and hardship, calling upon the names of the Thirty-Two Heavens with utmost sincerity and prayer will bring deliverance without fail. Furthermore, the names of the Twenty-Five Perfected of Great Clarity can also rescue one from distress, wondrous beyond all thought. The secret names of the Six Heavenly Demon Kings from the *True Scripture of the Great Cavern* likewise deliver one from hardship. The names of the Twelve Perfected Lords from the *Boundless Divine Scriptures*, when recited with utmost sincerity, also rescue one from distress. The names of the Nine Heavens from the *True Scripture of Samādhi* can likewise deliver one from hardship. The names of the Five Visceral True Spirits from the *Exegesis of the Dao and Its Virtues* Sections, when invoked with utmost sincerity, guard and protect the body, pacify and secure the hun and po souls, allowing the spirit to be serene and settled, avoiding all misfortunes, and fulfilling every wish.

If one can contemplate the boundless and infinite, whenever one directs their thoughts, pondering, recalling, invoking, and calling upon them, all will be granted, and every desire fulfilled.

Yanming said: All beings who thus contemplate, thus reflect, and call upon the names of the sages will be delivered from distress and receive blessings. Yet beings do not believe in such contemplation, nor trust in the existence of the sages’ names. Only when they encounter misfortune and suffering do they turn their thoughts to the mysterious workings, entrust themselves to the Daoist gate, and with utmost sincerity call upon the names of the sages—will their efforts bear fruit?

The Heavenly Worthy replied: Yes.
Why is this so?
For the initial sincerity is precious, and the later fruition is to be esteemed.

Those who can fully engage both body and mind may be called excellent—how could their efforts fail to bear fruit? Yet those who cultivate the Dao without faith in merit and virtue resign themselves to the cycles of life and death, unaware of the karmic wheel of cause and effect and retribution. They do not study the scriptures of the various traditions, dismissing them as empty words. Should they encounter a starving scholar, emaciated and near death, and take pity upon seeing him, unable to bear his suffering, they might support him to a place of abundance, feeding him sweet broth and fine gruel. After the first meal, his complexion brightens with joy; after the second, his strength returns to walk with vigor; after the third, his speech flows with eloquence; after the fourth, his wisdom and vitality arise naturally. Thus, the starving man’s life is saved, his name and fate preserved. With three days and five meals, the five virtues are complete. Such a person’s name is then inscribed in the Eastern Flower Register, his death stricken from the Northern Ledger, and he is nourished by faith and compassion. If such is the fruit of kindness, how much more so when one, in distress, calls upon the sages for deliverance?

The sages ever attend to those in peril, never forsaking the ignorant or destitute. They constantly repay enmity with virtue and transform those with sincere hearts. Though one may have had no prior connection with them, if they turn in earnest devotion, how could their plea go unanswered? It is like the spirit of the valley: it responds to every inquiry, never choosing which voice to answer. The response of the sages is likewise.

Someone asked: If a virtuous man cultivates the three karmic actions, perfects all dharmas, fulfills every good deed, and exhausts all contemplation, what becomes of his Dao?

The answer: It is recorded in the *Ten Immortals*. Why? When all practices are complete, virtue flourishes and shines forth, the weight of defilements is extinguished, and merit is fully inscribed.

Someone asked: If a woman cultivates the three karmic actions, perfects all dharmas, fulfills every good deed, and exhausts all contemplation, what becomes of her Dao?

The answer: She is granted a transformed form. Why? A woman’s past merit was humble, which is why she was born in a female body. Now that her merit and practice are complete, her name is inscribed in the record of merit, and none can take it from her. Yet she must still transform from female to male before attaining this fruit.

Someone asked: Can the Ten Immortals be achieved all at once? Or is there a revolving progression?

The answer: From the First Immortal to the Tenth, each has its proper sequence; they cannot be treated as equal or made to revolve together. Why? Some may be ordinary beings yet practice the Ten Immortals; others may be voice-hearers who have not awakened and cannot practice even one. Thus, practice varies in refinement, insight in depth, and application in degree—all depending on the heart.

Someone asked: In the method of the learned adept, should one tally the body, the heart, the actions, the merit, or the years? If one cultivates the body, it need not be arduous; if one follows the heart, it need not tally the body; if one counts the actions, it need not be meticulous; if one counts the merit, it need not be ascetic; if one counts the years, it need not be diligent. The proper balance of advance and retreat remains unclear. I pray the Heavenly Worthy enlighten the unenlightened, that all beings may fully understand.

The answer: The heart does not tally the body; merit is counted, not years. Why? A learned adept may go through countless rebirths yet not attain a single fruit.

A learned adept may rise within a single chamber to practice the Dao and attain the rank of immortal. Thus, merit is reckoned by the heart’s arising, counted by the heart’s intent, and perfected through action to reach the True.

Someone asked: All things under heaven arise from the Dao and qi. Since they are born, should they not all possess *ming*? Do earth, water, stone, and iron alone lack *ming*?

The answer: These four things possess nature but not *ming*. Why? They have nature but no *ming* because they lack blood, veins, sap, or color. Thus, they have nature but no *ming*.

Someone asked: Why do humans possess ten subtle constituents, while plants possess eight?

The answer: Because they lack intention and movement.

Someone asked: Why is the Dao alone called pure?

The answer: Purity means all actions are complete yet free from dust or defilement—hence, it is called pure. All below the Dao remain impure. Why? Externally, it manifests nothing; internally, it bears no dust. Its nature is serene, without gain or loss. It cannot be destroyed by slander nor exalted by praise; it cannot be muddied by disturbance nor clarified by stillness. Vast and empty, nothing compares to it. Drifting without obstruction, it is thus named pure.

Someone asked: Why is the Dao called One?

The answer: The Dao is so named because it is non-action yet nothing is left undone. Lofty without a canopy, deep without a base, above it no higher authority covers, below it no lower foundation supports. Without peer or counterpart, beyond analogy or metaphor, it is vast and empty. Ancestor of all sages, even the countless revered deities of the world revere and follow it to attain the utmost truth. Thus, it alone stands beyond the sacred, beyond thought, without equal—hence, it is called One.

Someone asked: Why is it called the Original Form?

The answer: The Original Form is so named by scriptural designation. Why? The *Original* refers to the unfolding of the Dao’s teachings, the illumination of sacred arts, the establishment of the Dharma realm, and the beginning of its transmission. The *Form* refers to the Dao’s laws opening the path, guiding beings through images, traversing the three realms, and radiating brilliant light. All beings in the ten directions receive the merit of its majestic form. Thus, the two names—Original and Form—were established at the inception, the foundation of all teachings. All perfected beings revere and receive it as the root of attaining the Dao and the beginning of accomplishment. Hence, it is called the Original Form.

Someone asked: How did heaven and earth come to be? How were the sun and moon established? How were the stars arrayed in their constellations?

The answer: When heaven and earth first arose, human lifespans were long, and evil thoughts were absent. The Dao’s qi was pure, and governance was effortless. As worldly rulers grew corrupt and people gradually turned to wickedness, the Dao’s qi became shallow, and the celestial cycle shortened. Heavenly demons descended, and heterodox ways spread unchecked. Rulers grew tyrannical, wars ravaged lives, and pestilential qi spread, aiding their cruelty. The unborn were harmed, infants perished, and the innocent suffered. The world fell into despair, plagued by war. Men and women lived in longing, their faces marked by sorrow. Even the wealthy were stripped of their wealth by taxes. Men could not marry, women could not wed. Men and women missed their proper time, and this grievance reached the celestial spirits. The balance of yin and yang was disrupted, floods and droughts struck together, frost and hail damaged the five grains, and people starved. They abandoned their homes, plundered one another, and even resorted to cannibalism.

Some licentious men and untimely women issued private decrees and made mutual oaths. Beneath the sun, moon, and stars, or beside mountains, rivers, and shrines, they swore curses, abandoned their households, and sought verification. True spirits and venomous ghosts seized upon these oaths, causing male infants to be harmed at birth and female infants to die young. Ghostly armies aided their cruelty, and people died without reason. Bandits rose in competition, officials devoured the common folk, and the destitute wailed in despair, their grievances rising to heaven. Lifespans gradually shortened, and few lived beyond thirty. Boys matured at eight, girls at seven.

In such an age, the celestial cycle hastened, and all was chaos beyond description. Scorching yang surged against yin, clashing and pressing together. Yang’s poison and yin’s wrath ignited fires in rivers and seas, burning the cosmos to ash. Above, the sky lost its color; below, the earth lost its depths. All was hollow and empty, vast winds howling, crimson qi spreading everywhere.

Then, the recorded sages were dispatched, bearing censers and keys to restore and expand the cosmos. The pure qi ascended to form heaven, the turbid qi descended to form earth. The pure spread the yang path, the turbid spread the yin path. They measured heaven and earth, establishing the four directions—east, west, south, north—and the four corners, above, below, and the center.

Then, the mighty spirit Huhai was sent to construct mountains and rivers, the Five Peaks and Four Waterways, channeling them to their oceanic sources. The recorded sage-rulers, nurtured in the mysterious center with the numinous treasure’s true essence, condensed the sun, moon, and stars. The sun governs the yang path, moving one degree per day; the moon governs the yin path, moving thirteen degrees per day. Three hundred sixty-five degrees complete one celestial cycle. The sun spans a thousand *li*, the moon twelve hundred *li*, and the distance between heaven and earth is one hundred five thousand *li*.

Mount Kunlun stands at the earth’s center, comprising eighty-one tiers—also called the Eighty-One Heavens. The four faces of Kunlun are named the Four Continents, each governed by a Heavenly King who serves the Supreme Unity. Kunlun is the source of the Four Seas. Why? The four great seas emerge from its base, swirling outward in all directions before settling into the abyss. This abyss is three million three hundred sixty thousand *zhang* deep and thirty-six thousand five hundred *li* wide, aligning with the celestial measurements and requiring a ruler to govern it. This sea hosts thirty-two great dragon kings, who serve the Anavatapta Dragon King, along with millions of celestial dragons and countless dragon offspring.

The Kunlun mountain rises fifteen thousand *li* above the earth. There dwell earthly immortals and divine beings, whose chariot paths ascend from the northeast *jia* land and exit through the southwest *geng* land. The central route winds twelvefold before reaching the summit, which spans three hundred and thirty-six myriad *li*. The divine chariots and oxen remain there to this day.

Heaven and earth, in their creation and transformation, give form to all things, cycling endlessly like the twelve-month system. Thus, among all earthly mountains, Kunlun stands as the highest.

Three hundred myriad *li* south of Kunlun lies another Kunlun mountain, its expanse in the four directions—east, west, south, and north—boundless and immeasurable. The Kunlun illuminated by the sun and moon is called the Four Continents, surpassing all other regions.

From one Kunlun to another, a count of one thousand makes one; from Kunlun to Kunlun, a count of one thousand makes two; from Kunlun to Kunlun, a count of one thousand makes three. When the count reaches one thousand, the lesser count begins at one. From the lesser count of one, when the number reaches one thousand, it is called a lesser thousand. From one lesser thousand to a count of one thousand, it is called one; from one lesser thousand to a count of one thousand, it is called two; from one lesser thousand to a count of one thousand, it is called three. These three counts of one thousand constitute the middle thousand. From the middle thousand to a count of one thousand, it is called one; from the middle thousand to a count of one thousand, it is called two; from the middle thousand to a count of one thousand, it is called three. These three counts of one thousand are called the great thousand. These three thousand worlds are governed by ten immortals, whose transformative manifestations and divine wisdom encompass all within their power.

Thus, the worlds are boundless, sagely wisdom is infinite, the burden of the multitudes has no end, and the power of the Dao knows no cultivation. All embodied beings attain life, virtue has no origin, and independence defies comparison.

Question: When the Heavenly Venerable speaks of the end of heaven and earth’s cycle, the kalpas are exhausted, and all creation renews under a new heaven and earth. The vastness and depth of Kunlun and the great seas have been described. How many years pass before the cycle of adversity concludes? How many years elapse before calamities strike?

Answer: From the formation of heaven and earth to their end, there are three origins and nine adversities, along with great and minor disasters—these cycles cannot be altered. Why? Because when the numbers reach their end, they cannot be changed. What does this mean? The three origins are the upper, middle, and lower. Each origin has three adversities, and their numbers, once complete, cannot be altered. There are nine adversities in total, which neither heaven can alter nor earth can change—their numbers are fixed.

Why? The upper origin’s upper adversity concludes after eighty-one myriad years; its middle adversity after sixty-four myriad years; and its lower adversity after forty-nine myriad years. These are the cyclical numbers of the upper origin’s three adversities, and they cannot be altered. The middle origin’s upper adversity concludes after thirty-six myriad years; its middle adversity after twenty-five myriad years; and its lower adversity after sixteen myriad years. These are the cyclical numbers of the middle origin’s three adversities, and they cannot be altered. The lower origin’s upper adversity concludes after nine myriad years; its middle adversity after four myriad years; and its lower adversity after ten thousand years. These are the cyclical numbers of the lower origin’s three adversities, and they cannot be altered. These are the three origins and nine adversities, whose numerical terms cannot be defied.

Within these nine adversities, each adversity brings three disasters and six harms, which cannot be averted. Every three thousand years, a great disaster strikes, causing the death of people whose bones remain unburied. Every thousand years, a disaster kills half the people, their bones also left unburied. Every hundred years, wars rage across the land, and people perish. These three disasters, once their numbers are due, cannot be altered or averted.

The six harms occur as follows: one harm every three hundred sixty years, one every three hundred years, one every two hundred forty years, one every one hundred eighty years, one every one hundred twenty years, and one every sixty years. These six harms cannot be averted. Within the six harms, there are also three minor disasters. Why? Every thirty years, a disaster brings cattle plagues and grain shortages. Every twelve years, a minor disaster forces the sale of cattle and horses to store food. Every six years, a minor disaster causes cloth and silk to become cheap while rice and wheat grow expensive. These cycles are immutable.

All these—three origins, nine adversities, three disasters, and six harms—cannot be averted. The wise may discern them and avoid or escape them. For minor disasters, such as famine and poor harvests, one should store grain in preparation. Thus, the virtuous dwell where virtue resides, shun the lawless, seek blessed lands, and avoid peril, ensuring they remain free from misfortune. While the world falls into chaos, the virtuous alone remain secure; while all suffer hunger, the virtuous alone have enough.

Thus, the wise observe the times, discern fortune and misfortune, scrutinize the years, and avoid calamities, ensuring they remain free from harm. Therefore, the noble dwell near the virtuous and reap benefits, while the petty cling to their lands and face ruin. One must follow the virtuous.

Yanming said: I have received your teaching. I wish to ask further. In the great thousand worlds, all beings possess the nature of the Dao, though they lack its truth. When the cycle of destruction ends, what becomes of their nature?

Answer: When the cycle of destruction concludes, all beings universally cultivate compassionate hearts and aspire to the Dao’s realm. At the end of this kalpa, they attain the Dao in due time. Only those born from bubbles drift and float, yet they do not perish. Why? Because their seed is preserved. Thus, all myriad beings retain their seed and do not universally ascend.

Question: If all beings universally attain the Dao’s truth, do they become one in substance with the Great Dao?

Answer: When all beings attain the Dao and become immortals, they are called *World-Honored Ones*, and in this, their attainment is complete. Only the qi of the Great Dao may be obtained—none can merge to equal its measure. Why? It is like a starving man who longs for satiety; once sated, he forgets his hunger. Thus, the perfected arise from insufficiency yet forget their former want, attaining sufficiency and forgetting insufficiency.

Question: Can the nature of the Dao be seen?

Answer: It cannot be seen, yet through attainment, it becomes visible. Thus, what is visible remains unfulfilled, striking the eye yet unseen. Why? Even an immortal or perfected one perceives but one ten-thousandth of the Dao’s nature. From *śrāvakas* to those of *perfect enlightenment*, they know progress yet do not perceive it. Those who "know progress" have exhausted all defilements, leaving no afflictions; their spiritual transformations and powers surpass what scholars can attain. Thus, they know progress and forget regression. Even the four paths know progress yet not regression—how much less the two lesser vehicles?

Question: The fruition beings of the three paths all possess fruition conduct. Why are their defilements not eradicated?

Answer: The fruition beings of the three paths may at times have defilements yet do not forget them. The fruition being of the first path has not yet parted from wife, children, or family; their cares and attachments to kin cannot be severed, thus their defilements persist, and they waver between advance and retreat. But those of the four paths and above ascend daily toward the hour of Chen, inevitably reaching the height of Wu. Why? Free from defilements and attachments, they ascend toward Chen and advance toward Wu. Thus, all is preserved without forgetting—hence the analogy.
