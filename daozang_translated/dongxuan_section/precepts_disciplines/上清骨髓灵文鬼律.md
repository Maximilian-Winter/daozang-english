# 上清骨髓灵文鬼律

**Preface to the *Shangqing Gusui Lingwen Guilü* (Upper Clarity Ghost Statutes of the Numinous Writ of Bone and Marrow)**

Composed by Deng Yougong, Servant of the Heavenly Heart Orthodox Rites and Recipient of the *Shangqing Dadong Lu*

I have heard it said in the *Book of Documents*: "The Dao of Heaven blesses the good and calamitizes the licentious." It is also written: "Heaven commands those with virtue; Heaven punishes those with guilt." Thus, the good are surely blessed, the licentious surely calamitized; those with virtue are destined to receive mandate, those with guilt are destined for chastisement—this is the Dao of Heaven. Though Heaven oversees the world below, is this principle manifest only among humans? Even in the hidden realms of ghosts and spirits, it is no different.

For this reason, spirits who render merit to the state and the people are all recorded in the sacrificial canons and accorded due rites. As for perverse and monstrous ghostly beings—those who bring misfortune, plague, demonic possession, or calamity, disturbing the people and harming creatures—there are none for whom measures of governance do not exist. How, then, could their harms be enumerated? It is for this reason that the *Shangqing Gusui Lingwen* has been entrusted to the upright, that they may uphold and enact it.

Its contents comprise three sections: the *Ghost Statutes*, the *Jade Regulations*, and the *Ritual Procedures and Forms*. Collectively, they are known as the *Lingwen of Bone and Marrow*. The *Ghost Statutes* are adjudicated by the Heavenly Courts, administered through the Bureau of Expelling Evil, and executed under the authority of the Northern Emperor. The *Jade Regulations* and *Ritual Procedures and Forms* were specially bestowed upon the Bureau of Expelling Evil by the Jade Emperor for the governance of judgments.

Their essential purpose is to adjudicate the transgressions of ghosts and spirits, assist the upright, expel evil, bring fortune to the people, and defend the state against disaster. I have observed that the texts of the *Jade Regulations* are typically transmitted orally by ordinary ritual masters, while the *Ritual Procedures and Forms* remain obscure and poorly understood. As a result, the *Lingwen* has become fragmented, and only the *Ghost Statutes* remain extant. Even these, however, are not deeply comprehended by vulgar practitioners. Compounded by errors in transmission and copying, their structure and meaning have become disordered, leading to neglect. Now, they are reduced to mere talismanic waters for healing, often resulting in deception—how could this not betray the intent of High Heaven?

The *Lingwen* consists of fifty-six articles, venerating the Northern Culmen as supreme, encompassing the numerical principles of Heaven and Earth, yin and yang, and the Five Phases. It governs the principles of life and death, and all cases where the perverse overcomes the upright are subject to its jurisdiction. The *Jade Regulations* and *Ritual Forms* comprise sixty-four articles, mirroring the ceaseless generative images of the Eight Trigrams. When the *Ghost Statutes* are paired with the *Jade Regulations*, there are sixteen primary articles, totaling seventy-two—corresponding to the cycles of qi. Any transgression is referred to the Seventy-Two Offices of Mount Tai; if even one is missing, the law is incomplete, and the offices are not properly governed.

Thus, the Dao serves as the essence of the law, while the statutes serve as its function. When ghostly beings or perverse qi encroach, they must be rectified through the Dao—hence, it is called the *Orthodox Rite*. The *Ritual Procedures* comprise forty-eight articles: thirty-six correspond to the Thirty-Six Generals, while the remaining twelve represent the spirits of the twelve hours, ever present at one’s side, gathered into a single body—hence, it is called the *Ritual Procedures*. Moreover, the body is the abode of the One True, movement is the transformation of immortality, and stillness is communion with the numinous—is this not the marvel of spontaneity?

Upon careful study of the *Ghost Statutes*, I find their texts detailed and refined. Tracing their origins, they derive from the Ancestral Immortal Rao Dongtian. Originally a prefectural clerk, he was impartial in his duties, strict in enforcing the law, and just in adjudicating cases, winning the satisfaction of the people. His luminous virtue aligned with the celestial patterns, illuminating the earthly realms and revealing these secret texts—the *Ghost Statutes*—as a true gift from August Heaven.

The Ancestral Immortal Dongtian held that though Heaven and humanity differ, their principles are one. Thus, he modeled the statutes after the laws of the state, weighing their severity to establish appropriate punishments. However, ghosts and spirits, though responsive, cannot be physically seized; where whips and cudgels cannot be applied, their crimes are met with hard labor. The *Fengdu Statutes* state that ghosts are punished with the labor of bearing mountains, and dragons with the task of digging ponds—such are their penal servitudes. The *Nüqing Ghost Statutes* declare that when Heaven rounds the three rains, it is akin to exile in the human realm. The *Nine Earth Statutes* speak of the supreme punishment of annihilating form, comparable to execution in the world. The *Xuandu Statutes* describe the dispersal of form and shadow, akin to extrajudicial measures. Applied in the world, these statutes for adjudicating ghosts and spirits are most meticulous.

By fortunate karmic affinity, I have ascended to study the true canons and encountered renowned masters, receiving their transmission. Over a decade, I sought rare manuscripts at the Jade Embankment Abbey on West Mountain in Hongzhou, the Great Peace Abbey on Mount Lu in Jiangzhou, the Simplicity Retreat Abbey in Nankang Prefecture, and the Numinous Immortal Abbey in Shuzhou. I collected five versions of the *Shangqing Ghost Statutes*, collating their errors against the original texts and arranging them in order. The *Ghost Statutes* comprise seven sections and fifty-six articles; the *Jade Regulations*, sixteen articles; and the *Ritual Procedures and Forms*, forty-eight articles—totaling one hundred twenty articles, divided into three scrolls. Each was meticulously examined, ensuring completeness in even the finest details. With the newly and previously obtained texts, I presented them to the Celestial Palaces and submitted them to the Bureau of Expelling Evil and other offices. The responses were clear and unerring, with no omissions—this is the complete edition.

If one were to practice these rites privately, concealing them from the world, their merit would not spread, and I fear it would contravene Heaven’s intent, inviting hidden retribution. Thus, I have transcribed and submitted them. I have also heard that in ancient times, those who governed Heaven with the Dao ensured that even the lowest ghosts were not numinous. It was not that the ghosts lacked numinosity, but that their powers did not harm people—so that neither side harmed the other, and virtue was reciprocally restored.

Then this would be the pinnacle of grand governance—how magnificent indeed!

We humbly reflect that Your Imperial Majesty wields supreme authority, singularly orchestrating the myriad transformations beyond reckoning. The hundred spirits receive their offices, and the common people dwell in peace—surely, the one who governs thus must inherently possess the Dao.

Your servant, in presenting this, does not merely seek to petition its promulgation throughout the realm to broaden its transmission. May all ritual masters under Heaven obtain the complete edition, practice accordingly, and ensure that even in distant lands and remote hamlets, no heretical spirits or malevolent specters may harm the people. This would but slightly aid Your Majesty’s transformative power by a ten-thousandth part.

Your servant respectfully bows and touches his head to the ground in preface.

*End of the Upper Scroll of the Upper Clarity Ghost Statutes of the Essence and Marrow of the Dao*
*Beginning of the Middle Scroll of the Upper Clarity Ghost Statutes of the Essence and Marrow of the Dao*

The Purple Tenuity Palace Attendant, Daily Duty Primordial Lord Ráo of the Cavern-Heaven, having rectified and received the *Great Cavern Record of the Upper Clarity*, now practices the *Orthodox Rites of the Celestial Heart*—Dèng Yǒugōng’s revised edition. **Sixteen Statutes of the Jade Canon:**

All officials of this institute shall wear ritual vestments, star-crowned headdresses, and vermilion shoes. Those not engaged in subduing demonic spirits shall not don them; violators shall be sentenced to one year of penal servitude. Those who, without cause in ritual matters, trouble spirits and deities shall be sentenced to two years of penal servitude.

All officials of this institute, appointed by the *Jade Registers of the Upper Clarity* and governing the demonic spirits of the Three Realms, shall receive the orthodox talismanic writs of the *Central Scriptures*. These shall be inscribed in vermilion and black ink on yellow-flowered silk, bound into scrolls, and duly conferred. The master shall admonish them with strict precepts, and all matters pertaining to the rites—secret incantations and sacred texts—shall be transmitted orally and memorized. None shall be concealed or omitted; violators shall be investigated by the Three Offices.

If any ritual official, capable of transmitting the orthodox rites to a person of the Dao, performs acts of salvation that move the spirits, they may submit an annual memorial for consideration, and exceptional merit shall be rewarded without regard to rank.

Those who fail to memorialize suitable candidates or memorialize unsuitable ones shall be sentenced to one year of penal servitude. Those who transmit seals and oral instructions without prior memorial shall incur the same penalty. If the master becomes aware of such acts within the prescribed period and fails to report them, the penalty shall likewise apply.

If, after being memorialized, one disobeys the master’s instructions or violates ritual propriety, the penalty shall be one year of penal servitude. In cases of grave harm, the master shall report the facts in full, first executing the offender, then punishing their nine clans.

If a Daoist transmits the orthodox rites to save the people, but the master obstructs them for personal gain, the master shall receive one hundred strokes. If bribes are accepted, even one bolt of silk shall incur one year of penal servitude. For every ten bolts, the penalty shall increase by one degree, up to a maximum of three years of penal servitude, and the master shall be demoted by two ranks in ritual office. Accepting less than one bolt shall incur one hundred strokes. Offerings of wine and food shall be treated likewise.

Ritual officials who each year save twenty critically ill persons shall be promoted by one rank. Those who save more than twenty shall be advanced in office according to the celestial register, their merit and conduct memorialized for promotion. If, when petitioned, they refuse to accept cases or delay salvation, or if they falsely promote others in ritual office, they shall be sentenced to one year of penal servitude.

Those who falsely claim ritual office before being memorialized shall be sentenced to two years of penal servitude. If, after memorialization but before the response arrives, improper recommendations or investigations are made, or if one falsely claims a master-disciple relationship, each shall incur two years of penal servitude.

Newly appointed officials of this institute shall practice celestial talismans, star-seal incantations, and pacing the stars, inscribing them on plates of gold, jade, fragrant wood, or other materials. Upon completion, they shall wash the inscriptions away with fragrant water and cast them into flowing waters; violators shall be sentenced to one year of penal servitude.

Those who recklessly transmit the orthodox rites to unworthy persons for profit, or who accept payment but later refuse to transmit them, shall be sentenced to two years of penal servitude. The same penalty applies if no payment is received. Those who falsely present other methods as the orthodox rites shall be sentenced to three years of penal servitude.

Those who show the orthodox rites or ghost statutes to unworthy persons, or who lend or entrust them to others for copying, thereby disrespecting or mocking them, or who discuss or reveal their secrets to uninitiated persons, shall be sentenced to three years of penal servitude. Those who use the rites to toy with spirits shall be sentenced to one year. Those who deliberately cause others to use the rites to entrap spirits shall be sentenced to two years. If death results, the penalty shall be exile to three thousand *li*. Those who fail to maintain solemnity and purity while reading the texts shall be exiled to two thousand *li*.

All memorials to the Upper Clarity shall be submitted through the duty-day functionaries, and documents shall be transmitted to the Five Marchmounts to dispatch local earth deities to capture malevolent spirits. The institute’s divine generals, officers, and soldiers shall be assigned to execute the decrees according to the gravity of the matter. Those who fail to memorialize when required, or memorialize when not required, shall receive one hundred strokes.

When transmitting the celestial scriptures, secret registers, talismans, or orthodox rites to others, one may make copies for storage in the caverns of famous mountains and great rivers, or in stone caskets. When a ritual official’s decrees, talismans, or texts are exhausted upon promotion, all previously received materials shall be burned and cast into rivers or lakes. Only current official documents may be retained. If old ritual vestments, talismans, brushes, ink, vermilion, paper, inkstones, water vessels, coronets, or other worn-out items are not burned but instead wrapped in old vestments and cast into rivers, or if talismans, seals, and other items are buried in cavern-heavens or stone chambers, all such materials shall be concealed according to the oral instructions; violators shall be sentenced to one year of penal servitude.

Those who transmit the orthodox rites shall do so on the days of *jiǎzǐ*, *gēngshēn*, the Three Origins, the Eight Festivals, the Five La days, or their own birthdays. The recipient shall kneel to receive the sword, seal, oral instructions, brush, inkstone, vermilion, and ritual implements, all of which shall be consecrated before use. Any gold, silver, or other valuables received as pledges shall be melted down and sold, the proceeds used for offerings or to aid the poor. None shall be kept for personal use; violators shall be sentenced to three years of penal servitude.

If a ritual official passes away suddenly, having foretold extraordinary signs, it is a celestial blessing, and their departure shall be swift. If no such signs appear, the authorities shall investigate. If the circumstances are unclear, the heir or kin shall promptly burn the talismanic notices, petitions, and ritual vestments to ashes and cast them into the Yangtze River, notifying the water officials to convey them to the deceased. The underworld authorities shall comply; violators shall be sentenced to two years of penal servitude.

When a ritual official’s merit and conduct are complete and they are summoned, their body shall rise twice and fall thrice, like an earthworm. Their ears shall hear the sound of wind, their eyes shall lose their divine light, their celestial pillar shall not rise, and the celestial drum shall not sound. Pain shall arise in the kidney chamber, and their spirit shall surge from the *Yǒngquán* point to exit through the crown. They shall then gather their decrees, registers, talismans, seals, and containers in one place, don fresh ritual vestments, sit upright, and leave final instructions to their heir. Their body shall shed like a cicada’s shell, and a propitious cloud with a celestial retinue shall welcome them, escorting them directly to their cavern-heaven to receive a celestial office and govern affairs.

Should the ritual body sense its decline and prove unable to sustain itself, the local earth deity shall be invoked to assist the heir and kin in securing the decrees, registers, talismans, seals, and containers according to the prescribed method. Violators shall be exiled three thousand *li*; those whose transgressions are grave in both fact and principle shall be put to death.

Here begins the *Lower Scroll of the Divine Writ of the Marrow of the Dao: Ghost Statutes of the Numinous Texts*.

Compiled and revised by Deng Yougong, Registrar of the Purple Clarity Bureau, Daily Attendant of the Celestial Office, and Ordained Master of the Great Cavern Register of the Highest Clarity, Practitioner of the Heavenly Heart Orthodox Dao.

**Thirty-Six Articles**

All authentic ghost statutes, talismanic writs, and scriptures of the orthodox Dao shall be stored in fragrant caskets, brocade satchels, or bamboo containers. When reviewing them, one must enter stillness, establish a sacred boundary, and invoke the spirits before unsealing the scrolls. No more than five may be opened at once. These texts must be guarded in secrecy, lest ghosts and spirits steal a glimpse.

Those among the faithful who drive out evil, uphold the Dao, and truly render aid to beings shall be recorded and memorialized, transmitted the orthodox teachings, and appointed to office with rank.

All ritual implements within the sanctuary—such as swords, seals, brushes, ink, cinnabar, inkstones, headdresses, footwear, and ritual water—may not be privately used without prior petition and offering.

When transmitting the teachings to disciples, the disciple shall approach the master with measured steps, whereupon the master ascends the altar to recite the precepts. The disciple shall then undergo bloodletting, consume the elixir, and divide the ring to break the contract, swearing oaths of allegiance. Next, the master shall confer the esoteric signs, talismanic writs, and revealed scriptures, bestow the true instructions, and kneel to present the official regalia, seals, and swords. The master shall then invoke the Most High, expelling the Three Worms from the four limbs and absolving the myriad sins across the Nine Mysteries. Reports shall be filed with the relevant authorities to ensure alignment with the Heavenly Will.

All spirit generals, officers, and soldiers—such as those dispatched by the Eastern Marchmount—shall, upon arrival at the sanctuary, be received with offerings of wine, food, paper money, and spirit horses. They shall remain in their assigned posts, prepared for deployment, and may not be privately employed.

When ritual masters pass by sacred shrines, they shall form the Mudra of the Heavenly Soldiers, strike the Heavenly Drum, and summon the guardian generals and protective officers within their bodies to accompany them, thereby manifesting majesty. The spirits shall then submit in awe.

Ritual masters shall, at dawn, absorb the vital *qi* of the day’s dominant phase. When drafting memorials or conducting rites, they shall not burn frankincense.

All human lives are endowed by Heaven with allotted lifespan and fortune. If, after this sanctuary’s intercession, the afflicted still do not recover, it is because their fate is exhausted and their kalpa has ended. In such cases, further petitions and documents shall be futile.

When aiding and delivering the world, the language of petitions and decrees must not be convoluted. Speak only with utmost sincerity, and clearly state the nature of the supplicant.

The fate of all lives is governed by the celestial bureaus; to petition for the restoration of lost fortune or reduced lifespan falls beyond the scope of present supplications, yet the karmic response shall be made manifest.

For all who submit complaints of madness, heresy, or demonic disturbances, the ritual master shall transform into a divine form to receive their words, affix the seal, and dispatch the decree.

In all offerings and rites, beyond the presentation of paper money and horses to the Three Clarities and the Jade Emperor, no untimely acts of irreverence shall be permitted. When burning paper money and horses, first combine them with silk of the five colors as a token of sincerity, then dispatch the *gongcao* and *zhifu* spirits to convey them.

For all rites and petitions directed to the Three Clarities and the Jade Emperor, a single *Cai Fang* Envoy may be positioned beside the throne, but no other deities shall approach the imperial seat.

When entering the oratory to burn incense and conduct affairs, all texts written in the course of ritual practice must first be covered with the Dipper’s lid, shielding them from profane eyes.

For those who come to invoke vengeance upon killers who caused death, employ the *xuan* lid to suppress them.

When treating cattle, horses, or other livestock afflicted by pestilence, inquire into the number of losses, then petition the Year-Ruling Deity to expel the harm.

For all who present offerings of faith, assess their sincerity before accepting, setting the price at three parts: one for sacrificial offerings, one for distribution to the poor, and one for the sustenance of the Dao.

For those who resist the documents of judgment in cases of illness or imprisonment, seize and detain them for adjudication.

For those possessed or tormented by malevolent spirits, causing depletion of the heart and kidneys, administer talismans for ingestion and wearing to suppress the affliction.

For children suffering from night terrors and nocturnal crying, pacify the household stove and eaves deities, the Four Heavenly Kings, and the Flying Swift Spirits, employing the Three Luminaries Talisman to remedy the condition.

All ritual masters who daily deliver the world must use the funds for the sustenance of the Dao without accepting bribes from the people, for Heaven naturally bestows its blessings. When resources are lacking, present a memorial with utmost sincerity, and unseen aid shall arrive without want. If one recklessly accepts worldly goods, the means for practice shall be insufficient.

For households whose stoves, shops, or businesses are afflicted by malevolent hexes or closures, employ the Three Luminaries Talisman to dispatch spirits for resolution.

For all construction or renovation projects, petition the Great Year Deity to placate the local Earth Deities and other spirits under its jurisdiction, preventing harm from arising.

For strange occurrences in ponds, embankments, or dikes—whether from irregular repairs, untimely damage, or persistent harm—summon the local Earth Deity to expel the disturbance. If the affliction persists, employ the Three Luminaries Talisman to suppress it, and those who defy expulsion shall be adjudicated by law.

When epidemics spread and people suffer from illness, follow the prescribed procedures to commission the local Earth Deities and other spirits, then petition the Year-Ruling Deity to withdraw the toxic *qi*. For cases requiring an urgent memorial, the ritual master of this sanctuary shall perform the *Yu Bu* step, transform into a divine form, and silently recite the oral petition to report the plight of the orphaned and destitute.

For men and women who are impoverished and childless, first employ ritual to repel the Three Punishments and Six Harms stars, then bestow talismans for wearing.

For those whose dwellings are inauspicious, where *yin* and *yang* are disharmonious, and where upper and lower clash, leading to years of hardship and misfortune, confer upon them the Orthodox Register.

The *Rites for Receiving the Precepts* in the transmission of the Orthodox Dao states: The Dao is cultivated in oneself yet applied to others, and the power to transform through the Dao arises from the rectitude of the heart. With a rectified and enlightened heart, one may guide others, and none shall remain unaligned. Thus, the myriad dharmas arise from the heart and are transformed by it. By rectifying one’s own heart to align with the celestial heart, none shall fail to receive its rectitude.

To conduct oneself in the Dao is to correct the deviant, and no deviation shall fail to submit. Yet the conduct of the crooked and perverse stems from an unrectified heart, led astray by external things. When external deviations obscure the inner, and clarity is lost within, the true nature is diminished, and delusion runs rampant like a hunt, driving the heart to madness—this is the obscuration of external things.

Like the intoxication of wine that unsettles true nature, the lust for beauty that muddies true sentiment, the pursuit of wealth that forgets benevolence and righteousness, or the biases of love and hatred that distort right and wrong—all arise from emotions that obscure the ultimate principle, constituting the greatest peril. These align with the Three Evil Karma and bind the Three Officials, perpetuating the cycle of the Three Realms without respite.

Not to kill is benevolence. Not to steal is righteousness. Not to engage in licentiousness is propriety. Not to deceive is trustworthiness. Not to be deluded is wisdom. The six roots and seven emotions, along with the transgressions of the ten evils, must be guarded against.

To neglect the support of parents, disrespect teachers and friends, disregard the orphaned and young, fail to repay the nation’s grace, withhold true faith, or disregard hierarchy—these must be strictly avoided.

One must restrain body and mind, revere the celestial Dao, study the methods of the Most High, benefit oneself and others, and transmit the Dao to future generations. Trust and serve teachers and friends, heed their teachings, honor the enlightened, uphold faith and righteousness, avoid rebellion, refrain from corrupt bribes, and never defy Heaven or betray Earth. Even a single transgression brings unforgivable sin; the Dao’s power wanes, and the individual suffers calamity, while the nine clans share in the guilt.

One must take refuge in the Supreme Dao and its boundless methods. Only after the immeasurable multitude has sworn this great oath may the esoteric formulas of the Shangqing be transmitted, to assist Heaven in its transformations, aid the nation and deliver the people, heal the sick and rescue the imperiled, expel the deviant and uphold the upright.

Before the assembly of the Great Dao and the exalted perfected, with heartfelt devotion and spoken words, from this day forward, uphold this covenant without fail. Bowing deeply, one is moved to the utmost gratitude.

The above rites are performed upon ascending the altar, with all officers joining in the chant.

For all matters addressed, assess their gravity and conduct the rituals without recklessly mobilizing the divine generals, officers, or soldiers. When receiving and dispatching written complaints, do not falsely implicate spirits or deities in wrongdoing.

For the transmission of the Orthodox Dao, on the designated day within the ritual period, conduct an offering rite known as the *Transmission Offering*. Present 120 portions of paper money and horses, with the deities of the memorial and offering rites listed in order of veneration. If half the amount is offered, it shall be accepted.

After reporting to Heaven and Earth and receiving the official appointment, and once the guarantor’s statement is complete, proceed to bestow the talismanic formulas, official decrees, and authentic registers in accordance with the ritual.

To report to the Eastern Peak for transfer and reassignment, inscribe the name in the celestial registers, thereby petitioning for the pardon of the nine familial clans to depart the nether realms and ascend to the realm of the living. The sequence of ritual proceedings upon the altar shall follow the original method.

All officials of the Demon-Quelling Court shall be addressed as *Grand Commanders*, governing the demonic forces across the Three Realms. Initially, one is appointed as *Right Vice-Judge*; next, *Right Grand Judge*; then *Left Vice-Judge*; and finally *Left Grand Judge*—all of whom shall concurrently oversee the affairs of the Court. Those whose merit and achievements are eminent shall ascend to the ranks of immortals and be appointed as *Grand Daoist Masters and Co-Judges of the Court*. Further, those who, within a year, have rescued twenty or more people during calamitous years of drought, flood, or famine, and whose prayers yield immediate results, shall be promoted to *Grand Master of the Nine Heavens’ Golden Gates*.

Next, in ascending order: *Minister of the Water Department*, *Minister of the Wood Department*, *Minister of the Earth Department*, *Minister of the Metal Department*, and *Minister of the Fire Department*—these ranks apply to those who have saved more than twenty lives in a year. Those whose merit in averting great disasters is exceptionally profound shall be progressively promoted to *Purple Tenuity Palace Envoy* and *Day-Watch Primordial Lord*, the latter granted to those who, by year’s end, have aided the state in disaster relief, pacified the land, and dispatched ghostly soldiers to secretly assist the imperial reign in achieving peace. Those who, within a year, can expel or eradicate locust plagues and monstrous calamities from the designated celestial sectors shall be appointed as *Censor of the Nine Heavens’ Golden Gates*.

Further, those who, within a year, may vow to establish altars in renowned mountains, submit memorials, and offer prayers for the sovereign’s longevity—with verifiable efficacy—shall be elevated to *Golden Gates Supreme Immortal and Attendant-in-Ordinary*. Those who, within a year, attain self-realization beyond the mundane, guide the deluded from the Five Sufferings, and personally journey to the Southern Bureau to inscribe their names—thereby ensuring the sage rule of the sovereign, the virtue of ministers, the ascent of the nine clans to heaven, and the benefaction of all beings—shall be promoted to *Purple Palace Grand Chancellor*. The subsequent ranks are: *Mystic Capital Grand Chancellor*, *Supreme Mystic Grand Chancellor*, *Supreme Ultimate Grand Chancellor*, and *Golden Gates Grand Chancellor*.

Those who, within a year, fully realize the boundless Dao, transcend reliance on written scripture, and through direct instruction achieve verifiable results—such as quelling the harm caused by dragons in rivers, lakes, seas, or landslides, and whose deeds truly benefit the state and deliver the people while excising great calamities—shall be elevated to *Supreme Ultimate Grand Chancellor*. From *Day-Watch Primordial Lord* to *Supreme Ultimate Grand Chancellor*, these nine ranks of promotion entail the conferral of the *Nine Grades of Supreme Clarity Registers*, after which one may enter this system of regulations. All other ranks shall follow the protocols of the immortal officials.

The Three Primordials serve as the foundation, with the *Cavern Spirit* rank and below proceeding in sequence, beginning with the *First Lesser Primordial* as *First-Rank Immortal Official* and *Supervisor of the Northern Culmen Demon-Quelling Court*. The *Middle Primordial* as *First-Rank Immortal Official* and *Judge of the Northern Culmen Demon-Quelling Court*. The *Upper Primordial* as *First-Rank Immortal Official* and *Judge of the Fengdu Court*. Those whose merit, conduct, and karmic deeds are exemplary shall ascend in sequence, their persons entering the Golden Gates to attend the Three Clarities.

When issuing talismans of the Three Clarities, the Jade Emperor, or the Three Luminaries of the Northern Dipper, the officiating official shall transform into a deity and submit a memorial detailing the purpose of the petition, declaring: *"Your servant, in accordance with the prescribed rites, now dispatches this decree. May it be as I have stated."* Upon concluding the prayer, the talisman-bearing messenger shall be immediately dispatched, and upon its arrival, the decree shall be executed.

All officiating officials, when entering or exiting, shall constantly visualize the presence of the Six Ding, Four Straight Earth Deities, and Seal-Monitoring Valiant Spirits, commanding them through ritual to follow without fail. When officiating officials ascend to the Celestial Court to expel pestilential demons or sever malevolent influences, they must first don the Northern Dipper of the Three Terraces and transform into the *Envoy of the Demon-Quelling Court*.

After presenting the memorial and petition to the Celestial Emperor, proceed to the Celestial Pivot Court to command the Four Heavenly Kings, Twelve Great Deities, Eight Vajras, Six Ding and Six Jia, Marshals Tianpeng and Tianyu, Firebell Generals, and the Five Thunder Wind-Rain Deities, and exit through the Celestial Gate.

When establishing a celestial prison, a memorial must be submitted to inform Mount Tai, detailing the proceedings and stating: *"On such-and-such a day of such-and-such a month, a celestial prison was established in such-and-such a direction."* Memorialize the Celestial Emperor regarding the *Five Dipper Prison*, adhering to the twelve prescribed protocols.

The seal of the Demon-Quelling Court shall measure one *cun* and eight *fen* in width, crafted from gold or jade, and inscribed with celestial script. Seals made from thunder-struck wood are also permissible. Summon the Six Ding and Six Jia messengers to establish a boundary for its protection. Once placed, apply red cinnabar to the seal’s surface, first memorializing the upper realms. Only this seal may be used for all talismanic inscriptions in the ritual method. Next, match the seal with the official’s signature and floral cipher, report to the Eastern Peak for verification, and only then may it be employed.

Your servant, the *Perfected of Universal Reception from the Grotto-Heavens*, having received the celestial script of the *Demon-Quelling Court and Grand Daoist Master’s Stellar Seal* from instruction, transcribed two copies and buried them in the original site. The seal’s dimensions were then compared: the large *chi* measures one *cun* and eight *fen*, equivalent to two *cun* and one *fen* of the small *chi*, or two *cun* and four *fen* of the millet *chi*—all identical. These measurements, as ordained by celestial law, confound even spirits and deities within the minutest fraction, and are thus established here as the fixed standard for ritual regulation.

When inscribing celestial script talismans and registers, use water from the *Celestial Virtue* and *Monthly Virtue*, brushes of the Six Ding and Six Jia, ink of the Black Emperor, cinnabar of the *Luminous Solar Essence*, and inkstones of the *Five Dragons’ Treasure*—all prepared in accordance with the transmission method. Only after memorializing the upper realms may they be employed.

When subduing fierce and ferocious spirits, it is essential to dispatch divine generals, while simultaneously forming mudras with the left and right hands and invoking the Dipper’s canopy over oneself. Proclaim the decree: *"Your transgressions have been absolved. My intent is to save the people."*

When conducting offering rites to beseech the stars for disaster aversion, first memorialize the *True Lords of the Constellations* with the prescribed documents. Then, seated, declare: *"Your disciple beseeches for disaster aversion, the accumulation of blessings, the prolongation of life, the substitution of calamities, and the augmentation of fortune and emolument. Humbly prepared, may the enlightened perceive my sincerity."*

When reciting the *Northern Dipper Mantra* during the *Perfected’s Dipper Steps*, halt at the *Celestial Pivot*, flick the seal mudra, and then point with the *Celestial Pivot Seal*. If reciting the mantra within a talisman, begin with the star *Greedy Wolf*.

When making offerings to the deities, record the dates using the *Six Jia* days of the four seasons: spring, summer, autumn, and winter.

In spring, the six *Jia* days; in summer, the six *Bing* days; in autumn, the six *Geng* days; in winter, the six *Gui* days. On these days, outside the door, offer three portions of vegetarian fruits, incense, jujubes, and soup to the *Direct Attendants of the Three Realms* and the *Four Duty Merit Officers*. First, erect an earthen altar, then place earthen coins. Thereafter, declare the intent:

*"By the decree of the Jade Emperor, I assist in the transformation of the Dao and aid the state in delivering the people. In all talismanic rites, I sever and eradicate malevolent spirits that bring calamity, cure illnesses, succor the perilous, bestow blessings, and invoke auspiciousness—all relying on you, the messengers, to convey these matters to the divine assemblies above and below. Today, I present wine, fruits, coins, and horses in offering. Humbly, I beseech the messengers to extend their compassion, radiate their majestic light, and bestow their numinous protection."*

Next, pour wine thrice, burn the coins, recite the incantation, and swear to the *Merit Officers*:

*"I have heard that those who cultivate the Great Dao in former lives now become supreme spirits, none but those whose merit and conduct take precedence, whose devotion to saving the people is paramount. Thus, they manifest in the unseen, traverse the nether realms, emerge from water, and enter fire. Their transformations are myriad, their might pervades all forms. Armed with halberds and clad in armor, bearing drums and lifting bells, they move freely without hindrance. At their presence, evil demons shatter in fear, and the afflicted find peace. I wield the Orthodox Dharma to subdue demons, relying on your awe-inspiring might to assist me—subjugating malevolent spirits, severing the roots of calamity, bestowing fortune upon the virtuous, and ascribing merit to the Way of goodness. Today, with these offerings, I modestly repay your divine merits, slightly express gratitude for your toils, and deeply honor your strenuous efforts. Humbly, I invite each of you to feast and drink to satiety."*

**Oath to the Divine Generals:**
*"May you all feast and drink to satiety, then compose your majestic demeanor. Strictly observe the celestial precepts, reverently heed the Emperor’s command. Wield the authority of martial prowess to achieve the merit of pacification. May your illustrious achievements be fulfilled, and your resounding responses be clear. By the decree of the Five Marchmounts, you, the divine generals, officers, and soldiers, are dispatched. All possess concealed martial prowess and long-nurtured strategies. Your reputation is pure and stern, your virtue and bearing heroic and majestic. Responding to the command of the Marchmounts, you are entrusted with the authority of punitive expeditions. At your tremors, malevolent specters shatter in form; at your glares, wind and clouds change color. Where your numinous halberds point, great evil cannot prevail. Assisting the state, delivering the people, benefiting the times, and aiding all beings—devote your hearts to the Dao, and none should covet merit. Those in this court have long received immortal decrees. Though this humble Daoist has presumptuously assumed the authority of a celestial officer, I rely solely on your numinous protection. Above, may it guard my body and preserve my life, as I study the Dao and serve Heaven, aiding my true self in aspiring to celestial rank. In the middle, may it manifest the sagely transformation, illuminate and spread hidden merits, and through this mighty power, fulfill my aspirations. Below, may it deliver people and benefit beings, cure illnesses and expel evil, punish malevolent demons, and bring abundant fortune and prosperity. May these layered merits be achieved, and their efficacious responses resound. May your hidden virtues be renowned, and may you share in these merits. May all honors be bestowed according to the conveniences of the age, and may we together uphold the Orthodox Dharma’s supremacy. Benefit without harm, awe with discipline. In all matters, deficiency harms the mean; losing harmony injures beings. Defying Heaven invites punitive expeditions—execute and eradicate evil. Assist the upright with divine merit to overcome malevolent power, and with wondrous transformation to overcome treacherous schemes. Who can withstand this? None can oppose. Only you, the divine, assist my Great Dao. Hasten, hasten, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!"*

To all divine generals, officers, and soldiers, entrust the Dharma seals and charge them to constantly guard and uphold the rites.

**Orthodox Dharma Placard Format**
**Northern Culmen Exorcism Court:**
The generals, officers, and soldiers currently under the jurisdiction of this court are dispatched by the Jade Emperor’s life-saving decree to this court to protect the Dharma, transform the world, assist the state, deliver the people, and guide all beings to the Orthodox Dao. It is feared that they may be unaware: this court possesses a celestial seal, either one *cun* and eight *fen* square, two *cun* and one *fen* square, three *cun* square, or five *cun* square. It commands trillions of celestial soldiers. Each stroke and line of the seal’s script conceals thirty-six trillion soldiers and generals, who turn with my seal. At its presence, evil demons shatter in fear, and the afflicted find peace. Bestowed by the Supreme Emperor, celestial warriors bear it aloft, following my commands. The soldiers and generals within the seal number trillions, coming and going like the wind, formless and boundless, their transformations inexhaustible. Concealed within my seal, they appear when summoned. Sometimes they manifest as colossal forms, filling the void, their heads bearing Kunlun, their shoulders the sun and moon, their hands grasping the Emperor’s bell, their feet treading *kui* dragons. Sometimes they appear as minute forms, entering a speck of dust or a strand of hair. Behold their mighty power, upholding the Orthodox Dharma, transforming endlessly to deliver sentient beings, never boasting of their merit. Their wondrous might and Daoist arts are boundless. It is feared that the generals, officers, and soldiers under this court’s command may be unaware of these statutes and willfully disobey or neglect them. If they are sent to receive punishment, this court shall not be lenient. Now, the celestial soldiers and generals, as well as the Marchmount soldiers and generals, are divided into rotating shifts, prepared for urgent matters. When summoned by this court, they must hasten immediately. If not on duty or called, they are to conceal and submit themselves within the Six Directions. The following are specified:

- Celestial soldiers, generals, and officers must always be prepared for summons. If not called, they may not leave the celestial realms without authorization.
  - Southern Dipper celestial soldiers: 3,600.
  - Black-Killing divine soldiers: 50,000.
  - Northern Dipper division soldiers and generals.
  - Three-Five division soldiers and generals.
  - Orthodox division soldiers and generals.
  - Radiant Light division soldiers and generals.
  - Celestial *Ding* deities.
  - Celestial warriors.
  - Vajra deities.
  - Great Brightness deities.
  - Flying Dragon mounted officers: 1,000.
  - Dragon-Slaying mounted officers: 1,000.
  - Dragon-Centralizing mounted officers: 1,000.
  - Dharma-Assisting Generals: 2.
- Generals dispatched from Mount Tai are to be divided into two shifts, alternating daily, accompanying the Dharma-officiating officials of this court in their comings and goings. In cases of urgent matters, this does not apply.

The aforementioned troops and officers are to be stationed solely within this court, without any negligence or disrespect. They shall remain under the command of the Dharma-Assisting Generals.

- One General to constantly oversee and command the troops.
- One Dharma-Assisting General.
- Cavalry and infantry soldiers: a designated number.
- Personnel dispatched from the Eastern Peak Pass.

The above-mentioned troops, officers, and divine functionaries are hereby ordered to be publicly announced. All are to carefully heed the preceding directives and comply accordingly. Any violation, however slight, shall not be lightly forgiven. Those among you who render meritorious service shall be duly rewarded and commended. A memorial shall be submitted to the celestial realms, whereupon they shall be bestowed with divine blessings. Let this be proclaimed without falsehood; all should take heed.

Proclamation issued on the ___ day of the ___ month of the ___ year.

[Official title, name, and seal]

**Petition for Transmission of the Dharma from Disciple to Master**

Disciple [Name], residing in [State, County, Township, Village, Hamlet], born on the ___ day of the ___ month of the ___ year at the ___ hour, under the governance of the [specific] Star Lord of the Northern Dipper.

Respectfully offering:
- Nine taels of yellow gold, a pair of gold rings, and one bolt of plain silk as tokens of sincerity.
- Four taels of black silk thread, representing ten thousand strands of hair.
- Seven taels of cinnabar, substituting for the blood of oath.

With reverence, [Disciple] presents these before the Dharma Master [Name], seeking to receive the transmission.

The Heavenly Heart Orthodox Dharma,
Intended to aid the Dao in its transformative work,
To serve the state and deliver the people.

This disciple, observing the fate of the fleeting world,
Has long grieved for this fragile, imperiled body.
Ashamed of my inability to eradicate harm,
And my lack of means to promote benefit.
Neglectful in cultivation, my dread runs deep.

Who could have foreseen that, after countless kalpas,
This day’s encounter would be my fortune?
I have learned that [Dharma Master’s Name]
Does not obstruct the path to the Mystic Capital,
But uniquely propagates the wind of the Most High,
Embracing the resolve to uphold the One Dharma.
Enhancing the radiance of the Daoist teachings,
Extending a hand to deliver all beings.
Breaking through the dust-laden cage,
I, with my withered and decayed roots, aspire to grasp it.

Relying above on the power of your nurturing,
In my own conduct, how dare I transgress?
If I were to forget the grace of your instruction,
I would willingly endure the suffering of eternal submersion.
Having turned toward deliverance,
I will exhaust my devotion in practice.
Meeting this mysterious destiny,
I will dedicate my heart to repayment.

Humbly I beseech [Dharma Master’s Name]
To open wide your compassionate creation,
And deign to regard these humble, dust-tainted words.
I implore your merciful consideration.
My heart below is utterly without pretense,
Longing for your grace to the utmost.

Respectfully submitted.
On the ___ day of the ___ month of the ___ year.

Petition for a Master’s Endorsement

The disciple, [Surname] of [Village], [Township], [County], [Prefecture], respectfully states:

On the ___ day of the ___ month of the ___ year, I personally presented a petition at the abode of the Highest Clarity Dharma Master [Name], seeking to receive the Orthodox Method of the Celestial Heart in its entirety. My aspiration is to assist in the transformative work of Heaven, aid the state and succor the people, heal the sick and sustain the imperiled, and sever all perverse and malevolent influences. Having received your gracious consent, I was permitted to submit my name in the monthly memorial. In accordance with your command, I have followed the method and sought a master of renowned virtue to endorse and transmit the teaching.

I reflect that, by birth, I am fortunate to dwell within the Central Kingdom. My heart has long abided beyond form, and in my search for a teacher, I repeatedly inquired among those of understanding, until at last I poured forth my sincerity and encountered one of luminous discernment. Recently, I have come to revere [Name], who has attained the utmost refinement in the Dharma, who exalts and propagates the Great Dao, whose dedication to saving the people is most earnest, and whose deliverance is profoundly far-reaching.

I now humbly present myself to [Name], beseeching your endorsement. Should I be so fortunate as to be accepted, I would surely steel my heart and fortify my resolve, inscribing your grace upon my bones and engraving it into my very frame, devoting myself wholeheartedly to cultivation. In so doing, I would repay above the gift of your guidance—what greater fortune could there be?

This petition is respectfully submitted for your consideration, and I prostrate myself in await of your Dharma decree.

On the [day] of the [month] in the [year], residing at [place], [Name] respectfully submits this petition.

**Form of the Newly Conferred Orthodox Dharma Plate-Tally and Iron Pledge**

The plate-tally and iron pledge shall be nine inches in height, with five inches corresponding to the five bodies of the manifested self and four inches representing the four numinous spirits of the body. It shall measure four feet and nine inches in length, aligning with the four directions and the nine stars of the Dharma.

Traditionally, yellow flowered silk was used, but those who practice the Dharma today often employ cypress wood for the tally and iron for the pledge. This is not so, for such mundane materials do not accord with the intent of the immortals. The plate-tally signifies the register of records and the contract of the tally, while the iron pledge represents an oath of unshakable alliance, steadfast and unchanging.

This was transmitted by the great immortal Master Rao, and its meaning is recorded below:

**By Imperial Decree of the Three Terraces, to the Office Below:**

To the Right Judge of the Bureau for Driving Away Demons, [Name], who practices and upholds the Orthodox Dharma of the Celestial Heart, in accordance with the decree bestowed by the Jade Emperor:

You shall reverently follow the teachings in your practice, dispelling evil and aiding the upright, benefiting and delivering the multitude of beings, and propagating the Great Dao. Your actions must align with the Celestial Heart; beware of deceit, corruption, or negligence. Honor and serve your parents with filial piety, respect your teachers and elders, and maintain harmony among the six relations. Do not follow after power or profit, nor transmit this Dharma to unworthy persons. Should you fail to comply, your efficacy in affairs shall wane. The Three Officials shall record your merits and transgressions, and you shall be rewarded or punished according to the Dharma.

*Oṃ hūṃ hūṃ!* All spirits bow their heads; demons and evil forces submit to rectitude. Should any dare to act with malice or rebellion, they shall be shattered into dust.

By decree of the Supreme Emperor of the Grand Tenuity: *Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!*

To the Four Heavenly Gate Kings, the Eight Great Vajras, the Five Divisional Wheel Kings, the Dharma-protecting deities of the ten directions, the stellar host of immortals within the registers of the four heavens and three realms, the Six Ding and Six Jia, the Great Sage Xuanwu, the Celestial Ding Warriors, the Lords of Wind and Rain, the Envoys of the Five Thunders, the Sage Emperors of the Five Peaks, the Four Drainage Kings, the deities of grotto-heavens, renowned mountains, official temples, and the Five Paths, the celestial soldiers and officers, the mountain soldiers and officers—let each act in accordance with the Emperor’s decree. The plate-tally and iron pledge shall ever protect and assist, exterminating evil demons, dispelling illness, and eradicating malevolent spirits. Any fierce or rebellious evil spirits who dare to defy shall be shattered into dust.

Upon the arrival of this saving tally: *Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!*

Whereas you possess the endowment of loyalty and sincerity, the nature of purity and harmony, a profound aspiration for the true, and a resolute heart for delivering beings, you must uphold this pledge to cultivate the self and harmonize with the praises of the true words. Let this be known to you.

Respectfully recorded on the [day] of the [month] in the [year].

To the Esteemed Bearer of the Dharma Transmission and Preceptor’s Rank, the Minister of [Surname], acting in accordance with the rites:

The Great Dharma Master of the Three Heavens, Upholder of the Dao, Perfected One of the Orthodox Unity, Serene and Responsive True Lord, Minister Zhang Daoling,

**Decree of Appointment for the Newly Conferred Orthodox Practitioner and Official of the Demon-Quelling Court**

Issued by the Chancellery of the Three Terraces:

Whereas the Demon-Quelling Court official of [Surname] has submitted a memorial endorsing [Name of Candidate]:

Possessing a nature of purity and simplicity, they uphold goodness and preserve sincerity. Ever revering the Lofty Perfected, they constantly take refuge in the Great Dao. They harbor the aspiration to aid the state and deliver the people, desiring to receive transmission of the Orthodox Dharma of the Celestial Heart, talismans, and registers—to guard the body and protect life, assist in the Dao’s unfolding, and benefit all beings.

[Name of Candidate], aged [number] years, born on the [day] of the [month] in the [year] of the sexagenary cycle, under the governance of the [specific] Star Lord of the Northern Dipper, awaits the humble repayment of their devotion.

The Orthodox Dharma of the Three Heavens converges all myriad ways. How much more so when our words are easily practiced—how could your heart falter in emulation?

They are hereby appointed as Right Judiciary Official of the Northern Culmen Demon-Quelling Court, concurrently overseeing the affairs of the Court. Let this be recorded in accordance with the prescribed form.

Respectfully issued this decree.

By Edict of the Supreme Clarity Jade Emperor, upon receipt of this talisman, let it be reverently executed.

Dated the [day] of the [month] in the [year] of the sexagenary cycle.

Presented by the Dharma Master of Transmission and Ordination, the Gold-Titled Minister [Name], proclaiming the decree.

The Great Dharma Master of the Three Heavens, Upholder of the Teachings, Orthodox Unity Perfected Person, Tranquil Response Perfected Lord, Minister Zhang Daoling.

**Memorial of Gratitude for Receiving the Dharma and Reporting Responses—Prescribed Form**

The humble official [Name], with utmost reverence and trepidation, prostrates and bows twice.

I humbly declare: I have heard that the Great Dao is formless, nurturing and embracing the myriad transformations. The supreme virtue is not fixed, yet it revolves and governs the Three Origins. All things attain manifestation, with the most numinous residing at the forefront. The unparalleled Dharma does not depart from its root; the essence of guarding the One emerges from sincerity. Looking upon myself as one of mere mortal capacity, I am entrusted with the protection and participation among the ranks of immortals. With utmost reverence and trepidation, I prostrate and bow twice.

Reverently addressing the Jade Purity Sacred Realm’s Primordial Heavenly Venerable, the Supreme Clarity Perfected Realm’s Numinous Treasure Heavenly Venerable, and the Grand Clarity Immortal Realm’s Dao and Virtue Heavenly Venerable—who opened the heavens and governed the epochs, wielding talismans as the Nine Hundred Ninety-Nine Myriad Million Dao Lords; who cleaved the earth in the Crimson Brilliance and Dragon Han eras, assuming the Ten Titles and Ten Perfections. The hundred spirits take their source from the sacred scriptures and treasures.

The Three Heavens’ Orthodox Dharma, the Five Emperors’ True Talismans—spreading transformation, descending auspiciousness, casting radiance to respond to all beings. Though I dwell in humble mortality, I have presumptuously received the utmost Dao/Way. Having escaped the dusty world, I rejoice in my enrollment among the immortal registers. How dare I not uphold the Heavenly Precepts above and fulfill human sentiments below? With relieving suffering as my heart and repaying kindness as my urgency, I humbly present this memorial in gratitude, venturing to disturb the Heavenly Might. My inferior feelings are without limit; I gaze upon the sagely presence with fervent longing, overwhelmed with awe.

I, your subject [Name], with utmost reverence and trepidation, prostrate and bow twice.

Respectfully submitted.

Memorial presented by your subject [Surname and Name], of such-and-such rank, on the [Day] day of the [Month] month of the [Year] year.
