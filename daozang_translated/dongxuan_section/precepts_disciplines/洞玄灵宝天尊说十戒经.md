**The Supreme Venerable Sovereign of the Numinous Treasure’s Scripture of the Ten Precepts**

The Heavenly Worthy spoke:
Good men and good women who awaken to the spontaneous intention of the Dao/Way and enter the Dharma-gate, receiving my Ten Precepts and Fourteen Rules of Conduct, shall be deemed pure and faithful disciples of the Great Dao. All who, with valor and might, ascend to the heavens in equal merit, advancing in this endeavor without slackening or retreat, shall transcend the Three Realms and become Perfected Ones of the Highest Clarity.

**First:** Refrain from killing; contemplate the lives of all beings.
**Second:** Do not harbor deluded or perverse thoughts.
**Third:** Do not take wealth that is not rightfully yours.
**Fourth:** Do not deceive; reverse false judgments of good and evil.
**Fifth:** Do not become intoxicated; constantly reflect on pure conduct.
**Sixth:** Maintain harmony among clan and kin, without partiality.
**Seventh:** Upon witnessing another’s good deeds, rejoice and lend support in spirit.
**Eighth:** Upon seeing another in distress, aid them in performing meritorious acts.
**Ninth:** If others act against you, resolve not to retaliate.
**Tenth:** Regarding all that you have not yet attained, do not covet.

**Next, the Fourteen Rules of Conduct:**
When speaking to a ruler, bring benefit to the state.
When speaking to a father, show kindness to the child.
When speaking to a teacher, cherish the multitude.
When speaking to a minister, demonstrate loyalty to the sovereign.
When speaking to an elder brother, foster friendship with the younger.
When speaking to a child, practice filial piety toward parents.
When speaking to a friend, uphold trust in your bond.
When speaking to a husband, maintain harmony in the household.
When speaking to a wife, preserve fidelity to her spouse.
When speaking to a younger sibling, observe reverence in ritual.
When speaking to a peasant, encourage diligence in farming.
When speaking to the virtuous, cultivate aspiration for the Dao/Way.
When speaking to foreigners, let each uphold their own domain.
When speaking to servants, exercise caution in their service.

The Heavenly Worthy declared:
Those who cultivate and uphold these pure precepts align with the heart of Heaven. Ever practicing great compassion, they vow to act for the sake of all, universally delivering the world from suffering. Humbly revering the teachings, they must not falter midway. Better to die upholding goodness than to live in evil. Through unwavering devotion, they may escape the Five Paths, avoid the Three Evil Realms, be received by the hosts of heaven, and revered by the myriad spirits. By maintaining a perpetual fast and observing the precepts, they shall naturally attain deliverance from the world.

And so it is proclaimed in verse:
All who cultivate and study,
Vow to realize the true Dao/Way.
With compassion, contemplate the precepts,
The Dao’s voice severs affliction.

The Heavenly Worthy spoke:
Good men and good women who awaken to the spontaneous intention of the Dao/Way and enter the Dharma-gate, receiving my Ten Precepts and Fourteen Rules of Conduct, shall be deemed pure and faithful disciples of the Great Dao. All who, with valor and might, ascend to the heavens in equal merit, advancing in this endeavor without slackening, shall transcend the Three Realms and become Perfected Ones of the Highest Clarity.

Then the disciples prostrated themselves before the master.

**Eighth:** Upon seeing others in distress, assist them in performing meritorious acts;
**Ninth:** When others harm you, resolve not to seek repayment;
**Tenth:** Toward all who have yet to attain the Dao/Way, harbor no expectations.

To servants and slaves, speak words that bring careful attention to their duties.

The Heavenly Worthy spoke:
Those who cultivate and uphold these pure precepts ever align with the will of Heaven. Constantly practicing great compassion, they vow to act for the sake of all beings, universally delivering them from this troubled world. Reverently honoring the sacred teachings, they must not grow remiss. Better to die upholding goodness than to live by doing evil. Through unwavering devotion, they may be liberated from the Five Paths and avoid the Three Evil Realms. Guarded by all the heavens and revered by the myriad spirits, those who steadfastly observe these precepts shall naturally attain deliverance across the world.

**The Scripture of the Ten Precepts**
This Dharma is truly profound and wondrous,
Freeing your nine generations from bondage.
Should one refuse to receive it,
They sever themselves from the Dao/Way.
Those unworthy who presume to accept it
Will face reproach in this very life.
Upon death, they fall into the Three Wretched Realms—
Take heed, and do not obstruct your own benefit.

In the tenth year of Tianbao of the Great Tang, the year *xinmao*, on the twenty-sixth day of the first lunar month, *gengxu*, Zhang Xuanshi, a male lay disciple of pure faith from Kaiyuan Abbey in Fengyi Village, Yuguan Township, Dunhuang County, Dunhuang Commandery, aged twenty-seven, being but a flesh-bound mortal of no discernment, having received and embodied form, finds his form tainted by the Six Passions. Once the Six Passions take hold, their movement breeds defilement and filth. At times, in what he sees, he is deluded by what he clings to; worldly affairs and karmic conditions arise in succession, drawing forth transgressions and stains, accumulated over lifetimes without end. Thus he revolves within the Three Realms, adrift and forgetful of return; he flows through the Five Paths, bound in long ignorance without awakening.

Having heard that the Most High and Great Sage expounded the *Ten Precepts* and the *Fourteen Rules for Upholding the Body*, and that by cultivating practice in accordance with this Dharma, one may ascend beyond the Three Realms and attain the highest rank of Supreme Purity, Xuanshi, though dull of nature, earnestly seeks to receive and uphold them. He respectfully approaches Master Ma, a Master of the Three Caverns from Mount Song, to receive the *Ten Precepts* and the *Fourteen Rules for Upholding the Body*, vowing to cultivate, practice, and honor them as the treasure of his being. Should he betray this covenant, he shall not dare to seek pardon from the hells of eternal night.

*(Preceding text missing)*
...may naturally attain deliverance across the world.

*(Ten Precepts Covenant Text, P.2347)*

In the third year of Jinglong of the Great Tang, the year *jiyou*, on the eighteenth day of the fifth lunar month, *jiayin*, Tang Zhen, a female lay disciple of pure faith from Chongxu Abbey in Changsha Village, Hongguan Township, Dunhuang County, Shazhou, aged sixteen in her precept years, being but a flesh-bound mortal of no discernment, having received and embodied form, finds her form tainted by the Six Passions. Once the Six Passions take hold, their movement breeds defilement and filth. At times, in what she sees, she is deluded by what she clings to; worldly affairs and karmic conditions arise in succession, drawing forth transgressions and stains, accumulated over lifetimes without end.

Across the Three Realms she drifts and strays, adrift and forgetful of return;
through the Five Paths she flows and turns, long sunk in delusion, unenlightened.
Having heard that the Heavenly Worthy, the Great Sage, expounded the Ten Precepts and the Fourteen Articles for Conducting the Body, she knows that those who cultivate in accordance with the Dao may ascend beyond the Three Realms and attain the highest rank of Supreme Purity.
Though her nature in the precepts remains dull and ignorant, she earnestly seeks to receive and uphold them. Reverently offering the ritual pledge, she humbly approaches Master North Peak at the Pass to receive the Ten Precepts and the Fourteen Articles for Conducting the Body, vowing to cultivate and revere them as the eternal treasure of her person. Should she violate this covenant, she shall forever languish in the hells, and dares not presume forgiveness.

**The Scripture of the Ten Precepts**
*(Ten Precepts Covenant Text, P.2350)*

In the year *jiayin* of the Great Tang, the first lunar month, *gengshen* marking the new moon, on the twenty-second day, *xinsi*, Li Wushang, a male lay disciple of pure faith from Chang’an Village, Longle Township, Dunhuang County, Shazhou, aged twenty-seven in his precept years, presents the ritual pledge in accordance with the Dao.
Today, he approaches Master Zhang, a Master of the Three Caverns and Middle Peak, residing in Wuqiong Village, Xiaogu Township, Dunhuang County, Shazhou, to receive the Ten Precepts and the Fourteen Articles for Conducting the Body.
Wushang, a flesh-bound mortal, having received and embodied form, finds his form tainted by the Six Passions. Once the Six Passions take hold, their movement breeds defilement and filth. At times, in what he sees, he is deluded by what he clings to; worldly affairs and karmic conditions arise in succession, drawing forth transgressions and stains, accumulated over lifetimes without end.
Across the Three Realms he drifts and strays, adrift and forgetful of return; through the Five Paths he flows and turns, long sunk in delusion, unenlightened.
Thus, in accordance with the statutes, he presents the ritual pledge and earnestly seeks to receive, cultivate, and revere the precepts as the eternal treasure of his person. Should he violate this covenant, he shall forever languish in the hells, and dares not presume forgiveness.
*(Text incomplete at beginning.)* May he attain liberation across the world.

**The Scripture of the Ten Precepts**
*(Ten Precepts Covenant Text, P.3770)*

In the second year of Zhide, the year *dingyou*, the fifth lunar month, *wushen* marking the new moon, on the fourteenth day, *xinyou*, Wang Yuzhen, a male lay disciple of good faith from Hongwen Village, Pingkang Township, Dunhuang County, Dunhuang Prefecture, aged sixteen, presents the ritual pledge in accordance with the Dao.
Today, he approaches Master Suo, a Master of the Three Caverns and Middle Peak, residing in Anchang Village, Pingkang Township, Dunhuang County, Dunhuang Prefecture, to receive the Ten Precepts and the Fourteen Articles for Conducting the Body.
Yuzhen, a flesh-bound mortal, having received and embodied form, finds his form tainted by the Six Passions.

Once the Six Passions taint the form, every movement breeds defilement. Whether through what is seen or what clings unseen, worldly affairs and karmic conditions arise in succession, summoning the filth of transgression, which accumulates across lifetimes without end. Thus one drifts through the Three Realms, adrift and forgetful of return; cycles through the Five Paths, sunk in long delusion. Therefore, in accordance with the Mysterious Regulations, she presents the ritual pledge in proper form, seeking to receive, uphold, and venerate the precepts, treasuring them forever as the body’s sacred jewel. Should she violate this covenant, she shall be bound in the eternal darkness of hell, and dares not plead for absolution.

**The Scripture of the Ten Precepts**
*(Ten Precepts Covenant Text, Zhensongtang Collection)*

In the *jiayin* year of the Great Era, the first lunar month, *gengshen* marking the new moon, on the twenty-second day, *xinsi*, Yin Zhiqing, a female lay disciple of pure faith from the Divine Farmer Hamlet, Hongchi Township, Dunhuang County, Shazhou, aged eleven, presents the ritual pledge in accordance with the Dao. Today, she approaches Master Zhang, a Master of the Three Caverns and Middle Peak, residing in Wuqiong Hamlet, Xiaogu Township, Dunhuang County, Shazhou, to receive the Ten Precepts and the Fourteen Articles for Conducting the Body. Zhiqing, a flesh-bound mortal, having received and embodied form, finds her form tainted by the Six Passions. Once the Six Passions taint the form, every movement breeds defilement. Whether through what is seen or what clings unseen, worldly affairs and karmic conditions arise in succession, summoning the filth of transgression, which accumulates across lifetimes without end. Thus one drifts through the Three Realms, adrift and forgetful of return; cycles through the Five Paths, sunk in long delusion. Therefore, in accordance with the Mysterious Regulations, she presents the ritual pledge in proper form, seeking to receive, uphold, and venerate the precepts, treasuring them forever as the body’s sacred jewel. Should she violate this covenant, she shall be bound in the eternal darkness of hell, and dares not plead for absolution.

*(Ten Precepts Covenant Text, P.3417)*

In the second year of Jingyun of the Great Tang, the *xinhai* year, the eighth lunar month, *gengwu* marking the new moon of the third intercalary month, on the twenty-fourth day, *jisi*, Jing Xian, a lay disciple of pure faith from Chuntai Hamlet, Longquan Township, Litang County, Yongzhou, aged twenty-seven, presents the ritual pledge. Xian, a flesh-bound mortal of dull awareness, having received and embodied form, finds his form tainted by the Six Passions. Once the Six Passions taint the form, every movement breeds defilement. Whether through what is seen or what clings unseen, worldly affairs and karmic conditions arise in succession, summoning the filth of transgression, which accumulates across lifetimes without end. Thus one drifts through the Three Realms, adrift and forgetful of return; cycles through the Five Paths, sunk in long delusion. Having heard that the Heavenly Worthy, the Great Sage, expounded the Ten Precepts and the Fourteen Articles for Conducting the Body, and that those who cultivate them in accordance with the Dao may ascend beyond the Three Realms and attain the highest rank of Supreme Clarity, Xian, though benighted, earnestly seeks to receive them. He respectfully presents the ritual pledge in proper form and approaches Master Zhang, a Master of the Three Caverns and Middle Peak, residing in Dongming Abbey, Huaiyin Township, Chang’an County, Yongzhou, to receive the Ten Precepts and the Fourteen Articles for Conducting the Body, vowing to cultivate and venerate them, treasuring them forever as the body’s sacred jewel. Should he violate this covenant, he shall be bound in the eternal darkness of hell, and dares not plead for absolution.
