*Essential Regulations for Cultivation, Rituals, and Precepts, Scroll One*
Compiled by Daoist Zhu Faman of the Three Caverns

The sagely respond to the world, ever relying on scriptural teachings. Without establishing the true treasures, how could salvation be achieved? Their mouths utter jade-like texts, expounding these numinous mysteries, returning to purity and reverting to simplicity—all hinges upon this, rooted in the heart. For those who seek learning, the method is manifest herein.

The *Scripture of Generating the Spirit* states: During the Dragon Han kalpa, the Heavenly Worthy expounded the *Scriptures of the Cavern of Perfection*; during the Crimson Brightness kalpa, the *Scriptures of the Cavern of Mystery*; and during the Kaihuang kalpa, the *Scriptures of the Cavern of Divinity*. These Three Cavern Scriptures, replete with profound and arcane teachings, adapt to the capacities of beings, liberating and guiding gods and humans, enabling the six destinies to return to the real and the three vehicles to awaken to truth. Practices vary in elevation, methods in profundity—thirty-six divisions thus emerge and become illustrious.

The *True Treasury Scripture* says: First, the *Shangqing*; second, the *Wonderful Perfection*; third, the *Great One*; fourth, the *Wonderful Grove*; fifth, the *Transformation and Enlightenment*; sixth, the *Immortals*; seventh, the *Yellow Grove*; eighth, the *Supreme Perfected*; ninth, the *Teachings of the Dao*; tenth, the *Supreme Refinement*; eleventh, the *Supreme Meritorious Virtue*; twelfth, the *Scriptures of the Dao and Its Power*. These twelve divisions of scriptures are stored within the Great Cavern’s Treasury of the Jade Clarity Realm.

First, the *Cavern of Mystery*; second, the *Primal Yang*; third, the *Primal Celestial Stem*; fourth, the *Great Kalpa*; fifth, the *Supreme Enlightenment*; sixth, the *Inner Tones*; seventh, the *Refinement of Life*; eighth, the *Numinous Secrets*; ninth, the *Dispelling of Demons*; tenth, the *Boundless*; eleventh, the *Massage*; twelfth, the *Supreme Communication*. These twelve divisions of scriptures reside within the Treasury of the Supreme Clarity Realm.

First, the *Great Clarity*; second, the *Penetrating Vision*; third, the *Assembly of Immortals*; fourth, the *Cavern Abyss*; fifth, the *Inner Secrets*; sixth, the *True One*; seventh, the *Assembly of Spirits*; eighth, the *Middle Essence*; ninth, the *Boundless*; tenth, the *Palace Assembly*; eleventh, the *Yellow Court*; twelfth, the *Lesser Kalpa*. These twelve divisions belong to the Treasury of the Great Clarity Realm.

Thus, the revealed scriptures of the Three Caverns are inscribed upon golden tablets, their models transmitted by the seven sages, elucidated in jade-like texts. Once in ten thousand kalpas, the Dao emerges in accordance with the people.

The *Statutes of the Supreme Perfected* states: In the first year of the Han An era, on the first day of the fifth month, the Most High Lord Lao bestowed upon Zhang Daoling at Mount Heming the *Scriptures of Orthodox Unity and the Alliance of Awe*, comprising nine hundred and thirty scrolls, along with seventy scrolls of talismans and charts, totaling one thousand scrolls. He also transmitted the *Great Cavern True Scripture* in twenty-one scrolls to those who had already attained perfection.

The *Scripture of Great Peace* records:
A perfected one asked, “What are the Heavenly Scriptures? The Earthly Scriptures? The Human Scriptures? The Dao Scriptures? The Sagely Scriptures? The Worthy Scriptures? The Auspicious Scriptures? The Inauspicious Scriptures? The Scriptures of Life? The Scriptures of Death?”

The divine being replied: “Those who cultivate and accumulate the true Dao—this is the Heavenly Scripture. Heaven delights in life, and the Dao also delights in life; thus, it is the Heavenly Scripture. Those who cultivate and accumulate virtue—this is the Earthly Scripture. Earth delights in nurturing, and virtue also delights in nurturing; thus, it is the Earthly Scripture. Those who cultivate harmony and delight in bestowing—this is the Human Scripture. Harmonious qi flows and circulates; humans possess wealth and should likewise circulate it; thus, harmony is the Human Scripture. Those who cultivate and accumulate the teachings of the Dao from the high, middle, and low antiquity—these are the Dao Scriptures. Those who cultivate and accumulate the sagely texts of the high, middle, and low antiquity—these are the Sagely Scriptures. Those who cultivate and accumulate the worthy teachings of the high, middle, and low antiquity—these are the Worthy Scriptures. If one’s teacher is auspicious, these are the Auspicious Scriptures; if one’s teacher is inauspicious, these are the Inauspicious Scriptures. If one’s teacher lives, these are the Scriptures of Life; if one’s teacher dies, these are the Scriptures of Death.”

The Dao is made manifest by the sagely; the Way is propagated by humans. The *Scriptures of the Dao* state: “If lords and kings can preserve the myriad things, all will transform of themselves. Know that when the human king possesses the Dao, the Great Dao flourishes; when the human king lacks the Dao, the Great Dao declines.”

*Notes on Transmitting Scriptures*
White feathers and black quills mark the words of successive generations...

Gold fish and jade dragons—how could these be the faith of ordinary men?

That which may be transmitted yet cannot be received, that which is hard to behold and harder still to follow: such distinctions arise from the depth or shallowness of one’s vessel, the coarseness or refinement of one’s karmic conditions. The Primordial Beginning illumines the three vehicles’ dharma-mirror, encompassing all divergent streams; the Most High unfolds the subtle words of the two scrolls, universally guiding all back to the One.

The *Sutra of Original Appearance* states: “The body is the root of the three evils, the foundation of divine immortals. It is called by ten names: first, the Field of Good Fortune; second, the Garden of Thorns; third, the House of Seeds; fourth, the Gate of Abandoned Life; fifth, the Realm of the Dao; sixth, the Village of Pus and Blood; seventh, the Vessel of Treasures; eighth, the Basin of Shards; ninth, the Chamber of Bright Wisdom; tenth, the Person of Ninefold Nightly Darkness. One who knows this principle may be called a Perfected Person.”

Yet those who speak without substance must not be allowed to hear the scriptures; only those who possess both substance and speech may receive transmission.

The *Sutra of Ascending Mystery* states: “In the degenerate age, the people are beset by three fears—let them be carefully examined. First, jealousy toward the Dao and its teachings is to be feared; second, slander is to be feared; third, greed and desire are to be feared. Jealousy toward the Dao and its teachings obstructs the circulation of scriptural dharma; slander of dharma-teachers causes the common people’s faith in the Dao to wane; greed for wealth and sensuality renders one despised by others. Of these three, two lie without, one within. Only by eliminating these three afflictions may one transmit the Dao.”

The *Sutra of Original Boundary* states: “One who fulfills the ten good vows may be entrusted with transmission. What are the ten good vows? First, the vow to depart from the defiled and杂境界 of the world; second, the vow to leave the household life, forsake worldly attachments, follow conditions to beg alms, widely establish fields of merit, constantly practice compassion and forbearance, and forever abandon notions of self and others; third, the vow to encounter superior friends who guide and instruct; fourth, the vow to meet an enlightened teacher and quietly receive the supreme Dao; fifth, the vow to hear the true dharma and practice accordingly; sixth, the vow to behold the Heavenly Worthy and personally receive the sacred decree; seventh, the vow to deliver all beings, placing others before oneself; eighth, the vow to widely proclaim the dharma-sound to dispel ignorance; ninth, the vow that all sentient beings may awaken the intention for the Dao, exhorting them to create scriptures and images, construct numinous temples, and offer incense, flowers, lamps, and candles according to their means, so that all who have not yet awakened may universally behold the dharma-gate; tenth, the vow that one’s own mind remain steadfast and unretreatant. Only one who fulfills these ten vows may be entrusted with transmission.”

The *Sutra of Ascending Mystery* states: “In future ages, those who wish to circulate the *Inner Teachings Sutra of Numinous Treasure* must possess eleven qualities to gain the trust of the people before they may propagate this scripture. First, they must uphold the precepts completely, with no inner transgressions; second, they must relieve the orphaned, the elderly, and the poor, possessing a heart of compassion and pity...”

Third, they must urge others to shun evil and cultivate goodness with the devotion of a parent for a child; fourth, they must not seek fame or reputation, treating praise and blame as one; fifth, in secluded places, they must diligently perform rites and worship, cultivating all meritorious deeds as if in the presence of a great assembly; sixth, they must not deceive, so that the people trust them as they trust the four seasons; seventh, they must wholly renounce glory and splendor, refusing all ranks and titles; eighth, they must forsake wife and children, dwelling alone in quietude; ninth, they must draw near to the wise and learned, broadly inquiring into the good Dao; tenth, though in seclusion, they must not remain solitary in mind, but discuss and deliberate with the worthy, never clinging obstinately to their own views; eleventh, they must always act with humility and reverence toward others. These are the eleven qualities that accord with the practice of the Inner Teachings.

There are also ten marks by which one may be entrusted with the transmission of this scripture. First, they must ardently seek superior dharma, following goodness as water flows downward; second, they must delight in drawing near to the wise and learned, harboring no suspicion or doubt; third, they must be discerning, able to distinguish truth from falsehood; fourth, they must be cautious, never speaking beyond their conduct; fifth, they must be gentle and harmonious, seldom committing transgressions; sixth, they must be able to take as teachers those superior to themselves, without arrogance or pride; seventh, they must revere their teachers and value the teachings as a pauper values treasure; eighth, they must serve their teachers and elders, sparing no effort or toil; ninth, they must feel a sense of repayment toward their former teachers; tenth, they must diligently request and receive instruction, unremitting day and night. These are the ten marks.

It is further said: Even one of lowly status, if possessed of true virtue unknown to others, may be worthy of upholding this dharma. Such a person may emerge unexpectedly, in a place beyond suspicion, and should be entrusted with the transmission of this scripture.

The *Hidden Commentary on the Jade Scripture* states: If one receives the scriptures without reverence, and teacher and disciple cultivate them improperly, they will suffer no response and later fall ill, even among their livestock.

The *Scripture of Great Peace* says: To withhold transmission from one who is worthy is to block the Dao of Heaven, and the harm falls upon oneself; to transmit to one who is unworthy is to invite retribution later.

The *Fixed Resolve* states: To withhold transmission from one who is worthy causes others to be cut off from the Dao; to hasten transmission to one who is unworthy brings immediate punishment in this life, and in the next, one violates the statutes twice over.

For coarse conduct is easily tainted, while sublime practice is difficult to follow. Though learners are as numerous as trees in a forest, those who succeed are few. The slightest deviation from the true canon binds one to transgression.

The *Precepts of the Woman in Blue* says: To receive the Dao without discerning its weight, to transmit it to the unworthy, to covet wealth and profit, to take from others for one’s own gain, to borrow without returning—treating what is borrowed as one’s own treasure—shortens one’s lifespan by 1,024 years.

The precepts state: One must not recklessly transmit the treasure of the scriptures to the faithless, nor reveal the true essentials of the Dao, lest Heaven shorten one’s lifespan by 96,000 years.

The *Yellow Register Simplified Writs* says: To transmit the scriptures when unqualified invites judgment by the Court of Luminous Brahma; to persist in transmission despite three warnings of the wind-knife brings judgment by the Court of Rectification; to present credentials to a teacher when one’s rank is unsuited, or to intimidate a teacher with authority, brings judgment by the Court of the Four Luminaries; to fail to observe the proper forms of deference brings judgment by the Court of Grand Ritual; to receive the scriptures with stinginess, failing to prepare the proper ritual offerings, brings judgment by the Court of Celestial Surveillance; to transmit without invoking the oath to the Five Emperors brings judgment by the Court of Execution; to carelessly reveal the titles of the scriptures or expose the celestial truths brings judgment by the Court of Heavenly Oaths; to fail in the proper observance of incense and lamps brings judgment by the Court of Numinous Might; to fail to transmit the dharma to three disciples as an "opening teacher," to seven as a "registering teacher," or to nine as a "transmitting teacher" brings judgment by the Court of Luminous Might; to have fulfilled the merit requirements for the Three Teachers and reached the required years, yet deliberately conceal and sever the dharma-gate, brings judgment by the Court of the Great Yin; to receive the dharma and fail to establish meritorious works brings judgment by the Court of Luminous Capital; to receive the dharma and fail to broadly transform others, leaving no name in the register of those delivered, brings judgment by the Court of the Lower Prime; to receive the dharma and fail to make vows for the Three Teachers brings judgment by the Court of Luminous Capital; to receive the dharma and fail to deliver even one person, obstructing the path of the worthy and seeking merit for oneself, brings judgment by the Court of the Dark Capital; to receive the scriptures and fail to properly arrange the altar, high seat, canopy, incense, and lamps brings judgment by the Court of Luminous Capital.

The *Statutes of Illuminating the True* state: For each of the true writs, one must use silk of a length corresponding to the years of one’s life; any discrepancy brings judgment by the Dark Court.

The statutes say: When receiving the true writs, one must use three golden dragons, casting them into the water府, mountain dwellings, or residences. Failure to cast them in all three places results in the Three Officials seizing the person, and one’s life register will be marked with a violation, bringing judgment by the Court of the Nine Capitals.

The statutes say: For the patterned silks of the Five Emperors, each must be forty feet in length, to invoke the Five Emperors as witnesses to the oath. Any violation brings judgment by the Court of the Yellow Springs.

The statutes say: One must use five taels of superior gold to pledge the Five Peaks as surety for the treasure of the scriptures. Any violation brings judgment by the Court of the Yin Officials.

The statutes say: One must use 240,000 gold coins to secure the twenty-four qi. If gold coins are unavailable, bronze coins may be used. Any violation brings judgment by the Court of the Capital Spirits.

The statutes say: Incense and lamps must be used to open the Nine Treasuries. Any violation brings judgment by the Court of the Great Yin.

The statutes say: One who receives the scriptures must maintain the fast. Any violation brings judgment by the Court of the Great Yang.

The statutes say: The celestial texts are secret and weighty; without faith, they are not treasured. Thus, the sages of old used faith to test the heart. Without faith, one demeans the Dao; without oaths, one trivializes the treasure. Any violation brings judgment by the Left and Right Courts.

The statutes say: To receive the scriptures without the Five Emperors as teachers, or to rashly peruse the texts without invoking the oath, incurs the same penalty as the statute for stealing the scriptures, bringing judgment by the Court of Luminous Law.

The above statutes are difficult to follow and easy to violate. Searching the texts and reflecting on their contents, none can fail to shudder. To sit upright and refrain from transmission is to obstruct and sever the dharma; to begin in accord with the intent of transmission yet deviate from the ten practices is to be torn between advance and retreat, with the fires of remorse intertwined.

How much worse for those of greedy and cruel disposition, whose hearts are hardened like leather armor! They do not inquire into the conduct of their predecessors, seeking only to possess the treasures of their disciples. They transmit the scriptures without regard for their sacred meaning, never once considering the restraints and prohibitions. Lacking the ritual offerings and pledges of the fast, how could they observe the rules of oaths and covenants? When disciples see their teachers’ example, they later imitate such transmission, unafraid of the underworld’s records, seeking only fame and profit. They destroy the Dao and corrupt the dharma—such people are the very source of this ruin.

The *Scripture of Western Ascension* states:
"In delusion they transmit to one another,
Passing it on in endless succession.
Falsehood invades the true,
And emptiness takes form as if real.
Deceiving themselves, they cannot discern truth,
Clinging to profit and guarding their gains.
The eternal Dao is forgotten,
And fools, blind to their own faults,
Are like wood that kindles its own fire,
Only to burn and rot away."
How true these words are—let us take them to heart and urge one another forward.

The *Statutes of Illuminating the True* in the *Transmission Copy* states:
"When receiving the true scriptures and dharma pledges, one must deduct two-tenths to offer to the ancestral masters, and another two-tenths to distribute to the poor."

The mountain-dwelling Daoist Yu Xinchong provided incense and lamps to establish merit for his disciples. For violations, he was examined by the Three Officials’ Bureau.

The *Statutes of the Great True* states:
"Those who receive governance from the Celestial Master must divide and allocate their households. They may not, like independent practitioners, retain twelve portions for themselves but must dedicate five of ten portions to merit. Upon entering the Celestial Master’s governance, this decree is to be proclaimed so all may know. Those who violate it shall be judged by the Five Punishments."

The *Statutes of the Four Poles Illuminating the Dao* states:
"Whenever transmitting the precious scriptures of Highest Clarity, if one receives offerings from disciples, one-third is to be scattered among mountain-dwelling recluses to relieve the destitute and impoverished. One portion is for one’s own ritual vestments, and one portion is to establish merit for the disciple’s seven ancestors. On the day of scattering offerings to mountain recluses, one should vow that all destitute, impoverished, and diligent hidden scholars in the world may soon attain the Dao, transcend the world, and ascend as immortals. On the day of making one’s ritual vestments, one should vow that one’s own body may share the same countenance as the divine immortals, donning their robes and headdresses to obtain the rules of immortal transcendence. When lighting lamps and burning incense, one should vow that the disciple and one’s own seven generations of ancestors may swiftly escape the knife mountains and the three paths of the five sufferings, ascend to the Southern Palace, return to the womb to be reborn as immortals, and in all matters follow the dharma to attain the true Dao. Those who violate these covenants and neglect the statutes shall be examined and punished in their own bodies."

The statutes further state:
"When receiving the precious scriptures of Highest Clarity, if the pledges and offerings presented to the master are insufficient to meet the required limits, one may not receive the scriptures. After receiving them, if the years for transmission have arrived, one may not accept offerings from others. All must be transmitted to the former master to fulfill the prior limits before the threefold division may proceed. If one violates these statutes, one’s seven ancestors shall be examined."

The *Statutes of Illuminating the True* states:
"If one who has received scriptures has not yet fulfilled the initial pledges but later encounters a worthy person who offers pledges and requests transmission, one must first use the received pledges to fulfill the former master’s limits. The remainder may then be used for one’s own dharma practice. Violations shall be examined by the Fire Officials’ Bureau."

The above three cases differ in their division of transmissions. Following the scriptures’ requirements, modern practitioners now use a twelvefold division, exhausting all for personal gain—this is arrogance toward superiors and violence toward inferiors, an extreme of reckless negligence.

**Transmission Year Limits**
The sages respond to the turning of kalpas,
And the Dao’s resonance is true.
Only when the Dao converges may one transmit,
Not to the unworthy or those lacking the five virtues.

The talismans state:
"After learning the Dao and receiving scriptures, one may transmit to one person every forty years. Those who have extended their lifespan may transmit to one person every four hundred years. Those who have attained earthly immortality may transmit to one person every four thousand years. Those who have attained celestial immortality may transmit to one person every forty thousand years. Those who have attained the supreme Dao may transmit to one person every forty thousand kalpas. The statutes for transmitting the Great Law of the Supreme Numinous Treasure are complete."

The *Hidden Instructions for Ascending to Perfection* states:
"When celestial perfected beings transmit scriptures, or when numinous persons transmit scriptures, they may pass them on six times in three thousand years, ten times in two thousand two hundred years, five times in one thousand years, or three times in seven hundred years. The above year limits are recorded in the jade registers and golden statutes of the sagely emperors and their masters—no later generation may presume to compare."

The *Scripture of the Sage’s Chronicle* states:
"Those whose names are inscribed on golden tablets and jade records will have eyes like sunlight, green teeth, and white blood. Those who possess the golden scriptures and jade registers of Highest Clarity will have shoulder blades like the River Chariot constellation and protruding bones on their chests. Those who hold the cinnabar slips and azure texts of the Great Ultimate will have lines on their palms resembling inverted human figures. Those with dark, purple names will have four rings in their eyes, with purple light at the center. Those with jade registers of Great Clarity will have voices like jade tones and golden echoes, square mouths, and round eyes. Those with golden names in the Great Simplicity will have white veins visible on their abdomens and purple qi in their mouths. Those with dark registers in the Dipper will have nine apertures in their hearts, brocade patterns on their lungs, a jade pellet beneath their jaws, green sinews in their eyes, and upward-curving brows. Such are the signs of the immortal perfected. Their comings and goings, actions and retreats, are not mere escape from the corpse. The transmission year limits may be followed as before."

Today’s masters, however, cannot guarantee their lifespans. They encounter scriptural teachings as if a mustard seed were cast onto a needle’s point, or as if a blind turtle were to chance upon a floating log’s hole. If they adhere strictly to the year limits, their wishes may be thwarted. Thus, they should act with compassion and benevolence, harboring the supreme Dao in their hearts, and fulfilling the ten vows before transmission may proceed.

The *Hidden Instructions for Ascending to Perfection* states:
"For a student of utmost dedication, one should diligently focus on the numinous and unseen, and petition the mysterious master. If even a slight affinity exists, enlightenment will surely follow. Only when the limits of the assembled perfected beings are met may one form an alliance. Once allied, one must cultivate, and in cultivation, one must persevere to the end. Then I shall share my gold with them as a friend. Those who do not meet these conditions need not strive in vain. To merely guard the scriptures until one’s satchel is full is to burden one’s seven ancestors, and the stones of the river’s examination will only multiply. The ancients called this 'fine skin,' but I name it 'ear-learning'—hearing the Dao, they crawl forward on their knees; when the Dao is silent, all is forgotten."

The Dao must be transmitted and received to be obtained; cultivation is not in vain. Like the forbidden arts of the world, without transmission, their use is ineffective. This single statement is enough for profound realization.

The *Statutes of the Mysterious Capital* states:
"Daoist and female officials who wear the insignia of office may not recklessly transmit the Dao to others. Only those of utmost sincerity and diligence may be permitted to receive it. For the wicked and rebellious, three generations shall be examined."

The *Natural Instructions* states:
"Before transmission, master and disciple must first observe a fast for three months, or ten, thirty, or twenty days. Then, together, they ascend a mountain peak or altar to transmit the scriptures. After receiving them, if the disciple encounters a worthy person of sincere heart and devotion to the Dao, they may present precious offerings to seek transmission without waiting for the year limits. If no such person appears, the remaining dharma offerings may be transmitted later to serve as a field of merit for all. The master may not selfishly retain them—such a sin is grave indeed."

The *Luminous Perfection Regulations* states:
"Those who superficially honor the Three Treasures yet fail to focus their minds, who treat scriptures and dharma with disdain, and profane sacred texts with irreverence; or who transmit teachings to disciples without adhering to the prescribed years; or who, without invoking Heaven and Earth, privately transmit without oaths, creating their own methods and violating the Four Pledges—such sins are grave indeed. In death, they shall suffer the shaving of their heads and the yoke of bondage, then be forced to climb the Sword Trees where eight winds blow from all directions, causing the trees to sway violently. Their feet shall fall upon the Knife Mountains, ascending and descending without end, their hands and bodies torn and wounded, the pain unbearable, the torment unendurable. For ten thousand kalpas, they shall be reborn among the lowest and most foolish; or afflicted with the six maladies, deaf and blind, forever cut off from the Dao, eternally barred from the gates of learning. They shall revolve through the Five Sufferings, sinking in the mire of sin, unable to attain liberation, forever planting the roots of evil. Those who transmit scriptures unlawfully bring this punishment upon themselves. Master and disciple must cherish and honor the wondrous Dao.

Thus concludes the first scroll of *Essential Regulations and Precepts, Wondrous Volume*.
*Essential Regulations and Precepts, Collected Notes*, Scroll Two.
Compiled by Daoist Zhu Faman of the Three Caverns.
Scripture Copying Notes."

The dragon’s script shines resplendent, the phoenix’s calligraphy flows with compassion; the purple brush inscribes its verses, the azure forest resounds with its echoes. In the Floating Black Realm, it broadly delivers devas and humans; within the refining pool, the torch of lofty wisdom blazes bright. The August Person inscribed it in kalpas past, the Azure Lad transmitted it in years gone by. Once the primordial chapter was opened, the Thearch’s brush was set to work. The Dharma-bridge is thus erected, and the shore of blessings may be ascended—such is made manifest in the act of copying and transcribing.

The *Sutra of the Fundamental Boundary* states: Should there be one who, with paper and ink, silk and fine cloth, carves jade or engraves gold, copies and transcribes, binds and mounts with cords and rollers, circulates and recites, proclaims to the unhearing—know that such a person has entered the portion of the Dao, their name inscribed in the Golden Register, their characters listed in the Jade Chapters.

The *Great Precepts* declare: Copying scriptures renders one’s descendants generation after generation wise and discerning, vast in learning and profound in mystery, ever encountering sagely eras. Know that today’s enlightened worthies and erudite scholars all owe their attainment to the copying of the Three Caverns’ sacred scriptures. Not only do they gain benefit in future lives, but even in the present they reap blessings.

The *Great Precepts* further state: For every coin spent in copying sacred scriptures, one receives a seventy-four myriad-fold recompense; for ten thousand coins, the reward is beyond reckoning. To relinquish one and gain ten thousand is ever praised—how much more so the seventy-four myriad-fold? The merit is towering, the virtue majestic. Even the wealthy and noble cannot receive such in vain.

The *Regulations of the Thousand Perfected* state: Should one copy the scriptures of the Three Vehicles—intending to copy the Great Vehicle but copying the Middle or Lesser instead—one incurs the five grave transgressions. But if intending to copy the Lesser or Middle and copying the Great Vehicle, no offense is committed.

**Recitation and Invocation of Mantras**

The scriptures issue from the sacred mouth, the Dharma is cultivated by the ordinary; their wondrous meaning is hard to fathom, while a coarse mind easily falters. Since written words are never solitary, each section and rank differs, and the invocations vary accordingly. Follow what is recited and practiced, each clarifying its own canonical rules.

1. **Reciting the *Sutra of Original Form***: Invoke the mantra.
   First strike the Dharma-drum thirty-six times, bow to the scripture thrice, and recite the mantra:
   *Profound, profound, the Perfect Dao of utmost truth,
   Pure and still, it returns to the Primordial Sovereign.
   Celestial perfected gather in radiant splendor,
   A hundred spirits converge beneath the resplendent sun.
   The four assemblies offer their hearts in devotion,
   Thus assembling the great immortal essence.
   The heavens’ halls open in due time,
   All kneel in reverent accord.
   Wondrous teachings spread transforming grace,
   Delivering the three paths from suffering.*

2. **Reciting the *Yellow Court Scripture***: Invoke and visualize.
   The *Alliance Rites of the Four Poles* state: When reciting the *Yellow Court Scripture*, one must burn incense and purify with fasting, don the ritual vestments, and enter the chamber facing north. Bow four times, kneel, and knock the teeth twenty-four times. Petition the Most High, Myriad Perfected, Jade Dawn, Supreme Great Dao Lord: “Your disciple now enters the chamber to recite and chant the Jade Scripture, refining the spirit and guarding the treasury. I beseech the flourishing of the Palace of the Stomach, that my body may ride the void, ascend to the imperial court, and upon completion, turn east to bow four times to the Great Thearch.”
   Again knock the teeth twelve times and petition the Great Thearch of Fusang and the Divine King of Yang Valley: “Your disciple now enters the chamber to unfold and chant the Jade Scripture. I beseech a tranquil chamber where magic mushrooms spontaneously grow, jade blossoms shine in splendor, the Three Luminaries illumine with clarity, and myriad embryonic immortals attain union with the imperial spirits.”
   Upon completion, face east and recite ten times for one cycle. After one cycle, return to face north and bow four times, then face east and bow four times. No further petition is needed. Should one violate these regulations, they shall suffer the punishment of the wind-blades.

3. **Reciting the *Scriptures of Lord Lao***: Invoke and visualize.
   The *Hidden Instructions of the Supreme Ultimate* state: First burn incense, arrange the ritual vestments, and bow ten times. Visualize within the heart the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center, Lord Lao the Perfected of the River’s Edge, and Master Yin.
   The *Mantra of Unfolding the Scripture* states:
   *Profound, profound, the ancestral school of the Perfect Dao,
   Supreme virtue embodies the Vast Origin.
   Though the celestial perfected are distant and wondrous,
   They draw near through the Sovereign of the Muddy Pellet.
   Palaces and chambers are all of seven treasures,
   Windows and doors naturally part.
   Purity ever attracts the true,
   Riding the purple clouds in luminous ascent.
   Sun and moon illuminate left and right,
   Ascending as immortals, preserving eternal years.
   Seven ancestors ascend to heaven,
   Their generations become the gate of virtue and power.*
   Upon completion, knock the teeth thirty-six times and swallow saliva thirty-six times. First visualize the Azure Dragon on the left, the White Tiger on the right, the Vermilion Bird before, and the Dark Warrior behind. Beneath the feet, the eight trigrams’ divine tortoise and thirty-six lions prostrate ahead. The headscarf bears the Seven Stars, the five viscera generate the five qi, and a net of script covers the body. The Three Ones attend the scripture, each accompanied by a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders. Heaven and earth each have eighteen thousand jade maidens and jade lads guarding them.
   For every five hundred characters read, knock the teeth three times and swallow saliva three times.

4. **Reciting the *Supreme Purity Scriptures***: Invoke and visualize.
   The *Golden Register Simplified Texts* state: When reading the *Supreme Purity Scriptures*, face north and bow nine times before the seat, then ascend facing east, turning left to face north.
   The *Hidden Commentary on the Jade Scripture’s Mantra of Unfolding the Scripture* states:
   *Subtle, subtle, the gate of the Mysterious School,
   Radiant and bright, it pierces the Hollow Cavern.
   The Perfect Dao arises from stillness and silence,
   Where one beholds the Three Pristine Palaces.
   The Great Dao is accomplished here,
   Riding the luminous clouds and dragons.
   On left and right attend the scripture’s guardians,
   Jade maidens and jade lads.
   The body crosses the river of immortality,
   Untangling the nets to follow the divine wind.
   Seven ancestors and the womb-born
   Become the ancestral school of immortals.*
   The *Golden Register Simplified Texts* state: Knock the teeth nine times and visualize nine-colored clouds filling the chamber. The Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Lion, Dark Tortoise, immortal lads and jade maidens, and the officials of the Three Realms and Five Thearchs all guard left and right. Proceed before and behind, riding the heavens and reclining upon the earth while reciting the scripture. Upon completion, descend from the western side of the platform and bow as at the beginning.
   The *Jade Commentary* states: Knock the teeth thirty-six times and swallow saliva thirty-six times. First visualize the Perfected of the Returning Wind and the Blended Unity, along with a hundred spirits and myriad perfected, then begin reading the scripture.

5. **Reciting the *Numinous Treasure* scriptures and mantras.**
   The *Golden Register Simplified Texts* state: When reading the *Numinous Treasure Scriptures*, face east, burn incense before the scripture, bow three times, and ascend the seat facing north.

The *Hidden Commentary on the Jade Scripture: Mystic Essence of the Opening Scripture Mantra* states:
Silent, it reaches the ultimate source,
Voidly towering, aeons high as Mount Meru.
Vast and open, the profound scripture unfolds—
Who can fathom its depths?
Once entering the Great Vehicle’s path,
Who reckons the kalpas’ span?
Neither born nor destroyed,
Yet born from the lotus.
Transcending the paths of the Three Realms,
With compassionate heart, one unbinds the world’s snares.
The Perfected, of unsurpassed virtue,
Generation after generation, become immortals.

Upon completion, knock the teeth thirty-six times and swallow saliva thirty-six times. Visualize the qi of the Five Viscera in their five colors, ascending to infuse the essence of the Five Stars, then begin reading the scripture.

6. **Reciting the *Scriptures of the Three Sovereigns*.**
The *Golden Register Simplified Texts* state: When reading the *Scriptures of the Three Sovereigns*, face south, burn incense before the scripture, bow twice, and ascend the seat facing west, then turn left to face south.

The *Hidden Commentary on the Jade Scripture: Mystic Essence of the Opening Scripture Mantra* states:
The Supreme’s talisman of settled spirit,
Inscribed with the mandate of heaven and earth’s grace.
At the summons, they need not await their chariots—
Myriad immortals swiftly gather.
Calling forth spirits, great or small,
How much less the impure and defiled?
With pure fast, cut off worldly affairs,
In subtle communion, face the divine.
Ascend to the Jade Clarity Palace,
To roam and feast beyond the Nine Distances.

Upon completion, the *Simplified Texts* state: Knock the teeth three times and visualize three-colored clouds filling the chamber. The Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, and Dark Warrior guard the four directions, while divine youths and jade maidens attend left and right. Swallow qi three times, then recite the scripture. When finished, descend from the eastern side of the platform and bow as at the beginning.

7. **Pacing the Void.**
The *Hidden Commentary on the Jade Scripture* states: When reciting the *Scripture of Pacing the Void*, first knock the teeth three times and swallow saliva three times. Visualize the sun and moon before your face, entering through the nostrils into the Grotto Chamber’s Golden Flower Palace. Radiance emerges from behind the neck, blazing forth as a nine-colored orb, subtly penetrating the Jade Pillow to illumine the ten directions. Follow this light as you circumambulate the scripture.

The sun enters through the left nostril, the moon through the right. Upon completion, knock the teeth again as before, then recite the Secret Mantra of Commanding Demons.

The *Ritual Observances of the Hundred Families’ Fast* states that the Mantra of Commanding Demons reads:
*Yellow Center’s strategem-qi severs demons,
The Ancestral Inspector curbs the strong.
Essence severs the perverse and seals it—
The Supreme has decreed,
The Supreme’s chamber urgently summons the Northern Thearch.
Proceed to the Jade Palace,
Receive and bear the majestic command.
Proclaim the Demon Kings of the Five Qi,
Lush and dense, in accord with the mandate.
Pierce the secret treasury of jade,
The script’s pattern attains flourishing.
The Three Heavens revolve in brightness,
The Six Heavens’ revolutions end.
How worthy!*

The *Precentor* may intone: *All officials, visualize the nine-colored orb, swallow saliva three times, and contemplate the Secret Mantra of Commanding Demons. Pace the Void according to the method.*

**Entering and Exiting the Dao’s Portal.**
Contemplate the *Golden Register Simplified Texts*.

**Entering the Dao’s Portal in the Morning:**
Outside the portal of the fasting hall, knock the teeth three times.
The incantation reads:
*Fourfold Luminous Merit Officers,
Messengers of Communicating with the Perfected,
Jade Lads of Transmitting Words,
Jade Maidens of Attending in Stillness—
Convey my words,
To the hall’s presiding spirits.
Primal qi of the Upper Origin,
Enter my body.*

Then proceed to the *Laozi’s Visualization Chart*, which states:
One Fourfold Luminous Merit Officer,
One Messenger of Communicating with the Perfected,
Two Jade Lads of Transmitting Words,
Two Jade Maidens of Attending in Stillness.

The *Golden Register Simplified Texts* state:
**Entering the Dao’s Portal at Night:**
Outside the portal, face it and knock the teeth three times.
The incantation reads:
*Fourfold Upper Merit Officers,
Dragon-Tiger Messengers,
Upright One’s Primal Qi,
Attending in Stillness’s Plain Maidens—
At night, when making petitions,
May the Luminous Lad and Upper Mystery Maiden
Accompany me into the Yellow Chamber’s interior,
Conveying all petitions,
Ensuring they ascend on high.*

Then proceed to the *Laozi’s Visualization Chart*, which states:
One Fourfold Upper Merit Officer,
Two Dragon-Tiger Messengers,
One Attending in Stillness’s Plain Maiden,
One Luminous Lad,
One Upper Mystery Maiden.

The *Golden Register Simplified Texts* state:
**Exiting the Portal:**
Knock the teeth three times.
The incantation reads:
*Exiting yin, entering yang,
Myriad spirits open the passage.
With affairs concluded, the gates close—
Pray seal the Yellow Chamber.
Jade Maidens of Attending in Stillness,
Brightly attend the divine palace.*

The *Visualization Chart* states:
The Jade Maidens are the wondrous qi of spontaneity,
Responding to stimuli to form shapes.
Their forms and substance are luminous and pure,
Clear and bright as jade.
Hidden, they possess moisture;
Manifest, they are without perversity.
The adept’s true steps gradually ascend,
Advancing and retreating in form,
Entering and exiting in the Dao.
The Dao’s qi is subtly wondrous,
Responding to all, great and small.
In due order, they guide from low to high.
Thus, by day, Jade Maidens guard the palace;
By night, the Plain Maidens convey affairs,
Aiding in peril and ascending the Dao’s arena.

The *Golden Register Simplified Texts* state:
**Exiting the Portal at Night:**
Turn left and knock the teeth three times.
The incantation reads:
*Mystic Upper Great Yin,
Eight windows open in brightness.
Facing where petitions are made,
The Maiden conveys the numinous.
With affairs complete, return to your stations—
Myriad spirits silently repose.*

**Notes on the Lecture Manual:**
The true scriptures and sacred canons
Illumine the various heavens,
Jade characters and golden texts
Transmitted to this day.
The Dao is profound and abstruse,
Its secret treasury hard to open.
Were it not for the greatly capable,
How could the benighted be enlightened?

**I. On Orientation.**
The *Scripture of Ascending the Mystery* states: When lecturing on scriptures, the Dharma Master and Scripture Master sit facing each other. The seat is five feet high, and they may sit facing any of the four directions, with three bows as the limit.

**II. On Visualization.**
The *Laozi’s Visualization Chart* states: When lecturing, first visualize the Three Colors, then the Three Ones. The Dao’s practice has six periods; when lecturing, it is always the three periods of post-meal, afternoon, and settling into stillness. Enter the fasting hall at these three periods, offer incense, bow three times, and circumambulate to sit in order.

When seated, if there is an assembly, the Dharma Master strikes the seat with a board, then places it before the knees. Closing the eyes and clasping the hands, visualize the head’s qi as azure, the hands’ qi as red, and the feet’s qi as white. The three qi encircle the body. Then visualize the Three Ones: the spirits of the three places are of one Dao.

The Dao is fundamentally one, yet in response to stimuli it manifests as three. Within and beyond the Three Realms, there is nowhere it does not reside. Governing transformation and presiding over beings, it is called the Three Heavens. The Most High proclaims teachings and attends to the scriptures, called the Three Primes. Lord Lao descends to humanity to perfect virtue, called the Three Ones.

The Three Ones dwell within humans, and humans possess three palaces: the brain is named the Upper Prime Palace, its spirit called Yi; the heart is named the Middle Prime Palace, its spirit called Xi; below the navel is named the Lower Prime Palace, its spirit called Wei. All resemble infants, each one inch in length. In silent sitting with proper posture, they are desireless and non-active, their bodies devoid of sensory response.

Next, visualize the Three Masters. First rise and face the seat, bowing three times before the Three Worthies at the seat’s front. Then visualize the Scripture Master, Register Master, and Initiation Master, each receiving one bow, totaling six bows, before ascending the high seat.

Next, visualize the attendants and guards. Upon ascending the seat and settling into a grand posture with the board set aside, strike the drum thirty-six times, swallow saliva thirty-six times, and with eyes closed, behold the Azure Dragon to the left, White Tiger to the right, Vermilion Bird before, and Dark Warrior behind. Beneath the feet, the Eight Trigrams’ divine tortoise and thirty-six lions prostrate in front. The headscarf bears the Seven Stars, the five viscera generate the five qi, and the net-patterned scripture covers the body. The Three Ones attend to the scriptures, each accompanied by a thousand sages and ten thousand riders, with jade lads and maidens as guards.

Visualization is the foremost of tranquil contemplation; entering samādhi is the gateway to stilling thoughts. Discernment and spiritual wandering are swift without haste.

Beneath the seat, visualize the Three Masters and Three Ones; upon ascending, further contemplate the majestic attendants. Three bows suffice to honor the Three Worthies; six bows disrupt the harmony of the four assemblies. Now, beneath the seat, there is no need for visualization—simply complete the three bows. Upon ascending, sit composed, first visualizing the Three Ones, then the Three Masters, and finally the majestic attendants. This simplified method of visualization allows the mind to circulate effortlessly, avoiding the entanglements of excessive detail, thus aligning with contemporary practice. Strictly adhering to ancient traditions, it is recorded here as follows.

**III. On Hymns and Recitations.**
The *Sutra of Original Form* states: When the patron of the fast invites the Dharma Master to begin the lecture, they rise with three offerings of incense in a precious censer, approach the Dharma Master, bow three times while kneeling, and request: "Disciples, fortunate across a thousand kalpas, have encountered the Dharma Wheel. The teachings bequeathed by the Primordial Beginning now circulate in the world. Today, though we uphold the Dao, we long to hear the numinous voice. We only beseech the Dharma Master to bestow the grace of compassion."

If the Dharma Master consents, they ascend the high seat and chant:
*"Disciples gaze upon the Dharma Master,
Daring to present our plea.
Sentient beings have long dwelled in darkness,
Yearning to hear the supreme Dharma sound.
Great compassion dispels the long night,
Establishing transformation anew across ten thousand kalpas.
The host establishes this meritorious fast,
Extending blessings to the four assemblies."*

When the Dharma Master ascends the high seat, they chant:
*"The fast’s duty lies in the Dao’s work,
The wondrous scriptures prized by the Primordial Beginning.
Thus is built the bridge of kalpas past,
To broadly ferry all beings and things.
Today, a pure fast is established,
Canopies and seats adorned in five hues.
Heavenly immortals wander above,
The Five Emperors arrayed in their directional offices.
The Merit Officers transmit decrees,
Guarding and attending to left and right.
I ascend the dragon-chariot seat,
Jade steps attached to the loom’s rest.
The Divine Empyrean aids in protection,
Heavenly demons dare not raise their eyes.
The Five Spirits remain unmoved,
As the Most High’s domain is proclaimed."*

Upon settling into the seat, they chant:
*"Within the non-action of the Great Dao,
Accumulated qi gives rise to form.
For the multitudes, a bridge is built,
Thus bequeathing the peerless scriptures.
Cultivating them, one attains eternal joy,
No longer born within the Three Realms.
Burning away the dust of the six senses,
With a single mind, listen in tranquil contemplation."*

Upon descending the seat, they chant:
*"The wondrous scriptures spread transformation,
Their distant, profound sounds echoing in the empyrean.
Equally receiving unimpeded wisdom,
The Three Beams ferry across the Yellow Ford.
Divine Empyrean’s Merit Officers,
Weary, briefly rest their spirits.
For the three assemblies’ toil, there shall be reward,
Repayment shall not betray the vow.
Further reports must be made,
Lest the officers grow resentful in waiting."*

Descending the seat and returning to their position, they bow to the Three Treasures.

In discussing the establishment of meritorious fields, all should aspire to brevity and simplicity. Excessive complexity makes practice difficult to follow. Today, it suffices for the practitioner to receive the patron’s bow and invitation, along with the hymns for ascending and descending the seat, to complete the Dharma ritual. Why insist on elaborate details? Thus, both methods are preserved here, lest preferences lead to omissions.

**On Arousing the Mind**
When hearing the Great Vehicle expounded, all must calm their minds and focus their attention. Though words pass through the ears, awakening is singular, yet outcomes differ due to six conditions, each yielding unequal practice:
1. Some perceive heterodoxy masquerading as orthodoxy and recognize its falsity;
2. Some mistake heterodoxy for orthodoxy and thus enter delusion;
3. Some hear the Great but awaken to the Small, entering the coarse;
4. Some hear the Small but awaken to the Great, entering the wondrous;
5. Some advance from the heart, spontaneously generating vows;
6. Some retreat from the heart, thus incurring fault.

This arises from the skill or clumsiness of the teaching, as well as the depth or shallowness of awakening.

The *Sutra of Original Boundary* states: If one awakens to the principle through a wise master’s skillful exposition of all dharmas—neither cultivated nor attained, neither extinguished nor born, neither existent nor nonexistent, neither cause nor effect, yet both existent and nonexistent, neither non-cause nor non-effect—skillfully resolving conditioned origination and provisional names, this is the Middle Way. Those who comprehend this teaching can resonate with diverse beings.

As the *Sutra of Original Boundary* states: *"The Heavenly Worthy expounds the Dharma with a single sound,
Yet sentient beings, according to their kind, each attain understanding."*
Further, as the *Sutra of Original Form* clarifies: The Heavenly Worthy, at Mount Chanli, expounded the *True Writ of the Cavernous Mystery*. For seventy thousand kalpas, they did not rise from the seat, and seven million beings, without constraint, attended. The dragon kings of the ten directions emitted light and came to listen to the Dharma.

The Heavenly Worthy’s disciple, Jinghui, said: *"Even dragons and beasts delight in the Dao—how much more so humans?"*
As the words concluded, a dragon king suddenly grew enraged, summoning clouds and hail that piled ten zhang high. Thereupon, the Heavenly Worthy emitted the five-colored qi, weaving clouds into a canopy. Above, it shielded against the snow and hail, unshaken and unmoved, continuing the exposition as before. With such majestic power, the ten directions all awakened.

The *Scripture of Primordial Origin* states: If one expounds the doctrines of the Lesser Vehicle—teachings of arising and ceasing, of being and non-being, of cause and effect—such a speaker is called an "enlightened master."

The *Great Perfection Regulations* says: When listening to the Dharma, one should harmonize the five tones, attune the five virtues, and regularly practice chanting. Prolonged and refined melodies, gentle speech and measured words, gradually calming the voice—reciting sacred texts in response to the Dharma’s song, one eventually achieves a resonance like jade, forever severing the roots of worldly sound.

If one studies scriptures and cultivates practice, the *Thousand-Character Classic* should come first. Through exposition, one gains mastery, delivering others and perfecting oneself, transforming beings without end—this is the path of the Great Vehicle. Even if one’s talent is yet unrefined, one should arouse courageous resolve, aspiring to the Great Vehicle to transcend the Three Realms. Do not cling to the Lesser Vehicle, coveting offerings and delighting in the pleasures of humans and gods. Pursuing private gain, seeking petty benefits while neglecting great merit, composing ritual texts for others to solicit faith—intoxicated by wine and lust, indulging in sensory pleasures, falsely claiming the Great Vehicle while failing to comprehend it, learning minor arts yet vainly seeking great accomplishment—such delusion leads only to suffering. How pitiful!

The *Precepts of the Mysterious Capital* states: When a Dharma master propagates the teachings throughout the world to save the myriad people, it is the Way of all beings. One must not greedily accept wealth or transmit teachings to slaves and servants—violating this precept incurs a penalty of one year’s illness.

If a virtuous Dharma master practices austerity, wearing only the proper robes of the Way, it is fitting to make offerings. The *Great Precepts* says: To offer incense, oil, vegetarian meals, or a single coin’s worth of Dharma robes to a master brings a reward twenty-four myriad times greater. The merit is vast, the recompense profound—generation after generation will abound in prosperity, never knowing want.

First: If one mistakes the heterodox for the orthodox, one can discern what is not orthodox. As the *True Treasury Scripture* relates: The King of Tufang steadfastly believed in the true Dao. A sorcerer arrived, seeking to convert the king, teaching him false ways. Transforming his form, he soared into the sky, accompanied by music and chants. The palace women and maidens, gazing upon him, were bewitched. For three weeks and five days, none awoke from their delusion. The king admonished him: "You are a demonic trickster—leave at once!" The sorcerer replied: "I am the true Dao, exhorting the king to cultivate goodness." The king said: "I have heard that those who possess the Dao conceal their names and hide their traces, unknown to the multitude. The true Dao is formless—what has form is false." He commanded his minister, Tongling, to debate the sorcerer. Tongling declared: "External paths are full of deceit—there is nothing worth discussing." When they debated the source of wisdom, the sorcerer could not stand his ground. He vanished like a fleeting shadow, and his three thousand followers dared not emerge. Naturally, they were eradicated, and the kingdom returned to purity, turning toward the Great Vehicle. Thus, one knows that the heterodox cannot harm the orthodox—this has been so since ancient times.

Second: If one believes the heterodox to be orthodox, one falls into heterodoxy. As the *True Treasury Scripture* relates: The King of Zitong was virtuous but lacked wisdom. He was deluded by a wild fox, who said to its fox followers: "King Zitong delights in goodness and rejects evil, but his wisdom is shallow. I possess wondrous arts—able to fly and conceal myself. Before the royal palace, a hundred *zhang* above the earth, I will appear as a dignified man, discoursing on emptiness and expounding the Dharma. I will persuade the king to make offerings, even to the point of surrendering his life, and gather them to feast upon. Is this not a supreme plan?" The fox followers all voiced their approval. The fox king then recited hundreds of volumes of illusionary scriptures. It flew before the palace, a hundred *zhang* above the ground, seated in midair, reciting scriptures. The king’s family and attendants, young and old, wept in sorrow, sighing without end. They offered all the kingdom’s treasures in alms. Over thirty people then surrendered their lives. The fox king proclaimed: "Those who give their lives are the highest of beings." Suddenly, a fierce wind arose, and the corpses and treasures were all seized, taken to the fox den, where they feasted on human flesh. The fox then sent its young, transformed into human form, bearing treasures to the marketplace. Among the butchers’ stalls, fierce dogs fought over bones, startling the fox cubs. Unaware, they reverted to their true forms, and the dogs tore them apart. The butchers, terrified, reported this to the market officials, who informed the province. The province then memorialized the king. Seeing the treasures, the king recognized them all. He said: "These were all offered to the sacred Dao—how did they fall into the hands of wild foxes?" At that time, a great minister named Xianling addressed the king: "The teachings you heard earlier were the work of fox spirits. Though they recited the words, they did not understand their meaning. They urged others to do good, but their hearts and words were at odds. Their flight before the palace revealed their falsity." The king asked: "What can be done about this mistake?" Xianling replied: "Gather the troops and surround those hills." The foxes then transformed into human form, bowing to the king. When fierce dogs approached, they reverted to wild foxes, and the dogs tore them apart. The king ordered his ministers to excavate the fox dens, where they recovered the stolen goods. Thus, one knows that without profound wisdom, a king may be deluded by the heterodox.

Third, if one hears the great but awakens to the small, one enters the coarse. As the *Shengxuan Jing* states: Dao Ling asked, "Among the multitude, those of minor practice are many, while those of great aspiration are few. If we do not expound the teachings, there will be no means for awakening. Yet if we teach the great Dao, we may encounter those of small capacity; if we teach the lesser vehicle, we may obstruct those of great practice." The Heavenly Worthy replied: "This is not difficult. The capacity lies in the conditions of the request, not in their number. Those who request with small conditions shall be taught the small; those who request with great conditions shall be taught the great. Yet their awakening and entry are also without constancy—some hear the small and awaken to the small, some hear the small and awaken to the great, some hear the great and awaken to the great, and some hear the great yet regress to the small. Formerly, there were over eight thousand four hundred good men and women who, though they understood and believed, clung to the pursuit of the supreme Dao. They harbored the mind of attainment, seeking the thought of non-attainment, and rigidly adhered to the great vehicle. Yet their efforts bore no fruit, and after more than four thousand years, they attained only the rank of earth immortals."

Fourth, if one hears the small but awakens to the great, one enters the wondrous. The *Shengxuan Jing* states: The Heavenly Worthy said, "When I first expounded the Dao in the Great Fuli Kingdom of the Beginning Azure Heaven, there was an earth immortal surnamed Hong, named Faqi, who, for the sake of teaching, requested that I open and expound the teachings. Observing his capacity, I deemed him unready for the great Dao and, following his mind, taught the Three Mixed Sutras. At that time, among the countless assembly, there were over one hundred eighty-six thousand who, upon hearing the lesser vehicle, deeply awakened to the great Dao, instantly transcended the Three Realms, and swiftly departed the Dao realm."

Fifth, if one advances from the heart and spontaneously generates the vow. The *Benji Jing* states: "If there are those who praise and expound the wondrous meaning, one should praise and extol their merit and virtue, lest external demons disrupt and disturb their work." It further states: "When explaining the meaning and purport, do not allow the Dharma master to encounter obstructions. Provide for their needs with clarity, supplying what they lack, so that the wondrous teachings may surely circulate." The *Benxiang Jing* states: "When the Heavenly Worthy expounded the Dao, eighty-four thousand in the assembly opened their minds and understood, generating the mind of the unsurpassed true and correct Dao without retrogression. They instantly eliminated seventy-two knots and a hundred kinds of afflictions." It further states: "There was a son of a elder named Falong, who, with faith, understanding, and reverence, led seven hundred twenty thousand to devote their minds to the true emptiness of the supreme Dao." The *Zhenzang Jing* states: "When the Heavenly Worthy expounded the Dao, three youths each generated distinct vows: the first, Huili, vowed to cultivate and practice; the second, Baoming, vowed to expound the sutras; the third, Shanji, vowed to study the Dao." The sutra states: "Huili and his retinue all vowed, saying, 'We shall cultivate the great vehicle without retrogression, comprehend the nature of all dharmas, reach their ultimate limit, awaken to the great vehicle, and accomplish the supreme Dao.'" "Baoming generated the vast vow, saying, 'I shall expound the great vehicle Dharma, vowing to ferry sentient beings to the place of liberation and accomplish the supreme Dao.'" "Shanji, with heroic vigor and diligence, generated the vast vow, saying, 'I shall study the great vehicle Dao, cultivate the Four Great Cities, vanquish the five rebellious thieves, expel the seven delusive demons, slay the ten obstructive maras, cleave the darkness of ignorance, carve out the hearts of the three thieves, and remain steadfast and unyielding.'" It further states: "There were great disciples who cultivated, recited, and expounded the revered sutras, generating faith and practicing without negligence. One should know that such persons, in the presence of all the worthies, perform meritorious deeds and plant fields of blessing. For immeasurable kalpas, they have revered the great vehicle of their teachers. Now, encountering these sutras, they generate faith."

Sixth, if one retreats from the heart and thereby incurs transgression. The *Shengxuan Jing* states: "There were eight hundred seventy-two persons who, upon hearing the great vehicle, included eight men and eleven women who generated disbelief and withdrew from their seats. They were deluded by heavenly maras and heterodox paths, their minds confused. These individuals immediately fell gravely ill, their hair and body hair falling out. They died and entered the Three Wretched Realms, being born deaf and blind. Even if they possessed ears and eyes, they would only speak of goodness and praise, never perceiving or hearing anything." One should know that the depth or shallowness of awakening to the Dharma arises entirely from the mind. These various conditions sufficiently demonstrate and confirm this.

There are four conditions for receiving and upholding the *Chao*:
Though the sutra texts speak of emptiness and existence, without cultivation, they cannot be accomplished. If one cultivates and upholds them, one must be true and steadfast, aligning one’s practice with the rules and standards. As one ascends through the Dao ranks, those who defile or disdain the numinous texts shall clearly incur punishment.

First, the condition of reading and recitation.
The *Siji Mingke* states: "When reciting the sutras, one must ensure that words and phrases connect without omission or skipping. If one loses a single sentence in the celestial sound, one must recite a hundred more words; if one loses two sentences, two hundred more; if one loses five sentences, five hundred more. If one initially loses a sentence while reciting, one must recite an entire section to compensate. Upon the thirtieth infraction, one shall undergo the punishment of the Mountain of Knives." It further states: "When reciting the sutras, one must fix one’s gaze on the text and concentrate the mind on the divine truth. One must not, while facing the sutra, entertain other thoughts or distracting notions, thereby disrupting the celestial sound. Upon the thirtieth infraction, one shall undergo the punishment of the Mountain of Knives." It further states: "When reciting fewer than a thousand words, one must not drink while facing the sutra. From a thousand to five thousand words, one may drink once; from five thousand to ten thousand words, twice; above ten thousand words, thrice. Upon the thirtieth infraction, one shall incur the punishment of the left official. If one recites up to ten thousand words and becomes mentally fatigued or qi-exhausted, one may pause to rest, then resume and complete the section. However, one must not leave unfinished sentences overnight. Upon the tenth infraction, one shall die and enter hell." "When reciting the sutras, if good men and women wish to listen, men should stand to the left and women to the right, with distinct positions for east and west, and separate places for Daoists and laity. Men and women must not be mixed or disorderly, nor share the same bed or seat."

Monks must follow behind those who have left the household and may not walk ahead; violations shall incur the punishment of the left official. The *Xuandu Precepts* states: "If one discusses worldly affairs while reciting the sutras, three *sheng* of oil shall be forfeited as penalty." It further says: "If one’s recitation becomes disordered and one asks to clarify a corrupted passage, five *sheng* of oil shall be forfeited." The *Qingwen Xia* states: "Recite the sutras as if facing the Most High. One must not act arrogantly, laugh frivolously, or discuss vulgar matters of worldly honor and profit. The attendant immortal youths shall report one’s name to the Three Heavens’ Rectifiers, who will memorialize the Most High thrice. If this occurs, you shall surely lose the sutras, and ghosts and spirits will torment you with chaotic punishments. You shall not die a natural death—how then can you attain immortality?"

It further states: "If one receives the sutras without a master’s transmission, the attendant immortal youths shall constantly oversee one’s punishments, and calamity shall extend to seven generations." The *Golden Register Simplified Text* says: "When the senior monk recites the sutras, he shall bow once to the scripture master, the register master, and the preceptor, while the rest shall follow the usual procedures. All shall do so upon first ascending the seat; after one recitation, if the sutras are recited again, the initial rites need not be repeated, but they shall be performed once more the following day. During recitation, one must not converse with those of lower rank. If a passage is left unfinished, one may not pause midway; if one does pause, one must restart from the beginning. After five hundred words, one may drink clear water or swallow saliva."

This differs slightly from the *Four Poles Alliance Regulations*. The *Alliance Regulations* state: "After ten thousand words, one may pause and resume from where one left off," which seems more lenient, whereas this text is entirely strict.

During recitation, one must maintain focused mindfulness and observe the precepts to elicit spiritual responses. The *Original Boundary Sutra* states: "If one recites and practices this sutra diligently day and night, wherever one resides shall naturally be peaceful and joyful. Wherever one is reborn, one shall dwell in a pure land." It further says: "If one receives, upholds, delights in, and recites even a single verse of this sutra, in that very moment, one shall eradicate immeasurable and boundless karmic afflictions from past lives. It is like a room filled with darkness for ages—with a single thought, the light of a lamp dispels all darkness. If one enters the great sea and encounters fierce winds, reciting this sutra shall calm the waves. If one enters mountains and forests and meets poisonous insects or ferocious beasts, reciting this sutra shall make them retreat. If one encounters bandits or enemies, reciting this sutra shall dissolve enmity. If one is in fear, reciting this sutra shall dispel ghosts and demons. Know that with a serene mind and focused recitation, nothing shall fail to be accomplished."

The Great Brahmā King, facing a great drought in his kingdom, invited the revered sutras and thereby ended the disaster. A king afflicted with many troubles, his kingdom beset by obstacles, invited the revered sutras, and his illnesses and delusions were swiftly cured. Know that the sutras possess spiritual power, and recitation shall surely bring response.

The *Supreme Ultimate Hidden Commentary* states: "When reciting the *Daode Jing*, thirty-six thousand immortal youths and jade maidens shall attend, burning incense, scattering flowers, and summoning the assembled immortals." It further says: "After reciting the *Daode Jing* ten thousand times, a cloud chariot shall descend to welcome you. If it does not come, recite it thrice in a month, and it shall surely arrive." The *True Treasury Sutra* states: "Once, the Jade Seal Youth burned incense and recited this sutra. Suddenly, immortal youths and jade maidens filled the sky, arriving all at once to burn rare incense and praise the sacred text, astonishing the entire kingdom. The Jade Seal Youth remained unperturbed. Today, in households holding purification rites, though the reciter may possess the finest voice and diction, those seated below often fail to focus their minds. Some chatter incessantly, whispering to one another; others vie for sensual pleasures or compete for wealth. The great virtuous ones recline in slumber, heads bowed in arrogance. If those above cannot uphold rectitude, how can those below be reverent? First, this breaches proper decorum; second, it fails to inspire faith; third, it invites the host’s disdain; fourth, it brings divine punishment upon oneself. One must reflect deeply—better to earnestly admonish the virtuous. If one can encourage the assembly to diligence, what cause is there for concern? If one neglects mutual exhortation, one extinguishes the Dao and its teachings."

**Second: The Benefits of Listening to Sutra Recitation**
The *Natural Scripture Formula* states: "When listeners reach a passage in the sutra, they should bow in their hearts and make vows with sincere devotion, and they shall surely receive a response." The *Xuandu Precepts* states: "If one listens to the sutras while leaning or sitting improperly, one shall forfeit one *sheng* of oil. If one’s mind is not focused on purity and emptiness, or if one’s thoughts wander and one appears weary to others, three *sheng* of oil shall be forfeited. If one listens with a concentrated mind, it is no different from receiving and upholding the sutras oneself." The *Original Boundary Sutra* states: "If one listens to this sutra with a single-minded, upright focus, rejoicing and leaping with delight, savoring its meaning and forgetting sleep and food, unaware of the passage of time, know that this person has encountered it in past lives. Though temporarily born in the lower realms, they are entrusted with wisdom in the human world. Before long, they shall ascend as immortals and ultimately attain the Dao."

**Third: The Conditions for Making Offerings to Those Who Uphold the Sutras**
The *True Treasury Sutra* states: "The Heavenly Worthy asked the Youth of Good Clarity: 'If one gives away gold, jade, and precious treasures, is this person’s merit great?' The youth replied: 'The merit is rare, yet it does not compare to the merit of expounding, transcribing, receiving, upholding, and making offerings to this sutra, which surpasses the former by a hundred thousand million times. This sutra is called the City of Dharma Power, the Benevolent Protector of All Beings, the Remover of Delusions and Obstacles.'"

The *Original Boundary Sutra* states: "If one gives away family wealth, or even sells wife and children to purchase fragrant oils, various ritual implements, and vegetarian meals to offer and provide for those who uphold this sutra, the merit thus obtained is immeasurable. Why? Because this person can accomplish the merit of the Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions and give birth to all the sages."

Thus the *Scripture of Ascending the Mystery* states: "The merit of making offerings to those who uphold the sutra is comparable, followed by providing fragrant oils and lamps, and presenting banners and flowers."

The *Original Boundary Sutra* states: "If a king or commoner offers this sutra with palace halls, canopied seats, jeweled parasols, banners, incense, flowers, lamps, and candles, then you, the four assemblies, along with the Heavenly Emperors, the Three and Five Officials, the celestial dragons, spirits, ghosts, vajra warriors, and the true attendants of the sutra, should lead your retinues to follow, revere, and make offerings, protecting their lands and safeguarding their people."

The *Scripture of Fundamental Conduct* states: "Formerly, there was a woman who received and upheld this sutra, reciting it morning and evening. Her husband constantly provided incense and offerings. The wife then ascended to heaven and was titled the Primordial Sovereign of Pure Conduct. After the husband’s life ended, the sutra entered the great mountains. When he fully recounted the merit of his support, the wife came and bestowed the sutra upon him. He then ascended to the Southern Palace, and after a hundred years, was reborn into a royal family, where he greatly received the sutra’s teachings and became a True Person of the Nine Palaces.

There was also a worthy gentleman who upheld this sutra, but his wife, begrudging and unwilling to share with her husband, caused him to ascend to heaven alone. Later, she transformed into a starving vulture. Through his transformative guidance, she regained a female form, received and upheld the sutra’s teachings, and is now the Empress Consort of the Primordial Sovereign of the Southern Culmen.

Know this: upholding the sutra and revering the Dharma is clearly not in vain. To slander and scorn it is to invite one’s own punishment."

The *Fourfold Luminous Sutra on the Causes of Slandering the Dharma* states: The *True Treasury Sutra* says: "Beings who do not believe in the Dharma slander it and extinguish it. They do not believe that the Three Treasures exist within the roots of faith, nor that past and future are real. They do not believe the Great Vehicle is the foundation, nor that beings are equal in nature to the Heavenly Worthies. They do not believe that all dharmas are quiescent and rootless, without cause or effect, nor that beings have accumulated seeds from immeasurable kalpas, formless yet without birth or extinction. Such disbelief is called destroying the Dharma, extinguishing the Dharma. The Dharma cannot be extinguished, but obstructing and failing to perceive it is called extinguishing the Dharma. Having extinguished the Dharma, one obtains a bodily form, entering samsara without end, inevitably falling into hell with no chance of escape."

The *Scripture of Fundamental Marks* states: "If one regards the sutra as mere dirt or grass, utterly lacking reverence, or sees others practicing goodness and mocks them behind their backs, never offering support or respect—such a person comes from the six paths of rebirth, having only just attained human form, and thus does not believe in the Dharma."

The *True Treasury Sutra* states: "In a past kalpa, there were five impoverished men who did not believe in the sutra’s teachings, nor that beings possess the true nature of the Dao, nor that beings are the wondrous Dharma of the sutra, nor that beings are unborn and undying, nor that the minds of beings are vast as the sea, nor that beings are the gathering of the Great Void. Due to such disbelief, they contracted grave illness, entering the Dark Prison in life, in death, in eating, and in breathing. All good men and women should each reflect: do not give rise to disbelief."

The Heavenly Worthy then composed a verse:
*"Those who do not believe in the Dharma,
Slander the virtuous and good.
In death, they receive the retribution of Fengdu,
Their forms shattered on the sword trees.
For ten thousand kalpas, no end to their release,
Their souls and spirits ache with broken bowels.
Their cries resound without cease,
As hell-wardens boil them in cauldrons.
Suffering without respite,
Eyes glaring in all directions.
Who could endure such torment?
Deluded and recklessly wild.
I exhort the cultivators of truth:
Cultivate blessings to forever avoid calamity."*

Yet the words of the sages are fundamentally not false or exaggerated. It is disbelief in the Dharma that brings calamity upon oneself. If one further claims that the sutra is attended by eighteen thousand jade maidens and jade youths, disbelief only deepens. Some expose it carelessly, mix it with secular texts, fail to cleanse their mouths or hands, or neglect protective purity—any deviation from the proper ritual of reciting the sutra is called slander.

The *Lower Inquiry* states: "If the sutra is defiled and not cleansed with fragrant water, the hun and po souls will scatter and fall."

The *Original Boundary Sutra* states: "If anyone slanders this sutra, harboring disbelief, scorning the Dharma treasure, and doubting or destroying the sacred texts—know that such a person has for immeasurable kalpas sunk into the lower realms of ghosts, enduring all manner of suffering and passing through countless forms before barely regaining human birth. Yet they remain foolish and obstinate, understanding nothing, habituated to evil causes, unable to believe or accept. Their actions are unwholesome, every move a source of sin. Turning from the correct to the perverse, forsaking truth for worldliness, the Three Offices and Nine Bureaus record their deeds in the ledgers of transgressions, inscribing their names in the Black Register of the Dead. Some in this very life are constantly beset by suffering; others violate royal laws, arrested and beaten with whips."

Or they may suffer from afflictions of malignant winds and leprous infestations, beset by cares, distress, and hardship, impoverished and destitute. Or they may be deluded and confounded by external demons and heterodox ways, their minds still bound to the worldly realm, spurned and scorned by others. Wherever they wander, they encounter no favorable conditions; once they lose the human Way, they forever stray from the domain of the worthy. At death, they descend into hell, with no prospect of return, enduring retribution in dark prisons, bound fast behind heavy bars. Day and night they are tortured, never beholding the Three Luminaries. Some embrace the bronze pillar, their bodies charred and scorched; others ascend the mountain of knives, their pain and poison unbearable. In the endless night of darkness, they remain trapped for ten thousand kalpas, with no escape. Even if they are reborn, they return as beasts or non-human beings, forever losing the human Way.

In summary, the causes and conditions of the scriptural Dharma are thus exhausted. When opening and reciting this sutra, examine it closely.

*Essential Rituals and Precepts: Wondrous Scrolls, Volume Two* concludes.
*Essential Rituals and Precepts: Annotated Excerpts, Volume Three* begins.
Compiled by Daoist Zhu Faman of the Three Caverns.

**Statutes state:** When laypeople receive registers, though they may not yet be familiar with the statutes and methods, they come to inquire about their doubts. Answer truthfully according to your understanding; do not deceive or falsely claim ignorance. You must admonish evil and return to goodness, encourage right and eliminate wrong. Do not form cliques, act for private gain, harm the Dharma, or mislead yourself and others.

**The Statutes of the Nine Punishments state:** High-virtue Daoists, Grand Masters of Rites, and the Eighty-One Worthies—when they purify themselves and ascend the altar, the altar being the Hall of Lofty Emptiness, the Altar of the August Spirits—need not receive the Dharma or registers to transmit registers and rites. Only the Twenty-Four Scrolls, containing the subtle and essential words, the Three Caverns’ treasure scriptures, and all secret talismans and taboo names, must be received from a master. The master must be one who has fully received the teachings as a Daoist disciple, a person of abundant virtue. Even the descendants of the Celestial Master, though they may be masters, must observe the rites of disciples. When the descendants of the Celestial Master receive the various Dharmas, the ritual fees must follow the common people’s standards and may not be omitted; omission will incur no mercy from the Three Offices.

**Statutes state:** Those who receive various contracts and natural contracts, then transmit contracts without possessing the scriptures, are false and deceitful masters. Contracts originate from the scriptures of deliverance; without scriptures, what contract can there be? A master must copy the scriptures and take vows before becoming a master. Those who have not yet reached the required years may not serve as masters; they should seek a fully qualified master for their former disciples. Those who are not fully qualified may temporarily receive disciples, with the goal of becoming fully qualified. There is no limit to the number of masters, nor restrictions on their gender. Masters may not imprison their disciples or prevent them from betraying their original master. Those who betray their master will endure the tenfold torments of suffering and be reborn among the six kinds of beasts. Those who imprison their disciples will be bound in dark prisons and later reborn in remote borderlands. Let the foolish and ignorant take heed.

**Statutes state:** The treasure scriptures are of utmost importance, appearing but once in ten thousand kalpas. As the fortunes of heaven and earth hasten, the worthy are needed to assist the correct. Transmission is permitted once every seven hundred years. If one has the proper karmic affinity, the scriptures may be transmitted after seven years; within three years, there will be no disasters or hardships. After four years, transmission may proceed. If transmitted to the right person, both teacher and disciple share in the blessing; if transmitted to the wrong person, both share the same sin, together enduring the punishments of fire, water, wind, knives, and the labor of carrying stones for ten thousand kalpas.

**Statutes state:** In all matters concerning the master, act as if holding an object with both hands at heart level, taking care not to drop or lose it. The master is like a father. Yet in serving the Dao and attending the master, there are two kinds of people: one is nominal, the other substantive. Those who merely claim affiliation with the master’s gate, without cultivating wondrous principles, great merit, or non-action, encounter obstacles everywhere. They generate afflictions and birth-and-death, unable to know the constant. Their reckless actions lead to misfortune—this is nominal service to the master. But those who wholeheartedly rely on the master, whose every action accords with the Dharma, who establish vast fields of merit, deliver themselves and others, act without acting yet accomplish all, wherever they go enjoy unimpeded benefit, free from all obstacles, attain immortality and deathlessness, and forever enjoy purity and good fortune—this is substantive service to the master.

**Statutes state:** When the master speaks to disciples, they address one another as “I,” “we,” “you,” and “disciples,” for they are as close as family. In all matters concerning the master’s gate, outwardly one is called “disciple,” inwardly one is called by name, not by surname. The master’s master is treated as a patriarch; the patriarch’s master is treated as a great-grandfather; the great-grandfather’s master is treated as a great-great-grandfather; the great-great-grandfather’s master is called the ancestral master. From the ancestral master to the disciple’s own body constitutes five generations. Pay reverence to the patriarch with a single bow and inquire after his well-being. In written correspondence, address all as “disciple,” never using disrespectful language. Violations incur the penalties of the Seven Punishments.

**Statutes state:** Treat those who have preceded you in attainment as you would your master. Those who are capable of being masters are called “masters of the heart.” When paying respects, if all the masters are present, first bow to the ancestral master, then inquire after the well-being of the patriarch, then the register master, and then the preceptor.

**Statutes state:** In all formal correspondence and memorials, disciples must write in standard script, never in cursive. Violations incur the penalties of the Five Punishments. Daoists must always defer to those who have preceded them in attainment, standing one step below their master.

**Precepts state:** When disciples pay respects to their master, they must do so in court dress on the first and fifteenth of each month. They may not speak duplicitously, harboring private thoughts while uttering public words, or speak inconsistently behind their master’s back.

**Precepts state:** When Daoist disciples and their master set an appointment, failing to keep it binds their souls and confines them under the jurisdiction of the Water Office for fifty days of labor.

**Precepts state:** If disciples show disrespect to their master, behaving irreverently and without propriety, addressing their master with familiar pronouns like “I” and “you,” their souls will be detained and confined by the Water Office for sixty days. After the punishment is completed, their lifespan will be reduced by twenty-four years.

**Precepts state:** Disciples must serve their master with the same reverence they show their parents; the master must regard disciples with the same care as for their own children. Violations incur a penalty of twelve years’ reduction in lifespan for each party.

**Precepts state:** In the Orthodox Unity tradition, the three masters are: the first is the proper master, the second is the Celestial Master, and the third is the preceptor. The registers of the Three and Five Offices are equivalent to the three masters and must be equally revered. Violations incur thirty lashes of punishment.

**Precepts state:** When disciples write to their master, they must begin with a formal address, using their full name, and may not behave disrespectfully. Violations incur fifteen strokes of the rod.

**Precepts state:** When Daoist followers speak with their master, they must address themselves as "Daoist follower" and may not use their personal name. Violations incur ten strokes of punishment.

**Precepts state:** If a disciple parts from their master for a month, they must bow three times on the last day of the month, the first day of the new moon, and the three auspicious days of the Three Origins. If the master is not seen on these days, the disciple must still perform the bows. Violations incur ten strokes of punishment for the master; if the disciple is gravely ill for twenty days, the penalty is doubled.

**Precepts state:** Those of the same seven generations may not serve as master and disciple to one another; if they do, their lifespan is reduced by three twelve-year cycles. Yet this precept exists lest a disciple’s transgressions implicate their nine generations of ancestors and extend to the master’s forebears. If a disciple remains loyal and unblemished by the Seven Precepts, their virtue aligning with the Ten Practices and their bone structure matching the celestial charts, even a father may transmit the Dao to his son, enabling all nine generations to ascend as immortals—how then could they incur the penalty of reduced lifespan?

**Precepts state:** If a disciple learns of their master’s illness, distress, poverty, or hardship and fails to respond with a pained heart, they lack benevolence and filial piety, violating their oath. This incurs fifty days of punishment; if the master is gravely ill, one hundred days.

**Precepts state:** Daoists may not, in the presence of another’s disciples, speak ill of or curse that disciple’s master or elders. All discussions must remain impartial; if they speak of good and evil, the soul and spirit within the body will depart. Violations incur fifty days of illness under the scrutiny of the Water Office.

**Precepts state:** If a disciple speaks ill of their master or parents in the presence of others, the celestial officials within their body will report this to the Heavenly Bureau, incurring one hundred days of illness and thirty days of punishment.

**Precepts state:** Upon receiving a letter from their master, disciples must burn incense, hold their tablet, adjust their robes and headdress, bow three times, and then open and read the letter. This is how one reveres the exalted sages, propagates the Dao, and fulfills filial piety—thus aligning with the hearts of the ancient worthies. Violations incur a penalty of one twelve-year cycle in lifespan.

**Precepts state:** If a disciple parts from their master for less than a month, they must wear their headdress, hold their tablet, and greet the master upon return, not appearing in plain clothes. Violations incur a penalty of three *dou* of oil; refusal to comply results in twenty strokes of the rod.

**Precepts state:** If a disciple parts from their master for more than one night but fewer than five, they must adjust their robes, hold their tablet, bow twice, and greet the master according to ritual upon return. Violations incur a penalty of five *liang* of incense, to be offered to the Three Treasures.

Disciples must address their master by name. When visiting their master, they may not sit without permission; they must wait for the master’s command. Violations incur ten days of illness.

**Precepts state:** Disciples may not address their master as "Daoist" but must refer to them as "my master," "harmonious master," "great master," "revered master," or "master." Violations incur a penalty of three *dou* of oil, to be offered to the Three Treasures, and ten days of illness.

Disciples may not violate the master’s name taboos. If a senior figure questions them insistently, they must respond softly with their name. Violations incur a penalty of one twelve-year cycle in lifespan.

Disciples may not act rudely toward those at the master’s side, for attendant spirits observe and scrutinize. Violations incur a penalty of one twelve-year cycle in lifespan.

If a disciple witnesses the master’s faults, they must kneel in a secluded place, hands clasped respectfully, and offer remonstrance. They may not speak of the master’s errors or shameful matters in the presence of others. Violations incur a penalty of one twelve-year cycle in lifespan.

When sharing a room with their master, disciples may not lie down before the master or rise after them. Violations incur fifty days of illness.

When eating with their master, disciples may not begin before the master; they must always follow the master’s lead. If the master commands them to eat first, the disciple may do so but must stop when the master does.

In all matters of daily life, movement, travel, and conduct, disciples must remain humble, reverent, and respectful toward their master, never lapsing in propriety for even a moment. Violations incur thirty strokes of punishment.

If a disciple serves a master younger than themselves, they must still show reverence, treating the master as they would an official of two thousand *shi* or their own parents. They may not rely on their seniority to slight the master. Violations incur eighty strokes of the rod; the master must discipline the disciple accordingly.

When seated with their master, if the master rises, moves, or departs, the disciple must rise and step aside, not remaining seated in composure. Violations incur thirty strokes of punishment.

If a disciple has not yet received the precepts and rituals, or if they are of advanced age or similar disposition, and later seeks the master’s teachings, they must still serve as a disciple, addressing the master by name with reverence, not as before. Violations incur forty strokes of punishment.

If a disciple shares the same surname or clan as the master, or is related as cousin, nephew, or grandnephew, and later seeks the master’s teachings, they must still remain humble and reverent, addressing the master by name, not as an ordinary acquaintance. Violations incur forty strokes of the rod; the master must discipline the disciple accordingly.

Those related to the master within the fifth degree of mourning may not serve as master and disciple. This is because the transmission of the Dao involves witnessing the salvation of three generations of ancestors and seven generations of forebears, binding the disciple’s descendants to the covenant. If the covenant is violated, the nine generations of ancestors will be punished, and the disciple will suffer one hundred days of illness.

Disciples may not harbor anger, resentment, or hatred toward their master, nor hold grudges in their heart. Violations incur thirty strokes of punishment.

When seeking the Dao and its teachings from their master, disciples must wear their headdress, hold their tablet, and humbly entreat, not acting presumptuously. Violations incur forty strokes of punishment.

Disciples may not argue with their master. Violations incur forty strokes of punishment.

When serving their master, if the master returns from a journey, the disciple must greet them along the way, regardless of distance, and may not remain seated in composure awaiting the master’s arrival. Violations incur forty strokes of punishment.

When walking with their master, disciples may not step on the master’s shadow. Violations incur thirty strokes of punishment.

In all matters of coming and going, and in all actions, disciples must first report to and seek the master’s approval; they may not act on their own authority. Violations incur fifty strokes of punishment.

When serving their master, disciples must remain sincere and unwavering, not harboring doubt or divided loyalty. Violations incur thirty strokes of punishment.

Disciples may not steal, reveal, or misuse the master’s utensils, containers, money, belongings, food, or prohibited teachings and precepts.

Violations incur thirty strokes of punishment.

When seated with their master, disciples may not spit or soil the surroundings. Violations incur twenty strokes of punishment.

When attending their master in the presence of guests, disciples must stand guard at the master’s side and may not arrogantly occupy a grand seat as though no different from commoners. Violations incur seventy strokes of punishment.

After receiving the master’s teachings and achieving moral accomplishment, should disciples be revered by others, they must remain humble and ever mindful of the master’s grace, never forgetting their debt. Violations incur a penalty of two twelve-year cycles.

The precepts state: Daoist priests and nuns, though advanced in years, if their attainment in the Dao and precepts is inferior, may not precede those of lesser age but greater mastery in the Way. Those younger in years but superior in precept and discipline may proceed first; this order must not be disrupted. Violations incur sixty strokes of punishment.

The regulations state: When eminent masters reside together, should a cunning disciple seek refuge—whether out of lingering attachment or coercion—they must be instructed with discernment. Some may first be assigned arduous tasks, others enticed with sweet words; some may be left to sit in oblivion, others banished afar; some may be granted scriptural treasures or teachings, others ordered to fast and purify themselves; or, fearing their own authority, the master may delegate others to soothe and receive them. If, despite all efforts, the disciple remains incorrigible and shows no sign of improvement, keeping such a disciple will extinguish the Dao and its teachings; they must be permanently cast out.

The regulations state: Should a disciple delight in the true Dharma, deeply comprehend the profound sutras, and earnestly desire to hear more, yet their capacity is hindered by past karma or dull faculties, such good intentions must be nurtured. They should be comforted with the Three Refuges and Five Precepts, guided toward tranquility, and settled in mind. Eminent Dharma masters, as the refuge of all beings, must adapt to each disposition: those of haughty nature must be humbled; the obstinate must be subdued; the timid must be encouraged toward courage. As parents to all beings, how could they not act with wisdom? Only thus may the disciple align with the Dao and never regress.

The regulations state: Shangqing masters may not administer the Great Precepts, accept disciples as dependents, take on disciples, instruct others, engage in evaluating worldly affairs, travel alone after midnight, or associate with heterodox views. Their every action must accord with the Dharma.

The regulations state: Disciples under one’s care must be reproved all the more sternly. For grave transgressions, they must be rebuked with five admonitions: first, “I now reprove you; you must leave”; second, “After you depart, do not enter my chamber”; third, “Even if I am alone, I shall not employ you in service”;

Fourth, "While I live, do not come near my dwelling"; fifth, "Though I may guide and transform beings of the three wretched paths and five destinies, I shall never speak with you again." Such reproofs and subduing measures are already severe in practice—no further excess is needed. Unlawful punishments such as beating with canes, cangues, or rods, hanging by the neck, binding in reverse, or day-and-night scolding and abuse are not found in the precepts and harm the seed of great compassion.

Should a master command a disciple to buy wine or meat, engage in trade, tend cattle or horses, or commit acts of sexual misconduct, the disciple may say, "Such deeds are not the conduct of the Heavenly Worthy; I dare not comply." If the master grows angry and reproves them, the disciple must depart.

The regulations state: Disciples of evil conduct who show no remorse exhibit ten traits: first, shamefulness in wrongdoing; second, failure to cultivate goodness; third, defiance when admonished; fourth, lack of dignified bearing; fifth, arrogance and pride without reverence; sixth, laziness and cruelty; seventh, association with the unfaithful; eighth, indulgence in licentiousness; ninth, delight in slaughter; tenth, drunkenness that disrupts hierarchy. Those who bear these ten traits destroy the Dharma. If one refrains from evil, endures hardship with humility, enters the chamber at dawn to remove the urinal, and pays respects at morning, noon, and dusk—seeking instruction and obeying commands without shirking labor—then gradually they will fill the great vessel, accumulate virtue, and attain perfection. Such disciples uphold and propagate the true Dharma, and are widely praised.

The regulations state: Male and female officials may each take refuge under their own kind—male officials under male officials, female officials under female officials—with the most accomplished in the Dharma serving as master. Every ten days, they must visit the master to receive instruction. At the appointed time, they shall don their ritual robes, compose their minds with sincerity, and proceed with reverence and solemnity directly to the master’s door, without glancing east or west. Upon arrival, they announce, "This disciple [name] comes to pay respects."

Once the master is prepared, they don the proper attire, burn incense in the sutra-recitation chamber, and summon the disciple to enter. Approaching the master, the disciple performs three measured bows and inquires, "Has the master’s well-being been peaceful of late? Has your virtue remained harmonious?" If the master is without affliction, they reply, "Lately, my recitations have not faltered." If illness or distress is present, the response shall address the matter accordingly.

Should the disciple have committed an offense, the master shall first address it privately, saying, "You have done such-and-such; let my admonition guide your reform." The disciple bows in gratitude and replies, "My lack of discipline has troubled the master’s correction." Bowing again, they vow, "From this day forward, I shall not repeat this transgression." If the meeting occurs before a fast, the fast is observed; afterward, no further arrangements are made, and the disciple departs with two bows, saying, "May the master cherish their well-being."

The master offers final counsel: "Wherever you reside, diligently observe fasts and precepts, guard yourself with care, and never indulge in arrogance." The disciple responds, "Indeed," and retreats three steps before turning away. They may not enter another chamber but must return directly to their own abode and share the master’s admonitions with all, great and small, without concealment.

If a female official lacks the highest Dharma or cannot transmit the teachings, she may seek instruction from a male official. Likewise, female officials of great virtue may invite male officials to receive the Dharma, and the protocols for posture and demeanor apply equally to both male and female officials.

The regulations state: When a master of great virtue returns from afar, they shall send an attendant ahead to the abode to announce their arrival. Disciples must then don their robes and go forth to welcome them, observing proper order among all, without neglecting courtesy or leaving others unprepared.

The regulations state: When a disciple wishes to address the master, a fellow abode-dweller, or a senior from another abode, they must don their robes and approach the chamber. If the door is closed, they shall lightly tap it three times with a bent finger. If no response comes after a brief pause, they tap three more times; if still unanswered, they tap three more times. If silence persists, they must withdraw.

The regulations state: In the disciple’s duties, when the master receives guests, they shall dust the bedding and mats, sweep the area before and behind, and await the master’s command before summoning the guest to enter.

The regulations state: When the master passes an object to a disciple, if the master stands, the disciple stands to receive it; if the master sits, the disciple kneels to receive it.

The regulations state: When visiting or attending the master or a senior of great virtue, the disciple shall bow twice and stand in attendance. If commanded to sit, they bow before doing so. If further matters are discussed, they rise to answer, standing upright with feet together and hands clasped.

The regulations state: When approaching the quarters of a venerable one, if aware they are within the room or storeroom, and no sound is heard, one shall clear the throat to announce their presence. If unacknowledged, they must withdraw; if acknowledged, they shall give their name and state their purpose. If bidden to enter, they enter; if the door is open, they open it; if closed, they leave it closed. Upon entering, they shall gaze directly at the venerable one, without casting sidelong glances.

The regulations state: Those who have left the household life must ever uphold loyalty and rectitude. In all movements and stillness, the Five Rectifications come first: first, rectify one’s own person; second, rectify one’s disciples and followers; third, rectify the noble and base within the abbey; fourth, rectify the dharma for distant assemblies; fifth, rectify the benighted among the laity.

One who can rectify their own person becomes a model for others and can then rectify their disciples, who will receive instruction with proper decorum. One who can rectify the abbey ensures that all, great and small, follow in harmony. One who can rectify the distant assemblies causes the dharma and its meaning to be proclaimed. One who can rectify the benighted laity widely increases wisdom and understanding. Those who can do thus are called Daoists.

If one’s person is not rectified, they become an object of aversion. If disciples are left untaught, they will despise their master and the abbey’s superiors. Without restraint or distinction, noble and base become confused, and trust and righteousness are forsaken. Distant assemblies will all come to loathe them. Deceiving and oppressing the ignorant, they increase the tally of transgressions. Unable to establish authority or grace, they instead entice the disciples, servants, or children of others—either to seize their possessions for themselves or to engage in clandestine dealings—failing to stand by the upright Way, ever conducting themselves with perversity.

Those of such character and reputation are fugitives from discipline and malefactors to be guarded against. If they cannot be corrected, the king’s law shall apply.

*Essential Rituals and Precepts of the Wondrous Scrolls, Fascicle Three, Concluded*
*Essential Rituals and Precepts, Notes on the Precepts, Fascicle Four*

Zhu Faman of the Three Caverns, a Daoist, compiled these one thousand one hundred precepts and vows in unison. The scriptures serve to restrain evil, while the precepts serve to prevent wrongdoing. Yet their branches and streams are so numerous that they are difficult to apply. Extracting their essentials makes them easier to seek.

*The Esoteric Instructions on Ascending to Perfection* states: "Precepts are the ford that blocks the path of filth and defilement, the barrier that prevents the comings and goings of perverse winds."

*The Regulations of the Thousand Perfected* says: "Those who leave the household life do not associate with the secular world, do not seek fame or profit, do not perform contrived meritorious deeds, but enter stillness and meditative concentration, subdue external demons, and are called ‘pure precepts’—the true and real Dharma Mother."

*The Great Precepts of Contemplating the Body* states: "To have scriptures without precepts is like wishing to cross the sea without a boat or oars, or to have a mouth without a tongue—how can one ferry across the countless beings?"

Scholars who do not seek the scriptures and precepts have not awakened to the root of the true essentials. To remain in a long dream without awakening is truly lamentable.

*The Regulations of the Thousand Perfected* says: "Those who leave the household life and uphold the Three Precepts, Five Precepts, Nine Precepts, Ten Precepts, or even the Three Hundred Great Precepts—within each single precept, there are twenty-four benevolent spirits who protect them, and heavenly beings who make offerings. They do not transgress the multitude of evils. Those who do not believe in the precepts transgress evils all the more, their sins binding them in the hidden darkness, where they receive suffering life after life, falling into blind paths. Whether one violates or upholds the precepts, the blessings gained or sins incurred are the same for both Daoists and laypeople—this principle is impartial, and its merit is equal."

*The Commentary on the Book of Changes* states: "Purifying the mind is called *zhai* (fasting); preventing harm is called *jie* (precepts)."

*The Origin of the Fundamental* says: "What the sages and perfected cultivate is necessarily called *teaching*. What ordinary people practice is called *habitual karma*. Teaching and karma are one and not two."

The so-called One Precept is the arising of the unsurpassed, natural Dao-mind. This is the right cause and the most fundamental root.

There are also Two Precepts, namely the Two Contemplations: *qi*-contemplation and spirit-contemplation, which are concentration and wisdom.

There are also Three Precepts, namely the Three Relinquishments: relinquishing body, life, and wealth.

There are also Four Precepts, namely the Four Entrustments of the Mind: kindness, love, goodness, and forbearance.

There are also Five Precepts, namely the Five Remembrances: contemplating the Dao, one attains purity; contemplating the Dao, one leaves all sensual desires; contemplating the Dao, one’s actions oppose the secular; contemplating the Dao, one has no prohibitions; contemplating the Dao, one transcends form and sound.

*Ascending to the Mystery* also speaks of Five Precepts: If one sees beautiful forms, glory, or splendid colors, one covers the eyes with precepts. If one hears good or bad words, or the five tones, one blocks the ears with precepts. If one encounters the eight delicacies or sweet and fragrant foods, one seals the mouth with precepts. If one covets wealth, the seven treasures, or rare jewels, indulging in extreme desires, one subdues the mind with precepts. If one recalls lewdness or pursues evil deeds, one breaks the feet with precepts. Those who can practice these five things will cause their seven generations of ancestors to be reborn in heaven.

There are also Six Precepts, namely the Six Perfections: diligence, faith, gentleness, perseverance, discernment of disputes, and abstention from wine and lust.

There are also Seven Precepts, namely the Seven Awakenings: knowing the One, knowing the Three, knowing misfortune, knowing fortune, knowing the secular, knowing the Dao, and knowing being and non-being.

There are also Eight Precepts, namely the Eight Abilities: to accept what is not one’s own without asserting oneself; to yield virtue to others; to not desire what others desire; to endure unreasonable demands without contention; to distance oneself from the unprincipled and hide in secluded places; to not reveal one’s mind; to not betray the scriptures and precepts; and to not boast with the mouth, closing off the six senses.

The Six Perfections give rise to the Six Penetrations and the Thirty-Eight Precepts, also called the Six Awakenings or the Six Wisdoms.

Closing off the six senses involves the following: The first precept is that the eyes do not wander, becoming distracted by various floral colors, which leads to the loss of essence and the dissipation of youthful vitality, causing the light to dim and not shine clearly. The second precept is that the ears do not listen indiscriminately, becoming confused by the five tones, which harms the spirit and corrupts integrity, allowing evil sounds and wailing to enter. The third precept is that the nose does not seek excessive fragrances, mixing with foul and rank odors, which easily leads to turbidity, causing the form to lose its clarity and uprightness. The fourth precept is that the mouth does not crave flavors, such as rich and greasy foods, which pollute the five spirits and cause the organs and viscera to become congested and burst. The fifth precept is that the hands do not commit evil, do not steal others’ belongings, or covet profit for oneself, lest calamity arise unawares. The sixth precept is that the mind does not indulge in desires, which disturb the five spirits, harm essence, and scatter *qi*, causing the body to become lost and confused. These six precepts are the great afflictions of the body.

The precepts born of the Six Perfections are as follows: The first is that when one sees someone in dire straits, one saves them from death, and when one sees someone of worldly prominence, one can restrain their perversity, leading to long life and boundless worldly blessings. The second is that when one sees someone impoverished, cold, hungry, or in distress, one sacrifices one’s own resources to bestow alms, making them wealthy and noble, with a myriad-fold karmic reward and joy life after life. The third is that when blood-bearing creatures seek refuge in distress, one can rescue and save them from deadly peril, leading to robust health in this life and avoidance of untimely misfortune. The fourth is that when one bestows kindness upon birds and beasts, or any living beings, cutting from one’s own mouth to feed them without惜, one will be sated life after life and always dwell in blessed lands. The fifth is that when one saves all creatures, including the smallest, enabling them all to thrive without premature death or harm, one will prosper in this life and avoid all misfortunes. The sixth is that when one constantly practices a mind of compassion, pitying and saving all beings, releasing life and delivering from death, the merit is profound, enabling one in this life to turn danger into safety, illness into health, poverty into wealth, and all aspirations to be fulfilled. These six precepts all arise from the mind’s penetration of wisdom, enabling one to bestow virtue and act in accordance with nature.

The Six Penetrations are as follows: Heaven is all-seeing, thus heavenly clarity and wisdom are lofty, with wisdom penetrating without end. From above and below, the four directions and eight quarters, nothing is not illuminated, nothing is not understood. Though called a single penetration of wisdom, it encompasses the five colors. Heaven’s penetration is natural, thus it is without harm.

Just as humans emulate Heaven, the crimson pupil of the eye likewise possesses the radiance of the five colors. If one does not uphold the precepts, the qi of the six senses will not flow through the human apertures, and wisdom will remain unopened. Gazing widely upon the five colors causes the eye’s spirit to scatter, its luminous essence to dim and obscure, leading to blindness. Thus this precept is established to deliver heavenly and earthly beings, enabling all men and women to hear the Dharma’s sound. Should one wish to transcend suffering and attain long life, one must uphold this precept, practice it diligently without forgetfulness, guard against wanton gazing, restrain the spirit of the eyes, and cherish and nurture the eye’s pupil. By contemplating the true and stilling the mind, one enables the penetration of wisdom, perceiving emptiness with clarity. Upholding the precepts to restrain oneself causes the five colors to return to the body; when the five colors naturally return, there is no harm or injury, and one’s years and life may be preserved without end.

The Heavenly Worthy said: Earth embodies penetrating hearing, its wisdom far-reaching and its wisdom all-hearing. Thus its resonance responds to Heaven above and pervades the four directions below, with nothing beyond its reach and nothing unheard. Though called a single penetration of wisdom, it encompasses the five tones. Earth’s penetration is natural, giving rise to the five tones, stable and unmoving, thus free from harm.

Just as humans emulate Earth, the ear contains the spirits of the five sounds. If one does not uphold the precepts, wisdom remains unopened. One must not recklessly listen to the sounds of the five tones, for they cause the five spirits to scatter, the ears to become hollow and desolate, filled with mournful roaring, the five spirits to weep, leading to deafness. Thus this precept is expounded to deliver heavenly and earthly beings, enabling all men and women to universally hear the Dharma’s sound. Should one desire longevity, one must uphold the great precepts to restrain the ear’s spirit, avoiding excessive listening to unwholesome sounds. By quietly listening to the wondrous sutras and the chapters of divine perfected ones, one enables the penetration of wisdom, resonating through the vast emptiness. Upholding the precepts to restrain oneself causes the five tones to return to the body; when the five tones naturally return, the ears are free from evil sounds, and one’s years and life may be preserved for long ages.

The Heavenly Worthy said: The East embodies the penetrating emptiness of primordial yang qi, qi emerging from emptiness, its wisdom bright and its wisdom vast. Thus it is called penetrating emptiness, boundlessly open and without obstruction, the primordial blue qi impossible to exhaust. Though called a single penetration of wisdom, it encompasses the five qi. Emptiness admits nothing, thus it is free from harm.

Though humans possess form, their form likewise emulates emptiness. The nose contains the spirits of yellow tranquility and repelling impurity. If one does not uphold the precepts, wisdom remains unopened. Without entering wisdom, one must not partake of foul and rank substances. The qi of foul and rank things causes the nose’s spirit to become congested, its pathways obstructed, easily severed, its bright beam blocked. Thus this precept is expounded to deliver heavenly and earthly beings, enabling all men and women to hear the Dharma’s sound. Should one wish to transcend the eight difficulties and myriad sufferings, one must receive this precept to restrain the nose’s spirit, avoiding excessive intake of foulness. By cleansing and dredging the bright beam, guiding and drawing forth the qi of life, one enables the penetration of wisdom, the qi of emptiness to enter. Upholding the precepts to restrain oneself causes all qi to return to the body; when all qi naturally return, merging with the qi, one’s body and life are preserved for long ages, never to be destroyed.

The Heavenly Worthy said: The West embodies the penetrating emptiness of lesser yin qi, qi emerging from emptiness, its wisdom subtle and its wisdom clear. Thus it is called penetrating emptiness, boundlessly open and difficult to exhaust, the lesser yin qi. Though called a single penetration of wisdom, it encompasses the five flavors. Emptiness admits nothing and contains nothing. Though humans emulate emptiness, if one does not uphold the precepts, wisdom remains unopened. Without wisdom, the five flavors become afflictions: gluttonous craving for rich and greasy foods causes the five spirits to become unsettled, leading to peril and danger, shortening one’s years and life. Thus this precept is expounded to deliver heavenly and earthly beings, enabling all men and women to universally hear the Dharma’s sound. Should one desire long life, one must uphold the great precepts to restrain the five spirits, guarding against greed for the five flavors. By moderating rich and greasy foods, cleansing and dredging the five viscera, keeping them cool and clear, and cultivating wisdom, the five flavors become harmonious and fragrant, the inner self tranquil and at peace, and one’s years and life remain unharmed.

The Heavenly Worthy said: The South embodies penetrating clarity, the qi of greater yang emerging from clarity, its wisdom clear and its wisdom opened, interlinked and penetratingly clear. Thus the South possesses the Crimson Emperor’s Hall of Penetrating Yang, where the myriad things are smelted and refined, receiving refinement to become luminous. If one does not uphold the precepts, wisdom remains unopened; without wisdom, the heart’s spirit becomes agitated, giving rise to desire and love, causing one to become lost and confused, harming the spirit and injuring life, preventing longevity. Thus this precept is expounded to deliver heavenly and earthly beings, enabling all men and women to universally hear the Dharma’s sound. Should one desire long life and transcend all afflictions, one must receive this precept to restrain the heart’s spirit, eliminating emotions and dispelling desires, abandoning the dust to enter clarity. By enabling the penetration of wisdom and opening the six senses’ pathways, the body enters penetrating clarity, merging with the qi of nature, preserving one’s years and life to attain eternal longevity.

The Heavenly Worthy said: The North is called penetrating subtlety, subtlety born of the mysterious, its wisdom far-reaching and its wisdom profound, subtly penetrating the true. It darkly observes transgressions and blessings, presiding over the origin of life, its hands emulating the four seasons, corresponding above to Heaven’s Gate. As Heaven’s Gate eternally turns, so too do the hands move. The hands possess a great spirit that receives life and fills the directions, governing the four great elements of humans, observing human success and failure. If one does not uphold the precepts, wisdom remains unopened, causing the heart to become agitated, all evils to arise, the hands to act unconsciously, greedily stealing and selfishly scheming, leading to the loss of wisdom and life, failing to complete one’s natural lifespan. Thus this precept is expounded to deliver heavenly and earthly beings. Should one desire long life and transcend evil roots, one must uphold this precept to restrain the hand’s spirit, enabling the penetration of wisdom and the heart’s natural clarity. By preventing the hands from coveting and stealing, evil roots do not arise. Corresponding to Heaven and following the qi, the body enters nature, preserving one’s years and life to attain eternal longevity.

The *Scripture of Ascending Mystery* states: The Nine Precepts of Great Clarity are as follows. The First Precept: The body must not be defiled or impure, indulging in desires and sensual realms, obscuring and inviting bodily misfortune, wantonly self-indulgent, delighting in evil and committing wrongs, adorning oneself with ornate and extravagant finery, seeking comfort in soft and smooth things, wallowing in self-gratification without satiety, unaware of falling into the net of transgressions, unable to awaken to one’s own faults. The body’s transgressions are vast and immeasurable. One must not personally violate this precept nor instruct others to do so. By gathering the mind and upholding the precepts, one practices them throughout life.

This is the First Precept of the Supreme Venerable Supreme Unity.

The Second Precept states: The mind must not harbor evil thoughts or malicious intentions. It must not form judgments or evaluations, covet and strive for gain, obscure and obstruct wealth and profit, indulge in greed and hidden malice, scheme unlawfully, engage in licentiousness and perversion, hold biased and unequal views, harbor jealousy and ignorance, act with self-righteousness and cruelty, or wallow in turbid desires and gluttony without satiety. Unaware of falling into the net of transgressions, unable to awaken to one’s own faults, the sins of the mind are vast and boundless. One must not personally violate this precept nor instruct others to do so. By gathering the mind and upholding the precepts, one practices them throughout life.

This is the Second Precept of the Supreme Venerable Supreme Unity.

The Third Precept states: The mouth must not recklessly speak of good or evil, utter curses or insults, deceive with falsehoods, sow discord with double-tongued words, engage in litigation or accusations, gossip about others’ faults, create disputes or fabricate harm, stir up baseless conflicts, disrupt public order, or indulge in singing, chanting, whistling, or sighing. It must not crave fine flavors or take pleasure in tastes without satiety. Unaware of falling into the net of transgressions, unable to awaken to one’s own faults, the sins of the mouth are vast and boundless. One must not personally violate this precept nor instruct others to do so. By gathering the mind and upholding the precepts, one practices them throughout life.

This is the Third Precept of the Supreme Venerable Supreme Unity.

The Fourth Precept states: The hands must not kill or harm living beings, including crawling, creeping, or blood-bearing creatures. They must not plunder, rob, steal, or take what is not rightfully theirs, nor pick up lost items or accept improper offerings. They must not wield weapons or act unlawfully. Unaware of falling into the net of transgressions, unable to awaken to one’s own faults, the sins of the hands are the gravest of all. One must not personally violate this precept nor instruct others to do so. By gathering the mind and upholding the precepts, one practices them throughout life.

This is the Fourth Precept of the Supreme Venerable Supreme Unity.

The Fifth Precept states: The eyes must not gaze upon what is contrary to the Dao, the law, or righteousness—ornate adornments, seductive appearances, or lustful sights. They must not be dazzled by excess, overflowing with greed, or captivated by finery, jewels, licentiousness, or inauspicious omens. The eyes, as the rear guard, gather all misfortunes, bringing forth calamities and poisons. Sins and transgressions accumulate, all originating from the eyes. The mind, eyes, mouth, and hands are the sources of misfortune, the instigators of disaster, and the repositories of sin. They must not be indulged, nor left unrestrained, nor treated with carelessness. Unaware of falling into the net of transgressions, unable to awaken to one’s own faults, the sins of the eyes are the gravest of all. One must proclaim the precepts for the eyes, exhorting all to observe them. By upholding the eye precepts, thoughts subside; when thoughts cease, the mind becomes empty; when the mind is empty and unattached, one enters the realm of nothingness and attains the wisdom of the Dao. By gathering the mind and upholding the precepts, one practices them without fail throughout life.

This is the Fifth Precept of the Supreme Venerable Supreme Unity.

The Sixth Precept states: The ears must not listen to the eight sounds or five musics, licentious or inauspicious melodies that disrupt righteousness and lead to the downfall of nations, or deceptive and corrupting music without satiety. Unaware of falling into the net of transgressions, unable to awaken to one’s own faults, the sins of the ears are also grave. One must not personally violate this precept nor instruct others to do so. By gathering the mind and upholding the precepts, one practices them throughout life.

This is the Sixth Precept of the Supreme Venerable Supreme Unity.

The Seventh Precept states: The nose must not covet fragrances or despise foul odors, nor recklessly discern good and evil. Unaware of falling into the net of transgressions, unable to awaken to one’s own faults, the sins of the nose are also considerable. One must not personally violate this precept nor instruct others to do so. By gathering the mind and upholding the precepts, one practices them throughout life.

This is the Seventh Precept of the Supreme Venerable Supreme Unity.

The Eighth Precept states: The feet must not tread upon unrighteousness, transgress the law, or traverse evil or inauspicious paths. Unaware of falling into the net of transgressions, unable to awaken to one’s own faults, the sins of the feet are also considerable. One must not personally violate this precept nor instruct others to do so. By gathering the mind and upholding the precepts, one practices them throughout life.

This is the Eighth Precept of the Supreme Venerable Supreme Unity.

The Ninth Precept states: The body must not indulge in reckless abandon, forcibly invoke spirits, or attack what is not its adversary, lest essence dissipate, spirit scatter, and the three qi flee. By giving free rein to desires without satiety, unaware of falling into the net of transgressions, one risks the ruin of one’s clan and lineage, unable to awaken to one’s own faults. Such sins are the gravest of all. One must not personally violate this precept nor instruct others to do so. By gathering the mind and upholding the precepts, one practices them throughout life.

This is the Ninth Precept of the Supreme Venerable Supreme Unity.

There are ten precepts in total. The *Scripture of Resolute Mind* states: To transmit the Dharma of the Ten Precepts, the Dharma master sits facing south while the disciple bows three times toward the master. After paying respects, the disciple requests: "I wish to receive the accomplished Ten Precepts and vow to uphold them throughout my life, swearing never to transgress them." Thereupon, kneeling reverently with focused mind, the disciple visualizes the great sages of the ten directions above and receives the precepts with hands clasped in sincerity. The Dharma master burns incense and expounds the precepts as follows:

First: Do not kill; cherish all living beings.
Second: Do not engage in licentiousness or harbor wayward thoughts.
Third: Do not steal or take unrighteous wealth.

Fourth: Do not deceive; reverse falsehood with truth.
Fifth: Do not become intoxicated; constantly reflect on pure conduct.
Sixth: Maintain harmony among clan and kin, without partiality.
Seventh: Upon witnessing another’s good deeds, rejoice and lend support in mind.
Eighth: Upon seeing another in distress, assist in performing meritorious acts.
Ninth: When others act against me, resolve not to retaliate.
Tenth: Toward all who have yet to attain the Dao, I shall hold no expectations.

These are the Ten Precepts.
The recipient responds: "Disciple [Name] receives them and vows to uphold and cultivate them throughout life."
Then, all rites of reverence to the master are completed.

The Heavenly Worthy states: Those who receive these Ten Precepts and cultivate them according to the Dharma shall be guarded and protected by the celestial officials of the ten directions, and shall unfailingly attain the Dao.

Yet even the merit of the Five Precepts is beyond measure.

The *Scripture of the Great Precepts* states: When performing purification rites or seeking the Dao, one should wholeheartedly request and receive the Ten Precepts, earnestly upholding them without forgetfulness.

Fifth Precept: Let the mouth utter no evil words. Speech should not be ornate or deceitful. Be loyal and upright in both inner and outer conduct, avoiding transgressions of speech.
Sixth Precept: Abstain from alcohol and regulate conduct. Harmonize qi and temperament. Do not harm the spirit or commit manifold evils.
Seventh Precept: Do not envy those who surpass you. Avoid contention over merit and fame. In all matters, yield and withdraw, placing others before oneself.
Eighth Precept: Do not criticize or disparage the scriptures and teachings. Receive the Dharma with reverence, ever as though in the presence of the divine.
Ninth Precept: Do not engage in quarrels or slander. Do not judge or disparage the four classes of beings. Heaven and humanity will condemn such actions, which harm the spirit and qi.
Tenth Precept: In all actions and conduct, maintain equanimity and single-mindedness. Let harmony prevail among people and tranquility among spirits. Let this be the constant practice.

The Twelve Principles to Follow, as stated in the *Sutra of Great Precepts*:

The Fourteen Methods for Governing the Body, as stated in the *Questions of the Superior*:
When speaking to a ruler, one should bring benevolence to the state; to a father, kindness to his children; to a teacher, love for the multitude; to an elder brother, fraternal respect in conduct; to a minister, loyalty to the sovereign; to a child, filial piety toward parents; to a friend, trustworthiness in dealings; to a wife, chastity toward her husband; to a husband, harmony within the household; to a disciple, reverence in ritual; to a rustic, diligence in farming; to a worthy person or Daoist, adherence to the Dao; to a foreigner, each guarding their own domain; to a servant or maid, prudence in service.

The Thirty-Six Precepts, as stated in the *Laojun’s Prohibitions and Precepts*:
Practice non-action, practice gentleness and weakness, practice holding to the feminine—do not act first. These are the three supreme practices of the highest rank.
Practice namelessness, practice purity and tranquility, practice all goodness. These are the three supreme practices of the middle rank.
Practice loyalty and filial piety, practice contentment, practice yielding. These are the three supreme practices of the lowest rank.
These nine practices form the first set, comprising eighty-one chapters, gathered as the abode of the Dao, where the exalted and humble share the same standards.
Those who fully embody the highest rank become immortals; those who practice six attain doubled longevity; those who practice three gain extended years and avoid untimely death.

Precepts against anger and delight, for anger is akin to evil.
Precepts against wasting essence and qi.

Precepts against harming the qi of rulers.
Precepts against violating the Dao.
Precepts against being moved by external things.

These twenty-seven precepts form the second set, collectively constituting the profound source of the Dao, where the exalted and humble share the same practices.
Those who fully embody the highest rank become immortals; those who uphold eighteen attain doubled longevity; those who uphold nine gain extended years and avoid untimely death.
Together, they form the Thirty-Six Precepts.

There are also Twelve Prohibitions:
Prohibition against immoderate lewdness and play.
Immoderate lewdness and play cause the spirit and qi to lose focus, harming the hun and po souls. When the hun and po are harmed, one is prone to wild and reckless behavior.
Prohibition against excessive laughter and loud shouting.
Excessive laughter and loud shouting cause the spirit and qi to scatter, harming the qi of the intestines. When the intestinal qi is harmed, one is prone to fright, palpitations, trembling, and fear.
Prohibition against sorrow, worry, resentment, and anger.
Sorrow, worry, resentment, and anger cause the hun and po souls to fail in their movements, harming the five viscera. When the five viscera are harmed, the will and mind become perverse, leading to delusional speech.
Prohibition against extreme drunkenness and overeating.
Extreme drunkenness and overeating cause the spirit and qi to fail in their containment, harming the six bowels. When the six bowels are harmed, abscesses and ulcers arise without reason.
Prohibition against prolonged grief and prolonged thought.
Prolonged grief and thought cause the spirit and qi to lose their regularity, harming the yin qi. When the yin qi is harmed, one is prone to self-terror and anxiety.
Prohibition against prolonged speech and conversation.
Prolonged speech and conversation cause the spirit and qi to dissipate, harming the yang qi. When the yang qi is harmed, one becomes absent-minded and prone to forgetfulness.
Prohibition against prolonged standing.
Prolonged standing causes the spirit and qi to be exhausted and severed, harming the bone marrow. When the bone marrow is harmed, the joints become stiff and fluid flows improperly.
Prohibition against prolonged sitting.
Prolonged sitting causes the spirit and qi to become knotted and obstructed, harming the sinews and vessels. When the sinews and vessels are harmed, the lower back, arms, muscles, and bones become numb.

Prohibition against prolonged thirst.
Prolonged thirst causes the spirit and qi to become parched and scattered, harming the heart. When the heart is harmed, one is prone to panting, palpitations, chest fullness, and counterflow qi.

Prohibition against prolonged gazing.
Prolonged gazing causes the spirit and qi to become disturbed and dissipated, harming the essence. When the essence is harmed, one suffers from seminal emission or listlessness.

Prohibition against prolonged lying down.
Prolonged lying down causes the spirit and qi to accumulate and stagnate, harming the muscles and skin. When the muscles and skin are harmed, one is prone to retching, heart tremors, and shivering.

Prohibition against prolonged listening.
Prolonged listening causes the spirit and qi to become sparse and disordered, harming the will. When the will is harmed, one is prone to forgetfulness, distraction, and spontaneous weeping.

The Lord Lao said: Those who can practice these twelve prohibitions may preserve their essence and qi, gather their spirit and numen, ride the six dragons, gallop through the dark and distant, behold the Nine Capitals, tread the courtyard of the Queen of Earth, mount floating clouds, enter the Great Clarity, lodge in the Void, swiftly traverse with the Six Ding, enter the immortal palaces, and attain longevity.

Below are the Nine Precepts:
Amidst the gathering of beloved multitudes, the heart rests in the treasury of Daoist precepts;
In the dwelling of sorrow and affliction, the heart abides in the hall of benevolent deliverance;
Within the chamber of dark obscurity, the aspiration lies at the threshold of extinction;
Leaning against an unstable dwelling, the heart is under the protection of expedient means;
Sitting upon the ground of serpents and vipers, the heart treads the path of renunciation;
Dwelling in the thicket of tigers and leopards, the heart resides in the sanctuary of merit and virtue □□;
□□□□□, the heart rests in the hermitage of contemplating extinction;
Standing □□□□, the heart is in the garden of thorns and brambles;
□□□□□, the heart is behind the barrier of armor and defense.

Such is the observance of precepts by us: practicing the expedient means of wisdom, delivering from the peril of death and rebirth, extinguishing all imaginings, eradicating all thoughts, returning to that which is extinguished by nothing, attaining the true Dao.

The One Hundred and Eighty Precepts of Lord Lao were originally expounded for the Covenant of Might and other assemblies.

Lord Lao said: Though a person may live ten thousand years, without upholding the precepts and disciplines, how do they differ from an ancient tree or enduring stone? Better to uphold the precepts for a single day, practice the Dao, and die, than to live without transgression. Upholding the precepts at death, one supplements the celestial offices and ascends as an immortal through liberation in the corpse.

Though a person may hold the position of king or duke in the world, at death they bear heavy transgressions, which do not benefit the hun and po souls—the souls suffer punishment. Orthodox Unity Daoists, enlightened and practicing accordingly.

When upholding the precepts, disciples bathe, abstain from the five flavors and five pungent plants, and change their clothing. Disciples should observe the ritual teachings of their masters, prostrate themselves, and listen to the prohibitions and precepts. Once the prohibitions and precepts are received, they should copy them once and recite them diligently in practice.

The master says: Let all worthies listen clearly. Among the ten thousand things under heaven, none endure forever. Human life is subject to death; things formed must decay. The sun rises and sets; the moon waxes and fills, then wanes. From ancient times to the present, who has ever remained forever? Only the Dao and its virtue endure. Today is also good, this month is also good, this hour is also good, all worthies are also good, the lineage of masters is also good, the disciples are also good, the ten thousand spirits are all present, the officers and soldiers have all arrived. Today, for the sake of Lord Lao, for the sake of teaching all worthies, for the sake of the world’s people cherishing their lives, for the sake of the disciples’ good hearts, we confer the prohibitions and weighty precepts. Let there be assent, and after the triple praise, we shall then expound the precepts.

Lord Lao spoke to Ji, saying: "All the immortals, worthies, and sagely beings of ancient times attained the Dao through the One Hundred Eighty Precepts. The *One Hundred Illnesses* are expounded in the *Scripture of Laozi’s Emptiness and Non-Being*: Thus the sage seeks blessings before their signs appear and severs misfortune before it arises, for calamities grow from the slightest beginnings, and illness arises from the faintest stirrings.

People deem small good deeds of no benefit and so refuse to perform them; they regard minor wrongs as harmless and so refuse to amend them. Small goods left unaccumulated, great virtue cannot be achieved; minor evils left unchecked, great transgressions are formed. Therefore, these one hundred illnesses are set forth to make known the grounds of one’s downfall.

Observing the Three Hundred Great Precepts, it is said:
The Primordial Heavenly King bestowed them upon the Most High Dao Lord,
the Dao Lord transmitted them to the Emperor of the Grand Tenuity.
When the Emperor received the precepts, he chanted three verses:

*"Wisdom arises from original nonbeing,
luminous and bright, transcending the ten directions.
It binds emptiness and erects the mysterious heavens,
while all heavens draw from its flowing fragrance.
Its subtlety defies thought and discussion,
as emptiness responds and truth truly communicates.
Being is ultimately nonbeing,
while nonbeing contains all without exclusion.
Wisdom constantly observes the body—
this is the foremost task in learning the Dao.
Vast and boundless, it roams the mysterious expanse,
naturally recording my spirit.
The Heavenly Worthy ever protects and shelters,
while demon kings pledge their guardianship.
Resplendent is the golden radiant body,
transcending the Most High Immortals.
Wisdom engenders the root of precepts,
the true Dao takes precepts as its master.
From this the Three Treasures arise,
revered and received by lofty sages.
Riding this deathless boat,
one swiftly crosses the great expanse.
At this moment of preaching the precepts,
all heavenly perfected bow their heads."*

The precepts on observing the body, from the fifth to the one hundred and eightieth, constitute the Way of the noble person. They are titled *The Jade Purity Wisdom Precepts of the Lower Prime* (*Yu Qing Zhi Hui Xia Yuan Pin Jie*).

If one has a household, the Three Poisons will not be extinguished, and the Three Perfected will not reside.
If one has a body, all demons will not depart, and concentrated thought will yield no response.

The Precepts from the Fifth to the Three Hundredth are of the Supreme, Boundless Dao, known as the *Highest Jade Purity Wisdom Upper Prime Precepts*. The Subtle Heavenly Emperor states: If one upholds the precepts, when a disciple lodges alone in the mountains and forests or in fearful places, they should sound the celestial drum thirty-four times. With the heart fixed on the precepts, divine guardians will encircle them in threefold protection; malevolent spirits dare not approach, and blessings and virtue will ever follow. All the celestial benevolent spirits will respond and safeguard them, while former adversaries and creditors will all generate compassionate hearts.

Compiled by Daoist Zhu Faman of the Three Caverns

**On Karmic Retribution**
To purify the heart and walk the straight path is beyond the reach of royal law; to act with whole sincerity in the true leaves no fear of hell’s comings and goings. Yet if the six senses cling to attachments, the five destinies of rebirth will follow; the weight of transgressions arises from one’s own conduct, and retribution is meted out accordingly. Not a hair’s breadth is lost, for the netherworld records every fault.

The *Scripture of the Three Primes’ Precepts* states: The Heavenly Bureau has thirty-six offices, the Earthly and Water Bureaus each have forty-two offices, totaling one hundred twenty offices across the Three Bureaus. Each office holds one *kao* (trial), the officials oversee one hundred twenty *kao*, the clerks one thousand two hundred *kao*, the soldiers twelve thousand *kao*, and the officers follow the sins committed in a person’s lifetime, hastening their trials.

*Essential Precepts and Rituals for Cultivation*, Scroll Eight.

Compiled by Daoist Zhu Faman of the Three Caverns, *The Compendium of Retreat Names*

To enter stillness and ascend to the True, one must rely on retreat and precepts, employing external methods to harmonize the inner rituals of the heart-mind. As the *Scripture of Salvation* states: When the cycles of Heaven and Earth reach their end, one must observe retreat, burn incense, and recite scriptures. When the constellations fall into disorder and the sun and moon lose their proper course, one must observe retreat, burn incense, and recite scriptures. When the four seasons lose their balance and yin and yang fall out of harmony, one must observe retreat, burn incense, and recite scriptures. When the sovereign faces calamity and warfare erupts on all sides, one must observe retreat, burn incense, and recite scriptures. When pestilence and poison spread, causing the multitudes to perish, one must observe retreat, burn incense, and recite scriptures. When teachers and companions pass from this life, one must observe retreat, burn incense, and recite scriptures.

The merit of retreat, precepts, and scripture recitation is profound. Above, it dispels celestial disasters and safeguards the emperor; below, it wards off poison and harm, delivering the multitudes. In life and death, all depend upon it—its blessings are beyond measure.

The *Scripture of the Sacred Record* states: There are six types of retreats. The first is the Shangqing Retreat, which has two methods: first, seclusion from the crowd to dine alone, calming the qi and transcending form; second, purifying the altar and solemnizing the assembly, following the rites of the Supreme Perfected. First, one delivers the Nine Ancestors, then one’s family, and finally oneself.

The second is the Lingbao Retreat, which has six methods:
1. The Golden Register Retreat, to deliver and protect the sovereign;
2. The Yellow Register Retreat, to deliver and uplift ancestral generations;
3. The Illuminating the True Retreat, to repent for the Nine Dark Realms;
4. The Three Primes Retreat, to confess transgressions of the precepts;
5. The Eight Nodes Retreat, to repent for past and recent faults;
6. The Natural Retreat, to pray for blessings on behalf of the people.

The third is the Dongshen Retreat, where purity and simplicity are paramount, transcending the dust to await the numinous.

The fourth is the Taiyi Retreat, where reverence and solemnity take precedence.

The fifth is the Zhijiao Retreat, where clarity and austerity are prized.

The sixth is the Tutan Retreat, where diligence and hardship are the measure of merit.

These various retreats, from ancient times to the present, have been held in great esteem. Though eras change and customs differ, some details may vary within the Lingbao Retreat, occasionally observed as a "half-day retreat." The half-day retreat is a form of "overnight invocation," where no verbal merit is accrued—only repentance is performed for one or two periods, without the threefold offering of incense. It omits the *Step-by-Step Invocation* and abbreviates the scripture veneration, or in minor retreats, three sighs suffice. Wishes may be adapted to the occasion, and rites adjusted for convenience. Since it is not a grand assembly, sincerity alone suffices.

*The Compendium of Retreat Months*
The *Three Primes Precepts* states: The first month is when the Celestial Official conducts his audit; the seventh month is when the Earthly Official conducts his audit; the tenth month is when the Water Official conducts his audit. These three months are suitable for prolonged retreats.

The *Scripture of Salvation* states: A prolonged retreat in the first month benefits the departed souls of past generations; a prolonged retreat in the seventh month benefits oneself; a prolonged retreat in the tenth month stabilizes the nation’s destiny.

The *Luminous True Rites* states: The first, third, fifth, seventh, ninth, and eleventh months—six months in a year—are retreat months.

The *Zhijiao Scripture* states: During these six retreat months, the Three Heavens command the Celestial Emperor and the Taiyi Envoys to inspect the transgressions of the world’s people. On these days, observing retreat removes the Ten Sufferings and allows one to pay homage to the Most High.

The *Eight Secret Sayings of the Supreme Clarity* states: The first, third, fourth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth, and eleventh months—nine months in a year—are the Nine Perfected Retreat Months.

*The Compendium of Retreat Days*
The *Great Offering Scripture of the Mysterious Capital* states: The fifteenth day of the first month is when the Celestial Official conducts his audit—the Shangyuan Retreat Day. The fifteenth day of the seventh month is when the Earthly Official conducts his audit—the Zhongyuan Retreat Day. The fifteenth day of the tenth month is when the Water Official conducts his audit—the Xiayuan Retreat Day. Observing retreat on these three days allows the Three Officials to inscribe one’s name in the Register of Good Deeds.

The *Scripture of the Royal Person’s Original Conduct* states: There are three retreat days in a month: the first, the fifteenth, and the twenty-ninth, which are suitable for pure retreat.

The *Flying Mystery Scripture of the Supreme Clarity* states: The Queen Mother of the West regularly observes retreat in the first, second, fourth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, eleventh, and twelfth months—ten months in a year—on the third, fifth, ninth, fifteenth, and twenty-fifth days of each month. These five days each month are for pure retreat and focused cultivation.

The Primordial Beginning bestowed meditation upon the Supreme Perfected Mother of the Nine Numina of the Western Prime, gifting her a nine-colored phoenix robe, phoenix-cloud sandals, a divine phoenix purple wheel, and a flying feather canopy with twenty-four chariots. She decreed that on these days, if the people—men and women alike—observe pure retreat and recite scriptures, they shall attain their heart’s desires, shed the weight of three thousand grave offenses, and receive blessings from the Nine Heavens.

The *Scripture of the Sacred Record* states: The seventh day of the first month is called the *Assembly of Promotion and Reward*; the seventh day of the seventh month is called the *Assembly of Celebrating Life*; the fifth day of the tenth month is called the *Grand Assembly of Establishing Life*. On these three assembly days, the Three Officials review merits and transgressions. Observing retreat and presenting petitions on these days invokes sublime blessings.

It further states the Five La Days: The first day of the first month is *Celestial La*; the fifth day of the fifth month is *Earthly La*; the seventh day of the seventh month is *Moral La*; the first day of the tenth month is *People’s Year La*; and the festival day of the twelfth month is *Nobles’ La*. The Five La Days, together with the Three Primes, are called the *Eight Liberation Days*. On these days, one may prepare pure offerings, hold retreats to seek blessings, and also venerate ancestors—such a one is called a filial child, and their blessings are boundless. Other days are termed "licentious sacrifices" and incur transgressions.

The *Luminous True Rites* states: The first, eighth, fourteenth, fifteenth, eighteenth, twenty-third, twenty-fourth, twenty-eighth, twenty-ninth, and thirtieth days of the month are called the *Ten Upright Retreat Days*.

The *Sutra of Essential Teachings* states:
On the first day of the month, the Northern Dipper descends;
on the eighth day, the Northern Dipper’s Deity of Slaying Ghosts descends;
on the fourteenth day, the Envoy of the Great One descends;
on the fifteenth day, the Celestial Emperor descends.
When the Celestial Emperor descends, the sun, moon, stars, and all celestial officials descend with him.
On the eighteenth day, the Heavenly One descends;
on the twenty-third day, the Eight Divine Envoys of the Great One descend;
on the twenty-fourth day, the Northern Asterism descends;
on the twenty-eighth day, the Lower Great One descends;
on the twenty-ninth day, the Middle Great One descends;
on the thirtieth day, the Upper Great One descends.
When the Great One descends, the sun, moon, five planets, twenty-eight constellations, the jade armillary sphere, the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper, the Deities of Life and Record, the Deities of Punishment and Slaying, the Great Sage and Venerable Spirits, the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct, and the Celestial Emperor and Great King all descend together.
On these days, celestial and terrestrial spirits alike tremble in reverence, traversing the world to observe human good and evil.
If on such days one maintains a steadfast heart, advances with diligence, does not transgress the scriptural teachings, honors and upholds the precepts, recites sutras and practices the Dao, and widely propagates the Dharma, the Great One rejoices, increasing their lifespan and blessings, inscribing their name on the left register, engraving it in the Jade Record, and conferring the title of Perfected.
If on such days one kills living beings, practices deceit, engages in licentiousness or theft, curses or humiliates Daoist priests, or slanders the scriptural teachings, the Great One grows furious, diminishing their lifespan and blessings, inscribing their name on the right register, reporting it to the Three Officials, and branding them a sinner.
On *jiǎzǐ* days, the Great One dispatches the Envoy of the Central Terrace to descend;
on the Eight Seasonal Nodes, the Eight Divine Envoys of the Great One descend.
On these days, one should also observe the retreat, and the Great One will rejoice.
On *gēngshēn* days, the concealed corpses within the body ascend to report one’s transgressions.
On one’s natal day, the body that has received the Dharma sees its officers and soldiers ascend to heaven to tally one’s merits and faults—one must observe the retreat on these days as well.

The *Inner Writ of the Three Sovereigns* states:
On *jiǎzǐ* days, the Celestial Sovereign’s attending officials descend at midnight;
on *jiǎxū* days, the Celestial Sovereign’s attending officials descend at dusk;
on *jiǎshēn* days, the Earthly Sovereign’s attending officials descend at the evening meal hour;
on *jiǎwǔ* days, the Earthly Sovereign’s attending officials descend at noon;
on *jiǎchén* days, the Human Sovereign’s attending officials descend at breakfast hour;
on *jiǎyín* days, the Human Sovereign’s attending officials descend at dawn.
When the celestial officials descend, the deities of the Five Peaks and Four Waterways take their positions according to direction, examining good and evil, reporting merits and recording transgressions—nothing fails to reach the ears of the portents.
One should observe the retreat on these days and stabilize the register at Southern Prosperity.

On *dīngmǎo* days, the Celestial Sovereign’s attending officials descend at sunrise;
on *dīngchǒu* days, the Celestial Sovereign’s attending officials descend at cockcrow;
on *dīngyǒu* days, the Earthly Sovereign’s attending officials descend at sunset;
on *dīnghài* days, the Earthly Sovereign’s attending officials descend at the hour of human rest;
on *dīngwèi* days, the Human Sovereign’s attending officials descend at the afternoon hour;
on *dīngsì* days, the Human Sovereign’s attending officials descend at the midday hour.
These six *dīng* days are the yin spirit days of the Three Sovereigns.
Observing the retreat on these days, the Perfected of the Five Peaks each dispatch five spirits to guard and protect, recording one’s name in the Register of Immortals.

On the timing of retreats:
The *Regulations of the Thousand Perfected* states: When determining the time for a retreat, first measure the shadow with a gnomon. On cloudy days, use a water clock to divide the hours.
The *Sutra of the Fundamental Conduct of the Sovereign* states: Retreats should follow the proper time, not arbitrary moments. The method begins by erecting a gnomon, marking its height in feet and inches, placing it in the central courtyard, and measuring the length of its shadow according to the twenty-four solar terms to determine the proper time.
After the Beginning of Spring, a shadow of six feet five inches is the proper time; five feet six inches is improper.
After Rain Water, six feet is proper; five feet two inches is improper.
After the Waking of Insects, five feet five inches is proper; four feet seven inches is improper.
After the Spring Equinox, five feet is proper; four feet two inches is improper.

After Greater Cold, seven feet is proper; six feet two inches is improper.

The *Huang Ren* states: All good men and women who maintain the fast without fail shall have their names recorded in the celestial registers of the Heavenly Officials. If they violate the precepts and lose proper measure, they shall be examined and punished by the Earthly Officials.

The *Dharma Master’s Notes on the Xuan Du Precepts* says: The fast is fundamentally rooted in purity and emptiness, its practice in tranquility and stillness, its foundation in humility, and its conduct in reverence. One must tread with trembling caution, as though crossing thin ice or a deep ravine, and stand with solemn awe, as though before a stern sovereign. When reaching the passages of scripture, one should rise to bow and worship, wholeheartedly invoking goodness, following one’s aspirations in prayer, and ensuring sincerity in suffering—thus one will surely receive a response.

Nowadays, those who establish fasts often fail to attend with due intention. Many neglect the proper observances, chiefly due to the arrogance of great virtue, which leads subordinates into error and negligence. This compilation of precepts is presented to briefly illustrate the necessity of reverence and diligence.

The *Lower Scroll of the Natural Formula* states: To move Heaven and Earth, summon the host of spirits, communicate with the Dao of immortals, penetrate the perfection of the utmost truth, dissolve the sins of past lives, dispel misfortune, repel vengeful foes, cultivate abundant virtue, cure illnesses, and aid all beings—nothing is closer to the fast.

The *Golden Register Simplified Text* says: When conducting a fast, one should appoint one eminent Dharma master, one chief cantor, one fast supervisor, one scripture attendant, one incense attendant, and one lamp attendant. The following day, during the procession, each should be assigned a supervising master, and proclamations should be made widely.

The *Tai Zhen Regulations* states: If following the ritual procedures of fasting and precepts, those of great virtue should walk and sit at the forefront, admonishing their disciples to maintain order. They must ensure that the host harbors no disdain, nor should any engage in contentious debates without fear or restraint. Not only do such actions offend both Daoists and laypeople, the virtuous and the wicked alike, but the ten directions’ great sages also observe in secret. Transgressions invite calamity, and each bears the consequences themselves.

The *Tai Zhen Regulations* further states: When establishing a fast, one should invite upright and incorruptible Daoists—though such individuals are rare. The number invited is not limited, so that even those lacking deep faith may hear of it and cultivate reverence, thereby accumulating merit and virtue, for without the fast, nothing can be accomplished. Truly, the upright and incorruptible are worthy of reverence, while the greedy and lustful, filled with self-importance, always seek precedence in offerings. If, after selection, they fail to examine themselves and instead become a great affliction to the host’s merit-making, they should reflect and withdraw—only then are they worthy of being called disciples of the Dao.

The *Golden Register Simplified Text* says: The household establishing the fast should, one day prior, bathe and cleanse both inner and outer spaces. All family members, young and old, should unite in mind for the fast.

The *Tai Zhen Regulations* states: Once the fast officials arrive for the overnight stay, they should all bathe in fragrant water. Afterward, they shall enter the Dharma hall to receive the precepts and instructions, maintaining solemn and orderly decorum. Violating any rule incurs a penalty of one stroke. The regulations state: Disobeying the Dharma master and acting on private whims incurs a penalty of two strokes. The regulations further state: Those who fail to arrive the night before may not enter the fast. People today often neglect the procession the following morning, yet if they arrive the night before for the preliminary rites, how can they claim sincerity? Some may seek external distractions, or sleep in their chambers, and when roles are assigned, omissions arise. The next day, during the incense procession, confusion and disputes erupt, all because the Dharma master failed to announce the procedures the night before. Such disorder leads to: first, the underworld recording transgressions; second, disrupting the Dharma rites; third, eroding reverence and faith; and fourth, rendering merit and goodness unreliable.

A treatise states: Those who do evil openly are punished by people; those who do evil in secret are punished by spirits. Only when one is clear before both people and spirits can one act with true independence. Lord Lao said: The net of Heaven is vast, its mesh wide but never failing. Since the host is offering rites and provisions, how can one sit idly and incur calamity? Let each reflect and awaken to this truth.

The *Tai Zhen Regulations* states: Once fast officials receive the proclamations, they may not converse with outsiders, or they incur a penalty of two strokes. The regulations state: On the day of the fast, one must maintain purity, focus the spirit on the Dao, mark the gate to bar guests, and separate inner and outer spaces.

The *Thousand Perfected Regulations* says: Three days before establishing a fast, the household should cleanse both inner and outer areas. At the gate, erect a long banner to signal to guests that those indulging in meat, garlic, or leeks may not enter, while those of reverence and faith may approach with solemnity.

The *Cantor’s Notes* states: When leading the fast procession, chanting and recitation come first. One must know the proper etiquette of progression and set the schedule for morning and evening.

The *Ritual Decorum for Spreading the Fast* says: The cantor’s duty is to clarify the correct scriptures, define roles, and oversee the timing of processions and the decorum of recitation. First, the Dharma drum is sounded, then the assembly is led forth. The cantor upholds the ritual standards, relying on chanting to guide reverence. When establishing a fast, the cantor must be capable and discerning: first, consulting with the Dharma master; second, understanding the host’s intent for the fast; third, setting the schedule in advance; and fourth, striking the drum and ringing the bell. In consulting the Dharma master, one must follow their guidance on progression and retreat, engaging in discussion rather than acting on personal whim or unilaterally controlling the disciples. In understanding the host’s intent, if the fast is for joy and celebration, the decorum should please the assembly; if for illness or hardship, diligence is paramount. One must predetermine the number of processions for the three periods or six periods.

The *Golden Register Simplified Text* states: The six periods for processions are dawn, midday, sunset, evening rest, midnight, and cockcrow. The three periods are dawn, midday, and evening rest alone.

The *Tai Zhen Regulations* says: All fasts held for others are conducted in three periods to alleviate suffering, rescue the distressed, repent sins, and dispel calamities. For seeking blessings, one recites and prays day and night without rest. If fatigue accumulates over days, one may rest in shifts, but scripture recitation and precept teachings must continue unceasingly, with processions conducted uniformly, never deficient.

If the officiating priest falls ill, report it, and the assembly shall withdraw from the ritual hall. The ritual space must remain solemn; one may not convalesce within it. Those recovering from illness shall be housed in separate quarters, lest they disturb the ritual space. If, by fortune, one is able to remain in the ritual, ascend the hall with dignity, refraining from drowsiness. Discreetly encourage one another, without resorting to punishment, for uneven penalties disrupt the utmost sincerity of prayer. Regularly apply the statutes of reprimand and discipline to ensure uniformity within and without, guiding the benighted toward enlightenment. Masters must not indiscriminately punish disciples; disciples, when punished, may not protest. If the punishment is indeed unjust, they may humbly appeal, but only to express their true intent. Harsh words must not be spoken, for they breed resentment. Master and disciple share the discourse of the Five Phases.

During the three-period processions, after the midday recess, rest until the evening meal; after the midnight recess, rest until cockcrow. At all other times, ascend to lecture and recite scriptures. During the six-period processions, after the midday recess, rest until the evening meal; after the dusk recess, rest until the hour of quietude; after the midnight recess, rest until cockcrow. Rest during these three periods, while at all other times, ascend to lecture and recite scriptures. Let heart and gaze converge, the mind fixed upon the mysterious void. In every action and deed, adhere strictly to the ritual codes.

When striking the drum or sounding the bell to summon immortals and gather sages, there are two kinds of ritual drums: one is the knocking of teeth, the other the golden bell and jade chime. As for the knocking of teeth, the *Ritual Codes* states: first sound the ritual drum, then lead the assembly. The ritual drum may be struck three, seven, nine, ten, twelve, twenty-four, thirty-six, forty-nine, seventy-two, or eighty-one times, as the occasion demands. The *Preface to the Scripture of Lord Lao* says: knock the teeth thrice, swallow saliva thrice. The *Scripture of Ascending the Mystery* states: knock the teeth seven times for the Seven Luminaries, for the Dao’s clarity must be awakened. The *Chapter on Generating the Spirit* says: knock the teeth nine times. The *Scripture of Ascending the Mystery* also states: knock the teeth twelve times, then exhale thrice. Elsewhere, it says: knock the teeth twenty-four times. The *Scripture of Salvation* says: knock the teeth thirty-two times, to be heard in the thirty-two heavens. The *Scripture of Ascending the Mystery* states: the Celestial Master, facing west, knocks the teeth forty-nine times; the Most High, facing east, knocks the teeth seventy-two times. It further says: the Most High knocks the teeth eighty-one times. The *Scripture of the Eight Secret Sayings of the Upper Clarity* states: the method of knocking the teeth—left against left is called "breaking the Heavenly Bell"; right against right is called "shaking the Heavenly Chime"; upper and lower center teeth striking each other is called "sounding the Heavenly Drum." If suddenly encountering inauspicious omens, strike the Heavenly Bell thirty-six times. For exorcising evil and invoking divine might, strike the Heavenly Chime. For meditating upon the Dao, summoning the true, and calling forth spirits, sound the Heavenly Drum. Though the act of knocking the teeth is singular, it comprises three distinct methods. Thus, evil flees at the sound of the Heavenly Bell; mountain spirits are subdued by the resonance of the Heavenly Chime; and spirits are summoned by the reverberation of the Heavenly Drum. The notes must be measured, the subtle inner resonance felt. One cannot seek uniformity nor rely on chance to summon them.

The *Records of Fengdu* recounts: Bao Zhu, a man of Jibei, over forty years of age and without any Daoist arts, suffered a stroke that twisted his mouth and face, causing his teeth to chatter incessantly. At the age of one hundred and twenty-seven, he perished in a great flood, swept away by the River of Longevity. The Northern Emperor repeatedly dispatched demon-slayers to seize him, but the demons dared not approach. When the demon officials inquired as to the reason, the slayers replied: "This man possesses many arts to restrain us. He constantly knocks his teeth, sounding the Heavenly Drum to alert his body’s spirits. The spirits do not scatter, and demonic qi cannot enter."

As for the second kind, the bell and chime, the *Tai Zhen Regulations* states: before the ritual hall and upon the scripture platform, hang a golden bell and jade chime, to be sounded at the appointed times. Before processions and lectures, strike them first, not only to alert the assembly but also to move the host of spirits. When humans and spirits are thus connected, they gather in unison, magnifying the Dao and aiding beings, their abundant virtue converging as one. It further states: when the Dharma-body strikes the bell, one must be girded in solemn attire, the mind focused on the spirit, as if meeting one’s own true self. Strike the mallet evenly, beginning softly and increasing to full resonance, the number of strikes—twelve, twenty-four, or thirty-six—determined by the size of the assembly.

The *Scripture of the Royal One’s Former Deeds* says: when sounding the bell, don the proper Dharma-robes, approach the bell first, and take up the mallet. Recite the prayer: "The round mallet strikes the Dharma-bell, its sound flowing through the ten directions. Below, it penetrates the long night; above, it resounds in the jade chambers. The Nine Dark Realms hear and escape suffering; the Seven Ancestors ascend to the immortal halls." Strike thrice, for the yin number arises from two and is perfected in ten. Flick the bell ten times with the nail, producing the sound of long fangs, for the yang number arises from one and is perfected in nine. Then strike nine times, evoking the resonance of jade and jasper. The three strikes ascend to the Three Heavens—Clear Tenuity, Jade Clarity, and Great Redness; they resonate with the Three Realms—Formless, Form, and Desire; and they warn the Three Destinies—hell-dwellers, hungry ghosts, and animals. Three Heavens, Three Realms, Three Destinies—three threes make nine, hence nine strikes. Conclude with the "Gathering the Long Dharma," twenty-seven strikes: nine above for the Nine Heavenly Lords of the Dao, nine in the middle for the Nine True Emperors of the Nine Palaces, and nine below to summon the suffering souls of the Nine Dark Realms. Three final strikes, totaling thirty-six, ascend to the Thirty-Six Heavenly Emperors, resonate with the Thirty-Six Revered Scriptures, and penetrate the Thirty-Six Earthly Gates. If performed correctly, the left immortal youth records good deeds; if flawed, the right jade maiden records transgressions. Each is clearly noted, and violations incur hidden retribution.

The *Laws of the Mysterious Capital* states: if the chief lecturer fails to announce the proceedings, they shall self-impose a penalty of one catty of incense.

Now, those who have left the household life yet do not adhere to the regulated striking of the bell—entrusting the matter to subordinates while the master and preceptor lack proper standards—commit errors not only in the improper wearing of robes and footwear but also in the misalignment of tempo and rhythm. First, such conduct brings shame upon those who witness it; second, it distorts the mirror of discipline. Thus, diagrams and models are provided for others to follow, that future generations may have a rule to emulate.

*The Supervisor’s Manual for Vegetarian Feasts* states: The Dao is made manifest through sagely figures, and blessings are entrusted to human propagation. Without correction and reproof, there can be no adherence to canonical statutes.

*The Ritual Dignity for Vegetarian Feasts* says: One must earnestly encourage the negligent, reprove transgressions, and rectify faults—without partiality or favoritism, concealment or excess. Upholding the canonical regulations, one must ensure fairness and propriety.

For all ritual affairs depend upon the right persons. Without mutual refinement, how can precedents be established? One must adhere to the Dharma and not indulge personal sentiment.

*The Scripture of Ascending the Mystery* enumerates ten duties of the feast supervisor:
1. Instruct the host offering the feast to submit a formal request to the Dharma master three days prior, stating their aspirations, the location of the ritual, the names of those invited to the feast, and their Dao ranks. The Dharma master, upon receiving the request, shall immediately transcribe it and submit it to the supervisory officials.
2. Instruct the host to return home and inform those invited to the feast that the request has been submitted. They should each purify themselves, avoid sharing beds or seats with laypersons, and refrain from all evil and unwholesome conduct. From this point until the feast’s conclusion, they must guard their body, speech, and mind, adhering strictly to the precepts of the Most High.
3. Instruct the host not to steal offerings meant for spirits or purchase prepared food to serve the feast participants.
4. Instruct the host, upon encountering unusual persons who wish to attend the feast and listen to the scriptures, not to calculate the cost of food and drink or obstruct their participation.
5. Instruct the host, after submitting the request, to return home and burn incense and light lamps in a quiet chamber or the feast hall to await the supervisory officials, who shall descend to inspect.
6. Instruct the host not to decline the feast’s responsibilities or fail to provide for guests.
7. Instruct the host to arrange for the distribution of alms after the feast, according to their means—even a single coin or thread suffices to express sincerity.
8. Instruct the host not to wear loose belts or skirts as if serving as an attendant.
9. Instruct the host not to welcome the master upon arrival yet fail to see them off upon departure, for such inconsistency betrays a divided heart and forgetfulness of duty.
10. Instruct the host not to use the leftovers from the post-feast distribution to absolve spiritual debts, for this is greed and stinginess, lacking reverence and solemnity.

*The Laws of the Mysterious Capital* states: If the host, whether within or without, fails to inspect and reprove, or if their voice is loud and harsh, they shall be penalized five *sheng* of oil. If the host’s provisions are lacking, they shall be penalized two *sheng* of oil. If the supervisor, upon witnessing a fault, fails to reprove it due to private bias, they shall be penalized six *sheng* of oil. If they observe a deficiency but do not report it for supplementation, they shall be penalized three *sheng* of oil. If a feast participant engages in frivolous or vulgar speech, they shall be penalized one catty of incense, five *sheng* of oil, and three *liang* of cinnabar.

The statutes further decree: If one violates ritual dignity and refuses reproof, they shall be reported to the Three Treasures and expelled from the feast. If the reproof is unjust, the accuser shall be punished accordingly. If the presiding Dharma master becomes aware of their own fault, they must confess and rectify it; if they do not, the supervisor shall reprove them according to the Dharma. If a ritual is flawed, from the first to the third offense, the supervisor shall impose penalties accordingly. For offenses beyond the third, merits shall be revoked, and the transgressor shall be publicly denounced before their peers, barred from the Dharma seat. If the supervisor condones misconduct without reproof, they shall share the same penalty.

*The Attendant’s Manual for Incense* states: Water washes away dust, and incense dispels impurity. Through these hundred harmonies, trust is conveyed to the Three Clarities.

*The Ritual Dignity for Vegetarian Feasts* says: The duty of the incense attendant is to maintain the brazier with solemn order, ensuring fragrant smoke arises continuously. Let the smoke flow through the night and the fire burn through the day—this is the foremost task of ritual affairs, to be observed diligently at dawn and dusk.

*The Scripture of Fundamental Boundaries* states: Scatter celestial incense and flowers like falling snow, their fragrance delighting the hearts of all. It further says: Burn hundred-fold harmonies, the revered wind-borne incense, and scatter myriad varieties of celestial tree blossoms.

*The Scripture of Many Chapters* says: Fragrance flies to eight convergences, like lightning flashing and beacons rising. It further says: Golden youths waft incense, and lunar palaces scatter flowers.

*The Fixed Resolve* states: Hundred-fold treasured incense, though unburned, perfumes all.

*The Scripture of Ascending the Mystery* says: The fragrance of incense, sweet and pure, permeates the eight directions.

*The Preface to the Five Talismans* says: Burn hundred-fold incense to dispel impurity. It further says: Burn incense to invoke the Five Emperors, observing the direction of the fragrant smoke. If the smoke rises straight to the center, the Yellow Emperor descends first. If it flows eastward, the Blue Emperor descends first. If it flows southward, the Red Emperor descends first. If it flows westward, the White Emperor descends first. If it flows northward, the Black Emperor descends first.

*The Laws of the Mysterious Capital* states: After the morning and evening prostrations, burning incense on that day will extinguish calamities. Violations of this law incur a penalty of one *ji* of reckoning.

*The Laws of the Mysterious Capital* further states: If the incense fire is overturned, the penalty is two catties of incense. If the incense smoke is interrupted, the penalty is four catties of oil. If one rushes about while burning incense, the penalty is two catties of oil. If one handles incense without washing hands or rinsing the mouth, the penalty is two catties of oil.

*The Hidden Instructions for Ascending to Perfection* says: Incense is what celestial perfected beings use to communicate, and earthly spirits rely upon it to convey words. Thus, when praying or meditating, one must burn it to the left and right. This smoke can illuminate the mysterious and convey intent, and there are those who attend and protect, proclaiming the sincerity of the words. It further says: In establishing cities, counties, and high mounds, burning a single stone until it turns red ensures perpetual preservation. Burning incense with one *jiu* of this stone is truly economical and essential.

*The Attendant’s Manual for Lamps* states: Upon entering seclusion for a feast, lamps and candles take precedence, illuminating the eight gates and shining through the nine nights. Once the merit of continuous brightness is established, the blessings of enduring vigil may be cultivated.

*The Ritual Dignity of the Feast* states: Tending the lamps is one’s duty. The orchid-oil lamp gleams at dusk, binding brightness to the western sun; its flames blaze upon the altar ground, illuminating the pure night. Should rain arise, temporarily cease; if wind blows, briefly extinguish. Host and guest shall deliberate together, adapting to the occasion’s rise or decline—never suppress or sever, lest the ritual’s completion be diminished.

*The Hidden Instructions for Ascending to Perfection* says: The Perfected summon the radiance of the sun to illuminate, and command the essence of the moon to brighten the obscure.

*The Bright Code of the Four Poles* states: On the days of *Lichun* and the Spring Equinox, kindle nine lamps in the central courtyard; on *Lixia* and the Summer Solstice, kindle three lamps; on *Liqiu* and the Autumn Equinox, kindle seven lamps; on *Lidong* and the Winter Solstice, kindle five lamps; on one’s *benming* day, kindle twelve lamps. At midnight, expose the lamps beneath the open sky—facing east in spring, south in summer, west in autumn, north in winter, and toward *Tai Sui* on one’s *benming* day. Knock the teeth twenty-four times and pray:

"Supreme Perfected Ones, Ten Thousand Sage Emperors, Jade Lords of the Five Thearchs, and the Assembly of Immortal Overseers—today is auspicious and fine. The Eight Nodal Days unfold in array. Yang severs, Yin is examined, and the Nine Yin are extinguished. From this moment forth, may the Seven Mysteries be released, escaping the realm of fire, forever departing the Mountain of Knives. The Three Paths and Five Sufferings shall not burden this body. May I be as one with Heaven and Earth, eternally safeguarded by the Celestial Dawn. May the Five Vows and Eight Assemblies be fulfilled without fail."

Upon completion, remove the headscarf and bow one hundred and twenty times, pressing the forehead to the ground. Then, don the scarf again, face the heavens, and reflect: "Today, this body receives the grace of Heaven’s favor, bestowed with form and bones, to be reborn as a flying immortal." Swallow twenty-four breaths of *qi* while gazing upward. After three years of such practice, all past transgressions shall be eradicated. Body and Perfected shall become one, untouched by the Five Sufferings, escaping the realm of fire, attaining the rank of Perfected, and roaming the Jade Chambers in revelry. This is a wondrous formula—guard it well and do not lightly disclose it.

*The Golden Register’s Simplified Writs* says: To deliver beings from life and death, establish a feast in the central courtyard. The earthen altar shall be square in breadth. The upper altar measures twenty-four *chi*, the lower thirty-two *chi*, with four sides, four corners, and ten gates above and below, each gate five *chi* wide. Adorn with railings and inscribed plaques, modeling Heaven and Earth. At the altar’s center, place a long lampstand, nine *chi* in height, upon which nine lamps are kindled, their light shining upward to the Nine Heavens and downward to the Nine Netherworlds. Beyond the gates on all four sides, place nine lamps each, totaling thirty-six lamps to encircle the altar.

*The Golden Register’s Simplified Writs* states: Upon entering the hall for seclusion, once the lamps are lit, bow three times toward them and recite the incantation:

"True Unity’s yang radiance, flames of crimson smoke ascend. Twelve Lads of Illuminating Light, penetrating this dwelling and this body. A hundred evils shattered, ten thousand ghosts slain. Brilliance shines clear, communicating with the Perfected and reaching the numinous. Ascending into formlessness, merging with the Dao’s spontaneity."

Upon completion, withdraw from the hall. To extinguish the lamps, recite the incantation:

"Mysterious Yin seals the light, the long lamp continues to shine. The Great Yang has dawned, the Eight Might open clarity. The lamp connects to the Great Yin, its light clinging to the flourishing scene. The Two Perfected of Sun and Moon unite with me."

Then extinguish the flame.

On the *benming* day, kindle a lamp to illuminate the Seven *Po*; on the *xingnian* day, kindle a lamp to illuminate the Three *Hun*; on the *Tai Sui* day, kindle a lamp to illuminate the whole body; on the *da mu* day, kindle a lamp to illuminate the decayed remains; on the *xiao mu* day, kindle a lamp to illuminate the Great Yin; before the hall, kindle seven lamps to illuminate the Seven Generations; in the central courtyard, kindle nine lamps to illuminate the Nine Netherworlds; beside the gates, kindle two lamps to illuminate the palace and dwelling; at the Earth Gate, kindle twenty-four lamps to illuminate the Twenty-Four Vital *Qi*; in the eight directions, kindle eight lamps to illuminate the Eight Trigrams; at the center, kindle nine lamps to illuminate the Nine Palaces; at the Heavenly Gate, kindle ten lamps to illuminate the Ten Directions; kindle twenty-eight lamps to illuminate the Twenty-Eight Constellations; kindle thirty-two lamps to illuminate the Thirty-Two Heavens; kindle five lamps to illuminate the Five Marchmounts.

*The Golden Register’s Simplified Writs* says: The ritual dignity of kindling lamps is of utmost merit, illuminating all Heavens above and brightening all Earth below. For eight directions and nine nights, all shall behold the radiant light. The attendants of the lamps must apply diligent care, ensuring the lamps’ glow persists through the night.

*The Ritual of the Luminous Perfected* states: In the central courtyard, kindle nine lamps upon a pole to illuminate the Nine Netherworlds. On the four sides of the altar, kindle nine lamps each, totaling thirty-six lamps. Expose the scriptures in the central courtyard, circumambulate the Nine Netherworlds, lamps burning and incense wafting, as the Dao is revered and repentance made.

*The Yellow Register’s Simplified Writs* says: Kindle ninety spirit lamps.

*The Bright Perfected Code* states: In times of disaster or urgency, inscribe five talismans of the Perfected Writs in cinnabar upon the central courtyard, placing one in each of the five directions. Offer five *liang* of gold and five dragon servants to stabilize the five talismans, and five-colored silken pledges to secure the Five Thearchs. In spring, kindle nine lamps—or ninety, or nine hundred; in summer, kindle three lamps—or thirty, or three hundred; in autumn, kindle seven lamps—or seventy, or seven hundred; in winter, kindle five lamps—or fifty, or five hundred; in the months of the four seasons, kindle twelve lamps—or one hundred twenty, or one thousand two hundred. At the center, erect a long pole and kindle nine lamps upon it.

*The Statutes of the Mysterious Capital* says: If the lamp or fire is extinguished while tending, offer one *jin* of incense; if the lamp or candle is overturned, forfeit five *sheng* of oil.

Jurist of the Three Caverns, Zhu Faman, *On Robes and Attire*

To transcend the dust-laden world and take refuge within the fortress of the Dao, one must diligently cultivate morning and night, forsaking the crooked to return to the upright. Only with pure ritual vestments may one pay homage to the Perfected; how can one approach the sacred with soiled or defiled garments?

Thus, the coarse robe mirrors the sun and moon, while the mantle embodies the raiment of qi and destiny. In all comings and goings, one must uphold reverence and dignity. A single lapse by one may corrupt the entire assembly of practitioners, and in this age of frivolity and deceit, from where shall we draw our standards?

Yet in these times, some treat their pure robes with careless disdain, or lend their ritual vestments to others. They sit upon the ground and stain them with mud, or use them as mats in place of felt. Such conduct leaves the divine youths without protection and evokes gasps of dismay from both Daoists and laity. Even a disheveled turban or cap brings reproach upon those nearby—how much more so when one dons the robes of the Dao while behaving like a monkey or ape!

*The Statutes of the Thousand Perfected* states: The demeanor of Daoist assemblies must be solemn and orderly. Robes must be kept immaculate, and conduct must be exemplary, so that good intentions arise in the world and the heavens themselves sing their praises. But if one’s appearance is slovenly and displeasing to the assembly, one is unfit to receive offerings, bringing disgrace upon the Dao and its teachings. This is a failing of the precious Dao and severs the seed of great compassion. Yet if one’s conduct and bearing inspire admiration, the precious Dao shines forth, and the gateway of the Dao finds its rightful place.

The statutes further decree: The standard attire consists of a long Chinese robe with wide sleeves, distinct from secular dress. One must not wear the same garments as laypeople—no fur-lined robes, leather boots, or horn-handled utensils. All implements must be plain and lacquered, never adorned with gold, silver, or bronze. When engaging in ritual practice or paying homage to the host of sages, one must don the proper vestments of dignity, arranged according to rank. For *Shangqing* practitioners, robes are purple; for *Lingbao*, they are yellow; for *Sanwu*, they are crimson. When not performing rituals, robes may be of undyed yellow cloth, but one must not wear brocade, damask, or embroidered silks to dazzle the vulgar. Female officiants, moreover, must not adorn themselves with gold or jade hairpins or bracelets, nor with floral patterns or cosmetics—first, because such things offend the Dao, and second, because they betray a lack of reverence.

*The Statutes of the Supreme Perfected* states: Do not covet fine, smooth, ornate, or rare fabrics, nor precious jeweled crowns or tassels. One should wear only the proper vestments of the Dao, coarse and simple. They must be clean enough to cover the body but not overly large; sufficient to ward off the cold but not excessively thick.

Should a vestment have been laundered thrice, it must then be given to another.

*The Statutes of the Four Luminaries* states: The ritual mantle should measure four feet and nine inches in width, corresponding to the number of the four seasons; five feet and five inches in length, aligning with the qi of Heaven and Earth. Its lining is blue, its outer layer purple. It must comprise twenty-four complete inner strips and fifteen complete outer strips, totaling thirty-nine strips inside and out, to correspond to the thirty-nine stations of the Perfected Emperors. Thus, when one’s person bears the insignia of the Emperor Sovereign, one is fit to don the vestments of the Emperor Sovereign. Without such vestments, one must not rashly handle the sacred scriptures. Should one chant even a single line, the sound will resound through the Nine Heavens, the Ten Thousand Emperors will descend to their thrones, and the Nine Perfected will take their places—such resonance is not to be taken lightly. To recite scriptures in a single-layered robe invites demonic intrusion, the clamor of myriad spirits, the loss of one’s spirit, and the dispersal of one’s qi. Death will consign one to the Dark Springs, where the hun and po will endure hardship, barred from entry into immortality.

Those who possess such ritual vestments with their august insignia are attended by twelve jade lads and twelve jade maidens, who guard and serve the Perfected. These vestments must not be lent to others, nor defiled by impurity or disrespect. Even when encountering worldly dignitaries, one must not converse with them from a seated position—how much less, then, when paying homage to the Perfected and the Divine Sovereigns, should one presume to address them from a seat. To do so incurs a hundred days of unseen punishment. If one meets another on the road without a mat, one may perform obeisance on the ground. When prostrating on the ground, the hands should reach the earth, the fingers bent so that the backs of the fingers touch the ground, preventing dust from soiling the palms—this is called "guarding purity." This is the "Fourfold Illumination of the Heart" prostration.

It is further said: An *Ascended Mystery* Dharma Master may perform the "prostration of the heart" at dawn and dusk, without needlessly subjecting the body to wind and dust. At the six periods of the day—dawn, noon, sunset, nightfall, midnight, and cockcrow—one should sit upright facing east, west, south, or north, closing the eyes and clicking the teeth, as if in the presence of the ritual assembly. Turning the mind toward each direction in contemplation, one prostrates in thought and word, which suffices to summon the descent of the Heavenly Perfected.

*The Statutes of Illuminating the Perfected* states: The Dao of great compassion is a boundless field of merit. Bowing in reverence, knocking the head to the ground, and offering words of humility and gratitude—when the cinnabar heart and intent are fully engaged, and sincerity is complete, the response will be naturally felt. If the body is weary and unable to prostrate fully, one may perform the "prostration of the heart" to the Heavenly Perfected, sparing oneself the strain of physical submission. To feign external devotion while the heart is negligent is merely to exhaust the body in ritual without purpose. For those of true faith, when heart and mouth align, the offering of incense and the vow of reverence ascend to the various heavens, dissolving both the sins of this life and the karmic retributions of past lives. This applies to the rites for the elderly and infirm.

The young and able, however, often hear these precepts yet pay them no heed. First, this breeds arrogance; second, it fails to set an example for others; third, it disregards the diligence and effort required; and fourth, it reflects a lack of faith and reverence.

*The Yellow Register Simplified Writs* states: During the act of prostration, one bows nine times to the east, twelve times to the southeast, three times to the south, twelve times to the southwest, seven times to the west, twelve times to the northwest, five times to the north, twelve times to the northeast, twelve times to the nadir, thirty-two times to the zenith, three times to the Palace of the Sun, seven times to the Palace of the Moon, nine times to the constellations, and twice to the Five Peaks. This is but a brief outline for a single retreat; all retreats rely on prostration as their essential practice. Each should be performed with upright posture—how else can one manifest dignity and decorum?

*The Scripture on Stabilizing the Will* states: To knock the head to the ground until blood flows in great quantity—even this must not cease. Such is the practice for the young and able. Whether sitting or rising, one must adhere to the prescribed forms.

In the pursuit of the Dao and the veneration of the Perfected, the order of precedence, movement, sitting, leaning, and standing must follow canonical decorum. Without proper rank and position, the ritual order falls into disarray.

*The Statutes of the Thousand Perfected* states: When entering an assembly and sitting or rising, all must adhere to the proper forms. When sitting, men should first place the left foot forward, aligning the shoe near the edge of the platform, then bring the right foot forward, gently pressing the hands against the platform. When rising, first lower the left foot to retrieve the shoe, then the right, standing with measured composure. Women should first place the right foot forward.

When entering the hall, first stand outside the door to adjust one’s garments, tablet, robe, and mantle. Face east, gather the ritual implements, and contemplate the assembly within as if it were the Ten Directions’ Heavenly Worthies, the host of Perfected who have attained the Dao, the present king, and the prefectural and county magistrates. When entering the hall, if there are two doors—east and west—enter from the side corresponding to one’s seat. If seated to the west of the door, enter from the west; if seated to the east, enter from the east. One must not cross paths at the doorway.

*The Statutes of the Mysterious Capital* states: Daoist priests and nuns, when attending or departing from a retreat, must inform the retreat supervisor and bow once to the Dharma Master, then bow three times to the scripture hall before leaving. Upon returning, the same forms apply. Violations incur a penalty of one catty of incense. If one sits improperly in the retreat hall, the penalty is half a tael of cinnabar. If one sits or rises without grace and measured steps, the penalty is one catty of incense. If one moves out of turn, the penalty is half a catty of incense. If the chanting of auspicious verses is not in unison, the penalty is five sheng of oil. If one sits or rises without proper bowing and yielding, the penalty is half a catty of incense.

The statutes further state: If, during a retreat, one leaves for personal matters and fails to return, and this is reported by the assembly, the penalty is one sheng of oil. If, while conducting the ritual, one speaks with outsiders, the penalty is one catty of incense. If one’s hair is unbound or one walks hastily, the penalty is one catty of incense.

The statutes state: A *Great Cavern* Dharma Master must not share a meal with laypeople, for to do so offends the spirits of the body. Violations incur fifty days of unseen illness.

*The Golden Register Simplified Writs* states: When attending a retreat and arranging seating, the decorum for sitting and rising is as follows: If the Dharma Master’s seat is in the west, he faces east, while the disciples’ seats are arranged to the south, facing north. If the Dharma Master’s seat is in the south, he faces north, while the disciples’ seats are arranged to the east, facing west. If the Dharma Master’s seat is in the east, he faces west, while the disciples’ seats are arranged to the north, facing south.

If the Dharma Master’s seat is in the north, he faces south, while the disciples’ seats are arranged to the west, facing east. The Dharma Master and disciples must not sit on the same side.

It further states: In sitting and rising, precedence is determined by rank. If ranks are equal, precedence is given to seniority in age; if ages are equal, precedence is given to virtue and power.

It further states: When observing the decorum for sitting and rising, if it is time to rise, the disciples must first descend and stand to the west, facing the master, before stepping down from their seats. When returning, the master first ascends to his seat, and the disciples take their places, bow once, and then sit.

*The Yellow Register Simplified Writs* states: In the decorum for revering the scriptures, when entering or leaving the scripture chamber, one must always bow toward the scripture hall upon arrival and departure, announcing one’s movements. Violations are adjudicated by the Supervisory Office.

*The Sutra of Esoteric Teachings* states: In the order of sitting and rising, the five qi are arranged as follows: first, the upper central qi; next, the orthodox governance; then, the inner governance; then, the separate governance and dispersed qi; then, the Register of One Hundred Fifty Generals; then, the Register of Seventy-Five Generals; then, the tally of Ten Generals; then, the youths; then, the immortal officials; then, the upper numinous officials; and finally, the night watchmen. If those receiving the teachings are of the same rank, precedence is given to those who received it earlier, with later recipients ranked below. Men and women must not be intermingled. If those wearing the registers of generals of the same rank received them on the same day, precedence is determined by the order in which they embraced the Dao.

*The Hidden Instructions for Ascending to Perfection* states: If men and women share the same mat to sit or rest, their offenses are recorded in the Northern Mystery. If they commit defilement, calamity befalls their three generations of ancestors.

*The Decorum of the Ascending Mystery* states: A Dharma Master must not sit in a seat lower than others, except when compelled by superior power. When an Ascending Mystery Dharma Master sits or rises, he must defer to his original master, except when receiving the teachings. An Ascending Mystery Dharma Master must not associate or interact with base and vulgar people, except when traveling together for the practice of the Dao.

*The Sutra of the Ascending Mystery* states: During retreat assemblies and the practice of the Dao, no Orthodox Unity Daoist may share the same mat with an Highest Clarity Great Cavern Dharma Master. A Highest Clarity Great Cavern Dharma Master may not share the same mat with a Five Chapters Numinous Treasure Dharma Master, nor transmit or exchange clothing and items. A Numinous Treasure Five Chapters Dharma Master, in turn, may not share the same mat with an Ascending Mystery Esoteric Teaching Dharma Master.

*The Ritual for Mourning Attire of Alliance Dharma Masters* states: In receiving the teachings, one progresses from lower to higher ranks, each with its proper order. For those who receive the registers of governance, the Five Natural Methods of Lord Lao, the Middle Alliance, the Great Alliance, and Highest Clarity, Highest Clarity is the ultimate rank. There is no mourning attire prescribed for the Ascending Mystery, so they follow the Ascending Mystery attire system. For the Great Alliance and Highest Clarity, a one-evening mourning period is observed. The duration of mourning clearly reflects the hierarchy. Thus, it is evident that, according to the *Sutra of the Ascending Mystery* alone, it is uniquely esteemed as the highest.

*Supervising the Retreat Manual* states: When attending a retreat and partaking in meals, one must be meticulous in conduct. Even in handling broth and holding bowls, one must maintain decorum. When holding chopsticks and spoons, all movements must be measured and deliberate.

*The Sutra of the Ascending Mystery* states: The Most High commanded the Supervisor of the Lingyang Kitchen to inspect meals according to ten principles: first, reflect on the grace of the Dao; second, reflect on the grace of the master; third, reflect on the assembly as a field of blessed merit...

Fourth, reflect on the host’s discernment in distinguishing truth from falsehood, and their ability to provide for the worthy and good.

Fifth, rejoice in being counted among the retinue, fully partaking in the Dao’s current.

Sixth, reflect on the host’s earnest intent in offering the meal; do not allow others to lightly criticize its quality or reject it out of dislike.

Seventh, if the host provides food that is not in accordance with the Dao, do not allow it to be served.

Eighth, if anyone among the assembly requests food that is not in accordance with the Dao, immediately dismiss them and exclude them from the meal.

Ninth, ensure that all, from the highest to the lowest, observe proper order and sequence.

Tenth, do not fear eating later; adjustments may be made as needed.

*The Regulations of the Thousand Perfected* states: During an ordinary retreat, one supervisor of the kitchen shall first inspect the head cook, ensuring that fruits, vegetables, and seasonings are properly prepared, and that the flavors of raw and cooked dishes are well-balanced. Next, they shall observe the time by the gnomon’s shadow, or by the water clock if the sky is overcast.

At the proper time for the retreat meal, when the hour arrives, the bell is rung to summon the assembly. Each person brings their eating utensils to the refectory and arranges them according to their seated position. Once the utensils are set and the bell is silenced, the ritual of circumambulation and invocation begins. After the invocation concludes, all sit in their places. Water is passed once around the assembly, and then the meal begins. Order is maintained according to rank, with the first offering placed before the master. The kitchen supervisor kneels and presents the dish before the master’s seat. A single strike of the chime signals the assembly, and the senior adept recites the invocation:

*"This retreat is established for the Perfected of the Dao, for the seeds of the Dao, the fathers and mothers of the Dao, the Perfected, the Divine, the Immortals, and the Sages. Together we cultivate the Dao and partake in this meal, that we may attain boundless longevity."*

When the invocation ends, the dish is placed before the master’s seat, followed by the meal for the retreat officials. The server softly announces the names of each dish—fruits, vegetables, and grains—so that the assembly may receive them with their utensils. If one does not wish to partake, they should not take from the senior adept. All should observe the food as it is passed, completing the full circuit. Another strike of the chime signals: *"Please begin the meal."* The assembly sits in solemn order, without speech or laughter, to partake.

While eating, one must not smack their lips, make sounds of enjoyment, spit, sigh, or clatter utensils. The senior adept eats slowly. During the serving of the meal, each action is performed three times, proceeding in order of rank. When the meal concludes, utensils are collected from the lowest to the highest. Food is only received at the proper time; no one may demand it out of turn.

As the meal nears its end, the leftover rice is gathered to be scattered for all beings. No one except the kitchen supervisor may take anything from the kitchen. If the meal is insufficient, one must descend from the hall to eat. Forcing entry into the refectory is called "offending the meal." If one finishes eating before the assembly and rises abruptly, it is called "startling the seat and offending the assembly."

For an ordinary retreat without a master’s offering, the invocation for the master is omitted. After the invocation for all beings concludes, water is passed once more, and utensils are collected. A single strike of the chime signals: *"The meal has concluded. Each may retire to rest as they finish."* The senior adept then collects the utensils in order and returns to their quarters to wash and rinse. The kitchen supervisor ensures no one remains behind. If any rule is violated, the offender is penalized with twenty prostrations before the assembly.

For meals offered by laypeople, the procedures for sitting, rising, and receiving food remain the same. However, when receiving fruit, one must accept it all without selection, lest the layperson feel criticized. After the meal, any remaining fruit is placed before the assembly. A single strike of the chime signals the announcement: *"The assembly’s leftover food is offered for the host’s unrestricted use."* Those who agree remain silent; those who disagree may speak three times. After the announcement, if the retreat official has parents, a master, or elderly or ill individuals, they may take the remaining fruit, rising to announce: *"So-and-so has parents, a master, or elderly or ill individuals at home and wishes to take this fruit to offer to the senior adept."* The senior adept replies: *"Take it with blessing."* If no such need exists, the host collects the fruit for their own unrestricted use.

Someone may ask: *"Should rice be set aside for all beings during the meal?"*
The answer: *"In the world of abandoned worthies, at the beginning of the Primordial Origin, the Perfected of the Dao were commanded to propagate the teachings. They tasted the hundred herbs and discovered the five grains to sustain humanity. All hungry ghosts lack the merit of cultivation. During the meal, seven grains of rice are set aside to repay the virtue of the Perfected and offer them to all beings. This is called 'Shennong’s rice' or 'the rice of all beings.' A single grain can satiate a being for a thousand days."*

Three invocations are recited for the offering of this rice:
First:
*"Today is an auspicious day,
We fast and face the Most High.
At the midday meal from the celestial kitchen,
The host’s blessings are boundless."*

Second:
*"The Two Mysteries ascend the Dao,
The Four Poles are pure and numinous.
The Supreme Unity, the Lord Emperor,
And the hundred spirits are at peace.
They receive sustenance in the Three Palaces,
Irrigating the spirit of the spleen.
They ascend to feast on the Great Harmony,
Partaking of the five fragrances.
The life of the soul and embryo,
The seven fluids flow and settle.
The hundred passages are harmonized,
The five viscera bloom with radiance.
The Twin Sovereigns merge with the light,
Soaring to ascend the Upper Clarity."*

Third:
*"Diligently cultivate the great Dao’s law,
With a refined heart, move the Supreme Darkness.
The Perfected descend, demons and specters retreat,
All malevolent spirits vanish in form.
Seven generations of ancestors are born in the Southern Palace,
The self ascends to the Upper Clarity.
Blessings are universally bestowed,
This food is offered to all beings."*

Two invocations are recited for congee:
First:
*"Today is pure,
Partaking of the immortals’ sustenance.
Incense is offered, congee is eaten,
Lifespan is extended."*

Second:
*"The Qian trigram is firm and beneficial,
The body enters the Dharma King.
Congee enters the belly,
The five viscera are cooled."*

The invocation for rinsing the mouth:
*"Rinsing with willow twigs,
The eyes and vision become clear.
May I obtain one branch
To offer to the Great Dao.
The Dao resides in one tree,
With many leaves and much fragrance.
May I obtain one branch
To offer to the ten directions."*

*The Sutra of the Ascending Mystery* states: *"After midday, one must not eat food containing the qi of grains."*

Those containing the *qi* of grains may not be consumed with near-mouth water, jade fat stone, pine wood, Solomon’s seal, cloud essence, *lingfei* powder, or wolfberry. These medicinal foods may be taken at any time and are not subject to prohibition.

*The Sutra of the Essential Teachings* states: *"At dawn, one eats congee; at midday, one meal. Thereafter, water must not pass the teeth."*

*The Regulations of the Thousand Perfected* states: *"When partaking in a fast, five matters must be observed: first, one should pace according to the shadow of the sundial; second, strike the bell to assemble the assembly; third, perform ablutions with water; fourth, sound the chime before eating; fifth, recite the invocation for the ancestral masters. If these five matters are not performed, the fast is not pure, and the meal is considered stolen."*

The regulations state: *"All who enter the fast must adhere to established rules. If a prior agreement is made for three *dou*, it may not be increased or decreased—decreasing constitutes theft, and taking more is likewise theft. When distributing food, fruits and vegetables and above must not be taken in excess. If one greedily takes more, this also constitutes theft. When distributing food, the senior must consider the needs of the junior and take only what is necessary."*

*The Sutra of the Ascending Mystery* states: *"Superiors and inferiors must regard one another with mutual care."*

The regulations state: *"The Dao’s method is impartial, making no distinction between intimacy or estrangement, nor between high or low. Dwelling together in one assembly, protection and care must be without bias. If individuals act out of personal sentiment, granting requests as they arise, this neglects the assembly, leading to its ruin. All should be cautious of this."*

The regulations state: *"If, during a fast, a layperson comes to beg for food, the kitchen supervisor must inquire whether they can observe the fast. If they can, food is given; if not, the consequences of cause and effect are explained, so they may understand sin and blessing. This is not out of stinginess but to guide them toward awakening, strictly upholding the Dao’s method. This is the foremost act of compassion. If no explanation is given, beings incur guilt."*

The regulations state: *"When establishing a Daoist sanctuary, all must partake in the communal meal. When the fast is observed and offerings are made, all directions share equally. The chime is struck and the bell is rung to summon the assembly. Those not observing the fast may not partake in this meal. Together, they cultivate blessings and goodness, with no barrier between Daoists and laypersons. To restrict guests or close the door is a shared disgrace."*

If asked, *"The food is limited, yet guests are unrestricted. Without divine powers, how can we provide for all?"* The answer is: *"Hosts and guests must mutually accommodate. If the original offering is meager and the guests numerous, it is permissible to divide equally, reducing portions to share. This is human nature; one should not refuse outright."*

The regulations state: *"To take communal food for private gifting or to divert it to one’s own quarters is considered theft."*

The regulations state: *"Communal property is shared by all directions, mutually entrusted across a hundred generations. It may not be arbitrarily used at will, nor may one act without collective restraint, diverting it for private use. Such actions incur the five rebellious sins."*

The regulations state: *"To steal communal fasting offerings or, as a leader, appropriate them for oneself is to fall into the Hell of Fire Pits, from which one emerges only after ten thousand kalpas, then enters Fengdu for sixty years of torment, thereafter becoming a hungry ghost for eternity."*

**Notes on Dietary Prohibitions and Admonitions**

To secure well-being, one must first rely on food and breath. While food nourishes the five viscera, it may also harm the six bowels. By adhering to prohibitions and admonitions, one may honor life.

*Master Lao’s Scripture on Nurturing Life* states: *"When eating, take care not to consume food that is scalding hot, lest sweat drip into the meal and harm the body. When eating cold food, do not let the teeth ache; when eating hot food, do not scorch the lips. After eating, rub the abdomen three hundred times to dispel the hundred diseases. Mercury must not be ingested, as it severs teeth and hair, causing swelling and tooth loss. Alum must not be taken as medicine, for it ruptures the heart and liver. Cinnamon must not be chewed daily, as it damages bones and tendons. On an empty stomach, one must not encounter foul corpses, for corpse *qi* enters the spleen, causing a white film to form on the tongue and chronic bad breath. Wine may be drunk upon encountering such. Eating hot food while chilled causes piercing wind. Washing the hair after a full meal causes head wind. Covering food with copper vessels allows sweat to drip into the meal, causing malignant sores and internal abscesses. After eating hot food, do not wash the face, lest the complexion fade and one feel as though insects crawl upon it. Do not gulp water hastily, lest it cause *qi* illness and watery accumulations, forming masses. Do not lie down immediately after eating, lest it cause *qi* illness, back pain, and injury. Eating to sudden fullness when hungry reverses the flow, causing heart confusion and food accumulations. Galloping after a full meal causes heart masses over time; drinking water after galloping harms the heart, leading to chronic heart pain; running after a full meal causes *qi* illness over time. Do not habitually drink from mountain springs or flowing streams, lest it cause goiter. After eating, one must move about to circulate the hundred vessels. Salt harms the sinews, sourness harms the bones, bitterness harms the heart—none should be consumed in excess. Great thirst obstructs the flow of *qi*; great fullness prevents *qi* from being stored. Do not eat raw food, lest it harm the intestines and stomach; cold food harms the bladder; excessive eating blocks the hundred vessels. Hot food harms the intestines; cold food harms the stomach. Do not consume excessive sour honey. When passing water, do not drink if your reflection is not visible in the liquid. Peaches, being sour, cause heat when eaten in excess. Apricots, being sour, harm the sinews and bones and shorten lifespan. Pears, being bitter, cause cold in the center and harm those with metal wounds or women in childbirth. Cherries, being sweet, harmonize the center and benefit the spleen’s *qi*. Grapes, being sweet, treat water in the intestines, harmonize the center, and benefit urination. Wine made from them, when consumed over time, unblocks the waterways. Scallions, being pungent, benefit the sick, dispel cold and heat, and when pounded and applied to metal wounds, remove heat and water *qi*. Alfalfa, being sweet, may be consumed over time to benefit people. Smartweed and mustard, being pungent, dispel kidney *qi* and cause cold when consumed over time. Barley, being sour, causes heat when eaten. Elm seeds, being pungent, dispel evil and, when consumed over time, harmonize the five viscera and kill intestinal parasites."*

Wheat, being sweet, dispels heat and removes intestinal heat;
Rice, being sweet, causes excessive heat in the body;
Soybeans make the body heavy and generate excessive heat;
Turnip, also called *luófú*, being bitter, benefits the five viscera, lightens the body, and augments *qi*.

**The Ninth Chapter of the *Jiujing* of the Daoist Precepts and Rituals**
**The Tenth Chapter of the *Zhao* of the Daoist Precepts and Rituals**
Compiled by the Three Caverns Daoist Master Zhu Faman

**The First Treatment: The Treatment of the Hall**
The first treatment is the hall. To purify the hall, one must first mend its flaws, then settle its influence upon the human heart below and align it with the stars above. Each constructed hall must follow its prescribed rituals.

The *Taizhen Ke* states:
*"Establish the Hall of the Celestial Master, with a square foundation of eighty-one paces, following the nine-nine calculation, to elevate the yang *qi*."*

The central hall is named *Chongxu Hall*, with one courtyard, seven frameworks, six rooms, and twelve *zhang* in span. Above the hall’s main structure, in the central two rooms, construct a single-tiered *Chongxuan Platform*.

At the center of the platform, install a great incense burner, five *chi* in height, to perpetually burn incense.

Open three doors—east, west, and south—with windows beside each door. At both ends, construct horse paths. Beneath the southern door and above the eaves, set up a platform for the descendants of the Celestial Master to receive morning rites.

The eight great halls: those Daoists dwelling in mountain asceticism, aiding the world, may ascend the platform to pay homage. All other officials—great or small, inner or outer *sacrificial officers*—gather in the grand hall and pay homage from below.

Twelve *zhang* north of the *Chongxuan Platform*, construct the *Chongxian Hall*, with seven rooms, fourteen *zhang* in span, and seven frameworks. The east side is the *Yangxian Chamber*, the west side the *Yinxian Chamber*.

South of the *Chongxuan Platform*, twelve *zhang* away and near the southern gate, construct a five-room, three-frame gatehouse.

The eastern door of the gatehouse serves as the residence of the *Xuanwei Sacrificial Officer*;
The western room of the gatehouse serves as the residence of the *Chashu Sacrificial Officer* overseeing *qi* inspection.

The remaining small residences—too numerous to list—follow this pattern in the twenty-four halls.

The Precept states:
*"Through prolonged study and accumulated virtue, one receives the mandate to become the Celestial Master, appointing two thousand four hundred male and female sacrificial officers, each leading households and transforming the people. The yin officials are called *luozhi*, the yang officials are called *zaishou*."*

It is further said:
*"Each household must establish a *Jingchongyang* altar, offering five *dou* of rice to nurture the transformative forces and harmonize the five *xing* energies. The household register is inscribed upon the rice, renewed annually according to the assembly."*

On the first day of the tenth month, gather at the Celestial Master’s Hall to deliver the rice to the *Tiancang* (Celestial Granary) and the fifty-*li* watchtowers, to prevent famine and the hardships of travelers in years of scarcity. Travelers need not bring provisions.

It is further said:
*"On the first day of the tenth month, those who gather to deliver rice to the Celestial Master’s Hall do so because, at the beginning of the tenth month, the primordial yang *qi* of the Great Sun begins to generate, thus commanding humans to receive the mandate of life."*

On the fifth day of the tenth month, at dawn, assemble at the Celestial Master’s Hall. All must line up before the hall, facing north and kneeling in submission, as the hall’s overseer proclaims the precepts and prohibitions. No private carrying of impure food is permitted, nor defiling the hall’s purity at its gates.

The fifth day of the tenth month is for registering births.

On the seventh day of the seventh month, the *Zhonghui* assembly is held to register life records and assess the achievements of inner and outer Daoists in harmonizing the ritual *qi*.

On the seventh day of the first month, officials are promoted in the *Cihui* assembly, and rewards are bestowed for merit and advancement.

It is further said:
*"Those who enter the hall with laziness, neglecting filial piety and failing to heed the overseer’s instruction, shall be admonished;*
*Those who arrive at the hall with improper conduct, speaking without restraint, or violating orders, shall be punished with the four penalties."*

**The Second Treatment: The Second Treatment**

**The Treatments of Dao/Way**

The *ke* (precepts) states:
The *Shan* (Mountain) Treatment, the *Zhongmào* (Bell) Treatment, the *Báishí* (White Stone) Treatment, and the *Gānghù* (Gang Mutual) Treatment—these four are called *pǐn* (grades), and are known as *bièzhì* (Distinct Treatments) when practiced externally, and *bèizhì* (Comprehensive Treatments) when practiced internally, totaling twenty-four. However, the Comprehensive Treatments are twenty-eight in number.

The Distinct Treatments differ from the *Sān Bā* (Three Eights) Treatments: the *Jíyáng* (auspicious yang) Treatment, the *Píngdū* (leveling) Treatment, the *Āféng* (encountering) Treatment, the *Címǔ* (benevolent mother) Treatment, the *Huángjīn* (yellow gold) Treatment, the *Tàihuá* (great transformation) Treatment, the *Qīngchéng* (green city) Treatment, and the *Éméi* (elegant allure) Treatment—these eight are called *yóuzhì* (wandering treatments);

The *Dàiyuán* (substitute primal) Treatment, the *Zūnlǐng* (gourd leader) Treatment, the *Làixiāng* (lazy village) Treatment, the *Gōngmù* (revered mother) Treatment, the *Pínggōng* (leveling reverence) Treatment, the *Kēlǐ* (preceptal) Treatment, the *Jièruǎn* (borrowed oblation) Treatment—these eight are called *pèizhì* (paired treatments).

The *Zhèngzhì* (Rectified Treatments) number twenty-four:
The *Běimáng* (northern tomb) Treatment, the *Yùjú* (jade district) Treatment, the *Zhǔbù* (master register) Treatment, the *Pínggāng* (leveling ridge) Treatment, the *Gōngmù* (revered mother) Treatment, the *Hòuchéng* (rear city) Treatment, the *Jiǎnkǒu* (junction mouth) Treatment, and the *Yúntái* (cloud platform) Treatment—these eight are the lower-grade *zhì* (treatments);

The *Pínggài* (leveling canopy) Treatment, the *Méngqín* (mysterious Qin) Treatment, the *Běnzhú* (root bamboo) Treatment, the *Chóujīng* (dense glutinous rice) Treatment, the *Běipíng* (northern leveling) Treatment, the *Yǒngquán* (gushing spring) Treatment, the *Lìshàng* (rite above) Treatment, and the *Chānglì* (prosperous benefit) Treatment—these eight are the middle-grade *zhì* (treatments);

The *Zhēnduō* (true abundance) Treatment, the *Qínzhōng* (Qin central) Treatment, the *Gēngchú* (replacement elimination) Treatment, the *Gězuǒ* (hemp rags) Treatment, the *Líyuán* (flowing Yuan) Treatment, the *Hèmíng* (crane's cry) Treatment, the *Lùtáng* (deer hall) Treatment, and the *Yángpíng* (yang leveling) Treatment—these eight are the upper-grade *zhì* (treatments).

These forty-four external *zhì* (treatments) are received with the offering of a single garment, straw sandals, paper, ink, brushes, and a book-knife.

The *Xīngsù* (Star Host) Treatment, numbering twenty-eight, is also called the *Shàngzhì* (Upper Treatment), the *Dàzhì* (Great Treatment), and the *Zhèngzhì* (Rectified Treatment). Established on the seventh day of the seventh month in the first year of *Shànghuáng* (Upper Emperor), by the *Tàishàng Dàdào Jūn* (Great Dao/Way Lord Above), and transmitted by *Dàodòng* (Dao/Way Ridge) for propagation.

The Three Treatments' jurisdictions:
The Three Treatments' jurisdictions are as follows: the *Yángpíng* (yang leveling), *Lùtáng* (deer hall), and *Hèmíng* (crane’s cry) Treatments, which oversee those born under the *chén* (hour) of *shēng* (birth).

The *Lìyuán* (Lì Element) and *Gěguī* (Gě’s Splendor) Treatments—these two oversee those born in the *mǎo* (hour).
The *Gēngchú* (Renewal Removal) and *Qínzhōng* (Qin Central) Treatments oversee those born in the *yín* (hour).
The *Zhēnduō* (True Abundance) and *Chānglì* (Flourishing Profit) Treatments, subordinate to the three upper Treatments, oversee those born in the *chǒu* (hour).
The *Yǒngquán* (Gushing Spring) and *Běimáng* (Northern Tomb) Treatments oversee those born in the *zǐ* (hour).
The *Chóujīng* (Dense Rice) and *Běnzhú* (Original Bamboo) Treatments oversee those born in the *hài* (hour).
The *Méngqín* (Mysterious Qin) and *Pínggài* (Leveling Cover) Treatments oversee those born in the *xū* (hour).

The next eight Treatments:
The *Xuánlǎo* (Mysterious Elder) and *Yúntái* (Cloud Platform) Treatments oversee those born in the *xū* (hour);
The *Jìkǒu* (Mouth of the River) and *Hòuchéng* (Rear City) Treatments oversee those born in the *yǒu* (hour);
The *Gōngmù* (Public Admiration) and *Pínggāng* (Level Ridge) Treatments oversee those born in the *shēn* (hour);
The *Zhǔbù* (Chief Clerk) and *Yùjú* (Jade Bureau) Treatments—this one Treatment is not of the Mountain Remnant, but of the Northern Tomb—three Treatments oversee those born in the *wèi* (hour).

The lower eight Treatments:
The *Tàishàng* (Supreme) Treatment was established by the *Tàishàng* (Supreme) on the seventh day of the first month, *Hàn’ān* era’s second year, at noon, when the twenty-four Treatments were entrusted to the Celestial Master.
The *Gānghù* (Ridge Mutual) and *Báishí* (White Stone) Treatments oversee those born in the *wǔ* (hour);
The *Zhōngmào* (Bell Prosperity) and *Jùshān* (Complete Mountain) Treatments oversee those born in the *wèi* (hour).

**The Four Treatments’ Chambers**
The Four *Jìngshì* (Serene Chambers) are as follows:
The *Kē* (Statutes) state:
*"When Dao/Way citizens enter transformation, each household establishes a Serene Chamber, facing west toward east, with a single incense burner placed beneath the western wall. The Celestial Master, as the sovereign of the Dao/Way Treatments, enters the Serene Chamber: first facing west, he reveres the incense burner for the Master, bows three times, and offers three incense. He then turns north, then east, then south. Upon completion, he exits without turning back."*

The *Kē* (Statutes) state:
*"At the mid-morning hour, entering the minor Treatment, first face west and bow to the Celestial Master, then turn east and bow to the Supreme."*

Upon exiting, he reviews the *lù* (scrolls), facing east to present petitions.

The *Kē* (Statutes) state:
*"At the mid-morning hour of worship, first face north and bow to the Supreme, then face east and bow to the Nine-Qi Venerable, then face south and bow to the Dao/Way Virtue Lord, then face west and bow to the Celestial Master. The minor Treatments follow the same."*

The *Xuándū Lǜ* (Mysterious Capital Statutes) states:
*"For households that establish Serene Chambers in accordance with Heaven’s Virtue, on days *jiǎ*, *yǐ*, *bǐng*, and *dīng*, the earth is prepared for entering the Serene Chamber.*

*The minor Treatment measures eight *chǐ* in width and ten *chǐ* in length;
The middle Treatment measures twelve *chǐ* in width and fourteen *chǐ* in length."*

*"The Great Treatment measures sixteen *chǐ* in width and eighteen *chǐ* in length;
The altar and incense burner are placed at the center of the chamber.
Violating the Treatment incurs a penalty of one *jì* (cycle of years) in the *suàn* (reckoning of fate).

It is further stated: Households are called *jìng* (Serene Chambers), while Master’s residences are called *zhì* (Treatments).

The Statutes decree:
On days *bǐng-yín*, *dīng-mào*, *bǐng-shēn*, *dīng-yǒu*, *bǐng-xū*, and *jiǎ-xū*, one must not enter the Treatment.
Violating this statute incurs a penalty of forty-five *suàn* (reckonings of fate).

When entering the Treatment, one must sit upright facing east, harmonizing the Five-Qi (directions), first invoking the *Gōngcāo* (Functional Officers) and *yīnyáng* (yin-yang officials), then bowing reverently with a focused mind and proper posture.

The *Tàizhēn Kē* (Statutes of Supreme Authenticity) states:
For laypersons receiving the Treatment or standing Treatment, their halls and lodgings must be orderly and clean, with clear distinctions for entry and exit, located in the southwest of their residences, and dedicated to scriptural offerings.
The Statutes further decree:
‘The incense and lamps must be kept burning continuously, the practitioner must cultivate the spirit and master the Authentic Dao, so that the Authentic Spirit may descend.
One must not receive the Treatment in an empty capacity, without proper lodging, while pursuing worldly gain, or through begging and petitioning. If impure and chaotic, it offends the spirits, causing confusion among humans and divine beings, and invites ridicule and transgression.
Instead, one must reside in modest dwellings, wear coarse clothing, eat simple food, and earnestly prepare the Treatment hall.’

If there is confusion or error in the rites, the Five Punishments shall be applied.
The *Tàizhēn Kē* further states:
‘When children receive the *Yījiāngjūn* (One-General) scroll and the nine ranks of *shùgēnglìng* (Office and Soldiery), this is known as the *Tīancháo* (Heavenly Register). They may then follow and enter the Serene Chamber or Treatment, bowing three times toward the *shěng* (Provincial Office), and pleading for urgent mercy.’

The Statutes decree:
‘Those receiving ten *Jiāngjūn* (Generals) or more must also deploy the Office and Soldiery, bowing three times at the mid-morning hour, and petitioning for urgent matters.’

The Statutes further state:
‘First, the *Gùnjīn* (Replacement) must strictly adhere to the ancient rites, diligently recite the scriptures, absorb the *Zhēnqì* (Authentic Qi), and comply with commands to act. If they fail, their descendants will suffer many calamities, and their parents may receive it in their stead. Normally, one must be seven years old to receive this office.
Second, the *Jìmèng* (Register of Merit) must strictly follow the *Lǚzhēn* (Lü’s Authenticity), reverently uphold the precedents. If they violate them, they will be punished with illness and misfortune, or even lose what they have received. If they repent and seek forgiveness, they may receive the later edicts, be instructed earnestly, abandon vice for virtue—this is not restricted by year.
Third, the *Tóngzǐ* (Child-Soldier) receives the *Yījiāngjūn* scroll. Boys and girls from eight to nineteen years old are all considered *tóngzǐ*, and their movements must be guided by gradual enlightenment, nurturing the *Xuānfēng* (Mysterious Winds).
Fourth, the *Chéngrén* (Adult) receives the *Shíjiāngjūn* (Ten-General) scroll. Men and women at twenty years old are considered adults. Those who are infirm, aged, or feeble-minded, unable to endure transformation, must be examined according to their capacity and gently guided toward enlightenment.
Fifth, the *Qīshíwǔjiāngjūn* (Seventy-Five-General) scroll contains seventy-five *jiāngjūn* (Generals), some bearing Daoist and some bearing spiritual essence—*yīnqì* (yin-qi) as Daoist, *yángqì* (yang-qi) as spiritual. Spiritual essence governs the earth, Daoist essence governs the heavens; the heavens are associated with *wén* (literature), the earth with *wǔ* (martial); martial governs the interior, literary the exterior. If one attains this rank within the Master’s gate, they must bow in submission to the left and right, first receiving the spiritual essence. If one is outside the Master’s gate, coming and going for consultation, they must first receive the Daoist essence. After receiving the Daoist essence, they advance to receive the spiritual; after receiving the spiritual, they advance to receive the Daoist. The total reaches one hundred and fifty, completing the scrolls. The sixth, the *Bǎiwǔshíjiāngjūn* (One-Hundred-Fifty-General) scroll, is also under the same Master, requiring no repeated oath-taking. If the previous Master granted seventy-five, and another Master later grants seventy-five more, one must provide firewood, rice, paper, ink, brushes, writing knives, vermilion, and silk as prescribed. If one has not yet received the One-General, Ten-General, or Seventy-Five-General scrolls but possesses high virtue, they may receive the One-Hundred-Fifty-General scroll directly.

It is further stated: Though the sequence of receiving spiritual essence before Daoist essence follows the principle of continuity, the proximity to Heaven’s Dao dictates the order—near or far—using either a *yīyù* (one talisman) or a *yīsù* (one seal), without regard to whether one is inside or outside the Master’s gate.

The above six stipulations are known as the *Wàiquè* (External Registers).
In general, the progression from the lowest to the highest rank follows the previous examples. If a girl-child attains the merit of an adult, or if an adult has not yet received their rank but displays extraordinary virtue and deeds, they may all surpass and receive the One-Hundred-Fifty-General scroll, first the Daoist essence, then the spiritual, transforming from external to internal, all using the *Hēiguān* (Black Official) seal.

If one first attains the rank under one Master, receiving the One-General, Ten-General, or Seventy-Five-General scrolls, and later reaches the One-Hundred-Fifty-General rank under another Master, they must all be recorded, and the scrolls must be carried and worn, with the later ones placed behind the earlier ones, all sealed in boxes. One must not lose them, as losing them incurs a penalty of half the reckoning of fate, and they need not be received again. Those who have received both the Ten-General and Seventy-Five-General scrolls, if later receiving from another Master, must surrender their previous scrolls to the new Master, and the accumulated merit shall be transferred.

The descendants of the *Dòngyuān Tiānshī* (Cavernous Abyss Celestial Master) must receive the *qìquè* (Qi-Register) scrolls but not the Treatment scrolls. The Treatment officials are all subordinate to the *Huángtán* (Imperial Altar), and their ranks must be fully prepared or not at all.

After receiving the scrolls, the priority is to perform morning worship, followed by petitioning for mercy and saving lives, invoking the Mysterious Spirits, and addressing them as follows: ‘[Name], a General-scroll male/female of the [rank], does not presume to call oneself a subject.’
When using talismans to command water, heal illnesses, or avert calamities, if one demonstrates diligent merit, the Master shall promote them accordingly.

The *Míngqìquè* (Illuminated Registers) include:
- The *Huángshū Qì* (Yellow Book Register), *Liùjiǎ Qì* (Six Jia Register), *Shénquè* (Spiritual Scroll), *Zhēnquè* (Authentic Scroll), and *Shèngxiānquè* (Saintly Daoist Scroll)—these two registers and three scrolls illuminate the *Tǔdé* (Earth Virtue), with faith as the foremost principle, governing the *Zhǔfǔ* (Master’s Office) monthly, and aligning with the *Huángdào Xiān* (Yellow Daoist Path), subduing the *Zhìxīng* (Zhi-star).
- The *Chìjiè Qì* (Red Boundary Register), *Qīngtóng Qì* (Green Child Register), *Chìjiǎ* (Red Jia), and *Qīngjiǎquè* (Green Jia Scroll)—these two registers and two scrolls illuminate the *Huǒdé* (Fire Virtue), with ritual precedence, governing the day, and aligning with the *Chìdào Xiān* (Red Daoist Path), subduing the *Yínghuòxīng* (Yinghuo-star).
- The *Zhēnyī Qì* (Authentic Unity Register), *Sānyǒuqì* (Three-Five Register), *Xuánquè* (Mysterious Scroll), and *Yuánmìngquè* (Primordial Command Scroll)—these two registers and two scrolls illuminate the *Mùdé* (Wood Virtue), with benevolence as the foundation, governing the *Suìxīng* (Sui-star).
- The *Sānyī Qì* (Three-One Register) and *Wúzhōngquè* (Limitless Term Scroll)—this one register and one scroll illuminate the *Shuǐdé* (Water Virtue), with wisdom as the source, governing the *Chénxīng* (Chen-star).
- The *Wǔsèyī Qì* (Five-Color Unity Register) and *Tàijiǎquè* (Great Jia Scroll)—this one register and one scroll illuminate the *Jīndé* (Metal Virtue), with righteousness as the root, governing the *Tàibáixīng* (Tai Bai-star).

The *Tàiyī Quàn* (Great Unity Talisman) is also known as the *Jīnquàn* (Golden Talisman), for the talisman is another name for the register. The eight registers are fixed in rank, hence the term ‘Great Unity’ encompasses all eight stages. The term ‘Golden Talisman’ signifies that, with prolonged refinement, its essence becomes ever more profound and its transformations unceasing.

The eight registers are as above. When one has completed all ten scrolls, the scrolls are fulfilled in their entirety."*

From the *Báiwǔshí Jiāngjūn Lù* (One Hundred and Fifty Generals Register) downward to the *Yī Lù* (First Register) of the Celestial Master’s descendants, after ascending the Imperial Platform (*Huángtán*), they do not receive the *xìxíng* (comprehensive initiation). If they have not yet ascended the Imperial Platform, they all receive it from the *zhū gāodé* (senior virtuous masters) and transmit it.

All who study the Dao and establish merit must receive both inner and outer governance (*nèiwài zhì*), and they are all addressed as "subject" or "servant." Those who receive the Celestial Master’s appointment are addressed as "officials and functionaries." Those who perform the *Dàzhì* (Great Governance) rites are recorded without being called "born."

The *Xuándū Lǜ* (Mysterious Capital Statutes) states: "Those who receive talismanic documents and the like may have ghostly officials and soldiers in the locality; they may be seen wandering."

The *Běnxiàng Jīng* (Original Form Scripture) says:
*"Question:* Does the *sàijiǔ* (sacrificial dean) incur guilt if he accepts offerings when transmitting talismans to the common folk?
*Answer:* The *sàijiǔ* is a teacher among the people, and the masses regard him as a model. If he takes money without distributing it, later disciples will follow his example—this is the gravest offense. The calamity is far worse than a *jié* (eon of suffering), and the retribution will cycle endlessly through ten thousand ages. The Celestial Gate will never admit him, and he will forever be bound to the Three Evils."

**Chapter Tables (Zhāngbiǎo):**

**Question to Tianlǎo Píngcháng:**

If one encounters these **inauspicious hours** (*shuāishí*), one must avoid them and not violate them. If the **fate** (*mìng*) of an illness is at the **turning point of the candle** (*zhuǎnzhú*), one may report it to the officials.

For those **Celestial Officials** who are **worthy and capable** (*néng*), they can **move mountains, stop floods, summon clouds, and create rain**; they can **summon ten thousand spirits** (*wànshén*) with a single command, **cause plants to grow in winter** (*dōngshēng cǎomù*), and **induce frost in summer** (*xiàjié bīngshuāng*). If one can perform such deeds, then **this ritual manual** (*cèshū*) is **not needed for oneself** (*bùyòng cìshū qí shēn*). Therefore, when one is **harmed by water, fire, knives, or weapons**, one must **clearly report to the Celestial Officials** (*chénggào Zhǔshì*) and **heed these prohibitions** (*míng jiē qǐshí*).

For **Daoist laypersons** (*dàodù mín*) offering **sacrificial meals** (*jiěshí*), one must **contemplate the Five Celestial Emperors** (*wǔ Dì*) and **name the Six Celestial Stems** (*Liùjiǎ*), invoking the **worthy and noble deities and Daoists** (*shénxiān zūnxián, wǔyuè míngshān dàoshì*) to **pray for blessings** (*qǐng yuàn zhǔrén défú*) on the host.

One must **first submit a petition** (*shàngzhāng*), **inviting the ancestors** (*qǐng xiān rén*), and then **arrange the sacrifices**. This is the **way of filial children**.

The above **prohibitions for submitting petitions** (*shàngzhāng jìnyì*) must **not be violated**. Be cautious in conducting rituals—**great auspice** (*dàjí*) will follow.

For treating illnesses, one may use the **auspicious hours of the Vermilion Pine Child** (*Chìsōngzǐ shí*).

In any **single day**, one must **not repeatedly enter the Pure and Serene Hall** (*Jìngshàng*) to submit petitions.

**Note from Master Zhang of the Celestial Teacher:**
For petitions to the Celestial Officials (*Jǐ yì zhì qǐng zhāng*), the larger version requires one hundred sheets of paper and two brush pens, one ink pellet; the smaller version requires fifty sheets of paper and one brush pen. These are drafts for the petitioner’s use; errors may be corrected, but the seal of authenticity must not be altered. The laws of petitions must be clearly observed.

Petitions without proper seals are invalid. After submitting petitions, surplus offerings should be given to the poor to cultivate *yīndé* (hidden virtue); one must not hoard them all. Of the total, the master may use only three parts if calculations are made. The Celestial Laws are strict—offenders will be punished by the Three Officials, and their misfortune will extend to nine generations, condemning them as lower ghosts forever. Be most cautious.

For each mat, two *liǎng* of incense, one hundred sheets of paper, one brush pen, one ink pellet, and one writing knife: the poor may adjust according to means, while the wealthy should increase accordingly.

The *Fán Cāo Zhāng* states: If there are errors or omissions, submit them to the *Gōngcāo* (Functionary of Affairs). This method was originally intended for the dim-witted. Those who act with sincerity and precision may submit to the *Zhèngzhī* (Upright Official) for verification, using *qìyìn* (spirit-seal) to authenticate the petition, demonstrating humility and sincerity. Such petitions are permissible.

For those of sharp intellect and ambition, if they are capable of self-correction but instead act lazily, they will be reported to the *Gōngcāo*. The Celestial Officials will surely examine them, and repeated arrogance will not be pardoned. All *sàijiǔ* (sacrificial attendants) must be especially diligent and cautious.

**Order of Petitions for Illness:**
The *Tài Zhēn Kē* states: For all illnesses, first submit the *Shǒuzhuàng Zhāng* (Initial Symptom Petition). If not cured, then submit the *Jiě Kǎo Zhāng* (Exoneration Petition).

For illnesses that persist, submit next the *Exoneration of the Deceased’s Crime and Demotion Petition*; if still not cured, submit the *Ascension to High Status Petition*. For cases of deep stagnation, submit the *Reversal of Killing and Ghostly Debt Petition*; if again stagnant, submit the *Great Exoneration of Calamity and Misfortune Petition*. If still no improvement, submit the *Five-Generations Tomb Demotion Petition*; if yet no change, submit the *Great Exoneration of Declining Epidemic and Severe Misfortune Petition*. If the illness remains uncured, submit the *Soul Return and Spirit Recovery Petition*; if still not cured, submit the *Tomb Pacification and Exoneration of the Five Soils’ Harm Petition*; if still not cured, submit the *Residence Pacification, Spirit Pacification, and Driving Away Ghostly Debt Petition*; if still not cured, submit the *Great Exoneration of Internal and External Debt Petition*. If the illness is urgent and constraining, submit the *Child-Midnight Petition for Life Extension*, along with the *Reversal of the Three Officials’ Death and Exoneration Petition*; if the illness fluctuates between improvement and relapse, submit the *Supplication to the Thirty-two Heavens Petition*. In cases of extreme peril, submit the *Ransom of Life and Offering of [Sacrificial Animal]*, along with the *Extraction of Life, Candle-Lighting, Exoneration of Retrogression and Connection*, *Five Lamps, Twenty-eight Constellations, Verification of Constellations*, and *Great Exoneration of the Deceased’s Debt*, totaling eighty-one petitions. Those without misfortune or illness must not presumptuously seek these petitions. Violators shall be subject to three punishments.

**Petitions During Avoidance of Taboos:**
The *Tài Zhēn Kē* states: On days of grand festivals and celebrations, submit petitions and offerings by name, without avoiding fierce winds or heavy rains, eclipses of the sun or moon, or celestial prohibitions. On such days, the Heavenly Emperor convenes a grand assembly. The *science* (法) decrees: On days of grand festivals and auspicious occasions, all must attend in their proper names, without avoiding daily or monthly taboos, and gather as usual. On these days, all great saints descend together, convening in the Hall of Treatment, their forms and shadows manifesting, and their resonance echoing uniformly across ten thousand *lǐ* (里). On these days, submit all petitions to the celestial hierarchy, conferring degrees and spirit-seals (*luóqìèqì* 箓契). Male and female officials, through virtue and merit, shall dissipate calamities and disperse misfortunes, all without restriction.

The *Xuāndū Lǜ* (玄都律) states: When submitting petitions for treatment, avoid the *wùchén* (戊辰) day.

- **Bottom section**: five inches.

**The *Wei Tradition*** states:

Ensure no one witnesses this. For other illnesses, compose a petition, burn incense, and write facing north.

If suffering from **severe illness**, burn incense on all four sides and place **four incense offerings** (四香火).

Grind the inkstone, turning left forty-nine times, and remold it likewise.

Regarding the **inkstand**:
The *Xuandu Regulations* state:
When presenting petitions, one must use a **curved-leg inkstand**.

With the upper 6 *cùn* reserved for the seal,
And the lower 1 *chǐ* 2 *cùn* for writing.
When preparing talisman incense, one must not use stove ash.
Violation: Illness penalty of ten days.

The *Sanhuang Jing* states:
The **Celestial Elder** asked:
"Why must talismans be made on the *wùxū* day?"
The **Three Sovereigns** replied:
"*Xū* is the **Heavenly Gate**; *wù* is **Earth**, the likeness of the Central Palace Sovereign."
The **Heavenly Emperor** often, on *wùxū* days,
Descends from the **Western-North Heavenly Gate** to wander and inspect.
When talismans are made on this day, the Heavenly Emperor takes delight,
Granting whatever is desired.
*Wù* is **Earth**, and one must surely attain **official rank and title, ennoblement, and fiefs**.
That is why it is worn at **noon**—noon is the essence of the **Sun** and the pure radiance of **refined gold**,
Ensuring one attains the likeness of **high rank in gold and purple**.

Regarding the **original storage of petitions**:
The *Taizhen Science* states:
After completing a petition for another,
And after all minor petitions have been burned in the furnace,
Roll them into the case and carry them out.
Then, separately, retrieve all the major petitions,
Taking them all at once and recording them as prescribed.

If what is to be burned, then relight the furnace before the table and burn it;
If elsewhere, return the petition with the one who submitted it.

At the head of the petition, mark the name of the petitioner,
Seal the original copy and keep it securely—
Do not let it be exposed to insects, rodents, or bartered for gain.
If violated, the **Supreme Sovereign’s decree** states:
The petition contains the true titles of officials, names of spirits and ghosts,
Sacred incantations of the **Numen**, all inscribed within—
Do not let them be stained or dishonored.

All petitions have an **original copy**—
Transcribe them carefully, verify them clearly,
And do not use them arbitrarily.

For **original records and statements**,
Do not submit them to officials for verification or alteration;
Common households must not retain original petition copies.
Violations shall be punished by the **Five Penalties**.

**The Ritual of Termination** (*Taizhen Science* states):
*"The petitioner solemnly examines the documents:
I, [Name], of rank [Title], follow the Dao in practice,
Propagate the **Dao-qi**, and petition for the summoning of **True Officials**
To save and protect the myriad people.

The petitions submitted—
Those to be burned, burn;
Those not to be burned, seal and store in chests.
When rolled and stacked in abundance,
The ritual forbids scattering them—
Lest insects, rodents, dampness, or decay cause loss,
We have always adhered with caution, never daring to defy the decree.

On this day, according to the **Science**, at the appointed time,
From the [Year] Month Day Hour to the present Year Month Day,
There are a total of **X** petitions.

Now, at the **Pure Altar of [Name]**, in a clean place,
We incinerate the petitions as smoke, ascending to clouds,
Descending **qi**, spreading blessings and dispelling calamities.
We humbly petition the **Directing Officer of the Orthodox Unity Bureau**,
The **Central Authority of the Tiger Guard**, and the **Awe-Inspiring Rites**,
With **Five Commanders**, **Two Wu-Bo**, **Twelve Officers**,
**Five Functionaries, Clerks, Junior Attendants, and Golden-Light Children**,
And **Two Supervisors from the Central Department, Postal Inspectors, and Envoys**,
To jointly oversee and verify,
Burning away the old and adopting the new.

For my own shortcomings and inadequacies,
I beg that the previously inscribed copies be forever recorded in the **Celestial Registry**,
And that future petitions be exempt from the **Cold Pool** [of punishment].

The officials shall attest, reward, and assist in merit—
According to the **Grand Register’s** record of deeds,
Without failing in sincerity—
The grace of the **Supreme Sovereign** is thus fulfilled."*

**Termination of the Petition**—
The total number varies.

In times of abundance or scarcity,
The ritual has phases of **active** and **hidden** practice—
When hidden, practice is minimal;
When active, count until full.
A hundred petitions constitute a **Termination**.

As in the previous text,
Each year by the **10th month**, the **Termination** is observed.

**Completion of the *Essential Rules for Ritual Conduct and Precepts*, Volume 11**
**Excerpt from the *Essential Rules for Ritual Conduct and Precepts*, Volume 12**

**Fasting the Worthy (Bian Xian Yuan) – First Chapter**

When the sacred teaching flourishes and the Dao’s winds prevail,
Worthy ones arise, and the sovereign’s virtue is exalted.
The principle of resonance being manifest,
The ritual of fasting the worthy is now revealed.

*The Taizhen Precepts* state:
When sickness or calamity befalls a household,
Public or private, a kitchen is established—
This is called fasting the worthy.
One may invite pure and worthy Daoists—
Upper, middle, or lower ranks—
Ten, twenty-four, thirty, fifty, or a hundred in number.
Never fewer than ten, lest the merit be incomplete.

The worthy, though frugal, may refuse food,
Or eat sparingly if they do.
They require only simple gruel and medicine,
Not lavish feasts—
For the world honors them as upholders of the Dao.

At this time, an altar must be erected.
Three days of purification precede,
Three days of merit-recitation follow.
The worthy, being divine within,
Are honored with abundance;
Their virtue demands fullness.
Food should suffice for satiety,
Flavor should suit moderation.
The offering must match the purity of an abstinence meal—
No meat or defilement is permitted.
Violators face five punishments.

During the guest month, three invitations suffice;
Names need not be enumerated.
Greedy or gluttonous guests must not be repeatedly summoned to the sacred kitchen.
The finer details of the ritual—
Exceeding ten folios—
Are rarely observed today,
So they are omitted here.

*The Xuandu Statutes* decree:
On auspicious triple assemblies,
Confronting celestial officials,
Teaching the ignorant and vulgar,
Disseminating merit and virtue,
If impurity mingles with human and ghostly resonance,
The calamity will fall upon future rulers.
The penalty: one *jì* of reckoning.

*The Statutes* further state:
For those of the Zhengyi sect ranked *Pingqi* or above,
One person’s merit counts as seven.
For mountain-dwelling Daoists,
One counts as three.
For those bearing talismans or holding military rank,
One counts as two.
For junior acolytes,
Two count as three.
For commoners,
One counts as one.

For sons born, the upper kitchen is used;
For daughters, the middle kitchen.
Increasing household members or wealth,
The lower kitchen suffices.

*The Statutes* decree:
When a Daoist hosts a kitchen for others,
They must select a person of great virtue and goodwill—
Never one of wickedness or disrespect,
Lest the merit be lost.
Violators face one *jì* of reckoning.

*The Statutes* decree:
When hosting a kitchen, guests must be seated uniformly,
All harboring the Supreme Sovereign’s benevolent intent.
No talk of slaughter, hunting, or fishing is permitted.
Violators—both host and guests—suffer three years of reckoning.

*The Statutes* decree:
If a Daoist hosts a kitchen,
Incense must be burned before guests—
No meat or defilement allowed.
Violators face a hundred days of reckoning.

**Constructing Temple Halls (Zao Dian Tang Yuan) – Second Chapter**

To establish righteousness,
One relies on compassion’s power,
Seeking proof of cause and effect,
Demanding faith as its foundation.
Merit manifests in prior causes,
And wondrous causes shine through future kalpas.

*The Taizhen Precepts* state:
If a layperson donates wealth to build
A single walled hall or refined chamber,
They are granted a small reckoning of 120.
For three halls, 360.
The more the merit, the greater the reckoning.

*The Great Precepts Sutra* declares:
To erect a *Jingguan* observatory,
Ensures noble lineage for generations,
Ascension to celestial halls,
Natural sustenance,
And eternal abiding in non-action.
Donating even a single coin yields
320,000-fold repayment;
A donation of ten thousand or more—
Its reward is boundless.

*The Benji Jing* recounts:
When the Great Brahmin King’s realm suffered drought,
Turning scriptures brought relief.
He then built a grand hall.

*The Benxiang Jing* recounts:
King Qinghe, who scorned Daoist law,
Built the *Xixian Guan* and the temples of *Xilings* and *Qizheng*.

*The Benji* records:
In the reign of Zhou King Kang,
The True Beginning Immortal wove grass into a pavilion,
Observing stars and celestial omens.
Upon attaining the Dao, the pavilion became legendary.
Later, Zhou King Mu, revering his legacy,
Renovated the halls, naming them *Louguan*,
And erected a temple in his honor.
In the thirty-first year of Qin Shi Huang’s reign,
A temple to the Venerable Lord was built to his south.

*The Benzhuan* records:
In the second year of Emperor Wu’s *Yuanfeng* era (January 1st, *jiāzǐ*),
He ascended Mount Song,
Entered the Great Yu Stone Chamber,
Established Daoist offices,
And commanded Dongfang Shuo and Dong Zhongshu to purify themselves in meditation.

**The Pondering of the Dao (Nian Dao Yuan) – Third Chapter**

The Dao is subtle, beyond measure,
Empty yet generative, boundless in use.
Five reflections shine in sacred ritual,
One mind unites with true essence.

*The Dao Canon* states:
Constantly ponder the Dao,
And the Dao will ponder you.
In tribulation, think of the Dao;
In sickness, think of the Dao;
In poverty or disgrace, think of the Dao;
In hardship or want, think of the Dao;
In eating and drinking, think of the Dao;
In traversing mountains and marshes, think of the Dao;
In crossing rivers, think of the Dao.
Ever in action, think of the Dao—
Then the Dao walks beside you.

Where the Dao emerges,
All things are born, all spirits fulfilled,
Nothing remains unnourished.
When the Dao is lost, even for an instant,
The body descends into the Eight Dark Realms.

*The Yinyuan Jing* declares:
Pondering the true heart never wanes,
Loyalty and sincerity are never forgotten.
Honoring the Dao’s worthies,
No hardship shall befall.
Moreover, honoring virtuous Daoists,
Abstinence reveals the True King.
Steadfast in contemplation,
Seven ancestors ascend to the Celestial Hall.

*The Miaozhen Jing* states:
The Daoist seeks life,
Yet does not crave fame.
Rags for robes, worn-out sandals,
No longing for honor.
The heart is pure as white,
The mind uncluttered.
The will flows like water,
The dwelling is empty as a city.
Guarding non-action,
One attains longevity.

The Dao is singular.
If one knows it, clarity shines like the sun;
If one does not, they remain buried in the earth.
The Dao takes nothing—
Righteous qi abides naturally.
The Dao departs from nothing—
Evil qi is expelled.
This is not the Dao of petitioning spirits and gods.

It can be held yet does not fill the hand;
Released, it spreads across the four seas.
Those who study life attain life;
Those who study the Dao attain the Dao.
Like one drowning who knows how to swim—
They live.
The ignorant drown.
The undiseased are easily healed;
The undying realm is easily governed.

「Those who do not embrace the Dao/Way have scattered and distinct thoughts.
The sparrow and quail fly high, yet their hearts dwell on the fields of grain;
The wild goose takes flight over marshes and pools, its will fixed on shallow waters.
The great crane and wild goose soar in the realm of **Tàiqīng** (太清), traversing the Nine Regions, resting at the Eight Extremes, and thus finding their true abode.
Though these two birds differ in joy and sorrow, their aspirations vary, yet each claims to have attained its own desire.

Thus the depths of great waters hold the divine dragon,
While small fish scurry to escape;
Deep mountains and dense marshes delight the tiger and leopard,
Yet repel the chicken and dog.
Therefore, rules differ, and the hearts of the people vary—
Hence, those who follow the Dao/Way
Diminish their sharpness of mind,
Abandon clever scheming,
Return to authenticity and simplicity,
Dwell in the realm of **Tàisù** (太素),
Hold light the world and scorn its entanglements,
Their radiance untainted,
Their joy and anger not stirred by external influences,
Their concerns for gain and harm not lodged in their thoughts—
This is the conduct of the Great Sage.

The *Lǎojūn Jìnjié Jīng* (《老君禁戒经》) states:
*"Accumulating virtue brings kingship,
Accumulating resentment brings ruin,
Piling stones forms mountains,
Gathering waters creates seas—
What is achieved without accumulation has never been seen.
Accumulate **dáodé** (道德), and Heaven grants it,
Earth assists it,
Ghosts and spirits aid it,
The **fèngniǎo** (凤鸟) alights in your courtyard,
The **qílín** (麒麟) and **lín** (鳞) roam your outskirts,
The divine dragon rests in your marshes.
Thus, if one governs the world with the Dao/Way,
They are the world’s virtue;
If one does not govern the world with the Dao/Way,
They are the world’s thief.
Yáo and Shùn flourished through having the Dao/Way,
Jiě and Jié perished through lacking it."*

**Section on Avoiding Defilement (Fourth Chapter)**
The **shénqì** (神气) is pure and void,
Guarded by divine spirits;
The body and mind are turbid and impure,
Inviting harm from malevolent forces.
To enter stillness and ponder the True,
One must first prevent defilement—
Not treading upon evils,
Then blessings will naturally reside.

The *Xuāndū Lǜ* (《玄都律》) states:
*"If households are defiled and unclean,
They shall not exceed the duration of **huìzuò** (晦朔)—
Only then may they enter **jìngzhì** (靖治) to perform rites, offerings, or submit petitions.
Weeping for three days brings defilement.
During the three-year mourning period,
Before the hundredth day has passed,
They shall not enter **jìngzhì** to perform rites, offerings, or submit petitions.
Violating this law incurs a penalty of **suàn** (算) for one **jì** (纪).*
It further states:
*"Upon encountering the great mourning of a teacher, master, or parents,
Defilement lasts thirty days—
They shall not fast or offer petitions.
Once the thirty days have passed,
And the outer mourning period concludes,
They must bathe, burn incense, and purify themselves.
Violating this law incurs a penalty of **suàn** for two **jì** (纪)."*

The law states:
*"Officers of the **Tàiyī Jífǎ** (太一极法) Daoists,
Whether male or female,
Shall not be defiled by mourning—
Even weeping shall not bring defilement.
They must wear their **gē** (箓) talismans on their persons,
Not removing or passing them to others."*

The law states:
*"If Daoist officers, male or female,
Are imprisoned or detained by secular authorities,
They must first purify themselves with fragrant baths.
After three days of defilement have passed,
They may enter **jìngzhì** to perform rites or submit petitions.
Violating this law incurs a penalty of **suàn** for one **jì** (纪).*

*If Daoists or female officers
Suffer private secular punishment,
And their wounds are not yet healed,
Before thirty days have passed,
They shall not enter **jìngzhì** to perform rites or submit petitions.
Violating this law incurs a penalty of **kǎo** (考) twenty."*

The law states:
*"Those who wear the **gē** (箓) talismans
Shall not enter defiled spaces—
If they do, they face no restrictions.
If they tread upon unclean **qì** (气), their penalty comes from the **Tàiqīng Cáo** (太清曹).
If they do not, their penalty comes from the **Qīngtiān Cáo** (清天曹)."*

The *Sānyuán Pǐndié* (《三元品戒》) states:
*"On the fifteenth days of the first, seventh, and tenth months,
At dawn, noon, and midnight,
One must bathe the body
And purify with the **wǔxiāng** (五香) five fragrant substances.
At the moment of bathing,
Facing south, use a golden ladle
To stir the fragrant water in a circular motion,
Turning counterclockwise thirty-two times in the southeast.
Close the eyes and meditate on the sun’s light in the left eye,
The moon’s light in the right eye,
The **wǔxīng** (五星) Five Stars encircling the head,
The **wǔsè yún** (五色之云) five-colored clouds
Enveloping the body,
The **Qīnglóng** (青龙) Azure Dragon, **Báihǔ** (白虎) White Tiger, **Zhūquè** (朱雀) Vermilion Bird, **Xuánwǔ** (玄武) Dark Warrior, **Shīzǐ** (狮子) Lion, and **Báihè** (白鹤) White Crane
Arrayed on either side,
Fairy attendants holding towels,
Celestial maidens scattering flowers,
Flying immortals riding steeds,
Guarding and attending the form.
Then strike the teeth thirty-two times,
And recite the invocation:
*"Heaven is clear, the **qì** (气) is pure,
The Five Colors radiant and bright."*

The sun and moon emit their radiance,
Irrigating my body and form.
Within the divine pool, I bathe,
With fragrant waters refining my essence,
Illuminating all with radiant splendor,
Shining upon the **Upper Purity** (上清),
My **qi** (气) untainted by dust,
The Five **Palaces** (府) receiving their spirits.
Sins vanish from the Three **Tus** (徒),
Calamities disperse from the Nine **Mings** (冥),
Evil roots severed and cut,
Bliss and joy naturally arise.
Today’s grand vow:
All things now made clear,
My body receiving liberation,
Ascending into the Imperial Court.

Finished, I then draw in **qi** (气) thirty-two times,
And wash with the five fragrant essences.
After bathing, I don a crown and sash,
And change into my garments.
Again, I strike the teeth twelve times,
And recite the invocation:
*"The Five Impurities now purified,
The Eight **Scenes** (景) now illuminated,
Today I undergo refinement,
Sins vanish, blessings arise.
Long may I align with the Five **Emperors** (帝),
Equal to the **True Ones** (真) of the highest **Ling** (灵),
Then depart and enter the chamber,
Conducting the **Dao** (道) according to the law."*

The *Natural Precepts, Lower Section* (《自然诀下》) states:
*"If the scriptures are defiled,
And one does not bathe,
First, it invites many diseases and calamities,
Second, it shows the people the distinction between purity and impurity,
Third, the spirits and **demons** (鬼) will not aid in communion,
Fourth, the **True Officials** (真官) of the scriptures will charge one with guilt,
Fifth, others seeing it will not show reverence."*

The *Three Sovereigns Scripture* (《三皇经》) declares:
*"When I purify myself, I recite:
By the sun, I cleanse my body,
By the moon, I refine my essence,
The **Fairy Ones** (仙人) assist me,
The **Jade Maidens** (玉女) aid my form,
The Twenty-Eight **Lunar Lodges** (宿) unite with me,
A thousand deceits and impurities are swept away by the water.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the **Precepts** (律令) command."*

The *Laozi’s Scripture on Nourishing Life* (《老君养生经》) states:
*"On the **waning day** (晦日), bathing is auspicious,
On the **new moon** (朔日), bathing is auspicious."*

The *Thousand True Precepts* (《千真科》) prescribe:
*"In winter, bathing must occur every **decade** (旬).
First, prepare a secluded chamber,
Six feet square,
With a water trough, fire stove, and bamboo pipe,
To pour the hot water in.
Into the water, add **peach twigs** (桃枝), **bamboo leaves** (栢叶), **orchid** (兰), and **bamboo leaves** (竹叶),
Boil and take three **liang** (两),
Once it boils, remove the dregs,
Then add the five fragrant essences,
And filter the water through a cloth strainer.
The high and low must bathe in order,
Not sharing with the vulgar masses,
All must wear bathing garments,
Or else it violates the **Precepts** (律)."*

**Section on Theft and Robbery** (贼缘第五)
*"Those who leave the secular world
Must cultivate upright thoughts and sincere hearts,
Facing the **True One** (真) each morning,
And thus safeguarding body, speech, and mind.
If the heart moves with even a trace of greed,
It is as if one sinks into **endless kalpas** (万劫),
How much more so if one habitually steals?
One will forever lose the **Dao** (道) of humanity."*

The *Precepts of the Mystic Capital* (《玄都律》) decree:
*"Theft of scriptures, offerings, or anything of value—
Even a single **file** (文) or more—
Will be met with severe retribution.
If the stolen goods exceed a **file** (文),
Five **cun** (疋) of punishment for each **file**,
And one **Palace** (府) of the household will perish.
If the stolen goods are less than a **file** (文),
Seven thousand days of **karmic illness** (病),
And twelve years of life will be forfeited.
Theft of **talismans** (符), **arrow-writing** (箓), official seals, or contracts—
All will be met with retribution.
If one finds them outside and does not claim them,
It is not permitted.
Theft of **Heavenly Officials’** (天官) taxed rice—
Five **dou** (斗) or more—
Guilt enters retribution.
One **hu** (斛) or more—
Guilt enters criminal punishment.
If the theft is not reported,
Seven thousand days of **karmic illness** (病),
And twelve years of life will be forfeited.
Robbery—
Taking even a single **file** (文) of another’s possessions—
Guilt enters criminal punishment,
And one thousand days of **karmic illness** (病) or death.
Repayment for stolen goods:
For each **cun** (疋) stolen, repay ten **cun** (疋),
And robbers will not be allowed to enter the **Dao** (道),
Their **karmic guilt** (赃) collected like **demonic spoils** (鬼赃),
Ten **cun** (疋) collected, two **cun** (疋) repaid.

The **Precepts** (律) say:
*"No sin is greater than robbery.
Forcibly taking, forcibly borrowing, forcibly buying—
All are theft.
Taking without the **Dao** (道) is judged as theft.
The **Precepts** (律) say:
If one borrows but does not return the principal,
Or if the lender does not repay the borrower,
Both the principal and the lender are guilty of theft,
And shall be charged with the corresponding crimes.
If one borrows but does not return the principal,
They will be subjected to **karmic illness** (病) under the **Superintendent of the Storehouse** (监仓令).
If one borrows and does not repay the lender,
They will be subjected to **karmic illness** (病) under this **Precept** (律).
When guilt is full, it becomes **fierce** (凶),
And when **fierce** (凶), it shall be sentenced to death."*

The **Precepts** (律) say:
*"Theft of a single **scroll** (卷) of scriptures—
One thousand days of **karmic illness** (病),
And seven years of life forfeited;
Theft of a single **scroll** (卷) or more from the **Heavenly Officials’ Secret Archives** (天官秘书)—
Guilt enters criminal punishment,
And the **Precepts** (律) will prescribe death.
Theft of clothing, utensils, knives, axes, or finished goods—
All incur double the punishment,
And destruction of the **karmic guilt** (罪) is one level reduced.
For those who incite theft or speak of it,
They will be subjected to **karmic illness** (病) under the **Superintendent of the Storehouse** (监仓令).
Theft of an **incense burner** (香炉)—
Retribution is death,
And the thief’s guilt enters criminal punishment.
Theft of a **scripture knife** (书刀)—
Twenty years of life forfeited,
And two thousand days of **karmic illness** (病);
Theft of a **case** (函)—
Ten years of life forfeited,
And one thousand days of **karmic illness** (病);
Theft of **abacus beads** (算)—
Five years of life forfeited,
And one hundred days of **karmic illness** (病);
Theft of **ink** (墨)—
Three years of life forfeited,
And three hundred days of **karmic illness** (病);
Theft of **paper** (纸)—
Two years of life forfeited,
And one hundred days of **karmic illness** (病);
Theft of food utensils, cups, bowls, **incense censers** (昙缶), or miscellaneous items—
Twelve years of life forfeited,
And two thousand days of **karmic illness** (病);
Theft of **boats or carriages** (船车)—
Guilt enters criminal punishment, as prescribed by the **Precepts** (律)."*

The *Scripture on the Original Form* (《本相经》) states:
*"Wealth gathered invites **misfortune** (祸),
Money amassed invites **thieves** (盗).
Thus, the **Dao-heart** (道心) must be:
Diligent in the **Dao** (道), not in wealth,
Cultivating **virtue** (德), not in silk.
It further says:
Thieves are the worst of mankind,
Greedy for stolen goods.
They lurk day and night,
Waiting for opportunities to strike,
Plundering what others love,
And hoarding it for themselves.
If their spoils are exposed to the **King’s Law** (王法),
Their souls will descend into the **Hell of Earth** (地狱).
The **Sand-Demons** (抱沙鬼) of the sea,
Iron needles without rest.
To behold them causes sorrow,
Yet they are not learned from—
Their **karmic guilt** (罪) is not sealed.
The **lustful thief** (淫贼), though guilty of **lewdness** (淫),
Still competes to cultivate **blessings and virtue** (福德).
When the **Dao** (道) descends into the human body,
Joy and ease are ever present.
It further says:
If a **Daoist** (道士) steals,
Their **guilt** (罪) will not be pardoned—
**Daoists** must uphold the **Law** (法),
Not indulging in **crookedness** (倾邪).
Wearing the **Supreme Contract** (无上契) of their master,
They must not be extravagant in their thoughts.
Even if they give alms, they must not take,
How much more so if they become thieves!
They will suffer **mutilation** (剕刖) and **body punishment** (受身刑),
And be bound in the **Northern Torture Hall** (北酆枷).
Their ancestral shrines will not be established,
And their **karmic retribution** (罪) will extend to seven generations."*

The *Scripture Admonishing the World* (《劝世经》) declares:
*"Robbery harms body, speech, and mind,
Swallowing the blade into the belly’s depths.
It brings **decay and ruin** (衰穷),
And **shriveling** (申缩) cannot restore **prosperity** (泰).
Whether moving or still,
One’s life is extinguished,
And bones lie in filth.
Ultimately, one will face **retribution** (殃考),
And their lineage will be utterly severed,
Leaving no descendants."*

**On the Mind of the Unknowing Child**
Why not cultivate the Dao of virtue,
And strive to build meritorious deeds?
Merits and faults balance each other—
Extending years through calamitous times.
Accumulate good and gather blessings,
Accumulate evil and invite retribution.
Yet within a single lifetime,
Why bring shame upon oneself?

*The Laws of the Mystic Capital* (*玄都律*) decree:
*"To harm or kill another—
The case is referred to the Magistrate of Northern Peace."*

*The Scripture of Ascension to the Mystic* (*升玄经*) states:
*"If one kills before encountering the Dharma,
Or slays with their own hands,
They must redeem it by saving a dying person.
Once the guilt is purged,
They also earn the merit of saving a life."*

*The Laws of the Mystic Capital* (*玄都律*) further decree:
*"Quarrels over fields and homes, violent disputes—
The case is referred to the Magistrate of Equitable Qi."*

**The Sixth Cause: Transgressions of the Sixth Degree**
To cultivate oneself, one must first avoid fault.
Greed and wrath arise from the Six Desires,
Transgressions from the Five Emotions—
Their errors manifest in action.

*The Laws of the Mystic Capital* (*玄都律*) declare:
*"Within the human body,
A spirit constantly ascends, reporting one’s virtues and vices to Heaven.
When transgressions reach one hundred twenty,
They bring illness—
Illness brings more misfortune than fortune.
At one hundred eighty transgressions—*a depletion*—
Livestock will not thrive.
At one hundred ninety—*a leak*—
Good fortune brings sickness.
At five hundred thirty—*a minor calamity*—
Miscarriages and child harm.
At seven hundred twenty—*a major calamity*—
Few sons, many daughters.
At eight hundred twenty-nine—*a retribution*—
Sickness, muteness, blindness, deafness.
At one thousand eighty—*a disaster*—
Sudden, untimely death.
At one thousand two hundred—*a ruin*—
Rebellious, lawless offspring.
At one thousand two hundred sixty—*a fault*—
No descendants, severed lineage.
At one thousand four hundred—*a blockage*—
Retribution extends to five generations.
At one thousand six hundred twenty—*an exile*—
No posterity remains.
At one thousand eight hundred—*a calamity*—
Slavehood, domestic chaos.
At one thousand nine hundred eighty—*a tyranny*—
Madness, epilepsy, insanity in the household.
At two thousand six hundred—*a violence*—
Death by blade or treachery.
At two thousand three hundred forty—*a void*—
Parental and sibling strife, mutual destruction.
At two thousand five hundred twenty—*an excess*—
Death by famine, evil sickness.
At two thousand seven hundred—*a harm*—
Deafness, witchcraft, spectral illness.
At two thousand eight hundred—*a calamity*—
Incestuous lust among kin.
At three thousand sixty—*a violence*—
Blindness, leprosy, mutilation.
At three thousand two hundred forty—*a mutation*—
Legal execution, clan annihilation.
At three thousand four hundred twenty—*a monstrosity*—
Begging in the marketplace; after death, the corpse is discarded.
At three thousand six hundred—*a sickness*—
Fulfilling the sentence of certain death."

*The Scripture of Marvelous Truth* (*妙真经*) proclaims:
*"No sin is greater than lust,
No disaster greater than greed,
No fault greater than miserliness—
These three are the chariot of calamity.
The small bring peril to the body,
The great destroy the family."*

In this world, there are three noble riches:
No guilt surpasses nobility,
No joy surpasses peace,
No wealth surpasses contentment.
Contentment is true sufficiency—
Heaven’s grace bestowed.
Ignorance of restraint brings harm to oneself.
To lose it brings sorrow,
To gain it brings joy—
Yet those who barricade their gates
Will surely face the undoing of their defenses.
Death and dishonor descend upon descendants,
Serving Heaven with virtue,
Not arrogance toward others.

**The Seventh Cause: Meritorious Deeds**
If the heart is coarse and wild,
Worldly habits remain unbroken;
If nature is gentle and yielding,
One must know the highest virtue—like water.
When evil ceases,
Good deeds naturally arise.

*The Scripture of the Cavern Spirit* (*洞神经*) declares:
*"The Heavenly Elder honors a hundred virtues."*

If a person has ten good deeds,
They will bear fortunate children.
If twenty,
Divine protection guards them.
If thirty,
Evil spirits are repelled.
If forty,
Death is averted.
If fifty,
Guilt is erased for life.
If sixty,
The Daoist Sovereign preserves them.
If seventy,
They connect with the Five Sacred Peaks.
If eighty,
They escape the name of death.
If ninety,
They must become celestial messengers.
If a hundred,
They ascend to the Nine Heavens.

*The Scripture of the Original Vow* (*本愿经*) states:
*"To learn the Dao of Ascension,
One must establish one thousand two hundred meritorious deeds.
With three thousand deeds fulfilled,
They ascend in daylight,
Saving those doomed to die."*

*The Record of Lists* (*列记*) teaches:
*"Those who study the Dao and cultivate practice
Must widely cultivate hidden virtues,
Show mercy to all beings,
Rescue those in peril,
Deliver those in distress,
Value the Dao over wealth,
Bestow kindness and virtue without stint,
Not sparing treasure to aid the destitute,
Invoking true qi with solemn oaths,
Bowing humbly in reverence."*

The True Person of the Great Void declares:
*"Feeding a hundred common folk
Is not as meritorious as feeding one virtuous person;
Feeding a thousand virtuous persons
Is not as meritorious as feeding one Daoist practitioner."*

*The Family Orders of the Laozi* (*老君家令经*) states:
*"A Daoist’s hundred practices
Must encompass a thousand virtues.
Though nine hundred ninety-nine virtues are fulfilled,
One unfulfilled virtue—
If moved by self-interest—
All prior merits are lost.
Only by guarding the body and mind,
Upholding precepts without fail,
Can one attain salvation for the world."*

*The Supreme Lord’s Edicts* (*太上科令*) command:
*"Teaching three to amend their faults—
This is one merit.
Persuading three households to reform—
This is one merit.
Assisting three destitute, orphaned, or widowed—
This is also one merit."*

「Promote and protect wealth and goods,
Yet harbor no resentment when gains are not contested—
Fulfilling this threefold act also counts as one merit.

Grieve over guilt and wrongdoing,
Heal and cure three afflicted souls—
This too is counted as one merit.

All such acts as these,
Seek them by their kindred nature.

*The Scripture of the Original Form* (*本相经*) states:
*"When merits reach ten thousand,
One ascends to the boundless void.
Those who recite the scriptures,
Each character as one merit—
When three thousand are fulfilled,
Their names are inscribed in the *Upper Purity Register* (*上清*).

If one can establish Daoist halls, altars, scripture chambers, fasting rooms, and kitchens,
And provide for Daoist practitioners—
Clothing, bedding, and all necessities given freely—
Such merits earn celestial rewards:
Food and garments come naturally,
As needed, without summoning;
When unused, they vanish.

If one is wealthy at home,
Yet further cultivates blessings and constructs virtuous deeds,
That person shall be recorded by the *Bright Register* (*明受记*) and attain Dao.

Even the most foolish and deluded
Shall have a time of attaining Dao.
Just as infants grow into elders,
So too shall those who persist in cultivating virtue
Sufficiently attain Dao.

*The Scripture of Great Peace* (*太平经*) declares:
*"Evil persons entering the Dao
Undermine the merits of the virtuous—
Like clumsy artisans ruining fine materials,
Or incompetent women spoiling silk and cloth,
They shall never achieve true merit.

Yet when evil persons oppose the virtuous,
It is like a sick man being offered fine food—
He refuses, for it is not to his liking,
And starves to death from eating only bitter fare.
So too, when evil persons hear virtuous teachings,
They recoil as if offered poison,
And cling ever more firmly to their wickedness.

Virtuous persons rejoice when they see virtue,
The worthy rejoice when they see the worthy,
The wise rejoice when they see wisdom,
Evil persons rejoice when they see evil,
And deceitful persons rejoice when they see deceit—
Each finds delight in their own kind.

If sons cannot exert themselves in serving their parents,
Or disciples cannot exert themselves in honoring their teachers,
Or subjects cannot exert themselves in obeying their rulers,
These three acts, though performed,
Shall not be counted as merit—
Their guilt cannot be absolved."

*The Scripture of Causes and Conditions* (*因缘经*) proclaims:
*"Aiding the destitute and rescuing those in peril—
The merit is vast and boundless.
Extending life and increasing longevity,
One shall enjoy eternal prosperity throughout their years."

It further states:
*"Accumulating virtue knows no limit;
Disseminating kindness should not be stingy.
Merit and virtue move the Immortal and True—
Their names shall naturally be recorded in the Celestial Registers."

*The Scripture of the Wondrous True* (*妙真经*) declares:
*"Those who do not cultivate virtue
Do not recognize the Primordial Sovereign,
Nor behold the Root of All—
They blaspheme Heaven, scorn Earth,
Deceive ghosts, and mock the spirits.
Their words are false, their intentions deceitful,
They harbor grudges and sow doubt—
Such are the unvirtuous.

The unvirtuous, in action, oppose Heaven,
In stillness, defy Earth.
Their speech harms living beings,
Their silence betrays the dead.
Thus they divide the Dao and sever virtue,
Scatter simplicity and dilute purity.
They twist words and manipulate meaning,
Cling to pretense while feigning benevolence.
Their potions and talismans bear no efficacy,
Their rituals rely on false celestial calculations.
They abandon truth for deceit,
Seeking only to topple the state.
They open paths of calamity,
Shut doors of loyalty and rectitude,
And curry favor with rulers
To maintain the nation’s favor—
Such are the schemers."

*The Scripture of Ascending Mystery* (*升玄经*) states:
*"Cultivating virtue yields virtue—
Even one’s spirits become virtuous.
Committing evil yields evil—
Even one’s spirits become evil.
Thus, half a person dwells in our Daoist halls,
Half in the demonic hells.
Their responses echo like a call—
None remain unanswered.

The Eighth Cause of Ascending to the Dao:
When one has cast off all afflictions,
Their secular attachments shall also fade.
They abandon familial affection to embrace the Dao,
Break free from worldly bonds to attain the True.
They transcend the Eightfold Path as their guiding principle,
And abandon the Tenfold Cycle to align their conduct."

*The Scripture of the Original Form* (*本相经*) further declares:
*"The Great Brahman King,
In his own heart, spoke thus:
*'My realm, with its Three Treasures’ power,
Should be revered and offered in gratitude to the Heavenly Sovereign above.*

Thus he selected his royal sons,
And the children of his ministers and subjects,
Choosing those of noble bearing,
First-rate intelligence,
And virtuous hearts—
All were made to leave home,
To uphold and propagate the True Law."

*The Scripture of the Original Form* (*本相经*) also states:
*"The King of Pure Harmony,
Issued an edict to ordain three thousand five hundred men and women of his realm,
Commanding the men to dwell in the *Habitual Spirits Hall* (*习灵庙*),
And the women in the *Seven Governors Hall* (*七政庙*),
To practice the Dao for the nation."

*The Original Record of the Tower Observation* (*楼观本记*) recounts:
*"King Mu of Zhou revered the Immortals,
And thus, through the guidance of Master Yin,
Constructed the Tower Observation Daoist retreat.
He then selected the recluse, You, and appointed him as a Daoist,
Setting him as a model of moral conduct for the people,
And ordering him to cultivate and expand the Dao’s teachings."

*The Scripture of the Original Form* (*本相经*) further relates:
*"The Model, Master Zi,
Together with four others,
Retreated into the mountains of Great Yuan to cultivate the Dao.
After thirty-six years,
He dreamed of the Immortal and True Daoists,
Their necks bearing luminous halos,
Countless and beyond reckoning.
After six more years,
He remained without any trace of worldly attachment,
While the four others returned home.
Master Zi wished to stay in the mountains.
The four doubted his attainment of the Dao,
And went to investigate—
Only to see the *Great Purity Jade Stele* (*太清玉碑*) inscribed with their names,
And two white cranes descending upon them,
Which died at the halfway point,
Transforming into *Yōuyǔ* birds (*犹预鸟*).
Three lifetimes later,
They were reborn in the Two-Faced Kingdom of the Western Lands,
With human form but lacking human sentiment."

It also states:
*"The King of Flaming Brilliance had a daughter,
Named Haoqiu,
Who at fifteen vowed to leave home.
She prayed to be reborn as a man,
And thus, through the Heavenly Sovereign’s radiant light,
Her female form ascended to the void—
In broad daylight, she ascended to Heaven.
After her departure,
The grieving king constructed
The Immortal Daoist Palace,
The Gathering of Spirits Platform,
Four surrounding halls,
And Three Teachers’ Chamber.
He further issued decrees throughout the land,
Urging all to leave home."

*The Thousand True Edicts* (*千真科*) decree:
*"How shall boys and girls,
Following the scriptures and precepts,
Be ordained by the king’s law?
What rites shall they perform to attain ordination,
And how shall they properly honor their parents thereafter?"

The response states:
*"To uphold and propagate the Dao’s lineage,
One must respectfully select those entering the Dao—
Choosing the noble, compassionate,
And those with Daoist hearts.
The teacher shall first instruct them in precepts and cultivation,
And after ten years of discipline,
They may be permitted to recite and study.

When the king ordains them,
They shall follow the king’s established rites and institutions.
They shall reside in the grand Daoist retreat,
Maintain strict order in the Mysterious Altar,
And construct the *Anran Pavilion* (*安阑纂*).

Following the method of *Bright Truth and Expiation* (*明真拔罪*),
They shall ordain men and women in advance.
At the altar’s southern face,
They shall stand in two rows—
Left and right—
And be ordained as they stand."

The response states:

*"When the officials stand in the southern row and the Daoist master in the horizontal row,
The Daoist master shall set a table before the horizontal row,
And recite the incense-offering hymn:
‘Great Sage, honored by heaven and humanity,
Revered through all ages!
Now we have a precious and noble one—
The great king of our realm.
Out of compassionate intent,
He universally commands entry into the True Dao.
Having entered the True Dao,
They owe it all to the king’s boundless virtue.
Forever free from worldly attachments,
They seek the sacred realm.
They shall surely gain the Dao’s blessings,
And together pursue the path of birthless enlightenment.’

After the hymn is finished,
The master declares to the newly ordained:
‘From this day onward,
You shall honor the True Sage and the True Dao,
Sever ties with kin and the secular world,
Each performing three bows,
And taking leave of the common life.
The first bow is to the king’s imperial virtue—
Endless as the heavens’ grace.
The second bow is to the county officials’ merit of liberation.
The third bow is to your living or deceased parents,
Who have granted you permission to leave the secular world.’

After completing the three bows,
The master seizes the first newly ordained by their clothing and crown,
And proclaims:
‘Great is the sacred transformation—
Its blessings extend infinitely,
The stars as crown,
The sun and moon as robes,
The Daoist path aligning with heaven’s way,
Unchanging through the four seasons,
Widely liberating all beings,
Forever transcending the three realms.’

The master commands the assembly to universally chant ‘Goodness!’
And strike the palms three times for expiation.
The former initiates also chant ‘Goodness!’
And strike the palms.
When all have completed three strikes,
They are collectively dressed in the Daoist robes.

The ceremony concludes,
And the officials present incense,
Each walking three times around the Daoist retreat.
The former initiates lead the way,
Then ascend the altar and recite the hymn of completion.
After the rites are finished,
A vegetarian feast is set.

When the feast is concluded,
Each thanks the Daoist disciples.
From the eldest to the youngest,
They sit in order before their parents and siblings,
Who have come to pay respects at their side.
Parents and siblings all address them as ‘disciple,’
And vow:
‘May the teacher surely attain enlightenment,
And join us, the disciples,
In entering the True Dao!’

Someone asks:
‘Among those who leave the secular life,
From young to old,
What are their ranks?’

The response states:
‘Among those who leave the secular life,
There are five ranks:
From seven to eleven years—*Puchē Daoist* (蒲车道士);
From twelve to fourteen—*Qīngxìn Daoist* (清信道士);
From fifteen to nineteen—*Shīhuì Daoist* (施惠道士);
From twenty to sixty—*Hónghù Daoist* (弘护道士);
From seventy to ninety—*Zhùchí Daoist* (住持道士).’

The text asks:
‘What is the guiding principle of the *Three Vehicles*?’

The response states:
‘The principle of the *Small Vehicle* is:
To dwell in seclusion among mountains and forests,
And to cultivate oneself for self-liberation.

The principle of the *Middle Vehicle* is:
To extend virtue universally,
And to aid and liberate all beings.

The principle of the *Great Vehicle* is:
To abandon merit and sever selfishness,
And to take the *Four Great Vows* of boundless compassion.

The text asks:
‘What merit does one gain from persuading others to leave the secular life?’

The response states:
‘To persuade others—men and women alike—
And even to give up one’s own children to leave the secular life,
Is like the merit of a world as numerous as dust grains—
Yet it still cannot compare to the merit of persuading others
To give up their children and leave the secular life.

Even if one constructs banners and pavilions
To reach the *Three Pure Ones’* realm,
The merit is still not as great as persuading others
To leave the secular life.

---
**End of the Twelve Precepts of Rituals and Ordinances**
**End of the Thirteen Precepts of Rituals and Ordinances***"

To establish rules and laws,
It is essential to rely on those capable of enforcing them.
Among the assembly, those ignorant of the Dao/Way—
No matter how many there are—
Must not be permitted to dwell together.

Those who dwell together must uniformly follow the sacred teachings,
Conduct themselves in accordance with ritual propriety in all actions,
Sever all evil with resolute intent,
And collectively safeguard all virtue.

For those who exhort evil-doers,
Their matters are addressed in other precepts.

**Precept:** The Dao/Way is pure and empty,
Seeking neither fame nor gain—
This is called the "family of the transcendent."
Yet among my disciples,
Many hoard money, treasures, cattle, slaves,
And cling to them without end.
Such persons sever the root of the *Three Treasures*,
Strip the blessings of all beings—
Though they may recite scriptures and uphold precepts,
They are all destroyers of the Dao/Way.

**Precept:** Those of great virtue/power,
Who preside over the assembly,
Must avoid even minor suspicion when those below err.
If any do not harmonize with the king,
Queens, attendants, ministers, officials, commoners,
Or with sons and daughters, junior Daoists, or the *Pure Ones*,
Or bear grudges from past or present disputes,
They must not be openly rebuked.
If punishment is warranted,
Summon them secretly first,
And speak privately.
If their transgressions are unbearable,
And they are hated by the assembly,
Then the matter must be presented to the assembly for judgment.

**Precept:** Those who have left the secular life
Must strive for simplicity and tranquility.
Unlawful conduct in action
Leads inevitably to heresy.

Unlawful conduct includes:
1. Extravagantly seeking wealth and provisions,
And boasting of one’s own abilities;
2. Greedily accumulating boundless riches,
And acting as matchmakers or fortune-tellers;
3. Forcefully claiming vast knowledge,
And gazing at celestial omens;
4. Associating with the *Pure Ones*,
And personally engaging in plowing, harvesting, or reaping;
5. Stirring discord among fellow Daoists,
And consorting with wicked friends;
6. Not taking the true Dharma/Way as one’s concern,
But allying with violent commoners;
7. Sitting or rising without distinction,
And confusing the ranks of the Dao/Way;
8. Not adhering to the proper precepts,
And sharing beds with the secular;
9. Venturing forth at night
Without holding a torch to light one’s own path;
10. Gambling with dice or *double-six*,
Engaging in robbery or other crimes,
Acting without restraint,
And failing to self-correct.

Those who enter the Dao/Way and follow the assembly
May remove such conduct.
If they do not self-punish,
They undermine the Dao/Way’s precepts.

**Precept:** All junior Daoists who visit eminent masters
Must refine their appearance and bearing,
Adjust their headgear and footwear,
Walk with measured dignity,
And bow three times with their foreheads touching the ground.
After bowing, kneel respectfully and say:
*"I, [name], am your humble disciple.
Though unworthy of the Dao/Way’s teachings,
I have come from afar.
I pray that the great master
Will graciously instruct and bind me.
Whatever I may hear,
I will never dare to disobey."*

The great master then addresses the assembly:
*"Now, Daoist [name],
From birth until today,
Has committed acts of anger and wrath,
Acts of robbery and theft,
Acts of greed and all manner of unvirtuous deeds.
Today, he bows in repentance,
And vows not to repeat his offenses.
He will now study the correct precepts,
And penetrate the profound principles of the Dao/Way.
After his confession,
He must rise only in accordance with what has been said,
And bow three times more before departing."*

**Precept:** Those who disturb the assembly
Often do not follow the true Dao/Way.
If they drink wine and act in disorder,
Or belittle those above and below,
They are fined in money or grain.
If they possess other goods or wealth,
And initially agree to contribute,
But later refuse or obstruct,
They are punished with rods.
If they seize property or cloth
To provide for the assembly,
Or if they subject others to harsh labor—
Cutting grass, felling trees, plowing fields, or reaping crops—
And the entire assembly cannot endure it,
The punishment is levied collectively.
If the Daoist assembly cannot resolve it,
They may be handed over to the king
To be judged by secular law.

**Precept:** If any do not follow the true Dao/Way,
And wander into other observatories,
Acting with arrogance or disrespect,
They must repay with wine and meat;
Or if they act as mediators in marriages,
Or purchase slaves for others,
Or other livestock and goods;
Or if they fabricate laws to suit the secular,
And are imprisoned for crimes,
Yet pardoned and released;
Or if they bribe officials
To escape punishment;
Or if they take stolen goods
And seek reconciliation through profit,
They must be charged according to the proper precepts
And punished as the law dictates.

**Precept:** Daoist male and female officials
Must each guard against disorderly conduct.
Daoists must not keep women,
Female officials must not keep men—
Each must maintain separation,
Cultivate purity of mind,
See no desirable form,
Hear no tempting sound.
If such temptations arise,
They must immediately report to the assembly.
If the assembly does not restrain them,
The king’s law will apply.

**Precept:** The private treasuries of great observatories
Are often in chaos,
Due to the eminent ones
Who fail to exercise caution,
Acting without restraint;
Or because the rules are not strictly enforced,
And those in charge occupy sacred lands
With impure and greedy hearts,
Luring junior disciples
To open wicked paths together,
Nurturing cruelty and evil,
Blocking the Dao/Way’s source,
Leaving true believers
With no foundation for their faith.

**Precept:** Those who enter the sacred treasury
Must open paths of virtue;
Yet harbor anger and strike;
All betray the Great Compassion.

Keeping livestock—cows, horses, dogs, or cats—without restraint, nurturing only the intent to harm, violates the precepts of purity. Such practices are forbidden to those who uphold the precepts.

**Precept:** There are ranks among people and degrees in the precepts. Some may outwardly observe the precepts yet inwardly lack sincerity, failing to cultivate stillness and retreat. Instead, they adorn halls and temples, gathering wicked companions and acting unlawfully. When the temple bell tolls for worship, they laugh and enter the assembly; when they see the virtuous conduct of the worthy, they slander them externally. This stems from their own lax discipline—how can they then unite the assembly and uphold the Dao/Way, letting righteous teachings flourish daily?

**Precept:** If one within the assembly acts unvirtuously, they should be privately admonished: *"The true path of the Dao is trodden by all—it has no fixed form, yet depends on people to propagate. The Ten Methods of the Daoist Way assist in spreading its teachings. When one hears of the sacred principles, they emulate them to perfect their own conduct. How can they commit faults and let others know?"*
Now, since the great virtuous ones commit no offenses, only this matter does not align with the Dao—let it be corrected immediately, like the moon waxing and waning, or the orchid’s fragrance returning. I humbly suggest this for the sake of upholding the law. Do not immediately report this to the assembly.

**Precept:** Those who have left the secular world must reside separately from laypeople and their households. If Ten Methods disciples travel through, their accommodations should be arranged based on their merit and conduct—high, middle, or low. Their living quarters must suit their station.

**Precept:** Each temple or hall must carefully consider separate lodgings for distinguished guests, hosting them in the main assembly hall. If travelers arrive from afar to stay temporarily, first inquire where they wish to reside. If their conduct is pure and their merit high, arrange them in distinguished lodgings. If their conduct is unremarkable, place them in ordinary quarters. If they are senior figures, they may be accommodated in lower ranks, but they must decline and change their lodging. If their conduct is unfit for their assigned place, they must withdraw humbly.

**Precept:** Cultivating stillness and entering meditation is the essence; wearing the yellow robe and headdress is the outward form. If one’s nature is as clear as frost, as pure as jade, and as refined as ice, they become a blessing for the world—without blemish, upholding the true precepts. Five parables illustrate this:
1. Like a noble family suddenly giving birth to a blind child, who after three months regains sight, filling the household with joy—those without precepts are like one blind.
2. Like polishing a mirror, gradually increasing its brilliance—those who uphold the precepts accumulate merit with each thought.
3. Like an infant growing step by step—those who uphold the precepts ascend from low to high.
4. Like a starving person who finally obtains food—without it, death is certain. Those who do not receive the precepts wander blindly through the Dao.
5. Like a ship crossing the great sea—those who uphold the precepts will surely traverse the sea of birth and death.

**Precept:** If kings, ministers, patrons, or artisans can benefit the assembly, they may be provided with food, firewood, and supplies upon request, with approval from the assembly.

**Precept:** Even those with power or malicious intent who might harm the assembly must be supplied with food—this is to prevent those ignorant of the law from destroying the community.

**Precept:** The temple’s funds and property must not be borrowed or used for private purposes. In cases of urgent illness, one may request permission from the assembly and repay double the amount afterward.

**Precept:** Non-Daoist possessions must not be given as offerings.

**Question:** What constitutes non-Daoist possessions?
**Answer:** Cattle, horses, slaves, and military weapons are such possessions.

**Precept:** During famines or chaos, people may seek refuge where resources are abundant. Those who can defend the assembly may be allocated supplies according to their needs.

**Precept:** If one speaks maliciously with a venomous tongue, associates with wicked groups, and harbors resentment, they must strive to suppress their emotions. If they cannot, they will cause grave harm to others.

**Precept:** Sacred and mundane items—statues, scriptures, and offerings—vary in weight and significance.
**Answer:** Temple bells, censers, banners, incense burners, canopies, sacred banners, and scripture rolls are sacred and thus heavy in merit. Hats, shoes, mats, robes, and undergarments are mundane and thus lighter. If one initially intends to donate a sacred item but later changes to a mundane one, they violate the Five Penal Laws. If one initially donates a mundane item but later upgrades to a sacred one, no offense is committed.

Statues also follow three ranks: celestial deities are supreme, true persons are middle, and lesser spirits are low, with Daoist masters at the lowest. If one initially intends to donate a high-ranking statue but later donates a lower one, they violate the Five Penal Laws. If one donates a low-ranking statue and later upgrades to a higher one, no offense is committed. The same applies to scriptures: *Upper Clarity* (Shangqing) is the great path, the *Great Net*; *Cave of Mystery* (Dongxuan) and *Soul Jewel* (Lingbao) are the middle path; and *Cave of the Gods* (Dongshen) and the *Three Sovereigns* are the lesser path. If one initially donates a great path scripture but later donates a middle or lesser one, they violate the Five Penal Laws. If one donates a lesser path scripture and later upgrades to a middle or great one, no offense is committed.

**Precept:** Stealing sacred or mundane items is punishable by the Five Grave Offenses. Stealing materials for statues is punishable by the Ten Evils. If one steals a statue from another’s home and claims it was found along the way, they incur the Five Tribunals and twenty-four million kalpas of suffering. If one creates a statue with the intent to claim it as a find, they suffer eight gates of torment for a million kalpas with no escape.

**Precept:** Those who have left the world must live in solitude, detached from worldly attachments, abandoning desires and honors, and dwelling in tranquil seclusion. If they fall into impurity, they will not be revered by the world.

**Precept:** If a mother, aunt, maternal uncle’s wife, or elder sister falls ill or faces urgent need, one may assist them without violating the precepts.

If others’ children are drowning or burning, even if one harbors impure thoughts, they must still be rescued—no violation of precepts shall occur.

**Precept:** When traveling along roads and encountering women with requests or begging for food and drink, one may only speak from ten paces away. If given food or drink, it must be placed on a bed or the ground, and taken later—never received directly into one’s own hands. If encountering women on the road, one must yield the path and pass by.

**Precept:** Fellow Dao/Way followers, differing from the secular world, are my lawful disciples. Together, they conceal each other’s faults and promote virtue, fostering mutual gratitude, so that near and far they are praised and deeply trusted. The saying goes: Benevolent people are few, the wicked many. In this age, men scrutinize minutely for flaws, slander and envy one another, unaware of their own faults while eagerly pointing out others’. Even if one does good, they will be maligned; unable to reform themselves, they instead seek to destroy virtue and align with vice—thus corrupting the Dao/Way and its teachings. This stems chiefly from such people. Great Virtue-wielders must be sternly admonished.

**Precept:** When lust arises, visualize:
- Encountering a raging tiger,
- Seeing a venomous snake,
- Beholding a king,
- Being caught by thieves before their master,
- Sitting in a house engulfed in flames,
- Boarding a sinking ship in mid-ocean.
With these six reflections, lust shall find no foothold.

**Precept:** Within shared monastic halls, pavilions, gardens, and lands—belonging to the Three Treasures—halls are for celestial reverence, pavilions for Dao/Way practitioners. If constructed, their rank must be observed. Private chambers are built by individual practitioners, their size and quality determined by their own merit during life. If no posthumous instructions are given, the community may dispose of them. If a lay novice constructs a dwelling and, after ordination, is reassigned elsewhere, they may retain it—though the land belongs to the Three Treasures and cannot be altered. If prior agreements exist among the assembly, these rules do not apply.

**Precept:** Novices newly entered into the Way, whose precepts are not yet complete, who rely on villages and do not dwell in monastic halls, lack revered elders to inspire awe and associate with cunning companions who seduce children, sharing beds and laughter, singing and drinking wine and eating meat. Secular people, seeing this, will despise the Way, deeming such conduct virtuous. Such actions extinguish the Dao/Way and shatter others’ reverence. Great Virtue-wielders must investigate and punish according to these precepts; if unable, the king’s law shall prevail.

**Precept:** If a practitioner of the Three Treasures gives their possessions to officials or the powerful, seeking personal gain, they will instead foster secular hopes. Even if they build temples, it is better to remain seated in meditation—such actions incur guilt, equivalent to theft.

**Precept:** Monastic halls and empty chambers, if excessively occupied, accumulate ten grave offenses:
1. Seizing vast wilderness lands and privately holding fields and residences;
2. Cultivating gardens and orchards for personal gain;

4. Keeping and trading slaves;
5. Cherishing and raising livestock;
6. Greedily hoarding delicacies;
7. Indulging in music and playthings;
8. Ornately decorating curtains and bedding;
9. Wearing extravagant attire;
10. Accumulating wealth with excessive diligence.

These ten acts, when held by one, do not constitute purity and emptiness, but rather bring misfortune. If one possesses them, they obstruct the mind of the Dao and hinder pure insight and wisdom.

**Precept:** If someone comes to beg, it is because of the Three Treasures’ alms, transmission of teachings, lectures, or scripture recitation, and receiving offerings. However, what is obtained through the Three Treasures must conform to the clear and true precepts, following the twelve-fold transmission penalties. If obtained otherwise, one may distribute it with goodwill, but must not accept impure things to make impure offerings—all such actions constitute wrongful violations of the law.

**Precept:** If disciples habitually fear cold, chaos, famine, and other calamities, and thus store silk, cotton, fabrics, and grains to prepare for emergencies and charitable giving, this is not forbidden.

**Precept:** If someone offers weapons, wild beasts, or unlawful items as alms, they must not be accepted.

**Precept:** If someone offers servants or slaves for service, they must not be accepted. However, if the servants can prepare vegetarian meals and uphold precepts, they may be received.

**Precept:** Monastic dwellings adjacent to secular households must close their doors at night. Failure to do so violates the precepts.

**Precept:** Practitioners must never speak of others’ hidden or shameful secrets, even if it means accepting the guilt of stealing temple bells or sacred images.

**Precept:** If hidden treasures are found in the wild and belong to the king, they must be returned. If the treasure contains a deed marking it as belonging to a scripture hall or temple, the finder may use it to construct or repair the designated place, following the inscription, without reporting to the king. Otherwise, it violates the ten grave offenses. If found on the roadside, the finder must return it to its owner. If the owner cannot be found, it becomes communal property.

**Precept:** Practitioners who witness fighting, filial disobedience, sibling disrespect, theft, or military conflict must return to their observatory, bathe in fragrant water, and enter contemplation. Failure to do so violates the precepts.

**Precept:** If Daoist priests or priestesses are unjustly mistreated by secular people, they may seek protection from their parents, siblings, or influential villagers.

**Precept:** When the Celestial Sovereign first attained enlightenment, only men were permitted to take monastic vows. How then did women gain admission to the Dao?

**Answer:** The Celestial Sovereign, through the merit of a husband-wife dispute, achieved enlightenment and became the Primordial Origin. Thus, men were universally permitted to take vows, while women, as those who awaited the Great Lady in the Fruitful Earth, were also allowed to join the Dao after scripture transmission and precept reception, becoming the Great Cavern Priestesses. Men who see women enter the Dao, having already received the Natural Law of the Old Lord, must respect and guide them according to the precepts, honoring the sacred lineage. If they see faults, they must not scold or slander them. When ordaining novices, they must defer to the Great Cavern Priestesses out of reverence for the law.

**Precept:** If someone’s donated lands, houses, or gardens are seized by others, they must be reclaimed.

**Answer:** If donated lands or gardens are seized, the original donor must be notified to reclaim them.

**Precept:** When encountering one’s teacher or their acquaintances on the road, one must step aside to avoid obstructing their path, not crossing in front of them. If speaking is necessary, one must bow deeply; otherwise, one must retreat without speaking.

**Precept:** When accompanying a venerable master, one must carry their staff and shoes. When ascending or descending perilous paths, one must stand close, supporting them with both hands, never letting go or straying far, regardless of age or companionship.

**Precept:** As a disciple’s duty, one must report before leaving and inquire after returning, greeting superiors and inferiors appropriately before resuming one’s duties.

**Precept:**
If the assembly is doubtful, I do not urge them to act;
If the assembly debates, I examine it carefully;
If the assembly acts arbitrarily, I follow what is fitting;
If the assembly travels, I do not conform to vulgar customs.
I remain consistently humble, respecting those before me.

**Precept:** For a master’s great virtue in governing the assembly, they must be broad and upright in establishing conduct, loving and disciplining the assembly, laboring diligently in their deeds, and maintaining solemn reverence in their morning rituals. Thus, superiors remain equitable without favoritism, and inferiors bear no resentment—this is the mark of great virtue.

**Precept:** If one performs good deeds, they should share the merit with those below, not claiming it solely for oneself.

**Precept:** Those who study the Dao must not expose others’ faults, boast of their own abilities, reject others’ counsel, or harbor grudges against themselves.

**Precept (from *Tai Zhen Science*):**
Novices of the same Daoist lineage and aspiration must mutually refine each other, proclaiming the wondrous transformations. Junior disciples must relay teachings to juniors without idle speech. If a servant, they must treat fellow disciples as brothers, united in heart, carefully observing the precepts and conduct. Their actions must be precise and strict, adhering to statutes and propriety, without negligence. They must seek their own blessings and pray for others without duplicity, devoting themselves earnestly to transforming vice into virtue. Violations shall be punished by the five penalties.

**Precept:** Even if a disciple surpasses others in talent and virtue, if they are junior in age, they must still yield with respect.

**Precept:** If others advance me, I shall accept their promotion with humility and not feign modesty. If they wrong me, I shall swear not to retaliate. If they exalt me, I shall swear not to presume. Though unable to yield in the moment, when circumstances demand it, or if it is fitting for them to instruct me, I shall defer three times. Even if later I hold a position of authority, my heart shall still honor my elders, and I shall not neglect the rites of respect as set by precedent.

Again, those who are acquainted must be called friends only if their Daoist aspirations are aligned—this is true friendship. Though they may share the same Daoist lineage, if their resolve and conduct are not steadfast, this is merely casual association. Some merely observe each other’s demeanor, hoping to form connections without genuine affinity. Such examples are numerous, and broadly there are five:
1. They come from similar family backgrounds,
2. Their official ranks are comparable,
3. They hold low status but possess influence,
4. They are of humble birth but wealthy,
5. Their age and appearance are alike.
All are worldly friendships.

In Daoist friendship, one must select companions whose aspirations align, valuing not their noble or lowly station but their shared Way and resolve. The humble must not seek the exalted, nor the exalted reject the humble. Forgetting distinctions of age and power, they unite only in shared Dao and virtue. Violations shall be punished by the seven penalties.

**Precept:** Though one may have formed bonds earlier, if later their official ranks diverge—whether as teacher and disciple, master and friend, or ruler and subject—they must sever ties and observe the rites of their current station. If the superior does not dissolve the bond, all must still act with humility and maintain the relationship. Those in higher ranks must not call inferiors to dissolve the bond; those in lower ranks must not pledge allegiance to superiors unless commanded by them.

**Precept on Ritual Platforms (Third in Sequence):**
The *Twenty-Four Lives Diagram* states: The Primordial Sovereign of the Dao extended an invitation to his guests in the Pure Hall, crafting a platform of yellow gold and a foundation of white silver.

The *Original Source Scripture* says: The Great Brahman King, having secured the teachings of the *Original Source Scripture*, built a grand hall within his kingdom and erected a magnificent ritual platform.

It further states: The Absolute Harmony King, who delighted in music, constructed three ritual platforms each month, repeating the cycle.

It also states: Master Lin established a platform, but a woman, relying on her beauty, mocked and seduced him, and afterward, he became disfigured.

It further says: At that time, a seven-jewel spirit platform emerged from the earth, rising a hundred or more zhang above the ground, with nine tiers and eight sides. Each tier had nine openings, and within them were eighty-one golden bells and jade chimes. They rang naturally at six times each day and night, all eighty-one sounding in unison.

It also says: The disciple of Still Mystery questioned the Celestial Sovereign: "Why does the ritual platform arise from the earth when the *Original Source Scripture* is being expounded?" The Celestial Sovereign replied: "When the Highest Emperor first expounded the *Original Source Scripture*, the Void King constructed this platform, but it sank into obscurity. Now that the *Original Source Scripture* is being expounded again, the platform emerges in response."

The *Five Talismans Sequence* states: The platform at the Northern Altar is where the Emperor sacrificed to the Celestial Sovereign.

**Precept on Memorial Steles and Gateways (Fourth in Sequence):**
The *Original Source Scripture* says: Fan Zezi, following his son Fan Shunzi, attained the Dao. Upon arriving, he saw only two white cranes on the Pure and Clear Jade Stele, and the inscription read: "In the past, we studied the Daoist scriptures together, adhering to the thirty-six sects, yet our hearts were not focused, and our aspirations failed to converge."

**Essential Ritual Statutes and Precepts (Completion of Volume Thirteen, Beginning of Volume Fourteen):**
To be continued in Volume Fourteen.

**Precept on Abstinence from Alcohol (From the *Three Caverns Daoist Canon* by Master Zhu Faman)**

The *Scripture on the Origins of Drinking* states:
*"To abstain from alcohol in ritual observance, harmonizing qi and nature."*

The *Taiping Jing* records:
The True Person asked: *"Why do people brew and drink alcohol, selling it along the roads? When ordinary folk drink, they become intoxicated—singing wildly, fighting to the death, or harming one another. Some commit adultery through it, others fall into ruin. The harms of alcohol are countless and incalculable.

Consider the four seas within: how many markets exist? In a single day, they consume billions of *dou* and *hu* of grain. Because of this, disasters extend even to the county magistrates, leaving descendants in lamentation. The heavens are moved, yin and yang are disrupted, and the qi of the Four Seasons and Five Phases are thrown into disorder.

Why, then, do people brew this madness as a drink? Should it be forbidden?"*

The Divine Person replied: *"Well spoken. Food and drink sustain life. My words may be followed in part or not at all—but let virtuous rulers decree:
From this day forward, any who drink alcohol without cause shall be punished as follows:
One *dou* – twenty lashes;
Two *dou* – sixty strokes;
Three *dou* – ninety strokes."*

「One *hu* – three hundred strokes. Let this be the standard, and widely promulgate it throughout the realm, so that the wise and virtuous may know the law and fear disgrace, and thus dare not transgress.

But what of the foolish among them who do offend? They shall be punished accordingly. Those who brew alcohol shall also be treated the same as those who drink it.

The Divine Person asked: *"What if there are travelers from afar, or households with the elderly and infirm, or rites honoring deities and spirits? How should they be handled?"*

The **Godperson** replied: *"If virtuous travelers from afar know the land has prohibitions, they shall abstain individually and not gather together. For households with the aged or sick, medicinal wine may be permitted for passage.

The *Qian Zhen Ke* (Scripture of the Thousand True Precepts) states: Those who have taken the **Dharma vow** (出家之人) must not drink alcohol. Yet some feign cold weather, claim stomach pains, and after drinking, change countenance. Others disturb the order of **supreme and subordinate** (尊卑), or accept offerings at **vegetarian meals** (斋), or engage in **ritual exorcisms** (章醮), or wander the roads, or respond to public and private invitations. Not only do they themselves violate **ritual decorum** (礼仪), but they also sully the **Dao community** (道众), extinguishing the **Dao Law** (道法) and hindering the **pristine propagation** (无生弘赞).

Yet, those who attend others’ requests should prioritize **purity and cleanliness** (清洁), and when moving between public and private affairs, they must uphold **proper decorum** (端严). Such instances are all violations of the **precepts** (律论).

The *Lingbao Jing* (Scripture of the Numinous Treasure) says: Those born who drink alcohol shall, upon death, be **condemned to draw endless oceanic waters** (连汲溟波水) to irrigate the **Four Great Waters** (沃四渎), or it is said that within the **Dao Law** (道法), some are permitted to drink alcohol.

The *Lingbao Jing* further states: *"To set wine upon the Floating Cloud Observance (浮云观), to drink high upon the Jade Purity Platform (玉清台)—how is this suddenly forbidden?"*

The answer is: *"This is a mistaken view."*

The *Taiping Jing* (Scripture of Great Peace) says: *"To transmute gold and jade into the **Thirty-Six Waters** (三十六水), gold as water becomes **golden nectar** (金浆), red jade as water becomes **glistening nectar** (琼浆), white jade as water becomes **jade nectar** (玉浆), or it is also called **jade essence** (玉液). The five do not intoxicate, and one must always reflect upon **pure conduct** (净行). Why, then, is this allowed?"*

The *Wu Yue Tu Xù* (Five Peaks Diagram Sequence) states: *"Abstaining from grains and taking medicinal elixirs according to the **Danlao Divine Prescriptions** (丹蜡神方), one may go a thousand years without eating, yet remain plump and not emaciated, and have the strength to bear heavy burdens. The prescription is as follows: **True cinnabar** (真丹) one pound, **mirabilite** (芒硝) half ounce, **Poria** (茯苓) one pound—all crushed and mixed together. Then, **white wax** (白蜡) two pounds is added, and the mixture is simmered nine times upward and nine times downward before forming into pills, which are swallowed whole like **Chinese parasol tree seeds** (梧桐子). Ten pills shall suffice for one month of abstinence from grains.

The **Laojun’s Method of Guarding the Middle** (老君守中赤丸法) involves the following: Take **white honey** (白蜜) one pound, **true cinnabar** (真丹) one pound, **one part of the prescription** (一方三两), and **white wax** (白蜡) one pound. First, finely chop the wax, then boil it in **copper vessels** (铜器) with wine until the wine boils. Next, add the cinnabar to the wine, then pour the mixture into a **copper vessel with cold water** (玲水). The wax solidifies again, and it is removed from the water. Repeat this process three times upward and three times downward. After the wax solidifies, discard the wine and place the wax alone in the copper vessel over a fire until it boils nine times, then remove it. Add the **white honey** (白蜜) to the wax and boil it once more. Then add the **true cinnabar** (真丹), stirring until they combine. When the mixture begins to congeal, quickly form it into pills the size of **bullet-shaped pills** (弹丸). To abstain from grains, take one pill daily, beginning with one pill on the first day, two on the second, and three on the third. Then resume with one pill, continuing for nine days, taking a total of eighteen pills as one dose. Afterward, one may **guard the middle** (守中). For forty years, one shall not hunger, and one’s complexion, **qi**, and strength shall remain unchanged. One may carry heavy burdens and travel long distances. If thirsty, one may drink a little cold water or a little wine, but must not eat anything else, for this makes one immune to poison—though it cannot prolong life or achieve **immortality** (长生). One’s body shall be light, and one’s strength shall not diminish, even when traversing mountains.

If one cannot swallow large pills, they may also be divided into smaller ones, ensuring the total amount of medicine is correct.

After fasting for seven days, the **royal alchemist’s full-moon day** (王相建满定日) is set for mixing the medicine. Do not allow children, women, or poultry to see it. Later, if one wishes to resume eating grains, boil **Chinese water chestnut** (葵子) one pint to make a thin gruel and drink it. The medicine shall then pass through. Before eating, one should gradually consume **gruel** (糜), not suddenly gorge oneself.

This method was used by **Master Shen** (沈君) to feed cattle and horses, who afterward no longer ate grass but remained fat as before.

A **secret and verified method** (秘验一方) involves boiling the **white wax** (洋蜡) three times upward and three times downward, then adding **white honey** (蜜) for one boil, and finally incorporating **true cinnabar** (丹) while stirring cold—thus forming the **Guarding the Middle** pill.

As for the **Four Calming Pills** (诸镇丸法), the prescription is as follows: **Poria** (茯苓), **dried yellow berry** (乾黄), **fine wood** (精木), **kudzu root** (楮实), and **ginseng** (人参), each one ounce. Crush and sift them, then mix with **white honey** (白蜜) five ounces and **white wax** (白蜡) two ounces. Combine with the earlier medicines, and pound them together for a thousand strokes. Take one pill the size of a **child’s fist** (小儿拳), then proceed to take the **large and small Four Calming Pills** (大小四镇).

After taking the pills, one should also take the **previously mentioned *Bole* pills** (栢叶丸) and **narrow Poria pills** (狭苓丸) as optimal.

The **Small Calming Pill** (小镇丸法) prescription is as follows: **cinnabar powder** (丹沙) half pound, **narrow Poria** (狭苓) half pound, **Agrimony root** (禹余粮) half pound, **Ophiopogon** (麦门冬) one pint, and **white honey** (白蜜) three ounces—totaling five ingredients. The **cinnabar powder**, **Agrimony root**, and **narrow Poria** are mixed with honey into a thin paste and pounded for three thousand strokes. The **Ophiopogon** (麦门冬) is stripped of its heart, and three ounces are divided into four pills, which are rubbed with the hands until they shine.

On the full-moon day at dawn, facing east, take one pill. Then take one pill every ten days, repeating this for another ten days, totaling four pills over thirty days. Those who have taken this medicine and survived are more than thirty in number.

When mixing the medicine, use the **royal alchemist’s full-moon day** (王相满日), and one must fast and abstain, not allowing children or women to see it. Do not eat **Chinese water chestnut** (葵菜), raw vegetables, or enter homes where there are births, deaths, or childbirths. This prescription is recorded in the *Changshi Book* (长史书).

The **Simple Method of Guarding the Middle** (守中径易法) is as follows: Take **fresh soybeans** (大豆) three pints, which must be alive. Rub them with the hands until they are smooth and warm. After finishing a meal, swallow them all at once. This shall suffice to abstain from grains for fifty days or a hundred days. If thirsty, drink water, but do not eat anything else. To stop the abstinence, consume two pints of hot gruel, and the soybeans shall pass through.

Another method states: Each day, bow twice in reverence, then take one pint of the prescription in the mouth. While reciting the *Liu Jia Tong* (Sixfold Passage), swallow it. After three days, divide the pint into three portions. For children, halve it.»

「Moreover, **red bean (赤豆)** and **pork**—swallow two pints of red bean or three pints of pork—also sustains one for a year. Another method: Take **large soybeans (大豆)** and **yellow millet (黄米)** three pints each, and swallow them all at once in one meal; this too allows one to abstain from grains for ten or five days.

When desiring to eat again, take **boiled hemp stalk ash (葵茎灰)** one square inch, seven times, then swallow it with **pork fat (猪膏)** and **sour milk (酪苏)**—this is also beneficial.

Another method: First chew **wax (蜡)** into a large piece like a walnut, then soften it thoroughly. Next, insert **a type of date (枣)** from the **Yi (猗氏)** region, along with the chewed wax, and swallow it all after thorough mastication. This will dissolve in the stomach, fortify the **true qi (正气)**, and cure illness while abstaining from grains.

Alternatively, simply consume **one square inch of wax (一方寸蜡)**, and it will suffice for one day.

Another method: Take **one pound each of white mulberry bark (檀榆皮)** and **white willow bark (白榆皮)**, with **one dou (斗)** of wine, steep them until dry, then re-steep them until all the wine is exhausted. Take a dose of **two liang (两)**, and after ten days, one can travel **three thousand li (里)**.

Another method: Take **black mulberries (桑椹)**, dry them in the sun, and pound them into a powder. Consume with **three he (合)** of water, three times daily, and one will not feel hunger.

Another method: On the **third day of the third month (三月三日)**, or the **thirteenth (十三日)** or **twenty-third day (二十三日)**, take **white dewberry roots (白茅根)**, clean them, wash them, and cut them finely. Consume with water, or dry them into a powder and prepare them in advance. Take **five or six doses daily**, but do not overeat. Long-term use will enhance one’s complexion and prevent aging, while also warding off **two types of malevolent spirits (伏鬼神)**.

Another method: Take **five jin (斤)** of **white dewberry (白茅)**, **one dou (斗)** of **rice (稻米)**, **one dou (斗)** of **fermented broad beans (豉)**, and **half a he (合)** of **salt (盐)**. Boil them in **three dou (斗)** of water until fully cooked and mushy. Initially, eat until full, then gradually reduce portions; one will not feel hunger. This method removes **cold and heat (寒热)**, prolongs life.

**Pine root (松根) method**: Take **pine roots (松根)** from the east-facing slope, strip off the white bark, and finely chop it. Dry them in the sun, pound into a powder, and sift. Consume them after a full meal; this allows one to abstain from grains. If thirsty, drink water.

Alternatively, simply take **pine leaves (栢叶)**, dry them in the sun, and form them into pills with **honey (蜜)**. Consuming these will prevent hunger. They can also be consumed as a powder with water or wine. Mix the powder with **white wine (白酒)**, dry it, and then pound and sift it again. Take it with wine or water. No matter the method, long-term use will lighten the body, prolong life, reduce body odor, and diminish sleep. The body will grow **green hair that turns white (绿毛还白)**, and one will abstain from grains without feeling hunger. When consuming, maintain consistency—this applies equally to pine leaves.

**Qi-abstinence grain abstention method (服气断谷法)**: First, close your mouth and swallow **internal qi (内气)**, avoiding inhalation of **external qi (外气)**. Perform **three hundred and sixty swallows (咽)** daily, or more if desired, up to a thousand—this is even better, achieved gradually. After ten days of grain abstention, one will naturally no longer feel the need to eat. If, after three days of abstaining from grains, one feels slight hunger or has **urine that is red-yellow without pain (小便赤黄无苦)**, consume **two or three dried dates (乾枣)**, up to nine per day. **Wine (酒)**, taken midday, can be **one or two pints (升)**; initially take small amounts, then gradually increase.

**Twelve-times-per-day qi swallowing method (食十二时气法)**: Always swallow qi at the following times: **midnight (夜半)**, **three times (九九)**; **cockcrow (鸡鸣)**, **eight times (八八)**; **dawn (平旦)**, **seven times (七七)**; **sunrise (日出)**, **six times (六六)**; **mealtime (食时)**, **five times (五五)**; **noon (禺中)**, **four times (四四)**; and **midday (日中)**, resume with **three times (九九)**.

Each swallow should be done with the mouth closed to allow the **qi (气)** to enter the abdomen. Swallowing once per hour is sufficient, then rinse and stimulate the **saliva (津液)**. Swallow multiple times in succession, and each time, face the corresponding direction for optimal results. Within **four or five days**, one may experience **head dizziness and extreme emaciation (头眩瘦极)**; after this, the effects will gradually improve.

**Consuming amulet water to abstain from grains (服符水断谷)**: Write the **Sixfold Passage (六甲)** *yin-yang amulets (阴阳符)* according to their respective day branches and stems, and place them in the prescription. Beforehand, keep the amulets in your mouth, then take them on their designated days, bless the water, and consume it.

When taking the *yin-yang amulets (阴阳符)*, face east at dawn, hold the amulet in your **left hand (左手)** and the water vessel in your **right hand (右手)**. Recite the blessing:

*"True Person [Name] loves and delights in the True Dao/Way (真道). Consuming the harmonious qi (中和之气).*
*In the **Tenth of the Heavenly Stems (甲子)**, the **Supreme Mysterious (太玄)** and **Jade Lady (玉女)** take wing and attend [Name]. Use the **kitchen’s location (厨所)** as the designated place, and remove what should be removed. Without hunger or thirst, whether the army is large or small, whether the people are few or many, all shall be sated.*
*After reciting, place the amulet in your mouth and let the water carry it down. Only the number of people varies.*

If you wish to make others abstain from grains, whether for a thousand or a hundred people, all should face east and stand in a row, bow twice, and each recite their own name. Then, write the amulets for them and let them all drink from **one vessel of water**.

*For the **Tenth of the Heavenly Stems (甲子旬)***, the **Supreme Mysterious Jade Lady (太玄玉女)** is **Winged Attendant (承翼)**.
*For the **Tenth of the Earthly Branches (甲戌旬)***, the **Yellow Jade Lady (黄素玉女)** is **Flying Censor (飞廉)**.
*For the **Tenth of the Firely Branches (甲申旬)***, the **Supreme Jade Lady (太素玉女)** is **Jewel Rock (琼石)**.
*For the **Tenth of the Earthly Stems (甲午旬)***, the **Descending Palace Jade Lady (降宫玉女)** is **Cloud-Longevity (云龄)**.
*For the **Tenth of the Heavenly Stems (甲辰旬)***, the **Precise Reverence Jade Lady (拜精玉女)** is **Spiritual Essence (灵素)**.
*For the **Tenth of the Woodly Branches (甲寅旬)***, the **Green Vitality Jade Lady (青要玉女)** is **Kindly Essence (惠精)**.
*These six names of the **Jade Ladies (玉女)** must be correctly invoked—do not err.*

**Jade Lord’s Resolute Abstention Amulet (玉君绝毅符)**: Write in **cinnabar (丹)** on paper and burn it at the end of the day. With **divine water (神水)**, face north and bow twice before consuming the amulet. Hold the water and face the moon, reciting three blessings:

*"Gold, wood, water, fire, and earth—*
*the **qi of the Five Stars (五星之气)**,*
*the **essence of the Sixfold Passage (六甲之精)**,*
*the **Three True (三真)** and **Heavenly Granary (天仓)**.*
*Pure **qi (清气)** constantly fills,*
*the **yellow text and red child (黄文赤子)** guard the center without tipping.*
*After reciting, knock the teeth three times and sip from the cup three times. Then swallow the amulet and drink **one pint (升)** of water.*

All the above methods are from the **Lower Scroll of Supreme Clarity (太清下卷)**.

**Laozi’s Method of Consuming Water to Abstain from Grains (老君服水断谷法)**: Regardless of whether it is a clear dawn, simply drink water whenever you feel the need. Fill a cup with water and bless it toward the water, reciting:

*"Gold, wood, water, fire, and earth—*
*the **qi of the Five Stars (五星之气)**,*
*the **essence of the Sixfold Passage (六甲之精)**,*
*the **True Person’s Heavenly Granary (真人天仓)**.*
*Pure **qi (清气)** constantly fills,*
*the **yellow text and red child (黄文赤子)** guard the center without tipping.*
*After reciting three times and knocking the teeth three times, drink the water. This will make one unaware of hunger or thirst, and if consumed again, it will have extraordinary spiritual efficacy.*

Recently, many people have gained strength from this method, recorded in the **Nourishing Life Canon (养生经)**. Later, the blessings were transcribed, differing slightly from the original. No other editions have been verified for comparison.

*The **Dao Basis (道基)** states*: The blessing for abstaining from grains among the **Six Livestock (六畜)** is as follows:

*"All things contain water—*
*like **living water (生水)** entering the abdomen."*

「All **spirits (万神)** tremble in fear—
**pulsed beings (有脉之物)** may be severed, **non-pulsed beings (无脉之物)** cannot be.
The **Six Livestock (六畜)** are all drawn toward the **King (王)**.

**Treatment and invocation (治祝缘)** from *The Secrets of Ascending the True (登真隐诀)*:
All practices of **moving (诸行事)**, **retention (存想)**, and **invocation (祝愿)** are included here.
Now, I briefly extract a few key **urgent (急)** methods.

Whenever traversing **treacherous paths (危崄之路)** or **ghostly temples (鬼庙之间)**,
or encountering any **doubtful or perilous (疑难)** places in mind,
or when the heart harbors **subtle misgivings (微忌)** about those who tread upon them,
one should first **reverse the tongue (反舌)** inward,
then **reverse the tongue upward (反舌向上)** toward the throat’s pillar.
Before invoking, **forcefully swallow saliva (申之咽唾)** three times,
then with the **left hand’s second and third fingers (左手第二、第三指)**,
**twist the nostrils (捻)** below the **human middle (人中)**—
the **nasal septum’s inner boundary (鼻中隔孔之内际)**—
**thirty-six times (三十六过)**, until the breath stills.
**Do not count with raised fingers (勿举指计数)**.

This **urgent pressing (急按)** of the **mid-yin point (中阴数)**—
a single breath as one **pass (过)**—
the **nasal septum’s inner boundary (鼻中隔孔之际)**, known as:
**Mountain Source (山源)**, also called **Ghost Well (鬼井)**,
**Spirit Pool (神池)**, **Perverse Root (邪根)**, **Soul Terrace (魂台)**.
Afterward, these five names appear in the invocation,
so they are listed first.

**Madame Purple Clarity (紫彻夫人)** says:
*"Mountain Source (山源)** is the root below the **human middle (人中)**;
it lies beside the **small human valley (小入谷)** beneath the nose.
Piercing it with a needle also treats sudden death and **covering the corpse (掩毕)**.
Afterward, **knock the teeth seven times seven (叩齿七七通)**,
then press the **palm of the hand (手心)** over the nose,
before removing the hand, **still knocking the teeth (仍叩齿竟)**.
Then advance the **left hand’s palm (左手掌)** to cover the **nose and mouth (鼻口)**,
reaching to the **hairline (发际)** and covering the **Bright Hall (明堂)** above.
Thus, **facing the eyes (临目)**,
while inwardly retaining the **Three Lords of the Bright Hall (明堂中三君)**,
use a **bell and mirror (铃镜)** to flash **red light (赤光)** upon them,
then **retain the Red Child of the Earthly Pill (泥丸赤子帝君)**,
who holds the *Great Cavern True Scripture (大洞真经)*,
and **threaten them with its majesty (以威摄之)**.

Then softly invoke:
*"The Vermilion Bird (朱鸟) soars through the heavens,
its **spiritual might (神威)** internally expands—
Mountain Source’s **four guardians (四镇)**,
Ghost Well’s **flight into exile (逃亡)**?
Spirit Pool **exhales its breath (吐气)**,
Perverse Root **submits in concealment (伏藏)**,
Soul Terrace **shines with clarity (四明)**,
Jade Chamber’s **resplendent brilliance (琼房玲琅)**,
Jade Gate’s **towering grandeur (玉莫巍峨)**,
sits enthroned in the Bright Hall.
With a **wave of the hand (手挥)**, summon **Purple Mist (紫霞)**,
and **erect the head (头建)**, invoke the **Morning Light (晨光)**.
Reciting the *Thirty-nine Chapters of the Great Cavern True Scripture (洞经三十九章)*,
within which lies the **Divine Tiger (神虎)** that repels evil,
**Severing the Mountain (截岳)** and **beheading the Ridge (斩冈)**,
wild beasts **flee like cattle (奔牛)**,
**swallowing blades (冲刀)** and **devouring spears (吞枪)**,
**lifting mountains (揭山)** and **plucking the heavens (攫天)**,
the **Divine Sparrow (神雀)** strikes the **Poisonous Dragon (毒龙)**,
**six leaders (六领)** exhale **flames (吐火)**,
and **consume the King of Ghosts (啖鬼之王)**—
**Thunder Pig (电猪)** and **Lightning Sire (雷父)**,
**dragging stars (掣星)** and **flowing crosswise (流横)**,
**Jackal’s (枭)** howling and **scorching (磕驳灼)**,
**counter-winds (逆风)** and **horizontally rampant (横行)**,
**heavenly beasts (天禽)** arrayed in **nets (罗陈)**,
all **beside me (在我傍)**.
A **ten-thousand-zhang flame (吐火万丈)** dispels **inauspiciousness (不祥)**,
**military precision (军精)** opens the **Dao (启道)**,
and **seals the Mountain Village (封落山乡)**.
**Thousand spirits and hundred souls (千神百灵)** all **bow and submit (并首叩类)**,
**the Marshal of Dew (泽尉)** presents the **lamp (捧灯)**,
to **burn incense for me (为我烧香)**.
Wherever I go or tread,
**all souls (万灵)** pay homage in welcome.
After the **nineteen stanzas (十九韵毕)**,
**knock the teeth three times (叩齿三通)**,
then open the eyes and remove the left hand.

Thus, **stirring the spiritual roots (感激灵根)**,
**heavenly beasts (天兽)** come to guard me,
**thousand spirits (千精)** tremble and submit,
**none dare harm my qi (莫干我气)**.

These are the **names of divine beasts and spiritual officials (神兽灵司之名号)**,
so they may be invoked to **shock away evil spirits (震却精邪)**.

The above is the **Supreme Invocation to Restrain Evil (遏邪大祝)** from the *Great Cavern True Scripture’s (大洞真经) Highest Inner Chapter (高上内章)*,
recorded by **Chief Clerk (长史)**.

**The Northern Emperor’s (北帝) Method to Slay Ghosts (杀鬼之法)**:
First, **knock the teeth thirty-six times (叩齿三十六下)**,
then invoke:
*"O **Heavenly Scourge (天蓬)**! O **Heavenly Scourge (天蓬)**!
**Nine Elements (九元)** slay the **child (杀童)**,
**Five Ding (五丁)** command the **officers (都司)**,
**High Siao Northern Lord (高刁北公)**,
**Seven Rectitudes and Eight Spirits (七正八灵)**,
**Supreme Sovereign’s (太上) Vast Wrath (浩凶)**,
**long-skull giant beasts (长颅巨兽)**,
holding the **imperial bell (帝钟)** in hand,
**three white jackals (素枭三神)**,
**strictly mounted upon the **Kui Dragon (夔龙)***,
**Sword Spirit King (威剑神王)**,
**severing evil (斩邪)** and **eradicating traces (灭踪)**—
**purple qi ascends the heavens (紫气乘天)**,
**crimson mist surges upward (丹霞赫冲)**,
**devouring demons (吞魔)** and **consuming ghosts (食鬼)**,
**crossing the body (横身)** to **drink the wind (饮风)**,
**black tongue and green teeth (苍舌绿齿)**,
**four-eyed old man (四目老翁)**,
**Heavenly Ding’s (天丁) mighty laborers (力士)**,
**threatening the South (威南)** to **subdue the ferocious (御凶)**,
**Heavenly Steed (天驺)** incites the **rebellious (激戾)**,
**threatening the North (威北)** to **terrify the sharp (吓锋)**.
**Thirty myriads of soldiers (三十万兵)** guard my **ninefold enclosure (卫我九重)**,
**clearing a thousand-li path (辟户千里)**,
and **repelling inauspiciousness (却不祥)**.
Should any **minor ghosts (小鬼)** dare to approach,
**the Heavenly Axe (玃天大斧)** will **execute them with five punishments (斩鬼五刑)**,
**Emperor Yan’s (炎帝) blood-splitting wrath (裂血)***,
**Northern Emperor’s (北帝) bone-searing judgment (然骨)***,
**Four Bright Ones’ (四明) corpse-shattering might (破骸)***,
**Heavenly You’s (天猷) annihilation of their kind (灭类)***,
and **one strike of the divine blade (神刀一下)**—
**all ten thousand ghosts (万鬼)** will **collapse in rout (自溃)**.*

**Thirty-six four-character stanzas (三十六句四言)**,
each followed by a **peck of the teeth (啄齿)** as a **pause (以为节)**.
A total of **thirty-six plus six stanzas (凡三＋六句)**,
each separated by **thirty-six plus six pecks of the teeth (则三＋六啄齿)**.
Whether in **midnight darkness (冥夜)** or **broad daylight (白日)**,
this invocation is **always effective (得祝为恒)**.

This has **no fixed time (无正时节)**.
When engaged in **spiritual cultivation (修事)**,
during **leisure hours (有闲)** or at **dawn and dusk (及晓夜之际)**,
or in **all shadowy and obscure (诸疑暗)** places,
one may invoke it. Within are **threefold references (三被)** to ghosts:
their **eyes will be blinded (盲烂)** and they will die.

This refers to **all killing ghosts (杀鬼)**,
**evil ghosts (邪鬼)***, and those of **darkness in heaven and earth (天地暗)**,
as well as **malevolent spirits (恶强)** and **ghostly cohorts (鬼辈)**,
who upon hearing this invocation will die.
It does not apply to **the souls of the deceased (死之魂爽)** that become ghosts,
but to those **ghostly eyes (鬼眼)**—
even they have **eyes (睛)**—
so when blinded, they will perish.

The **upper invocations (上神祝)** are all **names of ghost-slaying officials (斩鬼之司名)**.
Within the invocation are **names of the Underworld (酆都)**,
and **all spirits and deities (及诸神名字)**—
thus, ghosts hear and **die in terror (怖死)**.
Grant them **command of a thousand southern soldiers (许其领威南兵千人)**,
and they will be the **ones who subdue the ferocious (即此御凶者)**.
**Emperor Yan (炎帝)** is the **Great Sovereign (大帝)**,
**Four Bright Ones (四明)** are the **various lords (诸公)**.

**The Northern Emperor (北帝)** conceals this method,
for if a **ghost-slaying Northern Emperor (建鬼杀人)*** encounters this invocation,
he **cannot prevail (便不可复得)**.
Thus, the method is kept secret.
If **mortals (世人)** obtain this invocation,
and **constantly practice it (恒能行之)**,
they will **never die (便不死)**.
For **all deaths (人之死)** are caused by **ghosts (所杀)**.

Now that this invocation **cannot be seized (既不可取)**,
one will **never die again (不复死)**.
Both **men and women (男女)** and **all ages (大小)** may perform it.
Only those who **do not know this invocation (患其不知此祝)*** suffer.

The **wise (智者)** who **secretly employ it (密用)***
will **face no limits (无限)** in size or age.
This is spoken to **inform the Chief Clerk’s family (令告长史家)**:
if one **suffers from illness (困病)** and practices this,
one will **recover instantly (立愈)**.
If one **even flees in thought (思既幸走)***,
how much more will **disease be dispelled (病岂不除)**?

**Knocking the teeth (叩齿)**,
one should **face the eyes (临目)*** and **retain the five viscera (存神五藏)**.
When the **five viscera (五藏)** are fully present,
the **five spirits (五神)** will naturally **reside within (自然存在)**.

This means that **initially (初)**, during the **thirty-six knocks of the teeth (叩齿三十六时)**,
one should **face the eyes (临目)*** and **introspectively observe (内视)** the **five viscera (五藏)**,
sequentially **retain them (以次想之)**,
and **clearly distinguish (皆令分明)** the **spirits of the five viscera (五藏之神)**,
ensuring they **are fully present within (备在於内)**.
Then one may **ride upon the upright (乘正)** to **ward off evil spirits (御邪神)**,
and **to exterminate ghosts (以诛鬼)**.*

The **Zheng** capital concealed this incantation,
now it is secretly recited—
do not reveal it.
Only those who **follow the Dao/Way (有道者)**,
should **keep it secret together (宜共秘之乎)**.

Though this is not the **most exalted of sacred rites (高贵之至典)**,
it is the **supreme defense against ghosts (杀鬼之上卫)**.
Once **malevolent and fierce (凶恶)** energies are dispelled,
the **upright qi (正气)** can be restored.
Moreover, it serves as the **essential method (要法)** to **exterminate evil spirits (诛邪)** and **restrain those who test (遏试)** the practitioner—
yet most people **dismiss its simplicity (轻其浅少)**,
often **leaking it (传泄)**,
causing the **spiritual incantation (神祝)** to fail,
the **ritual recitation (呵执)** to be ineffective.
This is truly **blameworthy (殊为可责之也)**.

Yang Jun’s clerk **wrote two volumes (书两本)**.
While resting on the pillow, **leaning against (枕)** the *Daoqi Jing* says:
*"If the pillow is too high, the liver contracts (枕高肝缩),
if the pillow is too low, the lungs are obstructed (枕下肺塞).
Four cun is the balanced height (以四寸为平),
and the bed should be level (枕席令平),
then the breath will become long (其息乃长)."*

The *Daolin Pin* and *Guangmen Jing* state:
*"When **cultivating the qi (行气)**,
the pillow should be raised two and a half cun (枕高二寸半)."*

The *Taqing Jing* says:
*"The **method of lowering the spirit (下神枕法)**:
On the fifth day of the fifth month,
or the seventh day of the seventh month,
take the **wood of the *zhi* tree (栢)** from mountains and forests as a pillow,
one foot two cun long (长一尺二寸),
four cun high (高四寸),
with a hollow center holding one dou two sheng (空中容一斗二升).
Its width is three cun five fen (广三寸五分),
and its top is covered with a **red cloth (相心赤)**,
four fen thick (厚四分).
The **lowering method (下之钻)** is well-applied,
and the cover has **three rows of forty-nine holes (为三行四十九孔)**,
totaling **one hundred twenty holes (凡百二十孔)**.
For every **grain-sized cavity (容一黍栗)**,
insert medicine (乃取药).
Inside, use **xiōng wú (芎藭)、dāng guī (当归)、bái zhì (白芷)、xīn yí (新夷)、dú héng (杜衡)、shān jìng (山蓟)、gé běn (革本)、mùlán ròu (木兰肉)、tú róng (徒蓉)、bó shí (栢实)、cāng yǐ (苍苡)、mí wú (蘼芜)、yǒu dōng huā (欵冬花)、bái héng (白衡)、qín jiāo (秦椒)、shǔ jiāo (蜀椒)、guì (桂)、gān jiāng (乾姜)、fēi lián (飞廉)、fáng fēng (防风)、rén shēn (人参)、jú gěng (桔梗)、bái wēi (白薇)、jīng shí (荆实)**—
a total of **twenty-four substances (凡二十四物)**,
to correspond with the **twenty-four breaths of the year (二十四气)**.
Additionally, **eight toxic medicines (八毒药)** are added,
to correspond with the **eight winds (八风)**:
**wū tóu (乌头)、fù zǐ (附子)、lí lú zào (梨芦皂)、jiá wǎng cǎo (荚罔草)、fán shí (矾石)、bàn xià (半夏)、huá yīn (华阴)、xì xīn (细辛)**—
bringing the total to **thirty-two substances (都合三十二物)**.
All are **ground into powder (□咀)**,
with the **toxic medicines (毒药)** placed beneath the **fragrant medicines (香药)**,
and the **pillow is filled in sequence (按次满枕中)**,
then enclosed in a **cloth pouch (为布囊)**.

If one **wraps the pillow with clothing (以衣枕之)** for **one hundred days (百日)**,
the **sinews and bones will become strong (筋骨劲强)**,
and the **face will radiate luster (面有光泽)**;
for **one year (一年)**,
the **entire body will be fragrant (身尽香)**.

「Four years’ use will turn white hair black,
and cause new teeth to grow.

Normally, one should prepare a separate **cloth pouch (帏囊)**,
and when lying down, immediately rise to cover oneself with it.
Do not let the **qi (气)** escape,
and each year, renew the medicine,
totaling **thirty-two substances (三十二种)**.
For each substance, the amount is **one dou and two sheng (一斗二升)**,
then crushed into **three he (三合)** of powder,
or **seven jiu (七圭)** and **eight cuo (八撮)**—
which is **four parts of a cuo (五分撮之四)**.

Moreover, since the **nature of medicines varies (药体有虚实)**,
one should also weigh them proportionately.

According to the *Dà Sàn Jiā Pǐn Yào* (大散家品药),
the following are the traditional **dosages (旧率)**:
**Róng (蓉)**, ten **liang (两)** and sixteen **zhu (铢)**, yields one **sheng (升)** and four **he (合)**;
**Gān jiāng (乾姜)**, three **liang** and twenty-two **zhu**, yields five **he**;
**Guì (桂)**, three **liang** and fourteen **zhu**, yields five **he**;
**Fáng fēng (防风)**, two **liang** and four **zhu**, yields four **he**;
**Jiégēng (桔梗)**, two **liang** and nine **zhu**, yields four **he**;
**Rén shēn (人参)**, one **liang** and twenty **zhu**, yields three **he**;
**Huáng qín (黄苓)**, seventeen **zhu**, yields one **he**;
**Xì xīn (细辛)**, one **liang** and twenty-one **zhu**, yields three **he**;
**Fù zǐ (附子)**, nineteen **zhu**, yields one **he**;
**Xiá líng (狭苓)**, eighteen **zhu**, yields one **he**;
**Fán shí (矾石)**, one **liang** and six **zhu**, yields one **he**;
**Mǔ lì (牡砺)**, sixteen **zhu**, yields one **he**.

These are the **standard measurements (准量)** for the respective medicines.
For the **White Tiger (白虎)** days within each **ten-day cycle (旬)**,
use the medicine that **counteracts the corresponding cycle (所克本旬)**:
The **White Tiger** day in the **Jiāzǐ (甲子)** cycle falls on **Chén (辰)**,
in the **Jiāxū (甲戌)** cycle on **Mǎo (卯)**,
in the **Jiāshēn (甲申)** cycle on **Wǔ (午)**,
in the **Jiāwǔ (甲午)** cycle on **Zǐ (子)**,
in the **Jiāchén (甲辰)** cycle on **Yín (寅)**,
and in the **Jiāyín (甲寅)** cycle on **Yǒu (酉)**.

When entering the mountains to **ward off tigers (辟虎)**,
this must also be done according to the **fixed precepts (定诀)**.

One must **strictly observe the rules of weighing and preparation (秤仪戒律)**,
as detailed in the **Fourteenth Chapter of the *Mìaojùan* (妙卷)**.」

The **Three Cavern Daoist** Zhu Faman compiled the **Daoist Rites for Life and Death**, with a preface.

Faman, recognizing my youthful ignorance,
could not fully grasp the **pulse regulations (脉制)**,
and thus harbored deep doubts.

Upon reflection, I found **Master Da Meng Jingyi (大孟景翼)**,
whose courtesy name was **Fumu (辅明)**,
who, when questioned by **Prince Wenhui of Qi (齐文惠太子)** on the Daoist rites for the dying,
quoted the *Lülián Jīng (法轮经)*:
*"The teacher is like a father.
If I had no teacher, I could not see the scriptures;
now that I see the teachings, I know the Dao."*

The *Huángluàn Jiǎnwén (黄箓简文)* records the **precepts for honoring teachers (事师之科典)**.
Thus, in studying the Dao and cultivating the Way,
one must keep the teacher before them.
Having received their **initiation (开度)** and **transmission (禀佩经图)**,
they rescue the three worlds and safeguard the living and the dead.

The scripture states:
*"He who gazes upon the sacred texts
shall join the Nine Ancestors as an Immortal."*

Thus, the **True Persons** say:
*"If I had no teacher, I could not learn the Dao nor attain it."*

Those who manifest in this world in bodily form
all reveal the **trace of the teacher-disciple lineage (师资之迹)**.
Some, when departing, leave behind a **sword or staff (剑杖)** as a sign—
this is but a **transference of form (托物)**,
to show that **transformation is ever-changing (变化无常)**.

Only those who embody the Dao and penetrate the **True (冥真)**
naturally transcend the **fear of death and love of life (欣生恶死)**.

For **human nature** inherently bears **filial piety (孝性)**,
moving even the heavens and earth,
reaching the divine and the numinous.
The sorrow of loss arises spontaneously at every turn—
though wise and foolish differ in degree,
their love and aversion remain unchanged.
Thus, the **Daoist and the secular** diverge,
and the **Great Way** remains unaltered.

In ancient times, **Confucius**, as the **Master of Ruism (儒学之师)**,
only taught the **rites of this world (世间典礼)**—
burial beneath the **sacrificial mound (洒水之上)**,
with disciples in **three years of mourning (服三年)**,
and **Zigong dwelling in a hut by his grave for six years (庐住冢边六载)**.
A hundred families followed him in residence,
earning the name **"People of Kong’s Village (孔里之民)"**,
with sacrifices offered in all four seasons without ceasing.

How much more so in the **Daoist tradition (道家法门)**,
where the **master-artisan (宗匠)** bestows **virtue and splendor (德瑜)** upon the **Three Realms (三界)**,
and **conduct transcends the Six Paths (六道)**—
furthermore, uniting with the **Ultimate Truth (至真)**,
merging with the **Eternal Stillness (常寂)**.
This is where the **inner and outer realms diverge (内外悬殊)**,
beyond the grasp of mere **emotion and calculation (情数)**.
Thus, I establish these **rites (立仪)**,
to exhaustively outline them.

Moreover, **Little Meng (小孟)** refined the earlier rites,
adding what was most essential.
**Stone Well Master (石井公)** composed his work,
citing the *Bàopǔ Nèipiān (抱朴内篇)*:
*"In the Han dynasty, Empress Dowager followed Master Xiahou Sheng in studying the *Shàngshū (尚书)*,
and granted him **one hundred jin of gold** and countless other gifts.
Upon his death, she bestowed **two million coins** on his family
and wore **white mourning for five days (素服五日)**.

Emperor Cheng, while still in the **Eastern Palace (东官)**,
received the *Lúnyǔ (论语)* from Zhang Yu,
and immediately **elevated his status**,
granting him the title **Marquis of Guannei (关内侯)**,
with **one thousand households in fief (食邑千户)**,
and the post of **Grand Officer of Light (光禄大夫)**,
along with **one thousand jin of gold**.
Later, he was promoted to **Chancellor (丞相)** and ennobled as **Marquis of Anchang (安昌)**.
When Yu grew old, he was granted a **luxurious carriage with four horses (安车驷马)**,
**one hundred jin of gold**, and **one million coins**.
When Yu fell ill, the heir apparent **personally knelt at his bedside (亲拜禹床下)**.

Emperor Zhang, while still in the **Eastern Palace (东宫)**,
received the *Xiàojīng (孝经)* from Huan Rong.
Upon ascending the throne, he appointed Rong as **Grand Master of Sacrifices (太宰)**.
The emperor **visited Rong’s home**, seating himself facing east to converse,
and held a banquet for **hundreds of officials and Rong’s disciples**.
The emperor **personally held the scripture and expounded its meaning (持业赞说)**,
granting Rong the title **Marquis of Guannei (关内侯)**,
with **five thousand households in fief (食邑五千户)**.
When Rong fell ill, the emperor **visited his home**,
entering the lane **on foot (下车把卷)**,
hurrying as if paying **disciples’ respects (趋如弟子之礼)**.
Upon Rong’s death, the emperor **mourned in white (素服举哀)**."*

All these were for **teaching a single scripture in Ruism (儒学指教一经)**,
yet the **reverence for the teacher was so profound (崇师殷勤)**—
how much more so for those seeking the **True Essence (求真要)**,
who do not follow the **scriptural rites (经诰)**?

Thus, I establish these **rites and precepts (立典仪)**,
instructing the **disciples of the lineage (门中子弟)**,
as compiled by **Master Zhang Xu (张续先生)**—
though some rites differ, some align,
yet these **four sets of rites (四仪)** lack uniformity,
causing later generations to **follow conflicting interpretations (遵奉随执见乖)**.

Now, I **harmonize the four traditions (会四家)**,
condensing them into one volume,
with my **humble annotations (率愚注诀)**,
balancing **differences and similarities (并酌异同)**,
adapting to the **fluctuations of the age (随世沉浮)**,
and adjusting with the **times (逐时增减)**.
Moreover, when the teacher is present,
one must **keep a respectful distance from the table (远离几筵)**,
inquire about their **comfort and health (咨问寒温)**,
and **submit petitions (凭启疏)**.
For fear that **later learners may misjudge priorities (不识重轻)**,
I now record what I have observed,
titling it the *Daoist Rites for Auspicious and Inauspicious Occasions (道士吉凶仪)*,
encompassing **ten examples (合十例)**,
as detailed below:

**First: The General Announcement Rite (通启仪)**
**Second: The Condolence and Funeral Rite (吊丧仪)**

**Third: The Sickness and Illness Rite (疾病仪)**
**Fourth: The Initial Burial Rite (初死小殓仪)**

**General Announcement Rite (通启仪) – Revised Format:**
When a **Magistrate or County Official** first arrives,
the Daoist priest delivers a **General Announcement (通启)**.

**Format:**
*"[Name of Daoist Observatory] Daoist Priest [Surname] respectfully petitions (启)."*

*"Respectfully submitted to the Honorable Magistrate (明使君) and the Honorable Chamberlain (记室明府) and attendants (侍者)."*

*"Daoist Priest [Surname], in deep reverence, humbly acknowledges that the Honorable Magistrate’s (or County Official’s) virtue and governance are vast and illustrious, their benevolent decrees clearly proclaimed. By their grace, they have deigned to oversee this humble domain, bringing joy to all within the Daoist and secular communities alike. Though **Meng Chun remains cold (犹寒)**, I dare not presume to inquire after your esteemed health. This humble priest, afflicted by illness, cannot attend as customary. With deepest regret, I submit this petition without further elaboration. [Surname] respectfully petitions (谨启)."*

*All subsequent petitions follow this model.*

**Rules for Condolence Letters (吊书规则):**

- If the letter is **not written after the Winter Solstice**, or if both parents are alive, the phrase *"伏惟增怀"* is **omitted**, and *"犹寒"* is placed at the beginning instead.

**Long-Absent Correspondence:**
*"Having been separated for some time, my longing knows no measure. Your teachings of [date] have deeply comforted me. Though I have not received recent instruction, I remain in constant dread of the cold. May I humbly inquire after your well-being and daily routines? I trust your health surpasses the ordinary.

**Illness Rituals (疾病仪第三)**

*"According to the Daoist Master’s teachings:*
*When a Daoist’s illness grows grave and they near their end, they must first bathe in fragrant water, don their robes as usual, and recite the scriptures they have received. They should hang their amulets at the room’s entrance, prepare offerings, and invite virtuous masters to fast, recite scriptures, and confess all sins committed since birth—none hidden, all revealed—to extinguish guilt and pray for blessings."*

*"Master Zhang Xu says:*
*One may recite the *Sutra for Delivering Beings* one or two hundred times.*

*The Daoist Master says:*
*If one must be interred, they should entrust their scriptures and teachings in written form—composing farewell letters and itemized records, clearly noting names and ranks—before reporting to the Celestial Worthy, concealing nothing.*

*The *Mid-Autumn Jade Register* states:*
*When a master is in sorrow, disciples must all bear grief in their hearts, showing no joy in their comings and goings.*

*The *Jade Register* further says:*
*When a master falls ill, disciples must attend closely at their side, watching their breath as if they were parents.*

*The *Jade Register* again states:*
*When a master faces calamity, disciples must gather all fellow students to establish a fast and pray, thus earning meritorious deeds.*

*The *Thousand True Precepts* decree:*
*Those who have left the secular world differ from the common folk, yet even in death, there are no fixed rites—though some ceremonial observances must be followed.
*During illness, recite scriptures with burning incense, day and night without pause.
*At the hour of death, strike the *Wuchang* (the bell of impermanence).
*For the funeral rites, follow the *Five Refined Corpses* method for preparing the deceased.

*When illness strikes, summon the inner assembly to inquire after the sick, inspect the kitchen staff, and have them serve food to the patient.
*In times of sickness, few recover—when one’s fortune and virtue are exhausted, they may seek to flee east or west in desperation. This is but the panic of one whose prior deeds offer no guarantee, now struck with fear and hastening death. Instead, one should cleanse and air the chambers, allowing virtuous masters to come and go, urging the sick to reflect on impermanence—nothing endures. A death record must be written, for life’s measure is short. The dying should be moved to the *Hall of Transformation*.

*This hall should be built in the northwest corner of the observatory, a three-room structure with five beams, facing west-northwest. Within, a high seat shall bear a statue of *Sheng Hu* (the Ascended One), seated on a lotus as large as a person, left hand raised to point at the Celestial Gate, flanked by two True Officers. When the patient fears their end is near, they shall be moved into the hall and placed behind the statue. A yellow brocade banner, twenty-four feet long, shall be hung, its center tied to the left True Officer’s waist, its head grasped by the patient’s hand. The dying must focus their mind and sincere intent, vowing to follow the Two True Ones through the Celestial Gate to the Golden Threshold, and if their time has not yet come, to establish a field of merit.

*Male officials face the left True One; females face the right.
*Once inside this hall, few return unshaken.
*At the moment of death, they may claim they are not yet at their end—only clinging to life through such schemes. A true sage does not dwell on departure or stay.

*The Precepts decree:*
*When male or female officials grow old and sick, nearing death, all household affairs and possessions must be entrusted to trusted disciples. If the master leaves a will, its instructions must be followed. If no will exists, a detailed record of their worldly goods shall be made and shared with disciples who know them, to be used for meritorious deeds or funeral expenses. If no disciples remain, the observatory’s assembly shall decide. If no assembly exists, the Daoist community shall decide—no funds may be given to secular kin. If parents or a master are named in the will, their commands must be obeyed. If no will exists and someone takes what they wish, they commit a *Five Grievous Offenses*; if a disciple cannot restrain them, the matter must be reported to the authorities.*

**Rites for the First Wrapping (小殓仪第四)**
*At the time of death, if the deceased has not been bathed, they need not be placed on a funeral bed. Instead, lay two layers of mats on the ground, south-facing, unchanged. The deceased should wear their usual hand-clasped robes, headwear, and socks. When moving in or out, the *fu* and *lu* talismans shall hang from the left elbow, the bell and seal from the right. Then, lay the lower blanket and cover them with the upper one.

*Pause, then set an offering of white congee to the east of the corpse. Perform the shoulder sacrifice, then lay two side offerings on the ground—male mourners to the left, female to the right. Unlike common practice, do not place a pearl in the mouth to call the soul.

*The offering prayer reads:*
*'To the Imperial Sage of the Wood Cycle, on the first day of the [month], the disciple [Name] respectfully offers pure libations and vegetarian offerings in sacrifice to the master’s spirit.'*

*After this, weep fully in grief.
*This completes the first wrapping."*

**The Great Burial Rite (Fifth Section: Entering the Coffin)**

When the time for the great burial arrives, no incense-waving or bathing is required. The deceased shall be dressed in robes and headgear as worn during fasting, with sash and belt.

First, place a red lacquered coffin within the outer coffin, along with quicklime, *zǐ* wood, seven-star boards, a *shēng* vessel, a *dān* container, and a rooster-shaped pillow. Four bearers shall carry the shrouded body into the inner coffin, placing the ritual tally (*chuáncè*) on the left, the mirror on the right, and both near the head.

Traditionally, the deceased’s personal scriptures and talismans were placed inside the *lìzǐ* (stomach pouch). Now, these are placed outside the coffin, with the head’s talismans arranged separately—this is also acceptable.

The great burial offering shall then be prepared according to the prescribed rites. Use the deceased’s favorite foods from life: spread a mat to the corpse’s west, placing the offerings of fruit and vegetables upon it.

The prayer reads as follows:
*"To the Celestial Officials of the Five Directions, the Three Heavens, and the Martial Generals of the Five Paths, the aged villagers of the *Gāolǐ*, the Subprefect of the Earthly Regions, the Marshal of *Wǔyí*, the True Officials of the Domain, the River God of the Water Palace, the Overseer of the Soul Gate, the Keeper of the Tomb Gate, the Marshals of Mountains, Rivers, and Marshes, and the Directing Envoys of the Auspicious Talismans—
Today, the Three-Cavern Disciple [Name], born in [State]-[County]-[Village]-[Neighborhood], aged [X], having departed at the [hour] of the [day] of the [month], now returns to [Village]-[Mountain] to establish a brick tomb. In life, this person renounced the secular world to follow the Dao, seeking transcendence. They studied and received the Upper Clarity Three-Cavern Great Scriptures, talismans, diagrams, and edicts, embracing the Return to the Great Yin.

Their winter and summer garments, adorned and used in life—totaling [X] items—along with the cypress coffin and burial rites, are now completed. The talismans have been delivered, and the form is now at rest. The scriptures and treasures are secured, the headgear and belt arranged, and the officials ordered to escort without delay. Let no obstruction arise—neither the *Bǐlú* ghosts of the left and right nor the ghosts of other surnames in the four directions may falsely claim names or seize possessions. All must obey the celestial edicts, as decreed in the *Tàixuān Dūguǐ Fa* and the *Nǚqīng Zhào Shū* statutes. Adjustments may be made as circumstances require."*

The Daoist Sage remarks:
*"For those who can prearrange their scriptures in sacred mountains or pure retreats, that is the highest path. There is no need to bury them with the corpse. Even now, many disciples receive teachings yet fail to fully possess the scriptures, nor can they distinguish their own transmitted texts. Why then must they be buried with the corpse? Why prearrange burial in sacred mountains? The scriptures endure across generations, passed down through talismans and diagrams. When the time comes, they may be retrieved from the tomb as needed. Any personal items inside the corpse need not be bound like the vulgar—no grain pouches, waist cords, or final possessions are required.*

Upon completion, the upper lid is placed according to the prescribed method atop the coffin. Next, the items to be buried are arranged at the coffin’s southern end for veneration.

The officiating Daoists, all in ritual attire, stand at the coffin’s southern end. One chants the Three Treasures’ rites, bowing three times to conclude.

**Completion of the Fifteenth Volume of the Essential Rites and Precepts**
**Completion of the Sixteenth Volume of the Essential Rites and Precepts**
**The Red Precepts of the Three-Cavern Daoists**
**Recitation of the Three Contracts**
**Ritual of Penitence and Offerings"**

The assembly prostrates and hears the Most Venerable High True One, whose boundless compassion pervades the Six Paths, whose profound wisdom dwells in silent darkness, and whose pity extends to the Fourfold Birth. Behold this one, whose emotions are drowned in the river of love, whose spirit is submerged in the ocean of suffering! Though their life and death are determined by the roots of virtue and vice, and their karmic bonds remain unsevered, they face endless cycles of birth and death, their fate sealed.

Even if the flame of wisdom burns eternally, its light cannot illuminate their path; though the sacred vessel sails ceaselessly, they have yet to cross to the other shore. Thus, this body is not truly theirs—today, the departed Certain One (某甲) has encountered the Dao and heard the Dharma, received admonitions to cultivate scriptures, and refined their heart with the phoenix’s seal and their spirit with the dragon’s script. Their emotions have transcended the Ten Stages of Transformation, their wisdom penetrated the Nine Abysses, knowing that the Two Worlds are empty and the Four Great Elements are mere illusions. Since their destiny as a transcendent is not yet fulfilled, they must undergo further transformation. Fearful of lingering karmic burdens in life and death, lest they incur retribution for past transgressions, they rely on the Field of Merit and await the power of virtue.

At this moment, the assembly acts on behalf of Certain One’s family, the Five Degrees of the departed, and the Three Teachers of the spirit’s path. With reverent hearts, they prostrate and recite the rites, honoring the Supreme Way of the Limitless Dao and the Ten-Directional Manifested Sage. They pray for divine power to rescue and deliver the departed, to liberate the destitute spirits, to absolve their sins, and grant them all passage to the Pure Land, recognition in the Celestial Palace, and the title *Yùjīng* (玉京). May they attain the Golden Gate of fruition, merge with the Supreme True Dao, and be free to wander at will.

Indeed, the Saints manifest in countless forms to guide beings; the True Transcendents appear in times of need to leave their traces. Sometimes they take physical likenesses, or leave behind teachings and doctrines, leading ordinary mortals away from suffering and its retribution. Yet, though they endure birth and death, their weary minds and spirits remain entangled. How could they know their past karmic causes or foresee their future destinies? Drifting like lost souls, they cycle endlessly through rebirth, as if the compassion of the Saints could not save them, and they are forever bound to the Field of Punishment.

Today, Certain One, though once blessed with rare talents, studied under a teacher, followed the Dao, and practiced the Dharma, has accumulated virtues and deeds. Yet their karmic debts remain unpaid, and their lingering spirits must be assisted by merit. The assembly, in unison, resolves to cultivate the Great Vehicle heart and perform the deeds of the highest noble ones. For all beings in the Ten Directions—emperors, kings, officials, commoners, those who follow the Dharma, artisans, and scholars of the world—they offer sincere devotion, prostrating to express gratitude for the Thirty-Six Volumes of Marvelous Scriptures, the Golden Tablets and Jade Characters, the Dragon Script and Phoenix Colors, the Nine-Grade True Mantras, and the Five-Directional Orthodox Teachings. They earnestly seek the Mysterious Power to broadly deliver both public and private beings, that all may attain the True Transcendents, be enlightened, and possess the Four Penetrations and Six Perfections. May they expound the Three Vehicles, liberate the Five Paths, and all find freedom in the Dao’s realm.

This world’s lives are fleeting, as the Five Constants are mere illusions and the Four Great Elements are hollow. Like flowing water that never stops or fleeting stone-fire, white steeds cannot be detained, and dark shadows pass swiftly. A thousand years are but the blink of an eye; a hundred years are but a fleeting dream. Even if one enjoys longevity like Páng’ān (彭安), they must still perish in the end. Without ascending the dragon’s path, who can escape? If the Great Destiny is to be fulfilled, who can resist its force?

Now, Certain One has abandoned their body, yet their karmic ties persist. Their earthly affairs remain unresolved, and their radiant visage still lingers in this world. Who will meet them in the afterlife? How can their kin grieve, or travelers mourn, when they depart forever, leaving only a watery farewell? The assembly, therefore, universally extends compassion, reaching all beings in the Ten Directions—sentient beings with consciousness, celestial deities and earthly spirits, wronged kin, and equals alike—as well as those suffering in the mortal realm and tormented souls in hell. All beings, whether born from egg, womb, or transformation, prostrate and submit to the Venerable Daoist Master of the Mysterious Middle and the Sage Assembly of the Way. They pray that with the Six Perfections’ wisdom, the Five-Colored Lights may shine, delivering both visible and invisible beings to eternal bliss. May all evil karmic bonds dissolve, and virtuous deeds flourish, that those who recognize the Fourfold Birth may return to the Three Treasures.

The Threefold Rites conclude, and thus the Three Contracts begin.

The past life has faith, yet human life must perish; the great sage rejoices in the precepts of scripture. The above aligns with the intent of the Two *Mèng* (孟) rites.

The Three Contracts conclude, and thereafter, the *Yíwén* (移文) is read—lest it be recited redundantly as in vulgar customs. When the Three Contracts are finished, one reads the *Yíwén*, without need for the customary repetitions of the vulgar.

The rites conclude, and the *Yíwén* is placed within the previous *Lì* (鬲) vessel. Both inner and outer attendants depart with their bows, and the coffin is sealed—yet the nails must not be driven in immediately. A memorial chapter is then inscribed.

Upon completion of the chapter, the nails are driven, the mourners weep, and the hair is scattered in grief. The *Brǎngwài* (吊慰) rites are performed.

**Memorial Chapter Format:**
The memorial chapter is inscribed as follows: *"The undersigned, a male disciple of the Three-Cavern Daoists from Certain Prefecture, County, and Village, and a member of the Supreme Unity Daoist Order, humbly declares: In accordance with the written records, this male disciple, Certain One, was born into the Dao and received the Orthodox Teachings. Though their seals and talismans were prepared, they could not dwell in seclusion to study and recite, nor embrace unity with a tranquil spirit. Instead, they mingled with the world, stained by dust and defiled by karma, their sins accumulating until their life’s merit was exhausted. At this moment, on the Certain Month, Day, and Hour, they depart from this life, bidding farewell to earth and heaven, and pass into the realm of the soil officials.

Since Certain One possessed scriptures, talismans, ritual implements, robes, and bedding in life, today at this hour, their mortal form is interred, their tomb sealed. Fearful that their lingering spirit may offend the departed, or become a malevolent ghost, a mountain demon, or a false spirit, obstructing the dead and preventing their passage, I humbly present these scriptures, burial goods, and talismans as recorded. I now prostrate and offer this memorial chapter, one copy, to the officials overseeing the burial, the attendants, and the supervising officers. May they witness the proper interment and burial of the corpse, ensuring eternal peace for the departed and tranquility for the tomb’s guardians. May the spirit’s rebirth follow their karmic deeds, and after completion of all rites, the assembled officials return to the Celestial Bureau, where they shall receive their rewards and promotions in accordance with the prescribed ranks. Let none be left in despair."*

「For those bearing resentment or grudges, their lingering spirit may offend the living and the dead alike, and thus I earnestly beg for their pardon and forgiveness, as the Way of the Most High distinguishes.  This is the memorial chapter for overseeing the burial, which must be presented by Daoist priests who have received the *破殓箓* (Pòliàn Luó—burial and exorcism talismans) to the Celestial Bureau.

Since this contains sacred scriptures and rites, it must not be shown to outsiders, and should be burned within one or two days.  If the deceased was not a great sage or renowned figure, there will inevitably be no descendants to perform the three *三礼* (Sān Lǐ—three ritual observances: mourning, sacrifice, and memorial) or the three *三契* (Sān Qì—three solemn oaths: to uphold filial piety, to maintain ancestral rites, and to honor the deceased).  These rites are not easily accomplished by all.  This memorial chapter must be clearly understood; any deviation from proper procedure leaves one powerless and without recourse.  I therefore compose it in accordance with the prescribed *三归* (Sān Guī—Three Refuges), briefly setting forth the essential points.

Once the deceased has been placed in the coffin, first follow the *移书* (Yíshū—burial transfer document) as written by Master Meng, then spread a mat at the coffin’s head and light incense, striking the small *磬子* (qìngzi—stone chime) three times.

After the coffin has been sealed, kneel at length and recount the circumstances of the deceased’s life.  I hear that the Dao is fundamentally without birth, yet born it must die—like lightning in the clouds or waves upon the sea, fleeting and not bound by human expectation, its depths unknown to mortal understanding.  In their brief time together, the living leaned upon the deceased as kin, but now each moment passes, leaving none as steadfast guardians.  All depart, leaving the living in sorrow.

Today, the deceased—my fateful companion—was granted birth in this holy age, heard the scriptures, and beheld the Dao.  With sincere devotion, I cultivated the True Way, bowing daily to its *龙章* (Long Zhāng—Dragon Script) and morning and evening to its *凤篆* (Fèng Zhuàn—Phoenix Seal), hoping to ascend like the crane and dwell eternally among the clouds.  Who could have foreseen that the *孔水* (Kǒng Shuǐ—Great Water) would shorten their years, and the *庄山* (Zhuāng Shān—Mourning Mountain) would hasten their end?  In an instant, they abandoned this life, and now forever stray from the path of rebirth.

In grief, I rise and fall without direction, weeping before their garments and coffin.  Once the burial attire is properly arranged, I entrust them to the coffin with the *良时* (Liáng Shí—auspicious hour).

I now list all the required burial documents in strict accordance with the *丧礼* (Sàng Lǐ—funeral rites).  The *移文* (Yíwén—burial transfer document) is read.  After reading the *移文*, the Three Refuges are intoned.

For the deceased, I take refuge in the Tenfold Great Dao, praying that their divine presence may descend, uprooting the sevenfold karmic roots of suffering and freeing them from the bonds of the Three Realms.  May they wander in wondrous fields, recognizing the celestial officials, and prostrate themselves before the peerless, boundless Dao.  I take refuge in the Thirty-Six Sacred Scriptures, praying that the luminous texts may nourish their spirit and refine their nature, that the Dragon Script and Phoenix Seal may illuminate their inner chambers, and that they may forever depart from the Northern Darkness and dwell in the Southern Extremity.  I prostrate myself before the宗玄自然法宝 (Zōng Xuán Zìrán Fǎbǎo—Supreme Mysterious Natural Dharma Treasure).

I take refuge in the later sages and all accomplished Daoist masters, that their sevenfold enlightenment may radiate brightly and their sixfold transcendent wisdom illuminate all.  May they universally save both the hidden and the manifest, guiding all through life and death.  I prostrate myself before the Tenfold Boundless Saints.

When the rites are complete, place the *移文* at the coffin’s head, and leave the rest to the master of the household to secure the coffin with nails and cover it with the two *孟* (Mèng—burial mats).  If, on the day of burial, I arrive late, the coffin must be moved to the hall, where a white cloth curtain is set before it.

After three days of mourning, once the burial garments are complete, arrange the spirit tablet (*灵*—Líng) to the south of the coffin, facing east, with a screen, couch, and burial attire all prepared as in life.  Offer meals at dawn and midday.

Before the burial garments are complete, the filial children must, at the spirit tablet’s southern end, gather the deceased’s hair with a cloth, then place the tablet facing north, with east as the superior direction.  Day and night, they must weep, and upon completion of the burial garments and removal of the tablet, bow and prostrate themselves again.  After bowing, proceed to the coffin and weep.  Having exhausted their grief, return to the tablet’s southern end to lean and weep; if their sorrow is light, face west at the tablet and lean to weep.  With north as the superior direction, perform the rites of condolence and consolation.

If these rites are followed strictly, they will be difficult to comprehend.  Not only will the filial children be confused by the northward and westward directions, but those offering condolences will also harbor doubts.

Now, I adjust these rites: before the burial garments are complete, gather the hair with the cloth and place the tablet to the north of the coffin, setting a white cloth curtain before it, with men to the left and women to the right.  After three days, once the burial garments are complete, arrange the spirit tablet to the south of the coffin, with a screen and couch.  This way, not only will those offering condolences see it, but the filial children on either side will also find it appropriate.

The rites of Master Zhang are similar to these.  This concludes the sixth chapter on completing the burial garments.»

Upon receiving the Daoist precepts, one must complete the *jue* (箓). For the Three Five (三五) and Yuanming (元命) initiations, there are eight *quan* (券) and ten *jue* (箓). The eight *quan* are: the *Dingzhi Quan* (定志券), *Shengxuan Quan* (升玄券), *Maizi Quan* (卖子券), *Qieri Quan* (乞儿券), and the four *Shangqing Quan* (上清四券): *Xueye Quan* (血液券), *Shenxian Quan* (神仙券), *Dadu Quan* (大度券), and *Tongling Quan* (通灵券). The ten *jue* include: *Chuman Jue* (除满箓), *Sanwu Jue* (三五箓), *Yuanming Jue* (元命箓), as well as *Zhanxie Jue* (斩邪箓), *Pozhong Bai Gui Zhao Jue* (破殗百鬼召箓), *Duzhang Bi Yin Jue* (都章毕印箓), *Jiuzhou She Ling Jue* (九州社令箓), *Tai Xuan Si Bu Xian* (太玄四部线), *Hetu Jue* (河图箓), *Qingjia Jue* (青甲箓), *Dongye Da Jin Jue* (东野大禁箓), and *Shi Jiangjun Jue* (十将军箓).

If following the rites of the Small Meng (小孟), the above are observed. For the Great Meng (大孟), there are neither the eight *quan* nor the ten *jue*—only the ten *jue* as per Master Shiji (石井公), without the eight *quan*. Following the Small Meng, the mourning garments are the same as those of the Three Months (丝麻三月服), with men and women using fifteen *sheng* (升) of cloth for their robes and headgear. However, the Great Meng and Master Shiji both state: "The teaching of *Famen* (发蒙) is deeply gracious and heavy with favor. The rites of mourning and receiving condolences are established without the completion of mourning garments." Today, I adhere to the *Yijing* (《易》), which says: "A child comes seeking me; it is not I who seek the child. If I do not teach the child, it will eventually face ruin." The *Shengxuan Jing* (《升玄经》) states: "Both the former teacher and the latter teacher must be respected. How can they be neglected? This is because they share the same precepts yet are suddenly severed." Following the Small Meng, three months are deemed sufficient for this respect.

The *Wuqian Wen* (五千文), *Dajie Bai Bashi Lu* (大诫百八十律), *Zhenwei* (真诰), *Wuyue* (五岳), *Liujia* (六甲), and *Jinshan* (禁山) rites are uniformly prescribed by both Small and Great Meng. For the Small Funeral (小功), five months of mourning are required. Men and women use eleven *sheng* of cloth for their lower garments and twelve *sheng* for their headgear. Today, people merely wear headbands instead of headgear, simply to save effort.

According to Confucian rites, mourning garments transform into auspicious ones. Auspicious headgear is worn on the head, the *gu* (着) upper garment is worn on the body, and the lower garment is worn beneath. If following the Small and Great Meng, twelve *sheng* of cloth are used for the headgear, while eleven *sheng* are used for the *he* (褐) or *qun* (裙). However, Master Shiji states: "These mourning garments are the same for the Small Funeral, five months in duration, with men wearing silk headbands and women wearing linen lower garments. If people now wear headbands, why not use silk?" Those who claim to follow the Daoist teachings yet wear coarse garments of cloth, and upon their teacher's death, don linen lower garments, not only violate the principles of the Way but also defy common human sentiment. If it is indeed the Small Funeral, five months of mourning, why then adopt silk as a garment? The *Sangfu Yi* (《丧服仪》) states: "The *Zimá* (缌麻) garments are woven with fine threads like silk, but are actually made of hemp, hence the term *Zimá* (腮麻); the Small Funeral garments use small threads, but with greater effort, hence the term *Small Funeral* (小功); the Great Funeral garments use large threads, with lesser effort, hence the term *Great Funeral* (大功)." Though Master Shiji has this stipulation, I do not adopt it.

I request adherence to the Small and Great Meng rites: before burial, wear cloth headgear and cloth upper garments; after burial, wear cloth headbands and cloth blankets. The *Shenbao Da Meng* (灵宝大盟), *Zhenjing San Pin* (真经三品), and other scriptures such as *Ziran* (自然), *Zhongmei* (中盟), *Sanhuang* (三皇), *Wufu* (五符), *Qichuan* (七传), and *Baoshén* (宝神) are uniformly prescribed. The *Zhenjing* (真经) refers to the *Shangqing Shoudao Jing* (上情大洞真经), which contains two sets of precepts, totaling thirty-five volumes. The three *jue* are: 1) *Basu Quci Jue* (八素曲辞箓), 2) *Shanghuang Yuzhu Jue* (上皇玉箓), and 3) the *Sanjian Zhengfa Jue* (三天正法箓); the three *ben* (奔) are: Sun *ben* (日奔), Moon *ben* (月奔), and Star *ben* (星奔), which are also called the three *jing* (景). Upon receiving the Three Five precepts, one ascends to the *Shangyuqing Jing* (上玉清景), *Shangqing Jing* (上清景), and *Taiping Jing* (太清景). Today, upon receiving the three *ben*, one may be called a disciple of the three *jing*. These rites are uniformly prescribed by both Small and Great Meng.

For the mourning period of *Qisui* (齐衰), men and women use four *sheng* of cloth for their robes and seven *sheng* for their headgear, with a three-year period of inner mourning, abstaining from music and joyous gatherings. If one has previously received the *Wuqian Wen* (五千文), *Ziran Da Meng* (自然大盟), and other scriptural precepts, and all were received from the same teacher, then they should all observe the *Zhanxui* (斩衰) mourning for three years, adhering to the most solemn rites. In eating, drinking, speaking, listening, resting, and dwelling, they should all follow the original rites of filial children, completing the mourning period within two years, then donning auspicious garments without any remaining mourning rites.

Today, those who receive the *Da Meng* (大盟) precepts often merely let their hair down for one period. Those who receive the *Shangqing* (上清) precepts either disregard the mourning rites entirely or observe only three days of mourning, or claim nine months of mourning. Not only do they fail to recognize the three *pin* (品) and three *ben* (奔) and three *jue* (箓), but they also do not know which scriptures the three *pin* refer to. They merely follow the *Qichuan* (七传), which is a branch of the *Shangqing* teachings, and thus observe nine months of mourning. Yet, they do not even see the scriptures, let alone comprehend them thoroughly. Their teachers, seeking wide renown, teach lightly, while the disciples, valuing purple robes, compete to receive precepts.

Master Tao (陶先生) said: "Ancient people valued the skin of the scriptures; I command them to value the ears' learning." Truly, these words are profound. How can one who receives the *Shangqing* precepts, yet fails to recognize the scriptures upon seeing them, and not knowing the rites, dare to slight their teacher?

The *Shangqing* and *Damen* are both true scriptures, both retaining heavy mourning rites. Let each reflect carefully upon the two *Meng* (孟) for long deliberation.

**Preceptors and Scribes**
The two *Meng* state: When two persons discuss mourning rites, the *jing* preceptor (经师) performs minor rites, while the scribe (籍师) performs major rites—this also depends on the weight of the teacher.
To determine the weight of the teacher:
- Serving as a teacher for three years equals one period as a scribe.
- Serving as a teacher for one period equals major rites as a scribe.
- Serving as a teacher for major rites equals one period as a *jing* preceptor.
- Serving as a teacher for minor rites equals major rites as a *jing* preceptor.
- Serving as a teacher for three days equals minor rites as a *jing* preceptor.
- Serving as a teacher for three months equals no rites as a *jing* preceptor.
If a teacher serves as a scribe, all such disciples are treated lightly, and the teacher is also treated lightly—each case is reduced accordingly.

**Shared Mourning Rites**
The above rites follow the two *Meng*, with three months of mourning for *zaimá* (齐衰) rites.

**Teacher as Disciple**
The two *Meng* state: If a teacher becomes a disciple, the example is one rank lower—three years of service equals one period of mourning.
For *zaimá* (齐衰), nine months; for major rites (*dàgōng*, 大功), five months; for minor rites (*xiǎogōng*, 小功), three months.
Master Shíjǐng (石井公) said: "Mourning rites for repaying a teacher are the same as for a disciple, except that the hair is not shaved."

As for common rites, which emphasize humility toward superiors, the two *Meng* are correct. If a teacher is elderly and cannot endure mourning, heart-mourning alone suffices.
The two *Meng* state: "Within our sect, disciples mourn their teachers according to scriptural teachings, for the teacher has liberated them from birth-and-death, and their debt exceeds that to parents. Thus, their mourning differs from common rites. Since there is no suffering, it does not violate the scriptures. All other mourning rites follow the law’s weight and are established as institutions."
Master Shíjǐng said: "The nourishment of repaying mourning rites—whether for minor or major rites—requires shaving the hair, regardless of whether one has received the precepts. If one is already in mourning, they should shave their hair at the appropriate time."

**Seventh Rite: Funeral Procession**
If the deceased is a great sage or renowned person, follow the *Zhènjīng* (镇经) and *Wǔliàn Shēngshī Jīng* (五练生尸经), pre-writing five *shí* (石) of offerings, and proceed according to the scriptures—this is not detailed here.

On the burial day, perform the funeral rites with the *Rùzhǒng Jīngbǎo* (入冢经宝), then arrange offerings. Incense, flowers, banners, musicians, and chanting are arranged in order before the procession, with the Daoist disciples following the coffin.

Next, the soul tablet is carried, with banners and flowers in front, followed by the third offering of food, then the funeral carriage.
After the procession, the most respected filial son (who is also a disciple) leads, followed by lesser disciples. If there are commoners, the most filial son is last. If traveling by boat, the most respected should be at the rear.

Ensure the order is auspicious in front and inauspicious behind, proceeding step-by-step according to the time.

**Burial and Placement Rites**
Place the coffin in the center of the grave, install the scriptures at the front of the tomb, arrange offerings according to the law, and set up the soul couch within the tomb. Place the sacrificial altar in front, with male filial sons to the left and female filial sons to the right. Follow the seven *zhèng* (正) of Dao, facing the tomb, and recite scriptures, repent, and offer incense.

Once all arrangements are complete, after the vegetarian meal is finished, the disciples recite the funeral scripture before the altar, complete the mourning, and then withdraw the scriptures into the tomb. If the distance is far, adjust accordingly.

After placing the coffin, install a stone couch at the head of the coffin, place a table on it, and store the scriptures inside. Place a child immortal (*xiān tóng*, 仙童) on the left, a jade maiden (*yù nǚ*, 玉女) on the right, and divine soldiers and horses at the tomb’s entrance. Install a square plaque, along with a small table, paper, brush, ink, handkerchief, incense, and candles. The filial sons all bow, deliver the farewell words, seal the tomb, and then perform the condolence rites before returning.

All the above are the rites established by the two *Meng*.
Common funeral customs vary with wealth and poverty, but when examining true scriptures, there is no fixed rule. Indeed.

*"Huanhún* water is placed above, *ān fǎnpò* fire below.
Anciently, the wild was used as a coffin; Zhuang Zhou took the heavens and earth as a coffin—this is not merely about ritual laws and numbers, but about what the common people see and hear.

If one values virtue and morality in life, they will naturally disregard the body in death. Adapt to circumstances, increase or decrease as needed—it is not bound by the numbers one, one, three, or four."

**Eighth Rite: Soul Couch Arrangement**
The two *Meng* state: Arrange the soul couch’s position as follows:
A five-*chǐ* couch faces south, with screens, curtains, and drapes. Clothing and belongings follow the seasonal laws.
Place an orange wood box (*chéng*, 橙) before the couch, arranging incense, handkerchiefs, seals, combs, brushes, and garments.
In the morning, place a small table and mat; in the evening, move to another couch and bed, and arrange pillows and quilts.
In the morning, roll them up again. For meals, offer betel leaves, pure water, and handkerchiefs—just as when the deceased was alive.
All seasonal items are displayed as needed.

The two *Meng* state: If a prince, king, father, uncle, or elder teacher comes to condole, the filial son should welcome them outside the door and guide them back through a separate path.
The mourner leans and weeps at the eastern head of the couch, with the north considered superior.
Next, lesser filial sons lean and weep before the couch, facing north, with the east considered superior.
The honored guest is seated in the guest position, with each seat’s east side considered superior. When the five-tone wailing arrives, the filial son kneels to receive them.
After the guest pats their hand and bows twice, they are escorted back to the welcoming point and resume weeping.
If the guest is a commoner of high status, no bowing is required.
If the guest is of moderate status, they simply go to the eastern head of the couch to weep, and after the guest finishes wailing, the filial son kneels to receive them by the hand. After the guest departs, the filial son weeps again.
If the guest is of average status, they sit in order and weep, receiving the guest’s condolences.
For low-status guests, they only bow and do not hold hands.
For moderately respectful guests, they kneel and hold hands.
For guests of equal status, they lean and hold hands.
If the guest has a familial connection within the Daoist or secular world, after condolences, they must also lean and weep before the couch before departing.
If the guest has not seen the filial son since the death and has not yet paid their respects, even if they are of equal status, they must go outside to lean and weep to receive the condolences.

**Ninth Rite: Disciples Returning to Their Original Observances**

**Second Rule on the Second Month:**
If the mourning period falls outside the proper season and disciples return to their original observatories, then place a lower couch at the northern wall, facing south, with the west side as the upper end, and sit in mourning to receive condolences.

If the guest is of high status, kneel to receive and hold hands; if of equal status, sit to receive condolences, arranging the guest’s seat at the lower western wall, placing a five-foot couch facing east with its back open. The guest then faces east and ascends the couch in order, with the northern side as the upper end. They prostrate themselves and weep five times before rising to offer condolences, and the filial son kneels to hold hands as before.

In modern practice, since no floating spirit tablet (*fúling*) is installed, the condolences are received in the empty hall. The filial son resides in the bedroom, placing a plain lower couch, removing the old screens and curtains, and encircling the couch with reeds and horsehair. The door is hung with white cloth curtains, and the mourner speaks softly without engaging in conversation.

**Twelfth Rule on Removing Mourning Attire:**
From the first seventh-day, second seventh-day, third seventh-day, up to the hundredth day and first anniversary, according to one’s merit and virtue, once these periods have passed, no further offerings are made in the morning or midday—only incense is kept burning until the second anniversary, at which point mourning attire may be removed.

If one says, *"I am satisfied and may remove mourning attire,"* know that there is a deeper meaning to not removing it. Without renown or virtue, why would one linger on the couch so long?

Master Zhang says: Install an incense burner, and let the disciples weep and wail morning and evening. Within three days, prepare a vegetarian meal, and offer it at midday, continuing until the fourth day. Then place a basin of clear water. Upon reaching the hundredth day, dismantle the couch and remove mourning attire according to the severity of the loss.

If the deceased was of notable virtue, even at the hundredth day, fear that the grief may not yet be fully expressed.

If one attains the highest virtue today, revered by all under heaven, even though the body may be laid aside like discarded sandals and the spirit ascends to the celestial gates, all will mourn and honor them, gazing upon the memorial couch with awe.

If one chooses to remain on the couch for an extended period, deviating from customary practice, then among disciples who have received the Dao to its utmost and wear the *jiancui* mourning robe—these may remain on the couch for a second year; if disciples have completed only one mourning period, they may remain on the couch for one year; if they mourn for nine months, they may remain on the couch for nine months; if they mourn for five months, they may remain on the couch for five months; if some mourn for three months, they may remain on the couch for a hundred days.

If the deceased was poor and had no descendants, even if the couch and memorial table are set up, no offerings are made, and dust and filth accumulate. Though the couch may be easily arranged, removing it will be difficult. If grief proves unbearable, one may dissolve the mourning according to the circumstances.

If the deceased was of notable virtue, yet not surpassing others, and had no descendants, the funeral rites may be conducted as is proper, and the mourning may follow customary practice—there is no need for an extended memorial couch.

If the deceased was utterly detached from worldly affairs, their reputation fading like a bubble and their form as fleeting as a dream, seeking no grand burial and requiring no memorial table, then if there are no posthumous instructions, each may mourn according to their own capacity.

Thus concludes the sixteenth chapter of the *Miaojuan* on the subtle precepts of rites, laws, and disciplines.
