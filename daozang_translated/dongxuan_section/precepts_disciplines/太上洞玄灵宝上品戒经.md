---

At that time, during the first year of the Kaihuang era, on the first day of the seventh month at noon, the Heavenly Worthy bestowed upon the Supreme Dao Lord the scripture of the *Upper-Grade Precepts of Wisdom* within the fragrant mulberry grove of the Floating Gauze Realm on Mount Yucha in the Western Jade Land. As the Dao Lord received the precepts, he prostrated himself, turning his heart toward the ten directions and contemplating the Three Worthies.

Then, the hosts of celestial immortals descended from the void—dragon-drawn chariots, tiger-led carriages, phoenix-borne palanquins, and simurgh-borne litters, adorned with kingfisher plumes and feathered fans, emerald mists and radiant clouds, immortal blossoms and jeweled staves—resplendent with luminous brilliance. Cranes cried in unison, celestial music chimed, and auspicious hues filled the sky as they arrived at the ritual arena. Immortal men and jade maidens circled the altar, burning incense, pacing in void-step hymns, bowing in reverence, and gazing in awe.

The Heavenly Worthy smiled, his countenance radiating light, expounding the precepts to deliver beings. All who heard were freed from misfortune.

The Heavenly Worthy commanded the assembly of good men, good women, and celestial officials: On the first day of each month, two divine youths shall descend to the human realm to observe their good and evil deeds, recording their merits and transgressions. Those who perform good are inscribed in the celestial ledgers of virtue; those who commit evil are registered in the underworld’s rolls of iniquity. Upon the end of their lives, the virtuous receive blessings, while the wicked suffer calamity.

Thus, he exhorted all people: On the first day of the new year, don fresh garments of proper hues, gather at the ritual arena, and inscribe your names upon bamboo and silk to present to the celestial bureaus, that your year’s virtuous deeds may be known. On the first day of each month, attend the precept assemblies at the numinous temples to cultivate affinity and goodness for the month.

At the place where the precepts are expounded, men and women shall gather in harmony, inscribing their names and quieting their minds to listen. Those who hear the precepts and awaken to the Dao shall realize the patience of non-arising.

Those who enter this Dharma gate should be like jade maidens or golden perfected beings, their bodies attuned to the Dao’s *qi*, their countenances bearing immortal grace. Amidst these wondrous words, they shall uphold true faith in the teachings, vowing to hear the Heavenly Worthy’s precepts as earth deities offer treasures.

Then, a devout celestial maiden and a forbearing immortal, their star-crowned heads gleaming and moon-sashed forms luminous, held offerings and bowed in reverence. They proclaimed the Ten Supreme Vows before the assembly:

1. **First Vow:** To offer one’s flesh to feed hungry birds and beasts.
2. **Second Vow:** To anoint one’s body with eight measures of fragrant oil to fuel lamps and perpetuate light.
3. **Third Vow:** To repay kindness with labor, aiding those burdened by toil.
4. **Fourth Vow:** Upon encountering the destitute and naked, to bestow food and clothing.
5. **Fifth Vow:** Upon meeting the sick, to provide medicine and broth.
6. **Sixth Vow:** To fulfill the needs of others in their time of want.
7. **Seventh Vow:** To bring joy to those in sorrow, easing their suffering.
8. **Eighth Vow:** To willingly take the place of those condemned to execution or imprisonment.
9. **Ninth Vow:** To hasten the safe delivery of pregnant women.
10. **Tenth Vow:** To ensure the swift return of soldiers from frontier campaigns.

Having uttered these ten vows, they wept tears of sorrow and addressed the Heavenly Worthy: “Disciples’ karmic obstructions run deep. We beseech the wondrous precepts.”

The Venerable Master, grieving and disconsolate, shed tears as he spoke: “Men and women bear heavy karmic burdens. The sublime Dharma is the great causal condition for liberation. Though I wish to open the gate of universal deliverance, the roots of sentient beings are shallow—what can be done? Alas! To waste a lifetime, sinking into the six paths of rebirth is truly lamentable. For your sake, I expound these precepts. Awaken, turn your hearts, and take refuge in the true Dao. Those with transgressions must repent; those without may listen in silence.”

The Heavenly Worthy addressed the Supreme Dao Lord: “Now I shall exhort and admonish, awakening the multitudes. For all men and women, I dispel calamities, avert suffering, invoke blessings, deliver lives, and uproot the roots of affliction. The living shall perceive the Dao and escape the eight difficulties; the dead shall attain bliss, avoiding the three wretched destinies. Reborn in the human or celestial realms, they shall enjoy supreme nobility. Those who cultivate fasts and seek the Dao may become Wheel-Turning Sage Kings. All must single-mindedly receive and uphold the Ten Exhortations, heeding them without forgetfulness, contemplating them in their hearts, avoiding distractions, and listening in silence.”

1. **First Exhortation:** Revere the Three Treasures, make offerings to Dharma masters, expound scriptures, nurture life, teach goodness, serve as models for others, and cultivate worthy teachings. Such high talents shall bring honor to their gates and glory to their clans.
2. **Second Exhortation:** Copy scriptures and encourage their recitation. Through broad study and wondrous praise, one shall hear the luminous Dharma life after life, mastering its meanings and propagating its verses.
3. **Third Exhortation:** At numinous temples, cultivate blessings and establish fasts. Offer sumptuous delicacies to the worthy and sagely, repaying their nobility. Clothing and sustenance shall come naturally.
4. **Fourth Exhortation:** Offer fragrant oil to fuel lamps, illuminating all. In this life, one shall enjoy elegance, purity, intelligence, and unparalleled beauty, with a celestial bearing of lofty refinement.
5. **Fifth Exhortation:** Offer sacred robes and Dharma vestments to revered masters. In this life, one shall abide in grace and freedom, avoiding borderlands to dwell always in the Central Kingdom, with one’s family adorned in crowns and one’s sons and daughters dignified and comely.
6. **Sixth Exhortation:** Men and women, honor and nurture your parents, respect both kin and strangers, protect the weak, support the strong, love the lowly, and pacify the exalted. In this life, you shall be repaid with worthy nephews and virtuous children.
7. **Seventh Exhortation:** Aid the sick with food, drink, medicine, and compassionate care. This is the supreme field of blessings, making one a great healer-king, receiving supreme nobility.
8. **Eighth Exhortation:** Relieve the poor by sharing your own clothing and food, ensuring their warmth and sustenance, prolonging their lives. In this life, your gates shall flourish, and your household shall abound in wealth.
9. **Ninth Exhortation:** Toward others, harbor no jealousy or envy. Maintain constant mindfulness, avoid creating enemies, and relinquish malice. You shall encounter only joy.
10. **Tenth Exhortation:** Commission and venerate images of the Heavenly Worthy and sages. Whether averting calamity, facing death, or encountering suffering and disaster, all shall be rescued and protected.

The Heavenly Worthy declared: These Ten Exhortations and Essential Precepts must be believed and practiced. The karmic conditions of good and evil shall invariably yield their retribution. Those who, dwelling in worldly wealth and nobility, mock the poor and lowly shall receive poverty and lowliness in return. Those who, possessing beauty in this life, ridicule the ugly shall receive ugliness in return. Those who, endowed with intelligence, refuse to teach others shall receive stupidity and delusion in return. Those who, enjoying robust health, mock the sick and afflicted shall receive lingering illness and suffering in return. Those who, disbelieving in the Daoist teachings, ridicule the scriptures shall receive obstinacy and arrogance in return. Those who usurp another’s spouse shall receive widowhood in return. Those who seduce another’s wife shall receive solitary widowhood in return. Those who pledge themselves as husband and wife shall not be reborn together in the human realm. Those who delight in taking lives shall receive premature death and short lifespan in return.

Thus, I exhort all people: good deeds bring good retribution, evil deeds bring evil misfortune. These consequences are inexorable, and none can escape or be delivered from them. Each person possesses a single mind containing the six consciousnesses. Whether one performs good or evil, encountering circumstances and conditions, one who attains wisdom and restrains the passions, keeping the true gate unmoved, shall realize the Dao of immortality.

Furthermore, the Six Sensory Precepts are expounded. Those of middling capacity should awaken to them:

1. The eye must not wander broadly, distracted by variegated colors, lest the pupils be lost and vision impaired. By mastering the eye’s radiance, the immortal shall appear in the world.
2. The ear must not listen indiscriminately, confused by the five tones, lest the spirit be harmed and rightness corrupted. By restraining the ear from wailing and lamentation, and mastering music, the immortal shall appear in the world.
3. The nose must not indulge in excessive fragrances, nor be assailed by杂气, foul odors, or noxious vapors, lest the spirit be disturbed and the mind agitated. By mastering the nose’s perception of fragrance, the immortal shall appear in the world.
4. The mouth must not crave rich flavors, fatty meats, or杂类, lest the six bowels be violated and the five viscera—spleen and lungs—harmed. By mastering the tongue’s delight in the Dharma, the immortal shall appear in the world.
5. Desire must not sway the emotions, nor the body seek contact, lest essence and qi be disturbed. By guarding the mind and preserving oneself, and mastering the solitary root, wisdom shall be established, and the immortal shall appear in the world.
6. The heart must not be disturbed or confused, nor the mind cling to conditions. By abiding in the inherent emptiness and stillness of the original nature, and firmly maintaining it, one masters the Dharma gate amid all conditions, and the immortal shall appear in the world.

The Heavenly Worthy said: These six roots are the great afflictions of the body. Though one may be reborn as a man or woman, if the six senses are impure, the scriptures unseen, and the Dharma-sound unheard, one remains unaware, sinking into the gate of transgression. The lifespan is brief, not fulfilling heaven’s mandate, and one lingers long in evil destinies—how pitiable! Therefore, these precepts are expounded to deliver humans and devas. With a sincere and reverent mind, take refuge in the Mysterious Cavern. With emotions serene and spirit tranquil, one’s lifespan shall be prolonged.

The Perfected of the Great Ultimate received the Six Precepts, attained the six penetrations, and rejoiced exuberantly, singing hymns of praise.

The Heavenly Worthy declared: All good men and women here present, upon hearing this praise and upholding the precepts without lapse, shall realize the true Dao. If one recites and praises these precepts, after the end of life, one shall not be bound by evil karma and shall have one’s transgressions extinguished.

Furthermore, it is said: When illness arises in a person, it is due to improper self-care, delusive thoughts forming calamities, and clinging to conditions creating sickness. Many fail to awaken. Among the myriad illnesses of delusion, ten are briefly listed. To hear the root of illness, listen with a tranquil mind:

1. Bewitching poisons that kill are one illness.
2. Harboring hatred and wishing others dead is a second illness.
3. Lust that corrupts virtue is a third illness.
4. Dwelling on past grievances is a fourth illness.
5. Refusing admonition is a fifth illness.
6. Stubbornness and self-will are a sixth illness.
7. Teaching others to harm is a seventh illness.
8. Forcibly seizing others’ property is an eighth illness.
9. Indulging in self-pity and complaint is a ninth illness.
10. Using power and coercion is a tenth illness.

For these ten illnesses, if one wishes to be cured, one must apply the proper remedies, and with faith in the prescription, recovery is certain. A weak constitution and gentle nature are wondrous medicines. Acting with magnanimity and a harmonious heart are wondrous medicines. Drawing near to virtue and distancing oneself from lust are wondrous medicines. Not taking illicit wealth is a wondrous medicine. Rescuing from calamity and aiding the distressed are wondrous medicines. Supporting the elderly and weak are wondrous medicines. Enduring humiliation without resentment is a wondrous medicine. Restraining anger is a wondrous medicine. Avoiding suspicion and estrangement is a wondrous medicine. A tranquil mind and settled intent are wondrous medicines.

These wondrous medicines correspond to the illnesses. If one does not apply them with sincerity, one shall suddenly face death when the time of karmic retribution arrives. I leave these words for the world:

The Great Sage of Equanimous Mind
Expounds these true immortal precepts,
Desiring all beings
To assemble in the Hall of Myriad Blessings.
Those with blessings, aspiring to be heavenly immortals,
Recite the Numinous Treasure Precepts.
On the first and fifteenth days of the month,
Ascend the lion throne.
Compose the body and regulate the qi,
With harmonious voice recite the wondrous scripture.
Pitying the people of the lower realms,
Who do not believe in the supreme precepts,
They drift in the sea of suffering,
Far from the blissful heaven of non-arising.
Upholding this precept scripture,
One enters the rank of immortals and sages.
Listen in silence,
And in every moment, arouse the mind for the Dao.

1. When the kalpas draw to an end,
The world shall naturally fall into darkness.
2. Spreading the true Dharma,
Virtue shall align with heaven and earth.
3. Following the winds and rains,
Kindly open the gate of sweet dew.
4. Pitying the dry bones,
Divine talismans shall restore the departed soul.
5. Ancestors of former generations
Shall bless descendants with fortune.
6. Those of evil nature
Shall transform and grow good roots.
7. Reversing short lifespans,
One shall attain longevity and enduring existence.
8. Transgressions of kalpas past
Shall all be absolved by the sage’s grace.
9. The marks of liberation
Shall remove obstacles and blemishes.
10. Gradually accumulating merit,
One shall become the Supreme Honored One.

The Perfected One’s admonition says: Why not cultivate and uphold these precepts? Now is the very time. Every moment is precious; do not waste the passing light. Practice the secret and wondrous, and only those who realize it shall know.

The Exhortation in Verse says:
A person’s life is already fading,
Like a flame in a lamp of hard fat.

The four great elements are like branches and leaves,
The five aggregates resemble flowers and fruit.
In the prime of youth, one ought to study diligently—
How can one cling to self and ego?

When fortune is exhausted, the spirit scatters,
And one sits dazed in hell’s gloom.
The exalted sages fear sinking,
Seeking the Dao to escape this calamity.

All things on earth, all myriad beings,
Each relies on the other, each possesses spirit.
Yet in the end, they await the kalpa’s reckoning—
When fortune is spent, heaven and earth collapse.

Traversing the five destinies,
One comes and goes through death and rebirth.
Fools who disbelieve the Dharma
Suffer the pain of sins that ever cling.

If you wish to escape this affliction,
Take refuge in the Most High’s scriptures.
They expound the sublime precepts—
Receive them as treasures for the body.

Those who study are ever immersed in toil,
Regretting they did not cultivate sooner.
All must unravel the profound and obscure,
For in an instant, old age crushes one.

Thus in my tender youth,
I abandoned the world to urgently seek the Dao.

After the Heavenly Worthy proclaimed these precepts,
All the great assembly—
The deva-kings of all heavens, the hosts of heavenly beings,
The kings of all lands, the multitudes of their realms,
Royal consorts and maidens, empress dowagers and palace women,
The eight divisions of dragon spirits, the sages of the ten directions,
Brahmā, the Heavenly Emperor, the perfected of the three realms,
The sovereign lords of the five directions, the deities of the four quarters—
Such countless beings, too many to name,
Upon hearing the precepts expounded, all realized the true Dao.

The blind saw objects, the mute spoke,
The lame walked, the deaf heard,
Those afflicted by earth’s ills were all cured,
Hell’s torments ceased, and the ghost realm was forever left behind.

At that time, five thousand scholars—
Eloquent orators of the heavens, the finest talents of the land,
Aspiring to the highest honors—
Turned their hearts to reverence the Dao, bowing in homage and taking refuge.

The Heavenly Worthy, moved by compassion,
Instantly delivered them all,
Bestowing upon each a jade tablet,
And gifting them golden crowns,
Dharma robes and immortal garments,
Presented by the devas.

They roamed free by limpid streams,
Wandering carefree through the azure vault,
Absorbing qi and dining on mist,
Riding dragons and controlling cranes.

The great assembly rejoiced,
Singing praises to the pure and empty.
Immortals soared through the void,
Their names inscribed in the secret registers.
Guided through the clouds,
They beheld the gates of heaven.
Awakened to the Dao, they realized truth,
Dwelling in stillness, ever at peace.

Those who revere this scripture,
Believe, receive, and uphold it.

The *Highest Scripture of the Numinous Treasure’s Upper Grade Precepts* of the Cavernous Mystery concludes.
