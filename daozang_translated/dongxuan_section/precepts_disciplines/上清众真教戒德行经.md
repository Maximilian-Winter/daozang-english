**Title:** *The Scripture of Precepts, Virtues, and Conduct for the Host of Perfected Ones of the Highest Clarity*. Author unknown, likely composed during the Northern and Southern Dynasties. Possibly an adaptation from *True Sayings*, Scroll Six. Two scrolls. Base text from *The Orthodox Daoist Canon*, Cave Mystery Section, Precepts and Disciplines Category.

**Scroll One**

The Lord of Azure Youth of Square Cauldron spoke:
"To pursue the Dao is苦, and not to pursue the Dao is also 苦.
Not pursuing the Dao is 苦: from birth to old age, from old age to illness, guarding the body until death—its 苦 is boundless. The heart is vexed, sins accumulate, and even in death, they do not cease. The 苦 is beyond words, and how much worse for those who do not live out their allotted years!
Pursuing the Dao is also 苦: preserving purity, guarding the true, contemplating the numinous, seeking a master through hardship, enduring hundreds of trials, diligently applying the heart without laziness, and maintaining firm resolve—this, too, is the utmost 苦.
Only those who regard the rank of feudal lords as transient guests, gold and jade as mere pebbles, and the splendor of fine silk as tattered rags may be said to truly inquire into the Dao."

The Perfected King of Western Citadel spoke:
"It is difficult for one to escape the Three Evil Paths and attain human birth.
Having attained human birth, it is difficult to leave the female form and become male.
Having become male, it is difficult to possess all six senses and four limbs intact.
With the six senses intact, it is difficult to be born in the Central Kingdom.
Having been born in the Central Kingdom, it is difficult to encounter a ruler of the Dao and parents of virtue.
Having encountered a ruler of the Dao and been born into a family that studies the Dao, it is difficult to possess a heart of kindness and benevolence.
With a benevolent heart awakened, it is difficult to believe in the Dao, virtue, and longevity.
Having believed in the Dao, virtue, and longevity, it is difficult to encounter the era of Great Peace under the *ren-chen* cycle.
How can one not be diligent?"

The Three Evil Paths refer to being born as birds, beasts, insects, or livestock—unable to become human.
The Supreme Lord asked a seeker: "How long does a human life last?"
One replied: "A matter of days."
The Supreme Lord said: "You cannot cultivate the Dao."
Another replied: "A matter of eating and drinking."
The Supreme Lord said: "Go away. You do not yet understand the Dao."
Yet another replied: "A matter of a single breath."
The Supreme Lord said: "Excellent! This may be called understanding the Dao."
"I once heard these words and now tell them to you. If you diligently study the Dao, you may strive to master this breath. Even if you are thousands of miles away, if your heart holds fast to my precepts, you will surely attain the Dao. Those who study the jade-classics and treasure scriptures will certainly achieve immortality. But those who stand at my left side, harboring intentions of deviance, will never attain the Dao."

A person who studies the scriptures and practices the Dao is like one who eats honey: the mouth is filled with sweetness, the six viscera are delighted, and the aftertaste lingers. Those who can act thus will attain the Dao.

The Lord of Azure Youth of Square Cauldron spoke:
"In cultivating the Dao, one who can uproot the roots of love and desire is like removing a string of hanging pearls—one by one, they will eventually be exhausted. Gradually eliminating external evils, the evils will also come to an end. When they are exhausted, one attains the Dao.
It is also like an ox bearing a heavy load through the mud, exhausted and not daring to turn left or right, only longing to escape the mire to rest. The wise regard emotions and desires as that ox in the mud. With a straight heart and mind fixed on the Dao, one may avoid all suffering and attain the Dao."

The Perfected One of Great Emptiness, the Red Lord of Southern Marchmount, spoke:
"People commit many transgressions yet do not repent or restrain their hearts. Sins return to them like rivers flowing to the sea, growing deeper and wider day by day. But if one recognizes evil as wrong, repents, and turns to goodness, sins will vanish and virtue will accumulate—thus one may attain the Dao.
When others bring misfortune upon me, I should respond with blessings. Thus, the qi of fortune and virtue will ever arise from this, while the qi of harm and calamity will return to them. This is the conduct of one who studies the Dao."

He also said:
"When the wicked harm the worthy, it is like spitting toward the sky—the spittle does not defile the sky but returns to soil one’s own body. Scattering dust against the wind, the dust does not defile others but returns to soil oneself. The Dao cannot be destroyed; misfortune will surely destroy the self."

The Perfected One of Great Emptiness said:
"Feeding a hundred ordinary people is not as good as feeding one good person. Feeding a thousand good people is not as good as feeding one Dao cultivator. Those who dwell in cold mountains and forests grow in goodness—take this to heart."

The Purple Prime Lady spoke:
"There are five difficulties in the world: the difficulty of almsgiving while poor, the difficulty of studying the Dao while wealthy and noble, the difficulty of controlling fate to avoid death, the difficulty of obtaining the *Cave Scriptures*, and the difficulty of being born in the era of the Sage after the *ren-chen* cycle.
I once asked the Supreme Lord how one might know one’s past lives. The Supreme Lord replied: 'The Dao has no form; knowing it brings no benefit. What matters is to guard your resolve and practice the Dao. It is like polishing a mirror: when the grime is removed, clarity remains, and you will naturally see your form. Cut off the six emotions, guard emptiness and stillness, and you will perceive the truth of the Dao and know your past lives.'
He also said: 'Believing in the Dao, practicing the Dao, and having faith in the Dao—this establishes the root of faith, and its blessings are boundless.'"

The Purple Prime Lady spoke:
"One who cultivates the Dao is like one who carries fire into a dark room—the darkness vanishes, and only light remains. Studying the Dao and preserving integrity, ignorance vanishes, and integrity endures.
Wealth and sensuality are to oneself like a small child coveting the honey on a blade—the sweetness is not enough to delight the mouth, yet it brings the danger of a severed tongue."

The Mysterious Clarity Lady spoke:
"The suffering of being bound to wife, children, and household is greater than imprisonment. Shackles and fetters may be pardoned, but the entanglements of wife and children, though fraught with the peril of a tiger’s maw, one still willingly plunges into them—such sins are unforgivable.
The burdens of emotion upon a person are like holding a torch and walking against the wind. The fool does not release the torch and is certain to burn his hands. The poisons of greed, desire, anger, and ignorance dwell within the human body. If one does not early remove these calamities with the Dao, there will surely be danger and misfortune—just as the fool who holds the torch burns his hands."

One who walks the Dao is like wood upon the water, drifting with the current—neither striking the left bank nor the right, neither seized by men nor barred by spirits, nor left to rot. I guarantee it will reach the sea. One who cultivates the Dao, unconfused by filthy desires, undeceived by manifold evils, and steadfast without doubt—I guarantee they will attain the Dao.

The Lady of the Southern Culmen spoke:
"From love arises sorrow; with sorrow comes the fear of death. Without love, there is no sorrow; without sorrow, there is no fear."

Once, a man recited scriptures late into the night with such grief that his heart was moved, and suddenly he was overcome with longing for home. The Supreme Perfected One then appeared as an ordinary man and approached him, asking, "Are you playing the *zither*?" The man replied, "I often played it when I was at home." The Perfected One asked, "What if the strings are slack?" He answered, "The sound is dull and mournful." The Perfected One asked again, "What if the strings are too tight?" He replied, "The sound snaps, and sorrow deepens." The Perfected One then asked, "What if the tension is just right?" He answered, "All notes harmonize, and the eight melodies are exquisitely played." The Perfected One said, "Cultivating the Dao is the same: when the mind is properly attuned, like tuning the zither, the Dao may be attained."

Of all desires, none is greater than lust; its transgressions know no bounds, its deeds admit no pardon. Were it the only one, that would be bad enough—if there were two, not a single person under heaven could walk the Dao.

For those who study the Dao, no hidden virtue surpasses bestowing kindness, and no deliverance from suffering surpasses guarding the body and upholding the Dao. Their blessings will be vast, and their lives firmly established.

If someone bears ill will toward me, yet I do not accept it, the ill will returns to its source, bringing calamity upon them—as surely as shadow follows form and echo follows sound.

Thus concludes the teachings and admonitions of the Assembly of Spirits.

"Three times I have seen changes come to pass," it is said in the *Carriage of Waiting*. "The essential matter is to build a house on the eastern mountain—at least it can be fenced in." When asked the reason, no answer was given. To the Assembly of Spirits I ask: "Am I the one who is confused?"

The meaning of this remains unclear, so I wished to test it.

Often wandering in heart through mountains and marshes, I entrusted myself to the scenes of immortals and perfected beings. The numinous qi would pity your distant joy, and the mountain spirits would delight in your turning toward cultivation. Thus, the hundred illnesses cannot invade, and the hundred evils cannot assail. Those who frequently burn incense at their sides will steady their souls and constantly perceive the fragrance of the Dao’s breeze—only after long practice will they awaken to it. Awakening, they enter the Dao; entering the Dao, they attain immortality; attaining immortality, they become perfected. In stillness, gazing upon heaven and earth, they contemplate ascending as immortals; in stillness, beholding mountains and rivers, they contemplate ascending as immortals; in stillness, observing the myriad things, they contemplate the compassion of the covering and bearing cosmos. Constantly holding such thoughts in the heart, one attains the Dao.

Human life is but an illusion, a temporary sojourn between heaven and earth, a fleeting moment. If one refines qi and nurtures spirit, enduring hardship to focus on the true, one will soon attain the Dao. Once the Dao is achieved, one becomes one with heaven and earth, dwelling together in the Great Vastness. If one penetrates emptiness and embodies nothingness, then one dwells with the Great Vastness in utter stillness. In this state of profound tranquility, sight perceives nothing, hearing detects no sound; the root of life and death is easily untangled, and the path to enduring longevity is readily found. To find it is possible, and to untangle it is to endure. Those who endure in the Dao preserve wholeness; those who constantly wander with endurance absorb qi. When qi is whole, life persists; only then can one nurture life. Nurturing life unites with the true; only then can one ascend to the two realms of vital qi.

Gaze upon the utter stillness of preserved wholeness, observe the dark and yellow of the myriad things—all is but a temporary lodging. How can one not diligently cultivate? When qi is whole, it repels demonic influences; when wholeness is nurtured, it repels the hundred harms. Entering an army, one avoids weapons; traveling in the mountains, one does not encounter tigers or rhinoceroses. This is what it means.

The heart of one who studies the Dao should always be as urgent as remembering the morning meal—none who do so fail to attain it. Cherish qi as you cherish your face—none who do so fail to preserve it. Yet the face may still be marred, just as qi may still be lost. What people cherish most is their appearance, fearing defilement, and next their limbs. If one cherished qi as the foremost urgency of the body, I have rarely seen such a one wither away.

People follow customs in pursuit of vain fame, like burning incense—though many may smell its fragrance, they do not realize it constantly burns and consumes itself. When it is consumed, its qi vanishes; when fame is established, the self perishes. Thus, the lofty withdraw and distance themselves, attaining purity.

Life as a thing is like the sun, moon, heaven, and earth—these four images stand in direct correspondence with the ceaseless generation of life. If life is lost, the four images also vanish, yet it is not the four images that perish but the fading of life. If life endures, the four images endure as well, for it is not the four images that endure but my own enduring life. Enduring life can also generate beyond form—what need is there to reckon the four images?

When calamity strikes and misfortune arises, the form decays and qi scatters—what sort of affair is this? It resembles excessive speech without holding to the One, pursuing many ends while hoping for mere escape. Thus, the nest suspended on a withered branch falls, and a hundred victories are undone by a single defeat. Alas! How could one of transcendent talent allow themselves to be ruined by petty concerns?

**The Words of the Lady of Southern Marchmount**

The swan and egret turn southward, their distant wings fanning the air across the vast wilds. Those birds deem themselves sufficient, yet the quail sighs at their remoteness, and the great Peng laughs at the swan’s flight as but a foot’s span. If one is content with what is content, and self-sufficient in right and wrong, then the three crows do not debate—why mock them?

**The Words of the Purple Tenuity**

Grief lingers like a snared bird’s tears, the essence of the numinous not yet exhausted. Dependence and hidden forces shift with different causes; the cloud ladder has not yet risen. Though there is longing for progress, one has not yet plumbed the depths of the ultimate principle. Your talent is truly the work of heaven, congealing clear waves into lofty verse, your aspirations nesting in the Great Mystery, aiming for the Purple Court and treading the void. Your heart is pierced by soaring stagnation, your gentle brush flourishing in profound resonance. Your movements align with the compass and square, whether round or square; in stillness, you harmonize with true flavor, exhaling and inhaling to inspire sound. This may be called unrestrained virtue—truly worthy of admiration.

Yet impure thoughts remain unscattered, vulgar attachments inwardly entrenched; lustful desires are not severed, and the numinous pool is not yet clear. Thus, we cannot yet discuss the goals of inner and outer, nor float upon the intersection of the two luminaries. For those who miss the moment, the key lies in reforming their appearance and releasing worldly attachments—then there is no hindrance. Though you temporarily soothe the many listeners, you still achieve harmony. The path ahead is distant and boundless, this and that not yet unified. The threads of composition are many—one must constantly strive in tranquil vigilance. If emotions stray and scatter, gains will be lost with each affair. The words of awakening are subtle—how will you restrain them? How will you dispel them?

**Written Admonition of the Lady Wang of Cloudy Forest, Right Radiance, on the Night of the Twenty-Sixth Day of the Seventh Month**

If you receive this, do not reply. The pure resonance disperses into the void, the divine wind sprinkles the forest. The body transcends the dark thoroughfare, the will chants the numinous tones—such is the one you await. You may show the origins and ends of Master Pei to those who inquire; they will surely achieve harmony. If not guided well, the heart will inwardly reveal itself. What sort of person is Pei, after all?

**Thus concludes the first scroll of *The Scripture of Teachings, Admonitions, Virtues, and Conduct of the Assembly of Perfected of the Highest Clarity.***

**The Scripture of Teachings, Admonitions, Virtues, and Conduct of the Assembly of Perfected of the Highest Clarity, Scroll the Lower**

The Scripture states: Long ago, there was a man named Liu Shaoweng who often entered Mount Taihua, bowing and paying homage to the mountain. After twenty years of this, he suddenly one day encountered the Venerable One of the Western Marchmount, who transmitted to him the Dao of immortality.

The Scripture further states: Once there was a man who, for many mornings, went to the riverbank to bow and pay homage to the river. After ten years of this, the River Lord and River Earl appeared to him, bestowing upon him ten pairs of white jade disks and teaching him the method of walking upon water without drowning. This man now abides in the Central Marchmount, having attained the Dao.

It also states: When Zuo Ci first arrived, he too diligently bowed and paid homage to the numinous mountain. After five years, he was finally permitted to enter the eastern and western palaces within.

It further states: In learning the Dao, one should be as steadfast as Mount Shiyuan; in withdrawing from worldly affairs, one should be as the Pure Numinous Perfected; in treading the deep and secluded, one should be as Zhou Ziyang. How could one fail to attain the Dao?

It also states: In establishing resolve, let it be diligent; in refining the spirit, let it be empty; in all undertakings, let them be secret.

It further states: To the east of Central Mount Mao is a small cave, its mouth barely large enough to admit a dog’s treasure, scarcely allowing a person to enter. Yet the deeper one goes, the more spacious it becomes. A massive stone seals the cave’s entrance, leaving only a small opening the size of a cup, guarded by the mountain spirits. This stone occasionally opens, and it is called the Hidden Palace’s Dark Gate. If you diligently fast and seek it, you may enter here more easily than through the Liangchang Cave’s entrance. The Liangchang Cave’s mouth is filled with sand, its paths winding and secluded, and where it crosses water is not easily traversed. Moreover, the way is long. The small Dark Gate cave, however, descends straight down three or four *li* before reaching the Eastern Dark Palace’s Mysterious Side Gate. After entering this cave’s mouth for two hundred paces, it suddenly becomes as bright as daylight.

It also states: On Great Mount Mao, there is likewise a small cave on its southern face, nearly identical to the first, called the Southern Convenient Gate. Its entrance is also sealed with stone. If one fasts with a pure heart and directs intention toward the Controller of Destinies, and if one regularly ascends the mountain on the second day of the month to extend greetings and offer prayers, one will naturally be granted an audience.

How earnest I have been! How could the Dark Palace not be worth beholding? And what sort of man is Zuo Ci, after all?

The Controller of Destinies of Mount Mao says: If one must model oneself upon Fan Xuan, holding fast to the image, and strive for purity in this rare age, then one may pluck the hidden blossoms from the crowd, fold one’s wings, and nest in lofty seclusion. By savoring the profound and attaining union with the highest, one’s depths become still as a deep pool, steadfast as a mountain. In the desolate jade scriptures, the spirit is born of treasured purity. Casting aside worldly attachments and tuning the zither of the pure and numinous, one clarifies the luminous within emptiness. The Five Paths become manifest, colors transcend the waves of transformation, and desires merge with tranquility. In the vast and obscure thoroughfare of the void, there is neither seeing nor hearing. Only then may one distant-ly equal the wondrous perfected, reawaken profound awakening, perfect inner virtue, and fulfill the outer numinous standard.

In the end, one may ride cloud chariots to ascend the heavens and inscribe one’s name in the Controller of Destinies’ cinnabar register. But if one’s essence scatters across ten thousand thoughts, and life is not firmly rooted—if qi follows the dust and waves, and the heart does not truly dwell—then one merely wearies body and spirit among the wilds, truly misleading those who come to learn. The Dao is subtle yet easy to seek; the Dao is arduous yet difficult to attain.

The Perfected Controller of Destinies of the Southern Marchmount, Lady Wei, says: Yesterday, I accompanied the Controller of Destinies of Mount Mao to the Palace of Pure Emptiness to review the successes and failures of those who have become true immortals. We recently demoted forty-seven individuals but restored three. We also reviewed the name-slips of your cohort. As of now, Xu Miao has been placed on the immortal register. At first, I did not realize he had reached this point—this is all the better. His heart has been cleansed through diligent effort, his devotion has thoroughly penetrated principle, his heart’s cinnabar and intent have been exhausted as if treading upon ice and fire. If one persists thus for long, even a true person cannot escape, nor can the Dao of immortality remain hidden. One must only suppress and sever thoughts of lewdness and lust, and we shall be able to meet him. This may be conveyed to him.

The Register of Determined Records states: The promotion of immortals rests with my subordinate office. The Most High Lord Lao may yet be considered, for among the people of Jiangdong, none have been as devoted to the Dao as this. Yet one must not rely on becoming an immortal and forget the Dao.

It further states: Falsity is the illness of virtue; ostentation is the calamity of the body. Stagnation is the foremost loss; shame is the key to the body. Only after dispelling these four difficulties may one begin to inquire into the Dao.

Then the numinous chariot’s wheels rumbled, and the sun cast faint shadows. If one harbors thoughts of lewd transgressions, one must not practice the Dao of the Highest Perfected. Yesterday, at the Palace of Pure Emptiness, we precisely demoted those of this sort, and they are now undergoing examination before being handed over to the Three Offices for judgment. How could one not be cautious?

The above was proclaimed by Lady Wei of the Southern Marchmount.

The Pure Numinous Perfected says: Once stinginess is forgotten, what is gained is not the same. If base shame is not eliminated, one’s name will not be recorded in the register of the living. Though Attendant Xu has been temporarily removed, he should have been removed long ago and then reinstated.

Lady Wei of the Southern Marchmount says: The Controller of Destinies of the Eastern Minister is well aware of Attendant Xu’s reverence and solemnity. The Lesser Heavenly King recently asked: “Where is this man now, and what Dao is he cultivating?” The Eastern Minister replied: “He is a scholar from my hometown, inwardly enlightened and upright, outwardly blending with worldly affairs. He is a fine talent, now cultivating the Dao of the Highest Perfected.” These words pleased me, for he already bears the form of an immortal.

Perfected Ziyang says: Let Xu Yufu bathe frequently to dispel the qi of water-borne illnesses and dissolve the accumulated afflictions of past examinations. This is also a step toward attaining the true.

Lady Wei of the Purple Tenuity says: Infrequent bathing is the nature of the *po*. To go against the *po* is to refine one’s turbid impurities, and the *po* will naturally vanish.

Lady Youying of the Cloud Forest says: If one dispels stagnation by aiding the destitute and practicing virtue, is this not excellent? One need not worry that virtue will go unrewarded; one should only worry that the seeds of virtue are not sown abundantly. This single practice is like tilling a field of blessings. All matters are of this kind.

Lady Youying further says: From ancient times to the present, the ford between life and death has existed. Those who meet in silence or part in speech, who conceal the past and extinguish knowledge, and who move with the world—these are the practices of attaining the Dao. As for those who ingest the jade elixir once, who take the ninefold radiance thrice in flight, who morning after morning drink the cloud-liquor, who wander amidst flowing yellow, who gaze upward to swallow golden nectar, and who chew the jade stalks—these immediately rein in the luminous and ascend the void, darkly rising to the Great Tenuity.

When worldly affairs deviate from the mysterious Dao and this endeavor remains unfulfilled, one should temporarily tread the path of the Great Yin, concealed in the hidden realm of life. Abandoning the outer form and discarding the physical frame, one nurtures the embryo within the empty dwelling, refines qi to sever the mortal lock, and receives the essence in profound darkness.

Thus, one transforms their countenance within the halls of the Three Yin and restores youthful features at the gates of the Ninefold Refinement. Only then does one realize that the immortals are extraordinary—dying yet not perishing—and that the matters of departure and return are principles of profound depth.

The *Record of Mao Ding* states: The phoenix nests in lofty trees, its white plumage gleaming; treading the path of compliance and contemplating completion, one concentrates the mind on the empty and mysterious. The five lords’ stone paste suits the body’s needs—hasten to ingest it, and it may restore youthful appearance. When the three eights are clarified, proceed with the practice of the mysterious and true. Releasing the reins to rest, one may be said to have mastered the profound scriptures.

The jade blade responds to the proper measure; with a refined mind dwelling in lofty seclusion, silently sinking into stillness, the upright qi remains unharmed. Dispersing techniques to eliminate illness—these are what you should pursue. Next, consume □-grain meals, and do not forsake grains; this will enrich the marrow, dispel afflictions, and nourish the skin and flesh. Thereafter, ascend the mountains, chant the cavernous verses, and expound the subtle. With the tiger’s white teeth, you will then perceive the signs and thus attain deathlessness.

After passing the *ren-chen* day, rest beneath the flourishing trees, peruse the *Zhou Book*, and inscribe the Great Ultimate on bamboo slips. The golden name of the Western Florescence—whether to study or practice it—rests in the resonance of the numinous talisman. Though principles differ, their union is the same, and the spirit seeks the mysterious in mutual accord.

The *Mao’s Preservation of Life* says: When encountering teachings, they must be put to use; to disregard them is to lack sincerity. How then can one ride swift traces to seek the spirits in the empty void? Subtle words carry profound meaning—employ them with care and do not treat them lightly. In all matters, respond to the divine mechanism, and you will safeguard your vision of Great Peace.

Here ends the *Lower Scroll of the Upper Clarity Scripture of the Teachings, Precepts, Virtues, and Conduct of the Host of Perfected Ones*.
