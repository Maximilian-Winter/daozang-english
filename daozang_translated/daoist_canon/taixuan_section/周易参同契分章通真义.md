**Preface to *Zhouyi Cantong Qi with Chapter Divisions and True Meaning***

The Preface states: According to the *Biographies of Divine Transcendents*, the Perfected One Wei Boyang was a native of Shangyu in Kuaiji. His family had long worn the hairpin of office, yet he alone did not serve, cultivating the True in seclusion and nurturing his aspiration in emptiness and non-being. Profound in literary expression and versed in all apocrypha and prognostications, he embraced simplicity and guarded his purity, following only the Dao. He regarded carriages and robes as mere husks and chaff.

It is unknown from which master he received transmission, but he obtained the *Ancient Text of the Dragon and Tiger Classic* and fully grasped its wondrous purport. Thereupon, he drew upon the *Zhouyi* to compose the *Cantong Qi* in three scrolls.

Moreover, it is said that as the subtlest details remained unexhausted, he composed the *Supplement to Omissions and Elisions*, a single scroll further expounding the profound mysteries of the alchemical canon. His exposition often employed allegory and borrowed events, veiling and revealing through variant texts. He secretly imparted this to Xu, the Attendant of Qingzhou, who then concealed his name to annotate it. By the reigns of Emperors Xiao and Huan of the Later Han, the Master transmitted it to his fellow townsman Chunyu Shutong, whereupon it circulated in the world.

The *Cantong Qi* was composed because the Master held that the cultivation of the elixir shares the same path as the creative transformations of Heaven and Earth, and thus he relied upon the images of the *Zhouyi* to expound it. Without exception, he borrowed the relationship of ruler and minister to illustrate inner and outer, employed *li* and *kan* to directly indicate mercury and lead, arrayed *qian* and *kun* to establish the measure of the crucible, clarified them as father and mother to bind the beginning and end, united them as husband and wife to constrain their intercourse—likening them to male and female—manifested them in generation, analyzed them into yin and yang, guided them through inversion and reversion, and revealed them in the dark and new moons. He connected them with ascent and descent, matched them with the hexagrams and lines, embodied them in transformation, followed the handle of the Dipper to take its cyclical stars, divided them by dawn and dusk, and illuminated them through the clepsydra. Thus, *qian* and *kun* became the crucible, yin and yang the embankments, water and fire the mechanism of transformation, the Five Agents the aids, true lead the progenitor of the medicine, mysterious essence the foundation of the elixir, *kan* and *li* husband and wife, and Heaven and Earth father and mother. Mutually deploying the eight trigrams, driving and directing the four seasons, dividing the three hundred eighty-four lines to circulate the firing times, and revolving the five planets and twenty-eight constellations around the crucible—only then could the Water Tiger conceal its form, lodging in *geng* and *xin* to turn westward, and the Fire Dragon subdue its body, pursuing *jia* and *yi* to revolve eastward.

The *Zhouyi* states: "The sage, having perceived the traces of the world, models them in form and likeness, symbolizing their proper attributes." The Master thus took up these images. If not one of utmost penetration in the world, who could have achieved this? Behold: he cleaved open the primordial chaos, split asunder the vast expanse, directly pointed to the numinous root of Heaven and Earth as the progenitor of the medicine, and clearly beheld the sagely mother of yin and yang as the foundation of the elixir. He disclosed the origin of the One Qi’s transformations and revealed the basis of the Great Foundry’s generation. If not one of utmost comprehension in the world, who could have achieved this?

Some may fix the clepsydra, divide the sundial’s hours, cluster yin and yang, dispatch spirits and ghosts, compress the three thousand six hundred breaths of primordial qi, and revolve the seventy-two seasonal nodes. They may move the sixty-four hexagrams’ yin tally, with the Celestial Pass in hand, and drum the twenty-four solar terms’ yang fire, with the Earthly Axis at heart. Heaven and Earth cannot conceal the mechanism of creation, nor can yin and yang hide the root of nurturance. Thus, the spirit transforms the primordial square, and pure generation arises. If not one of utmost clarity in the world, who could have achieved this?

The *Cantong Qi* states: "The Golden Crucible of Chaos, white and black in accord; the Dragon Horse descends its essence, the mare and stallion intermingle their qi. Like frost upon horse’s teeth, like jade and dog’s fangs; mercury dwells with the astonished maiden, cinnabar mercury unites with the infant’s body." Distinguishing the qualities of the medicine, subtly revealing the elixir’s form, it fully encompasses the latent work of completed transformation and greatly manifests the portents of what has yet to germinate. If not one of utmost numinosity in the world, who could have achieved this?

Some borrow the images of the lines to embed these matters, yet dare not leak the celestial mechanism, nor can they bear to conceal the profound principle. Thus, they unfold without cease, repeatedly weaving and threading, unable to desist, and so form scrolls. Their aim is to point out the essential Dao, to draw in those to come, and to grieve for those embodied beings who, in the end, become mere ghosts of utter yin. If not one of utmost benevolence in the world, who could have achieved this?

There are those who penetrate the virtue of the Three Luminaries, roam the essence of the Eight Poles, ingest golden sand to transform their form and substance, and feed upon fiery mercury to refine their essence and spirit. Thus, they attain a body of pure yang, a spirit born in the true dwelling, shed the Three Corpses to transcend the Three Realms, and ascend to the Upper Clarity as Perfected Transcendents. If not one of utmost authenticity in the world, who could have achieved this?

As for those who divide the *True Cantong Qi* into chapters and meanings, they take borrowing as their fundamental principle, with no fixed standard above or below. The text is broad, yet the Dao is upright; the matters are manifest, yet the words are subtle. Later generations discuss it, each taking what they see: some divide the characters to debate, others combine the sentences to annotate. There is no lack of divergent streams and separate currents, giving rise to disputes over beauty and ugliness. Those of shallow learning seek to investigate it but find it difficult to attain immediate clarity. Since the discussions at the beginning and end differ, the right and wrong in their choices remain uncertain. Now, chapters and sentences are divided and fixed, valuing the coherence of principle. The meaning is upright, the text follows, and the "Gate of Medicines" is appended, thus organizing four scrolls into three volumes, comprising ninety chapters to correspond to the number of the Nine Yangs. It is titled *True Meaning of the Divided Chapters*.

The main text is written in red, while the ancillary meanings are in black, clearly visible for perusal. The upper volume contains forty chapters, the middle volume thirty-eight, and the lower volume twelve. Within it is the *Song of the Crucible*, whose words and principles are interlinked, and whose characters and phrases are fragmented, making division into chapters impossible. Thus, it is preserved alone to correspond to the number of the One Water, symbolizing the completion of the yin and yang numbers in the Dao of the elixir.

Furthermore, following the *True Cantong Qi*, I have composed the *Illuminating Mirror: Diagrams and Secrets*, a single scroll appended to the end of the lower volume, to further open the doors and windows of the *True Cantong Qi*. Having received transmission from my teacher and devoted years of study, I dare not conceal the profound text. Thus, I have diligently completed this true meaning, hoping—if only by a ten-thousandth part—to bequeath it to later generations.

**The *Zhouyi Cantong Qi: Divided Chapters with Penetrating the True Meaning*, Volume One**

*Annotated by Peng Xiao, the True One of Flying Crane Mountain, Gentleman for Court Audience, Acting External Minister of the Bureau of Sacrifices in the Ministry of Rites, and Bearer of the Purple Gold Fish Bag*

**Chapter One: Qian and Kun as the Gateways of the *Yi***

Qian and Kun are the gateways of the *Yi*, the parents of all hexagrams.
Kan and Li serve as the wheel’s rim and axle, guiding its true course.

Before the Great Change, the Great Void, and the Great Beginning, though the supremely subtle was already latent, no signs or sprouts had yet appeared.
At the juncture of the Great Commencement, the Great Simplicity, and the Great Ultimate, there arose the undifferentiated, which is the state of primordial chaos.
Within it lay the essence of the True One, the origin of heaven and earth, the mother of the myriad things.
Once the One qi took form, the Two Modes divided. Thereafter came Qian and Kun, yin and yang, the Three Powers, the Five Phases, and the myriad things with their countless names.
Thus, Qian and Kun are established as the warp of heaven and earth, and the operation of yin and yang becomes the key to creation. With Qian and Kun in place, yin and yang move within them.

Master Wei states that the refinement of the Golden Elixir of Return aligns with the path of creation. Borrowing the images of the *Yi* to expound it, he invariably begins by delving into the True One’s chaotic qi of heaven and earth as the root foundation. Next, he draws upon the essential purity of Qian and Kun and the traces of their revolving motion as the model, following the numerical patterns of *Kan*, *Li*, *Pi*, and *Tai* to establish the instruments of punishment and virtue, and seizing the mechanism of yin-yang transformation to complete winter and summer.
Yin arises after noon; yang emerges at midnight.
In movement, it rises from the yang nine; in stillness, it follows the yin six—this is the great purport of elixir refinement.
Thus, Qian and Kun serve as the crucible and vessel, Kan and Li as the enclosing frame, water and fire as husband and wife, yin and yang as dragon and tiger, the Five Phases as the weft containing true essence, and the Three Powers as the warp gathering pure vitality.
Cold comes and heat departs, circulating through the three hundred and eighty-four lines;
The hare rises and the crow sinks, ascending and descending over three hundred and eighty-four days.
All these begin with the substance of the two hexagrams, Qian and Kun, and unfold into transformation.
Hence it is said: Qian and Kun are the gateways of the *Yi*, the parents of all hexagrams.

**Chapter Two: The Four Hexagrams of the Female and Male***
The four hexagrams of the female and male serve as the lofty key.

The Way of yin and yang is enveloped and upheld, much like a skilled charioteer who follows the marking line, grasps the reins and bit, aligns the compass and square, and follows the wheel tracks. By abiding in the center to govern the exterior, the calculations are bound to the pitch pipes and calendrical cycles. The lunar phases consist of five or six days, with the warp and weft serving the sun’s command. Combined, they form sixty, with firmness and yielding possessing outer and inner aspects.

In refining the golden liquid and returning elixir, within the crucible lies the Golden Mother’s Flowery Pond—also called the Golden Womb Divine Chamber—where the four hexagrams Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li serve as the medicine. The "lofty key" refers to the pivotal mechanism, while "enveloping" means to encompass and enfold. Thus, there are the yin crucible and yang furnace, the firm fire and yielding tally, all adhering to the sixty-four hexagrams, cycling endlessly in mutual employment. Within this, the movements of spring, summer, autumn, and winter are enacted, dividing the twenty-four qi, segmenting the seventy-two seasonal nodes, compressing a year’s twelve months of climatic conditions into a single month, and further condensing a month’s conditions into the twelve hours of a day and night. The clepsydra is calibrated, the two crescents are distinguished, midnight and noon are separated, yin and yang are regulated, the dark and new moons are harmonized, the dragon and tiger are united, all in accordance with the great numbers of heaven and earth and the transformative mechanisms of yin and yang. If control and guidance are without error, and movement and transference are without loss, then externally, the tally of yin and yang is exchanged, and internally, the bodies of the dragon and tiger are generated. Thus it is said: A skilled craftsman follows the marking line without deviation; an able charioteer grasps the reins and bit without wavering, aligning with the compass and square and adhering to the wheel tracks. This is a metaphor for the adept refining the elixir in accordance with the fire phases.

The lunar phases of five or six days constitute thirty days; each day and night corresponds to one hexagram, totaling sixty hexagrams. The four hexagrams Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li are the parents of the medicine, the pivotal mechanism of the crucible and vessel. However, this does not refer to the numerical correspondence of day and night but rather encompasses the sixty-four hexagrams as a whole. "The warp and weft serve the sun’s command" means the hexagrams and lines serve as the warp of daily use, while the weft consists of the pitch pipes and calendrical calculations. "Firmness and yielding possess outer and inner aspects" refers to yang as firm and yin as yielding, with water and fire, metal and wood mutually serving as outer and inner.

**Chapter Three: The Hexagrams *Zhun* and *Meng* at Dawn and Dusk**
At dawn, *Zhun* governs the affairs; by dusk, *Meng* assumes the duty. Each day and night corresponds to one hexagram, employed in sequential order. In circulating the fire phases of yin and yang’s ascent and descent day and night, all adhere to the sequence of one hexagram governing each day and night, beginning with the two hexagrams *Zhun* and *Meng* as the starting point. *Zhun* governs at dusk, and *Meng* at dawn, establishing this as the order.

**Chapter Four: The Hexagrams *Ji* and *Wei* at Dusk and Dawn**
*Ji* and *Wei* extend to dusk and dawn, ending only to begin anew. The celestial stems and earthly branches serve as the measure, with movement and stillness varying in earliness and lateness. *Ji* and *Wei* refer to the two hexagrams *Jiji* and *Weiji*. "Dusk and dawn" signify the alternation of dark and new moons, yin and yang, brightness and obscurity, going and returning. "The celestial stems and earthly branches serve as the measure, with movement and stillness varying in earliness and lateness" means yang pertains to movement and yin to stillness. Within the twelve hours, the early and late phases are divided, with yin and yang ascending and descending, the fire phases cycling endlessly in mutual employment.

**Chapter Five: Spring and Summer Rely on the Inner Body**
In spring and summer, rely on the inner body, from *zi* to *chen* and *si*. In autumn and winter, employ the outer application, from *wu* to *xu* and *hai*. The yang fire advances the tally from *zi* to *si*, where pure yang governs, seeking outer yang from inner yin. The yin tally retreats the fire from *wu* to *hai*, where pure yin governs, with outer yang attaching to inner yin. This is the principle of the inner and outer bodies, the pattern of flourishing and decline, beginning with *Fu* and ending with *Kun*, all determined by the images of the lines.

**Chapter Six: Rewards and Punishments Correspond to Spring and Autumn**
Rewards and punishments correspond to spring and autumn, with dusk and dawn aligning with cold and heat. The line texts embody benevolence and righteousness, expressing joy and anger in accordance with the seasons. Thus, they correspond to the four seasons, and the Five Phases attain their principles. The generative qi of spring is called reward; the astringent qi of autumn is called punishment. From *zi*, *chou*, and *yin* is spring; from *mao*, *chen*, and *si* is summer—these are the four yang fire phases. From *wu*, *wei*, and *shen* is autumn; from *you*, *xu*, and *hai* is winter—these are the yin tally phases. Within the twelve hours, the fire tally is circulated in accordance with these four seasons and Five Phases, aligning with dusk and dawn, cold and heat, benevolence and righteousness, joy and anger. The images of the lines must not deviate by even a hair’s breadth, hence it is said to be without loss. Within the crucible, the four seasons remain unblemished; within the image, cold and heat are unified—thus the elixir is surely formed.

An ancient song says:
The sage seizes the intent of creation,
Grasping sun and moon to place within the crucible.
Subtly inverting the essence of heaven and earth,
Boring through yin and yang to move spirits and ghosts.
Who recognizes the sun’s soul and moon’s spirit?
Those who do are true immortals.
Refining and ingesting for a thousand days,
The body, devoid of yin, cannot die.

Therefore, in refining the golden liquid and returning elixir, if one does not model the images of heaven and earth’s creation and follow the natural principles, there will be no accomplishment.

**Chapter Seven: Heaven and Earth Establish Their Positions**
Heaven and earth establish their positions, and the *Yi* operates within them. Heaven and earth are the images of Qian and Kun. "Establishing positions" means arranging the positions of yin and yang in correspondence. The *Yi* refers to Kan and Li. Kan and Li are the two functions of Qian and Kun. The two functions have no fixed line positions, circulating through the six voids. Their coming and going are unfixed, their ascent and descent without constancy. Hidden and submerged, they transform within; encompassing and enveloping the myriad things, they serve as the warp and woof of the Dao.

"Heaven and earth establish their positions" means modeling the crucible and vessel after the image of *Jiji*. "The *Yi* operates within them" refers to the circulation of yin and yang, Kan and Li, and the fire tally within. Having modeled the crucible and vessel after Qian and Kun, one further installs the Golden Mother within to complete the Three Powers of heaven, earth, and humanity.

Kan and Li, the two functions without fixed line positions, refer to the external application of water and fire, their movement and stillness without constancy. Thus they circulate through the six voids, their coming and going, ascent and descent without fixed positions. Now hidden, now manifest; now active, now latent—they serve as the origin of all transformations and the mother of generation and completion. Hence they are called the warp and woof of the Dao.

**Chapter Eight: Using the Non-Existent to Govern the Existent**
Using the non-existent to govern the existent, the vessel’s function is emptiness. Thus in the ebb and flow, Kan and Li vanish. The non-existent is the dragon; the existent is the tiger. The non-existent is the yang qi of mercury; the existent is the yin essence of lead. Lead and mercury reside within the empty vessel yet cannot generate transformation on their own. Through the ascent and descent of Kan and Li, propelling the four seasons, generation and completion become manifest. This is using the empty vessel to govern the existent with the non-existent. As the *Ancient Text of the Dragon and Tiger Classic* states: "When the existent and non-existent mutually govern, the Vermilion Bird flames in the void." Thus when yin grows, yang retreats; when yang rises, yin recedes. In the alternation of ebb and flow, Kan and Li vanish in accordance with the seasons.

**Chapter Nine: No Careless Creation**
No careless creation in speech, no groundless emergence in discourse. Drawing on evidence to verify effects, measuring and aligning with the numinous. Extending categories to structure characters, tracing principles for proof. Kan is the lunar essence of *wu*; Li is the solar radiance of *ji*. Sun and moon form the *Yi*, their hardness and softness in balance. Earth reigns over the four seasons, weaving the beginning and end. Green, red, white, and black each occupy their quadrant, all receiving the power of the central palace, the achievement of *wu* and *ji*. The sage does not carelessly fabricate empty words to delude later generations. Thus he cites the sun and moon as evidence, measures and aligns with the numinous, distinguishes hardness and softness, points to metal and water, compares dragon and tiger to grasp their images, moves yin and yang to fathom their essence, completes the work with the five earths, and binds it with the four seasons. Thereupon green, red, white, and black cycle in succession, all receiving the power of *wu* and *ji*.

Kan as the lunar essence of *wu* is lunar yin; *wu* is yang. This is yin containing yang, resembling metal-tiger born within water. Li as the solar radiance of *ji* is solar yang; *ji* is yin. This is yang containing yin, resembling mercury-dragon born within fire. Thus in refining the elixir, one gathers the essence of sun and moon, harmonizes the numinous qi of yin and yang. When the cycle of stellar numbers is complete and the movement of yin and yang concludes, all credit returns to the virtue of earth, and the numinous essence is perfected. "Extending categories to structure characters" refers to the character *Yi* resembling sun and moon.

**Chapter Ten: The *Yi* as Image**
The *Yi* is image. Suspended images manifesting clarity—none greater than the sun and moon. Exhausting the numinous to know transformation: when yang departs, yin arrives. The spokes interlock as the wheel turns, emerging and entering, rolling and unrolling. The *Yi* contains three hundred eighty-four lines; drawing lines to extract tally-signs, the tally-signs refer to the sixty-four hexagrams. From the dark moon to the dawn of the new moon, Zhen arrives to receive the tally. At this moment, heaven and earth unite their essence, sun and moon mutually embrace. The male yang spreads its dark offering; the female yin transforms the yellow womb. Chaos intermingles, the root foundation is established. Cultivating and nourishing the bud, concentrating spirit to form the body. All things tread forth from it; no movement fails to arise from it.

The *Yi* is image. It is the sun and moon uniting to form one. The golden liquid returning elixir is nothing other than the union of the sun and moon’s yin and yang essences. Thus the essence of yin and yang emerges and enters, rolls and unrolls; day and night cycle endlessly, returning to the beginning. Approximately sixty-four hexagrams, following three hundred eighty-four lines; drawing lines to extract tally-signs, fire follows advance and retreat. When yin comes, yang departs; when yang hides, yin acts. The qi of east and west intermingle; the sentiments of husband and wife harmonize. At this moment, Zhen arrives to receive the tally. Heaven and earth unite their essence; sun and moon join their souls and spirits. Chaos resembles the hen’s egg, the two crescents uniting like chaos. The yang dragon and yin tiger within chaos bear the qi of mutual resonance, establishing the root foundation, nurturing the bud, until spirit congeals into form, ultimately becoming a refined entity. Thus within the crucible chamber is another heaven and earth. All creatures, from the smallest to the greatest, arise from it.

The male yang belongs to heaven, hence the dark; the female yin belongs to earth, hence the yellow. These are the old yang and old yin. Qian the father and Kun the mother alternately employ the fire tally to its utmost. Thus one knows that within a single crucible, the transformations are each illuminated as heaven and earth’s movement, giving rise to the ten thousand kinds. If the fire timing is lost, the addition and subtraction overdone, cold and heat unseasonal, advance and retreat misaligned—then within heaven and earth, by what seasonal markers would things generate their images? By what yin and yang would dragon and tiger be born?

**Chapter Eleven: At This, Confucius**
At this, Confucius praised the primal chaos, the virtue of Qian and Kun pervading the void. Investigating antiquity to the primordial sovereign, the *Guanju* established the beginning. The qi of marriage and capping intertwine; the first year then germinates. Confucius praised the Dao of the *Yi*, dividing Qian and Kun as the origin of the myriad things, establishing *Xian* and *Da* as the model for husband and wife. He split the primal chaos, chiseled the undifferentiated, revealed the forms of ghosts and spirits, and communicated the sentiments of heaven and earth. Thus ruler and minister, father and son, husband and wife, male and female, the five phases mutually generating and overcoming—the mechanism of the myriad things’ transformations was exhausted. Thus Qian and Kun illuminated their pervading void.

Therefore Master Wei compared the *Yi* to establishing the crucible vessel, moving the celestial mechanism, uniting the forms of dragon and tiger, harmonizing the bodies of husband and wife. Initially, the complete non-existent form and essence resembled the primal chaos. After kindling the fire and moving the tally, the male and female essences intertwined. Thus the mutual longing of the *Guanju*, the seeking of marriage and capping. From the first kindling of fire, the first year’s germination is fitting. Sun abiding in moon, the dragon and tiger’s forms are established.

**Chapter Twelve: The Sage Is Not Born in Vain**

The sage is not born in vain,
Gazing upward to perceive the manifest celestial tally.
The celestial tally advances and retreats,
Expanding and contracting in accord with the seasons.
Thus the *Yi* governs the heart of Heaven.

The sage Fuxi, looking up and down,
Examined the patterns and numbers,
Discerned the nature of the myriad things,
And bequeathed them to later generations,
That those yet unenlightened might peer into the apertures of Heaven and Earth,
Plunder the essence of yin and yang,
Grasp the root of creation,
And distinguish the forms of tally and response.
Mutual generation and overcoming,
Advance and retreat, expansion and contraction—
All lie within the palm’s grasp.
Thus it is said: the *Yi* governs the heart of Heaven.

Therefore, he established the symbolic forms,
Probed the utmost essence,
Prepared the crucible and furnace,
Circulated the tally and fire,
Followed the water clock’s measure,
Practiced the hexagrams and lines,
Determined the hours,
Divided the seasonal nodes,
To exhaust the great reckoning of Heaven and Earth.

**Chapter Thirteen: The *Fu* Hexagram Establishes the First Sprout**

The *Fu* hexagram establishes the first sprout,
The eldest son inheriting the father’s body,
Founding the primal foundation upon the mother.
Ebb and flow respond to the pitch pipes,
After three days, clarity emerges,
*Zhen* receives *geng* from the west.
On the eighth day, *Dui* receives *ding*,
The first quarter hangs level as a plumb line.
On the fifteenth, the Qian body is complete,
Fully replete in *jia* and the eastern quarter.
The toad and hare, the moon’s spirit,
Gaze upon the hexagram’s nodes.
When the reckoning is done, they bend and descend.

The *Fu* hexagram, in establishing the first sprout,
Conceives the mother.
On the fifteenth day, the Qian son and the double brightness ascend and descend,
Relying upon the pivot of the Dipper.
*Zhen* receives *geng* from the west.
On the eighth day, *Dui*—
The qi of sun and moon shines doubly bright.

The hare spews forth radiant light.
In the seven-to-eight Dao, the eldest son inherits the father’s body,
Establishing the six yin lines below, with the first changing to one yang line—
Hence it is called "founding the first sprout."
This refers to the *Kun* hexagram’s lowest line transforming into a *Qian* line;
*Qian* is the father, and from the third day the moon takes form, the yang number reaching its half.
The Wei Duke lodges this hexagram’s inner structure, completing *Zhen*,
While *Kun* is *Zhen*’s root—thus it is said, "establishing the primal foundation."
*Zhen* is *Qian*’s eldest, and from here, following the seasons, it gradually transforms,
Until the fifteenth day, when it becomes pure—hence it is said, "inheriting the father’s body."
Likewise, by the eighth day, the first quarter is complete,
An analogy for the cauldron’s metal and water each at half.
Fullness emerges from the eastern quarter,
The toad and hare’s spirits an analogy for the cauldron’s metal and water,
Full and perfected by the fire’s timing.
The moon’s waxing is likened to this: within half a month’s three *hou*,
The yang fire advances, drawing and adding within the cauldron,
Over half a day’s six *chen*, receiving the fire tally,
Giving rise to these transformations and first sprouts.
"Seven-to-eight Dao complete" refers to the fifteenth day,
When the *Qian* body is fully realized.
"Bending, descending low" refers to what follows:
From the sixteenth day onward, the yang fire retreats, and the yin tally is employed.

**Sixteenth Turning Receives the Mandate, Chapter Fourteen**
The sixteenth turning receives the mandate,
*Xun* meets *xin* at dawn’s level brightness.

**Gen** aligns with south at *bing*,
The twenty-third day marks the waning half-moon.
*Kun* and *yi* on the thirtieth day—
In the northeast, its companion is lost.
When the cycle is exhausted, they yield to one another,
The succeeding body revives the dragon.

That "the sixteenth turning receives the mandate" means:
From the sixteenth day onward, the yang fire first retreats,
And the yin tally begins to arise.
That "*Xun* meets *xin* at dawn’s level brightness" is like
The initial advance of the yang fire,
As when the moon first appears on the third day.
That "the twenty-third day marks the waning half-moon" is again
Like the waxing half-moon in meaning:
Metal and water are each half.
That "*Kun* and *yi* on the thirtieth day—
In the northeast, its companion is lost" means:
The yin tally reaches this point,
And the yang fire is entirely consumed.

Within one month, yin and yang are each half,
Yin and yang yield to one another,
Water and fire depend on each other.
When one month ends, it begins anew,
Again employing the *Fu* hexagram to commence,
Thus it is said: "The succeeding body revives the dragon."

**Chapter Fifteen: Ren and Gui Pair with Jia and Yi**
*Ren* and *gui* pair with *jia* and *yi*,
*Qian* and *Kun* encompass beginning and end.
Seven and eight make fifteen,
Nine and six likewise correspond.
These four combine to thirty—
The yang qi seeks extinction and concealment.
The eight trigrams array the celestial bodies,
Their movements never stray from the center.

*Ren* and *gui* are yin;
*Jia* and *yi* are yang.
Yin and yang pair together,
Meaning the elixir mother within the *Qian-Kun* cauldron
Receives the qi of the yang dragon and yin tiger in union,
Thus it is said: "*Qian* and *Kun* encompass beginning and end."
Seven, eight, nine, and six—
These four combine to thirty days.
Within thirty days, seven and nine correspond to yang numbers,
Six and eight to yin numbers.
*Qian* and *Kun* each take half,
And by the thirtieth day, all is complete—
Yin tally and yang fire both conclude.
Thus, when firing the elixir for one month,
One follows the eight trigrams,
Arraying the celestial bodies in their courses,
Advancing and withdrawing, ascending and descending
Through north and south, east and west,
So that yin and yang unfold and coil,
And metal and water harmonize.
If the firing is mistimed,
Drought and flood disrupt the seasons;
The principles of generation and completion are impaired,
And the dragon and tiger’s forms are hard to retain.
Those who practice firing must ponder this carefully.

**Chapter Sixteen: The Primordial Essence is Subtle and Hard to Perceive**
The primordial essence is subtle and hard to perceive—
One infers and verifies it through signs.
When at rest, observe its image,
And model its form accordingly.
Erect a gnomon as a standard,
Divining auspices to determine fortune or misfortune.
Issue commands in accord with the seasons,
Never missing the moment when the lines shift.
Above, examine the patterns of the *River Chart*,
Below, sequence the earth’s flowing forms.
In the center, investigate the human heart,
Comparing and considering the Three Powers.
In movement, follow the hexagrams’ rhythms;
In stillness, rely on the *Image*’s words.
*Qian* and *Kun* are put into practice—
Only then are heaven and earth ordered.
How could one fail to be cautious?

**The Primordial Essence as the Divine Spirit Within the Crucible**
The primordial essence is the divine spirit and true essence within the crucible—
The primordial *qi* of heaven and earth.
Though it cannot be grasped or seen,
It subtly follows the mechanisms of transformation,
Giving birth to and nurturing the myriad things.
Since it is profound and obscure, difficult to perceive,
One must infer and verify it through signs,
Erect a gnomon as a standard,
And issue commands in accord with celestial omens.
Thus, gazing upward, one observes the patterns of heaven;
Looking downward, one examines the principles of earth.
Only then can one unite the *hun* and *po* of heaven and earth,
Harmonize the contraction and expansion of *yin* and *yang*,
Establish the Three Powers,
And determine the auspicious and the sovereign.
Following the hexagrams’ images and the lines’ words,
Distinguishing dawn and dusk,
Regulating ascent and descent,
One achieves the harmony of *Qian* and *Kun*,
The union of husband and wife,
The intercourse of dragon and tiger,
And the ordering of heaven and earth.

The above discusses adhering to the clepsydra’s marks,
Directing the talismanic fire,
Clarifying withdrawal and addition,
Distinguishing advance and retreat—
Never deviating from the celestial motions of sun, moon, and stars.
Thus, within the crucible, the divine essence of the myriad things
Is produced in accord with the four seasons.
How could the adept who directs the talismanic fire fail to be cautious?

**Chapter Seventeen: The First Principle of Governance**
The first principle of governance
Encompasses the subtle and the hidden,
Opening and unfolding to spread forth treasures.
It is the pivotal handle of the essential Dao,
The guiding thread of transformation.
When the lines and images stir within,
Fortune and misfortune arise without.
The five planets move in errant or orderly paths,
Responding to the seasons and stirring in resonance.
When the four and seven fall into discord,
They shift and stray, bowing and rising.

The first principle of governance
Is the sequential beginning of the adept who directs the talismanic fire.
Once the metal is smelted and the crucible formed,
One must secure and seal it, ensuring subtlety and concealment.
To "open and unfold, spreading forth treasures"
Means the inner metal flows freely, its fluids abundant,
Gold and water depending on one another.
Again, one follows the handle of the Dipper,
Traversing the twelve earthly branches,
Aligning the five planets within the four and seven.
The four and seven are the twenty-eight constellations.

If the celestial omens and portents fall into disarray, their signs and tokens failing to align, then fortune and misfortune arise from the moving lines, and the talismanic fire loses its rhythm with dawn and dusk. This causes the outer five planets to fall into chaos, and the inner five qi to lose harmony. When the four and seven fall into discord, the circumpolar stars scatter and stray, and the crucible fails to generate and complete its work.

Though the external fire moves and progresses, if the inner talisman remains still and unresponsive, then the celestial soul and terrestrial spirit fail to unite. Thus, the stars fall into disorder, the sun and moon deviate from their courses, the four seasons lose their balance, and the myriad things fail to flourish. This arises from the mismanagement of the fire, where summer and autumn lose their proper measure, causing the crucible to suffer from unseasonable drought or deluge.

**Section Seventeen of the *Compendium of Literary Governance* states:**
The Literary Governance Compendium summons the scrutiny of the Three Ducal Ministers.
All officials and functionaries oversee their respective domains.

The Literary Governance Compendium refers to the Dipper’s handle bearing the basket—six stars known as the Hall of Literature: the first is the Supreme General, the second the Secondary General, the third the Noble Minister, the fourth the Director of Destinies, the fifth the Director of Records, and the sixth the Director of Calamities. The Three Ducal Ministers are the six stars beneath the Dipper’s handle, paired two by two, called the Three Terraces. Those who govern the world assist the Son of Heaven above in harmonizing yin and yang and aligning the four seasons, while below they ensure the suitability of the myriad things, enabling ministers and grandees to fulfill their duties. This mirrors the crucible receiving the qi of Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things, generating and transforming within.

When yin and yang fall into discord and the four seasons lose their proper measure, it is like the adept who directs the talismanic fire, whose regulation and balance exceed or fall short—hence the admonition and reproof.

The elixir of golden fluid and returning cinnabar lies hidden in the two words: *lead* and *fire*. To complete the work from beginning to end, one must first obtain true lead, and then—even more difficult—true fire. How could this be lightly discussed? Thus, Master Wei expounded it broadly, fearing that later generations might yet fall into confusion.

**Section Nineteen: The Sun Harmonizes the Essence of the Five Phases**
The sun harmonizes the essence of the five phases,
The moon receives the discipline of the six pitch-pipes.
Five and six make thirty degrees,
Once the cycle is complete, it begins anew.
Tracing origins and seeking ends,
The threads of survival and decay.
At times the ruler grows arrogant and excessive,
Overbearing and transgressing the Dao.
At times the minister is devious and obsequious,
His conduct straying from the proper path.
The waxing and waning of crescents and full moons,
Discord and change bring misfortune and blame.
Those who enforce the law admonish and criticize,
Their clumsy outcries leaving faults for the ruler to bear.

The sun harmonizing the essence of the five phases means that each month it once conjoins with the moon. The moon receiving the discipline of the six pitch-pipes refers to the metal and water within the crucible, which each month receive half of the pitch-pipe qi. There are six pitch-pipes and six complementary pipes, which the sun and moon share between them. The sun, moon, five planets, and celestial weave together generate the myriad things, just as the crucible receives the external qi of yin and yang, the talismanic rise and fall of midnight and noon, the essence of the five planets’ progression, and the purest union of sun and moon. Adversity and prosperity follow one another, survival and decay intertwine, cycling anew—beginning with *Return* and ending with *Receptive*.

Within the divine chamber, the yin essence resides in the central palace, dwelling in the virtue of earth and symbolizing the ruler. If the crucible responds internally but fails to act externally with focus, it is because the sovereign has grown arrogant and excessive, causing tribute from the four directions to cease. When ministers are devious and obsequious, the timing of the fire falls into error, the waxing and waning of crescents and full moons become irregular, and the dark and new moons bring misfortune and blame—all of which are laid at the ruler’s feet. The ruler is the metal essence, the earth virtue, the divine chamber. The ministers are the five phases, the six pitch-pipes, the essence and qi. Success or failure rests with the adept who directs the talismanic fire. From this, the maidservant flees, the red dragon bolts, the divine essence departs—what then remains of the golden fluid to seek?

**Section Twenty: The Celestial Pole Receives the Proper Measure**
The celestial pole receives the proper measure,
At ease and unhurried, it governs below.

The Hall of Light enacts governance, yet the state’s origin harms the Dao.
Within, it nurtures the self—tranquil, empty, and primal.
Tracing back to the hidden and luminous, it inwardly illumines the body’s form.
Seal the mouth, fortify the numinous root.
The Three Lights sink into obscurity, warming and nourishing the child-pearl.
Though unseen to the eye, it is near and easily sought.

That the celestial pole receives the proper measure,
At ease and unhurried, governing below—
This speaks of the divine embryo dwelling in the central chamber,
A metaphor for the ruler abiding in the Hall of Light, like the North Star.
The qi of yin and yang and the five phases are the ministers.
When ruler and ministers govern within,
Like the North Star fixed at heaven’s center,
Then the qi of yin and yang and the five phases harmonize in accord,
The fluids of metal and water in the crucible-chamber flourish,
And the ruler may nurture the self,
Abiding in tranquility, effortlessly empty and primal,
Undergoing transformation naturally.

“Tracing back to the hidden and luminous, inwardly illumining the body’s form”:
This means that metal can conceal brightness yet also illuminate itself,
Gaining fire to amplify its radiance.
“Seal the mouth”:
The *dui* is the mouth.
Once the golden tiger’s numinous root is settled in the central chamber,
One must secure and seal the crucible’s opening,
Directing the true essence of the Three Lights inward
To nurse and nourish the child-pearl and numinous mercury—
Hence, “the Three Lights sink into obscurity.”
The Three Lights are the yang fire, yin tally, and golden embryo,
Symbolizing the sun, moon, and stars.
Externally, there are also Three Lights,
Distributed within the moving and still lines and time-marks,
Within the yin and yang tally-fires,
Transforming and taking form.
For within and without, each possesses the body of yin-yang transformation—
This cannot be exhaustively discussed.
At this subtle and wondrous stage,
Without oral transmission, it is difficult to convey in writing.

When the golden mercury is in the crucible,
Its transformations are unfathomable, beyond perception.
Yet if one employs the celestial mechanism to regulate it,
Using the pivot of the cosmic pattern,
Then the golden mercury dares not flee,
And dragon and tiger may unite in mating—
Hence, “it is near and easily sought.”
The *Yin Fu Jing* says:
“The cosmos is in your hands,
The myriad transformations arise in your body.”

**Section Twenty-One: The Yellow Center Gradually Permeates Order**
The yellow center gradually permeates order,
Moistening and suffusing the skin.
First rectify, then refine to the end;
The trunk stands firm, yet the branch may not be grasped.
The One veils and conceals it—
The world knows it not.
The *Book of Changes* says:
“The noble one, yellow at the center, permeates order,
Abides in proper position, embodies integrity—
Excellence resides within,
Flowing through the four limbs,
Manifesting in deeds—
This is the height of beauty.”
This speaks of the golden tiger in the crucible,
First receiving the external qi of yin and yang,
Gradually moistening and suffusing the skin.
Once it first receives qi, the initial sprout arises,
The branches and trunk are rectified,
And in the end, the fruit is borne.
It is a metaphor for the true mercury of golden cinnabar first sprouting buds.
The One is water.
For the water’s root is true metal within the vessel,
Securely sealed and concealed—
Ordinary people cannot know it.

**Section Twenty-Two: Supreme Virtue Acts Not**
Supreme virtue acts not,
Nor seeks through scrutiny.

Lesser virtue acts,
Its function unceasing.
When the upper aperture closes, it is called "being";
When the lower aperture closes, it is called "non-being."
Non-being serves to uphold the above,
Where the divine virtue resides.
This is the method of the two apertures,
Where the golden qi mutually requires.

The supreme virtue is water above;
The lesser virtue is fire below.
Water and fire conjoin—
This is called Qian and Kun.
Water above remains ever still,
Abiding in yin without acting,
Nor seeking through scrutiny.
Fire below moves ceaselessly,
Circulating through the twelve celestial stems,
Its function unending.

The upper closure is called "being"—inner water.
The lower closure is called "non-being"—outer fire.
Non-being serves to uphold the above,
For fire circulates the qi of the four seasons and five phases,
Nourishing and upholding the divine embryo.
Thus it is said, "Above, the divine virtue resides"—
The divine embryo of golden mercury.
As for "the method of the two apertures, where the golden qi mutually requires,"
It speaks of the two qi of water and fire, yin and yang,
Mutually sealed and requiring one another to form the divine medicine—
All else is but a deviant path.

Master Wei was enlightened by this chapter,
Profoundly clarifying the great principles of the method and the归旨 of the divine medicine.

**Chapter Twenty-Three: Knowing the White, Guarding the Black**
Know the white, guard the black,
And the numinous brightness will come of itself.
The white is the essence of metal;
The black is the foundation of water.
Water is the pivot of the Dao,
Its number named "One."
The beginning of yin and yang,
Mysteriously containing the yellow sprout.
The master of the five metals,
The river chariot of the north.
Thus lead appears black without,
Yet harbors golden splendor within.
Clad in coarse robes while holding jade,
Outwardly a madman.

The white is metal;
The black is water.

Knowing the root and function of metal and water as the foundation of the medicine,
The divine essence will naturally arise within the vessel—
Thus it is said the numinous brightness comes of itself.
White metal is born from water,
And so becomes the divine vessel.
The body of water is inexhaustible,
For the dual natures of metal and water form the pivot of the Dao.
Water’s number is One,
The origin of Heaven and Earth, yin and yang, the five phases, and the myriad things.
Water is One, fire Two, wood Three, metal Four, earth Five.
"Mysteriously containing the yellow sprout" refers to metal and water generating the yellow sprout.
The master of the five metals is the river chariot of the north.
The river chariot is water and fire,
For the qi of water and fire circulate to generate the five phases.
Thus lead appears black without yet harbors golden splendor within:
Before lead is transformed into white metal,
It lies concealed within the ore,
Outwardly black while inwardly holding golden radiance—
Like the madman clad in coarse robes while holding jade.

**Chapter Twenty-Four: Metal as the Mother of Water**
Metal is the mother of water,
The mother conceals the child in her womb.
Water is the child of metal,
The child shelters in the mother’s womb.
The perfected one is most subtle,
Now present, now absent.
Like a great abyss with flowing locks,
Now sinking, now rising.
Retreating, they disperse,
Each guarding their own domain.
Water is born from metal,
Metal is the mother of water—
This means metal generates water,
Yet in turn conceals its form within water,
Thus hiding the child in the womb.
"Water is the child of metal, the child shelters in the mother’s womb" refers to black lead transforming in quality,
Taking its place in the west as the white tiger’s metal womb.
Water contains metal and again conceals its essence within the metal womb—
True mercury is such.
"The perfected one is most subtle, each guarding their own domain" means true mercury,
Driven by the external talismanic fire within the mother’s womb,
Now sinks, now rises,
Flying and hiding without constancy,
Now present, now absent.
Yet with the response of talismans and the advance and retreat of fire,
Each guards its own boundary,
Daring not to transgress.
Master Wei was enlightened by this chapter,
Profoundly clarifying the inner images of perception,
Yet still unable to match the state of true essence’s subtle and imperceptible arising and vanishing.
How wondrous! How divine!

**Chapter Twenty-Five: The White of Gathering**

Gathering the white of its kind,
Refining it yields the vermilion.
Tempered as defense and guard,
White enfolds the steadfast core.
Square and round, a inch in span,
Blended yet mutually bound.
Born before heaven and earth,
Majestic and supremely exalted.

"Gathering the white of its kind" means that at the first stirring of movement, white metal takes precedence.
"Refining it yields the vermilion" means that in the forging, next the blazing fire completes the crimson.
"Tempered as defense and guard, white enfolds the steadfast core" describes how white metal serves as the divine chamber.
"Square and round, a inch in span, blended yet mutually bound" means the metal womb resembles the primordial chaos in form. It is crafted by dividing the upper and lower crescents, with the central chamber square and round, an inch in diameter, to house the true mercury. Once the two children unite, the seal is firm and impervious, allowing yin and yang to correspond without the slightest leak, nurturing the dragon and tiger. As the *Ancient Song* says: "When the womb’s seal is unbroken, transformation occurs in an instant."

"Born before heaven and earth, majestic and supremely exalted" means that true lead existed before the primordial chaos of heaven and earth. Lead attained unity and took form, then gradually gave rise to heaven and earth, yin and yang, the five phases, the myriad things, and all beings. Thus, lead is the parent of heaven and earth, the root and origin of yin and yang. The sage delves into the root of heaven and earth’s parents to establish the foundation of the great elixir, gathering the pure essence of yin and yang to form the substance of the returned cinnabar. This is no ordinary creation of things.

Therefore, at the outset of elixir refinement, one must take the root of heaven and earth as the root of the medicine, and the mother of yin and yang as the mother of the cinnabar. If one cannot grasp the arising of heaven and earth and yin and yang in this interval, it is not the way of the golden liquid and returned cinnabar. If one uses what is produced *after* the existence of heaven and earth and yin and yang—such as the five metals, eight minerals, plant juices, wood ash, morning frost, night dew, snow broth, ice water, green salt, white brine, or any miscellaneous substances—how could success be anything but difficult?

Let those of like mind ponder this deeply, and in time, they will awaken. Thus, a later passage says: "After ten thousand repetitions, it may be grasped in darkness; the divine and enlightened may then fashion a person." This is also found in the eighty-third chapter of the lower volume.

**Chapter Twenty-Six: The Adjoining Walls and Gates**

**Chapter Twenty-Six: The Adjoining Walls and Gates**

Walls stand beside the gates, resembling Penglai’s isles.
Encircled and sealed, the four paths wind and turn.
Guarded and secured, they bar all wickedness.
Curved chambers connect, warding against the unforeseen.
Here, primordial reflection thrives—
yet sorrow and toil find no place.
The chamber brims with spirit and qi,
none can detain it.
Those who preserve it flourish;
those who lose it perish.
In movement and stillness, rest and repose,
it ever abides with the practitioner.

When refining the Returned Cinnabar,
there are the altar, furnace, and cauldron,
upper and lower conjoined,
shaped like Penglai’s isles, open on all sides.
Within the cauldron lies the divine chamber, the golden embryo,
winding and linked;
without, the pivot and bolts secure it,
sealing all gaps to prevent the true qi from escaping.
Only then are stray thoughts stilled,
and primordial toil dispelled.
Though the defenses are firm,
and the chamber fills with spirit and qi,
one must still regulate and harmonize yin and yang,
exchanging and applying effort,
to retain and bind the true essence,
thus accomplishing transformation.
If the fire-tally is misapplied,
even with true essence within,
it will scatter and flee.
All depends on tempering water and fire,
preserving without loss—
then prosperity follows.
Thus, the true qi’s movement and stillness,
rest and repose,
ever abide with the practitioner.

**Chapter Twenty-Seven: The Methods of Testing and Concealment**

The methods of testing and concealment—
inward vision gives rise to thought.
Treading the steps of the Dipper’s lodges,
the six jia follow the days and hours.
The yin path suppresses nine and one,
confusing and disrupting the primordial womb.
Ingesting qi, the intestines rumble;
exhaling the upright, inhaling external evil.
Day and night, no outward sleep,
from dark moon to new, never ceasing.
The body grows daily weary,
distracted, as if deranged.
The hundred vessels seethe and race,
unable to settle in clarity.
Piling earth to raise altars,
morning and evening, reverent offerings.
Ghostly forms appear,
dreams stir with sighs.
The heart rejoices, the mind delights,
self-assured of long life.
Yet suddenly, death cuts short the years,
the corpse decays, the bones exposed.
Every act goes awry,
perverse and contrary, the pivot lost.
Such methods are many,
a thousand strands, ten thousand more.
Advancing and retreating, they defy the Yellow and the Old,
twisting and turning, they rebel against the Nine Capitals.

These are not the true methods of the Hidden Treasury—those #37 twisted paths that rebel against the Nine Capitals. Master Wei observes that世人 do not grasp the fundamental origin of the Great Dao/Way, instead rushing toward the crooked byways of side doors. Thus, some inwardly contemplate petty tricks, treading the steps of the demonic net, manipulating the Six Jia days and celestial stems—mere introductory steps for the ignorant. Others, when facing circumstances, #38 engage in qi-absorption, bedroom defenses, bending and stretching, grasping and sealing, holding breath and swallowing saliva. Through these, qi becomes chaotic, spirit exhausted, hun-souls wounded, po-souls wearied, leading the yang spirit to flee its palace, while yin thieves plunder the lungs and liver. This arises from internal and external mutual encroachment, the clash of yin and yang hours, the seven po wandering like dead corpses, the Three Corpses battling in the eyes, the hundred vessels seething, the Three Fields in turmoil. What was meant to ensure longevity instead harms life—how can one attain clarity and stillness?

Others externally erect altars and carve jade, sacrificing to wanton ghosts, hoping to encounter the Dao/Way and beg for extended years. This causes ghostly qi to infect essence and spirit, evil winds to rise in the heart’s chamber, sometimes manifesting in dreams, sometimes in apparitions of form and sound. They believe longevity is within reach, unaware that their fate lies in their own hands—only to hasten their demise, abandoning decayed remains. Such practices are manifold, all classified as heterodox paths.

Seeking to move yet remaining stuck, desiring speed yet slowing further, they rebel against the utmost truth, deviate from heavenly principle, falsely claim the title of "high Dao," openly defy the writings of the Yellow Emperor, obscure the true teachings, and entirely lose the essence of the Old Master’s intent. Therefore, Master Wei does not wish people to practice side doors. He urges them to #39 directly enter the true Dao/Way. Even if the various Hidden Treasury methods yield minor achievements, they ultimately cannot escape death and decay. Only the Golden Elixir of Returning Mercury, after ingestion, reverses aging into infancy, attaining the rank of True Person, sharing the eternal longevity of heaven’s position. Thus, the following text states:

Golden sand enters the five viscera,
mist scatters like wind and rain.
Steaming and permeating the four limbs,
complexion becomes joyful, lustrous, and fine.
White hair turns black,
new teeth regrow.
The old man reverts to youthful vigor,
the aged woman becomes a maiden.
Transforming form to escape worldly calamities,
they are called True Persons.

As stated in Chapter Thirty-Two of this scroll. The *Scripture of the Yellow Court* also says: "One hundred and twenty years may still be restored, but beyond this, cultivating the Dao/Way becomes truly difficult. One must await the Ninefold Transmutation and Eightfold Jade Elixir, where the radiance of sun and moon rescues the old and frail." Thus, it is clear that this method is the supreme path of ascending to heaven in broad daylight and achieving immortality.

**Chapter Twenty-Eight: The Enlightened Examine These Principles**
The enlightened examine these principles,
suddenly understanding their origin.
Diligently practicing them,
day and night without rest.
After three years of ingesting the elixir,
they lightly ascend and travel afar.
Crossing fire without burning,
entering water without getting wet.
Able to appear and disappear at will,
eternally joyful, free from sorrow.
When the Dao/Way is accomplished and virtue/power perfected,
they conceal themselves, awaiting the time.
The Great One #40 then summons them to dwell in the Central Continent #41.
When merits are fulfilled and ascension achieved,
they receive the register and chart.
Master Wei warns those who love the Dao/Way: examine and fathom these principles, and you will naturally attain clarity. Once obtained, practice diligently day and night, never slackening from beginning to end. After the elixir is completed and ingested for three years, you will lightly ascend and travel afar, unobstructed by water or fire, able to sit and vanish #42 or stand and appear. Secretly performing hidden virtues, concealing yourself to await the time, the Great One will summon you to relocate to the Central Continent. Counting the days, you will ascend, receive the register and chart.

The Great One is the overseer of elixir refinement. The Central Continent is the Divine Continent. When世人 first attain the Dao/Way, their names are engraved on golden tablets in this land #43, receiving the register and chart #44 to achieve ascension.

**Chapter Twenty-Nine: The Fire Record Is Not Falsely Composed**
The *Fire Record* is not falsely composed;
it elucidates the *Book of Changes* to clarify it.
The crescent-moon method of the crucible,
with the White Tiger as the pivot of refinement.
Mercury as the flowing pearl of the sun,
accompanied by the Azure Dragon.
Raising the east to meet the west,
hun and po naturally bind each other.
The waxing moon corresponds to the number eight of Dui,
the waning moon to the number eight of Gen.
When the essences of both phases merge,
the body of Qian and Kun is formed.
Two eights make a pound,
the Dao/Way of the *Changes* stands upright, unshaken.
A pound has three hundred eighty-four zhu,
also corresponding to the number of hexagrams and lines.
Though the fire has its record,
it must be regulated by the Dao/Way of the *Changes*,
following the hexagrams and lines,
circulating through Pi and Tai.
The crucible is shaped like an inverted moon,
the metal tiger within serves as the mechanism of the medicine.
Cinnabar mercury and the Azure Dragon,
pursued by the Vermilion Bird of Bing and Ding,
follow the time to enter the golden womb together—
hence called "raising the east to meet the west."
Hun and po refer to the eastern dragon’s hun and the western tiger’s po.
The upper and lower phases combine to form #45 a pound’s weight,
divided into three hundred eighty-four zhu,
corresponding to the two eights of a month’s cycle.
Thus, the forms of Qian and Kun are complete,
matching the number of a celestial revolution.

**Chapter Thirty: Gold Enters the Fierce Fire**
Gold enters the fierce fire,
its color unaltered, its radiance undiminished.
Since the beginning of creation,
the sun and moon have never lost their brightness,
gold has never lost its weight,
the sun and moon retain their usual forms.
Gold is originally born from the moon,
receiving the sun’s tally at the new moon.
Gold returns to its mother,
as the moon wanes, the sun envelops it.
Concealing its frame,
it sinks into the cavernous void.
Gold regains its original nature,
its majestic light rejoicing in the crucible #46.
The five phases overcome each other,
fire overcomes metal.
Yet when metal encounters fire, it can be forged into tools,
neither harming the other.
Thus, the golden womb in the crucible does not dissipate,
its golden color growing ever more luminous.
Since the establishment of the Qian and Kun crucible,
the sun and moon’s essences enter within,
mutually benefiting each other,
both retaining their brightness.
The gold’s weight remains unchanged,
the sun and moon perpetually encircle and illuminate.
Gold is originally born from the moon—
gold is yin essence, residing in the west,
hence it is said that gold is born from the moon.
From the new moon, it receives the tally of the celestial stems,
thus generating gold.

When gold returns to its mother,
the moon receives its mandate in turn,
gold reverts to water.
When the moon wanes and yang qi is wholly spent,
then gold and water—these two substances—
naturally enfold each other in their nature,
concealing their frame and sinking into the cavernous void.
The waning moon mirrors the year’s end,
the new moon mirrors the year’s beginning.

When gold and water take form,
the crucible-chamber perpetually contains harmonious qi,
and thus success is manifest—
hence it is said the crucible rejoices #47.
Joy brings harmony,
harmony brings gold and water to congeal,
and the Dao of spontaneity is complete.

**The Union of Zi and Wu Numbers, Third Stanza, Thirty-First**
The zi and wu numbers unite as three,
while wu and ji are called five.
When three and five harmonize,
the eight minerals stand as the proper norm.
Inhalation and exhalation yearn for each other #48,
longing to become husband and wife.
Yellow earth is gold’s father,
flowing pearl is water’s mother #49.
Water takes earth as its ghost—
earth subdues water, preventing its rise.
The Vermilion Bird is the essence of fire,
holding balance to adjust victory and defeat.
When water prevails, fire is extinguished,
both perishing to return to the fertile earth.
Once the three natures unite,
their original nature shares a common ancestor.

The zi water is numbered one,
the wu fire is numbered two—
together they form three.
Wu-ji earth is numbered five,
and three and five combine to make eight—
thus, when three and five harmonize,
the eight minerals stand as the proper norm.
Hence the Azure Dragon exhales to the White Tiger,
the White Tiger inhales the dragon’s essence,
their breath mutually nourishing,
longing to become husband and wife.

Yellow earth is gold’s father,
flowing pearl is water’s mother—
earth restrains #50 cinnabar mercury,
preventing its dispersal,
as when the tail of fire governs earth in the four seasons.
Gold is wholly from the Vermilion Bird’s fire spirit,
which regulates victory and defeat.
When water prevails, fire is extinguished,
and both wane and new moon come to an end,
their merit returning to earth’s virtue.
When the three natures unite,
their original nature shares a common ancestor #51—
for gold and fire emerge from the single qi of water,
being born within the primordial nine qi before heaven and earth,
capable of generating the five phases,
not merely the two substances of gold and fire.

**The Sesame Extends Longevity, Thirty-Second Stanza**
Sesame extends longevity,
returned elixir may enter the mouth.
Gold’s nature does not decay,
thus it is the treasure of the ten thousand things.
When adepts ingest it,
their lifespan is prolonged.
Earth travels through the four seasons,
guarding its boundaries and setting its rules.
Golden sand enters the five viscera,
dispersing like mist or wind and rain.
Steaming and permeating the four limbs,
the complexion becomes joyful and lustrous.
White hair all turns black,
fallen teeth regrow in their original place.
Old men regain youthful vigor,
aged women become maidens.
Transforming their form, they escape worldly calamity—
sesame is called the True Person.

Sesame #52—
if mere mortals consume it and still gain longevity,
how much more so when the golden liquid returned elixir enters the mouth?
The elixir first arises from true gold—
true gold #53, the mother of things,
serves as the foundation of the medicine,
nourishing the viscera and limbs,
enabling long vision.

Is not long life assured?
Gold’s essence never decays.
It is the ancestor of heaven and earth’s primordial qi—
as the *Daodejing* says:
“The nameless is the beginning of heaven and earth,
the named is the mother of the ten thousand things.”
Before heaven and earth, a single qi was the origin,
giving birth to the ten thousand images.
Gold is the root of water,
and thus true gold, the mother, can produce golden sand and returned elixir.

Earth travels through the four seasons—
Master Wei uses this to instruct later generations in refining and ingesting the medicine.
When this sand enters the mouth,
it marks the beginning and end of the elixir path.
Its numinous wonders are beyond measure,
like clouds, mist, wind, and rain—
rejuvenating the old and reversing aging,
transforming the myriad paths to enter the five phases,
causing teeth to regrow and hair to darken,
thus achieving long life.

**Lead Powder Cast into Fire, Thirty-Third Stanza**
When lead powder is cast into fire,
its color is ruined and it reverts to lead.
When ice and snow meet warm broth,
they dissolve and become the Great Mystery.
Gold takes cinnabar as its master,
receiving harmony from mercury.
Transformation arises from its authenticity,
beginning and end naturally follow one another.
If you wish to become an immortal through ingestion,
you must use substances of the same kind.
Plant millet to grow millet,
hatch chickens with their own eggs #54.
Assisting nature with its own kind,
things are easily shaped and refined.
Can fish eyes be considered pearls?
Can thistles and thorns become fine boxes?
Only those of the same kind follow one another—
deviant methods do not produce treasures.

Thus, swallows and sparrows do not give birth to phoenixes,
foxes and hares do not nurse horses.
Water does not flow upward in flames,
fire does not moisten downward.

Lead white is refined from black lead; when cast into fire, it reverts to lead. Snow and frost form from water qi; when warmed by broth, they return to water. Gold sand and mercury are of one body—gold serves as the mother, giving birth to cinnabar and mercury. Thus it is said: plant millet to grow millet, hatch chickens with their own eggs. Once they receive sufficient qi, they become millet and chickens. This is the Dao of kind begetting kind, of beginning and end naturally following one another.

To use metals, minerals, herbs, frost, dew, ice, snow, salt, or brine would be a grievous error—this has been thoroughly explained in the annotations above. In the twenty-fifth chapter of this scroll, the root of Heaven and Earth is taken as the root of the elixir, and true gold mother as the mother of the elixir. Now it produces yin-yang essence, golden cinnabar, and numinous mercury as the medicine of immortality—is this not so?

Thus it is said: swallows and sparrows do not give birth to phoenixes, foxes and hares do not nurse horses. Fire’s nature is to flame upward—it cannot be made to moisten downward. Water’s nature is to moisten downward—it cannot be made to flame upward. Since this is the root of their natural natures, by analogy, the gold mother producing golden cinnabar is self-evident.

**The World Abounds with Scholars (Chapter Thirty-Four)**

The world abounds with scholars,
men of lofty skill and rare talent.
Yet by chance they meet no opportunity,
wasting fire and squandering wealth.
They cling to texts and follow words,
recklessly imposing their own ideas.
The thread of origin loses its reason,
measure and grasp slip from their hold.

Refining malachite and chalcanthite, mica and reputed magnetite,
sulphur burning in camphorwood, mud and mercury smelted in flight.
Bellows forge the five-stone bronze, using it as the pivot’s aid.
Yet their natures differ in kind—how could they dwell as one body?
A thousand attempts must fail ten thousand times; seeking transmutation, one becomes a fool.
Fortune never favors them—only the sage truly knows.
From youth to white-haired age, midway they breed doubt,
abandoning the Dao to cling to deluded paths, stepping from the straight into crooked byways.
Peering through a tube, their vision is not broad—how can they fathom what lies ahead?

Master Wei says: The world teems with broadly learned, erudite scholars who fix their minds on the realm of the Dao, fond of fiery pursuit of the Mystery. By chance, they fail to meet an enlightened teacher, relying only on texts and secret formulas, recklessly imposing their own ideas. They waste their wealth, refining miscellaneous medicines, hoping for transcendence and eternal life. Through the years to hoary age, they persist without turning back, stubbornly clinging to their narrow view, straying into false paths. A thousand attempts, ten thousand failures—how can they gauge the future? Their natures differ in kind; this was already explained in the annotation above.

**Of the Utmost Sages (Chapter Thirty-Five)**

Of the utmost sages, none surpass Fuxi,
who first drew the Eight Trigrams, modeling Heaven and Earth.
King Wen, imperial ancestor, structured the hexagrams and composed their judgments.
Confucius, the near-sage hero, supplemented them with the *Ten Wings*.
These three lords were Heaven’s chosen, rising in succession to govern their times.
Though their ranks differ in steps, their merits and virtues do not diverge.
Their creations followed precedent, weighing and measuring with meticulous care.
What has form is easily reckoned; what lacks omen is hard to plan.
Their deeds became models for all, their works established the *Odes* and *Documents*.
Devoid of prior knowledge, they awakened through their teachers.
Bright as if parting the curtains, they opened their eyes to ascend the high terrace.

Master Wei extols Fuxi, King Wen, and Confucius—the three sages Heaven-endowed with divine intelligence, each possessing luminous virtue. In expounding the *Dao* of the *Yijing*, they penetrated the essence of Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things. In editing the *Odes* and *Documents*, they distilled the teachings of rulers, ministers, and the multitudes. They further established hexagram images, analyzed weights and measures, and calculated the cycles of celestial bodies, exhausting the numbers of the *Great Expansion*.
Though Heaven and Earth are vast, they cannot seal the mechanisms of closure and openness.
Though yin and yang are utterly void, they conceal the reckoning of movement and stillness.
Thus the sages drew upon them to devise the great Dao, using qian and kun to symbolize the cauldron and chamber, causing them to embrace the One qi and govern the ten thousand spirits, threading yin and yang through the hours, enabling the six voids to generate all beings.
What has form is easily reckoned—Heaven and Earth.
What lacks omen is hard to plan—yin and yang.
Without the three sages’ exposition of the *Yijing*, by what path would water and fire be deployed?
Without the legacy of their writings for ten thousand generations, by what gate would dragon and tiger be harnessed?
Thus it is said: Devoid of prior knowledge, they awakened through this.
As if parting the curtains, clarity dawned.
As if ascending the high terrace, nothing remained beyond their ken.
This metaphor illustrates the sages’ Dao: the higher one looks, the loftier it becomes; the deeper one delves, the more impenetrable it grows.
Through the *Dao* of the *Yijing*, the *Fire Records* are further illuminated—this will be briefly explained below.

**The Fire Records’ Six Hundred Chapters (Chapter Thirty-Six)**

The *Fire Records* comprise six hundred chapters, their aims not differing in essence.
Their texts expound with solemn care, yet the world does not ponder deeply.
Tracing their source and flow, the hidden and manifest originally dwell as one.
I speak in confidence to the worthy—how dare I treat this lightly in writing?
If I were to seal my tongue and wither, cutting off the Dao, I would incur guilt and punishment.
Yet to express my thoughts on bamboo and silk, I fear revealing Heaven’s tally.
Hesitant, I sigh in lament, gazing up and down, appending this folly.
Refinement and cooling follow method and measure—I cannot bear to lay them all bare.
I shall briefly outline their guiding principles; their branches and twigs will be seen in due course.

**Six Hundred Chapters (Continued)**

The *Fire Records*’ six hundred chapters represent the grand reckoning of fire’s cyclical movement under the stars, each dawn and dusk governed by a hexagram’s charge. Though termed six hundred chapters, their sequence remains uniform—thus the year aligns with the month, the month with the day, the day with the hour. Master Wei dared neither seal his tongue to obscure the great Dao nor commit it openly to bamboo and silk, lest he reveal Heaven’s mechanism. Hesitant and sighing, he feared his words might fail posterity. Thus, he briefly sketched their guiding principles, hinting at their branches, while reserving finer details for oral transmission.

**Chapter Thirty-Seven: Using Metal as a Dike**

Use metal as a dike, and water enters in leisurely flow.
Metal’s reckoning is fifteen; water’s count matches it.
Before the furnace, fix the weights—water exceeds by five parts.
When these two are deemed true, metal’s weight returns to its origin.
The third does not enter; fire and the other two accompany it.
The three substances unite, their transformations wondrous as spirits.
Beneath lies the qi of Grand Yang, steaming in but a moment.
First it liquefies, then congeals—this is called the Yellow Chariot.
As years and months near their end, nature is undone, lifespan harmed.
The body becomes ash and dust, its form like dust on a bright window.

The Metal Mother resides in the central palace, serving as a dike for quicksilver. Thus, metal and water flow in harmony, their natures entwined. Metal and water follow the celestial stems, each receiving half the qi, together making a full catty’s measure. Having produced golden cinnabar, the mother remains undiminished—hence it is said, “metal’s weight returns to its origin.” The third that does not enter is true earth. Metal, fire, and wood—these three substances, driven by water and fire through the celestial stems, enter the vessel together. There, the three natures converge, the two flavors bind, and their transformations become wondrous as spirits.

The Metal Mother, steamed by the essence and qi of Grand Yang, first exudes liquid, then solidifies—this is named the Yellow Chariot. Through the cycles of stars, yin and yang, and the Five Phases, their functions are tested and interwoven. Retreating to conceal their forms, all merit returns to the central palace. The Yellow Emperor embodies the power of earth—thus it is said, “nature is undone, lifespan harmed.” Returning to earth’s power, they transform into earth, their spirit and essence resembling dust on a bright window.

**Chapter Thirty-Eight: Pounding, Refining, and Combining**

Pound and refine them together, then hold them to enter the Crimson Gate.
Seal their junctures firmly, ensuring perfection and strength.
Blazing fire rises from below, its roar ceaseless day and night.
Begin with civil fire, refine it; end with martial fire, array it.
Observe with utmost care, scrutinizing the balance of cold and warmth.
Cycle through the twelve nodes; when each ends, renew your vigilance.
When qi wanes and life nears its end, rest to revive the hun and po.
The color shifts to purple, resplendent—returned cinnabar is formed.
Knead it into a single pellet; the spatula’s touch is most divine.

Pound and refine the elixir’s foundation, fortifying and sealing it, then place it within the crucible—this is called the Crimson Gate. Water flows downward, fire blazes upward; waxing and waning advance and retreat, ascending and descending by day and night. Civil fire begins at midnight, martial fire follows until noon. From noon, the yin tally arises, continuing to midnight. Their movements alternate between closure and opening, regulated by cold and warmth. When the twelve nodes conclude, the cycle renews. Once the fire’s course is complete, the hun and po transform their forms. Turning to purple gold, resplendent cinnabar is achieved. Ingesting a single grain, the spatula’s touch becomes divine. The marvel of this work defies full description.

---

**Chapter Thirty-Nine: Calculating the Numbers of the Five Phases**

Calculate the numbers of the Five Phases—they are concise, not cumbersome.
Raise water to strike fire, and its light is suddenly extinguished.
Sun and moon press close, ever between waxing and waning.
When water prevails, Kan encroaches on yang; when fire weakens, Li’s day darkens.
Yin and yang consume each other, their intercourse the Dao’s natural course.

The Five Phases are the qi of emptiness and nothingness, elusive and hard to name. If measured by the total reckoning of Heaven and Earth, their workings elude capture, yet within the crucible, the Five Phases bind themselves. Yin and yang mate, fire rises as water recedes, water excites fire’s decline. The sun’s essence stirs at dawn’s waning, the moon’s po concludes at dusk’s end. Male and female alternate, cinnabar and mercury engender one another. By Heaven and Earth’s nature, the Dao of the elixir is revealed.

---

**Chapter Forty: Names Define Essence**

Names define essence; graphs express the nature of words.
When metal returns to its original nature, it is called Returned Cinnabar.
I dare not speak falsely, emulating the sages’ texts.
Ancient records praise Dragon and Tiger; the Yellow Emperor extolled Golden Flower.
Huainan refined Autumn Stone; Wang Yang added Yellow Sprout.
The worthy may uphold and practice this; the unworthy must not partake.
The Dao of past and present remains one—face-to-face, we speak of what is planned.
Scholars, redouble your efforts, lingering in deep reflection.
The essential words are plainly revealed, shining bright—they do not deceive me.

Metal is essence; water is nature. Since metal gives birth to quicksilver, essence returns to nature. Moreover, metal is born of water, making water the mother of metal. Water, in turn, is born of metal, so metal becomes the mother of water—hence the name Returned Cinnabar. As stated earlier, “the mother conceals the child’s embryo, the child shelters the mother’s womb.” In the twenty-fourth chapter of this scroll, it is said...

Yet the Master Wei’s confusion bequeathed a legacy of emptiness and deceit, as he invoked the imagery of the *Book of Changes* and the *Ancient Dragon-Tiger Classic* to expound his teachings, further extolling the Yellow Emperor, Huainan, Wang Yang, and the Perfected Sages—all of whom could uphold and practice this Way. The path of past and present shares a single gateway, unattainable to the unworthy. Thus, I urge later scholars to ponder deeply, for the essential words are plainly revealed, shining bright—they do not deceive me.

*The Unitary Meaning of the* *Zhouyi Cantong Qi*, *Divided into Chapters* – Scroll the Middle
Commentary by Peng Xiao of Feihe Mountain, Perfected One of True Unity, Gentleman for Court Audience, Acting Minister of the Bureau of Sacrifices, Bestowed Purple Gold Fish Bag

Chapter Forty-One: The Firmness of Qian and Softness of Kun
The firmness of Qian and the softness of Kun #1 unite in mutual embrace.

The yang bestows and the yin receives; the male and female depend on each other.
Through this, creation and transformation unfold, and essence and qi expand.
Kan and Li crown the head, their radiance spreading far and wide.
The profound and obscure #2 are difficult to fathom, impossible to depict in diagrams.
The sage measures and weighs, arranging them in order without foundation #3.
The four merge into chaos, directly entering the void of non-being.
The sixty hexagrams cycle through, stretched out to form a chariot.
The dragon-horse is harnessed, and the enlightened ruler steers the times.
When harmony prevails, all follow; the path is level and not crooked.
Crooked ways are perilous and obstructed, toppling and endangering the state.
The firmness of Qian and the softness of Kun unite in mutual embrace.

In refining the golden liquid and returning elixir, first establish the Qian-Kun cauldron of *jiji* ("already accomplished"),
then cause yin and yang to merge essence and qi within it.
Next, circulate the water and fire of Kan and Li, then unite the sun and moon, dragon and tiger.
Thus, radiance arises within the cauldron, its profound obscurity beyond scrutiny.
This truly stems from measuring and weighing the sagely patterns, thoroughly investigating the mother of the medicine,
enabling Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li to blend and correspond.
Descending and ascending #4 through the six voids, spreading and unfolding the five qi,
following the sixty hexagrams, traversing the twelve celestial stems,
arranged as a chariot to welcome the dragon-horse.
Within, the Golden Mother of the Central Palace, like a ruler governing the state and steering the times,
employs harmonious qi to follow, entrusting non-action to achieve great compliance.
Thus, the path is level and not sloped, with no going that does not return.
If, however, the fire is mismanaged or the timing misjudged,
the path becomes perilous and obstructed, and the state is seen to topple,
causing the Golden Consort of the divine chamber to lose her foundation for nurturing and producing.

Now, the essentials of the golden elixir lie entirely in the two words: lead and fire.
Lead and fire are water and fire, the ancestral source of return and reversal.
The remaining five phases and qi cycles all serve as auxiliaries to achieve success.
The Golden Consort is the mother.

**Chapter Forty-Two: The Noble One Dwells in His Chamber**
When the noble one dwells in his chamber and utters good words, they resonate even a thousand *li* away.
This refers to the lord of ten thousand chariots, dwelling in the nine-fold chamber,
issuing decrees and commands #5 in accord with the rhythms of yin and yang.
Concealing the vessel and awaiting the time #6, do not violate the hexagram’s month.
*Tun* uses *zi* and *shen*; *Meng* employs #7 *yin* and *xu*.
The remaining sixty hexagrams each have their own days.
The *Yi* states: "When the noble one dwells in his chamber and utters good words, they resonate even a thousand *li* away."
This illustrates the Golden Elder dwelling in the divine chamber, like a ruler enthroned above the nine-fold palace.
Whenever circulating the water and fire of dawn and dusk, it is like issuing decrees and commands,
desiring that all qi find their proper place.
Yet one must remain tranquil and non-active, concealing the vessel and awaiting the time,
following the line texts, adhering to the clepsydra’s marks, and examining each in turn.
The *Tun* and *Meng* symbols of dawn and dusk signify that the sixty hexagrams correspond to a month’s cycle,
with day and night each receiving one hexagram, cycling endlessly.
*Yin* and *shen* are the positions where yin and yang begin and end.

**Chapter Forty-Three: Briefly Setting Forth the Two Images**
Briefly setting forth the two images, yet unable to exhaust their depths.

Establishing principles and enacting punishments, virtue is bestowed with benevolence.
Those who defy them meet misfortune; those who follow them meet fortune.
In accordance with the calendar’s decrees, one must be sincere, focused, and precise.
Carefully observe the celestial stems and branches, scrutinizing the waxing and waning.
Even the slightest deviation brings regret and harm.
Briefly setting forth the two images refers to water and fire, yin and yang.
From *zi* to *si* belongs to spring and summer, the phase of fire’s movement and generation.
Within the vessel, it harmonizes to warm and nourish the spirit-essence,
thus symbolizing the bestowal of benevolent virtue.
From *wu* to *hai* belongs to autumn and winter, the phase of stern and withering forces.
Descending into the embryo, it congeals and unites the numinous mercury,
thus symbolizing the establishment of penal statutes.
Master Wei enables later generations to understand:
the movements of the sun and moon, the measured division of yin and yang’s rise and decline,
following the hexagrams and lines, aligning with cold and heat.
He imparts warnings of single-minded diligence,
monitoring the ebb and flow, ensuring that
regret and harm do not arise within the crucible,
nor thieves stir within the symbolic process.
Then the cinnabar essence descends as qi,
white mercury takes form,
and the golden liquid’s return to elixir is achieved in no time.

**Chapter Forty-Four: The Two Solstices Alter Their Measures**
The two solstices alter their measures, diverging and twisting in complexity.

Amid deep winter, scorching heat arises; in midsummer, frost and snow descend.
The two equinoxes deviate, misaligned by even a moment’s measure.
Winds and rains fall out of season, floods and droughts contend in turn.
Locusts surge like boiling waters, strange omens proliferate on all sides.
Heaven displays its portents: mountains collapse, the earth splits open.
The filial son’s concentrated mind moves the August Ultimate.
What issues from his own mouth spreads near and far, flowing even to distant lands.
Some bring calamity, some summon fortune;
some usher in great peace, some provoke war and upheaval.
These four outcomes arise from the heart’s depths.

The summer solstice, winter solstice, spring equinox, and autumn equinox—
these four correspond to *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you* within the twelve earthly branches,
marking the boundaries of the four seasons.
Moreover, the virtue of earth traverses the ends of the four seasons,
giving rise to the forms of dragon and tiger, metal and wood.
Not merely a single phase within the four seasons,
it further divides the twelve earthly branches into twenty-four qi
and seventy-two seasonal indicators, mirroring the yearly qi-count.

Should the finest hairs or slightest moments of the clepsydra fall out of step,
the sun and moon lose their measure by inches and feet.

Should slight deviations skew the balance, day and night grow unequal;
when the yang fire exceeds its measure, drought and flood fall out of harmony,
and midwinter transforms into scorching heat;
when the yin tally loses its rhythm, cold and warmth encroach upon each other,
and midsummer reverts to thick frost.
In the metal palace, cinnabar and mercury fail to sprout—
within the crucible, worms and moths arise instead.
On a grand scale, mountains collapse and earth splits asunder,
while the metal tiger and wood dragon seethe and surge;
on a minor scale, violent rains and whirling winds arise,
as the Kan man and Li woman flee in chaos.
The metal tiger and wood dragon are the ethereal souls of west and east;
the Kan man and Li woman are the husband and wife of north and south.
When filial offspring scatter, the true mercury within the womb,
overheated by misjudged fire-timing, takes flight without restraint,
until at the mouth of the Supreme Polarity crucible,
it bursts forth into distant realms.
Whether fortune or misfortune, rise or fall—
these four outcomes and the transformations above
all stem from the heart’s depths of those who tend the fire.
If one can align with the celestial mechanism, weigh the sun and moon,
attend with meticulous care to harmonize the balance,
and move the diagram with utmost sincerity—

Summon harmonious qi within the crucible to produce the essence of Qian,
and enable the true sovereign to reside in the womb, giving birth to the purity of Kun—
this is called "true mercury."

**Chapter Forty-Five: Constancy in Movement and Stillness**
Movement and stillness follow constancy, adhering to their guiding line.
The four seasons proceed in due order, aligning with the qi’s flow.
Hard and soft are distinctly divided, never encroaching upon each other.
The five phases hold their boundaries, neither recklessly expanding nor contracting.
The *Yi* circulates in ceaseless flux, bending and stretching in endless return.

In all operations of water and fire, movement and stillness must accord with the seasons,
so that the two qi of dragon and tiger mutually attend,
mother and child cherish their bond,
the five phases guard their domains,
and the four seasons cycle without cease.
When fullness and contraction suffer no loss,
and reversal and return know no error,
then one may witness the fruition of the work in a single day.

**Chapter Forty-Six: Between the Dark and New Moons**
Between the dark and new moons, the tally moves in accord.
Kun and Meng stir in unison, as the female and male follow one another.
Nourishing fluids moisten and enrich, fostering transformation and flow.
The numinous brightness of Heaven and Earth cannot be measured.
Employ them to secure the body, and hidden arts may be mastered.

Beginning in the northeast, the region of Jidu and Dou,
one may rotate rightward, as the wheel spews forth its sprouts.
In the hidden depths, images appear, and the light of essence scatters abroad.

Between the dark and new moons lies the juncture where metal and water tally,
the interval after Gen and before Yin.
As the yang tally retreats, metal and water share a common origin,
thus the primordial chaos aligns, the female and male unite,
and flowing qi moistens and nourishes, infusing the mother’s womb.
The numinous transformations thus born cannot be measured.
Yet one may secure the body and employ them,
concealing substance and hiding form,
submerging the body in the hidden depths,
until the light of essence gradually emerges.
Turning rightward from the northeast,
this marks the renewal at the new moon,
arising from Jidu and Dou,
rotating toward the western position,
as the wheel spews forth its sprouts,
and the mind begins to stir with the desire to leap forth.
Though still in the time of hidden yin,
it prepares to restore its former fullness.
Thus, in the northeast, the region of Gen,
it follows the position of generation and completion,
once more stirring the hidden dragon.

This analogy describes the tally’s passage through Xu and Hai,
when within the crucible, metal and water,
having passed through the dark and new moons,
draw near to the Zi tally’s arising.
The Gen position is not far from Yin,
hence it is said: "the wheel spews forth its sprouts."
When the metal mother meets the dark and new moons,
metal and water flow smoothly,
and at the month’s dawn, upon encountering the Zi tally’s single yang fire,
metal, meeting fire, shines anew with doubled brightness.
Thus, rotating leftward, it spews forth sprouts,
gradually forming the dragon’s body.
Hence the following text speaks of gradual decline and transformation,
ultimately returning to its origin.

**Chapter Forty-Seven: Above Mao and Bi**
Above Mao and Bi, Zhen emerges as the standard.
Yang qi begins its inception, as the first nine is the hidden dragon.
Yang is established in threes, yin penetrates in eights.
Thus, on the third day, Zhen moves; on the eighth day, Dui proceeds.
The second nine appears as the dragon, harmonious and luminous.
When the virtues of three and five are perfected, the Qian body is complete.
The third nine, vigilant at dusk, suffers the loss of the divine tally.
Decline and transformation proceed gradually, ultimately returning to the origin.
Xun continues the lineage, firmly securing and maintaining it.
The fourth nine may leap, but retreat risks peril.
Gen governs cessation and advance, forbidding transgression of the time.
On the twenty-third day, one guards the crescent phase.
The fifth nine is the flying dragon, rejoicing in its celestial position.
The sixth five, Kun’s reception, binds and completes the beginning and end.
[ ] nourishes the many offspring, becoming the mother of all kinds.
The ninth above is the dragon in excess, battling virtue in the wilds.
Using the nine, it soars lightly, serving as the Dao’s compass.
When the yang numbers are exhausted, exhaustion gives way to renewal.
Extending feeling to unite with nature, they turn and join together.

Using the nine, it soars lightly, serving as the Dao’s compass.
When the yang numbers are exhausted, exhaustion gives way to renewal.
Extending feeling to unite with nature, they turn and join together.

At the culmination of Xu and Bi,
Zhen emerges as the expeditionary force—
this refers to the moon’s first appearance above Xu and Bi in the west,
advancing with the yang fire.
By the hours of Zi and Chou, it begins the circulation of qi in five-day cycles,
from which a single yang line is reborn,
and the qi of Zhen first stirs,
the inception of generation within the crucible.
Thus yang qi gradually arises.
After three times five, totaling fifteen days,
pure Qian is complete, and the Dragon’s form is perfected.

Yang is established through three:
for three days the fire moves, and the yang qi first spreads within the crucible—
hence it is said that on the third day Zhen stirs.
Yin flows through eight:
after two pentads, two yang lines are born,
and by the eighth day,
Dui metal comes into use.
Metal and water qi balance, marking the first quarter—
metal and water intermingle,
so it is said that on the eighth day Dui moves.

The second nine, "the dragon appears,"
initially level and luminous—
this refers to the moon at first quarter, its form half-complete,
an analogy for the crucible’s metal and water,
receiving the talismans of Yin and Mao,
yin and yang each occupying half.
The perfection of the three fives—
this refers to the third nine, Qian unceasing,
advancing to Chen and Si,
precisely three pentads, totaling fifteen days.
Three lines become pure yang,
and the body of Qian is perfected.
Thereafter yin and yang divide,
hence it is said that "sformation proceeds gradually, ultimately returning to the origin,"
completing the cycle anew.

Xun continues the yin lineage;
the fourth nine may leap, but retreat risks peril—
as the yang line retreats and transforms into one line,
Xun thus receives and carries the yin talisman.
Moving for five days above Wu and Wei,
the yielding line gradually advances,
yin qi begins to regenerate,
enveloping and securing the yang essence,
daring not move or flee.
After four pentads are fulfilled,
two yin lines are born.
Gen moves through five pentads,
the talisman reaching Shen and You,
encountering the last quarter on the twenty-third day—
metal and water balance once more.

The fifth nine, "the flying dragon,"
rejoices in its celestial position—
this refers to the sixth pentad, thirty days,
Kun moving the yin talisman to Xu and Hai,
where the qi of Qian and Kun are both complete.
Dragon and tiger, yin and yang,
the numbers of the myriad things revolve—
hence it is said that the fifth nine rejoices.

The sixth five, Kun’s reception,
binds and completes the beginning and end.
[ ] nourishes the many offspring, becoming the mother of all kinds—
this refers to Kun first transforming one line into yang to form Zhen,
becoming Qian’s eldest son;
proceeding to three lines,
all become pure yang to form Qian.
At the yang’s extremity, yin is born,
returning to Qian’s body,
transforming one line into yin to form Xun,
becoming Kun’s eldest daughter;
proceeding to three lines,
all become pure yin to form Kun.
From beginning to end, emergence and submergence,
all arise from Kun’s body nurturing the myriad things,
ever the mother of all kinds.
The many offspring are the many hexagrams.
Thus the sixth five, Kun’s reception,
binds and completes the cyclical elixir’s beginning and end,
serving as the Dao’s compass.

"Using the nine, it soars lightly"—
this refers to the excess reaching its limit and yielding its position,
for the yang numbers are exhausted,
then turning to join together.

Following the Jade Armillary, Chapter Forty-Eight
Following the jade armillary,
ascending and descending, rising and falling.
Circulating through the six lines,
difficult to perceive.
Thus it has no fixed position,
serving as the *Yijing*’s ancestral source.
The preceding text speaks of Qian and Kun as the Dao’s compass—
to follow the principles of yin and yang,
one must trace the Dipper’s movement.
Transformation is complete within the six lines,
circulating without fixed position—
this is the ancestral source of the *Yijing*’s Way.
It is an analogy for Kan and Li moving qi within the crucible,
circulating through the six voids within the image,
eluding perception,
mysteriously and subtly arising—
this is the ancestral source of the medicine.

First Dawn as *Fu*, Chapter Forty-Nine
At first dawn, *Fu*—
yang qi begins to flow.
Entering and exiting without haste,
establishing the marker of subtle firmness.
Yellow Bell establishes Zi,
the omen thus manifest.
Disseminating gentle warmth,
the common people find constancy.

At First Dawn as *Fu*—
five yin, one yang:
yin qi reaches its extreme,
yang qi revives.
This speaks of the six yielding lines in the lower body,
where the first transforms into a firm line—
the omen of yang’s arising.
Thus, the yang fire begins at the onset of Zi.

Yang qi first flows,
resonating with Yellow Bell.
Within the crucible, it receives the subtle yang qi,
laying the foundation for cinnabar and mercury.
Five yin, one yang—
with yang as the master,
qi spreads and circulates,
reaching everywhere without obstruction.
This is what is meant by "entering and exiting without haste."

The *Yijing* says:
*Fu* is the return of the Way,
the revelation of Heaven and Earth’s heart.
It is an analogy for the crucible of Heaven and Earth,
where the generation of the ten thousand things begins here,
corresponding to the eleventh month, Zi,
the time to advance the yang fire.

Before the Crucible, Applying the Kindling, Chapter Fifty
*Lin*—
before the crucible, applying the kindling,
the path opens, the light aligns.
Radiance gradually advances,
day by day, it grows longer.
Great Frame in Chou:
the structure takes form, high and low.

The *Lin* hexagram has four yin and two yang,
an analogy for applying the Chou fire.
Yang’s power gradually advances,
illuminating the crucible.
After the winter solstice,
the days lengthen,
yang qi spreads,
giving rise to the spirit’s essence.

Resonating with Great Frame,
the structure takes form, high and low—
metal and water respond to qi,
gradually congealing flowing pearls above and below.
This corresponds to the twelfth month, Chou,
the time to advance the yang fire.

Looking Up to Complete *Tai*, Chapter Fifty-One
Looking up to complete *Tai*—
firm and yielding flourish together,
yin and yang unite.
The small departs, the great arrives.
Converging in Yin,
moving in accord with the season.

The *Tai* hexagram has three yin and three yang,
yin and yang qi balance,
husband and wife unite.
Gradually, the essence of dragon and tiger appears,
gold and mercury flourish.
Thus it is said: "The small departs, the great arrives."

The *Yijing* says:
No level ground is without slope,
no going forth is without return.
This is the Way of yin and yang’s succession,
corresponding to the first month, Yin,
the time to advance the yang fire.

Progressing Through *Dazhuang*, Chapter Fifty-Two
Progressing through *Dazhuang*—
flanking the gate of Mao.

The Elm Pods Fall, Returning to Their Root
Elm pods fall and scatter,
returning to their root.
Punishment and virtue bear each other,
day and night begin their division.

The *Dazhuang* hexagram has two yin and four yang,
speaking of mid-spring when yang qi, though flourishing,
still harbors yin within yang.
Yin’s path is about to depart,
so the elm pods follow yin and fall.

"Punishment and virtue bear each other" refers to the second and eighth months,
the times when yin and yang divide their positions.
Yang is virtue, and by virtue all things live;
yin is punishment, and by punishment all things die.
Thus in the second month, yang contains yin,
and yin qi encroaches upon things,
so that in mid-spring the elm pods fall—
an image of golden sand following the remnant yin qi,
moving and settling within the womb,
hence it is called "returning to the root."
In the eighth month, yin contains yang,
and yang qi stirs to life,
so that in mid-autumn shepherd’s purse and wheat sprout anew—
an image of metal and water following the remnant yang qi,
filling the chamber with nourishing essence,
hence it is called "renewed flourishing."
The following section on the *Guan* hexagram speaks of this.
At the juncture where punishment and virtue bear each other,
the time when yin and yang balance,
it corresponds to the second month, Mao,
the time to restrain the tally.

Resolving Yin to Retreat, Chapter Fifty-Three
Resolving yin to retreat,
yang ascends and advances.
Washing and cleansing the wings,
shaking off the dust of the old roost.

The *Guai* hexagram has one yin and five yang,
yang ascends and yin retreats.
Yang qi is already abundant,
yet within the crucible remains a trace of yin qi,
swept away by the fire of Chen.
Golden sand is thus washed and cleansed of its wings,
shaking off the dust of the old roost.
It corresponds to the third month, Chen,
the time to advance the yang fire.

Vigorous Strength and Radiant Clarity, Chapter Fifty-Four
Vigorous in strength and radiant in clarity,
its brilliance spreads to the four neighbors.
Yang culminates in Si,
balanced and interacting within.

The *Yijing* says: "Great indeed is the primal power of *Qian*!"
Firm, strong, centered, and upright,
pure and refined essence.
The primal power of *Qian* is the source from which all things draw their beginning.
From the winter solstice, when the first yang is born,
to the time of pure yang,
clouds drift and rain falls,
all things take form.
This is likened to the crucible’s receipt of the tally from the eleventh month to the fourth,
when the six lines transform into pure *Qian*,
nurturing the myriad forms to completion.
Thus the golden embryo meets the fire of true yang,
and metal, refined by fire, becomes a vessel,
shining with ever-increasing brilliance,
spreading its light to the four neighbors,
filling the crucible chamber.
It corresponds to the fourth month, Si,
the time to advance the yang fire.

"Balanced and interacting within" refers to yang at its peak giving rise to yin,
speaking of the following section where yin encroaches upon yang’s virtue.

The Beginning of Sequence in *Gou*, Chapter Fifty-Five
The beginning of sequence in *Gou*—
treading frost comes first.
The cold spring at the well’s bottom,
Wu is *Ruibin*.
The guest submits to yin,
yin becomes the host.

The *Yijing* says: "*Gou* means encounter."
Five yang and one yin,
yin arises and yang retreats,
yin and yang divide their boundaries,
dragon and tiger mate,
hence they encounter.
It also says: "Bound to the golden restraint, steadfast and auspicious."
This speaks of the first yin leading the change,
bound to what follows,
until extreme yin is reached.
"Treading frost comes first" means the first yin arises,
forging the path to extreme yin;
once there is a trace of frost,
the lines proceed to solid ice.

"The cold spring at the well’s bottom" refers to five yang below and one yin,
yin qi not yet spread and stretched.
Though the five yang are many,
yin is now taking charge.
Among the six lines of the hexagram,
five yin and one yang take yang as the host;
five yang and one yin take yin as the host.
The many take the few as their host,
hence it is said that yin is the host.
This is likened to the golden mother within the crucible,
which is originally the essence of supreme yin water.
At first receiving the subtle sign of yin qi,
the metal-water gains a slight release of its nature,
yet still foresees the coming of solid ice and extreme yin.
It corresponds to the fifth month, Wu,
the time to retreat the yin tally.

Withdrawing from the World and Abandoning Position, Chapter Fifty-Six
Withdrawing from the world and abandoning position,
gathering in one’s essence.
Embracing virtue and awaiting the season,
its handle lingers in darkness and obscurity.

The *Dun* hexagram has four yang and two yin,
yin qi gradually flourishing,
yang qi gradually waning.
This speaks of yang relinquishing its position,
gathering in its true essence,
awaiting what is to come.
The remnant yang dwells in yin,
gradually nearing extinction,
hence its handle lingers in darkness and obscurity.
The *Yijing* says: "No thing can forever flee,"
hence one awaits the season.
This is likened to the true essence of the red dragon within the crucible,
subjected to yin’s dominion,
gradually uniting with metal-water,
about to give rise to the maiden mercury.
Thus it gathers in its true essence,
entrusting itself to the transformations of yin and yang.
It corresponds to the sixth month, Wei,
the time to retreat the yin tally.

Obstruction and Blockage, Chapter Fifty-Seven
Obstruction and blockage,
what sprouts does not grow.
Yin extends and yang yields,
yang’s name and form vanish.

The *Pi* hexagram has three yang and three yin,
heaven and earth both at rest,
yin and yang do not interact,
the myriad things do not sprout.
The golden mother within the central palace,
coiling and uncoiling in tranquil ease.
It corresponds to the seventh month, Shen,
the time to retreat the yin tally.

Observing Its Measure, Chapter Fifty-Eight
Observing its measure,
examining the nature of mid-autumn.
Entrusting the nurturing of the tender and young,
the old and withered flourish anew.
Shepherd’s purse and wheat sprout,
burgeoning forth from beneath the cover.

The *Guan* hexagram has two yang and four yin,
yin qi already flourishing,
comparable to the nature of mid-autumn.
This speaks of metal within the crucible,
receiving yin qi and uniting with water,
transforming and giving rise to the maiden mercury.
Yet yin qi, though in command,
still leaves a remnant of harmonious yang within the crucible,
so that in mid-autumn shepherd’s purse and wheat sprout anew,
hence it is said that the old and withered flourish again.
"Burgeoning forth" means growing everywhere.
This is likened to metal-water receiving the yin tally in mid-autumn,
nurturing and rearing the numinous mercury,
filling the womb.
The second and eighth months,
when yin and yang’s punishment and virtue bear each other,
were already explained in the annotation to the *Dazhuang* hexagram above.
It corresponds to the eighth month, You,
the time to restrain the tally.

Peeling Away and Decaying the Body, Chapter Fifty-Nine
Peeling away and decaying the body,
dissolving and vanishing its form.
Transformative qi is exhausted,
the utmost spirit is lost.

The *Yijing* says: "*Bo* means to peel."

One yang amidst five yins—yin flourishes while yang wanes,
the soft encroaches until the hard is spent.
Metal and water both rest,
the limbs dissolve and vanish,
their merit returned to the virtue of earth.
This corresponds to the ninth month, Xu,
the time to withdraw the yin tally.

"Losing the utmost spirit" refers to the six lines below, all yin.

**When the Dao Reaches Its Limit, It Reverts, Chapter Sixty**
When the Dao reaches its limit, it reverts,
returning to the *Primordial* of *Kun*.
Ever compliant with earth’s patterns,
it receives heaven’s mandate and spreads forth.

*Qian* begins with *Kun*:
six yielding yin lines,
beneath the ninefold earth,
one firm line transforms—
this is called "the birth of one yang."
From this yang qi begins,
advancing through six changes to pure yang,
and the body of *Qian* is complete.
When pure yang qi is full,
yang at its extreme gives rise to yin.
Beneath the six firm yang lines of *Qian*,
one yielding line transforms—
this is called "the birth of one yin."
Through six changes to pure yin,
it returns once more to the body of *Kun*.
Thus it is said: when the Dao reaches its limit, it reverts,
returning to the *Primordial* of *Kun*.

*Kun* is earth, mother, yin.
*Qian* is heaven, father, yang.
Yin attains yang and gives birth;
yang attains yin and achieves completion.
This is what is meant by "one yin, one yang—this is the Dao."
It bends to shape the myriad things without omission.
Thus it is said: ever compliant with earth’s patterns,
it receives heaven’s mandate and spreads forth.

This is likened to the twelve months of the year,
the twelve hours of the day,
the advancing and retreating fire tally of yin and yang,
the essential qi of *Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, and *Li* cycling endlessly.
Its wondrous workings are inexhaustible,
enabling the divine maiden and numinous youth
to join yin and yang within the sacred chamber,
the soaring dragon and crouching tiger
to unite hun and po within the mother’s womb.
Thus the spirit transforms without bound,
giving birth to the purely refined.

**The Profound and Fathomless, Chapter Sixty-One**
Profound, secluded, distant, and boundless,
separated yet interconnected.
Responding to measure, nurturing life—
the origin of yin and yang.
Vast and indistinct,
none know its beginning.
First lost in confusion,
later becoming the sovereign lord.
No level ground without slope—
such is the Dao’s nature.
Change and renewal wax strong,
waxing and waning follow one another.

From *Kun*’s end to *Fu*’s beginning,
like tracing a linked ring.
Emperors and kings inherit and serve—
enduring for a thousand generations.

Though heaven and earth are profound and distant,
when the qi of sun and moon intersect,
they respond to their celestial measures,
interconnecting to nurture the seeds of the myriad things,
becoming the ancestors of yin and yang.
Yin and yang unite their essence
within the vast and indistinct expanse of heaven and earth—
none know whence they emerge or vanish.

This is likened to the crucible’s symbolic form:
*Qian* and *Kun* as father and mother,
revolving the axes of *Kan* and *Li*,
male and female within the crucible.
Within the vast and indistinct,
none perceive the traces of their transformations.

Gold, as the root of the elixir within the vessel,
first appears undifferentiated as dark and yellow,
lost in confusion without track or path.
Next, yin and yang divide;
finally, the sovereign lord—
the five phases interact without cease,
adversity and prosperity alternate,
waxing and waning follow one another.
From *Fu*’s beginning to *Kun*’s end,
from new moon to dark moon,
entering the tally and issuing fire,
augmenting water and stabilizing metal,
advancing fire and halting water—
the principle resembles a cycle.
The inner image of metal and water nurturing life
is like the ruler:
when the tally’s fire is applied without missing the season,
the dragon and tiger endure for a thousand autumns.

**Cultivating Nature, Chapter Sixty-Two**
To cultivate nature,
extend life and delay death.
Examine the end with care,
and first consider its beginning.

The body one examines
is fundamentally empty.
Primal essence spreads like clouds,
borne by qi at the outset.

Master Wei said: Those in the world who wish to extend life and delay death
must understand the body’s beginning and end.
Beginning and end—
this is the primordial qi.
This is likened to the completion of the returning elixir,
which arises entirely from primordial qi,
continuing the boundless primordial qi
to sustain the limited bodily form.

Boundless primordial qi
is the long-lived true essence of heaven and earth,
the qi of the sacred father and numinous mother.
The limited bodily form
is the short-lived, turbid, and chaotic qi
of ordinary parents.
Thus, with the qi of the true parents,
one transforms the body of ordinary parents
into a form of pure yang and true essence,
thereby attaining the same lifespan as heaven and earth.

Master Tao said: Primordial qi is humanity’s root.
The *Ancient Song* says:
Refine it, ingest it for a thousand days,
and when the body is free of yin, how can death come?
Thus, the pure yang essence and qi
cannot decay or perish.

**Yin and Yang as Measure, Chapter Sixty-Three**
Yin and yang serve as measure,
the dwelling of hun and po.
Yang spirit is the sun’s hun,
yin spirit is the moon’s po.
Hun and po,
each makes the other its dwelling.

Nature presides within,
establishing the inner and outer barriers.
Emotion governs without,
building walls and outer ramparts.
When walls and ramparts are complete,
people and things find peace.
At this time,
emotion harmonizes with *Qian* and *Kun*.

*Qian* moves and extends,
its qi spreading, its essence flowing.
*Kun* is still and receptive,
becoming the Dao’s abode.
The firm acts and retreats,
the soft transforms and nourishes.
Nine returns, seven reversals,
eight returns, six resides.

The white male, the red female—
metal and fire restrain each other.
Water settles fire,
the beginning of the five phases.
Supreme goodness is like water,
clear and without flaw.
The Dao’s form and image—
true unity is hard to depict.
Though it changes and spreads forth,
each dwells in its own place.

The regulation of yin and yang is this: in refining the Golden Liquor Returning Elixir, one must first determine the movements of yin and yang, then establish the *Qian* and *Kun* cauldron and furnace. The dwelling of *hun* and *po*—each serving as the other’s chamber—refers to the solar *hun* and lunar *po* mutually restraining each other within the golden chamber, forming the foundation of the elixir.

Nature presides within, establishing the inner and outer barriers, for nature belongs to metal. Metal governs the inner principle, receiving and stabilizing external signs to nurture the numinous mercury. The barriers and ramparts are the physical form. Emotion governs without, building walls and outer ramparts, for emotion is the fire of the talisman. Fire moves through the six voids, becoming cinnabar mercury and the city walls. The people are the cinnabar mercury. At this time, it is also through the movement and stillness of *Qian* and *Kun*, the flowing of qi and spreading of essence, that earth resides in the central palace, becoming the Dao’s abode. Yang submits, yin acts; prosperity comes as adversity departs. The punishment and virtue of yin and yang form the fundamental path of the medicine.

Nine returns, seven reversals, eight returns, six resides: this refers to metal’s generating number being four and its completing number nine; fire’s generating number being two and its completing number seven; wood’s generating number being three and its completing number eight; water’s generating number being one and its completing number six; earth’s generating number being five and its completing number ten.

The white male and the red female: metal initially arises from water and belongs to yin, associated with the northern *Kan* trigram, the male within the *Qian* household, thus called the *Kan* male, metal white. Hence, the male is white. Fire belongs to yang, associated with the southern *Li* trigram, the female within the *Kun* household, thus called the *Li* female, fire red. Hence, the female is red. Moreover, when metal is within the cauldron, it is the male, the husband of the *Li* female; when outside the cauldron, it reverses to become the female, the wife of the *Kan* male. Thus, the metal mother receives the qi of the Great Yang and produces the numinous mercury.

Restraint settles water: this means metal and fire restrain each other, preventing the true water from flowing away. Water is the beginning of the five phases, for water’s generating number is one. Supreme goodness is like water: water is the mother of the myriad things, clear and without flaw, invisible to the eye. The Dao’s form and image: it operates subtly within the cauldron, transforming endlessly, impossible to depict. Transforming and spreading forth: this means the five phases each guard their boundaries, and the fire talisman does not err in the four seasons.

As in the sixty-fourth chapter, "Like a Chicken’s Egg":
Like a chicken’s egg, white and black correspond.
A span of one inch, the beginning.
Four limbs and five viscera, sinews and bones complete.
After ten months, it emerges from its womb.
Bones soft and pliable, flesh smooth as lead.

In refining the Golden Liquor Returning Elixir, there is an altar; upon the altar, a furnace; within the furnace, lightning; within the lightning, a cauldron; within the cauldron, a divine chamber; and within the divine chamber, golden water. The divine chamber resembles a chicken’s egg, as does the golden water. "Like a chicken’s egg" describes the layers enfolding one another. "White and black correspond" means gold and water envelop each other. "A span of one inch" refers to the placement of the numinous mercury. If the *Qian* and *Kun* pivot is employed, with *Kan* and *Li* generating and completing, after ten months the form is complete, no different from a human—four limbs, five viscera, bones, and flesh all whole.

These several lines reveal Master Wei’s disclosure of the inner and outer symbolic forms, the shape and appearance of cinnabar mercury. Lord Yin the True’s *"Song of the Divine Chamber"* says:
The earthen golden cauldron, seven spans in life and death.
The divine chamber, threefold bright, five inches in diameter.
Chaotic and wandering, heaven and earth, the five stars,
Yin and yang conjoined.
Resembling a chicken’s egg, the form without flaw.
Yellow and white, outer and inner, evenly thick and thin.
Sealed with six and one, guard well the noon gate.

The *Cantong Qi* also states: "With water, the mother controls the earth." "Flesh smooth as lead": cinnabar arises from lead to symbolize the mother. Master Cao’s song says:
A hundred moments reach the *Li* qi,
From which cinnabar emerges.
Its body like true pearls,
Though cinnabar is not originally red.
This clarifies its form resembling true pearls, its flesh smooth like lead.

**Chapter Sixty-Five: The Burning Mirror Gathers Fire**
With the burning mirror, fire is gathered;
without the sun, no light is born.
Without the moon and stars, the square vessel
cannot yield water and broth.
The two qi are profound and distant,
yet their resonance and transformation still communicate.
How much more so when near, stored within the body,
close to the heart and chest.

Yin and yang pair with the sun and moon;
water and fire serve as proof.
If the burning mirror and square vessel, moved by qi, can still generate water and fire, how could *Qian* and *Kun*, the sun and moon, set in place as symbols, fail to generate and complete? Moreover, when near, drawing from the body, and when far, drawing from things—first delving into the mother of heaven and earth to lay the foundation of the elixir, finally uniting the essence of the sun and moon to serve as the ancestor of the medicine—with kinds producing one another, water and fire restraining each other, how could there be no evidence of efficacy?

**Chapter Sixty-Six: The Three Treasures of Ear, Eye, and Mouth**
The three treasures—ear, eye, and mouth—
firmly sealed, do not let them scatter.
The true person hides in the deep abyss,
floating and wandering, guarding the compass’s center.
Turning and curving to see and hear,
opening and closing, all in harmony.
As the pivot for oneself,
movement and stillness never exhausted.

The *Li* qi inwardly defends and protects;
the *Kan* does not employ hearing.
The *Dui* joins without speech,
few words follow the primordial chaos.
Once these three are secured,
relax the body in an empty chamber.
Entrust the will to emptiness and nothingness,
taking no-thought as the constant.

Proof is difficult to shift;
the heart is focused, not scattered.
In sleep, spirit and soul embrace;
in waking, watch for life and death.
The complexion gradually moistens,
the bones and joints grow stronger.
Expelling the host of yin demons,
only then is the true yang established.

If cultivation is unceasing,
the qi will ascend like clouds and rain.
Gentle as spring’s moisture,
flowing like melting ice.
From the head, it streams down to the feet,
ultimately rising again.
Coming and going through the boundless,
filling the space within.

The reversal is the proof of the Dao;
weakness is the handle of virtue.
Weed and hoe the long-accumulated filth,
and even the subtle finds harmony.
The turbid is the path to clarity;
prolonged darkness yields to brightness.

The *Yi* says: *Kan* is the ear, *Li* the eye, *Dui* the mouth.
*Kan*, *Li*, and *Dui*—these are water, fire, and metal.
Locking the water and fire, sealing the metal mother,
one calls the infant boy and compliant girl "true persons,"
floating within the womb,
letting the metal mother relax her body in the empty vessel,
without the stirrings of thought,
to verify the natural generation of male and female.
Once yin and yang within the crucible
rise and descend in harmonious balance,
the dragon and tiger within the womb
embrace in ascent and descent,
firmly securing the true essence.
The complexion gradually moistens,
the bones and joints grow stronger.
If cultivation is unceasing,
proof will come with time.

Drawing out the yin fire
is called expelling the yin demons;
adding the yang tally
is the proper arousal of yang’s movement—
revolving without end.
The spirit chamber settles into peace,
clouds move and rain descends;
mercury flows as golden liquid,
like melting ice.
From the feet to the head,
it suffuses the true person’s body,
circulating through the metal mother’s form.
The fire’s qi swells within the crucible,
the yin essence guards its weakness within the compass.
Prolonged darkness yields to light—
this is the moment when yin reaches its extreme and yang arises.
Within clarity, the turbid appears—
this is the time when fire departs and water returns.
The four seasons alternate,
the five phases mutually engage.

Reversal is the proof of attaining the Dao:
*Kan* departs, *Li* arrives.
Weakness is the foundation of cultivating virtue:
yang extends, yin submits.
The *Kan* ear does not hear,
so that the yin spirit may harmonize,
and the true water does not flow away.
The *Li* eye does not see,
so that the yang soul may warmly nurture the true mercury,
and it does not escape.
The *Dui* mouth does not speak,
sealing the metal womb,
so that it does not open and leak the red dragon’s essence.

The four chapters of *True契* that Master Wei puzzled over
establish their words and metaphors—
all are drawn from afar but applied nearby,
matters manifest yet words subtle.
Their intent is neither to openly reveal heaven’s mechanism
nor to conceal the supreme Dao.
Thus, they fully clarify here
how inner imagery and outer practice coincide.

**Chapter Sixty-Seven: The World Prefers Petty Techniques**
The world prefers petty techniques,
failing to examine the Dao’s depth.

Those who abandon the true Way to follow deviant paths
seek swift passage through gates that will not open.
Like the blind refusing a staff,
or the deaf straining to hear gong and shang notes—
they plunge into water to seize pheasants and hares,
or climb mountains in search of fish and dragons.
They plant wheat hoping to harvest millet,
or spin compasses to seek squares.
Exhausting their strength and laboring their spirits,
throughout the year they see no achievement.

To know the method of ingesting the elixir:
its affairs are few yet not cumbersome.
Master Wei observed that the world favors learning petty arts,
rushing toward shortcuts.
Yet these petty arts and swift paths
have beginnings but no ends.
Though one may expend great effort,
few ever attain completion—
like the blind and deaf groping in seeing and hearing,
or hunters and fishers erring amid mountains and rivers.
Since their choices and rejections are misaligned,
how can they rightly distinguish truth from falsehood?

I urge the pursuit of the supreme Dao:
few in affairs yet not cumbersome.
Moreover, the Golden Liquor and Returned Cinnabar
are the supreme Way of soaring into the heavens by daylight.
If one encounters an enlightened master,
or receives divine instruction,
and follows its wondrous formulas in cultivation,
then the principle of *ease and simplicity* is attained.

**Chapter Sixty-Eight: The Radiant Sun’s Flowing Pearl**

The radiant sun’s flowing pearl
ever seeks to depart from man.
Suddenly obtaining the golden blossom,
it turns and intermingles.
Transformed into white liquor,
it congeals to utmost firmness.
The golden blossom first intones;
after a brief interval,
it dissolves and transforms into water,
its horse-teeth lattice arrayed.
Yang then goes forth to harmonize,
their natures and dispositions spontaneous.
When yin presses urgently upon the time,
it is confined within the gate of restraint.
The compassionate mother nurtures and rears;
the filial son repays the kindness.
The stern father issues commands,
instructing and admonishing descendants.
The Five Phases intermingle as kings,
each relying on the other to generate.
Fire’s nature melts metal;
metal fells the flourishing wood.
The Three and Five with the One—
the celestial and terrestrial utmost essence.
This may be transmitted orally,
but is difficult to convey in writing.

The "flowing pearl of the Grand Yang" arises when earthly qi responds to celestial qi, transforming into pearl-like dew—this is the pure essence of yang, capable of generating the myriad things. Though it possesses qi, it lacks form, hence it is called the "Crimson Dragon." The yang fire transforms qi into cinnabar, thus fire gives birth to earth, and earth gives birth to metal. Metal is the mysterious essence of the Grand Yin, capable of nurturing the myriad things. Though it possesses qi, it also has substance, hence it is called the "Golden Blossom."

The Crimson Dragon is originally born of *jia* and *yi*, also named the "Azure Dragon"—yang, father, husband, fire. The Golden Blossom is provisionally born of *geng* and *xin*, also named the "White Tiger"—yin, mother, wife, water. Thus, the meanings of the Azure Dragon and White Tiger are as such. Yet if yin and yang are inverted, the Five Phases interchanged, and male and female roles reversed, their significance shifts accordingly. The *Song of the Perfected One of Grand White* states:

*"The art of inverting the Five Phases—
the Dragon emerges from within fire.
The Five Phases move not in sequence—
the Tiger is born within water."*

The root of reverted cinnabar and the ancestor of Dragon and Tiger: the Dragon is born of fire, the Tiger arises from water. These words are immutable. The metal wife first intones, the wood husband scatters and bestows. The divine mother conceives, giving birth to the *chunü*. As the *chunü* gradually matures, her transformations are manifold. Sometimes she dissolves into water, sometimes her horse-teeth lattice appears. Though the metal mother originates from water, amid her transformations, the watery essence never ceases.

"Yang then goes forth to harmonize, their natures and dispositions spontaneous" refers to the mutual generation of metal and mercury. "When yin presses urgently upon the time, it is confined within the gate of restraint" describes the succession of yin qi, which aids in protecting the inner palace. "The compassionate mother nurtures and rears; the filial son repays the kindness"—the compassionate mother is the inner embryo, while the filial son is true mercury. The *Song of the Perfected Yin Lord* states: "True yang is cinnabar, true yin is mercury." Since mercury is born of the metal mother, this is called repaying kindness. Their mutual embrace and swallowing signify the intermingling qi of Dragon and Tiger.

"The stern father issues commands, instructing and admonishing descendants"—*Qian* is the father trigram, which instructs all trigrams to assist the *Li* maiden and *Kan* youth, and the Five Phases together generate the mercury and cinnabar descendants. In reverted cinnabar, lead and fire are the ancestral principles, employed from beginning to end. The remaining qi, temporal markers, and auxiliary signs serve to establish the foundation of the spirit. Beyond this lies not the Way of the Golden Liquor Reverted Cinnabar.

Fire can melt metal, yet fire is born of wood, and metal in turn restrains wood—thus fire, metal, and wood reverse their constraints to flourish. An ancient song states:

*"Cinnabar is the essence of wood,
only when united with metal do they merge."*

Another verse says:

*"Once the Three Natures unite,
the Two Flavors naturally bind.
The embryo is firmly sealed, no leakage—
transformation occurs in an instant."*

The Three Natures are fire, metal, and wood. The Two Flavors are lead and mercury, Dragon and Tiger. Thus it is said: "The Three and Five with the One— the celestial and terrestrial utmost essence." This may be transmitted orally, but is difficult to convey in writing—how could it be lightly discussed with the unworthy?

The annotation states: "Reversing male and female" refers to divine water restraining fire; yet within the divine chamber, fire in turn restrains metal. Thus mercury is the water within cinnabar, and metal is the cinnabar within water. Cinnabar gives birth to mercury, and metal gives birth to water.

**You should turn right at *zi*, while *wu* rotates eastward. *Mao* and *you* form the boundary, establishing the two names of host and guest. The Dragon calls to the Tiger, the Tiger inhales the Dragon’s essence. Both devour each other, each coveting the other’s advantage. Thus they interlock and swallow, chewing and consuming one another. When *Yinghuo* guards the west, the *Grand Peace* traverses the heavens. Wherever the killing qi descends, what could remain unshaken? The cat guards the mouse, the sparrow fears the goshawk. Each fulfills its function—how dare any make a sound?**

Turning right at *zi* reaches *you*; rotating east at *wu* arrives at *mao*. These twelve earthly branches mark the cyclical return of yin and yang, corresponding to the fire phases. The *mao-you* boundary signifies the equilibrium of metal and wood qi. The two names of host and guest are the designations of metal and wood. Since the Azure Dragon can exhale qi, the White Tiger thereby inhales its essence. Their essences intermingle, together generating purity.

*Yinghuo* is the extreme yang fire number. "Guarding the west" means the fire qi presses upon the metal embryo. When metal receives the full brilliance of fire, its radiance fills the vessel. The metal qi, borne by fire, traverses the heavens—thus it is said: "Wherever the killing qi descends, what could remain unshaken?" Then the *chunü* and true mercury dare not flee, like a cat seizing a mouse or a sparrow fearing the goshawk.

*Grand White* is the essence of metal. "Traversing the heavens" refers to *jia* and *yi*.

The metals, fires, and woods alternately restrain and subdue one another, yet none suffers harm, each attaining its fulfillment—thus all sounds are harmonious.

**Chapter Seventy: Failing to Grasp the Principle**
Failing to grasp the principle, one ought not speak recklessly.
Exhausting the family’s wealth, wife and children suffer hunger and poverty.
From ancient times to the present, countless millions have pursued this path,
Yet few meet with success, rare are those who achieve it.
Seeking famous medicines far and wide, they stray from the Dao.
If one truly encounters the Way and perceives its beginnings,
Then by analogy one may weigh the nature of things and their endings.
Master Wei said: In refining the golden liquor and returning elixir, without grasping the principle, one must not act rashly.
Wasting family wealth, one further burdens wife and children;
From ancient times to the present, those who have loved the Dao number in the millions,
Yet without meeting an enlightened teacher or encountering true instructions, they ultimately fail.
If one receives transmission, discerns its signs, and cultivates by analogy, then success will crown the beginning and end.

**Chapter Seventy-One: The Five Phases Restraining One Another**
The five phases restrain one another, alternating as father and mother.
The mother contains the nourishing essence, the father bestows and endows.
Condensing essence and flowing form, metals and stones do not decay.
By careful focus and non-dissipation, one attains the fruition of the Dao.
Erect a pole and see its shadow; call into a valley and hear its echo—
Is this not wondrous? The supreme image of heaven and earth.
Yet if one takes a single inch of wild aconite or an ounce of croton, swallowing it brings instant collapse, leaving one unable to rise or bow.
At such a time, though King Wen cast yarrow stalks, Confucius interpreted omens,
Bian Que wielded his needles, or Wu Xian beat his drum,
How could they revive the stricken or restore them to swift movement?
The five phases generate and restrain one another, alternating as father and mother, mutually serving as husband and wife.
Parents observe one another and give birth; yin and yang depend on each other to stand, together forming the indestructible elixir.
Should one obtain this, one ought to guard it with utmost care to fulfill the Dao.
Thus, a pole cast upright yields an instant shadow, an empty valley returns an echo.
If even wild aconite, once ingested, produces immediate effects,
How much more so the golden liquor and returning elixir?

**Chapter Seventy-Two: The Maiden of the River’s Edge**
The maiden of the river’s edge is numinous and most divine.
When she meets fire, she takes flight, leaving no trace of dust.
Ghosts conceal her, dragons hide her—none know where she abides.
Should one seek to restrain her, the yellow sprout must serve as root.
The maiden of the river’s edge is true mercury.
When she encounters fire, she soars away, like a ghost concealed or a dragon submerged—none know her whereabouts.
If one intends to restrain her, one must obtain the yellow sprout as her mother to nurture and sustain her.
The yellow sprout is true lead.

**Chapter Seventy-Three: Things Lacking Yin and Yang**
Things lacking yin and yang defy heaven and contravene the primal.

**Chapter Seventy-Three (continued): The Hen’s Egg**
The hen’s own egg—its chick is never whole.
Why is this so?
The union was not yet in motion, the Three and Five unjoined, hardness and softness sundered.
The essence of transformation, heaven and earth’s spontaneity—
like fire stirring to flame upward, water flowing to moisten downward.
No master’s Way compels them thus.
The origin governs all governance; it cannot be altered again.
Observe the male and female in their mating:
hardness and softness entwine, inseparable.
When their rhythm aligns, no craft or artifice governs them.
The boy is born prone, the girl supine.
They receive their allotment in the womb, their qi from the primal beginning.
Not only at birth is this manifest—
even in death, they repeat it.
Not by parents’ teaching do they thus behave;
the pattern was fixed in mating, determined at the very first.
The *Book of Changes* says: “One yin, one yang—this is called the Dao.”
Between heaven and earth, were yin and yang sundered, the myriad things would cease to be.
Lone yin, solitary yang—neither can generate or complete.
Thus, if the divine medicine’s workings lack the Three and Five in motion, if metal and wood do not unite, how can the elixir form?
Fire flames upward, water moistens downward—all is the nature of spontaneity.
When they unite in cultivation, their numinous essence arises of itself.
Each receives the qi of the primal beginning, and their natures are thus fixed.
For instance: the boy is born prone, and so he lies in death;
the girl is born supine, and so she lies in death.
Thus, from the mating of male and female, the true essence is perpetuated.

**Chapter Seventy-Four: The Kan Male as Moon**
The Kan male is the moon, the Li female the sun.
The sun bestows its power, the moon unfurls its light.
The moon receives the sun’s transformation, its body unharmed.
When yang loses its bond, yin encroaches upon its brightness.
At dark and new moon, they press close, eclipsing one another.
Yang’s form is consumed, yin’s encroachment brings calamity.
Male and female depend on each other, inhaling and exhaling to nurture.
Male and female intermingle, seeking their kind.
The moon’s essence is golden cinnabar; the sun’s spirit is fiery mercury.
If the sun retreats, the moon assumes authority.
Metal and fire alternate in their work, restraining one another—nothing is harmed.
Between dark and new moon lies the moment of yin and yang’s succession,
the time of the sun and moon’s waxing and waning.
Thus, when they press close and eclipse, their forms are consumed.
This illustrates the crucible’s inner yin tally and yang fire,
exchanging with each passing moment, from dusk to dawn,
shifting with the hours, replacing one another.
Where they overlap, calamity is said to arise.
Within it, the Kan male and Li female remain:
the male’s passion, the female’s nature,
mutually dependent, inhaling and exhaling,
gathering by kind to generate and transform,
refining true essence into divine medicine.

**Chapter Seventy-Five: Metal Transforms into Water**
Metal transforms into water, water’s nature circulating and manifest.

**Chapter Seventy-Five: Fire Transforms into Earth**
Fire transforms into earth, and water cannot flow.
Thus, the male moves outward to bestow, while the female remains still, inwardly storing.
If it overflows beyond measure, it is restrained by the female.
The po controls the hun,
preventing excess or indulgence.
Neither cold nor hot, advancing and retreating in due time,
each attains harmony, together exhaling the verifying tally.
When fire reaches the second and eighth months, metal and water stretch and flourish.
Sometimes watery essence arises from metal,
sometimes golden cinnabar transforms into water—
thus harmony blends and circulates.
When fire’s reckoning is exhausted, its merit returns to earth.
Earth guards the four seasons, damming water to prevent its flight—
hence water cannot flow.
The male moves outward to bestow, so fire acts externally;
the female remains still, inwardly storing, so metal guards the central palace.
Though fire’s qi encounters it,
metal is bound by water.
With yin po restrained, yang hun also submits.
Cold and warmth embrace, each finding its proper place.
Together exhaling the verifying tally, they nourish the numinous mercury.

**Chapter Seventy-Six: Cinnabar and Wood Essence**
Cinnabar and wood essence unite only when met with metal.
Where metal and water converge, wood and fire become companions.
The four intermingle in chaos, arrayed as dragon and tiger.
The dragon bears yang’s odd numbers, the tiger yin’s even.
The liver, green, is the father; the lungs, white, the mother.
The kidneys, black, are the child; the heart, red, the daughter.
The spleen, yellow, is the ancestor—
the child is the beginning of the Five Phases.
Three substances form one household, all returning to wu and ji.
That cinnabar and wood essence unite only when met with metal:
cinnabar is originally congealed within the metal’s womb.
Metal, in turn, is water’s root.
When metal is struck by fire, cinnabar is produced—
thus cinnabar comes to merge with metal.
Metal and wood transform themselves,
while water and fire mutually refine.
The four intermingle, and within them take shape dragon and tiger.
Yin and yang’s odd and even numbers divide their ascent and descent by day and night.
The liver, green, is the father:
jia and yi belong to the fire clan, yet unite with the metal mother—
hence it is named father.
The lungs, white, are the mother:
the metal mother guards the inner womb, ever taking fire as her husband—
hence it is named mother.
The kidneys, black, are the child:
the metal mother is born from water,
yet within the crucible, water in turn is born from metal—
thus water becomes the child.
The child water’s number is one, the beginning of the Five Phases.
Metal, water, and wood share a single function,
their transformations spanning from start to finish,
all returning to wu and ji—
therefore the spleen, yellow, is the medicine’s ancestor.

**Chapter Seventy-Seven: Hard and Soft Alternate in Ascendancy**
Hard and soft alternate in ascendancy, traversing their divided domains.

The Dragon lies west, the Tiger east—
establishing their weft at mao and you.
Punishment and virtue converge in union,
their meeting a joyous encounter.
Punishment governs suppression and slaying;
virtue governs generation and ascent.
In the second month, the elm scatters its pods,
as the *Kui* star presides over mao.
In the eighth month, wheat sprouts forth,
while the Celestial Net holds fast to you.
Zi to the south, wu to the north—
each serves as the other’s guiding principle.
The numbers one and nine,
end and begin anew.
The Primordial Qi abides in *Xu* and *Wei*,
disseminating essence at zi.
Water and fire alternate in ascendancy,
traversing their ordained paths,
distributed through the twelve celestial branches—
Dragon and Tiger, mao and you, mark their boundary.
Yin’s punishment brings suppression and slaying;
yang’s virtue brings generation and ascent.
When punishment and virtue meet,
each restrains the other,
yet together they achieve harmony—
hence it is called a joyous encounter.

The elm scatters its pods in the second month,
for though yang fire advances from zi to mao,
and yang qi gains sway,
it has not yet reached pure yang—
yin lingers within, making it yang containing yin.
Thus it suffers punishment and slaying:
yin steals yang’s qi,
causing the elm’s pods to fall
in the very month of mid-spring’s burgeoning.
Wheat sprouts in the eighth month,
for though yin’s tally retreats from wu to you,
and yin qi gains sway,
it has not yet reached pure yin—
yang lingers within, making it yin containing yang.
Thus it receives virtue’s generation:
yang steals yin’s qi,
causing wheat shoots to rise
in the very month of mid-autumn’s withering.

This illustrates how, within the crucible,
the Metal Mother,
amidst the waxing and waning of yin and yang,
steals from one another—
now unfurling and enfolding true essence,
now shattering cinnabar and mercury.
Zi to the south embodies yin containing yang,
the image of the *Kan* man.
Wu to the north embodies yang containing yin,
the image of the *Li* woman.
The number one is yin;
the number nine is yang.
Yin and yang’s cyclical end and beginning
serve as the medicine’s function.
Primordial Qi arises from *Xu* and *Wei*,
while yang qi once more disseminates essence at zi,
giving birth to true numen.

**Chapter Seventy-Eight: The Osprey’s Cry**
By the river’s isle, the osprey cries—
*guan guan*, the osprey cries.

The demure and graceful maiden—
a gentleman’s fine mate.
The male does not dwell alone;
the female does not live in solitude.
Black Warrior’s tortoise and serpent
coil and intertwine in mutual support.
Thus are male and female made clear,
each ever in need of the other.
Were two women to share a chamber,
their beauty most fair,
and should Su Qin convey their words,
Zhang Yi broker the match,
unleashing eloquent tongues,
deploying honeyed speech,
laying bare their hearts in perfect accord,
to wed as husband and wife—
yet with hair decayed and teeth rotten,
they would never truly know one another.
If medicinal ingredients are not of the same kind,
their names and categories disparate,
their measures misaligned,
their guiding principles lost—
though the Yellow Emperor himself tend the crucible,
the Great One wield the fire,
the Eight Lords pound and refine,
Huainan blend and harmonize,
pavilions raised and altars erected,
steps and terraces prepared,
unicorn jerky and phoenix cured meats laid out,
registers held in reverent kneel,
prayers and invocations offered to gods and spirits,
pleas made to all ghosts,
with ablutions and fasting observed,
hopes held high—
it would be no different than mending a cauldron with glue,
or plastering a wound with □,
adding ice to dispel cold,
or scalding water to relieve heat:
flying turtles and dancing serpents,
only more perverse and wayward.

All who cultivate the Golden Liquor’s Returned Cinnabar
must first clarify the root of lead and fire,
then recognize the principles of yin and yang.
Solitary yin does not generate of itself;
lone yang does not achieve completion alone.
One must await the union of yin and yang,
the coupling of female and male,
the dragon’s exhalation and the tiger’s inhalation,
the male’s maturation and the female’s conception.
Thus it is said:
A hen’s self-laid egg—
its chick will not be whole.
Two women dwelling together—
their bond will not be true.

Moreover, between heaven and earth,
were yin and yang sundered,
the myriad things would cease to be.
Thus, to plumb the true essence of heaven and earth,
to seize the root of yin and yang—
this becomes the foundation of the medicine.
If one were to use gold and stone, grasses and trees,
ice and snow, frost and dew, salt and brine—
things not of the same kind, alien categories,
solitary yin or lone yang—
though the Yellow Emperor tend the crucible,
the Great One wield the fire,
the Eight Lords pound and refine,
Huainan blend and harmonize,
elaborate altars and platforms erected,
wine and viands lavishly prepared,
reverent kneeling and solemn prayers offered,
petitions made to all gods and ghosts—
yet still hope for the Returned Cinnabar’s completion,
it would be as futile as mending a cauldron with glue,
or plastering a wound with □:
flying turtles and dancing serpents,
all in vain.

This analogy—
when the sovereign and his ministers unite in harmony,
like the coupling of yin and yang,
they respond to one another as naturally as the five phases.
Gold and water, in their proper seasons and measures,
prolong life within the chamber’s stillness.
Moreover, true gold, as the first of the five phases,
holds the fire tally.
There is a furnace, and upon the furnace—
the Perfected Lord of Yin’s crucible,
seven inches long and one inch in diameter,
as described in the *Cantong Qi*.
Thus, the circulation of qi and blood,
the gates and towers of the body,
all are regulated.
Abiding in an empty room,
awakening to the truth,
the movement of the Way reverses all things.
Within the hollow vessel,
its yin essence submerged in water,
one obtains the golden millet.
The method of ingestion is not cumbersome:
a single path suffices.
Mountains and rivers respond in kind,
their patterns interlocking like latticework.
Yet if one clings to restraint or hoards in excess,
or errs in the alternation of kingship,
the union will fail to manifest.
Those that interlock and devour one another—
fire, in its appointed role,
the Great Peace’s essence—
true mercury arises from this.
Those who truly follow the Dao,
attaining the supreme image,
seal the root and turn from the primal.
The hen that crows at dawn,
before the cycle begins,
must be fixed in place.
Thus, the spirit and essence,
the bestowal of virtue,
its bond with life—
water, though exhausted, does not take flight.
When encountering the red heart as the feminine,
returning to form,
the tally aligns with the Way.
Yet when it resides within...

Within it, the reversal—
thus water becomes the child.
The child-water,
unified as one,
heaven’s guiding net—
this analogy:
its expansion and contraction,
the coiled serpent’s dance,
its profound subtlety.
Husband and wife,
the warp and weft of the celestial order,
the Supreme Unity,
refined through smelting.
The rooster,
dwelling in harmony,
with wine and viands—

**Chapter the Seventy-Ninth: Only the Sages of Old**

Only the sages of old,
embraced the Mysterious and held fast to the True.
They ingested and refined the Nine Cauldrons,
transforming their traces to conceal and merge.
Containing essence and nurturing spirit,
they penetrated virtue through the Three Luminaries.
Their fluids suffused the pores,
their sinews and bones attained firmness.
All perverse influences were dispelled,
the upright qi ever abided.
Accumulating over long ages,
they altered their forms and became immortals.

Grieving for later generations,
those who loved the Dao,
they followed the winds and gathered fragments,
sketching ancient texts.
They composed diagrams and records,
revealing them to posterity.
Yet they exposed only the branches and twigs,
hiding the root and trunk.
They entrusted them to stones and minerals,
obscuring the multitude of writings.
Scholars who obtained them,
locked them in caskets for life.
Sons inherited their fathers’ work,
grandsons followed their ancestors’ paths.
Transmitted through the ages in confusion,
none ever glimpsed the truth.
Thus officials abandoned office,
farmers neglected their plows,
merchants forsook their goods,
and men of purpose fell into poverty.

I sorrow deeply for this,
and so set down this text.
Its words are concise and easily pondered,
its matters few and unburdened.
I lay out its principles,
verifying what may be observed.
Weights and measures are numbered,
following one another in sequence.
Thus I compose these disordered verses,
opening the gates and apertures.
Let the wise reflect deeply,
and apply their minds to this.

Master Wei said: The Three Sovereigns refined the divine elixir of the Nine Cauldrons and ingested it, attaining the containment of essence and nurturing of spirit, penetrating virtue through the Three Luminaries, transforming and merging their original forms, becoming immortals and guests of the Supreme Emperor. Grieving for later seekers of the Dao, some relied on fragmented ancient texts, others explored esoteric scriptures and formulas, revealing only the shallow and superficial, disclosing the branches while concealing the root, falsely attributing it to metals and stones, confounding the ancestral lineage and obscuring the true pattern. Later generations, obtaining these, failed to investigate the traces, taking the text at face value, mistaking the false for the true, locking them in caskets, passing them on in mutual delusion. Thus some squandered wealth and neglected their livelihoods, vainly harming their Daoist aspirations. Therefore, I have specifically set down this chapter, valuing its brevity and ease of reflection, its concision and lack of entanglement. I expose its essential truth, not merely offering disordered verses, hoping to awaken the unenlightened and directly discuss cinnabar and mercury. Let the wise study it thoroughly, and they will grasp its true meaning.

**Chapter the Eightieth: The Pattern of Heaven and Earth**

No pattern is greater than that of heaven and earth—
the Mysterious Gully spans ten thousand *li*.
The River Drum nears the Star Marker,
and the people all tremble in alarm.
The shadow’s reckoning falsely advances and retreats,
nine years of calamity befall.
The August Emperor gazes upon it,
and the king retreats to reform himself.
The passes and barriers rise and fall,
harmful qi scatters in flight.
The Yangtze and Huai run dry,
their waters flowing into the sea.

The female and male of heaven and earth,
revolve between *zi* and *wu*.
*Yin* at *shen* and *yang* at *yin*,
emerging and entering, completing the cycle’s beginning.
Following the Dipper’s sway and scattering,
grasping the balance to fix the primal order.

The Cauldron of Completion,
patterns heaven and earth within its vessel—
the Mysterious Gully thus matches ten thousand *li*.
The three stars of the River Drum,
when they near the Star Marker close to the Northern Dipper,
portend military might,
and so the people tremble in alarm.
Moreover, the military is ruled by metal,
which here signifies the metal within the cauldron,
subjected to the fire’s timing,
fiercely pressed and scorched,
causing the metal to melt and the cauldron’s chamber to glow.
Thus drought and calamity arise,
truly due to the sundial’s and water-clock’s discrepancies,
leading to the *yang* nine’s sand-like tribulations.
Yet by the August Emperor’s earthly virtue,
metal and water are restrained,
the scorching fire naturally subsides,
and errors are corrected.

If the mechanisms are not secure,
the cauldron’s vessel leaks its tally,
then the primordial qi of the cosmic cycle
rushes into the Yangtze and Huai,
and the water tally flows away.
*Yin* arises at *wu*,
*yang* begins at *zi*,
their movement and stillness revolving,
never departing these two positions.
*Yin* at *shen* and *yang* at *yin*,
water and fire complete their cycles,
all following the Dipper’s establishment to fix the balance and order.

**Chapter the Eighty-First: Ascending and Roasting on Mount Zeng**

Ascending and roasting on Mount Zeng,
the blazing fire spreads below.
The White Tiger sings and leads the way,
the Azure Fluid harmonizes behind.
The Vermilion Bird soars and plays,
its flying radiance in five colors.
It encounters the net’s deployment,
pressed down, unable to rise.
Its cries, mournful and sorrowful,
like an infant longing for its mother.
Overturned and seized by the boiling grasp,
its feathers and wings are crushed and broken.
Before half the water-clock’s measure has passed,
fish scales and manes arise.
Five colors dazzle and terrify,
transformations without constant master.
The cauldron seethes and surges,
violent and unceasing.
Layer upon layer, piled and repeated,
like dog’s teeth interlocking.
Its form like midwinter ice,
railing-like stalactites exude.
Towering and jumbled, mixed together,
crossing and propping one another.

The cauldron rests upon the stove,
the furnace and altar connected,
thus likened to Mount Zeng.
Above the cauldron, water; below, fire.
The White Tiger sings first,
the Metal Mother, receiving fire, takes form.
Sometimes it spits white sand,
sometimes it generates azure fluid.
The Vermilion Bird of *bing*-*ding*,
circulating qi to and fro,
driving the Five Phases,
thus forming five colors.
The Five Qi gather in the cauldron of *qian* and *kun*,
the four seasons follow the gates of water and fire.
Heaven and earth’s barriers,
the net of *yin* and *yang*.
The Maiden is constrained,
true mercury cannot escape.
At times, mournful cries arise,
yet in the end, it clings fondly to its mother.
Thus its feathers and wings are crushed,
within the womb, now mercury, now sand.
When the fire tally of the water-clock is applied,
within the embryo, now scales, now manes.
Transformations without constant master,
yet movement and stillness follow constant patterns.
Sometimes violently surging without cease,
sometimes gushing and overflowing without end.
When the vessel is solid, dog’s teeth interlock;
when suspended in emptiness, stalactites hang like railings.
Leaning and propping, towering and mixed,
all reveal the transformations of metal and water,
fully displaying the forms of cinnabar and mercury.
Subtle and wondrous,
mysterious and profound—
thus Master Wei points to the manifestations of cinnabar and mercury.

**Chapter Eighty-Two: Yin and Yang in Harmonious Union**

Yin and Yang in harmonious union,
serene and tranquil, they guard each other.
The Azure Dragon dwells in Chamber Six,
spring blossoms flourish in the East’s Mao.
The White Tiger resides in Pleiades Seven,
autumn’s awns gleam in the West’s You.
The Vermilion Bird rests in Spread Two,
true Yang blazes in the South’s Wu.
These three come to pay homage,
their kin as intimate companions.
Their root lies in but two substances,
yet in the end they become three and five.
Three and five with the One,
all gather and return to the Two.
Refine them according to the prescribed method,
and the days’ count is likewise observed.

When Yin and Yang unite,
then Metal and Water, serene and tranquil, guard each other.
The Azure Dragon, White Tiger, and Vermilion Bird—
these are the three qi of Wood, Metal, and Fire.
Circulating into the crucible,
they become intimate companions.
Yet the foundation of the elixir originally holds only Metal and Fire.
That they become three, five, and one—
Wood, Earth, and Water combine with the inner Metal and Fire,
together completing the transformations.
All the days required for refinement and circulation
have been fully explained in the preceding chapters.

**Chapter Eighty-Three: First White, Then Yellow**

First white, then yellow,
red and black emerge within and without.
This is called the First Crucible,
its measure like a great grain of millet.
It is the work of Nature herself,
no devious or false path.
As when mountains and marshes exhale their qi,
steaming clouds arise and become rain.
Mud dries and turns to dust,
fire extinguished transforms into earth.
Like the bark that dyes to yellow,
or indigo that yields green silk.
Hide boiled into glue,
yeast and sprouts fermented into wine.
Kindred substances readily yield their effects,
but disparate kinds defy artifice.
This wondrous art alone—
examine it closely, it speaks no falsehood.
Transmitted to a hundred million ages hence,
its brilliance remains self-evident.
Radiant as the stars traversing the Han,
luminous as the sea, source of all waters.
Ponder it deeply until it is mastered,
turn it over and examine it above and below.
After a thousand cycles, resplendent and flourishing,
after ten thousand repetitions, it may be witnessed.
The numinous may reveal itself to man,
the heart’s spirit suddenly awakens.
Trace its beginnings, seek its threads,
and you shall surely find its gate and door.
The Way of Heaven is ever impartial,
yet it is always transmitted to the worthy.

The transformations of the inner embryo’s gold and water manifest thus: the initial white is the gold disgorging its jade-like fluid. The subsequent yellow is the fluid transmuting into the Yellow Sprout. The red and black suffusing its surface and core signify the qi of water and fire, yin and yang, penetrating and harmonizing the embryo’s vitality.

The Gold Fluid Returned Elixir, being the first crucible, is called the Golden Sand Yellow Sprout. As the *Ancient Text of the Dragon and Tiger Classic* states: "The husk is the essence of gold, and water encircles the yellow fluid." Ingesting a single grain, no larger than a millet seed, when the three-year term is complete, one ascends to heaven in broad daylight. It further declares: "Among all elixirs, this is the most numinous trace—none attain longevity without it."

Within the Daoist gate, there are twenty-four great elixirs, all originating from the first crucible, the Golden Sand Yellow Sprout. Those not beginning thus belong to the side doors of material medicines and do not rank among the Gold Fluid Returned Elixirs. Formerly, Li Quan annotated the *Yin Fu Jing*, saying: "Though the arts of the Returned Elixir number in the hundreds, the essence lies in the Divine Water and Flowery Pond." The "hundreds" refer to the firing times—withdrawing and adding, warming and refining, the elixir forms in ninety days. Another ten days complete the firing cycle, totaling one hundred days.

The essence lies in the Divine Water and Flowery Pond, for the Golden Sand Yellow Sprout emerges therefrom. Without this, one cannot discuss the true path of the Gold Fluid Returned Elixir—it is like cleaving open primordial chaos to behold the root of heaven and earth, or rending the vast expanse to witness the mother of yin and yang. Yet when the divine mother resides within the crucible, enveloped by the qi of yin and yang, it is as clouds drifting and rain descending. Water and fire operate, each returning to earth, and the medicine within the embryo changes its color and form with the seasons, its appearance unfixed—like indigo and sprouts dyeing green and yellow, or hides and yeast becoming glue and wine, transforming according to their original kind.

Thus, the sages probed the root and foundation of heaven and earth to become the parents of the Returned Elixir, employing the five phases to generate the numinous medicine. This is not achieved through the five metals, eight stones, or miscellaneous substances. The principles expounded here are luminously verifiable, like stars traversing the Han or waters flowing to the sea. The patterns are complete, the symbols fully arrayed—how could Master Wei have deceived us? Yet one must read these texts ten thousand times for their meaning to become manifest; or, with divine aid and awakened spirit, suddenly perceive their gate and door.

The *Dao De Jing* states: "Heaven and earth are impartial, yet they ever bestow upon the good." A note clarifies: Some Daoist texts claim the three chapters of the *Cantong Qi* were each composed by Master Wei, Xu the Attendant, and Chunyu Shutong—this is gravely mistaken. Here, the Master appends *The Five Phases in Mutual Resemblance*, stating: "I now compile this to fill omissions." Thus, it is clearly the work of Master Wei alone. Moreover, during the Tang, the Perfected Liu Zhigu of Shu presented his *Discourse on the Mysterious Pivot of Sun and Moon* to Emperor Xuanzong, which also elaborates on this—how then can doubts remain about the annotations of the Attendant or the transmissions of Chunyu? Now, these four chapters are divided into three scrolls, comprising ninety sections, corresponding to the yang number nine.

**Chapter 84: Filling Omissions**
The *Cantong Qi* broadly sets forth its principles, yet it cannot maintain purity, overflowing in its discourse. Subtleties remain unaddressed, and gaps abound. I now compile this to fill omissions, refining its profound depths and linking its threads. Its purport is unified, its aims uncontradicted. Thus, I compose this, titling it *The Five Phases in Mutual Resemblance*, wherein the essence and nature of the *Great Change* are fully revealed.

**The Five Phases Attain Harmony, Each with Its Correspondence**
Master Wei first expounded the three chapters of the *Cantong Qi*, unfolding its vastness, yet subtleties remained unaddressed. He then composed this *Five Phases in Mutual Resemblance* to fill omissions, such that the essence and nature of Qian and Kun, yin and yang, the five phases, and the cycles of beginning and end are fully revealed. The patterns of the Returned Elixir, from inception to completion, are now complete.

**Chapter 85: The Essence and Nature of the Great Change**
The essence and nature of the *Great Change* each adhere to their measure. The Yellow Emperor and Laozi thoroughly investigated and applied them, verifying their efficacy. The work of the furnace and fire is truly grounded: the three paths emerge from one, all following the same route. Thus, the rituals of elixir refinement each have their proper measure. The Yellow Emperor and Laozi delved deeply into the Dao, leaving these texts. Comparing the work of the furnace and fire, it is truly grounded—the five phases share a common origin, and the three paths of metal, wood, and fire all proceed from a single route.

**Chapter 86: Branches, Stems, Flowers, and Leaves**
Branches, stems, flowers, and leaves bear fruit in abundance, yet all depend on the root. Do not lose your original nature. The words spoken in sincerity are precise and without error. In refining the Gold Fluid Returned Elixir, one must first recognize the root to yield flourishing flowers and leaves and abundant fruit. "Do not lose your original nature" means not losing true mercury. Recognizing true lead as the root of the medicine naturally produces the fruit of true mercury. Trust that these words will not mislead later generations.

**Chapter 87: Like the Midwinter Season**
Like the midwinter season, bamboo and trees all wither and decay.

**Assisting Yang to Question the Merchants**

Assisting Yang to question the merchants—
the lord deeply conceals himself.
Aligning with the seasons and following the celestial cycles,
he seals his mouth and refrains from speech.
The Dao of Heaven is vast and boundless,
the Great Mystery defies description.
Void and still, it cannot be perceived;
its frame and enclosure dissolve into nothingness.
Errors and missteps disrupt the thread of affairs,
and words return to wound the speaker.
I distinguish these Four Images
to enlighten later generations still in blindness.

In refining the elixir, the fire-timing may cause branches and stems to flourish,
or fruits to ripen in abundance,
or plants and trees to wither and fall—
responding to the midwinter season,
opening and closing in accord with the time,
all governed by the regulation of the fire’s rhythm.

"Assisting Yang to question the merchants" signifies sealing the passes and restricting travel,
symbolizing the firm closure of the crucible,
preventing the leakage of true essence and qi.
"The lord deeply conceals himself" refers to the Golden Mother of the Central Palace.
"Sealing the mouth and refraining from speech" denotes the Chamber of Dui Metal.
"The Dao of Heaven is vast and boundless"—
within the crucible, transformations are limitless.
"The Great Mystery defies description"—
the fluids of metal and water are unfathomable,
their subtle movements infinite,
their divine transformations boundless.
As the four seasons shift,
the frame and enclosure dissolve,
and the forms of metal and water undergo change.

Master Wei said: "The Great Dao nurtures all,
yet the True Governor has no form.
Without employing symbolic methods
to harmonize yin and yang,
restrain and bind their hidden transformations,
and align with the celestial mechanism,
how could one draw forth the essences of the sun and moon,
retain them within the crucible’s confines,
and achieve such wondrous transformation?
If errors disrupt the thread of affairs,
failure and harm are inevitable."
Thus, I set forth this text
to awaken those of later times who have not yet seen the truth.

**Chapter 88: The Rustic of Kuaiji**

The rustic of Kuaiji,
rotting in a secluded valley,
clings to simplicity and plainness,
unmoved by joy or glory.
Dwelling in obscurity and remoteness,
he disregards profit and fame.
Holding fast to tranquility and detachment,
he longs for an era of peace.
At ease in his leisure,
he composes these words,
chanting the great *Yijing*,
the legacy of the Three Sages.
Examining its purport,
he finds unity in its shared principles.

This is Master Wei’s account of his own refusal to chase worldly renown,
his deep entry into the realm of the Dao,
his serene and untroubled repose.
Composing these words,
he condenses the legacy of the Three Sages,
uniting their diverse threads into a single discourse.
He takes the crucible of Heaven and Earth as the great furnace,
circulates the qi of Kan and Li as the mechanism of transformation.
Following its patterns and emulating its workings,
he declares: "Even Heaven would not oppose this—
how much less man?
How much less spirits and gods?"
Thus, the divine has no fixed form,
and the *Yijing* has no fixed structure.
Can one fail to harmonize their movement and stillness,
follow the ebb and flow of yin and yang,
and accomplish transformation between being and non-being?
How wondrous!

**Chapter 89: Devotion Lies in Following Principle**

Devotion lies in following principle,
manifesting and illuminating the spirit.
Divine transformation flows unimpeded,
bringing peace to the four seas.
Taking it as a model,
all ages may follow.
Ordering it to govern,
its practice is not cumbersome.
Drawing it inward to nurture nature,
embracing the naturalness of the Yellow and the Old.
Those who contain profound virtue
return to the root and revert to the origin.
It lies near in my heart,
not apart from my own body.
Embracing the One and never departing,
one may endure forever.
Paired with dietary practices,
the male and female are arrayed.
Discard the martial cinnabar of Wudu,
cast aside the Eight Stones.

The fire-timing must accord with the principles of yin and yang,
thereby arousing the divine essence,
filling the Golden Palace,
and harmonizing the chamber.
Following the method to govern,
affairs do not become cumbersome,
and all ages may adhere to it.
Let metal and water nurture nature within the Central Palace,
allowing the Yellow and the Old to contain virtue within the inner image.
When metal generates cinnabar mercury,
it returns to foolishness and reverts to the origin.
Embracing the One in the womb,
water gives birth to the mother’s abode.
The maiden longs for her mother,
and thus beginning and end endure forever.
Without arraying the male and female,
resembling the true mother,
no success can be achieved.
If one were to use the martial cinnabar of Wudu,
or the Five Metals and Eight Stones,
all such things may be discarded.

**Chapter 90: Careful Application Brings Things to Fruition**

Careful application brings things to fruition—
what the world treasures.
Arranged in three lines,
branches and stems intertwine.
Though they emerge differently named,
all proceed from a single gate.
Not merely redundant phrases,
this text harmonizes in parallel.
Yet it holds truth within,
like pebbles that may be admired.
If I were to spread falsehoods,
I would only incur superfluous faults.
Entitled *The Union of the Three*,
glimpse but its beginning.
Few words, yet profound meaning—
later generations should adhere to it.
Abandoning the times to avoid harm,
I take refuge in the mountains.
Wandering the vast expanse,
I dwell beside the spirits.
Transforming my form to become immortal,
I sink into silence without sound.
Once in a hundred generations,
I roam among men.
Spreading my feathered wings,
I soar east, west, south, and north.

When Tang faced adversity,
drought and flood divided the wells.
Branches and leaves withered and yellowed,
losing their flourishing splendor.
The virtuous bear one another’s burdens,
and stability may endure forever.

Master Wei urges utmost sincerity in cultivation—
this medicine is the world’s most treasured substance.
The three lines refer to the Green Dragon, White Tiger, and Vermilion Bird—
wood, metal, and fire.
The Returned Elixir is formed from nothing beyond these three,
yet these three are fundamentally only two substances: metal and fire,
not yet the three of wood, metal, and fire.
These are the three inner images,
not external wood, metal, and fire.
Though they bear many names,
they are but metaphors to exhaust principle,
for in truth, they proceed from a single gate.

As the text aligns words and compares matters,
harmonizing in parallel,
its value lies in distinguishing the profound from the shallow,
removing superfluous growths.
Thus, it is entitled *The True Union*,
to glimpse its beginning.
Later generations who adhere to and cultivate it
may dwell in secluded mountains,
choosing a place to settle,
accumulating merit and virtue,
departing from the world and leaving the mundane.
They unite their virtue with Heaven and Earth,
their brightness with the sun and moon,
their order with the four seasons,
their fortune and misfortune with spirits and gods.
Utterly precise and without error,
they elevate their practice.
Thus, the Perfected Lord of Yin sang:
"Without the proper ground, do not act rashly."

One must conceal and guard it in secrecy, carefully preserving and upholding it. Safeguard it lest the celestial and terrestrial mechanisms be lost. Upon attaining the utmost Dao, the body enters formlessness, seated yet alive, standing yet perished. Roaming freely east and west, neither water nor fire obstructs. The calamities of Yao’s floods and Tang’s droughts, the disasters of the nine yangs and six yins—all cease without trace.
