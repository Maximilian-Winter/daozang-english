### **Treatise on the Great Dao**
**By Zhou Gudu**

#### **Chapter on the Supreme Dao**
The Dao is supremely empty and supremely quiescent, the true nature and true constancy. It crowns the five qi and propagates the Three Powers, spreading the One Reality to give rise to the ten thousand images. It is without bounds in separation or union, the ancestral root of Heaven and Earth, transcending the numinous and the luminous, encompassing all without being confined to form or concept. It is nameless and without lineage, yet possesses movement and constancy. It transcends the four propositions and six causes, beyond names, words, and analogies.

The *True Scripture of Southern Florescence* states: *"Beyond the vastness of the Great Void, it is not exalted; beneath the six directions, it is not profound."*

The world has arising and ceasing; the Dao has no arising or ceasing. Things undergo transformation and alteration; the Dao knows no transformation or alteration.

The *Book of Changes* says: *"The Dao is the designation of the empty and the nonexistent."*

As the empty and nonexistent penetrate all things, it is called the Dao—nothing is not pervaded by it, nothing does not proceed from it.

Moreover, the Dao is the Mother, and virtue is the Child.

The *Treasure Scripture of No Delusion* states: *"The Dao pervades things, its meaning lying in nonaction. Virtue does not lose itself, its achievement lying in action."*

The *Scripture of Western Ascent* says: *"The Dao is profoundly abstruse."* And again: *"The Supreme Dao is deeply subtle; those who know it do not speak."*

When fire and water scour and consume without remnant, my Great Dao remains true and constant, unmoved. When the warp and woof of Heaven and Earth unravel and shatter, my Great Dao abides in profound stillness, serene and unchanging.

Zhuangzi calculated and reckoned for five years yet could not exhaust it; he pondered yin and yang for twelve years before finally grasping it—thus it is called the Supreme Dao.

#### **Chapter on the Supreme Virtue**
The Dao possesses the virtue of all-pervading generation, hence it is called Supreme Virtue.

The Sage says: *"Because it pervades generation, it is named the Dao; because it encompasses all, it is called the Great."*

Another explanation: The empty and nonexistent is the essence of the wondrous origin, for it is not a thing. The spontaneous is the nature of the wondrous origin, for it is not artificially made. The Dao is the functioning of the wondrous origin, hence it is called the Dao of all-pervading generation.

The empty and nonexistent, the spontaneous, and the Dao—all three are the true nature of the wondrous origin. The highest principle establishes its law as the One Source.

When the Great Uncarved Block scatters, it governs the nine domains; when the primordial essence is disseminated, it arranges the ten thousand images in their revolutions. The primal qi begins its sway, the Three Powers are fully apportioned, the four seasons commence their succession, and the five phases take turns in ascendancy—how vast!

Heaven and Earth bear the burden of covering and supporting; the sun and moon fulfill their duty of illumination. Wind and rain disperse nourishment; clouds and thunder spread their drumming. Humans and beasts, pure and turbid; seas and mountains, high and deep—all gather in kinds and divide into groups, their wisdom and foolishness differing in endowment.

Those who turn toward the Dao ascend to truth and attain sagehood; those who turn away from it hasten toward death and sink into transmigration—all return to the Supreme Virtue of the Great Dao’s all-pervading generation.

Zhuangzi says: *"Virtue is attainment. Things attain it and thereby live—this is called virtue."*

Virtue is the functioning of the Dao; the Dao is the essence of virtue. In all-pervading generation of the ten thousand images, creation acts and refrains from acting; Supreme Virtue acts not, yet there is nothing it does not do.

The *Record of the Dao of Lord Lao* states: *"Pervade the One, and the ten thousand affairs are complete; attain the mindless, and ghosts and spirits submit."*

That which pervades Heaven and Earth is virtue; that which courses through the ten thousand things is the Dao. The world is supremely pervading.

The ten thousand things are what is generated; virtue is what generates. Without the ten thousand things as what is generated, the generating power of virtue cannot be manifest.

The *Scripture of Great Peace* says: *"Virtue is upright mutual benefaction; completion is the achievement of salvation; non-loss is non-deviation—these three embody the highest principle."*

Moreover, virtue is what Heaven and Earth receive; yin and yang rely upon it; the five phases attain mutual generation through it; the four seasons attain their orderly progression through it. Kings and lords govern and transform; teachers and friends instruct and follow—even sages, perfected ones, immortals, ghosts, and spirits, as well as the myriad kinds of moving and growing things, all depend on the wondrous functioning of Supreme Virtue.

Thus, the Dao possesses sentiment and trustworthiness—this may be called Supreme Virtue.

#### **Chapter on Transmitted Teachings**
In high antiquity, there was no teaching; teaching began with the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors.

Teaching is instruction. It involves speech, principles, meaning, transmission, and conveyance—speech proclaims, teaching instructs. Through speech, one awakens to teaching; through teaching, one clarifies principles. When principles are clear, speech is forgotten. Since there is one who teaches and one who is taught, there must be one who instructs and one who is instructed.

Thus, there are the teachings of spontaneity and the teachings of the numinous and luminous—these two teachings require no master or disciple.

The teachings of the numinous and luminous have grounds for their discourse but no basis in principle.

The teachings of true correctness, the teachings of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, the teachings of returning to the common, and the teachings of instructing the world—these should be distinguished in their provisional and real aspects. All five teachings originate from the One Reality.

The teachings of spontaneity: Before primordial qi, when simplicity was undispersed, there was profound obscurity and quiescence, vast emptiness and boundlessness. No master preached the Dharma, no disciple received transmission. Without beginning or end, without meaning or words—primordial qi attained it and transformed; the numinous and luminous attained it and created; Heaven and Earth attained it and covered and supported; the sun and moon attained it and illuminated. The rulers of high antiquity attained it and ruled through nonaction—this was the transformation without teaching.

The teachings of the numinous and luminous: When simplicity dispersed, it became the numinous and luminous. No vessel is greater than Heaven and Earth; no authority is greater than the numinous and luminous. They blend primordial qi in their revolutions, accord with the Supreme Dao in their regulation, adjust the round and pure to establish Heaven, and fashion the square and turbid to form Earth. They universally pervade and transform the world, surpass harmonious qi to perfect human relations. Yin and yang cannot fathom their arising and ceasing; ghosts and spirits do not know their transformations.

The teachings of true correctness: The Supreme Void Emperor is the master; the Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning transmits the teaching. Passing through the mysteries and purities, it is concealed in the Nine Heavens. Correct transformation is bestowed upon the sages of the age. In the heavens, the Celestial Venerable is honored among the Three Clarities and the host of heavens, greatly propagating the true vehicle and opening the path to immortality. In the human realm, Fuxi received the Chart, Xuanyuan received the Talisman, Gaoxin received the Heavenly Scripture, and Yu of Xia received the Luo Writing. The Four Sages received the numinous and luminous; the Five Elders appeared on the river islets. Thus, there are the Three Tombs and Five Classics—the teachings of the Constant Dao.

The Teachings of Returning to Simplicity:
The Great Sage of the Mysterious Origin, during the reign of Emperor Shun, governed state and family, widely disseminating the numinous scriptures and true precepts among humanity. The golden tablets and jade chapters broadly propagated the Way in the heavens above. His earnest desire was that both heaven and earth return to purity and simplicity, restoring the august wind of antiquity.

The Teachings of Instruction for the World:
The Master lamented the loss of the Dao and virtue, expounding the teachings of benevolence and righteousness to transform the customs of the age. He employed ritual and wisdom to remedy the roots of chaos. Yet the wind of sincerity and depth has long faded, and the current of superficiality and shallowness prevails.

Alas! Teachings arise from the sagely heart that pities the world and cherishes all beings. When the hearts of beings awaken to the teaching, they harmonize with the sagely mind. In the sagely mind, both expedient and real vanish; words and explanations dissolve entirely. Only then does one accord with the teaching beyond speech, where intent and image no longer abide.

**Chapter on Transcending Distinctions**
The Great Dao addresses the cultivator, saying:
Suppose it were named by clan—I have no birthplace, no clan, no surname. Thus, I have no clan.
Suppose it were named by name—restricting the virtue of growth and longevity, it is called the Dao, hidden and not manifest. Its essence and nature are unknown, so it is only named by appellation, not by designation.
Suppose it were ranked by honor and humility—it dwells in modesty and lowliness, emulating Earth, which is not exalted. As a servant, it honors the Dao and esteems virtue, thus not base.
Suppose it were perceived by sight and hearing—it is not a form of color, so it cannot be seen; it is not a sound, so it cannot be heard.
Suppose it were subject to slander or praise—it commits no transgressions, so it cannot be slandered; it bears no arrogance, so it cannot be praised.
Suppose it were affected by benefit or harm—it has no desires, so it cannot be benefited; it is without obstruction, so it cannot be harmed.
Suppose it were judged by right or wrong—it does not follow worldly customs, opposing things, so it has no right; it avoids faults and calamities, so it has no wrong.
Suppose it were opposed by compliance or defiance—defiance is merely not conforming to the world, yet the Dao of Heaven is not defiant.
Suppose it were measured by high or low—it emulates Earth, thus low and not high; it models Heaven, thus high and not low.
Suppose it were measured by great or small—grasping a autumn hair, it is not great; aligning with Heaven and Earth, it is not small.
Suppose it were defined by emptiness or existence—it has function and responds to things, so it is not empty; it is non-action and quiescent, so it is not existent.
Suppose it were ranked by nobility or baseness—it does not boast of merit but awaits destiny, so it is not noble; it precedes Heaven and Earth, so it is not base.
Suppose it were judged by wisdom or foolishness—embracing simplicity, it has no wisdom; containing virtue, it has no foolishness.
Suppose it were ordered by before or after—it has no beginning, so it is not before; it has no end, so it is not after.
Suppose it were distinguished by stillness or chaos—when all virtues manifest, life is not still; when kinds gather and groups divide, it is not chaotic.
Suppose it were defined by gain or loss—externally, there is not a single thing, so nothing is gained; internally, it harmonizes with true nature, so nothing is lost.
Suppose it were bound by love or hatred—it has no aversion, so it does not hate; it has no preference, so it does not love.
Suppose it were oriented by facing or turning away—it is formless, so it does not face; it is one with the Dao, so it does not turn away.
Suppose it were subject to favor or disgrace—it does not boast of merit or parade virtue, so it cannot be favored; it is without arrogance, indolence, or negligence, so it cannot be disgraced.
Suppose it were confined by square or round—it has no boundaries, so it cannot be square; it has no form, so it cannot be round.
Suppose it were distinguished by brightness or darkness—if dim, it is not bright above; perceiving the small is called brightness, so it is not dim below.
Suppose it were judged by new or old—without beginning, it is not new; without end, it is not old.
Suppose it were measured by advance or retreat—it does not advance into emptiness, nor retreat into existence. It does not advance for the superior person, nor retreat for the inferior.

Cultivator, be thus; I, too, am thus. There is no difference between us.

O Dao-disciple, come! O Dao-disciple, come! I fear you will cling to parables, methods, and doctrines, losing the nature of the Dao. I fear beings will grasp the teaching, stagnate in its literal meaning, and calculate existence, becoming entangled in partiality and extremes. The foolish do not realize that when the illness ceases, the medicine is no longer needed. They catch the fish but discard the trap, clinging to the teaching and its words, guarding its metaphors, and losing the harmonious and true constancy.

**Chapter on Distinctions**
The emotions of the heart, the perceptions of consciousness, the intentions of the mind—all arise falsely from the Dao. Beyond the Dao, there is no heart; beyond the heart, there is no Dao. Heart and Dao are one. The same applies to emotions, perceptions, intentions, and knowledge.

Sever the heart that awakens to the Dao; prune the consciousness that recognizes the Dao; loosen the wisdom that verifies the Dao; remove the knowledge that attains the Dao; untangle the intentions that comprehend the Dao. Then, forget knowledge, forget intention, forget wisdom, forget perception, forget the heart. Naturally, there will be no seeking, no pursuing, no learning of the Dao—this is attaining the Dao. This is truly removing the cultivator’s attachments to traces and proximity, truly attaining the Dao, truly attaining the One.

If one clings to the Dao or the One, one strays far from the Dao. If one forgets the Dao and the One, one attains the Dao and the One.

The three bodies differ; the two births are not the same. There is the body of self-nature—the original nature of the Dao. There is the body of function—the Dao and the myriad phenomena as interdependent. There is the body of emulation—like embodying the Dao’s nature through cultivation, reaching non-action.

There are two kinds of birth: the birth that can generate—the Dao giving birth to the myriad things; and the birth that is generated—the myriad things born from the Dao. Those who awaken cultivate; through cultivation, they necessarily attain sagehood. Those who are deluded do not cultivate—they remain ordinary. Those who do not stagnate in sagehood or ordinariness awaken; those who stagnate in sagehood or ordinariness are deluded. Understanding delusion and awakening is emptiness; comprehending sagehood and ordinariness is dissolution.

Thus, transcending form and emptiness, expedient and real, verbal teachings, mutual dependence, distinctions of form, and existence and non-existence—this is truly attaining the Dao.

The Dao is not words or wisdom; it borrows words and wisdom to reach naturalness. Virtue is not action; it relies on action to manifest its true function.

Therefore, open the twenty-four gates to close the five senses. These are:
The Gate of Profound Clarity and Deep Stillness—The body of the Dao is supremely void, profoundly clear and cool, reflecting things without partiality, its mysterious responses hidden and subtle.
The Gate of Heavenly Sage without Mind—Heaven and Earth are impartial, covering and supporting the myriad things, nurturing and growing them without missing their seasons. The sage is impartial, transforming and governing the people, delighting in clarity and peace.
The Gate of Empty Response and Pervasive Connection—The Great Dao is without mind, pervading the myriad existences. Naturally clear and still, it transcends both existence and non-existence.

The Gate of Spirit Unfailing—Subtle existence is pure and still, responding to things without fixed form, never resting even for a moment, as wondrous as the spirit.

The Gate of Deep Stillness and Growth—The myriad things arise and take form from the Dao, drawing sustenance from the transformations of nature.

The Gate of Humility and Benefiting Others—Those who cultivate the Dao are yielding and soft, holding fast to virtue with purity, aiding others without weariness.

The Gate of Single-Minded Unknowing—Embracing and guarding the harmonious unity of qi, not yet discerning the distinctions of worldly affairs.

The Gate of Interdependence of Being and Non-Being—Vacuity borrows form, and form borrows vacuity; being arises from non-being, hence they are said to rely on one another. Heaven and Earth, humans and all phenomena are called "form," which is being; the function of the Dao is non-being.

The Gate of Delusion and Pursuing Phenomena—Worldly people merely covet mundane learning, clinging to action and losing the true source, sinking into the depths of sound and color.

The Gate of Embracing and Holding Fast—Holding to the Dao with the harmony of Earth, expansive and yielding, still and receptive; like an infant holding fast, or a valley embracing all.

The Gate of Crippled Form and Ignorance—Those who boast of skill and parade merit differ not from the crippled; deluded and clinging in darkness, hence called ignorant.

The Gate of Four Analogies in One Teaching—The scriptures say: Those who cultivate the Dao are like one crossing a river, fearful of neighbors yet appearing composed; like ice, pure and cold, serene and silent.

The Gate of Not Acting as Ruler—The emperors of high antiquity governed with pure transformation and impartiality; though all under heaven came to pay homage, they did not boast of their virtue or power, nor claim their own ability.

The Gate of Not Displaying Authority and Wisdom—The laws and strategies by which emperors govern the state must not be shown to others. If unworthy men gain power, they will act with deceit, indulging in cruelty and bringing calamity upon themselves.

The Gate of Not Boasting of Instruments and Tools—The ancient emperors did not flaunt civil or military prowess, nor exalt themselves; embodying the supreme Dao, their minds aligned with non-action.

The Gate of Abiding in the Center Without Preference—Neither dwelling in non-being nor clinging to being, not residing in the dusty world, not fleeing to dull emptiness, not seeking extremes or thoroughness.

The Gate of Probing the Root of Nature—Deeply guarding one’s original nature, one naturally attains longevity; spirit and qi do not scatter, and desires do not arise.

The Gate of Unperturbed Transformation and Governance—When a state relies on many punishments, the people scatter; when it holds to the One, the people are pure. Scattering is the root of chaos; purity is the origin of order. Thus, the scriptures say: Cooking a small fish requires no stirring.

The Gate of Manifesting Virtue Through Things—Active doing and striving are not as good as returning to stillness and non-action; four-horse chariots and jade tablets are not as precious as the great treasure of the numinous vessel.

The Gate of Accumulating from the Subtle to the Manifest—Those newly cultivating the supreme Dao will surely see success; with long vision and longevity, they ascend to the immortal realms.

The Gate of Humility and Great Achievement—Governing a state with humility, the people joyfully support and follow; the myriad families gather to it, thus accomplishing great enterprise.

The Gate of Cultivating the Self and Treasuring Virtue—The scriptures say: Compassion, frugality, and humility are the sources of governing the self and cultivating virtue; greed, malice, flattery, and obsequiousness are the roots of inviting calamity and destroying the self. Thus, virtue is to be treasured.

The Gate of the Skillful Artisan Without Harm—When a ruler metes out punishment, it is not like the commands of Heaven’s seasons—spring, summer, autumn, and winter. To forcibly replace Heaven’s killing is to risk excessive harm. Heaven’s craft is without clumsiness, hence without error.

The Gate of Heaven’s Dao, Level and Universal—Heaven’s Dao suppresses the high and lifts the low, supports the weak and curbs the strong, brings misfortune to the excessive and blessings to the humble, reduces the surplus and supplements the deficient.

Closing the five senses refers to guarding against and discarding intelligence, benevolence, righteousness, skill, and profit.

**Chapter on Near and Far**
The sages wish to establish teachings and reveal principles, hence there are distinctions of nature and capacity. Yet the words of sages are truthful, while the words of ordinary people are deluded; thus, there are advances and retreats, doubts and differences.

The body of the Dao is fundamentally without delusion or enlightenment. Enlightenment has nothing to enlighten; laughter has nothing to laugh at. Advancement does not necessarily bring gain; retreat does not necessarily bring loss. Not seeing the three kinds of scholars—this is the true superior scholar.

Some are near yet know they are near, transforming delusion into enlightenment through close cultivation and learning.

Some know they are near yet do not draw near, constantly speaking of the teaching of non-action yet not practicing non-action—this is knowing nearness yet not drawing near.

Some are near yet do not know they are near, deluded by worldly dust and confused by phenomena, not awakening to the true source, unaware that within the dust lies the subtlest wonder.

Some are far yet do not know they are far, awakening to profound depth yet not clinging to it; depth is not subject to emotion, hence they do not know farness.

Some are far yet know they are far, awakening to depth and knowing that sentient beings possess profound nature; seeing their own bodies as responsive transformations, they expound the Dao to benefit others, merging with depth.

Some practice yet do not arrive, though they have long cultivated and followed the path, their practice is bound by emotion and has not reached the utmost emptiness.

Some do not know practice, not awakening to the teachings and methods, cultivating without a guide’s instruction.

Some do not know arrival, unaware of the gate to the utmost extreme, having no direction to enter, hence not knowing arrival.

Some do not practice yet arrive, not seeing their own practice, not seeing their own arrival, yet mysteriously merging with the root—hence not practicing yet arriving.

Some arrive and transform themselves. Attaining true quiescence, the mysterious virtue shines within; without teaching or words, they naturally become pure and transformed.

**Chapter on Applying the Dao**
Applying the Dao restrains people; the function of the Dao restrains the wondrous root. Forgetting the Dao, one’s virtue is non-action. Forgetting the vacuous, one reaches the utmost extreme. Attaining virtue is like receiving a favor.

People emulate the Dao and follow virtue, aligning with the function of nature. Human life arises as the Dao’s qi is bestowed, the purest essence granted as spirit; the Three Origins congeal the spirit, the Five Phases coalesce into purity. Having received the essence of being, one is endowed with the function of non-being. In the time of small simplicity, no thing dares resist; holding the great image, all forms come forth.

Those of the same Dao and same virtue are yielding and firm like infants, abiding in the wondrous mystery of the Mysterious Female. Without dividing mind and phenomena, they equalize life and death, harmonizing with the natural movements of Heaven and Earth, the fluctuations of yin and yang.

The rulers of high antiquity who applied the Dao were empty-minded and benefited others, embodying the Dao to transform the people. They oversaw the four directions universally, mastered the six penetrations independently, cut off seeing and hearing, dismissed cleverness and brightness. They did not bind teachings with stagnant words, nor congeal emotions by clinging to things. They planted the root of the Three Ones, firmly establishing growth in the true source; they pruned the sprouts of the Four Sixes, severing the spreading vines in the numinous palace. They did not boast of great skill in achievement, nor did they pursue the eloquence of small success.

The Lower Canon states: "Stillness is the rectitude of all under Heaven."
The *Nanhua Sutra* says: The Dao is affective and trustworthy, non-actional and formless; it may be transmitted but not received, attained but not seen.
Thus, the Sovereign of Xiwei grasped it to harness Heaven and Earth; Fuxi obtained it to inherit the Mother of Qi; the Yellow Emperor attained it to ascend the cloudy heavens; Zhuanxu secured it to dwell in the Mysterious Palace. Even unto the Dipper’s Handle, Kanpei, Yushang, and Pengzu—all applied the Dao and employed it, ascending to the fruit of sageliness.
Thus we know: sages, spirit-men, immortals, ghosts and spirits, Heaven and Earth, sun and moon, stars and constellations, the myriad things—if they did not attain and employ the Dao, they would lack the numinous penetration to rise lightly, the hidden profundity to cover and bear, the luminous singularity to oversee and nurture life.
Moreover, the Dao collaborates with Heaven to command covering, with Earth to command bearing, with sun and moon to command illumination. Whatever has use, the Dao grants it use.
The Dao names Heaven as "pure," Earth as "tranquil," valleys as "full," things as "living." Thus use and name alike are the Dao’s mandates.
Therefore, humans emulate Earth, Earth emulates Heaven, Heaven emulates the Dao, and the Dao emulates spontaneity.

**Chapter on the Two Teachings**
Know that worldly learning is detrimental: worldly learning clings to realms and stagnates scholars. Without entering the true vision, it profits nothing for the Dao—hence it is detrimental.
True learning is beneficial: the mind merges with the ultimate Dao, the body enters the Double Mystery, not dwelling in the three states—hence it is beneficial.
Yet true learning may be detrimental: gradual cultivation of the Dao’s practice requires shedding defiled passions and desires—hence it is called detrimental, for it diminishes passions and desires.
Or worldly learning may be beneficial: through worldly teachings one gradually enters true teachings, attains the Dao and awakens to reality, moving from the worldly to the true—hence it is called beneficial.
Some harm themselves to benefit others: entering the mysterious realm, transcending worldly questions, others witnessing this also cultivate, and through cultivation attain the Dao—hence it is called benefiting others.
Some are harmed by others yet benefit themselves: seeing cultivators attain the Dao, they also diligently practice; when merit and conduct are complete, they awaken to the profound mystery—hence it is called self-benefit.
To return from being to non-being is difficult; to enter non-being from non-being is easy. The teaching of non-action is of great benefit.
Cultivators who preserve non-being and forget being do not equal those who forget both benefit and harm, who dissolve being and non-being equally. Only by attaining the source can one inwardly illumine the great clarity and accomplish the great transformation.

**Chapter on the Two Afflictions**
Regarding the Dao, there is affliction and non-affliction—hypothetically asking whether cultivators of the Dao have affliction or not.
Knowing emptiness yet not clinging to emptiness is non-affliction; not grasping emptiness or being is non-affliction.
Knowing emptiness yet clinging to emptiness is affliction; emptiness becoming entangled with emotion is affliction.
Not knowing emptiness is affliction; grasping being while feigning emptiness is affliction.
Knowing emptiness yet not cultivating emptiness is affliction; having understanding without practice is also affliction.
Knowing emptiness and cultivating emptiness is non-affliction; having both understanding and practice is thus non-affliction.
Not clinging to emptiness or to cultivating emptiness is equal to non-affliction: first awakening to emptiness, then broadly cultivating emptiness, cultivating until there is no cultivation—equaling non-clinging.
Regarding the Dao, this is affliction.
There are degrees of depth: the affliction of clinging to emptiness and the affliction of grasping being are deep afflictions; clinging to emptiness while grasping being—both afflictions are profound.
Knowing emptiness yet not cultivating emptiness is a shallow affliction.
If those of superior capacity cultivate emptiness without clinging to emptiness, their affliction is shallow; those of middling capacity who cultivate emptiness and cling to emptiness have deep affliction.
Drowning in emptiness and stagnating in quiescence while aiding the world—though there is grasping of being—some awaken to emptiness without clinging to emptiness while saving the world, possessing dual natures.
Thus there is no fixed sameness: those who cling to the nature of emptiness are of middling capacity.

**Chapter on Master and Resource**
The *Daoist Canon* states: The good person is the teacher of the ungood person; the ungood person is the resource of the good person.
To be a teacher, there are methods to grasp and conduct to follow. One may take the great roots of virtue, Dao, ritual, and music, and place them above the three supreme reverences of ruler, father, and teacher.
A teacher possesses the Dao, virtue, wisdom, and benevolence—these four excellences.
With the Dao, one is penetrating and upright; with virtue, one is spiritually clear; with wisdom, one observes the moment; with benevolence, one pities beings—such may be called a master-father.
As a teacher, one is elder and ruler; in advancing the Dao, one becomes true and immortal.
How could this refer only to teaching masters? It is also the treasure of the state.
How wondrous—the good person!
The ungood person is deluded, confused, desirous, and merciless—these four non-excellences.
Not drawing near to orthodox teachings but pursuing heterodox texts is called delusion.
Rejecting perfected beings while allying with the benighted and foolish is called confusion.
Indulging in the five dusts and colluding with the six thieves is called desire.
Lacking a heart to pacify people and pity things, possessing the nature of aconite and owl venom—this is called mercilessness.
Such may be called the resource of the good person.
Thus one may know the rise and decline of teachings, the difficulty and ease of awakening and learning. The good person brings peace and delights in companionship, does not conceal learning but venerates the master, bears the sorrow of oversight, endures the toil of diligence. If one reaches the ultimate and penetrates emptiness, then love and attachment are both forgotten, mind and realm are both dissolved. The wordless teaching—how distant can it be?
Before the one qi and two images, there was profound obscurity and nothingness; after the division of the five supremes and three talents, the sounds of teaching gradually flowed forth.
Returning to simplicity and restoring purity, joy lies in the root of non-action’s transformation. Attaining truth and verifying sageliness, one roams the profound mystery of the Double Mystery.
The Heavenly Worthy transmitted the Dao to the host of immortals; Lord Lao opened the mystery to the myriad states, guiding the black-haired people to the realm of longevity, leading all within the four seas to the river of blessings.
Someone asked: Since ancient times, have emperors and kings who attained and employed the Dao done so naturally, or through a master?
I replied: The teachers of the Upper Three Sovereigns were the Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Center; the teachers of the Middle Three Sovereigns were the Ancient Masters; the teachers of the Lower Three Sovereigns were the Imperial Lords of the Golden Portal.
Fuxi’s teacher was Yuhua Zi; Shennong’s teacher was Dacheng Zi; Zhurong’s teacher was Guangshou Zi; the Yellow Emperor’s teacher was Guangcheng Zi; Zhuanxu’s teacher was Chijing Zi; Emperor Ku’s teacher was Lutu Zi; Emperor Yao’s teacher was Wucheng Zi; Emperor Shun’s teacher was Yinshou Zi; Yu of Xia’s teacher was Zhenxing Zi; Tang of Yin’s teacher was Xize Zi; King Wen of Zhou’s teacher was Xieyi Zi; King Wu’s teacher was Yucheng Zi; King Cheng’s teacher was Wuguang Zi; King Kang’s teacher was Guoshu Zi; Confucius’ teacher was Laozi.

From the age of pristine simplicity to the era of decadent customs, spanning the nine heavens in height and encompassing the eight directions in breadth, through the reigns of the Three Sovereigns, Five Emperors, Three Kings, and Five Hegemons—without the guidance of sages, perfected beings, or immortals, who followed the regulations of their teachers and refined themselves through the supreme teachings, none could transcend the mortal realm and ascend to perfection.

Furthermore, the *Guangyi* states: When Lord Lao sought to manifest the great teaching and spread transformation throughout the ten thousand directions, he declared, "The Dao cannot lack a revered teacher, nor can the teaching lack a founding master." Thus, Lord Lao took the Most High Jade Dawn Great Dao Lord as his teacher. The Great Dao Lord, together with five hundred million Heavenly Lords and countless sacred sovereigns, took the Primordial Heavenly Venerable as their teacher.

Moreover, Lord Lao embodies boundless greatness, boundless wisdom, boundless divine power, and boundless teachings; his Dao is inexhaustible, and his lifespan spans kalpas. Yet even he received instruction from a teacher to verify the truth and benefit all beings. How then can worldly people, without seeking a teacher or cultivating in accordance with the teachings, hope to have their names inscribed in the registers of immortals or ascend beyond the Nine Mysteries to the Three Clarities?

**Chapter on Humaneness and Righteousness**
The Five Phases are what humans receive as the nature of the Five Constants, the virtues of emperors and kings. The nature of humaneness corresponds to wood, aligning with the virtue of spring’s growth. The nature of propriety corresponds to fire, harmonizing with the virtue of summer’s nurturance. The nature of righteousness corresponds to metal, aligning with the virtue of autumn’s sternness. The nature of wisdom corresponds to water, harmonizing with the virtue of winter’s concealment. Embracing these true constants deeply accords with the transformations of Fuxi and Shennong. Embodying this supreme Dao naturally gives rise to the winds of humaneness and righteousness.

Holding harmonious qi and containing spirit and numen, one forms a nature and substance from the yang of heaven and the yin of earth. Substance is the division of form. Master Haozi said: Yang Xiong, Ban Gu, and their ilk, who claimed that Daoists slight humaneness and righteousness, disparage propriety and wisdom, and focus solely on purity and emptiness, were世儒 who failed to grasp the profound intent of the mysterious sages.

Humaneness is partial love; righteousness is the correction of wrongs. When decadence first arises, the Dao becomes superficial and thin. The *Tian Yun* states: "The utmost humaneness borrows the Way from humaneness and lodges temporarily in righteousness, like a lotus hut not meant for long dwelling, or straw dogs not to be reused." The *Upper Scripture* says: "When the great Dao declines, humaneness and righteousness arise." It also says: "Abandon sageliness and discard wisdom."

Confucius asked the Fisherman: "What is the real?" The Fisherman replied: "The real is the utmost sincerity. Without sincerity, one cannot move others. Thus, the real is inner utmost sincerity." Confucius taught humaneness and righteousness, transforming people through ritual and music—this is not the real.

*Zhuangzi* says: "The utmost propriety does not enter people; the utmost righteousness does not attach to things; the utmost wisdom does not scheme; the utmost humaneness has no partiality; the utmost trust dispenses with pledges." The Dao is obscured by minor achievements; words are obscured by superficial falsity. Moreover, the Dao is primary, while humaneness and righteousness are secondary. Armies and weapons are the dregs of virtue; rewards, punishments, and the five penalties are the dregs of teaching; ritual, law, and names are the dregs of governance; bells, drums, and feathered banners are the dregs of music; hempen mourning garments and wounds are the dregs of unity.

Harming the world by emphasizing the secondary and neglecting the root: if one follows natural emotions and human nature without losing constancy, discarding ritual yet maintaining a serene and harmonious will, ceasing music yet keeping the heart from excess, abolishing humaneness yet dissolving love and hatred, eradicating righteousness yet forgetting right and wrong—then one may empty the heart of the winds of ancient simplicity, restrain sharp thoughts from the paths of secondary learning, dwell in the forefront of nature and knowledge as the origin of decadence, and strike the Dao’s loss as the source of chaos. This leads to Zhuang Kuang’s superfluous toes and fingers, casts Zeng and Shi into the misfortune of tumors and growths—how could one not blame the craftsmen of humaneness and righteousness and condemn the sages?

**Chapter on Losing the Dao**
The wondrous origin is spontaneous, its essence and nature empty and nonexistent; fundamentally, there is no attainment and no loss. Yet, in relation to humans, one receives harmonious qi and contains the Dao to become human. In high antiquity, nature was pure and substance simple. From the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors onward, the original truth was lost. Emperors and kings acted with intention, and the people’s nature changed. After the Dao was lost, humaneness, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and power prevailed.

Moreover, the movement and stillness of heaven and earth: if heaven did not move and revolve, it could not arrange the sun, moon, and stars, nor manifest the virtue of the Five Phases and Four Seasons’ nurturance. If earth were not tranquil and still, it could not firmly bear the growth of living things, nor provide the virtue on which the myriad beings, mountains, and rivers depend. This is the transformation of embodying the great Dao and spontaneity.

The *Book of Changes* says: "The Supreme Ultimate generates the Two Modes; the Two Modes generate the Three Powers; the Three Powers generate the myriad beings." Their application and craftsmanship bring forth flourishing nurturance—this is the function of the Dao. Where the Dao abides, there is life; where the Dao departs, there is death. The Dao cannot be separated from; what can be separated is not the Dao.

Humans are born tranquil—this is the nature of heaven and earth. Nature is originally pure and still. If one gallops amid the six dusts and rushes through the three karmas, the numinous terrace is not established, the celestial light is not bright, and one loses nature, sinking into birth and death. Acting evilly in the open, humans punish it; acting evilly in secret, ghosts punish it. This is losing the Dao.

Thus, when heaven loses the Dao, there is yang turbulence. When earth loses the Dao, there is yin dissipation. When spirits lose the Dao, their numinosity ceases and perishes. When valleys lose the Dao, their flowing waters dry up. When the myriad beings lose the Dao, there is no growth. When the Son of Heaven loses the Dao, he loses the world. When feudal lords lose the Dao, they lose their states. When people lose the Dao, they lose their lives.

The Dao is empty yet used; harmonious qi is empty and vacuous, thus serving the Dao’s function. Emptiness and harmony reside in the center—do not lose the nature of emptiness and harmony.

**Chapter on the Conduct of the Heart**
The heart has four aspects: the deluded heart, the awakened heart, the cultivated heart, and the verified heart.

The deluded heart has ten kinds: delusion about affairs, delusion about principles, delusion about teachings, delusion about realms, delusion about qi, delusion about the body, delusion about spirit, delusion about immortality, delusion about the real, and delusion about sageliness.

Delusion about affairs refers to being unable to discern and comprehend all conditioned affairs, whether good or evil, thus generating a confused, attached, and bewildered heart. Lacking the wisdom to employ one’s nature in discerning and choosing, one falls into the cycle of birth and death without reaching the true source.

**The Scripture of Western Ascension** states: "The Dao probes the most profound, the abyss of emptiness and non-being."
**Laozi** says: "Profound indeed, it seems the ancestor of the myriad things."

**Delusion about principles** refers to having no perception or understanding of the wondrous, empty, and ultimate essence, the natural and true nature, nor of awakening, cultivation, verification, and realization—hence it is called the heart deluded about principles.

**The heart deluded about teachings** arises when the sages intend to guide beings to turn from the mundane toward the real, transforming opposition into accord. As the commentary states: "The Dao values non-action, while people value action; the Dao is fundamentally without emotion or desire, while people cling to desire and emotion." Without encountering a wise teacher or enlightened companion to open the heart, inspire, and point out the teachings of the Three Vehicles—Jade Purity, Numinous Treasure, and Cavernous Spirit—one remains unaware of the sages' wondrous doctrines. Even if one encounters them, one does not generate joy or diligence in seeking and practicing, nor does one contemplate, examine, and investigate the principles to cultivate the heart of liberation. Such a heart exists in name only, as if absent.

**Laozi** says: "The Dao models itself on spontaneity." Those who attain it can speak of it; those who hear it can discourse on it. Yet those who speak do not know that the sage abides in non-action and practices the teaching without words.

**The heart deluded about realms** has two aspects: delusion about the true realm and delusion about the illusory realm. The true realm is the wondrous, fundamental, and spontaneous essence of the great Dao, yet it is obscured by illusion, cutting one off from the true source and severing one from the dust of defilement. As the **Classic** states: "Constantly without desire, one observes its mystery; constantly with desire, one observes its manifestations."

The **illusory heart** refers to the afflictions of the six senses, the three karmic actions, and the ten unwholesome deeds—discriminating and pursuing conditioned existence in vain. As the **Scripture** says: "Do not see what can be desired, and the heart will not be disturbed." The **Scripture of Western Ascension** states: "Those who accumulate evil invite evil qi; those who accumulate goodness invite good qi. Those who accumulate goodness are aided by numinous spirits, for the heavenly Dao assists the good."

**The heart deluded about qi** arises when people receive the harmonious qi of heaven and earth, which may be clear or turbid. Those who receive clear qi are wise; those who receive turbid qi are foolish. The **Scripture of Fixed Contemplation** says: "One who extends life for thousands of years is called an immortal; one who refines form into qi is called a perfected person; one who refines qi into spirit is called a spirit person; one who refines spirit to merge with the Dao is called a sage."

People are deluded about the original harmony and true nature, failing to nurture spirit and cherish qi. Thus, the **Expansive Meaning** states: "The Dao is non-being; form is being. Being is subject to decay, while non-being endures forever. Those who cultivate the Dao externally secure their form to treasure their being, while internally they preserve their spirit to honor their non-being. By uniting with non-being to merge with the Dao, they attain longevity. Form is the yin po; spirit is the yang hun. Ordinary people possess a modicum of yang qi, yet it does not suffice for immortality; with a modicum of yin qi, they do not attain sagehood. When yin qi is exhausted, one ascends to the ranks of immortals—immortals are pure yang. When yang qi perishes, one becomes a ghost—a ghost is yin qi."

The **Classic** says: "Concentrate your qi to attain suppleness—can you be like a newborn babe?" When yang qi is inwardly abundant and one guards the One with virtue, possessing virtue enables one to govern a state; governing a state enables one to embody the Dao; embodying the Dao enables one to govern and transform; governing and transforming enables one to pacify the people. When the people are at peace, the state is at peace, and naturally, all is secure and harmonious. The **Classic** says: "In loving the people and governing the state, can you practice non-action?"

**Delusion about the body** has two meanings: first, not knowing that within the body there is qi, spirit, and consciousness, which can be refined through immortal practices to attain the fruit of immortality, through true practices to attain the fruit of perfection, and through sagely practices to attain the fruit of sagehood. The **Scripture of Western Ascension** says: "The sage is constantly at peace, at one with heaven and earth, and communicates with ghosts and spirits. The multitude are at peace only in what they deem peaceful; what they deem not peaceful is not peaceful to them."

Second, delusion about the body arises when the body is empty of the myriad things, and the heart’s emptiness allows harmonious qi to return to goodness. Those who nurture the body conceal it within itself without revealing it, hide the person within others without being seen. Thus, the sage places the self last yet finds it foremost, sets the self aside yet preserves it. Not knowing the body as the root of suffering, this is called delusion about the body.

**Delusion about spirit** refers to spirit as that which is unfathomable in yin and yang, wondrous in function without fixed form, hidden or manifest, transforming and penetrating without limit—this is called spirit. In heaven, it is called *shen*; on earth, it is called *qi*; in humans, it is called *gui*. The numinous spirit and consciousness within beings cannot refine spirit to merge with the Dao and ascend to sagely fruition. **Zhuangzi** says: "The myriad things follow their nature and each attains its life."

**Delusion about immortality** is the failure to cultivate immortal practices. **Delusion about the real** is the failure to cultivate true practices. **Delusion about sageliness** is the failure to cultivate sagely practices.

**The awakened heart** is the heart that awakens to the Dao. **The cultivated heart** is the heart that cultivates the Dao. **The verified heart** is the heart that verifies the Dao.

When the heart severs entangling thoughts, the mind severs false imaginings, and wisdom severs discrimination, then true seeing sees all, while perverse seeing fails to see; true hearing hears all, while perverse hearing fails to hear; true awareness is aware of all, while perverse awareness fails to be aware; true knowing knows all, while perverse knowing fails to know. If true and perverse are both extinguished, and knowing and awareness are both forgotten, one attains the state of forgetting the heart and forgetting the realm. When heart and realm are both forgotten, one merges obscurely with the Dao.

The **Scripture of Inner Contemplation** says: "The heart is neither blue nor red, neither white nor yellow, neither long nor short, neither round nor square. Vast, it encompasses heaven and earth; minute, it enters the tip of a hair. Restrained, it halts; released, it rages. Pure and still, it lives; turbid and agitated, it perishes. Illuminating, it shines to the eight limits; obscured, it is deluded in one direction. The difficulty in subduing humans lies solely in the heart. Thus, teaching people to cultivate the Dao is to cultivate the heart; teaching people to cultivate the heart is to cultivate the Dao.

The heart cannot be stilled—one stills it by contemplating the Dao. The heart cannot be seen—one clarifies it through the Dao. The two paths of good and evil, all worldly dharmas, arise and perish through the heart. Those who practice the Dao extinguish the heart to merge with the Dao; worldly people indulge the heart and endanger the self."

The heart, when active, brings chaos; when extinguished, brings order. Thus, the Son of Heaven establishes officials, clarifies laws, institutes punishments and rewards, and displays fortune and misfortune to encourage people—all because the heart is difficult to govern. Those without a heart are not swayed by commands. Those with a settled heart are not confused by commands. Those who still the heart do not act recklessly. Those who restrain the heart do not fall into disorder. Those who rectify the heart do not stray. Those with a cool heart are not defiled. Those with an empty heart are not attached. Understanding these seven principles, one may speak of the Dao and discuss the cultivation of the heart.

**Cultivating the Dao**
A person who possesses the Dao is like an echo in a valley. Cultivating the Dao ensures attainment, just as calling out ensures a response. A sharp cry elicits a sharp echo—this illustrates the diligence of superior practitioners. A slow call elicits a slow echo—this illustrates the hesitation of middling practitioners. When the call ceases and no echo responds, this illustrates the neglect of inferior practitioners. Without cultivation, the Dao remains distant.

Thus, the sage embraces the profound fullness of loving containment and self-knowledge, while discarding the superficial vanity of the eyes and self-regard. The echo in the valley, like the wondrous and inexhaustible power of spirit, also illustrates longevity and enduring vision. Hence it is said: *"The valley spirit does not die—this is called the Mysterious Female."*

Those who diligently cultivate the Dao refine yin with yang, but if yin qi becomes excessive while yang qi sinks and hides, harmonious qi dissipates, malevolent forces take residence, and aging, illness, suffering, and death swiftly follow. Better to refine yang with yin, reversing old age to return to infancy, confusion to enlightenment, deviation to rectitude, and nothingness to being. The key lies in seeking a teacher, studying diligently, following teachings, and practicing in quiet mountain forests, embracing profound stillness. First, one masters the Orthodox Unity; next, enters the Cavernous Spirit; then advances through the Wondrous Mystery and Numinous Treasure, swiftly attaining the purity of the Cavernous Perfection. Through breath regulation, guiding and stretching, and myriad practices, one ascends to the ultimate fruit of immortality.

**Preserving Life**
Harmonious qi and spirit-consciousness follow form in life and death, yet the spirit’s nature is truly without birth or death. When form gathers, life arises; when form scatters, death follows. *Zhuangzi* says: *"There is life, there is death; there is going out, there is coming in. In going out and coming in, no form is seen—this is called the Gate of Heaven."*

There is external nurturing and internal nurturing. Internal nurturing reaches the ultimate of life and death, while external nurturing serves as the master of all things. External nurturing sustains others; internal nurturing sustains oneself. To harmonize with neither life nor death requires the greatest nurturing talent.

All material beings die when qi scatters and live when qi gathers. Though qi differs in gathering and scattering, spirit knows no distinction of birth and death. Thus, through spirit one employs qi, and through qi one nourishes spirit. When gathered, they unite in accomplishment; when scattered, each operates independently.

*Zhuangzi’s "Knowledge Wanders North"* records Shun’s reply: *"The body is not yours—it is the entrusted form of heaven and earth. Life is not yours—it is the entrusted harmony of heaven and earth. Nature and destiny are not yours—they are the entrusted compliance of heaven and earth."* Heaven and earth bind qi to generate a single qi, which flows in compliance above and below.

Awakening to the body, to life, and to nature and destiny, one understands the entrusted form, harmony, and compliance. Thus, when heaven and earth’s qi gathers, life arises; when it scatters, death follows. Life and death are based on qi’s gathering and scattering—a provisional distinction—yet all emerge from formlessness. Formlessness is the true constancy, hence without birth or death.

Now, preserving life means governing the arising of emotions and desires. If emotions and desires arise, they obstruct the true and constant nature. Just as preserving life is thus, so too is governing a state.

If one extensively employs schemes, expands territory, accumulates wealth, and exalts palaces, indulging in ease, luxury, and endless craftiness, one loses the pure and true nature. Once the true nature is lost, true transformation fails, madness and deviance enter the heart, and one cannot rectify oneself, losing authority. Having lost authority, flatterers gain influence, and one not only forgets the principle of preserving life but also forfeits the way to sustain the state’s prosperity. If the body is free from illusory burdens, lifespan extends; ancestral temples endure, and the state remains eternally secure.

Those who preserve life also preserve the state; those who cultivate the Dao also preserve life. This begins by diminishing right and wrong, abandoning arrogance, curbing desires, and forgetting fame and profit. Then, one defends against the assaults of the five colors in the colorless, the five sounds in the soundless, and the five flavors in the tasteless. Do not gallop through the six dusts or rush through the three realms. When ears and eyes perceive nothing, the heart cuts off thought, qi flows harmoniously, spirit does not leave the body, and the body does not leave the spirit. Spirit and body guard each other, and the path of immortality and long life is achieved—the way of preserving life is fulfilled.

Perceiving the emptiness of sound and color, awakening to the insubstantiality of form, with spirit clear and will tranquil, virtue profound and Dao lofty, one does not sink into the pitfalls of life and death but naturally arrives at the boundless mystery.

*The Scripture of Western Ascension* says: *"To pity others is not as good as cherishing the body; to cherish the body is not as good as loving the spirit; to love the spirit is not as good as containing the spirit; to contain the spirit is not as good as guarding the true. Guarding the true ensures long endurance."*

It also says: *"The spirit loves people, but people do not love the spirit."* Thus, Laozi teaches people to nurture spirit and qi—this is the art of preserving life.

**Governing the State**
Governing the world, the state, the family, or the self—none can be rectified without virtue and the Dao. A state governed by non-action simplifies affairs; governed by action, affairs multiply. Simplified affairs calm the heart; multiplied affairs confuse the people. A calm heart stabilizes the state; a confused people endanger it. To leave danger and attain stability, tranquility is the Dao.

The *Scripture* states: *"Thus the sage embraces the One and becomes the model for all under heaven."* It also says: *"Know the white, yet guard the black, and become the model for all under heaven."* Following heaven and emulating earth, they expand the work of nurturing and sustaining, yet forget their merit and form, never presuming to exalt themselves above the world. The *Scripture* further says: *"One who values their body for the sake of the world may be entrusted with the world; one who cherishes their body for the sake of the world may be confided with the world."* It also states: *"The sage does not act great, and thus achieves greatness; acting without attachment, accomplishing without dwelling. Bearing the nation’s disgrace, they become the lord of the altars of soil and grain; bearing the nation’s misfortune, they become the king of all under heaven."* Only then, regarding the common people as straw dogs, governing a great state as if frying a small fish—such is Laozi’s solemn exhortation. They do not exalt the worthy, do not prize treasures, regard all things as equal, and take humility as their foundation. They do not indulge in warfare, lighten taxes and corvée, avoid arrogance and pride, and eschew extravagance and excessive desires. They know that those who secretly indulge in wine and lust within the imperial domain, who exhaust the farming and weaving masses, who covet rare treasures and exotic beasts from distant lands, and who wear out the people of water and land—such rulers do not uphold the Dao and virtue, and their states cannot be well-governed. Governing the world with non-action and transformation brings order; governing with action breeds the seeds of chaos. The *Scripture of Great Peace* says: *"Only in purity and stillness does one know the origin of the governing Dao."* The Heavenly Perfected One said to the Yellow Emperor: *"I have never heard of one who governs their body yet fails to govern their state."* The body of one person is the image of a state: the position of the chest and abdomen is like the palace, the limbs like the suburbs and borders, the joints like the hundred officials, the spirit like the ruler, and qi like the people. To know how to govern the body is to know how to govern the state. Loving the people brings stability to the state; comprehending qi preserves the body. What is lost cannot be restored; the dead cannot be revived. Thus, the perfected one dissolves calamities before they arise and governs illnesses before they manifest. Qi is difficult to nurture yet easy to disperse; the people are difficult to gather yet easy to scatter. Govern before matters arise, not after they have passed.

**The Two Methods**
The two methods of the vast and the subtle: the spirit is subtle while qi is vast; qi is subtle while form is frail. Refining conduct and cultivating the true, seeking the supreme Dao—one may refine form to merge with qi, refine qi to merge with spirit, and refine spirit to unite with the Dao. Cultivating spirit without cultivating qi leads to the extinction of qi and the end of form. Cultivating qi without cultivating spirit merely prolongs life, yet the Dao remains distant. Absorbing qi and refining the heart, harmonizing the pure and true, practicing breath control and meditation, stillness attaining great harmony—spirit and qi flow unimpeded, the mind’s terrace becomes radiant and vast, the elixir scene settles and congeals. The ordinary form then reverts to the true body—why wait for another life? Moreover, delusion makes one ordinary; awakening makes one a sage. One may employ the Three Vehicles—Small, Medium, and Great—to traverse the subtle and vast, or ascend through the Three Clarities to experience their vastness and subtlety, or pass through the Nine Heavens to do the same, or refine the Five Qi to traverse their health and subtlety, or align with the Three Powers to experience their frailty and subtlety, or observe the gates of perception to discern their vastness and subtlety, or divide the hun and po to distinguish their refinement, or take form as frail and the formless as subtle, or take the Dao and virtue as subtle and benevolence and righteousness as coarse. The *Scripture* says: *"The greatest image has no form."* The *Western Ascension Scripture* states: *"Nothing in the world is softer than qi; nothing is softer than the Dao."* The Dao is the substance of non-action; qi is formed by yin and yang. The Dao envelops heaven and earth and permeates the ten thousand methods. The *Scripture of Southern Florescence* says: *"It encompasses all without exclusion, entering subtly into the finest details."*

**Observation and Cultivation**
To observe is to observe the illusory, dreamlike body; to cultivate is to cultivate the conduct of the Dao and virtue. Forgetting the body and forgetting cultivation, one naturally enters the realm of mysterious penetration. Bound to form and conduct, one sinks into the source of life and death. Observation is wisdom. With wisdom, one observes principle; principle and wisdom merge, naturally aligning with the Middle Way. The *Scripture of the Origin* says: *"Possessing all wisdom, one accomplishes the supreme Dao."* Using the eyes to see things is called observation; using the spirit to reflect is called observation. Externally, one withers the ten thousand images; internally, one stills the myriad thoughts—cultivating the heart and myriad practices is called observation. Cultivation leads to entering the wondrous and formless, gradually ascending the sagely path—this is the way of practice. The *Scripture of Karmic Retribution* says: *"Tormented by all suffering, constantly bound to the body, trapped in the cycle of birth and death, unable to escape—by what means can delusive thoughts be eliminated?"* The Most High said: *"Delusive thoughts and inversions all arise from the heart. Forcibly creating distinctions, fixating on the self, encountering circumstances and becoming confused—every thought is delusion. By this, one drifts and sinks into the cycle of birth and death. One should instead focus the mind and observe the body, seeing it as entirely illusory. Once knowing its illusory nature, delusive thoughts gradually fade; once delusive thoughts fade, inner and outer become pure. Awakening to the Dao is called forgetting the body; having forgotten the body, the illusions of bondage naturally vanish."* *Zhuangzi* said: *"Abiding in timeliness and following nature, even a single morning’s joy does not intrude—this is the perfected one’s forgetting of the body."* From the ordinary to the sagely, none surpass the four methods of seeing, cultivating, accomplishing, and benefiting. Seeing has two aspects: first, encountering good companions and discussing true scriptures, or personally studying the teachings and advancing in practice; second, inwardly perceiving the subtle and mysterious, gradually attaining purity and stillness, reaching the utmost wonder. Cultivation has three aspects: the Small Vehicle, the Medium Vehicle, and the Great Vehicle. Accomplishment has three aspects: the fruit of immortality, the fruit of the true, and the fruit of the sage. Benefiting has three aspects: those who attain the three fruits each expound the teachings, guiding all beings and benefiting the age. These four methods arise from the unexcelled Dharma and enter the unexcelled Dharma, existing for the sake of benefiting and saving. Merging into the wondrous body, they return to the One—without right observation, there is no cultivation or realization.

The Treatise on the Great Dao Concludes
