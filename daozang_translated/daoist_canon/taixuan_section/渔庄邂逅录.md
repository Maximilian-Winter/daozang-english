*The Fisherman’s Lodge Encounter*
*Recorded by Ziranzi of Gaogai Mountain*

In the mid-autumn month of the ren-chen year of the Qiandao reign (1172), Ziranzi of Gaogai Mountain met Yu Zhongmou of Jinling at West Lake. By chance, they encountered the Registrar, Master Liu, at the Fisherman’s Lodge. Though they had first met in the ding-mao year (1167), they now found themselves seated together once more.

Master Liu remarked that the previous night, he had dreamed of the Perfected Wang of Fuzhou, whose words remained unfinished—yet today, Ziranzi’s discourse on the Dao seemed to align with them as if by tally. Ziranzi recalled that in his youth, he had once dreamed of the Three Mao Lords, who bestowed upon him the oral instructions of the elixir. A decade later, he encountered Master Wang, who transmitted to him the essentials of the *Scripture of Gold and Azure*. Master Liu, in particular, revered the Three Mao Lords with utmost devotion, leading Ziranzi to suspect that this was the resonance of his earlier dream.

The essentials of the *Scripture of Gold and Azure* comprise the secret formula of the Great Dragon-Tiger Elixir of Shennong, a method by which all the immortals of antiquity attained transcendence. Later generations established their own scriptures—no fewer than a hundred—all transmitted by the ancient sages to enlighten those who came after. Even today, a true gentleman does not betray his conscience within, nor shame his form without; he does not deceive Heaven above nor break his word below. How could the ancient sages and perfected ones have founded empty texts to delude future generations?

Alas, the people of this world are dull of root, clinging to delusion and error, their foolishness so inverted as to evoke profound pity. As the ancients said: *"There are no muddled immortals in Heaven."* Truly, these words ring true.

For the cultivation of the elixir, three like-minded individuals are required to succeed. Ziranzi has sought the Great Dao amidst the sea of humanity, searching for kindred spirits for nearly twenty-eight years, yet has found none who could harmonize with him. The ancient immortals declared: *"Three of shared aspiration may refine the elixir."* Former companions on the path—Li Qiliang and Wang Jifu—have since passed away, leaving only Hu Ruogu. Though they tested the method together and saw results, their strength fell short; their gains were few, and success eluded them.

Now, having chanced upon a kindred spirit, and with dreams so aligned, could this not be the work of predestined affinity? Thus, they formed a bond as fellow cultivators of the elixir, choosing the day after the White Dew (ding-wei) as their starting point. Ziranzi prepared the medicinal ingredients, Lord Yu managed the water and fire, and Master Liu was entrusted with the fire record.

The following day, Master Liu said: *"This should be recorded."* Ziranzi understood that the Master’s heart was that of an ancient perfected one—his wish was to transmit what he had tested and proven, guiding those who would come after.

Thus, he took up his brush and recorded it, entitling it *The Fisherman’s Lodge Encounter*.

**Explanation of the Great Return Elixir of Golden Liquor**
Laozi said: *"The Golden Liquor of the Return Elixir completes itself with Heaven."* Yet among the hundred methods of golden elixir, the essence lies in the divine water of the Flowery Pond. Only with divine water can white metal be born; white metal returns to yellow gold, yellow gold returns to purple gold, and purple gold flows as liquid, steaming and congealing atop the crucible to form the elixir. As *The Golden and Azure* states: *"Yin and yang intermingle, essence and primordial qi embrace."* It is not comparable to material substances. Material substances, when ingested, cannot transform or steam within the body; over time, they accumulate and breed illness. Thus, the preciousness of the Golden Liquor lies in its being the primordial qi of Heaven and Earth, which steams into the five viscera, dispersing like mist or wind and rain. Wei Boyang’s *Cantong Qi* records this in detail.

**The Return Elixir**
As *The Great Clarity Scripture* says: *"Mercury is originally obtained from cinnabar; now, refining mercury returns it to the elixir."* Hence, it is called the Return Elixir. The Primordial Sovereign said: *"Cinnabar possesses the creative transformations of Heaven and Earth; when its yin and yang qi are full, it naturally forms the elixir."* Within it are azurite, chalcanthite, realgar, orpiment, southern cinnabar, and northern mercury—thus, the elixir is light and pure, ascending in flight. Those who attain the Dao in this world are granted it by Heavenly Officials sent by the Supreme Emperor, and by consuming it, they ascend to the celestial river. Now, refining it in accord with Heaven and the Dao also yields these five corresponding elements, born within it—this is the transformation of the Five Phases. If one uses miscellaneous worldly substances, there can be no principle of return. Thus, those who refine their nature must sever worldly affairs, while those who refine the elixir may still keep wives and children, hold office, and bear titles. Refining one’s nature, if successful, benefits only oneself; refining the elixir, if successful, allows the entire household to ascend to Heaven. The Dao is supremely great and must be transmitted to the worthy, hence it crowns the list of elixirs. Yet though it is so, its fulfillment depends on fortune and destiny, and its great efficacy lies in human life.

The Scripture says: *"If one accumulates much goodness, the Star of Goodness governs them; seeing goodness, they embrace it, and their endeavors will surely succeed. If one commits much evil, the Star of Evil governs them; disbelieving in goodness, the Dao of immortality becomes distant."* Laozi said: *"If it can be offered, none will fail to offer it to their lord. If it can be advanced, none will fail to advance it to their kin. If it can be taught, none will fail to teach it to their brothers. If it can be transmitted, none will fail to transmit it to their descendants."* Were all under Heaven to become immortals, how could one not be cautious and deliberate in this?

**First Transformation: Harmonizing Yin and Yang, Named "Supreme Beginning"**
The *Book of Changes* says: *"The Dao consists of one yin and one yang; partial yin or partial yang is called illness."* Harmonizing yin and yang further requires matching their kinds—this is the principle of nature. The sage observes the primordial qi of Heaven and Earth, gathers the essence of the sun and moon, and takes the red and white substances, shaping them like a hen’s egg to form the primordial chaos. As *The Golden and Azure* states: *"The hen’s egg is harmonized to give birth to the divine being."* In division, it resides in the two crescents; in union, it resembles joined jade disks. Through the trigrams and lines, water and fire are set in motion; through days and months, time is transformed. Yin and yang thus form black lead—this is what the Most High called *"entering the black from the red,"* the true practice.

Master Straw Garment said: *"The human body exists because parents transmit qi; it is not formed from flesh."* The supreme medicine is likewise. The Kan male and Li female, their natures and feelings interdependent, conjoin their qi to form the embryo—even sages are born from the womb, hence it is said *"from the common to the sacred."* Yet the qi received must be sufficient. Master Zheng said: *"If the qi received is sufficient, one is intelligent; if insufficient, one is dull-witted."* This must not be overlooked.

It is also called *"Primordial Lead,"* for before Heaven and Earth existed, in the beginning of the primordial chaos, lead was the first to take form, being the primordial qi of Heaven and Earth. Master Peng said: *"Human lifespan, strength, and weakness all depend on the primordial qi received from parents—yet this is a turbid, disordered body with limits. The Great Elixir is the sacred womb of the Divine Mother, the primordial qi of Heaven and Earth, hence boundless. Using the boundless to continue the limited, how could one not share the lifespan of Heaven and Earth?"* For in the world, this lead did not originally exist; it arises through creation and transformation. The Dao is born from non-being; being is the beginning of Heaven and Earth. Once there is being, it is named the mother of the myriad things.

It is also said: *"The Dao gives birth to the One; penetrating the One, all affairs are complete."* Black lead pertains to water, its number is one; if one can penetrate this, the great work of the elixir is accomplished. Now, those who discuss the Dao point to the principle of non-being as emptiness—how could they know that within the profound and obscure, there is essence?

**Second Transformation: Primordial Chaos and Embryonic Radiance, Named "Supreme Ultimate"**
The Scripture says: *"That which is unfathomable in yin and yang is called the divine."* This lead is a divine being born of Heaven, incomparable to the five metals and eight minerals of the world. Within it are contained Heaven and Earth, sun and moon, yin and yang, the Eight Trigrams, the Five Phases, and the principles of the myriad things. Fu Xi’s *Book of Changes* and Shennong’s *Scripture of the Golden and Azure* both record this Dao.

Now, the thirty-six characters correspond internally and externally with the Eight Trigrams of the *Book of Changes*. The dragon and tiger, vermilion bird and dark warrior are the Four Symbols; the sun and moon are Kan and Li; fire, water, earth, wood, and metal are the Five Phases; green, white, black, azure, red, yellow, and purple are the Nine Palaces; Heaven and Earth are Qian and Kun. Xun is the eldest daughter, Gen the youngest son, Zhen the eldest son, Dui the youngest daughter; Jia, Bing, Wu, Geng, Ren, Yi, Ding, Ji, Xin, and Gui are the transformations of the Five Phases—here, the Dao of the Great Elixir is revealed, and this lead is it.

Now, scholars of the present, each expounding their theories and galloping in confusion, without encountering a transmitted teaching—how could they exhaust principle and fulfill their nature to attain destiny?

The Elixir arises from the intercourse of the sun and moon, hence its pattern embodies the meaning of their union. Thus the *Book of Changes* adopts the principle of sun and moon, placing Qian and Kun at the head of the hexagrams. Qian is pure yang, the qi of white metal, firm and strong, residing above as Heaven. Kun is pure yin, the substance of water and earth, yielding and soft, dwelling below as Earth. When above and below interact, Qian’s yang enters Kun, forming Kan; Kun’s yin enters Qian, forming Li. Kan and Li are the sun and moon, the male and female of Heaven and Earth. Within the sun is the crow, within the moon the hare—yin contains yang, yang contains yin. This lead is the essence of sun and moon, the soul and spirit of Heaven and Earth. Guangchengzi said: "Refine the marrow of Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang." The forging of the Great Elixir begins here.

In the third transformation, the Two Modes divide, distinguishing yin and yang. The Classic states: "Heaven attains the One and becomes clear; Earth attains the One and becomes tranquil; Man attains the One and becomes numinous." The One refers to the True One. When this lead is placed in the crucible and mercury is poured over it, golden flowers naturally emerge on the surface—this is the light, clear qi, the image of Qian. The cinnabar and earth envelop it externally—this is the heavy, turbid substance, the image of Kun. The *Record of the Armillary Sphere* says: "Heaven envelops Earth like the yolk within the shell." Herein lies the principle of Heaven and Earth. Pure yang is accumulated qi, which cannot but move and ascend. Pure yin clings to form, which cannot but remain still and settle below. The meaning of yin and yang is thus revealed. The *Daoist Classic* states: "Pure yang becomes an immortal; pure yin becomes a ghost. Man dwells between Heaven and Earth, endowed with the qi of yin and yang, moving in and out of life and death." The Elixir is the medicine of eternal life. If one refines and obtains it, using mercury to temper it and circulating the fire-qi to completion, once the primordial chaos is divided, the yin within Li will depart, and the yang within Kan will be made whole, restoring the body of Qian—thus becoming a purely yang substance. When ingested, one attains immortality, as if by natural consequence. The *Book of Changes* says: "That which is rooted in Heaven inclines upward"—the body becomes light and soars, again as if by natural consequence. Only then may it be called cinnabar, not the cinnabar of this world. Thus the ancient song says:
*"White Horse Sprout, true cinnabar.
Huainan King refined autumn stone; the Yellow Emperor praised golden flowers."*
And further:
*"Lead is the mother of the sprout; the sprout is the child of lead.
Once the golden flowers are seen, abandon lead and do not employ it."*
For the golden flowers, being pure yang, become companions of Heaven. The leaden husk, a yin thing, once the River Chariot’s conveyance is complete, is of no further use. Thus it is said: "Emerging from yin, entering yang, transcending the ordinary, and ascending to sagehood." Thereafter, quicksilver alone abides in profound mystery.

In the fourth transformation, the Five Phases are drilled and clustered, transmuting into the Four Spirits. The ancient song says:
*"No need for medicines, employ the Five Phases.
The dragon emerges from fire; the tiger is born in water."*
This White Horse Sprout is the golden flower, the White Tiger born in the black lead’s water. Moreover, when the finest cinnabar is sublimed to produce mercury, this is the dragon emerging from fire. Placing the two together, grind them three thousand times in a jade mortar with a pestle until they merge—this is called "bathing." The *Mirror of Medicines* says:
*"The Red Dragon is Qian’s virtue; the White Tiger is likewise constant.
Grind the dragon to powder, and the tiger will naturally match it."*
Then wash them with pure spring water, which turns a deep azure, indistinguishable from the sky. Here, the sequence of *Gold and Azure*—one white, two black, three green, four azure—becomes visible. Returning them to the crucible and circulating the fire-qi to completion, what emerges naturally assumes the forms of azurite, chalcanthite, male and female cinnabar, and mercuric cinnabar—five hues in all. The green is mercury, the essence of the Azure Dragon of wood. The white is the golden flower, the essence of the White Tiger of metal. The red is cinnabar, the essence of the Vermilion Bird of fire. The black is black lead, the essence of the Dark Warrior of water. These four are sacred and unknowable, hence called the Four Spirits, also named the Sacred Unknowable. Cao Yi Zi said: "When the Elixir reaches these Four Spirits, all gods and men revere them, as they do Heaven, Earth, sun, and moon—none dare offend, for the divine will surely punish."

In the fifth transformation, all changes proceed from the Central Palace’s earthly virtue. The Classic states: "The number of Heaven is five; the number of Earth is five. The five positions interact, each having its correspondence." The five refers to the Central Palace of earth, the beginning and end of all things’ generation. Thus water, with earth, completes the number six; fire, with earth, completes seven; wood, with earth, completes eight; metal, with earth, completes nine; earth, with earth, completes ten. Having refined the Elixir to the Four Symbols, it must attain earth before completion. Thus Zi Yang said: "Both embrace true earth, enabling the Golden Elixir’s return." The dragon emerging from fire refers to wood (three) and fire (two) combining to make five, rotating left to form wu earth. The tiger born in water refers to metal (four) and water (one) likewise combining to make five, rotating right to form ji earth. Both embrace true earth, returning to five, and their union with five is thus evident. The forging of the Great Elixir lies entirely in the dual function of metal and fire—the path of return through seven red and nine purple. When the completion numbers of metal and fire are fulfilled, the generative and consummative numbers of the *River Chart* become visible. The *Jade Flask Ode* of the Supreme Unity True Lord says:
*"The Chamber is the Azure Dragon; the Dipper is the Tiger.
The sun is the Vermilion Bird; the moon, the Dark Warrior.
To establish the foundation of the Great Medicine, one must obtain the central wu and ji earth."*
Taking the Four Spirits, bathe them as before, return them to the crucible, and circulate the fire-qi to completion. They will merge into true earth, within which the golden flower naturally appears.

Upon witnessing the golden flower, one may proceed with the *gou* and *liu* techniques. Master Cui states: *"Dry mercury *gou*s, damp mercury *liu*s—none escapes its grasp."* Thus, the *gou* and *liu* serve as verification. *The Elbow-Behind Manual* says: *"Upon seeing this earth, the Elixir is achieved."* Master Cui also calls it the *"Dragon Embryo Great Medicine,"* for within this earth, the Elixir’s body is forged, like a child within the mother’s womb.

Master Straw-Cloak says: *"If one’s great merit and conduct are not yet complete, ascension cannot be achieved. Should one halt cultivation at this stage, one may ward off illness, prolong life, and dwell in the world as an earthbound immortal."* However, when this medicine is refined to the third revolution, the impure embryo becomes a body of pure yang—a light, ethereal, soaring substance. If water and fire deviate from their proper measure, the primordial qi scatters, and the medicine loses its efficacy. Though one may see the earth, it will have form but no spirit; ingesting it will only lead to fleeting, insubstantial effects, like scattered mist or drifting smoke, ultimately dissipating into the intestines. While it may cure illness, prolonged use will breed new ailments.

Master Yin Changsheng says: *"Success or failure lies in the fire of *mao* and *you*; the interplay of punishment and virtue must not be overlooked."* From ancient times to the present, cultivators have regarded this as the great essential.

**Master Straw-Cloak’s Fire Timing Formula:**
The fire begins at the first revolution, rising in the eleventh month at the winter solstice, at the midnight hour of *zi*, receiving the qi of one yang—this is the *Fu* hexagram, its first yang line a *"hidden dragon,"* awaiting its time to act, steadfast and unshakable. The twelfth month brings the *Lin* hexagram, its second yang line a *"dragon seen in the field,"* the virtue of a ruler. The first month is the *Tai* hexagram, its third yang line a *"noble one advancing in virtue,"* nearing the subtle. The second month is the *Dazhuang* hexagram, its fourth yang line a *"dragon leaping in the abyss,"* seizing the moment—here, the mercury in the medicine rises and falls without fixed place. The third month is the *Guai* hexagram, its fifth yang line a *"flying dragon in the heavens,"* having attained its will—the medicine accumulates yang to become heaven. The fourth month is the *Qian* hexagram, its top yang line: *"A dragon soaring too high meets regret."* At this time, the medicine is complete, the body of *Qian* fully realized; no further transformation is possible. One must accumulate merit and conduct, then, in a pure and secluded place—a sacred mountain or auspicious site—purify oneself with fasting and ablutions before proceeding. The crucible, furnace, and fire timing differ from before. In the alchemical chamber, water and fire must never be separated for even a moment; the incense smoke must burn ceaselessly. For this is a substance of pure yang, its power equal to the workings of creation.

*Baopuzi* and various scriptures state: *"At this time, one must offer sacrifices to the furnace and to the Supreme Unity and all gods, inviting them to oversee and assist in the medicine’s formation."* The Daoist must not harbor wayward thoughts or allow any defilement to arise, for these will create obstacles—hence the warning of *"regret."* Cultivators must take heed: many have faltered thus before—some failing to complete the work, others completing it but unable to ingest it, still others ingesting it without effect, then deeming it demonic. Little do they know that cinnabar, a yang substance, is feared by ghosts and spirits; how much more so when refined to pure yang—how could yin demons dare approach? This principle is clear: be vigilant, be vigilant.

If one adheres to the prohibitions, the medicine will gradually become spiritually responsive. One may then proceed to the transmutation of base metals into gold and silver, advancing to the ninth revolution, where the fire of the Purple Yang Palace is perfected and merit is fulfilled. A single grain of this medicine can transform a parrot into a phoenix, a dog into a dragon, and transmute metals and stones into supreme treasures. Cultivators should study the formulas in the scriptures and deduce the principles therein—this fisherman’s hut cannot record them all.

An ancient song says:
*"Words fail to express it—
Beneath the pines, we may discuss it well."*
Another says:
*"When people ask of the Jiangnan scene,
I say: ‘You must walk the path to know.’"*

Once, after Master Huang annotated the *Scripture of the Dragon and Tiger*, he left this poem:
*"Things unrecognized are scorned as cheap;
Words too profound are lightly dismissed.
Last night, leaning on the railing, I sighed long—
For whom does this autumn moon shine bright?"*
He lamented the rarity of kindred spirits.

Now that this record has been made, it is no idle transcription. In joy, I compose four rhymed lines to append at the volume’s end:
*"Within the Elixir, divine water and the Flower Pool—
Seekers are many, the awakened few.
Pointing to qi and essence as creation’s work,
Who knows the lead and mercury hold depths profound?
Lost on the path, delusion breeds wayward views;
Who now will guide them back to the Great Way?
Today we meet by fate’s old bond—
With you, I lightly reveal heaven’s mystery."*

**Eleventh month, eighteenth day:** The furnace is opened, and primordial lead is obtained. A record of the truth:
*"The union of yin and yang follows nature’s law,
Yielding this substance called ‘primordial.’
Wonder within wonder—wondrous, truly wondrous!
Depth within depth—profound, ever profound.
A hundred days of effort at the outset,
Seizing the workings of creation for a thousand years.
Study the *Fisherman’s Hut Record* in detail—
Then you’ll believe immortals are not falsely proclaimed."*

**Second month, thirteenth day:** The ash pool is heated and scorched, yielding the *"Chaotic Embryo Spleen."*
*"The ash pool’s heat determines rise and fall—
Only upon seeing it does one know creation’s depth.
This thing was never in the world before;
Among men, few are its true kindred.
Vague and indistinct, it departs the Li Palace’s origin;
Dim and distant, it is the Kan House’s metal.
Do not boast of success upon gaining it—
One must diligently cultivate merit to align with heaven’s will."*

Here ends the *Fisherman’s Hut’s Chance Encounters Record.*
