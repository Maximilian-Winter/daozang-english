The *Divine Chamber* is the pivot of the elixir. Mercury is the parent of all minerals. Cinnabar and mercury dwell apart, emerging from yang and entering yin, their radiance flowing between the two directions. Their numerical arrangement is three, and they lodge in the images of water and fire.

The *Cantong Qi* states: "Qian and Kun are the gateways of the *Yi*."
This speaks of the *Divine Chamber* as the pivot of the elixir—the *Divine Chamber* is none other than Qian and Kun. In the human body, Qian corresponds to the head, and Kun to the abdomen, which together are called the upper and lower crucibles. Thus, the head is the Upper Cinnabar Field, and the abdomen encompasses the Middle and Lower Cinnabar Fields. The elixir is likened to the *Yi*, the Dipper and ten hexagrams to the multitude of minerals, and cinnabar and mercury to Kan and Li. Li is the sun, yang, and functions through emergence; Kan is the moon, yin, and functions through entry. Kan belongs to water and is numbered one; Li belongs to fire and is numbered two. Together, they make three, hence the phrase "lodging in the images of water and fire."

**Chapter One**
Rule is established by the king: with martial force, he suppresses rebellion; with civil virtue, he pacifies the realm. He reigns through the power of earth, wielding the sword and sheathing the halberd to stabilize the four directions. Kan and Li, numbered one and two, stand as the warp of south and north, thus crowning them as the chief among the seventy-two minerals. Hard and soft possess outer and inner aspects, and yin and yang are endowed by nature. The Kun and Gen hexagrams govern the center to regulate the exterior—this is the meaning of the king’s suppression of rebellion and pacification of the realm. Wielding the sword and sheathing the halberd to stabilize the four directions is the way of covering and veiling yin and yang. Taking south-Li and north-Kan as the warp and the other hexagrams as the weft, they form sixty hexagrams, distributed within thirty days to emulate the seventy-two seasonal nodes of a celestial year. Thus, the sixty hexagrams are likened to the seventy-two minerals. Qian is hard, Kun is soft; Kan is yang, Li is yin—all naturally serve as each other’s outer and inner aspects.

**Chapter Two**
Metal and fire take their turn in service; metal and water mutually contain and receive. Male and female unite as one body, and their use follows an ordered pattern.

The tenth chapter of the *Cantong Qi* states: "The most luminous of manifest images are none greater than the sun and moon."
This classic compares it thus: "The most luminous in the flourishing of the elixir are none greater than metal and fire"—meaning metal and fire are Kan and Li. Kan is kidney-water, and the phase born of water is metal. Li is the heart, and the phase belonging to the heart is fire. The *Cantong Qi* speaks of *Zhun* taking its turn in service and *Meng* knowing reception; here, it speaks of metal and fire taking their turn in service, and metal and water mutually containing and receiving. Now, *Zhun* at dawn and *Meng* at dusk are the emanations of Kan and Li into the sixty hexagrams, beginning with these two hexagrams. Thus, the *Cantong Qi* speaks of their function, while this text speaks of their essence. As for the interplay of female and male giving rise to the sixty hexagrams, they form a complete whole. Extending from *Zhun* and *Meng* to *Ji Ji* and *Wei Wei*, within a single month, the sixty hexagrams cycle through—how could this not follow an ordered pattern?

**Chapter Three**
Transformations reach their utmost mystery; when the end comes, they begin anew. The ninth line marks the measure, and yang harmony aligns with the sun’s dawn and dusk.

From the first to the ninth, and from the sixteenth to the sixth: nine is the birth of yang, and six is the birth of yin. Nine begins at *zi* and extends to *si*; six begins at *wu* and extends to *hai*—hence the alignment with dawn and dusk.

**Chapter Four**
The cyclic reckoning accords with the celestial mind. Yang lines conclude at *si*; true yin emerges from Li at *wu*, ending at *ding* and concluding at *hai*.

This passage speaks of the twelve months as the fire of the year. From *Fu* to *Qian* is yang; from *Gou* to *Kun* is yin.

**Chapter Five**
Water and fire array in a single direction, guarding their boundaries to form cold and heat. East and west manifest benevolence and righteousness; the Five Phases transform the four seasons. Thus, yin and yang interact in their functions, following the Three Ones to attain their principle.

Water governs the north, fire governs the south. Yang is born at *zi*, yin is born at *wu*—cold and heat are founded here. East governs spring, west governs autumn. Spring gives birth, autumn brings decline. Only yang, born at *zi*, reaches *mao* and grows mighty, thus embodying the way of extending benevolence. Yin, born at *wu*, reaches *you* and waxes in power, thus bearing the symbol of stripping away. When benevolence is extended, it resembles the sprouting of buds and the flight of crystals; when righteousness is established, it draws from the stripping away to nourish the root. Thus, yin and yang each fulfill their fivefold functions. The Three are the fluids of the heart, lungs, and liver above; the One is the fluid of the kidneys below. The Four all originate from the earth of the central palace—hence the *Cantong Qi* states that the Five Phases attain their principle.

**Chapter Six**
The *Divine Chamber* establishes its positions, and transformations occur within it.

The *Divine Chamber* is the upper and lower crucibles. "Establishing positions" refers to the precise arrangement of female and male pairings. "Transformations" refer to cinnabar and mercury—cinnabar and mercury are the two functions of metal and earth. These two functions have no fixed position: *Zhang* and *Yi* fly to *Xu* and *Wei*, coming and going without constancy, rising and falling without permanence. Dwelling alone, they do not alter; transformed, they return to the central palace, enveloping all minerals to become the ancestral origin of the elixir.

The *Cantong Qi* states: "Compare Qian and Kun to the *Divine Chamber*; pair yin and yang with female and male; liken cinnabar and mercury to Kan and Li." It further pairs metal and earth with Qian and Kun—Qian is metal, Kun is earth—thus taking Kan and Li as the two functions of Qian and Kun, and comparing cinnabar and mercury to the two functions of metal and earth. *Zhang* and *Yi* are the south; *Xu* and *Wei* are the north. "Coming and going without constancy, rising and falling without permanence" refers to the two substances, cinnabar and mercury, uniting as one body. From this, the hundred bones, nine orifices, five viscera, and six bowels all arise—just as Kan and Li extend and transform into the sixty hexagrams. Thus, they envelop the ten thousand things, and none are unaware of their advance.

Chapter Seven:
Presence and absence mutually restrain; the Vermilion Bird flames in the void, the purple radiance shines upon the sun, and cinnabar and mercury vanish away. *The Union* compares the vanishing of Kan and Li to the vanishing of cinnabar and mercury—since the sixty hexagrams originate from Kan and Li, just as the golden elixir originates from cinnabar and mercury. Once the hexagrams are formed, Kan and Li are no longer of use, just as when the elixir transforms into purple radiance, cinnabar and mercury are no longer employed. Thus, the *Elixir Canon* states: "Use lead yet do not use lead; one must act within lead." Here, the true fire is the true lead.

Chapter Eight:
The method is not casually devised; the principle is not idly established. Condensing the text to unfold its profundities, one knocks and seeks the numinous, expounding the lines to verify the hexagrams, and reciting the five phases. Kan is the male essence of metal; Li is the female radiance of fire. Metal and fire contend; water and earth overcome one another. Earth flourishes in the domain of metal, and the three substances perish together. The four seas converge like spokes to establish great peace, all proceeding from the central palace—the merit of the Yellow Emperor’s virtue of earth. *The Union* states: "Kan is the essence of the moon, Wu; Li is the radiance of the sun, Ji." This corresponds to Kan as the male essence of metal and Li as the female radiance of fire. What is concealed within Kan becomes metal, while its outward flow transforms into water; what is concealed within Li becomes fire, yet when it emerges, it combines with the fluids of the spleen to become earth. Though Kan’s metal and Li’s fire contend, and water and fire overcome one another, they also serve as husband and wife in this way. The spleen, belonging to earth, resides between the heart and lungs, first generating the metallic fluid of the lungs; thus, the lung’s fluid in turn generates in this manner. When metal, water, and earth all fall into the realm of emptiness and nothingness, the *Forty-One Chapters* is therefore called *Entering Directly into the Void*. Only after all three perish can Kan and Li’s Wu and Ji circulate the sixty hexagrams, arriving from the four directions like the four seasons bringing things to completion. How can this not be a great achievement!

Chapter Nine:

Gold and fire are true lead, and in the art of the elixir, nothing is more luminous than gold and fire. By exhausting the subtle to follow transformation, yang moves and yin dissolves. When primal chaos ends in nine and one, the precious crucible alternates in mutual support. Together they comprise three hundred and eighty-four *zhu*, with each *zhu* corresponding to one *jin*, and one *jin* being sixteen *liang*.

When the essence of gold undergoes one transformation, the Azure Dragon receives the tally. At this moment, the divine spirits refine its essence, and fire and metal mutually propel one another. The male yang is the verdant mystery-water, the female yin is the ochre yellow gold. Yin and yang intermingle and unite, their essence and fluids enveloping the primordial *qi*. The myriad forms arise from emptiness, each responding to transformation according to its kind. The numinous efficacy of all elixirs draws near, and none fail to attain longevity through this.

The *Cantong Qi* states: "The *Yi* displays its images with clarity, and nothing is greater than the sun and moon." Comparing this to the luminous safeguarding of the elixir, nothing is greater than gold and fire. Gold and fire are what Chapter Nine refers to as Kan’s metal and Li’s fire. Thus, Li is the sun and yang, Kan is the moon and yin. From the first day of the new moon onward, the moon receives the sun’s light, and the moon begins to wax. By the time of the first quarter, yin and yang are each half, and the three yin and three yang have yet to intermingle. After the first quarter, yang *qi* grows robust and seeks out yin. By the fifteenth day, the upper three yin have all intermingled to become yang.

From the sixteenth day onward, the pregnant fullness of the moon again seeks out yang. By the time of the last quarter, the three yang have all transformed into yin, and the three yin and three yang at last separate into two. Thus, from the first quarter to the last quarter, all is the time of primal chaos in mutual union. Those who practice refinement therefore gather half a *jin* of gold after the waxing yang of the first quarter, and gather half a *jin* of water before the robust yin of the last quarter. Half a *jin* is eight *liang*, one *liang* is twenty-four *zhu*, and thus the combined *zhu* of sixteen *liang* can correspond to the complete lines of the *Yi*!

Once gold and water are united and transformed into one, within the divine chamber they must emulate the waxing and waning numbers of yin and yang. Applying fire to refine them, the golden elixir is thus accomplished. The phrase "fire and metal mutually propel one another" refers to their ceaseless movement.

**Chapter Ten**

Hereupon, the Primal Lord begins to refine mercury. The divine chamber contains cavernous emptiness, and the mysterious and white become the Metal Duke, towering at the inception. Adorning the Three and Five to guard one another, the soaring essence then moistens and nourishes.

The *Cantong Qi* compares the divine chamber to Qian and Kun, calling them the upper and lower crucibles. Mercury is born of Li, lead is born of Kan, and together they become husband and wife—just as the *Guan Ju* speaks of the queen and her consort as the origin of proper marriage. The Three and Five are Kan and Li. Only after the soaring essence is moistened and nourished can they guard one another, just as husband and wife unite, necessarily beginning from the first year.

**Chapter Eleven**

The Mysterious Woman expounds their sequence: Wu and Ji value the celestial tally. When the celestial tally’s Dao gradually unfolds, the stripping away is difficult to align with the mysterious diagram. Thus, she expounds the intent of the elixir, and Qian and Kun are no longer mentioned.

Wu and Ji are Kan’s Wu and Li’s Ji. The celestial tally is the unfolding of the sixty hexagrams, corresponding to the waxing and waning of yin and yang within thirty days. Yet when yang *qi* reaches the thirtieth day, it is entirely stripped away. If it were to end in complete stripping, it would be insufficient for the use of the mysterious diagram. Only because its revolutions are inexhaustible, with no going that is not also a return, can it be employed to expound the applications of the elixir.

In the human body, the head is Qian, the abdomen is Kun, the heart is Li, and the kidneys are Kan. Excluding these four hexagrams, the remaining sixty hexagrams are used as the celestial tally. Thus, Wu and Ji, Qian and Kun, are no longer mentioned.

**Chapter Twelve**

Cinnabar flows as the mercury father, Wu and Ji are the yellow gold mother. The bell and pitch-pipe return to two and six, the Dipper’s pivot establishes three and nine. The Red Youth plays with the Vermilion Bird, transforming into the Azure Dragon.

When Kun first changes into Zhen, on the third day the moon emerges at Geng. East and west divide at Mao and You, and the Dragon and Tiger naturally seek one another. When Kun changes again into Dui, on the eighth day the moon emerges at Ding—this is the first quarter, and the gold is half a *jin*. When Kun changes a third time into Qian, on the fifteenth day the three yang are complete. Round and radiant, it illuminates the east at Jia, and metal and water moisten the Great Yang. The red marrow flows as mercury, and the Crone plays with the bright cauldron.

**Chapter Thirteen**

The moon’s fullness naturally wanes. On the sixteenth day, its motion begins to decline. When Qian first wanes into Xun, at dawn the moon appears at Xin. When Qian wanes again into Gen, on the twenty-third day it is the last quarter—this is the last quarter, and the water is half a *jin*, the moon emerging south at Bing. When Qian changes a third time into Kun, on the thirtieth day at Kun-Yi, in the northeast it loses its companion, and the moon sets at the Yi position.

When the moon at Kun-Yi is already obscured, earth, wood, and metal are about to transform. Following Kun, the Zhen Dragon is born. Cinnabar and mercury are the seventh segment, referring to Kan and Li. Earlier, it was said that Kan and Li crown the seventy-two stones, and thus this is the yellow gold mother. All elixir stones are born of Kan and Li, hence it is said that the myriad forms arise from emptiness.

The twelve pitch-pipes are the fire of the year. The Dipper’s pivot first points to Chen and last to Xu, hence it is said to establish three and nine. The Red Youth is the spirit of the heart; the Vermilion Bird is the spirit of fire; the Azure Dragon is the eastern Zhen hexagram.

**Chapter Fourteen**

Qian and Kun encompass beginning and end. Over thirty days, Kun gives birth to Zhen, Dui, and Qian, and Qian gives birth to Xun, Gen, and Kun. The eight hexagrams array their luminaries, shifting without losing the center. Regulating the fire for sixty days, the transformations naturally serve as proof.

That Qian and Kun encompass beginning and end means that in the beginning, when there was yet no heaven and earth, there was only a vast and undifferentiated emptiness. When yang *qi* first sprouts within this emptiness, it is like Kan arising within pure Kun. Thus, Kun ends and Kan begins. When Kan’s upper birth transforms into Zhen and Dui, reaching Qian, the light and pure body is completed above!

When yang *qi* reaches its utmost extreme, yin *qi* already sprouts within pure yang—just as Li arises within pure Qian. Thus, Qian ends and Li begins. As Li descends and transforms into Xun and Gen, reaching Kun, the heavy and turbid essence congeals below. This is how heaven and earth come into being.

Yet this scripture speaks of regulating the fire for sixty days, which does not match the *Cantong Qi*’s method of morning and evening progressions through *Zhun* and *Meng*, advancing to *Ji* and *Wei*, and from dusk to dawn—this better accords with the workings of creation.

**Chapter Fifteen**

The sacred chamber has its correspondences:
Hard as an egg to contain,
Five Peaks stand in hidden caverns,
Their convergence forming the pivot’s hinge.

At first kindling, the fire is gently warm,
Like the stirring of a hexagram’s line.
Above, it bears the essence of golden yang;
Below, it carries the form of Kun’s origin.
Within, flowing mercury harmonizes,
Blending in accord with the Three Powers.

Qian moves, circulating the Three Luminaries;
Kun rests, containing yang *qi*.
Only when the sacred chamber is employed
Does the Golden Elixir then take form.

How could one not strengthen the vessel of refinement,
Encompassing flight and coagulation,
Opening and closing the numinous portal—
The treasury of the subtle and invisible?

The Five Peaks are the five viscera;
The caverns speak of what is concealed.
The essence of golden yang is Qian’s origin above;
Kun is the earth’s form below.
Flowing mercury is the five metals;
The Three Luminaries are Li (sun), Kan (moon), and the five stars.
Thus the *Cantong Qi* says: the *Hetu*’s patterns are the celestial writ,
While earth’s form is Kun’s origin.
The human heart discerns heaven and earth,
Drawing forth the elixir—
All are called the Three Powers.
The vessel’s treasury is the Elixir.

**Chapter Sixteen**

The furnace of creation, the spring cavern:
Yang *qi* emerges from Kun.
The sundial points to the southern extreme,
Five stars align in a pearl-strung line,
Sun and moon conjoin as jade discs,
Golden sand adheres to its measure,
Breath and response harmonize.

The spring cavern is the region of the kidneys;
Kan governs the kidneys—
Here, the first yang sprouts within pure yin.
In the moon, this is the *jianzi* month;
In time, it is midnight.
Thus, when the five stars align in a pearl-strung line,
It signifies the five viscera’s treasures coming to life.
Only then, after the sun and moon conjoin as jade discs,
Does one fix the weight by measure
To gather cinnabar and mercury into the sacred chamber.

At the sun, one speaks of exhalation;
At the moon, of inhalation—
As the *Huangting Jing* says: sunrise and sunset, moon’s breath and intake, are preserved thus.

**Chapter Seventeen**

The Flowery Canopy looms above,
The Three Terraces lend support below.
The office of oversight must be tightly sealed,
Its scrutiny unrelenting in discerning success or failure.

**Chapter Eighteen**

The Flowery Canopy is where the lord of men oversees all below—
For Qian resides at the head above, issuing decrees to the realm.
The Terraces and Assistants are Kan and Li, who carry out the lord’s commands,
Aiding and supporting him, overseeing and recording,
Each governing their respective domains,
Lest any leak or breach occur.
One must also examine their competence before employing them—
This is the exhalation of the old and inhalation of the new.

**Chapter Nineteen**

Fire refines the earth of the Central Palace;
Metal enters the water of the Northern Quarter.
Earth, water, and metal—these three substances,
Transform over sixty days,
A natural essential: radiance preserved, decay averted.
If the measure of earth is excessive, its weight defies the norm;
If the water’s grains are unsteady, they share a place yet dwell apart.
Hard and soft resist each other, refusing to intermingle—
Not the fault of fire, but the rebuke falls upon earth.
Earth guards the Central Palace, the dragon’s canopy spanning the four directions.

When fire refines the earth of the Central Palace,
The heart’s fluid emerges to meet the spleen’s fluid, transmuting into earth.
Metal is the lung’s fluid, entering the Gate of Mysterious Femininity
To meet the kidney’s fluid—thus it enters.
The Northern Quarter is water.
Thus, earth, water, and metal first reside within the Three Palaces,
Then enter the Cinnabar Field, where they transform into the Golden Elixir.
Hence, radiance is preserved, decay averted.

If the measure of earth is too great, or the water’s grains unstable,
Hard and soft will resist, dwelling together yet never uniting—
Hence, they dwell apart.
This is not the failure of fire to refine the Golden Elixir,
But the fault of earth’s excess.
Only when earth’s measure is proper
Can the Dragon, Tiger, Lead, and Mercury mutually engender and perfect one another.

**Chapter Twenty**

When the Three Luminaries align in measure, great peace is achieved;
The five viscera are inwardly nourished, the four limbs harmonized.
Water’s form vanishes, its radiance inwardly bright;
Metal and water gleam together, sealing and submerging their brilliance.
Regulating fire to warm water, all is transformed when activated—
The Way is near and may be sought.

The Three Luminaries are the moon of Kan, the sun of Li, and all metallic substances.
When extracted, each must conform to its measure,
Neither exceeding nor falling short—
Thus can great peace be attained.
Only with measured extraction can the surplus be used
To nourish the five viscera inwardly, harmonizing the four limbs.

If the water of the Kan Palace is firmly controlled, preventing reckless leakage,
Its form naturally dries within, its shadow unseen—
Extinguished yet without trace of advance.
Thus, the radiance of metal and water gleams inwardly bright,
Sinking and concealing within to nourish the four limbs.
This is what the *Huangting Jing* calls the "inner master of the six palaces and the ninefold source of fluids."
If one further regulates fire to warm it,
All will transform into the Inner Elixir—
How could this not be near at hand?

Water and earth alone pair together,
Like kingfishers birthing auspicious clouds.
Yellow and black blend their essences,
Purple blossoms unfurl in the great yang.
Water alone gives birth to the myriad things—
Only the sage truly knows this.

Earth is the spleen, water the kidneys;
These two palaces share the same function,
Thus are said to pair.
"Kingfishers and auspicious clouds" speak of the five hues complete.
What causes the fluids of these two palaces to meet within the cinnabar field,
Transforming into the Purple Gold Elixir,
Vying in radiance with the great yang?

Now, the spleen can refine the fluids of the heart, lungs, and liver,
Inwardly nourishing the five viscera, the hundred bones, and the nine apertures.
Cultivators may know this,
But only if water is not recklessly leaked
Does it naturally flow inward to irrigate the four limbs, the hundred bones, and the nine apertures,
Giving birth to the myriad things—
None but the sage can know this.
Thus the *Cantong Qi* says: "The world does not understand."

Gold’s virtue reveres white;
Refining lead seeks the yellow hue.
Stimulated, it arises in the Central Palace,
Molten gold does not fly.
Scorching earth raises clouds of smoke,
Presence and absence mutually restrain.
Above dwells the Azure Dragon,
The two non-existences honor the one existence—
Spiritual transformation, wondrous and hard to fathom.

Gold here refers to what is called below "silver, the essence of gold."
Lead is gold’s mother.
Refining lead to seek the yellow hue:
Within Kan lies Wu,
For Kan is born from pure Kun,
Thus possessing earth’s nature.
Refined by fire, it becomes yellow gold.
Thus the *Cantong Qi* says: "First liquid, then congealed,
Called the Yellow Ascension."
Only with the yellow hue
Can it stimulate the earth of the Central Palace to generate it,
Congealing without flight.

The "presence" is Kan’s yang,
Also called the Tiger,
The moon’s essence.
The Azure Dragon is the liver’s hun,
Called "dragon" for its power of transformation.
The fire of Li Palace can further refine it,
Thus it is said: "The two non-existences honor the one existence."

---

Refining silver from lead,
Spiritual beings naturally arise.
Silver is the essence of gold,
Lead the northern spirit.
Water is the pivot of the Dao,
Its number named One,
The beginning of yin and yang—
Thus it can generate silver.

Lead transforms into yellow cinnabar,
Lodging in the five metals.
Lead’s exterior is black,
Its color endowed by the north.
Within it harbors silver’s essence,
Wearing coarse cloth while holding jade—
Outwardly resembling a madman.
The *Cantong Qi* says: "Know the white, guard the black,
And the numinous brightness will come of itself."
White is the essence of gold,
Black the foundation of water.
Only by guarding this watery foundation
Can the essence of gold arise from it.
Thus it is said: "The numinous brightness comes of itself."
This is the five phases moving contrary to their sequence—
Gold being born within water.

As for lead’s transformation into yellow cinnabar,
It lodges in the position of the five metals.
This is the twenty-second segment,
The "stimulation giving rise to the Central Palace."
From this perspective,
Mutual generation proceeds without end.

---

Silver is lead’s child,
The child hidden within lead.
Lead is silver’s mother,
The child concealed in the mother’s womb.
Subtle and distant, the pristine truth,
Seeming to exist, seeming not—
In the ash pool, scorched by flame,
Lead sinks, silver floats.
Pure white, the treasure appears,
Capable of forging yellow gold.

Lead gives birth to silver,
And in the beginning, silver lies within lead—
Like a child in the mother’s womb.
No form to be seen,
No boundary to be sought.
For example, when smelting silver in an ash pool,
Lead is used to draw it out.
When the fire’s heat intensifies,
Lead sinks and silver emerges.

Now, the silver within Kan
Is further refined by the crescent moon’s fire,
Then lead naturally sinks and silver naturally floats.
The treasure appears, pure and white,
And when further refined,
Yellow gold can be forged.

The husk is the essence of gold,
Water encircles the yellow liquid.
A substance the width of an inch
Mixes the Three Powers.
Before heaven and earth divided,
All was mixed like a chicken’s egg,
Round and high at the center,
Resembling Penglai’s gourd.
Sealed with subtle tightness,
The spirit works within.
The furnace and cauldron take their form from this,
Firmly enclosed, perfectly secure.

The husk is the essence of gold—
The *Cantong Qi* says: "Use gold as the embankment."
This gold is that born of the lead mother.
"Water encircles the yellow liquid":
The water is that born of Li Palace,
The pure water of the Jade Pool.
The "yellow liquid" is the fluid of the spleen.
"A substance the width of an inch" is the cinnabar field.
The Three Powers:
Li originates from Qian,
Kan originates from Kun,
The spleen stands in the center, symbolizing humanity.

When heaven and earth had not yet divided,
All was mixed like a chicken’s egg.
With the spirit moving within,
It could transform into the ten thousand things of heaven and earth—
The furnace and cauldron truly take their form from this.

---

By winding restraint, ensure no mishap,
Following the principle of nature,
Spiritual transformation knows no bounds.
The lodestone attracts iron,
Though barriers lie between, they secretly connect.
How does the dead hen’s egg,
When matched, give birth?
Gold and earth’s virtue
Always accompany mercury.

"Winding restraint" is what the *Cantong Qi* calls the "winding corridor"—
The tail’s closed gate.
Though the lodestone and iron may be separated by objects,
They still secretly connect.
How much more so with the furnace and cauldron,
Which naturally possess winding restraint,
Mutually controlling and uniting like the hen’s egg’s pairing?

Gold is Qian, metal, dwelling above;
Earth is Kun, soil, dwelling below;
Mercury is humanity, dwelling in the center.
In the tenth segment of this scripture,
Gold and fire were called "lead,"
But in this chapter, only mercury is mentioned.
Generally, the fluids of heart and kidneys
All emerge as the supreme treasure,
Thus they are collectively termed lead and mercury.

The *Fire Record* was not written in vain.
With solemnity, it explains the preceding text.
Once the elixir art is revealed,
No further doubt remains.
Thus this formula is expounded
To append to the *Fire Record*,
So that learners may grasp its imagery without confusion.

The *Fire Record* and *Cantong Qi* explain the *Dragon-Tiger Scripture*.
At the twenty-sixth segment,
Lamenting that later students fail to understand,
They compose the *Fire Record*’s preface at the end.

This statement, solemnly explicating the preceding text, refers to the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth segments, which revisit the matters of the fourth and fifth segments. Here ends the commentary on the *Dragon-Tiger Upper Scripture* of the ancient text.
