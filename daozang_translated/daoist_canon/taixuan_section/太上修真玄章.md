### **Chapter One: The One Qi Gives Rise to All Transformations**
The divine is nature—there is the nature of Heaven and Earth, and the nature of qi and form.
Before the union of father and mother, it is the nature of Heaven and Earth;
after their union, it is the nature of qi and form.
Qi comprises the qi of Earth, which is true qi,
while the qi of father and mother is ordinary qi.
When a person first resides in the mother’s womb, receiving the father’s essence and mother’s blood,
this forms the initial sign of life.
The so-called ordinary qi merges with the ninefold true qi of the Hollow Emperor,
completing the body’s structure—this is true qi.
The first qi generates the embryo,
the second qi forms the fetus,
the third qi nurtures the spirit,
illuminating the qi of immortality to give rise to the hun-soul, and nature begins to manifest.
Yet, as the body’s structure is not yet complete, it cannot yet be spiritually active.
By the fourth qi, the po-soul is born;
by the fifth qi, the viscera take form.
At the sixth qi, the celestial, lofty, true, and harmonious qi generates spirit,
and the body’s structure is complete—then it can move.
Movement gives rise to spirit, and spirit gives rise to the awakening of nature.
By the ninth month, the qi is full;
by the tenth month, the fetus is complete—then birth occurs.

### **Chapter Two: The Root and Stem of Nature and Life**
The immortals say: While in the mother’s womb, the infant’s umbilical cord connects to the mother’s,
so that when the mother inhales, the infant inhales, and when she exhales, the infant exhales.
Upon birth, the umbilical cord is cut, and each breathes independently.
The single point of ordinary qi received from the parents then resides in the lower Cinnabar Field,
lodging in the kidneys.
The Cinnabar Field lies before the navel and behind the kidneys,
situated between them in a ring-like connection,
measuring one *cun* and two *fen* in breadth.
It has two apertures corresponding to Qian and Kun,
connecting upward to the Mud Pill Palace and downward to the Bubbling Spring.
Six additional apertures correspond to Kan, Li, Zhen, Xun, Gen, and Dui,
linking to the six viscera.
The qi of the entire body gathers here,
like water flowing to the east or spokes converging at the hub—
thus, this aperture is the root and stem of life.
Nature resides in the Cinnabar Field and Mud Pill Palace,
lodging in the heart.
The Mud Pill Palace is located in the human head,
between the Hall of Light,
within the six directions—this is the crown of the head.
Thus, the world calls the infant’s crown the "Gate of Nature."
Before the Gate of Nature closes, one knows matters of past lives and their causes;
once it closes, these are forgotten.
Therefore, the Mud Pill Palace is the root of nature.
Only by knowing the root of nature and the stem of life can one begin to speak of cultivation.

### **Chapter Three: The Precelestial and Postcelestial**
The qi of Heaven and Earth has two aspects:
before receiving the embryo, it is called the precelestial,
also known as the mother qi.
This qi is vast and unyielding,
filling Heaven and Earth,
circulating through the six directions without cease, day and night.
Once a person receives the embryo, they are endowed with this qi,
which is then called the postcelestial,
or child qi.
It is also said: The qi of the sun and moon’s generation
is the aforementioned ninefold true qi of the Hollow Emperor—
in truth, it is one qi.
This qi also fills the human body,
and each day, at the *zi* hour,
when the Dipper’s handle points to the earth,
the precelestial qi follows the Dipper’s handle,
arising from beneath the ninefold earth,
circulating through the six directions to transform the myriad things.
The *zi* hour is not the *zi* hour of the human world.
In the twelve double-hours of each day,
one must constantly practice inward vision and reversed hearing,
suddenly perceiving a warm qi surging within the body—
this is the moment.
As the alchemical classics say:
"When essence is born, the time arrives of itself;
within a hundred moments, one must not be deluded."
Once the qi of Heaven and Earth is born,
the child qi of the human body responds in kind,
arising and ascending to the Cinnabar Field,
refining ordinary qi to complete the transformation of the human form.

### **Chapter Four: The Mysterious Function of Form and Spirit**
Form is the dwelling of spirit and qi;
spirit is the master of form and qi.
Without spirit, form and qi are but a lifeless clod;
without form and qi, the numinous spirit has no place to reside.
Alas!
Spirit is nature, and qi is life—
neither can be neglected.
To cultivate nature without cultivating life,
as Master Ziyang says:
"Spirit and essence belong to yin; their dwelling is hard to secure,
and one cannot avoid the method of constant migration."
To cultivate life without cultivating nature,
as the Buddhists say:
"Refining qi to purity, one may live ten thousand years,
but without awakening to the samadhi of right enlightenment,
when one’s retribution is exhausted, one returns to be scattered among the various destinies."
Thus, the Confucians say:
"To discuss nature without discussing qi is incomplete;
to discuss qi without discussing nature is unclear."
One must know that nature is primary, and qi secondary.

### **Chapter Five: The Creation of the Golden Elixir**
In refining the Golden Elixir,
form is likened to the cauldron,
qi to the medicinal substances,
and spirit to the fire’s function.
Abandoning scheming and extinguishing thoughts,
practicing inward vision and reversed hearing,
so that spirit, essence, hun-soul, po-soul, and intent—
these five—do not leak,
is to stabilize the cauldron.
Day as Kun, night as Qian,
gathering the mind in one place,
remaining silent all day,
like a fool, like an idiot—
this is to gather the medicinal substances.
Being alert yet unwavering,
clearly and constantly aware,
with spirit not straying outward,
qi naturally stills—
this is to regulate the fire’s function.
Thus, the sage forgets form to nurture qi,
forgets qi to nurture spirit,
forgets spirit to nurture emptiness.
When form and spirit are both wondrous,
they merge with the true Dao.
The so-called "forgetting" is not
like withered wood or dead ashes,
sitting in dull stupor facing a wall.
The heart is like the great void,
pure and bright within and without,
round and lively like a pearl rolling on a plate,
clear and deep like the moon reflected in a pool.
Moving yet unmoving,
still yet not still.
"One must be engaged yet not fixated;
do not forget, nor force its growth."
Let it roam without straying outward,
restrain it without confining it within.
The space in the breast is always open and vast—
this is true forgetting.

If emptiness transforms into spirit, spirit into qi, and qi into form—this is death! It differs not from the common mortal.

**Chapter Six: The Transformations of Emptiness and Non-Being**
Beyond heaven and earth lies the Great Void, the Great Nothingness—together called emptiness and non-being, or simply the Void. With no mind, it is empty and thus non-being; empty, it can contain; non-being, it can transform. Thus, things return to things, affairs to affairs, forms to forms, qi to qi—each reverts to its root. Heaven and earth naturally cover and bear, sun and moon naturally revolve, yin and yang naturally rise and fall, cold and heat naturally come and go, the four seasons naturally shift, the five qi naturally spread, creatures of flight and stillness naturally move and rest. Colors remain colors—how could heaven and earth harbor a mind? This is why they endure long and last forever.

Man cannot match heaven and earth in longevity because he possesses a mind and thus cannot attain emptiness and non-being. If he could achieve emptiness and non-being, his spirit would naturally return to spirit, spirit to qi, and the beginning of cultivation could then be spoken of.

**Chapter Seven: The Three Disciplines of Cultivation**
In the method of cultivation, one must first guard one’s speech, then moderate diet, and further reduce sleep—these three are the great keys to immortal and Buddha cultivation.

Why speak of this? As the Old Master said: "The gate of the Mysterious Female is called the root of heaven and earth. It flows continuously as if existing, yet its use is never exhausted." The Mysterious Female is spirit and qi; the mouth and nose are its gates. Exhalation and inhalation, long draws and gentle releases, should be continuous—returning to the root to restore life and nurture primordial qi. Thus, guarding speech comes first.

Master Ziyang said: "From emptiness arises the One Qi; from the One Qi, yin and yang are born." The qi that humans generate in daily life arises from emptiness. When hunger and emptiness arise, one thinks of food, thereby obstructing qi. Once obstructed, qi cannot return to its origin and is instead dissipated by sounds, colors, fragrances, flavors, joy, anger, sorrow, and delight. Thus, moderating diet follows.

The Daoist adept, like a hen brooding her eggs, must maintain unbroken warmth; the slightest interruption risks forfeiting life. If one indulges in sleep, spirit departs from qi, and qi, left masterless, scatters wildly—how then can it be gathered and refined? Thus, reducing sleep comes next.

**Chapter Eight: The Union of Spirit and Qi**
Having mastered guarding speech, moderating diet, and reducing sleep, one may then practice the methods of inner refinement and elixir-gathering, the techniques of seated meditation and illusion-transformation, proceeding step by step.

When the Mother Qi of the prior heaven descends, and the Child Qi of the posterior heaven ascends, both meet in the cinnabar field. Silently, they transform the mundane qi of father and mother. Over months and years, the mundane qi is refined away, and true qi fills the body, arising spontaneously and irresistibly. It ascends from the double passes to the Mud Pill Palace, where it unites with spirit—this is called "pursuing the two qi along the Yellow Path and gathering the three natures in the Original Palace," where they transform into sweet dew.

From the Mysterious Pass, it descends once more into the cinnabar field. One ascent and one descent complete the work of creation. But this requires the heart to be empty and non-being, with not a single thought stirring—only then can resonance occur. Otherwise, the medicinal ingredients dissipate, the firing times err, and no elixir is formed. All this arises naturally; one must not forcefully direct spirit or manipulate qi, nor compare it to the hastening of sprouts.

**Chapter Nine: Movement and Stillness, Ascent and Descent**
Extreme movement gives rise to stillness; extreme stillness gives rise to movement. One movement, one stillness—these are but its functions. Like the wonder of heaven and earth: in movement, it opens; in stillness, it closes. Without opening, there is no closing; without closing, no opening. Opening and closing—endless generation.

When the work of stillness reaches its peak, the primordial yang qi naturally arises. As qi is born, heaven and earth quake, mountains and peaks tremble, dragons and elephants race, wind and fire clash, a fragrant brew pours over the crown, and light shines through the curtains. Then, like spring rain, it flows gently; like melting ice, it trickles. From the head, it streams to the feet, then rises again, circulating through the three palaces, ascending and descending without pause. One ascent and one descent complete a celestial cycle.

When qi ascends, it is the Winter Solstice, the Zi hour—one yang is born beneath five yins, its hexagram being *Fu* (Return). Advancing and retreating to *Kun* (Earth), where six yins reach their extreme, it transforms and rises again. The two solstices and two equinoxes, the dark and bright moons, the crescents and full moons, the five phases and four images, the twenty-eight constellations, the three hundred and sixty-five degrees—all converge in a single moment. Thus, one moment contains the qi-image of a year. A year has thirty-two thousand six hundred moments, and each must be harmonized. Except for the Mao and You hours, one can seize thirty thousand years of celestial destiny. All this silently accords with the creative work of heaven and earth—it is not a method bound by rigid forms or clinging to images.

**Chapter Ten: Refining Qi into Spirit**
At this time, qi and pulse are harmonized, spirit is refreshed and clear—radiant as one freshly bathed, awakened from sleep, or lovers united in joy, mother and child in tender embrace. Spirit embraces qi, and qi embraces spirit. Day by day, month by month, they merge and intermingle, forging a single whole. Yin is exhausted, and pure yang is achieved—thus the true person is formed.

When the embryo is shed and spirit transforms, a body exists beyond the body. Gathered, it takes form; scattered, it becomes mist. Coming and going without hindrance, its numinous display is effortless. Creation cannot restrain it, yin and yang cannot control it, ghosts and spirits cannot fathom it, cold and heat cannot assail it. It roams freely in the realm of nothingness, its body one with emptiness and non-being.
