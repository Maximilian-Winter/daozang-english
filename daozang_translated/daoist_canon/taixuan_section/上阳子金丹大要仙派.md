### **The Lineage of Supreme Yang’s Essential Teachings on the Golden Elixir**

#### **The Immortal Lineage**
**Primordial Laozi of the Supreme Ultimate and Precelestial Realm**
At the inception of the Mysterious-Ultimate Heavenly Thearch, the Supreme Ultimate first gave birth to Three: the Mysterious, the Primordial, and the Originator.
The Originator *qi* transformed and generated the Primordial Laozi.
Since then, the Primordial Laozi has ceaselessly descended and regenerated through the Mysterious *qi*.

**The Ten Thousand Dharmas Heavenly Master**
**Ancient Great Master**
**Yu Hua Zi**
**Da Cheng Zi**
**Guang Cheng Zi**
**Sui Ying Zi**
**Chi Jing Zi**
**Lu Tu Zi**
**Wu Cheng Zi**
**Yin Shou Zi**
**Zhen Xing Zi**
**Xi Ze Zi**
**Ancient Yi Master**
**Jian Keng**
**Shang Rong**

Though the Primordial Laozi had, age after age, transformed and delivered beings, no trace of his earthly birth had yet manifested. Thus, in the reign of King Yang Jia of the Shang, the eighteenth sovereign, he lodged in the womb of the Mysterious Wondrous Jade Maiden for eighty-one years before being born as [King] Wu Ding.
In the *gengchen* year, on the fifteenth day of the second month, at the hour of *mao*, he descended into the world, taking the surname Li.

We now extend our entreaty, trusting in your gracious presence, humbly hoping for your lingering stay, that we may offer this devotion in reverence.

On this auspicious dawn of Pure Yang, we present our foolish sincerity in homage.

The candle—this single point of numinous radiance—has been abundant through all ages, pervading the ten directions, uniting the hidden and the manifest.
The unknowing regard it as mere fire passed on; the knowing declare it the nature of wisdom.
It kindles the heart in dark chambers, inspiring awe and turning the light inward;
It affirms the path to Heaven’s halls, enabling transcendence from the mundane to the sacred.

We bow twice and present the longevity candles for the ritual.

The incense—since the dawn of primordial antiquity, a single branch has emerged; what need awaits the Three Sovereigns or the passage of kalpas to diffuse its fragrance? The ignorant possess noses yet cannot discern; the noble discern fragrance and distinguish scent. Like the sacred master’s pinch of earth, everywhere it is fragrant; by virtue and power it is named, and all receive its benefit.

We bow twice and present the longevity incense.

The tea—first plucked as the sparrow’s tongue of early spring, the spear and banner of Grain Rain. Pouring the crab-eye bubbles, white blossoms float upon the bowl’s surface; ladling the Dragon Spring’s water, a transcendent breeze wafts from Penglai. Lu Tong with six bowls communed with immortals; Zhaozhou with one cup fathomed Buddha-nature. It rouses the drowsy, awakens the dull-witted immortal.

We bow twice and offer the tea.

The wine—heaven bestows sweet dew, earth wells forth sweet springs. The supreme flavor is *tīgho*, those who drink remain ever sober; the sage’s lees, attained through being yet returning to non-being. One sip drains the Western River, the countenance never ages; three cups penetrate the Great Dao, the dharma-body endures forever.

We bow twice and present the longevity wine.

The ritual proceeds.
Recitation of the *Heart-Imprint Sutra* and the *Thirty Chapters of Merit Sutra*.
A congratulatory memorial is prepared, to be respectfully presented on bended knee.

**Memorial in Celebration of Ancestral Master Zhongli**

A disciple of the Great Dao, [Name], on the fifteenth day of this month, reverently observes the propitious birth of Ancestral Master Zhongli, the Perfected Yang Emperor. In advance of this day, the fourteenth, I humbly present this memorial in celebration.

To the right, I prostrate in awe: the Dao is exalted, virtue is noble, gazing up to the teacher of ten thousand generations, whose yin is exhausted and yang is pure. At the auspicious dawn of the transcendent’s longevity, the moon is full in the heavens, auspicious vapors suffuse the mortal realm.

I kowtow twice, reverently reflecting upon Ancestral Master Zhongli, the Perfected Yang Emperor who awakened, transmitted the Dao, and bequeathed teachings—self-originating, prior to heaven and earth. Grasping heaven and earth as the crucible, refining *kan* to return to *li*; seizing the sun and moon as medicinal ingredients, taming dragons and subduing tigers. The Dao transcends the Supreme Ultimate, grace extends to all beings, enduring through kalpas, each person receiving deliverance. Following the transmissions of Pure Yang, Hai Chan, and Chongyang, the successive sages share one heart; since the aid of Dan Yang, Changchun, and Zi Yang, they have been fathers to the multitude. Merits defy praise in words, benevolence rivals the workings of creation.

I, of unrefined bone and unenlightened heart, yet hold true devotion to the Dao. By fortune, I have received the master’s decree: the Mysterious Female is the root of heaven and earth; detailed in the alchemical texts, essence and *qi* are the foundation of yin and yang. The numinous water of the Flowery Pond is called *qian*-metal; the flowing pearls of the earthen crucible are named *mu*-mercury. The two bowstrings unite as one body, gestating for ten months. What is most urgent is the instantaneous application of the wondrous; what is most difficult is maintaining true stillness in response to phenomena. Moreover, the foremost scripture is the supreme treasure, its discourse fraught with peril; the male tiger is merciless, instilling profound fear.

On this occasion of celebration, I recount these perils and hardships, humbly beseeching compassion and condescension to this lowly one. Grant me refuge in expedient means, that I may enter the chamber free of demons. The immortals’ days and months are long—what need for the felicitations of the mortal realm? When merit and conduct are complete in future years, I shall rely wholly on the master’s refinement.

May superior and worthy ones all comprehend the supreme Dao; may the deluded and deceived awaken to sincere faith. May rivers of ghee flow, *tīgho* anoint the crown; may earth become jasper, the land be gilded with gold.

I have presumptuously addressed the Perfected Master, trembling in awe.

With reverence and trepidation, I kowtow and bow twice, humbly submitting this memorial.

Year   Month   Day
Disciple of the Great Dao, [Name], Memorial in Celebration

**Memorial in Celebration of the Birthday of Ancestral Master Pure Yang**

A disciple of the Great Dao, [Name], on the fourteenth day of this month, reverently observes the auspicious birth of Ancestral Master Pure Yang, the Emperor of Manifest Transformation. I humbly present this memorial in celebration.

To the right, I prostrate in awe: the season arrives at Pure Yang, the moon first rounds on this night; heaven concentrates primordial *qi*, its course already fulfilled over many years. The cosmos rejoices, immortals and mortals offer felicitations.

I kowtow twice, reverently reflecting upon Ancestral Master Pure Yang, the Emperor who propagated the true and admonished transformation—his Dao towers through the ages, his auspiciousness purifies all spirits. Inwardly observing the heart, outwardly observing the form, he thus attained the mysteries of preserving the body; observing the apertures through being, observing the wondrous through non-being, all converge at the gate of manifold wonders. Drawing from the utmost clarity of the water’s source, he refined the golden elixir to early completion. The green serpent coiled in his sleeve, he crossed Dongting reciting verses; before the Yellow Crane Tower, he concealed himself among city cliffs, playing the flute. In jest, he transformed a maid into an immortal; aspiring to soar southward, he nearly reached Mount Hua. Riding a green ox, he entered grotto-heavens; astride a white deer, he traversed the vast seas. He attained the rank of Perfected Emperor, his merit spanning past and present; he widely transmitted the truth of the Dao and virtue, his lineage spreading south and north.

Though he desired to save the world, people did not recognize him; though I sought him, the karmic conditions were not yet ripe.

I humbly reflect: I was ignorant of the Mysterious Female’s decree, yet by fortune encountered the true master’s initiation. Only then did I realize the Dao is not revealed through words, and only then did I know the matter belongs to mind-to-mind transmission. One must seek the eight taels of *qian*-metal, first clarifying host and guest; then circulate the half-catty of *mu*-mercury, harmonizing yin and yang. Refine them into one mass, maintain it for ten months, silently listening for the dragon’s roar and tiger’s howl, ensuring the water does not dry nor the fire grow cold. To attain cessation here is fraught with fear; in haste and confusion, I forget even to eat.

If I might receive compassion and obtain a draught of the medicinal spoon, reviving this feeble remnant, I would intimately know the fire’s timing. Though I have nothing to repay, I rely on the love of life.

Fortunately, I encounter this flourishing era and rejoice in this auspicious dawn. I dare present my humble sincerity, bowing from afar to the immortal’s majesty. Though I presume the exalted one resides in the celestial bureau of retribution, I imagine he bestows mercy upon this novice. Though I do not presume upon mortal felicitations, I thus pour forth my heartfelt plea. May he secretly assist this mortal frame, that I may early gather the medicinal ingredients. Gathering the supreme treasure of the foremost scripture, may inner and outer be without fault; refining the primordial *qi* of the One Breath, may beginning and end be perfectly good.

With no demonic obstructions, the mind’s numinosity is revealed.
Then swiftly commence cultivation—who would not wish this?
And with the body settled in expedient means, tasks are easily accomplished.

Next, may the superior and worthy, all enlightened to the supreme Dao,
together with the previous assembly, present their covenanted petitions and memorials,
reverently proclaiming before the assembly:

The Dao disciple [Name], on this fourteenth day of the present month,
reverently encounters the auspicious birth anniversary of Patriarch Pure Yang Emperor Lord,
and on the fifteenth day reverently encounters the auspicious birth anniversary of Patriarch Orthodox Yang Emperor Lord.
Respectfully preparing incense and candles, on this fourteenth day,
a memorial is jointly submitted in celebration—now duly completed.

We humbly receive the joint covenant-seal of the exalted immortals and host of sages,
devoutly offering paper wealth, and earnestly prostrating in gratitude.
We pray for protection in Dao-learning, free from demonic interference,
and for a share in immortal cultivation, beseeching compassionate mercy
to secretly assist in peril and hardship.
May we enter the chamber and perfect our work, the fire’s timing unerring;
early shed the mortal coil and transform through spirit, ascending to join the immortal ranks.

Next, may the superior and worthy, all enlightened to the supreme Dao,
awaken the deluded and deceived, that they may repent and arouse the mind of faith.

Amid rivers of clarified butter and streams of ghee poured upon the crown,
jade-green earth and golden lands spread boundless.
Daring to offend the master’s solemn dignity, we yet presume to proclaim without end.

To the right, this memorial is respectfully submitted with bowed head:
The Primordial Dao-Ancestor, Most High Lord Lao;
The Three Teachings’ Enlightened Perfected Sages and Immortal Masters;
The Celestial Worthy of Literary Beginnings, Master Yin—
as previously invoked, their divine ranks are inscribed without addition or omission.

**Prayer for Sending Forth the Divine**
The sentiments just expressed have dared to strain your enlightened hearing;
we humbly implore your compassion and broad grace in reception and guidance.
Though you condescend to descend from the celestial realms to this dusty world,
your awe and reverence leave us overwhelmed;
as you return to wander the Isles of Peng, your lingering affection remains deep.
Now, at this hour of reverent farewell, we bear the shame of this empty abode.

We have heard:
Walking alone, sitting alone, one’s name yet stirs the hearts of emperors;
unseen, unknown, one’s verses still resound in the ears of ministers.
How much can mortal eyes perceive?
A single grain of golden elixir secures eternal life.
This meeting was not without cause—our heart’s plea longs to be voiced;
though all the world seeks this Dao, its truth remains elusive.
To begin practice swiftly is already too late—who in this world can truly walk this path?
This body has already transcended the Three Thousand Realms,
as of old you bestowed upon Zhang the Painter;
now you promise me a journey to the Five Emperors’ realm—
we pray you take pity on these mortal bones.
Do not say the common folk are doomed to thin fate;
grant this poor scholar the elixir to transform his frame.

The Perfected One now roams the Jade Clarity,
sword resting by the twin rivers’ shore;
since the Master’s departure, he should not age—
his body dwells in the Great Mystery Heaven.
Coming without shadow, going without trace,
he rectifies the celestial registers of immortals;
hearing not, seeing not,
he serves the Jade Emperor and returns to Grand Purity.

Our presumption runs deep—with wholehearted devotion, we bow in farewell.

Here ends the *Golden Elixir Essentials of the Immortal Lineage of Shangyangzi*.
