### *The Mysterious Azure Casket of Numinous Treasure: Scripture of the Gathering of the Profound, Scroll One*
**Section of the Crimson Clarity Unfolding the Diagram**

The celestial writ reveals the great Dao,
suddenly disclosing its root and source.
It governs with a fundamental principle,
converges upon an original essence.
Encompassing Heaven and Earth,
it penetrates the obscure and profound.
Yin and Yang pair in harmony,
the Way of Heaven unfolds naturally.

The Mysterious and the Yellow establish their positions,
then divide into two:
the light and pure ascend to cover the Earth,
the heavy and turbid descend to support Heaven.
The light and pure accumulate as qi,
transforming into clouds and mist.
The heavy and turbid accumulate as qi,
and water emerges from lofty sources.
When the singular qi transforms into water,
the *Kan* trigram is born.

- **Winter Solstice** (upper)
- **Summer Solstice** (upper)
- **Awakening of Insects** (upper)
- **White Dew** (upper)
- **Pure Brightness** (middle)
- **Cold Dew** (middle)
- **Beginning of Summer** (middle)
- **Beginning of Winter** (middle)

The *Kan* trigram arises at *zi*,
the place where Yang qi first stirs.
All things begin to move,
sprouts gradually flourish.
Heaven begins to spread its Yang qi,
and humans advance in their constant Way.
To divine for a person:
when one seeks to initiate new affairs, this is the beginning.
*Kan* is the center of Heaven and Earth,
movement as if midway on the path.
Only when the stars are prosperous and the gates aligned
can matters be accomplished.

The second qi is Earth,
linked with the terrestrial realm.
Within water, Yang gathers,
forming mountains, stones, cities, and rivers.
Yin and Yang intertwine,
and the spirit of the *Kun* trigram is complete.
Beneath the clouds and mist,
above the earth and stone,
Yin essence congeals,
while Yang ascends and advances.

- **Lesser Cold** (upper)
- **Lesser Heat** (upper)
- **Beginning of Spring** (lower)
- **Beginning of Autumn** (lower)
- **Grain Rain** (middle)
- **Frost Descent** (middle)
- **Lesser Fullness** (middle)
- **Lesser Snow** (middle)

The *Kun* trigram resides at *shen*,
the utmost Yin, most yielding.
*(Text incomplete: "First missing passage...")*
Mother of beginnings and endings,
obscuring movement and stillness.
*(Text incomplete: "No missing passage...")*
It can proceed but cannot halt,
can devise plans but cannot see their end.

The third qi is Wood,
sprouting forth from the Earth.
The *Zhen* trigram holds its proper position.

- **Greater Cold** (upper)
- **Greater Heat** (upper)
- **Spring Equinox** (upper)
- **Autumn Equinox** (upper)
- **Rain Water** (lower)
- **End of Heat** (upper)
- **Grain in Ear** (middle)
- **Greater Snow** (middle)

The *Zhen* trigram arises at *mao*,
its thunderous might forging strength.
*Zhen* is movement,
and movement brings forth radiance,
gradually advancing with the benefit of nurturing winds,
enhancing growth and transformation.
Alternating flourishing and decline,
mutually dependent in their ebb and flow.
To divine for a person:
when one acts with plans and encounters others,
it is also called the Gate of Thunder.
In all matters, meeting the Ascending Gate brings surprise,
yet one has not yet entered its inner chamber.
Only when the stars are prosperous and the gates aligned
can all affairs be accomplished.

The fourth qi is the *Xun* trigram,
ordering the myriad things.
Wind moves within,
lightning flashes with fierce brilliance.

- **Winter Solstice** (lower)
- **Summer Solstice** (lower)
- **Awakening of Insects** (lower)
- **White Dew** (lower)
- **Pure Brightness** (upper)
- **Cold Dew** (upper)
- **Beginning of Summer** (upper)
- **Beginning of Winter** (upper)

The *Xun* trigram engenders at *si*,
termed the Four Voids—
where the hundred rivers overflow,
all returning to it.
When the great departs and the small arrives,
Heaven and Earth have not yet conjoined,
yet the myriad things first intermingle.
Yin and Yang have already merged,
yet the qi of the trigrams remains unaligned.
What first takes form flourishes,
while what has already sprouted fails to grow.
To divine for a person:
one may act before or after,
affairs reach their inception
but are obstructed at their sprouting.
The trigram’s image is vast—
even rivers and seas return to it.
In all matters, one should seek the mean as an omen.

The Hundred Spirits first take form,
the Central Five Qi.
Heaven first covers... [text corrupt]
the Five Qi intermingling,
humankind begins here.

- **Minor Cold** (lower)
- **Minor Heat** (lower)
- **Beginning of Spring** (middle)
- **Beginning of Autumn** (middle)
- **Grain Rain** (upper)
- **Frost’s Descent** (upper)
- **Grain in Ear** (upper)
- **Minor Snow** (upper)

The Canon states: The central image is void,
referring to the position of *wu* and *ji*.
Earth is lodged in *Kun*,
borne by the Mother.
The myriad things obtain it to live,
governed by it to grow.
When mountains and rivers take shape,
the Hundred Spirits first emerge.
The numbers of Heaven and Earth—
five times five makes twenty-five,
completing the Great Dao
and activating the spirits.
The Six Qi are vigorous and bright,
firm and yielding each in its place.
The myriad things all flourish,
Yin and Yang greatly prosper.
The hundred vessels first open,
*Qian* and *Kun* radiate splendor.

- **Major Cold** (lower)
- **Major Heat** (lower)
- **Spring Equinox** (lower)
- **Autumn Equinox** (lower)
- **Rain Water** (middle)
- **End of Heat** (middle)
- **Grain in Beard** (upper)
- **Major Snow** (upper)

The *Qian* hexagram generates *Hai*,
where Yin qi reaches its extreme.
Thus, in the Dao of transformation,
when the decisive moment comes, Yin must retreat,
and pure Yang begins to arise—
this is the meaning of the small departing and the great arriving.
Metal and Water interflow,
directly generating through greatness.
Thus, *Qian* in stillness is focused,
in movement is single-minded.
The firmness of Heaven inclines above,
and the sun and moon return to it.
When divining human fortune or misfortune,
the signs are half in hesitation, cycling endlessly—
proceeding thus, there must be breaks and omissions.
Metal qi lacks support,
and the force of withering arrives.
Unwittingly, a chill descends,
and the hexagram emerges from *Dui*.

None escape the seventh,
as Heaven and Earth startle in smoke.

- **Winter Solstice** (middle)
- **Summer Solstice** (middle)
- **Awakening of Insects** (middle)
- **White Dew** (middle)
- **Pure Brightness** (middle)
- **Cold Dew** (lower)
- **Beginning of Summer** (lower)
- **Beginning of Winter** (lower)

The *Dui* hexagram generates *You*,
where the gate of the moon is tied.
The setting sun wanes and declines,
and the myriad things age and die.
It enforces the withering command,
hence called the place where Heaven and Earth reward good and punish evil.
*Dui* means joy.
When divining, one may encounter disputes or lawsuits,
unable to clarify reason—
the schemes of the secretive will be exposed.
It is also the gate of the sun and moon,
so all matters will be obstructed in the end.

*Gen* halts at eight,
where the myriad things harbor destruction.
Fire emerges in *Yin*,
forging the seven metals.
Looking down, one sees the pit of *Kan*;
gazing up, the brightness of *Li*.

- **Minor Cold** (middle)
- **Minor Heat** (middle)
- **Beginning of Spring** (upper)
- **Beginning of Autumn** (upper)
- **Grain Rain** (lower)
- **Frost’s Descent** (lower)
- **Lesser Fullness** (lower)
- **Minor Snow** (lower)

The *Gen* hexagram arises in *Yin*,
where advance and retreat know no constancy.
When it is time to halt, halt;
when it is time to move, move.
In motion and stillness, one does not miss the proper moment—
*Gen* means halting where one ought to halt.
When divining, one’s advance or retreat
will not depart from one’s dwelling.
In the month of *Jianyin*,
the yang qi greatly extends.
One may advance but must not retreat—
this is the time to press forward.
Fire blazes above,
water moistens below.
Within their interplay,
day and night are divided.
At night, the yang ascends ninefold,
inverting and transforming all.

- **Major Cold** (middle)
- **Major Heat** (middle)
- **Spring Waters** (middle)
- **Autumn Equinox** (upper)
- **Rain Water** (middle)
- **End of Heat** (lower)
- **Grain in Ear** (lower)
- **Major Snow** (lower)

The *Li* hexagram arises in *Wu*,
where yin qi is born.
The yang qi divides its position,
and the two encroach upon each other.
The firm resides without,
yet can remain settled;
the yielding lies within,
yet cannot fix its place.
The great departs, the small arrives—
brightness yet [lacuna].
When [lacuna] is exhausted,
affairs will perish.
When divining, one may encounter unrighteous principles.
Aligning qi and transcending spirit,
one relies on the eight trigrams of the palace.
Splitting and uniting, waxing and waning,
rising and falling alternate.
North and south traverse,
forming winter and summer;
east and west emerge and submerge,
dividing day and night.
The sun and moon cycle endlessly,
never failing to meet in due course.

Heaven is *Qian*, father of the myriad sounds;
Earth is *Kun*, mother of the myriad things.
When yin qi has waned,
*Xun* becomes the eldest daughter.
It weaves through the nine voids,
encompassing the eight lands,
aligning the seven luminaries,
and returning to the Purple Tenuity.
It binds the warp of Heaven and Earth,
the stars and sun follow the turning jade.
The pivot is fixed in *Kan*,
the Dipper’s handle points high.
The ten thousand forms array in order—
Heaven’s rigidity directs the lunar generals.
Day and night divide swift and slow.
The yellow, red, and black paths
follow the shortness of the *Kui*.
The ten thousand forms hang in display,
encircling and guarding the imperial enclosure.
The four poles establish the great luminaries,
the four seasons are woven by their warp and weft.

The Eastern Palace of the Great Sun Sovereign,
Jupiter in the Celestial Palace of *Tianpeng*.
The Azure Spring governs the south;
Mars, the Earth-Water Palace, *Luoshu* and *Tianyou*.
The Vermilion Summer governs the west,
overseeing the middle realm—
the Moon, Venus, Saturn, Venus again,
*Ketu*, *Moon Comet*, and *Black Killer*.
The White Autumn governs the north;
Mercury, the Dark Warrior of the deep.
The Black Winter governs—
the twenty-eight lodgings:
*Jiao, Kang, Di, Fang, Xin, Wei, Ji, Dou, Niu, Nü, Xu, Wei, Shi, Bi, Kui, Lou, Wei, Mao, Bi, Zi, Shen, Jing, Gui, Liu, Xing, Zhang, Yi, Zhen*.
Beyond their circuit lie the thirty-six secondary luminaries.

The August Supreme Purity,
the primal script of the empty ultimate.
From the radiant brush’s movement,
the plain and unchanging unfolds.
The chariot ascends the cliff,
resolving filial reverence and profound reflection.

The Celestial Cloud’s Azure Pearl,
the radiant blossoms gleam in emptiness.
The Hall of Auspicious Longevity,
soaring illumination descends upon the sun.
In due season, all stars harmonize and assist,
the Five Phases and four cardinal directions.
They govern the qi and the fortunes of the age,
the rise and fall of humanity.
Regulating yin and yang,
eternal order may thus be anticipated.

**Thunder, Wind, and Rain Division**
The Great Unity’s thunder,
linked to the Eight Trigrams.
Heavenly Impulse shatters the armies;
the Thunder Ancestor, the Great Emperor.
When the movement enters the Qian Palace,
it is called the Opening of Heaven.
When it enters the Kun Palace,
it is called the Closing of Earth.
When it enters the Xun Palace,
it is named the Master of Wind.
When it enters the Kan Palace,
it is named the Master of Rain.
When it enters the Gen Palace,
it is named Mount Fan.
When it enters the Dui Palace,
it is named Overturned Waters.
When it enters the Zhen Palace,
it is named □□.
When it enters the Li Palace,
it is named the Convergence of Lightning.

There is also the Wounding Gate,
the Thunder Deity in direct service.
In Qian, the thunderbolt;
in □, □□.
On high, lightning flashes;
in Kan, rain arises.
In Dui, it severs things;
in Zhen, it strikes men.
In Kun and Gen,
□□□□.

Further, when in exaltation or prosperity,
the yang agent soars high.
When in decline or imprisonment,
the yin agent’s power wanes, low and faint.
After the turning of the seasons,
when □□□,
yin and yang alternate between brightness and obscurity,
prefiguring the celestial mechanism.

Earthly qi ascends,
clouds form in the void like celestial script.
The numbers of generation and completion
precede the *Hetu*.
Gui divides into ten exhaustions;
yin begins with thirteen origins.
Zi, Chou, Si, Wu,
Jia Shen adds Ji Wei—
the azure and yellow qi
reside in maternal nurturance,
released and dispersed in Qian.
Yi and Ding emerge from Zhen;
Ren Wu aligns at the shoulder.
Bing and Xin govern Xu and Hai,
the source of Dui’s marshes.
Mao and You are the gates of sun and moon;
Gen is the pivot of the door.
Geng Chen roams the upper trigram;
Wing’s fire star blazes,
its path traversing the Black Road,
luminous and perfectly round.

Further, when celestial qi descends,
the primordial constellation of the Southern Asterism
presides over the Bureau of Wind and Rain.
Next, its two envoys:
the Wind Master moves in reverse through the branches,
the Rain Master proceeds in order through the seasons,
both subordinate to the element of Water.
When wind arises in the moon,
fire scatters metal;
wood halts the sun;
earth subtly restrains wood.
Metal’s void mists metal and water;
when clouds lower, water and fire rage greatly,
the moon’s waters drip and flow.

The Great Yin’s solitary luminary
traverses the Black Road.
Heaven enacts its full mechanism,
the balance entering the Thunder Bureau.
Before the assembly of all spirits,
there is either rain or darkness.
When the Moon Bird’s spirit converges,
the balance enters Wei,
descending only into obscurity and confusion.
If encountering celestial stars,
the wind, water, and fire deities return to the four cardinal directions—
fierce winds snap trees,
mountains and peaks crumble and shatter.

When hoping for clear skies,
yin descends and yang ceases;
yang descends and yin vanishes.
Only through the Southern Asterism’s palace of control
does radiant clarity appear at once.
If the phases generate one another,
or if like kinds approach their mothers,
clouds gather and thicken,
darkening the empty sky.

Further to be avoided:
when Venus and Mars appear together,
or when azure and vermilion share the same position,
the moon traverses the Black Road—
then wind and thunder reverse and arise.
When the Great Yin aligns with You,
the wind rages unabated;
when rain arrives,
the Great Yin aligns with Mao—
rain gives birth to violent thunder,
rolling thunder shakes the rain.
When the Great Yin traverses the Mansion of Net,
dust flies and soil scatters.
When the Moon’s course reaches the Mansion of Winnowing Basket,
and the Great Yin departs from the Mansion of Net,
wind stirs the Celestial Minister.
If it leaves the Mansion of Winnowing Basket,
rain emerges from the celestial mechanism—
wind is the flourishing qi of yin and yang.

The Celestial Storehouse and Celestial Sameness
are the places where wind perishes.
The Celestial Beam and Celestial Pivot
are the vast domains of wind.
The Celestial Minister and Celestial Mechanism
are the officers who govern wind and rain.
The sun and moon’s movements
also pass through Qian and Kan.
Divided between two paths,
only the Black Road governs wind.
Emerging from the Nine Earths,
it appears and vanishes without trace.

The profound mystery of the Essential Mystery
divides between summer and winter.
The Thunder Bureau
has major and minor divisions.
The major division is the Bureau;
the minor division is the Palace.
Entering the Bureau governs rain;
entering the Palace governs wind.
The celestial mechanism resides in the sun,
□□□□.
Seeking the root and tracing the source,
transformation and evasion interpenetrate.
Three returns of day and night,
water and fire attack one another.
Three essentials of movement and stillness,
□□□□.
Direct service and hidden resonance
discuss the sun’s true lineage.
The two preceding and following celestial bodies
first descend within it.
The natural Dao
does not □□□.
Once yin and yang are divided,
the reckoning of wind and rain concludes.

**Nine August Sovereigns and Direct Talismans Division**
In the first configuration of the Yang Evasion,
on Bing or Xin days during the Wu Zi hour,
take Jia Shen’s Heavenly Impulse as the Direct Talisman,
adding it to Yi Palace’s six Wu’s Heavenly Penetrator hour.
Majestic are the Nine August Ones,
the Direct Talismans of the Nine Palaces.
They govern the primal qi,
transforming without end.

Each nature has its constancy, and all affairs submit to it.
Heavenly Penetrator’s Zi Qin
ensures enduring stability.
Water disasters and fire thefts—
none more dire in their omen.
For border pacification,
fortifying walls and piling earth,
or journeys of a thousand li,
these are ill-suited.
To establish camps and build strongholds,
Heavenly Penetrator is unfavorable.
In spring and summer, employ it—
military might roars.
For weddings or executions of noble wives,
burials bring prosperity.
In autumn and winter,
harvests dwindle for the lord.
Construction brings misfortune,
flames scorch the sky.
If divining a long absence,
a thousand li will see your return.

Heavenly Inner’s Zi Cheng—
its talisman and time-stem both align with the Heavenly Inner hour.
Revering the Dao above,
transmitting lineage and forging bonds,
harmony prevails.
If plotting unrighteous deeds,
curses and pestilence strike.
Marching to war or beheading generals,
men and horses meet no success.
For weddings or construction,
autumn and winter are favorable.
Relocation brings misfortune,
officials and thieves attack in tandem.
Two hundred li of calamity—
spring and summer bring their meeting.
Travelers return,
rain and mist shroud the way.

Deploying troops a thousand li,
might illuminates the northern court.
For official posts and martial affairs,
construction brings auspicious omens.
Marriages and relocations—
in spring and summer, joy abounds.
In autumn and winter, thieves and bandits
must not be confronted.
For military campaigns or commerce,
all affairs fail.

Heavenly Bird resides at the center,
sacrifices and prayers seek blessings.
In battle, divine aid—
its virtue named Zi Gong.
Pursuing vengeance and suppressing rebels,
success is never empty.
Autumn and winter bring great fortune,
spring and summer, frequent misfortune.
For marriages, commerce, and burials,
prosperity is especially profound.
Official posts bring great fortune,
all four seasons harmonious.

Qian Palace’s Zi Xiang

□□□□,
celebrations and felicitations reach fulfillment.
In battle, great victory—
the star of the Sun and Heavenly Task.
Marriages birth noble sons,

□□□□ ensures peace and tranquility.

Zi Fang’s direct hour—
long journeys bring joy.
Summoning harmony achieves success,
the star of the Sun and Heavenly Hero.
Deploying troops or waging battle,
soldiers suffer losses.
Do not speak of relocation—
firelight arises.
Building camps or constructing halls,
waists and eyes groan in pain.
When the weak follow the strong,
disaster strikes deeply.
Heaven’s numbers govern this—
all must revere and honor.

**Eight Trigrams’ Direct Affairs Division**
The eight gates’ direct affairs
divide by reversal and sequence.
Qian’s virtue opens,
its governance belongs to Metal.
For undertakings and games of chance,
great fortune in distant expeditions.

Kan Palace’s Resting Water—
all affairs must be clear.
Construction favors advancement,
seeking harmony and deploying troops.
Private schemes fulfill desires,
friendly gains in military campaigns.

Gen’s Mountainous Succession—
planning and initiating affairs.
Unfavorable for invasion,
favorable for visiting nobles.
In battle, defeat—
suffering Heaven’s punishment instead.

Zhen’s Injury governs—
assistance and execution bring satisfaction.
Suppressing traitors and capturing bandits,
seizing them mid-journey.
Auspicious actions employed,
yet calamity remains.

Xun’s spirit blocks and seals,
punishing errors and fleeing.
A hundred fail for every one that succeeds,
encountering evil men on the path.
The brilliance of Jing—
submitting memorials and presenting petitions.
Also favorable for □ formations,
also favorable for Xun’s troops.
Auspicious actions follow the middle way,
lost items harm the spirit.

Kun’s corner receives death—
punishment of annihilation.
Unfavorable for going out or coming in,
illness and disease arise together.
If undertaking auspicious affairs,
men quarrel and wealth is contested.

Dui’s Beam and Surprise Gate—
ambushes and captures bring satisfaction.
Breaking sieges and attacking enemies,
others perish while we survive.
The weak follow the strong,
changing with the trigram’s shifts.
Reversal brings calamity,
urgency brings punishment.
When the day’s stem visits the trigram,
Heavenly Unity’s spirit—
Metal transforms and Water is born,
Water flows and Wood flourishes.
Wood stirs and Fire blazes,
Fire flames and Earth levels.
Earth’s essence and Metal grows,
above and below mutually sustain.
Thus, fortune is attained,
and all enjoys smooth passage.

Metal stirs and Wood breaks,
Wood stirs and Earth sprouts.
Earth stirs and Water extinguishes,
Water stirs and Fire turns to dust.
Fire stirs and Metal is flawed—
this is called reversal.
The son leads the father,
the younger brother presents his elder.
With Water obtaining Water,
ministers overstep their lord.
With Water obtaining Earth,
documents and official punishments.
With Earth obtaining Water,
talent and fortune contend.
With Wood obtaining Metal,
quarrels arise.
With Metal obtaining Fire,
perversity against human nature.
With Fire obtaining Water,
loss of □□□.

When talismanic affairs align,
whether lord or minister.
If the lord harms the minister,
worthies are cut off.
If the minister betrays the lord,
□□□□.
When lord and minister rejoice in meeting,
they mount chariots and ascend the clouds.

**Yin-Yang Transformation Division**
In the Great Beginning’s undifferentiated unity,
yin and yang delight in each other.
Thus, comet obstructions arise,
regrets and adversities diverge.
Obstructions flourish then wither,
the Azure Dragon turns its head.
Tombs collapse and flying crows,
Qian and Zhen block death.
Misfortune exists, fortune is absent—
stars and gates follow their sequence.
Proclaiming and grasping authority,
the White Tiger flees in rebellion.
Trapped wealth and the Dragon’s flight,
Kun’s height overturns them.
Affairs in decline and decay,
deploying troops brings illness.
Residents do not endure,
reckless words from the Vermilion Bird.
Worry over thieves and the victorious Snake,
positions divided between Qian and Xun.
Documents intersect,
surprise and worry breed suspicion.
Drawing in others,
affairs are often unreal.
Empty reputations and boasts—
two stars enter each other.
The Heavenly Gate at Gen’s corner—
governs strife.
Affairs delay and obstruct,
Metal enters affairs.
Treachery leads to loss,
the sovereign hesitates further.
Fire enters and retreats,
great punishments fly and hide.

Disaster and chaos from war’s □,
□□ must flee north.
Raising the body beyond bounds,
bandits and foes stand face to face.
Do not leave home—
official calamity and illness arrive.
Wealth collapses, plans go awry,
the Celestial Sovereign enters the White.
Disaster strikes the honored position,
affairs arise from within,
movement brings harm and error.
If war is spoken of,
the general will surely lose his home.
Venus enters Yi—
outer stillness, calamity and exhaustion.
When the Gate meets Venus,
those parted will reunite.
When Venus enters the Gate,
those united will separate.
Encountering it on the battlefield,
the army’s general loses his might.
Fortune and misfortune, survival and ruin—
to examine human affairs,
observe the patterns: as the pattern is, so is the response.
Follow the pattern to clarify.
Divining affairs, scrutinize Geng,
the year, month, day, and hour.
If meeting the Flying Stem,
joy lifts the brows.
If meeting the Hidden Pattern,
all matters reach fulfillment.
The year governs parents,
the month, siblings and kin.
The day governs oneself,
the hour, wife and children.
If divining loss,
follow the category to know the time.
When the hour is patterned, seize it in the hour;
when the year is patterned, pursue it in the year.
When the day is patterned, gain it on the day—
without pattern, the Three Auspicious remain.
When the tally conflicts with Mars,
vexation and trouble breed chaos.
When the Gate is adverse, the host loses;
schemes and rebellion invite mockery.
When the day or hour meets the Comet’s pattern,
affairs must guard against danger.
Darkness and obscurity connect—
thieves and bandits yet hold back.
When punishment and virtue gather,
movement and stillness follow the auspicious.
Transformations are endless,
Yang tally in Yang time.
Meeting an auspicious Gate,
all affairs may proceed.
When the tally is Yin and the general weak,
nothing is favorable.
With the auspicious but no Gate,
hardship arises within.
With the Gate but no auspicious,
the journey turns back midway.
Returning chants and hidden chants—
affairs are marked by doubt.
When Heaven and Earth unite,
residents must move.
No delay is permitted—
those united will separate.
Barriers and blockages □□,
□□ also delay.
Delay and know the Three Avoidances—
the Five Powers do not arrive.
Exhaustion and Qian fall into Yang,
Palace Gen and Xun hasten.
Reaching Heaven’s □□,
the host declares the opening hour.
Opening brings passage and fortune,
closure brings blockage and peril.
The method of correspondence—
directly apply it in the moment.
□□□□,
not to be compared or equated.
Heaven and Earth intertwine,
acting below.
Opening—people come;
closure—people do not return.
Palace □□□,
the host loses great affairs.
Harm to the body, ruin of wealth—
grief and injury appear at once.
When the palace spirit and virtue unite,
former envoys may be recalled.
Violating the tomb’s pressure—
the timid hare harbors many doubts.
The Three Origins and Nine Escapes—
greatly seize their time.
Sun and Moon flow with essence,
illuminating ten thousand miles.
Regret and lost hopes—
entering the tomb with the Three Auspicious.
Dusk and dawn obscured,
right becomes wrong.
When the Five Phases do not meet,
nothing should be done.
Yin and Yang consume each other,
leading to discord.
When the Six Jia find their agent,
their use carries authority.
When the Auspicious Gate is pressured,
empty affairs thunder like lightning.
Adding the tomb of the auspicious—
schemers’ hearts turn to ash.
Beneath the Nine Earths—
great advantage in concealment.
Above the Nine Heavens—
calmly wage war and raise banners.
Great Yin and Six Harmonies—
private schemes trigger mechanisms.
In the palace of the Hook Spirit,
lawsuits may be relied upon.
Violating the tomb’s pressure—
what is achieved will turn perilous.
□□ Six Jia,
joyful and carefree.
Gathering friends and summoning generals,
each delights in mirth.
When the Surprise Gate is above,
struggle and conflict persist.
The Jade Maiden guards the door,
practicing snow’s beauty in play.
Private desires fulfilled,
documents shine with light.
Holding grudges and avenging shame—
Heaven aids the timely.
Supporting the loyal and good,
cutting away the crooked and false.
Axes at the neck—
heavenly spirits protect them.
Lawsuits, escapes, lost prisoners—
divine the net to deduce.
Kan, Kun, Zhen, Xun—
lawsuits enter, escapes return.
Qian, Dui, Gen, high—
lawsuits depart, escapes pursued.
Five Tones and surname numbers:
Shang is Metal, Gong is Earth,
Zheng is Fire, Yu is Water,
Jue is Wood’s thunder.
Yin and Yang □ duties—
battle qi rises and falls.
In Yang time, gain advantage—
raise drums and unfurl banners.
The □ prevails,
with the black Yang’s might.
In Yin time, battle—
gag the horses, make no sound.
With stillness, the guest prevails—
this accords with Heaven’s mechanism.
Heavenly Stems fix positions,
descending to the next Branch.
One Stem, one Branch—
each has its proper place.

roam the Eight Directions.
Not falling into Yin positions—
great advantage in punishing the barbarians.
Survival and ruin are determined—
regret and remorse do not depart.

**Method of Restraining and Subduing Spirits and Ghosts**

The method of Returning Closure—
revolve the Dipper, traverse the Winnowing Basket.
First Heaven, then Earth—
wind and rain do not shift.
Above, it responds to the Nine Stars;
below, it connects to the Nine Regions.
In the depths of darkness,
this teaching thoroughly knows.
Heaven’s Rigid and Vast Fall—
all methods are held within.
Relying on the Rigid Dipper,
chant □□□.
Never act recklessly in the four seasons—
apply it as you will.
Avoiding illness, spirits, and ghosts,
besieged in battle.
Subduing the dark and obscure—
□□□□.
Overturn the Dipper, strike the Pass,
and recite the incantation:
*"Wondrous is the Dipper’s essence—twelve spirits,
step the Celestial Stem □□□.
□□ resembling shadows floating on azure clouds,
seven transformations stirring to ascend Yang brightness.
Knowing change brings fortune and misfortune,
passing the Dipper □□□ the Heavenly Pass.
Align with the statutes and commands of Jia and Yi,
tread the Heavenly Flower, ride the Heavenly Task,
embrace the Heavenly Pillar to reach the Heavenly Heart.
By this measure ascend the Heavenly Quail,
lean on the Heavenly Auxiliary, tread the Heavenly Impulse.
Enter the Heavenly Inner, exit the Heavenly Soaring,
the Dipper’s Way unites rigidity and softness.
Heaven’s blessings and emoluments endure ten thousand generations,
the clear and cold spring—why sink into the depths?
Entering the boundless for a thousand myriad years,
the Vast Fall spirits expel all filth.
A thousand ghosts and ten thousand spirits all perish,
burying their heads in the earth, motionless and inert.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the law of the Nine Emperor Stars of the Northern Dipper commands!"*

Majestic and vast, the *Great Crimson Jade Peak Prohibited Writ*—
a method not for the middle or lower realms to hear.
Though the text is transmitted orally,
the secret lies in Heaven’s transmission.
Profane and impure true writs
do not ascend to immortals’ ranks.
To recklessly transmit and confuse the vulgar—
the sin accumulates beyond measure.
To lightly reveal the mechanism—
calamity extends to the nine clans.
Only those of determined will should keep it secret.

They can separate, they can unite; they can be yin, they can be yang.

**Receiving the Precepts and Passing Through the Passes and Departments**
Officials wielding authority—eight gates are most excellent.
The Six Spirits govern them, aiding the yang with the yin.
In yang years, the Open Gate prevails, with □ as the master.
Starting from *Qian* Palace at *zi*, follow the Nine Heavens’ Hall.
In yin years, the Restriction Gate prevails, with the Hook Spirit as master.
Starting from *zi* in reverse, next to the Nine Earths’ Side.
The year determines the starting month; the month determines the stake.
From the first, proceed to whichever direction.
Observe the tortoise and purify the talismans—*Kan* Palace is auspicious.
Sitting at the Wounding Gate, one’s position will not last long.
When stars enter the inner heavens, it is especially inauspicious.
*Peng* and *ying* clash with the pillar—if activated, misfortune arises.
The Surprise Gate in *Kan*—time passes in vain.
One will surely incur delays, returning home after repeated trials.

**Lower Era**
*Dead Gate*　　　　　　*Open Gate*
*Great Yin*　　　　　　*True Yang* (for yang years)

The *fu*-symbol moves in sequence. *Jing* Gate aligns with *Rest* Gate, six with the Nine Heavens.

**Upper Era**
*Pillar* Gate　　　　　　*Life* Gate
*Gouchen*　　　　　　Nine Earths

In yin years, begin at *zi* and proceed in reverse. From the year, determine the first month; from the month, proceed to the first day. If it meets the *Open* Gate, one enjoys peace from beginning to end, favor and grace overflow, and an audience with the sovereign. If it meets the *Rest* Gate, myriad affairs flourish, governance earns praise, and the Nine Heavens resound with acclaim. If it meets the *Life* Gate, rule is achieved without force; the eight directions yield without contest, and the Nine Earths submit in harmony. If it meets the *Jing* Gate, one gains public recognition and recommendation, fame spreads through the Six Harmonies, and imperial summons descend like wings. If it meets the *Restriction* Gate, *Gouchen* ascends above; water, fire, bandits, and thieves require vigilant preparation and regulation. If it meets the *Dead* Gate, *Great Yin* descends below; commands lose their rectitude, and mourning arrives swiftly. The *Wounding* and *Surprise* Gates lie in the directions of sun and moon; if the day encounters these two omens, hasten to conceal oneself.

Whenever the day is auspicious, one must also seek a favorable hour. When stars and gates align propitiously, great achievement is assured. Any encounter with *bei*-comets or clashes hinders official advancement. If *fu*-symbols and affairs conflict, failure and misfortune arise at once. When three auspicious gates stand together, one attains lasting eminence.

**Battle and Combat Section**
For any engagement in battle, first examine the day and hour. In yang hours, raise drums, sound bells, and unfurl banners. In yin hours, lie in ambush to diminish the enemy’s might. If our forces are few, we remain secure; if theirs are many, they face peril. In sudden clashes, follow the gates and secure the auspicious. Standing at *Tianyi*, blades shatter for a thousand miles. Next, occupy the *Direct Affair* position, and the enemy will fear like thunder. Strike from behind the living, attack the dead—victory is certain.

When skies are overcast and rain falls heavily, the four directions grow dim. Without clepsydra, distinguishing hours becomes difficult; one must rely on the moving *shi*-diagram or observe the *qi*. When *Qi* Gates converge, this is known in *si*, *wu*, and *wei*. If the day’s general coincides with the *Qi* Gate, they share the same rank. There are also three victories: the method of standing firm, striking the *White Traitor*, and facing the *Heavenly Gate*. Also, turn away from the moon’s establishment and next from the *Life Spirit*. When two stars enter one another, the *Horse* position vanishes. If all four directions scatter, security cannot be assured even at dawn or dusk. When *fu*-symbols align with *White*, the army suffers great loss. Under *Great Punishment* or *Flying*, chariots and horses are damaged and lost. When the Nine Stars weaken, defeat saps the soul.

Above the Nine Heavens, one may grandly display might. Below the Nine Earths, one may guard encampments. In the palace of *Great Yin*, concealment is as if divine. In the palace of the *Six Harmonies*, secret plans are stealthily executed. Great inauspiciousness and great slaughter occur when the palace is violated by *Gouchen*. *Jia* and *bing* interact, embodying the numen of power and virtue. The upper five are yang dwellings; the lower three are auspicious stars. If *Qi* Gates are not oppressed and star positions do not clash, applying these four principles ensures all affairs will be at peace.

When the hour’s stem overcomes the day, generals and lords gain hollow reputations. In marching armies or deploying formations, defeat and ruin follow. At rest, obscurity prevails; in action, no glory is won. When *bing* aligns with the *Dead* Gate, rebellion and chaos take shape. When *Dead* aligns with *bing*-auspicious, formations dissolve in chaos. When *bing* aligns with the *Wounding* Gate, battle brings ruin. When *Wounding* aligns with *bing*-auspicious, internal strife erupts. When *yi* aligns with the *Dead* Gate, encampments stand empty. When *Dead* aligns with *yi*-auspicious, weapons are lost. When *yi* aligns with the *Wounding* Gate, attacks must not be launched. When *Wounding* aligns with *yi*-auspicious, defeat is beyond recovery. If such configurations appear, the general must be cautious. Do not engage an advancing enemy; do not pursue a retreating one.

I impart to you one method: sever a peach branch from the shade, inscribe a talisman on its bark, and tread upon the *Dou*-ladle’s handle. Transform grasses and trees into soldiers to bolster our military might. Contend for mountains and seize strategic points to break enemy encirclements. Like casting a flaw at an egg, act in accord with the celestial patterns. Yet do not indulge in wanton slaughter, lest you incur delays. I admonish you, O accomplished general: rectify your heart and do not stray.

**Karmic Destiny and Human Relations Section**
Human bonds and marriages follow the diagrams of yin and yang. The *Zhoutang* and *Heavenly Auspice* take *East Zhen* as their model. In months with many days, begin at *Kan* and proceed to *Gen*’s door. In months with few days, begin at *Dui* and proceed in reverse to *Kun*’s corner. Entering *Xun* harms the father-in-law; entering *Gen* replaces the mother-in-law. Entering *Gao* wounds the elder brother; entering *Kan* overcomes the husband. Entering *Dui* kills the wife; entering *Qian* brings no misfortune. In the positions of *Qian*, *Kun*, and *Zhen*, blessings gather at the gate. When yin and yang have generals, stems and branches clash. The yin general kills the wife; the yang general kills the husband. When yin and yang lack generals, they align with the celestial tally.

Before the monthly taboo, take the heavenly stem; after the taboo, take the next branch for support. If stem and branch harmonize with the month, the absence of a general serves as elimination. Though the great method is thus, it does not yet align with the classics. To avoid disaster, first examine the Nine Stars. The Nine Palaces they govern divide fortune and misfortune distinctly. First determine *Tianpeng*, then take *Tianying*. The natures of water and fire bring only calamity.

The first palace is *Kan*; the second palace is *Kun*. One elder brother and two daughters—this is the present life’s fate. If the gate spirit is inauspicious, parents do not survive. Three wives are killed, and after parting, remarriage follows. When fate enters the *Zhen* palace, children are overcome entirely. If the gate is auspicious, one daughter remains, but the son becomes a disabled person. When fate enters the *Xun* palace, two pairs of children are born. If all are yang, half survive; if all are yin, the line is cut off. Adopting another surname, one must seek an outsider as heir. When fate enters the *Qian* palace, two chambers of children are born. Six sons are reared, three yin and three yang. Daughters are older, sons younger—thus one attains prominence. When fate enters the *Dui* palace, husband and wife do not clash. Four sons and three daughters ensure a peaceful life. When fate enters the *Gen* palace, parents part in life. The wife conceives no children; much loss and weariness follow. When fate enters the *Gao* palace, household and dwelling are not at peace. Abandoning ancestral legacy, many children and grandchildren arise. In later years, one son dissipates the family estate. One daughter brings sorrow; one son attains nobility.

Next are *Tianren*, *Tiannei*, and *Tianqin*. These three stars serve as envoys, their natures ever deep. When fate enters the *Kan* palace, two sons are born. When three yang disasters arrive, the mother falls ill and the son is separated. When fate enters the *Kun* palace, household and dwelling remain unclear.

When the gate aligns, fortune follows; when it misaligns, misfortune strikes. Offspring remain unsettled—some take the Dao, some become monks.

When fate enters the *Zhen* palace, two daughters are born. They may belong to two different clans, their yin and yang [fates] unclear. If a second wife is afflicted, three marriages are certain.

When fate enters the *Xun* palace, four sons and two daughters arise. Children and grandchildren thrive in prosperity; parents gain honor.

When fate enters the *Qian* palace, three persons of yin and yang appear. Three yang [forces] harm the wife; three yin [forces] slay the elder brother.

When fate enters the *Dui* palace, five sons and six daughters are born. Both monks and Daoists emerge from the household. If the gate is auspicious, this is permitted; if the gate is adverse, harm befalls parents, past and future.

When fate enters the *Gen* palace, husband and wife remain unsettled. Eight children are born, each fending for themselves. If the gate is auspicious, peace prevails; if the gate is inauspicious, illness follows.

When fate enters the *Li* palace, parents are separated. In old age, two sons are gained, though many are born and few survive. Another marriage follows, making one an adopted son-in-law.

Next are *Tianchong* and *Tianzhu*, with the Metal Spirit governing Wood. When fate enters the *Kan* palace, a wife taken from another household brings hardship. Eight daughters are born, six of whom die away from home.

When fate enters the *Kun* palace, youth is lost in dispersion. Of three persons, two are harmed, leaving one solitary in later years.

When fate enters the *Zhen* palace, parents are the first to perish. If not them, then brothers or the wife suffer affliction. If the gate is auspicious, one son is born, followed by two daughters. Even if fortune smiles, the maternal lineage is broken.

When fate enters the *Xun* palace, five yang and three yin [forces] arise. If the gate is auspicious, it becomes doubly so, and the household flourishes.

When fate enters the *Qian* palace, five sons and four daughters are born. Among them, a noble person emerges, though parents are separated.

When fate enters the *Gen* palace, daughters outnumber sons. Many wives are afflicted by misfortune; if not, they flee. The entire family’s lineage is cut off, and any remaining son must leave. Eight yang [forces] overcome six, dimming the eyes’ light. A child of another surname is fostered here, with the star residing in *Dui* and *Li*.

Next are *Tianfu* and *Tianxin*, whose blessings run deep.

When fate enters the *Kan* palace, five yang [forces] persist. One son flees, while another gains noble renown. The wife suffers childbirth calamity; ancestral wealth is divided and lost.

When fate enters the *Kun* palace, three sons and three daughters are born. If four daughters are born, one male offspring is surely lost. Leaving the ancestral home, one may yet become wealthy.

When fate enters the *Zhen* palace, four yang [sons] are born. Among them, one attains great nobility, and the household prospers.

When fate enters the *Xun* palace, four sons are born. Two grow immensely wealthy; two attain high rank. The lineage endures unbroken, with each generation surpassing the last in nobility.

When fate enters the *Qian* palace, a wife taken from another household is afflicted. If not, the lineage is cut off, and the household crumbles to ashes.

When fate enters the *Dui* palace, four sons and two daughters are born. The sons perish entirely, and two sets of parents are involved.

When fate enters the *Gen* palace, many children are conceived, but only one son survives. The wife afflicts five [others].

When fate enters the [missing] palace, [text unclear]. If not, separation follows. Three yang [forces] favor the state. Among them, a noble person emerges, and the household flourishes in abundance.

**Ten Thousand Images Unfolding Section**

For building houses and constructing dwellings, the Nine August Ones hold sway. The essentials lie in the *Qin* and *Fu* stars, with the *Tianxin* star arriving. The odd [trigrams] *Yi* and *Ding* [text unclear], while *Jia* and *Bing* exchange positions, and the palace spirits harmonize with virtue. When the Six *Jia* obtain their proper agents, salary and wealth increase. *Ding* and *Gui* combine; *Yi* and *Xin* share a tomb. When the Three Marvels enter the tomb, how can disaster be avoided? When two stars converge, great punishment or concealment follows. All *bo* and *ge* omens bring immediate sorrow.

Further examine the transforming *qi*, governed by the divine judgment of the stars. They shift into eight colors, arrayed in the Nine Palaces’ flight. In the Upper Era, the year *Jiazi* begins in *Kan*. The month *Yichou* reverses to *Gaokui*. *Bingyin* resides in *Gen*, proceeding in reverse order. In the Middle Era, the year *Jiazi* begins in *Xun*. The month *Yichou* reverses to *Zhen* as the mediator. In the Lower Era, the year *Jiazi* begins in *Dui*. The month *Yichou* reverses to *Qian* as the opener. Across the sixty positions, the sequence cycles in reverse.

The method of monthly colors also follows the Three Eras. In the Upper Era, the first month begins in *Gen*, the second in *Dui*, and the third in *Qian*. In the Middle Era, the first month begins in *Kun*, the second in *Kan*, and the third in *Gao*. In the Lower Era, the first month centers in the middle, the second in *Xun* (four), and the third in *Zhen*.

Each palace’s position is fixed, all originating from the central enclosure: one white, two black, three green, four azure, five yellow, six white, seven red (brilliant), eight white, nine purple—the origins of the Eight Trigrams.

For example, to determine the arrangement, take *Kan* as the model. One white becomes five, starting from the central palace. Two black flies to *Qian*, three green to *Dui*, four azure to *Gen*, five yellow to *Gao*, six white to *Kan*, seven red to *Kun*’s exterior, eight white to *Zhen*, and nine purple to *Xun*.

When construction aligns with six white, the *Kaimen*’s essence brings added family members and treasures, with joy and blessings arriving in full. When construction encounters two black, the *Simen*’s essence brings death’s energy. Legal troubles arise, and penal servitude is incurred. Widows, widowers, and couples suffer frequent bereavements.

When construction encounters three green, the *Shangmen*’s essence harms pregnant women, causing separation from flesh and blood. Death by violence or hanging occurs, and thieves become intimate.

When construction encounters four azure, the *Dumen*’s essence brings official lawsuits and peril, with jaundice plaguing the door. Disaster strikes the master, and misfortune is immediate.

When construction encounters five yellow, one offends the plague star. Heads are shaved and cangues locked; the six relations are severed. Doors close in distress, and heavenly calamities strike repeatedly.

When construction encounters six white, the *Kaimen*’s essence, in the months of *Hai* and *Zi*, brings added mouths and gold. Daoist priests interact, and unexpected treasures materialize.

When construction encounters seven red, the *Jingmen*’s essence [text unclear]. Chronic abdominal ailments arise, and petty people are constantly provoked.

When construction encounters eight white, the *Shengmen*’s essence [text unclear]. Family members increase, and the household flourishes.

When construction encounters nine purple, the *Jingmen*’s essence [text unclear]. Wealth and joy increase, with clear verification.

The eight gates of life and orientation follow this same principle.

**Severing Earthly Roots Section**

**Burial Methods**

Burial methods rely on the harmony of stems and branches with the numinous. On days of *Jia* and *Geng*, align with *Shen* and *Yin*. On days of *Bing* and *Ren*, align with *Chen*, *Wu*, and *Shen*. On days of the six *Ji*, align with *Wei* and *You*. On days of the six *Wu*, the *Dunjia* method is unheard of. For *Yi*, *Xin*, *Ding*, and *Gui*, align with *You* and pair accordingly.

The jade dog barks loudly, the golden rooster crows alone. The earthly tiger does not feed—thus may a thousand springs be preserved. On such days, the mountain’s orientation must accord with the *Qimen*. Below, it connects with earthly stars; above, it aligns with celestial bodies. The sitting mountain and burial site determine fortune or misfortune in advance.

*Yu* corresponds to *Lianzhen*, *Gong* to *Wenqu*, *Zheng* to *Pojun*, *Jiao* to *Jumen*, *Shang* to *Tanlang*—arising from the central courtyard. Next, they fly forth to *Qian*, with *Kan* and *Dui* as neighbors. If *Wenqu* is offended, the household will not prosper. Men wander from their homeland; women become licentious. If *Pojun* is offended, illness and lawsuits never cease. The eldest daughter kills her husband; the eldest son suffers execution. If *Lucun* is offended, descendants die young, hunchbacked and blind. If *Lianzhen* is offended, official troubles entangle, father and son part, and violent death strikes elsewhere.

*Tanlang*, *Wuqu*, *Fubi*, and *Jumen* bring official promotions and treasures, filling the household with blessings. If even one star is present, fame and profit soar. At the time of interment, the nine stars must also be fixed. *Qin Xin* clashes with the auspicious; next is *Fu* and *Tian Ren*. *Simen* conceals the extraordinary, as does *Kaimen*. Within a hundred days of burial, myriad fortunes arrive.

Sever the earthly door, erase the roots of death. Heaven and earth are fixed, and all states conceal their forms. The seven malevolent *Ci Xiong Sha* call to their neighbors. Triple the stakes against the three *Sha*, the *Tai Sui*, and all gods. How dare the host of evils dare to approach? Avoid startling *Shang*, harming *Du*, or disturbing *Jing*, *Xiu*, and *Sheng*. Worship the five without encounter, for the gate presses upon the ritual. The three wonders enter the tomb—*Fanfu* and *Fuyin*. *Kan* responds in one year, *Kun* in two springs. The nine palaces bring nine years of calamity. To discern the new and old, the burial site’s orientation holds no difficulty. Gather the mysteries and know without climbing.

First determine *Simen*, for it is the method’s foundation. The vanguard assists it; within the burial site’s orientation, prosperity lies beneath the branch, while decline and imprisonment face it. Next, the day’s tomb is the incoming mountain. The *Mingtang* releases water, and *Dengming* returns. The noble one [text unclear]. If reversed, the tiger departs, and the dragon rests at ease.

*Fanyin* of the eight trigrams, the returning dragon seeks. [Text unclear]. The three unions and six harmonies place ancestral graves beside. If yin and yang are incomplete, the later dragon is meager. The four boundaries [text unclear]. To the left and right before the tomb, the branch’s *Shi* is most favorable. *Hai* and *Zi* are separated by water; *Yin* and *Mao* by bridges. *Chou* is a field [text unclear]. Having undergone alterations and robberies, *Si* and *Wu* lie beside cellars. *Shen* is the official road; *Wei* is the village shrine. *You* is the temple; *Xu* is a desolate village. The day’s stem and branch mark the grave; within heaven, the master conceals. Earth gods and earthly generals double in pairs. Where wood is abundant, forests flourish; where water is abundant, streams flow long. Where fire is abundant, light shines; where earth is abundant, peaks rise. Where metal is abundant, rocks abound. The Dao does not propagate in vain.

This truly communicates with the numinous; the nine earths are not constant.

**Seizing Spirits and Capturing Ghosts Section**

All who live must die. When one offends their life star, longevity ends. To know the directions, begin with the eight trigrams. *Zi*, *Wu*, *Mao*, and *You* mark the beginning of a man’s life. At one year, *Gen* eight; at two years, *Li* nine. A woman’s life centers on five, with *Xun* four in reverse. *Yin*, *Shen*, *Ji*, and *Hai* take five as their standard. At two years, *Qian* six; for women, *Gen* in reverse. *Chen*, *Xu*, *Chou*, and *Wei* begin at *Kun Wei*. At two years, *Zhen* three; for women, *Kun* in reverse. At two years, it is *Kan*. Those who offend it become emaciated. From one to ten years, the remainder flies in sequence.

The life star’s malevolence lies in the opposing palace—where ghosts and spirits reside. Each attaches to its proper place: *Qian* is the heavenly gate, *Xun* the wind’s door, where the direct agent resides. Ghosts lurk at the fence. *Kan* is the water palace, *Li* the fire府, where the direct agent resides. Ghosts cling to the bedchamber. *Gen* is the hill’s goodness, *Kun* the earthly door, where the direct agent resides. Ghosts attach to the kitchen boy. Beside the *Ao* spirit, *Chen* departs and *You* returns. *Zhen* is the thunder gate, *Dui* the great marsh—within the ancestral hall. *You* departs, and the spirit returns.

The method of capture and extermination: whether ladder or matchmaker, above earth and below wood. This is the *Ao* mound—above metal and below wood. Who but the blade? The five phases match their images. Combine the forms and deduce. The method to assist childbirth: when yin and yang contend and one of the five phases is lacking, birth is delayed—deeply pitiable. Thus, the heavenly mechanism is revealed, and demons and evil flee. Mother and child separate; later sages emerge. Follow my rescue: for *Zhifu* *Jia* and *Yi*, drench with water. For *Zhifu* *Bing* and *Ding*, let fire encircle. For *Zhifu* *Wu* and *Ji*, let wood tilt. For *Zhifu* *Geng* and *Xin*, let fire burn the perimeter. For *Zhifu* *Ren* and *Gui*, let earth fly in segments. For metal, let it ring and hasten. *Fanyin* and *Fuyin*—the maternal family’s life returns. The five [text unclear] are complete. The descending calamity spirit [text unclear]—do not be startled or afraid. Thus may all be preserved without error. The *Zhishi* in the yang palace gives birth to sons; in the yin position, to daughters. [Text unclear] the great method of reversal and closure. All spirits obey the *Shenxiao* Jade Mansion. The eight trigrams’ thunder drives spirits and seizes ghosts. [Text unclear] the nine palaces turn once—heaven and earth take notice.

For all who wish to travel far, visit the noble, or marry, to market [text unclear], establish the gate and recite the incantation. First, exit the earthly door. The six *Jia* nine chapters: heaven is round, earth is square. The four seasons and five phases: green, red, white, yellow. *Taiyi* holds me; sun and moon are my light.

Test and walk with me to such-and-such a place.
In darkness and obscurity, none see my form.
People hear no sound; ghosts perceive no essence.
Those who favor me gain fortune; those who hate me meet calamity.
Let no evil ghosts witness my movements.

The eight extremities shine brightly, penetrating all within and without.

their souls scatter, their spirits wither.
Swift as the law commands.

Set forth outside the door, lock ghosts and bind spirits.
The Jade Maiden’s incantation says: Jade Maiden above, [such-and-such],
come swiftly to protect me.
Let no hundred ghosts or evil forces harm me.
Let no one see me as a person; let no one recognize me as human.
Those who see me take me for bundled firewood;
those who know me regard me as inhuman.
Open only my door, and close all others.
Swift as the law commands, close the door and depart.

Should battle arise suddenly without cease,
and urgency demand facing the enemy—
heaven and earth cannot form.
With the left hand, hold a blade and trace the earth for ten days.
Enter the courtyard at the day’s earthly branch.
Face south to establish the direction, recite the *Ding* stem’s incantation:
"[Such-and-such] *Jia* is in peril—assist and support me.
Conceal and hide me; let no enemy harm me.
Cause their five weapons to shatter themselves.
Those who face me perish; those who plot against me die.
Enemies die on their own; in darkness and silence, combatants are bewildered.
Gate and door spirits, [such-and-such], scatter their souls for me."
Swift as the law commands.

Exit by turning left. The gate and door spirits must also be known by name.

The city walls are firm, like golden barriers.
A thousand evils, ten thousand wickednesses—none dare approach."
Swift as the law commands.
[Text unclear], [text unclear], rectify oneself and practice—
a method surely verified.

**Water, Fire, Wind, and Thunder Division**
Wind and thunder clash—some swift, some slow. When thunder first sounds, it arises from the four corners. In the years of *shen-zi-chen*, the *Kun* Palace shakes with might. In the years of *yin-wu-xu*, it lingers in the *Gen* Palace. In the years of *hai-mao-wei*, the *Qian* Palace stirs to action. In the years of *si-you-chou*, the *Xun* Palace rumbles with thunder. Though a hundred *li* differ, the branches and stems do not predict it. To know the divisions of the land, observe the year, month, day, and hour:
*A* governs the Man barbarians, *B* the seas, extending to the Eastern Yi. *C* governs Chu, *D* Mount Tai, the Jiang and Huai, and the southern lands. *E* and *F* govern Han and Wei, the Central Plains and the Yellow and Ji Rivers. *G* governs Qin, *H* Mount Hua, the western lands first. *I* governs Yan, Zhao, and Wei, *J* awaits Changshan. *Zi* governs Zhou’s lands, *chou* Wei and Liaodong. *Yin* governs Zhao and Chu, *mao* Zheng and *shen* Qi. *Chen* governs Jin, Deng, and E; *si* Wei and *wu* Qin. *Wei* governs Liang and Song, *you* Lu and *xu* Zhao. *Xu* governs Wu and Yue as frontiers, *hai* serves as Yan’s matchmaker.

When the Directing Envoy approaches *Kun*, the Heavenly Prison is at its peak. The Impetuous Star and White Tiger, the Azure Dragon in the *Kun* corner—if not violent storms, then ceaseless rain; if not wind, then thunder. When ghosts appear in the *Shen* Palace, hail arises without doubt. The Heavenly Impetus, a single star, governs the crashing thunder. Falling in *Qian* or *Xun*, it follows the Peasant Star. If it meets the Vermilion Bird, the Remaining Serpent clings close. When the Injury Gate wields lightning, mountains and peaks collapse. The Dark Warrior and Supreme Yin obscure the Dipper’s brightness. Great Fortune and Small Fortune, the Curved Array and Queen of Heaven—dark clouds scatter at once, and the vast sky reveals rainbows. Sometimes it becomes the Day’s Horse, dense clouds yet no rain. If it attains the Sun’s Fortune, auspicious snow falls in flurries. The Heavenly Chief’s *Yi* star marks the time of ice, snow, and frost. The Queen of the Dark and Dark Warrior follow the Peasant Star in *hai* and *zi*. Heavy snow descends, drifting like jade fragments. If it approaches the Vermilion Bird, ashes scatter in swirls. With the addition of wandering winds, frost piles in mounds. When the Rain Master shares its position, snow and rain fall lightly. The Heavenly Rigor and Victorious Light may become the Sun’s Ruin. When the Directing Envoy enters *Xun*, snow is heavy and thunder roars. Earth’s *qi* leaks first, and yang *qi* retreats in decline. When the Heavenly Chief is in *Zhen*, the Six Harmonies also shake. The Five Thunders serve as envoys, and the method governs great snow. For a month without brightness, [text missing], [text missing] the Heavenly Flower.

When the Great Unity forms a union, the Ascending Light and Noble One—when the gods and generals are in prosperity, clouds and rain arise abundantly. When the Robber Star hides within, mountain demons and water curses appear. Forecasting darkness and gloom, observe the solar terms and the heavens. When formations face opposition, the Dark Warrior takes the lead. Next, the White Tiger—when the Robber Star drifts alongside. When the Ascending Light follows the Peasant Star, punishment and harm arrive first. Ceaseless rain in one breath, the activation follows the transmission. On the Nine Emperors’ taboo days, Heaven’s Dao is clear. If it meets the Black Dao, it will not rain but remain overcast. *Jia-wu* and *wu-wu*, *yi-you* and *ji-you*. *Ding-si* and *gui-si*, *ren-yin* and *xin-chou*. Dark mists do not shift—use this to determine misfortune.

In the divination of wind angles, the mysteries are worthy of transmission. The *Xun* Palace belongs to wood, and wood’s note is *jiao*. The star is called Heavenly Assistant, preceding the Hidden Gate. *Jia-wu* and *jia-chen*—the Wind God’s temple position. The Azure Dragon and White Tiger, the source of Feng Yi. They stir all things, issuing commands. Of the six emotions, *Xun* governs wind and mist.

When wind comes from *Zhen*, cold snow falls thickly. When *Xun* wind arrives, summer drought and winter cold bring discomfort. When wind comes from *Li*, the fifth month brings great plague. The following year, disaster strikes every village. When wind comes from *Kun*, water creatures kill things. Fish and salt double in price, and people also fall ill. When wind comes from *Dui*, warfare arises in mountains and marshes. People spread ominous rumors, and livelihoods collapse.

On the day of the Winter Solstice, Heaven’s Canopy governs it. When the *Guangmo* wind arrives, the state’s fortune is secure and flourishing. If opposed, the people scatter; in snow and cold, constancy prevails. Clear skies are inauspicious, and warfare stirs in the four directions. When wind comes from *Qian*, powerful states face worry. The year brings much cold, and rivers freeze. When wind comes from *Kan*, the year is abundant and the people rejoice. When wind comes from *Gen*, the first month brings much dew. When wind comes from *Zhen*, thunder does not sound. Heavy rains fall continuously, and plants and trees wither unseen. When wind comes from *Xun*, insects harm living things. When wind comes from above, nursing mothers perish. Winter is warm without frost, and water, drought, and epidemics follow. When wind comes from *Kun*, locusts harm the crops. Fields face much flooding, and rice surges in price. When wind comes from *Dui*, autumn rain brings warfare. The state’s fortune is unstable, and there is worry without joy.

**The Section on Ruler, Minister, Father, and Child**
The star of Heavenly Game Bird governs the laws of ruler and minister. Observing good and ill omens, the first day of the *Zhengyuan* begins. At the time of the Beginning of Spring, it aligns with that moment.

When it falls in the Qian direction, the Three Auspicious Stars serve as the Straight. Aligning with an auspicious gate above, the Nine Provinces become as one.

The Straight Talisman serves as the standard. When long illness recurs, the Celestial Unity flies through the palaces. When sudden minor ailments arise, the Celestial Unity lies hidden in the palace. When Snake and Tiger open the tally, the Stalwart Chief presses urgently. When it falls in the Li palace, the momentum of fortune and misfortune quickens. When the Death Gate approaches, alas, sorrowful wailing arises. When *jia* and *bing* interact, lifespan equals the Southern Culmen. When the Six *Jia* obtain the envoy, one proceeds joyfully.

When Transmitting Messenger and Heavenly Consort appear, ponds and embankments swell with water. When Celestial Void and Great Unity appear, the fire umbrella looms high. If *ding* and *gui* are added, grasses and trees wither yellow. When *bing* and *ding* are in position, winter lacks snow and frost. When *wu* and *ji* are in position, autumn brings severe frost. When *geng* and *xin* are in position, spring lacks rain and moisture. When *jia* and *yi* are in position, summer has little shade. When *ren* and *gui* meet the Tiger, people suffer from incurable illness. The inner stars of Heaven govern human ailments and taboos. On the seventh day of the New Year, it aligns with the Beginning of Spring. If Ascending Light is absent, autumn brings malaria and dysentery. When White Tiger and Victorious Light appear, the young suffer from consumption. When Dark Warrior and Celestial Stalwart appear, cold damage and strange fevers arise. When fire generals and fire deities appear, miasmic winds and epidemic qi spread. If they further enter the realm of severance, the dead fill the markets. When Great Unity and Celestial Yin appear, throat and eye afflictions arise. When Six Harmonies and Following Chief appear, madness and sudden illness erupt. When Heavenly Consort and Grand Thoroughfare appear, the city is filled with malevolent spirits. When Great Auspicious and Hook Star appear, mountain demons gather. When Small Auspicious and Azure Dragon appear, the Death Gate aligns. If the Six *Geng* are added, they oppose the Straight Talisman.

The earth trembles and mountains quake, the people starve and grow emaciated. The stars of Heavenly Assistance delve deep into the Dao and virtue. Should they wander to the *Qian* position, ruler and minister share profound joy. When they align with the *Kun* palace, treasures of pearls and jewels are bestowed. If the *Dui* palace presides, grain is prized while gold is cheap. When the *Xun* spirit takes its place, the myriad trees rejoice in glory. A hundred flowers vie in splendor, dancing through gardens and groves. Should they come to *Li* and *Zhen*, thunderclaps strike with terror. When *Gen* joins the two empresses, pregnant women grieve in sorrow. If *Kuigang* arrives in tandem, childbirth becomes fraught with peril. When the Noble One and White Tiger appear, *Chuansong* descends upon *Kan*. As the earth’s hidden treasures are revealed, gold and jade lie exposed. The stars of Heavenly Heart are the luminaries of sun and moon. When *Yi* and *Xin* meet *Qian* and *Gen*, the sun floats amid iridescent clouds. When *Bing* and *Geng* come to *Dui*, the moon gleams with radiant splendor. When *Ding* and *Gui* arrive at *Xun*, stars shimmer in the imperial court. When the Soaring Serpent and Great Unity appear, the moon’s hue turns golden. When Vermilion Bird and Great Auspicious appear, the sun’s light shines silver. When stars stream into the Dipper, the heavens open in *Kun*. When comets emerge, White Tiger resides in *Chen*. The great image of Heavenly Heart governs the myriad spirits. When Resting Gate convenes, gods and ghosts manifest their might. When Death Gate convenes, the spirits perish and lose reverence. When Wounding Gate convenes, gods and ghosts are but empty names. When Opening Gate convenes, sacrifices bring blessings. When Life Gate convenes, blessings are bestowed... When Obstructing Gate convenes, gods and ghosts conceal their forms. When Scenic Gate convenes, celestial officials make their rounds. The spirits dare not... When Startling Gate convenes, calamities befall the people. When *Kuigang* and Great Unity..., the Soaring Serpent..., ... When the Noble One and Heavenly Void appear, the might of the spirits goes unheard. When Vermilion Bird and *Chuansong* appear, the spirits’ voices are severed... When establishing temples and laying foundations, foreknow the rise and fall. When Heavenly Heart resides in *Qian*, offer half a thousand incense sticks. In the *Kun* palace, a hundred... If they come to the *Xun* position, demotion or exile follows swiftly. Beware the *Li* position, where the spirits’ mandate is not steadfast. In the *Kan* palace, sinking and drowning occur, and spirits and ghosts... Should they wander to *Gen*, a thousand years of continuity unfold. *Kun* does not endure long, nor does *Dui* remain firm. Though spirits and ghosts possess power, humans may yet prevail. I impart to you this method—bear it in mind. When spirits and ghosts harass people, gather stones in *Qian*. If the stone weighs a hundred *jin*, spirits and ghosts incur transgressions. If the stone weighs a thousand *jin*, the offense reaches the heavens. Bury the name below, and earth deities will appear. They will be bound to the nether darkness, never to return. The paths of humans and spirits diverge—this has been the eternal source. Spirits and deities, heed this: hasten to conceal yourselves.

The *Libao Juxuan* Section
The *Juxuan Yijing* states: When *Ren* is added to the fleeing formula, *Bing* is called the Luminous Realm, and *Geng* is named Venus.

When the Noble One is in governance, imperial favor and official emoluments follow. When Azure Dragon and Great Constancy appear, civil and military arts, medicine, and divination prosper.

When *Jia* is named Heavenly Fortune and *Bing* is named Heavenly Virtue, if the Day Fortune aligns with them, the myriad spirits are subdued... Beware the Day Breaker, Day Ghost, and Day Killer.

When the Moon Breaker and Moon Void appear, wine and feasting are abundant. When the Moon Punishment and Moon Killer appear, wealth and profit are not lost. When the Day Ghost and Day Horse appear, one rushes east and west. Even more feared is their presence at the gate—death and misfortune befall.

When the Victorious Serpent and Heavenly Void appear, human affairs flee and hide. When River Chariot and Six Harmonies appear, fire and candles are extinguished. When Great Yin and Heavenly Consort appear, great fame is achieved. When the Metal Spirit and Plundering Killer appear, authority is instead wielded. When they transmit together internally with *Chuansong*, illness renders speech difficult.

When the Six Rites strike punishment, Vermilion Bird and Hook Star appear. One seals their mouth and utters no words, yet invites many accusations. If one offends the Three Killers, they may pick up gold and silver. Should it coincide with Post Horse, the gate bustles with western neighbors. If further paired with Day Breaker, dogs bite travelers. When the Three Marvels enter the tomb, beware of *Dengming*. Documents reverse, and affairs are met with hesitation. When Heavenly Stem and River Chariot appear, darkness turns to light. If the Noble One is in governance, prison matters resolve smoothly. When White Tiger and Soaring Serpent appear, loss and mourning bring sorrow. Travelers come and go, affairs multiply like hemp. When Great Surge and Six Harmonies appear, travelers return home. When Great Unity and White Tiger appear, women turn lewd and wicked. When Merit Officer and Heavenly Consort appear, with Great Yin and *Congkui*, young monks visit the door, and Daoist priests offer tea. If *Congkui* meets the Noble One, or else Victorious Light, men suffer windstroke, not immediately falling into madness. Wind Earl and Rain Master bring ceaseless wind and rain. When *Bing* serves as Fire Star, the Direct Spirit is hard to suppress. When Post Horse and Great Unity appear, one encounters officials and is imprisoned.

When Vermilion Bird and Victorious Serpent appear, with Great Unity in the same place, the great are uplifted, and the petty admire. Three is the Land of Life—do not meet White Tiger. When Post Horse and *Congkui* appear, with Great Yin in attendance, life turns to death, fortune reverses to bitter misfortune. If one hears crows cawing, swiftly observe the Scenic Gate. The one before the Direct Spirit brings coercion and urgency. Evil men coerce and deceive, demanding money. The second ahead brings disputes, the third marriage. Otherwise, lawsuits and clamorous arguments fill the gate. The fourth ahead brings brawls, competing for wealth. The one behind the Direct Spirit involves women. The second behind brings fraud and deceit, with lewdness and adultery sprouting. The third behind brings loss, clothing and [text unclear] vanish. Further seek *Bing* of the Six—what spirit does it govern below? If River Chariot is below, county officials face alarm. Livestock die in disaster, failing to honor the gods.

**Section on Overcoming Enemies and Securing Victory**

The method for governing chaos hinges on observing the *Surprise Gate*.
When stars are auspicious and one gains concealment, one may roam ten thousand *li* unhindered.
When baleful comets form obstructions, [text missing].
One departs without the slightest merit, returns with enemies at hand.

When the *Three Marvels* achieve concealment, the entire army may be preserved.
If this resembles the White Tiger, [text missing].
When *Transmission* clashes with the day’s destruction, the commander cannot survive.
When the White Tiger rages wildly, compounded by the *Divine Consort*,
And the *Hook Star* shares its position, a great battle will be decided.

When the *Great Register* lies hidden and the *Mysterious Tiger* transmits,
To attack is certain defeat; to defend is certain punishment.
The configuration of the *Upright Talisman* resembles the *Great Unity*.
When the *Victorious Serpent* holds its position, fighting erupts on both flanks.

When metal enters fire, conflict immediately arises.
When fire enters metal, deceit and false sentiments prevail.
Though battle is joined, contention ceases—urgently heed the *Hook Star*.
Beneath this general, one must fear encountering the *Three Punishments*.
If today is overcome, conflict is certain.
When superiors and subordinates clash in difficulty, or when punishments coincide, war ensues.
If one wishes to avoid battle, the palace spirit must achieve harmony.
When the *Six Jia* gain their agent, with *Chou* and *Wei* added to *Chen*,
Or when both the day and hour resolve the clash, and the vital phase prevails, success is assured.

Another is the *Roaming Capital*, which coincidentally forms the *Six Harms*.
When the *Victorious Serpent* writhes and meets the *Six Gengs*,
The two sides clash, and blood flows rank.
When the *Hook Star* overcomes the *Mysterious [Tiger]*, one turns back to fall into the den.
If no punishments or obstructions exist, the attack will surely triumph.

The commander’s fate rests in speech; the noble relies on the *Hook*, *Dragon*, and *Tiger*.
When *Surprise* generates the *Open Gate*, success is within grasp.
When the *Hook Star* possesses *qi*, it cannot control its terrain.
If one encounters the *Nine Concealments*, the enemy harbors surrender.
Whether defeat arises or not, further inquire of the *Six Dings*.
When the *Three Marvels* enter the tomb, or the *Six Rituals* clash and strike,
And the year and fate coincide, the battle will surely end in peril.

When the *Injury Gate* meets the White Tiger, forming the *Flying and Hidden* configuration,
And the day’s cyclical signs are added, attacking the camp is inadvisable.
A comet signifies chaos; rewarding the army may be relied upon.
When the *Celestial Moon Virtue* spirit and the *Blue Dragon* align with the year’s fate,
And the *Open Gate* harmonizes with them, great merit is assured.

The method for selecting the hour: avoid offending the thunder.
When the *Thunder Duke* presides over the hour, the *Dragon* and *Tiger* are renowned.
At the first month’s solar term, begin with the *Open Gate*.
Proceed from the first day, and the *Zi* hour is treated the same.
The second month begins with *Rest*, the third with the *Life Gate*.
Proceed sequentially through the twelve, dividing them among the eight trigrams.
The month governs the day, the day governs the hour.
Count to the *Zhen* palace, where one collides with the *Barrier Punishment*.
The great general must guard against humiliation; men and horses will scarcely survive.
In summer, offending the White Tiger causes both armies to flee in death.
When the *Noble One* is in governance, carefully investigate treachery.
If one offends the *Blue Dragon*, [text missing].
If one speaks of encampment and defense, soldiers become lost souls.

When the *Hook Star* follows *From Chief*, one fights a hundred battles and wins a hundred [text missing].
[Text missing] *Divine Consort*, [text missing].
When *Heavenly Strength* and *River Chief* prevail, merit is achieved without battle.
Or when drums [text missing], [text missing].
[Text missing], [text missing].

When *Six Unions* and the *Blue Dragon* align, prostitutes rejoice.
When the *Hook Star* inflicts punishment [text missing], [text missing].
[Text missing], [text missing].
When *Great Yin* conducts sacrifices, the *Mysterious Warrior* inflicts harm.
Once the battle lines are set, from afar [text missing].
[Text missing], [text missing].

The *Seasonal Spirits* are treacherous and evil; the *Central Spirits* are merchants.
Where the *Initial Spirits* reside, talent and goodness must exist.
If one wields blades and clubs, [text missing].
Avoid *Hai*, *Zi*, and *Mao*; *Si* brings thieves and calamity.
*Yin*, *Shen*, *Chen*, and *Xu*—officials seek to hide.
*You*, *Wu*, *Chou*, and *Wei*—these [text missing].

To withdraw troops and evade the enemy, follow the direction of the *Upright Talisman*.
When it descends upon the *Four Initials*, concealment to the right is advisable.
For the *Central* and *Final* [months], conceal to the left, including the *Upright Talisman*’s direction.
Hide in the *Nine Earths*; the *Six Guis* are most favorable.
If one fears the enemy has set an ambush, the branches and stems must connect with the numinous.
Beneath the *Upright Envoy*, one may foresee the details in advance.

When *Zi* and *Mao* stand above, bandits harbor treacherous intent.
When *Shen* and *Si* stand above, an ambush must exist.
When the *Prosperous* and *Vital* phases bear punishments, a great battle is inevitable.
When *Emptiness* and *Decline* prevail, none dare engage in conflict.
Determine whether it lies ahead or behind, and divine by the *Upright Talisman*.
*Zi*, *Shen*, *Mao*, and *Si*—where they stand follows the sequence.
When the branch stands behind and the stem ahead,
Or when branch and stem overlap, one follows the path of the carriage.
Opposing sides suffer hunger and thirst, lacking water and seeking drink.
Beneath the *Rest Gate*, the divine generals are most favorable.
If one sees *Great Collision*, a pond lies behind.
If it is *Small Fortune*, wells and springs abound.
If it is *Shen* or *You*, the river flows vast.
Urgently seek provisions; relief will be nowhere found.

Beneath the *Life Gate*, *Great Fortune* provides grain.
*Small Fortune* yields wine; *Great Collision* yields cattle and sheep.
From where should one proceed? Consult the *Celestial Pivot*.
This is the great road, directly penetrating the barrier and bridge.
In hasty use, it is difficult to examine in detail.
I offer you one method: do not ponder it.
When the palace spirit harmonizes with virtue, advancing plans is permissible.
When the *Three Marvels* achieve concealment, all matters succeed.
When the *Six Jia* gain their agent, the noble prospers.
When the *Blue Dragon* turns its head, auspicious affairs arrive.
When the *Flying Bird* falls into the den, joyful tidings approach.
