### **Chapter One: The Primordial Separation of Heaven and Earth**
The Dao speaks:
Before heaven and earth divided, there existed the Supreme Ultimate (Taiji) and Primordial Simplicity (Taisu), establishing the name of the Originating Beginning. Only then were the positions of yin and yang fixed—yang, light and pure, became heaven; yin, heavy and turbid, became earth. Yang ascended and rounded; yin descended and squared.

At first, within the chaos, transformations unfolded in the vast primordial (hongmeng). The three yangs converged, the six qi intermingled, giving form to the myriad things in the midst of the indistinct, birthing the thousand spirits beyond being and non-being. Some gestated in wombs, some hatched from eggs, some emerged from moisture—all manifestations of the heavens above, all nurturing streams upon the fertile earth. Such is the work of creation.

Once heaven and earth were sundered, the harmonious qi took effect: yang essence coalesced into the radiant sun, yin essence solidified into the luminous moon. The four directions and eight extremities spread forth, wind and rain bestowed moisture, the four seasons followed their course, snow and frost transformed things, renewing the old and altering the fleeting. Thus, through transformation, humans came to be—some male, some female—all born in accord with heaven and earth.

Man is yang, aligned with the Dao of heaven; woman is yin, aligned with the Dao of earth. Above, heaven’s yang is clear and light, corresponding to man below; earth’s yin is heavy and turbid, corresponding to woman. Heaven and earth take the sun and moon as their essence; man and woman treasure essence and blood. All emulate the function of heaven and earth, and must endure as heaven and earth endure. The Dao of long life and enduring vision operates in unity with the yin and yang of heaven and earth.

### **Chapter Two: The Resonance of Human Spirit**
The Dao speaks:
Humans are the transformation of the qi of heaven and earth. The spirit is the function of the qi of yin and yang; the form is the dwelling of the spirit and qi. The yin and yang souls (hun and po) are the spirits of essence and blood—these two spirits are the chiefs of the ten thousand spirits.

Thus, those who cultivate and nourish themselves—if they can preserve the spirit and nurture qi, secure the blood and refine essence—may fully grasp the principle of long life. If the human body suffers illness, the form is incomplete; if the form is incomplete, qi cannot abide; if qi cannot abide, the spirit is unsettled, and life is not long. To prolong life, one must nurture the dwelling of the form, secure essence and blood, refine the spirit and stabilize the souls—only then can long life be attained.

### **Chapter Three: The Creation of the Myriad Things**
The Dao speaks:
As heaven and earth rise and descend, the harmonious qi takes form, and the myriad things experience flourishing and decay. All contain the one qi, enabling transformation—whether metal, stone, grass, or wood; birds, beasts, fish, or insects—all are the creations of heaven and earth.

Among the myriad things, humans are the most noble, the chief of all beings. The head is round, the feet are square—above, yang; below, yin—all in accord with heaven and earth. Just as heaven has wind and rain, humans have blood and qi; as heaven has sun and moon, humans have eyes; as heaven has the ten thousand images, humans have the ten thousand spirits; as heaven has the eight extremities, humans have the eight vessels; as heaven has the five phases, humans have the five viscera; as heaven has the four seasons, humans have the four limbs.

Earth has mountains and peaks, humans have bones and joints; earth has grasses and trees, humans have hair; earth has rivers and lakes, humans have blood vessels. There is nothing that does not correspond to heaven and earth—humans are the chief of the myriad things.

If humans do not receive heaven above and connect with earth below, embracing yin and carrying yang, how could they alone, within heaven and earth, move in harmony with creation? Heaven can move, earth can be still; yang can create, yin can transform. Thus, heaven descends and earth ascends, their intersection giving birth to the myriad things. If humans descend above and ascend below, the myriad things become numinous—this is responding to heaven to generate the myriad things, and responding to humans to generate the ten thousand spirits.

Heaven operates through yin and yang; humans operate through spirit and qi. By refining qi to congeal the spirit, spirit and qi unite, and with the form complete, long life is assured.

### **Chapter Four: The Mutual Encircling of Yin and Yang**
The Dao speaks:
Heaven descends yang qi to earth; earth ascends yin qi to heaven. Heaven exchanges yin essence with the sun; man emits yin qi within yang’s yin—this is called *true lead*. Woman emits yang qi within yin’s yang—this is called *true mercury*.

Thus, when heaven and earth unite, the myriad things are born; when sun and moon unite, the thousand spirits transform. Yin and yang embrace, outer and inner complete each other; south and north converge, above and below correspond; east and west pair, left and right unite, inner and outer harmonize, spirit and qi intermingle. Through this, yin attains yang and becomes numinous; yang attains yin and becomes sagely. Humans receive qi and live; spirits receive form and become whole. Those who cultivate this will surely attain long life.

### **Chapter Five: The Transformations of the Five Phases**
The Dao speaks:
The five phases (wuxing) are: in heaven, the five phases; on earth, the five peaks; in the world, the five constants; in humans, the five viscera.

The transformations of the five phases: metal and wood mutually generate and overcome; water and fire pair and unite—only earth can transform. The myriad things, receiving it, may be perfected; the single body, receiving it, may become numinous. Circulating qi through the three fields (santian) can produce the great medicine of the five phases.

The golden elixir (jindan) is the transformation of the qi of the five phases; the five fluids are the ascent and descent of the five phases; the qi of heaven is the function of the five phases. Heaven and earth are the ancestors of the five phases; sun and moon are their lineage; the celestial circuit (zhoutian) is their Dao; the eight trigrams are their gateways; the great medicine is the five phases—all reside in the human body’s function.

Thus, the *Scripture of the Unseen Talisman* states: "Heaven has five thieves—those who perceive them prosper; those who do not perish."

If one cultivates the functioning of the five phases according to the method and maintains the practice, one may surely attain longevity.

**Chapter Six: The Formation of Images in the Eight Trigrams**
The Dao states: Heaven employs the eight trigrams to correspond to the eight directions.
Fu Xi drew the eight trigrams, designating the northwest as *Qian* (☰), associated with metal and the image of three yang lines.
The southwest is *Kun* (☷), associated with earth and the image of three yin lines.
When three yang lines descend to generate one yin, *Xun* (☴) is formed, located in the southeast and associated with wind.
When three yin lines descend to generate one yang, *Zhen* (☳) is formed, associated with thunder and located due east.
When three yang lines ascend to generate one yin, *Dui* (☱) is formed, associated with marsh and located due west.
When three yin lines ascend to generate one yang, *Gen* (☶) is formed, associated with mountain and located northeast.
When one yin arises amid three yang lines, *Li* (☲) is formed, associated with fire and located due south.
When one yang arises amid three yin lines, *Kan* (☵) is formed, associated with water and located due north.
Once the eight trigrams form their images, each is aligned with a direction and may correspond to the five viscera of humans:
*Qian* (heaven) corresponds to the large intestine; *Kan* to the kidneys; *Gen* to the bladder; *Zhen* to the liver; *Xun* to the gallbladder; *Li* to the heart; *Kun* to the abdomen; and *Dui* to the lungs.
These eight gates each possess a method of qi. If cultivated, qi flows through the five viscera and six bowels, uniting with the spirit-qi, thereby extending life.

**Chapter Seven: The Differentiation of Male and Female Forms**
The Dao states: The male is the infant, and the differentiated form is true lead.
The female is the maiden, and the differentiated form is true mercury.
The male is born in the north and flourishes in the *Kan* palace;
The female is born in the south and flourishes in the *Li* palace.
If male and female unite in the central palace, the yellow sprout arises within. Once the yellow sprout emerges, it disperses through the twelve meridians, branching into the hundred vessels. Above, it reaches the palace of the muddy pellet (niwan); below, it descends to the sea of essence-qi; in the center, it traverses the gate of the bright hall (mingtang), filling the three fields with qi and rendering the chamber of spirit luminous.
Originally one male and one female, they differentiate into a thousand and ten thousand spirits.
Thus, lead and mercury form the body; *Kan* and *Li* are their names; the golden elixir is their essence; dragon and tiger are their forms.
All arise from the transformation of a single qi into numinous power. When merit and practice are complete, one may surely attain longevity.

**Chapter Eight: The Golden Elixir Refines the Form**
The Dao states: Gold occupies the position of Venus, the qi of the west. It emerges from the designation of primordial simplicity, thus embodying the image of the Great One.
Cinnabar occupies the position of the Great Ultimate, the qi of the south. It emerges from the position of the Great Mystery, likewise embodying the image of the Great One.
Gold generates water, thus treasure is seen within water; wood generates fire, thus the true is formed within fire.
Therefore, gold emerges from water, and fire is seen within water, whereupon the elixir is refined—this is called white cinnabar.
If earth is obtained, the yellow sprout grows of itself, the jade flower blooms fragrantly, the jasper tree reaches the heavens, the winter forest rises from the earth, the golden fluid bathes the crown, the silver waves surge through the passes, wind and clouds converge, and the spirit-soul flourishes—all through the Dao of refining the form with the golden elixir.
Yet water and fire are difficult to unite, metal and water are difficult to harmonize, the great medicine is difficult to encounter, and the true principle is difficult to meet. Countless practitioners often fall into perdition.
If one seeks to attain the true, one must master the Dao of the golden elixir—only then may one attain longevity.

**Chapter Nine: The Sage-Embryo Attains the True**
The Dao states: The sage is the numinous and sacred; the embryo is the transformation of qi; the true is the original nature.
Thus, humans form the true qi through their original nature, thereby completing the embryo. When the primordial qi transforms, it becomes the true spirit.
Once the spirit is numinous, one may enter sagehood.
The sage ascends to the highest heavens, descends to the deepest earth, spans the four directions—south before, north behind, east left, west right—pervading the six directions without obstruction, circulating throughout the world. This is called divine penetration.
Such freedom arises from refining qi and cultivating the true to form the sage-embryo.
If one is deluded and awakens not, practices the false and neglects the true, seeks a short life rather than a long one, and perceives the deviant rather than the upright, one will never complete the sage-embryo.
To form the sage-embryo, one must focus on the body and life, employing the method of refining qi to generate spirit—only then may one attain longevity.

**Chapter Ten: Ascension and Feather Transformation**
The Dao states: Flight begins with the gate of quiescent cultivation, the principle of wondrous application, the refinement of the true primordial qi, the sincerity of non-action, the uprightness of the light and pure Dao—becoming a guest of feather transformation.
To fly is like clouds drifting across the world, unbound by ten thousand miles;
To ascend is to rise from below, like qi soaring into the empty sky, drifting without dispersion.
At this stage, the body becomes a companion of the immortals, dwelling on Mount Penglai as a guest of the jade grottoes, a visitor at the golden gates. One attains boundless longevity, dons the six-zhu robe, rides the five-colored clouds, and traverses the ten isles.
One may drive a dragon chariot or a jeweled carriage, wander jade grottoes and golden terraces, where flowers bloom unfading through the four seasons and the music of immortality resounds for ten thousand days.
One may enjoy measured splendor and boundless wealth.
How is this attained? Through human cultivation.
One draws near to heaven and distances oneself from hell.
Those who do not cultivate or practice, who lack the Dao and virtue, will draw near to hell and distance themselves from heaven.
Now, the affairs of the heavenly palace are scarcely one part in ten thousand.
But the regions of hell are briefly described: there is a city called Dengduoluo, where King Yama, also called the Northern Emperor of the Dark Capital, resides. He governs the eight grottoes of yin spirits within the eighteen iron cities, where life and death are determined.
In the various hells, flames blaze above, and vast ice stretches below; to the left stand mountains of a thousand rods, to the right forests of sword trees. Enduring ceaseless suffering, I dare not speak further, lest hearing it grieve your heart. Only then will you know that cultivating the Dao is the greatest good—only thus may one ascend and undergo feather transformation, becoming a celestial immortal.

Should one fail to cultivate merit and accumulate virtuous deeds, they shall sink into hell—when will they ever emerge? Today, by fortunate encounter with my transformative teaching, I transmit the scriptures and the Dao, bestowing upon you the method and the elixir. If your will is steadfast and your heart resolute, you may surely prolong your life.

**Chapter Eleven: On the Method of the True One**
The Dao speaks: The method of the True One is the yin of heaven and earth, the qi of the myriad things, the nature of humanity, the foundation of the Dao, the root of virtue, the ancestor of the body, the origin of life, the essence of the dragon, the form of the tiger, the name of essence, the source of blood, the head of lead, the crown of mercury. When it meets the hun-soul, it becomes three; when it encounters the po-soul, it becomes seven. This is the source of the True One. Though you may know the name of cultivating the true, what is the method of cultivating the true?
The master answers: Simply refine the qi of the cinnabar field within the body to strengthen it, and generate the natural spirit in its completeness. Within the twelve hours, guard the celestial true qi as it enters the palace of the cinnabar field. Let the heart be free of chaotic thoughts, the exterior free of distractions—neither issuing forth nor entering, neither coming nor going. The spirit settles and finds peace of its own accord. This is the method of the True One.

**Chapter Twelve: On the Method of the Union of the Two Qi**
The Dao speaks: The function of the ascending and descending yin and yang qi of high and low—above, it surges into the vast emptiness; below, it traverses the profound darkness. Wind and water, springs and clouds, mists—all are the workings of the yin and yang qi. Even the human body is transformed by yin and yang. Though one may cultivate and refine, it is still the transformation of human yin and yang qi. What, then, is the method of cultivating and refining my qi?
Listen to this one method: Above the central pipe within the human body lies the celestial qi, bestowed upon yang; below the central pipe lies the earthly qi, bestowed upon yin. If one guides the upper and lower yin and yang qi to converge in the central palace, one may surely form the sacred embryo. Once the golden elixir is congealed, transformation occurs naturally. One qi can transform into ten, ten into a hundred; one return can transform into a thousand, a second return into ten thousand, a third return into thirty-six thousand spirits in their completeness. Thus, know that those who do not cultivate gain no merit; without merit, they do not succeed; without success, they are not complete. Failing completion, they do not ascend as immortals, and the body must perish. But if the heart’s resolve is firm, success is achieved; with success, the spirit is complete. How can this not be trusted? Follow my method, and you shall surely prolong your years.

**Chapter Thirteen: On the Method of the Three Origins, Upper and Lower**
The Dao speaks: Heaven, earth, and humanity are the origins of the Three Powers. Essence, qi, and spirit are the numinous Three Origins, the function of the upper, middle, and lower palaces. The three cinnabar fields are the means by which the spirit is generated. How may the three fields be filled and the ten thousand spirits made numinous?
Listen to this one method: If the heart is not chaotic, the nature is naturally numinous; if thoughts do not stir, the spirit is naturally complete; if qi is not turbid, the body is naturally light; if essence does not scatter, the Dao is naturally pure; if merit is not interrupted, one ascends of one’s own accord. I teach you: Treasure the Three Origins, pay homage to the Jade Capital. With a steadfast heart, you may attain longevity.

**Chapter Fourteen: On the Sequence of the Four Proper Responses**
The Dao speaks: The Four Proper are the seasons; the sequence is the response to the commands of spring, summer, autumn, and winter. Spring governs birth, summer governs growth, autumn governs fruition, winter governs storage. What is the method of cultivating the Four Proper in human practice?
Listen to this one method: In spring, cultivate the qi of the liver and gallbladder, corresponding to the positions of wood, jia and yi. In summer, cultivate the qi of the heart, corresponding to the positions of fire, bing and ding. In autumn, cultivate the qi of the lungs, corresponding to the positions of metal, geng and xin. In winter, cultivate the qi of the kidneys, corresponding to the positions of water, ren and gui. Thus, water and fire turn toward one another, metal and wood intermingle; the central palace converges them, and the four phases and five agents all achieve transformation. After one thousand days, the lesser merit is accomplished, and the golden elixir congeals. After two thousand days, the central palace is perfected, and the sacred embryo becomes numinous. After three thousand days, the great merit is complete, and the mortal bones transform. The bones transform, the earthly name vanishes, the celestial surname is inscribed, the body undergoes feather transformation, and one returns to Penglai. If you cultivate with a steadfast heart according to my teachings, how could you not prolong your years and attain long life?

**Chapter Fifteen: On the Method of the Five Agents Matching the Viscera**
The Dao speaks: Heaven, with the yang qi of the five agents, corresponds to the human viscera; earth, with the yin qi of the five agents, corresponds to the human bowels. Metal, wood, water, fire, and earth transmit to the heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys, corresponding to bing, shen, wu, geng, and ren. These correspond to the transformations of yin and yang qi. It is also said that the large intestine, small intestine, stomach, and bladder correspond to yi, ding, ji, xin, and gui. Above lies the triple burner, below the Gate of Life—all are the pairings of yin and yang. What is the method of their application?
The answer: Transmit the qi of the True One into the five viscera to assist their essence and blood, augment their hun and po souls, and generate spirit and qi—thus may life be prolonged!

**Chapter Sixteen: On the Method of the Six Lines Harmonizing with the Six Qi**
The Dao speaks: The six lines are the three yin and three yang. The first is lesser yang, the second is yang brightness, the third is greater yang. The first is reverting yin, the second is lesser yin, the third is greater yin—these are the six lines harmonizing with the six qi. What is the function of the six lines?
The answer: Spring, summer, autumn, and winter each have ninety days; a year has three hundred and sixty days, with sixty days as one qi. Thus, the six lines complete one cycle. The movement follows the qi’s turning, the qi follows the movement’s progression. If you grasp this principle, even within a single day, there are six qi. Yin and mao are the first qi, corresponding to lesser yang; chen and si are the second qi, corresponding to yang brightness; wu and wei are the third qi, corresponding to greater yang; shen and you are the fourth qi, corresponding to reverting yin; xu and hai are the fifth qi, corresponding to lesser yin; zi and chou are the sixth qi, corresponding to greater yin. It is also said that within the human viscera and bowels, yang moves on the left, yin on the right.

The six divisions of blood and vessels follow the movement of qi, circulating once through the body each day, traversing the six qi in sequence. If one can master this circulation, longevity is assured.

**Chapter Seventeen: On the Method of the Sevenfold Return and Reverted Elixir**
The Dao states: The sevenfold return corresponds to the pivot of Heaven and Earth, operating within the twelve palaces. In the twelve hours of day and night, from midnight (zi) to noon (wu), the intestines return to yin. As for its application in human cultivation—how is it practiced? Simply guide the original true qi from below to return upward, which is called "yin returning to yang"; then direct the true original qi from above to return downward, which is called "yang returning to yin." The six yin and six yang converge at the Yellow Court, returning to the Cinnabar Field, where spirit and qi are both fulfilled—this is the reverted elixir. Heaven descends through yang, Earth ascends through yin, and humans harmonize through qi; all creation follows this principle. The *Book of Changes* says: "In seven days, the return comes." Thus, one must achieve the sevenfold return. By reverting the true unity of qi in accordance with the times, longevity is assured.

**Chapter Eighteen: The Golden Liquid and Reverted Elixir**
The Dao states: The Way of refining form through golden liquid is the gateway to cultivation and immortality since ancient times, the root of embryonic breathing. Spirit and qi are the pivot; they are the ancestral origin of water and fire. To refine form and spirit, first refine the heart. When the heart is open, wisdom arises; when wisdom arises, the method becomes clear; when the method is clear, merit is accomplished; when merit is accomplished, one becomes a spirit-immortal, shedding mortal bones to attain transcendence. Without this, how could one succeed? If one refines the golden liquid to transform the bodily dwelling, longevity is assured.

**Chapter Nineteen: On the Method of Golden Elixir, Embryonic Transformation, and Transcendence**
The Dao states: The golden elixir is perfected after nine years. Embryonic transformation of the spirit is the process of the mortal becoming sacred. Just as coarse stone nurtures jade within and the oyster nurtures a pearl in its womb, mortal flesh nurtures the sacred embryo. Within the false lies the true; within the numinous lies treasure; within the shallow lies depth; within the noble lies the immortal. One becomes good by drawing near to goodness, evil by drawing near to evil, wise by drawing near to the wise, and foolish by drawing near to the foolish. Yet if one neither draws near to the wise nor the foolish, the Great Dao ensures long life.
