**Volume One of the *Yellow Emperor’s Eighty-One Difficulties* Compiled and Annotated by Lu Guo and Qin Yue Ren, with Commentary by Li Xi and Fan Zi from Linchuan**

**Chapter 1: The *Pulse Ox’s* Diagnostic Observations**
**Difficulty 1:** The first verse expounds upon the difficulty and inquires: All twelve meridians possess the **Pulse Ox** (*Tunxi*). The term *jing* (經) means pathway, constancy—the constant pathways through which **meridian-qi** flows. The three **Yin** and three **Yang** meridians of the hand, and the three **Yin** and three **Yang** meridians of the foot:

- The **Heart**, the hand **Lesser Yin** meridian;
- The **Small Intestine**, the hand **Greater Yang** meridian;
- The **Liver**, the foot **Jue Yin** meridian;
- The **Gallbladder**, the foot **Lesser Yang** meridian;
- The **Kidneys**, the foot **Lesser Yin** meridian;
- The **Bladder**, the foot **Greater Yang** meridian;
- The **Lungs**, the hand **Greater Yin** meridian;
- The **Large Intestine**, the hand **Yangming** meridian;
- The **Spleen**, the foot **Greater Yin** meridian;
- The **Stomach**, the foot **Yangming** meridian;
- The **Pericardium**, the hand **Jue Yin** meridian;
- The **Triple Burner**, the hand **Lesser Yang** meridian.

Among the twelve meridians above, all possess the **Pulse Ox** (*Tunxi*) with manifest movement. Yet only the **Cun Kou** (寸口) is taken to determine the laws of life, death, auspice, and inauspice for the five **Zang** (藏) and six **Fu** (府). What does this mean?

At a distance of one *cun* (寸) from the **Yu Ji** (魚際) bone, it is named **Cun Kou** (寸口). The **Liver**, **Heart**, **Spleen**, **Lungs**, and **Kidneys** are the five **Zang** (藏); the **Gallbladder**, **Stomach**, **Large Intestine**, **Small Intestine**, **Bladder**, and **Triple Burner** are the six **Fu** (府). Yet only the **Cun Kou** (寸口) of one meridian is used to judge whether the central **Zang** (藏) and **Fu** (府) are in life or death, auspice or inauspice. How is this explained?

The **Cun Kou** (寸口) is the grand confluence of the meridians, where the **hand Greater Yin** meridian pulses. This refers specifically to the **Cun Kou** (寸口) of the right hand, the **hand Greater Yin** meridian, which converges at **Da Yuan** (大渊). **Da Yuan** (大渊) is the name of an acupoint, a critical junction where the twelve meridians meet. It is the place where the **hand Greater Yin** meridian’s **Pulse Ox** (*Tunxi*) manifests.

When a person exhales, the **Pulse Ox** (*Tunxi*) travels three *cun* (寸). Exhalation corresponds to **Yang** emergence; between one exhalation, the **Greater Yang**, **Lesser Yang**, and **Yangming** meridians advance, totaling three *cun*. When a person inhales, the **Pulse Ox** (*Tunxi*) travels three *cun*. Inhalation follows **Yin** entry; between one inhalation, the **Greater Yin**, **Lesser Yin**, and **Jue Yin** meridians advance, totaling three *cun*. With exhalation and inhalation settled, the **Pulse Ox** (*Tunxi*) travels six *cun*. The rise and fall of **Heaven** and **Earth**’s **Yin** and **Yang**, like the waxing and waning of the sun and moon, are thus determined. The **Pulse Ox** (*Tunxi*) travels twenty-five *cun* during exhalation and twenty-five *cun* during inhalation, completing fifty degrees in one cycle around the body. The **Cun Kou** (寸口) is the starting and ending point of the five **Zang** (藏) and six **Fu** (府), hence the law is taken from the **Cun Kou** (寸口).

The **Cun Kou** (寸口) begins at the right hand’s **Lung** meridian. From the **Lungs** and **Large Intestine**, it proceeds to the **Stomach** and **Spleen**; from the **Spleen**, it moves to the **Heart** and **Small Intestine**; from the **Small Intestine**, it advances to the **Bladder** and **Kidneys**; from the **Kidneys**, it travels to the **Pericardium** and **Triple Burner**; and from the **Triple Burner**, it returns to the **Gallbladder** and **Liver**, where the cycle ends—and then begins anew at the **Lungs**. The **Nutritive Qi** (*Honor-Wei*) and **Defensive Qi** (*Wei*) circulate twenty-five degrees along **Yang** and twenty-five degrees along **Yin**, completing one cycle. **Nutritive Qi** (*Honor-Wei*) belongs to **blood** and **Yin**, circulating within the meridians; **Defensive Qi** (*Wei*) belongs to **qi** and **Yang**, circulating outside the meridians. The **qi** and **blood** are awake while traversing the body and rest within the **Zang** (藏), ceaselessly cycling day and night without pause. In two hundred seventy breaths, the **Pulse Ox** (*Tunxi*) travels sixteen *zhang* two *chi* (丈二尺), corresponding to two *ke* (刻) of the **water clock** (*Lou Shu*). In thirteen thousand five hundred breaths, the **Pulse Ox** (*Tunxi*) travels eight hundred ten *zhang* (丈), corresponding to one hundred *ke* (刻) of the **water clock** (*Lou Shu*). Twenty-five degrees of **Yang** and twenty-five degrees of **Yin** make up the measure of the **water clock** (*Lou Shu*). One cycle corresponds to one full day and night. Thus, fifty cycles converge again at the **hand Greater Yin** meridian.

Thus, the diagnostic method of **pulse examination** relies on the **Cun Kou** (寸口), by which one discerns life and death, fortune and misfortune.

**Second Difficulty:** The second inquiry elaborates and asks: What are the **Cun** and **Chi** (尺寸) of the pulse?

The pulse has a **Chi** (尺) section and a **Cun** (寸) section—how does this distinction arise?

Indeed, the **Cun** and **Chi** are the pulse’s great confluence. The **Cun** belongs to the **Yang** region, marking the convergence of **Yang**’s essence; the **Chi** belongs to the **Yin** region, marking the convergence of **Yin**’s essence. This is where the **Pulse Ox** (*Tunxi*) gathers most profoundly.

From the **Guan** (关) to the **Chi** is the **Chi** region, governed by **Yin**; from the **Guan** to the **Yu Ji** (鱼际) is the **Cun Kou** region, governed by **Yang**. The **Guan** is the pass between **Yin** and **Yang**—before the **Guan** is **Yang**, after the **Guan** is **Yin**.

From the **Guan** to the **Chi Ze** (尺泽) acupoint, spanning one **Chi**, lies within the **Chi** region, governed by **Yin**. Though the **Chi** region’s pulse appears only one **Cun** long, it is called **Chi** because it is the root.

From the **Guan** to the **Yu Ji** bone is the **Cun** region, governed by **Yang**. The **Cun Kou** measures one **Cun**, yet the **Pulse Ox** manifests nine **Fen** (分).

Thus, **Chi** is divided into **Cun**, and **Cun** is divided into **Fen**. By cross-referencing **Chi** and **Cun**, one discerns the **Cun Kou** and **Chi** regions. Hence, **Yin** occupies one **Cun** within the **Chi** region, while **Yang** occupies nine **Fen** within the **Cun** region.

**Yin** is paired (even), Earth’s number is ten, so **Yin** occupies one **Cun** within the **Chi** region. **Yang** is odd, Heaven’s number is nine, so **Yang** occupies nine **Fen** within the **Cun** region.

Thus, the **Chi** and **Cun** mark the beginning and end—one **Cun** and nine **Fen**—hence the term **Chi Cun** (尺寸).

**Yang qi** originates in the **Chi** and moves to the **Cun**; **Yin qi** originates in the **Cun** and moves to the **Chi**. Therefore, the law states that **Yang qi** first arises at **Lì Chun** (立春), ascending to the **Mang Zhong** (芒种) node—its count is nine, with the Three **Yangs** reigning ahead, corresponding to the nine **Fen** within the **Cun** as floating.

At the **Xia Zhi** (夏至) node, its **qi** descends, reaching **Lì Dong** (立冬) to conclude—its count is ten, with the Three **Yins** reigning behind, corresponding to one **Cun** within the **Chi** as deep.

This is the **Yin** within **Yang**’s beginning and end.

**Yin qi** again arises from **Lì Qiū** (立秋), descending to the **Dong Zhi** (冬至) node—its count is ten. After **Dong Zhi**, it follows the **Shao Yang** upward, reaching the **Lì Xia** (立夏) node—its count is nine.

This is the **Yang** within **Yin**’s beginning and end.

The **Chi** and **Cun** each mark their own beginning and end—one **Cun** and nine **Fen**—hence the term **Chi Cun**.

**Third Difficulty:** [Same as before.]

The pulse has **excess** (太過). The pulse beats in **excess** at their designated positions. There is **deficiency**. There is **deficiency** at their designated positions. There is **Yin-Yang counteraction**. There is **Yin-qi counteracting the Yang pulse**, and there is **Yang pulse counteracting the Yin position**.

There is **covering** (覆). The **covering pulse** travels from the *Guan* (關) to the *Chi Ze* (尺澤). There is **overflow** (溢). The **overflowing pulse** swells at the *Cun Kou* (寸口), extending upward to the *Yu Ji* (魚際) bone.

There is **closure** (關) and **repulsion** (格). *Guan* means **closure**; *ge* means **repulsion**. When **Yin-qi is excessive**, **Yang-qi cannot circulate**, hence it is called **closure** (鬲). When **Yang-qi is excessive**, **Yin-qi cannot circulate**, hence it is called **closure** (關). When both **Yin and Yang are excessive**, neither can circulate properly, hence it is called **closure and repulsion** (關鬲). What does this mean? How is this explained?

Before the *Guan* (關), it is the movement of **Yang**. **Yang-qi** originates at the *Chi* (尺) and moves to the *Cun* (寸). The region before the *Guan* is called *Cun Kou* (寸口), where **Yang-qi** moves and acts. The pulse should be **nine *fen* (分) and floating**. Since **Yang** is an odd number, its count is nine, and the **Yang pulse is floating**, hence the *Cun Kou* pulse is **nine *fen* and floating**.

If it **exceeds**, it is called **excess** (太過). If it exceeds nine *fen*, it extends to **one *cun* (寸)**. The *Cun* pulse is originally floating, and if it becomes additionally **full and large**, it is an **excess pulse**. If it **lacks**, it is called **deficiency** (不及). If it does not reach nine *fen*, it may be **eight, seven, or six *fen***. The *Cun* pulse is originally floating; if pressed lightly, it diminishes and becomes small, which is **deficiency**. If it overflows upward to *Yu Ji* (魚際), it is called **overflow** (溢). The pulse swells at *Yu Ji* bone, **floating and large**, which is **Yang overflow**. If it is floating yet diminished and small, it is **Yang deficiency**. When **Yang is deficient**, **Yin invades and counteracts**, resulting in **Yin overflow**. This is called **external closure and internal repulsion** (外關內格). **External closure** means the internal pulse cannot emerge, which is **deficiency**, also called **Yin counteracting the pulse**. **Internal repulsion** means the external pulse cannot enter, which is **excess**, also called **overflowing pulse**. This is the pulse of **Yin counteraction**, the pulse where **Yin-qi counteracts the Yang position**.

After the *Guan* (關), it is the movement of **Yin**. **Yin-qi** originates at the *Cun* (寸) and moves to the *Chi* (尺). The region after the *Guan* is the *Chi* (尺) position, where **Yin-qi** moves and acts. The pulse should be **one *cun* and deep**. Since **Yin** is an even number, its count is ten, and the **Yin pulse is deep**, hence the *Chi* pulse is **one *cun* and deep**.

If it **exceeds**, it is called **excess** (太過). If it exceeds one *cun*, it may extend to **one and two, three, four, or five *fen***. The *Chi* pulse is originally deep; if pressed heavily, it becomes additionally **full and large**, which is **Yin excess**. If it **lacks**, it is called **deficiency** (不及). If it does not reach one *cun*, it may be **eight, seven, or six *fen***. The *Yin* pulse is originally deep and **soft**; if pressed heavily, it diminishes and becomes small, which is **Yin deficiency**. If it descends into the *Chi* as **covering** (覆), the **covering pulse** travels from the *Guan* to the *Chi Ze* (尺澤) acupoint. If the pulse is seen at one *cun*, it is **hidden and not visible**; when pressed deeply, it diminishes and becomes small, which is **Yin deficiency**. When **Yin is deficient**, **Yang invades and counteracts**, called **Yang covering** (陽覆), also **internal closure and external repulsion** (內關外格). **Internal closure** means the external pulse cannot enter, which is **Yin deficiency**, and **Yang invades and counteracts**. **External repulsion** means the internal pulse cannot emerge, which is **Yin excess**, also called **Yang covering**. This is the pulse of **Yang counteraction**, the pulse where **Yang-qi counteracts the Yin position**. Hence it is called **covering and overflow** (覆溢). When all **Yin is insufficient**, **Yang invades and counteracts**, resulting in **covering**. When all **Yang is insufficient**, **Yin invades and counteracts**, resulting in **overflow**. These are the **true藏 pulses**; if seen alone in their original form, they indicate **imminent death**. If seen in **partial Yin or partial Yang**, it also indicates **death**.

**Fourth Difficulty:** What is the **Yin-Yang law of the pulse**? The pulse has **Yin and Yang**; what are their regulations?

When exhaling, the **Heart and Lungs** are engaged. The **Heart and Lungs** are above the *Ge* (鬲), the **Yang** within the **Zang** (藏). Exhalation follows **Yang**, so the exhaled breath emerges from the **Heart and Lungs**. When inhaling, the **Kidneys and Liver** are engaged. The **Liver and Kidneys** are below the *Ge* (鬲), the **Yin** within the **Zang** (藏). Inhalation follows **Yin**, so the inhaled breath enters the **Kidneys and Liver**. Between exhalation and inhalation, the **Spleen** receives the flavors of grains. The pulse lies in the middle. The **Spleen** is the central state; above it are the **Heart and Lungs**, below it are the **Kidneys and Liver**, so the pulse between exhalation and inhalation belongs to the **Spleen**. The **Spleen and Stomach** are the **granaries and storehouses**, responsible for receiving the **Five Grains**. *Gu* (谷) means **grain**; *ku* (空) means **empty**. The **Spleen** receives the flavors of grains as the foundation for exhalation and inhalation.

The **floating pulse** is **Yang**. The floating pulse travels between the **skin and blood vessels**, above the **muscles**, which is the **Yang pulse**. The **deep pulse** is **Yin**. The deep pulse travels along the **tendons and beside the bones**, which is the **Yin pulse**. Hence it is called **Yin and Yang**. In summary, the pulse is **floating as Yang and deep as Yin**.

How do we distinguish between the **Heart and Lungs**, both of which are floating? The **Heart** is like **fire**, externally luminous, so the **Heart pulse is floating**. The **Lung** is like **metal**, positioned highest, so the **Lung pulse is floating**. How do we differentiate between the two, both being floating? If it is **floating, large, and dispersed**, it is the **Heart**. A **large pulse** is the **Zang pulse**; a **dispersed pulse** is the **Fu pulse**. If it is **floating, short, and hesitant**, it is the **Lung**. If it does not reach its proper position, it is **short**; if it is **fine and slow**, with **difficult movement** and **occasional cessation**, it is **hesitant**. A **floating, short, and hesitant pulse** is the **Lung pulse**—**short** refers to the **Zang**, and **hesitant** refers to the **Fu**.

How do we distinguish between the **Liver and Kidneys**, both of which are deep? The **Liver and Kidneys** are below the *Ge* (鬲), so their pulses are all deep. How can they be differentiated?

If it is **firm and long**, it is the **Liver**. The **Liver** belongs to **Wood**; **Wood** grows from the earth, hence its **firmness** is understood. Its **branches and leaves** extend to the sky, hence its **length**. **Firm** refers to the **Zang pulse**; **long** refers to the **Fu pulse**.

When pressed, it feels **soft and yielding**; when the finger is lifted, it returns **firm**—this is the **Kidney pulse**. The **Kidney** belongs to **Water**; its nature is **soft**, for **Water**’s essence is externally yielding—when pressed, it is **soft**. Yet **Water**’s essence is internally **firm**; when lifted, it returns **real**. **Soft** refers to the **Zang pulse**; **firm** refers to the **Fu pulse**.

The **Spleen** is the **central realm**. The **Spleen** belongs to **Earth**, occupying the center. **Realm** (*zhou*) carries the meaning of **prefecture and county**; **central realm** (*zhōng zhou*) carries the meaning of **Central Plain**. Thus, its pulse lies in the **middle**. Above it are the **Heart and Lung**; below it are the **Liver and Kidney**, while the **Spleen pulse** resides between them. This follows the **principles of yin and yang**.

The **Heart** is a **yang Zang**, positioned in the **upper burner**, with **yang dwelling in yang**, hence it is **yang within yang**. The **Lung** is a **yin Zang**, positioned in the **upper burner**, with **yin dwelling in yang**, hence it is **yin within yang**. The **Kidney** is a **yin Zang**, positioned in the **lower burner**, with **yin dwelling in yin**, hence it is **yin within yin**. The **Liver** is a **yang Zang**, positioned in the **middle burner**, with **yang dwelling in yin**, hence it is **yin within yang**. The **Spleen** is a **yin Zang**, positioned in the **middle burner**, with **Great Yin dwelling in yin**, making it **the utmost yin within yin**.

The pulses manifest as:
- **One yin and one yang**,
- **One yin and two yangs**,
- **One yin and three yangs**;

Or as:
- **One yang and one yin**,
- **One yang and two yins**,
- **One yang and three yins**.

Thus are spoken the **pulses of yin and yang**. Thus are spoken the **pulses of yin and yang**.

At the *cùnkǒu* [寸口], are there six pulses all moving together?
When inquiring within the *cùnkǒu*, are there six pulses all visibly manifesting?
Indeed: speaking of this—
Speaking of these six pulses.
It is not that six pulses move together.
It is not that these six pulses
all move at the *cùnkǒu*.
Rather, it refers to the pulse arriving as **floating, deep, long, short, smooth, or rough**.

Drawing upon the three *yin* and three *yang* pulses to correspond with the six *qi* [六气]:
Floating, smooth, and long belong to the three *yang* pulses;
Deep, short, and rough belong to the three *yin* pulses.

Floating is *yang*.
Floating is the *Shao Yang* pulse.
Smooth is *yang*.
Smooth is the *Yang Ming* pulse.
Long is *yang*.
Long is the *Tai Yang* pulse.
Deep is *yin*.
Deep is the *Shao Yin* pulse.
Short is *yin*.
Short is the *Jue Yin* pulse.
Rough is *yin*.
Rough is the *Tai Yin* pulse.

What is called **"one *yin* and one *yang**"** refers to the pulse arriving as deep yet smooth.
One *yin* is the **rough pulse**.
One *yang* is the **smooth pulse**.
If the pulse appears at the left hand’s *chi* [尺] department, this is the Kidney and Bladder—**the *Zang-Fu* [藏府] exterior-interior harmony in order**.
If it appears at the left *cùnkǒu*, then it is **a disorder of inversion**.

**"One *yin* and two *yang*"** refers to the pulse arriving as deep, smooth, and long.
One *yin* is the **rough pulse**.
Two *yang* are the **smooth and long pulses**.
This pulse appearing in the *yin* department is **the *yang* descending to dominate the *yin* department**.

**"One *yin* and three *yang*"** refers to the pulse arriving as floating, smooth, and long, yet occasionally deep.
One *yin* is the **deep pulse**.
Three *yang* are the **floating, smooth, and long pulses**.
Already at the *chi* department, it is floating, smooth, and long, yet again occasionally deep—this is **a hidden *yin* within *yang***.

What is called **"one *yang* and one *yin*"** refers to the pulse arriving as floating yet rough.
One *yang* is the **floating pulse**.
One *yin* is the **rough pulse**.
A floating and rough pulse belongs to the Lung—**it should appear at the right hand’s *cùnkǒu*, marking the original department’s *yin-yang* harmony in order**.
If it appears at the *guan* [关], then it is **a disorder of inversion**.

**"One *yang* and two *yin*"** refers to the pulse arriving as long yet deep and rough.
One *yang* is the **long pulse**.
Two *yin* are the **deep and rough pulses**.
The pulse residing in the *yang* department yet revealing *yin* characteristics—this is **blood and *qi* both depleted, *yin* dominating *yang***.

**"One *yang* and three *yin*"** refers to the pulse arriving as deep, rough, and short, yet occasionally floating.
One *yang* is the **floating pulse**.
Three *yin* are the **rough, deep, and short pulses**.
Already at the *cùnkǒu* department, it is deep, rough, and short, yet again occasionally floating—this is **a hidden *yang* within *yin***.

Each is named according to the channel’s location—**whether the disease is inverted or orderly**.
Each is observed through the twelve channels’ locations, examining the six *qi*’s [六气] changes in spring, summer, autumn, and winter, thus knowing whether the disease is inverted or orderly.

The **Five Difficulties** say:
*The pulse has lightness and heaviness—what does this mean?*
When diagnosing the pulse, there is lightness and heaviness—how does this correspond to *yin-yang* elevation and depression? Indeed:
At first, when holding the pulse,
First observe the Lung pulse as an example.
Suppose when initially diagnosing the right hand’s *cùnkǒu* Lung pulse,
If it weighs like **three mung beans** and aligns with the skin and fur—this is the Lung department.
*Mung beans* are beans.
The Lung governs skin and fur; like three beans in weight, between the skin and fur—this is the Lung pulse.
When diagnosing the Lung pulse, one must use a **light hand** to press.
If it weighs like **six mung beans** and aligns with the blood vessels—this is the Heart department.
The Heart governs blood vessels; next to the Lung, like six beans in weight.
When diagnosing the Heart pulse, one must use a **moderately heavy hand** to press.
If it weighs like **nine mung beans** and aligns with the muscles—this is the Spleen department.
The Spleen governs muscles; thus, after the Heart, like nine beans in weight.
When diagnosing the Spleen pulse, one must use a **neither-light-nor-heavy hand** to press.
If it weighs like **twelve mung beans** and aligns with the tendons and bones—this is the Liver department.
The Liver governs tendons; again below the Spleen, like twelve beans in weight.
When diagnosing the Liver pulse, one must use a **moderately heavy hand** to press.
Pressing until the bone, then lifting the finger swiftly—this is the Kidney department.
The Kidney governs bones; its pulse is rough, requiring a **heavy downward hand** to press until the bone.
Lifting the hand, if the pulse arrives swiftly and urgently—this is the Kidney pulse.
Thus it is said: **lightness and heaviness**.
The Heart and Lung are above the *ge* [鬲], the *Zang*’s *yang*—*yang* floats above, so it should be pressed lightly.
The Liver and Kidney are below the *ge*, the *Zang*’s *yin*—*yin* sinks below, so it should be pressed heavily.

---
The **Sixth Difficulty** says:
*The pulse has *yang* excess and *yin* deficiency, *yin* excess and *yang* deficiency—what does this mean?*
There are cases where the *yang* pulse is excessive and full while the *yin* pulse is depleted, and cases where the *yin* pulse is excessive and full while the *yang* pulse is depleted—how does this manifest? Indeed:
When floating, it is diminished.
Floating is the *yang* pulse; if floating yet diminished, it is *yang* deficiency.
The *yang* pulse is at *cùnkǒu*, originally floating and full; now, with a light hand, it is obtained as floating, yet further diminished and small—thus it is said: **the *yang* is deficient and insufficient**.
When deep, it is full and large.
Deep is the *yin* pulse; if deep yet full and large, it is *yin* excess.
The *yin* pulse is at the *chi* department, originally deep and slack; pressing heavily, it becomes even more full and large—this is **excessive *yin***.
Thus it is said: **the *yin* is excessive and the *yang* is deficient**.
Thus it is diagnosed as **the pulse of *yin* excess and *yang* deficiency**.
When deep, it is diminished.
Deep is the *yin* pulse; if deep yet diminished, it is *yin* deficiency.
The *yin* pulse is originally deep; pressing heavily, it becomes even more diminished and small—this is **the *yin* being deficient and insufficient**.
When floating, it is full and large.
Floating is the *yang* pulse; if floating yet full and large, it is *yang* excess.
The *yang* pulse is originally floating; pressing lightly, it becomes even more full and large—this is **excessive *yang***.
Thus it is said: **the *yang* is excessive and the *yin* is deficient**.
Thus it is diagnosed as **the pulse of *yang* excess and *yin* deficiency**.
This is the meaning of *yin-yang* deficiency and excess.
Again, summarizing the meaning of *yin-yang* deficiency and excess.

The **Seven Difficulties** state:

The *Classic* says that when *Shao-Yang* arrives, its pulse is alternately large and small, alternately short and long. *Shao-Yang* reigns in the first and second months; its *qi* is still weak and small, so its pulse advances and retreats irregularly, with no fixed size or length. When *Yang-Ming* arrives, the pulse is floating, large, and short. *Yang-Ming* reigns in the third and fourth months; its *qi* has just begun to sprout but is not yet flourishing, so the pulse comes floating, large, and short. When *Tai-Yang* arrives, the pulse is surging and long. *Tai-Yang* reigns in the fifth and sixth months; its *qi* is excessively strong, so the pulse comes surging, large, and long. When *Tai-Yin* arrives, the pulse is taut, large, and long. *Tai-Yin* reigns in the seventh and eighth months; it inherits the residual *yang* of summer, and *yin* *qi* is not yet strong, so the pulse comes taut, large, and long. When *Shao-Yin* arrives, the pulse is taut, fine, and faint. *Shao-Yin* reigns in the ninth and tenth months; *yang* *qi* declines while *yin* *qi* flourishes, so the pulse is taut, fine, and faint. When *Jue-Yin* arrives, the pulse is deep, short, and firm. *Jue-Yin* reigns in the eleventh and twelfth months; *yin* *qi* is strong, so the pulse comes deep, short, and firm.

Are these six pulses normal? — *Question:* These six pulses—do they belong to the harmonious pulse?
Or are they disease pulses? — *Question:* Do they belong to disease pulses?
*Answer:* They are all **Reigning Pulses**.

Which months do their *qi* reign for how many days?
— *Question:* For the three *yin* and three *yang*, which months do their *qi* reign, and for how many days?

*Answer:* After the Winter Solstice, the first *Jia-Zi* marks *Shao-Yang* reigning. The heavens complete a year through six cycles of sixty days. From the Winter Solstice onward, the first *Jia-Zi* marks the beginning of the new year’s *qi*—sometimes occurring at the start of *Xiao-Han*, sometimes after *Da-Han*. Thus, *Shao-Yang* *qi* has not yet emerged from the *yin* phase, so the pulse is alternately large, small, short, and long.

Next, the second *Jia-Zi* marks *Yang-Ming* reigning—this is the second cycle of *qi*; its warmth begins, but its *qi* is not yet strong, so the pulse comes floating, large, and short.

Next, the third *Jia-Zi* marks *Tai-Yang* reigning—this is the third cycle of *qi*; it is the peak of *yang*, so the pulse comes surging, large, and long.

Next, the fourth *Jia-Zi* marks *Tai-Yin* reigning—this is the fourth cycle of *qi*; it is the phase of summer heat and dampness, and autumn *qi* begins, riding upon the residual *yang* of summer, so the pulse comes taut, large, and long.

Next, the fifth *Jia-Zi* marks *Shao-Yin* reigning—this is the fifth cycle of *qi*; it is the phase of crisp clarity, so the pulse is taut, fine, and faint.

Next, the sixth *Jia-Zi* marks *Jue-Yin* reigning—this is the terminal cycle of *qi*; it is the phase of extreme *yin*, when water congeals like stone, so the pulse is deep, short, and firm.

Each reigns for sixty days. The three *yin* and three *yang* each reign for sixty days—six cycles of sixty days make three hundred sixty days, completing one year. Within a year, the three hundred sixty days are divided into four seasons.

This is the general principle of the reigning periods of the three *yin* and three *yang* according to the *Liu-Jia* cycles.

**The Eighth Difficulty:**

*Question:* Why does a person die when the *Cun-Kou* pulse is even and harmonious?

*Answer:* The twelve primary channels—[refer to the First Difficulty].

**The Eighth Difficulty:**

*Question:* Why does a person die when the *Cun-Kou* pulse is even and harmonious?

*Answer:* The *Cun-Kou* pulse reflects the state of the **root of life-giving *qi***—the twelve primary channels all depend on the **kidneys**. The kidneys are the source and foundation of the *qi* that generates and sustains the pulse. This "root of life-giving *qi*" refers to the fundamental origin of the twelve primary channels. The kidneys, as the root of life-giving *qi*, serve as the foundation for all twelve primary channels. The kidneys govern the **movement of *qi***—the dynamic *qi* between them is the **primal *qi*** inherited from one’s parents. Moreover, the **pulse of *qi* surging** originates from the space between the two kidneys. This is the source of the five *zàng* organs and six *fǔ* viscera, the root of the twelve primary channels. The five *zàng* and six *fǔ* are distributed into the twelve primary channels, with the kidneys as their ultimate foundation. The **gateway of respiration**—the kidneys flank the **Conception Vessel (任脈)** and **Governor Vessel (豚脈)**, extending upward to the throat, where breathing and exhalation occur, making it the gateway of respiration. The **origin of the Triple Burner (三焦)**—the human Triple Burner follows the **three primal *qi*** of Heaven and Earth, with the kidneys as its foundational source. It is also called the **Guardian of Pathogenic *Qi* (守邪之神)**. The left kidney corresponds to the **kidneys**, while the right governs the **Gate of Life (命門)**, where a spirit resides, preventing pathogenic *qi* from entering the **Zhi-Shi (志室)**. If pathogenic *qi* invades the **Zhi-Shi**, death ensues. **Zhi-Shi** is the name of an acupuncture point. Thus, *qi* is the root foundation of a person’s vitality. The movement of *qi* between the kidneys is the fundamental source of human life and vitality. If the root is severed, the branches and leaves wither. The **three *yin* and three *yang* channels of the hand** are the branches, while those of the **foot** are the roots. The **Chi (尺)** region represents a person’s foundational roots, and the *Cun-Kou* pulse reflects the branches and leaves. If the root of wood is severed, the wood dies; if the kidneys’ *qi* is severed, the person dies. When the *Cun-Kou* pulse is even and harmonious yet the person dies, it means the **internal life-giving *qi*** has been utterly depleted. The kidneys’ movement of *qi* is normally concealed within, but now the *Cun-Kou* pulse receives nourishment from ingested *gu* (谷氣, grain *qi*), though the pulse itself may appear even and harmonious. However, since the life-giving *qi* between the kidneys has already been severed, the twelve primary channels lose their support. Even if the *Cun-Kou* pulse remains even and harmonious, death still occurs.

**The Ninth Difficulty:**
*Question:* How can one distinguish the diseases of the *zàng* organs and *fǔ* viscera?

*Answer:* The *zàng* organs and *fǔ* viscera’s diseases are discerned by examining the pulse’s **frequency (數)** and **slowness (迟)**. If the pulse is rapid, it indicates the six *fǔ* viscera are diseased. If the pulse is slow, it signifies the five *zàng* organs are afflicted. A rapid pulse denotes **heat (熱)**—it is a *yang* pulse, indicating symptoms of excess *yang* heat. A slow pulse denotes **cold (寒)**—it is a *yin* pulse, indicating symptoms of *yin* deficiency. All *yang* pulses relate to heat. When *yang* *qi* is disordered, the pulse becomes rapid, thus all *yang* pulses are associated with heat. All *yin* pulses relate to cold. When *yin* *qi* is deficient, the pulse becomes slow, thus all *yin* pulses are associated with cold. Therefore, one can distinguish the diseases of the *zàng* organs and *fǔ* viscera through these pulse variations.

---

**The Tenth Difficulty:**
*Question:* What does it mean when one pulse shows ten variations?

*Answer:* It refers to the **five pathogenic *qi***—*xū* (虚, vacuous), *shí* (實, solid), *zhèng* (正, upright), *wēi* (微, subtle), and *zéi* (贼, thief)—interacting with the **relative strength of *yin* and *yang*** (just and yielding). The five pathogenic *qi* arise when these interactions occur at their **original positions**, revealing **foreign pulses**. Each *zàng* organ has its own exterior and interior connections, and they **mutually invade** in sequence, resulting in one pulse manifesting ten variations. These ten variations correspond to the **cyclical dominance of the Five Phases (五行)**. Pathogenic *qi* refers to any irregularity not originating from the body’s inherent *qi*, but instead **externally disrupting** it to cause disease.

For instance, if the **heart pulse** is excessively taut and urgent, it is due to **liver pathogenic *qi*** invading the heart. The sages use the heart as an example for one *zàng* organ. In summer, the heart pulse should be **floating, large, and diffuse**, but if it instead becomes taut and urgent, it indicates **liver pathogenic *qi*** invading the heart. The liver is the mother, the heart the child; wood generates fire, and the mother invades the child—this is called **vacuous pathogenic *qi***.

If the heart pulse is slightly urgent, it is due to **gallbladder pathogenic *qi*** invading the **small intestine**. The small intestine is the heart’s *fǔ* viscus; the gallbladder is the liver’s *fǔ* viscus. When the heart pulse is slightly urgent, it indicates **gallbladder pathogenic *qi*** invading the small intestine.

If the heart pulse is excessively large, it is due to **heart pathogenic *qi*** itself invading the heart. Though the heart pulse may appear **full and strong**, it should fundamentally rely on **stomach *qi***. If the stomach *qi* is absent, the pulse becomes excessively large—this is called **upright pathogenic *qi*** of the primary channel itself, hence the term **self-invasion**.

If the heart pulse is slightly large, it is due to **small intestine pathogenic *qi*** itself invading the small intestine. A slightly large heart pulse indicates self-disease of the small intestine.

If the heart pulse is excessively relaxed and slow, it is due to **spleen pathogenic *qi*** invading the heart. A relaxed pulse belongs to the spleen; if the heart pulse is excessively relaxed and slow, it signifies fire as the mother and earth as the child, with the child invading the mother—this is called **solid pathogenic *qi***, as spleen pathogenic *qi* invades the heart pulse.

If the heart pulse is slightly relaxed, it is due to **stomach pathogenic *qi*** invading the small intestine. When lightly palpating the heart region and encountering a slightly relaxed pulse, it indicates **stomach pathogenic *qi*** invading and overwhelming the small intestine.

If the heart pulse is excessively rough and choppy, it is due to **lung pathogenic *qi*** invading the heart. A rough pulse belongs to the lungs; if the heart region exhibits a rough pulse, it signifies metal overwhelming fire—this is called **subtle pathogenic *qi***.

If the heart pulse is slightly rough, it is due to **large intestine pathogenic *qi*** invading the small intestine. When encountering a slightly rough pulse in the heart region, it indicates **large intestine pathogenic *qi*** invading and overwhelming the small intestine.

If the heart pulse is excessively deep, it is due to **kidney pathogenic *qi*** invading the heart. A deep pulse belongs to the kidneys; if the heart pulse is excessively deep, it signifies water subduing fire—this is called **thief pathogenic *qi***.

If the heart pulse is slightly deep, it is due to **bladder pathogenic *qi*** invading the small intestine. When palpating the heart region with a heavy touch and encountering a slightly deep pulse, it indicates **bladder pathogenic *qi*** invading and overwhelming the small intestine.

Each of the five *zàng* organs has its own relative strength of *yin* and *yang*. The *yin* and *yang* interactions within the five *zàng* organs are exemplified by the heart, with the rest following similarly. Thus, one pulse can manifest ten variations. Within one pulse region, there are multiple variations, totaling sixty instances. The heart region alone exhibits five pathogenic *qi* interactions, resulting in ten variations.

**The Eleventh Difficulty:**
*Question:* The text states, *"A pulse that does not complete fifty beats before stopping is a flat pulse."* If one *zàng* organ completes fifty beats, then all five *zàng* organs complete two hundred fifty beats—this is called an **even pulse**. If a pulse does not complete fifty beats before stopping, it means **one *zàng* organ has no *qi***.

**The Eleventh Difficulty (continued):**
When a pulse stops, it means pressing reveals a cessation beneath the fingers—this is called *stopping*. If one *zàng* organ lacks *qi*, which organ is it? If one *zàng* organ lacks *qi*, which *zàng-fu* organ is it?

Now, when inhaling, *qi* follows *yin* and enters. Inhalation draws through the lips into the liver, so inhalation *qi* follows the liver and kidneys. The liver is below the *ge* (stomach cavity), and the kidneys are *yin*. When exhaling, *qi* follows *yang* and exits. Exhalation releases through the heart and lungs, so exhalation *qi* emerges from the heart and lungs. The heart and lungs are above the *ge*, hence *yang*. Now, if inhalation cannot reach the kidneys but stops at the liver, then generally, inhalation and exhalation should follow *yin* and *yang*, ascending and descending through the five *zàng* organs, maintaining equilibrium in a healthy person. But here, exhalation emerges from the heart and lungs, while inhalation reaches only the liver before returning—never reaching the kidneys. This indicates the kidneys’ primordial *qi*, inherited from one’s parents, has already dissipated. Thus, the pulse does not complete fifty beats before stopping, and death is imminent. Therefore, if one *zàng* organ lacks *qi*, it is the kidney *qi* that is exhausted first. Hence, if one *zàng* organ’s primordial *qi* is depleted, it is the kidney’s primordial *qi* that is first severed, causing the pulse to fail before fifty beats.

---

**The Twelfth Difficulty:**
The text states, *"The pulse of the five *zàng* organs has already ceased within."* The pulses of the liver and kidneys are below the *ge*, hence called *within*. If the internal pulse has ceased, the practitioner should instead reinforce the *external*. The heart and lungs are above the *ge*, hence called *external*. Those who use acupuncture or medicine should instead reinforce the heart and lungs with needles or prescriptions.

If the pulse of the five *zàng* organs has already ceased *externally*, the heart and lung pulses have died outside. The practitioner should instead reinforce the *internal*. Those who use acupuncture or medicine should instead reinforce the kidneys and liver with needles or prescriptions.

How does one distinguish between internal and external cessation? If the pulse of the five *zàng* organs has ceased within, the *qi* of the kidneys and liver has died internally. Yet the physician reinforces the heart and lungs instead—treating the wrong organs. If the pulse of the five *zàng* organs has ceased externally, the heart and lung *qi* has died outside. Yet the physician reinforces the kidneys and liver instead—treating the wrong organs.

When *yang* is exhausted, reinforce *yin*. The heart and lungs, being above the *ge*, belong to *yang*. If their external pulses cease, the skin withers and hair falls out. The kidneys and liver, being below the *ge*, belong to *yin*. The physician reinforces them instead. When *yin* is exhausted, reinforce *yang*. If the kidneys and liver’s internal pulses cease, the bones weaken and tendons fail. The physician reinforces the heart and lungs instead. This is called *treating excess with excess*—reinforcing a patient already in excess. *Treating deficiency with deficiency*—reinforcing a patient already in deficiency. *Diminishing what is insufficient*—harming a patient already weak. *Augmenting what is already excessive*—overloading a patient with surplus *qi*. Such deaths are the physician’s fault.

---

**The Thirteenth Difficulty:**
The text states, *"Seeing the color but not finding the corresponding pulse."* If one sees a color but instead finds the pulse of its *overcoming* cycle, death follows. If one finds the pulse of its *generating* cycle, illness follows. How should one correlate the patient’s color with their pulse?

Now, the five *zàng* organs each have a color, all visible on the face: the heart is red, the liver green, the spleen yellow, the lungs white, and the kidneys black. These colors should correspond to the pulses at *cùn-kǒu* (wrist) and *chǐ* (inner arm).

For example:
- If the color is green, the pulse should be taut and urgent—green is the liver’s color, and taut/urgent is the liver’s pulse. This is the liver’s color and pulse corresponding.
- If the color is red, the pulse should be floating, large, and scattered—red is the heart’s color, and floating/large/scattered is the heart’s pulse. This is the heart’s color and pulse corresponding.
- If the color is yellow, the pulse should be moderate and large—yellow is the spleen’s color, and moderate/large is the spleen’s pulse. This is the spleen’s color and pulse corresponding.
- If the color is white, the pulse should be floating, rough, and short—white is the lung’s color, and floating/rough/short is the lung’s pulse. This is the lung’s color and pulse corresponding.
- If the color is black, the pulse should be deep, soft, and slippery—black is the kidney’s color, and deep/soft/slippery is the kidney’s pulse. This is the kidney’s color and pulse corresponding.

This is how the five colors should correspond to their respective pulses.

If the pulse is rapid, the skin of the *chǐ* (inner arm) is also hot—rapid is the heart’s pulse, and the inner arm’s skin is hot. If the pulse is taut and urgent, the liver’s pulse, the inner arm’s skin is also taut. If the pulse is moderate, the spleen’s pulse, the inner arm’s skin is also slack. If the pulse is rough, the lung’s pulse, the inner arm’s skin is also rough. If the pulse is slippery, the kidney’s pulse, the inner arm’s skin is also slippery.

The five *zàng* organs each have their own sounds, colors, odors, and tastes, which should correspond to the pulses at *cùn-kǒu* and *chǐ*:
- The liver’s pulse is taut, its color green, its sound a sigh, its odor rank, and its taste sour;
- The heart’s pulse is resonant, its color red, its sound laughter, its odor burnt, and its taste bitter;
- The spleen’s pulse is moderate, its color yellow, its sound singing, its odor fragrant, and its taste sweet;

The lung’s pulse is rough, its color white, its sound weeping, its odor fishy, and its taste pungent;
The kidney’s pulse is deep, its color black, its sound groaning, its odor rotten, and its taste salty.
This is called correspondence.

When they do not correspond, it is illness.
Suppose the liver is diseased, yet the color is white, there is much weeping, a fondness for pungent flavors, and a liking for fishy odors—this is contrary.
When sound, color, odor, and taste all belong to the lung, metal overcoming wood, it is called *zéi-xié* (predatory evil). If they do not correspond, death follows.

Suppose the color is green, yet the pulse is floating, rough, and short—if it is also large and moderate, this is called *xiāng-shèng* (mutual overcoming).
The green color is of the liver;
The floating, rough, and short pulse is of the lung.
When the lung overcomes the liver, it is predatory evil.
If the pulse is large and moderate, it is the spleen’s pulse, and when the liver overcomes the spleen, it is a minor evil—thus called mutual overcoming.

If the pulse is floating, large, and scattered, or small and slippery, this is called *xiāng-shēng* (mutual generation).
The floating, large, and scattered pulse is of the heart;
The liver wood can generate heart fire.
The small and slippery pulse is of the kidney;
The kidney water can generate liver wood.

The Classics say: Knowing one [principle] makes one a lower artisan, knowing two makes one a middle artisan, knowing three makes one an upper artisan.
An upper artisan succeeds nine out of ten cases, a middle artisan succeeds eight out of ten, and a lower artisan succeeds six out of ten—this is what is meant.

The artisan is one who achieves success in all endeavors and treatments. An upper artisan knows the three laws of **color, pulse, and skin**, understanding the principles of mutual generation and mutual overcoming, hence treating diseases with nine successes out of ten. A middle artisan knows two laws, unable to fully grasp all three, so treats diseases with eight successes out of ten. A lower artisan knows only one law, unable to fully comprehend the complete methods, and thus treats only the present ailment, achieving six successes out of ten.

The Fourteen Difficulties state:
The Fourteenth Difficulty asks: What is meant by *pulse of excess* (至脉)?

Pulse has **excess pulse** (至脉) and **deficient pulse** (损脉). Now, regarding the **excess pulse**:
The pulse beats in response to the hand’s movement. With one breath, it arrives twice—this is called *level* (平). *Level* refers to the pulse’s rhythm being neither too strong nor too weak, completing two beats per breath. Again, four beats are called *harmonious pulse* (平和之豚息). Three beats are called *deviation from the norm* (离经). *Norm* (经) means *usual* or *constant*. A great deviation from the norm (大几经豚) occurs when, in one day and night, the pulse returns to the *hand Taiyin* (手太阴) channel, which is the starting point of inquiry. Now, with three beats per breath, the pulse travels four and a half inches; with three beats per inhalation, it travels four and a half inches; the total per breath is nine inches, exceeding the *level pulse* (平脉), and not conforming to its usual rhythm, hence called *deviation from the norm*—its pulse is coarse and large.

Five beats are called *consumption of essence* (夺精). Such a pulse is fivefold, for *flavor returns to form*, *form returns to qi*, and *qi returns to essence* (精). Now, with four beats per breath, form is stripped, qi is exhausted, and essence has nowhere to go—it is as if stolen. Six beats are called *life’s end* (命绝). Within one breath, the pulse reaches nearly twelve beats, and life ceases without vitality. This is the **excess pulse** (至脉). The original text says: This is the *pulse of death* (死之脉). I have amended it to say: This is the **excess pulse** (至脉), summarizing its nature.

What is *deficient* (损)? Regarding the *deficient pulse* (损脉):
With one breath and one beat, it is called *deviation from the norm* (离经). Earlier, the **excess pulse** (至脉) was called *deviation from the norm*, meaning the pulse exceeds half its usual rhythm. Now, the *deficient pulse* (损脉) is called *deviation from the norm*, meaning the pulse travels less than half its usual rhythm—one breath and one inhalation yield only two beats, also called *deviation from the norm*.

With two breaths and one beat, it is called *consumption of essence* (夺精). With two breaths and one beat, in one day and night, the pulse completes fewer than thirteen full cycles through the body, traveling only 225 feet and 5 inches. The person’s *qi is exhausted*, *blood is dried*, their *spirit is dimmed*, and their *complexion withers*—their essence is consumed as if stolen, hence called *consumption of essence*.

With three breaths and one beat, it is called *death* (死). With three breaths and one beat, the pulse travels only one and a half inches, completing in one day and night only 67 feet and 5 inches—less than five full cycles. Such a sign portends death.

With four breaths and one beat, it is called *life’s end* (命绝). With four breaths and one beat, in one day and night, the pulse completes fewer than four full cycles. The *qi is spent*, the *life is severed*, the *organs are ruined*, and the *spirit departs*—hence, life’s end.

This is the **deficient pulse** (损脉). Summarizing its nature:
The **excess pulse** (至脉) arises from below and moves upward. With fewer breaths and more beats, it is called *excess*. **Excess pulse** diseases originate in *Yang*, for *Yang qi* ascends from below, hence its severity affects both upper and lower regions, progressively damaging six organs.

The *deficient pulse* (损脉) arises from above and moves downward. With more breaths and fewer beats, it is called *deficient*. **Deficient pulse** diseases originate in *Yin*, for *Yin qi* descends from above, and its pulse weakens, failing to reach one or two beats.

How does the *deficient pulse* manifest as illness?
A *deficient pulse* in the first instance harms the *skin and fur* (皮毛), causing *skin to clump* and *fur to fall*. The first deficiency affects the *lung*, which governs *skin and fur*—hence, *skin clumps* and *fur falls*.

The second deficiency harms the *blood vessels* (血脉), making *blood and vessels sparse*, unable to nourish the *five organs and six entrails*. The second deficiency affects the *heart*, which governs *blood*—when *blood and vessels are depleted*, the *five organs and six entrails* cannot flourish.

The third deficiency harms the *muscles*, causing *muscles to wither and thin*, and *food not to benefit the flesh*. The third deficiency affects the *spleen*, the *storage of food*—when the *spleen is injured*, one should eat *spring chilled foods*, *summer cool gases*, and *winter warm foods*, adjusting to the seasonal *cold and warmth* to regulate diet, then the *spleen’s function will align*.

The fourth deficiency harms the *sinews*, making them *relaxed and unable to self-support*. The fourth deficiency affects the *liver*, which governs *sinews*—when *sinews are slack*, they cannot maintain or uphold the body.

The fifth deficiency harms the *bones*, causing *bone weakness* and inability to rise from the bed. The fifth deficiency affects the *kidney*, which governs *bones*—when *bones are dry* and *marrow is depleted*, the *vitality is lost*. *Weakness* (痿) means *lack of strength to rise*. The opposite is true for **excess pulse** (至脉) diseases. The original text states: *Excess pulse leads to withdrawal disease* (至於收病), but I have corrected it to *the opposite*.

In the case of the *deficient pulse*, if *bone weakness* prevents rising from the bed, it is death. The *spleen* is above, the *kidney* is below—first deficiency affects the *lung*, second the *heart*, third the *spleen*, fourth the *liver*, and fifth the *kidney*. From *lung* to *kidney*, all five organs are deficient—the *kidney governs bones*, and *bone weakness* leads to death.

In the case of **excess pulse** (至脉), if *skin clumps* and *fur falls*, it is also death. From *kidney* to *lung*, all five organs are deficient—the *lung reaches skin and fur*, and *skin clumping* with *fur falling* also leads to death.

However, if the *lung* is deficient, one should *augment its qi*. When *cold invades the body* and *food is improper*, the *lung is harmed*—since the *lung governs qi*, and its qi has been depleted by *cold exposure* and *improper diet*, one should *increase its qi* to treat it.

If the *heart* is deficient, one should *regulate its *Honor and Defense* (荣卫)*. *Worry, grief, and overthinking harm the heart*—since the *heart governs blood*, and its blood has been depleted by *worry, grief, and overthinking*, one should *adjust the *Honor and Defense* (荣卫)* to treat it.

If the *spleen* is deficient, one should *adjust its diet* and *moderate its cold and warmth*. *Overwork and fatigue harm the spleen*—when the *spleen’s function is impaired*, one should eat *spring chilled foods*, *summer cool gases*, and *winter warm foods*, following the seasonal *cold and warmth* to regulate diet, then the *spleen’s function will align*.

If the *liver* is deficient, one should *soothe its center*.

When *anger* causes *inverted qi* (逆氣), with *qi* rising but not descending, it harms the *liver*. The *liver governs anger*, and its *qi* is swift (急氣); thus, one should eat *sweet* (甘) foods to soothe it. *Sweet* in nature is gentle, and *sweet* belongs to the *spleen* (脾土), the *Earth* element dwelling in the *Middle Palace* (中宮). By using *sweet* flavors to temper the *liver’s center* (其中), its harm is mitigated.

If the *kidney* (腎) is injured, one should *nourish its essence* (精). Prolonged sitting in damp places or exerting oneself in water harms the *kidney*, which governs *essence*. When the *kidney channel* (腎經) is damaged, *gentle, sweet* foods should be taken to replenish its *essence-qi* (精氣). This is the method of treating *injured channels* (损至).

Furthermore, it broadly discusses the *principles of diagnosing channel injuries* (损至病法度). The pulse has *one beat per two breaths* (一呼再至), *one beat per two inhalations* (一吸再至). Between *one exhalation* (一呼), the pulse arrives *twice* (豚凡二至); between *one inhalation* (一吸), the pulse also arrives *twice* (豚亦二至). There is also *one beat per three breaths* (一呼三至), *one beat per three inhalations* (一吸三至). Between *one exhalation*, the pulse nearly arrives *three times* (脉幾三至); between *one inhalation*, the pulse also arrives *three times* (豚亦三至). Similarly, *one beat per four breaths* (一呼四至), *one beat per four inhalations* (一吸四至)—between *one exhalation*, the pulse nearly arrives *four times* (脉幾四至); between *one inhalation*, the pulse arrives *four times* (豚亦四至). *One beat per five breaths* (一呼五至), *one beat per five inhalations* (一吸五至)—between *one exhalation*, the pulse arrives *five times* (豚凡五至); between *one inhalation*, the pulse arrives *five times* (豚亦五至). *One beat per six breaths* (一呼六至), *one beat per six inhalations* (一吸六至)—between *one exhalation*, the pulse arrives *six times* (豚凡六至); between *one inhalation*, the pulse arrives *six times* (豚亦六至). *One beat per single breath* (一呼一至), *one beat per single inhalation* (一吸一至)—between *one exhalation*, the pulse should arrive *twice* (豚當二至), yet here it arrives *once* (今反骗至); between *one inhalation*, the pulse should arrive *twice* (豚當二至), yet here it arrives *once* (今反一至). There is also *two exhalations per single beat* (再呼一至), *two inhalations per single beat* (再吸一至). Between *two exhalations and two inhalations*, the pulse should arrive *eight times* (豚當八至), yet here it arrives *only twice* (今反止得二至). Or, *one beat per two breaths and inhalations* (呼吸再至). Annotation states: *"One beat per two breaths"* (一呼再至), *"one beat per two inhalations"* (一吸再至)—this refers to the *four beats* (四至) of the *even pulse* (平豚). Annotation states: *"One beat per two breaths and inhalations"* (呼吸之问止二至)—this refers to the *two beats* (二至) of the *uneven pulse* (敗豚). *[Note: The original text mentions "禺不明此句" (Yǔ does not understand this sentence) and requests later scholars to clarify, but no further annotation is provided.]*

When the pulse arrives in such ways, how does one distinguish its *disease* (疾病)? When the pulse and breath arrive in such patterns, how does one diagnose the *illness* (疾病)?

Thus: If the pulse arrives *one beat per two breaths* (一呼再至), *one beat per two inhalations* (一吸再至), neither *overly strong* (不大) nor *overly weak* (不小), it is called *even* (平). If the pulse arrives *twice per exhalation* (一呼而豚二至) and *twice per inhalation* (一吸而豚二至), without excess or deficiency, it is called the *even and harmonious pulse* (平和之豚).

If the pulse arrives *three times per exhalation* (一呼三至), *three times per inhalation* (一吸三至), it indicates *adapted disease* (適得病). If the pulse arrives *three times per exhalation* (一呼而豚三至), *three times per inhalation* (一吸而豚三至), and its pulse is *coarse and large* (其豚粗大), it is called *deviating from the channel* (離經), indicating *adapted disease* (適然始得病). If the pulse is *large at the front* (前大) and *small at the back* (後小), it indicates *headache and dizziness* (頭痛目眩). The *front large* (前大) refers to a *large pulse at the radial end* (寸外大); the *back small* (後小) refers to a *small pulse at the ulnar end* (寸内小). The *upper section follows Heaven* (上部法天), governing *diseases from the chest upward to the head* (胸以上至頭之上有疾). The *radial end* (寸口) is the *upper section*, so when the head and brain ache and the eyes feel dizzy, it is due to this. If the pulse is *small at the front* (前小) and *large at the back* (後大), it indicates *chest fullness and shortness of breath* (胸滿短氣). The *front small* (前小) refers to a *small pulse at the radial end* (寸外小); the *back large* (後大) refers to a *large pulse at the ulnar end* (寸内大). This governs *chest and diaphragm congestion* (胸膈滿塞) and *breathing difficulty* (氣息短促).

If the pulse arrives *four times per exhalation* (一呼四至), *four times per inhalation* (一吸四至), the *disease is severe* (病欲甚). The *even pulse* (平豚) has only *four beats* (四至); now, if the pulse arrives *four times per exhalation* (一呼而豚四至), totaling *eight beats* (共得八至), the pulse is *double the normal rate* (豚倍常經), indicating the *disease is severe but not yet critical* (病欲甚乍不及).

If the pulse is *overflowing and large* (洪大), it indicates *suffering, agitation, and fullness* (苦煩滿). Within the *eight-beat pulse* (八至), if the pulse is *overflowing and large* (豚洪大), the *disease lies in the three yang channels* (病在三陽), where *yang excess causes agitation and fullness* (陽盛煩燥痞滿). If the pulse is *deep and fine* (沉細), it indicates *abdominal pain* (腹中痛). Within the *eight-beat pulse* (八至), if the pulse is *deep and fine* (豚沉細), the *disease lies in the three yin channels* (病在三陰), as *yin governs the interior* (陰主於内), causing *abdominal pain* (腹肚疼痛). If the pulse is *slippery* (滑), it indicates *injury by heat* (傷熱). Within the *eight-beat pulse* (八至), if the pulse is *slippery* (豚滑), it indicates *internal heat* (中傷熱). If the pulse is *rough* (澀), it indicates *injury by mist and dew* (傷露寒氣). Within the *eight-beat pulse* (八至), if the pulse is *rough* (脉涩), it indicates *injury by dampness from mist and dew* (傷露寒氣).

If the pulse arrives *five times per exhalation* (一呼五至), *five times per inhalation* (一吸五至), the person will be *exhausted* (當困). If the pulse arrives *five times per exhalation* (一呼而豚五至), *qi* and *blood* are laboriously depleted (氣血勞走), causing the person to be *exhausted* (铃困). If the pulse is *deep and fine at night* (沉細夜加), it indicates the *disease worsens at night* (主夜问疾加). Within the *ten-beat pulse* (十至), if the pulse is *deep and fine* (豚沉細), it indicates *nighttime exacerbation* (主夜问疾加). If the pulse is *floating and large during the day* (浮大昼加), it indicates the *disease worsens during the day* (主昼间疾加). Within the *ten-beat pulse* (十至), if the pulse is *floating and large* (豚浮大), it indicates *daytime exacerbation* (主昼间疾加). Even if the pulse is neither *large nor small* (既不浮大，又不沉細), though the person is *exhausted*, it can still be treated (虽困可疗治). If the pulse has *irregular strength* (其有小大者), it is *difficult to treat* (為難治). Within the *ten-beat pulse* (十至), if the pulse is *extremely floating and large* (脉极浮大), it indicates *fire excess and exhaustion* (火盛铃灭). If the pulse is *extremely deep and fine* (脉极況细), it indicates *water weakness and depletion* (水弱叉竭).

If the pulse arrives *once per exhalation* (一呼一至), *once per inhalation* (一吸一至), it is called *injured* (损). The pulse should arrive *four times per breath and inhalation* (呼吸當四至), yet here it arrives *only twice* (今止二至), hence it is called the *injured pulse* (损豚). Though the person can still walk (人虽能行步),

「Though the patient should still lie in bed,
and though the illness is external while lying in bed,
this is because the blood and qi are both deficient.

The reason for lying in bed is due to the deficiency of blood and qi.

*Twice per exhalation* (再呼一至).
*Twice per exhalation and inhalation*, the pulse should arrive eight times (再呼再吸当八至), yet here it arrives only four times (今止四至).
*Pulse arrives twice per breath cycle* (呼吸再至).
*—This sentence is ambiguous; see prior annotation.*

It is called the *pulse of no soul* (无魂).
The *pulse of no soul* (无魂者) indicates impending death.

If exhalations are many while inhalations are few (呼多至少),
it signifies that the soul has already departed.
The soul belongs to *yang*, and *yang* governs life.
When the soul departs, one knows death is near.

Though the person can still walk, it is called a *walking corpse* (行尸).
Though the person can still walk, it is called a *corpse that walks* (死尸在行).

*The upper region has pulse* (上部有脉).
The *cun* position is the upper region; the *cun* department has pulse.
*The lower region lacks pulse* (下部无脉).
The *chi* position is the lower region; the *chi* department lacks pulse.

The patient will vomit.
The patient will naturally induce vomiting.
If there is no vomiting, death follows.
No vomiting means that *sheng* (生气, vital breath) is solely exhausted within.

If the upper region lacks pulse while the lower region has pulse,
though exhausted, no harm will come.
If the *cun* department lacks pulse while the *chi* department has pulse,
though the illness is extreme, no harm will ensue.

This is because, as with a person’s *chi* (尺) or a tree’s roots.
The reason no harm comes is that a person’s *chi* pulse is like a tree’s root.
Though branches and leaves may wither and decay, the root will regenerate.
The *cun* department is like the tree’s branches and leaves,
while the *chi* department is like the tree’s root.
Since a person has the *chi* pulse,
even without the *cun* pulse, life remains possible.

The pulse has its root.
The root lies in the *chi* department; if the *chi* department has pulse,
it means the pulse has its root.

A person possesses *yuan* (元气, original breath),
thus one knows death will not come.
The moving *qi* between the two kidneys
is the *yuan* breath received from one’s parents.
If the *chi* department has pulse, it means the person’s *yuan* breath is unbroken,
thus one knows death will not come.

The *Fifteen Difficulties* state:
*The Classic says the spring pulse is taut* (经言春脉弦).*」*

The spring pulse beats like the taut string of a bow or zither—tight and firm.
The summer pulse is *gōu* (钩).
The summer pulse beats like the curve of a hook.
The autumn pulse is *máo* (毛).
The autumn pulse beats light and floating like fine hair.
The winter pulse is *shí* (石).
The winter pulse beats heavy and deep like a stone.

Is this the *wáng* (王) pulse?
Asked: Is this the pulse of *wáng* (王) vitality?
Or is it a disease pulse?
Asked: Is this the pulse of illness?

Yet: *xuán* (弦), *gōu* (钩), *máo* (毛), and *shí* (石) are the pulses of the four seasons.
*Xuán* (弦) is the spring *wáng* (王) pulse.
*Gōu* (钩) is the summer *wáng* (王) pulse.
*Máo* (毛) is the autumn *wáng* (王) pulse.
*Shí* (石) is the winter pulse of *wáng* (王).
None are disease pulses.

The spring pulse is *xuán* (弦) because it belongs to the liver—*shù fāng* (束方), the wood of *jiǎ-yǐ* (甲乙).
Spring belongs to *shù fāng* (束方), *jiǎ-yǐ* (甲乙), the liver wood, and its pulse is *xuán* (弦).
When all things first emerge, they have no branches or leaves.
All things begin with their roots and yellow buds in spring, before branches and leaves appear.
Thus, when its pulse arrives, it is soft, weak, yet long.
Hence it is called *xuán* (弦).
Long refers to the pulse’s tautness.
Soft and weak yet long describes its pulse as faintly *xuán* (弦).
Faintly *xuán* (弦) means the stomach *qi* is present.

The summer pulse is *gōu* (钩) because it belongs to the heart—*nán fāng* (南方), the fire of *bǐng-dīng* (丙丁).
Summer belongs to *nán fāng* (南方), *bǐng-dīng* (丙丁), the heart fire, and its pulse is *gōu* (钩).
When all things flourish, their branches hang downward, leaves spread out, all curving like hooks.
Summer is when all things are nourished to their peak—branches and leaves lush, flowers and leaves scattered, all curving downward like hooks.
Thus, when its pulse arrives swiftly and departs slowly, it is called *gōu* (钩).
Swift arrival is the vigor of *yáng* (阳), seen in the *cùn* (寸) position.
Slow departure is the depletion of *yīn* (阴), seen in the *zhōng* (尺中) position.
Swift arrival describes its pulse as surging.
Swift arrival and slow departure describe its pulse as faintly surging, meaning the stomach *qi* is present.

The autumn pulse is *máo* (毛) because it belongs to the lung—*xī fāng* (西方), the metal of *gēng-xīn* (庚辛).
Autumn belongs to *xī fāng* (西方), *gēng-xīn* (庚辛), the lung metal, and its pulse is *máo* (毛).
When all things reach their end, grasses and trees shed their flowers and leaves, leaving only bare branches, like fine hair.
Autumn is the season of *sù-shā* (肃杀), when grasses and trees drop their flowers and leaves, leaving only branches—sparse like hair.
Thus, when its pulse arrives, it is light, empty, and floating, hence called *máo* (毛).
The lung floats above, its *qi* governing skin and hair, so its pulse is floating like hair.

The winter pulse is *shí* (石) because it belongs to the kidney—*běi fāng* (北方), the water of *rén-guǐ* (壬癸).
Winter belongs to *běi fāng* (北方), *rén-guǐ* (壬癸), the kidney water, and its pulse is *shí* (石).
When all things are stored away.
All things retreat and hide in winter.
In deep winter, water congeals like stone.
In deep winter, the earth freezes, and water hardens like stone.
Thus, when its pulse arrives, it is deep, damp, and smooth, hence called *shí* (石).
Deep is the proper quality of the winter pulse.
Deep and damp yet smooth implies faint depth, meaning the stomach *qi* is present.

These are the pulses of the four seasons.
A summary of the pulses of the four seasons.

「What if there are changes? If the pulse shifts from its seasonal norm, how should it be treated?
Now: In spring, the pulse is *prickly* (弦), but if it reverses, it is a sign of illness.
What is meant by *reversal*? In spring, the liver pulse should be prickly, but if it opposes the prickly pulse, then it is a liver disease.
What is called *excessive reversal*?
Now: When the *qi* arrives with excessive strength, it is called *too much*, and the illness lies externally.
Spring is the season of *Lesser Yang* (少阳) dominance, and its pulse is faintly prickly, implying the presence of stomach *qi*.
Now, if the pulse *qi* arrives with excessive strength, it is called *too much*.
Excessive strength means *Yang* is too vigorous.
The illness lies externally, with symptoms of frequent cleanliness (*善洁*), greenish face (*面青*), and quick temper (*善怒*).
When the *qi* arrives faint and weak, it is called *not enough*, and the illness lies internally.
The pulse of *Jue Yin* (厥阴) manifests in tendons (*筋*), and its pulse is prickly.
Now, if it becomes faint and weak, it is called *not enough*.
Since *Yin* resides in the center, the illness is internal.
Symptoms include fullness in the limbs (*四肢满*), closed pain (*闭疼*), difficult urination (*波便难*), and tetanic cramps (*转筋*).
When the *qi* arrives with a dull and faint rhythm, like a leaf trembling in the wind on a *yú* (榆) tree, it is called *level* (平).
Spring combines *Lesser Yang* and *Jue Yin*, and their pulses arrive like spring wind rustling willow leaves—moist, weak, and harmonious, hence called *level pulse*.
Level means the presence of stomach *qi*.
If the pulse is *excessively strong and smooth*, like sliding along a long pole, it is called *disease* (病).
Excessively strong and smooth means *too much* (太) prickliness.
Like sliding along a long pole means the pulse is long yet not soft.
This is the *prickly pulse*, and since stomach *qi* is diminished, it is a sign of illness.
If it is urgent and forceful, like a newly strung bowstring, it is called *death* (死).
Forceful, rigid, and excessively strong, like a tightly strung bowstring, this is a pulse of pure prickliness with no stomach *qi*, hence *death*.
A faintly prickly pulse is called *level*.
Faintly prickly means slightly resembling the prickly pulse, not faint while being prickly.
Faintly prickly is one part stomach *qi* and two parts prickly *qi*, both acting together to form a faintly prickly pulse.
If the prickly *qi* is dominant and stomach *qi* is diminished, it is a sign of illness.
If the pulse is purely prickly with no stomach *qi*, it is *death*.
Three parts of pure prickly *qi* with no stomach *qi* means the *true zàng* (藏) is exposed, hence *death*.
Spring relies on stomach *qi* as its foundation.
The *qi* of the Five *Zàng* (藏) must be harmonized with the stomach *qi*; if it acts alone, it will falter, just as an object too rigid cannot act alone—if it is harmonized and softened, it will become stable.
The stomach is the sea of water and grain, and humans receive *qi* from grain.
Grain enters the stomach, which then distributes it to the Five *Zàng* and Six *Fǔ* (府).
Thus, the liver relies on stomach *qi* as its foundation, and the remaining Four *Zàng* follow this principle similarly.

In summer, the pulse is *crooked* (钩), and if it reverses, it is a sign of illness.
What is meant by *reversal*?»

In summer, the pulse should be *crooked* (钩). If it opposes the *crooked* (钩) pulse—meaning if it is *real* (实) and *strong* (强)—this is called *excess* (太过), and the illness lies externally. A pulse that is *floating* (浮) and *dissipating* (大散) belongs to the heart. Now, if the pulse is *real* and *strong* in opposition, this is *excess* (太过), with external symptoms of flushed face, dry mouth, and frequent laughter.

If the pulse comes *empty* (虚) and *feeble* (微), this is called *deficiency* (不及), and the illness lies internally. In summer, the heart is weak while the lesser yin (少阴) of the kidneys flourishes; now, if the pulse is *empty* and *feeble* in opposition, this is *deficiency* (不及). The internal symptoms are restlessness of the heart, heartache, and heat in the palms—this is *death* (死).

When the pulse comes *stacked* (累累), like beads following one another, or *smoothly* (如循琅牙), it is called *level* (平). A *full* (满) and *flourishing* (盛) pulse, resembling a *pearl* (珠) in shape at the middle of the hand, is akin to the *pearl* (珠) pulse—thus called *heart level* (心平).

If the pulse comes *increasingly rapid* (益数), like a *hawk* (鹞) lifting its foot, it is called *illness* (病). The heart pulse should only be *floating* (浮) and *dissipating* (散), not *rapid* (数). Now, if the pulse is *rapid* like a hawk lifting its foot, this is called *heart illness* (心病).

If the pulse *bends forward* (前曲) and *lingers backward* (后居), like grasping a leather belt with a hook, it is called *death* (死). *Bending forward* (前曲) means the pulse is *crooked* (钩) and *weak* (无力). *Lingering backward* (后居) means it is *stiff* (倨) and *unmoving* (不动), *strained* (劲直), and *grasping* (操执)—like grasping a leather belt with a hook, hence *death* (死).

In summer, a *feeble* (微) yet *crooked* (钩) pulse is called *level* (平). The pulse is *feeble* but resembles *crookedness* (钩), not *feeble* while being *crooked*—it has *stomach qi* (胃气), hence called *level crooked pulse* (平豚). If the pulse is *excessively crooked* (钩多) with little *stomach qi* (胃气), it is called *illness* (病). The pulse is not *feeble* but *crooked*, indicating *stomach qi* is weak—thus it is *illness* (病). If the pulse is merely *crooked* (钩) with no *stomach qi* (胃气), it is called *death* (死). When three parts of the pulse are *crooked* (钩) and there is no *stomach qi* (胃气), the *true zàng* (藏) is exposed—this is *death* (死).

Summer relies on *stomach qi* (胃气) as its foundation, just like spring. The pulse of autumn should be *hair-like* (毛). If it opposes the *hair-like* (毛) pulse—meaning if it is *real* (实) and *strong* (强)—this is called *excess* (太过), and the illness lies externally. The autumn pulse should be *hair-like* (毛); now, if it becomes *real* and *strong* in opposition, this is *excess* (太过), with external symptoms of pale face, frequent sneezing, sadness, and reluctance to laugh or cry.

If the pulse comes *empty* (虚) and *feeble* (微), this is called *deficiency* (不及), and the illness lies internally. The lung pulse is *light* (轻) and *empty* (虚), *floating* (浮); now, if pressing it makes it *even more empty* (益虚微), this is a lack of *stomach qi* (胃气). The symptoms are wheezing, coughing, and *alcohol-induced* (酒淅) *shaking* (淅).

When the pulse comes *gentle* (蔼蔼), like the canopy of a small carriage, and pressing it makes it *larger* (益大), it is called *level* (平). The canopy of a small carriage is *light* (轻) and *floating* (浮), *gentle* (蔼蔼). Pressing it makes it *large* (大), indicating *stomach qi* (胃气) is present—hence called *level* (平).

If the pulse neither *rises* (上) nor *falls* (下), like following a *hawk’s feather* (鹞羽) in a *hesitant* (涩) manner, it is called *illness* (病). The lung, being *Metal* (金) and belonging to summer’s residual *yang* (阳), should have its pulse *ascend* (上). The lung’s *qi* (气) is of *yin* (阴) nature, so its pulse *descends* (下). Now, if the pulse neither ascends nor descends but follows the *hesitant* (涩) motion of a hawk’s feather, it is called *illness* (病).

If pressing it feels *dissipating* (消索), like *wind blowing hair* (风吹毛), it is called *death* (死). *Wind blowing hair* (风吹毛) describes a *floating* (飘腾) and *unstable* (不定) pulse, lacking a foundation. Now, if pressing the pulse feels like *dissipating* (消散) *threads* (索) and *wind blowing hair* (风吹毛), this is a pulse that is merely *hair-like* (毛) with no *stomach qi* (胃气)—hence *death* (死).

In autumn, a *feeble* (微) yet *hair-like* (毛) pulse is called *level* (平). The pulse is *feeble* (微) but resembles *hair-like* (毛), not *feeble* while being *hair-like*—it is a combination of one part *stomach qi* (胃气) and two parts *hair-like qi* (毛气) moving together, hence called *feeble hair-like pulse* (微毛). If the pulse is *excessively hair-like* (毛多) with little *stomach qi* (胃气), it is called *illness* (病). The pulse is not *feeble* but *hair-like*, indicating *stomach qi* is weak—thus it is *illness* (病). If the pulse is merely *hair-like* (毛) with no *stomach qi* (胃气), it is called *death* (死). When three parts of the pulse are *hair-like* (毛) and there is no *stomach qi* (胃气), the *true zàng* (藏) is exposed—this is *death* (死).

Autumn relies on *stomach qi* (胃气) as its foundation. All Five *Zàng* (藏) derive their *qi* (气) from the stomach; the stomach is the foundation of the Five *Zàng*. The *qi* of the *Zàng* (藏) cannot naturally reach the *hand taiyang* (手太阳), but must rely on *stomach qi* (胃气) to extend there. If *stomach qi* (胃气) cannot accompany it to the *hand taiyang* (手太阳), the *true zàng* (藏) *qi* (气) appears alone—this is when the *Zàng* illness overpowers the *stomach qi*, hence called *death* (死).

In winter, the pulse should be *stone-like* (石). If it opposes the *stone-like* (石) pulse—meaning if it is *superficial* (浮) and *hesitant* (涩)—this is called *yin* (阴) illness. Why is it called *reversal* (反)?

The winter pulse should be *deep* (沉) like a stone. If it opposes this *depth* (沉), meaning it is *superficial* (浮) and *hesitant* (涩), this is called *excess* (太过), and the illness lies externally. The winter pulse should be *gentle* (濡) and *hesitant* (涩); now, if it opposes and is *superficial* (浮) and *feeble* (虚), this is *deficiency* (不及), with symptoms of *inverted qi* (逆气), lower abdominal pain, *urgent diarrhea* (泄如下重), and coldness in the feet with *inverted* (逆) *qi*.

When the pulse comes *large above* (上大) and *small below* (下兑), *gentle* (濡) and *slippery* (滑) like a *sparrow’s beak* (雀之喙), it is called *level* (平). A *sparrow’s beak* (雀之喙) is a pulse that is *large* (大) upon arrival and *small* (兑) upon departure. The *large above* (上大) indicates the *foot taiyang* (足太阳) pulse arriving *large* (大). The *small below* (下兑) indicates the *foot shaoyin* (足少阴) pulse departing *small* (兑). When *yin* and *yang* are appropriately balanced, it signifies *stomach qi* (胃气) is strong—hence called *level* (平).

If the pulse comes *hesitant* (啄啄) and *connected* (连属), with a *slightly curved* (微曲) quality within, it is called *illness* (病). *Hesitant* (啄啄) means it does not flow smoothly, hence called *connected* (连属). If the pulse is *hesitant* (啄啄) and *slightly curved* (微曲) within, the *spleen pulse* (脾脉) overpowers the *kidney pulse* (肾病)—thus it is *illness* (病).

If the pulse arrives like *unwinding threads* (解索) and departs like *striking a stone* (弹石), it is called *death* (死). A pulse that arrives like *unwinding threads* (解索) is *empty* (虚) and *slow* (慢), lacking a foundation. A pulse that departs like *striking a stone* (弹石) is *rapid* (疾)—hence *death* (死).

In winter, a *feeble* (微) yet *stone-like* (石) pulse is called *level* (平). The pulse is *feeble* (微) but resembles *stone-like* (石), not *feeble* while being *stone-like*—it is a combination of one part *stomach qi* (胃气) and two parts *deep qi* (沉气) moving together, hence called *feeble stone-like pulse* (微石). If the pulse is *excessively stone-like* (石多) with little *stomach qi* (胃气), it is called *illness* (病). The pulse is not *feeble* but *stone-like*, indicating *stomach qi* is weak—thus it is *illness* (病). If the pulse is merely *stone-like* (石) with no *stomach qi* (胃气), it is called *death* (死). When three parts of the pulse are *stone-like* (石) and there is no *stomach qi* (胃气), the *true zàng* (藏) is exposed—this is *death* (死).

Winter relies on *stomach qi* (胃气) as its foundation, just like spring. The stomach is the sea of water and grain. It is fifteen *cùn* (寸) wide and twenty-six *cùn* (寸) long. When *flexed* (横屈), it holds three *dǒu* (斗) and five *shēng* (升) of water and grain, with two *dǒu* (斗) of grain and one *dǒu* (斗) and five *shēng* (升) of water remaining within. It governs the reception of the Four Seasons’ *qi* (气), hence all rely on *stomach qi* (胃气) as their foundation.

The Four Seasons—spring, summer, autumn, and winter—all draw upon *stomach qi* as their foundation. This is called the *variations of the seasons that bring illness*.

If in spring the *feeble pulse* (豚) is excessive while *stomach qi* is deficient, or in summer the *uneven pulse* (钧) is excessive while *stomach qi* is deficient, or in autumn the *hair-like pulse* (毛) is excessive while *stomach qi* is abundant, or in winter the *stone-like pulse* (石) is excessive while *stomach qi* is deficient—these are all the *variations of the seasons that bring illness*. This is the critical juncture of life and death.

When the *qi* of the Five *zàng* harmonizes with *stomach qi*, life ensues. If the *true zàng* is exposed, death follows.

All the critical junctures of life and death hinge upon the stomach.

The spleen is the central region. [Note: *Difficulties* recorded in the *Four Hard Cases*.] Its balanced state is imperceptible.

The spleen’s pulse, when balanced, governs the Four Seasons in concealment, hence it is imperceptible. Only when it declines does it become manifest.

When the spleen’s *jing* is weakened and fails, the *feeble pulse* (豚) takes form. It arrives like a sparrow’s pecking.

If the pulse is *large above and deficient below*, soft and slippery—this is the *sparrow’s beak pulse*, where the kidney’s *jing* overcomes the spleen’s *jing*, signifying *deficiency*.

If it moves intermittently, stopping and starting like a leaking roof—this is the *leaking-roof pulse*, where the kidney’s *jing* overwhelms the spleen’s *jing*, signifying *excess*.

Thus, when the spleen declines, the *feeble pulse* (豚) manifests as the *sparrow’s beak* or *leaking-roof* pulses.

**Volume Three of the *Yellow Emperor’s Eighty-One Difficult Cases*, Annotated and Illustrated with Commentaries by Lu Guo, Qin Yue Ren, and Fan Zi of Linchuan, with Additional Notes by Li Xian Zi and Ye Ju Sentence-by-Sentence Explanation**

**Difficulty #16:** The pulse has three regions and nine candidates. The three regions are the *cun*, *guan*, and *chi*. The nine candidates are three in the upper region, three in the middle, and three in the lower—thus nine in total. There are yin and yang. The *cun* position, where the yang pulse appears in nine divisions, is superficial. The *chi* region, where the yin pulse appears in one *cun*, is deep. There are degrees of lightness and heaviness. When the yang pulse is superficial, the hands feel light; when the yin pulse is deep, the hands feel heavy. There are sixty methods. The pulse begins with six methods—whether floating, long, short, smooth, or rough—across the three yin and three yang regions. Now, these sixty methods are combined into sixty. One pulse changes with the four seasons. The pulse follows the transformations of the four seasons; see the ten variations of one pulse in Difficulty #10. The sages are distant. In the time of Qin Yue Ren, the sages were long gone. Each follows their own methods—how then can they be distinguished? It is said that the three regions are one method, the nine candidates are one method, yin and yang are one method, lightness and heaviness are one method, and the sixty methods are one method. Since the methods and symbols are numerous, the difficulties can be distinguished.

Now: Observe the patient’s inner and outer symptoms. If one examines the clarity of their complexion and the five colors, one can immediately know the inner and outer symptoms. Formerly, this character was mistakenly taken as a different word and changed to *shì* (视). How does the disease manifest? How does the disease present itself?

---

When examining the **Liver pulse**, the Liver *qi* is taut yet soft and long.
In its **external symptoms**, the patient’s complexion is clear and clean.
The **Liver** governs the **Gallbladder** (*dǎn*), the repository of cold purity, hence the patient is fond of cleanliness.
Their face is green, for the Liver’s color is green, thus the face appears green.
They are prone to anger, as the **Gallbladder** is the organ of rectitude, overseeing judgment, and the Liver in the emotions manifests as anger.

In its **internal symptoms**, there is a moving *qi* to the left of the navel (*qì*), which, when pressed, feels firm and painful.
Liver accumulation is called *féi qì*, located to the left of the navel, and when palpated, it is firm and painful.
The patient’s limbs feel full and constricted.
The **Liver (Wood)** and **Spleen (Earth)**—the Spleen governs the limbs; if it is not diseased, Earth fears nothing, thus the limbs are full and constricted.

There is **twitching of the genitals** (*yǐn sōu*).
The Liver *qi* courses through the **yin organ**, causing **twitching** (*cèng bō*) and **straining urination** (*xiǎo biàn sè*).
The patient has **difficult defecation** (*biàn nán*).
The **Liver** and **Kidney** reside in the lower abdomen (*xià pì*), and when the Liver is diseased, *qi* reverses, failing to descend, thus causing **constipation** (*dà biàn jiān nán*).
There is **spasmodic cramping** (*zhuǎn jīn*).
The Liver nourishes the sinews with blood; when the Liver is diseased, the sinews **spasm** (*jīn zhuǎn*).
If these symptoms are present, it is **Liver disease**.
If these symptoms are absent, it is not **Liver disease**.

When examining the **Heart pulse**, the Heart *qi* is floating, expansive, and dispersed.
In its **external symptoms**, the patient’s face is red, for the Heart’s color is red, thus the face appears red.
Their mouth is dry, as the Heart’s pulse network lies beneath the tongue; when the Heart is oppressed by heat, the mouth becomes dry and parched.
They are fond of laughter, for the Heart in sound manifests as laughter.

In its **internal symptoms**, there is a moving *qi* above the navel (*qì*), which, when pressed, feels firm and painful.
Heart accumulation is called *fù liáng*, located above the navel, and when palpated, it is firm and painful.
The patient experiences **heartache and vexation**, with **palms hot and throat dry**.
The Heart is the sovereign of the five *zàng* organs; when the four other organs are diseased, the Heart knows it—but if there is pain in the Heart itself, how much more so when the primary disease afflicts it!
**Constant pain** is **Heart Enclosure** (*xīn bāo yōng*).
The Heart itself does not receive disease, but if it does, then **morning diagnosis leads to evening death**, or **evening diagnosis leads to morning death**—this is **Enclosure** (*bāo yōng*), a disease of the **Heart Enclosure** (*xīn bāo*), which is the pulse network of the **Hand Lesser Yin** (*shǒu yǎn yīn*), emerging from the tip of the middle fingers, descending into the palm, and flexed to locate at the **Labor Official** (*Láo Guān*) acupuncture point.
When the Heart Enclosure is diseased, the palms feel hot and **moist** (*wǎn*).
If these symptoms are present, it is **Heart disease**.
If these symptoms are absent, it is not **Heart disease**.

When examining the **Spleen pulse**, the Spleen *qi* is moderate yet expansive.
In its **external symptoms**, the patient’s face is yellow, for the Spleen’s color is yellow, thus the face appears yellow.
They are prone to **sighing** (*yì*), as the Spleen in transformation manifests as sighing.
They are fond of **sweet flavors**, for the Spleen governs sweetness, and sweetness is what they crave.
In its **internal symptoms**, there is a moving *qi* at the navel (*qì*), which, when pressed, feels firm and painful.
Spleen accumulation is called *pǐ qì*, located at the navel, and when palpated, it is firm and painful.
The patient experiences **abdominal distension and indigestion**, with **food failing to digest**.
When **dampness** (*shī qì*) prevails, it causes **distension** (*péng zhàng*), and since **yang** *qi* is in the lower abdomen, digestion is impaired.

They have **heaviness in the body and joint pain**.
Their **spirit is sluggish**, and they **favor excessive sleep**.
Their limbs **fail to contract** (*sì zhī quán wú shōu shí*).
If these symptoms are present, it is **Spleen disease**.
If these symptoms are absent, it is not **Spleen disease**.

When examining the **Lung pulse**, the Lung *qi* is floating, absolute, and short.
In its **external symptoms**, the patient’s face is white, for the Lung’s color is white, thus the face appears white.
They are prone to **sneezing** (*shàn tì*), as the nose is the pathway of pure *qi*, belonging to the Lung; when the Lung is affected by **wind-cold**, it passes through the nose, causing **sneezing**.
They are **melancholic and discontent**, for **sorrow** is the Lung’s emotional manifestation.

The Lung governs **Autumn** (*qīu*), its season of **melancholy** (*chóu*).
The Spleen is Earth, the Lung is Metal; the Spleen is the **mother** of the Lung.
The Spleen governs **laughter** (*gē*), and when a child is ill, the mother mourns—
thus in Autumn, **melancholy** prevails, and there is no joy.

They **desire to weep**.
If **there is sound**, it is weeping.
In its **internal symptoms**, the right side of the abdomen (*qí yòu*) has **moving qi** (*dòng qì*).
Pressing it reveals a **firm, painful sensation** (*lǎo ruò tòng*).
This **accumulation** (*jī*) in the Lung is called **"Breathing Noble"** (*xī guì*), located to the right of the navel (*qí*).
When palpated, it feels **fixed and painful**.

Their disease manifests as **shortness of breath and coughing** (*chuǎn kè*).
The Lung is the **"Five Zàng's canopy"** (*wǔ zàng huá gài*), most fond of **purity and cold** (*qīng lěng*).
When the Lung is struck by **wind-cold**, the **pathway of qi** becomes **constricted** (*sè*), causing **rapid breathing and hacking coughs** (*chuǎn jí kè sòu*).
They experience **shivering and alternating cold and heat** (*sǎ xiāo hán rè*).
When the Lung is **empty**, they shiver with cold; when **full**, they feel heat and **restlessness** (*wèn*).

If these symptoms are present, it is the Lung.
If these symptoms are present, it is a **Lung pattern**.
If these symptoms are absent, it is not.
If these symptoms are absent, it is not a **Lung pattern**.

Now, if one examines the **Kidney pulse** (*shèn mài*).
The Kidney pulse is **deep, short, and firm** (*chén duǎn yǐ dùn*).
In its **external symptoms**, the face is black.
The Kidney’s color is black, hence the face appears black.
They are prone to **fear** (*kǒng*).
The Kidney’s emotional manifestation is **fear**.

They **yawn** (*qiàn*).
When the **Root of the Great Yang** (*Jùyáng*) is empty, they yawn.
In its **internal symptoms**, the lower abdomen (*qí xià*) has **moving qi**.
Pressing it reveals a **firm, half-painful sensation** (*bàn tòng*).
This **accumulation** in the Kidney is called **"Galloping Noble"** (*bēn tún*), located beneath the navel (*qí*).
When palpated, it feels **firm with half-pain**.

Their disease is **inverted qi** (*nì qì*).
When Kidney *qi* is insufficient, it harms the **Conception Vessel** (*chōng mài*), causing **inverted qi**.
The lower abdomen is **urgently painful** (*shǎo fù jí tòng*).
The pulse of **Foot Lesser Yin** (*zú shào yīn*) runs through the lower abdomen,
and with **Foot Jue Yin** and **Foot Greater Yin**, the three Yin pulses converge beneath the navel (*qí*).
Now, since the Kidney is diseased, the lower abdomen aches.

They **leak like a downward burden** (*xiè rú xià zhòng*).
This is the **pattern of "Leaking"** (*wáng xiè*), also called **"Leaking at the Cubit"** (*chǐ xīn xiè*).
It involves **urgent straining and heaviness after defecation** (*guǒ jí hòu zhòng*), frequently reaching the **rectum** (*yòu*) yet unable to pass,
with **pain in the urethral region** (*jīng zhōng tòng*).
The **inner leg** experiences cold and **inverted pulse** (*zú nèi huái shàng wǔ cùn*).
Five inches above the inner ankle is the **moving pulse of Foot Lesser Yin** (*zú shào yīn*), hence the inner leg feels cold and **inverted pulse**.

If these symptoms are present, it is the Kidney.
If these symptoms are present, it is a **Kidney pattern**.
If these symptoms are absent, it is not.
If these symptoms are absent, it is not a **Kidney pattern**.

The **Seventeenth Difficulty** states:
*"The classics say: Some diseases bring death.
Some illnesses result in death.
Some diseases heal without treatment.
Some illnesses, though untreated, spontaneously resolve and stabilize.
Some persist for years without end.
Some illnesses drag on year after year, never ceasing.
But can one determine life, death, survival, or extinction by simply cutting the pulse?*
Life, death, survival, or extinction—can one know them by cutting the pulse?
Yet:
*One can fully comprehend them.*
Life, death, survival, or extinction are all known through the pulse.

If diagnosing a disease, one finds:
**The eyes do not wish to see others** (*mù bù yù jiàn rén*).
When examining an illness, if the patient **closes their eyes and dislikes seeing others**,
this is a **Liver pattern**.
The pulse should be **Liver pulse—strong, urgent, and long** (*jiāng mài qiáng jí ér cháng*).
The **root pulse of the Liver** (*Jīn*) is **firm, soft, and long** (*shèn ruǎn ér cháng*).
Now, if the pulse is **strong and urgent**, this disease is present.
But if one instead finds **Lung pulse—floating, short, and rough** (*fú duǎn ér sè*), death is certain.
A Liver disease presenting with Lung pulse means **true spirit** (*zhen guǐ*) is **cloaked by false** (*kè*), and Metal overcomes Wood, hence death is inevitable.

If diagnosing a disease, one finds:
**The eyes are open but thirsty**, with **abdominal tightness** (*xīn xià lǎo*).
A Heart disease pattern presents with **open eyes and thirst**,
and **abdominal tightness** (*xīn xià lǎo gù bù kāi*).
The pulse should be **tight, firm, and rapid** (*jǐn shí ér shù*).
Since there is a Heart disease, there should be a **Heart pulse** (*xīn mài*), which is tight, firm, and rapid.
But if one instead finds **deep, sluggish, and faint pulse** (*chén rú ér wēi*), death is certain.
A Heart disease presenting with Kidney pulse means **Water comes to subdue Fire** (*shuǐ lái kè huǒ*), and a Yang disease reveals **Yin pulse** (*yín mài*), hence death is inevitable.

If diagnosing a disease, one finds:
**Blood is vomited**.
Blood is spat from the mouth.
**Nasal discharge** (*qiàn*) and **clear nasal mucus** (*niǔ*) are also present.
All the above belong to **Lung disease**.
The pulse should be **deep and fine** (*chén xì*).

---

**Blood belongs to Yin**; if **blood is vomited** (*tǔ xuè*) or **nasal discharge** (*qiàn*) occurs, the pulse should be **deep and fine** (*chén xì*), which aligns with the disease pulse.
But if instead it is **floating, large, and firm** (*fú dà ér lǎo*), death is certain.
If one does not find a **Lung pulse** (*fèi mài*) but instead detects a **floating, large, and firm Heart pulse** (*xīn mài*), the disease and pulse are contradictory—**Fire comes to subdue Metal** (*huǒ lái kè jīn*)—hence death is inevitable.

If diagnosing a disease, one finds:
**Delirious speech** (*zhān yán*) and **erratic speech** (*wàng yǔ*).
**Delirious speech** refers to **incoherent murmuring** (*ní bō ér yǔ*).
**Erratic speech** means **speech without rhyme or reason** (*yán yǔ zài wàng*).
The body should have **heat**.
Heat accumulating in the Heart causes **disordered speech**, and the body should exhibit **heat**.
The pulse should be **surging and large** (*hóng dà*).
If the body is hot and the pulse is large, the pulse and disease correspond.
But if instead **limbs contract in reverse** (*shǒu zú jué nì*) and the pulse becomes **hostile and fine** (*chǒu zàn ér wēi*), death is certain.
If the body should be hot but instead **limbs are cold and withdrawn** (*shǒu zú yàn líng*), and the pulse should be **surging and large** but is instead **hostile and fine**, this is a **Yang pulse presenting as Yin** (*yáng mài jiàn yīn mài*), with the pulse and disease contradictory—hence death is inevitable.

If diagnosing a disease, one finds:
**A distended abdomen with diarrhea** (*dà fù ér xiè*).
If **Dampness qi** (*shī qì*) prevails, **abdominal distension** (*zhàng*) occurs; if the Spleen cannot restrain, **diarrhea** (*xiè*) follows.
The pulse should be **fine and rough** (*wēi xì ér sè*).
Since there is a **Spleen condition** (*pí zhèng*), this pulse should appear.
But if instead it is **tight, large, and slippery** (*jǐn dà ér huá*), death is certain.
If one does not find a **Spleen pulse** (*pí mài*) but instead detects a **tight, large, and slippery Liver pulse** (*gān mài*), **Liver Wood subdues Spleen Earth** (*gān mù kè pí tǔ*), with the disease and pulse contradictory—hence death is inevitable.

The **Eighteen Difficulties** (*Shíbā Nán*) state:
**The pulse has three regions** (*mài yǒu sān bù*).

「Thus, death is certain.

If the body should be hot but instead the hands and feet feel aversion to warmth, if the pulse should be **tight and large** (*hóng dà*) but instead appears **fine and weak** (*xiàng xì*), this is **Yang pulse** (*yáng mài*) encountering **Yin pulse** (*yìn mài*), where the pulse and disease are contradictory—hence death is inevitable.

If the disease presents as **abdominal distension with diarrhea** (*dà fù ér xiè*), then:

**Dampness qi** (*shī qì*) prevails, causing **abdominal distension** (*zhàng*); if the Spleen cannot restrain, **diarrhea** (*xiè*) follows.

The pulse should be **fine and rough** (*wēi xì ér sè*).
Since there is a **Spleen condition** (*pí zhèng*), this pulse should appear.
But if instead it is **tight, large, and slippery** (*jǐn dà ér huá*), death is certain.
If one does not find a **Spleen pulse** (*pí mài*) but instead detects a **tight, large, and slippery Liver pulse** (*gān mài*), **Liver Wood subdues Spleen Earth** (*gān mù kè pí tǔ*), with the disease and pulse contradictory—hence death is inevitable.

The **Eighteen Difficulties** (*Shíbā Nán*) state:
**The pulse has three regions** (*mài yǒu sān bù*).

---

**The three regions—cubit, guan, and inch—constitute the pulse’s three divisions.**
Each division encompasses **four channels** (*jīng*).
Within each division, there are **two channels** (*èr jīng*), so across the six divisions, there are **twelve channels** (*shí'èr jīng*) in total.
Yet here it mentions only **four channels**, referring specifically to:
**Hand Greater Yang** (*shǒu Tàiyáng*), **Hand Yang Brightness** (*Yángmíng*), **Foot Greater Yang** (*zú Tàiyáng*), and **Foot Lesser Yin** (*shǎo yīn*).
These two channels follow the **nature of Water and Fire** (*shuǐ huǒ zhī xìng*), each having its own **principles and order** (*gāngjì*), yet unable to **mutually transform and ascend or descend** (*biàn tōng shàng xià*).
The remaining **eight channels**—those of the **Hand** that generate in the **Foot**, and those of the **Foot** that generate in the **Hand**—are what the classics mean when stating that each division contains **four channels**.

**Hand Lesser Yin** (*shǒu Tàiyīn*)—**Lung** (*fèi*)—and **Hand Yang Brightness** (*Yángmíng*)—**Large Intestine** (*dà cháng*)—are of the **Metal** (*jīn*) category.
These two channels belong to the **Lung** and **Large Intestine**, thus classified as **Metal**.
**Foot Lesser Yin** (*zú shǎo yīn*)—**Kidney** (*shèn*)—and **Foot Greater Yang** (*zú Tàiyáng*)—**Bladder** (*pángguāng*)—are of the **Water** (*shuǐ*) category.
These two channels are the **Kidney** and **Bladder**, belonging to **Water**.
**Metal generates Water** (*jīn shēng shuǐ*).
**Lung Metal** (*fèi jīn*) resides above, while **Kidney Water** (*shèn shuǐ*) below is generated by it.
Water flows downward and cannot ascend—thus, it is classified as the **lower division**.
Water has no tendency but to descend; its nature is to flow downward, and if it ascends, it is therefore in the **lower division**.

**Foot Jue Yin** (*zú jué yīn*)—**Liver** (*gān*)—and **Foot Shao Yang** (*shǎo yáng*)—**Gallbladder** (*dǎn*)—are of the **Wood** (*mù*) category.
These two channels are the **Liver** and **Gallbladder**, belonging to **Wood**.
They generate **Hand Greater Yang** (*shǒu Tàiyáng*)—**Heart** (*xīn*)—and **Hand Lesser Yin** (*shǒu shǎo yīn*)—**Small Intestine** (*xiǎo cháng*)—of the **Fire** (*huǒ*) category.
These two channels are the **Heart** and **Small Intestine**, belonging to **Fire**, generated by **Liver Wood**.
Fire ascends and cannot descend—thus, it is classified as the **upper division**.
Fire’s nature is to ascend upward; it cannot descend to generate in the **Foot**, but instead generates **Hand Pericardium** (*xīn bāo luò*)—**Shao Yang Fire** (*shǎo yáng huǒ*), which is the **Fire of the Right Cubit** (*yòu chǐ xiàng huǒ*)—hence, it is in the **upper division**.

**Hand Pericardium** (*shǒu xīn bāo luò*) and **Hand Shao Yang** (*shǒu shǎo yáng*)—both **Fire** (*huǒ*)—
The **Heart** (*xīn*) is the **Sovereign Fire** (*jūn huǒ*), while this is the **Ministerial Fire** (*xiàng huǒ*).
Now, these two channels are the **Pericardium** (*xīn bāo luò*) and **Triple Burner** (*sān jiāo*).
They generate **Foot Lesser Yin** (*zú shǎo yīn*)—**Spleen** (*pí*)—and **Foot Yang Brightness** (*zú Yángmíng*)—**Stomach** (*wèi*)—of the **Earth** (*tǔ*) category.
These two channels are the **Spleen** and **Stomach**, belonging to **Earth**, generated by **Ministerial Fire**.
Thus, they are in the **middle division**.
Earth governs the **Middle Palace** (*zhōng gōng*), hence it is in the **middle division**.
All these are examples of the **Five Phases** (*wǔ xíng*) **parent-child mutual generation and nourishment** (*zǐ mǔ gēng xiāng shēng yǎng*).

To the right: **Cubit Metal** (*jǐn jīn*) generates **Left Inch Water** (*zuǒ cuì shuǐ), Water** generates **Left Guan Wood** (*zuǒ guān mù*), Wood generates **Left Cubit Sovereign Fire** (*zuǒ jǐn jūn huǒ*), Sovereign Fire generates **Right Inch Ministerial Fire** (*yòu cuì xiàng huǒ*), Ministerial Fire generates **Right Guan Earth** (*yòu guān tǔ*)—thus it is said that **parent-child generation** (*zǐ mǔ xiāng shēng*) occurs in the pulse.

**The pulse has three divisions and nine manifestations** (*mài yǒu sān bù jiǔ hòu*), each governing what?
**The pulse has three divisions and nine manifestations** (*mài yǒu sān bù jiǔ hòu*), each belonging to which **Zang-Fu** (*zàng fǔ*)?

Indeed:
The **three divisions** (*sān bù*) are the **cubit, guan, and inch** (*cùn guān chǐ*).
**Cubit division** (*cùn kǒu*), **Yang** (*yáng*); **Guan division** (*guān bù*), **Yin-Yang balance** (*yīn yáng zhī zhōng*); **Inch division** (*chǐ bù*), **Yin** (*yīn*).
The **nine manifestations** (*jiǔ hòu*) are **superficial, middle, and deep** (*fú zhōng shēn*).
Within each of the three divisions, there are **three manifestations** (*sān hòu*), making nine in total—hence it is said that there are **nine manifestations**.

**Superficial** (*fú*) is **Yang** (*yáng*), **deep** (*shēn*) is **Yin** (*yīn*), and **middle** (*zhōng*) is **Stomach qi** (*wèi qì*).
**Superficial** is the **Fu organs** (*fǔ*), **deep** is the **Zang organs** (*zàng*), and **middle** is the pulse of the **Middle Burner** (*zhōng jiāo*).

The **upper division** (*shàng bù*) follows **Heaven** (*tiān*), governing diseases from the **chest upward to the head** (*xiōng yǐshàng zhì tóu*).
The **upper division** is both **hand cubit pulses** (*liǎng shǒu cùn kǒu*), which govern **Heaven’s** presence above.
**Cubit exterior** (*cùn wài*) governs the **head** (*tóu*), **cubit interior** (*cùn nèi*) governs the **chest** (*xiōng*).

The **middle division** (*zhōng bù*) follows **Humanity** (*rén*), governing diseases from the **diaphragm downward to above the navel** (*gé xià zhì qí shàng*).
The **middle division** is the **second finger of both hands’ guan pulses** (*liǎng shǒu guān bù dì èr zhǐ*).
**Half-finger prior** (*bàn zhǐ yǐqián*) governs the **diaphragm below** (*gé xià*), **half-finger posterior** (*bàn zhǐ yǐhòu*) governs **above the navel** (*qí shàng*).

The **lower division** (*xià bù*) follows **Earth** (*dì*), governing diseases from the **navel downward to the feet** (*qí yǐxià zhì zú*).
The **lower division** is the **inch pulse of both hands** (*liǎng shǒu chǐ mài*) and the **third finger** (*dì sān zhǐ*).
**Half-finger prior** governs **below the navel** (*qí xià*), **half-finger posterior** governs the **feet** (*zú*).

This is the method of **examining and ordering** (*shěn chà*) the pulse from **head to foot** (*cóng tóu zhì zú zhī cìshì*).」

Though the original *Yuanwen* text by Zhi (元文刺字) is now superseded by the Shaanxi *Ding* school’s teachings, the following remains:

If a person suffers from **stagnant, long-standing accumulations**, can one discern this through pulse examination?
*—Asking whether stagnant, chronic accumulations can be known through the pulse.*

**Answer:** When examining the right flank, one finds **accumulated qi**.
*—When diagnosing an accumulation disease, if the illness manifests in the right flank, one finds the lung pulse knotted.*

The knotted pulse governs **concrete accumulations**, and since the lung is housed in the right side, a knotted pulse in the lung channel means there is an accumulation in the right flank. The more knotted the pulse, the more severe the accumulation. If the lung channel’s pulse is excessively knotted, the right flank’s accumulation is likewise severe.

If the pulse is **slightly knotted**, the accumulation is slight.
*—If the lung channel’s pulse is not excessively knotted, the right flank’s accumulated qi is likewise mild.*

If no lung pulse is found, yet there is accumulated qi in the right flank—how so?
*—Asking: Though the lung is housed in the right side, and there is an accumulation in the right flank, why is there no knotted pulse in the lung channel?*

**Answer:** Though the lung pulse may not be visibly knotted, the right-hand pulse will be **depressed and submerged**.
*—Even if no knotted pulse appears in the lung channel, if the right-hand pulse is depressed and submerged, it indicates accumulated qi in the right flank.*

A **submerged pulse** (*fù mài*) conceals internal disease accumulations;
A **floating-knotted pulse** (*fú jié*) reveals external organ diseases.

Does the same method apply to external **painful lumps**? Or does it differ?
*—Asking whether the diagnostic method for external stagnant lumps differs from that of right-flank accumulations.*

**Answer:**
A **knotted pulse** (*jié mài*) arrives and departs with intermittent pauses, lacking regularity—this is called *knotted*.
*—A knotted pulse arrives slowly, pausing intermittently without fixed rhythm, hence ‘knotted.’*

A **submerged pulse** (*fù mài*) travels beneath the tendons.
*—A submerged pulse runs deep beneath the tendons, requiring extreme pressure against the bone to detect.*

A **floating pulse** (*fú mài*) travels along the surface of the flesh.
*—A floating pulse moves superficially over the flesh, feeling insufficient upon pressing, yet excessive when lifted.*

The same applies to both left and right sides.
*—The same principles govern left and right flanks.*
Left and right refer to the **left and right flanks**; examining the **external** (*biǎo*) reveals organ diseases, while examining the **internal** (*qiào*) reveals visceral diseases. The methods are consistent as described.

If a pulse is **knotted and submerged**, yet there is no internal accumulation—
*—Though the pulse is knotted and submerged, if there is no internal accumulation, this is a case where the pulse does not correspond to the disease—**a death sentence.***

If a pulse is **floating and knotted**, yet there is no external lump—
*—Though the pulse is floating and knotted, if there is no external stagnant lump, this too is a case where the pulse does not correspond to the disease—**a death sentence.***

If there is an accumulation, yet the pulse is neither knotted nor submerged—
*—If there is an accumulation disease but the pulse is neither knotted nor submerged, this is a case where the pulse does not correspond to the disease—**a death sentence.***

If there is a painful lump, yet the pulse is neither floating nor knotted—
*—If there is a stagnant lump disease but the pulse is neither floating nor knotted, this too is a case where the pulse does not correspond to the disease—**a death sentence.***

Thus, **pulse and disease must correspond**; any discrepancy is **a death sentence**.

---
**The Nineteen Difficulties** say:
The classics state that pulses have **inversion and conformity**.
*—The pulses of men and women exhibit inversion and conformity.*

What does **inversion and conformity** mean? How does **yang embracing yin** or **yin embracing yang** apply?
*—Men and women have their usual pulses, yet sometimes they invert. How so?*

**Answer:**
Men are born in the **Tiger hour (寅)**, the hour of **Wood**, which is **yang**.
*—The original qi arises at the **Rat hour (子)**, the hour of birth. For men, counting thirty cycles from the Rat hour leftward to the Tiger hour (寅) takes ten months—thus, men are born in the tenth month. The Tiger hour belongs to the **eastern Wood direction (甲乙木)**, which is yang.*

Women are born in the **Applicability hour (申)**, the hour of **Metal**, which is **yin**.
*—For women, counting thirty cycles from the Rat hour rightward to the Applicability hour (申) also takes ten months—thus, women are born in the tenth month. The Applicability hour belongs to the **western Metal direction (庚辛金)**, which is yin.*

Thus, **men’s pulses are found above the *guan* (关)**.
*—The region above the *guan* is the *cun* (寸) pulse, which belongs to yang. Since men’s yang qi is abundant, their pulses are typically strong at the *cun* position.*

Women’s pulses are found **below the *guan***.
*—The region below the *guan* is the *chi* (尺) pulse, which belongs to yin. Since women’s yin qi is abundant, their pulses are typically strong at the *chi* position.*

Thus, **men’s *chi* pulses are always weak**.
*—Men’s qi originates in *Shao Yang* (少阳) and peaks in *Tai Yang* (太阳). When *Shao Yang* arrives, the pulse is alternately large and small, short and long—this corresponds to the *Yijing* **Gùn (履) hexagram**, where one yang resides in the *chi* position. When *Yang Ming* (阳明) arrives, the pulse is floating, large, and short—this corresponds to the *Yijing* **Lín (临) hexagram**, where two yangs reside in the *guan* position. When *Tai Yang* arrives, the pulse is robust and long—this corresponds to the *Yijing* **Tài (泰) hexagram**, where three yangs reside in the *cun* position. Since the three yangs rise from Earth, men’s pulses are strong at the *cun* and weak at the *chi*.*

Women’s *chi* pulses are always strong.
*—Women’s qi originates in *Tai Yin* (太阴) and peaks in *Jué Yin* (厥阴). When *Tai Yin* arrives, the pulse is taut, large, and long—this corresponds to the *Yijing* **Gòu (姤) hexagram**, where one yin resides in the *cun* position. When *Shao Yin* (少阴) arrives, the pulse is taut, fine, and subtle—this corresponds to the *Yijing* **Dùn (遁) hexagram**, where two yins reside in the *guan* position. When *Jué Yin* arrives, the pulse is submerged, short, and firm—this corresponds to the *Yijing* **Pǐ (否) hexagram**, where three yins reside in the *chi* position. Since the three yins descend from Heaven, women’s pulses are submerged at the *cun* and strong at the *chi*.*

**Inversion** occurs when a man exhibits a woman’s pulse or a woman exhibits a man’s.
*—If a man’s *chi* pulse, which is usually weak, becomes strong, or if a woman’s *chi* pulse, which is usually strong, becomes weak—what does this indicate?*

**Answer:**
If a man exhibits a woman’s pulse, it signifies **deficiency**, and the disease lies **internally**.
*—The *cun* pulse is the ‘day yang’ (*rì yáng*). Since men’s physiology relies on yang, if the yang pulse is not found in the *cun* but instead appears in the *chi*—where women’s pulses are typically strong—this indicates insufficiency. Since yin governs the internal, the disease is internal.*

---

If the pulse is found on the **left**, the disease lies on the **left**.
*—When the left hand exhibits a woman’s pulse as strong, the disease will be on the body’s left side.*
If the pulse is found on the **right**, the disease lies on the **right**.
*—When the right hand exhibits a woman’s pulse as strong, the disease will be on the body’s right side.*
**The pulse determines the location of the disease.**
*—The disease manifests where the abnormal pulse is detected.*

If a woman exhibits a man’s pulse, it signifies **excess**.
*—The *chi* pulse in women is naturally floating; if it further appears in the *cun*—where men’s pulses are typically strong—this is called **excess**.*
Moreover, since women’s physiology relies on **yin**, their *cun* pulse is usually moderate. If instead a floating pulse is detected,
*—the disease lies in the four limbs.*
The four limbs are the origin of all **yang**; when a woman exhibits a man’s pulse, it indicates **yang qi** is excessive, hence the disease is in the four limbs.

If the pulse is found on the **left**,
*—when the left hand exhibits a man’s pulse, the disease will be on the left hand and foot.*
if the pulse is found on the **right**,
*—when the right hand exhibits a man’s pulse, the disease will be on the right hand and foot.*
**the pulse determines the location of the disease!**

**Twenty Difficulties** state:
The Classics say pulses have **latency**.
*—Pulses may be hidden or concealed.*
Where are they concealed, and how can one speak of **latency**?
*—In which channel or organ does the pulse hide, allowing one to diagnose **latency**?*
**Answer:**
It refers to **yin** and **yang** **mutually counteracting**—**mutually concealing** each other.
*—The *cun* is not solely **yang**, nor the *chi* solely **yin**; even the upper muscles are **yang**, and the lower muscles are **yin**. Sometimes **yang** pulses invade **yin** positions, or **yin** pulses invade **yang** positions, or **yang** pulses conceal **yin**, or **yin** pulses conceal **yang**.*

When a pulse resides in a **yin** position but **yang** characteristics appear,
*—this is called **yang counteracting yin**.*
the inner *chi* (below the muscles) is **yin**—if the pulse there is floating, slippery, and long,
*—it indicates **yin** showing **yang** characteristics; when **yin** is deficient and **yang** invades, it is called **yang covering** or **yang counteracting yin**.*
even if the pulse is **#19 deep, slow, and short**,
*—this is called **yang concealing yin**.*
if the *chi* pulse is already floating, slippery, and long, but the *cun* (and *guan*) is moderate, short, and slow,
*—this is **yang concealing yin**.*

When a pulse resides in a **yang** position but **yin** characteristics appear,
*—this is called **yin counteracting yang**.*
the *cun* and upper muscles are **yang**—if instead a **#20 deep, short, and slow** **yin** pulse is detected,
*—it is **yin** invading **yang** positions, or **yin overflowing**.*
even if the pulse is sometimes floating, slippery, and long,
*—this is called **yin concealing yang**.*
if the *cun* and *guan* pulse is moderate, slow, and short, but the *chi* pulse is floating, slippery, and long,
*—this is **yin concealing yang**.*

**Double yang** manifests as **mania**.
*—When the pulse is floating, slippery, and long, and further exhibits **fullness and rapidity**—this is called **double yang**—hence the patient raves about grand matters, boasts of their own virtues, acts wildly, and climbs heights in disarray.*
**Double yin** manifests as **epilepsy**.
*—When the *chi* pulse is moderate, short, and slow, and further exhibits **fullness and excess**—this is called **double yin**—hence the patient stiffens and collapses to the ground, closes their eyes without waking, and only regains consciousness after **yin** has exhausted and **yang** returns. This is named **epilepsy**.*

**Yang loss** causes **phantom visions**.
*—**Yang loss** means absence of **yang qi**; when the *cun* pulse is extremely fine and weak, the patient may falsely see apparitions as if encountering ghosts.*
**Yin loss** causes **blindness**.
*—**Yin** is the **essence-qi**; when **yin qi** is lost, the five **zang** organs’ **qi** no longer nourishes the eyes, resulting in blindness. If the *chi* pulse is extremely fine and weak...*

**Twenty-One Difficulties** state:
The Classics say that when a person’s **form** is diseased but their pulse is not,
*—it is called **life**.*
**Form** being diseased means the body is emaciated, and the hands and feet are numb;
*—the pulse, however, does not exhibit disease—it rises and falls with breathing, without excessive deviation or irregularity. This is diagnosed as **life**.*
When the pulse is diseased but the **form** is not,
*—it is called **death**.*
If the pulse is diseased while the **form** is still undiseased,
*—even if the person does not yet suffer from colds, fevers, or other illnesses, they will die regardless.*

**What is meant by this?**
*—How does the distinction between **life** and **death** arise?*
**Answer:**
When a person’s **form** is diseased but their pulse is not,
*—it is not that the pulse is truly undiseased.*
Though the body may show signs of illness or pain, the pulse does not yet exhibit abnormal rhythms—this is not because the pulse is undiseased,
*—but because the pulse’s rhythm does not yet correspond to the severity of the form’s illness.*
This is the **great principle**.
*—The pulse is the movement of **blood**; breathing is the movement of **qi**. The pulse does not move on its own but is driven by **qi**; when the rhythm of **qi**’s breathing does not align with the pulse’s rhythm, this is the reason.*

**Twenty-Two Difficulties** state:
The Classics say the pulse has **abnormal movement**.
*—There are pulses that deviate from their usual rhythm,*
**which give rise to disease.**
*—abnormal movement is the source of disease.*
If one pulse becomes two diseases,
*—how does this occur?*
**How does the pulse’s abnormal movement transform into two types of disease—those of **blood** and **qi**?**
**Answer:**
The Classics refer to **abnormal movement** as **qi**.
*—**Qi** is **yang**; **yang** governs the **defensive-qi** (*wèi*). When **evil** invades **yang**, **qi** first receives **heat**, manifesting in the pulse as **abnormal movement**.*
The disease it generates is **blood**.
*—When **qi** is diseased, it transmits to **blood**; **blood** is **yin**; **yin** governs the **nutritive-qi** (*yíng*). When **blood** stagnates and fails to nourish, disease arises later.*

When **evil** is in **qi**,
*—**yang** is **qi**; when **evil** invades **yang**, **qi** moves abnormally in the pulse.*
**abnormal movement** is **qi**.
When **evil** is in **blood**,
*—**blood** is the disease that arises.*
**qi** is diseased, transmitting to **blood**; **blood** stagnates and fails to flow, giving rise to disease.

**Qi** governs **tightness**.
*—**Tightness** (*jū*) refers to the pulse’s **floating-slippery** rhythm, as **qi** flows without obstruction.*
**Blood** governs **moistening**.
*—**Moistening** (*rú*) means **nourishment**; when **blood** fails to nourish, it is called **dryness** (*zāo*).*
When **qi** stagnates and fails to flow,
*—this is **qi** being diseased first.*
When **qi** and **blood** are heated, they overflow and move erratically, hence **abnormal movement**.
*—If **evil wind** assaults them, **qi** will stagnate and fail to flow.*
When **blood** stagnates and fails to **moisten**,
*—this is **blood** being diseased later.*
**Qi** transmits the **evil** to **blood**, which is then further assaulted by **evil wind**, so **blood** stagnates and fails to **moisten**, causing disease.

Thus, **abnormal movement** arises first,
*—and the disease follows afterward.*
**Qi** first exhibits **abnormal movement** in the pulse,
*—then **blood** generates the disease.*

「Where does it begin and where does it end?
*—Asking about the starting and terminating points of the Meridians and Collaterals.*
Yet the Meridians and Collaterals are those **Dao/Way**s that conduct **qi** and blood,
*—and harmonize Yin and Yang*—
to nourish the body.

**Answer:** The Meridians are the **direct paths** (*jìng*), and the Meridian Pulse-Vessels are the **channels** (*mài*) that serve as the **Dao/Way**s for the circulation of **qi** and blood,
*—the pathways that disperse and harmonize Yin and Yang*—
to nourish and flourish the entire body.
Their origins trace back to the **Middle Burner** (*Zhōngjiāo*).
*—The starting point of the Meridians and Collaterals is the Middle Burner,*
located between the two nipples,
*—named the **Sovereign Center Acupoint** (*Shànzhōngxué*), also called the **Sea of Qi** (*Qìhǎi*),*

*—"To clearly know the beginning and end,*
the cycles of Yin and Yang are fixed.*
*—The **qi** of the Yang Meridians begins at the Lungs and ends at the Liver,*
and separately from the Yang,
*—one knows the source of disease.*
Separately from the Yin,
*—one knows the period of life and death.*

What does this mean?
*—How should this be understood?*

Thus:

The **beginning and end**—these are the **pulse’s** (*mài*) **cycles**. The subtle and wondrous lies in the **radial pulse-vessel** (*cùntǒng*), which must not be overlooked. To examine it, one follows the **Meridian Classics**, beginning with **Yin and Yang**. Therefore, the **radial pulse-vessel’s** framework truly lies in the **Yin and Yang of beginning and end, ending and beginning**.

The **radial pulse** (*cùnkǒu*)—the **Qi Mouth** (*qìkǒu*)—where **Yin and Yang qi** converge at dawn#27, like an unbroken ring, hence called **"beginning."** The **Yin and Yang qi**, from the early dawn’s auspicious hour, converge at the **radial pulse** (*cùnkǒu*)—like an unbroken ring, cycling endlessly, hence called **"beginning."**

According to the original text’s **radial pulse** (*cùn*), **radial artery** (*rényíng*), I presumptuously revised it to **Qi Mouth** (*qìkǒu*).

**"End"** refers to the **Three Yin and Three Yang Meridians** ceasing—when they cease, death follows, each with its own **manifest signs**, hence called **"end."**

The **manifest signs** of **Foot Shaoyin** (*Zú Shǎoyīn*) **qi** ceasing:
—**teeth lengthen and wither**, flesh **softens and recedes**.

The **manifest signs** of **Foot Taiyin** (*Zú Tàiyīn*) **qi** ceasing:
—**flesh swells and retracts**.

The **manifest signs** of **Foot Jueyin** (*Zú Juéyīn*) **qi** ceasing:
—**tongue root shrinks**.

The **manifest signs** of **Hand Taiyin** (*Shǒu Tàiyīn*) **qi** ceasing:
—**skin withers, hair snaps**.

The **manifest signs** of **Hand Shaoyin** (*Shǒu Shǎoyīn*) **qi** ceasing:
—**face darkens like a pear**.

The **manifest signs** of the **Three Yin** **qi** ceasing:
—**eyes dazzle and gleam**.

The **manifest signs** of the **Six Yang** **qi** ceasing:
—**sweat beads like pearls**, hence called **"death each has its form,"** **"end" is death itself**.

*(Yellow Emperor’s Eighty-One Difficulties Classic: Annotated Diagram and Sentence Explanations, Volume Four—Composed by Lúguó* (*卢国*) *Qín Yuèrén* (秦越人) *and Revised by Lǐ Xiàn* (李駉) *and Yě Zǐ* (子野))

**Difficulty Twenty-Four** states:

When the **qi** of the **three Yin** and **three Yang** channels of the hands and feet has already ceased, how can one determine the prognosis? Can one thereby discern its **virtue/power** (吉凶) and fate?

The **three Yin** and **three Yang** channels of the hands, and the **three Yin** and **three Yang** channels of the feet—when their **qi** ceases at death, what are the signs by which one may determine the prognosis? Can one thereby know their **virtue/power** (吉凶) and life or death?

Thus: When the **qi** of the **foot minor Yin** ceases, the bones wither.

In reply: The **foot minor Yin** is the **kidney** channel, which internally nourishes the bone marrow. When the **kidney** **qi** ceases, the marrow follows suit, withering and drying. The **foot minor Yin** is the channel of winter. The **kidney**, belonging to winter, moves in concealment yet warms the marrow. If the marrow lacks warmth, the flesh no longer clings to the bone. When bone and flesh are estranged, the flesh becomes flaccid and retracted. The flesh flaccid and retracted, thus the teeth grow long and wither. The teeth are the bone’s remnant. The flesh that supports the teeth withers, causing the teeth to lengthen and dry—this is called teeth being parched and lacking luster. The hair lacks moisture. The brain is the marrow’s sea, and the **kidney** governs the marrow. The hair is what the brain nourishes, so its splendor resides in the hair. Now that the marrow has withered, the hair lacks moisture. Hair without moisture is a sign that the bones die first.

On the **5th day** (戊), the condition worsens; on the **6th day** (己), death occurs. **5th** and **6th** are **Earth**; the **kidney** is **Water**. **Earth** can overcome **Water**, hence the saying: "On the **5th day**, the condition worsens; on the **6th day**, death occurs."

When the **qi** of the **foot major Yin** ceases, the pulse fails to nourish the lips. The **foot major Yin** is the **spleen** channel, the **spleen**’s internal organ. Its flesh is the lips, for the **spleen**’s **virtue/power** (华) lies in the four white sections of the lips, and its abundance fills the flesh. The lips are the termination of the flesh. The **spleen** internally nourishes the flesh and externally manifests in the lips. If the pulse fails to nourish, the flesh becomes rough and lacks luster. If the blood and flesh fail to nourish, the flesh becomes coarse and unrefined, lacking luster. When the flesh is coarse and lacks luster, the **spleen** becomes distended. The flesh distended, the lips invert. When the lips invert, the flesh dies first. Lips inverted and lacking luster are the signs of the flesh’s death. On the **1st day** (甲), the condition worsens; on the **2nd day** (乙), death occurs. **1st** and **2nd** are **Wood**; the **spleen** is **Earth**. **Wood** can overcome **Earth**, hence the saying: "On the **1st day**, the condition worsens; on the **2nd day**, death occurs."

When the **qi** of the **foot jue minor Yin** ceases, the tendons contract, drawing the scrotum upward while the tongue rolls back. The **foot jue minor Yin** is the **liver** channel, which governs the tendons. All human movement is the work of tendon **qi**. It also ascends to the tongue and descends to the scrotum. When the **liver** **qi** ceases, all tendons contract and stiffen, causing the scrotum to retract and the tongue to roll inward. The **jue minor Yin** is the **liver** channel. The **liver** is the internal organ of tendons. The **liver**’s essence **qi** nourishes the tendons. The tendons converge at the **yin** organ. The vertical tendons above and below the horizontal bone in the **yin** hair are called the **central tendons** (宗筋), hence the tendons converge at the **yin** organ. They also network at the tongue’s root. The **liver**’s collateral vessels branch from the tongue’s base. If the pulse fails to nourish, the tendons contract and stiffen. If the **liver**’s **qi** fails to nourish, the tendons shorten and stiffen. The tendons contracted and stiffened, the scrotum and tongue follow. When the tendons contract, the scrotum and tongue are drawn inward. Thus, the tongue rolls back and the scrotum retracts—this is the tendons dying first. A rolled tongue and retracted scrotum are the signs of the tendons’ death. On the **7th day** (庚), the condition worsens; on the **8th day** (辛), death occurs. **7th** and **8th** are **Metal**; the **liver** is **Wood**. **Metal** can overcome **Wood**, hence the saying: "On the **7th day**, the condition worsens; on the **8th day**, death occurs."

When the **qi** of the **hand major Yin** ceases, the skin and hair scorch. The **hand major Yin** is the **lung** channel, which governs the skin and nourishes the hair and complexion. When the **lung** **qi** ceases, the skin and hair scorch and wither. The **hand major Yin** is the **lung**. The **lung** belongs to the **hand major Yin**, warming the skin and hair with its moving **qi**. If the **qi** fails to nourish, the skin and hair scorch. When the skin and hair scorch, the **fluids** depart. The **fluids** that regulate excretion and sweat are called **jin**; those that permeate the hollow spaces are called **ye**. If the skin and hair scorch, the **fluids** are all lost. When the **fluids** are lost, the skin and joints are damaged. If the skin and joints are damaged, the skin withers and the hair breaks. When the hair breaks, it is a sign that the hair dies first. On the **3rd day** (丙), the condition worsens; on the **4th day** (丁), death occurs. **3rd** and **4th** are **Fire**; the **lung** is **Metal**. **Fire** overcomes **Metal**, hence the saying: "On the **3rd day**, the condition worsens; on the **4th day**, death occurs."

When the **qi** of the **hand minor Yin** ceases, the pulse fails to circulate. The **hand minor Yin** is the **heart** channel, which governs the pulse. When the true **heart** **qi** ceases, the blood vessels fail to circulate. If the pulse fails to circulate, the blood does not flow. If the **heart**’s **qi** ceases, the blood fails to move. When the blood does not flow, the complexion’s luster departs. The blood nourishes the body, giving it radiance and luster. If the blood fails to flow, the body’s color and moisture are all lost. Thus, the face turns black like a **pear** (梨), a sign that the blood dies first. The **pear** is a fruit consumed by humans, its hue yellow-black. When the **heart**’s blood disperses, the face lacks nourishment, resembling a **pear**’s yellow-black color—this is the sign of the blood’s death. On the **9th day** (壬), the condition worsens; on the **10th day** (癸), death occurs. **9th** and **10th** are **Water**; the **heart** is **Fire**. **Water** overcomes **Fire**, hence the saying: "For **heart** disease, on the **9th day**, the condition worsens; on the **10th day**, death occurs."

When the **qi** of all three **Yin** channels ceases, the eyes become dizzy and blind, turning inward. The three **Yin** channels are the **three Yin** of the hands and feet. **Dizziness** (眩) means confusion...

「暝，闭也。The five **zàng**’s **pīn** all belong to the **three Yin**, all converging at the eyes. When the **three Yin**’s **qi** is exhausted, the eyes grow dizzy and blind—**míng** (暝) means closure.

The **eyes closing** signifies **lost will** (*shī zhì* 失志). Human **five wills** all belong to **Yin**: the **liver**’s will is **anger**, the **heart**’s will is **joy**, the **spleen**’s will is **thought**, the **kidney**’s will is **fear**, and the **lung**’s will is **grief**. When the **three Yin** are exhausted, the five **zàng** lose their wills—thus, there is no joy, anger, thought, grief, or fear. The five wills vanish, hence the term **lost will**. **Lost will** means the will dies first.

When **Yin** and **Yang** separate, one feels **desolate** and **loses will**. Death is when the eyes grow dizzy#5.

To observe the death of the five wills, simply observe the **dizziness** and **chaos** of the eyes.

When the **six Yang**’s **qi** is exhausted, **Yin** and **Yang** separate. The **six Yang** are the **three Yang** of the hands and feet. The **hand three Yang** connect to **Heaven’s qi**—**day Yang**—while the **foot three Yang** connect to **Earth’s qi**—**night Yin**. When **Heaven** and **Earth’s** **Yin** and **Yang** are blocked, it is called **separation**.

When **Yin** and **Yang** separate, the **shèng** and **lǐ** are depleted. **Shèng** refers to the **jīn-yè** (津液) leaking out; **lǐ** refers to the **texture** where **patterns** converge. When **Yin** and **Yang** are severed, the **shèng** and **lǐ** open and leak without closure.

Thus, **absolute sweating** emerges—**sweat**#6 like **strung pearls**, pouring forth without flowing. **Shèng** and **lǐ** are the **sweat voids**; once the **sweat voids** open, sweat clings to the flesh like **beads**, yet does not disperse. This is the sign that **qi** dies first.

Sweat pouring but not flowing—this is the sign that **qi** dies first. If one dies in the **morning**, the signs appear the **previous evening**; if one dies in the **evening**, the signs appear the **following morning**. This is what is meant.

In all cases where these signs appear and death follows, it will occur on the same day.»

The **Great Canon of the Channels and Networks, Chapter Twenty-One#7: Twenty-Five Difficulties**

There are twelve channels. [See the first difficulty for annotation.] The five **Zang** and six **Fu**, totaling eleven, share one channel—what channel is this?

In total, the five **Zang** and six **Fu** govern eleven channels, yet there remains one channel unknown. Indeed, this one channel is the **hand Shào Yīn** (minor yin) and the **heart’s governing vessel’s** collateral branch.

The five **Zang** each have one **tún** (vessel), making eleven **tún** in total, while the heart has two **tún**, together forming the twelve channels.

The **hand Shào Yīn** is the **true heart tún**, serving as the **Jūn Huǒ** (sovereign fire);
The **hand Xīn Zhǔ** (heart’s governing vessel) is the **heart’s wrapping tún**, serving as the **Xiàng Huǒ** (ministerial fire).

The **heart’s governing vessel** and the **San Jiāo** (triple burner) form its outer sheath.
The **heart’s governing vessel** is the **hand Yàn Yīn** (ulnar yin);
The **San Jiāo** is the **hand Shào Yáng** (minor yang).
These two channels merge as the outer sheath—
Both have names yet no tangible form.

The **heart’s wrapping** lies beyond the **màn zhī** (diffuse fat), with fine aponeurotic membranes like silk, connecting to the heart and lungs.
The **San Jiāo** is detailed in the thirty-first difficulty.
Both have names yet no tangible form.

Thus, it is said that there are twelve **channels** (经). The **hand Xīn Zhǔ** (heart’s governing vessel) and the **hand Shào Yáng** (minor yang) govern the five **zàng** (viscera) and six **fǔ** (bowels), completing the twelve **channels** (经).

The twenty-sixth difficulty states:
*"There are twelve channels, fifteen collaterals (络). What are the remaining three collaterals?"*
Each of the twelve channels has one collateral, so there should be twelve collaterals. Yet it is said there are fifteen collaterals—what are these three collaterals?

Now it is explained:
There are **yang** (陽) collaterals and **yīn** (陰) collaterals.
The **yang** (陽) **tǎ** (踏) channel is on the left lateral ankle, with its collateral on the right medial ankle;
The **yīn** (陰) **tǎ** (踏) channel is on the right medial ankle, with its collateral on the left lateral ankle.
There is also the **spleen’s great collateral** (脾之大络).
The **spleen’s great collateral** originates from the **spleen** (脾), named **Dà Bāo** (great wrapping), with its orifice (穴) located below the navel (脐).
The **yang** (陽) collateral is the collateral of **yang** (陽) **jiāo** (矫, *correction/rectification*);
The **yīn** (陰) collateral is the collateral of **yīn** (陰) **jiāo** (矫, *correction/rectification*).
This clearly distinguishes the **yang** (陽) collaterals and **yīn** (陰) collaterals.
Thus, there are fifteen collaterals (络).
With these three collaterals, the total becomes fifteen collaterals.

The **Eight Extraordinary Channels** (奇经八脉) are discussed in the thirty-third chapter.
The twenty-seventh difficulty states:
*"There are eight extraordinary channels (奇经), which are not confined to the twelve regular channels (十二经). What does this mean?"*
**Qí** (奇) means *collateral* (络), *irregular* (零), and *unpaired* (不偶).
These eight **channels** (豚) do not follow the **Dao/Way** (道) of the regular **yīn-yáng** (阴阳) channels but instead correspond to the outer sheaths (表裹) of the **Eight Extraordinary Channels**.
They run along alternate and irregular paths (别道奇行), hence they are called **Eight Extraordinary Channels** (奇经).

Now it is explained:
There is the **Yang Wéi** (陽維, *Yang Restraint*).
**Wéi** (维) means *to hold* (持).
The **Yang Wéi** holds all the **yang** (陽) channels.

There is the **Yīn Wéi** (陰維, *Yin Restraint*).
The **Yīn Wéi** holds all the **yīn** (陰) channels.

There is the **Yang Jīng** (陽踏, *Yang Correction*).
**Tǎ** (踏) means *swift* (捷疾) and *vigorous* (健).
This channel governs the mechanism of walking (行步之机要) and the movement of the feet (动足之所由).

There is the **Yīn Jīng** (陰踏, *Yin Correction*).
Similar in function.

There is the **Chōng** (冲, *Penetrating*).
The **Chōng** channel is the **sea of the twelve regular channels**.
**Chōng** means *to communicate*.
It states that this channel, descending to the feet and ascending to the head, communicates and receives the **qi** and blood of the twelve regular channels.

There is the **Dū** (督, *Governor*).
**Dū** means *central*.
It is the central governing channel of the **yang** channels.

There is the **Rèn** (任, *Conception*).
**Rèn** means *to bear* (□#10).
It is the foundation of human life and nurturing.

There is the **Dài** (带, *Girdle*) channel.
**Dài** means *to bind*.
It gathers and binds all the channels, ensuring their harmonious regulation.

In total, these eight channels do not adhere to the regular channels, hence they are called the **Eight Extraordinary Channels**.

These eight extraordinary channels do not follow the fixed regulations of the twelve regular channels; they run along alternate paths, hence they are called **Eight Extraordinary Channels**.

The regular channels number twelve, the **luò** (络) networks fifteen, making a total of twenty-seven **qi** pathways.
Together, the regular channels and **luò** networks comprise twenty-seven **qi** pathways, flowing upward and downward in sequence.

Why do the **Eight Extraordinary Channels** not adhere to the regular channels?
It is asked: The **luò** networks and the twelve regular channels do not follow fixed regulations.

It is explained:
The Sage constructed canals and ditches to facilitate water flow, preparing for contingencies.
The answer is: The earth has twenty-four waterways, corresponding to the twenty-four regular channels and **luò** networks.
The Sage, beyond the twenty-four channels of water, further constructed canals and ditches to illustrate the **Eight Extraordinary Channels**.
Canals and ditches are the pathways that facilitate the flow of water, serving as safeguards against unforeseen circumstances.

When heaven sends rain, the canals and ditches overflow.
When heaven’s timely rains descend, the canals and ditches become full.
At such times, mist and fog wander freely, and the Sage cannot further regulate them.
When heaven’s rains and mists overflow the canals and ditches, the Sage allows them to flow freely without further intervention.

This is like the **luò** channels overflowing; the regular channels cannot further restrain them.
When the **Eight Extraordinary Channels** overflow, even the twelve regular channels cannot restrain them, allowing them to flow along their alternate paths.

The *Twenty-Eight Difficulties* states:
As for the **Eight Extraordinary Channels**, since they do not adhere to the twelve regular channels, where do they originate and terminate?

It is explained:
The **Dū** channel—
The first of the **Eight Extraordinary Channels**—
arises at the **lower extremity’s acupuncture point** (下极之俞).
The **Chángqiáng** (长强) acupuncture point, located on the sacrum, is where the **Dū** channel originates.
It ascends along the spine.
The **Dū** channel converges with the **Rèn** channel and runs along the spine.
It ascends to **Fēngfǔ** (风府).
It ascends to the **Fēngfǔ** acupuncture point, located three *cùn* above the hairline.
It enters and belongs to the brain.
It ascends into the brain.

The **Rèn** channel—
The second of the **Eight Extraordinary Channels**—
arises below **Zhōngjí** (中极).
The **Rèn** channel ascends from the **Zhōngjí** acupuncture point, located four *cùn* below the navel.
**Zhōngjí** below refers to the **Qūgǔ** (曲骨) acupuncture point, where the **Rèn** channel originates.
It ascends along the inner lower abdomen to the **pubic hairline**.
It follows the interior of the abdomen, ascending to the **Guānyuán** (关元) acupuncture point, located three *cùn* below the navel.
It ascends to the throat and pharynx.

The **Chōng** channel—
The third of the **Eight Extraordinary Channels**—
arises at **Qìchōng** (气冲), alongside the **foot Yangming** channel.
The **Qìchōng** acupuncture point is located two *cùn* on either side of the pubic hair in the lower abdomen, where the **foot Yangming** channel’s **qi** emerges.
It ascends alongside the navel, dispersing in the chest.

The **Dài** channel—
The fourth of the **Eight Extraordinary Channels**—
arises at **Jìxié** (季胁).
**Jìxié** is located below the **jīn** (筋, *tendon*), connecting to the space between the body and the hip bone, where the **Dài** channel originates.
It encircles the body.
*Huí* (回) means *to encircle*.
It encircles the body like a girdle.

The **Yáng Jīng** channel—
The fifth of the **Eight Extraordinary Channels**—
arises at the **heel’s center**.
It originates from the center of the heel.
It ascends along the outer ankle.
It follows the **Chōng** acupuncture point on the outer ankle bone.
It ascends into **Fēngchí** (风池).
It ascends into the **Fēngchí** acupuncture point, located in the depression at the back of the neck, within the hairline.

The **Yīn Jīng** channel—
The sixth of the **Eight Extraordinary Channels**—
also arises at the **heel’s center**.
It originates from the center of the heel.
It ascends along the inner ankle.
It follows the **Zhàohǎi** (照海) acupuncture point on the inner ankle bone.
It ascends to the throat and pharynx.
It intersects and communicates with the **Chōng** channel.

The **Yáng Wéi** and **Yīn Wéi**—
These are the **halters of yīn-yáng**, governing and holding the **yīn-yáng** channels.
These two channels are among the **Eight Extraordinary Channels**.
They **luò** (络) throughout the body.
They **luò** bind and regulate the channels of the body.
When they overflow and accumulate, they cannot circulate and irrigate the regular channels.
When these two channels overflow and accumulate, they cannot cycle and nourish the twelve regular channels.

Thus, the **Yáng Wéi** arises at the convergence of all **yang** channels.
The **Yáng Wéi** channel originates where all **yang** channels converge.
The **Yīn Wéi** arises at the intersection of all **yīn** channels.
The **Yīn Wéi** channel originates where all **yīn** channels intersect.

The Sage constructed canals and ditches; when they overflow, the water flows into deep lakes, and even the Sage cannot restrain them.
The Sage’s canals and ditches facilitate water flow, but when they overflow, the water flows into deep lakes, beyond even the Sage’s control.
The flow of canals and ditches is analogous to the **Eight Extraordinary Channels** described below.
When a person’s channels are vigorous, the **qi** enters the eight extraordinary channels without circulating, so the twelve regular channels cannot restrain them.
When a person’s channels are vigorous and the **qi** enters the **Eight Extraordinary Channels**, flowing along alternate paths, the twelve regular channels cannot control them.

If they receive **xiéqi** (邪气, *pathogenic qi*), accumulation leads to swelling and heat.
When the eight extraordinary channels receive pathogenic **qi** and accumulate, they result in swelling and heat.
They are treated with **biānshè** (砭射, *acupuncture and bloodletting*).
They are treated by piercing with **biān** (砭) stones.

The Twenty-Ninth Difficulty states: How do the **Eight Extraordinary Channels** manifest as disease? When discussing the **Eight Extraordinary Channels**, one must inquire about their pathological conditions.

Now it is said: The **Yang Linking Channel** (阳维) pertains to **yang**; the **Yang Linking Channel** maintains and governs all the **yang** channels. The **Yin Linking Channel** (阴维) pertains to **yin**; the **Yin Linking Channel** maintains and governs all the **yin** channels. When **yin** and **yang** cannot mutually maintain each other, the **yang** fails to govern its respective channels, and the **yin** fails to govern its respective channels. Then one feels **chàngrán** (怅然, *disheartened*) and loses resolve. **Chàngrán** means *startled*. When startled, one loses resolve and feels **huǎnghū** (恍惚, *dazed*). The **qi** becomes **róngróng** (溶溶, *languid and slow*), unable to sustain itself. **Róngróng** signifies *sluggish and weak*; thus, it cannot gather and maintain itself. **Yin Linking Channel** disease manifests as **Yin Tread Channel** (阴踏) disorder. When the **yin** channels are vigorous, their **qi** disperses into the **Yin Tread Channel**, resulting in **Yin Tread Channel** disease. When **yang** is slack and **yin** is urgent, this denotes the meaning of **xūshí** (虚实, *deficiency and excess*). In **Yin Tread Channel** disease, the **qi** ascends rapidly from the inner ankle, while the outer ankle rises sluggishly. Additionally, it causes the foot to become stiff and straight, with the **Five Networks** (五络) obstructed.

The **Yang Linking Channel** disease manifests as **Yang Tread Channel** (阳踏) disorder. When the **yang** channels are vigorous, their **qi** disperses into the **Yang Tread Channel**, resulting in **Yang Tread Channel** disease. When **yin** is slack and **yang** is urgent, the **Yang Network** (阳络) lies at the outer ankle, and in disease, its **qi** ascends rapidly from the outer ankle while the inner ankle rises sluggishly. Additionally, it causes one to run wildly without restraint.

The **Penetrating Channel** (冲) as disease: When the **Penetrating Channel** receives disease, it causes **nìqì** (逆气, *rebellious qi*) and **guǒjí** (裹急, *abdominal constriction*). When **kidney qi** is insufficient, it injures the **Penetrating Channel**, thus **rebellious qi** refers to **zhàngnì** (胀逆, *distension and reversal*), and **abdominal constriction** refers to **fùtòng** (腹痛, *abdominal pain*).

The **Governing Channel** (督) as disease: When the **Governing Channel** receives disease, the spine becomes rigid and **jué** (厥, *swoon*) occurs. Since the **Governing Channel** runs along the spine, disease manifests as rigidity of the spine and **jué** (swooning).

The **Conception Channel** (任) as disease: When the **Conception Channel** receives disease...

When the **Conception Channel** receives disease, it causes internal **knots and blockages**—in men, this manifests as the **Seven Types of Hernia** (七疝). When **qi** and **blood** are deficient and **cold-heat imbalances** arise, internal blockages form. The Seven Types of Hernia are:
- **Hammer Hernia** (锤疝),
- **Coiled Hernia** (盘疝),
- **Cold Hernia** (寒疝),
- **Symptomatic Hernia** (症疝),
- **Adjacent Hernia** (附疝),
- **Wolfish Hernia** (狼疝),
- **Qi Hernia** (气疝).

In women, it manifests as **clumped masses** (痕聚). *痕脊#19* refers to masses shaped by external influences. The Eight Types of Masses are:
- **Snake-like Mass** (蛇痕),
- **Fatty Mass** (脂痕),
- **Greenish Mass** (青痕),
- **Yellowish Mass** (黄痕),
- **Dry, Dull Mass** (燥痴),
- **Blood Mass** (血痕),
- **Vixen-like Mass** (狐痕),
- **Tortoise-shell Mass** (鳖痕).

When the **Belt Channel** (带) receives disease, the **Belt Vessel** (带豚) is affected, causing:
- **abdominal fullness** (腹满),
- **distended abdomen** (腹肚膨满),
- **waist weakness**, as if sitting in water (腰溶溶若坐水中).

When the **Yang Linking Vessel** (阳维) receives disease, it causes **alternating cold and heat** (苦寒热). Since the Yang Linking Vessel governs the **Defensive Qi** (卫), cold and heat arise.

When the **Yin Linking Vessel** (阴维) receives disease, it causes **heart pain** (苦心痛). Since the Yin Linking Vessel governs the **Nourishing Qi** (荣), which is **blood**, and the heart generates blood, pain ensues.

These are the diseases of the **Eight Extraordinary Vessels** (奇经八脉).

The **Nourishing Qi** flows—does it always accompany the **Defensive Qi**?

*Nourishing* (荣) means *flourishing*. The hundred bones and nine orifices are thereby nourished and made radiant by this blood and qi.

*Defensive* (卫) means *to guard*. The resolute and fierce qi circulates outside the vessels, moving through the body by day and through the organs by night, guarding and protecting the body.

Does the **Nourishing Qi** accompany the **Defensive Qi**? Yes: the Classics say that humans receive qi from grains. Humans have no roots or stalks; food is their life, so humans receive qi from grains.

Grains enter the stomach. The stomach is the sea of water and grains. The stomach is like a marketplace#20, where grains enter. Then it transmits to the five organs and six palaces.

When food qi enters the stomach, it distributes essence to the liver, enriching the tendons. When food qi enters the stomach, kidney qi#21 ascends to the heart, enriching the vessels. When drink enters the stomach, it disperses essence and qi, ascending to the spleen. The spleen’s qi distributes essence, ascending to the lungs and descending to the bladder.

The five organs and six palaces all receive qi. The five organs and six palaces all receive grain qi. The refined portion becomes **Nourishing Qi**. The stomach transforms water, transmitting it to the heart to generate blood; blood is **Nourishing Qi**, so the refined grain qi becomes **Nourishing Qi**.

The turbid portion becomes **Defensive Qi**. The stomach transforms grains into qi, transmitting it to the lungs, which govern qi; qi is **Defensive Qi**, so the turbid grain qi becomes **Defensive Qi**.

**Nourishing Qi** circulates within the vessels. **Nourishing Qi** and blood belong to yin; yin governs#22 the interior, so **Nourishing Qi** flows within the blood vessels.

**Defensive Qi** circulates outside the vessels. **Defensive Qi** belongs to yang; yang governs the exterior, so **Defensive Qi** flows outside the blood vessels.

**Nourishing Qi** flows ceaselessly. The **Nourishing** and **Defensive Qi** circulate endlessly, never resting.

At fifty, the great convergence is renewed.
A person in one day and night completes fifty cycles of **Nourishing Qi** and **Defensive Qi**.
The next day at the **Gèn** hour, they converge again at the **Hand Taiyin** meridian.

Yin and yang interpenetrate.
Yin and yang continuously alternate and flow through one another,
like a ring with no beginning or end.
Like a ring with no discernible start or finish.
Thus, it is known that **Nourishing Qi** and **Defensive Qi** follow one another.
Thus, it is known that **Nourishing Qi** and **Defensive Qi** circulate together.

The **Thirty-First Difficulty** asks:
What are the **Sanjiāo (Three Burners)**?
The **Upper Burner**, **Middle Burner**, and **Lower Burner**—
how do they manifest?
What do they receive and bestow?
How do they arise?
Where do they originate?
How do they begin?
Where do they begin?
How do they end?
Where do they end?
Where is their governance?
Where is the method of treatment?
Can this be made clear?
Can this principle be understood?

Indeed, the **Sanjiāo** are the pathways of water and grain.
The **Sanjiāo**, along with the **Cìdú** (secondary conduits), govern the waterways from which water flows.
Water flows in from the **Upper Burner** and out from the **Lower Burner**.
This is where **qi** begins and ends.
The **Qi Sea** is within the abdomen.
Again, the **Qi Sea** is three inches below the navel, where one perceives the beginning and end of **qi**.

The **Upper Burner** is below the heart, above the **Diàogē** (esophageal junction), at the upper entrance of the stomach.
This indicates the location of the **Upper Burner**.
It governs the interior without exiting.
It governs the reception and containment of water and grain without expulsion.
Its treatment point is at **Tánzhōng** (one inch below the **Yùtáng**, between the nipples, in the depression).
**Tánzhōng** is the name of this acupuncture point.
Directly between the nipples is this point.
**Tánzhōng** serves as the ministerial official, governing **qi**, distributing yin and yang, harmonizing the mind, and giving rise to joy and delight.

The **Middle Burner** is within the stomach’s precincts, neither above nor below.
This indicates the location of the **Middle Burner**.
It governs the rotting and ripening of water and grain.
It governs the orderly transformation of water and grain into **qi** and blood.
Its treatment point is at **Qíbàng** (one inch lateral to the navel), named the **Tiāngōng** acupuncture point.

The **Lower Burner** is at the upper opening of the bladder.
This indicates the location of the **Lower Burner**.
It governs the separation of purity and turbidity, exiting without entering, to transmit and guide.
Above, it responds to the water and grain received—
it separates them, with the pure becoming urine and the turbid becoming feces, transmitting them outward.
Its treatment point is one inch below the navel, named the **Yīnjiāo** acupuncture point.

Thus, they are called the **Sanjiāo**.
In summary, their **fu** (storage) is at **Qījiē**.

The **Qījiē** is the pathway of **Yīn** and **Yáng**, located two inches lateral to the pubic hair in the lower abdomen.
This point is where the **foot Yangming** meridian’s **qi** originates.
The **foot Yangming** (Stomach) meridian transforms grain into **qi**, while the **Sanjiāo** governs the **qi** of the Three Elements.
Thus, its **fu** (storage) is at **Qījiē**.
One text states **Chōng** instead.
This is not the language of **Biǎn Que** (扁鹊), but rather **Lǚ Shì**’s (吕氏) second recording, which notes that this was a variation in earlier editions.
**Qīchōng** is the root of the Twelve Meridians and the **fu** where all meridians circulate their **qi**—this meaning also holds.

In the fifth chapter of *藏府配像* (The Five Zang and Six Fu Corresponding to Images), there are six questions (#29):
The Thirty-Second Difficulty asks:
*"The Five Zang are all equal.
The Five Zang are all situated within the abdomen.
Yet why are the Heart and Lungs alone positioned above the **Liè** (鬲)?"*
How can it be that the Heart and Lungs alone reside above the **chest Liè**?
The answer is:
The Heart governs **blood**, and the Lungs govern **qi**.
Blood is the **Róng** (Honor), and **qi** is the **Wèi** (Defense).
The Heart is the sovereign, dwelling high and overseeing all—
it generates **blood**, which becomes the **Róng**.
The Lungs are like the **Huàgài** (华盖, ornamental canopy), also high in position—
they generate **qi**, which becomes the **Wèi**.
Together, they ascend and descend, called the **Róng-Wèi**.
Blood flows according to **qi**, and **qi** moves, depending on it,
sometimes ascending, sometimes descending, yet always following in tandem.
Circulating through the meridians and networks,
the **Róng** completes its cycle around the body.
Flowing and returning within the Twelve (#31) Meridians and Fifteen Networks,
it spreads through the body but does not distribute evenly.
Thus, the Heart and Lungs are positioned above the **Liè**.

The Heart and Lungs are the masters of **blood** and **qi**, and they also connect with **Tianqi** (天气, celestial **qi**).
Hence, they are above the **Liè**.

The Thirty-Third Difficulty asks:
*"The Liver is green, symbolizing Wood.
The Liver’s color is green, corresponding to the **East**’s **Jiǎ** (甲) and **Yǐ** (乙) Wood.
The Lungs are white, symbolizing Metal.
The Lungs’ color is white, corresponding to the **West**’s **Gēng** (庚) and **Xīn** (辛) Metal.
The Liver sinks when it meets Water.
When the Liver encounters Water, it sinks.
Wood floats when it meets Water.
Wood is the **qi** of the Liver, yet when it meets Water, it rises instead of sinking.
The Lungs float when they meet Water.
When the Lungs encounter Water, they float.
Metal sinks when it meets Water.
Metal is the **qi** of the Lungs, yet when it meets Water, it *reverts* (#30) and does not float.
What is the meaning of this?"*
Why does the Liver—Wood—sink, and the Lungs—Metal—float?

The answer is:
The Liver is not purely Wood.
The **East**’s **Jiǎ** and **Yǐ** Wood: the Liver belongs to Wood,
yet it does not purely inherit the **qi** of Wood.
**Yǐ** is the *corner* (角).
**Jiǎ** is **Yáng**, and **Yǐ** is **Yīn**;
**Yǐ** carries a Metal resonance (#32) rather than a purely Wood one (#33).
Wood is **Yáng**, and Metal is **Yīn**—
**Yīn** and **Yáng** intermingle.
**Gēng** is *soft* (柔).
The **East**’s **Jiǎ** and **Yǐ** Wood fear the **West**’s **Gēng** and **Xīn** Metal—
**Yǐ** submits to **Gēng** as a wife,
**Gēng** being **Yáng** and **Yǐ** **Yīn**—
a yielding **Yīn**.

In grand terms, it is **Yīn** and **Yáng**.
Speaking of the greater **Yáng** aspect of Wood,
**Gēng** shares both **Yīn** and **Yáng**—
**Jiǎ** is **Yáng**, and **Yǐ** is **Yīn**.
In smaller terms, it is *husband and wife*.
Speaking of the Wood’s lesser aspect,
nothing surpasses the union of husband and wife.
Since **Jiǎ** and **Yǐ** Wood fear **Gēng** and **Xīn** Metal,
**Yǐ**—the younger sister—marries **Gēng** as his wife,
**Yǐ** being the **Yīn** wife, **Gēng** the **Yáng** husband.
**Gēng** releases its subtle **Yáng** (#34).
**Jiǎ** is **Yáng**; this releases the **qi** of **Jiǎ**.
Yet it absorbs the subtle **Yīn** **qi** of **Yǐ**.
**Yǐ** is **Yīn**; it also contains Metal’s nature,
absorbing the **Yīn** **qi** of **Yǐ**.
Its intent delights in Metal.
The **Jiǎ**’s essence finds joy in Metal’s nature.
Moreover, it travels through **Yīn** pathways more often.
Wood receives **qi** in the seventh month,
grows strong in the tenth month,
and thrives from the seventh to twelfth month—
mostly through **Yīn** pathways.
In the first month, it faces its official,
and in the second month, its sovereign reigns—
then it follows **Yáng** pathways.
Thus, the Liver sinks when it meets Water.
**Yǐ** unites with **Gēng**, adhering to the husband’s nature,
so the Liver sinks when it meets Water.

The Lungs are not purely Metal.
The **West**’s **Gēng** and **Xīn** Metal: the Lungs belong to Metal,
yet they do not purely inherit Metal’s **qi**.
**Xīn** is the *merchant* (商).
**Gēng** is **Yáng**, and **Xīn** is **Yīn**;
**Xīn** carries a Fire resonance (#35).
*Merchant* is the sound of Metal.
Fire is **Yáng**, and Metal is **Yīn**—
**Yīn** and **Yáng** intermingle.
**Dīng** (丙) is *soft* (柔).
The **West**’s **Gēng** and **Xīn** Metal fear the **South**’s **Dīng** and **Dìng** (丁) Fire—
**Xīn** marries **Dīng** as his wife,
**Dīng** being **Yáng** and **Xīn** **Yīn**—
a yielding **Yīn**.

In grand terms, it is **Yīn** and **Yáng**.
Speaking of the greater aspect of Lung-Metal,
nothing surpasses **Yīn** and **Yáng**—
**Gēng** is **Yáng**, and **Xīn** is **Yīn**.
In smaller terms, it is *husband and wife*.
Speaking of the lesser aspect of Lung-Metal,
nothing surpasses the union of husband and wife—
**Gēng** and **Xīn** Metal fear **Dīng** and **Dìng** Fire,
so **Xīn**—the younger sister—marries **Dīng** as his wife,
**Xīn** being the **Yīn** bride, **Dīng** the **Yáng** husband.
**Xīn** releases its subtle **Yīn** (#36).
**Xīn** is **Yīn**; this releases the husband’s subtle **Yīn** **qi**.
Yet it unites with Fire.
**Xīn** Metal aligns with **Dīng** Fire in marriage.
Its intent delights in Fire.
The Lungs’ Metal essence finds joy in Fire’s nature.
Moreover, it travels through **Yáng** pathways more often.
Metal receives **qi** in the first month,
gains vitality in the fourth month,
and thrives from the first to sixth month—
mostly through **Yáng** pathways.
By the seventh month, it faces its official,
and in the eighth month, its sovereign reigns—
then it follows **Yīn** pathways.
Thus, the Lungs float when they meet Water.
**Dīng** unites with **Xīn**, adhering to the husband’s nature,
so the Lungs float when they meet Water.

The Lungs, when mature, revert to sinking.
The Lungs are born floating but mature and sink.
The Liver, when mature, reverts to floating.
Why is this?
The Liver is born sinking but matures and floats.
Thus, it is known that **Xīn** returns to **Gēng**.
**Gēng** is purely Metal in nature,
while **Xīn** carries a Fire resonance,
so when the Lungs are born, they float,
yet when they mature and revert to sinking,
it is known that **Xīn**’s Fire resonance
returns to **Gēng**’s Metal nature.
**Yǐ** returns to **Jiǎ**.
**Jiǎ** is purely Wood in nature,
while **Yǐ** carries a Metal resonance,
so when the Liver is born, it sinks,
yet when it matures and reverts to floating,
it is known that **Yǐ**’s Metal resonance
returns to **Jiǎ**’s Wood nature.

The Thirty-Fourth Difficulty asks:
*"The Five Zang each have sound, color, odor, and taste;
can this be understood?"*
The Liver, Heart, Spleen, Lungs, and Kidneys all possess sounds,
colors, fragrances and odors,
and flavors.
Can this principle be understood?
The answer is:
*"Ten transformations."*

The discussion of the Five Zang states that there are purely five transformations,
but when combined with the Six Fu, there are ten transformations.

The Liver’s color is **qīng** (青).
The variations of the five colors lie within Wood,
and the five colors of the Zang are derived from the Liver’s Wood *qi* (氣)
permeating and nourishing one another,
so each manifests its own kind—its color is seen.
The Liver is the essence of Wood,
the *zhèn* (震) *qi*,
its color **qīng** (青),
and it occupies the **shù fāng** (束方) position.
Its odor is **zào** (躁).
When influenced by Fire, its odor becomes **zào** (躁).
Its taste is **suān** (酸).
Earth receives Wood’s taste and becomes **suān** (酸),
as the interplay of straight and crooked yields **suān** (酸),
and **suān** (酸) is taken for its astringent quality.
Its sound is **hū** (呼).
Metal and Wood correspond,
and when they interact, the sound is **hū** (呼).
Its fluid is **dì** (泣).
Water conducts *qi* and nourishes the Child,
so the Liver produces **dì** (泣).

The Heart’s color is **chì** (赤).
Wood’s dispersed color, when in Fire, is **chì** (赤).
Its odor is **jiāo** (焦).
The variations of the five odors lie within Fire,
and the five odors of the Zang arise when Fire flourishes—**jiāo** (焦) and **kǔ** (苦) emerge.
Its taste is **kǔ** (苦).
The Spleen governs sweetness and receives flavors,
while Fire, derived from Earth, makes Earth **kǔ** (苦),
and **kǔ** (苦) is taken for its dry and purgative quality.
Its sound is **yán** (言).
Metal and Fire correspond in harmony,
as husband and wife meet, and the sound is **yán** (言).
Its fluid is **hàn** (汗).
Water and Fire in mutual balance,
steamed, become **hàn** (汗).

The Spleen’s color is **huáng** (黄).
Wood’s dispersed color, when in Earth, is **huáng** (黄).
Its odor is **xiāng** (香).
Fire transforms Earth, so its odor is **xiāng** (香).
Its taste is **gān** (甘).
The Spleen’s Earth flavor is **gān** (甘),
and **gān** (甘) can receive flavors,
taken for its gentle and soothing quality,
to nourish the Five Zang through the five tastes,
each following its kind to match its flavor—
in its own Zang, it is **gān** (甘).
Its sound is **gē** (歌).
Metal and Earth generate one another,
as mother and child meet, and the sound is **gē** (歌).
Its fluid is **xián** (涎).
Water conducts fluids, and in the Spleen, they become **xián** (涎).

The Lungs’ color is **bái** (白).
Wood’s dispersed color, when reaching the Lungs, becomes **bái** (白).
Its odor is **xīng** (腥).
Fire’s transformation, when in Metal, is **xīng** (腥).
Its taste is **xīn** (辛).
Earth receives flavors, and the Lung’s master flavor is **xīn** (辛),
taken for its ability to disperse and open.
Its sound is **kū** (哭).
The five tones arise from Metal,
and Metal emits the five tones
to express the Five Zang,
each following its kind to manifest its sound—
Metal, in its own nature, is **kū** (哭),
for the Lungs belong to Metal,
and Metal is the *shāng* (商) tone,
the sorrow of autumn,
and in the emotions, it is sorrowful weeping.
Its fluid is **tì** (涕).
Water conducts fluids, and in the Lungs, they become **tì** (涕).

The Kidneys’ color is **hēi** (黑).
Wood’s dispersed color, when reaching the Kidneys, becomes **hēi** (黑).
Its odor is **fǔ** (腐).
Fire governs odors, and in Water, they become **fǔ** (腐).
Its taste is **xián** (咸).
Earth receives flavors, and in Water, they are conducted downward as **xián** (咸),
for **xián** (咸) is taken for its ability to soften and yield.

Its sound is **shēn** (呻).
When the child meets the mother, the sound of tender **shēn** (呻) is emitted.
Its fluid is **tuò** (唾).
All oral fluids arise from Water,
Water conducts the five fluids,
distributing them to the Five Zang,
thus each Zang has its own fluid,
and in the Kidneys, it becomes **tuò** (唾).

These are the Five Zang’s sounds, colors, odors, and tastes.
In summary, the Five Zang have five sounds, five colors, five odors, five fluids,
each sequentially nourishing the others.

Do the Five Zang contain seven **shén** (神)?
The Five Zang each contain seven **shén** (神).

The Liver contains **hún** (魂).
That which follows the spirit in coming and going is called **pò** (魄);
the Liver contains **hún** (魂), as the auxiliary of the spirit’s **qì** (氣).

The Lungs contain **pò** (魄).
That which combines with the vital essence in entering and exiting is called **pò** (魄);
the Lungs contain **pò** (魄), as the auxiliary of the vital essence’s **qì** (氣).

The Heart contains **shén** (神).
The Heart is the dwelling of the luminous spirit;
it contains **shén** (神), where the vital essence transforms into form.

The Spleen contains **yì** (意) and **zhì** (智).
When the Heart recalls something, it is called **yì** (意);
**yì** (意) governs thought, being the origin of discernment and judgment.
**Zhì** (智) governs memory.
The Kidneys contain **jīng** (精) and **zhì** (志).
The two spirits intermingle,
uniting to form **jīng** (精);
in the Heart, it becomes **zhì** (志),
for **zhì** (志) is that which the Heart directs itself toward.

*(End of the fourth section of the Yellow Emperor’s Eighty-One Difficulties Canon, annotated by Mo Tu.)*

The **Five Viscera and Palaces in Correspondence with the Images** (藏府配像第五):

The **qi** (氣) stirs and follows the blood—
the **Lungs** are the **market** where the five flavors converge,
as the **Spleen** governs the **transformation** of the **grain** into **virtue** (德).
The **Kidneys** store the **turbulent qi** (浊气),
while the **Heart** governs the **spirit** (神) and the **Liver** holds the **planning** (画).

The **Spleen** is the **central market** of the twelve **organs**,
where the **grain** is refined into **virtue** (德).
The **Heart** is the **central palace** of the **Liver** and **Kidneys**,
where the **spirit** (神) and **will** (志) are **perfected**.

The **Liver** is the **central palace** of the **Lungs** and **Spleen**,
where the **planning** (画) and **discernment** (画) are **unified**.
The **Lungs** are the **central palace** of the **Heart** and **Kidneys**,
where the **spirit** (神) and **turbulent qi** (浊气) are **harmonized**.

The **Spleen** is the **central palace** of the **Liver** and **Heart**,
where the **grain** is **cooked** into **virtue** (德).
The **Kidneys** are the **central palace** of the **Lungs** and **Spleen**,
where the **turbulent qi** (浊气) and **virtue** (德) are **refined**.

The **Heart** is the **central palace** of the **Liver** and **Kidneys**,
where the **spirit** (神) and **will** (志) are **fulfilled**.
The **Liver** is the **central palace** of the **Lungs** and **Spleen**,
where the **planning** (画) and **discernment** (画) are **clarified**.

The **Lungs** are the **central palace** of the **Heart** and **Kidneys**,
where the **spirit** (神) and **turbulent qi** (浊气) are **balanced**.
The **Spleen** is the **central palace** of the **Liver** and **Heart**,
where the **grain** is **transformed** into **virtue** (德).

The **Kidneys** are the **central palace** of the **Lungs** and **Spleen**,
where the **turbulent qi** (浊气) and **virtue** (德) are **nourished**.

*(From the Yellow Emperor’s Eighty-One Difficulties Canon Illustrated and Annotated, Volume Five, compiled by Lu Guo Qin Yue Ren, annotated by Linchuan Xi Fanzi Li Ao Zi Ye.)*

Thirty-Fifth Difficulty says: The **Five Zàng** each have their own **domain** (所).
The **domain** refers to the place where they reside.
Each of the **Five Zàng** has its own **domain**,
and their **palaces** (府) are all nearby.
The **Stomach** is near the **Spleen**,
the **Gallbladder** is near the **Liver**,
and the **Bladder** is near the **Kidneys**.
Yet the **Heart** and **Lungs** are distant from the **Large Intestine** and **Small Intestine**.
The **Heart** and **Lungs** are located above the **Lì** (鬲),
while the **Large Intestine** and **Small Intestine** are below.
They are distant and do not lie close to one another.

What is the **Lì** (鬲)?
Why are some **palaces** near and others far?
The **Canon** states that the **Heart** governs **Nourishing** (荣) while the **Lungs** govern **Defensive** (卫),
circulating **Yang Qi** (阳气) throughout.
Thus, they reside above.
The upper region follows the **Celestial** (天),
as **Heaven** is **Yang**,
and the **Heart** and **Lungs** are above the **Lì**.
The **Heart** governs **blood**, which is **Nourishing**,
and the **Lungs** govern **qi**, which is **Defensive**.
**Yang** ascends to the upper body,
and the **Heart** and **Lungs** circulate **Yang Qi**,
so they are located above.
The **Large Intestine** and **Small Intestine** transmit and descend **Yin Qi** (阴气),
so they reside below.
The lower region follows the **Earth** (地),
as **Earth** is **Yin**,
and both the **Large Intestine** and **Small Intestine** are below the **Lì**.
They transmit and channel **Yin Qi** downward,
so they reside in the lower region.
This is why they are distant and not nearby.

The **Heart** and **Lungs** circulate **Yang Qi**,
while the **Large Intestine** and **Small Intestine** transmit **Yin Qi**,
so they are distant and not nearby.

Again, the **Six Palaces** (六府) are all **Yang**,
residing in **clear-cold** (清冷) regions.
The **Six Palaces** are all **Yang**,
as **Yang** is **Qi**,
and the **Three Yang Meridians of the Hands and Feet** are the pathways for **Qi** to circulate.
**Yang** is the most **clear-cold**,
so they are called **clear-cold** regions.

Now, why do the **Large Intestine**, **Small Intestine**, **Stomach**, and **Bladder**
all receive **unrefined** (不争) substances?
What is the meaning of this?
The **Large Intestine** transmits **unrefined** (不冷) **water and grain**,
the **Small Intestine** receives and stores **unrefined** (不冷) **water and grain**,
the **Stomach** contains **unrefined** (不冷) **water and grain**,
and the **Bladder** stores **fluids** (津液) that are **unrefined** (不冷).
Only the **Gallbladder** is **clear-cold**—what is its meaning?

Yet, the **Six Palaces** are those of **right and wrong** (是非).
Speaking of **right and wrong**,
each **Palace** has its distinct function—this is **right**.
The **Small Intestine** is a **Palace**—this is **wrong**.
Why is it so?
Though the **Small Intestine** is paired with the **Heart** as its surface counterpart,
its governance and **Qi** are distinct.
Though its **Qi** is distinct,
its primary function is different,
so though it is called **Heart Qi**,
it does not have a separate **Heart** position.
Thus, it is **wrong**.

The **Canon** states that the **Small Intestine** is the **Palace of Receipt and Storage** (受盛之府).
It receives and stores the **Stomach**’s refined **water and grain**,
accepts **unrefined** (糟粕) substances,
and after further refinement,
transmits them into the **Large Intestine**.
The **Large Intestine** is the **Palace of Transmission and Passage** (传写行道之府).
The **Large Intestine** transmits and channels **unrefined** (不洁) substances,
making them the pathways for their flow.

The **Gallbladder** is the **Palace of Clear-Cold** (清争之府).
It lies beneath the **Liver**’s shorter leaf (短叶闲).
The **Liver**’s **Qi** circulates to the **eyes**,
and when the **eyes** are harmonized,
one discerns **white and black** (白黑).
The **Gallbladder**, as the **Liver**’s **Palace**,
prefers **clear-cold** above all.

The **Stomach** is the **Palace of Water and Grain** (水谷之府).
It functions as the **granary** (仓库),
and is also governed by the **Lungs**.
All **water and grain** gather here.

The **Bladder** is the **Palace of Fluids** (津液之府).
**Fluids** (津) are the perspired essence that exceeds regulation,
while **liquids** (液) are those that seep into empty cavities,
lingering and not flowing freely.
The **Bladder** stores these **fluids**.

Each **Palace** does not have two names,
so it is known to be **wrong**.
Why should there be two names for one **Palace**?
The **Small Intestine** is the **Palace of the Heart**,
as it is the **Heart**’s **Zàng** **Palace**.
The **Large Intestine** is the **Palace of the Lungs**,
as it is the **Lungs**’ **Zàng** **Palace**.
The **Stomach** is the **Palace of the Spleen**,
as it is the **Spleen**’s **Zàng** **Palace**.
The **Gallbladder** is the **Palace of the Liver**,
as it is the **Liver**’s **Zàng** **Palace**.
The **Bladder** is the **Palace of the Kidneys**,
as it is the **Kidneys**’ **Zàng** **Palace**.

The **Small Intestine** is called the **Red Intestine** (赤肠),
as the **Heart**’s color is **red**.
The **Large Intestine** is called the **White Intestine** (白肠),
as the **Lungs**’ color is **white**.
The **Gallbladder** is called the **Green Intestine** (青肠),
as the **Liver**’s color is **green**.
The **Stomach** is called the **Yellow Intestine** (黄肠),
as the **Spleen**’s color is **yellow**.
The **Bladder** is called the **Black Intestine** (黑肠),
as it governs the **lower burner** (下焦).
The **Kidneys**’ color is **black**,
so the **Bladder** is the **Black Intestine**,
residing in the **lower burner**.

Thirty-Sixth Difficulty says: The **Zàng** each have one **ear** (耳).
The **Liver**, **Spleen**, **Lungs**, and **Heart** each have one.
The **Kidneys** alone have two—why is this?
Why do the **Kidneys** have two?

Yet, the two **Kidneys** are not both **Kidneys**.
The two **Kidneys** are not both truly **Kidneys**.
One is the **Kidney**,
and one is the **Gate of Life** (命门).
The left one is the **Kidney**,
and the right one is the **Gate of Life**.

Speaking of males,
the left is the **Kidney**,
and the right is the **Gate of Life**.
The **Gate of Life** is the **portal to one’s vital essence** (生命之门),
and the **right Guǐ** (尺) is the **Minister Fire** (相火),
which commands the **Master Fire** (君火) of the **Gate of Life**.
All **spirit and essence** (神精) reside here.

The **Gate of Life** has a **pore** (穴),
located in the **14th vertebral segment** (十四椎节).
There are also two **Chambers of the Will** (志室),
situated below the **14th vertebral segment**,
three inches on either side.
A **spirit** (神) guards the **Gate of Life**,
preventing evil from entering the **Chambers of the Will**.

**Reside** (舍) means **abode** (宅).
**Spirit and essence** dwell here.
It is where the **Original Qi** (原气) strikes.

**Original** (原) means **source** (元).
**Original Qi** arises at **Child** (子),
which is the **Kàn** (坎) position.
**Kàn** is the **parental essence** (父母之元气),
as **Qián** (乾) is **Heaven** (天) and **Father** (父),
while **Kūn** (坤) is **Earth** (地) and **Mother** (母).
Now, **Kàn**’s **sixth line** (初六) and **third line** (六三)
are **Kūn**’s **sixth line** and **third line**.
**Kàn**’s **second line** (九二)
is **Qián**’s **second line**.
It is said that **Qián** and **Kūn** interact at **sixth line** (六三) and **second line** (九二),
forming the **Kàn** hexagram,
and thus **Original Qi** is anchored to the **Kidneys**.

Hence, males store **essence** (精).
The **Five Zàng** and **Six Palaces** overflow with **essence and Qi** (精气),
which then **percolate** (淫溢) and **irrigate** (掺灌) the **Kidneys**.
The **Kidneys** receive and store this **essence**.
Each of the **Five Zàng** has its own **essence**,
which is directed to the **Kidneys** as needed.
The **Kidneys** serve as the **capital** (都会),
the **gatekeeper** (关司) of the body,
where all **essence** is stored.

Females **strike** (击) the **uterus** (胞),
so it is known that the **Kidneys** have but one.

**Thirty-seventh Difficulty** asks:
The **Qi** of the **Five Zàng**—where does it originate?
From what source does the **Qi** of the **Five Zàng** arise?
Where does it circulate?
And where does it circulate again?
Can this be understood without doubt?
Can this principle be clearly grasped?

**Response:** The **Qi** of the **Five Zàng** is linked to the **Nine Orifices** above the **Upper Pass** (上关).
The **Nine Orifices** are the ears, eyes, mouth, nose, anterior and posterior **Yīn** (阴), totaling seven **Yáng** orifices and two **Yīn** orifices.
The **Five Zàng** govern them.
Thus, **Lung Qi** circulates through the nose.
The nose is the **orifice** of the **Lungs**,
through which **Lung Essence and Qi** flow.
A harmonized nose discerns fragrances and foul odors.
When the **Five Zàng** enter the nose,
they are stored in the **Heart** and **Lungs**.
If the **Heart** or **Lungs** are diseased,
the nose will fail to function properly.
If the **Lungs** are harmonized,
then the nose is harmonized,
and the nose discerns fragrances and foul odors.

**Liver Qi** circulates through the eyes.
The eyes are the **orifice** of the **Liver**,
through which **Liver Essence and Qi** flow.
A harmonized eye discerns white and black.
**Precision and Clarity** (精明) allow one to perceive all things,
distinguish white from black,
and judge length from shortness.
If one mistakes the long for short,
and white for black,
then **Essence** is diminished.
Now, if the **Liver’s Essence and Qi** flow through the eyes,
and the eyes are harmonized,
then one discerns white and black.

**Spleen Qi** circulates through the mouth.
The mouth is the **orifice** of the **Spleen**,
through which **Liver Essence and Qi** also flow.
A harmonized mouth discerns the flavors of grains.
All people drink and eat,
yet few truly know taste.
The **Spleen** and **Stomach** are the **sea of water and grains** (水谷之海).
If the **Spleen** and **Stomach** are harmonized,
then the mouth is harmonized,
and one knows the flavors of grains.

**Heart Qi** circulates through the tongue.
The tongue is the **orifice** of the **Heart**,
through which **Heart Essence and Qi** flow.
A harmonized tongue discerns the **Five Flavors** (五味).
**Pungent, Sweet, Sour, Bitter, and Salty** are the **Five Flavors**.
If the **Heart** is harmonized,
then the tongue is harmonized,
and one can discern the **Five Flavors**.

**Kidney Qi** circulates through the ears.
The ears are the **orifice** of the **Kidneys**,
through which **Kidney Essence and Qi** flow.
A harmonized ear discerns the **Five Tones** (五音).
**Gōng, Shāng, Jiǎo, Zhēng, and Yǔ** are the **Five Tones**.
If the **Kidneys** are harmonized,
then the ears are harmonized,
and one can discern the **Five Tones**.

If the **Five Zàng** are not harmonized,
then the **Nine Orifices** do not circulate.
When the **Five Zàng** are not harmonized,
**Perverse Qi** (邪气) cannot be externally expelled,
and thus the **Nine Orifices** become obstructed and fail to circulate.

If the **Six Palaces** are not harmonized,
then **stagnation** (留结) forms **abscesses** (瘫).
The **Six Palaces** are **Yáng** in nature.
If **Yáng Qi** cannot internally circulate,
it stagnates and accumulates,
forming **abscesses** (瘫疽).

If **Perverse Qi** resides in the **Six Palaces**,
then the **Yáng Meridians** are not harmonized.
The **Six Palaces** belong to **Yáng**,
and the **meridians** beneath the **skin and muscles** are **Yáng Meridians**.
If **Perverse Qi** lingers in the **Six Palaces**,
then the **meridians** beneath the **skin and muscles** are not harmonized.
If the **Yáng Meridians** are not harmonized,
then **Qi** stagnates.
**Yáng** is **Qi**, ruling the exterior—
if the **meridians** beneath the **skin and muscles** are not harmonized,
then **Perverse Qi** lingers in the **skin and pores** and does not disperse.
If **Qi** stagnates,
then the **Yáng Meridians** become excessive.
If **Perverse Qi** lingers,
then the **Yáng Meridians** grow disproportionately strong.

If **Perverse Qi** resides in the **Five Zàng**,
then the **Yīn Meridians** are not harmonized.
The **Five Zàng** belong to **Yīn**,
and the **meridians** beneath the **muscles and flesh** are **Yīn Meridians**.
If **Perverse Qi** lingers in the **Five Zàng**,
then the **meridians** beneath the **muscles and flesh** are not harmonized.
If the **Yīn Meridians** are not harmonized,
then **blood** stagnates.
**Yīn** is **blood**, ruling the interior—
if the **meridians** beneath the **muscles and flesh** are not harmonized,
then **blood-perverse** (血邪) lingers in the **flesh and sinews**.
If **blood** stagnates,
then the **Yīn Meridians** become excessive.
If **blood-perverse** lingers,
then the **Yīn Meridians** grow disproportionately strong.

If **Yīn Qi** is excessively strong,
then **Yáng Qi** cannot nourish the exterior,
and this is called **Obstruction** (隔).
**Obstruction** means **rejection** (拒).
If the interior is blocked,
then the **Yáng Meridians** cannot enter,
and thus when **Yīn** is excessively strong,
**Yáng Qi** cannot nourish the exterior,
and this is called **Obstruction-Rejection** (隔拒).

If **Yáng Qi** is excessively strong,
then **Yīn Qi** cannot nourish the interior,
and this is called **Closure** (关).
**Closure** means **blockage** (闭).
If the exterior is blocked,
then the **Yīn Meridians** cannot exit,
and thus when **Yáng** is excessively strong,
**Yīn Qi** cannot nourish the interior,
and this is called **Closure**.

If both **Yīn** and **Yáng** are excessive,
they cannot mutually nourish each other,
and this is called **Closure-Obstruction** (关隔).
The interior and exterior fail to support each other,
and this is **Closure-Obstruction**.

What a person possesses is **Qi** and **blood**.
**Qi** is **Yáng**, and **blood** is **Yīn**.
Sometimes both are excessive,
sometimes both are deficient,
sometimes one is excessive while the other is deficient,
and all these conditions lead to disease.

The **Canon** states that **Qi** alone circulates through the **Five Zàng**,
yet does not nourish the **Six Palaces**—why is this so?
It asks: How can **Qi** circulate solely through the **Five Zàng**,
and yet not nourish the **Six Palaces**?

**Response:** The circulation of **Qi** is like water flowing,
never ceasing.
**Qi** flows ceaselessly, like water,
never resting day or night.
Thus, the **Yīn Meridians** nourish the **Five Zàng**.
The **Five Zàng** belong to **Yīn**,
so the **Yīn Meridians** reside within them.

The **Yáng Meridians** nourish the **Six Palaces**.
The **Six Palaces** belong to **Yáng**,
so the **Yáng Meridians** reside within them.

Like a ring with no end,
its beginning is unknown.
**Qi** and **blood** circulate endlessly like a ring,
with no discernible start or finish.
It ends and yet begins anew.
In one day and night,
**Qi** and **blood** conclude their cycle at the **Liver**,
and the next day at **Gèn** hour (艮时) they begin anew at the **Lungs**.

They do not **overflow** or **cover**.
If all **Yīn** is insufficient,
**Yáng** will **intrude** (乘),
causing **overflow** (覆).
Again, if **Yáng** intrudes into the **inch** (尺),
this is also **overflow**.
If all **Yáng** is insufficient,
**Yīn** will **extrude** (出),
causing **excess** (溢).
Again, if **Yīn** rises to the **fish** (鱼) position,
this is also **excess**.
Now, if **Yīn** and **Yáng** each remain in their proper measure,
there will be no **overflow** or **excess**.

**Human Qi** internally warms the **Zàng** and **Fǔ**.
If **Yīn** and **Yáng** do not **overflow** or **extrude**,
then **human Qi** can internally harmonize the **Zàng** and **Fǔ**.
Externally, it **percolates** (溢) into the **victorious pores** (胜理).
**Victorious pores** refer to the **hair follicles** and **skin texture** (毛孔及文理).
Externally, it can **moisten and nourish** the **victorious pores**,
making them smooth and supple.

**Chapter Sixty of the *Degree Numbers of the Zàng and Fǔ*** (藏府度数第六十首)
**Thirty-eighth Difficulty** states:

**Chapter Sixty of the *Degree Numbers of the Zàng and Fǔ* (藏府度数第六十首)**

**Thirty-eighth Difficulty (三十八难)** continued:
Why are there five **Zàng** but six **Fǔ**?
Though there are five **Zàng**, how can there be six **Fǔ**?
Yet, the reason there are six **Fǔ** is the **San Jiāo** (三焦).
The **Fǔ** alone have six because the **San Jiāo** is also one **Fǔ**.
There is a distinction in **Yuan Qi** (原气).
**Yuan Qi** was discussed in the previous chapter.
The **San Jiāo** converges **Qi** at the **Shèn** (肾).
The **Shèn** is the **Zheng** (正) of **Yuan Qi**, while the **San Jiāo** is the **Bié** (别) of **Yuan Qi**.
It governs all **Qi**.
It is called **Qi Hǎi** (气海) in the middle, located in the **Upper Jiāo** (上焦).
Again, the **Qi Hǎi** acupuncture point lies two *cùn* below the navel, in the **Lower Jiāo** (下焦).
It maintains the **Qi** of the entire body.
It has a name but no form.
The **San Jiāo** is merely **jīn mò** (筋膜), attached to the upper, middle, and lower openings of the **stomach**.
Though it bears the name **San Jiāo**, it lacks its true form.
Its **jing** (经) belongs to the **Shǒu Shǎo Yáng** (手少阳).
Its **meridian** belongs to the **Shǒu Shǎo Yáng** meridian.
This is an **external Fǔ**.
The **San Jiāo** has no **internal Fǔ**, only a meridian named **Shǒu Shǎo Yáng**, hence it is called an **external Fǔ**.
Thus, it is said there are six **Fǔ**.
Because the **San Jiāo** is also one **Fǔ**, it is said there are six **Fǔ**.

**Thirty-ninth Difficulty (三十九难)** states:
The **Classics** say there are five **Fǔ**: the **Dǎn** (胆), **Wèi** (胃), **Dà Cháng** (大肠), **Xiǎo Cháng** (小肠), and **Páng Guāng** (膀胱).
Yet, there are six **Zàng**: the **Gān** (肝), **Xīn** (心), **Pí** (脾), **Fèi** (肺), **Shèn** (肾), and **Mìng Mén** (命门).
Why?
Yet, the six **Fǔ** are truly five **Fǔ**.
The **San Jiāo** is added to make six, but in reality, there are five **Fǔ**.
Yet, the five **Zàng** can also be six **Zàng** because the **Shèn** has two **Zàng**.
The five **Zàng** are six because the **Shèn** externally has the **Mìng Mén**, making six in total.
The left side is the **Shèn**, the right side is the **Mìng Mén**.
The **Mìng Mén** is where **spirit** (神) resides.
In men, it stores **jīng** (精); in women, it anchors the **fetus** (胞).
This is detailed in the **Thirty-sixth Difficulty** (三十六难).
Its **Qi** communicates with the **Shèn**.
The **Mìng Mén Qi** is connected to the **Shèn Qi**.
Thus, it is said there are six **Zàng**.
Because of the **Mìng Mén** externally, it is said there are six **Zàng**.

Why are there five **Fǔ**?
Though the **Zàng** have six, why are there only five **Fǔ**?
Yet, each of the five **Zàng** corresponds to one **Fǔ**.
One **Zàng** is paired with one **Fǔ**, making five **Fǔ** in total.
The **San Jiāo** is also one **Fǔ**, yet it does not belong to the five **Zàng**.
The **San Jiāo** is one **Fǔ**, paired with the **Xīn Bāo Luò** (心包络) as **Zàng**, but unrelated to the five **Zàng**.
Thus, it is said there are five **Fǔ**.
Because the **San Jiāo** is not a true **Fǔ**, it is said there are five **Fǔ**.

**Fortieth Difficulty (四十难)** states:
The **Classics** say the **Gān** governs **color**.
The **Gān** is **Mù** (木).
The **huā** (华) and **è** (萼) of **Mù** display the five **colors**.
The **Xīn** governs **odor**.
The **Xīn** is **Huǒ** (火).
The transformation of **Huǒ** produces the five **odors**.
Of the five **odors** in humans, the **Xīn** governs them all.
The **Pí** governs **taste**.
The **Pí** governs **sweetness**; sweetness receives **taste**, hence it governs **taste**.
The **Fèi** governs **sound**.
The **Fèi** is **Jīn** (金).
**Jīn** embodies **sound**, so the five **tones** all emerge from the **Fèi**.
The **Shèn** governs **fluids**.
The five **fluids** all derive from **water**, and the **Shèn** governs **water**, hence it governs **fluids**.
The **nose** is the **candidate** (候) of the **Fèi**, yet it discerns **aroma and odor**.
Though the **Fèi** governs **sound**, the **nose** belongs to the **Fèi** and cannot hear **sound**, yet it discerns **aroma and odor**.
The **ear** is the **candidate** of the **Shèn**, yet it hears **sound**.
Though the **Shèn** governs **fluids**, the **ear** belongs to the **Shèn** and does not pertain to **saliva and tears**, yet it can hear **sound**.
What is the reasoning behind this?
Why does the **nose** and **ear** function thus?

Yet, the **Fèi** is the **Xī Fāng Jīn** (西方金).
The **Fèi** belongs to **Xī Fāng** (西方) **Gēng Xīn Jīn** (庚辛金).
**Jīn** is generated in **Sì** (巳).
**Jīn**’s **Cháng Shēng** (长生) phase is in **Sì**.
**Sì** is **Nán Fāng Huǒ** (南方火).
**Sì-Wǔ-Wèi** (巳午未) belong to **Nán Fāng Huǒ**, with **Sì** being the **Zhèng** (正) of **Nán Fāng Huǒ**.
**Huǒ** is the **Xīn**.
**Nán Fāng Huǒ** corresponds to the **Xīn** among the **Zàng**.
The **Xīn** governs **odor**, and its governance lies in the five **odors**.
Thus, the **nose** knows **aroma and odor**.
The **nose** belongs to the **Fèi**, and **Fèi Jīn** is generated in the position of **Xīn Huǒ**, hence it can distinguish the **odors** governed by **Xīn Huǒ**.

The **Shèn** is the **Běi Fāng Shuǐ** (北方水).
The **Shèn** belongs to **Běi Fāng** (北方) **Rén Guǐ Shuǐ** (壬癸水).
**Shuǐ** is generated in **Shēn** (申).
**Shuǐ**’s **Cháng Shēng** phase is in **Shēn**.
**Shēn** is **Xī Fāng Jīn**.
**Shēn-Yǒu-Xū** (申酉戌) belong to **Xī Fāng Jīn**, with **Shēn** being the **Lín Guān** (临官) position.
**Jīn** is the **Fèi**.
**Xī Fāng Jīn** corresponds to the **Fèi** among the **Zàng**.
The **Fèi** governs **sound**, and its governance lies in **sound**.
Thus, the **ear** hears **sound**.
The **ear** belongs to the **Shèn**, and **Shèn Shuǐ** is generated in the position of **Fèi Jīn**, hence the **ear** can hear **sound**.

**Forty-first Difficulty (四十一难)** states:
Why does the **Gān** alone have two **leaves**?

「Why does the **Liver** alone have two **leaves**, and what does this correspond to?

Indeed: the **Liver** is the **束方 Wood** (束方木).
The **Liver** belongs to the **束方 Jia-Yǐ Wood** (束方甲乙木).
**Wood** is the **Spring** (春).
**Spring** is the time when **Wood** begins to flourish (木发生之时).
All things begin to grow, yet they are still young and tender.
The **Liver**’s **roots** and **teeth** are in their initial stage of sprouting (黄牙甲萌动之始), still young and not yet fully formed.
Its **intent** (意) has no close affinity.
When all things first emerge, they stand upright and independent, with nothing to cling to.
It is still near the **Tài Yīn** (太阴).
The twelve **channels** (经) interrelate, with the **Foot Jué Yīn** (足厥阴) near the **Tài Yīn** (太阴), hence the proximity.
It is not far from the **Tài Yáng** (太阳).
The **Foot Jué Yīn** (足厥阴) **Wood** of the **Shao Yáng** (少阳) phase generates the **Hand Tài Yáng** (手太阳) **Shao Yīn** (少阴) **Fire** (火), hence the **Liver** remains close to the **Tài Yáng** (太阳).
It still possesses two **hearts** (心).
When it flows into the **Tài Yīn** (太阴), it bears the **heart** of fearing **Metal** (金), and when it arises from the **Tài Yáng** (太阳), it bears the **heart** of generating **Fire** (火).
Thus, it has two **leaves**.
Because it has two **hearts**, it has two **leaves**.
This also corresponds to the **Wood leaves** (木叶).
The **Liver leaves** (肝叶) are in alignment with the **Wood leaves** (水应木叶).

**Forty-second Difficulty (四十二难)** states:
What are the lengths of the human **stomach** and **intestines** (肠胃), and how much **water and grain** (水谷) do they each receive?

The lengths of the human **stomach** and **intestines** (肠胃), and the amounts of **water and grain** (水谷) they receive, are as follows:

Indeed: the **Stomach** (胃) is vast, measuring **one chi five cun** (一尺五寸).
The **Stomach** (胃) is the **receptacle** (围), receiving **water and grain** (水谷).
Its **circumference** (大) is **one chi five cun** (一尺五寸).
Its **diameter** (径) is **five cun** (五寸).
The **diameter** (径) is **five cun** (计五寸).
Its **length** (长) is **two chi six cun** (二尺六寸).
The **length** (长) is **two chi six cun** (计二尺六寸).
When **bent horizontally** (横屈), it receives **three dou five sheng** (三斗五升) of **water and grain** (水谷).
One **bend** (横) and one **fold** (屈) together receive **three dou five sheng** (三斗五升).
Within it, **two dou** (二斗) of **grain** and **one dou five sheng** (一斗五升) of **water** are always retained.
Its **content** (其中常留) holds **two dou** (谷二斗) of **grain** and **one dou five sheng** (水一斗五升) of **water**, which are conveyed through the **Small Intestine** (小肠).
The **Small Intestine** (小肠) is vast, measuring **two cun three fen** (二寸半).
The **intestine** (肠) is the **passageway** (畅), allowing the **Stomach qi** (胃气) to flow and removing impurities (去滓秽).
The **Small Intestine** (少肠) has a **circumference** (大) of **two cun three fen** (计二寸半).
Its **diameter** (径) is **eight fen** (八分), minus a **small half** (分之少半).
The **diameter** (径) is **eight fen half** (计八分半).
Its **length** (长) is **three zhang two chi** (三丈二尺).
The **length** (长) is **three zhang two chi** (计三丈二尺).
It receives **two dou four sheng** (二斗四升) of **grain** from the **Stomach**.
It receives **two dou four sheng** (胃中谷计二斗四升) of **grain** from the **Stomach**.
It receives **six sheng three he** (水六升三合) of **water**, minus a **large half** (合之太半).
It receives **six sheng three he half** (水计六升三合半) of **water**.

The **Large Intestine** (大肠), also called the **reciprocal intestine** (回肠), is named so because it curves and twists.
The **Large Intestine** (大肠) has a **circumference** (大) of **four cun** (四寸).
Its **diameter** (径) is **one cun half** (一寸半).」

The **diameter** (径) is **one cun half** (计一寸半).
Its **length** (长) is **two zhang one chi** (二丈一尺).
Its **length** (长计) is **two zhang one chi** (计二丈一尺).
It receives **one dou** (一斗) of **grain** and **seven sheng half** (七升半) of **water**.
From the **Stomach**, **water and grain** total **three dou five sheng** (三斗五升), which are transmitted into the **Small Intestine**, where **grain remains four dou** (谷剩四斗) and **water decreases by eight sheng six he half** (水少八升六合合之少半).
When transmitted further into the **Large Intestine**, the **water and grain** are each reduced by **one dou** (各减一斗).
At this point, **water** enters the **bladder** (膀胱), while **grain** is transmitted to the **anus** (肛门).

The **Rectum** (广肠), also called the **terminal intestine** (肢肠) or **anus** (一名肛门), has a **circumference** (大) of **four cun** (四寸).
Its **diameter** (径) is **two cun half** (二寸半).
Its **diameter** (径计) is **two cun half** (径计二寸半).
Its **length** (长) is **two chi eight cun** (二尺八寸).
Its **length** (长) is **two chi eight cun** (计二尺八寸).
It receives **nine sheng three he eight fen half** (九升三合八分合之一) of **grain** from the **Large Intestine** and transmits it out, totaling **nine sheng three he eight fen half** (受大肠之谷而传出，计九升三合八分合之一).

Thus, the total **length** of the **intestines and stomach** is **five zhang eight chi four cun** (五丈八尺四寸).
Combining the **Stomach, Small Intestine, Large Intestine,** and **Rectum**, the total **length** is **five zhang eight chi four cun** (总计胃、小肠、大肠、广肠，共计五丈八尺四寸).
The total **water and grain** they receive is **eight dou seven sheng six he eight fen half** (合受水谷八斗七升六合八分合之).
This is the total **measure of water and grain** in the **intestines and stomach** (总计肠胃水谷之数).
This describes the **length and capacity** of the **intestines and stomach** for **water and grain** (此肠胃长短，受水谷之数也).
Summarizing again, the **length and water-grain totals** are as stated (再总言长短水谷数).

The **Liver** (肝) weighs **four jin four liang** (四斤四两).
The **Liver** is the **"dry"** (干) organ—its structure resembles a **trunk with branches** (於体状有枝干).
Its weight is **four jin four liang** (计四斤四两).
It has **three lobes on the left** (左三叶) and **four on the right** (右四叶).
The **left three lobes** belong to **Jia (甲)** and **Yang** (属阳), while the **right four lobes** belong to **Yi (乙)** and **Yin** (属阴).
In total, there are **seven lobes** (凡七叶).
The **Liver** governs **Jueyin** (足厥阴) and corresponds to **Zhaoyang** (足少阳), whose numerical association is **seven** (少阳之数剧於七), hence the **seven lobes**.
It stores the **Soul** (魂).
*(See Annotation 34 for further explanation.)*

The **Liver** stores the **will/intent** (志). *(See Annotation 34 for further explanation.)*

The **Gallbladder** is located at the **short lobe of the Liver** *(#17 Question)*. The **Gallbladder**, **dǎn** (胆), is **bold** (敢), meaning it contains **bold-qi** (胆气), which is **resolute and daring**. It is generated in the **two small lobes of the Liver** *(#17 Question)*. It weighs **three liang three zhu** (三两三铢). The **Gallbladder** is calculated to weigh **three liang three zhu**. It holds **three sheng of essence-fluid** (精汁).

The **Bladder** should curve sixteen times to the right of the navel, winding with sixteen bends. It holds **one dou of grains** and **seven sheng and a half of water**. *(See previous section for further explanation.)*

The **Bladder** weighs **nine liang two zhu**. *"Páng"* means horizontal; *"guāng"* means broad. Its body is short yet horizontally broad. It is also called *"pāo"*—*"pāo"* means boot, and a boot is hollow, used to hold fluids. Its weight is **nine liang two zhu**. Its vertical width is **nine cun**—a total of **nine cun**. It stores **nine sheng nine ge of urine**. It holds **nine sheng nine ge of urine**. Its mouth is **two cun and a half** wide—its mouth measures **two cun and a half** in width. From lip to teeth, it is **nine fen** long. The distance from the mouth to the epiglottis is **three cun and a half** deep, with a capacity of **five ge**. The epiglottis is the throat’s barrier; when water and food descend, it presses down with breathing. The depth from mouth to epiglottis measures **three cun and a half**, with a maximum capacity of **five ge**.

The tongue measures **seven cun** in length.

Its width is **two cun and a half**—a total of **two cun and a half** in breadth.

The **throat gate** weighs **ten liang**.
The throat gate, *"yàn"* (咽), is the throat itself, capable of swallowing food.
It is also called the **passage of speech**—where the flow of *qi* is most critical for communication.
The throat gate governs **Earth-qi**, weighing **ten liang** in total.
Its width is **two cun and a half**—a total of **two cun and a half** in breadth.
From the throat gate to the stomach, it is **sixteen cun** long.

It can receive **nine sheng three ge eight fen** of food.
(See annotation in the previous section.)
The **Forty-Third Difficulty** states:

「Why does a person die within seven days if they neither eat nor drink?
If one does not consume food and water, how can they survive beyond seven days before death?

Yet:
The stomach always retains **two dou** of grain and **one dou five sheng** of water.
Without roots or nourishment, food and drink are essential to life.
The stomach is the **sea of water and grain**, and when it receives water and grain, it retains **three dou five sheng**.
Thus, an average person urinates **twice daily**.
The **凤** (*feng*), meaning **wind** or **urination**, is the place of discharge.
An average person urinates twice daily, removing **two sheng and half** each time.
By midday, they expel **five sheng**.
If they urinate twice more by day’s end, they remove another **two sheng and half**, totaling **five sheng** daily.
Seven days:
Within seven days.
Five times seven:
Seven sets of **five sheng**.
Thus, **three dou five sheng** of water and grain are exhausted.
Each urination removes **five sheng**, so within seven days, **three dou five sheng** of water and grain are depleted.
Therefore, an average person dies within seven days without food or drink because their **water and grain essence** (*jinye*) are all spent, and thus they die.
All cases where an average person dies after seven days without food or drink are due to the exhaustion of **water and grain essence** (*jinye*), hence death.

**The Forty-Fourth Difficulty** asks:
Where are the **Seven Orifices** (*Qichuangmen*) located?
The **orifices** (*chong*) refer to pathways of passage and discharge for the **organs and bowels** (*zangfu*).
Where are the **Seven Orifices** (*Qichuangmen*)?

Yet:
The **lips** are the **Flying Orifice** (*Feimen*).
The lips belong to the **spleen** (*pi*), and they are dynamic in motion.
It is said that the lips receive water and grain, then transform them inward.

The **teeth** are the **Gate Orifice** (*Mumen*).
The mouth and teeth are the pathways for the **heart-qi** (*xinqi*).
In the heart, they manifest as **intent** (*zhi*); when spoken, they become **words** (*yan*), hence the teeth are the **orifices of the heart**.
They also serve to **crush and subdue** the five grains, passing them inward.

The **stomach** is the **Respectful Orifice** (*Binmen*).
**Respectful** (*bin*) refers to the **steamer** (*ge*), where the stomach-qi discharges.
The stomach transmits **grain-qi** (*guqi*) to the lungs, and since the **steamer** (*ge*) is above the stomach, it is called the **Respectful Orifice**.

The **epiglottis** is the **Inhaling Orifice** (*Ximen*).
The epiglottis serves as the **orifice for the sounds of the five organs** (*zang*).

The **lower opening of the great stomach** (*Dacangxiakou*) is the **Dark Orifice** (*Youmen*).
The **great stomach** (*dacang*) refers to the stomach.
Its lower opening lies three **cun** below the **navel** (*qi*), a hidden and obscure location, hence the **Dark Orifice**.

The **junction of the large and small intestines** is the **Barrier Orifice** (*Lanmen*).
**Junction** (*hui*) means **union**.
Where the large and small intestines meet, they **separate water and grain essence from vital blood**, each returning to their proper place—hence the **Barrier Orifice**.

The **lower extreme** is the **Soul Orifice** (*Pomen*).
The **Soul Orifice** (*pomen*) refers to the **anus** (*gāng*).
Lung-qi ascends through the throat and descends through the anus—this is the pathway of lung-qi.
The lungs **house the soul** (*po*), thus it is called the **Soul Orifice**.
Hence, they are called the **Seven Orifices**.

So it is said that the **Seven Orifices** are the seven pathways of passage and discharge for the **organs and bowels**.

**The Forty-Fifth Difficulty** asks:
Why does the Classic speak of the **Eight Convergences** (*Bahui*)?
How do the **organs** (*zang*), **bowels** (*fu*), **tendons** (*jin*), **bones** (*gu*), **marrow** (*sui*), **blood** (*xue*), **vessels** (*mai*), and **qi** converge?

Yet:
The **bowels converge at the great stomach** (*Fu hui dacang*).
The **convergence** (*hui*) of the **foot field** (*zuchang*)—where the **stomach** (*wei*) and **spleen** (*pi*) meet—
the **hand greater yang** (*shoutaiyang*) **small intestine** (*xiao chang*),
the **hand lesser yang** (*shao taiyang*) **triple burner** (*san jiao*),
and the **conception vessel** (*ren mai*) meet—
is originally called the **middle courtyard** (*zhongyuan*), the **great stomach** (*dacang*), and the **suction point** (*zhuo mu*).
The stomach transforms **qi** and nourishes the six bowels, hence it is called the **convergence**.

The **organs converge at the lateral ribs** (*Zang hui jixie*).
The **lateral ribs** (*jixie*) are the **soft ribs** (*ruan xie*).
At their ends lies a **suction point** (*mu*), which belongs to the **spleen**.
The **foot lesser yin** (*zue jinyin*) and **foot lesser yang** (*zue jinyin*) converge here—
hence, it is called the **convergence of the organs at the lateral ribs**.

The **tendons converge at Yanglingquan** (*Jin hui yanglingquan*).
The **Yanglingquan** (*yanglingquan*) **suction point** lies one **cun** above the **knee** (*xiguan*), in the **popliteal fossa** (*kang*).
It is where the **qi of the foot lesser yang** (*zue shaoyang*) **gallbladder** (*dan*) **bowel** discharges.

The **marrow converges at Juegu** (*Sui hui juegu*).
**Juegu** is the name of a **bone**.
Its **suction point** lies four **cun** above the **external ankle** (*waixu*), at the **yangzhen** (*yangzhen*) **suction point**.
It is also where the **qi of the foot lesser yang** (*zue shaoyang*) **bowel** discharges.

The **blood converges at Gegu** (*Xue hui gegu*).
The **gegū** (*gegū*) **suction points** are two points on the back,
below the seventh vertebra, each one and a half **cun** from the sides.
They are where the **qi of the foot greater yang** (*zue taiyang*) **bladder** (*pangguang*) **bowel** discharges.

The **bones converge at Dayu** (*Gu hui dayu*).
The **dayu** (*dayu*) **suction point** lies beside the first vertebra at the back of the neck,
each one and a half **cun** from the sides.
It is where the **qi of the foot greater yang** (*zue taiyang*) **bowel** discharges.

The **vessels converge at Taiyuan** (*Mai hui taiyuan*).
The **Taiyuan** (*tai yuan*) **suction point** lies within one **cun** of the right **wrist** (*zhang*), at the **fish际** (*yujie*).
It is where the **qi of the hand lesser yin** (*shoutaiyin*) **lung** (*fei*) **bowel** discharges.

The **qi converges at the Triple Burner** (*San jiao*), externally along a **tendon** leading to the **two breasts** (*liang ru*).
The **upper burner** (*shang jiao*) lies below the heart, and the **middle burner** (*zhong jiao*) is above the stomach.
The **lower burner** (*xia jiao*) is below the **navel** (*qi*), one and six-tenths **cun** beneath the **玉堂** (*yutang*).
It aligns with the **two breasts’ depression** (*liang ru guan xian*), which is the **膻中** (*dan zhong*) **suction point**.

It is said that **qi** from the **丹中** (*dan zhong*)—the **ministerial messenger’s office** (*chen shi zhi guan*)—
emanates from the **sea of qi** (*qi hai*), then spreads downward to irrigate all the **organs**.
For internal **heat diseases** (*re bing*), one takes the **convergence suction points** (*hui zhi qixue*) externally.
If the **heat disease** (*re bing*) lies within, one externally targets its **convergence suction points** (*hui zhi qixue*)
to dispel the illness.

**The Forty-Sixth Difficulty** asks:
Why do the elderly lie awake while the young sleep soundly?
Why do the elderly remain **unsettled** (*bu an*) and **unable to sleep** (*bu mei*) when lying down,
while the young, though they sleep, do not awaken?
Why do the elderly and young behave oppositely?

Yet:
The Classic says that the young are **abundant in blood and qi**.
The young are vigorous in the flow of **blood and qi**.
Their **flesh and muscles are smooth**.
Their **skin and muscle tissues are supple and moist**.
Their **qi pathways are open**.
The routes for **blood and qi** are unobstructed.
The **circulation of nourishing and defensive** (*rong wei*) **qi** is regular and unerring.
The harmony of **Heaven and Earth** (*tian di*) and the interplay of **sun and moon** (*ri yue*)
—**winter** is the **dark season** of the four seasons,
and **night** is the **winter** of a day—
the **awakening and sleeping** (*mei mei*) of humans align with these cosmic rhythms.
Since the young have not yet diminished their **defensive qi** (*wei qi*), their **awakening and sleeping** match the **yin and yang** of Heaven and Earth.
Thus, they are **spiritually alert** (*jing*) during the day but **sleep soundly** at night.

The elderly have **weakened blood and qi**.
Their **flesh and muscles are dry**.
Their **qi pathways are sluggish**.」

「When the **blood and qi** pathways become **sluggish** (*se*), their **egress and ingress** fail to follow the proper **cosmic timing** (*shí*).
Thus, the elderly cannot be **spiritually alert** (*jing*) during the day and cannot **sleep soundly** at night.

By day, they cannot find **tranquility** (*ān jìng*), and by night, they cannot **rest** (*miàn*).
Hence, it is known that the elderly cannot **sleep soundly**.

When **defensive qi** (*wei qi*) **emerges**, they **awaken**; when it **retires**, they **sleep**.
But since the **defensive qi** of the elderly has **waned** (*shuāi*), they cannot **sleep soundly** at night.

*Huangdi Baishiyi Nan Jing Muyu Jujie Jie卷之六* (compiled by Lu Guo, Qin Yue, and Ren Zi from the *Nan Jing* commentary by Lin Chang’s *Xuanzi* and Li Ao’s *Yejie*)」

**Question Forty-Seven:** Why is it that only the human face can endure cold?

The head and face alone can withstand cold—how so?

**Explanation:** The head is the convergence of all the **Yang** pathways. *(See the diagram: "The Head as the Convergence of All Yang Pathways.")*

All the **Yin** vessels ascend only to the neck and chest before descending. The **Hand Minor Yin** (Heart channel) originates from the heart’s pericardial region beside the throat, ascends to the lungs, emerges beneath the armpit, and descends along the inner posterior aspect of the upper arm. The **Foot Minor Yin** (Kidney channel) rises from the kidneys, pierces the liver and diaphragm, enters the lungs, follows the throat, interconnects with the heart, and converges in the chest. The **Hand Major Yin** (Lung channel) originates from the lungs, emerges beneath the armpit, and descends along the inner upper arm. The **Foot Major Yin** (Spleen channel) ascends from the stomach through the diaphragm and converges in the heart. The **Hand Jueyin** (Pericardium channel) courses through the chest, emerges at the ribs, descends three *cun* below the armpit, and follows the inner upper arm. The **Foot Jueyin** (Liver channel) ascends through the diaphragm, spreads across the ribs, and follows the posterior throat.

Only the **Yang** pathways ascend to the head and ears. The **Yin** pathways do not reach the head—only the **Yang** pathways do. Thus, the face can endure cold.

Since **Yang qi** resides in the head and face, it can withstand cold.

*(Section: "Discerning Empty, Full, Evil, and True" #1)*

**Question Forty-Eight:**

There are three kinds of **emptiness** and **fullness** in a person—how so?

There are three kinds of emptiness and three kinds of fullness in a person. Thus:

There is the **emptiness and fullness of the pulse**. The pulse has emptiness and fullness.
There is the **emptiness and fullness of the disease**. Disease has emptiness and fullness.
There is the **emptiness and fullness of diagnosis**. Diagnosis has emptiness and fullness.

The **emptiness and fullness of the pulse**:
A **soft** pulse is **emptiness**; a **tight and firm** pulse is **fullness**.
A soft pulse is **Yin emptiness**, hence called **emptiness**; a tight and firm pulse is **Yang fullness**, hence called **fullness**.

The **emptiness and fullness of disease**:
There are three kinds.
**Outward manifestations** are **emptiness**; **inward manifestations** are **fullness**.
First, **Yin and Yang** govern the **inner and outer**—now if **Yang is insufficient**, **Yin** surges outward to dominate, hence **outward** is **emptiness**. If **Yin is insufficient**, **Yang** invades inward to dominate, and **Yang** prevails externally, hence **inward** is **fullness**.
**Speech** is **emptiness**; **silence** is **fullness**.
Second, the **lungs govern voice**; when **voice enters the heart**, it is **speech**, hence **emptiness**. The **liver governs planning**; when it enters the heart, there is **no speech**, hence **silence** is **fullness**.
**Sluggishness** is **emptiness**; **urgency** is **fullness**.
Third, **Yang governs emptiness**, and **Yang** is **urgent**; **tight and tense skin** is **fullness**. **Yin governs stillness**, and **Yin** is **sluggish**; **loose and relaxed skin** is **emptiness**.

The **emptiness and fullness of diagnosis**:
There are four kinds.
A **soft** pulse is **emptiness**; a **firm** pulse is **fullness**.
That is, **soft and relaxed skin** is **emptiness**; **tight and strong skin** is **fullness**.
**Itching** is **emptiness**; **pain** is **fullness**.
Second, **general itching** is **emptiness**; **localized pain** is **fullness**.
**External pain with internal relief** is **external fullness and internal emptiness**.
Third, if **light pressure causes pain**, it is **external fullness**—the disease is shallow. If **heavy pressure brings relief**, it is **internal emptiness**—the disease is deep.
**Internal pain with external relief** is **internal fullness and external emptiness**.
Fourth, if **heavy pressure causes pain**, it is **internal fullness**—the disease is deep. If **light pressure brings relief**, it is **external emptiness**—the disease is shallow.

Thus it is said: **emptiness and fullness**.

Moreover, in summary:

**The Forty-Nine Difficulties:**

There are diseases arising from the **True Channels** themselves.
When the **True Channels** are **empty**, the **remaining tendons** slacken.
When the **victorious tendons** slacken, the ailment **emanates internally** and does not originate externally.

There are diseases caused by **external pathogens** invading the **True Channels**.
The **Five Phases** counter one another—**evil** enters from without.
How may they be distinguished? How are these two cases differentiated?

It is said:
**Worry, grief, and overthinking** injure the **Heart**.
The **Heart** governs **spirit**—the sovereign of the **Five Viscera**, the source of **cleverness** and **intuitive wisdom**.
Excessive **grief and labor** weaken the **Heart**, and when the **Heart** is injured, the **spirit** grows feeble.

**Cold exposure and excessive drinking** injure the **Lungs**.
The **Lungs** govern **skin and fur**—when the body is cold, the **skin and fur** are chilled.
They also receive **fluids and grains**; excessive drinking harms them, and the **Lungs** detest cold, hence it is said they are injured.

**Anger and rebellious *qi*** injure the **Liver**.
The **Liver** governs **planning and foresight**; the **Gallbladder** governs **courage and decisiveness**.
Though anger stems from **will**, if it is excessive, injury may occur.

**Overindulgence in food and exhaustion** injure the **Spleen**.
Doubling one’s usual intake harms the **intestines and stomach**.
When food is consumed to excess, the **stomach’s *qi*** becomes full, and the **Spleen’s vessels** are often strained.
Or, from **riding swiftly, leaping, or excessive sexual activity**, the **Spleen** may also be injured.

**Prolonged sitting in damp places or excessive exertion in water** injures the **Kidneys**.
The **loins** are the **Kidneys’ domain**; prolonged sitting obstructs the **Kidney *qi*** from flowing freely, hence damage occurs.
The **Kidney’s acupuncture point** lies at the **sole of the foot**, named **Yǒngquán (Surging Spring)**.
Residing in damp places also causes harm.
**Excessive exertion** refers to lifting heavy objects or drawing a bow;
**Entering water** refers to crossing water and falling, or **breathing difficulties** arising from the **Kidneys**, or a woman whose **menstrual flow has not ceased** yet engaging in intercourse.
These are diseases arising from the **True Channels** themselves.

These five cases are all **self-inflicted by the True Channels**—all classified as **other evils**.
What are called the **Five Evils**?
*(Referring to external pathogens affecting the Five Viscera.)*

There is **Wind Invasion**.
*"Invasion"* means injury.
The **Liver** corresponds to **Wind**; when evil disperses through the **Five Viscera**, it manifests as **five colors**.
If **Wind** injures in **Spring**, lingering evil leads to **chronic diarrhea**.

There is **Summerheat Injury**.
**Summerheat** favors the **Heart**; when evil enters the **Five Viscera**, it produces **five odors**.
If **Summerheat** injures in **Summer**, **Autumn** brings **wasting and intermittent fever**.

There is **Overindulgence in Food and Exhaustion**.
The **Spleen** governs **taste**; when evil enters the **Five Viscera**, it manifests as **five flavors**.
*(Previously, self-inflicted by the True Channels referred to overindulgence and exhaustion.)*
Now, the **Five Evils** also mention **overindulgence and exhaustion**.
Disease from the **True Channels** refers to **emptiness** in the **True Channels**.
Additionally, **Five Evils** injure through **food and drink**, meaning **disease arises from overindulgence damaging the Spleen**.

There is **Cold Injury**.
The **Lungs** govern **dryness**, and their **order is pure and sharp**.
The **Lungs** govern **sound**; when evil disperses into the **Five Viscera**, it produces **five sounds**.
The **Lungs** govern **skin and fur**, detest cold—if **Cold** injures in **Winter**, **Spring** brings **warm diseases**.

There is **Dampness Invasion**.
The **Kidneys** govern **water** and **dampness**; when evil enters the **Five Viscera**, it manifests as **five fluids**.
If **Dampness** injures in **Autumn**, it **rebels upward**, causing **coughing**, and manifests as **wasting and tetany**.

These are the **Five Evils**.
These five diseases originate externally.

Suppose the **Liver** is diseased.
If the **Liver** does not **receive** disease, how do we know it was caused by **Wind Invasion**?
*(Asking about the cause of Wind Invasion.)*

It is said:
Its **color should be green**.
**Wind** corresponds to **Perseverance (Xùn)**, belongs to **Wood**, and its color is **green**.
How is this known?
The **Liver** governs **color**.
The **flower and calyx of Wood** spread the **five colors**, generating the **Five Evils**.
When **Wind** enters internally, it manifests as **green**.
*(Self-inflicted by the True Channels.)*
When it enters the **Heart**, it becomes **red**.
When **Liver evil** enters the **Heart**, its color turns **red**.
When it enters the **Spleen**, it becomes **yellow**.
When **Liver evil** enters the **Spleen**, its color is **yellow**.
When it enters the **Lungs**, it becomes **white**.
When **Liver evil** enters the **Lungs**, its color is **white**.
When it enters the **Kidneys**, it becomes **black**.
When **Liver evil** enters the **Kidneys**, its color is **black**.
Since the **Liver** is the **Heart’s evil**, it is known that the **color should be red**.
The **Liver** governs **Wind**; the **Heart** governs **Summerheat**.
Now, if the **Heart** is diseased by **Wind Invasion**, it is known that **Liver evil** has invaded the **Heart**.
The disease presents as **feverish body** and **distended, painful flanks**.
The **Heart** governs **Summerheat**; when diseased, the body **fevers**.
The **Liver** spreads across the **flanks**, hence **flank distension**.
Its **pulse** is **floating, large, and taut**.
A **floating, large pulse** belongs to the **Heart**; a **taut pulse** belongs to the **Liver**.

How do we know it was caused by **Summerheat Injury**?
*(Asking about the cause of Summerheat Injury.)*

It is said:
It **dislikes foul odors**.
The **Heart** governs **Summerheat** and **odors**.
The **Heart** governs **odors**.
The **Heart** is **Fire**; the **transformations of Fire** produce **odors**.
When **Fire** enters internally, it becomes **scorched odor**.
**Fire’s** nature is to **flame upward**, generating **bitter, scorched** qualities—*(self-inflicted by the True Channels.)*
When it enters the **Spleen**, it becomes **fragrant odor**.
**Fire** transforming **Earth** yields a **fragrant** odor.
When it enters the **Liver**, it becomes **irritating odor**.
**Fire** transforming **Wood** yields an **irritating** odor.
When it enters the **Kidneys**, it becomes **putrid odor**.
**Fire** transforming **Water** yields a **putrid** odor.
When it enters the **Lungs**, it becomes **rancid odor**.
**Fire** transforming **Metal** yields a **rancid** odor.
Thus, when the **Heart** is diseased by **Summerheat Injury**, it **dislikes foul odors**.
Because the **Heart’s** disease stems from **Summerheat Injury**, it **dislikes foul odors**.
The disease presents as **feverish body, restlessness, and heart pain**.
*(See the sixteenth difficulty for annotation.)*
Its **pulse** is **floating, large, and scattered**.
The **Heart’s** self-inflicted pulse is **floating**.

How do we know it was caused by **overindulgence in food and exhaustion**?
*(Asking about the cause of overindulgence and exhaustion.)*

It is said:
It **craves bitter flavors**—when **empty**, it **lacks appetite**; when **full**, it **desires food**.
The **Spleen** governs **taste**, hence it is known.
When the **Spleen Channel** is **empty**, there is **no appetite**; when **full**, there is **desire for food**.
How is this known?
*(Asking about preferred flavors.)*
The **Spleen** governs **taste**.
The **Spleen** governs **sweetness**; **sweetness** receives **flavor**, hence it governs **taste**.
When it enters the **Liver**, it becomes **sour**.
When **Spleen evil** overcomes the **Liver**, it **craves sour**.
When it enters the **Heart**, it becomes **bitter**.
When **Spleen evil** overcomes the **Heart**, it **craves bitter**.
When it enters the **Lungs**, it becomes **spicy**.
When **Spleen evil** enters the **Lungs**, it **craves spicy**.
When it enters the **Kidneys**, it becomes **salty**.
When **Spleen evil** enters the **Kidneys**, it **craves salty**.
When it enters internally, it **craves sweet**.
*(Self-inflicted by the True Channels, hence it craves sweet.)*
Thus, it is known that **Spleen evil** has entered the **Heart**, causing a **craving for bitter flavors**.
The **Heart** governs **heat injury**; the **Spleen** governs **exhaustion**.
Now, if the **Heart’s** disease arises from **overindulgence and exhaustion**, it is known that **Spleen evil** has entered the **Heart**, causing a **craving for bitter flavors**.

The illness manifests as **fever with a heavy body**, aversion to wind, and **limbs failing to withdraw**.
Fever belongs to the **Heart**, heaviness to the **Spleen**, and governs the **limbs’ inability to contract**.
Its pulse is **floating, large, and slack**.
A **floating, large pulse** belongs to the **Heart**; **slackness** belongs to the **Spleen**.
How do we know it arises from **cold damage**?
Asking about **cold damage**.
Indeed: **delirious speech and incoherent words** will occur.
Once injured by cold, speech should become **delirious and incoherent**.
How so?
How does speech become **delirious and incoherent**?
The **Lungs govern voice**. When **Metal** is struck, sound emerges, hence the **Five Tones** arise from the **Lungs**.
When it enters the **Liver**, it becomes **groaning**.
**Wood fears Metal**, hence **groaning**.
When it enters the **Heart**, it becomes **speech**.
**Metal and Fire** correspond; **husband and wife** meet, hence **speech and laughter**.
When it enters the **Spleen**, it becomes **singing**.
**Earth**, as mother to **Metal** and child to **Metal**, when mother and child meet, hence **singing**.
When it enters the **Kidneys**, it becomes **moaning**.
**Metal** is mother to **Water**; when child meets mother, it emits **soft, plaintive sounds**.
When it enters internally, it becomes **weeping**.
The **Lungs govern Autumn**; **Autumn brings sorrow**. Its tone is **Shang**, and **Shang** is **injury**.
Thus, it weeps of its own accord.
Hence, it is known that **Lung evil** has entered the **Heart**, causing **delirious, incoherent speech**.
The **Heart governs heat**; the **Lungs govern cold**.
**Delirious, incoherent speech** all stems from **Lung evil entering the Heart**.

The illness manifests as **fever, aversion to alcohol and wind**, and in severe cases, **wheezing and coughing**.
Fever belongs to the **Heart**; aversion to cold and **wheezing/coughing** belong to the **Lungs**.
Its pulse is **floating, large, and rough**.
A **floating, large pulse** belongs to the **Heart**; **roughness** belongs to the **Lungs**.
How do we know it arises from **damp damage**?
Asking about the cause of **damp damage**.
Indeed: **excessive sweating that cannot be stopped** will occur.
Once injured by dampness, **spontaneous sweating** will not cease.
How so?
How does **spontaneous sweating** occur?
The **Kidneys govern dampness**. The **Kidneys govern water**; water flows as dampness, and the **Five Dampnesses** all arise from the **Kidneys**.
When it enters the **Liver**, it becomes **weeping**.
**Grief and sorrow** move the **mind**, injuring the **spirit**; when the **spirit** is injured, it is moved to **weep**.
It is said the **Lungs govern sorrow**; sorrow causes **Metal excess**, and **Wood fears it**.
**Water** is the **mother of Wood**; when the mother is troubled, the child ceases to thrive.
Thus, the **Liver** enters as **weeping**.
When it enters the **Heart**, it becomes **sweating**.
**Water and Fire** harmonize; their interaction **steams as sweat**.

When it enters the **Spleen**, it becomes **drooling** (salivation).
**Earth** is the **husband** of **Water**, and **Water** follows **Earth** to generate **drooling**.

When it enters the **Lungs**, it becomes **nasal mucus** (rhinorrhea).
The **North** generates **Cold**; **Cold** generates the **Kidneys**.
Now, **Cold** affects the **skin and hair**, and internally converges with the **Lungs**.
When the **Lungs** are **Cold**, **nasal mucus** flows.
When it enters the **Liver** itself, it becomes **spitting** (ptyalism).
The **Kidney’s pulse** ascends to connect with the **tongue**,
so when the **Liver** itself is diseased, it manifests as **spitting**.

Thus, it is known that **Liver evil** entering the **Heart** causes **spontaneous sweating** that cannot cease.
Thus, it is known that **spontaneous sweating** that does not cease is all due to **Liver evil** entering the **Heart**.

When the disease presents with **body heat** but **lower abdomen pain** and **cold-induced leg cramps**,
**body heat** with **Heart** disease—all others are **Kidney** diseases—see the **Sixteen Difficulties** (of the *Yellow Emperor’s Inner Canon*).
Its pulse is **deep and soft** yet **large**.
**Large** indicates **Heart** **fullness** (excess),
**deep and soft** indicates **Kidney** **fullness** (excess).
This is the law of the **Five Evils** (五邪).
The **pulse patterns of the Five Evils** are thus measured.

The **Fifty Difficulties** (of the *Yellow Emperor’s Inner Canon*) say:
There are **Vacuous Evils**, **Solid Evils**,
**Thief Evils**, **Micro Evils**, and **Direct Evils**—how do they differ?
Asking of these **Five Evils**, where do they distinguish?

Now:
**Evil** coming from what follows is **Vacuous Evil**.
When the **Heart** governs its time, the pulse should be **surging and large** yet **long**,
but instead it is **taut and small** yet **urgent**—this is the **Liver** governing **thought**,
**Wood** transmitting to the **Heart**, seizing the **Heart’s governance**.
This is the **Liver** overpowering the **Heart**,
hence the saying "coming from what follows."
The **Liver** is the **mother** of the **Heart**;
when the **mother** overpowers the **child**, this is **Vacuous Evil**.

**Evil** coming from what precedes is **Solid Evil**.
The **Heart**’s governance is taken by **Spleen fullness** (excess),
and when the **Heart**’s governance is complete, it should transmit to the **Spleen**.
Now, the **Heart**’s governance is not yet complete,
so the **Spleen** comes prematurely to seize its governance—
hence the saying "coming from what precedes."
The **Spleen** is the **child** of the **Heart**;
when the **child** overpowers the **mother**, this is **Solid Evil**.

**Evil** coming from what does not conquer is **Thief Evil**.
**Fire** does not conquer **Water**,
but now **Kidney** **fullness** (excess) comes to overpower—
hence it is **Thief Evil**.

**Evil** coming from what does conquer is **Micro Evil**.
**Fire** conquers **Metal** (金),
so when the **Heart** is diseased and **Lung fullness** (excess) comes to overpower,
it is called **Micro Evil**.

**Evil** arising from itself is **Direct Evil**.
When the **Heart** governs its time, **fullness** (excess) should not be overbearing,
nor should **emptiness** (deficiency) be too weak—
this is **Direct Evil**.
And there are no other **evils** overpowering it.

How so?

「Further inquiry: If the **Heart** is afflicted by **heat** (暑), it is **Direct Evil**.
The **Heart** governs **summer heat** (暑), and when it is itself diseased by **heat** (暑), this is **Direct Evil**.

Excessive **diet and exertion** (饮食劳倦) result in **Solid Evil**.
When **Evil** comes from what precedes, the **Spleen** overpowers the **Heart**—hence it is **Solid Evil**.

Affliction by **cold** (寒) results in **Micro Evil**.
When **Evil** comes from what does conquer, the **Lung** overpowers the **Heart**; the **Lung** governs **cold** (寒), and it also fears the **Heart**—hence it is **Micro Evil**.

Excessive **dampness** (湿) results in **Thief Evil**.
When **Evil** comes from what does not fully conquer, the **Kidney** overpowers the **Heart**; the **Kidney** governs **dampness** (湿), and **Water** subdues **Fire**—hence it is **Thief Evil**.

The *Fifty-One Difficulties* (五十一难) states:
There are those who, when sick, **desire warmth** (欲得温).
There are those who, when sick, **desire warm and sheltered places** (欲得温暖之处).
There are those who **desire cold** (欲得寒).
There are those who, when sick, **desire cold and freezing places** (欲得寒冻之处).
There are those who **desire to be seen by others** (欲得见人).
There are those who, when sick, **desire to be seen by others** (欲与人相见).
There are those who **do not desire to be seen by others** (不欲得见人).
There are those who, when sick, **do not desire to be seen by others** (不欲与人相见).
Yet each case varies.
Their desires differ.»

Where does the illness reside—within the **zàng** (藏) or **fǔ** (府)?

The afflicted **zàng** (藏) and **fǔ** (府) are as follows:
Yet: those who, when sick, **desire to be seen by others** (欲得见人), have their illness in the **fǔ** (府). The **fǔ** (府) governs all **illnesses of excess** (府万物病在府), hence they desire to be seen by others.

Those who **desire warmth** (欲得温) but **do not desire to be seen by others** (不欲得见人), have their illness in the **zàng** (藏). The **zàng** (藏) belong to **yin** (阴), and **yin** illnesses desire warmth, hence they seek warmth but avoid being seen by others.

How so? Again inquired: **fǔ** (府) are **yang** (阳). The Six **fǔ** (府) belong to **yang** (阳). **Yang** illnesses desire cold, yet also wish to be seen by others. The **hand’s three yin meridians and three yang meridians** (手三阴三阳) correspond to Heaven, governing **dryness** (暄者燥), hence they seek cold and desire to be seen by others.

The **zàng** (藏) belong to **yin** (阴). The Five **zàng** (藏) belong to **yin** (阴). **Yin** illnesses desire warmth. The **foot’s one yin meridian and three yang meridians** (足一阴三阳) correspond to Earth, governing **illnesses of cold and warmth** (主病寒温), hence they desire warmth. They also wish to **retreat into seclusion alone** (闭户独处), for **yin** governs the interior, hence they seek to **retreat into seclusion alone from the exterior** (独处於外). They **loathe hearing human voices** (恶闻人声), for **yin** governs stillness, hence they loathe hearing human voices.

Thus, one may distinguish between **zàng** (藏) and **fǔ** (府) illnesses by their desires.

Thus, one may **discriminate between zàng (藏) and fǔ (府) illnesses by their desires**.

The *Fifty-Two Difficulties* (五十二难) states:
Are the **fǔ** (府) and **zàng** (藏) illnesses rooted in the same origin? When **fǔ** (府) and **zàng** (藏) illnesses manifest, do they share the same root cause?

Yet: they are not the same. **Final Answer**: They are never the same.

How then do they differ? *How* do they differ?

Yet: **Zàng** illnesses **remain fixed and do not shift**. **Zàng** illnesses belong to **yin**, and **yin** governs stillness, hence they remain fixed and do not move. Their illness does not depart from its place. The illness remains in one place and does not stray.

**Fǔ** illnesses, however, **manifest diffusely and surge onward**. **Fǔ** illnesses belong to **yang**, and **yang** governs motion, hence their manifestations surge and rush upward. They flow upward or downward. Their dwelling is not constant. The illness does not remain fixed in one place but wanders without a fixed abode.

**The Eighth Transmission of Zàng-Fǔ Illnesses** (藏府传病第八)
The *Fifty-Third Difficulty* states:

The classics say: *"Seven transmissions bring death."* (经言七传者死)
See *Discriminating Doubts* (详见辩疑) for details.

**Transmission** refers to the Five Phases generating in sequence—counting to five, then recounting back to two, making seven. The five ascend to transmit to seven, and seven is subdued, hence it is said.

**Transmission to a zàng** means life. (间藏者生)
*Transmission* question: What does it mean for one **zàng** to transmit?

How can transmission be the same, yet life and death differ?

Yet: **Seven transmissions** mean transmitting to what **conquers** it. Transmitting to the **zàng** that subdues it, hence it is called **seven transmissions**.

**Transmission to a zàng** means transmitting to its **child**. Transmitting to the **zàng** it generates, hence it is called **transmission to a zàng**.

Why then is it called **one transmission**? (何以一甭之？) *Another question.*

**Transmission of Organ Diseases**

Suppose the heart is diseased and transmits to the lungs. Water, wood, fire, earth, and metal—fire is the fifth phase—overcomes the sixth phase, earth, and metal is subdued by fire, so death ensues. The rest follow this pattern accordingly.

The lungs transmit to the liver. Metal subdues wood. The liver transmits to the spleen. Wood subdues earth. The spleen transmits to the kidneys. Earth subdues water. The kidneys transmit to the heart. Water subdues fire.

One organ does not repeatedly transmit harm. For instance, if the heart transmits to the lungs, and the lungs die without further transmission, then the transmission halts at one organ, and the first organ does not transmit again. Thus, it is said that seven transmissions lead to death.

**Seven transmissions** mean death. The seventh transmission means death.

**Transmission to an organ** means transmitting to its offspring. The mother can generate the child, and when an organ transmits to its child, it is called *transmission to an organ*.

For example, if the heart’s disease transmits to the spleen: the heart transmits to the spleen, and the spleen receives the *generative qi*, which is the mother-child transmission, hence it is called *generation*.

The heart overcomes the lungs, and the spleen transmits to them. The spleen overcomes the kidneys, and the lungs transmit to them. The lungs overcome the spleen, and the kidneys transmit to them. The kidneys overcome the heart, and the liver transmits to them. The liver overcomes wood, and the heart transmits to it.

Thus, the mother and child mutually transmit and cycle endlessly, like an unbroken ring, hence it is called *generation*.

The mother and child mutually transmit and cycle endlessly, yet there is no final exhaustion, hence there is the principle of *eternal generation*.

**The 54th Question:** Organ diseases are difficult to treat. Why are diseases of the five *zàng* (solid organs) the most difficult to cure?

Diseases of the six *fǔ* (hollow organs) are easier to treat. How so?

Thus: Organ diseases are difficult to treat because they transmit to what overcomes them. The liver overcomes the spleen, the spleen overcomes the kidneys, the kidneys overcome the heart, the heart overcomes the lungs, and the lungs overcome the liver—hence they are difficult to treat.

Diseases of the hollow organs are easier to treat because they transmit to their offspring. Wood transmits to fire, fire transmits to earth, earth transmits to metal, metal transmits to water, water transmits to wood, and wood *inversely* generates wood—hence they are easier to treat. This follows the same principle as *seven transmissions* and *transmission to an organ*.

This aligns with the methods of the previous chapter.

**The 92nd Question on Organ Accumulation:** The 55th Question asks: How do we distinguish between *accumulation* and *conglomeration* diseases?

There are diseases of accumulation and diseases of conglomeration—how do we differentiate them?

Thus: *Accumulation* refers to *yin qi*. When *yin qi* congeals, it forms accumulation.

*Conglomeration* refers to *yang qi*. When *yang qi* gathers, it forms conglomeration.

Thus, *yin* is deep and latent. *Yin* by nature is still, often submerged and hidden within.

*Yang* is superficial and dynamic. *Yang* by nature is active, floating and manifesting above.

Where *qi* accumulates, it is called *accumulation*. Where *qi* gathers, it is called *conglomeration*.

Thus, *accumulation* arises from the five *zàng* (solid organs). *Accumulation* is *yin qi* from the five *zàng*—when they transmit to what overcomes them, and the *Way* does not gather them, they congeal and form *accumulation*.

They have a fixed starting point. The liver accumulates in the left flank, the lungs in the right flank, the heart above the navel, the kidneys below the navel, and the spleen in the middle of the bladder region—each has its fixed location.

Their pain does not stray from its region. The ache remains localized to its respective area.

They have defined upper and lower limits. The heart’s region extends upward to the navel, the kidneys downward to the navel—each has its defined limits.

They have defined left and right boundaries. The left flank and right flank each have their own defined regions.

*Conglomeration* refers to *yang qi*. The six *fǔ* (hollow organs) belong to *yang*, and the five conglomerations are formed by *yang qi*.

Their onset has no root. When the illness begins, there is no fixed origin.

They do not linger above or below. The *qi* that gathers shifts unpredictably, never remaining fixed above or below the navel.

Their pain has no fixed location—this is called *conglomeration*. The ache is not confined to a single region, hence it is called *conglomeration*.

Thus, we distinguish between *accumulation* and *conglomeration* based on whether they originate from the *zàng* or *fǔ*.

**The 56th Question:** Do the five *zàng* (solid organs) each have their own named *accumulations*?

*Accumulation* means *stagnation*. When blood and *qi* do not flow freely and stagnate, it forms disease. Do they each have their own names?

By which month and day are they acquired?

「By which month and day does one acquire this *accumulation*?

Now, the *accumulation* of the liver is called *féiqì* (肥气).
*Féiqì* is like the appearance of fat and abundant flesh—this is the liver’s *accumulation*, often manifesting as a slight distension with frequent occurrences.
It appears in the left lateral costal region, like a cup inverted over it, with a distinct head and foot.
It originates in the left lateral costal area, then **#35** spreads outward like an inverted cup, protruding with a clear head and foot.
If left untreated for long, it does not heal.
If it persists for long without proper relief, it fails to resolve.
It causes one to develop coughing, reverse breathing, **lump** (瘤), and **ague** (疟), year after year without cessation.
It leads to **#34** wheezing, reverse breathing, **emaciation** (瘠), and **ague**, enduring through successive years without abating.
It is acquired in the **late summer** (季夏) on days *wù-jǐ* (戊己日).

Late summer is the sixth month, when the spleen—**#36** the sovereign of earth—holds its peak.
*Wù-jǐ* are earth days, and since the spleen’s **#36** *qi* is sovereign in late summer, it does not receive evil.
Thus, the liver’s *accumulation* is obtained on *wù-jǐ* days.
Why is this so?
The liver receives *féiqì* on *wù-jǐ* days.
When lung illness spreads to the liver,
The five *zàng* transmit illness to their respective **#37** dominants; initially, the lung’s illness affects the liver, as lung metal **#37** overcomes liver wood, so the lung transmits its evil to the liver.
The liver should then transmit it to the spleen.
Since liver wood **#38** overcomes spleen earth, the liver does not receive the lung’s evil, and so transmits it to the spleen.
The spleen, in its sovereign state during late summer, does not receive evil.
Late summer is the time when the spleen—**#36** the sovereign of earth—holds its peak, and thus does not receive the evil transmitted by the liver.
The liver, having failed to transmit the evil, **#39** seeks to return it to the lung.
The liver, unable to transmit the evil due to the spleen’s sovereignty, thus **#39** refuses to align with the pulse’s natural flow.
The lung refuses to receive it, so the evil remains and congeals into an *accumulation*.
The lung also refuses to receive it, so the evil lingers and congeals, forming the *féiqì* *accumulation*, which grows and solidifies, and the illness thus develops.
Hence, one knows that *féiqì* is acquired in late summer on *wù-jǐ* days.
Hence, one knows that in the sixth month on *wù-jǐ* days, the *féiqì* *accumulation* is obtained.

The *accumulation* of the heart is called *fúlìang* (伏梁).
*Fúlìang* is like the beams and rafters of an old house—this is the heart’s *accumulation*.
It rises from the **#32** *qí* (齐) above, swelling as large as an arm, then ascends to the heart’s lower region.
It **#32** begins at *qí* above, swelling to the size of an arm, and then **#33** ascends in reverse to the heart’s lower region.
If left untreated for long, it does not heal.
If it persists for long without proper relief, it fails to resolve.**»**

*«It vexes the mind. It causes the heart’s lower region to be vexed by *fúlìang* **#40**.
Hence, one knows that *fúlìang* is acquired in autumn on *gēng-xīn* **#41** days.
In autumn, the month of *xuán* **#41** (弦) and *tún* (豚), when *jīn* **#41** (金) is in power and *wáng* **#41** (王) rules, *gēng-xīn* are the days of *jīn*—thus, *fúlìang* is obtained on *gēng-xīn* days.
How does one know this? *Fúlìang* is acquired on *gēng-xīn* days.

When kidney illness transmits to the heart, it first subtly affects the kidney.
Kidney water overcomes heart fire, so *fúlìang* is obtained.
The heart should then transmit to the lungs.
If the heart does not receive the kidney’s evil, heart fire overcomes lung *jīn* **#41**, and it should transmit to the lungs.
In autumn, the lungs rule, and *wáng* **#41** (王) does not receive evil.
In the month when lung *jīn* **#41** rules, it does not receive the evil transmitted by the heart.
The heart then desires to return to the kidney.
With the lungs ruling in autumn and not receiving evil, the heart again seeks to transmit back to the kidney.
If the kidney cannot **#42** receive it, it congeals and forms an *accumulation*.
If the kidney does not receive it, then *fúlìang* **#40** thus congeals and forms an *accumulation*.
Hence, one knows that *fúlìang* is acquired in autumn on *gēng-xīn* days.
Hence, one knows that in autumn on *gēng-xīn* days, the *fúlìang* *accumulation* is obtained.

The *accumulation* of the spleen is called *pǐqì* (痞气).
*Pǐ* (痞) means stagnation.
Stagnation congeals into an *accumulation*—this is the spleen’s *accumulation*.
It lodges in the stomach’s precincts, swelling as large as a plate.
*Pǐqì* congeals over the stomach’s precincts, swelling like a plate.
If left untreated for long, it does not heal.
If it persists for long without proper relief, it fails to resolve.**»**

*«It causes the four limbs to fail in contraction.
The spleen governs the four limbs, which cannot be gathered or controlled.
It induces jaundice.
Jaundice—when the body and hands and feet all turn yellow.
Food and drink do not nourish the flesh.
The spleen and stomach are the repositories and granaries of sustenance, excelling in intake and reception, known as *shí* (食#43). [It is acquired] on winter *rén-guì* days.
Winter is the month when the kidney’s water reigns supreme; *rén-guì* are the water days, and *pǐqì* (痞气) is obtained on these days.
How so?
On *rén-guì* days, one acquires the *pǐqì* (痞气) *accumulation*.

Liver illness transmits to the spleen.
Initially, it first affects the liver; when liver wood overcomes spleen earth, it is transmitted to the liver.
The spleen should transmit to the kidney.
The spleen, not receiving the liver’s evil, with spleen earth overcoming kidney water, should transmit to the kidney.
The kidney, in winter, is the reigning organ, and the sovereign does not receive evil.
In winter, the month when kidney water reigns, it does not receive the evil transmitted by the spleen.
The spleen then desires to return to the liver.
The spleen, having balanced the kidney but not receiving the evil, again seeks to return to the liver.
The liver refuses to receive it, so it congeals and forms an *accumulation*.
The liver further refuses to receive it, so it thus congeals and forms the *accumulation* of *pǐqì* (痞气).
Hence, one knows that *pǐqì* (痞气) is acquired on *rén-guì* (壬癸) days.
Hence, one knows that on *rén-guì* days, the *pǐqì* (痞气) *accumulation* is obtained.

The lung’s *accumulation*, named *xī-bēn* (息贲).
*Xī* (息) means surface#46.
*Bēn* (贲), is *lì* (鬲). [It signifies] the lung’s *qi* stagnating above the *lì* (鬲), gradually growing and pressing against it—this is the name for lung *accumulation*.
It lodges beneath the right flank, swelling as large as a cup.
The *accumulation* covers the right flank, swelling like a cup.
If left untreated for long, it does not cease.
If it persists for long without proper relief, it does not subside.*»*

「It causes the patient to shiver with cold and heat.
When the lung is *empty* (虚), the shivering with cold is *xī* (洒淅).
When the lung is *full* (实), there is heat and oppression.
Shortness of breath and coughing indicate lung *obstruction* (壅).
If the lung is cold, the *Dao/Way* of its *qi* becomes constricted,
changing the shortness of breath and coughing into lung *obstruction*.
Hence, one knows it is acquired on *spring rén-jǐ* (甲乙) days.
In spring, the month ruled by liver *wood* (木), *rén-jǐ* (甲乙) is the *wood* (木) phase—
the *xī-bēn* (息贲) *accumulation* is obtained on *rén-jǐ* (甲乙) days.
Why so? Because *xī-bēn* (息贲) is acquired on *rén-jǐ* (甲乙) days.

When the heart is diseased, it transmits to the lung.
If one initially suffers from heart disease,
the heart *fire* (火) overpowers the lung *metal* (金),
so the disease transmits to the lung#47.
The lung should then transmit to the liver.
If the lung refuses to receive the heart’s *evil* (邪),
the *metal* (金) overpowers the *liver wood* (肝木),
and the disease should transmit to the liver#48.
The liver, in spring, is the sovereign *wood* (木) phase—
a sovereign does not receive *evil* (邪).
In spring, the month ruled by liver *wood*,
it does not receive the *evil* (邪) transmitted by the lung.
The lung then seeks to return to the heart.
Since the lung is ruled by the liver *wood* and refuses *evil*,
it again seeks to transmit back to the heart.
The heart does not accept it,
so it congeals and forms an *accumulation*.
The heart further refuses to receive it,
so it thus congeals and forms the *accumulation* of *xī-bēn* (息贲).
Hence, one knows that *xī-bēn* (息贲) is acquired on *spring rén-jǐ* (甲乙) days.
Hence, one knows that on *spring rén-jǐ* days, the *xī-bēn* (息贲) *accumulation* is obtained.

The kidney’s *accumulation*, named *bēn-tún* (贲豚).
*Bēn* (贲) means *congealed mass* (聚).
*Tún* (豚) resembles the shape of a *piglet* (豚状),
thus the name for kidney *accumulation*.
It manifests in the lower abdomen,
rising as far as beneath the heart—
its shape is like a *piglet*,
sometimes rising, sometimes descending without fixed timing.
Beginning from the lower abdomen,
it surges upward toward the heart—
its form is like a *piglet*,
now ascending, now descending at no set hour.
If left untreated for long, it does not cease.
If it persists for long without proper relief, it does not subside.»

「It causes *shortness of breath with wheezing* (喘逆).
It causes *sticky breath and wheezing* (沾息喘逆).
It leads to *weakened bones and diminished qi* (骨痿少气).
The kidney governs the bones; when bones are withered and marrow is exhausted,
it manifests as *bone weakness* (骨痿).
*Weakness* (痿) means *lack of strength* (无力).
It is acquired on *summer bǐng-dīng* (丙丁) days.

In the months when the heart’s fire reigns supreme in summer,
*bǐng-dīng* (丙丁) are the fire days—
on these days, the *bēn-tún* (贲豚) *accumulation* is obtained.
How does one know this?
One knows that on *summer bǐng-dīng* days,
the *bēn-tún* (贲豚) *accumulation* is obtained.

When the spleen is diseased, it transmits to the kidney.
Initially, the spleen’s disease is *sticky breath* (沾息),
whereby earth of the spleen overpowers water of the kidney,
thus transmitting to the kidney.
The kidney should then transmit to the heart.
The kidney does not receive the spleen’s *pathogenic influence* (邪),
as kidney water overpowers heart fire,
thus transmitting to the heart.
In summer, the heart reigns supreme—
the sovereign does not receive *pathogenic influence*.
In the months when the heart’s fire reigns supreme in summer,
it does not receive the *pathogenic influence* transmitted by the kidney.
The kidney then wishes to return to the spleen.
The kidney, though the heart reigns supreme and it does not receive *pathogenic influence*,
still wishes to transmit back to the spleen.
The spleen refuses to receive it,
thus leaving it congealed as *accumulation*—
the spleen again refuses to receive it,
so it remains congealed as the *bēn-tún* (贲豚) *accumulation*.
Hence, one knows that the *bēn-tún* (贲豚) *accumulation*
is acquired on *summer bǐng-dīng* (丙丁) days.
Hence, one knows that on *bǐng-dīng* (丙丁) days,
the *bēn-tún* (贲豚) *accumulation* is obtained.

This is the essential principle of the *Five Accumulations* (五积).
This is the essential principle of the *Five Accumulations* diseases.

**Title of the Text:** *Yellow Emperor’s Eighty-One Difficulties Canon—Illustrated and Sentence-by-Sentence Exegesis* (黄帝八十一难经慕图句解)

**The Fourteenth Poem on the *Five Discharges* (五泄) and Cold Damage (伤寒):**

**Difficulty 57:** How many kinds of *discharge* (泄) are there?
*Discharge* (泄) means diarrhea (利), but how many varieties exist?
Do they all have names?
Do they each have distinct designations?

Indeed: there are five kinds of *discharge* (泄), each with a different name.
The five varieties of diarrhea (泄利) differ in their *patterns* (令).
There is **stomach discharge** (胃泄), where the stomach meridian (胃经) causes diarrhea.
There is **spleen discharge** (脾泄), where the spleen meridian (脾经) causes diarrhea.
There is **large intestine discharge** (大肠泄), where the large intestine causes diarrhea.
There is **small intestine discharge** (小肠泄), where the small intestine causes diarrhea.
There is **large syndrome discharge** (大症泄), also called **posterior heaviness** (后重).
*痕* (痕) means *congestion* (结). When the lower abdomen (小腹) is congested (有结) but still desires diarrhea (而欲下利), this is **posterior heaviness** (后重), which is why it is named **kidney discharge** (肾泄).

**Stomach discharge** (胃泄) manifests as undigested food passing (饮食不化).
Wind enters the intestines (风入於肠), and earth *qi* (土#1) is obstructed in the stomach (土#1需於胃).
Thus, the stomach expels unprocessed food (泄所食之物), which exits prematurely and remains undigested (先出而不消化).
The stool is yellow in color (色黄).
The spleen governs earth (土), so diarrhea from spleen *qi* imbalance manifests as yellow stool (脾属土，泄利色黄).

**Spleen discharge** (脾泄) causes abdominal distension and fullness (腹胀满).
Excessive rain and dampness (雨淫腹疾) harm the spleen, and the spleen’s earth *qi* (脾土) is adversely affected by dampness (恶湿).
When dampness and spleen *qi* overpower each other (二气之胜), the abdomen swells and distends (故腹肚膨胀充满).
This results in **unregulated diarrhea** (泄注#2).
*注* (注) means without control (无节度).
Excess dampness causes **leaky diarrhea** (濡泻), as damp *qi* attacks the spleen internally (湿气内攻於脾).
This disrupts the separation of fluids and grains (水谷不分), leading to uncontrolled diarrhea (故泄利无度).
Eating triggers vomiting and belching (食即呕吐瞇).
The spleen and stomach are the *zàng-fǔ* (藏府) for digestion.
When the spleen is diseased, it cannot transform fluids and grains (化水谷), so eating causes vomiting and belching (故食则呕吐).

**Large intestine discharge** (大肠泄) manifests as **urgent postprandial diarrhea** (食已窘迫).
*窘迫* (窘迫) means **urgency** (急).
When the large intestine’s *qi* is deficient (大肠气虚), eating completes (食讫) but triggers **urgent wind-like expulsion** (昏凤#3), causing uncontrollable bowel movements (迫急不可止).
The stool is white in color (大便色白), derived from the lung’s white hue (白从肺色).
The intestines rumble with sharp pain (肠呜切痛), as if cut by a knife (肠内虚呜，如刀切其肠之痛).

**Small intestine discharge** (小肠泄) presents as **rumbling followed by purulent bloody stool** (搜而便脓血).
The small intestine is the *fǔ* (府) of the heart (心之府).
The heart generates blood (心生血), so this discharge involves bloody stool (故便血).
Pain is felt in the lower abdomen (小腹痛), where urination occurs (小便处).

**Large syndrome discharge** (大底泄) manifests as **abdominal wrapping pain and posterior heaviness** (裹急后重).
*裹急* (裹急) means **abdominal pain** (腹中痛).
*后重* (后重) means **pain at defecation** (大便处疼痛).
The patient frequently urges to defecate (数至图) but cannot (而不能便).
*囿* (囿) means **toilet** (厕).
The kidney opens into the **two yin orifices** (二阴), but when *qi* is deficient (惟气虚), the urge arises (故数思凤).
Upon reaching the toilet (及至厕), posterior heaviness prevents defecation (后重不能便).
Pain extends into the penis (茎中痛), drawing into the anterior yin orifice (前阴).

This is the **law of the Five Discharges** (五泄之法).
This is the **pathomechanism of the Five Discharges diseases** (五泄受病法度).

**Difficulty 58:** How many kinds of cold damage (伤寒) are there?
When one is struck by cold damage (中伤寒邪), how many varieties exist?
Does the pulse change?
Does the pulse (脉息) exhibit variations?

Indeed: there are five kinds of cold damage (伤寒).
There are five varieties of cold-related illnesses (五般伤病#4).
There is **wind damage** (中风).
When struck by wind *qi* (风邪), it is called **wind damage** (中风).

There is **cold damage** (伤寒).
In winter (冬), it is called **cold damage** (伤寒).
During times of severe cold (诸严寒之时), if one is exposed to cold (为寒所冒) and falls ill (其之时而病),
they experience headache, body ache, and aversion to cold on the skin (头痛身疼，肌肤而恶),
thus earning the name **Five Cold Damages** (五#5伤寒).

There is **damp-warm damage** (湿温#6).
If a person has previously suffered dampness (其人尝伤於湿),
and then contracts wind (因而中风),
with heat and cold alternating (寒热相传#7),
they develop **damp-warm damage** (湿温#8),
marked by **two meridians in opposition** (苦两经逆),
such as excessive sweating in the chest (胸多汗),
head and eye pain (头目痛),
and incoherent speech (妄言).

There is **heat illness** (热病).
In winter, if one is struck by cold (冬伤於寒),
and their *qi* later transforms into heat (因而气发为热病),
they present with fever, aversion to cold, headache, and body ache (发热恶寒，头痛身疼).

There is **warm illness** (温病).
In spring and summer (春夏月#9), when cold is clear,
and in autumn and winter (秋冬), during times of warmth and heat (有暄暑时),
if one contracts epidemic *qi* (疫疠之气),
then throughout the year (一岁之中),
the illness neither wanes nor grows (病无长少),
and its symptoms persist similarly (卒相似者).
This is the **epidemic *qi*** (时行之气),
commonly called **Great Epidemic** (大#10行).
Each variety causes distinct suffering (其所苦各不同).
The symptoms and afflictions differ accordingly (其证候所苦害不同).

The pulse of **stroke** (*zhòngfēng*) is characterized by a floating and slippery *yang* pulse, while the *yin* pulse is damp and weak. On the surface of the muscles, where the *yang* pulse travels, a light touch reveals a pulse that seems excessive. Beneath the muscles, where the *yin* pulse travels, pressing yields a deficiency—this is called weakness. Thus, when pressing yields deficiency but lifting reveals excess, one knows it is **stroke**.

The pulse of **damp-warm illness** (*shīwēn*) is damp and weak in *yang*, while the *yin* pulse is small and tense. On the surface of the muscles, where the *yang* pulse travels, dampness and weakness indicate that damp *qi* overcomes fire. Beneath the muscles, where the *yin* pulse travels, smallness and tension signify that earthly dampness cannot overcome wood.

The pulse of **cold damage** (*shānghán*) is marked by both *yin* and *yang* pulses being excessively full and tense. The *cùn* and *chǐ* pulses are both at their peak, tense and rough.

The pulse of **heat illness** (*rèbìng*) is floating in both *yin* and *yang*. The pulse of heat illness, whether at the *cùn* or *chǐ*, is floating. When floating and slippery—light pressure reveals slipperiness—this indicates that the heart is injured by heat *qi*. When pressed deeply and dispersed with roughness—heavy pressure reveals dispersion and roughness—this indicates depletion of body fluids.

The pulse of **warm illness** (*wēnbìng*) travels through all the channels, and it is unclear which channel is affected. One must follow each channel’s symptoms to diagnose it. Warm illness arises from **epidemic *qi*** (*guǐlì zhīqì*) dispersing through the channels unpredictably; it cannot be foreseen which channel is affected. Only by observing the symptoms and diagnosing accordingly can one determine the appropriate treatment.

In **cold damage**, there are cases where sweating leads to recovery, while purgation leads to death, and cases where sweating leads to death, while purgation leads to recovery. Why is this so?

When *yang* is deficient and *yin* is excessive, sweating leads to recovery, but purgation leads to death. *Yang* deficiency causes external cold, while *yin* excess also causes external cold. Cold toxins contend within the *róngwèi*, causing alternating fever and aversion to cold. The *cùn* and *chǐ* pulses are both large and floating, yet internally, there is no restlessness. If there is slight agitation, the patient prefers warm food but dislikes cold. This indicates *yang* deficiency and *yin* excess—sweating will heal, but mistaken purgation will kill.

When *yang* is excessive and *yin* is deficient, sweating leads to death, but purgation leads to recovery. *Yang* excess causes internal heat, while *yin* deficiency also causes internal heat. Cold toxins clash within the *róngwèi*, with *yang* excess and *yin* decline. Extreme *yin* transforms into *yang*, cold begets heat, and the heat *qi* surges inward, poisoning the stomach. Body fluids dry up, and dry feces accumulate. The patient does not dislike cold externally but instead feels a steaming, dry fever, and in severe cases, delirium. Purgation will heal, but mistaken sweating will kill.

How does one diagnose **cold-heat illnesses**?

If the **skin** is affected by cold and heat: The lungs govern the skin and hair, and the large intestine is its paired organ. If the *zàng* (solid organ) is diseased, it manifests as cold; if the *fǔ* (hollow organ) is diseased, it manifests as heat. The skin cannot tolerate proximity to warmth. The hands’ three *yin* and three *yang* channels follow the movements of heaven—when heaven is active, disease arises, and the patient avoids warmth. If the hair is scorched and the nose is withered, this indicates internal heart fire causing dry heat. **Do not induce sweating**—if you do, death will follow. Purgation will heal.

If the **muscles** are affected by cold and heat: The spleen governs the muscles, and the stomach is its paired organ. Disease in the *zàng* manifests as cold, while disease in the *fǔ* manifests as heat. The skin and muscles ache. The spleen governs earth, which governs dampness, and dampness flows into the joints, causing pain. The lips and tongue wither. The spleen’s essence resides in the four whites of the lips; when its fluids leak outward, they wither. There is no sweating. This disease arises from dry dampness—**do not induce sweating**, as it will obstruct the intestines and stomach. Purgation will cause diarrhea; instead, warm the center and regulate the *qi*.

If the **bones** are affected by cold and heat: The kidneys govern the bones, and the bladder is its paired organ. If the disease is in *yang*, the body is hot, with heavy aversion to cold; if in *yin*, it is cold. The patient finds no comfort in any position.

---

Sweating ceaselessly and pouring forth. The kidneys generate fluids, which enter the heart and become sweat. *Zhù* (注) means without restraint—sweat flows endlessly without pause. The teeth wither and ache. The teeth are the remnants of bone, and when the kidneys’ fluids leak outward, the roots of the teeth wither and dry, causing pain.

In the *Five Thousand Nine Difficulties* (五十九难), it is asked: How does one distinguish between *madness* (狂) and *epilepsy* (癫)?

Madness and epilepsy are inherently two distinct afflictions—how does one differentiate them? Yet:

At the onset of madness (狂之始发), it is marked by excess *yang* (重阳). Madness arises when *yang* is excessive, manifesting when the disease is in the three *yang* channels and sweat is induced inappropriately—*yang* overabundance gives rise to madness. The patient does not hunger externally (少外不饥)—they have no desire for food or nourishment from the outside world. They do not wish to sleep externally (不欲眠外)—they remain unaware of hunger or fatigue. Yet they claim their own virtue and wisdom (而自高贤也, 自辩智也)—delusively boasting of their greatness and intelligence, though their actions betray no true clarity. They act haughty and disdainful (自贵倨也)—arrogantly asserting their superiority, indulging in pride, and resenting others. They laugh wildly (妄笑), delighting in music and song (好歌乐也)—unprovoked mirth and an obsession with singing, as if it brings them joy. Their unrestrained behavior continues endlessly (妄行不休是也)—climbing heights, scaling walls, and venturing into places far beyond their ordinary capacity, with no pause in their erratic movements.

At the onset of epilepsy (癫疾始发), *癫* (epilepsy) is a form of *preten* (颠, vertigo). It begins when *yin* is excessive (重阴者). The patient’s mind is discontented (意不乐)—their spirit finds no peace.

「Directly gazing like a stiff corpse—when the eyes stare fixedly, yet the patient cannot walk or stand and instead collapses. This occurs when the pulses of all three *yin-yang* regions are both vigorous. The *cùnkǒu* pulse (寸口) belongs to the *yang* region, the *chǐ* pulse (尺) to the *yin* region, and all three pulses are strong.

The *Sixiù Nán* (六十难) states: *"Head and heart diseases"*—there are *jué* headaches (厥痛), true headaches (真痛), *jué* heart pains (厥心痛), and true heart pains (真心痛). What does this mean?

*Jué* (厥) is *líng* (玲, a sudden onset of disorder). When the three *yang* pulses of the hand (手三阳之脉) are affected by wind and cold, they stagnate and fail to flow, this is called *jué* headache. The disruptive *líng* (playing, disorderly) *qi* of wind invades the three *yang* channels, stagnates, and fails to flow, causing obstruction and a sudden surge into the head—thus it is called *jué* headache.

If the disorder follows the *lián* (连) channel into the brain (脑), it is called true headache. The brain is the *suǐhǎi* (髓海, marrow sea), and when wind and *líng* *qi* enter the *níjiǔ guān* (泥九官, muddy nine orifices), it means the *xie* (邪, pathogenic) *qi* follows the *fēngfǔ* (风府) channel into the brain, causing severe pain. When *líng* (playing) reaches the elbows and knees of the hands and feet (手足玲至肘膝), this also results in true headache.

When the *qi* of the five *zàng* (藏, viscera) interacts with one another, it is called *jué* heart pain. All channels belong to the heart (心), and if one channel is diseased, its *qi* flows in reverse, and when it reverses, it assaults the heart, causing heart pain—hence it is called *jué* heart pain. This is when the *qi* of the five *zàng* surges in reverse, causing pain, not the heart itself generating pain. When the pain is severe and the hands and feet turn blue (手足青), it is called true heart pain.

True heart pain is said to strike once in the morning and kill by evening, or strike in the evening and kill by morning. See further in the *Shíliù Nán* (十六难).

**Divine Insight and Skillful Mastery (神圣工巧, Shénshèng Gōngqiǎo) – Difficulty #61**

The *Sixiùyī Nán* (六十一难) states: *"The Classics say 'to know by looking' is called divine insight."* To diagnose a disease by merely observing the patient is called divine insight.

*"To know by hearing" is called sagacity.* To diagnose a disease by listening to the patient is called sagacity.

*"To know by questioning" is called skilled mastery.* Before diagnosis, to ask questions first is the most reliable method; to diagnose a disease through questioning is called skilled mastery.

*"To know by pulse-taking" is called artful precision.* To diagnose by observing the patient’s breathing (息) during pulse examination is called artful precision.

What does this mean? How do the four methods of knowing work?»

---

**Divine Insight and Skillful Mastery (神圣工巧, Shénshèng Gōngqiǎo) – Difficulty #16**

Now, *"to know by looking"* means observing the patient’s five colors (五色, *wǔsè*) to discern their illness. If one sees green (青色, *qīngsè*), it indicates a liver disorder (肝病, *gānbìng*); if one sees red (赤色, *chìsè*), it suggests the heart (心, *xīn*) has overpowered the liver, yet the liver is still afflicted. Thus, by observing the five colors, one may know the disease.

*"To know by hearing"* means listening to the patient’s five tones (五音, *wǔyīn*)—*guān, shāng, jiǎo, zhǐng, yǔ*—to distinguish their ailment. These five tones correspond to the five *Zàng* (藏, visceral organs). If a patient frequently weeps (好哭, *hàokū*), it is a sign of lung disease (肺病, *fèibìng*); if they enjoy singing (好歌, *hàogē*), it suggests spleen disorder (脾病, *píbìng*).

*"To know by questioning"* means inquiring about the patient’s cravings for the five flavors (五味, *wǔwèi*) to determine the source and location of their illness. When asked, a patient who prefers spicy (辛, *xīn*) flavors likely suffers from lung disease; one who favors sour (酸, *suān*) flavors, liver disease; one who craves sweet (甜, *tián*), spleen disease; one who prefers bitter (苦, *kǔ*), heart disease; and one who favors salty (咸, *xián*), kidney disease (肾病, *shènbìng*). Those who consume cold, raw foods (玲物, *língwù*) often have internal heat (内热, *nèirè*).

*"To know by pulse-taking"* means diagnosing by examining the *cùnkǒu* (寸口, radial pulse) and observing its *xūshí* (虚实, emptiness/fullness) to determine the illness and which *Zàng* (藏) or *Fǔ* (腑, hollow organs) it affects. If the pulse is *túnxī* (豚息, slack and faint) or *xián* (弦, taut), it indicates liver disorder (肝, *gān*). If a light touch reveals a slack or taut pulse, the illness lies in the hollow organs (府, *fǔ*). If a firm touch makes the pulse taut and the patient’s voice sounds hollow, the illness is in the visceral organs (藏, *zàng*). This is the meaning of *"to know by pulse-taking."*

The Classics say *"to know from outward signs"* is called *sagacity* (圣, *Shèng*). Observing the pulse (视脉, *shìmài*), initial pulse (初脉, *chūmài*), and pulse-taking (切脉, *qiēmài*) all involve knowing the illness from outward signs. *"To know from inward signs"* is called *divine insight* (神, *Shén*). This is its meaning: to perceive the illness in the mind (於心, *yúxīn*) is inward knowledge, hence called *divine insight*.

**Difficulty #61 (六十一难, *Liùshíyī Nán*) – The Five and Six (藏井荣有五，腑独有六, *Zàng Jǐng Róng Yǒu Wǔ, Fǔ Dú Yǒu Liù*)**
The *Sixiùyī Nán* (六十一难) asks: *"The visceral organs have five *jǐng* (井, wells) and five *róng* (荣, branches), while the hollow organs have six—why is this?"*

The five *Zàng* (藏) share five categories: *jǐng* (井, wells), *yù* (俞, streams), *róng* (荣, branches), *jīng* (经, channels), and *hé* (合, junctions). The six hollow organs (六府, *Liùfǔ*), however, have these five categories in addition to another point called *yuán* (原, source). How is this?

Now, the hollow organs (府, *Fǔ*) are of *Yáng* (阳, Yang) nature. The six hollow organs belong to *Yáng*. The *Sānjiāo* (三焦, Triple Burner) traverses all *Yáng* pathways, hence it is assigned a *yù* (俞) point named *yuán* (原). The *Sānjiāo* (三焦) is a ministerial organ (臣使之官, *chénshǐzhīguān*) aligned with the *Xiānghuǒ* (相火, Ministerial Fire), which carries out the commands of the *Jūnhuǒ* (君火, Sovereign Fire) across all *Yáng* channels (经, *jīng*). Thus, it is assigned a *yù* point named *yuán*.

*Yuán* (原) means *origin* (元, *yuán*). The six hollow organs share one *qi* (气) with the *Sānjiāo*, all being *Yáng* in nature, hence they are said to share one *qi*.

**Difficulty #62 (六十二难, *Liùshíèr Nán*) – The Ten Transformations (十变, *Shí Biàn*)**
The *Shí Biàn* (十变) states: *"The visceral organs, hollow organs, branches, and junctions all begin with the wells (井, *jǐng*)—why is this?"*

The five *Zàng* (藏) and six hollow organs (六府, *Liùfǔ*), with their wells (井, *jǐng*), branches (荣, *róng*), streams (俞, *yù*), channels (经, *jīng*), and junctions (合, *hé*), all trace their origins to the wells. Why is this?

Now, the wells (井, *jǐng*) represent the *east* (东方, *Dōngfāng*) and *spring* (春, *chūn*). Spring is *rén* (仁, benevolence), the greatest of the five *Cáng* (常, constants). In the yearly cycle, spring is the beginning (首, *shǒu*); in the monthly cycle, the *jiǎ* (甲) stem is the beginning. In the channel pathways, the wells are the beginning. All things are born in spring: plants sprout, insects stir, and creatures awaken. Thus, the *qíchóng* (岐虫, forked insects) move, and the *chuǎnchóng* (喘虫, panting insects) breathe. The *miánchóng* (绢虫, silkworm-like insects) and *rúchóng* (蠕虫, wriggling insects) also begin their activity in spring.

All living things that should be born arise from spring *qi* (气). Hence, the yearly count begins with spring: the first month (正月, *Zhèngyuè*) is the start of the year, so spring holds the beginning of the year. The monthly count begins with *jiǎ* (甲). The east belongs to *jiǎ* and *yǐ* (乙), both wood stems (木, *mù*), and the first month is associated with *jiǎ* and *yǐ*, both belonging to spring. Thus, the start of the twelve months lies in *jiǎ*. Therefore, the wells are the origin.

Only because of the year and month does one know that the wells are the beginning.

**Difficulty #63 (六十三难, *Liùshísān Nán*) – Yin and Yang Wells (阴井木，阳井金, *Yīn Jǐng Mù, Yáng Jǐng Jīn*)**
The *Shí Biàn* (十变) states: *"Yin wells are wood (木), Yang wells are metal (金)."*

The wells (井, *jǐng*) are like mountain valleys (谷井, *gǔjǐng*), not man-made pits. They are the places where water first emerges from the earth in mountain valleys. The same wells (井) are wood (木) in *Yáng* (阳) and metal (金) in *Yīn* (阴).

Yin branches (荣, *róng*) are fire (火), Yang branches are water (水). After water emerges from the wells, it lingers near the surface, and before it forms a great flow (大流, *dàliú*), it is called branches (荣). The branches (荣) are the state of small waters (小水, *xiǎoshuǐ*). The same branches (荣) are water (水) in *Yáng* (阳) and fire (火) in *Yīn* (阴).

Yin streams (俞, *yù*) are earth (土), Yang streams are wood (木). When the water lingers deeply, it reaches points where it can be directed to nourish the body, and these are called streams (俞). The same streams (俞) are earth (土) in *Yīn* (阴) and wood (木) in *Yáng* (阳).

Yin channels (经, *jīng*) are metal (金), Yang channels are fire (火). The channels (经) are pathways (径, *jìng*), the meaning of *jīngyíng* (经营, circulation and nourishment). As water accumulates and flows, it forms these channels. The same channels (经) are metal (金) in *Yīn* (阴) and fire (火) in *Yáng* (阳).

Yin junctions (合, *hé*) are water (水), Yang junctions are earth (土). The junctions (合) are convergences (会, *huì*), where lingering water reaches points that direct it to nourish the body. The same junctions (合) are water (水) in *Yīn* (阴) and earth (土) in *Yáng* (阳).

Why do *Yīn* (阴) and *Yáng* (阳) differ so greatly? The meaning is as follows:

This concerns the principles of *jiāng* (刚, firmness) and *róu* (柔, softness). The five *Zàng* (藏) are *Yīn* (阴) and *róu* (柔), while the six hollow organs (六府, *Liùfǔ*) are *Yáng* (阳) and *tiáo* (调, harmonious). *Yáng* alone cannot generate, nor can *Yīn* alone flourish; only when *Yáng* and *Yīn* interact as husband and wife (夫妇, *fūfù*) do they complete each other.

Yin wells are *yǐ* (乙) wood, Yang wells are *gēng* (庚) metal. *Yǐ* is *Yīn* (阴), belonging to wood (木); *gēng* is *Yáng* (阳), belonging to metal (金). Whatever is conquered (克, *kè*) is considered the wife (妻), so Yin wells of *yǐ* (乙) wood are paired with Yang wells of *gēng* (gēng) metal. *Yǐ* and *gēng* metal uphold the principle of husband and wife.

Yang wells of *gēng* (庚) are the firm (刚) aspect of *yǐ* (乙): *gēng* is firm, the husband, and *Yáng* (阳), hence *gēng* is the husband of *yǐ*. Yin wells of *yǐ* (乙) are the soft (柔) aspect of *gēng* (庚): *yǐ* is soft, the wife, and *Yīn* (阴), hence *yǐ* is the wife of *gēng*.

*Yǐ* (乙) is wood (木), hence it is called Yin wells of wood (阴井木). The east (东方, *Dōngfāng*) belongs to *jiǎ* (甲) and *yǐ* (乙), both small in the *Cáng* (常, constants). *Yǐ* is *Yīn* (阴), hence it is wood (木).

「*Gēng* (庚) is metal (金), hence it is called Yang wells of metal (阳井金).
The west (西方) belongs to *gēng* (庚) and *xīn* (辛), both metal (金), with *gēng* being Yang (阳). Metal conquers wood (金克木), hence Yang wells of metal (阳井金).
The same principle applies here.

Yin *róng* (荣) belongs to fire (火), Yang *róng* (荣) belongs to water (水). *Rén* (壬) water is firm (刚), *dīng* (丁) fire is soft (柔), and *dīng* (丁) and *rén* (壬) are paired.

Yang *yù* (俞) belongs to wood (木), Yin *yù* (俞) belongs to earth (土). *Jiǎ* (甲) wood is firm (刚), *jǐ* (己) wood is soft (柔), and *jiǎ* (甲) and *jǐ* (己) are paired. Yin *jīng* (经) belongs to metal (金), Yang *jīng* (经) belongs to fire (火). *Bǐng* (丙) fire is firm (刚), *xīn* (辛) metal is soft (柔), and *bǐng* (丙) and *xīn* (辛) are paired.

Yin *hé* (合) belongs to water (水), Yang *hé* (合) belongs to earth (土). *Wù* (戊) earth is firm (刚), *guǐ* (癸) water is soft (柔), and *wù* (戊) and *guǐ* (癸) are paired.

The sixty-fifth difficulty states:
The *jīng* (经) speaks of what is emitted as *jǐng* (井), and what is received as *hé* (合). How does this principle work?
The *jīng* (经) of the *tún* (豚) speaks of what is emitted as *jǐng* (井), and what is received as *hé* (合). How does this principle proceed?
Thus: what is emitted is *jǐng* (井).
Human Yang *qi* (阳气) follows the four seasons in its ebb and flow, and *jǐng* (井) is the time when Yang *qi* (阳气) first emerges.
*Jǐng* (井) is the east (东方) and spring (春). The east is the beginning of the four directions, spring is the beginning of the four seasons, and *jǐng* (井) is the beginning of the *jīng* (经) waters. Hence, *jǐng* (井) is the east and spring.
All things begin to grow, hence it is said that what is emitted is *jǐng* (井).
All things begin to grow in spring, hence it is said that the *jīng* (经) waters are emitted as *jǐng* (井).

What is received is *hé* (合).
*Hé* (合) is where the *jīng* (经) waters converge, and Yang *qi* (阳气) is hidden and stored similarly.
*Hé* (合) is the north (北方) and winter (冬). The north is the end of the four directions, winter is the end of the four seasons, and *hé* (合) is the end of the *jīng* (经) waters. Hence, *hé* (合) is the north and winter.
Yang *qi* (阳气) is hidden and stored. When Yang *qi* (阳气) reaches the winter solstice and retreats to the north, it enters and is concealed.
Hence, it is said that what is received is *hé* (合).
Hence, it is said that the *jīng* (经) waters are received as *hé* (合).

The sixty-sixth difficulty states:
The *jīng* (经) speaks of the origin (原) of the lung (肺) as *Tàiyuān* (太渊).
*Tàiyuān* (太渊) is located below the *yújì* (鱼际) of the right hand, where the pulse converges greatly, and the *tài yīn* (太阴) *tún* (豚) moves.

The origin (原) of the heart (心) is *Tàilíng* (太陵).
It is located in the depression between the two tendons behind the palm, which is the origin of the heart’s pericardial sac (心包络).

The origin (原) of the liver (肝) is *Tàichōng* (太冲).
It is located two *cùn* (寸) behind the base joint of the big toe on the foot.

The origin (原) of the spleen (脾) is *Tàibái* (太白).
It is located below the *húgǔ* (核骨) on the inner side of the foot.

The origin (原) of the kidney (肾) is *Tàixī* (太溪).
It is located behind the root bone of the inner ankle of the foot.

The origin (原) of the lesser Yin (少阴) is *Duìgǔ* (兑骨).
The five *zàng* (藏) all have *shùyù* (俞) as their origins (原).
Lesser Yin (少阴), the *zhēntún* (真豚) of the heart (心), also has an origin (原), located in the depression at the end of the *duìgǔ* (兑骨) behind the palm, also named *Shéndōng* (神门) and *Zhōngdū* (中都).
Earlier, it was said that the origin of the heart (心) is *Tàilíng* (太陵), which refers to the *tún* (豚) of the pericardial sac (心包络).
When it is said that heart diseases (心病) occur, they all pertain to the *tún* (豚) of the pericardial sac (心包络). The true heart (真心) does not fall ill, hence there is no *shùyù* (俞) for it.
Now, there is an origin (原) for lesser Yin (少阴), which is an external *jīng* (经) disease, not treating the internal *zàng* (藏).

The origin (原) of the gallbladder (胆) is *Qiūxū* (丘虚).
It is located slightly anterior to the outer ankle of the foot.

The origin (原) of the stomach (胃) is *Chōngyáng* (冲阳).
It is located five *cùn* (寸) above the ankle on the foot, between the bones where the pulse moves.

The origin (原) of the triple burner (三焦) is *Yángchí* (阳池).
It is located in the depression behind the base joint of the ring finger on the hand.

The origin (原) of the bladder (膀胱) is *Jīnggǔ* (京骨).
It is located below the large bone on the outer side of the foot, at the junction of red and white flesh.

The origin (原) of the large intestine (大肠) is *Hégǔ* (合谷).
It is located between the thumb and index finger, where the *hú* (虎) pulse moves.

The origin (原) of the small intestine (小肠) is *Wàngǔ* (腕骨).
It is located on the inner side of the wrist bone of the little finger.

Why are the origins (原) of the twelve *jīng* (经) all referred to as *shùyù* (俞)?
*Shùyù* (俞) refers to the *jǐng* (井), *róng* (荣), *shù* (俞), *jīng* (经), and *hé* (合) points, not other *shùyù* (俞) points.
How are the origins (原) of the twelve *jīng* (经) all referred to as *shùyù* (俞)?
Thus: the *shùyù* (俞) points of the five *zàng* (藏) are the pathways (所行) of the triple burner (三焦) and where the *qi* (气) flows and stops.
The triple burner (三焦) communicates through these *shùyù* (俞) points and also flows and stops here.
Thus, the *qi* (气) that moves between the navel and kidney (脐下肾问动气) is also involved.
See annotation in the eighth difficulty.

The kidney (肾) is the foundation of human life (人之生命) and vitality (性命).
The kidney (肾) is the root foundation of the twelve *jīng* (经).
See annotation in the eighth difficulty.»

Thus, it is called *yuán* (原).
The triple burner (三焦) converges its *qi* (气) at the kidney (肾), hence it is called *yuán* (原).
The triple burner (三焦) is the separate envoy of the *yuánqi* (原气).
See annotation in the thirty-eighth difficulty.
It governs the circulation of the three *qi* (三气).
The human triple burner (二#35焦) follows the three *yuán* (元) *qi* of Heaven and Earth, thus circulating the three *qi* (三气).
It traverses the five *zàng* (藏) and six *fǔ* (府).
The upper burner (上焦) lies between the heart and lungs, the middle burner (中焦) between the spleen and stomach, and the lower burner (下焦) between the liver and kidneys, perpetually circulating.
*Yuán* (原) is the exalted title of the triple burner (三焦).
*Yuán* (原) means *yuán* (元).
*Yuánqi* (元气) is the *qi* of the triple burner (三焦).
Its *qi* is exalted and great, hence *yuán* (原) is its exalted title.
Thus, wherever it stops, it is called *yuán* (原).
Wherever the *qi* lingers and halts, that is called *yuán* (原).
When the five *zàng* (藏) and six *fǔ* (府) fall ill, one must treat their *yuán* (原).
When the *zàng* (藏) and *fǔ* (府) are diseased, one must treat their *yuán* (原), hence the cure.
The sixty-seventh difficulty states:
The *mù* (募) points of the five *zàng* (藏) are all on the *yīn* (阴).
The abdomen is *yīn* (阴), and the *mù* (募) points of the five *zàng* (藏) are all within it.
The *mù* (募) of the lungs (肺) are the two *Zhōngfǔ* (中府) points, located one *cùn* (寸) below *Yúnmén* (云门) and three ribs above the nipple.
The *mù* (募) of the heart (心) are the two *Jùquè* (巨阙) points, located one *cùn* (寸) below *Jiūwěi* (鸠尾).
The *mù* (募) of the spleen (脾) are the two *Zhāngmén* (章门) points, directly below the lower ribs, aligned with the navel.
The *mù* (募) of the liver (肝) are the two *Qīmén* (期门) points, one *cùn* and five *fēn* (分) from either side of *Bùróng* (不容).
The *mù* (募) of the kidneys (肾) are the two *Jīngmén* (京门) points, located in the lumbar region, below the lower ribs.
Yet the *shù* (俞) points are all on the *yáng* (阳).
The back is *yáng* (阳), and the *shù* (俞) points of the five *zàng* (藏) are all on it.
The *Fèishù* (肺俞) point is located below the third vertebra, one *cùn* and five *fēn* (分) from either side.
The *Xīnshù* (心俞) point is located below the fifth vertebra, one *cùn* and five *fēn* (分) from the midline.
The *Gānshù* (肝俞) point is located below the ninth vertebra, one *cùn* and five *fēn* (分) from either side.
The *Píshù* (脾俞) point is located below the eleventh vertebra, one *cùn* and five *fēn* (分) from either side.
The *Shènshù* (肾#38俞) point is located below the fourteenth vertebra, one *cùn* and five *fēn* (分) from either side.
How is this so?
Why are the *mù* (募) on *yīn* (阴) and the *shù* (俞) on *yáng* (阳)?

Thus:

The *yīn* (阴) diseases manifest in the *yáng* (阳), while the *yáng* (阳) diseases manifest in the *yīn* (阴).
When the internal *zàng* (藏) are diseased, the ailment manifests externally in the *yáng* (阳)—for the *shù* (俞) points lie on the back.
When the external body is diseased, the ailment descends into the *yīn* (阴)—for the *mù* (募) points lie in the abdomen.
Hence, the *mù* (募) points are on the *yīn* (阴), and the *shù* (俞) points are on the *yáng* (阳).

The *Lùshíbāshì Nán* (六十八难) states:
Each of the five *zàng* (藏) and six *fǔ* (府) has its own *jǐng* (井), *róng* (荣), *shù* (俞), *jīng* (经), and *hé* (合) points.

- *Jīng* (经): *Zhīgōu* (支沟)
- *Hé* (合): *Tiānjǐng* (天井)
- *Yuán* (原): *Yángchí* (阳池)

These are the *jǐng* (井), *róng* (荣), *shù* (俞), *jīng* (经), *hé* (合), and *yuán* (原) points of the six *fǔ* (府).

What do they govern?

The *jǐng* (井), *róng* (荣), *shù* (俞), *jīng* (经), and *hé* (合) each govern specific ailments.

Thus:
The *jǐng* (井) is where the meridian originates—like a spring welling up in a valley.
The *róng* (荣) is where it flows—like a stream that has yet to become a great river.
The *shù* (俞) is where it converges—where the water gathers deeply, allowing for drainage.
The *jīng* (经) is where it courses—forming channels through which it flows.
The *hé* (合) is where it enters—where the channels converge into the sea.

The *jǐng* (井) governs **distension beneath the heart**.
The *jǐng* (井) follows the principle of Wood (肝), corresponding to the Liver.
When the Liver is diseased, it oppresses the Spleen (Earth), causing distension beneath the heart.
Treating the *jǐng* (井) prevents Wood from overacting upon Earth.

The *róng* (荣) governs **febrile body**.
The *róng* (荣) follows the principle of Fire (心), corresponding to the Heart.
The Lung belongs to Metal, externally governing skin and fur.
When Heart-Fire scorches the Lung-Metal, the body becomes febrile—indicating that the disease lies in the Heart.
Treating the *róng* (荣) prevents Fire from overacting upon Metal, thus alleviating the fever.

The *shù* (俞) governs **heaviness in the body and joint pain**.
The *shù* (俞) follows the principle of Earth (脾), corresponding to the Spleen.
When the Spleen is diseased, it necessarily oppresses Water (肾), and Water governs the bones.
Thus, the disease manifests as joint pain.
When the Spleen itself is diseased, the body feels heavy—hence, treatment should target the *shù* (俞) points.

The *jīng* (经) governs **wheezing, coughing, and alternating cold and heat**.
The *jīng* (经) follows the principle of Metal (肺), corresponding to the Lung.
When the disease lies in the *jīng* (经), the Lung’s ailments manifest—cold induces coughing, heat induces wheezing.
When the disease lies in Metal, it oppresses Wood (肝), and Wood in the emotions is anger.
Anger causes *qi* reversal, hence the wheezing.
Why so?
The Liver’s branch separates and pierces the diaphragm—Metal does not oppress Wood.

The *hé* (合) governs **inverted *qi* and diarrhea**.
The *hé* (合) follows the principle of Water (肾), corresponding to the Kidney.
When Kidney-*qi* is deficient, it injures the *Chōngmài* (冲脉), causing *qi* inversion and diarrhea.
The Kidney governs the orifices of the two *yīn* (阴) regions.
When Kidney-*qi* is unchecked, diarrhea ensues.
When the disease lies in Water, Water must support Fire (心).
The Heart, by principle, should not receive evil.
The Liver-Wood is the mother of Heart-Fire and the child of Kidney-Water.
There are two concerns: first, that the mother (Liver) receives evil, and second, that the child (Liver) is oppressed.
The Liver in the emotions is anger, and worry induces anger.
Anger causes *qi* inversion.
Treating the *hé* (合) prevents Water from overacting upon Fire, thus stopping *qi* inversion.
If the disease is not in the Kidney, there will be no diarrhea.

These are the diseases governed by the *jǐng* (井), *róng* (荣), *shù* (俞), *jīng* (经), and *hé* (合) points of the five *zàng* (藏) and six *fǔ* (府).

The generation of diseases through the *jǐng* (井), *róng* (荣), *shù* (俞), *jīng* (经), and *hé* (合) points should be adjusted according to the four seasons.
This means that the seasonal evils lodge and remain in the *róng* (荣) and *shù* (俞) points.

**On Needling Techniques: Supplementation and Drainage (第十二#52)**

The *Lùshíliùshíjiǔ Nán* (六十九难) states:
The Classics say: *"Supplement the deficient."* For deficient or weak *zàng* (藏) and *fǔ* (府), supplementation is used.
*"Drain the replete."* For overfilled or excessive *zàng* (藏) and *fǔ* (府), drainage is applied.
*"If neither deficient nor replete, follow the channel."* When none of the *zàng* (藏) are overacting and there is no imbalance of deficiency or excess, one should merely follow the channel’s sequence in applying supplementation or drainage.

Why so? How does this work?

Thus:
For the deficient, supplement the **mother**.
In spring, if the Kidney pulse is deficient, it indicates Kidney deficiency unable to transmit *qi* to the Liver.
Thus, the Kidney is supplemented—since the Kidney is the mother of the Liver, it is said, *"Supplement the mother."*

For the replete, drain the **child**.
In spring, if the Heart pulse is replete, it indicates excessive Heart-*qi* overacting upon the Liver.
Thus, the Heart is drained—since the Heart is the child of the Liver, it is said, *"Drain the child."*

First, supplementation should be applied, then drainage.

The **mother** can make the **child** replete—thus, supplementing the **mother** must come first.
The **child** can make the **mother** deficient—thus, draining the **child** must come later.

When neither replete nor deficient, one takes from the **channel itself**—this means the **channel’s own pathology** arises, not an external evil. Thus, one must take from the **channel itself**, hence the saying, *"take from the channel."*

When neither replete nor deficient, the **zàng** do not overact upon one another.

In spring, if the pulse is **tight** or merely **tight**, this is the **Liver zàng’s** own disease, and supplementation or drainage is applied to the **Foot Jueyin-Less Yang channels**.

The **channel’s own** Wood, Fire, Water, Metal, and Earth are taken according to the season.

The **70th Difficulty** says:
The **Classic** states: *"In spring and summer, puncture shallowly. In spring and summer, puncture at the **jing-well** and **ying-spring** [points], from the thin, shallow muscles. In autumn and winter, puncture deeply. In autumn and winter, puncture at the **jing-river** and **he-sea** [points], from the thick, deep muscles."*

What does this mean? How does shallow and deep work?

Thus:
In spring and summer, **yang-qi** is above, and human **qi** is also above—thus, one must take shallowly.
Spring-**qi** resides in the **hair follicles**, summer-**qi** in the **skin**—both **yang-qi** and human **qi** are above, so the needle is used to puncture the shallow **hair follicles** and **skin**.

In autumn and winter, **yang-qi** is below, and human **qi** is also below—thus, one must take deeply.
Autumn-**qi** is in the **flesh**, winter-**qi** in the **sinews and bones**—both **yang-qi** and human **qi** are below, so the needle is used to puncture the deep **flesh**, **sinews**, and **bones**.

In spring and summer, **one must cultivate one yin**.
Spring and summer are **yang**—*cultivate* means *reach* or *attain*. In spring and summer, one cultivates **yang** by attaining one **yin** to nourish it, lest it become **lonely yang**.

In autumn and winter, **one must cultivate one yang**.
Autumn and winter are **yin**—in autumn and winter, one cultivates **yin** by attaining one **yang** to nourish it, lest it become **lonely yin**.

What does this mean? How do the four seasons’ cultivations differ?

Thus:
In spring and summer, warmth requires attaining one **yin**—
Spring and summer diseases manifest in **yang**, so **yin** is drawn to harmonize **yang**.
When first inserting the needle, it is sunk to the **Kidney-Liver** region to obtain **qi**, drawing in **yin** to harmonize it.
Human skin has thick and thin regions—beneath the skin lies the **Liver-Kidney** region, where **yin-qi** flows. Thus, the needle is sunk inward, entering the skin five *cun*, reaching the **Liver-Kidney** region to obtain **qi**, drawing in **yin-qi** to harmonize the **yang**.

In autumn and winter, cold requires attaining one **yang**—
Autumn and winter diseases manifest in **yin**, so **yang** is drawn inward to harmonize **yin**.
When first inserting the needle, it is kept shallow and superficial, reaching the **Heart-Lung** region to obtain **qi**, pushing in **yang** to harmonize it.
Above the skin lies the **Heart-Lung** region—thus, the needle is kept superficial, entering the skin three *cun*, reaching the **Heart-Lung** region to obtain **qi**, pushing the needle inward to draw in **yang-qi** to harmonize the **yin**.

This is called: *"In spring and summer, one must cultivate one yin; in autumn and winter, one must cultivate one yang."*

Returning to the previous text:
The **71st Difficulty** says:

The **Classical** states:
*"Needle the **Nourishing** (*róng*) without harming the **Defensive** (*wèi*).*
When the needle pierces **Nourishing-qi** and **blood**, it must not harm **Defensive-qi**.
When needling the **Defensive**, it must not harm **Nourishing-qi** and **blood**.
What does this mean?
How do these two differ?
Now:
Needling **yang-qi** (*Defensive*) is done externally—thus, the **Defensive** (as **yang**) is needled by entering the skin two *cun*.
If the disease lies in the **Defensive**, the needle is kept shallow, so one lowers the needle to pierce it, lest its depth harm **Nourishing-qi**.

Needling **yin-qi** (*Nourishing*) requires first using the left hand to grasp and press the **acupuncture point** where the **Nourishing** and **Defensive** converge. Once the **qi** disperses, the needle is inserted.
The **Nourishing** is **yin**, so when needling, entering the skin five *cun* reaches **Nourishing-qi**—thus, one first presses the point to await the **qi**’s dispersal before inserting the needle, lest its depth harm **Defensive-qi**.
This is how one needles the **Nourishing** without harming the **Defensive**, and the **Defensive** without harming the **Nourishing**.

The **72nd Difficulty** says:
*"The **Classical** states: ‘If one can know the **qi** of **迎** (*welcoming*) and **随** (*following*), one may order it adjusted.’
**迎** (*welcoming*) is **逆** (*contrary/against*), **取** (*drawing out*).
**随** (*following*) is **顺** (*with/along*), **补** (*supplementing*).
The **Defensive-qi** moves contrary, the **Nourishing-qi** moves with—if one knows this, one may adjust it.
The method of **调** (*adjusting*) **qi** must lie in **yin-yang**.
The methods of **调摄** (*adjusting and nurturing*) **Nourishing** and **Defensive** **qi** lie in **yin-yang** and **虚实** (*void/full*).
What does this mean?
How does this principle work?"

Now then, what is meant by *welcoming* and *following* is knowing the circulation of **Nourishing** and **Defensive** **qi**, and the passage of vessels and collaterals.

Only by knowing the circulation of **Nourishing** and **Defensive** **qi** and the passage of vessels and collaterals can one avoid failing to supplement, drain, welcome, or follow. Following their contrary or with movements to take **qi**, hence the terms *welcoming* and *following*.

Since the **Defensive-qi** moves contrary and the **Nourishing-qi** moves with, one supplements or drains according to their contrary or with movements—thus *welcoming* and *following*.

The method of **adjusting qi** must lie in **yin-yang**, for:

When **yin** is void and **yang** is full, one supplements **yin** and drains **yang**;
When **yang** is void and **yin** is full, one supplements **yang** and drains **yin**.

Sometimes **yang** dominates **yin**, sometimes **yin** dominates **yang**;
Sometimes both **yin** and **yang** are void, sometimes both are full.
In all cases, one adjusts **yin-yang** according to where the disease lies, and thus no disease remains unresolved.

Knowing the inner and outer, the superficial and deep:
Observing the collaterals’ floating state, discerning the disease’s void or fullness—
Using the inner to know the outer, the outer to know the inner,
Viewing the superficial to know the deep, the deep to know the superficial—
Thus one knows void and fullness.

Adjusting according to **yin-yang**, treating each according to which **yin-yang** vessel the disease resides in—
Hence it is said: *The method of adjusting qi must lie in yin-yang.*

Reiterating the previous text,
The **73rd Difficulty** says:

The **Ping** points—where the flesh is thin and the **qi** insufficient to command—how must one treat them?
The **Ping** points are located at the fingertips of hands and feet, where the flesh is thin and the **blood-qi** is still scant; how then may one apply needle insertion?

Yet it is said:
The **Ping** points belong to **Wood**;
The **Rong** points belong to **Fire**.
**Ping** is the mother of **Fire**;
**Rong** is the child of **Wood**.
**Fire**, being the child of **Wood’s child**, when treating the **Ping** points,
must be drained by the **Rong** points.
If the **Liver (Wood)** is full, fullness must be drained from its child.
The **Rong** points belong to **Fire**, the child of **Wood**,
so they must be drained.
In spring, one needles the **Rong**—this is the **Emperor (Wood)** not yet concluding its reign,
as **Fire** seizes the **Emperor’s** rule—
a principle of **real evil**, hence the draining of **Rong**.

For instance, if the **Liver** itself is diseased,
when full, one drains the **Fire** within the **Liver**,
when void, one supplements the **Wood** within the **Liver**.
Thus the Classics say: *"The method of supplementing cannot be used for draining, nor can draining be used for supplementing."*
When one should supplement, draining is forbidden;
when one should drain, supplementing is forbidden.

The **74th Difficulty** asks:
The Classics say: *"In spring, needle the **Ping** points."*
**Ping** belongs to **Wood**, so in spring it is needled.
In summer, needle the **Rong** points.
**Rong** belongs to **Fire**, so in summer it is needled.
In late summer, needle the **Yu** points.
**Yu** belongs to **Earth**, so in late summer—June—it is needled.
In autumn, needle the **Jing** points.
**Jing** belongs to **Metal**, so in autumn it is needled.
In winter, needle the **He** points.
**He** belongs to **Water**, so in winter it is needled.

What does this mean?
How do the needleings differ in the four seasons?

Yet it is said:
In spring, when needling the **Ping** points, the **evil** is in the **Liver**.
To prevent **Liver (Wood)** evil from harming **Spleen (Earth)**, one needles the **Ping** points.
In summer, when needling the **Rong** points, the **evil** is in the **Heart**.
To prevent **Heart (Fire)** evil from harming **Lung (Metal)**, one needles the **Rong** points.
In late summer, when needling the **Yu** points, the **evil** is in the **Spleen**.
To prevent **Spleen (Earth)** evil from harming **Kidney (Water)**, one needles the **Yu** points.
In autumn, when needling the **Jing** points, the **evil** is in the **Lung**.
To prevent **Lung (Metal)** evil from harming **Liver (Wood)**, one needles the **Jing** points.
In winter, when needling the **He** points, the **evil** is in the **Kidney**.
To prevent **Kidney (Water)** evil from harming **Heart (Fire)**, one needles the **He** points.

Why does the **Liver, Heart, Spleen, Lung, Kidney** system relate to the four seasons?
How are the five **Zang** organs connected to the four seasons?

Yet it is said:
When one **Zang** organ is diseased, the five **evils** manifest.
The five **tones**, five **colors**, five **flavors**, five **fragrances**, and five **bodily fluids**.
For instance, if the **Liver** is diseased—
taking the **Liver** as a single organ for example—
greenish **color** belongs to the **Liver**,
a **sour odor** belongs to the **Liver**,
a preference for **sour tastes** belongs to the **Liver**,
a tendency to **laugh** belongs to the **Liver**,
and a tendency to **weep** belongs to the **Liver**.
*(See annotation in the **34th Difficulty**.)*
Its diseases are manifold—
too numerous to exhaustively enumerate.

「Diseases are most numerous—though spoken of, they cannot be fully exhausted.
The four seasons have their own fixed **numbers**, yet they all converge upon **Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter** as well.

The four seasons have a definite **cycle**, all linked to this.
The essential subtlety of **needling** lies in its **autumn-hair** precision—this is the key.
The **autumn-hair** principle refers to the acupuncture’s delicate and refined logic.

The **75th Difficulty** states:
The **Canon** says, *"The East is solid, the West is void; drain the South, supplement the North—what does this mean?"*
If the **Liver** (East) is **solid**, and the **Lung** (West) is **void**,
then drain the **Heart-Fire** (South) and supplement the **Kidney-Water** (North)—how so?

Yet: **Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth** must balance one another.
**Metal** overcomes **Wood**, **Wood** overcomes **Earth**, **Earth** overcomes **Water**, **Water** overcomes **Fire**, **Fire** overcomes **Metal**—
the five **Zang** organs and the five **Phases** must mutually regulate and subdue one another.
One should rely on their **supplementation and drainage** to harmonize and treat accordingly.

The East belongs to **Wood**.
The East is governed by **Wood**.
The West belongs to **Metal**.
The West is governed by **Metal**.
When **Wood** seeks to be **solid**, **Metal** must balance it.
If **Metal** overcomes **Wood**, then **Liver-qi** grows **strong and solid**, while **Lung-qi** becomes **weak and void**—
**Wood** rebels against **Metal**, and **Metal**’s family does not submit,
so **Metal** comes to balance **Wood**.

When **Fire** seeks to be **solid**, **Water** must balance it.
If **Heart-qi** grows **strong and solid**, while **Kidney-qi** becomes **weak and void**—
**Fire** rebels against **Water**, and **Water**’s family does not submit,
so **Water** comes to balance **Fire**.

When **Earth** seeks to be **solid**, **Wood** must balance it.
If **Spleen-qi** grows **strong and solid**, while **Liver-qi** becomes **weak and void**—
**Earth** rebels against **Wood**, and **Wood**’s family does not submit,
so **Wood** comes to balance **Earth**.

When **Metal** seeks to be **solid**, **Fire** must balance it.
If **Lung-qi** grows **strong and solid**, while **Heart-qi** becomes **weak and void**—
**Metal** rebels against **Fire**, and **Fire**’s family does not submit,
so **Fire** comes to balance **Metal**.

When **Water** seeks to be **solid**, **Earth** must balance it.
If **Kidney-qi** grows **strong and solid**, while **Spleen-qi** becomes **weak and void**—
**Earth** rebels against **Water**, and **Water**’s family does not submit,
so **Earth** comes to balance **Water**.

If the East is the **Liver**, then one knows the **Liver** is **solid**;
if the West is the **Lung**, then one knows the **Lung** is **void**.
When **pathogenic-qi** flourishes, it becomes **solid**;
when **true-qi** is depleted, it becomes **void**.
**Wood** being **solid** means **Wood** has excess—
then **Earth** grows **rampant and fearful**, and **Metal** lacks nourishment,
leading to **Metal**’s **voidness**.

To drain the **Heart-Fire** (South) and supplement the **Kidney-Water** (North):
The **Heart-Fire** (South) is the **child** of **Wood**.
The **Kidney-Water** (North) is the **mother** of **Wood**.
**Water** overcomes **Fire**.

Taking the **Liver** as a single organ for example:
**Fire** is the **child** of **Wood**.
If one does not drain **Fire**, then **Fire** will flourish excessively and **consumptively** attack **Metal**,
**Metal** will retaliate and **overwhelm** **Wood**,
and **Metal** and **Wood** will mutually **assail** one another.

**Water** is the **mother** of **Wood**.
If one does not supplement **Water**, then **Water-qi** will be **weak**,
and it will fail to generate **Wood**.
The **child** can cause the **mother** to be **solid**,
and the **mother** can cause the **child** to be **void**.
The **child** can make the **mother** **excessively solid**,
and the **mother** can make the **child** **weakly void**.

Thus, draining **Fire** and supplementing **Water**,
one seeks to prevent **Metal** from balancing **Wood**.
In applying **needling** to drain,
one must first diagnose its **manifestations**—
then drain the **Heart**, so that **Heart-qi** flows freely,
and **Liver-qi** is restored.
Then supplement the **Kidney**, so that **Kidney**’s family receives **qi**,
and **Kidney** transmits **qi** to nourish the **Liver**.
Once **Liver-qi** is **settled**, then **Lung** will no longer come to balance the **Liver**.

As the **Canon** states:
*"If one cannot treat its **voidness**, why ask about its excess?"*
This is the very meaning.

If **Lung-voidness** arises from **Liver-solidity**, then one must drain **Fire** and supplement **Water**.
If one does not grasp the essential principle of treating **voidness**,
why bother inquire about the rest?

The **76th Difficulty** asks:
*"What is meant by **supplementation and drainage**?"*

The meaning of **supplementation** and **drainage**—how so?

When one must **supplement**, from where does one draw **qi**?
When the time comes to **supplement**, from where does one take **qi**?

When one must **drain**, where does one place **qi**?
**Placement** is **taking**, is **welcoming**.
When the time comes to **drain**, from where does one take **qi**?

Now: when **supplementing**, one takes **qi** from the **Wei** [defensive circulation].
The **Lung** governs the five **qi**, irrigating and nourishing the five **zàng** [solid organs],
circulating through the six **jīng** [channels], and returning to the hundred **tún** [pores].
To take **qi**, one must draw it from the **Wei**—
once **qi** is obtained, one then inserts the needle into the **zàng** or **fu** [hollow organ] channels where **voidness** resides,
adjusting depth and section accordingly—this is how one **supplements**.

When **draining**, one places **qi** in the **Rong** [nutritive circulation].
Since **pathogens** dwell in the **Rong**, one inserts the needle into the **zàng** or **fu** channels where **solidity** resides,
waiting for the **qi** to guide the needle as it **drains**.

If **yang-qi** is insufficient and **yin-qi** is in excess,
one must first **supplement the yang**, then **drain the yin**.
For instance, if the **Gallbladder** is deficient and the **Liver** is in excess,
one first **supplements the Foot-Shao-Yang** [Gallbladder channel], then **drains the Foot-Jué-Yin** [Liver channel].

If **yin-qi** is insufficient and **yang-qi** is in excess,
one must first **supplement the yin**, then **drain the yang**.
If the **Liver** is deficient and the **Gallbladder** is in excess,
one first **supplements the Foot-Jué-Yin** [Liver channel], then **drains the Foot-Shao-Yang** [Gallbladder channel].

The **Rong** and **Wei** circulate harmoniously—this is the key principle.
When **yin** or **yang** is in excess or deficiency,
one must first **supplement what is deficient**, then **drain what is in excess**—
thus ensuring the **Rong** and **Wei** flow freely, which is the very essence of needle technique.

The **77th Difficulty** asks:
*"The **Canon** says: 'The superior physician treats disease before it arises.'"*

The **superior physician**—the master healer who ensures complete success in every case—is one who treats illness before it manifests. The **mediocre physician** treats only when disease has already arisen. The mediocre physician fails to grasp the full principle, and thus remains fixed on treating a single organ alone.

What does this mean? How is this explained?

When it is said to treat illness before it arises, it means: when one observes disease in the **Liver**, one knows the **Liver** will transmit it to the **Spleen**, so one must first **fortify the Spleen’s qi**, preventing it from receiving the **Liver’s** pathogenic influence. Among the five **zàng** organs, those in excess transmit their imbalance, while those deficient receive evil. When observing disease in the **Liver** channel, one recognizes that the **Spleen**—the organ it overcomes—will be affected, so one preemptively **supplements the Spleen’s qi**, preventing it from receiving the **Liver’s** pathogenic *qi*. Thus, it is said to treat illness before it arises.

Returning to the previous text:

The **mediocre physician**, upon seeing disease in the **Liver**, does not understand the principle of transmission, and thus focuses solely on treating the **Liver**. Seeing disease in the **Liver**, they fail to grasp the logic of the **Liver** transmitting to the **Spleen**, and instead concentrate only on treating the **Liver** channel. Hence, it is said they treat illness only after it has arisen.

Returning to the previous text.

**Chapter 78: On the Difficulties of Needling**

Needling has methods of **supplementation** and **drainage**. In **supplementation**, one exhales as the needle is withdrawn; in **drainage**, one inhales as the needle is inserted. What does this mean? How are these methods explained?

Indeed: the methods of **supplementation** and **drainage** do not strictly require exhaling or inhaling to withdraw or insert the needle. The true methods of **supplementation** and **drainage** are not concealed in the breath’s withdrawal or insertion, but rather rely on the **arrival of *qi*** as the needle enters or exits.

For those who know needling: they trust their **left hand**. When applying needling techniques, they begin with the **left hand**. For those who do not know needling: they trust their **right hand**. When ignorant of needling methods, they begin with the **right hand**. At the moment of insertion:

Before needling, one must first press and stabilize the **acupuncture point** with the **left hand**. Knowing the location of the **acupuncture point**, one presses it firmly with the **left hand**. Then, one **flicks and strains** it—with the **right hand**, one flicks the pressed point, causing the **skin’s *qi*** to swell beneath. One **hooks and lowers** the needle—**hooks and lowers** it, aligning the needle’s position. When the *qi* arrives, it appears like the **pulsing of a vein**. The *qi* arrives beneath the **left hand’s** pressure, manifesting like the **pulsing of skin** (*fǔ*). Following this, one needles along the needle’s path. Upon **arrival of *qi***, one then **pushes and inserts** the needle deeper into the **meridian**. This is called **supplementation**.

If one **flicks and lifts** it, this is called **drainage**. When *qi* arrives, one **shakes and withdraws** the needle, and this is **drainage**. If *qi* does not arrive:

If the needle is left in place for a long time and *qi* still does not come, one waits in the **Wei** layer for the *qi* to arrive; if it still does not come, one inserts deeper into the **meridian** (*Hóng*) and waits again. If, after probing these three levels—**Wei**, **meridian**, and **meridian** (*Hóng*)—the *qi* fails to respond beneath the needle, this signifies that the **Yin and Yang** have both been exhausted, and further needling is impossible. This is the case of **"male external, female internal"**—if *qi* does not arrive, it is called **"ten deaths, one survival"**.

The **Wei** layer governs **Yang**, overseeing the **external**; in males, **Yang *qi*** circulates externally, so one uses a **light touch** to press the point. The **meridian** (*Hóng*) governs **blood**, overseeing the **internal**; in females, **Yin *qi*** circulates internally, so one uses a **heavy touch** to press the point. If *qi* does not arrive even after the proper timing, and the **left hand** fails to sense it, then needling is impossible, resulting in **"ten deaths, one survival"**.

---

**Chapter 79: On the Difficulties of Needling**

The **classics** state: *"迎而夺之"*—how can this not result in **emptiness**? When the *qi* is just about to arrive and one uses the needle to take it, this is called *"迎而夺之"*. **迎 (Yíng)** means to **take the *qi***; **夺 (Duó)** means to **drain the *qi***. How can taking and draining it not result in **emptiness**?

The **classics** also state: *"随而济之"*—how can this not result in **fullness**? **随 (Suí)** means to **follow the *qi*** from the **Wei** layer and **supplement** it. **济 (Jì)** means to **reinforce the deficient meridian**. How can following and reinforcing it not result in **fullness**? When the *qi* flows and settles, one inserts the needle; once the needle is withdrawn, one **palpates the point**—this is called *"随而济之"*.

**Emptiness** and **fullness** are matters of **arrival or failure**. If the meridian is **weak**, yet one needles to **supplement its fullness**, the result is either **arrival or failure**—this is the critical point. If the meridian is **strong**, yet one needles to **drain its emptiness**, the result is either **arrival or failure**—this is also the critical point.

What does this mean? How are these methods explained?

Thus:

When **welcoming and taking**—this is **draining its child**. If the five **zàng** are **full**, drain their child. When **following and supplementing**—this is **reinforcing its mother**. If the five **zàng** are **empty**, supplement their mother.

Take, for instance, a **heart** disease. Using the **heart** as an example for one **zàng**:
Drain the **Shou Xin Zhu** (Palace) point. The **heart** is the sovereign of the five **zàng**; by law, it does not receive disease. What receives disease is the **heart’s pericardium**. The **Shou Xin Zhu** is the **hand Jueyin Heart-Pericardium** meridian’s **shu** point. The **Shou Xin Zhu** point is **earth**; the **heart’s fire** is its child—thus, draining its **shu** point is draining its child. This is **welcoming and taking**.

Referring back to the previous text: Supplement the **Shou Xin Zhu** **jing** (well) point. The **heart’s fire** is the child of **wood**; **wood** is the **mother** of **fire**. Now, supplementing the **well** of the **Shou Xin Zhu** is supplementing its mother. This is called **following and supplementing**.

What is meant by **fullness** and **emptiness**? This refers to **tao (牢)** and **ru (濡)**.
**Ru** is **emptiness**; **tao** is **fullness**.
When *qi* arrives **tao** and **full**, it is **success**; when **ru** and **empty**, it is **failure**—thus, *"either success or failure."*

Before performing **supplementation or drainage**, first **palpate** the **zàng**’s **shu** points and the points to be needled. If the *qi* arrives **tao** and **full**, it may be drained; if **ru** and **empty**, it may be supplemented. If one holds the needle and cannot **discern** its **tao** or **ru**, then it is *"either success or failure."*

The *Ba Shi Nan* (Eighty Difficulties) asks:
The classics say: *"There are those who see [the needle] as entering, those who see the needle as entering, and those who see [the needle] as exiting."* What does this mean? How is *"seeing the needle as exiting"*?

Thus:
What is meant by *"seeing as entering"* is that the left hand **observes** the *qi* arriving before inserting the needle. When needling a person, first use the left hand to **palpate** the *qi* in the **an** (安) region. When the *qi* arrives, then insert the needle. The needle enters the point. When the *qi* is exhausted, withdraw the needle. **Palpate** until the *qi* is exhausted before withdrawing the needle—this is not the method of **welcoming, following, supplementation, or drainage**. This is called *"seeing as entering, seeing as exiting."*

Summarizing the previous text.

The **Eighty-One Difficulties** states: *"The Classics speak of ‘solid-solid, hollow-hollow’ [needling], and of ‘draining the deficient while supplementing the excessive.’"* Refer to the annotations on the **Twelfth Difficulty**.

Is this regarding the *cùnkǒu* (寸口) pulse? Ask: *"What is the pulse like?"* Is this regarding the patient’s inherent deficiency or excess? Ask: *"Does the disease itself have deficiency or excess?"*

How does one apply the method of **draining** and **supplementing**?

Suppose the **liver** is solid (real) while the **lungs** are hollow (deficient). The liver is **wood**, the lungs are **metal**. Metal and wood should **mutually balance**—metal should **subdue** wood. See the **Seventy-Fifth Difficulty** for details.

Suppose the lungs are solid. For instance, if the **lung-qi** is strong and excessive, one would recognize that the liver is deficient with **scant and faint** *qi*.

If the liver’s *qi* is **weak and deficient**, **fine and sparse**, yet the practitioner **needles without supplementing the liver** and instead **further strengthens the lungs**, this is the error of **draining the deficient while supplementing the excessive**.

Thus, the saying *"solid-solid, hollow-hollow"* and *"draining the deficient while supplementing the excessive"* is the **harm** caused by **mediocre practitioners**.

This is the **harm** of mediocre practitioners, whereby they apply *"solid-solid, hollow-hollow"* and *"drain the deficient while supplementing the excessive."*
