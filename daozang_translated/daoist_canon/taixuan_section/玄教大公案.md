**Four Prefaces to The Great Cases of the Mysterious Teachings**

The transmission of the Daoist lineage extends far into antiquity. At the beginning, the Supreme Venerable Sovereign of Primordial Chaos, through the subtleties of the Image-Prior, forcibly named it the *Dao/Way* and established teachings to assist it with *virtue/power*, as recorded in the Five Thousand Words. Yet the essence beyond words—subtle, wondrous, and profoundly interconnected—remains inexpressible, unfathomable, and can only be forcibly described.

From the *Virtue/Power* received by Guan Yinzi, his ten disciples each grasped its mysteries. Thinkers like Liezi and Zhuangzi, along with immortals such as Anqisheng, Li Xianqing, and Master Ge the Immortal, transmitted it in succession, each with their own scriptures. Though branches diverged and schools flourished, generations of adepts never lacked in grotto-heavens and blessed lands.

Since the Zhou and Han dynasties, only Yinzi inherited the ancestral seat. The Golden Portal Emperor then succeeded the lineage, transmitting it to the Eastern Florescence Emperor, who passed it to Immortal Zhongli of Zhengyang. Zhongli transmitted it to Immortal Lü of Pure Yang, who passed it to Immortal Liu Haichan. Liu transmitted it southward to Zhang Ziyang. The Five Ancestors—Ziyang in the north—transmitted it to Wang Chongyang and the Seven Perfected, splitting the lineage into two streams.

Only Master Li Qing’an, receiving transmission from Wang Jinchan, disciple of the White Immortal Yu Chan, became a patriarch of the Mysterious Gate, inheriting the orthodox transmission of the lineage to illuminate truth. Many of his collected works circulate in the world.

Master Miao Taisu studied under him, imprinting the essentials upon his heart—truly, the indigo blue surpasses the plant. Embracing this Dao, he modeled his teachings on the mind-methods of the ancestral lineage, distilling the pivotal mysteries from various scriptures. Ascending the hall and entering the chamber, he extracted their essentials, adding a turn of phrase to the ancestral words and composing verses on them. Arranged by the sixty-four hexagrams of the *Book of Changes*, with three additional cases for the Three Ultimates, his disciples, led by Wang Cheng’an, compiled and titled it *The Great Cases of the Mysterious Teachings*.

Every word clarifies the root; every sentence returns to the source. Essence and function unite in the One Real; the Three Teachings merge in perfect harmony. It enables one to roam freely beyond Fuxi’s trigrams, to swim in the realm of the Mysterious Sage and the Image-Prior—how sublime!

The Recluse of Huayang, Tang Gong, donated funds to carve the woodblocks and disseminate it widely. His intent is truly magnanimous.

If there are resolute seekers who, beyond these *Great Cases*, possess the eye of the Infinite, piercing through every barrier to achieve sudden clarity and sixfold penetration, then the Daoist lineage will shine brightly, transmitted without end—would this not be splendid?

Respectfully inscribed by Ke Daochong, the Profoundly Silent Daoist of Jinling.

The Heart of the Infinite Heaven embraces all methods; the wisdom-eye of the Image-Prior illumines boundlessly. When nature is utterly empty, the six penetrations and eight directions open; when the mind’s clouds obscure, a thousand differences and ten thousand distinctions arise. Thus, to open the eye beyond heaven, one must first clarify the mind of the world.

In my youth, I studied Confucian learning; in adulthood, I admired the Mysterious Wind. I delved into the origin of principle and investigated the wonders of the heavenly Dao, seeking ever farther and probing ever deeper—yet truly, it seemed unattainable.

By what fortune in a past life did I arrive at the Central Harmony and, in due time, receive the teachings of Master Taisu? His instructions dissolved my burdens, purifying my mind to return to the origin and restore the root. My spirit congealed, my *qi* settled, and I found peace in destiny and joy in heaven. His guidance was earnest and multifaceted, his transformation gentle and thorough.

One day, the foremost disciple of the Central Harmony presented me with the Master’s teachings—ascending the hall and entering the chamber, expounding the treasures of the Dharma-sea, and the poetic verses of the mind-methods of the Daoist lineage—entitled *The Great Cases of the Mysterious Teachings*.

In quiet contemplation, I savored its words and saw how it dissects the One Origin and severs the myriad methods, shaking out the marrow of the host of immortals and threading through the hearts of the ancestral lineage. It sharpens the sword of wisdom, hones the blade of spirit, slays the Three Corpses, executes the Six Thieves, unbinds fetters, shatters shackles, tears through the net of doubt, and severs the hindrance of afflictions. It revives the dead, saves the living, guides the enlightened, and penetrates the great function and great mechanism, reaching the ultimate subtlety and supreme mystery—roaming in the unbegun, delighting in the birthless.

Its wonders of principle and heavenly Dao, its mechanisms of illuminating the mind and seeing nature, are perfectly merged within, each made clear. Having attained such thorough comprehension, how could it remain unheard?

Yet this is but the residue of the Master’s teachings. Having tasted its benefits, I joyfully commissioned artisans to carve the woodblocks, that all men of fortune and wisdom in the world might, through this text, gain a single eye, force open the barriers, shatter the Great Void, return to the original wholeness, revert to pure simplicity, and wander boundlessly in the Infinite, whistling and carefree in the Prior Heaven. This is my sincere wish.

Respectfully inscribed by Tang Daolin, the Recluse of Nine Bends of Green Creek in Jinling.

The sagely immortal Dao embodies the Mystery of the Prior Heaven, its function wondrously manifesting in the myriad methods. Through sincerity and quiescence, it secretly secures the root; through humility, reverence, harmony, and compliance, it beautifully benefits the world.

Master Taisu’s *Great Cases of the Mysterious Teachings* fully reveals essence and function, perfects cultivation and practice, merges the One Real into the wondrous, and unites the myriad principles in returning to the origin. It enables one to nurture primordial *qi*, fuse with the harmonious wisdom-life, still the root-nature, and pacify the mind of the Dao—how magnificent!

How could it be compared to those who fret over silent emptiness, lacking the blade’s edge, or merely chant a tune of heterodox teachings?

I once heard that the Master supplemented the *Yichuan’s Commentary on the Book of Changes*, completing its three unfinished parts. Silently astonished, I exclaimed: Master Yichuan was one of the Six Masters of the former lineage—yet even he left things unfinished. Now Master Taisu has supplemented them. What manner of man is he? I regretted not being able to meet him at once.

By chance, I was appointed to a post at the Southern Terrace. In my leisure, I visited the Central Harmony with three or five colleagues.

Upon first meeting the Master, I found him serene, tranquil, and as unperturbed as still water. When I respectfully sought his instruction, his bearing was gracious and expansive—each question met with an answer precise, lucid, and illuminating, leaving one’s mind suddenly clear and unbounded. I was further granted the privilege of examining his supplementary annotations to the unfinished portions of the *Commentary on the Book of Changes*, as well as his *Net of Changes for Resolving Doubts*. Truly, his words were concise yet principle ran through them like a thread; pure, refined, and luminous, they dissolved in an instant the doubts that had accumulated over years of study. Take, for instance, the very first case of *The Great Public Cases*: it dissects with perfect clarity the subtle pivots of the Three Teachings, the central and upright essence and function, and the partial, obstinate views—all laid bare. He cites the classics throughout, each matter and principle, each mystery and wonder, as if gazing into a mirror where coarse and fine are reflected in perfect roundness. He speaks of the three bodies merging at the ultimate, the six desires sinking into emptiness, the return to the origin through extreme stillness, and the embodiment of the Dao in movement and repose. He teaches that one nurtures one’s heavenly nature with boundless compassion, the mind of the Dao with frugality and restraint, and profound virtue with humility and yielding. He expounds on the five poisonous *qi* in daily sounds and the ten forms of steadfast illness. He lifts the *Gen* trigram of Mount Jian to illuminate the true work of stillness, and inscribes the *Li* trigram of the setting sun to reveal the illusory nature of life and death. The marvels drawn before the hexagrams, the profound mysteries beyond the images, wielding the sacred sword of Fuxi, he cleaves open the mysterious gates of the sages, manifesting the primordial pearl of Yuanshi to illuminate the celestial valleys of the immortals. Such insights were never before articulated by the Daoist and Confucian masters of past generations. Indeed, his wisdom transcends ancient and modern, merging beginning and end in the profound—who but one of the highest primordial clarity could achieve this? As the Sage declared: *"He who acts before Heaven does not contravene it."* How true!

How could I not pay him the reverence due a teacher? Here, I briefly recount the Master’s virtue and its manifestations, his deeds and principles—his marvelous teachings that precede even the words of the primordial. The full embodiment of this lies in the subtle, unbroken practice of those whose wisdom and resolve are aligned.

From the Acting Surveillance Commissioner of the Branch Secretariat, Wang Zhujing, with bowed head, this preface.

True gold fears not the fire; the more it is tempered, the brighter it shines. Flawless jade, free of the slightest blemish, becomes a treasure through careful polishing. But rotten wood and weary iron—even the hands of a master craftsman cannot shape them. Thus, the Old Immortal of *Nanhua* said: *"One with the talent of a sage who receives the Dao of a sage finds it easy. But how many are those who are born knowing?"* Yet even those with innate roots of wisdom, whose understanding pierces all and fuses ten thousand things, still depend on the guidance of an enlightened teacher to ascend directly to the highest realm.

We, however, are of shallow fortune and dull roots, our karmic force ever overpowering our Dao-force. To claim we might leap directly to sudden enlightenment would be self-deception. But if we submit to the Master’s forging and polishing, proceeding from sincerity to clarity, from emptiness to penetration, from discipline to wisdom—step by step treading solid ground, heart by heart embodying the great void—then over time, the turbid will settle undisturbed, and what is fragile will not shatter. Naturally, we will become pure, firm, and unyielding. Is this not the greatest beauty?

Our Master, Shifan the Immortal Boat of the True Hermitage, stands lofty in the realm beyond form, his teachings flourishing at the center of all things. He elucidates the profound mysteries of the Supreme’s heart, dissects the marrow of Fuxi’s legacy, overturns the Three Teachings to fuse them into one origin, sweeps away heterodox sects, and opens wide the true Dao. He carves and refines later students, establishing the great foundation of the lineage, refining the exalted and luminous to reach the primordial境. Thus, good friends and radiant companions gather like clouds, while enlightened lords and worthy ministers follow like the wind. Those who come in emptiness depart in fullness—truly, his silence is more trustworthy than speech. Those near are delighted; those afar come—all accomplish without striving.

We now see that words never spoken expand the myriad wonders beyond the reach of thought and discourse. The *"Dao that can be spoken"* is not the eternal Dao; it encompasses all virtues and stands alone before the throne of the Emperor of Images. Who but one of the utmost clarity, penetrating the ultimate transformation, could partake in this?

Daily, I attend the Hall of the Profound, fortunate to be moistened by the rain of his dharma. I have collected the pearls and jades of his ascending the hall, the treasures of his entering the chamber. Yet though the teachings branch in many directions, their principles converge at one ultimate point. The unresolved cases left by the sages and immortals of past ages—our Master has decisively and clearly settled them all. He has titled this work *The Great Public Cases of the Mysterious Teaching*, arranging it into sixty-four cases to correspond with the sixty-four hexagrams of the *Zhou Changes*. The three cases for entering the chamber mirror the Three Ultimates. Truly, for those of resolute spirit who directly undertake the forging and refining, who inwardly comprehend and diligently practice—dissolving the allure of sound and form, deepening insight into emotion, polishing the heavenly heart, and opening the eye of the Dao—they will suddenly transcend birth and death, illuminating past and present. The great function and the great mechanism are both fully present here. What boundless joy could surpass this?

If one can truly be thus, one will not have failed the Master’s earnest teachings, nor squandered this once-in-a-millennium encounter. Though I am but one man steering the ferryboat of this transmission...

In the year *Taiding Jiazi*, his disciple, Cheng’an Wang Zhidao, with bowed head, respectfully writes this preface.

**The Great Public Cases of the Mysterious Teaching, Volume One**
By Master Golden Lotus of the Dao, Shian the True Hermitage (Miao Taisu)
Compiled by his disciple Cheng’an Wang Zhidao

**Ascending the Hall to Illuminate the Ancient: Sixty-Four Cases**
**First Case**

The *Supreme Dao and Its Virtue in the True Classic* states: "The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao; the name that can be named is not the eternal name." These two lines alone sweep away all dharmas of the Three Teachings—being and non-being, sound and form—enabling the seeker to silently and inwardly grasp them beyond movement and stillness, speech and silence.

Thus, the Dao is neither form nor appearance, neither color nor emptiness; it fully manifests in all things, inherently possessed by all people. It is the great image before heaven and earth began, the supreme spirit before father and mother were born—unattainable by thought, ungraspable by words. For it has no fixed form to discard, and the mind’s wonder has no direction. Only the Dao that cannot be spoken is the true and constant wondrous Dao; only the name that cannot be named is the original, forced designation.

If one clings to what can be named, one falls into external paths; if one clings to what can be spoken, one strays into heterodoxy. Disciples, since the Dao cannot be named or attained, how then is it to be realized? Truly, truly.

*Verse:*
Forced to name it "Dao," like chewing rice to feed a child.
Clinging to words or thoughts, groping walls for fences.
Sinking into emptiness or stagnating in stillness, straying into side paths.
Bending or stretching with intent, clinging to dharmas and rules.
Speaking ceaselessly or sitting in silence, ever-watchful yet deluded.
Observing the mind to turn things—self-obstructed, dull and foolish.
Indulging in "nothingness," drifting in boundless ignorance.
Abandoning knowledge and inner awareness, dragging through mud and water.
Swift with wit, brandishing the whisk or striking the gavel.
Silent or shouting, winking or raising brows.
Preaching as emotions arise, doubting as events unfold.
Spirit and soul in turmoil, consciousness playing tricks.
Boasting grand words, the root and branches scattered.
To call such learning "Dao" is to fall, unwitting, into fox-like delusion.
Better to be pure and simple, sincere and still, subtle and quiet.
In the vastness of the indistinct, the body is one—
the original face before birth, majestic and towering.
Truly realizing the meaning of "not-spiritual" as spiritual,
one overturns the gates of all wonders, delighting in the mysterious and unseen.

**Second Case**

The Supreme Lord says: "The sage engages in non-action and practices the teaching without words." It also says: "Act through non-action." And further: "The Dao constantly takes no action, yet nothing is left undone." Profound indeed! With spiritual insight and intuitive understanding, the Way is present at a glance. Towering beyond the realm of images and emperors, transcending the bounds of form and body—this is the subtlety of the wordless.

What is called "non-action" is not a wooden or clay dummy, which, when pushed, does not move; when called, does not come; when pressed, remains inert—a mere lump of matter. Rather, it treasures that single spark of numinous clarity, perfectly round and undifferentiated, lively and free. Without intention, it acts; now still, now moving, aiding the spontaneity of the myriad things. Thus it is said: "The Dao constantly takes no action, yet nothing is left undone."

Yet who is it that acts through non-action? Ah!

In verse:
The subtlety of the wordless,
the benefit of non-action.
Silent yet potent in influence,
none under heaven can match.
It penetrates the myriad principles,
merging into the Great One.
Where does the One return?
To the undifferentiated and boundless.
Within the boundless, the sovereign abides,
ceaselessly generating and transforming.
Generation without generation,
continuous and unbroken.
In the motionless, the alchemy of purple gold refines;
in the realm of non-action, jade disks are forged.
Alas! Beware of misapprehension.

**Third Case**

The Supreme Lord says:
"The Valley Spirit never dies—
this is called the Mysterious Female.
The gateway of the Mysterious Female
is called the Root of Heaven and Earth.
Subtle, it seems to endure;
drawn upon, it is never exhausted."

This passage fully reveals the wondrous existence of the Dao-heart,
the fundamental truth of the wisdom-life’s true emptiness.
Empty yet without thing, void yet spiritually efficacious—
the real image of the imageless,
the primordial spirit of the non-spiritual—
this is called the Valley Spirit.
Spiritually efficacious yet undimmed:
this is the Valley Spirit’s immortality.
Undimmed spiritual efficacy:
provisionally named the Mysterious Female.
Its pivot and mechanism perfectly free,
thus it is called the gateway of the Mysterious Female.
This is the supreme mystery’s pivotal aperture,
the wondrous opening of the void—
the root of Heaven and Earth,
the wellspring of nature and life.
It opens and closes the primordial qi,
rising and descending naturally.
All disciples, turn the mystery’s pivot with utmost subtlety,
and the imperial ultimate of the prior heavens shall be revealed.

In verse:
The Valley Spirit undimmed, nature’s clarity perfect,
the Mysterious Female’s opening and closing revolve creation.
The lion’s eyes shine bright and clear,
the elephant-king’s nostrils breathe softly and endlessly.
Amid a thousand harmonies and ten thousand unions, subtly continuous,
the one merges the Three Primes in natural embodiment.
Heart and breath interdependent, without interruption,
suddenly—before father and mother were born.

**Fourth Case**

The Supreme Lord says:
"Vague, ah! Elusive—
within it, there is something.
Elusive, ah! Vague—
within it, there is an image.
Dim, ah! Obscure—
within it, there is essence."

But what are this thing and this image?
Ah!
These three are neither non-existent nor existent,
neither yin nor yang,
beyond the reach of the Five Phases,
before the arising of the Seven Emotions.
They are my original true image,
the ultimate reality of the boundless,
the primordial ancestral qi of the prior heavens,
the primordial essence of kalpas untold.
The three are fundamentally one,
one body with three aspects—
this is called the Pure Dharma Body,
this is called the Wondrous Existence of the Empty Body,
this is called the True Dao Body of Non-being.

If one can secure the primordial essence,
drying the sea of desire,
then the Pure Dharma Body becomes complete.
If the true breath is harmonized,
extinguishing the fires of karma,
then the Wondrous Existence of the Empty Body grows robust.
If the primordial spirit congeals,
killing the deluded heart,
then the True Dao Body of Non-being manifests.
The three bodies merge as one,
fusing within the ten thousand dharmas.
Radiant through the cosmos,
virtue perfected in the vast primeval chaos.

Disciples, how then shall this be accomplished?
○ Cease this very breath—
strive with all your might, strive with all your might.

**Verse:**
Neither mind nor nature nor immortal—
one body, three forms, merged within.
Silent, still, the spirit congeals in profound secrecy,
the breath flows ceaselessly, nurturing the Mystery upon Mystery.
The wind of wisdom sweeps clean the mountain’s snow,
the kalpa-fire burns dry the springs beneath the sea.
This is the supreme vehicle’s wonder beyond the wondrous—
only the virtuous, those of kindred spirit, may grasp its heart-transmission.

**Fifth Passage**
The Most High said: There is a thing formed in chaos, born before heaven and earth. Silent, vast, it stands alone and unchanging, circulating without cease—it may be called the Mother of all under heaven.

In days past, my ancestor, the Imperial Lord of Pure Yang, spoke this passage to Master Yan of South Cliff, together guiding Master He of Hunan to the fruition of the Dao. To this day, the three perfected ones share a single lineage, their incense and lamp never extinguished.

Later, the Master composed a verse on this meaning:
*There is a thing born before heaven and earth,*
*formless, originally silent and vast.*
*Embracing the ten thousand images in its body,*
*it does not wither with the four seasons.*

Disciples, what is this one thing?

The Master remained silent for a long while, then said:
It does not consort with the ten thousand dharmas, thus it stands alone and unchanging;
its great perfection is without interruption or extinction, thus it circulates without cease.
Those who attain this Dao can transform without being transformed, give life without being born—
therefore it may be called the Mother of all under heaven.
Mother is the Dao.

Ah! Sincerity, sincerity, sincerity.

**Verse:**

"Sincerity, sincerity, sincerity—profound silence at its utmost;
a single mysterious pearl shines in the vastness of the great void.
Silent and all-pervading, without trace,
vast and solitary, without peer.

Beyond the heavens of prior heaven, primordial qi congeals;
within the boundless, the ancestral wind stirs.
The great mechanism of essence and function is luminously clear—
endless transformations, wondrous and inexhaustible."

**Sixth Passage**
The Most High said:
*"Carrying the po and embracing the One—can you never part from it?
Concentrating qi to attain suppleness, like an infant;
cleansing and purifying the mysterious mirror—can you leave no blemish?
Understanding the four directions—can you remain without knowledge?
Opening and closing the Gate of Heaven—can you do so without passivity?
Loving the people and governing the state—can you do so without action?"*

This passage fully reveals the wonder of mind illuminating mind,
the subtlety of seeing nature and nurturing nature.
The work of nurturing vastness, the wondrous function of the golden elixir—
all are contained within this chapter.

For example:
*"Embracing the One and concentrating qi"*—this is absolute continuity without interruption.
*"Cleansing and purifying the mysterious mirror"*—this is the radiant clarity of the celestial heart.
*"Leaving no blemish in the heart"*—this is purity and luminous brightness.
*"Understanding the four directions"*—this is seeing nature without obstruction.
*"Remaining without knowledge"*—this is containing light and deep nurturance.
*"Opening and closing the Gate of Heaven"*—this is true breath, continuous and unbroken.
The body is the state; qi is the people.
When qi flows smoothly, the body is at peace—
acting without action.

Truly understanding this chapter, the Dao of the golden elixir is complete.
If this is not yet so, carefully consider the following verse.

**Verse:**

The yin po swarms and disturbs,
The yang hun cannot find peace.
Embracing the One to harmonize primordial qi,
Thoroughly penetrating the Mysterious Upper Pass.
The heart-heaven is pure as jade,
The nature-moon reflects the cold pool.
The golden elixir body of the infant,
The baby’s face restored to flawless purity.
The lord enjoys the joy of a peaceful state,
The people know no mountain of self and others.
The hun is clear, the po is numinous and sacred,
Great wisdom delights in tranquil ease.

**Seventh Principle**
The Most High said: *"Thirty spokes share one hub—
where it is empty, lies the cart’s use."*
This chapter teaches one to perceive the root through things,
to forget illusion and preserve the true.
The hub becomes a wheel through the spokes,
the cart becomes useful through the axle.
Originally, there was nothing—
only by cutting wood into vessels
does one provisionally call it a "cart,"
thus completing the cart’s function.
Our body is like this:
from Mud Pill Palace above to Bubbling Spring below,
within the five viscera, without the four limbs,
a provisional assembly of illusory form.
Originally, there was nothing—
only with this illusory form
does one forcibly name it "human,"
thus completing the human’s function.
That which is above form is called the Dao,
that which is below form is called the vessel.
Thus, the formed relies on the formless for ease,
while the formless within employs the formed for function—
vessel and chamber share the same principle.
Now, how does one awaken
to the formless master within?
*Rise.*

**Verse:**

The spokes gather at the hub, and the cart fulfills its use;
Thought returns to the center, and the great Dao flows freely.
The cart moves, the vessel takes form—who exerts the force?
Now, who is the true master within?

**Eighth Passage**
The Most High said: *"Attain utmost emptiness, maintain profound stillness.
The myriad things arise together, and I observe their return."*
This chapter reveals the great samadhi of entering the chamber,
the return to life’s root, true emptiness and ultimate reality—
the most essential and genuine practice.
Emptying all illusory existence, unstained by even a speck of dust, is called "emptiness."
Amid the tumult of the ten thousand dharmas, this heart remains unshaken—this is called "stillness."
When effort reaches its utmost, the six pulses become clear,
the one true nature shines in stillness, returning to its original state.
At this point, the whole body becomes a mouth, yet no word can be uttered.
If I were to reveal it, and your practice suddenly reached this stage,
you would surely scold me for being garrulous.
If I do not explain, I fear you might stray into error here.
As it is said: *"Not knowing the constant, reckless action brings misfortune."*
In the end, what is it?
**Verse:**
Empty, ever more empty; still, ever more still.
Body and mind both forgotten, qi harmonizes and spirit settles.
A single expanse of jade-like emptiness, the heart of heaven shines bright.
Before birth’s arising—who is mortal, who is sage?
Neither true nor immortal, neither mind nor nature.
No words can describe it, nor can it be proven.
Utterly still, utterly sincere—
the secret seal of the center within the center.

**Ninth Passage**
The Most High said: *"That which cannot be seen is called ‘subtle,’
that which cannot be heard is called ‘rare,’
that which cannot be grasped is called ‘elusive.’
These three cannot be further questioned."*
True emptiness has no form, so it cannot be seen;
the great sound is soundless, so it cannot be heard.
This is the wondrous—like clouds emerging from peaks,
like the moon reflected in a pool—
difficult to grasp, impossible to transmit.
Beyond the reach of ears and eyes, untouchable,
yet it cannot be spoken of as unattainable.
If asked, what is it in the end?
Ah! This is the Dao—
radiant above yet not dazzling,
hidden below yet not obscure.
Thus, the higher one looks, the loftier it becomes;
the more one releases it, the more it fills the six directions.
The deeper one delves, the more impenetrable it grows;
when gathered, no trace remains.
Approach it, and its beginning cannot be seen;
follow it, and its end cannot be found.
Shining through past and present, without beginning or end.
Now, who is the master here? Who guides the Dao’s coming?
**Verse:**
Formless, traceless, silent, soundless—
illuminating past and present, called the Crimson Scripture.
Wondrous being, like the moon at the pool’s bottom;
true non-being, like clouds atop the ridge.
Encountering conditions, it silently radiates;
facing the mirror, cease the burning of karmic fire.
Harmonizing the Three Origins, returning to the One Ultimate—
the master remains drunk in bliss all day.

**Tenth Passage**
The Most High said: *"Good conduct leaves no tracks,
good words bear no flaws,
good planning requires no schemes,
good closure needs no bolts yet cannot be opened,
good binding needs no cords yet cannot be undone."*
This is beyond the reckoning of spirits and immortals,
beyond the knowledge of alchemists.
Thus, the sage’s great mechanism and great function
have no gate to enter, no measure to fathom—
all arises naturally, without affirmation or denial.
Master Nanhua said: *"The sage walks all day yet never walks;
speaks all day yet never speaks."*
Thus, though never not walking, the walk is always in the Dao;
though never not speaking, the words always hit the mark.
Every utterance strikes true—what need is there for schemes?
Accomplishing without action—what need is there for cords?
Therefore, the sage’s Dao is unified and all-pervading,
naturally balanced, upright, and just;
benefiting all under heaven, naturally orderly and magnanimous.
Thus, they are ever good at saving people, ever good at saving things,
serving as ruler, serving as teacher,
without self-cherishing or self-aggrandizement.
Though possessing great wisdom, they are like the profoundly foolish.
Alas! Our conduct does not follow the Dao,
our words do not accord with principle.
Worse still, we scheme and calculate,
scrutinize and guard,
flaunt our spirits,
aspire to be teachers,
self-righteous and self-regarding—
self-inflicting calamity and misfortune,
far removed from the Dao.
If we do not immediately repent and renew ourselves,
cultivate virtue and nurture power,
how can we inherit the true illumination of the Most High,
illuminate the world, and benefit all beings?
If this is not yet so, listen to my verse:
**Verse:**
Walking the world without resentment,
speaking the world without fault.
Upside-down, wielding the sword of wisdom against the void—
all dharmas crumble at its edge.
When walking, walk; when sitting, sit.
Hungry, nourish; sleepy, do not lie down.
Silently, silently, inheriting the luminous lord—
within, a cosmos vast as a gourd.

The Most High says: The Dao is eternally nameless. Though the Uncarved Block is small, all under heaven dare not treat it as a subject.

The heart is originally traceless; the Dao is eternally nameless. Though the Uncarved Block is as minute as a speck of dust, its spiritual function knows no bounds. It contains the germ of creation and abides before all phenomena—thus all under heaven dare not treat it as a subject. Those who attain this Dao instantly transcend the realm of things. Their nature mirrors the great void, circulating through the six directions without hindrance, moving and resting unimpeded.

Therefore, the Dao in the world is like rivers and valleys to the great seas—flowing freely, it may turn left or right. Subtle, it may take on color or sound. Gazing, it is before you; suddenly, it is behind. Though this be so, only when all entanglements cease at once and the single thought returns to the center does one realize the primordial Dao has always been self-existent, needing no external source.

Does the assembly understand?

**Verse:**
Heart is Dao, Dao is heart—
no need to ponder or seek apart.
Fame and profit melt like snow, the spirit-terrace gleams bright;
love and attachment thaw like ice, the sea of wisdom runs deep.
Wind sweeps dust clean, the golden tiger crouches low;
clouds disperse, mist clears, the jade dragon sings.
The sky is clear, the sun’s light full and radiant—
all sounds hush, the great tone ceases.

---

The Most High says: Reversion is the movement of the Dao; weakness is the function of the Dao.

When thoughts lean askew, they are corrected by reversion. When the heart harbors delusion, it is restored by awakening. This righting and awakening is itself the movement of the Dao. The sage’s heart is like the great void—pure, still, and natural, without the slightest bias or delusion, embodying the Middle Way. In such rightness and awakening, what need is there for cultivation?

Thus it is said: Abandon learning and have no cares. Purity is the rectitude of all under heaven. Treading humility, dwelling in harmony, blending with softness and weakness—this is propriety, and also the function of the Dao. All things under heaven arise through birth; without birth, there would be nothing.

Assembly, righting corrects the crooked; awakening illumines delusion—these are the movement and function of the Dao. But if one is self-important and self-righteous, refusing to revert or weaken, then the Dao is lost.

**Verse:**
The world is originally without affairs,
yet the human heart stirs itself to fevered busyness.

The rain ceases, and the mountains gleam emerald;
The clouds disperse, and the moon’s full light shines.
Embodying the Dao, the spirit is serene and at peace;
Abiding in constancy, virtue and righteousness exude fragrance.
Sincerity within turns madness into sageliness;
Bias and delusion turn sageliness into madness.
Original nature is without deceit or obscurity—
No need for further inquiry or scrutiny.

**Thirteenth Principle**
The Most High said:
Without stepping beyond the door, one knows all under heaven;
Without gazing through the window, one sees the Way of Heaven.
The farther one goes, the less one knows.
Thus the sage arrives without traveling, names without seeing,
and accomplishes without action.

All under heaven is like a single body;
The Way of Heaven is the original heart-mind.
When the heart-mind is empty and luminous, heavenly principle shines forth.
When the body is upright, all under heaven is at peace.
Thus we know the Dao lies within oneself—
Seeking it externally only leads one farther astray.
Illumination resides in the original heart-mind—
Gazing outward only brings obscurity.

Therefore, the sage turns inward in sincerity and arrives home;
Reflecting upon the hidden and subtle, bright virtue manifests.
Without movement, transformation occurs—yet without proper principle, it is amiss.

Assembly, how effortless this is, and how it spares the heart-mind—
Do you yet comprehend?

Rest, rest.

**Hymn:**
No journey’s path need one traverse to arrive home,
Why strain to plant roots in苦境’s barren loam?
The autumn sky, serene and clear, bathes each house in moonlight’s glow,
Spring’s warmth and harmony make flowers bloom wherever winds may blow.
When *qi* flows in harmony, pour the Queen Mother’s wine with ease,
When the heart is pure, why seek Zhao Zhou’s tea to please?
At peace, at leisure, free from care—no tasks remain,
Why then murmur on, filling five carts with vain scrolls’ weight again?

**Fourteenth Parable**
The Most High said: The superior person hears the Dao and diligently practices it; the middling person hears the Dao and wavers between belief and doubt; the inferior person hears the Dao and laughs uproariously. If it were not laughed at, it would not be the Dao—thus the saying arose.

The superior person is fundamentally noble and pure, their roots deep and untainted. Thus, with a single touch, they turn; their paths open in all directions, naturally unshakable, unmovable even by heaven and earth. Light and swift, continuous and subtle, they advance with vigor, unwavering from beginning to end.

The middling person, however, is entangled by karmic consciousness, bound by profit and fame, inevitably half-doubting, half-believing, wavering between presence and absence.

The inferior person is arrogant and impure, boasting of hollow wealth and empty renown, prizing superficial splendor while despising simplicity and sincerity. Thus, when they hear the sage’s Dao, they laugh derisively. If the inferior person heard the Dao and did not laugh, it would not be the supreme Dao. Therefore, the inferior person crafts clever words to mock and ridicule—yet this is no cause for surprise.

Why is this so?
Those who comprehend the Dao and attain clarity instantly forget the body, like one in a stupor; they are unmoved by worldly affairs, like the indolent. Humble and unassuming, they blend with all, treating all beings as equals. Their great nature is pristine, though outwardly they may seem defiled; their vast virtue is complete, yet they appear lacking. They cultivate hidden virtue in secret, as if stealing; simple and unadorned, they seem as though confused.

Yet the boundless expanse, the great vessel slowly formed, the supreme sound unheard, the great image formless—these elude sight and hearing. The Dao is hidden, nameless, untouchable, empty and still, the very opposite of their expectations. All this the inferior person finds laughable.

Only the lofty and enlightened in the Dao embrace all with tolerance and forgiveness, skillfully employing expedient means, yielding and adapting to circumstances. Thus it is said: "They lend generously and bring to completion."

Assembly, in the three thousand merits and eight hundred practices of the cultivator, this chapter encompasses all. Strive on, strive on!

**Hymn:**
In every thing the Supreme Ultimate’s truth resides,
Yet people, reckless, cast it aside and wallow in delusion’s tide.
The foolish, obstinate, hearts choked by brambles’ snare,
The superior, empty within, their nature pure as jade is fair.
When one recognizes the empty nature of the mind, the original nature is known—
The ordinary person, once enlightened, becomes a true one.
Turning the light inward, entering the mysterious primordial realm,
One may escape the toil of endless rebirth’s wheel.

**Fifteenth Parable**
The Most High said: Those who follow life are thirteen in number; those who follow death are thirteen in number; and those who, while alive, move toward the realm of death are also thirteen. Why is this so? Because of their excessive attachment to the pursuit of life.

The sage, transcending all going and coming, comprehends the absence of birth and death—thus the Great Void remains undivided, neither moving nor abiding. Alas! All people lack mastery over this heart, which flickers and vanishes, emerging and submerging in the mechanisms of existence without end. Why is this so? Because of their excessive attachment to the pursuit of life.

Those who crave abundant nourishment for life find their clothing and food ever insufficient; those who chase wealth and fame find their desires and reputations never sated. As their hearts are perpetually unsatisfied, they indulge the six desires and seven emotions, the Three Corpses and Six Thieves, exhausting their minds and depleting their strength, cunningly scattering their spirit. This causes the fire of the heart to blaze upward while the water of essence seeps downward, water and fire at odds, giving rise to illness, suffering, and torment that persist until death.

Only those who attain the Dao awaken to the illusory nature of karmic consciousness and worldly attachments. Thus, they reverse their emotions to restore their original nature, emptying the heart to embody the Dao. Naturally, fire no longer flares upward, nor does water leak downward. With water and fire in harmony, spirit and qi merge intimately, ultimately realizing the unborn—and thus escaping the realm of death.

Know then that when people, in life, move toward the realm of death, it is because water and fire remain unbalanced, spirit and qi either united or sundered—hence the thirteen. Fire corresponds to seven, water to six; together they make thirteen. The interpretations of this passage are many and varied, each clinging to its own view and fixating on fragmented forms. Some speak of the nine orifices and four gates, claiming that of ten parts, three pertain to life and seven to death. Others cite the waxing and waning of the moon, yet these explanations bear no relevance to self-cultivation and progress.

Only the Ancestral Master, the True Man Yuchan, spoke of the seven emotions and six desires, while my former teacher addressed the disharmony of water and fire—these interpretations are most apt. The text flows coherently, and one may directly apply its teachings. If emotions and desires are not stilled, if water and fire remain unbalanced, then the center lacks steadfast mastery—how can one escape the terrors of tigers, rhinoceroses, armor, and weapons? Only when spirit and qi merge as one does the self and the external world dissolve into oblivion.

Disciples, clearly grasp the true meaning of this passage and strive to practice it diligently. There is no need to inquire further into the great matter of life and death.

*Hymn:*
Life and death of humankind depend on yin and yang,
Yet transcending yin and yang, one returns to the constant.
When water and fire blend in harmony, the realm of death is forgotten;
Qi and spirit, firmly sealed, guard the way of life.
Ox and man both vanish, the nature shines in clarity,
Gull and self, devoid of emotion, both mechanisms fade.
Pointing to the transient forms, the wise return to their native home—
Cease delusion in counting appearances, playing with words.

**Sixteenth Parable**

The Supreme Lord says: The Dao gives them life, virtue nurtures them, things shape them, and circumstances complete them. All things without exception revere the Dao and honor virtue. The Dao’s reverence, virtue’s honor—none confer rank upon them, yet they remain naturally so.

The great Dao’s life-giving is inexhaustible; its mysterious virtue nurtures all equally. Things take form according to qi, and circumstances achieve fruition in due time. Thus, all things without exception revere the Dao as their root and honor virtue as their origin. Therefore, the Dao’s loftiness surpasses antiquity yet does not claim precedence; virtue’s supreme value perfects the myriad things yet does not assert priority. Thus, those who embody the Dao—none under heaven dare treat them as subjects, and lords and kings cannot befriend them—they ever delight in spontaneity.

Of old, Emperor Yao offered the throne to Master Xu You, who declined and withdrew; Emperor Shun offered it to Master Shan Juan, who fled into the mountains. Likewise, Master Zhuang rested beside Ziling, refusing a hundred *yi* of gold and declining a ministerial post. From ancient times to the present, those who have attained the Dao and steadfast scholars—many have refused even three imperial summons—truly exemplifying that the Dao’s reverence and virtue’s honor require no rank.

Yet we of this generation, having not yet realized the true principle nor attained genuine merit, remain ignorant of the Dao’s wondrous profundity and the subtle mysteries of its dark principle. Relying on shallow measurements and narrow views, we delude the foolish masses, flaunting empty words to seek fame and profit—how utterly shameless! Above, we betray the teachings of the immortals and sages; below, we cling to the dust of worldly vulgarity. In thus violating the Supreme Lord’s compassionate instruction, ought we not feel a chill in our hearts? Reform swiftly, reform swiftly!

Disciples, do you wish to awaken and reform at once, or rouse your resolve and practice with diligence?

Ah, this old fool has spoken too much.

*Hymn:*

Highest ranks and noble caps—how the world admires them,
Yet the Daoist, seeing through all, laughs with a chuckle.
Bubbles arise and bubbles vanish—why fuss over such things?
Flowers bloom and flowers fade—how long can they last?

White-clad, one walks naturally, taming the mind’s steed;
With true nourishment, how could one abandon the sacred tortoise?
Leisurely and carefree, spurning the ambitions of kings and lords,
Why fret over others’ scorn or ignorance?

**Seventeenth Admonition**
The Supreme Lord says: *"One whose virtue is deeply contained resembles a newborn child."*

To nurture one’s inherent nature with purity and simplicity is to be like a newborn child. The "newborn child" refers to an infant not yet three months old. At that stage, the primordial *qi* remains undiluted, the primordial spirit serene and obscure, unaware of movement or stillness, sound or form. Its hands stay clenched, its limbs supple, a single sphere of harmonious *qi*, whole and unblemished. Though it cries all day, its throat does not grow hoarse; though venomous creatures and fierce beasts draw near, none sting or harm it. For it harbors no intent toward things, and thus things do no harm in return.

The Supreme Lord uses this to illustrate the path of the true cultivator—how earnest his heart! If we seek to return to the root and restore our original nature, taking this as our model, is it not simple and wondrous?

Yet now, our minds lack a master, our natures know no peace. How then can the primordial spirit settle into stillness, the primordial *qi* ascend into emptiness, that we might resemble the newborn child?

Disciples, *"to grasp the axe and hew the axe-handle—the model is not far off."*

Ah, rest and repose, ceaseless yet ever-present—go forth!

*Hymn:*

The art of nurturing is wondrous,
Inmost, subtle, unbroken, and continuous.
The infant’s heart abides in boundless vastness,
The newborn’s nature is pure and complete.

Who through the ages has grasped its message?
What in life and death truly undergoes change?
Within the Great Void stands the grand image—
Beyond the mysterious, there is no further mystery.

**Eighteenth Principle**
The Supreme Lord says: *"Act without acting, engage without engaging, savor without savoring."*

Disciples, these three phrases hold a wondrous truth. If you fully comprehend them within yourself, the One Reality will become perfectly clear, and all practices will be complete. Should this not yet be so, this old fool will lend his words to clarify for you.

If we awaken to the truth that all things in the world are but illusory, fleeting blossoms, our hearts grow weary of them, and we long for seclusion, instantly relinquishing all entanglements. Like an incense burner in an ancient temple, cold and ashen, we sit in silence, regarding all human affairs as no more than clay puppets—clearly distinct, untouched by them. This may seem correct, yet it is not; it is not the true marvel of the sage’s perfect purity.

Why is this so?
The sage’s heart is like a precious mirror hung in the hall: when things approach, it reflects them; when they depart, it remains empty. Responding to circumstances with fluid adaptability, it is lively, perfectly round, utterly open, and radiantly clear. It follows what is beneficial and enhances it, aiding the natural course of all things. Without affirmation or denial, it acts yet does not act.

All-pervading and infinitely adaptable, it is nowhere absent from the Dao. Like a king wielding a sword, when the myriad phenomena arise, they are effortlessly resolved—this is engaging without engaging. Savoring the essence of virtue and the Dao, one enters the realm of the spirit, nurturing the primordial *qi* in its harmonious ascent, as though drinking jade nectar and ambrosial dew—this is savoring without savoring.

Disciples, do you wish to understand this? Do you wish to practice it with diligence?
Ah!

**Verse:**

A thousand miles without a cloud’s obstruction,
The azure sky with sun at perfect center.
Perfect clarity illumines the cosmos,
Its radiance bright, the void made luminous.
Illumining things with impartial light,
It penetrates the subtle, pervades the vast.
My heart bears not a single stain—
What matter cannot be harmonized?
With skillful means it harmonizes human affairs,
Adapting to the moment, it unfolds the ancestral wind.

**Nineteenth Passage**
The Most High said: A journey of a thousand miles begins beneath one’s feet.
But this single step—where does it first arise?
Disciples, do you understand?

The master remained silent for a long while, then drew a single stroke in the air and said:
Ah! The Great Dao is utterly straight and level, vast and boundless, extending to the ten directions and eight reaches, sixfold in penetration and fourfold in thoroughfare, effortlessly unobstructed.
As the Old Immortal of Nanhua said: *"All day long one walks, yet never walks."*
How effortless! Without the slightest trace.
If you truly grasp this, turn back and practice it with diligence—suddenly you will tread upon your native land, and all the familiar paths of former realms will vanish entirely.
This is called *"leaping beyond the realm of things,"* wandering and chanting in the immortal homeland, carefree in true joy—how wondrous!

**Verse:**
A step need not depend on the foot—
Yet still it traverses the journey’s course.
Not-walking walks in marvelous subtlety,
Nowhere is not vast and level.
The heart’s path, truly empty and cut off,
The celestial thoroughfare—Dao’s great flourishing.
Treading through the wondrous mystery’s aperture,
Joyous and blissful, beyond birth and death.

**Twentieth Passage**
The Most High said: I possess three treasures, which I hold and guard.
The first is *compassion*, the second *frugality*, the third *not daring to be first in the world*.
To dwell in magnanimity and act with benevolence, aiding others and benefiting all things, moved by kindness toward all—this is *compassion*.
Compassion nurtures one’s celestial nature.
To abide in one’s allotted place, simplifying the heart and moderating affairs, speaking with caution and acting with care, sincere and unwavering—this is *frugality*.
Frugality nurtures the heart of Dao.
To receive others with emptiness, to cultivate oneself with humility, gentle and yielding, lowly and deferential, yielding and holding back—this is *not being first*.
Not being first nurtures the supreme virtue.
Disciples, if one is truly compassionate, none in the world can oppose them—thus they are called *courageous*.
If one is truly frugal, true joy abounds—thus they are called *expansive*.
If one truly does not put themselves first, humble yet exalted in glory, lowly yet unsurpassable—thus they perfect their capacity as leaders.
If a follower of Dao lacks compassion, frugality, or humility, they not only lose the Dao, but misfortune will follow.
Can one not be vigilant and cautious, to preserve eternal and perfect good fortune?

The master descended from the seat, bowed with utmost sincerity to the assembly, and recited a verse:
Wealth and honor take humility as their root,
Nobility and eminence take lowliness as their foundation.
Humble and ever-humble, the noble one is blessed;
Arrogant and ever-arrogant, one invites others’ reproach.
Mastering oneself, the heart is without delusion;
Forgiving others, the heart is without deceit.
Still the heart, and desire has no hold;
Harmonious and compliant, one delights in the subtle and serene.

**Twenty-First Passage**
The Most High said: Words have their source; affairs have their ruler.
Only because of ignorance do they not know me.
Those who know me are rare—thus those who model themselves after me are precious.
Therefore the sage wears coarse cloth while holding jade within.
Thus the resolute scholar delights in the Dao and forgets lowly status, abides in virtue and forgets poverty.
Though outwardly in disarray, inwardly they cherish the supreme treasure.
Thus the sage’s original essence is perfectly luminous, and their great function brings boundless benefit.
Therefore, every word strikes the mark, every affair is just and fitting.
Before words are spoken, their source is already present; before affairs arise, their ruler is already established.
Only those ignorant of this mystery speak much that is unwholesome, act with many biases, unaware that the great body of Dao and its marvelous function are quiescent, its central ruler responding and transforming without fixed direction.
Yet those who know this Dao are rare.
If one truly reverses their gaze to the original ruler, firmly preserving it within, then words and affairs will all be orderly and fitting, and nowhere will they not be beneficial.
They become rulers and teachers, revered by heaven and humanity—how surpassing!
Thus it is said: *"Those who model themselves after me are precious."*

Disciples, consider this: In this very moment, who governs speech, silence, and action?

**Verse:**
Before the seven emotions arise, the mystery—
When the six desires do not stir, the moment.
Silent and still, truly forgetting the self,
Within the center—who is it?
Word after word—what is there to say?
Affair after affair—acting without acting.
Exquisite jade concealed within,
A divine pearl shining of itself.
Alas! Clearly I hold forth the treasure within the household,
Yet how pitiful that people, deluded, do not know me.

**Twenty-Second Passage**
The Most High said: To know yet not claim to know is supreme;
Not to know yet claim to know is a flaw.
Only by recognizing the flaw as a flaw can one be without flaw.
The sage is without flaw because they recognize the flaw as a flaw—thus they are without flaw.
As the earlier scripture says: *"Though wise, to be greatly deluded—this is called the essential mystery."*
Thus those who have penetrated the Dao appear clumsy or foolish, dull or inarticulate.
Yet they thoroughly comprehend the original source, contain their light, and silently illumine, naturally manifesting their luminous virtue, shining without dazzling.
Thus it is said: *"To know yet not claim to know is supreme."*
Nowadays, our kind, not yet awakened, claim to be awakened; not yet enlightened, claim to be enlightened.
Like fireflies’ light or a well’s measure, they consider themselves enlightened and penetrating, forcefully arguing and boasting, flaunting their spirit—this is the flaw of claiming to know when one does not.
The sage, possessing pure and abundant qi, a nature of unadorned authenticity, penetrating the eight directions and six thoroughfares, often appears as if without knowledge, uniting the three powers yet always seeming inadequate.
With an empty, tranquil, and serene heart, yielding, gentle, and harmonious, they harbor no self-deception, no desire to prevail or compete, no self-display or self-righteousness—none of the many flaws.
Thus it is said: *"The sage is without flaw because they recognize the flaw as a flaw—thus they are without flaw."*

Disciples, if one truly awakens to one’s own deluded heart and the flaw of claiming to know when one does not, masters oneself and reforms one’s errors, then one’s luminous virtue will daily renew, and joy in heaven will be boundless.

**Verse:**
A hundredfold clumsy, inept, indolent one,
Carefree and at ease, delighting in celestial truth.
Before others, silent and inarticulate, utterly useless—
Yet within, all-embracing, a treasure upon the mat.
Their nature like fine gold, without impurity,
Their heart like exquisite jade, without blemish.

Cease boasting of quick wit and sharp repartee,
Lest you weary yourself with idle chatter and fall into the dust of dharmic defilement.

**Twenty-Third Passage**
The Most High has said: *"The sage does not hoard. The more they give to others, the more they themselves possess; the more they bestow upon others, the more they themselves abound."*

Consider this: Heaven and Earth are the unwitting sages, while the sage is the intentional Heaven and Earth. The Way of Heaven operates without accumulation, thus it ceaselessly generates and transforms, bringing boundless benefit to the world without harm. The sage, empty and without accumulation, thus remains whole and complete, aiding the world through the Dao without contention. Therefore, in nourishing the people abundantly, they find themselves ever richer; in broadly bestowing and aiding the multitudes, they find themselves ever more abundant. This may be called the vast and boundless ocean of the Dharma, an inexhaustible treasury.

Disciples, simply abide in this wondrous Dao of benefiting without harming, acting without contending—here, the great virtue of Heaven and Earth’s ceaseless generation and the sage’s transformative benevolence are fully realized within you. I humbly urge you to treasure this.

**Verse:**
The supreme Dao is profoundly subtle, beyond all reckoning,
The pivot of creation, master of generation and completion.
Heaven’s strength and Earth’s compliance bring forth ceaseless transformation;
The worthy and the sage, in perfect sincerity, nurture life through transformation.
Shun and Yu embodied Heaven—what harm could there be?
Fu Xi and Yao aligned with the Dao—without a trace of contention.
When things flourish and seasons follow in order, people dwell in peace,
The world’s pure wind delights in great harmony.

**Twenty-Fourth Passage**
The *Wenshi Miaodao Zhenjing* states: *"With one emotion stilled, one becomes a sage; with one emotion inclined toward goodness, one becomes a worthy; with one emotion inclined toward evil, one becomes a petty person."*

Disciples, setting aside the question of good and evil emotions, how does one comprehend the state when all emotion is stilled?

Ah!
If you directly accept this in the present moment,
Then the heart of Heaven shines brightly, and your inherent nature abides in fullness.
Should this not yet be so, listen to my vexed words:

Though good and evil are two paths,
The Daoist would do better to cast them both aside.
When the seven emotions are stilled and the self is forgotten,
A single radiant light illumines the vast emptiness.

**Twenty-Fifth Passage**

**From the *Wenshi Zhenjing*:**
The fish that would be unlike other fish leaps from the water onto the shore and dies; the tiger that would be unlike other tigers leaves the mountains for the marketplace and is captured. The sage is no different from ordinary people—only the demands of the times cannot constrain them.

Thus we know that the enlightened Daoists and recluses of old, though clear in their fourfold perception, dwelled in stillness and obscurity, appearing foolish and clumsy. They harmonized their light with the world, blending seamlessly, so that even adepts could not recognize them. Moving or halting as the moment required, responding to stimuli with perfect adaptability, even spirits and gods could not fathom them. Thus the demands of the times could not constrain them, and they attained great freedom.

Yet today, our kind rely on the measure of a dou or shao, flaunting the light of a firefly. Fond of playing the master, putting on airs, prideful and self-satisfied, they seek reputation and chase fame—unaware that they invite demonic obstacles and court disaster.

Disciples, the sage’s parable of the fish leaping onto the shore and the tiger entering the marketplace, leading to the loss of life, is a profound warning. Taking this as a mirror, it is far better to embrace poverty and cultivate the Dao, delighting in one’s allotted fate. In time, boundless joy will arise naturally, and one may become a true and unassuming Daoist—is this not extraordinary?

Vexed words:
Cleverness often turns to clumsiness;
Nothing shines brighter than the guise of folly.

Flaunting talent invites censure and ruin,
While staying true to one’s lot earns trust.
Seeking the hidden draws slander,
Chasing fame brings no ease.
Abiding in the ordinary saves trouble,
Ever at peace, joy knows no bounds.

Twenty-Sixth Maxim
As the *Wenshi Zhenjing* states: The sage gathers the myriad existences into a single breath, yet no thing can enslave his luminous clarity. He disperses a single breath into the myriad existences, yet no thing can obstruct his cloud-like actions. How vast this is!

The single spark of human emptiness—its great substance and great function—lies within a single breath. Thus, when released, it fills heaven and earth, unbounded and unobstructed; when gathered, it withdraws into a millet grain, leaving no trace. Radiant and unobscured, its substance and function fully manifest—nothing can alter it, no thing can question it.

Disciples, if you can awaken to and comprehend this, then speech and silence, movement and stillness attain great freedom. But tell me—how does one embody and examine each breath in this very moment?

In verse:
Vague, it spans heaven and earth;
Fleeting, it dwells in a millet-pearl.
Standing alone on a hair’s tip,
Luminous, it embodies the vast void.
Pursue it—no head is seen;
Follow it—no end is found.
Suddenly, it meets you—
Neither that, nor you.

Twenty-Seventh Maxim
As the *Wenshi Zhenjing* states: The sage, through speech, action, and thought, aligns with others; through never speaking, never acting, never thinking, he differs from others. The Old Immortal of Nanhua says: "Speaking all day to exhaust the Dao, every word is the Dao; speaking all day to exhaust things, every word is a thing. At the ultimate of Dao and things, there is neither speech nor silence."

By this, do the two patriarchs’ teachings converge as one, or remain two? Disciples, if you can thoroughly penetrate this, then speech and silence, action and rest all arise naturally, with nothing permissible or impermissible. If not yet so, turn inward and reflect.

In verse:

A precious mirror hangs in the hall,
Round and bright, free of the slightest dust.
Those who gaze are mirrored in its gaze,
Yet the viewer’s sight is theirs alone.
Beauty and ugliness both appear of themselves—
This mirror is utterly without mind.
Only when eye sees and ear hears truly
May you be called its knowing companion.

Twenty-Eighth Maxim
As the *Wenshi Zhenjing* states: Though the sage’s Dao transforms like a tiger, his conduct crawls like a turtle; though the Dao is tangled as silk, his affairs are arrayed like a board of *weiqi*. Further, the Dao’s rolling and unfurling, the bird’s flight and soaring—all occur within the empty void, and thus their transformations are inexhaustible. The sage’s Dao is likewise.

Thus we know the sage’s ordering of the world: silent, he spiritually transforms; resplendent, his patterns fully manifest. Responding to change, he follows the moment; equalizing all, he magnifies the Dao. Why is this so? The sage’s great substance is the jade-like void, purely unobstructed—thus he allows all transformations to proceed as they will. Clouds and dragons, birds in flight, wind and thunder, rain and mist—ever-changing, yet the great void never alters.

Disciples, we of this generation are constantly mired in sound and form, deluded by being and non-being, clinging to things and indulging our emotions, forcing our abilities and multiplying affairs. Thus our words and deeds lose their footing, our movements and stillness encounter hindrance. How may we recover our original nature of great emptiness and attain the ease of boundless freedom?

Alas—what is to be done? Each must comprehend this for themselves.

In verse:

Majestic as the wind, awe-inspiring and solemn—even spirits cannot fathom him.
Harmonious qi flows with grace, bringing beauty and benefit to all things.
Acting yet not acting, desiring what others do not desire.
Drifting free and unobstructed, swift without haste.

Twenty-Ninth Principle
The *Wenshi Zhenjing* states: The dung beetle rolls its ball, and when the ball is formed, it concentrates its spirit within. Then a white maggot dwells inside the ball, and soon it sheds its shell to become a cicada.
Does the transformation occur without thought? Does the maggot wriggle of itself?
Thus we know: jade uncarved cannot become a vessel; heaven unchilled cannot form ice.
Disciples, we are not born sages. If we wish to learn the sage’s Dao, we must rely on cultivation.
Truly, truly—pure and unadorned—we must apply ourselves diligently to succeed.
But now, with eyes propped open by foreign branches and mouths flapping idly, what good does it do?
The sage, like the dung beetle rolling its ball, focuses its will with single-minded concentration. In emptiness and purity, light shines forth, and the shell is shed to become a cicada.
If even creatures of this kind must labor to achieve transformation, how can we fail to reflect on this?
Thus it is said: Cultivation that transcends cultivation is true cultivation; learning that reaches non-learning is called supreme learning.
Yet here we sit, lumps of matter, dull and ignorant, claiming no need for effort, that supreme learning requires no toil.
This is like scratching an itch through one’s boot—flailing limbs and idle gestures—all yielding no result in the end.
Take heed and strive!
This old fool has spoken too much. I pray you, take care.

In verse:
At first hearing, the wondrous mystery is suddenly penetrated,
With deep roots of fortune and wisdom, and the wind of good affinity.
Nature and life merge, perfecting the Great Ultimate,
Form and spirit both wondrous, embodying the primordial.
Bodhidharma’s nine years polished his jade-like heart,
Wenshu’s six years steeled his golden resolve.
The transcendent immortals of past and present—
All attained their celestial state through merit and virtue.

Thirtieth Principle

From the *Wenshi Zhenjing*:
The multitude let the po govern the hun—when metal is in excess, wood is deficient. The sage lets the hun move the po—when wood is in excess, metal is deficient. Thus wood symbolizes the hun and nature, while metal symbolizes the po and the passions. Ordinary people follow their passions and chase delusion, so their passions are in excess while their nature is deficient. The sage gathers the passions into nature, so their nature is in excess while their passions are deficient. Therefore, those who cultivate the truth still the passions and dissolve perception, so that their original nature becomes perfectly luminous, with no lack or excess. They pacify the dead po and settle the hun, so that their wisdom-life is firm and unbreachable, with no leakage. When nature and passions merge as one, then metal and wood are without division.

Yet joy, anger, sorrow, and delight—love, aversion, and desire—are all passions. Stillness, clarity, and perfect luminosity are nature. Nature is one, while the passions are seven; they are many, and we are few. Thus we are ever overcome by karmic force, while the power of the Dao is vanquished. Disciples, how then can we overcome these seven beasts?

Ah, for others it is difficult to apply effort.

A hymn says:
Seven great demon-kings
constantly harm the master of the house.
When the master lacks resolve and power,
the po and hun gallop like heroes.
With the sword of wisdom, slay the White Tiger;
in the numinous palace, let the Jade Dragon sleep.
In great peace, nothing remains to be done—
drum the belly and delight in the Mysterious Wind.

Thirty-First Admonition
The *Wenshi Zhenjing* states: Those who calculate life and death say either that after death there is something, or that after death there is nothing, or that after death there is neither something nor nothing. Some say one should rejoice, some say one should fear, some say one should accept, some say one should transcend—all these multiply the passions and perceptions.

Disciples, today’s practitioners all claim that the matter of life and death is grave. Yet judging by this scripture’s meaning, these are all empty vexations. Whether there is or is not, whether one rejoices or fears, accepts or transcends—all these multiply the passions and perceptions. They fail to realize that I was never born; who then speaks of death?

I have often said that life and death are but the constant alternation of day and night—what matters is that the heart remain unchanging. Going and coming are but the transformations of movement and stillness—what matters is that one’s nature remain unsullied and undimmed. Thus the old immortal of *Nanhua* said: “Life and death are indeed momentous, yet nothing can disturb the heart.”

Though it be so, one must clarify this here and now to be a person who has resolved the matter. Why is this? If in daily life one cannot be swayed by adversity or fortune, then in the night’s dreams and sleep one cannot be deluded. When dream and waking are as one, life and death present no obstacle. If this is not yet so, then continue to investigate to the end.

A hymn says:

I am originally without coming or going—who speaks of life and death?
Sun and moon ever rise and set, yet how can the great void know darkness or light?
With adversity and fortune unstaining the heart, the realm of dreams is naturally clear.
The wondrous joy of non-arising—through kalpas it celebrates peace and ascent.

**Thirty-Second Entry**
The *Wenshi Zhenjing* states:
Intention shifts, but the heart does not shift.
Intention awakens, but the heart does not awaken.
Only this single heart of mine—then intention is but dust coming and going,
affairs are but fleeting arising and ceasing, while within my heart abides the great constancy.

Thus the heart is likened to fire, intention to earth.
Fire gives rise to earth, just as the heart gives rise to intention.
Without heart, there is no intention; without intention, there is no emotion.
Therefore, when emotion arises, intention awakens, and with the raising of intention, the heart illumines.

Disciples, in daily life use this illumination and awakening,
so that emotional consciousness is emptied, affairs and things are both forgotten,
and responses follow the moment—suddenly arising, suddenly ceasing—all floating and drifting.
Why is this?
Because within my heart abides the great constancy that governs all.
Do you understand?
Hmm.
A hymn says:

Clouds drift away, clouds drift in—the mountain stands still;
Tides rise, tides fall—the sea remains serene.
Tides and clouds come and go without intent,
While mountain and sea, heartless, stay verdant and clear.

**Thirty-Third Passage**
The *Wenshi Zhenjing* states: Someone asked me, "What is your clan, your surname? What is your name, your courtesy name? What do you wear, what do you eat? Who are your friends, your servants? What zither do you play, what books do you read? What is ancient, what is modern?"

At that time, I remained silent, not uttering a single word. The questioner persisted, and I could not but respond: "If you do not even see me, what use is there in knowing what belongs to me?"

I once read in Master Zhu Xi’s *Recorded Sayings*: "Chan began with the Daoists. The Buddhists extracted it from Daoist scriptures, then repackaged and peddled it as their own treasure." Initially, I doubted this, wondering how Daoism could have Chan. But after carefully studying this scripture and the *Nanhua* and others, I realized Master Zhu did not speak idly—truly so.

Master Feng the Venerable said: "Before Kumārajīva was born, the *Nanhua* and *Liezi* already existed." The Perfected One of Wenshi posed these questions, then answered with silence. Disciples, if you can truly awaken to this, you will suddenly comprehend the subtle wonders of the true immortals—you will have already answered. If not, then ponder this: *"If you do not even see me, what use is there in knowing what belongs to me?"*

A hymn says:
Someone asked of me,
"What use is there in knowing what belongs to me?"
Face them with a steadfast heart,
Leaving them nowhere to hide.
Nowhere to hide,
Nowhere to hide.

**Thirty-Fourth Passage**

The *Wenshi Zhenjing* states: "It is like the great sea, which can transform into countless dragons and fish—yet the water remains one. My self and all things flourish abundantly within the great transformation, yet their nature remains one. One who knows this oneness of nature transcends self and other, life and death.

The Three Powers and the myriad beings all emerge through transformation from the Great Ultimate. Since each was endowed with form, every thing possesses a Great Ultimate, preserving the one Heavenly Principle. Within the great transformation, they are born and transform, transforming and giving birth, endlessly. Yet the mind drifts like flowing essence, affairs surge like the wind, and things ripple like waves—never resting, never still.

Thus, from ancient times to the present, we have shifted forms and changed shells, unable to transcend. Disciples, if you can truly awaken to this illusion of emptiness and flowers, forget things and reflect on affairs, turn back the passions and quiet the mind—then your original nature will naturally become perfectly luminous, undisturbed by the myriad phenomena. This master within will be transcendent and free, returning to greatness with ease and lightness. What then could obstruct you with doubts of self and other, life and death? Treasure this, treasure this."

A hymn says:

Fish and dragons transform, yet all are one with water;
Self and others arise, yet all share a single mind.
Same and different, different and same—let go of this and that;
Gold is but earth, earth is but gold.

Alas! Pure is the one nature, the body of great emptiness,
Silent and luminous, transcending past and present.

The thirty-fifth verse of the *Wenshi Zhenjing* states:
Of the one thing, the multitude see only its name,
Perceiving things but not the Dao.
The worthy analyze its principles,
Seeing the Dao but not things.
The sage unites with Heaven,
Seeing neither Dao nor things.
All is Dao—ungrasped, it is the Dao;
Grasped, it becomes a thing.

The *Book of Changes*, in the *Appended Judgments* of Confucius, says:
That which is above form is called the Dao;
That which is below form is called the vessel.
Vessels, too, are things.
Thus the noble one embodies things without omission—profound indeed!

The Śākya school says:
One who can turn things is equal to the Tathāgata.
Applying this wondrous chapter, much effort is expended—
Yet why?
Things are things, the self is the self;
Why turn? Why depart?

Thus the sage is pure and undivided,
Embodying Heaven and Earth,
Naturally forgetting both self and things,
The mind of the Dao undivided.

Disciples, if you can truly see through this,
Unite self and things, preserve the heavenly principle—
This master within will be lively and fluid, perfectly whole,
Spacious and unobstructed, without fixed constraints,
Embodying the subtle before images arise,
Instantly transcending beyond the realm of things.
True joy is boundless—
Why cling to the illusion of self?

Treasure this, treasure this.

A hymn says:

When attachment to being reaches its end, it becomes delusion;
Clinging to non-being ultimately falls into dead emptiness.
When neither being nor non-being is established, the mind transcends all—
Where clarity is not yet through, there too is clarity.

Thirty-Sixth Case
The *Wenshi Zhenjing* says:
Of Heaven, Earth, and the ten thousand things,
Not one is my own thing.
Things are not my things, yet I cannot but respond;
I am not my self, yet I cannot but nurture it.
Though responding to things, there has never been a thing;
Though nurturing the self, there has never been a self.
Do not say "external things" and then exclude the self;
Do not say "external form" and then exclude the mind.
The Dao is one—there is no sequence of progression.

How great are the words of the sage!
When things come, respond with sincerity;
When things depart, be empty—serene and unattached,
This is what is meant by "neither clinging nor rejecting."
Wearing linen in summer and furs in winter,
Eating when hungry, drinking when thirsty,
Abiding in one’s lot, following what is fitting,
Moving with the times, stopping when the time is right—
These are all ordinary, fundamental matters.
Use what can be used, rest when one may rest,
Adjusting with the seasons, harmonizing with nature,
Without straining the mind or expending effort.
This is what is meant by "attending to non-attention, acting without acting"—
How light and free!
Why distinguish between external things, external form, or external mind?

Disciples,
Respond to things yet forget things,
Nurture the self yet forget the self—
Naturally, all is settled at once, and the original nature transcends.
Thus it is said: "The Dao is one—there is no sequence of progression."

A hymn says:
Facing circumstances as if there were none,
In the dust yet free from dust’s stain.
Neither self nor others obstruct—
The Dharma King’s body fills the great earth.
Once penetrated, the ten thousand merge without a single thing;
Within and beyond Heaven and Earth, all is my body.

*Xuanjiao Dagong’an*, Volume One—concluded
*Xuanjiao Dagong’an*, Volume Two

Master Jinsheng Daoshi, Shian Xiansheng, presented by Miao Taisu;
Compiled by disciple Cheng’an Wang Zhidao—Case Thirty-Seven

The *Wenshi Zhenjing* states:
Do not condemn the world while affirming the self,
Do not belittle others while exalting the self,
Do not disregard the Dao while prizing the self,
Do not slander others while praising the self’s virtue,
Do not despise others’ meagerness while flaunting the self’s talent.

To condemn the world while affirming the self is self-righteousness.
To belittle others while exalting the self is self-aggrandizement.
To disregard others while prizing the self is self-importance.
To slander others while praising the self’s virtue is self-proclaimed ability.
To despise others’ meagerness while flaunting the self’s talent is self-conceit.

Disciples,
The above five matters are what the Perfected One of Wenshi urgently remedies in our fellow learners’ moral ailments. We must immediately awaken and reflect inwardly. Should even one of these persist, swiftly repent and reform to become a true follower of the Dao. If one denies cause and effect, remains deluded, and refuses to change, these five faults will breed five kinds of poisonous qi, bringing self-inflicted calamity and suffering.

If self-righteousness remains uncorrected, it accumulates a malevolent qi;
If self-aggrandizement remains uncorrected, it accumulates a domineering qi;
If self-importance remains uncorrected, it accumulates an arrogant qi;
If self-proclaimed ability remains uncorrected, it accumulates a resentful qi;
If self-conceit remains uncorrected, it accumulates a haughty qi.

Such qi arises from the inherent shallowness of one’s constitutional temperament and the polluting habits of worldly winds. Once these five poisons take root, they give rise to anger, hatred, affliction, misfortune, and suffering, becoming one’s own demonic obstructions while virtue and conduct are utterly lost. The original true nature is thus shrouded in mist and darkness—how then can one speak of illuminating the mind and perceiving the nature, or boast of profound Chan mysteries? This is nothing but covering one’s ears to steal a bell.

Ah! Be cautious, be ever cautious.

A hymn says:

The foolish are born into poverty, dull and deluded,
Utterly devoid of learning, perception, or wisdom.
Among all the clumsy and crude in the world, none compare to me—
How could I dare display my claws and hooves before others?

**Thirty-Eighth Passage**
The *Wenshi Zhenjing* states: Those who once discoursed on the Dao spoke of it as "serene quiescence," "profound depth," "lucid clarity," "emptiness in unity," or "obscure darkness." Take care not to encounter these terms and retreat in fear.
The supreme principle of the world transcends words and concepts. If one knows it is neither word nor concept, one aligns with my teaching, dwelling beyond subtle words and wondrous meanings.
Disciples, this passage pierces our kind—clinging to phrases as if they were profound mysteries, we fall to one side, unable to merge with the great unity.
Truly awakening to the ineffable subtlety, one leaps directly to the highest realm, attaining the true principle of the *Wenshi Zhenjing*, which must be realized beyond language.

A hymn says:
Serene quiescence is but dull stillness,
Profound depth belongs to illusory yin.
What reality lies in emptiness in unity?
Lucid clarity sinks into torpor.
Obscure darkness is dim and unilluminated,
Subtle words entangle one in dharmic dust.
When all is seen without obstruction,
Joy and bliss fill the celestial mind.

**Thirty-Ninth Passage**
The *Chongxu Jing* states: A man worried that heaven and earth would collapse.
A perfected one explained: "That is one, this is one.
Thus, in life I know not death; in death I know not life. Coming, I know not going; going, I know not coming. Whether it collapses or not, why should I concern myself?"
It also says: "When the spirit enters its gate, the bones and frame return to their root—what of me remains?"
Disciples, life and death are like day and night; going and coming are like winter and spring.
Thus the sage, comprehending this mystery, regards life and death, going and coming with a mind as vast as the Great Void, utterly forgetting all knowledge. Naturally and spontaneously, this body is also heaven and earth.
Thus it is said: "That and this are one."
One then knows that when the spirit returns to its origin, illusory transformations dissolve into emptiness. The singular truth is one with the present—transcendent and solitary, why ask further, "What of me remains?"
Gentlemen, if you each realize this now, act accordingly at once. Do not wait until the end to deliberate.

A hymn says:
Illusory forms, being formed, must perish,
The true origin, being formless, endures forever.
Now, with all seen as unobstructed,
Transcendent beyond the three realms, one stands alone and supreme.

**Fortieth Passage**

The *Book of Master Chongxu* states: The Lord of Lu heard that Kang Cangzi had profoundly attained the supreme Dao of the Great One, capable of seeing with his ears and hearing with his eyes, and so dispatched his highest minister with lavish gifts to invite him. The Lord of Lu humbly entreated him for instruction. Kang Cangzi said: "Those who transmit such claims are deluded. I can see and hear without relying on ears and eyes, but I cannot alter the natural function of ears and eyes." The Lord of Lu said: "This is already a wondrous augmentation—what then is the Dao? I earnestly wish to hear of it." Kang Cangzi replied: "I am able to unite my body with the mind, the mind with qi, qi with spirit, and spirit with nothingness. When there is the slightest presence, the faintest sound—whether distant beyond the eight wilds or near as the space between my brows—whatever comes to disturb me, I must know it. Yet I do not know whether this awareness arises from the perception of my seven apertures and four limbs, or from the knowledge of my heart, belly, and six viscera. It is simply self-knowing, and nothing more."

The Lord of Lu was overjoyed and reported this to Confucius. Confucius merely smiled and did not respond.

Disciples, when you forget the self and enter the mystery, empty the mind and embody the Dao, then body and mind merge perfectly, spirit and qi fuse wondrously. Thus the singular nature becomes one with the Great Void, and the six senses function interchangeably. How vast is the true person who realizes such perfect attainment!

Alas for the Lord of Lu—though he rejoiced and revered Kang Cangzi, he remained deluded by the allure of rank, glory, sounds, and sights, unable to awaken. He then relayed this to Master Xuan. But why did Master Xuan not answer?

A verse for contemplation says:

The Three Origins merge in mystery to return to the Boundless,
The singular nature shines perfectly, embodying the Great Void.
Truly unite the six senses at their undivided source,
Where non-roundness is also roundness.

**Forty-First Passage**
The *Book of Master Chongxu* of the Immortals states: Long Shu suffered from ten kinds of illness and sought the physician Wen Zhi.

Wen Zhi inquired about his symptoms. Long Shu said: "In my village, praise brings me no honor; national disgrace brings me no shame. Gain does not make me rejoice, nor loss make me grieve. I regard life as death, wealth as poverty, others as myself, and myself as others. At home, I dwell as in an inn; my village, I see as a foreign land.

All these afflictions—neither rank nor reward can sway me, neither punishment nor threat can intimidate me, neither prosperity nor adversity can alter me, neither sorrow nor joy can move me—what illness is this?"

Wen Zhi gazed at him intently and said: "Ah! Your mind is empty—you are nearly a sage. The six apertures of your heart flow freely, yet one remains unopened. Now you take sagely wisdom as illness—this is beyond the reach of my shallow art."

Disciples, Long Shu’s "illness" lies in his equanimity toward honor and disgrace, gain and loss, life and death, wealth and poverty, self and other—all met with a single smile. Thus, to realize sagely wisdom is to attain perfect roundness, the six penetrations unobstructed, naturally and effortlessly.

Why then is it said that one aperture remains unopened?
Ponder this in silence. If you penetrate this single aperture, you shall attain the leakage-free state.

A verse for contemplation:
Long Shu’s tenfold illness,
The enlightened should awaken to its proof.
The six penetrations, unobstructed and free,
Recognize nature as the empty sky’s essence.
When the upward aperture opens wide,
The one truth fuses with wisdom and life.
Life and nature fully realized,
Like jade in purity, gold in unyielding luster.

**Forty-Second Passage**
The *Book of Master Chongxu* states: That which arises without cause yet is ever-present is the Dao. That which arises from arising, though ending, is not forgotten—this is constancy.

Thus, arising without use is called the Dao; using the Dao to attain an end is called constancy. Dying without use is called the Dao; using the Dao to attain death is called constancy.

Disciples, this passage illuminates the constancy of the Dao’s essence, which knows no cessation.

"Without cause yet ever-present" means arising from no origin, unaware of life as life—this is the Dao. Life without attachment to life—though the body dies, the fundamental nature does not perish—this is constancy. Thus, arising without use is called the Dao; embodying the Dao to attain an end is called constancy.

Through this, awaken to the wondrous constancy of the true Dao, which is the body of spontaneity. Why then fear impermanence?

A verse for contemplation:
Sun and moon have brightness and darkness,
The Great Void knows neither.
Nature is the body of the Great Void—
What change can birth and death bring?
Alas! Though mulberry fields turn to seas,
A single point remains serene and clear.

**Forty-Third Passage**
The Old Immortal of Nanhua said: "Illumined by Heaven, penetrating the sagely, the six penetrations and fourfold thoroughfares—all is dimly and indistinctly still.

The stillness of the sage is not like the dragon’s stillness, which is still because it is good at stillness. The myriad things cannot disturb the sage’s heart—thus is he still.

When water is still, it clearly reflects even the finest hairs, its levelness serving as a standard for the great craftsman. If still water alone is so luminous, how much more the sage’s spirit-filled heart?"

Disciples, this chapter focuses entirely on the word *stillness*.

Students are often swept away by adversity and fortune, obstructed by affairs and things, unable to endure. They seek a secluded place to rest, yet unwittingly add another thought—the thought of seeking stillness. Even in remote solitude, they find only more toil and distraction. How pitiful!

The Old Immortal of Nanhua, with the word *good*, reveals the essential work of true stillness. This *good* is not the good of good and evil, but the sage’s innate capacity.

The sage’s heart is empty, luminous, vast, and clear—still, round, and radiant, like a hanging mirror. When things come, it reflects them; when they depart, it is empty. No forms of beauty or ugliness remain. The mind is utterly limpid, ten thousand miles away yet brilliantly clear. Is this not simplicity and wonder?

Thus, if still water can so clearly and evenly reflect things, how much more the single luminous emptiness of the human heart? Truly penetrate this, and affairs will no longer disturb; the heart will cease its restless striving. Become a carefree Daoist—how light and free!

A verse for contemplation:
Neither abiding in movement nor stillness,
Unobstructed in coming and going.
Within the four dignities,
Attain great freedom.
Acting without acting,
Benefiting without harming.
A single point of emptiness,
Encompasses the vastness of a sand universe.

**Forty-Fourth Passage**
At the beginning of the "Equalizing Things" chapter in the *Book of Nanhua*, the Old Immortal answers questions about the three winds with two disciples.

First, he speaks of the inequality of human and earthly winds—this aligns with Mencius’ saying, "Things are unequal; such is their nature." Finally, he speaks of the heavenly wind: "Though the myriad sounds differ, they let each be itself"—the myriad apertures roar and sigh, all winds stilled and empty. Who is the master of this moment?

First, he speaks of nature; then, of principle. Principle is one, yet its manifestations are many. Guest and host are distinct, yet the unequal is made equal.

Within this, he offers broad analogies to illustrate the endless transformations of things, all changes unified in the numinous. At the end, he uses his dream of the butterfly to encapsulate the chapter’s great meaning: suddenly, he dreams he is a butterfly, fluttering contentedly; suddenly, he awakens, and there is Zhuang Zhou. Does not know: was Zhou’s dream the butterfly, or the butterfly’s dream Zhou?

Between Zhou and the butterfly, there must be a boundary—yet here, he does not speak it plainly.

Disciples, consider: who now dreams, and who awakens? Truly awaken to this clarity, and you will know that life and death, dream and waking, are equally subsumed in the great transformation, within which stands the solitary, towering one.

Thus it is said: Only with this great awakening do we know this was the great dream.

If this is not yet so, listen to my later verse:
Things and self share the same womb, one source.
In inequality, equality—square and round alike.

Each follows its passions to forge its karmic shell,
Yet returning to the root, all merge in the Great Ultimate’s ring.
The myriad sounds fall silent, heaven’s breath stills—
One mind, serene and solemn, knows the heart’s hidden depths.

Transformation births and transforms through its own changes,
Dream and waking both forgotten, joy precedes all forms.

In the forty-fifth passage, the Old Immortal of *Nanhua* says:
Confucius taught Yan Hui the fasting of the mind. Hui asked, “May I inquire about the fasting of the mind?”
Confucius said: “Unify your will. Do not listen with the ears, but listen with the mind. Do not listen with the mind, but listen with *qi*. Listening stops at the ears; the mind stops at the resonance of *qi*. *Qi* is emptiness awaiting things. Only the Dao gathers in emptiness—emptiness is the fasting of the mind.”
Hui said, “Before I received this teaching, there was truly only Hui. Having received it, there has never been a Hui—may this be called emptiness?”
Confucius said, “It is complete.”

Disciples, behold: the Sage declared a single word—*emptiness*—to transmit the fasting of the mind to Yan Hui. Profound indeed! Yan Hui, upon hearing it, penetrated it instantly and directly transcended to the realm of sages. “There has never been a Hui”—this is to say, he suddenly forgot the self, no longer knowing Hui existed. The Sage affirmed it as complete.

Now, of seeing, hearing, speaking, and smelling—why did the Sage single out hearing for direct instruction? Because listening with the ears is the hearing of the common; it merely follows sound. Listening with the mind is the hearing of the worthy; it attains resonance. Listening with *qi* is the hearing of the sage—returning to the root.

Since birth, each person is endowed with a Great Void, each receives a primordial *qi*. When the mind is empty, primordial *qi* flows freely; when *qi* stills, spirit shines bright and clear. Neither separate nor identical, their wondrous interplay severs the paths of the heart, polishing the sky of nature to flawless purity. Thus it is said: “An empty chamber generates light; auspiciousness abides in stillness. Attain the utmost emptiness, and the radiance of heaven shines forth—mysterious, and again mysterious.”

How fitting that the Buddha’s Avalokiteśvara, in the practice of perfect penetration, entered through hearing and attained the fruit of the Way—hence the name *Guanyin*. The ancient sages’ nature and the Way of Heaven are fully contained herein. How could one not hear of this?

Alas, treasure this well.

Verse:

"Mouth pure yet heart impure—how can one reach the original source?
Unswerving in the precepts of sincerity and Dao, unwavering in mind-fasting’s clarity.
The spirit-valley remains unstained, the numinous terrace free of dust.
The Great Void shines bright and clear, wisdom’s sun illumines the celestial steps."

Forty-Sixth Entry
Master Nanhua’s *Autumn Floods* presents six exchanges between the River Earl and the Ocean Spirit, like wind lashing stone or snow-capped waves surging through the sky—striking terror into the heart, leaving one disoriented and lost. Yet by the closing lines, the limpid azure sea mirrors the vault of heaven, calming the spirit and restoring the breath, returning to utmost tranquility and truth.

Disciples, why this return?
It all converges upon the three words: principle, Dao, and expediency.
Thus it is said: One who grasps the Dao must comprehend principle; one who comprehends principle must grasp expediency. One who grasps expediency is not harmed by external things.
It further states: Discerning safety and peril, abiding in fortune and misfortune, cautious in departure and approach—nothing can cause harm.
Thus, "Heaven resides within, humanity without."
With Heaven within, purity remains unadulterated and the great body aligned; with humanity without, responses adapt without constraint and great function harmonizes.
Herein lies the seamless, boundless flow—Dao governed by principle, affairs conducted through expediency. Safety and peril, departure and approach, embodying Heaven and responding to humanity—how could calamity, demons, or harm ever arise?

At this point, the River Earl’s mind merges in silent accord, and no further questions remain.
Fittingly, Su Dongpo declared: "Go three days without reading *Nanhua’s Autumn Floods*, and one’s words grow stale, one’s writing dull."
Truly, with clear awakening, daily practice becomes natural—all demonic hosts vanish, and boundless true joy arises.

Hold fast to this truth.

A verse declares:
The River Earl beheld autumn’s flood,
its swelling waters breaching the banks.
Yet when he gazed upon the Sea Lord,
he stood in awe, sighing without end.
The frog in the well peers at the sky,
while the turtle in the sea feels shame.
Perception reveals depths and shallows—
each must grasp the principle aright.
The great body wields the great expedient;
fortune and misfortune turn on oneself.
Embody the Dao in plain constancy,
find joy in Heaven, and flow from beginning to end.

**Forty-Seventh Passage**
The Old Immortal of Nanhua said: *"Shatter the fervor of ambition, untangle the delusions of the heart, shed the burdens of virtue, and clear the blockages of the Dao."*

The six of *nobility, wealth, eminence, dignity, fame, and profit*—these stir ambition.
The six of *appearance, movement, complexion, pattern, qi, and intent*—these delude the heart.
The six of *aversion, desire, joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure*—these encumber virtue.
The six of *departure, approach, taking, giving, knowledge, and ability*—these obstruct the Dao.

These four sets of six, when not swept from the breast, leave no room for uprightness. Uprightness brings stillness; stillness brings clarity; clarity brings emptiness; emptiness brings non-action—and yet nothing remains undone.

Disciples, shatter ambition and untangle the heart; shed burdens and clear blockages—each of these six matters is an obstacle, a demon in our path.
When ambition defies principle, the Dao of Heaven is cut off—thus shatter it.
When the heart is deluded, affairs become entangled—thus untangle it.
When virtue is burdened, judgment grows clouded—thus shed it.
When things obstruct, the center remains unempty and unpenetrated—thus clear it.
All these arise from human desire.

When these four sets of six are swept from the breast, they give way to central equilibrium, purity, stillness, luminous clarity, and empty penetration. In this state, one may fully exalt the Dao and deepen virtue, perfecting nature and completing the heart.

This passage is the Old Immortal of Nanhua’s special admonition to later learners—a crucial effort on the path to gradual refinement. Chew it slowly, savor its boundless meaning.

Hold fast to this truth.

A verse declares:

When common emotions and human desires abound, the four sets of six obstruct the celestial mechanism.
Reduce affairs, and the heart remains free of delusion.
Forget entanglements, and the will knows no error.
When emotions are emptied, virtue sheds its burdens;
when nature is realized, the mind holds no doubt.
In central stillness, the heart is empty and penetrating—
in non-doing, nothing is left undone.

**Forty-Eighth Passage**
The Old Immortal of Nanhua once said:
There is a beginning;
there is that which precedes the beginning;
there is that which precedes even the preceding of the beginning.
There is being;
there is non-being;
there is that which precedes non-being;
there is that which precedes even the preceding of non-being.
Suddenly there is being and non-being—
yet who can say whether being and non-being truly have a claim to existence?
Or truly have no claim?

Interpretations of this passage’s five "precedings" vary, each with its strengths and flaws, yet none strike the mark, leaving readers with an ever more distant and abstruse impression. Some align them with the Five Primes of the Perfected Immortals, offering a somewhat coherent explanation. Yet they fail to grasp that these refer to the being and non-being of this very body—from the most profound non-being to the subtlest being—further fused into a single "preceding," each stage leading deeper into the next. Truly wondrous, truly pure.

Consider this: if this body exists, from whence did it arise?
It came into being through a single thought—thus thought is the "preceding" of the body.
Thought arises from the heart—thus the heart is the "preceding" of thought.
The heart arises from nature—thus nature is the "preceding" of the heart.
Where there is qi, there is nature—thus life is the "preceding" of nature.
The original luminous nature is true non-being;
the empty, luminous life is wondrous being.
When true non-being and wondrous being fuse into a single "preceding,"
this is the Supreme Ultimate before its inception,
before parents gave birth—
the one true and real image,
the Jade Void’s wondrous essence,
the pure Dao-body,
the beginningless beginning.

Disciples, invert your inquiry and pursue it to the end—
each stage ascending higher,
gradually entering the sublime.
At this point, you will realize that heaven and earth are born with me,
and the myriad things are one with me.
All distinctions of right and wrong, self and other, sound and form, being and non-being
are but illusory flowers in the air, mirages in the sun.
True joy arises naturally—how simple, how wondrous!

Listen to the verse:
The five "precedings" of Nanhua,
trace them back to the source.
This thought arises from the heart,
the heart from nature’s rise.
Nature depends on the root of life—
nature and life share a single path.
Wondrous being fuses with true non-being,
the mysterious Jade Void’s essence.
The resolute awaken in truth—
true joy is beyond birth.

**Forty-Ninth Passage**
The Old Immortal of Nanhua offered a parable to illuminate the heart through the principles of things, awaken the celestial mechanism, and realize the Dao. Yet his meaning is profound and subtle, delving into the marvelous and extraordinary.

He spoke of six things:
Kui pities the centipede,
the centipede pities the snake,
the snake pities the wind,
the wind pities the eye,
the eye pities the heart.
(The centipede here refers to the *wugong*.)

Beginning with three creatures, he extends the analogy to wind, eye, and heart—
revealing the grand workings of creation and the celestial mechanism in clear and radiant terms.
The many or few legs of Kui and the centipede are likened to the size of spittle’s spray—pearls or mist.
The snake, though legless, moves swiftly—
like the sage’s movements, transformations, contractions, and extensions,
responding to the celestial mechanism in slowness or speed,
all arising naturally.
Next, the wind—
rising tumultuously from the Northern Sea,
entering the Southern Sea,
shifting from yin to yang,
vanishing in an instant—
transcends all things of form, surpassing them in marvel.
Finally, the eye and the heart are left unspoken.

Disciples, do you grasp the meaning?

Should some still not grasp it, this humble one shall lend voice to expound—yet the honorable ones must meet it with silent, sincere accord.

Behold: the eye, with but a single glance, encompasses ten thousand miles; the farthest shores and ocean’s edge lie all beneath its gaze. The heart, with but a single stir, holds within it the great earth and all its mountains and rivers. Such is the celestial mechanism in motion—arriving without traversing, swift without haste. Ought one not take heed and turn inward in vigilance?

Like the wind at its first rising, its power seems faint and slight—yet soon it topples mountains and uproots trees, growing from the faintest breath to the mightiest force. The work of creation in our very breath follows the same pattern. Once the honorable ones directly awaken to the great mechanism and its wondrous workings, effort falls away of itself.

A verse says:
The Great Dao is present in all,
Each thing enfolds it whole.
Kui’s hooves swift as the centipede,
The serpent’s flight slow as the wind.
The celestial mechanism fuses with the Purple Ultimate,
The profound principle embodies the Yellow Center.
Dissolve the knowing of being and non-being,
Forget the passions of emptiness and non-emptiness.
Turn inward to the heart’s subtle wonder—
Face-to-face with the Master within.

**Fifty-Third Entry**

When the Yellow Emperor heard that Guangchengzi had secluded himself on Mount Kongtong, relinquishing the world, he built a solitary chamber, spread a mat of white cogon grass, and dwelled in stillness for three months before going to seek the Dao. Guangchengzi lay facing south, and the Yellow Emperor approached on his knees from the downwind side, bowing twice with his forehead to the ground. He asked, “I have heard that you have attained the utmost Dao. I venture to ask: how ought one cultivate the body for long life?”

After a long while, Guangchengzi rose abruptly and said, “Excellent question! Come, I shall tell you. The essence of the utmost Dao is profound and obscure; its ultimate reaches are dim and silent. See nothing, hear nothing—embrace the spirit and be still, and your form will right itself. Be still, be pure; do not weary your form, do not agitate your essence. Let your heart be serene and still, free from restless striving. Let the heart know nothing, and your spirit will guard your form. All things are boundless, yet people take them to be finite. Those who attain my Dao enter the gate of the boundless and wander the fields of the infinite.”

Disciples, the original spirit of humanity cannot guard its dwelling, for it is disturbed by emotions giving rise to thoughts, and thoughts stirring the essence. Guangchengzi taught the Emperor to still the heart from all knowing, that the spirit might guard itself—how profound! Even the Yellow Emperor, that great sage, prepared himself with three months of cogon-grass seclusion and approached his teacher on his knees from the downwind side to inquire of the Dao. What are we compared to him? If we cannot do likewise, how shall we enter the gate of the boundless or wander the fields of the infinite?

Alas! A verse says:

"When the heart severs its restless clamor, the spirit abides in its dwelling;
When essence ceases its agitation, qi returns to its root.
The qi and spirit interweave in serene stillness—breath within breath—
Straightaway entering the Gate of the Mysterious Origin, the Portal of Myriad Wonders."

Fifty-First Entry
The *Nanhua Sutra* states: The Yellow Emperor roamed above the Red Waters, ascended the heights of Kunlun, and gazed southward. Upon returning, he had lost his Mystic Pearl. He sent Knowledge to seek it, but it was not found; he sent Departed Brilliance to seek it, but it was not found; he sent Eloquent Reproach to seek it, but it was not found. Only then did he send Indistinct Image, and Indistinct Image found it.

The Yellow Emperor exclaimed: "How extraordinary! Can Indistinct Image alone retrieve it?"

Disciples, this single Mystic Pearl is possessed within each person, shining from antiquity to the present, its radiance piercing heaven and earth. Yet, veiled by the dust of worldly desires and obscured by the clouds of mundane affairs, the bright vision gallops astray, and intellect ranges unchecked—thus the pearl is lost and forgotten. Those fortunate enough to seek this pearl may do so through eloquent discourse, or by conjecture with cleverness, or by pondering with intellect. The clearer the seeking, the more distant it becomes; the sharper the search, the more elusive it grows. Thus, the Yellow Emperor’s three envoys all failed to retrieve it. Only with Indistinct Image was it found. What does this mean?

Let one detach from speech and knowledge, forget brilliance and understanding, sincerely abide upon the cinnabar mound, and plunge the mind into Indistinct Image—then a single point of perfect clarity will naturally shine through. How simple and wondrous this is!

Re-examining, the verse says:
A priceless pearl lies buried deep in mud.
With cleverness and intellect we grope—
all belongs to "this" and "that."
Yet when the mind sinks into Indistinct Image,
unawares, the pearl’s radiance rises.
Leaping forth from the limpid abyss,
its perfect brightness illumines the Great Void.

**Fifty-Second Passage**
The *Nanhua Sutra* states: Nie Que asked the Way of Bei Yi. Bei Yi said: "Straighten your form, unify your gaze, and the harmony of heaven will arrive. Gather in your knowledge, unify your judgment, and spirit will come to dwell. Virtue will adorn you, and the Dao will be your home. You will be dazed like a newborn calf, seeking no former cause."

Before the words were finished, Nie Que seemed to fall into slumber, his form already forgotten. Bei Yi rejoiced greatly and departed singing.

Disciples, when the ancients heard the supreme Dao, their forms were forgotten and their minds intoxicated, returning to the original perfection of inherent goodness. This is what is meant by "straightening the form and unifying the gaze"—sincerity preserved whole, containing light without duality. "Gathering knowledge and unifying judgment"—thought dissolved, spirit congealed in singular essence. Thus, like a newborn calf, one is pure and whole, without contrivance. When mind and spirit merge as one, self and other are both forgotten, and one does not know the *how* yet naturally *is*. How fitting that the true master sang in true joy, for he truly knew—without clinging to the past.

Now, our karmic burdens are heavy and blessings light; we cannot swiftly attain this. Yet if we can truly believe and sincerely, silently abide, proceeding thus with wholeheartedness, then when practice matures, it too will arise naturally.

The verse says:
Set aside intellect, dismiss brilliance,
contain light in wondrous sincerity.
Bei Yi’s words were not yet done—
Nie Que had already forgotten his form.
The Dao meets the mind pure as jade,
emotions empty, nature clear as ice.
The Great Void’s winds breathe softly,
heavenly music silent, without sound.

**Fifty-Third Passage**
The immortal elder of Nanhua said: "The Dao is not fulfilled by petty conduct; virtue is not perfected by petty knowledge. Petty knowledge harms virtue; petty conduct harms the Dao. Thus, it is said: rectify the self and nothing more. To be complete in joy is called attaining one’s will."

The ancients spoke of "attaining one’s will" not in terms of carriages and caps, but rather that nothing could augment their joy. Today’s "attaining one’s will" refers to carriages and caps. Yet when carriages and caps rest upon the body, they are not one’s nature and life—they are but transient lodgings of the external.

Disciples, the sage treasures and preserves the spirit, finding joy in the peace and harmony of nature and life. Thus, they are content in poverty and delight in the Dao, not taking carriages and caps as honor, lest they lose their pure and lofty aspirations. How much less should one, in straitened circumstances and following the vulgar, indulge in petty knowledge and petty conduct, becoming a burden to the Dao and virtue!

To lose the self in things, to forfeit one’s nature to custom—what is there to say of this? Be warned, be cautious.

The verse says:

Worldly affairs shift like clouds,
Heat and cold reverse in the turn of a hand.
The heart grows cold to fame and profit,
While the nature of Dao and virtue is like orchids and irises.
Those with purpose drift and wander,
Those without desire stand firm as Mount Tai.
Unfettered and unbound,
Great aspirations delight in leisurely ease.

**Fifty-Fourth Entry**
At the feast of repose in the Southern Florescence, Shu Guo Zijing asked: "Where does the Dao reside?"
The Perfected One said: "It is nowhere absent."
Shu Guo said: "Be specific, then you may proceed."
The Perfected One pointed to an ant before them: "It is in the ants."
Shu Guo said: "Why so lowly?"
"It is in the millet and barnyard grass."
"Why even lower?"
The Perfected One pointed to the bare ground: "It is in the tiles and rubble."
"Why still lower?"
"It is in the excrement and urine."
Shu Guo did not comprehend.

How clumsy! Our Most High has said: "The Dao in the world is like rivers and valleys to the great seas." And again: "The great Dao overflows—it may be found to the left or right." The Proclaimed Sage said: "That which is above form is called the Dao; that which is below form is called the vessel." From this, we may infer that the Old Immortal of the Southern Florescence borrowed the things before his eyes to reveal the original source of the Dao. Alas that Shu Guo had no grasp of it!

The Dao fully manifests in every thing, perfectly complete in every instance—this is its "nowhere absent." Like a single point of mine: wherever the eye falls, there is no limit. Where could one go and not find the Dao? Thus we know the Old Immortal’s first answer laid bare his heart and liver, while the four that followed were but secondary devices, born of necessity.

Disciples, if you can truly grasp the Perfected One’s first answer, you will stand towering and alone, unbound and unobstructed. Do you understand, venerable ones?

Ah! Today’s Chan masters—with their "cypress tree in the courtyard," "wine table in the hall," "three pounds of hemp," "three punches," "dry shit-stick," "Buddha-dung heap"—all their various cases derive from this. Thus Elder Feng the Venerable Master said: "Before Kumārajīva was born, there were already the *Nanhua* and the *Liezi*." Master Zhu Wengong said: "Chan arose from the Daoists; today’s patch-robed monks merely repackage and expound it." How could this not be so?

If you, gentlemen, can cut through doubt in an instant and fuse understanding to its depths, then the myriad dharmas will flow as one, and the Three Teachings will merge into unity. Why then contend over skill or superiority, over self and others, right and wrong? Rather, rejoice in great peace and become a transcendent great man—would this not be splendid?

The verse says:
The myriad things, three inches—one source of Dao,
Before a word is raised, it is already luminously clear.
The Southern Florescence’s intent fully reveals the wondrous,
While Dongguo’s doubts fail to penetrate the mystery.
Turbid qi clouds and deludes the original nature,
But a pure wind dispels the haze to reveal the primordial sky.
Six penetrations, four attainments—utterly unobstructed,
The Three Teachings gathered into one perfect circle.

**Fifty-Fifth Entry**
The Old Immortal of the Southern Florescence said: "Scholars of later ages are unfortunate: they no longer see the purity of heaven and earth, nor the great body of the ancients. The arts of the Dao will be torn asunder throughout the world."

Take the learning of Hui Shi, for example: he held that the myriad things are entirely the same and entirely different, that heaven and earth form a single body. The debaters of the world delighted in this. He spoke of eggs having fur, chickens having three feet, Ying possessing all under heaven, dogs being interchangeable with sheep, horses laying eggs, tadpoles having tails, fire being not hot, mountains having mouths, wheels not touching the ground, eyes not seeing, fingers not reaching, the unreachable never ceasing, tortoises being longer than snakes, the carpenter’s square not being square, the compass not making circles, the chisel not fitting the mortise, the shadow of a flying bird not moving, the speed of an arrow having moments of neither motion nor stillness, dogs not being dogs, a yellow horse and a black ox making three, a white dog and a black fox cub never having mothers, and a one-foot rod halved daily lasting ten thousand generations without end. Debaters used these to engage with Hui Shi, exhausting themselves without end.

Yet Hui Shi’s discourse, though he deemed it most worthy, merely adorned others’ minds, altered their intentions, and could win over their mouths—but not their hearts. He constantly sought to surpass others for fame, weak in virtue but strong in things, restless and unable to settle, chasing after things without return. He exhausted himself in echoes and forms, racing shadows in vain. How pitiful!

Disciples, the Old Immortal of the Southern Florescence specifically cited Hui Shi’s talent to conclude this chapter. His intent was to warn that people of later ages, light in qi and meager in fortune, would no longer embody the purity of heaven and earth or the great body of the sages. Instead, they would prize quick-wittedness and agility, answering long with short, east with west, being with non-being. When pressed and unable to reply, they would turn the question back on others. They teach the young to wield glib tongues, while gentlemen, slow of speech, struggle to respond. A single mind bent on victory, self-aggrandizing and self-important, they stir up the vulgar, deceive the foolish, spout grand words, and fancy themselves universal transformers. Gradually, this becomes a pernicious habit—how lamentable!

The *Book of Changes* says: "Sealed are the cheeks and tongue." And again: "Coming and going in distraction, friends follow your thoughts." This is precisely what it means.

Venerable ones, if you can see through such things, awaken and comprehend fully, you should inwardly cherish your light, treasure and nurture celestial harmony, and not emulate those who flaunt deceit and delusion. Instead, return to simplicity and restore purity—this alone suffices.

The verse says:
To learn the Dao and cultivate the mind, return to simplicity and purity,
Simplicity and purity need no further seeking.
Mouthing empty threefold mysteries, the tongue wags in vain,
While a hundred schemes at the eye’s edge misdirect the heart.
Mozi’s frugality and diligence are still worth adopting,
But Hui Shi’s cunning and deceit are truly hard to admonish.
The wondrousness of non-speaking speech is thoroughly penetrating,
Silent as an abyss, yet thunderous as a roaring great sound.

Pure Yang Emperor Lord states:
To awaken to the True Constant yet not comprehend destiny—
this is the foremost malady in cultivation.
To cultivate only the ancestral nature without refining the Elixir,
through ten thousand kalpas the yin spirit will struggle to attain sagehood.

Purple Yang Perfected states:
Though you may fully awaken to the True Suchness of nature,
you still must cast off the body only to re-enter the body.
How much better to refine the Great Medicine,
instantly transcending the leakless to become a true person.

Assembly, those who now expound on illuminating the mind and perceiving nature
all take raising brows, darting eyes, pointing fingers, extending fists,
knocking, shouting, speech, silence, and responses as the Way.
Able to study and comprehend thus,
they mistake this conscious spirit for the original true nature,
deeming it the true and proper.
Self-assured, they cease inquiry,
yet this one-sided affair remains unrealized—
how much further still from speaking of the True Empty Wisdom-Life,
the great matter of the final outcome!
Far indeed—deeply pitiable.

The Patriarchs’ two poems admonish and rouse the determined,
truly piercing to the quick.
Alas, our meager blessings and feeble strength
prevent us from advancing further.
Moreover, there are those who guard the kidneys, guard the navel,
guard the heart, guard the brain,
striving with effort to circulate and transport,
bending and stretching, contriving—
all manner of clinging to form and attachment to appearances
as the foundational work of destiny.
Pitiable indeed!

Now, what is the genuine truth?
Silently cease—silently cease.

A Chant says:
The great elephant’s trunk—freely flowing,
The primal lion’s eyes—bursting forth.
Two made one in seamless fusion,
A thousand harmonies, ten thousand unions—thundering, congealing.
Vague yet ceaseless, dense yet subtle,
Naturally merging with the Great Purity.
With resolve firm as mountains, attainment is certain—
Everlasting spring, supreme joy, the Unborn.

Fifty-Seventh Entry
In the *Zhouyi’s* *Appended Judgments*, the Sage Confucius speaks of exhausting principle and fulfilling nature to reach destiny. He also says: “The sage uses this to purify the heart, withdrawing and concealing it in secrecy.”

Good assembly, this place of secrecy is where the sage establishes life and finds refuge—it cannot be sought through knowledge or thought, nor perceived by the ears or eyes. Only when utmost sincerity purifies the heart until it is immaculately clean, radiantly bright, may one withdraw and conceal it here. Thus the sage takes the exhaustion of principle as the first step: when principle is exhausted, nature is fulfilled. Principle is the heart. When the heart is empty and luminous, nature is still and clear. At this stage of practice, clarity and stillness become profound, merging in an instant with the Great Void’s essence—this is how one reaches the True Empty Wisdom-Life, the great matter of the final outcome.

Do you wish to know it?
Do you wish to practice it?

Alas! A hymn says:
Nature finds no dwelling without life,
Life finds no master without nature.
When nature and life merge in perfect unity,
They naturally conceal themselves here.
True fire blazes through the Great Void,
Wisdom’s wind lightly dances.
In an instant, heaven and earth melt,
The Supreme Ultimate rounds itself thus.

Fifty-Eighth Passage
Zhou Lianxi and Master Yichuan said: “Reading the entire *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* is not equal to studying one *Gen* hexagram.”

Good assembly, can the *Gen* hexagram alone fully encompass the meaning of the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra*?
The assembly remained silent, their reverence deepening, and entreated elucidation.

The master said: *Gen* means “to halt.” The doubled *Gen* is *Gen* itself—halting again and again, halting at utmost goodness, resting in the Great Mean. Herein lies the consummation of the sage’s work. Thus the hexagram’s judgment states: “Halting at the back, one does not grasp the body. Walking in the courtyard, one does not see others—no blame.” The back stands opposite the heart. It does not say “halt the heart” but “halt the back,” for the heart has forgotten the self. When the heart forgets the self, naturally both self and others are forgotten, sounds and forms dissolve, and one enters the wondrous realm prior to heaven. What calamity of the world could then arise? Is this not simplicity and wonder?

The most sublime principles of the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* are no more than this. Its vast analogies: the four bodhisattvas correspond to the four images of the *Yi*, the eight vajras to the eight trigrams. The twelve lines of the *Fu* and *Gou* hexagrams mirror the solar terms of a year. The dragon girl becomes a boy at seven—there are six lines in a hexagram, and the seventh, *Bo* turning to *Kun*, transforms into *Fu* and *Zhen*. *Zhen* is the eldest son, the image of the yang dragon, hence the analogy of becoming a boy at seven. Purity without admixture is the image of *Qian*’s yang, hence the analogy of Sudhana the youth. The number fifty-five of heaven and earth—Sudhana’s fifty-three, plus two more—perfectly matches the number of pure yang in *Qian*. Thus the eighty-one fascicles are but the remnants of the sage’s teachings in the *Yi*. Therefore, Master Zhou’s claim that studying one *Gen* hexagram surpasses reading the entire *Avataṃsaka Sūtra*—how could this not be so?

Yet if one speaks of the great sage transcending beyond the bounds of heaven and earth, towering alone in the truth of the Infinite, this too may be called a remnant.

Good assembly, can you grasp this?

A hymn says:

"To halt and halt again—halt without halting,
One must seek beyond words and images.
*Gen*’s heart and *Gen*’s back merge into the Infinite,
Forgetting self and others, blending into the Great Harmony.

The Great *Yi* of Fuxi, primordial and formless,
The *Avataṃsaka*’s elder, embodying vast chaos.
All halting as one—utterly without method,
Mysterious yet again, empty yet not empty."

**Fifty-Ninth Passage**
*The Zhouyi’s* *Li* Hexagram, Third Line:
"At the sun’s decline, *Li*—
Not drumming the jar to sing,
But sighing in great old age—
Ominous."

This single line reveals the sage’s illumination of the wandering soul’s transformations, the discourse on life and death.
*Li* is radiant clarity.
When one’s prior brightness wanes, the next follows like the sun’s descent into earth.
This flickering of spirit—dim or bright—
Here, one abides in timely accord, drumming the jar to rejoice in heaven,
Thus brightness succeeds brightness, naturally and of itself.
Failing to grasp the principle of life and death,
Here, one flails in panic, qi muddled and heart bewildered,
Sighing without resolve—ominous indeed.

This ominousness is not the ominousness of worldly fortune.
This ominousness lies in a single misguided thought,
A rebirth in another form—
Who knows what creature it may become?
This ominousness cannot be spoken. Alas!

Good assembly, how does one comprehend this?
The assembly bows, entreating elucidation.

Good assembly, to comprehend this only at such a moment is already too late.
One must comprehend it here and now.

Thus, the fifth line of the *Li* Hexagram states:
"Taming the cow—
Smooth and penetrating."

People, driven by profit and fame, chasing emotions and things,
Relying on brightness to scrutinize, flaunting wit and boasting ability—
When do they ever turn inward to reflect on this flickering spirit?
The sage offers the metaphor of taming a cow.
To tame is to nurture and tend.
The cow is a docile beast; the female cow is gentle and yielding.
Now, turn inward to reflect on emptiness, containing light within—
Like herding a cow.
In all adversity and harmony, sounds and sights,
Make this your practice.
With time, it becomes familiar, yielding and tranquil,
The nature of habit and blood qi naturally fades,
The original true nature naturally purifies.
Here, dream and waking are like night and day in succession,
Life and death like winter and spring in rotation—
What ominousness remains?

The Chan school’s discourse on herding the ox derives from this.
Yet if we speak of the great sage’s wondrous union of form and spirit,
The mystery of neither life nor death—
This, too, is but a secondary mechanism.

Take heed, take heed.

A hymn says:

One grasps the stubborn ox by the fist,
A three-stranded hemp rope threads its nose.
Should it trample the crops, strike with the staff;
If stars scatter in the grass, lash with the whip.
Once untamed and stubborn, now docile and gentle—
The whip and tether forgotten, nothing remains,
Before the mountain, beneath the moon, it sleeps in deep snores.

**Sixty-Entry**
The *Zhouyi·Xici* states: *"The Changes have no fixed form; the spirit has no direction."*
It also says: *"The Changes are without thought, without action, utterly still and unmoving—yet responsive, they penetrate all."*
Thus we know: the formless form is the great form of the Changes;
The spiritless spirit is the supreme spirit of the Changes.
This supreme spirit and great form are the *Xiantian Yi* (Precelestial Changes).
The Sage taught people to be without thought, without action, utterly still and unmoving—
To embody non-thought is to still the heart;
To embody non-action is to still the nature.
Disciples, the master within this stillness and motionlessness
Is the wondrousness of the Precelestial, the truth of the Wuji.
If one can directly accept this with utter sincerity and silent penetration,
All principles will naturally become luminous, and the one nature will merge with the Great Void.
In ordinary circumstances, responding to conditions,
One transforms without moving, accomplishes without acting,
Arrives without traveling, is trusted without speaking—
Stillness abides, movement illumines, sincerity resonates and connects.
Thus the spirit transforms without limit, no hidden place is unillumined,
Heaven and earth cannot alter it, ghosts and spirits cannot fathom it.
The early Confucians said: *"You must believe the Changes existed before the trigrams."*
How true these words!
Alas! If you, sirs, realize this now,
The entire principle of the Changes lies within yourselves,
And all the sages and worthies stand in your shadow.
If not yet so, observe this circle—
The hymn says:

This circle, freely called "One,"
Returns to roundness, named the Supreme Ultimate.
Within unmoving movement, the mechanism of opening and closing unfolds—
The Three Powers and the myriad things return to our profound secrecy.
Where they return is the center within the center,
A vast expanse of Great Void, without trace.
To realize this is to be a person beyond Fuxi,
Beyond the heavens of the Precelestial, delighting in true ease.

**Sixty-First Entry**
When Chongyang Patriarch first arrived at the South Garden’s Yilao Pavilion in Ninghai, where Master Danyang and his friend Zhan the Warrior were drinking, they saw the Patriarch approach and asked: *"From where does the Master come?"*
He replied: *"From three thousand leagues away, I come especially to assist the drunk."*
Danyang had once composed a poem with these lines; upon hearing them, he felt an immediate resonance. He invited the Patriarch to sit, offered rites, and inquired further.
The Patriarch said: *"Where the Five Phases do not reach, before the one qi has arisen."*
Master Danyang rose in astonishment and bowed.
Fan Mingshu, standing nearby, remarked: *"These ten words are simple yet utterly profound. If the Master is not an immortal, how could he speak thus?"*
Disciples, with a single glance, the Patriarch pointed to the original face before birth—
A symbol of the most wondrous and subtle. How magnificent!
Beyond the bounds of yin and yang—this is where the Five Phases do not reach.
Returning to the prior state of nature and destiny—this is before parents were born.
Master Danyang, upon hearing this, awakened instantly and remained transcendent to the end.
Truly rare and extraordinary!
Master Ziyang said: *"The five qi return to the origin; the one true nature reverts to the root."*
This is the meaning of the above.
Disciples, if you can spiritually awaken and penetrate the heart, directly apprehend this,
And silently embody it in conduct—how wondrous!
If not yet so, listen carefully to my hymn.
The hymn says:

Spirit, soul, ethereal and corporeal souls, intent—
Harmonized and blended, they become one and round.
Body and heart still and unmoving,
In the subtle and indistinct, the form precedes the image.
Neither heart nor nature,
Neither Buddha nor immortal.
Shattering the Great Void,
Beyond the heavens of the Precelestial.

**Sixty-Second Entry**
Master Yuchan said: *"Before parents were born, there are endless living paths.
After body and heart are still, the true mechanism of the Wuji reappears."*
Profound indeed!
Originally, before birth, there was pure primordial qi,
Within which the supreme treasure resided.
The wondrousness of life’s generation was boundless and undifferentiated—
This is what is meant by endless living paths.
Since birth, the heart of the infant gradually changes,
The original true nature daily shifts.
The cloudy obstructions of discriminating nature,
The misty delusions of false thoughts—
All day, one drifts amid karmic conditions.
When will the original source be clarified?
Thus the Patriarch, in compassion, warns us with *"body and heart unmoving,"*
Abruptly reversing the flow to return to the source—
How urgent and earnest!
The *"body and heart"* here do not refer to the deluded fleshly heart
Or the illusory qi-blood body,
But to the original numinous wisdom, the formless Dharma-body.
When the Dharma-body is still, true tranquility is attained;
When numinous and wondrous, it is clear—this is the Jade Void.
Utterly empty and still, one recovers the great image before the beginning,
The supreme truth of the Wuji.
The body alone precedes the image, suddenly transcending the realm of things—
How simple and wondrous!
Disciples, do you wish to know this? To practice it?
The hymn says:

Before parents were born, a speck of the true,
Not empty emptiness, called the primordial spirit.
In the wondrous stillness of the center within the center,
Suddenly, the natural spring of the Wuji.

**Sixty-Third Entry**
The Three Mao Lords of Destiny’s Office wrote:
*"The numinous terrace, pure and bright as an ice-jade vessel,
Only permits the primordial spirit to dwell within.
If you add even one thing to it,
Your entire life will not be clear and void."*
Profound indeed!
Disciples, by this we may infer:
For those who cultivate the Way, the heart’s purity and simplicity are paramount—
Utterly genuine, utterly unadorned, without a single speck of defilement.
Only then can one become a person of the Clear and Quiet Dao.
Master Danyang said: *"If the heart is not free of wine, sex, wealth, and anger,
Even if you attain the wondrous and subtle, it is as if you had nothing."*
Thus Master Lian said: *"When the heart dies, the spirit lives;
When emotions are forgotten, the Dao naturally abides."*
Now observe our kind:
If the heart has not died and the two emotions are not forgotten,
It is essential to freeze the hearts of greed and delusion, anger and hatred, love and desire.
Once these three hearts are resolved,
All other hearts—pursuit of fame, profit, and the like—will naturally vanish.
If these three hearts are not resolved,
To escape the wheel of rebirth and suddenly transcend birth and death—
I dare not promise this.

May each of you devote yourselves with utmost sincerity—resolve swiftly, resolve swiftly—and together swim in the boundless realm of Nothingness, the wondrous and pristine precelestial realm of pure emptiness. I earnestly urge you to treasure this.

A verse says:
Cease, cease—let all delusions rest,
Humble, yielding—let hatred and anger melt like ice.
The root of desire and clinging love is most harmful;
Once resolved, one naturally transcends life and death.
To deplete spirit and qi, to waste primordial essence—
Never deceive yourself like one covering ears to steal a bell.
Do not fault this humble hut for its blunt words,
For it seeks only to blind your ears and deafen your eyes.

**Sixty-Fourth Passage**
The Primordial Celestial Worthy suspended a precious pearl, no larger than a millet grain, in the midst of the Empty Mystery, five *zhang* above the earth. The Primordial Worthy ascended and led the celestial perfected deities and the boundless host of sages into the pearl, and none knew where they had gone.

Disciples, how can this single pearl, so minute, contain the myriad perfected sages without a trace? If you can directly cast off the five desires, transcend the five phases, and penetrate this mystery, then the celestial pivot and jade balance will halt their turning, the four poles will shine with clarity, and the ten thousand dharmas will merge within. Naturally, you will leap beyond kalpas, return to the celestial root, rise above all ancestors, and embody only the Dao. You will wander freely in the Jade Capital upon the mountain, swimming in the Great Canopy of Jade Purity.

How splendid!

The *Golden Lotus Treasure Sutra* states: The Vast and Original Perfected One addressed the assembly, holding a golden lotus flower. Within it appeared a precious pearl, radiating a hundredfold radiance that pervaded the ten directions and all realms. It further says: Alas, sentient beings sink this golden lotus treasure pearl into the mire of defilement, willingly enduring the five turbidities and obscuring their own luminosity. If those with good roots awaken even a single thought of faith, they need only leap free from all dust and filth to naturally attain purity and radiance, illuminating the ten directions and three realms. All may delight in this—it is not mine alone.

From this, we infer that this single pearl is fully and perfectly present within each person’s body. Thus it is said: When expanded, it fills the six directions, vast and all-embracing; when gathered, it retreats into secrecy, unfathomable even to gods and spirits.

A verse says:
A world hidden within a grain of millet,
A Mount Sumeru contained in a mustard seed.
A single point of jade-like emptiness,
The warp and woof of the ten thousand dharmas.
Boundless, it holds all within,
Subtle and secret, beyond the faintest trace.
Within the formless, it is attained,
Its treasure-light resplendent in brilliance.

**The Three Ultimates of Entering the Chamber**
**First Ultimate Chapter**
The pure, empty, and wondrous true heart,
Unobscured, radiant through past and present.
The unadorned Daoist, when fully resolved,
Rests in peace, letting go, delighting in the rare sound.

I have often said: When the cinnabar terrace is without obscurity, essence and qi merge in harmony; when the numinous palace gathers dust, heart and spirit grow dim and scattered. Let me ask you: During your time here, have you ever reflected on the nature of your own blood and qi, the endowment of your constitution, the nature of your habitual defilements from the mundane world? Have they changed? Have the hearts of greed, anger, love, and desire; the hearts of profit, fame, and delusion; the hearts of talent, competitiveness, cleverness, and discernment—have they been relinquished? If not, then to truly master this authentic practice and wondrous subtlety, you must sever every trace without exception. Let go of the entire body, and the original numinous wondrousness will appear before you. Only then can you gather it back and retreat into secrecy.

This secret place, which the immortals and perfected ones call the "Spirit Valley," is elegantly named the "Mysterious Pass"—the place beyond yin and yang, before father and mother, where I establish my being and secure my destiny. If you can prevent the six desires from arising and extinguish the three hearts, abiding where joy, anger, sorrow, and delight have not yet emerged, in the serene emptiness of the center, then reverse your gaze inward through the celestial eye to perceive the formless. Let the breath of the nostrils settle into silence. From silent breathing to true breathing, from true breathing to settled breathing, the six pulses become profoundly still, and the one true [reality] appears in indistinct clarity.

Profoundly still, as if present,
Luminous, as if I alone exist,
Vast and empty, the Jade Void,
Pure and complete,
Perfectly bright, merging into the formless,
Naturally empty and white.
At this point, heaven and earth cannot alter its substance,
Sun and moon cannot dim its radiance,
Ghosts and spirits cannot peer into it,
Yin and yang cannot fathom it.
The entire body becomes a mouth,
Yet no word can be uttered.

This humble hut has spoken too much, revealing the celestial mechanism in its loftiness. If you can truly believe and put this into practice with diligence, when the water arrives, the channel will form naturally. Alas, no one can exert effort on your behalf—each must comprehend this for themselves. Treasure this, treasure this.

**Second Ultimate Chapter**
The first thought flows in harmony with form,
With the body, the nature and life take shape and the primordial is complete.
When the heart is at peace and serene, the pearl of nature shines;
When qi and breath merge in harmony, the treasure of life is numinous.

Nature and life—can one cling to just one side? Originally, before the primordial wisdom-life was awakened, the original nature had no master. If the Primordial remains in its natural state without cultivation, the wisdom-life has no place to abide. To achieve the wondrous fusion of nature and life, essence and spirit must merge in secrecy.

If you wish to clarify the original true nature, you must first still the heart;
To cultivate and refine the wisdom-life from its inception, you must truly nurture qi.
Stilling the heart lies in calming the intent and reversing the emotions;
Nurturing qi lies in settling the spirit and harmonizing the breath.

Master Yin said: Emotions are waves, the heart is a current, nature is water, and life is the source. At rest, they are one body; in motion, they are named differently. Pursuing this to its ultimate end, how much clarity is there?

Joy, anger, sorrow, delight, love, aversion, and desire—these are emotions, arising from the stirring of intent, like waves rising with the wind. Thoughts, reflections, and the root of intent—these are the heart, arising from encounters with things, like water flowing when stirred. Stillness, the empty body, clear and bright—this is nature, like a current returning to still water. The primordial qi, harmonious and dense, misty and suffused—this is life, like the vast ocean’s original source, pure and limpid.

If you can extinguish emotions within the heart, it is like the wind subsiding and waves settling.
If the heart is stilled and the original nature revealed, it is like the current returning to still water.
If nature merges with life, it is like still water returning to the source.

The Patriarch of Purple Yang said: When the wind subsides and waves settle, the pearl of the heart shines with clarity; when the green pond is pure and still, the moon of nature radiates in full splendor.

To perfect the authentic and awaken the heart to its root, to fulfill life and return to the origin—all excellence lies herein. Thus, penetrating the profound barriers, one suddenly transcends the upward path, clearly ascending to reality and attaining the realization of true emptiness. How could this compare to those who, like plank-bearers, see but one side, or to deluded Chan practitioners imprisoned in ghostly caverns?

Therefore, the *Yi Jing*’s "Striking" hexagram states: "Exhaust principle and fulfill nature, to reach life." The alchemical classics speak of melting into true nothingness, naturally giving rise to wondrous being—how profound! Though I, unworthy as I am, have lightly revealed the celestial mechanism and instantly forgotten my transgression, I now expound in greater detail, secretly pointing the way for the wise. If one meets this with sincere understanding, cultivates with diligence, and advances in practice, it is indeed heaven’s charge.

The *Heart Seal Scripture* says: "The three superior medicines—spirit, qi, and essence—are dimly discerned, subtly obscure." These three superior medicines are the original spirit, original qi, and original essence, neither existent nor empty, without sound or scent, faintly glimpsed yet profoundly hidden, without fixed form. The three are fundamentally one, a single body with three names.

Alas! From the moment of birth, the human heart gradually falls into darkness. Through the stirring of intent and emotions, the five essences transform. Spirit is like water, qi like wood, intent like fire, and thought like earth. When earth is stirred, it generates emotional metal; metal restrains wood, and spirit is disturbed by wood, so the original spirit becomes the discriminating spirit. Water restrains fire, and qi scatters through the nose, so the original qi becomes blood and breath. Earth restrains water, and essence follows desire, so the original essence becomes the essence of sensory union.

Thus, to follow circumstances is to be human; to reverse and halt is to be an immortal of the origin. Patriarch Yuchan said: "When the five phases flow in sequence, the dharma-realm is a fiery pit; when the five phases return in reverse, the great earth yields seven treasures." Master Zhayang said: "The four images and five phases all rely on earth." Intent, as earth, can restrain water and generate emotional metal; it can subdue emotional metal and control the essence-water.

He also said: "True earth restrains true lead; true lead restrains true mercury. Lead and mercury return to the earthen crucible, where body and heart remain still and unmoving." All of you—open your eyes, open your eyes! Calm body and heart, tame emotions and intent, and toward the sprouting of true yang, refine the original essence into original qi; still the original qi to merge with the original spirit; condense the original spirit to embody the great void. Thus, one transcends beyond the five phases, towering alone above the three realms. All such metaphors and analogies are but forced names.

Now, for all you great virtuous ones, I have flung wide the eyes beyond heaven, unblocked the nostrils before form, and united the Primordial Celestial Worthy with the Numinous Treasure Celestial Worthy, perfectly merging upon the Terrace of Fragrant Mist. Lofty and rare, this sound has never been heard—like the Lord of Images before heaven.

Ah! The heart-seal of the mysterious origin, the mysterious pass of the Dao’s transmission, the true mechanism of the upward path, the elixir-treasure of celestial immortals—all is now pure and luminous.

Someone asks: When water is damp, fire is parched, metal flows, and earth crumbles, where then are nature and life?

I shout: Troops follow the seal’s command; generals obey the order. With one swing of the wisdom-sword, the demonic armies’ courage shatters! Though it is said that peace is established by the general, it is not the general who first brings peace.

Take care, take care.

**Ultimate Principle, Chapter Three**

Pure and unadulterated, serene and untroubled—
penetrating the myriad ages as one, threading the hundred kings to reach the mean.
Its essence is wondrous before heaven; its function shines like the bright sun.
This is the heart-method of the Most High.

It enables the aspirant to extinguish the human heart and illumine the Dao-heart,
to sever worldly desires and perfect heavenly principle,
to empty the mind and still the nature, to settle qi and congeal the true,
to forge the wisdom-life as unyielding gold, to polish the Dao-heart as lustrous jade,
to transcend into the mysterious pass and attain the profound mystery of the boundless.

Thus the patriarchs transmitted mind with mind,
employing words to expound the Dao,
valuing the fullness of virtue and power, the dual flourishing of nature and life,
embodying the wondrous emptiness of the Jade Void,
and directly ascending to the supreme—
this is called the Perfected Person of the Highest Immortals.
To seek elsewhere is but heterodoxy and external paths.

The perfected ones of old—
their conduct was tranquil, their breath deep,
their sleep without slumber, their waking without care.
They knew not delight in life nor aversion to death.
Thus, living yet not possessing, they rejoiced in the heaven of non-birth;
dying yet not forgotten, they understood the realm of non-death.
Untransformed, they transformed—naturally, spontaneously.

Now, our contemporaries fixate on life and death as the great matter,
clinging to partial views of causes and conditions,
embracing anxieties and attachments—
truly, empty-headed afflictions.
Thus, Perfected Master Yin said:
"Those who recklessly dispute life and death,
ever-shifting in their emotions and perceptions,
are called demons, not followers of the Dao."

O assembly! If you can truly comprehend this,
abide in the round and enter the chamber,
harmonizing and blending with ease,
neither affirming nor denying—
Ah! The wondrous and eternal true,
the settling of primordial qi,
the spirit without limit,
the embodiment of precelestial reality.
In the twelve double-hours,
amid sound and form, being and non-being,
movement and stillness, speech and silence,
attain great freedom,
unhindered and at ease—
true joy without end, boundless felicity.

If the work is truly here,
my many words are of no use.
None but the most refined, single-minded, and utterly sincere in the world
can partake of this.

Take care, take care.
