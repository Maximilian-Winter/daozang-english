### *Zhouyi Cantong Qi*, Fascicle One
**Commentary by Chu Huagu**

**Qian and Kun** are the gates and doors of the *Changes*, the father and mother of all hexagrams.
**Kan and Li** form their frame and axle, turning the wheel upon its true axis.

The *Changes* is the union of Qian and Kun, their ebb and flow, opening and closing—hence the term "gates and doors."
Through their interweaving, the sixty-four hexagrams arise—hence the term "father and mother."
Kan is concealed within Kun, Li within Qian—hence the term "frame."
Kan and Li dwell at the center of Qian and Kun; the movement of their central lines is like an axle turning the wheel.

The four hexagrams of the female and male serve as the bolt and key.
They cover and enshroud the Dao of yin and yang, just as a charioteer holds the reins and bit, follows the plumb line and inked cord, traces the wheel tracks, and governs the exterior from the center.
Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li are the female and male of creation; the central lines of the myriad beings manifest the subtle workings of Qian and Kun—hence the phrase: "governing the exterior from the center."
The above discusses the medicinal substances.

Numbers are recorded in the pitch-pipes and calendars; the lunar phases consist of five and six.
The warp and weft obey the sun’s command.
Combined, they make sixty; hardness and softness have their outer and inner.
At dawn on the new moon, *Zhun* (Hexagram 3) presides over affairs; by dusk, *Meng* (Hexagram 4) receives its turn.
Day and night each govern one hexagram, employed in due sequence.
From *Ji Ji* (Hexagram 63) to *Wei Ji* (Hexagram 64), until the end of the month’s twilight, the cycle concludes and begins anew.
The lunar phases consist of five and six, totaling thirty days; two hexagrams govern each day, corresponding to the sixty hexagrams.
Two hexagrams comprise twelve lines: six yang lines and six yin lines.
Aligning the twelve hours with the twelve pitches of the pitch-pipes, the twelve months of the calendar, and the twelve years of the cycle.
Beginning with *Zhun* and *Meng* and ending with *Ji Ji* and *Wei Ji*, the sequence revolves without end.
This chapter discusses the firing times in terms of a single month.

The celestial stems serve as the measure; movement and stillness have their early and late.
Spring and summer rely on the inner body, from *Zi* (midnight) to *Chen* and *Si* (morning).
Autumn and winter employ the outer function, from *Wu* (noon) to *Xu* and *Hai* (evening).
Rewards and punishments correspond to spring and autumn; darkness and light follow cold and heat.
The line statements embody benevolence and righteousness, expressing joy and anger in accord with the seasons.
Thus aligned with the four seasons, the Five Phases attain their proper order.
The twelve hours correspond to the twelve monthly qi; from *Zi* to *Chen* and *Si*, and from *Wu* to *Xu* and *Hai*, the solstices of yin and yang are determined.
Rewards and punishments correspond to spring and autumn; the line statements embody benevolence and righteousness, establishing the equinoxes of punishment and virtue.
This chapter discusses the firing times in terms of a single day.

Heaven and Earth establish their positions, and the *Changes* operates within them.
Heaven and Earth are Qian and Kun.
"Establish their positions" refers to arranging the positions of yin and yang in harmony.
The *Changes* refers to Kan and Li.
Kan and Li are the two functions of Qian and Kun.
The two functions have no fixed line positions; they circulate through the six voids.
Their comings and goings are unfixed; their ascent and descent lack constancy.
Obscure and hidden, they sink and rise within.
They envelop the myriad things, serving as the guiding principles of the Dao.
The sun and moon constitute the *Changes*—hence the phrase, "the *Changes* refers to Kan and Li."
The central lines of Kan and Li are the subtle workings of Qian and Kun, advancing and retreating, ascending and descending among the six lines.
Thus, the transformations of the central lines serve as the guiding principles of the Dao.
Kan and Li alone receive the central qi of Qian and Kun; humans are born receiving the center of Heaven and Earth.
This chapter discusses the essence of Kan and Li in terms of their central lines.

The formless governs the formed; the utility of vessels lies in their emptiness.
Thus, in tracing waxing and waning, Kan and Li vanish.
Vessels are useful because of their emptiness; thus, the void of Li can receive the fullness of Kan.
The void of Li is the formless; the fullness of Kan is the formed.
The yin line at the center of Li transforms into the central stroke of Kan, becoming pure Qian and losing the forms of Kan and Li—hence the phrase, "Kan and Li vanish."
This all demonstrates the subtle workings of the central lines, clarifying the meaning of "the *Changes* operates within them."
This chapter discusses the functions of Kan and Li in terms of their intercourse.

Words are not idly crafted; theories do not arise in vain.
They draw upon evidence and manifest effects, verifying the numinous through measurement.
Extending categories and structuring characters, the principles are proven.
Kan is the essence of the moon, *wu* (earth); Li is the light of the sun, *ji* (earth).
The sun and moon constitute the *Changes*, hardness and softness in balance.
Earth flourishes in the four seasons, weaving the beginning and end.
Green, red, white, and black each reside in their respective directions.
All receive their mandate from the central palace, the work of *wu* and *ji*.
Kan and Li can thus unite the sun and moon; their harmony arises because Kan contains *wu* and Li contains *ji*.
*Wu* and *ji* are the center.
This also clarifies the ascent and descent within the center, governing the exterior from the center, and the meaning of "the *Changes* operates within them."
This chapter further discusses the essence of the medicinal substances.

The *Changes* is imagery.
No image is more luminous than the sun and moon.
Exhausting the numinous to know transformation: when yang departs, yin arrives.
Like spokes converging at the hub, the wheel turns; going out and coming in, they roll and unfold.
When the time arrives at dawn on the new moon, *Zhen* (Hexagram 51) comes to receive the tally.
At this moment, Heaven and Earth conceive their essence; the sun and moon mutually embrace.
The male yang scatters its dark essence; the female yin transforms the yellow womb.
Chaos intermingles and joins; the root and foundation are planted.
They nurture and cultivate the budding sprout, concentrating spirit to form the body.
All things tread forth from this; none among the teeming creatures do not arise from it.
Observing the image of the sun and moon conjoined as one, one grasps the Dao of Kan and Li’s intercourse.
Observing the hexagram *Zhen* coming to receive the tally, one perceives the mechanism of the solitary yang’s return.
Kan, the male, is the male yang, concealing the lines of Qian within; it bestows its celestial dark qi upon Li.
Li, the female, is the female yin, transforming its central line into the yellow body of Kun to become Qian.
This chapter discusses the firing process and the union of impurities.

Thus, when Confucius extolled the primordial vastness, the virtue of Qian and Kun pervaded the void. He traced antiquity to the Primordial Sovereign, and in the *Guan Ju* established the beginning. The qi of cap and marriage intertwined, and in the first year the sprout burgeoned.

Sun and moon conjoin as jade disks—this is the celestial and terrestrial intermingling of essence. Humans and the myriad things all arise from the celestial and terrestrial intermingling of essence. In the *Book of Changes*, Confucius elucidated the Dao of male and female essence-conception and the transformation of the myriad things; in the *Book of Songs*, he ordered the primacy of human relations, beginning with husband and wife, to clarify the principle of yin and yang seeking one another. This chapter speaks of the medicinal substances.

The sage is not born in vain; he observes above to discern the celestial tally. The celestial tally has advance and retreat, bending and extending to accord with the seasons. Observing the Dao of Heaven and grasping the movements of Heaven, he clarifies how the firing times of the *Yi* hexagrams align with the celestial tally’s advance and retreat. The next chapter will discuss this in detail.

Thus, the *Book of Changes* embodies the mind of Heaven, and the hexagram *Fu* establishes the first sprouting. The eldest son inherits the father’s body, and through the mother founds the omen and foundation. The waxing and waning respond to the pitch-pipes’ ascent and descent, anchored in the pivot of the Dipper. On the third day, it emerges from clarity, *Zhen* receiving *geng* in the west. On the eighth day, *Dui* receives *ding*, the first quarter level as a taut cord. On the fifteenth, the Qian body is complete, fullness reaching *jia* in the east. The toad recedes and the hare’s spirit, sun and moon’s qi doubly bright. The toad’s eye marks the hexagram’s node; the hare spews forth its radiance. *Fu* reveals the mind of Heaven—this is the winter solstice, where nothing is more secret than the solitary yang. From this solitary yang follow six yins and six yangs, waxing and waning in alternation, responding to the twelve pitch-pipes; stretching and contracting, ascending and descending, they accord with the Dipper’s pivot and rotation. Kun’s initial line transforms into *Zhen*, thus it is said to rely on the mother. This explanation derives from Fuxi’s primordial hexagrams. This chapter discusses the timing of the yang fire.

When the seventh and eighth lines are exhausted, they bend and descend low. On the sixteenth, the mandate shifts, *Xun* and *xin* appear in level brightness. *Gen* stands straight in the south at *bing*; the last quarter is the twenty-third. On the thirtieth day, *Kun* and *yi* in the northeast lose their companions. When the nodal limit is reached, they mutually succeed one another, and the succeeding body once more generates the dragon. This chapter discusses the timing of the yin tally.

*Ren* and *gui* pair with *jia* and *yi*, Qian and Kun encompassing beginning and end. Seven and eight sum to fifteen; nine and six likewise correspond. These four combine to make thirty, and the yang qi seeks extinction and concealment. The eight trigrams array the luminaries, their movements never straying from the center. *Ren* and *jia* pair with Qian; *yi* and *gui* pair with Kun. Seven, eight, nine, and six are the completion numbers of the Five Phases in the *Luoshu*, each yielding fifteen, corresponding to the fifteen days when three yang lines belong to Qian and the fifteen days when three yin lines belong to Kun, together forming thirty days. The sun and moon meet once, ending and then beginning anew. "The eight trigrams array the luminaries, their movements never straying from the center" means the eight directions array the twenty-eight lodges, the Dipper revolves at the center of Heaven, and the division of the fire tally’s yin and yang must not be violated. The "center" refers to the two solstices. This chapter discusses the *na jia* firing times.

The subtle essence of the Dao is too minute to observe; one infers and measures it by tallying evidence. Abiding, one observes its images, approximating its forms. Setting up gnomons as standards, one determines auspice or inauspice by divining the omens. Issuing commands in accord with the seasons, one must not miss the moment when the lines move. Above, one examines the patterns of the *Hetu*; below, one orders the flows of earthly forms. In the middle, one investigates human sentiments, unifying and considering the Three Powers. In movement, one follows the hexagram’s nodes; in stillness, one relies on the *Xiang*’s words. Qian and Kun put their use into practice, and only then is the world governed. How could one not be cautious?

The Dao of Heaven is profound and distant, difficult to glimpse; one perceives it through the images of the *Yi*. Erecting gnomons to divine the omens is simply to avoid missing the moment when the lines move. Speaking of the single yang’s timing, one must not lose the moment of its activation, consuming its season—only then can Kan and Li unite in gestation, forming the pure body of Qian. The Northern Dipper’s pivot governs transformation, advancing and retreating, extending and contracting—this is the luminous manifestation of Heaven’s Dao in images. The tides respond to the moon, waxing and waning in concert—this is the evident display of Earth’s Dao in flowing forms. This is called "closing the passes," when merchants and travelers cease their journeys, and human sentiments align with the seasons and accord with Heaven. In movement and stillness alike, one follows the Dao of the *Yi*, all to illuminate the subtlety of not missing the moment when the lines move.

This chapter broadly discusses the *yin fu* and *yang huo*; the next chapter focuses solely on the timing of the single yang. The inception of governance lies in the initial stirring of yang at *zi*, the moment when Kan and Li unite in gestation. "Controlling the subtle and minute" means closing the passes and halting travel, the sovereign ceasing to inspect the realm, sealing the gates and shutting the doors, so as not to harm the growth of tender yang. Naturally, the yang of *zi* advances to form *Tai*, following the Dipper’s handle to determine dawn and dusk—thus it is called "the guiding cord of transformation," referring to the Dipper.

This chapter discusses the single yang; the next chapter will address the method of advancing the fire.

When the lines stir within, fortune or misfortune arises without. The five planets move in harmony or discord, responding to the seasons and stirring in resonance. When the four and seven fall into disorder, they deviate in elevation and depression. The *Wenchang* oversees the records, while the *Taifu* are held accountable. The hundred officials and their bureaus each govern their respective domains. The fire’s timing and the lines’ movements operate within, while numinous transformations and celestial images manifest without. If one acts too early or too late, the five planets move erratically, disrupting the order of the twenty-eight lodges.

This chapter describes the consequences of losing the proper fire timing in this way.

It is said: "Harmonize the essence of the Five Phases; the moon receives the regulation of the six pitches. Five times six make thirty degrees, and when the degrees are complete, they begin anew." From beginning to end, one traces the threads of survival and demise. Within a single day, *Zhen* and *Xun* alternate in succession, cycling endlessly.

This chapter describes the proper adherence to the fire timing in this way.

If the ruler is arrogant and indulgent, a single moment of fullness may violate the Dao. If a minister is deceitful and sycophantic, his conduct will not follow the proper path.

The waxing and waning of the crescent and full moon bring misfortune through discordant changes. Those who enforce the law with criticism and reproach bring blame upon their lord by exposing faults. When hardness and softness lose their proper Way, and movement and stillness miss their proper timing—this chapter describes how improper union in gestation leads to such consequences.

When the pole star receives its correct alignment, it moves with ease and entrusts matters to those below. The Hall of Light enacts governance, and the state suffers no harmful ways. Within, one nurtures the self through tranquil emptiness and non-being. The primordial root draws forth clarity, illuminating the inner form and body. Seal the opening of *dui*, and fortify the numinous root. The Three Luminaries sink into obscurity, warming and nourishing the child-pearl. Though unseen to the eye, it is near and easily sought. The yellow center gradually permeates the principles, and moisture reaches the skin. Begin with rectitude, and end with cultivation; when the trunk stands firm, the branches may be grasped. By not losing the proper timing, one governs through non-action, and naturally the Three Luminaries sink into obscurity. What is within manifests without, thus moisture reaches the skin.

From the erratic and orderly movements of the five planets onward, all illustrate how the inner stirring of hexagram images gives rise to fortune and misfortune externally. This chapter describes how proper union in gestation leads to such outcomes.

The first is concealment—none in the world know of it. The highest virtue acts through non-action, not seeking through scrutiny. The lesser virtue acts, and its function never ceases. When the upper is sealed, it is called "having"; when the lower is sealed, it is called "not having." The "not having" serves the "having," where the divine virtue resides above. These two apertures follow a method: metal and water also depend on each other. Know the white, guard the black, and the numinous clarity will come of itself. The white is the essence of metal; the black is the foundation of water. Water is the pivot of the Dao, and its number is called "one." It is the beginning of yin and yang, containing the yellow sprout within the mysterious. It is the master of the five metals, the river chariot of the north. Thus lead is black without but holds golden radiance within. Cloaked in coarse cloth yet bearing jade, outwardly a madman. Metal is the mother of water; the mother conceals the child’s embryo. Water is the child of metal; the child shelters within the mother’s womb. The perfected person is most subtle—seeming to exist, yet not; now sinking, now floating, like a great abyss. Withdrawing, they disperse and guard their respective domains.

The number of water is one, concealing the yang within metal—this is the silver within black lead, a truth rarely known, for one is the supreme virtue of Kan. Kan is the supreme virtue, the realm of "having"; Li is the lesser virtue, the realm of "non-being." Li employs contraction and receptivity, existing ceaselessly like a continuous thread, thus its function never ceases, for it serves the supreme. Li-mercury requires yang-metal to transform, just as metal requires Li-fire to bestow its essence; hence they are said to be mutually dependent. Knowing that gold resides within water, guard the water and the gold will come of itself, for the mother conceals the child’s embryo. The number of water is one, and its color is black; thus it is called "guarding the black," for the meaning of "illuminating the one" lies in concealment. This chapter speaks of the method and measure for seeking the medicine.

Beheld, it resembles whiteness; refined, it becomes vermilion. When tempered, it forms the protective exterior, with purity dwelling within the white. Round or square, a mere inch in diameter, they merge and constrain one another. Born before heaven and earth, majestic and revered. Surrounding it are walls and gates, resembling Penglai’s isles. Encircled and sealed, its four paths are intricately arranged. Guarded with utmost secrecy, its gates bar all wickedness. Curved pavilions connect, ever vigilant against the unforeseen. Here, thought may cease, and sorrow finds no place. The numinous black fills the chamber, none can detain it. Those who guard it prosper; those who lose it perish. In movement and stillness, rest and activity, it ever accompanies the adept. This chapter speaks of the sacred embryo’s formation, emphasizing its nurturance and protection.

This is not the method of the hidden viscera; inner vision must have its focus. Treading the steps of the Dipper’s lodges, the six Jia follow the days and hours. The yin path suppresses nine with one, its turbid chaos disturbing the mysterious womb. Ingesting the black, the intestines rumble; exhaling the upright, inhaling external evil. Day and night without repose, the bowels never cease their murmuring. The body grows weary, the spirit dazed, as if in stupor. The hundred vessels boil and surge, unable to attain serene clarity. Circling, one erects altars and halls, offering morning and evening sacrifices. Ghostly forms appear, dreams stir with emotion. The heart rejoices, the mind delights, believing longevity assured. Yet suddenly, life is cut short, the body left to rot and decay. Every action runs counter, perverse and contrary to the pivot of the Dao. The methods are myriad, thousands upon tens of thousands. Advancing and retreating, they defy the Yellow and the Old, twisting and turning against the Nine Capitals.

The meaning of these words is plain and easily understood; no annotations are provided, and this shall serve as the standard hereafter. The wise will grasp their intent, suddenly perceiving the path’s origin. Practice diligently, day and night without rest. After three years of ingestion, one becomes light and roams afar. Entering fire, they are not scorched; entering water, they are not drenched. They can manifest or vanish at will, ever joyful and free from care. When the Dao is perfected and virtue accomplished, they remain concealed in the dust of the world. Then the Great One summons them, relocating them to the Central Isles. When merit is complete, they ascend, receiving the register and the chart. This chapter speaks of the attainment of the Dao.

The *Fire Record* is not written in vain; it expounds the *Yi* to clarify these truths. The crescent moon method employs the crucible and furnace, with the White Tiger as the pivot of refinement. Mercury is called the flowing pearl, accompanied by the Azure Dragon. Raising the east to meet the west, the hun and po naturally constrain one another. The upper crescent is Dui, numbered eight; the lower crescent is the same. When the essences of both crescents unite, the body of Qian and Kun is formed. Two eights correspond to one catty; the Dao of the *Yi* stands firm and unshaken. Metal and water dwell together, thus Kan’s moon and the White Tiger serve as the pivot of refinement. Wood and fire share the same position, thus the flowing pearl is accompanied by the Azure Dragon. Raising the east to meet the west means Li receiving Kan, returning to the pure body of Qian. From the new moon, eight days bring the upper crescent; from the full moon, eight days bring the lower crescent. Thus it is said that two eights correspond to one catty, the sign for the medicine. This chapter discusses the medicine in terms of the four images.

When metal enters fierce fire, its color does not fade nor its luster diminish. Since the beginning of creation, the sun and moon have never lost their brightness, nor has metal forfeited its weight; the sun and moon retain their usual forms. Metal is born from the moon, receiving the sun’s mandate at the new moon. Metal returns to its mother, and at the moon’s wane, they envelop one another. Concealing its frame, it sinks into the profound void. When metal regains its original nature, its majestic radiance illuminates the crucible. The gold within Kan is the medicine of true yang; refined in Li’s fire, it remains indestructible through the ages. This is likened to the moon’s metal essence receiving the fire of the great yang, its brilliance enduring as ever. The preceding chapter broadly discusses the four images; this chapter focuses solely on metal as the true medicine.

The numbers of zi and wu combine to make three; wu and ji are called five. When three and five harmonize, the eight minerals form the essential framework. Breathing nurtures their union, awaiting the surge that makes them husband and wife. Yellow earth is the father of metal; the flowing pearl is the mother of water. Water’s ghost is earth, which subdues water’s uprising. The Vermilion Bird is the essence of fire, maintaining balance to determine victory or defeat. If water prevails, fire is extinguished, and both perish, returning to the fertile earth. When the three natures unite, their original nature shares a common ancestor. Zi-water is one, wu-fire is two, wu-ji is five, combining to form the eight minerals. Kan and Li, husband and wife, possess the image of breathing and nurturing union. The three natures of metal, water, and fire return

When ice and snow meet warm broth, they dissolve into the Great Mystery.
Gold takes cinnabar as its master, harmonizing with mercury.
Transformation arises from their authenticity; beginning and end follow one another.
To become an immortal through ingestion, one must use substances of the same kind.
Plant millet with millet; hatch a chicken with its own egg.
Supporting nature with its kind, things form as easily as clay is shaped.
Can fish eyes be pearls? Can fleabane become a casket?
Like follows like; discordant matters cannot yield treasure.
Thus, swallows and sparrows do not birth phoenixes; foxes and hares do not nurse horses.
Water does not flow upward in flames; fire does not moisten downward in motion.

The world abounds with scholars, lofty and gifted with fine talent.
Yet, by chance, they fail to meet their destined path, wasting fire and squandering wealth.
Clinging to texts and following words, they recklessly impose their own interpretations.
Threads unravel without cause; measures and standards lose their grasp.
They smelt chalcanthite, mica, and alum-magnetite,
burn sulfur with camphorwood, and refine mercury with mud.
They smelt the five-stone bronze beneath the bellows, taking it as their pivot.
Yet, with natures of different kinds, how could they willingly unite in one body?
A thousand attempts lead to ten thousand failures; what they seek to transmute turns to folly.
From youth to white-haired age, doubt arises midway.
Turning from the Dao, they cling to delusion; stepping from the right path, they enter crooked trails.
Peering through a tube, their vision is narrow—how can they gauge what lies ahead?

Human nature possesses it: within separation, true yin is not true yang, and cannot transform.
How could disparate kinds merge with metal and stone? These are all external things.
As for the utmost sages, none surpass Fu Xi, who drew the Eight Trigrams and the Map of the Young Heavens.
King Wen, ancestor of emperors, structured the body and expounded the line texts.
Confucius, the near-sage hero, composed the *Ten Wings* to aid them.
These three lords were raised by Heaven, rising in succession to govern their times.
Though their excellence followed steps, their merits and virtues did not differ.
Their creations built upon one another, weighing and measuring with care.
The tangible is easy to estimate; the formless is hard to plan.
Their deeds set models for emulation, establishing classics for the world.
Without innate foresight, they awakened through their teachers.
Bright as one who parts the curtains and ascends the high terrace,
the *Fire Records* of six hundred chapters share the same aim.
Though the texts speak with solemnity, the world does not ponder deeply.
Tracing the source and flow, the hidden and manifest originally dwell together.

I humbly speak for the worthy—how dare I treat these writings lightly?
Holding my tongue, I wish to remain silent, yet cutting off the Dao invites punishment.
Pouring my thoughts onto bamboo and silk, I fear leaking Heaven’s tally.
Hesitant, I sigh, gazing up and down, stitching together this foolishness.

Refinement has its methods and standards; I cannot bear to lay them all bare.
I briefly outline the essentials; the branches and twigs will be seen in due course.

The three sages—Fuxi, King Wen, and Confucius—reveal that this Dao emerges from the *Yi*’s images, the *Hetu* (River Chart), and the *Luoshu* (Luo Writing). Zhen aligns with the eight, Xun with the three, Li with the seven, Kan with the one and six, Qian in reverse with the four, Dui in reverse with the four, Kun and Gen with one forward and one reverse, together forming the imperial fifteen. Master Wei declared that Heaven bestowed the *Hetu* upon Fuxi, who then arranged it according to the numbers of the *Luoshu*, giving rise to the precelestial eight trigrams. When the precelestial trigrams are overlaid upon the *Hetu*, the medicinal substances and fire phases become brilliantly apparent. This is how the sages perceived the Dao and grasped the mechanism of creation and transformation.

When Qian unites with Li, it is called the yang crucible, with Li dwelling in Qian. When Kun unites with Kan, it is called the yin tripod, with Kan dwelling in Kun. When Zhen meets Li, the dragon emerges from within the fire. When Dui meets Kan, the tiger is born from within the water. These two entities embody the principle of the child producing the mother. As for the moon’s phases—waning in Zhen and waxing in Qian, waning in Xun and setting in Kun—this further reveals the subtleties of the fire phases at the solstices and equinoxes.

The Way of Heaven is vast; only the images of the *Yi* suffice to illuminate it. The Dao of the *Yi* is profound; only the sages suffice to expound it. This Dao was inaugurated by the three lords of antiquity and later elucidated by Master Wei—truly, it arises from the *Hetu*.

Use metal as the embankment, and water enters with ease. The number of metal is fifteen, and the number of water is the same. When tending the furnace to set the weights, let water exceed by five parts. These two are deemed authentic: let the metal’s weight return to its origin. The third does not enter, but fire accompanies it as two. The three substances contain and receive one another, their transformations appearing divine.

Beneath lies the great yang’s darkness, awaiting its moment in silence. First it liquefies, then congeals—this is called the Yellow Chariot. As the years and months draw to a close, nature is undone, and lifespan is harmed. The body becomes ash and dust, resembling the dust on a bright window. When metal and water dwell together, raising the metal draws the water in. Metal is nine, water is six—together they make fifteen. Of these fifteen parts, water claims six, leaving five parts in excess. Metal and water are the true medicine, hence they are called "the two deemed authentic." The nature of wood relies on the essence of metal to form the medicine; the child is concealed within the mother’s womb, so water follows metal inward. Fire is ignited below, and transformation arises. Water, metal, and fire—these three substances are rooted in nature. Wood is governed by metal, metal is drawn by water, and metal is refined by fire. Wood has no role here, so it is said that "the third does not enter," referring to these three.

Yang reaches its extreme and thus liquefies first; yin arises and thus congeals later. It is called the Yellow Chariot because "heaven is dark, earth is yellow," and Kun is earth, the great chariot. At this stage of refinement, yang reaches its limit and yin is born, as Qian gradually transforms into Kun. When the Kun’s way is exhausted, the dragon battles in the dark and yellow, and the body becomes ash and dust—this is the first true manifestation. This passage speaks of yang reaching its limit and yin arising.

Combine and harmonize the refining and blending, then hasten into the gate of crimson. Securely seal their juncture, ensuring it is complete and firm. Let the blazing fire rise from below, its roar ceaseless day and night. Begin with the civil to make it workable, and end with the martial to display it. Observe and tend with utmost care, scrutinizing the adjustments of cold and warmth. Circulate through the twelve nodes, and when each node is complete, examine it closely again. When qi is depleted and life nears its end, cease the work lest the hun and po perish. The color shifts to purple, and suddenly the elixir of return is formed. Grind it into a single pellet, and the spatula’s touch is most divine.

The four images unite to seal Dui and close the gate—thoughtless and effortless—to secure the juncture. As yin is stripped away and yang is born, Kun transforms into Qian. Qian is the great crimson, hence it is said to hasten into the gate of crimson. "Begin with the civil to make it workable" refers to refining the elixir and advancing the fire. Fire cannot be rushed; first, use the civil fire to temper it, ensuring hardness and softness do not resist each other. Once it is workable, advance the fire—this is the initial gentle warmth. At first, ignite the fire to conceive it, called "wild battle." In the middle, nurture it with civil fire, called "irrigation." In the end, use fierce fire to complete it, called "boiling and simmering"—this describes the stages of advancing the fire.

The color shifts to purple, and suddenly the elixir of return is formed. Purple represents Qian, the image of great crimson, the six in the third of *Yi* (Increase), and the top line of Zhen. In the end, it becomes firm. Firmness is Qian, as Zhen transforms into *Qian*.

The *Yi*’s line statement reads: "Inform the duke with a jade tablet." *Yi* (Increase), being pure Qian, thus bears the image of the tablet. Qian is metal, is jade, hence it is called the "knife-jade." Kan and Li unite through the two earths of Wu and Ji to form the body of Qian, which is why the character for "tablet" (*gui*) is composed of two earths. When the fire-phase is complete, Kun transforms into Qian, passing through the Three Palaces to rest the dead *po* and *hun*—this is the second true image.

This chapter speaks of yin at its extreme giving rise to yang, expounding the numbers of the Five Phases with concision and without excess. It takes water to stimulate fire, suddenly extinguishing radiance. The sun and moon press upon each other, ever lingering between darkness and new moon. When water flourishes, Kan encroaches upon yang; when fire wanes, Li’s day grows dim. Yin and yang devour each other, their mutual arousal the natural Way.

This discussion follows the previous chapter’s depiction of the body as ashes and dust, its vital force nearly severed—like the sun and moon pressing upon each other, obscuring their radiance, for Kan-water overcomes Li-fire. Names are given to settle essence; words are chosen to express nature. When metal returns to the origin of nature, it may be called the Elixir of Return. I dare not speak emptily, but emulate the sages’ writings. Ancient records speak of Dragon and Tiger; the Yellow Emperor praised Golden Flower. Huainan refined Autumn Stone; Wang Yang added Yellow Sprout. The worthy can uphold and practice this; the unworthy must not partake. The Way of past and present is one; in conversation, we disclose our plans. Scholars, exert yourselves further, and ponder deeply. The essential words are utterly plain, shining clearly without deceiving me.

Metal’s essence, being utmost yang, returns to water’s nature of utmost yin—this is what is meant by "returning to its root," and thus serving it. Essence is rooted in nature; when nature reverts to its root, it is called the Elixir of Return. This aligns with the middle section’s principle of harmonizing essence with nature. This chapter describes the congealing of the Elixir of Return.

*The Cantong Qi*, Scroll Two
Commentary by Chu Huagu

The firmness of Qian and the softness of Kun unite and embrace.
Yang bestows, yin receives—male and female depend on each other.
Through this, creation unfolds, and essence and qi expand.
Kan and Li crown the head, their radiance spreading forth.
Mysterious and profound, beyond depiction,
The sage measures and orders the foundational mysteries.
The four merge into chaos, entering directly into emptiness.
The sixty hexagrams cycle, woven into a chariot’s frame.
Dragon and horse are harnessed—an enlightened ruler guides the times.
Harmony follows, the path smooth and true.
Deviant ways are perilous, toppling nations and homes.

Qian and Kun, male and female—these are the medicinal substances.
"Yang bestows, yin receives" means Kan governs bestowal, imparting its yang to Li;
Li governs reception, needing yang from Kan—this is what is meant by "uniting and embracing."
"Through this, creation unfolds, and essence and qi expand" means that knowing the way of Kan and Li’s union,
one must also employ the six yang of creation as the fire-timing to enable the dissemination of essence.
"Kan and Li crown the head" means the head is the Dao, and the medicine is the primordial qi.
Primordial qi is the first flourishing of the three mysteries of the primordial beginning—hence it is called "profound darkness" and "mysterious foundation."
"Entering directly into emptiness" means the four images converge, precisely to fulfill the emptiness of Li’s palace.

Following the sixty hexagrams’ fire-timing through the celestial cycle,
if one does not lose the proper moment, there will be harmony without peril.
"Dragon and horse are harnessed" means Zhen is the dragon, Qian the horse—
from the first yang to the sixth yang, the time for firing arrives.

From "Kan and Li crown the head" to "ordering the mysterious foundation" speaks of the medicinal substances.
"The four merge into chaos, entering directly into emptiness" refers to their intercourse.
From "The sixty hexagrams cycle" onward speaks of the fire-timing.

Scholars advancing the fire are like enlightened rulers guiding the times,
thus the analogy of emperors, kings, sovereigns, and lords.
Revering the celestial Dao, assisting yin and yang,
they align the three luminaries to bring great peace.
In grand application, emperors employ it; in personal cultivation, scholars do.
The noble one abides in his chamber; if his words are virtuous,
they resonate a thousand *li* away.
This refers to the lord of ten thousand chariots, dwelling in the nine-fold chamber,
issuing decrees in accord with yin and yang’s rhythms.
Store the vessel, await the time—do not transgress the hexagrams’ months.

*Zhun* uses *zi* and *shen*; *Meng* employs *yin* and *xu*.
The remaining sixty hexagrams each have their own days.
I briefly present the two images, though I cannot exhaust their details.
Establish righteousness, enact punishments—apply benevolence, bestow virtue.
Those who oppose it meet misfortune; those who follow it meet fortune.
Follow the calendar’s decrees, be sincere and focused.
Carefully observe the days and hours, scrutinize the waxing and waning.
In broad terms of lunar phases, the winter solstice is the hexagram *Fu*;
in detailed terms of qi-timing, the winter solstice is *Zhong Fu*.
The hexagram’s line statements begin here—its meaning is profound.

*Wu wu wu geng geng geng*
*Zi xu shen chen yin zi*
For *Zhun*, the first line *gengzi* marks the winter solstice’s first yang;
the sixth line *wuxu* marks the vernal equinox’s bathing.

*Bing bing bing wu wu wu*
*Yin zi xu wu chen yin*
For *Meng*, the first line *wuyin* marks the summer solstice’s first yin;
the sixth line *bingxu* marks the autumnal equinox’s bathing.

The above uses two hexagrams as examples to fix the two solstices and two equinoxes.
Thus the following text states: "The two solstices alter their measures, deviating and twisting;
the two equinoxes align horizontally and vertically, not erring by a moment’s leak."
With *Zhun* and *Meng*, the two solstices and two equinoxes are determined,
and the subtleties of yang fire and yin tally are fully realized.
The slightest misalignment brings regret and harm.
"The two solstices alter their measures, deviating and twisting."

In the depths of winter, scorching heat arises; in the height of summer, frost and snow descend.
The two equinoxes align horizontally and vertically, not erring by a moment’s leak.
When wind and rain fail to follow their seasons, floods and droughts contend;
locusts surge like boiling water, mountains collapse and the earth splits.
Heaven displays its portents, strange omens proliferate.
The filial son’s devoted heart moves the August Ultimate.
Near at hand, it arises from one’s own speech; far off, it flows into distant lands.
Some bring calamity, some bring fortune;
some usher in great peace, some incite war and strife.
These four outcomes arise from the heart’s intentions.

The two solstices divide the phases of yang fire and yin tally;
the two equinoxes fix the mechanisms of generation, destruction, and bathing.
The slightest deviation—where yang encroaches or yin oversteps—gives rise to regret and harm.
When rulers fail to model themselves on Heaven and Earth, aligning with yin and yang, disasters and anomalies emerge.
Whether refining the self or governing the world, the principle is one and the same.

This passage speaks of the consequences when the patterns of the two hexagrams are not followed.
Movement and stillness have their constancy; one adheres to the plumb line.
The four seasons proceed in due order, harmonizing with qi.
Hard and soft are decisively distinguished, never trespassing upon one another.
The Five Phases guard their boundaries, neither recklessly expanding nor contracting.
The *Changes* circulate in ceaseless flow, bending and stretching, reversing and returning.
The two solstices and two equinoxes stand sharply distinct, never encroaching upon one another;
movement and stillness do not miss their appointed times.
Anticipating Heaven, Heaven does not oppose; following Heaven, one accords with its seasons.

This passage speaks of the consequences when the patterns of the two hexagrams are followed.
Between the dark of the moon and its first crescent, tally marks align at the center.
In primordial chaos, the undifferentiated, the female and male follow one another.
Essences moisten and nourish, transformations flow and circulate.
The numinous spirits of Heaven and Earth cannot be measured.
Employ them to secure the self, conceal the form and hide away.

It begins in the northeast, the region of *Ji* and *Dou*.
Turning rightward, it spews forth the wheel and spits out the sprout.
Hidden depths reveal their images, scattering and emitting radiant essence.

The following chapter discusses the precelestial trigrams in relation to the monthly waxing and waning of the firing times, so this chapter first traces the moon’s generation of brightness. From the union of the sun and moon, their mutual embrace and support, the hidden form nurtures the *po*-soul in the dark of the moon and its first crescent, then gradually brightens from the northeast. Above *Xu* and *Bi*, *Zhen* emerges as the omen. Yang *qi* initiates its inception, the first nine as the "hidden dragon." Yang is established in threes, yin flows through eights. Thus, on the third day, *Zhen* stirs; on the eighth day, *Dui* moves. The second nine appears as the dragon, harmonious and luminous. When the virtues of three and five are perfected, the body of *Qian* is complete. The third nine watches in evening vigilance, the divine tally waning and fracturing. Flourishing and decline gradually transform, ultimately returning to their origin. Such is the firing time of yang.

*Xun* inherits its lineage, seizing the opportunity to maintain control. The fourth nine leaps or retreats, the Way perilous in advance or withdrawal. *Gen* governs progression and cessation, unable to be polished or removed. On the twenty-third day, one guards the appointed time of the crescent moon. The fifth nine soars as the dragon, the celestial position bringing joy. The sixth five, *Kun* in submission, binds and concludes the beginning and end. It nurtures the multitude of offspring, becoming the mother of all kinds. The yang numbers are exhausted, and upon exhaustion, they arise anew. Following nature and uniting with essence, they turn and join together. The ninth yang, the "exalted dragon," wages virtue in the wilds. Employing the nine, they flutter and become the compass and square of the Dao. Such is the firing time of the yin tally.

Following the pivot of the celestial sphere, ascending and descending, rising and falling, the six lines circulate in revolution—difficult to perceive. Thus, they have no fixed position, forming the ancestral foundation of the *Yi*. This discusses the firing times of the preceding chapter, aligning the six lines of the *Yi* trigrams with the revolving pivot’s ascent and descent. Therefore, having no fixed position reveals that the movement of a single yang line is not confined to the winter solstice, midnight, or the dawn of the new moon—it merely borrows these to illustrate brightness.

The dawn of the new moon is *Fu*, where yang *qi* first flows. Entering and exiting without haste, it establishes the marker of subtle firmness. When the Yellow Bell tunes to *Zi*, omens flourish and manifest. Spreading warmth and softness, the common people thrive in constancy. The *Lin* furnace applies its branches, opening the path of true radiance. The light gradually advances, the days lengthening. The Great Regulator of *Chou* adjusts the balance of high and low. Gazing upward, it completes *Tai*, where firm and yielding descend together. Yin and yang intertwine, the small departing and the great arriving. The spokes converge at *Yin*, moving in accord with the seasons. Progressing through *Da Zhuang*, it commands the gate of *Mao*. Elm pods fall, returning to their root. Punishment and virtue alternate, day and night begin to divide. In *Guai*, yin retreats while yang ascends. Washing and cleansing feathers and wings, it shakes off the dust of slumber. *Qian*’s vigor shines brightly, broadly covering the four neighbors. Yang culminates at *Si*, where the *Zhong Lü* interact. *Shen* begins its lineage, treading frost first. The cold spring at the well’s bottom, *Wu* as the guest of *Luo*. The guest submits to yin, yin becomes the host. *Zhu* departs from its position, gathering its essence. Cherishing virtue and awaiting the time, it rests in obscurity. *Pi* blocks and does not flow, what sprouts cannot grow. Yin extends while yang is slandered, yang’s name erased. *Guan* measures its authority, examining the conditions of mid-autumn. Nurturing the young and tender, the old and withered revive. Shepherd’s purse and wheat sprout, emerging beneath the cover. *Bo* rots the limbs, dissolving its form. When the transforming *qi* is exhausted, the utmost spirit is lost. When the Dao is exhausted, it returns to the origin of *Kun*. Constantly following earth’s principles, it receives Heaven and spreads its decrees.

The twelve months’ firing times, in their cyclical revelation, elucidate the meanings of the *Zhun* and *Meng* trigrams. The *Na Jia* diagram generates brightness in the northeast at the *Yin* position. Thus, speaking of the new moon’s first day, *Fu* arises at dawn, making it clear that the single yang is not confined to the *Zi* month or *Zi* hour. The preceding chapters all discuss firing times.

The profound and distant mysteries interconnect across barriers. Responding to measures and nurturing seeds, they are the origin of yin and yang. Vast and indistinct, none know their beginning. Those who lose the path first become followers; those who grasp it later become rulers. No level ground remains without slope—such is the Dao’s nature. Change and transformation alternate in盛衰, waxing and waning mutually dependent. Ending with *Kun* and beginning with *Fu*, it follows like a linked ring. Emperors and kings who inherit and govern, abiding by this principle, endure for a thousand generations. Yin and yang revolve and cycle, mutually rooting one another. Emperors and kings who grasp this Dao and receive Heaven to govern all things thus endure for millennia, expanding its application.

The emperor’s body serves as the master of the three ultimates, rectifying the five affairs to harmonize Heaven and Earth, following yin and yang to wield the handle of life and death. Thus, they enjoy long reigns, the people at peace and the state prosperous, the royal ultimate established to receive the five blessings. The Yellow Emperor ascended by this principle, embodying both essence and function. Otherwise, arrogance and excess lead to fullness, the royal ultimate unestablished. Flood and drought contend, the moon’s phases wax and wane, winter heat and summer snow—none may attain longevity.

From the Son of Heaven to the common people, those who grasp this prosper; those who lose it perish. Thus, the following chapter discusses the scholar’s application, while this chapter addresses the emperor’s use.

To nurture one’s nature, extend life, and delay the appointed time, one must deliberate on what follows and consider what precedes. The body one receives is fundamentally empty. Primordial essence spreads like clouds, relying on *qi* to establish its beginning. Yin and yang serve as measures, the dwelling of *hun* and *po*. The yang spirit is the sun’s *hun*, the yin spirit the moon’s *po*. *Hun* and *po* mutually serve as dwellings. Nature resides within, establishing boundaries and banks. Emotion operates externally, constructing walls and outer fortifications. When the city walls are complete, people and things find peace. At this time, emotion harmonizes with *Qian* and *Kun*. *Qian* moves directly, *qi* spreading and essence flowing. *Kun* is still and receptive, serving as the Dao’s dwelling. The firm advances and retreats, the yielding transforms and nourishes. Nine returns, seven reverses, eight returns, six resides.

The man is white, the woman red—metal and fire restrain each other.
Thus water settles fire, the inception of the Five Phases.
Supreme goodness resembles water, pure and without flaw.
The Dao’s form and image—True Unity is hard to depict.
Transforming and dispersing, each dwells in solitude.
Before a person is born, only True Unity exists.
From nothing to being, transformation flourishes to form the body,
which shelters *hun* and *po* to take residence.

The sun’s *hun* is fundamentally yang spirit; the moon’s *po* is fundamentally yin spirit.
The Chamber’s sun-hare reverses within the moon;
the Net’s moon-crow reverses within the sun.
The middle lines of *Kan* and *Li* are likewise—each serves as the other’s dwelling.
Nature is *hun*; emotion is *po*.
When nature gains emotion as its guardian, it does not lose its origin.

The *Kan* man obtains the *Qian* line, moving to bestow essence;
the *Li* woman obtains the *Kun* line, empty and receptive.
Naturally, nine fires and seven metals return to the origin and revert to the root;
eight woods and six waters return to the source and reside in the spring.
This is the Four Images discussed through the Luo River’s completed numbers.
Metal is white, fire red—hence the sun’s red and white.
Metal is the true yang within *Kan* man; fire is the true yin within *Li* woman—
these are the two functions of metal and fire.
Above speaks of the Four Images—seven, eight, nine, and six—
while below mentions only metal, water, and fire,
which shares the same meaning as the mutual containment of the Three Substances.

The Four Images unite as one body—this is True Unity,
whose image cannot be bathed or described.
When dispersed, the Five Phases each attain one direction’s flourishing.

This chapter speaks of the scholar’s practice.
It is like a chicken’s egg, black and white supporting each other.
A single inch in length and breadth serves as the beginning.
The four limbs and five viscera, sinews and bones, are thus complete.
After ten months pass, it emerges from its womb.
Its bones are weak enough to bend; its flesh is smooth as lead.

This discusses the previous chapter’s Daoist form and image.
A yang burning-mirror gathers fire—without the sun, it does not produce light.
A *fangzhu* vessel does not rely on stars or moon—
how could it obtain water or broth?
The two *qi* are profound and distant, yet their transformations still communicate.
How much more so for what is near and stored within the body,
intimately present in the heart and chest?

Yin and yang pair with the sun and moon; water and fire serve as their effects.
Using objects to interact with the sun and moon,
one can still obtain water and fire.
How much more so for a person possessing true yin and true yang,
who models the sun and moon to conceive *Kan* and *Li*—what difficulty could there be?

The three treasures of ear, eye, and mouth—
firmly seal them, do not let them open or communicate.
The Perfected One lurks in the deep abyss,
floating and roaming while guarding the compass’s center.
Turning and curving to survey, opening and closing all harmonize.
They serve as the axle and linchpin for oneself—
movement and stillness never exhaust.

*Li*’s *qi* internally defends; *Kan* does not employ hearing.
*Dui* unites without speech, few words follow the Primordial Vastness.
Once these three are secured as key mechanisms,
relax the body and dwell in an empty chamber.
Entrust your will to emptiness and nothingness,
taking absence of thought as the constant.
Proof is difficult to shift—focus the mind without distraction.
In sleep, spirit embraces spirit; upon waking, observe presence and absence.
The complexion gradually moistens,
the bones and joints grow ever stronger.
Expelling the host of yin demons,
only then is true yang established.

If cultivation never ceases,
then dark clouds will disperse like rain.
Drizzling like spring’s moisture,
trickling like melting ice.
From the head it flows down to the feet,
ultimately ascending again.
Coming and going, it penetrates the boundless,
permeating the body’s interior.
Reversion is the Dao’s verification; weakness is virtue’s handle.
Weed out long-standing filth,
and the subtle is harmoniously regulated.
The turbid is the path to clarity;
prolonged darkness leads to illumination.

Once the sacred embryo is formed, it is tightly sealed and firmly closed.
Guard it with non-action, hold it without obscurity—
naturally, these functions arise:
from darkness to light, from turbidity to clarity,
from the *Kun* body gradually transforming into pure *Qian*.

The previous chapter spoke of the sacred embryo’s image;
this chapter speaks of the method of nurturing it.

Worldly people favor petty safeguards,
not examining the Dao’s depth or shallowness.
They abandon the correct path to follow deviant trails,
seeking speed but finding the gate blocked.
Like the blind refusing a staff,
or the deaf listening to palace music.
They cast nets in water to catch pheasants and hares,
or climb mountains to seek fish and dragons.
They plant wheat hoping to harvest millet,
or use a compass to seek a square.
Exhausting their strength and laboring their spirit,
throughout the year they see no success.

If you wish to know the method of ingesting and refining:
the affair is simple and not burdensome.
Its meaning is clear and requires no further explanation.

The sun’s flowing pearl constantly seeks to leave.
Suddenly obtaining golden radiance, it turns and relies upon it.
Transforming into white liquid, it congeals into utmost hardness.
The golden radiance first initiates—
after a brief moment, it dissolves and transforms into water,
like horse’s teeth arranged in rows.
Yang then goes to harmonize—nature and emotion naturally unite.
Pressing upon the timely yin,
it is restrained and confined within the gate.
The compassionate mother nurtures; the filial son repays kindness.
The stern father issues commands; the strict teacher instructs descendants.
The Five Phases vie for supremacy, relying on each other to generate.

Fire’s nature melts metal; metal chops down wood’s flourishing.
The Three, Five, and One—these are heaven and earth’s utmost essences.
They can be transmitted orally but are difficult to convey in writing.

The flowing pearl is the mercury within *Li*—
its nature is to blaze upward and flee.
Yang metal then carries water to restrain it,
wondrously uniting and congealing.
The golden radiance first initiates—
after a brief moment, it transforms into water:
once metal and fire unite, fire can melt metal into water,
hence the later statement that fire’s nature melts metal.

“Yang then goes to harmonize—nature and emotion naturally unite”
means that yang’s emotion and yin’s nature find their kindred,
naturally blending so that *qi* returns to the original sea.
The leak is eternally sealed—thus it is said to press upon the timely yin.
Fire does not blaze upward; all thoughts vanish, cutting off the ghostly path—
hence it is said to be restrained and confined within the gate.

Yang metal restrains wood to prevent it from generating fire;
if fire arises and disaster erupts, it will surely be overcome—
hence the later statement that metal chops down wood’s flourishing.

*Li* obtains the *Kun* line as the mother’s way,
residing in the south to govern summer, taking nurturance as its duty—
thus it is called the compassionate mother nurturing.
*Kan* obtains the *Qian* line as the father’s way,
residing in the north to govern winter, taking severity as its essence,
using harm as kindness—thus it is called the stern father.

The annotation on "Three Fives and One" follows below.

This chapter speaks of the creative transformations of *Kan* and *Li* in union.
The *zi* hour turns rightward, while *wu* revolves eastward.
*Mao* and *you* stand as boundaries, establishing the two names.
The dragon calls to the tiger; the tiger inhales the dragon’s essence.
Both feed upon each other, each coveting the other’s glory.
Thus they swallow and chew, devouring one another.
When *Yinghuo* guards the west and *Taibai* traverses the heavens,
wherever the killing *qi* descends, what can stand unshaken?
The foxhound guards the rat; the crow and sparrow fear the goshawk.
Each has its function—how dare they make a sound?

*Zi* turns rightward to align with *you*; *wu* revolves eastward to align with *mao*.
When *you* occupies the *wu* position, it is precisely the short-day *Mao* star,
marking the mid-winter moment of the first yang.
At this time, union may be achieved.
The two names refer to the dragon and tiger.
Their mutual swallowing and merging form the image of union.
At first, they covet each other; in the midst, they contend;
in the end, they devour—progressing from shallow to deep,
naturally uniting as one, *Kan* and *Li* in conjugal harmony.

When *Yinghuo* guards the west and *Taibai* traverses the heavens,
*wu* aligns with *you*, and the great fire descends upon *wu*—
precisely the long-day *Huo* star, marking the mid-summer moment of the first yin.
Yin governs the withering and killing; all things retreat and withdraw.
At this time, the yin tally stills the fire.
The adept understands the mechanism of *zi* and *wu*—one yin, one yang—
commanding the metal tiger to restrain the wood dragon,
preventing it from taking flight, like the dog guarding the rat,
like the crow fearing the hawk—each fulfilling its function.

This chapter reveals the subtle principle of yang fire and yin tally.
Without grasping its truth, one speaks in vain,
exhausting family wealth, leaving wife and children hungry and poor.
From ancient times to now, countless have pursued this path,
yet few have met with success, and rarer still are those who achieve it.
Seeking famous medicines far and wide only strays from the Dao.
If one truly encounters it and perceives its beginnings,
comparing like to like and measuring things from start to finish,
then the Way may be attained.

The Five Phases restrain one another, each in turn becoming father and mother.
The mother contains the nourishing fluid, the father governs bestowal and endowment.
Essence congeals and form flows—metal and stone do not decay.
With careful focus and no leakage, one may attain the Way of completion.
Erect a pole and see its shadow; call into the valley and hear its echo—
how can this not be numinous? It is the supreme image of Heaven and Earth.

Yet if one takes a mere inch of *yege* or a single ounce of *badou*,
swallowing brings instant collapse, leaving one unable to turn or lift.
At such a moment, even if King Wen were casting milfoil stalks,
Confucius interpreting omens, Bian Que wielding his needles,
or Wu Xian beating his drum—
how could they revive the fallen or restore them to swift movement?

The Five Phases restraining one another means:
when metal encounters water, metal weakens;
when wood encounters fire, wood is overcome.
"Each in turn becoming father and mother" refers to:
wood originally giving birth to fire, and fire then gestating wood;
metal originally giving birth to water, and water then nurturing metal.

The mother contains the nourishing fluid, the father governs bestowal and endowment—
this shows yang endowing and yin receiving.
The Maiden by the River is numinous and most divine.
When she obtains fire, she takes flight, leaving no trace of dust.
Ghosts conceal themselves, dragons hide—none know where they abide.
Should one wish to restrain her, the Yellow Sprout becomes the root.

*Li* is the Maiden, positioned in the *wu* wilds,
belonging to the Zhou division of the Three Rivers—hence "Maiden by the River."
Is the naming and fixing of images done carelessly?
When the fire of *Li* is born, calamity arises and restraint is broken—
this illustrates how human nature, when stirred,
if not aligned with the proper, scatters and loses its original truth,
so that "entering and exiting, none know its direction."
Like mercury within cinnabar—when exposed to fire, it flees without a trace.

Whether drawing near from the body or far from things,
the principle is one and the same.
This aligns with the chapter on "The Flowing Pearl of Great Yang."
The Flowing Pearl is the Maiden, the fire within *Li*.
The Yellow Sprout is Golden Flower, the metal within *Kan*.

This chapter speaks of medicinal substances.
Things devoid of yin and yang defy Heaven and contravene the Origin.
A hen hatching alone—her chicks will not be whole.
Why is this so?
The union was not complete; the Three and Five did not merge;
hard and soft remained apart.
The essence of transformation is the natural process of Heaven and Earth—
like fire rising when stirred, like water flowing downward to moisten.
It is not some mastered method that compels this, only to change it later.

Observe the mating of male and female in their union—
hard and soft intertwine, inseparable.
When the proper timing aligns, it is not through craft or artifice that they are governed.
When a boy is born, he lies prone; when a girl is born, she lies supine—
endowed in the womb, receiving qi from the primal beginning.
This is not merely visible at birth;
even in death, they replicate it.
It is not that parents teach them to do so—
the pattern was set at the moment of union, determined from the very start.

To say that solitary yin cannot complete, or solitary yang cannot complete,
is also natural.
The union of *Kan* and *Li* likewise arises naturally,
not through human effort forcing it to be so.
*Kan* as the male is the moon; *Li* as the female is the sun.
The sun bestows virtue; the moon unfurls its light.
The moon receives the sun’s transformation, its body unharmed.
If yang loses its bond, yin encroaches upon its brightness.
At the dark and new moons, they press close, enveloping one another.
Yang’s form diminishes; yin’s encroachment brings calamity.

Male and female depend on one another, inhaling and exhaling to nourish.
Male and female unite in congress, seeking their kind.
Metal transforms into water, water’s nature circulating freely.
Fire transforms into earth, blocking water’s flow.
Thus the male moves and bestows outwardly; the female is still and stores within.
If overflowing exceeds the proper measure, she becomes constrained.
The *po* restrains the *hun*, preventing excess and extravagance.
Neither cold nor hot, advancing and retreating in timely accord—
each attains harmony, both emitting confirming signs.

With the sun and moon, male and female, yin and yang—
the image of their union is made clear.
Losing their bond results in obscuration and eclipse.
"Metal transforms into water, water’s nature circulating freely" means:
water born within metal seeks to overcome the fire of *Li*,
but the fire of *Li* generates earth, which in turn overcomes water,
causing water to submit and remain still.

"Male moves and bestows outwardly; female is still and stores within"—
this shares the same meaning as yang endowing and yin receiving.
"The *po* restrains the *hun*"—emotion guards nature, metal restrains wood.
"Not permitting excess and extravagance"—nature is not transformed by emotion.
"Neither cold nor hot, advancing and retreating in timely accord"—
not losing the solar terms of yin and yang’s division,
advancing fire and ceasing tally all align with proper measure,
thus each emits confirming signs.

Cinnabar, the essence of wood, unites with metal to merge.
Where metal and water combine, wood and fire become companions.
The four intermingle in chaos, arrayed as dragon and tiger.
The dragon’s yang number is odd; the tiger’s yin number is even.
The liver, green, is the father; the lungs, white, are the mother.
The kidneys, black, are the child; the spleen, yellow, is the ancestor.
Three things form one household, all returning to *wu* and *ji*.

The four images unite and return to *wu* and *ji*—see previous notes.
The above all discuss union.
Hard and soft alternate in ascent, traversing the divisions in turn.
The dragon in the west, the tiger in the east—
establishing the weft at *mao* and *you*.
Punishment and virtue converge, meeting in joy.
Punishment governs submission and killing; virtue governs generation and ascent.

In the second month, the elm withers as *yin* approaches *mao*.
In the eighth month, wheat sprouts as Heaven’s *yang* occupies *you*.
North at *zi*, south at *wu*—each serves as the other’s guiding principle.
The numbers nine and one cycle endlessly, beginning anew.
Embracing the primal in *xu* and *wei*, scattering essence at *zi*.
When yang grows, yin diminishes; when yin diminishes, yang grows—
hard and soft alternate in ascent.
The twenty-eight constellations govern the twelve earthly branches,
traversing the twelve celestial divisions—this is "traversing the divisions in turn."

The dragon’s position is east yet faces west; the tiger’s position is west yet faces east—
*mao* and *you* intersect, hence "the dragon in the west, the tiger in the east."
The *Dragon-Tiger Classic* states: "North and south form the warp,"
thus we know *mao* and *you* form the weft—hence "establishing the weft at *mao* and *you*."
*Mao* is virtue, governing generation;
*you* is punishment, governing killing.
*Mao* and *you* intersect—within generation lies killing, within killing lies generation.
Thus in the second month, the elm falls as *xin* in *xu* approaches *yi*...

In the eighth month, wheat sprouts—*chen* holds *yi* as *xin* approaches *xin*.

Since *mao* now resides in *you*,
naturally *zi* lies in the south and *wu* in the north—
hence "the south of *zi*, the north of *wu*," each serving as the other’s guiding principle.
This is what the *Dragon-Tiger Classic* calls "Wings Spread, Flying Void-Danger."

Only Master Zhang Ziyang deeply grasped this meaning,
thus his poem on the fifteenth night of the eighth month,
playing beneath the toad’s radiance—
precisely when the metal essence stands in full vigor.

Moreover, the fifteenth of the eighth month marks mid-autumn,
when the midnight star *Xu* governs the season’s center.
At the hour when *Xu* and *Wei* lodge in the sky,
they align with the position of *Zhang*’s stars—
*zi* south and *wu* north,
the dragon west and the tiger east,
punishment and virtue converging,
heaven and earth overturned,
metal and water brimming,
the elixir body in pure yang.

The numbers nine and one complete and begin anew:
*Kan*’s one joins *Li*’s nine,
then nine returns to join one,
each ending where the other begins.

Following this, "containing primal *Xu-Wei*, sowing essence in *zi*"—
the *wu* fire receives conception in *zi*,
for *wu* is placed upon *zi*,
hence "containing primal *Xu-Wei*."
The *Kan* water scatters the pure essence of the central line into *Li*,
as *zi* is placed upon *wu*—
hence "sowing essence in *zi*."

This passage speaks of the elixir body in pure yang.

*Guan guan* cry the ospreys,
on the river’s isle.
Lovely and refined the maiden—
the noble man’s fine match.

The male does not dwell alone,
nor does the female reside in solitude.
The Dark Warrior—tortoise and serpent—
coil and intertwine in mutual support.
Thus it is made clear: yin and yang,
in the end, must depend on one another.

Were two women to share a chamber,
their beauty as sisters,
though Su Qin were to mediate,
Zhang Yi to broker the match,
their eloquence sharp as blades,
their words sweet and persuasive,
their hearts laid bare in perfect harmony,
urging them to wed—
yet with hair grown brittle and teeth decayed,
they would never truly know one another.

If the ingredients are not of the same kind,
their names and categories disparate,
their measures mismatched,
their principles lost—
though the Yellow Emperor himself tend the furnace,
the Great One descend to his seat,
the Eight Lords invoke and refine,
Huainan grasp the flame,
pavilions raised and altars exalted,
steps and terraces of jade,
unicorn jerky and phoenix cured meat offered,
registers held in long obeisance,
prayers and petitions to the gods,
pleas to the mournful dead,
bathing and fasting in purification,
all in hope of some result—
it would be no different than mending a cauldron with glue,
or smearing a wound with bronze,
adding ice to frost,
or curing heat with boiling water.
Flying turtles and dancing serpents
would only appear more perverse.

This speaks of yin relying on yang,
reiterating the opening meaning of *Guan Ju*:
the union of male and female.

*Thus concludes the middle scroll of the* Zhouyi Cantong Qi. *(The character* 喻 *was originally* 论*, emended here according to the sense of the text.)*

Here follows the translation:

Only the sages and worthies of old
embraced the mysterious and held fast to the true.
They ingested and refined the Nine Cauldrons, concealed in reclusion,
contained essence and nurtured spirit,
communed with virtue through the Three Origins.
Essence and fluid converged in the textures,
sinews and bones grew firm.
All perverse influences were dispelled,
and the upright qi endured ever after.
Through long and patient accumulation,
they transformed their forms and ascended as immortals.

Moved by compassion for later generations,
those who loved the Dao,
they followed the winds of influence,
traced and sketched the ancient texts,
composed them into illustrated works,
and revealed them to posterity.
Yet they exposed only the branches,
concealing the root.
They entrusted them to various stones,
veiled them beneath layers of texts.
Scholars who obtained them
hoarded them in secrecy all their lives.
Sons inherited their fathers’ work,
grandsons followed their ancestors’ path.
Transmitted through generations in confusion,
none ever gained true insight.
Thus officials failed in their careers,
farmers neglected their plowing,
merchants abandoned their goods,
and men of resolve fell into poverty.

I grieve deeply for this,
and so set down these writings in order.
The words are concise and easy to ponder,
the matters few and free of clutter.
I lay out their principles in sequence,
substantial and verifiable to behold.
Weights and measures are precise,
each following in due succession.

Thus I compose these disordered verses,
opening the gates through their apertures.
Let the wise examine and reflect,
and weigh them with their own understanding.

The Nine Cauldrons are cauldrons of metal.
In the *Luoshu*, nine is the completed number of metal,
and nine is the yang number of Qian-metal.
The cauldron is the chamber of metal.

This chapter first speaks of the medicine.
No model is greater than Heaven and Earth—
their mutual boundary spans tens of thousands of miles.
When the River Drum approaches the Stellar Enclosure,
the people are all seized with terror.
The shadow’s reckless advance and retreat
bring nine years of calamity.
The August Emperor, beholding the portents of Ruin,
the king retreats and reforms himself.
The key has its rises and falls,
and the black harm flees in haste.
When the Yangzi and Huai run dry,
their waters pour into the sea.

The female and male of Heaven and Earth
revolve between *zi* and *wu*.
*Yin* and *shen* are the ancestors of yin and yang,
issuing and entering, returning to their beginning.
Following the Dipper’s handle in its sweep,
grasping the balance to fix the primal order.

The cauldron and the vessel
model Qian and Kun.
The mutual boundary is the division of yin and yang,
like the place where cauldron and vessel join and meet.
It speaks of the separation between metal and wood,
as distant as Heaven and Earth—
how many tens of thousands of miles apart?
Only the Dao can bring them together.

When the River Drum approaches the Stellar Enclosure,
fire presses upon the metal position, threatening metal.
This means *li* should reside below,
yet instead it rises above.
The nature of *li* is to flame upward,
water and fire unbalanced,
unable to embrace the Qian-metal within *kan*,
violating the principle of the dragon’s descent and the tiger’s ascent.
Losing the key,
hard and soft resist each other,
failing to interpenetrate.
The true medicine scatters in all directions—
hence the people are seized with terror.
The people symbolize the medicinal substances.

The *Wuzhen Pian* says:
“The tiger is called the cliff’s head, the dragon the sea.”
The fire lies below, the metal above.
The preceding section states:
“The blazing fire spreads below,”
and again:
“Below, there is no Great Yang.”
The method’s highs and lows are clearly evident.

When the shadow recklessly advances or retreats,
the shadow marks the timing of advancing and withdrawing fire.
If the rhythm is lost—
advancing when it should not,
retreating when it should not—
then nine years of water bring calamity.
This is like the solstices altering their degrees,
the equinoxes shifting their alignments,
causing floods and droughts to contend,
mountains to collapse and the earth to split.

The sovereign, recognizing these errors and correcting them, aligns the lows and highs of the pivotal mechanism. The five *qi* follow their proper sequence, and the pernicious, rebellious *qi* flee far away. The waters of the Yangtze and Huai naturally flow to pay homage to the sea, and the medicinal substances return to their origin.

The Heaven and Earth’s female and male—lingering between *zi* and *wu*—are the true yin of *kan*-man and the true yang of *li*-woman. The *yin* and *yang* ancestors of *yin* and *shen* refer to the *yin* tally and *yang* fire originating in *yin* and *shen*. In the *Na Jia* diagram, the moon emerges from *zhen*-*geng*, where the first yang line stirs and the *yang* fire originates; the moon wanes in *xun*-*xin*, where the first yin line transforms and the *yin* tally originates. In the *Prior Heaven* trigrams, *zhen* occupies the *yin* position and *xun* the *shen* position, thus establishing the two solstices. Hence, *yin* and *shen* are the ancestors of *yin* and *yang*. The moon emerges from *yin* and enters *shen*, entering and then re-emerging—thus its rising and setting complete the cycle. Following the turning of the Dipper’s handle, the *Na Jia* fire phases are determined, hence it is said: “grasping the balance to fix the primordial纪.”

The *Yuan* Star Lord and *Ji* Star Lord are star names within the Dipper. When the *River Drum* approaches the *Star Ji*, the people are seized with terror—this speaks of failing to adhere to the method’s measures, causing the medicinal substances to scatter. When the shadow recklessly advances or retreats, nine years bring calamity—this speaks of not following the fire phases, causing water to lose its nature. The pivotal mechanism has lows and highs—this speaks of correcting errors, aligning with the method’s measures, causing pernicious *qi* to flee and disasters to dissipate. The Yangtze and Huai’s drying up, their waters flowing into the sea—this speaks of adhering to the method’s measures, following the fire phases, and the medicinal substances returning to their origin. *Zi* and *wu* refer to the medicinal substances; *yin* and *shen* refer to the fire phases. Following the Dipper’s turning, *yin* and *shen* determine the morning and evening of *pi* and *tai*. This should be carefully pondered.

This chapter elaborates on the method’s measures for intercourse and concludes with the fire phases.

Rising and toasting upon the *Fan* Mountain—
the blazing fire spreads below.
The White Tiger leads the way—
the Azure Fluid harmonizes behind.
The Vermilion Bird soars and plays,
its flying radiance displaying five hues.
Suddenly, it encounters a net cast—
pressed down, it cannot rise.
Its wailing cries are mournful,
like an infant longing for its mother.
Overturned and plunged into boiling water,
its feathers and wings are crushed and broken.
Before half the clepsydra’s mark has passed,
the dragon’s scales stir restlessly.
Five-colored images dazzle,
transforming without constant master.
The cauldron seethes and surges,
violently surging without cease.
Jumbled and layered in piles,
like interlocking canine teeth.
Its form like midwinter ice,
railing-like stalactites sprout.
Towering and tangled,
crossing and propping one another.

When yin and yang find their match,
they settle in tranquil mutual embrace.
The Green Dragon dwells in *Fang*-six—
spring blossoms in *zhen*-east-*mao*.
The White Tiger resides in *Xu*-seven—
autumn’s awns in *dui*-west-*you*.
The Vermilion Bird is in *Zhang*-two—
true yin in *li*-south-*wu*.
All three come to pay homage,
their families forming a chorus of kinship.
Originally but two substances—
in the end, they become three and five.
Three, five, and one together—
all gather in one place.

Refine them according to the above method,
and the days’ count also follows accordingly.
The White Tiger and Azure Fluid are metal and wood. The Vermilion Bird, receiving wood, generates fire—its nature is to fly and flee. Metal, having overcome wood, further restrains it with water, so the Vermilion Bird, as if caught in a net, cannot take flight. The *li* fire, unable to generate, returns to *zhen* wood—hence the dragon’s scales shimmer in five colors. *Zhen* is the dragon, *li* is radiance.

Canine teeth, winter ice, railings, and stalactites—all are true images. The Green Dragon, White Tiger, and Vermilion Bird correspond to the earlier White Tiger, Azure Fluid, and Vermilion Bird, reiterating their significance. *Fang*-six, *Xu*-seven, and *Zhang*-two are likewise reiterated. Fire is born of wood, water of metal—by mentioning these three, the Five Phases are encompassed. *Fang*-six, *Xu*-seven, and *Zhang*-two sum to three and five—these are the medicinal substances. The fire phases also take three, five, and fifteen as the count for *yang* fire, hence it is said: “the days’ count also follows accordingly.” The Dragon and Tiger, originally two substances, with fire become three and five. Together with water’s one, they form the Four Images, all converging in *wu* and *ji* to merge as one.

Whenever fire phases are discussed earlier, medicinal intercourse invariably follows. Whenever medicinal intercourse is discussed earlier, fire phases invariably follow. This should be carefully examined.

This chapter describes the images of intercourse.

First white, then yellow—
red permeates inside and out.
Named the First Cauldron,
its grains like great millet.
This is nature’s doing,
not some devious path.
Mountains and marshes’ *qi* steam,
giving rise to clouds and rain.
Dried mud becomes dust—
extinguished fire turns to earth.
Like the *nie* dye turning yellow,
or indigo forming green silk.
Hides boiled into glue,
or *gou* fermenting into wine.
Kindred substances easily work upon one another—
unrelated kinds are difficult to craft.
Only this wondrous art,
examined and verified, speaks no falsehood.
Transmitted to a hundred million generations hence,
it shines clearly and can be studied.
Bright as the starry Han,
deep as the sea’s source.
Ponder it until thoroughly familiar,
repeatedly turning it over.
After a thousand cycles, it gathers in brilliance—
after ten thousand repetitions, it becomes visible.
The divine may reveal it to one,
or the soul suddenly awaken.
Probe its beginnings, seek its threads—
you will surely find its gate.
The Dao of Heaven favors none—
it is always transmitted to the worthy.

The fire within *li* is originally white; receiving lead, it turns yellow. When the fire is sufficient and the elixir is formed, it changes to red—then the color shifts further to purple. Red permeating inside and out embodies *qian* as great red. The millet-pearl takes form, named the First Cauldron—this is the completion of the elixir path. The sages’ and worthies’ words all follow methodical order.

This chapter describes the image of the elixir’s completion when the fire is sufficient.

The *Five Phases’ Mutual Generation* and the *Cantong Qi* expound broadly but do not achieve purity. Minute details remain unaddressed, leaving gaps and approximations.

Here now is the translation, continuing the established conventions:

---

I have therefore compiled and recorded anew, filling gaps and omissions, refining what is profound and obscure, linking threads to ensure coherence, aligning intent and purpose without deviation. Thus I compose this work, naming it *The Five Phases’ Mutual Generation*, wherein the nature and essence of the great *Yi* are fully revealed.

The Five Positions harmonize, each with its proper union:
*Yi* floats as stone, *ding* patterns with civil fire, *ji* governs matter, *xin* embodies worldly silver, *gui* is true lead—three woods, two fires, five earths, four metals, one water.
*Jia* sinks as stone, *bing* blazes with martial fire, *wu* refines the medicine, *geng* embodies worldly gold, *ren* is true mercury.
This is the *Luoshu*’s primordial numbering.

The great *Yi*’s nature and essence each adhere to their measure. The teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, when examined, may be applied. The work of furnace and fire has true foundation: the Three Ways emerge from One, all following the same path. The learning of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi arises from the great *Yi*; the discourse on furnace and fire is grounded in the Yellow Emperor and Laozi. These three all derive from the *Yi*, each addressing nature and essence alone.

Branches, stems, blossoms, leaves—fruit hangs in abundance. Yet the root remains primary, unchanging in its original state. What is spoken in sincerity is precise and without error. It is like the tree that in spring sends forth stems and branches, by summer opens blossoms and spreads leaves, and by autumn bears fruit—yet the source of its growth lies in the root. Thus it is said: the root remains primary, unchanging in its original state. This means it does not lose its inherent nature.

From the flourishing of *Tai* to the purity of *Qian*, the root lies in the *Fu* hexagram, founded at the winter solstice. The wondrous work of return and reversal arises from the single yang of midnight. What the sages and perfected ones kept secret—scholars know only the function of the single yang, yet *Lin*, *Tai*, *Zhuang*, and *Guai* transform naturally, without need of human effort. Thus I single out the image of the midwinter season to reveal it.

This passage connects to what follows, likening the root to the winter solstice. Thus it says: “Like the midwinter season, bamboo and trees are all broken and harmed.” For the stems and branches of spring become the blossoms and leaves of summer, and the blossoms and leaves of summer become the fruit of autumn—all arising from the midwinter’s breaking and harming. The primordial flourishing lies hidden in the root, receiving its generation at the first return of the single yang.

Like the midwinter season, bamboo and trees are all broken and harmed.
Assisting yang, merchants and travelers halt; the lord deeply conceals himself.
Following the season’s rhythm, mouths close and words cease.
The Dao of Heaven is vast and boundless; the Great Mystery has no form.
The empty and still cannot be seen; their boundaries dissolve and vanish.
Pursuing error leads only to ruin; speech returns to self-defeat.
Distinguish and clarify these Four Images to enlighten later generations of the blind.

Here the winter solstice reveals the mechanism of the single yang. “Assisting yang, merchants and travelers halt; the lord deeply conceals himself” corresponds to the *Fu* hexagram’s “merchants do not travel, the lord does not inspect the regions.” Scholars who fail to grasp the essentials must have this restated—how deep is the author’s concern for later ages! “Distinguish and clarify these Four Images”: lead and mercury both reside in *ren* and *gui*. *Ren* is *li* within *qian*; *gui* is *kan* within *kun*—how profound!

These two passages focus entirely on the single-yang fire timing.

A rustic from the borderlands, a withered scholar from a secluded valley,
clinging to simplicity, disdaining glory and honor,
dwelling in obscurity, heedless of reputation,
holding fast to tranquility, hoping for peace in his time.
At ease in reclusion, he composed this text,
chanting the great *Yi*, the words of the Three Sages.
Examining its purport, he found a single thread running through all.
Plain and clear, it needs no annotation.
Its purpose is to follow principle and radiate the spirit,
so that transformation flows freely and the Four Seas know peace.
Set forth as a calendar, it may be followed for ten thousand generations.
Arranged to guide governance, it may be practiced without burden.
Applied to nurture nature, it accords with the Yellow Emperor and Laozi’s spontaneity.
Those who embody virtue deeply return to the root and revert to the origin.
It lies near in my heart, not apart from my own body.
Embracing the One without release, one may endure forever.
Paired with ingestion, yin and yang are arrayed.
Refined cinnabar from Wudu is selected; the Eight Stones are discarded.
When use is precise and success assured, the world treasures it.
Three paths are laid out, their branches and stems interconnected.
Though names differ, all emerge from a single gate.
Not merely piling up lines, this text achieves harmony.
It holds true substance; its rough outlines are worth observing.
If I were to expound falsely, I would only incur redundancy.
Thus I name it *Cantong Qi*, revealing its subtleties in brief.
Few words convey great meaning; descendants should heed it.

Following the principle of the *Luoshu*, one may cause transformation to flow freely and the Four Seas to know peace. When set forth, it may serve to regulate the calendar and clarify the seasons. When the Five Phases are properly ordered, it may be used to establish the pole and govern the state—this is the emperor’s tool. When applied to nurture nature, it is the return to the root, the embrace of the One for enduring life—this is the scholar’s tool.

Abandoning the times to avoid harm, one takes refuge in the mountains.
Roaming the vast expanse, one dwells beside ghosts.
Transforming the body to become immortal, one merges into silence.
Once in a hundred generations, one wanders among men,
displaying feathered wings, soaring east, west, south, and north.
When Tang faced adversity, drought and flood divided the land.
Branches and leaves withered and yellowed, losing their flourishing splendor.
The virtuous carry one another’s burdens—secure and stable, they may attain long life.

This is Wei Boyang’s four-character cipher, as noted earlier.

**Song of the Cauldron and Vessel**
*Kun* is the cauldron, concealing *kan*;
*Qian* is the vessel, concealing *li*.
Separate, they are *qian* and *kun*; united, they form cauldron and vessel.
Round three-five, one inch in measure.
“Round three-five, one inch in measure”: when yin and yang unite, three and five return to one. This is what Peng the Perfected meant by “the coherence of principle and phrasing.” “Round” refers to the union of *qian* and *kun*.
Mouth four-eight.
The “mouth” is the Gate of the Mysterious Female. In its entry and exit, transformations manifest the Four Images and Eight Trigrams. The cauldron holds metal and water; the vessel holds wood and fire.

The *kun*-cauldron holds the Three Male [trigrams],
The *qian*-vessel holds the Three Female [trigrams].
Two-inch lips—
Yin and yang qi divide at their boundary, the so-called “mutual channel.”
Twelve inches in length, evenly thick and thin.
The cauldron embodies six yang [lines], the vessel six yin [lines],
Corresponding to the twelve earthly branches, where yin and yang are balanced.
The above discusses the union of cauldron and vessel, where medicinal substances are complete.

The belly aligns at three—
Heaven has its belly-alignment, the celestial center (as seen in the *Astronomical Treatise* of the *Jin [Dynasty History]*).
Earth and humanity likewise possess a center, the gate of the Three Powers’ conception.
In heaven and earth, it is the root of heaven and earth;
In humanity, it is the moisture of the Mysterious Female.

Sit and let warmth descend—
Yin above, yang rushing below.
This is the method of advancing fire, enabling water and fire to achieve harmony.

The cauldron emerges from *kun*, as yin;
The vessel emerges from *qian*, as yang—
The so-called “one upper and lower crucible.”
This discusses the method of refining and tempering.

Head and tail in strength, the middle in civility—
The rhythm of advancing fire.
This discusses the fire-times of the celestial circuit.

Beginning with seventy, ending at three decades.
Two hundred and six, well-tempered and balanced.
Yin’s fire is white; the yellow sprout is lead.
The fire of yin essence is inherently white; upon encountering lead, the sprout becomes yellow.

Two sevens’ apertures, assisting and aiding humanity—
The White Tiger’s seven-numbered cauldron,
The Azure Dragon’s seven-starred vessel,
Each possessing seven apertures.
When the two sevens unite, they assist and aid in forming the sacred embryo.

Gaze upon the brain’s principles, stabilize the ascent of the mysterious—
Once the embryo is formed, it ascends into the upper palace for nurturance.
This discusses the manifestation of the sacred embryo.

The child resides at the center, secure and preserved.
Coming and going in roaming, yet never leaving the gate.
Abundant and fully grown, emotions and principles pure.
Returning to the One, reverting to the original source.
Upon completing one cycle, the toil is great.
Guard it closely, never grow confused or dull.
The path is distant, again profound and obscure.
Should one attain this, they will comprehend *qian* and *kun*.
With the *daogui* applied, the hun and po are purified.
Those who delight in the Dao seek its root.
Examine the Five Phases, determine the precise weights.
Contemplate deeply—no need for further discourse.
Guard it in seclusion, do not transmit the text.
This discusses the preservation of the sacred embryo.

Ascend on a white crane, ride the dragon’s scales.
Roam the Great Void, pay homage to the Immortal Lords.
Receive the celestial chart, be titled Perfected One.
This discusses the embryo’s liberation and spiritual transformation.

In praise:

Qian serves as the abode of Li, Kun as the enclosure of Kan.
True yin resides in Li, true yang dwells in Kan.
Li receives the wife of *ji*, Kan receives the husband of *wu*.
Sun and moon form a jade bi-disc, with *wu* and *ji* as the pivot.
The guest floats, the host sinks—control the existent through the nonexistent.
Medicine and matter: the two eights of the *Hetu*.
The Five Thieves govern the fire, the *Huangji* follows the *Luoshu*.
Modeling the images of Fu Xi’s *Yi*, align the hexagrams and select the tally.
Master Wei, true teacher, awakened my dull ignorance.
With a hundred bows and prostrations, you stand as the eternal exemplar.
Through thirty generations above and below, the fire-times are transmitted only by mouth.
Those who faithfully receive and practice this shall forever be immortals of Yaochi.

*This concludes the third scroll of the* Zhouyi Cantong Qi. *The character* 「炁」 *here is written as* 「气」 *in the* Kaoyi *edition.*
