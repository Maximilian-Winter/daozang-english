### **The Supreme Yang Master’s Essential Diagrams of the Golden Elixir**

**Diagram of the Supreme Ultimate**
Before yin and yang divided, its form resembled a hen’s egg.

**Diagram of the Supreme Ultimate’s Division**
"That which is called the Dao/Way consists of one yin and one yang."
Dark and turbid is yin; white and pure is yang.

The Supreme Ultimate is the origin of yin and yang.
Heaven and Earth are the forms of yin and yang.

**Diagram of the Prior-Heaven Supreme Ultimate**
Yin gives rise to yang as the Supreme Ultimate; inverting its function produces the Elixir.

**Diagram of the Post-Heaven Supreme Ultimate**
Yang gives rise to yin as the Supreme Ultimate; when the Five Phases flow in sequence, completion is achieved.

**Diagram of the Ninefold Return of the Golden Elixir**
Yin and yang unite; water and fire achieve mutual fulfillment.

**Diagram of the Sevenfold Reversion of the Golden Elixir**
Within blackness lies whiteness; the body transforms into pure *qian*.

**Diagram of the Five Phases in the Golden Elixir**
Heaven One generates Water—within Water, the true yang *qi* is Black Lead.
Lead is the ancestor of the Five Metals, and Metal rightfully resides in the West.
It is not called "Metal" but "Silver," for it resembles the white color of *dui*.

Metal inherently generates Water, yet the cultivator of the Elixir extracts Metal from *kan* because the mother conceals the child within the womb.

Earth Two generates Fire—within Fire, the true yin essence is Black Mercury.
Mercury is the father of cinnabar, and Mercury rightfully resides in the East.
It is not called "Wood" but "Mercury," for it is the Wood-fluid of the *zhen* palace.

Wood inherently generates Fire, yet the cultivator of the Elixir seeks the Wood-fluid within *li* because it is where the bowstring’s *qi* resides.

Sequential...

**Diagram of the Three-Five-One of the Golden Elixir**

Master Ziyang says:
*"Three, five, one—just these three words,
Yet rare indeed are those who truly comprehend.
East three and south two together make five,
North one and west four complete the sum.
Wu and ji reside in the generative number five,
The three families meet to form the infant.
The infant is the One containing true qi,
After ten months the womb is full—enter the sacred foundation."*

Master Shangyang says:
*"The One is the ancestral qi of Heaven and Earth.
To understand the Three-Five-One is to know the origin of true Lead."*

**Diagram of Purity and Turbidity, Movement and Stillness**
**The Original Substance of Qian and Kun**
**Li and Kan as Function**

The Great Dao generates the One qi,
Within qi, yin and yang divide.
Yin is turbid, yang is pure;
The female is black, the male is white.

The Most High says:
*"Know the white, guard the black;
Know the male, guard the female."*

Thus the scripture states:
*"Purity is the source of turbidity,
Movement the foundation of stillness.
If one can abide in constant purity and stillness,
Heaven and Earth all return to them."*

Master Niwan says:
*"In my former practice, after a year’s work,
The six pulses stilled and qi returned to the root.
Now my whole body is white blood,
And I feel no cold or heat through the four seasons."*

Master Ziyang says:
*"Black and white support each other as Water and Metal."*

Master Shangyang says:
*"Qian and Kun are the body,
Yet it is the white within Kan that returns to Li.
Thus it is called the Golden Elixir."*

**Diagram of the Precious Pearl**

A single precious pearl,
First born within the oyster’s womb,
Nurtured beneath the black dragon’s chin.

The World-Honored One obtained it,
Calling it *maṇi*.
The Heavenly Worthy obtained it,
Calling it a grain of millet.

The great practitioner must know the truth of this pearl—
It is the single point of Kan-Li’s interpenetration,
In virtue harmonizing with Heaven and Earth,
In luminosity uniting with sun and moon.

Called the *maṇi* pearl—
Offered by the dragon maiden.
Called the Pearl of Yuanshi—
Taken from the sea oyster.
Called the Wish-Fulfilling Pearl—
Paired with the alchemical maiden.
Called the Fire Pearl—
The treasure of the black dragon’s chin.

Though worldly pearls may span an inch,
They are but playthings with a price.
This pearl, though most subtle,
Cannot be played with, cannot be seen—
Yet it is the priceless treasure.

**Diagram of the Four Images of the Golden Elixir**

The sun and moon are the essence of Qian and Kun,
Li and Kan the function of yin and yang.
Qian and Kun serve as the crucible—
To gather the essence of sun and moon.
Yin and yang serve as furnace and charcoal—
To conjoin the qi of Kan and Li.

The Elixir method inverts to form *Earth-Heaven Peace*,
The Elixir path reverses to achieve *Water-Fire Interpenetration*.

The scripture says:
*"The sun dwelling in Li’s position becomes the woman,
Kan paired with the Toad Palace becomes the man.
Without a teacher’s guidance, this truth is hard to know."*

**Diagram of the Eight Trigrams of the Golden Elixir**
**Exposition on the Eight Trigrams of the Golden Elixir**

The trigram is the image.
Where there is a body, there must be function;
Where there is change, there must be union.

If Gen is taken as the body, then Kun is its function;
If Zhen is taken as the body, then Dui is its function.

The *Book of Changes* says:
*"In the southwest, one finds companions,
And walks with one’s kind."*
This is like Li taking Kan as its kind.

For the cultivation of the Golden Elixir,
One takes Metal from Dui,
Yet Dui is the White Tiger,
Whose heart is set on devouring,
Causing no small harm to people and things.
If one can master the Green Dragon of Zhen Palace,
Then one can naturally subdue the Tiger.

The Golden Elixir—
To subdue the White Tiger alone is the task;
All else is easy.

Now, Dui is born of Kun and acts in Kun’s stead,
Qian Metal generates Dui,
Yet when its simplicity scatters,
Qian lodges its Metal in Kan,
Calling it Black Lead.
To take Dui’s Metal from Kan—
The mother conceals the child within the womb.

The Buddhist scripture speaks of
*"One mouthful swallowing the waters of the Western River"*—
This is the meaning.

**Diagram of the Mutual Resonance of Forms and Things**
**Exposition on the Mutual Resonance of Forms and Things**

Lord Laozi said:
Inwardly observe the heart—yet the heart is not the heart;
Outwardly observe the form—yet the form is not the form;
From afar observe the thing—yet the thing is not the thing.
When these three are awakened,
Only emptiness is seen.

The Buddhist scripture says:
*"Within heaven and earth, amid the cosmos,
There is a treasure concealed in the mountain of form."*

It also says:
*"I possess one thing,
Above it props up the sky, below it props up the earth—
Do any of you recognize it?"*

The *Book of Changes* states:
*"That which is above form is called the Dao."*

It further states:
*"When male and female unite their essence,
The myriad things transform and come to life."*

The three teachings of cultivation
Never depart from form and thing.
Thus Elder Danyang said:
*"Quickly press me down into the mountain,
Hastily break open the cave of Dragon and Tiger."*

Elder Boyang said:
*"Ears, eyes, mouth—the three treasures,
Seal them tightly, let nothing pass.
The true person hides in the deep abyss,
Floating and wandering, guarding the compass within."*

When one awakens to this,
Only then does one know that the forms of Dragon and Tiger,
The things of Tortoise and Snake,
All arise from within the human body.
Without these two,
The sacred embryo cannot be joined.
This wondrous truth must not be neglected.

**Suspended Embryo Crucible**
The crucible measures one foot and five inches in circumference, with a hollow center of five inches, and is one foot and two inches in length. It is divided into three layers, corresponding to the Three Powers. The body and belly of the crucible are straight and uniform, with equal proportions in the upper, middle, and lower sections. Eight inches are placed into the furnace, suspended within the hearth without touching the ground—hence the name "Suspended Embryo." It is also called the Cinnabar Crucible.

Zhang Sui’s annotation states: It is also named the *Taiyi Divine Furnace*.

**To the Tune of "Courtyard Full of Fragrance"**
A true iron ox,
Ugly in form, stubborn in nature,
Ever fond of racing.
Everyone possesses one,
Yet who knows how to ride it?
Planting the golden sprout fills the courtyard,
But it must be watered with divine liquid.
Within the Central Palace,
Without this beast,
How could the infant be born?

Heaven and Earth,
In true motion and stillness,
All life and sustenance depend on it.
When hungry, it feeds on tiger marrow;
When thirsty, it drinks from the mercury pool.
At midnight, it pulls the chariot to stoke the fire,
Bursting with radiance,
Illuminating the depths of the sea.
The shepherd boy laughs,
After feasting in the Flowery Pond,
Riding home beneath the moon’s glow.

**Crescent Moon Furnace**
The furnace’s surface measures approximately one foot and two inches in circumference. The "bright heart" spans one foot horizontally, with a two-inch rim encircling it, and the rim is two inches thick. The furnace’s mouth opens like an inverted cauldron or an upturned crescent moon—hence the name *Crescent Moon Furnace*.

Zhang Sui’s annotation: It is also called the *Majestic Radiance Crucible*.

**Purple Clarity Golden Elixir Fire Timing Formula**
Gather the transformations of Heaven and Earth,
Knead the sun and moon into refined ashes.
The Metal Duke falls silent, the Enchanting Maiden dies,
Yet the Yellow Dame, though ageless, still nurtures the embryo.

**True Fire Has No Timing**
In the lead furnace, slowly nurture the true golden liquid.

Within the earthen crucible, first dry the living mercury;
The Great Medicine knows no measure—pound or mercury—
Yet the heart refines the Crimson Dragon’s nature,
The leaden body congeals qi into the White Tiger’s life.

Within and without, not a trace of yin remains,
Amidst the radiance of ten thousand forms, the Jade Clarity realm.

*Forest Spirit and Phoenix: Diagram of the Golden Elixir’s Symbolism in the Pitch-Pot Method*
**Oral Instructions:**
The golden vase casts the wooden arrow,
The qi-cavern draws the spirit home.
With heart upright and form aligned,
The mechanism unfolds with skill.
Knowing this secret is none other than
The Dao of "only essence, only unity,"
Faithfully holding to the center.

**Master of Heaven and Earth** says:
A thousand schemes are but mad pursuits,
Only the Golden Elixir enters the pot.
Grasp the principle of "not empty, not existent,"
And the work of cultivating truth costs no effort.

**Master of Heaven and Earth** was a man of Eastern Wu.
